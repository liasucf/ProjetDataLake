On 8 July 1963 a Detachment of the 33rd Tactical Group was established at C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1. In May 1963 Detachment 7, 8th Aerial Port Squadron was established at C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1. On 8 July 1963 a Detachment of the 33rd Tactical Group was established at C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 replacing Detachment 3, 6220th Air Base Squadron. The RVNAF maintained a detachment from its 122nd Liaison Squadron equipped with 5 O-1 Bird Dogs. In mid-1963 Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) proposed the construction of a runway near C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 to replace the existing runway at S\u00f3c Tr\u0103ng Airfield which was unsuitable for night and wet weather operations with a projected US$4.5 million construction cost and a 2-year construction period. On the night of 16 July 1963 a Viet Cong (VC) mortar attack on C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 Airfield wounded 17 ARVN and US Special Forces troops. In July 1963 the 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron was activated at Bien Hoa Air Base, becoming operational on 15 September, it maintained a detachment of 6 O-1s at C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1. In January 1964 given the need for heavier aircraft to be available for quick reaction air support in the Mekong Delta, CINCPAC approved the construction of a new airfield at C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 for a cost of US$2.5 million to be ready within one year. Construction of the new Binh Thuy Air Base, 7km northwest of C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 Airfield began in February 1964. In April 1964, Detachment 3, 619th Tactical Control Squadron was organized at the base. In the same month the RVNAF 74th Tactical Wing was established. ===1966-72=== The base was originally established by the 9th Infantry Division.
