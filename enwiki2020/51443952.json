This site has two types of grassland, both of which are rare in Cambridgeshire. They are calcareous grassland on Jurassic limestone and base-poor marshy neutral grassland. The base poor areas have a diverse variety of plant species, including some which are locally uncommon. The site is private land but a public footpath runs through the northern end. ==References== Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cambridgeshire ",
