    "text": "The Battle of Hojuji was fought in January 1184 during the Genpei War (1180\u20131185) between feuding factions of the Minamoto clan, and involved retaining the influence of the retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa. During the Genpei War (1180\u20131185), the retired and cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa supported the Minamoto clan, but got caught up in the internal power struggles. After capturing Kyoto in the Battle of Shinowara, Minamoto no Yoshinaka pursued Go- Shirakawa and his cousin Minamoto Yoritomo. Yoshinaka burned Shirakawa's palace and brutally attacked his troops in addition to gaining control over Shirakawa's Imperial Prison.Jacques, Tony. Dictionary of Battles and Sieges.
