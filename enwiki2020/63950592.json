The Art Collection of James-Alexandre, comte de Pourtal\u00e8s-Gorgier was a collection of sculpture, antiques and paintings owned by James-Alexandre de Pourtal\u00e8s, Comte de Pourtal\u00e8s-Gorgier until his death in 1855. ==History== The Comte de Pourtal\u00e8s-Gorgier (1776\u20131855), was a Swiss-French banker who served as Chamberlain to the King of Prussia and was awarded the title of Count by King Frederick William III, who ruled Prussia during the Napoleonic Wars and the end of the Holy Roman Empire. The collection was largely held at H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, his h\u00f4tel particulier (essentially a grand townhouse) on Rue Tronchet in the 6th arrondissement of Lyon. The collection, which started with a vase, included the Laughing Cavalier by Frans Hals and works by Bronzino, Rembrandt, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and a Sandro Botticelli portrait. In 1825, he donated a mummy and coffin he acquired from the Thedenat-Duvent sale, to the Berlin Museum. In February and March 1865, ten years after his death, his collection was auctioned off in Paris in accordance with his will. The majority of his collection was photographed and published in a large folio catalog by Goupil & Cie. The Laughing Cavalier was purchased by Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford (who outbid Baron James Mayer de Rothschild). William Tyssen-Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney bought some of the important Egyptian objects. Sir Charles Thomas Newton spent 60,919 francs on bronzes and vases for the British Museum, and 47,000 francs on Giustiniani's Apollo. ==Collection== ;Paintings File:Cavalier soldier Hals-1624x.jpg|Laughing Cavalier by Frans Hals File:Agnolo Bronzino - Portrait of a Young Man.jpg|Portrait of a Young Man with a Book by Agnolo Bronzino, 1540 File:Saint Philip Neri (1515\u20131595) MET DP-944-001.jpg|Saint Philip Neri, by Carlo Dolci, File:Fra Angelico - The Healing of Palladia by Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian - WGA00511.jpg|\"The Healing of Palladia by Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian\", by Fra Angelico, \u20131440 File:Sandro Botticelli, Portrait of a Youth, c. 1482-1485, NGA 21.jpg|Portrait of a Youth. by Sandro Botticelli, \u20131485 File:Workshop of Titian, Allegory of Love, c. 1520-1540, NGA 400.jpg|Allegory of Love, by the Workshop of Titian, \u20131540 File:Quentin Massys, Ill-Matched Lovers, c. 1520-1525, NGA 52622.jpg|Ill-Matched Lovers, by Quentin Massys, \u20131525 File:Rembrandt van Rijn (and Workshop?), The Apostle Paul, c. 1657, NGA 1198.jpg|The Apostle Paul, by Rembrandt van Rijn, File:Dosso DOSSI , Battista DOSSI (attributed to) - Lucrezia Borgia, Duchess of Ferrara - Google Art Project.jpg|Lucrezia Borgia, Duchess of Ferrara, by Battista Dossi, \u20131530 File:The Landscape Painter.JPG|\"The Landscape Painter\" by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher File:Leyden Bearing of the Cross.jpg|Bearing of the Cross with St. Veronica, by Lucas van Leyden, File:Henri d'Albret (1503\u201355), King of Navarre MET DT572.jpg|Henri d'Albret King of Navarre, by L\u00e9onard Limousin, 1556 File:Anne de Pisseleu (1508\u20131576), Duchesse d'\u00c9tampes MET DP102428.jpg|Anne de Pisseleu Duchesse d'\u00c9tampes, by Corneille de Lyon, \u201340 ;Sculpture and pottery File:Head Apollo BM Sc1547.jpg|Head of Apollo, that was once in the collection of Vincenzo Giustiniani, Roman copy of \u2013140 File:Hera Borghese N4525.jpg|Head of the Borghese Hera File:Bronze Apollon Louvre Br522.jpg|Apollo, holding his (lost) bow in the right hand and a (lost) laurel branch in the left hand File:Mercury tortoise Louvre Br184.jpg|Mercury, holding a lost object, probably a tortoise, 1st century BC File:Stele of Jason BM 1865.1-3.3.jpg|Funerary stele of Jason, BC File:Sacrifice \u00e0 D\u00e9m\u00e9ter et Core (Louvre, Ma 752).jpg|Sacrifice to Demeter (Ceres) and Core (Proserpine), \u2013320 BC File:Death Actaeon BM VaseF176.jpg|Actaeon attacked by his hounds by Dolon Painter File:Dionysos kantharos Louvre CA2981-2984.jpg|Dionysos holding a kantharos, \u2013480 BC File:Dionysos Ploutos BM F68.jpg|Dionysos and Ploutos surrounded by satyrs and maenads, \u2013360 BC File:Thetis Peleus Louvre G373.jpg|Peleus wrestling Thetis and holding her as she transforms into a snake, BC File:Xanthias Heracles BM VaseF233.jpg|The actor Xanthias, standing next to a statuette of Heracles, \u2013340 BC File:Zeus Louvre G204.jpg|Zeus wielding the thunderbolt in his right hand, \u2013470 BC File:Dish- The Destruction of the Hosts of Pharaoh MET SLP1232-1.jpg|\"The Destruction of the Hosts of Pharaoh\" (front), by Jacques Courtois, early 17th century File:Dish- The Destruction of the Hosts of Pharaoh MET SLP1232-2.jpg|\"The Destruction of the Hosts of Pharaoh\" (back), by Jacques Courtois, early 17th century File:Dish with Achelous and Theseus MET DP326942.jpg|Dish with Achelous and Theseus, by Maestro Domenego da Venezia, \u201370 ==References== ;Sources ;Further reading *Pourtal\u00e8s-Gorgier.
