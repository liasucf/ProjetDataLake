It is a large Baroque building, with a highly decorated chapel.See Patrim\u00f3nio Arquitect\u00f3nico. 1: Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa. Lisbon: Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia / Museu de S\u00e3o Roque, 2006. The monastery was established by Ant\u00f3nio Lu\u00eds de Meneses, who promised to built the monastery if he prevailed in the Battle of Montes Claros. When the religious orders, convents, and monasteries in Portugal were closed by the government in 1833, the monastery buildings were handed over to the Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa (a society charged with helping the old, the sick, and abandoned or orphaned children). At present the Santa Casa uses the buildings as a home for young girls. == Location/address == Rua de S\u00e3o Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara at Rua Luisa Todi in Lisbon.
