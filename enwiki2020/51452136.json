The tower house at Donore is assumed to be one of these castles, built by the local power, the Mac Eochag\u00e1in (McGeoghegans). In 1650, during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, the castle was taken by forces under Sir John Reynolds and over 40 members of the McGeoghegan family were massacred.
