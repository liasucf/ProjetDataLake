    "text": "On 13 June 2004, regional elections were held in Belgium, to choose representatives in the regional councils of the Flemish Parliament, the Walloon Parliament, the Brussels Parliament and the German-speaking Community of Belgium. The elections were held on the same day as the European elections. == Flemish Parliament == In the Flemish Parliament election, the liberal- socialist government was put to the test. The far right Vlaams Blok became the second largest party in Flanders just after the alliance of conservatives Christian Democratic and Flemish-New Flemish Alliance (CD&V; \\- N-VA). The green party Groen! managed to be elected and keeps half of their seats in the parliament. In contrast with the previous election, the People's Union (VU-ID) has split and the new parties, N-VA and Spirit, allied with CD&V; and Different Socialist Party (SP.A) respectively. Because of the cordon sanitaire of all the other parties against Vlaams Blok, a coalition of at least three parties needed to be formed in order to have a majority in the Flemish Parliament. Groen! confirmed that it did not want to take part in the new coalition, so the only coalition left was a conservative-socialist-liberal tripartite. In the aftermath of the elections, Yves Leterme (CD&V;) was selected to form a Flemish regional government. ===Details=== {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center; font-size:93%\" |- ! colspan=2|Region !! colspan=6|Seats won per party !! rowspan=2|Total seats |- ! !!
