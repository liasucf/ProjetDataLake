    "text": "Alfonso Dar\u00edo Pereyra Bueno (born 19 October 1956) is a Uruguayan former football player. Having played for Club Nacional de Football in his home country, he reached stardom playing for S\u00e3o Paulo FC as a centre-back along with Oscar. He is still remembered and revered as one of the best centre-backs in the history of Brazilian football. Legend has it that, whilst returning from a victory in an away match that crowned S\u00e3o Paulo the Brazilian champions, he wouldn't understand what the fuss was all about, but the supporters would not let him sleep. He had won a few times the national championship in Uruguay, so he felt that winning the Brazilian championship was nothing special. He latter realized how difficult it is to win a Brazilian National title. It had been the first time S\u00e3o Paulo F.C. won that championship. ==Career== ===Playing career=== Dar\u00edo Pereyra started his career at the Nacional de Montevideo and debuted at the Uruguay national squad when he was only 18, becoming the captain of the national team at 19. After having scored 14 goals in 34 matches for the Nacional, S\u00e3o Paulo F.C. hired him on 17 October 1977 for 5 million cruzeiros, the second largest sum to be ever paid for a player at the time in Brazil.\"Contus\u00e3o invis\u00edvel\", Placar magazine issue 450, 8 December 1978, Editora Abril, pg. 33 He arrived at the Congonhas airport wearing a S\u00e3o Paulo jersey, and was received warmly by the supporters of that team.\"Chegou!\". Jornal da Tarde, 18 October 1977 Pereyra was not able to play immediately after his arrival, for he did not have the necessary documentation to do so. In December 1977, Real Madrid C.F. made an offer that could have cut his S\u00e3o Paulo career short, but the player was not interested in playing in Spain at that particular time.\"Dario chegou, para felicidade de todos\". Jornal da Tarde, 5 December 1977, Edi\u00e7\u00e3o de Esportes, pg. 9 Throughout his time at S\u00e3o Paulo, he and Oscar, who was also a centre-back, became a line of defence that is frequently remembered as one of the best in that club's history.Alexandre da Costa, Almanaque do S\u00e3o Paulo Placar. Editora Abril, 2005, pg. 382 He played a total of 451 matches in that club, scoring 38 goals. After the 1988 S\u00e3o Paulo state championship, Pereyra has transferred to Flamengo, where he played only 11 matches. After that, he was hired by Palmeiras in early 1989, when he was already 32. In the following year, he played for two years at Gamba Osaka, then called Matsushita Electronic, where he would end his playing career. Dar\u00edo Pereyra also made regular appearances in the Uruguay national team, and has played in the 1986 FIFA World Cup.Dar\u00edo Pereyra Statistics FIFA. Retrieved 27 January 2010. ===Managerial career=== Dar\u00edo was an assistant manager at S\u00e3o Paulo when he took over the interim manager position in 1997, succeeding manager Muricy Ramalho. Under his management, S\u00e3o Paulo shook off a weak campaign in the S\u00e3o Paulo State Championship, but the team only obtained the vice-championship title and a 13th position in the Campeonato Brasileiro. After 1998, Pereyra was replaced by manager Nelsinho Baptista. On 3 October 1998, Pereyra was the fifth manager to take up Coritiba in that very year. However, he managed to lead the team to six victories and five draws in 13 matches. At the end of the 1998 Brazilian championship, he managed Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro, where he eventually obtained the Minas Gerais State Championship in 1999. ===Personal life=== Pereyra is currently employed by football marketing company Traffic in Brazil as a supervisor responsible for discovering talented, young football players.Dar\u00edo Pereyra, um \u2018espi\u00e3o\u2019 uruguaio nos treinamentos da sele\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00c1frica do Sul.
