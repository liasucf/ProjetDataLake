In 2013, the company partnered with GAIN Clean Fuels to open a compressed natural gas station in Gary, Indiana. The CNG station is one of the largest in the Midwest. The company is led by CEO Rick Roehl. Rick maintains his CDL and still delivers loads to customers as a way to stay close to the work of truck drivers. He is the only CEO of a major trucking company to do this. The company created the Roehl Way of Protective Driving, which uses the Safe 7 driving techniques. The safe seven driving techniques are: Slow Down!, Stay Back!, Know What's Happening, Yield to Others, Expect the Expected, Prepare to Drive, Reduce the Risk. ==Awards== Roehl Transport won the trucking industry's highest honor, the American Trucking Associations' President's Trophy three times (2008, 2011 and 2015 ).
