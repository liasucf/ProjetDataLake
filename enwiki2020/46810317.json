The team has produced several Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) fighters, most notably being Conor McGregor. ==History== The gym was founded in 2001 by John Kavanagh, who was a black belt in karate. Later that year it became part of Matt Thornton's Straight Blast Gym International (SBGi), a worldwide association of over 35 gyms, after Kavanagh met Thornton at a tournament in Africa. After partnering with SBGi, Thornton awarded Kavanagh his Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) purple belt in 2002. Three years later, Kavanagh won gold at the 2005 European BJJ Championship. In 2007, he was awarded his BJJ black belt, making Kavanagh Ireland's first ever BJJ black belt in the process. After 15 years at SBG Ireland, main striking coach Owen Roddy announced his departure in the end of November 2018. ==Ultimate Fighting Championship== In 2009, Tom Egan became SBG's first ever fighter to compete in the UFC. Egan lost to John Hathaway at UFC 93: Franklin vs. Henderson in Dublin. It wasn't until 2012 that SBG returned to the UFC, when Gunnar Nelson made his debut against DaMarques Johnson at UFC on Fuel TV: Struve vs. Miocic, winning via first-round rear-naked choke. The following year, Conor McGregor made his debut in Sweden. He defeated Marcus Brimage with a first-round knockout, and marked the beginning of a new era of success for the team. At UFC 189 on July 11 2015, SBG won their first UFC belt. In the main event of the evening, Conor McGregor had been booked to face Jos\u00e9 Aldo for the UFC Featherweight title. Aldo pulled out of the fight due to a rib injury however, meaning McGregor instead faced Chad Mendes for the interim title. McGregor won the fight via second-round TKO, on a card that also featured a loss and a victory for SBG fighters Cathal Pendred and Gunnar Nelson respectively. At UFC 194, an event which set numerous records, Conor McGregor finally got the chance to become the undisputed UFC Featherweight champion, and unify his belt against Jos\u00e9 Aldo who had been undefeated in over ten years. It took McGregor only 13 seconds to KO the Brazilian, making it the fastest ever finish in a UFC championship match. ==The Ultimate Fighter== Following McGregor's interim title win at UFC 189, the UFC announced that he would be coaching against Urijah Faber in Season 22 of The Ultimate Fighter. In a \"Europe vs USA\" themed installment, McGregor was aided by his SBG coaches, Sergey Pikulskiy, Owen Roddy, Arkadiusz Sternalski and former SBG fighter Tom Egan who now coaches out of Peter Welch's Gym in Boston. Despite a slow start, Team Europe took six fighters into the quarter-finals, and then had three of the remaining four in the semi-finals. SBG's Artem Lobov was due to face England's Saul Rogers in an all-European Final, but visa issues saw Team USA's Ryan Hall replace Rogers in the season finale, where he utilized his superior grappling to great effect, and earned a unanimous decision victory over Lobov. ==Fighters== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Status !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Name !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Weight Class !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Information !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Most Recent Promotion |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | |145 lb |Four-time Finnish medalist in Greco-Roman and Freestyle Wrestling. |Ultimate Fighting Championship |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Francisco Barrio |145 lb |Five-time international medalist in Greco-Roman Wrestling. |Final Fight Championship |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Owen Roddy |135-145 lb |Black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu |Cage Warriors |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Ilias Bulaid |145 lb |World Champion in Kickboxing. |Enfusion |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Pedro Carvalho |145 lb | |Bellator |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Kiefer Crosbie |170 lb | |Bellator |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Aisling Daly |115 lb |Black Belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. |Ultimate Fighting Championship |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Dillon Danis |170 lb |Seven-time international medalist and Black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. |Bellator |- | |style=\"text- align:left;\" | James Gallagher |145 lb |Three-time European medalist and Brown belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. |Bellator |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Hesdy Gerges |245 lb |Former World Champion in Kickboxing. |Bellator |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Patrick Holohan |125 lb |Black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. |Ultimate Fighting Championship |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Luka Jel\u010di\u0107 |155 lb |Former FFC Lightweight Champion. |Bellator |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Brad Katona |145 lb |TUF: Undefeated Featherweight Champion. |Ultimate Fighting Championship |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Sinead Kavanagh |155 lb |IMMAF: World Championships silver medalist. |Bellator |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Denise Kielholtz |125 lb |Current Bellator: Kickboxing Flyweight Champion. |Bellator |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Taylor Lapilus |135-145 lb | |Ultimate Fighting Championship |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Artem Lobov |145 lb |TUF: Season 22 runner-up. |Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Conor McGregor |145-170 lb |Former UFC Lightweight and Featherweight Champion / Former CWFC Featherweight and Lightweight Champion / Brown belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. |Ultimate Fighting Championship |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Frans Mlambo |135 lbs | |Brave Combat Federation |- | |style=\"text- align:left;\" | Brian Moore |145 lb | |Bellator |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Gunnar Nelson |170 lb |Four-time international medalist and Black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu / Black belt in G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b Karate. |Ultimate Fighting Championship |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Cathal Pendred | |Former CWFC Welterweight Champion / Blue belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. |Ultimate Fighting Championship |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | John Phillips |185 lb |Former BAMMA Middleweight Champion. |Ultimate Fighting Championship |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Peter Queally |155 lb | |Bellator |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Daniele Scatizzi |145-170 lb |Black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. |Bellator |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Richie Smullen |155 lb |TUF: Undefeated contestant. |Bellator |- | |style=\"text-align:left;\" | Charlie Ward |185 lb | |Bellator |} *Colin Maxwell ==World MMA Awards== SBG and its team members have received various recognitions from The World MMA Awards: ;Gym / Personnel * 2014 Gym of the Year (nominated) * 2015 Coach of the Year (nominated) * 2015 Trainer of the Year (nominated) * 2015 Gym of the Year (nominated) * 2016 Gym of the Year (nominated) * 2016 Coach of the Year (winner) ;Fighters * 2013 Breakthrough Fighter of the Year (nominated) * 2013 International Fighter of the Year (nominated) * 2014 Comeback of the Year (nominated) * 2014 International Fighter of the Year (winner) * 2015 Knockout of the Year (nominated) * 2015 International Fighter of the Year (winner) * 2015 Fighter of the Year (winner) * 2016 Fighter of the Year (winner) ==Gyms== While John Kavanagh's gym remains SBG Ireland's official headquarters, the association has added new branches with gyms across the country.
