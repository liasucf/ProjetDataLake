    "text": "Off Centaur Publications was the first \"commercial\" filk label. It was founded in 1980 by Teri Lee, Jordin Kare, and Catherine Cook. For a short time, Off Centaur produced high quality recordings of some of filk's best performers, and changed the course of filk music. Like many other filk labels the name was a pun (see also Wail Songs). Releases from this label are very difficult to find. At an Interfilk auction at FilKONtario, a copy of Horse-Tamer's Daughter was sold for CA$400.00. Off Centaur Publications was inducted into the Filk Hall of Fame in 1995. == Notable albums and performers == * A Wolfrider's Reflections, Songs Of Elfquest by Cynthia McQuillin, Mercedes Lackey, Leslie Fish, Julia Ecklar (1984) * Cold Iron by Leslie Fish (lyrics by Rudyard Kipling) (1983) * The Best of Chi-con IV - anthology, recorded live at the 1982 Worldcon * Minus Ten and Counting: Songs of the Space Age * Horse-Tamer's Daughter by Julia Ecklar * Singer in the Shadow by Cynthia McQuillin * Captain Jack and the Mermaid by Meg Davis * Lovers, Heroes & Rogues by Michael Longcor * On a Bright Wind by Kathy Mar (1984) * Murder, Mystery and Mayhem anthology, lyrics by Mercedes Lackey (1985) * Past Due by Bill Sutton (1986) * Rebel Yells\u2014anthology, recorded live at the 1986 Worldcon * Where No Man...\u2014a collection of Star Trek filk songs (1987) == Books == * Westerfilk Collection ==See also== * List of record labels == Notes == ==External links== * Library listing * Filk FAQ OCP catalog numbers Category:American record labels Category:Record labels established in 1980 Category:Filk music ",
