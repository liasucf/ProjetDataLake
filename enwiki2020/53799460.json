Disputes over land rights are common in Vietnam, government agencies reserve the right to seize farmland for construction and investment projects. The crisis was a rare act of defiance in Vietnam, where anger against official corruption and land seizures simmers, but is usually met with a forceful response from police. ==Cause== The incident was triggered by the \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m commune's opposition to the M\u1ef9 \u0110\u1ee9c District government assigning their land to the Viettel Group, a business firm owned and managed by the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense, for the construction of their factory complex. According to the newspaper Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Cao Tu\u1ed5i, the area of Mi\u1ebfu M\u00f4n (adjacent to \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m) served as the site of a temporary airport during the war. In 1980, following the Sino-Vietnamese War, the government of Vietnam retrieved 208 ha to build an airport there, 47.36 ha of which served as agricultural land of \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m. Because the project was not implemented, Brigade 28 of the Vietnamese Air force returned the land to \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m. In 2014, the city council of Hanoi once again returned a total of \u201428.7 ha more than the initial 208 ha\u2014to the Ministry of Defense. The people in \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m claimed 28.7 ha as part their agricultural land.N\u1ed9i dung H\u1ecdp b\u00e1o Ch\u00ednh ph\u1ee7 th\u01b0\u1eddng k\u1ef3 th\u00e1ng 4/2017, vpcp.chinhphu.vn, 4/5/2017 In 2015, the Vietnamese Ministry of Defense allocated 50 ha of this land to the Viettel Group, which included 46 ha belonging to \u0110\u1ed3ng T\u00e2m.C\u01b0\u1ee1ng ch\u1ebf \u0111\u1ea5t M\u1ef9 \u0110\u1ee9c: H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i \u0111\u1ed3ng \u00fd \u0111\u1ed1i tho\u1ea1i v\u1edbi d\u00e2n, vi.rfi.fr, 19/4/2017 ==Events== ===Villager view=== On April 15, 2017, according to a villager who spoke to the BBC, the police invited representatives of villagers involved in the land dispute to come to measure the border between the military land and the agriculture land and took the four representatives away without arrest warrants.
