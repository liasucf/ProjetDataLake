    "text": "Animation made with Animator Pro Autodesk Animator, also known as Ani Pro, PJ Paint, PJ, was a 2D computer animation and painting program in 1989 for PC with MS-DOS. The program was considered to be groundbreaking in the field of computer animation when it was initially released, and was very popular in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. == Functionality == Animator gave the ability to do frame-by-frame animation (creating each frame as an individual picture, much like traditional cel animation). Animator Studio also had tweening features (transforming one shape into another by letting the computer draw each in-between shape onto a separate frame). Animator and Animator Pro supported FLI and FLC animation file formats, while Animator Studio also supported the AVI format. Animator was particular strong in Palette based editing, effects (like Color cycling) and animations a favored technology in the time of indexed CGA and VGA graphics modes. Unlike other DOS software from that time, Animator was not restricted by the 640 kilobyte conventional memory limitation as it utilized a DOS extender by Phar Lap. Animator's combination of twenty tools multiplied by twenty inks, 3D 'optics,' unparalleled palette handling, custom fonts and many other useful features (such as its own internal scripting language POCO), put it many years ahead of better known animation tools of the time. == Development history == Animator originates back to its author's Jim Kent earlier program Cyber Paint for the Atari ST.The Antic Cyber Graphics Software and the Pre-History of Autodesk 3D Studio and Discreet 3ds max.

Jim Kent evolved in 1989 his software into Animator for Gary Yost's \"Yost Group\" for 80286 PCs with MS-DOS.jim_kent/Tesla on randelshofer.chThe First Pioneer in PC Animation: Autodesk Animator by Dr. Mussy \"October \u2013 November, marks an interesting anniversary for animation: 21 years ago, animation became available for the PC platform.\" (November 8, 2010) Animator was then licensed to Autodesk, who published the software as Autodesk Animator. === Releases === Animator was debuted at SIGGRAPH 1989,Animation Software Companies and Individuals \"At the 1989 SIGGRAPH in Boston, Autodesk unveiled a new PC based animation package called Autodesk Animator.\" by Wayne Carlson on Ohio State University featuring a VGA graphics mode of 320\u00d7200 pixels with 256 colors. In July 1991, the successor Animator Pro was released, with the significant improvement of allowing almost any resolution and color depth. The software was sold for approx. $800, significantly more expensive than the previous version, addressing the professional audience.PC Mag Aug. 1992 The 1995 released Animator Studio was a complete re-write for Windows 95, but was not anymore developed by the Yost Group. === Abandonment and legacy === Eventually development of the product ended and it became no longer supported by Autodesk.

In the debut year 1989 Animator won PC Magazine's 6th Annual Technical Excellence Award for Graphics.Graphics - Winner: Autodesk Animator \"Robert Bennett, Lewis Gartenberg, David Kalish, Jim Kent, Jack Powell, Gary Yost\" on pcmag.com (1989) Also, video game developers used the software for intros and other animated sequences in their games, for instance Formula One Grand Prix (1991, MicroProse) and Cannon Fodder (1993, Virgin Interactive). Animator Studio attempted to do more than previous versions of the program, yet it had limited success. It also lost the ergonomic fluidity that the DOS versions had. Animator Pro, though, was by far the most useful, and was exceptionally fast compared with today's animation programs. The program worked so well and had enough of an impact, that it convinced James Cameron that CGI could create a character in his next film, Terminator 2: Judgment Day; Autodesk did advertisement with this.Advertisement Autodesk Animator Pro on PC Magazine (May 26, 1992) There were also books written about Animator for instance \"Inside Autodesk Animator: The Complete Guide to Animation on a PC\" by New Riders Publishing in 1990. ==See also== * FLI/FLC Animator's file format * Deluxe Paint * List of 2D animation software == References == == External links== * * Animator (1989) Freeware download via GitHub * Gallery with examples of Animator created animations Category:2D animation software Category:Autodesk Category:1989 software Category:Formerly proprietary software Category:Freeware 3D graphics software Category:Free 3D graphics software Category:Commercial software with available source code ",
