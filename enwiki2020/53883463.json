The car started production in 1996 and ended in 2000, but it later restarted production fourteen years later in 2014. == First Generation (1990-2000) == The first generation ZZ was all styled by Tommykaira, and did not borrow any designs from other cars. The roof of the car was detachable. The ZZ sold a total of 200 units in its years of production. The same generation of ZZ was bought out by a company called Leading Edge, and was resold in the year 2002 in two models, the 190RT and 240RT. After Leading Edge's defunction, Breckland Technologies took over. They too, however, went into defunction, meaning the life of the first generation ZZ was over.
