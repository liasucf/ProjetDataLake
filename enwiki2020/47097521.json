    "text": "Carmen S\u00e1nchez Levi (7 December 1931 \u2013 13 February 2018), known as Carmela Rey, was a Mexican singer and actress. One of the last official vocalists of Agust\u00edn Lara, she became famous in the 1950s as a soloist on radio and television programs, and recorded exclusively for Musart Records and later for RCA Records. In movies, she had starring roles in A sablazo limpio (1958), Viva la parranda (1960), Las hijas del Amapolo (1962), and Escuela para solteras (1965). With her husband, singer Rafael V\u00e1zquez, she formed a duet named Carmela y Rafael, \"The Romantic Couple of Mexico\", which was hugely successful in the 1960s and 1970s. ==Life and career== Carmela Rey was born in Xalapa, the capital of Veracruz, Mexico. Her parents were Vicente S\u00e1nchez Rebolledo and Dinah Levi Rey. She took her stage name from her maternal grandmother, Isabel Rey. Carmela finished her primary and secondary school in Mexico City, and learned solf\u00e8ge, harmony, history of music, and Italian at the Conservatorio Nacional de M\u00fasica. She was also a student of the famous Mexican contralto Fanny Anit\u00faa. Rey began her career participating in recitals at Mexico City's Palacio de Bellas Artes, but she married and went abroad to live with her husband. She made a comeback singing in her own radio programs and performing at the posh Capri nightclub in Mexico City. Rey also made her television debut, and one of her TV programs remained on the air for 26 consecutive weeks. Her popularity spread to other Latin American countries, including Cuba, Colombia and Venezuela. Her great beauty and natural charm attracted the attention of film producers \u00d3scar J. Brooks and Ernesto Enr\u00edquez, who signed her for the female lead opposite Viruta y Capulina and Chilean bolero singer Lucho Gatica in A sablazo limpio (1958), a comedy set in the Spanish empire of the 18th century. Rey also made musical appearances in La mujer marcada (1957) and Mi mujer necesita marido (1959), and played one of the leading roles in Yo pecador (1959), a biopic of Mexican tenor-turned- priest Jos\u00e9 Mojica. These performances were followed by three more starring roles, in the films Viva la parranda (1960), with Miguel Aceves Mej\u00eda, Lucho Gatica and Guillermina T\u00e9llez Gir\u00f3n; Las hijas del Amapolo (1962), with Jos\u00e9 El\u00edas Moreno, Lucha Moreno, Mar\u00eda Eugenia Rubio and Ang\u00e9lica Mar\u00eda; and Escuela para solteras (1965), with Flor Silvestre, Fanny Cano, Alma Delia Fuentes, Lucha Moreno and Sara Garc\u00eda. ==Death== Rey died at around 9:00 am on 13 February 2018 in Mexico City. She was 86 years old. Her grandson revealed the cause of her death to be \"a heart attack and she was asleep, so when we found her she was in her bed; and although she suffered from hypertension this was not the cause of her death\". Her husband, who is in delicate health, was not able to attend her funeral service. Her remains were cremated on 14 February. ==Discography== * Carmela Rey con las orquestas de Jos\u00e9 Sabre Marroqu\u00edn y Enrico Cabiati (Musart M270) * Carmela Rey interpreta a Agust\u00edn Lara (Musart D369) * Carmela Rey - Agust\u00edn Lara (RCA V\u00edctor MKL-1600) * Amar y vivir (Musart 1564) * Los hits de Carmela Rey ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
