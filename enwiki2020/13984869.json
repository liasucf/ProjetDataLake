    "text": "Jean Yeuwain (c. 1566 Mons - c. 1626) was a dramatist and man of letters born in the Southern Netherlands. In 1591 he produced Hippolyte, trag\u00e9die tourn\u00e9e de S\u00e9n\u00e8que, a French translation of Seneca's Phaedra. He belonged to the middle class of Mons and probably studied at the Coll\u00e8ge de Houdain, founded in 1545 and whose buildings are today part of the Facult\u00e9 polytechnique de Mons. In 1591, he produced Hippolyte, trag\u00e9die tourn\u00e9e de S\u00e9n\u00e8que. The text that he used is doubtless the fine one edited by the Jesuit Antoine Delrio (1576). The translator takes liberties with the Latin text. Yeuwain had written other tragedies, which are all now lost. His brother, the poet Andr\u00e9 Yeuwain, preserved the manuscript of this one, available now available for consultation in the public library at Mons. == Works == * Jean Yeuwain, Hippolyte, trag\u00e9die tourn\u00e9e de S\u00e9n\u00e8que (1591), critical edition preceded by an introduction and accompanied by a literary study by Gontran Van Severen, doctor in philosophy and letters, L\u00e9on Dequesne, Mons, 1933.
