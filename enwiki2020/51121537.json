    "text": "William Adams (25 January 1864 \u2013 14 October 1913) was a lifesaver, swimmer and swimming instructor from Gorleston on the east coast of England. He made his first rescue at the age of 11 and went on to save a total of 140 lives.Ken Worpole, \"Last Landscapes: The Architecture of the Cemetery in the West\" (Reaktion Books Ltd., London, 2003) p.109 He is one of only four people to have received the Royal Humane Society bronze medal with three clasps in relation to numerous rescues from the sea at Gorleston.W.H.Fevyer and Craig P.Barclay, \"Acts of Gallantry: Volume 3\" (The Naval and Military Press, 2002) , p.60 William Adams also has the distinction of having his name appear twice in the Carnegie Hero Fund Trust Roll of Honour. He was known as \"The Hero of Gorleston Pier\" and also as \"Professor\" Adams in recognition of the expert swimming tuition he provided. ==Notable rescues and awards== William Adams developed into a highly proficient swimmer at an early age. He made his first rescue when only 11 by saving the life of a young girl who had fallen from the pier into the sea.Robert Bagshaw, \"More Memories of Norfolk\" (Geo. R. Reeve Ltd., Wymondham, 1992) p.128-131 This event marked the beginning of a lifetime of lifesaving. Adams took up employment as a tinsmith in the winter months. However, every summer he would return to his alternative occupation as a proprietor of beach huts and swimming instructor on Gorleston beach. Consequently, he was usually close at hand if a bather required assistance. He was never a member of a lifeboat crew and instead saved lives by swimming or diving to the aid of the stricken swimmer. In 1890 William Adams was the proud recipient of the Royal Humane Society's bronze medal for his bravery in rescuing a local lad named Robert Drane. He soon became well known as the \"Hero of Gorleston Pier\" and reports of his rescues appeared with great regularity in the local, national and also international press.see: Hero of Gorleston Pier: Great Yarmouth Mercury 20 September 1890 In 1896 a Norwich man called Rimmington got into difficulties whilst bathing in the sea at Gorleston. A man called Collins, from London, went to his aid but soon also found himself in danger as Rimmington panicked and clutched to him frantically. It was at this point that Adams became aware, swam to the two men and brought them both ashore together on his back. For this \"double rescue\" William Adams was presented with a row of four bathing huts. Another famous rescue occurred when Adams swam out to sea and brought safely to shore a rowing boat which contained two couples. The vessel had drifted dangerously out to sea and appeared to be unmanageable by the occupants.see: Savior of Sixty Lives: The Morning Leader, London 10 September 1900 He was honoured on numerous occasions in recognition of his outstanding life saving record. In 1906 the Mayor of Great Yarmouth presented Adams with an illuminated address. The testimonial, signed by 90 subscribers, stated that he had saved 77 lives up to that time. The 1st of two entries for William Adams in the Carnegie Hero Fund Trust Roll of Honour ==As a swimmer and swimming instructor== In 1881 the annual Gorleston Marine Regatta added a 400 yards swimming contest for a gold challenge medal and a silver cup to its programme of events. This event was won by a 17 year old William Adams and he repeated the feat in 1882 and 1883 therefore winning the gold medal outright.David Tubby, \"Great Yarmouth's Sporting Heritage: Part 1 - The Early Years\" (David Tubby, Gorleston-on-Sea, 2013) p.10 He coached some of the best swimmers of the day and gave lessons to many schools and clubs, acquiring the title of \"Professor\" Adams in the process. One young pupil who greatly benefited from the swimming tuition Adams provided was Frank Keymer, whose life Adams had saved in 1898 after a particularly perilous rescue. Subsequently, Keymer became a member of the Gorleston Swimming Club of which Professor Adams was instructor. It would seem Adams taught him well, for in an extraordinary coincidence Keymer himself saved a life in 1905.Stewart W. Adams & Dr. Ian F. Keymer, \"Brave Men, Brave Deeds (article in 'Yarmouth Archaeology', 2005) the annual publication of the Great Yarmouth & District Archaeological Society. ==Personal life== William was born in Gorleston and was the son of Gorleston Trinity House Maritime pilot Abel Adams. William married Ellen Eliza Durrant in 1884 and they brought up a family of eight children together; two daughters followed by six sons. The Great Yarmouth Mercury once recorded that the five eldest sons were all strong swimmers like their father. ==Death== William Adams died 14 October 1913 at the age of 49. Despite having been in failing health he had made his last, dramatic rescue at Gorleston beach only a month earlier. The Revd. Ritso spoke of this final act of bravery in his moving funeral address: Reading the Great Yarmouth Mercury account of the funeral it is clear that William Adams had been held in the very highest regard by his fellow townspeople: William Adams dedicated his life to life saving, using his physical strength and swimming prowess to save others. The Great Yarmouth Mercury carried an eloquent tribute: From a distance his headstone does not look any different from the others that surround it. However, on closer inspection the depiction of a man diving to the rescue of a drowning figure can be seen. The headstone bears the following inscription: ==Legacy== His name was immortalised when a road was named in his honour in 2007The life story and likeness of William Adams have been used in recent years in a number of interesting and diverse ways. He has been the subject of local history exhibitions and lectures, school assemblies, poetry, artwork and even textile design. In addition his story has been mentioned in a number of books and websites. Notably he was the subject of the 1st blue plaque to be installed in Gorleston by the Great Yarmouth Local History and Archaeological Society. This event took place on 28 May 2004 when the plaque was unveiled at his former home, 199 Bells Road, Gorleston.Compiled by Alan Hunt, \"Plaques in and around Great Yarmouth and Gorleston\" (Great Yarmouth Local History and Archaeological Society, 2013) p.32 & 33 On 11 April 2007 his name became immortalised in a road name, William Adams Way, which serves as a busy route into Gorleston. On 13 March 2018 a brand new \u00a32.2 million JD Wetherspoon pub, The William Adams, was officially opened in Gorleston by the Mayor with four generations of descendants of William Adams in attendance. The name of this local hero was chosen following a public vote. == References == == External links == * www.jdwetherspoon.com/pub-histories/the-william-adams Category:English swimmers Category:Sea rescue in the United Kingdom Category:People from Gorleston-on-Sea Category:1864 births Category:1913 deaths ",
