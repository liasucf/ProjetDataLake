It was originally produced by Edward Padula. ==Background and productions== The all-singing, all-dancing show focuses on the African-American experience with songs on such topics as tenements, slumlords, ghetto life, student protests, black power, and feminism. The music is a mixture of gospel, jazz, funk, soul, calypso, and soft rock. The show had its first staging at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. from September 15 - October 10, 1971,Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope (World Premiere), Ford's Theatre with subsequent stagings at the Locust and Walnut Street Theatres in Philadelphia. The restaged Broadway production, directed by Vinnette Carroll and choreographed by George Faison, opened to acclaim on April 19, 1972, at the Playhouse Theatre, where it ran for two months before transferring to the Edison. It had a total run of 1065 performances. In his The New York Times review of the opening night, Clive Barnes described it as \"a mixture of a block party and a revival meeting\" and wrote: \"It is the unexpected that is the most delightful. Last night at the Playhouse Theater a new musical came clapping, stomping and stamping in. It is fresh, fun and black. ...Black heroes such as Flip Wilson and Godfrey Cambridge, and even Bella Abzug and Ralph Nader are mentioned and the show makes wry mockery of the changing times and celebrates the rise of black aspiration and achievements. ...the show is full of talent working together with a cohesian rarely encountered outside the dance world.\"Barnes, Clive (April 20, 1972), \"Stage: \u2018Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope\u2019\", The New York Times. Time Magazine theatre critic T. E. Kalem also praised the show, writing: \"...all heaven breaks loose on stage. This is the kind of show at which you want to blow kisses.\" The cast included Grant, Alex Bradford, Hope Clarke, and Arnold Wilkerson.
