    "text": "HLA-DQ9 (DQ9) is a human leukocyte antigen serotype within the HLA-DQ (DQ) serotype group. DQ9 is a split antigen of the DQ3 broad antigen. DQ9 is determined by the antibody recognition of \u03b29 and this generally detects the gene product of DQB1*0303. ==Serology== {| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"left\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffffff; margin-right: 2em; border:2px #e0e0ff solid;\" |+ DQ2, DQ3, DQ7, DQ8, and DQ9 recognition of DRB1*0303 productderived from IMGT/HLA |- style=\"background:#f0f0ff\" | style=\"width:60px\" | || style=\"width:60px\" | DQ9 | style=\"width:60px\" | DQ3 || style=\"width:60px\" | || style=\"width:60px\" | ||style=\"width:60px\" | || style=\"width:60px\" | sample |- style=\"background:#f0f0ff\" | || % || % || % || %|| % || (N) |- | style=\"background:#e8e8f8\" | || 67 || 12 || || || || 2563 |- | colspan = 7 style=\"font-size:smaller\" | |- | colspan = 7 style=\"font-size:smaller\" | Alleles link-out to IMGT/HLA Databease at EBI |} The serotyping efficiency of DQ9 is poor. The recognition of DQB1*0303 by DQ9 and or DQ3 is poorest, DQ2 which recognizes a different DQB1 subgroup recognizes DQB1*0303 as efficiently as DQ3. For this reason DQ9 serotyping is a poor method of typing for transplantation or disease association prediction or study. ==DQB1*0303== (DQ9) is associated with nasal polyps, gestational diabetes, microscopic polyangiitis (Japanese). Primary linkage is with DRB1*0901-DQB1*0303 ==Haplotypes and disease== ===DQ9.2=== DQA1*0201:DQB1*0303 is associated with type I psoriasis (vulgaris), ===DQ9.3=== DQA1*0302:DQB1*0303 maybe associated with juvenile diabetes in the orient. (Chinese) Primary linkage of vitiligo is with DQA1*03-DQB1*0303. ==References== 9 9 ",
