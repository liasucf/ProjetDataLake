    "text": "The Combat League of Revolutionary National Socialists (German: Kampfgemeinschaft Revolution\u00e4rer Nationalsozialisten, KGRNS), more commonly known as the Black Front (), was a political group formed by Otto Strasser after his expulsion from the NSDAP in 1930. Strasser believed the original anti-capitalist nature of the NSDAP had been betrayed by Adolf Hitler. The Black Front was composed of former radical members of the NSDAP, who intended to cause a split in the main party. Strasser's organisation published a newspaper, The German Revolution. The Black Front adopted the crossed hammer and sword symbol which is still used by several Strasserite groupings. The organisation was unable to oppose the NSDAP effectively and Hitler\u2019s rise to power proved to be the final straw. Strasser spent the years of the Third Reich in exile, first in Czechoslovakia and later in Canada. The Strasserist wing of the NSDAP itself was eradicated in 1934 during the Night of the Long Knives in which Gregor Strasser, Otto's elder brother, was killed. == See also == * National Bolshevik Party * Socialist Reich Party * Strasserism == References == Category:1930 establishments in Germany Category:1934 disestablishments in Germany Category:Fascist organizations Category:German nationalist organizations Category:Far-right political parties in Germany Category:Organizations disestablished in 1934 Category:Organizations established in 1930 Category:Political organisations based in Germany Category:Third Position Category:Strasserism Category:Syncretic political movements Category:Neo-Nazi political parties ",
