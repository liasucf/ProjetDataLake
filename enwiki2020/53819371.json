In 2012 he got accepted to Icon Collective, an electronic music production school based in Los Angeles. He graduated after 9 months. He used Massive as a plugin to produce synths on his MacBook laptop. Musically, he is described as a bass artist with 'aggressive sound' and elements of hardstyle, dubstep, and trap. Kayzo's musical career began in 2012 when he was chosen as the winner of Insomniac's \"Discovery Project\" challenge. Winning the challenge allowed him to perform at Escape from Wonderland that year, which was also his first gig as a DJ. == Career == In 2013, he released the single \"Malfunktion 2.0\" featuring vocal duo Duelle through Borgore's record label Buygore Records. He also collaborated with Slander for the single \"Gettin Down\" and with Jordan Alexander for the single \"Recoil\". On October 21, 2014, Kayzo collaborated with Australian musician Seek N Destroy to release the single \"Crank\", which was described as a heavy metallic sound with impactful sub bass. On December 16, 2014, he released \"Fired Up\" as an EP through Firepower Records. He was featured in \"Future Sounds of EDM\", a compilation by Krewella released on Ministry of Sound. In July 2015, Kayzo collaborated with Dotcom to release \"Take a Picture\" featuring Sam King, as a free download. In December 2015, he released \"Hasselhouse\" on Steve Aoki's record label Dim Mak.
