    "text": "Bossa Nova Carnival is an album by American jazz vibraphonist Dave Pike performing compositions by Jo\u00e3o Donato which was recorded in 1962 for the New Jazz label.Prestige Records Catalog: New Jazz/Status 8200/8300 series accessed July 9, 2015 ==Reception== AllMusic awarded the album 4\u00bd stars and in the review by Alex Henderson, he states, \"Bossa Nova Carnival wasn't an exercise in knee-jerk, insincere bandwagon jumping. Pike wanted to make a meaningful, individualistic contribution to Brazilian jazz. So instead of doing exactly what Getz, Gilberto, and Charlie Byrd were doing and performing a lot of Jobim songs, he enlisted Brazilian composer Jo\u00e3o Donato. Everything on this excellent vinyl LP was written by Donato, who provides sensuous, caressing melodies that Pike and his sidemen (who include Kenny Burrell on guitar and Clark Terry on fl\u00fcgelhorn) bring a lot of warmth and sensitivity to. The music swings, but it does so in a subtle, mellow, consistently melodic fashion. Undeniably one of Pike's most essential albums\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Jo\u00e3o Donato'' # \"Samba Lero\" \u2013 4:41 # \"Sono\" \u2013 5:36 # \"Serenidade\" \u2013 5:14 # \"Carnival Samba\" \u2013 4:27 # \"Philumba\" \u2013 5:18 # \"Melvalita\" \u2013 4:02 # \"Ginha\" \u2013 3:56 # \"Sausalito\" \u2013 6:04 Note *Recorded at Van Gelder Studio in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey on September 6, 1962 (tracks 2, 4, 5 & 7) and September 7, 1962 (tracks 1, 3, 6 & 8) == Personnel == *Dave Pike \u2013 vibraphone, marimba *Clark Terry \u2013 flugelhorn (tracks 2, 4, 5 & 7) *Kenny Burrell \u2013 guitar *Chris White \u2013 bass *Rudy Collins \u2013 drums *Jose Paulo \u2013 cabasa, bandero == References == Category:1962 albums Category:Dave Pike albums Category:New Jazz Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio Category:Albums produced by Elliot Mazer ",
