    "text": "The Filth and the Fury is a 2000 British rockumentary film directed by Julien Temple. It follows the story of punk rock pioneers, the Sex Pistols, as they rose from their humble beginnings in London's Shepherd's Bush to their fall at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. It is considered a continuation of Temple's first documentary centered on the band, titled The Great Rock and Roll Swindle, but acts as an opportunity for the surviving members of the group to tell their side of the story. ==Description== The Filth and the Fury is the second movie Julien Temple made about The Sex Pistols. His first effort was The Great Rock and Roll Swindle, which was released in British cinemas on 15 May 1980. This earlier effort was heavily criticised for being too skewed towards the Pistols' manager Malcolm McLaren's version of events about the band. The Filth and the Fury tells the story from the viewpoint of the band members themselves (albeit in silhouette during their contemporary interviews). The title of the film is a reference to a headline that appeared in the British tabloid newspaper The Daily Mirror on 2 December 1976 after an interview on ITV's Today presented by Bill Grundy. The title of The Daily Mirror article was itself inspired by William Faulkner's novel The Sound and the Fury which was in turn taken from a line in Shakespeare's Macbeth. Temple's documentary narrates the rise, decline and fall of the Sex Pistols from their humble beginnings in London's Shepherd's Bush to their disintegration at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. Temple puts the band into historical context with Britain's social situation in the 1970s through archival footage from the period. This film was seen in some ways as an opportunity for the Pistols to tell their perspective of the story mostly through interviews with the surviving members of the group, footage shot during the era, and outtakes from The Great Rock and Roll Swindle. ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack to the film was released in 2002. The two-disc set contains songs by the Sex Pistols as well as music from other artists that was used in the film. ;Disc one #\"God Save the Queen (Symphony)\" #\"Shang-A- Lang\" \u2013 Bay City Rollers #\"Pictures of Lily\" \u2013 The Who #\"Virginia Plain\" \u2013 Roxy Music #\"School's Out\" \u2013 Alice Cooper #\"Skinhead Moonstomp\" \u2013 Symarip #\"Glass of Champagne\" \u2013 Sailor #\"Through My Eyes\" \u2013 The Creation #\"The Jean Genie\" \u2013 David Bowie #\"I'm Eighteen\" \u2013 Alice Cooper #\"Submission\" #\"Don't Gimme No Lip Child\" #\"What'cha Gonna Do About It\" #\"Road Runner\" #\"Substitute\" #\"Seventeen\" ;Disc two #\"Anarchy in the UK\" #\"Pretty Vacant\" #\"Did You No Wrong\" #\"Liar\" #\"EMI\" #\"No Feelings\" #\"I Wanna Be Me\" #\"Way Over (In Dub)\" \u2013 Tapper Zukie #\"Looking for a Kiss\" \u2013 New York Dolls #\"Holidays in the Sun\" #\"No Fun\" ==See also== * Sid and Nancy * The Great Rock and Roll Swindle ==External links== * * * The Sex Pistols on Film * Video of Bill Grundy's interview with the Sex Pistols * Sex Pistols fansite Category:2000 films Category:British documentary films Category:British films Category:Documentary films about punk music and musicians Category:English-language films Category:Film4 Productions films Category:Films directed by Julien Temple Category:Sex Pistols video albums Category:Sex Pistols compilation albums Category:2000 documentary films Category:Sex Pistols soundtracks Category:2000 compilation albums Category:2000 soundtrack albums Category:Film soundtracks ",
