    "text": "The Innocence Project is a television drama series created by BBC Northern Ireland and first broadcast on BBC One on 9 November 2006. The series follows the work of Professor Jon Ford (Lloyd Owen), who sets up The Innocence Project, peopled entirely by a hand-picked group of law students. They take on cases pro bono that no one else will handle, or those that have been forgotten or given up on, working for clients that would otherwise have no hope, and who have possibly been wrongly convicted. The series is based on a British version of the Innocence Project, a non-profit legal clinic in the United States. The Innocence Project fared particularly poorly for a BBC primetime drama, and received a number of negative reviews. In an unusual move for the BBC, the series was pulled from the schedules mid-run, and the final three episodes were not broadcast until over a month later. The BBC subsequently confirmed that the series would not be renewed. Notably, the series has also never been issued on DVD. ==Foundation== The first and best-known Innocence organization is based at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law of Yeshiva University. It directly serves defendants who can conclusively be proven innocent by DNA testing of evidence done after their convictions. The clinic was founded in 1992 by Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld. In addition to working on behalf of those who may have been wrongfully convicted of crimes throughout the United States, the Innocence Project performs research and advocacy related to the causes of wrongful convictions. The Innocence Project is a member of the recently formed Innocence Network, which brings together a number of innocence organizations from across the United States. As of 2012, 292 defendants previously convicted of serious crimes in the United States have been exonerated by DNA testing. Almost all of these convictions involved some form of sexual assault and approximately 25% involved murder. Dr. Michael Naughton, founder and director of the Innocence Network UK (INUK), set up the first innocence project in Britain at the University of Bristol in January 2005. Additionally, INUK has actively assisted in setting up over 30 innocence projects in British universities and referred approximately 90 cases to member innocence projects for further investigation. ==Cast== * Lloyd Owen \u2014 Professor Jon Ford * Christine Bottomley \u2014 Sarah Shawcross * Ruth Bradley \u2014 Beth McNair * Stephen Graham \u2014 Andrew Lucas * Oliver James \u2014 Nick Benitz * Luke Treadaway \u2014 Adam Solomons * Shelley Conn \u2014 Dr. Eve Walker * Andrea Lowe \u2014 Philippa Lucas * Ruta Gedmintas \u2014 Mary Jarvis * Thomas Turgoose \u2014 Darren \"Dizzy\" Littlewood * Charlotte Emmerson \u2014 Lizzie Ford ==Episodes== ==See also== *The Innocence Project, which refers to a number of non-profit legal clinics in the United States *In Justice, an American TV series with a similar premise ==References== ==External links== * * *The Innocence Project TightropePictures.com *The Innocence Project BBC.co.uk Category:2006 British television series debuts Category:2007 British television series endings Category:2000s British drama television series Category:BBC television dramas Category:British crime drama television series Category:2000s British legal television series Category:Television shows set in Manchester Category:Wrongful convictions Category:English-language television shows Category:2000s British crime television series ",
