    "text": "KRVQ-FM (104.5 FM) is a radio station that is licensed to and serves Lake Isabella, California, United States. The station is owned by Craig and Patricia Lutz, through licensee Alta Sierra Broadcasting LLC. KRVQ-FM has been silent since June 23, 2016; prior to this, it broadcast a classic rock format. ==History== The station first signed on in 1992 as KVLI-FM, the sister station to KVLI. On September 23, 2011, the station changed its call sign to KRVQ-FM and switched formats from classic hits to classic rock, branded as \"The River\". In August 2014, Robert J. Bohn and Katherine M. Bohn sold KRVQ-FM and sister station KVLI to Alta Sierra Broadcasting, LLC for $300,000. However, the transaction triggered a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) which held up the deal for three years. Calvary Chapel Costa Mesa, licensee of KWVE-FM, alleged that a time brokerage agreement (TBA) between the sellers and Alta Sierra constituted an unauthorized transfer of control because KRVQ-FM and KLVI had no staff on premises. The FCC agreed, levying an $8,000 fine against the Bohns in a consent decree. The penalty was later reduced to $6,000, and the sale closed in July 2017. On June 23, 2016, KRVQ-FM went silent. ==References== ==External links== * RVQ-FM Category:Radio stations established in 1992 ",
