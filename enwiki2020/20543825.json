    "text": "ONAR (in Greek: \u039f\u039d\u0391\u03a1), composed of Lefteris Pliatsikas and Penny Ramadani, is a renowned Greek pop rock group. The band's name seems to be a reference to the ancient Greek word \u1f44\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1 \"dream\". ==History== The band was created in 1998. In 1999, they released their first LP with songs by Lefteris and produced by renowned Greek songwriter Filippos Pliatsikas, under the title \"To ergo pou paizoun ta matia sou\". From the very first instant, the album won positive reviews. Songs such as \"Me tromazeis\", \"Hartina Fanaria\", \"Galazies Erwmenes\" became popular, making the LP golden. In 2000 they released their second album entitled \"Min petas tha se doun\", a special LP which marked the participation of Teresa Salgueiro of Madredeus in a song based on a poem by Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. Manos Ksydous, another renown Greek songwriter, also participated with two songs. This LP had a notable commercial success, as well. Their next work was released in 2003 and is titled \"Aladin, teliosan oi efxes sou\". The LP's hit song was \"Den hrostao se kanena\" (which had been pre-released as a CD single and had already become golden) with the participation of Vasilis Papakonstantinou and later an adaptation to \u03b1\u03bd old folk song called \"Istoria mou\". Other songs that stood out from this record were \"Na sai kala\", \"Posa ploia eho hasei\" and \"Fisaei sta stavrodromia tou kosmou\" (based on a poem by Tasos Livaditis). In the next three years, they released two more LPs: \"Stin akri tis gis\" and \"Pou taksideveis\" containing popular songs such as \"Mahairia twra ta filia sou\", \"Kimata tou Aigaiou\", \"Mi fevgeis\", and \"Peta psila\". In December 2006 they released their latest LP so far, titled \"Tipota den einai opos fainetai\", from which songs such as \"An m'agapas\", \"Kaseta\" (lyrics by Efstathia), and \"Perasmena mesanihta\" stood out. ==Touring and collaborations== ONAR have been touring in Greece ever since they released their first LP and they have participated in all the major festivals of Greece. They have collaborated with some of the most important representatives of the Greek pop-rock scene such as: Filippos Pliatsikas, Lavrentis Mahairitsas, Dionysis Tsaknis, Socrates Drank the Conium, Vasilis Papakonstantinou, Sakis Boulas, and Lakis Papadopoulos.
