During his refereeing career he was based in Leeds, Yorkshire, then Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and, for his final season, Middlesbrough, Yorkshire. ==Career== Kew reached the Football League linesmen's List in 1960 and was promoted to the referees List in 1966. Five years later he was selected to be senior linesman to Norman Burtenshaw for the FA Cup Final between Arsenal and Liverpool. In 1972-73 he made his mark by sending off seven players, the highest ever total at the time.Kew's (then) record card count , season 1972-73: Bob Dunning personal website. In 1974, he took charge of a FA Cup quarter-final between Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest (then in the old Division 2). Kew awarded Forest a penalty and then sent off Newcastle defender Pat Howard for his protests. Forest scored and, shortly afterwards, Newcastle fans invaded the pitch, causing the game to be suspended. After play restarted Newcastle came from behind to win the game 4-3. Following concerns that allowing the result to stand would encourage hooliganism, the FA annulled the result and ordered the tie to be replayed at a neutral venue (Goodison Park). Newcastle eventually won (again) after a replay.Newcastle v. Nottingham Forest, FA Cup quarter-final, March 1974: Toonarama website. Kew was to see Newcastle again in the Final.
