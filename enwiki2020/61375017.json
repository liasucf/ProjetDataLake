Since then, his gang lost military protection, and Prabowo allowed other preman gangs to take over Tanah Abang underground. He was dethroned after brutal fighting against Betawi and Madurese gangs, led by figures such as Bang Ucu and Abraham Lunggana. After being overthrown from the Tanah Abang underworld, he rebuilt his reputation through debt collecting and security businesses.

He was a respected figure among the migrants from East Indonesia, providing newcomers jobs, networks as well and protections. He remained in rivalry against other organized crime figures as well, including John Kei and Basri Sangaji. Since 2008, Prabowo reapproached Hercules after founding the Great Indonesia Movement (Gerindra) Party. A social organization called the Peoples Movement for a New Indonesia (GRIB) was established in 2011 by Hercules to mobilize his network of preman gangsters, local strongmen, religious vigilante groups, and ex-militia for the grassroots level political support toward Prabowo. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Indonesian Muslims Category:Indonesian occupation of East Timor Category:Indonesian people of East Timorese descent Category:21st-century criminals Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
