    "text": "Richard Allen Landes (born June 26, 1949) is an American historian and author, specializing in Millennialism. He coined the term \"Pallywood\" for what he considers the practice of staged filming of evidence against Israel for the benefit of the Palestinians. He currently serves as an associate professor in the Department of History at Boston University. Landes was the director of the now quiescent Center for Millennial Studies. Landes is the son of the late Harvard Professor of Economics and History David S. Landes. ==Israel and \"Pallywood\"== Landes is notable for views on the use of film footage related to conflicts in Israel, in particular his use of the term Pallywood (Palestinian Hollywood), which is described by Ruthie Blum, writing in the Jerusalem Post, as a term coined by Landes to refer to \"productions staged by the Palestinians, in front of (and often with cooperation from) Western camera crews, for the purpose of promoting anti-Israel propaganda by disguising it as news.\" Landes himself describes Pallywood as \"a term I coined... to describe staged material disguised as news.\" Landes cites the film of the shooting of Muhammad al-Durrah, the Gaza beach blast and Hamas's alleged exploitation of electricity shortages during the 2007\u20132008 Israel-Gaza conflict, as incidents of Pallywood.One on One: Framing the debate, Jerusalem Post He maintains two web sites: * Second Draft depicts the perceived pro-Palestinian, anti-Israeli bias in some media reports from the Middle East. * Augean Stables includes more in-depth articles about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and related issues. ==Books== * * * * * * * * ==Articles== * \u201cJews as Contested Ground in Post-Modern Conspiracy Theory\", Jewish Political Studies Review, Vol. 19, Nos. 3-4 (2007), 9-34. * \u201cEdward Said and the Culture of Honor and Shame: Orientalism and Our Misperceptions of the Arab-Israeli Conflict\u201d in Special issue of Israel Affairs, 13:4 (2007), 84-58, and in * \"Goldstone's Gaza Report, Part I: A Failure of Intelligence\", Middle East Review of International Affairs (MERIA), January 2010. * \"Goldstone's Gaza Report, Part II: A Miscarriage of Human Rights,\" Middle East Review of International Affairs (MERIA), January 2010. *Anit-Zionism:21st Century Avatar of the Longest Hatred, Fathom, Summer 2016 ==See also== *Media coverage of the Arab- Israeli conflict ==References== ==External links== * Richard Landes author's website * The Second Draft * The Augean Stables * Daily Telegraph blog * Chattopadhyay, Subhasis.
