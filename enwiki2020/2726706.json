    "text": "Eye II Eye is the fourteenth studio album by the German hard rock band Scorpions, released in 1999. It is a radical departure in that Eye II Eye is much more pop-oriented than their previous work, which alienated some fans, despite the single \"Mysterious\" reaching number 26 on the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. It is the first studio Scorpions album to feature James Kottak on drums and also the final Scorpions studio album to feature Ralph Rieckermann on bass guitar. For the first (and, thus far, only) time, Scorpions released a song recorded largely in German, namely \"Du bist so schmutzig\" (\"You are so dirty\"). ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Scorpions *Klaus Meine \u2013 lead vocals *Rudolf Schenker \u2013 rhythm guitars, backing vocals *Matthias Jabs \u2013 lead guitars, backing vocals *Ralph Rieckermann \u2013 bass, backing vocals *James Kottak \u2013 drums, backing vocals, lead vocals on 12 ;Additional musicians *Peter Wolf \u2013 keyboards and piano on \u201cA Moment in a Million Years\u201d *Michelle Wolf \u2013 backing vocals on \u201cSkywriter\u201d *Mick Jones \u2013 acoustic guitar on \u201c10 Light Years Away\u201d *Airway Allstars: Siedah Garrett, Michelle Wolf, Lynn Davis, James Ingram, Phil Perry, Kevin Dorsey \u2013 backing vocals on \u201cWhat You Give You Get Back\u201d *Herman Rarebell \u2013 drums, backing vocals on \u201cMind Like a Tree\u201d ;Production *Peter Wolf \u2013 producer, mixing of 5, 6, 14, arrangements with Scorpions *A.T., Christian Leitgeb, Paul Ericksen, Kenji Nagano \u2013 engineers *Bill Schnee \u2013 mixing *Chris Kimsey \u2013 mixing on 2 *Stephen Marcussen, Chris von Rautenkranz \u2013 mastering ==Charts== ===Album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"330px\" !align=\"center\"|Year !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"5\"|1999 |align=\"center\"|German Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|6 |- |align=\"center\"|Finnish Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|37 |- |align=\"center\"|Swiss Albums Top 100 |align=\"center\"|49 |- |align=\"center\"|French Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|50 |- |align=\"center\"|Japanese Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|84 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"440px\" !align=\"center\"|Year !align=\"center\"|Title !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|1999 |align=\"center\"|\"Mysterious\" |align=\"center\"|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks (US) |align=\"center\"|26 |- |align=\"center\"|\"To Be No. 1\" |align=\"center\"|German Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|55 |} ==References== ==External links== * Official album page * \"To Be No. 1\" video * \"A Moment in a Million Years\" video * \"What U Give U Get Back\" video Category:1999 albums Category:Scorpions (band) albums Category:East West Records albums ",
