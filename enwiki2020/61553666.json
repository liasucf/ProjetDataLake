    "text": "Snow falling in Liverpool city centre during the winter of 2010 The climate of Liverpool features a temperate maritime climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb), with relatively mild summers, cool winters and rainfall spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Since 1867, rainfall and temperature records for the city have been kept at Bidston Observatory, as well as atmospheric pressure records since 1845. However, the site closed down in 2002, and a weather station in Crosby has been used by the Met Office since. Irregular meteorological observations have been taken in the city since at least 1768, with unbroken records extending for long periods of time. This includes observations taken at the Liverpool Dock from 1768\u20131798, an unspecified location from 1772\u20131799 and West Derby from 1830\u20131859 and at other unspecified locations in the city from at least 1860 onward. Continuous observations in different areas of the city have been taken since 1830. In modern times, there have also been other stations to operate in the Liverpool area, including: Wallasey (1924\u20131993), West Kirby (1926\u20131993), Aigburth (1968\u20131993), and Liverpool John Lennon Airport (1950\u2013present) Since records began, the lowest temperature ever recorded in Liverpool is on 21 December 2010, and the highest temperature recorded is on 2 August 1990. Although, during the 2006 heat wave, a temperature of was supposedly recorded at Liverpool John Lennon Airport on 19 July 2006. The highest daily minimum temperature is reported on 4 occasions: 13 July 1926, 29 July 1948,. 1 August 1995, and 6 August 2003 and the lowest daily maximum temperature is on 20 December 2010. On average, the amount of air frost days per year is below the national average, and in winter, snow is fairly common, but heavy snow is rare. Rain is also a common occurrence in the city, but droughts can become a problem in the summer, most recently in the 2018 heat wave. == Classifications == == Temperature == The average yearly high temperature in Liverpool is and the average yearly low temperature is . The average daily mean is . === Averages === === Extremes === Due to Liverpool having an oceanic climate, extremes of temperatures are rare. Furthermore, being located close to the sea, wind chill is enhanced as a result of stronger winds as well as heat indexes being higher as a result of the higher humidity found close to bodies of water. The highest heat index reported is on 19 July 2006 and the lowest reported wind chill is on 13 December 1981. ==== Highest averages ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Period !Record mean !Year |- |Year ||| 1868, 1949, 1989 |- | Spring (March\u2013May) ||| 1893 |- | Summer (June\u2013August) ||| 1995 |- | Autumn (September\u2013November) ||| 1959 |- | Winter (December\u2013February) ||| 1988 / 1989 |- | January ||| 1916 |- | February ||| 1998 |- | March ||| 1938, 1957 |- | April ||| 2011 |- | May ||| 1919 |- | June ||| 1970 |- | July ||| 1868, 2006 |- | August ||| 1995 |- | September ||| 1895 |- | October ||| 1921 |- | November ||| 1994 |- | December ||| 2015 |} ==== Lowest averages ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Period !Record mean !Year |- |Year | || 1879 |- | Spring (March\u2013May) | || 2013 |- | Summer (June\u2013August) | || 1922 |- | Autumn (September\u2013November) | || 1905, 1952 |- | Winter (December\u2013February) ||| 1962 / 1963 |- | January | || 1881 |- | February ||| 1895 |- | March ||| 1883, 2013 |- | April ||| 1917 |- | May ||| 1923 |- | June | || 1972 |- | July | || 1954 |- | August | || 1912 |- | September | || 1952 |- | October | || 1896 |- | November | || 1915 |- | December | || 2010 |} ====Highest daily temperatures==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Period !Record temperature !Date |- | January | || 9 January 1971https://web.archive.org/web/20110709125736/http://www.pol.ac.uk/appl/hist_met/maxmonthlytemps.pdf |- | February ||| 26 February 2019 |- | March ||| 29 March 1965 |- | April ||| 14 April 1869 |- | May ||| 22 May 1918 26 May 2017 |- | June | || 6 June 1950 |- | July | || 19 July 2006 |- | August | || 3 August 1990 |- | September | || 1 September 1906 |- | October | || 1 October 2011 |- | November | || 2 November 2005 |- | December | || 8 December 1998 |} ====Lowest daily temperatures==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Period !Record temperature !Date |- | January | || 19 January 1881https://web.archive.org/web/20110709125728/http://www.pol.ac.uk/appl/hist_met/minmonthlytemp.pdf |- | February ||| 9 February 1895 |- | March ||| 1 March 2018 |- | April ||| 10 April 2003 |- | May ||| 6 May 2012 |- | June | || 1 June 2006 |- | July | || 8 July 1877https://www.wetterzentrale.de/reanalysis.php?map=1&model;=noaa&var;=2&jaar;=1877&maand;=07&dag;=08&uur;=1200&h;=0&tr;=360&nmaps;=24#mapref |- | August | || 30 August 2003 |- | September | || 20th September 1919 22 September 2012 |- | October | || 30 October 1895 30 October 2018https://www.ogimet.com/cgi- bin/gsynres?lang=en&ind;=03316&ano;=2018&mes;=10&day;=31&hora;=21&min;=0&ndays;=31 |- | November | || 29 November 2010 |- | December | || 21 December 2010 |} == Precipitation == Rainfall is fairly regular throughout the year in Liverpool, with no wet or dry season as a result of its oceanic climate. === Averages === === Extremes === ==== Lowest ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Period !Record rainfall !Year |- |Year |align=\"right\"||| 1991 |- | Spring (March\u2013May) ||| 1785 |- | Summer (June\u2013August) ||| 1995 |- | Autumn (September\u2013November) ||| 1922 |- | Winter (December\u2013February) ||| 1963/1964 |- | January ||| 1997 |- | February ||| 1932 |- | March ||| 1931 |- | April ||| 1980 |- | May ||| 2020 |- | June ||| 1925 |- | July ||| 1868 |- | August ||| 1976 |- | September ||| 1959 |- | October ||| 1922 |- | November ||| 1945 |- | December ||| 1780 |} ==== Highest ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Period !Record rainfall !Year |- |Year ||| 1792 |- | Spring (March\u2013May) ||| 1792 |- | Summer (June\u2013August) ||| 1789 |- | Autumn (September\u2013November) ||| 1773 |- | Winter (December\u2013February) ||| 1993/1994 |- | January ||| 1948 |- | February ||| 1795 |- | March ||| 1998 |- | April ||| 1998 |- | May ||| 1969 |- | June ||| 1789 |- | July ||| 1872 |- | August ||| 1956 |- | September ||| 1976 |- | October ||| 1787 |- | November ||| 1773 |- | December ||| 1790 |} == Sunshine == Records of sunshine were kept at Bidston from 1908\u20132002.
