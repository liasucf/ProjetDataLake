    "text": "Matthias Ballauff (born 13 July 1952) is a German chemist and physicist, and is a professor of physics at the Free University of Berlin. His postdoctoral research and training was directed by Paul Flory. He contributed to various areas of physical chemistry, in particular to polymer science, colloidal chemistry and nanomaterials, as well as to soft matter physics. Ballauff is particularly known for having developed new catalyst materials in the form of functionalized metallic nanoparticles dispersed in liquid phase, which can greatly speed up the reaction kinetics of organic molecules. ==Selected publications== *. *. * ==References== Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century German physicists Category:21st-century German chemists Category:Free University of Berlin faculty Category:Stanford University faculty Category:German expatriates in the United States Category:University of Bayreuth faculty Category:Humboldt University of Berlin faculty Category:Karlsruhe Institute of Technology faculty Category:Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research people Category:Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz alumni ",
