    "text": "Alive in an Ultra World is a live album by Steve Vai, recorded during The Ultra Zone world tour in 2000, and released in 2001. The songs compiled on this album were written specifically for the countries that Vai and his band were visiting. Aside from \"Devil's Food\", which is found on Vai's previous album Fire Garden, these songs were penned during long soundchecks and could not previously be found on any other album. Due to logistical complications, some songs could not be recorded in the nation they were written for. ==Track listing== All songs written by Steve Vai. ===Disc 1=== #\"Giant Balls of Gold\" \u2013 4:45 #*Song for Poland #\"Burning Rain\" \u2013 4:50 #*Song for Japan #\"The Black Forest\" \u2013 6:38 #*Song for Germany #\"Alive in an Ultra World\" \u2013 3:53 #*Song for Slovenia #\"Devil's Food\" \u2013 10:09 #*Song for The Netherlands #\"Blood and Glory\" \u2013 4:53 #*Song for the United Kingdom #\"Whispering a Prayer\" \u2013 8:45 #*Song for Ireland #\"Iberian Jewel\" \u2013 4:38 #*Song for Spain ===Disc 2=== #\"The Power of Bombos\" \u2013 5:04 #*Song for Greece #\"Incantation\" \u2013 8:53 #*Song for Bulgaria #\"Light of the Moon\" \u2013 5:47 #*Song for Australia #\"Babushka\" \u2013 6:42 #*Song for Romania #\"Being with You (In Paris)\" \u2013 6:24 #*Song for France #\"Principessa\" \u2013 5:51 #*Song for Italy #\"Brandos Costumes (Gentle Ways)\" \u2013 6:04 #*Song for Portugal #\"Maple Leaf (Japan Bonus Track)\" \u2013 2:28 #*Song for Canada ==References== Category:Steve Vai albums Category:2001 live albums Category:Epic Records live albums ",
