    "text": "==Canadian Football News in 1936== Teams were restricted to a maximum of five imports and only players who had lived in Canada for a full year could compete in the Grey Cup game. When Regina won the West, five of their imports were declared illegal by the Canadian Rugby Union (CRU). Regina offered to drop the players for the Grey Cup, but the CRU would not allow them to play for the cup. Instead, the Grey Cup was a contest between the Sarnia Imperials of the Ontario Rugby Football Union (ORFU) and the Ottawa Rough Riders of the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union (IRFU). Sarnia won their second and last Grey Cup with a powerful line-up that included future Hall of Famers Hugh (Bummer) Stirling and Ormond Beach. The Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU) was formed in August with the Winnipegs, Calgary Bronks, and the Regina Roughriders. The IRFU and WIFU adopted a two-game point series format for the playoffs. The series was played between first and second place teams. A white ball was used in games that was being played underneath floodlights in Western Canada. Intercollegiate teams stopped competing for the Grey Cup. ==Regular season== ===Final regular season standings=== Note: GP = Games Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, PF = Points For, PA = Points Against, Pts = Points {| cellspacing=\"10\" | valign=\"top\" | {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Western Interprovincial Football Union !
