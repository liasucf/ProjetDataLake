It was preceded by the detection of a hoax device nearby at Wattlebridge Road, which is believed to have been a lure meant to attract police officers and soldiers into the area. It is suspected that the New IRA or the Continuity IRA were the perpetrators. ==Reactions== Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar condemned the attack in a joint statement. In addition, MLA Arlene Foster (DUP) and MP Michelle Gildernew (SF) of Fermanagh and South Tyrone issued statements against it. ==References== Category:Attacks by Republicans since the Good Friday Agreement Category:August 2019 crimes in Europe Category:Explosions in County Fermanagh Category:History of County Fermanagh Category:Improvised explosive device bombings in 2019 Category:Improvised explosive device bombings in Northern Ireland Category:Terrorist incidents in County Fermanagh Category:Terrorist incidents in the United Kingdom in 2019 ",
