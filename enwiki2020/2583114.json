Situated in the narrow valley of the Gellone river where it meets the steep-sided gorge of the H\u00e9rault River, Saint-Guilhem-le-D\u00e9sert is essentially a medieval village located on the Chemin de St-Jacques (Way of St. James) pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostella. ==Geography== The area of the municipality of Saint- Guilhem is nearly 40km\u00b2 in area.

The town, which has retained a medieval appearance, is located on the borders of the Massif Central, in the middle valley of the H\u00e9rault, north of the department of the same name. The territory of the town lies in an intramontane zone formed by the extension of the S\u00e9ranne mountain and the Cellette mountain a few kilometers from the Garrigues of the plain of Languedoc. ===Hydrography=== It is watered by the H\u00e9rault and Verdus Rivers. The H\u00e9rault River, the Combe des Arboussets and the Poujols are the main rivers that water the town. ==History== The village has maintained its historic state. Because of its isolation, in 806 Saint Guilhem established the monastery of Gellone here. In 804, the count of Toulouse and duke of Aquitaine Guilh\u00e8m in langue d 'oc (saint Guillaume) founded at a time when the valley was virtualaly uninhabited hence considered \"desert\". The abbey was originally called The Abbey of Gellone, until after Guillaume died in 812 when it was named The Abbey of Guillaume, and then the Abbey of Saint-Guilhem after his canonization in 1066. The Abbey of Aniane, nearby, was founded around 782 by a relative of Guillaume. The abbey became a very important pilgrimage site in the middle ages due to a relic of a piece of the true cross was housed here. The town developed around the abbey. In the Middle Ages, the abbey fell within the territory of the diocese of Lodeve. During the French Revolution, the town temporarily bore the name of Verdus-le- D\u00e9sert.http://cassini.ehess.fr/cassini/fr/html/fiche.php?select_resultat=32226 ==Landmarks== * The parish church is the former abbey church of the abbey of Gellone where we find the best preserved French organ of Jean-Pierre Cavaill\u00e9. * The cloister of the abbey.
