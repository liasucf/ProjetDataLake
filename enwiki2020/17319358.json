Catsuits are a recurring costume for fictional characters in various media, as well as for entertainers, especially for use in musical performances. They are sometimes referred to as \"bodysuits\", especially in reference to a full-body suit worn by a man (although bodysuit usually refers to a legless garment); catsuit is typically used only in reference to women.Bodysuit, Dictionary.comCatsuit, Dictionary.com The catsuit has been identified as a film-maker's costume of choice for stealth.Paula Deitz, Origins of Casual Style, The New York Times, 1989-08-20 In films like Irma Vep, Les Vampires and Heroic Trio, crime and catsuits are featured together, as well as its major original use in Alfred Hitchcock's To Catch a Thief.Danger clad in a catsuit, The Age A trend of bodysuits was observed by film reviewer Alan Farrell in his book High Cheekbones, Pouty Lips, Tight Jeans, and a number of occurrences of the garb in films were mentioned - Charlize Theron in Aeon Flux, Milla Jovovich in the fourth and fifth film of the Resident Evil franchise, Carrie-Anne Moss in The Matrix, Angelina Jolie in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Kate Beckinsale in Underworld, and Raquel Welch in Fantastic Voyage.Alan Farrell, High Cheekbones, Pouty Lips, Tight Jeans, page 15, Lulu.com, 2007, The trend of leather and vinyl catsuits were identified as an attempt to redefine the gender role of women through films.Elyce Rae Helford, Fantasy Girls, page 6, Rowman & Littlefield, 2000, Theresa L. Geller described the catsuit as a part of the Hollywood tough chic paradigm in an article published in the journal Frontiers. That view was shared by Sherrie A. Inness in her book Action Chicks, which also included computer games and professional wrestling in that paradigm.Sherrie A. Inness, Action Chicks, page 72, Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, The Action Heroine's Handbook describes the catsuit as one of the three options of the first rule of thumb described in the book: \"Dress to accentuate your best physical assets\".Jennifer Worick, Joe Borgenicht and Larry Jost, The Action Heroine's Handbook, page 73, Quirk Books, 2003, Action Chicks: New Images of Tough Women in Popular Culture by Sherrie A. Inness describes catsuits as an iconic garb of female TV and film characters.Sherrie A.

Matthew Ward and Richard Howard), page 28, Hill and Wang, 1983). The cat suits that adorn the feline hybrid characters in this genre are firstly illustrating their connection to felines. On the ideological level, the costumes signify the attributes that our society has projected onto cats and that the characters embody.\"Michael Lecker, Treacherous, deviant, and submissive: female sexuality represented in the character Catwoman, Bowling Green State University In another post-modern thesis on sadomasochism in cinema Andrea Beckmann wrote, \"Cinematic SM is twisted into the non- consenting, violent realm of the unhinged that we know it is not. Fetishism is used as an excuse for a bit of titillatory semi-nudity, or to identify the villain \u2013 the man in black leather. Horror films, in particular, will happily throw in a leather catsuit or a gratuitous bondage scene to spice up a mediocre script (M Olley, Pam Hogg: Warrior queen of the catwalkT. Woodward (Ed.), The best of skin two, page 19, Richard Kasak, 1993).\"Andrea Beckmann, Deconstructing myths: the social construction of \"sadomasochism\" versus \"subjugated knowledges\" of practitioners of consensual \"SM\", University of Lincolnshire and Humberside ==References== ==Further reading== *Meredith Levande, \"Women, Pop Music, and Pornography\", Meridians: feminism, race, transnationalism, Fall 2008, Vol. 8, No. 1, Pages 293-321 *Valerie Steele, Fetish: Fashion, Sex & Power, Oxford University Press, 1996, Category:Costume design Category:Fetish clothing Category:One-piece suits Category:Topics in popular culture ",
