    "text": "\"Good Mornin'\" is the third single from the album Hourly, Daily by Australian rock band You Am I. It was released in 1996 and reached number 84 in the 1996 Triple J Hottest 100JJJ Hottest 100 1996 and number 44 on the Australian charts. Tim Rogers said the song was one of two songs that, \"Russ hadn't actually heard before we recorded them. I was talking him through it as we were recording and I think he only played it twice and that's the final take.\" Rogers said the song was inspired by AM radio stations that he would listen to in the morning while writing the album Hourly, Daily. \"Often I wake up depressed, as people do, and I found it really comforting. I could see how you could get attached to it, instead of waking up with someone next to you.\" ==Track listing== # \"Good Mornin'\" \u2013 4:12 # \"I'll Make You Happy\" - 3:29 # \"(You Must Fight To Live) On The Planet of The Apes\" - 2:59 \"I'll Make You Happy\" is a cover of the Easybeats song. \"(You Must Fight To Live) On The Planet of The Apes\" is a cover of The Mummies song and features Rusty Hopkinson on lead vocals. ==Cassingle Track listing== # \"Good Mornin'\" \u2013 4:12 # \"Soldiers (live)\" # \"Mr. Milk (live)\" # \"Cathy's Clown (live)\" \"Soldiers\", \"Mr. Milk\" and \"Cathy's Clown\" were recorded at Peter Gaudion's Jazz Lane on Thursday 13 June 1996 and were first broadcast on Triple R's live music feature 'Caught In The Act' on 2 July 1996. ==References== Category:1996 singles Category:You Am I songs Category:1996 songs Category:Songs written by Tim Rogers (musician) ",
