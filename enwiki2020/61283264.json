    "text": "Risco Ca\u00eddo is a land-form and archaeological site on the island of Gran Canaria, Spain. The site contains prehistoric cave dwellings, temples, and granaries attributed to the pre-hispanic culture of the Canary Islands. It is also considered to have been used as an astronomical observatory by Aboriginal people. In July 2019, Risco Ca\u00eddo was named as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the first World Heritage Site of the island of Gran Canaria and the province of Las Palmas and the fifth of the Canary Islands. == Critics == The inclusion of Risco Ca\u00eddo in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites has been criticized by certain sectors, such as the mathematician Jos\u00e9 Barrios who considers the lack of scientific support to really consider it an aboriginal astronomical observatory or the institutional overprotection of this enclave in front of others in Gran Canaria, such as the archaeological site of Four Doors.Los que rompen la unanimidad sobre Risco Ca\u00eddo Also the geographer Eustaquio Villalba, has called into question the existence of an astronomical observatory in Risco Ca\u00eddo. Both criticizing also that a single article (which they consider with \"little scientific base\"), written by the discoverer of the site, Julio Cuenca, has sufficed for such an international declaration.Risco Ca\u00eddo, un ejemplo de historia manipulada According to Barrios: \"there is no scientific study that supports the archaeological astronomical hypothesis\" (fundamental reason why the site was declared a World Heritage Site). It alludes that there are no astronomical markers that would ratify this theory and that there is not a single published technical report that supports any of these statements.Algunas consideraciones sobre las pol\u00edticas de protecci\u00f3n del patrimonio arqueoastron\u00f3mica de Gran Canaria: los casos de Cuatro Puertas y Risco Ca\u00eddo == References == == External links == * Official Website in Spanish. * Risco Ca\u00eddo and the Sacred Mountains of Gran Canaria Cultural Landscape UNESCO property on google arts and culture Category:UNESCO Category:Archaeological sites in Spain Category:World Heritage Sites in Spain ",
