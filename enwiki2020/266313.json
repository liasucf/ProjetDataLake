    "text": "Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (colloquially Mascot Airport, Kingsford Smith Airport, or Sydney Airport; ; ) is an international airport in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia located 8 km (5 mi) south of the Sydney city centre, in the suburb of Mascot. The airport is owned by the ASX-listed Sydney Airport Group. It is the primary airport serving Sydney, and is a primary hub for Qantas, as well as a secondary hub for Virgin Australia and Jetstar, as well as a focus city for Air New Zealand. Situated next to Botany Bay, the airport has three runways, colloquially known as the east\u2013west, north\u2013south and third runways. Sydney Airport is one of the world's longest continuously operated commercial airports and the busiest airport in Australia, handling 42.6 million passengers and 348,904 aircraft movements in 2016\u201317. It was the 38th busiest airport in the world in 2016. Currently 46 domestic and 43 international destinations are served to Sydney directly. In 2018, the airport was rated in the top five worldwide for airports handling 40\u201350 million passengers annually and was overall voted the 20th best airport in the world at the Skytrax World Airport Awards. The airport's Air Traffic Control Tower is listed on the Commonwealth Heritage List. ==History== KLM Douglas DC-8 at Gate 2 of the International Terminal in 1972 Sydney Airport Terminal 1 (international terminal) shops Sydney Airport Virgin Australia Terminal 2 Travelators at Sydney Airport Terminal 3 Control tower BA, VS & MH aircraft parked at the QF Jetbase in Sydney waiting for their afternoon flights. ===1919\u20131930: Early history=== The land used for the airport had been a bullock paddock. Nigel Love, who had been a pilot in the First World War, was interested in establishing the nation's first aircraft manufacturing company. This idea would require him to establish a factory and an aerodrome close to the city. A real estate office in Sydney told him of some land owned by the Kensington Race Club that was being kept as a hedge against its losing its government-owned site at Randwick. It had been used by a local abattoir which was closing down, to graze sheep and cattle. This land appealed to Love as the surface was perfectly flat and was covered with a pasture of buffalo grass. The grass had been grazed so evenly by the sheep and cattle that it required little to make it serviceable for aircraft. In addition, the approaches on all four sides had no obstructions, it was bounded by a racecourse, gardens, a river and Botany Bay. Love established Mascot as a private concern, leasing from the Kensington Race Club for three years. It initially had a small canvas structure but was later equipped with an imported Richards hangar. The first flight from Mascot was in November 1919 when Love carried freelance movie photographer Billy Marshall up in an Avro. The official opening flight took place on 9 January 1920, also performed by Love. In 1921, the Commonwealth Government purchased in Mascot for the purpose of creating a public airfield. In 1923, when Love's three-year lease expired, the Mascot land was compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth Government from the racing club. The first regular flights began in 1924. ===1930\u20131960=== In 1933, the first gravel runways were built. By 1949 the airport had three runways \u2013 the 11/29, the 16/34 and the 04/22. The Sydenham to Botany railway line crossed the latter runway approximately from the northern end and was protected by special safeworking facilities. The Cooks River was diverted away from the area in 1947\u201352 to provide more land for the airport and other small streams were filled. When Mascot was declared an aerodrome in 1920 it was known as Sydney Airport. On 14 August 1936 the airport was renamed Sydney (Kingsford Smith) AirportSydney Morning Herald 9 August 1938 p.12 in honour of pioneering Australian aviator Sir Charles Kingsford Smith. Up to the early 1960s the majority of Sydney-siders referred to the airport as Mascot. The first paved runway was 07/25 and the next one constructed was 16/34 (now 16R/34L), extended into Botany Bay, starting in 1959, to accommodate jet aircraft. Runway 07/25 is used mainly by lighter aircraft, but is used by all aircraft including Airbus A380s when conditions require. Runway 16R/34L is presently the longest operational runway in Australia, with a paved length of and between the zebra thresholds. ===Modern history=== By the 1960s, the need for a new international terminal had become apparent, and work commenced in late 1966. Much of the new terminal was designed by Paynter and Dixon Industries. The plans for the design are held by the State Library of New South Wales. The new terminal was officially opened on 3 May 1970, by HM Queen Elizabeth II. The first Boeing 747 \"Jumbo Jet\" at the airport, Pan Am's Clipper Flying Cloud (N734PA), arrived on 4 October 1970. The east\u2013west runway was then long;Aviation Daily 27 July 1971 in the 1970s the north\u2013south runway was expanded to become one of the longest runways in the southern hemisphere. The international terminal was expanded in 1992 and has undergone several refurbishments since then, including one that was completed in early 2000 in order to re-invent the airport in time for the 2000 Olympic Games held in Sydney. The airport additionally underwent another project development that began in 2010 to extend the transit zone which brought new duty free facilities, shops & leisure areas for passengers. The limitations of having only two runways that crossed each other had become apparent and governments grappled with Sydney's airport capacity for decades; eventually the controversial decision to build a third runway was made. The third runway was parallel to the existing runway 16/34, entirely on reclaimed land from Botany Bay. A proposed new airport on the outskirts of Sydney was shelved in 2004, before being re-examined in 2009\u20132012 showing that Kingsford Smith airport will not be able to cope by 2030. ====Curfew==== The \"third runway\", which the Commonwealth government commenced development of in 1989 and completed in 1994, remained controversial because of increased aircraft movements, especially over many inner suburbs. In 1995 No Aircraft Noise was formed to contest the 1995 New South Wales state election. The party did not win a seat in parliament, but came close in the electorate of Marrickville. It also contested the 1996 Australian federal election. In 1995, the Australian Parliament passed the Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995, which limits the operating hours of the airport. This was done in an effort to curb complaints about aircraft noise. The curfew prevents aircraft from taking off or landing between the hours of 11 pm and 6 am. A limited number of scheduled and approved take-offs and landings are permitted respectively in the \"shoulder periods\" of 11 pm to midnight and 5 am to 6 am. The Act does not stop all aircraft movements overnight, but limits movements by restricting the types of aircraft that can operate, the runways they can use and the number of flights allowed. During extreme weather, flights are often delayed and it is often the case that people on late flights are unable to travel on a given day. , fines for violating curfew have been levied against four airlines, with a maximum fine of A$550,000 applicable. In addition to the curfew, Sydney Airport also has a cap of 80 aircraft movements per hour which cannot be exceeded, leading to increased delays during peak hours. In 1998 the Federal Government agreed to separate Sydney Airport from the Federal Airports Corporation and to incorporate it as Sydney Airport Corporation and appointed David Mortimer as Chair and Tony Stuart as CEO. Its mandate was to successfully redevelop the Airport as the gateway for the Sydney 2000 Olympics, support new airlines such as Virgin and Emirates and prepare it for a $3 billion plus privatisation. In 2001 Sydney Airport was awarded World's best Airport. === Expansion === In 2002, the Commonwealth Government sold Sydney Airport Corporation (SAC), to Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd for $5.4 billion. 83 per cent of SAC is owned by MAp Airports International Limited, a subsidiary of Macquarie Group, Sydney Airport Intervest GmbH own 12 per cent and Ontario Teachers' Australia Trust own 5 per cent. SACL holds a 99-year lease on the airport which remains Crown land and as such is categorised as a Leased Federal Airport.Leased Federal Airports, Australian Government Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development (accessed 4 September 2014) Since the international terminal's original completion, it has undergone two large expansions. One such expansion is underway and will stretch over twenty years (2005\u201325). This will include an additional high-rise office block, the construction of a multi-level car park, the expansion of both international and domestic terminals. These expansions\u2014and other plans and policies by Macquarie Bank for airport operations\u2014are seen as controversial, as they are performed without the legal oversight of local councils, which usually act as the local planning authority for such developments. , some of the proposed development has been scaled back.Sydney Morning Herald. 21 April 2006 issue Sydney Airport's International terminal underwent a $500 million renovation that was completed in mid-2010. The upgrade includes a new baggage system, an extra of space for shops and passenger waiting areas and other improvements. In March 2010, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released a report sharply critical of price gouging at Sydney airport, ranking it fifth out of five airports. The report noted Sydney Airport recorded the highest average prices at $13.63 per passenger, compared to the lowest of $7.96 at Melbourne Airport, while the price of short-term parking had almost doubled in the 2008\u201309 financial year, from $28 to $50 for four hours. The report also accused the airport of abusing its monopoly power. ===Future=== In December 2011, Sydney Airport announced a proposal to divide the airport into two airline-alliance-based precincts; integrating international, domestic and regional services under the one roof by 2019. The current domestic Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 would be used by Qantas, Jetstar and members of the oneworld airline alliance while today's international Terminal 1 would be used by Virgin Australia and its international partners. Other international airlines would continue to operate from T1. In September 2012, Sydney Airport and MD CEO Kerrie Mather announced the airport had abandoned the proposal to create alliance-based terminals in favour of terminals \"based around specific airline requirements and (passenger) transfer flows\". She stated the plan was to minimise the number of passengers transferring between terminals. In June 2013 the airport released a draft version of its 2013 Masterplan, which proposes operating domestic and international flights from the same terminals using 'swing gates', along with upgrading Terminal 3 (currently the Qantas domestic terminal) to accommodate the Airbus A380. On 17 February 2014, the Australian Government approved Sydney Airport's Master Plan 2033, which outlines the airport's plans to cater for forecast demand of 74 million passengers in 2033. The plan includes Sydney Airport's first ever integrated ground transport plan. ==Terminals== Airport Map Sydney Airport has three passenger terminals. The International Terminal is separated from the other two by a runway; therefore, connecting passengers need to allow for longer transfer times. ===Terminal 1=== Terminal 1 was opened on 3 May 1970, replacing the old Overseas Passenger Terminal (which was located where Terminal 3 stands now) and has been greatly expanded since then. Today it is known as the International Terminal, located in the airport's north western sector. It has 25 gates (thirteen in concourse B numbered 8\u201337, and twelve in concourse C numbered 50\u201363) served by aerobridges. Pier B is used by Qantas, all Oneworld members and all Skyteam members (except Delta). Pier C is used by Virgin Australia and its partners (including Delta) as well as all Star Alliance members. There are also a number of remote bays which are heavily utilised during peak periods and for parking of idle aircraft during the day. The terminal building is split into three levels, one each for arrivals, departures and airline offices. The departure level has 20 rows of check-in desks each with 10 single desks making a total of 200 check-in desks. The terminal hosts eight airline lounges: two for Qantas, and one each for Etihad Airways, Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, American Express and SkyTeam. The terminal underwent a major $500 million redevelopment that was completed in 2010, by which the shopping complex was expanded, outbound customs operations were centralised and the floor space of the terminal increased to . Further renovations began in 2015 with a reconfiguration and decluttering of outbound and inbound duty-free areas, extension of the airside dining areas and installation of Australian Border Force outbound immigration SmartGates. These works were completed in 2016. ===Terminal 2=== Terminal 2, located in the airport's north-eastern section, was the former home of Ansett Australia's domestic operations. It features 16 parking bays served by aerobridges and several remote bays for regional aircraft. It serves FlyPelican, Jetstar, Regional Express Airlines, and Virgin Australia. There are lounges for Regional Express Airlines and Virgin Australia. ===Terminal 3=== Terminal 3 is a domestic terminal, serving Qantas with QantasLink flights having moved their operations from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3 on 16 August 2013. Originally, it was home for Trans Australia Airlines (later named Australian Airlines). Like Terminal 2 it is located in the north-eastern section. The current terminal building is largely the result of extensions designed by Hassell that were completed in 1999. This included construction of a 60-metre roof span above a new column-free checkin hall and resulted in extending the terminal footprint to 80,000 square metres. There are 14 parking bays served by aerobridges, including two served by dual aerobridges. Terminal 3 features a large Qantas Club lounge, along with a dedicated Business Class and Chairmans lounge. Terminal 3 also has a 'Heritage Collection' located adjacent to gate 13, dedicated to Qantas and including many collections from the airline's 90-plus years of service. It also has a view of the airport's apron and is used commonly by plane-spotters. Qantas sold its lease of Terminal 3, which was due to continue until 2019, back to Sydney Airport for $535 million. This means Sydney Airport resumes operational responsibility of the terminal, including the lucrative retail areas. ===Freight Terminals=== The airport is a major hub for freight transport to and from Australia handling approx. 45 percent of the national cargo traffic. Therefore, it is equipped with extensive freight facilities including seven dedicated cargo terminals operated by several handlers.sydneyairport.com - Facts and figures retrieved 18 June 2019 ==Airlines and destinations== ===Passenger=== ====Notes==== ===Cargo=== McDonnell Douglas MD-11F of FedEx Express taxiing to the cargo terminal at Sydney Airport; Terminal 3 is in the background ==Second Sydney airport== The local, state and federal governments have investigated the viability of building a second major airport in Sydney since the 1940s. Significant passenger growth at Sydney Airport indicates the potential need for a second airport \u2013 for example, total passenger numbers increased from less than 10 million in 1985\u201386 to over 25 million in 2000\u201301, and over 40 million in 2015\u201316. This growth is expected to continue, with Sydney region passenger demand forecast to reach 87 million passengers by 2035. On 15 April 2014, the Federal Government announced that Badgerys Creek would be Sydney's second international airport, to be known as Western Sydney Airport. Press releases suggest that the airport will not be subject to curfews and will open in phases, initially with a single airport runway and terminal. It would be linked to Sydney Airport by local roads and motorways, and by extensions to the existing suburban rail network. In May 2017 the Federal Government announced it would build (pay for) the second Sydney Airport, after the Sydney Airport Group declined the Government's offer to build the second airport. ==Traffic statistics== Terminal 1 departures concourse Terminal 2 airside Terminal 3 check-in area ===Domestic=== Sydney Airport handled over 27.5 million domestic passengers in the year ending 30 June 2019. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width= align= |+Busiest domestic routes (year ending 30 June 2019) |- style=\"background:lightgrey;\" !

The International Airport railway station is located below the International terminal, while the Domestic Airport railway station is located under the car park between the domestic terminals (Terminal 2 and Terminal 3). While the stations are part of the Sydney Trains suburban network, they are privately owned and operated by the Airport Link consortium and their use is subject to a surcharge. The trains that service the airport are regular suburban trains. Unlike airport trains at some other airports, these do not have special provisions for customers with luggage, do not operate express to the airport and may have all seats occupied by commuters before the trains arrive at the airport. State Transit operates route 400 from the airport to Bondi Junction railway station stopping at both the International and Domestic terminals and Mascot railway station. This route connects to the eastern suburbs while Transit Systems Sydney operates route 420 from Westfield Eastgardens to Burwood via both International and Domestic terminals, as well as Banksia and Rockdale railway stations. You can walk to both the International and Domestic Airports to avoid the station surcharge. For the Domestic Airport alight at Mascot Railway Station it is 1.6 km and takes around 20 minutes. For the International Airport you can walk from either Wolli Creek or Tempe Railway station. The walk from Wolli Creek is closest and is 1.8 km and takes less than 25 minutes. ===Road access=== Road exit from Terminal 1 towards the M5 motorway and Qantas Drive Sydney Airport has road connections in all directions. Southern Cross Drive (M1), a motorway, is the fastest link with the city centre. The M5 South Western Motorway (including the M5 East Freeway) links the airport with the south-western suburbs of Sydney. A ring road runs around the airport consisting of Airport Drive, Qantas Drive, General Holmes Drive, M5 East Freeway and Marsh Street. General Holmes Drive features a tunnel under the main north\u2013south runway and three taxiways as well as providing access to an aircraft viewing area. Inside the airport a part-ring road \u2013 Ross Smith Avenue (named after Ross MacPherson Smith) \u2013 connects the Domestic Terminal with the control tower, the general aviation area, car- rental company storage yards, long-term car park, heliport, various retail operations and a hotel. A perimeter road runs inside the secured area for authorised vehicles only. Sydney Airport runway and Botany Bay The Airport runs several official car parks\u2014Domestic Short Term, Domestic Remote Long Term, and International Short/Long Term. The International Terminal is located beside a wide pedestrian and bicycle path. It links Mascot and Sydney City in the north-east with Tempe (via a foot bridge over Alexandra Canal) and Botany Bay to the south-west. All terminals offer bicycle racks and are also easily accessible by foot from nearby areas. ==Accidents and incidents== * On 10 September 1920, Arthur Herbert Tattle of Wellington, New Zealand, was killed on the runway at Mascot when he was struck on the crown of his head by a plane taking off. He had come to see two friends take off on the plane and was standing on the runway in the flight path with a camera looking down at the viewfinder when he failed to notice the speed of the fast approaching plane, its height or the shouted warning from the pilot. He was driven to South Sydney Hospital where he died soon after from \"a concussion of the brain\".Sydney Morning Herald, 11 September 1920, p.13 An inquiry into the incident returned a finding of \"accidental death\" and was reported to be the first inquest in New South Wales resulting from an aeroplane accident.The Herald (Melbourne), 15 September 1920, p.10 * On 19 July 1945 a Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) bound for Manus Island failed to gain altitude after taking off from Sydney's now non-existent runway 22, struck trees and crashed into Muddy Creek, north of Brighton-Le- Sands. The aircraft exploded on impact,killing all 12 passengers and crew on board. All the victims were service personnel, five from the RAF, one from the Royal New Zealand Air Force and six from the Royal Navy.Hobbins, Peter, \"Tragedy at Mascot; Sydney's forgotten aviation disaster,\" History (Magazine of the Royal Australian Historical Society), September 2019, No.141, pp.18-21 * On 18 June 1950 a Douglas DC-3 of Ansett Airways taxiing for take-off from runway 22 for a night-time passenger flight to Brisbane, hit and partially derailed a coal train travelling on the railway line that crossed the runway. Only the co-pilot was injured. * On 30 November 1961, Ansett-ANA Flight 325, a Vickers Viscount, crashed into Botany Bay shortly after take-off. The starboard (right) wing failed after the aircraft flew into a thunderstorm. All 15 people on board were killed. * On 1 December 1969, a Boeing 707-320B of Pan Am registered N892PA and operating as Flight 812 overran the runway during take-off due to bird strikes. The accident investigation established that the aircraft struck a flock of seagulls, with a minimum of 11 individual bird strikes to the leading edges of the wings and engines 1, 2, and 3 (the two engines on the left wing and the inboard engine on the right wing). In particular, blade 14 of number 2 engine (the inboard engine on the left wing) was damaged by a single bird carcass and lost power before the decision to abandon the take-off (which occurred at or near V1 or takeoff decision speed). The aircraft came to rest beyond the end of runway 16 (now runway 16R). During the crash, number 2 engine hit the ground and was damaged. The nose and left main landing gears failed and the aircraft came to rest supported by engines 1 and 2, the nose, and the remainder of the main landing gear. There were no injuries or fatalities amongst the 125 passengers and 11 crew. The accident investigation concluded that the overrun was not inevitable. * On 29 January 1971, a Boeing 727 of Trans Australia Airlines (registered VH-TJA) and taking off as Flight 592, struck the tail of a taxiing Douglas DC-8 of Canadian Pacific Air Lines (registered CF-CPQ) that had just landed as Flight 301. The DC-8 crew misinterpreted instructions on which exit to use after landing and backtracked along the runway instead of turning off it onto a taxiway; and the tower controller cleared the 727 for take-off in the mistaken belief that the runway was clear. The 727 crew saw the DC-8 during the take-off roll then proceeded with the take-off rather than take evasive measures. The 727 was damaged in the inboard right wing and the fuselage and lost pressure in one of its hydraulic systems but managed to return and land safely; a building on the ground was struck by parts of the 727's starboard landing gear doors that fell off as it approached to land. The upper eight-and-a-half feet (about 2.6m) of the DC-8's tail fin and a corresponding proportion of the rudder were torn off. * On 21 February 1980, a Beechcraft Super King Air registered VH-AAV and operating Advance Airlines Flight 4210 took off from Sydney Airport and suffered an engine failure. The pilot flew the aircraft back to the airport and attempted to land but crashed into the sea wall surrounding runway 16/24 (now 16R/34L). All 13 people on board died in the accident.\"13 die in Sydney crash,\" Sydney Morning Herald, 22 February 1980, p.1: Air Safety Investigation Branch, Advance Airlines of Australia Beech Super King Air 200 VH-AAV Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport, New South Wales 21 February 1980, Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra, 1981 * On 24 April 1994, a Douglas DC-3 registered VH-EDC of South Pacific Airmotive had an engine malfunction shortly after take-off on a charter flight to Norfolk Island. The engine was feathered but airspeed decayed and it was found to be impossible to maintain height. A successful ditching was carried out into Botany Bay. All four crew and 21 passengers - pupils and teachers of Scots College and journalists, travelling to participate in Anzac Day commemorations on Norfolk Island - safely evacuated the aircraft. The investigation revealed that the aircraft was overloaded and the propeller was not fully feathered. * On 19 October 1994, Ansett Australia Flight 881, a Boeing 747-300 registered VH-INH operating from Sydney to Osaka, returned and landed at Sydney without the nose wheel extended. Approximately one hour after departure the crew shut down the number one engine because of an oil leak. They returned the aircraft to Sydney where the approach proceeded normally until the landing gear was extended. The landing gear warning horn began to sound because the nose landing gear had not extended. The flight crew unsuccessfully attempted to establish the reason for the warning. Believing the gear to be down, the crew elected to complete the landing, with the result that the aircraft was landed with the nose gear retracted. There was no fire and the pilot in command decided not to initiate an emergency evacuation. All passengers and crew were evacuated safely. ==See also== * Ascot Racecourse, Sydney * List of airports in Greater Sydney * List of airports in New South Wales * RAAF Station Mascot * Transport in Australia * United States Army Air Forces in Australia (World War II) ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Sydney Tower * Sydney Airport Frequency and Airway Data Category:1920 establishments in Australia Category:Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces in Australia Category:Airports established in 1920 Category:Airports in Greater Sydney Category:Airports in New South Wales Category:Bayside Council Category:Botany Bay Category:Transport in Sydney ",
