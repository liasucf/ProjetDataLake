    "text": "Paracolodon is an extinct genus of tapiroid perissodactyl belonging to the family Helaletidae. Fossils have been found in Mongolia and the Inner Mongolia region of China. ==Taxonomy== Matthew and Granger (1925) described the nominal tapiroid taxa Colodon inceptus and Paracolodon curtus from Eocene-age deposits in East Asia.Matthew, W.D., and W. Granger. 1925. New ungulates from the Ardyn Obo Formation of Mongolia with faunal list and remarks on correlation. American Museum Novitates 195: 1\u201312. Radinsky (1965) recognized two nominal species as identical and synonymized Paracolodon with Colodon inceptus.Radinsky, L.B. 1965a. Early Tertiary Tapiroidea of Asia. Bulletin of American Museum of Natural History 129 (2): 181\u2013263. Dashzeveg and Hooker (1997) assigned the nominal tapiroid species \"Helalestes\" fissus to Colodon, as C. fissus, based on similarities with inceptus.Dashzeveg, D., and J.J. Hooker. 1997. New ceratomorph perissodactyls (Mammalia) from the Middle and Late Eocene of Mongolia: their implications for phylogency and dating. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 120: 105\u2013138. On the basis of new material from the Erlian Basin in Inner Mongolia, Bai et al. (2017) recognized Paracolodon as a distinct genus from Colodon, meaning that P. fissus is a referred species of Paracolodon.Bai B, Wang Y Q, Mao F Y et al., 2017. New material of Eocene Helaletidae (Perissodactyla, Tapiroidea) from the Irdin Manha Formation of the Erlian Basin, Inner Mongolia, China and comments on related localities of the Huheboerhe Area.
