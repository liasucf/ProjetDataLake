    "text": "Christian Peder Kryssing (July 7, 1891 \u2013 July 7, 1976), commonly known as C.P. Kryssing, was a Danish collaborator with Nazi Germany during World War II. An artillery officer and an ardent anti-communist, he commanded the Free Corps Denmark from 1941 to 1942. He was not a member of the Danish Nazi party, the National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark. Kryssing became the first commander of the Free Corps Denmark June 29, 1941, but was discharged as commander on February 23, 1942, because of disagreements between him and officers in the unit who had Nazi leanings. His replacement was a pro-National Socialist Dane, Christian Frederik von Schalburg. Kryssing was then transferred to other German units, first SS Division Totenkopf and later 5th SS Division Wiking. In February 1944 he became commander of SS-Kampfgruppe K\u00fcste but resigned in June the same year because of personal issues. Kryssing was the highest ranked foreigner in Waffen-SS as a SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer. In May 1945 Kryssing surrendered to the British forces and was handed over to the Danish Police in June 1946. On October 27, 1947, he was sentenced to four years\u2019 imprisonment for his membership of Waffen-SS but was released in May 1948. His two sons, Jens Effers\u00f8e Kryssing and Niels John Effers\u00f8e Kryssing, had been killed in battle against the Red Army in 1942 and 1944. ==See also== *List SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:1891 births Category:1976 deaths Category:People from Kolding Category:Danish military personnel Category:Danish anti-communists Category:SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer Category:Danish collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Waffen-SS foreign volunteers and conscripts ",
