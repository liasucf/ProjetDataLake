    "text": "{| |} The Sky Arrow is a tandem-seat, pusher configuration, high-wing carbon fibre light aircraft that was manufactured by 3I (Iniziative Industriali Italiane). With only inches of hip room, the aircraft is considered open due to a large amount of unobstructed view from the large canopy, rear engine, and seating positions ahead of the wing. 3I entered bankruptcy proceedings in 2008, and in 2012 the design was purchased by Magnaghi Aeronautica, of Naples, Italy.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 67. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. ==Design and development== Magnaghi Aeronautica, the new owners of the design in 2012, announced that it will be upgraded with larger wing tanks, improved aerodynamics and stability, strengthened structural elements and a new avionics package. The Sky Arrow will be available as a completed certified aircraft for light sport or as a kit. A four-seat version is also planned. Magnaghi Aeronautica also intendeds to market it for government utility roles, such as border patrol, pollution monitoring and aerial surveillance, with belly- and nose-mounted sensors. The 3I Sky Arrow 600 Sport and the Magnaghi Aeronautica Sky Arrow LSA are both US Federal Aviation Administration approved special light-sport aircraft. The company also completed FAR 23 type certification for the Sky Arrow TCNS.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 154.
