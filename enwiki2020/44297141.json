The station is located in the southeast of the German state of Brandenburg in the village of Hosena, north of the village of Hohenbocka. Hosena station, the piers of the former elevated railway bridge towards Kamenz can be seen in the background The station was built in 1873 as a \u201ctower station\u201d (, a two level interchange station) on the L\u00fcbbenau-Kamenz and W\u0119gliniec (then called Kohlfurt)\u2013Ro\u00dflau railways. Remains of the railway bridge of the L\u00fcbbenau-Kamenz line still exist.Historical photograph from 1914: Hohenbocka (Hosena) station \u2013 station building with the elevated bridge L\u00fcbbenau\u2013Kamenz line in the background . == History == Historic map of Hosena rail transport hub Remains of the old Hosena station building At the beginning of April 1871, King William I and the Kingdom of Saxony signed a concession for the establishment of the Berlin- G\u00f6rlitz Railway Company (Berlin-G\u00f6rlitzer Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft), with the concession giving permission for the construction of a railway connecting Senftenberg to the Kamenz\u2013Pirna railway. The first construction work began on 1 September 1871. A treaty was contracted between Saxony and Prussia on 7 December 1871, which regulated the carrying out of construction on the L\u00fcbbenau\u2013Calau\u2013Senftenberg\u2013Kamenz route. The flat country north of Kamenz, which had few rivers, was favourable for rapid progress and the works proceeded without difficulty. The Prussian border was reached north of Hosena in 1872. A connecting line of the Cottbus-Gro\u00dfenhain Railway Company running east-west, the later Lower Silesian mainline, was put into operation on 1 June 1874 between Kohlfurt and nearby Ruhland. The Hosena railway junction became increasingly important at the beginning of the 20th century and in the 1940s. The resurgent lignite and basalt mining in the area led to an ever increasing volume of traffic. With the founding of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), the population in the area doubled on average. It is about 15 kilometres away from Hoyerswerda, which had about 70,000 inhabitants. Population growth, more intense mining operations and the establishment of industry in the Hosena area increased the importance of the station. A 7.5 km section of the L\u00fcbbenau- Kamenz railway line was built between Senftenberg and Hohenbocka (or Hosena) between 1955 and 1957 to avoid an expansion of the Niemtsch (now called Senftenberger See\u2014\"Lake Senftenberg\") open cast mine, which had been developed in the late 1930s. The new line was built from Hosena to the northwest through the village of Peickwitz and Biehlen and northeast to Brieske, where it connects with the Gro\u00dfenhain\u2013Cottbus railway at the former halt of Brieske. The old line was dismantled north of Hosena and its remains at Hosenaer station is now used as a marshalling yard for the nearby basalt quarry in Koschenberg. ===1990\u20132000 === With the end of the GDR and the onset of economic and political change, the rapid development of the station came to a halt. The decline in population growth led to cuts and changes in traffic flows. On 23 May 1998, the passenger rail services on the Hosena\u2013Kamenz section, which are the responsibly of the Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe (Upper Elbe Transport Association), were abandoned. ===Since 2000 === More closures and changes followed. Passenger rail services on the Hosena\u2013Senftenberg section were abandoned on 10 October 2005. Nevertheless, in later years the Regional- Express service between Stralsund and Hoyerswerda and the Regionalbahn between Berlin-Sch\u00f6neweide and Hoyerswerda route resumed. As a result of several construction projects in the area of the Verkehrsverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (Berlin-Brandenburg Transport Association), there was again a temporary suspension of the passenger service between Hosena and Senftenberg at the timetable change in December 2011. ==Rail services == In the 2016 timetable the following services stop at Hosena station: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
