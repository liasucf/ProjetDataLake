Perpendicular to those locations on the opposing northern side of the Piscataquog are the Grasmere General StoreGrasmere General Store is at 69 Center Street and the Grasmere Grange Hall at 86 Center Street (); the building originally served as Grasmere Village's Town Hall (according to a sign posted in front of it) and has been occupied during the last decades of the twentieth century and the first decade of the twenty-first century by Merri-Loo Community Preschool, a non-profit cooperative school established in 1968. Across Center Street from the Grange Hall is the Hillside Cemetery with a sign posted dating its establishment \"circa 1768\" as of 2011 as well as the attached Hillside United Methodist Church.
