    "text": "DTV was a series of music videos created by the Walt Disney Company and produced by Charles Braverman which premiered on May 5, 1984 by taking hit songs of the past and putting them together with various footage of vintage Disney animation, created out of the trend of music videos on cable channel MTV, which inspired the name of this series. The videos were shown as filler material on Disney Channel (as the network did not air commercials at this time), as well as being the focus of television specials. Home video collections were also released on VHS, Beta, CED Videodisc, and Laserdisc formats. After the first run of DTV, in 1989 a second series was produced known as DTV\u00b2. DTV ceased airing in the early 2000s. ==Home videos== Many of the songs listed above were released on home video, in five separate volumes. The first three volumes \"Pop & Rock\", \"Rock, Rhythm & Blues\", and \"Golden Oldies\" were released in late 1984, as part of Walt Disney Home Video's \"Wrapped and Ready to Give Promotion\". Following that, two more videos, \"Love Songs\" and \"Groovin' For a '60s Afternoon\", were released during the summer of 1985. ==Television specials== Disney aired three DTV television specials on NBC in 1986 and 1987: DTV Valentine (Feb 14, 1986), DTV Doggone Valentine (Feb 13, 1987), and DTV Monster Hits (Oct 30, 1987). All three specials had their own theme of music: DTV Valentine focused on love and romance music; DTV Doggone Valentine focused on love songs with a tribute to Disney's dog and cat characters; DTV Monster Hits was focused on Halloween-themed music and footage; and DTV Christmas focused on holiday, Season's Greetings and Christmas special music. == References == Category:Music videos Category:Disney Channel original programming Category:Disney television films Category:1984 American television series debuts ",
