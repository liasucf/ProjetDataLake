    "text": "Selim III from the Kap\u0131da\u011fl\u0131 series Konstantin Kap\u0131da\u011fl\u0131, born Konstantinos Kyzikinos (), was a Greek\u2013Ottoman court painter from the late 18th century to the early 19th century. Most of his works were created around 1789\u20131806. Kap\u0131da\u011fl\u0131's set of Ottoman sultan portraits are known as the Kap\u0131da\u011fl\u0131 series (1804\u20131806). Most of the sultans were deceased at the time of creation, and hence the faces are idealistic and imaginative. Unlike previous sultan portraits, this series housed the sultans in a frame, with additional imagery below depicting a scene from the sultan's life. This style set an example after which other 19th-century sultan portraits will follow. The series are kept at the Topkap\u0131 Palace in Istanbul. Kap\u0131da\u011fl\u0131 was commissioned by Sultan Selim III to draw engravings of Ottoman sultans. However, following Selim III's deposition in 1807, the commission was cancelled. The project resumed with John Young, who published his Series of Portraits of the Emperors of Turkey in 1815 under the reign of Sultan Mahmud II. Sultan Selim III Enthroned at a Holiday Ceremony, circa 1789 Kap\u0131da\u011fl\u0131's Sultan Selim III Enthroned at a Holiday Ceremony is one of the first oil on canvas painting by an Ottoman artist. He also experimented with three-dimensional perspectival construction, which were not common in Ottoman regions at the time (in contrast to European paintings). Dates and places of his birth and death are unknown. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Court painters of the Ottoman Empire Category:18th-century births Category:19th-century deaths Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Date of death unknown Category:Greeks of the Ottoman Empire Category:18th-century Greek painters Category:19th-century Greek painters Category:18th-century painters of the Ottoman Empire Category:19th- century painters of the Ottoman Empire ",
