He volunteered on the Robert F. Kennedy presidential campaign that year with Rosie Grier. He then enlisted in the Marines and served in Vietnam as infantry. He retired from the Marine Reserves after thirty years of service with the rank of Colonel. After his return from Vietnam in 1970, Steckel was stationed in Quantico, Virginia, where he played football for the Quantico Marines football team until 1971. He joined the USMC Reserves in 1972. ==Coaching career== Steckel then worked as an assistant football coach at the University of Colorado from 1973 to 1976. He was an assistant at Navy in 1977, then an assistant with the San Francisco 49ers in 1978. Steckel joined the Minnesota Vikings coaching staff as the receivers coach in 1979 and remained an assistant coach through the 1983 season. He was promoted to head coach of the Vikings for the 1984 season after longtime coach Bud Grant retired. As a coach with a military background, Steckel emphasized discipline.
