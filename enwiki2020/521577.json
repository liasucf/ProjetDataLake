    "text": "A cacique (Iberian ; Latin American ; ; feminine form: cacica) translates to \"King\" or \"Prince\" of an indigenous group, derived from the Ta\u00edno word kasike for the pre-Columbian tribal chiefs in the Bahamas, the Greater Antilles, and the northern Lesser Antilles. In the colonial era, Spaniards extended the word as a title for the leaders of practically all indigenous groups that they encountered in the Western Hemisphere. In Hispanic and Lusophone countries, the term also has come to mean a political boss or leader who exercises significant power in the political system known as caciquismo.Robert Kern, The caciques: oligarchical politics and the system of caciquismo in the Luso- Hispanic world. Albuquerque, University of New Mexico Press [1973] ==Spanish colonial-era caciques== Cacique comes from the Ta\u00edno word kassiquan, meaning \"to keep house\". In 1555 the word entered the English language as \"Prince\". In Ta\u00edno culture, the cacique rank was hereditary and sometimes established through democratic means. His importance in the tribe was determined by the size of his tribe rather than his skills in warfare since the Ta\u00ednos were mostly a peaceable culture. They also enjoyed several privileges for their standing: they lived in a larger rectangular hut in the centre of the village, rather than the circular huts of other villagers, and they had a special sitting place for the areytos (ceremonial dances) and the ceremonial ball game. Similar to other rulers their word was the law and they oversaw a sophisticated level of governance. Hatuey monument plaque. Tupac Amaru II, Andean kuraka or cacique who led a massive rebellion in 1781. Spaniards extended the usage of cacique to refer to leaders at the town or village level in virtually all indigenous groups in Spanish America.Murdo J. MacLeod, \"Cacique, Caciquismo\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture. Vol. 1, p. 505. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Caribbean caciques who did not initially oppose the Spanish were co-opted into being intermediaries between the Spanish and their communities, but their cooperation was transitional and most revolted, resulting in their deaths in battle or by execution.MacLeod, \"Caciques, Caciquismo\", p. 505. Two famous early colonial- era caciques are Hatuey (Cuba) and Enriquillo (Hispaniola)Ida Altman, \"The Revolt of Enriquillo and the Historiography of Early Spanish America,\" The Americas vol. 63(4)2007, 587-614. who are now national heroes in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. At the base of the monument to Hatuey the historical plaque reads: \"To the memory of Chief Hatuey, unforgettable native, precursor of the Cuban fight for freedom, he offered his life, glorifying his ideals while tormented by the flames on 2/2/1512. Monuments Delegation of Yara, 1999\". Hatuey was a historical character in the 2010 film Even the Rain. In central Mexico in the colonial era, the Spanish more successfully utilized the leaders of the much more hierarchically organized indigenous peoples to function as intermediaries in the system of colonial rule. The hierarchy and nomenclature of indigenous leadership there might survive internally within communities, but the Spaniards' designation of caciques did not necessarily correspond to the hereditary indigenous system of leadership. Elite indigenous men willing to cooperate with the colonial rule replaced those with hereditary and traditional claims to leadership.Charles Gibson, The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519-1810, Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964, p. 36. The Spanish recognized the indigenous nobility as nobles within newly established colonial system, and caciques' status along with their families was reinforced by their being allowed to hold the Spanish noble honorific don and do\u00f1a. Caciques were among the first to introduce European material culture into Indigenous communities: they built Spanish-style houses, acquired Spanish furnishings, and wore Spanish clothes. They engaged in such Spanish-style commercial enterprises as sheep and cattle ranching and the raising of silkworms. Many even owned Black slaves. They also acquired certain new privileges, such as the right to carry swords or firearms and to ride horses or mules.Horn, Rebecca. \"Caciques.\" In Dav\u00edd Carrasco (ed). The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures. Vol 1. New York : Oxford University Press, 2001. Some caciques had entailed estates called cacicazgos. The records of many of these Mexican estates are held in the Mexican national archives in a section V\u00ednculos (\"entails\").Guillermo S. Fern\u00e1ndez de Recas, Cacicazgos y Nobiliario Ind\u00edgena de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a, Mexico: Biblioteca Nacional de M\u00e9xico, 1961.S.L.

The establishment of Spanish-style town government [cabildos] was used as a mechanism to replace traditional rule. Spanish manipulation of cabildo elections.Robert Haskett, Indigenous Rulers: An Ethnohistory of Town Government in Colonial Cuernavaca. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 1991. In some areas the traditional, members hereditary lineages became office holders on the town councils.MacLeod, \"Cacique, Caciquismo\", p. 505. By the late colonial era in central Mexico, the term cacique had lost its dynastic meaning in many areas; \"cacique status could in some degree buttress a family's prestige, but it could no longer in itself be regarded as a rank of major authority.\"Gibson, The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule, p. 163. In a 1769 appeal to the Viceroy of New Spain by a cacique family for restoration of its privileges, they were enumerated: that the cacique should be seated separately from commoners at public functions; he was excused from serving in town government; he was exempted from tribute and other exactions; he was excused from Sunday worship and payments of the half real; his servants were not liable for community labor; he was exempt from incarceration for debt and his property from sequestration; he could be imprisoned for serious crime but not jailed in the public jail; the caciques' names were to be listed among the nobles in official registers; and \"all these privileges are to apply equally to the caciques' wives and widows.\" With Mexican independence in 1821, the special privileges of colonial-era caciques were abolished.Gibson, \"The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule,\" pp. 164-65. In the Andean region the local term kuraka was used as an alternative to cacique, in contrast to the rest of the Spanish Colonial Americas. After conquering the Inca Empire the Spaniards in the Peruvian viceroyalty had allowed the kurakas or caciques to maintain their titles of nobility and perquisites of local rule so long as they were loyal to the Spanish monarch. In the late eighteenth century, a massive uprising, the Tupac Amaru rebellion (1781), often called the \"Great Rebellion\", was led by Tupac Amaru II, a kuraka who claimed to be a descendant of the Inca royal line, namely to the last Emperor Thupaq Amaru. At independence in 1825, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar abolished noble titles, but the power and prestige of the kurakas was already in decline following the Great Rebellion.Cecilia M\u00e9ndez, The Plebeian Republic: The Huanta Rebellion and the Making of the Peruvian State. Durham: Duke University Press 2005, pp. 102-05. Kuraka rebellions were made since the beginning of the Spanish colonial rule, kurakas from different backgrounds and places of the Andes led uprisings on multiple occasions, being the Tupac Amaru II rebellion, which came after 250 years of colonial rule, the largest of them and the major rebellion in the history of Spain's American empire, nevertheless kuraka revolts would continue years and decades after Tupac Amaru II's uprising such as the Tupac Katari uprising or the Mateo Pumakawa insurrection made during the South American Wars of Independence. ==Caciquismo and Caudillismo== An extension of the term cacique, caciquismo (\"boss rule\") can refer to a political system dominated by the power of local political bosses, the caciques. In the post-independence period in Mexico, the term retained its meaning of \"indigenous\" leaders, but also took on a more general usage of a \"local\" or \"regional\" leader as well.John Lynch, Caudillos in Spanish America: 1800-1850. Oxford: Clarendon Press 1992, p.6.Mark Wasserman, Capitalists, caciques, and revolution: the native elite and foreign enterprise in Chihuahua, Mexico, 1854-1911. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1984. Some scholars make a distinction between caudillos (political strongmen) and their rule, caudillismo, and caciques and caciquismo.Fernando D\u00edaz D\u00edaz, Caudillos y caciques: Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna y Juan \u00c1lvarez. Mexico, 1972, 3-5. One Argentine intellectual, Carlos Octavio Bunge viewed caciquismo as emerging from anarchy and political disruption and then evolving into a \"pacific\" form of \"civilized caciquismo\", such as Mexico's Porfirio D\u00edaz (r. 1876-1911).Carlos Octavio Bunge, \"Caciquismo in Our America\" (1918), in Hugh M. Hamill, ed. Caudillos: Dictators in Spanish America. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press 1992, p. 172. Argentine writer Fernando N.A. Cuevillas views caciquismo as being \"nothing more than a special brand of tyrant\".Fernando N.A. Cuevillas, \"A Case for Caudillaje and Juan Per\u00f3n\" in Hugh M. Hamill, ed. Caudillos, p. 287. In Spain, caciquismo appeared in late 19th-century Spain and early 20th-century. Writer Ram\u00f3n Akal Gonz\u00e1lez views Galicia in northwest of Spain, as having remained in a continual state of strangulated growth over centuries as a result of caciquismo and nepotism. \"Galicia still suffers from this anachronistic caste of caciques.\"Ram\u00f3n Akal Gonz\u00e1lez, Obra Completa II, 1977, p. 111. Spanish strongman El Caudillo Francisco Franco (1892-1975) was born in Ferrol in Galicia. In the Philippines, the term cacique democracy was coined by Benedict Anderson.Benedict Anderson, 'Cacique Democracy in the Philippines: Origins and Dreams', New Left Review, I (169), May\u2013June 1988 It has been used to describe the political system where in many parts of the country local leaders remain very strong, with almost warlord-type powers.Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, Cacique Democracy' The Philippines was a colony of Spain from the late sixteenth century until the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898, when the United States assumed control. The U.S. administration subsequently introduced many commercial, political and administrative reforms. They were sometimes quite progressive and directed towards the modernization of government and commerce in the Philippines. However, the local traditional Filipino elites, being better educated and better connected than much of the local population, were often able to take advantage of the changes to bolster their positions. There is no consensus in the scholarly literature about the origins of caciquismo. Murdo J. MacLeod suggests that the terms cacique and caudillo \"either require further scrutiny or, perhaps, they have become so stretched by the diversity of explanations and processes packed into them that they have become somewhat empty generalizations\".MacLeod, \"Cacique, Caciquismo\", p. 506 ==Taino dynasty== * Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 (The Great Sun) * Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 II (The Brave) * Anacaona * Arasibo * Brizuela * Caguax * Comer\u00edo * Enriquillo * Guacanagarix * Guam\u00e1 * Guarionex * Habaguanex * Hatuey * Hayuya * Huarea * Jumacao * Loquillo * Orocobix * Urayo\u00e1n ==Notable native caciques of the Americas== * Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 I of the Taino of Puerto Rico * Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 II of the Taino of Puerto Rico * Aquiminzaque of the Mu\u00edsca of Bogot\u00e1 * Ararib\u00f3ia of the Teminin\u00f3s of Espirito Santo * Arasibo of the Taino of Puerto Rico * Atlacatl of the Pipil of El Salvador * Carlos of the Calusa * Catacora of Acora and Puno * Caguax of the Taino of Puerto Rico * Chacao of Venezuela * Correque of the Huetar of Costa Rica * Cunhambebe of the Tupinamb\u00e1s of S\u00e3o Paulo * El Guarco of the Huetar of Costa Rica * El Quib\u00edan of the Ng\u00e4be of Panama * Felipe Camar\u00e3o of the Potiguara * Garabito of the Huetar of Costa Rica * Gonzalo Mazatzin Moctezuma of Mexico * Guaicaipuro of the Teques and Caracas * Guam\u00e1 of the Taino of Cuba * Guaicaipuro of Venezuela * Guarionex of the Taino of Hispaniola * Hatuey of the Taino of Hispaniola * Idacans\u00e1s of the Muisca of Colombia * Inacayal of the Tehuelche * Jumacao of the Taino of Puerto Rico * Juan de Lebu of the Moluche of Chile * Lempira of the Lenca of Honduras * Macuilmiquitzi of the Mangue of Costa Rica * Orocobix of the Taino of Puerto Rico * Urrac\u00e1 of the Ng\u00e4be of Panama * Saguamanchica of the Mu\u00edsca of Bogot\u00e1 * Saturiwa of the Timucua * Sep\u00e9 Tiaraju of the Guarani Missions * Tamanaco of the Mariches and Quiriquires * Tibiri\u00e7\u00e1 of the Tupiniquims of S\u00e3o Paulo * Urriparacoxi of central Florida * Diriang\u00e9n of the Chorotega of Nicaragua ==See also== *Cassique *Caudillo *Gregorio de San Juan *Kuraka *Kalku *Lonko *Machi (shaman) *Gregor MacGregor, he claimed to be cacique of Poyais, a fictional Central American country. *Political boss ==Further reading== *Abercrombie, Thomas A. \"Tributes to Bad Conscience: Charity, Restitution, and Inheritance in Cacique and Encomendero Testaments of Sixteenth-Century Charcas\" in Dead Giveaways: Indigenous Testaments of Colonial Mesoamerica and the Andes, Susan Kellogg and Matthew Restall, eds.
