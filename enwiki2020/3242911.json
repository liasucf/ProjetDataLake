He was a long-time personality of the Seven Network for four decades, notably part of the Seven Sport Olympics coverage as a host for more than 20 years. He currently works at Foxtel. ==Career== Roberts' career started at Perth radio station 6PM, after a short stint as a copyboy for the Adelaide News. Roberts then travelled extensively throughout Europe for two years, before returning to Australia, where he joined Radio 3CS Colac as an announcer. In 1971, he switched to television station BCV8-TV in Bendigo as a news presenter. He later joined the Seven Network in Adelaide in 1973 as a general announcer and presenter. In 1980 Roberts was asked to be one of the commentators for the 1980 Moscow Olympics telecast after which Roberts moved to Melbourne to work for the Seven Network in Melbourne.Sandy Roberts, Yahoo!7, Retrieved 2 November 2013. In his time with the Seven Network, Roberts commentated over 700 Australian Football League (AFL) games. Roberts also commentated on NBL games, the Australian Open, the Spring Racing Carnival and many major golf tournaments. He has also been involved in the coverage of every Summer Olympic Games from Moscow 1980 to Beijing 2008, including Sydney 2000 as well as many Winter Olympic Games. Alongside Dennis Cometti, Roberts was a commentator during the famous AFL match between Sydney and St Kilda in 1993, when a pig was released onto the ground by a Sydney member with a number 4 and the nickname \"Pluga\" spray painted onto it (in reference to then St Kilda player Tony Lockett). Roberts became famous for his call of the incident saying \"There's a pig at full-forward\" In January 2005, Roberts joined Seven News Melbourne after Beverley O'Connor resigned. Outside of sports broadcasting, Roberts was an annual contributor to Seven's telecast of the Good Friday Appeal and also hosted gameshows It's Academic and The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime. Despite this impressive resume, Roberts is often remembered for his gaffe in introducing the 1981 Miss Australia, Leanne Dick as \"Leanne Cock\" during a Mount Gambier Cup meeting. (Ironically, Dick's surname after marriage is Cockerill).Geoff McClure, Just names, Sandy, The Age, 16 April 2007.
