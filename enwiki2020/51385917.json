    "text": "Pel\u00e9 is a 1977 album by the Brazilian composer and arranger S\u00e9rgio Mendes and the Brazilian footballer Pel\u00e9. It was the soundtrack for a documentary about Pel\u00e9's life. The album was Pel\u00e9's debut as a singer and songwriter. Pel\u00e9 sings on \"Meu Mundo \u00c9 uma Bola (My World Is a Ball)\" and \"Cidade Grande (Big City)\", accompanied largely by Gracinha Leporace. ==Reception== Fred Beldin reviewed the reissue of the album for Allmusic and wrote that \"...the sounds are as lilting and tropical as all of the Brazilian light jazz specialist's work, though there are a few moments of quiet brooding that are unexpected. While plenty of non-musical celebrities have embarrassed themselves with their attempts at pop stardom, Pel\u00e9's contributions are pleasant and low-key\". Beldin wrote of Pel\u00e9 and Gracinha Leporace's vocals that her \"soft, sweet tones blend smoothly with the soccer star to ensure that he never strays into discordant territory\". == Track listing == # \"O Cora\u00e7\u00e3o do Rei (The King's Heart)\" \u2013 1:35 # \"Meu Mundo \u00c9 uma Bola (My World Is a Ball)\" \u2013 4:07 # \"Memorias (Memories)\" \u2013 1:06 # \"Nascimento (Birth)\" \u2013 0:31 # \"Voltando a Bauru (Back to Bauru)\" \u2013 2:52 # \"Cidade Grande (Big City)\" \u2013 0:50 # \"Cidade Grande (Big City)\" \u2013 2:24 # \"Alma Latina (Latin Soul)\" \u2013 3:21 # \"A Tristeza do Adeus (The Sadness of Goodbye)\" \u2013 1:32 # \"A Tristeza do Adeus (The Sadness of Goodbye)\" \u2013 4:44 # \"Na Bahia (In Bahia)\" \u2013 2:43 # \"Amore e Agressao (Love and Aggression)\" \u2013 3:26 # \"Meu Mundo \u00c9 uma Bola (My World Is a Ball)\" \u2013 3:52 == Personnel == *Pel\u00e9 \u2013 vocals on \"Meu Mundo \u00c9 uma Bola (My World Is a Ball)\" and \"Cidade Grande (Big City)\" *Gracinha Leporace, Carol Rogers \u2013 vocals *Gerry Mulligan \u2013 baritone saxophone, alto saxophone *Bill Dickinson \u2013 double bass *Oscar Castro-Neves \u2013 guitar *Chico Spider \u2013 keyboards *Jim Keltner \u2013 drums *Chacal, Laudir De Oliveira, Steve Forman \u2013 percussion *S\u00e9rgio Mendes \u2013 arranger, producer *Geoff Gillette \u2013 engineer ==References== Category:1977 soundtrack albums Category:Albums arranged by S\u00e9rgio Mendes Category:Albums produced by S\u00e9rgio Mendes Category:Portuguese-language soundtracks Category:S\u00e9rgio Mendes albums Category:Atlantic Records soundtracks Category:Pel\u00e9 ",
