    "text": "Paul Michael Lyons McStay, , nicknamed the Maestro, (born 22 October 1964) is a Scottish former footballer who spent his entire career with Celtic, making his senior debut in 1982 and retiring in 1997. He captained both Scotland and Celtic at all age levels. He was capped 76 times for his country and scored nine goals. He helped Celtic win three league titles, the last in 1988. ==Club career== As a youth, McStay first came to prominence in June 1980 in a schoolboy international match when Scotland played England at Wembley. Then 15, he was the captain. He scored two goals and was awarded the Man of the Match award after Scotland ran out 5\u20134 winners. McStay signed for Celtic aged sixteen from Celtic Boys Club in 1981. He made his first team debut on 23 January 1982 in a 4\u20130 win over Queen of the South in the Scottish Cup. A week later on 30 January, he made his first league appearance in 3\u20131 win over Aberdeen at Pittodrie. He scored the third goal, taking a pass from George McCluskey, running through the Aberdeen defence and striking a left foot shot past Jim Leighton in goal. Season 1982\u201383 saw the young midfielder establish himself as a first team regular, and he picked up his first winners medal on 4 November 1982 in Celtic's 2\u20131 win over Rangers in the League Cup Final. His performances resulted in media speculation that Inter Milan were considering making a \u00a32 million bid to take him to Italy, a rumour that was emphatically dismissed by the Celtic chairman, Desmond White. McStay continued to progress at Celtic, and he scored Celtic's equaliser in the 1984 Scottish Cup Final against Aberdeen to take the match into extra time. However, Celtic had played most of the match with 10 men after Roy Aitken was sent off in the first half, and Aberdeen scored in extra time to win 2\u20131. In December 1987, during Celtic's centenary season, McStay signed a five-year contract at Celtic. He went on to enjoy his finest season, winning both the SPFA and Scottish Football Writers player of the year awards as the club won a League and Cup double in 1988. When Roy Aitken left Celtic Park in 1990, McStay was appointed club captain, a position he retained until his retirement following the 1996\u201397 season. In his time with the club, Celtic won the League title three times, the Scottish Cup four times and the League Cup once. Although the second half of McStay's career coincided with a time when Celtic performed poorly and struggled financially, in 2002 he was voted a member of Celtic's greatest ever team by the club's fans. He is also a member of the Scotland Football Hall of Fame, which honours the best players to play in Scotland and is located in the Scottish Football Museum. ==International career== In 1982 he captained Scotland to victory in the UEFA European Under-18 Championship, the only major trophy won by any Scottish national football team. He captained each of the Scotland teams from under-16 level through under-18, under-20, under-21 and senior level. McStay made his full national team debut in 1983. He represented Scotland 76 times, including appearances at two World Cups in 1986 and 1990, during a 14-year international career. McStay was also selected for two UEFA European Championships in 1992 and 1996, but withdrew from the latter because of an ankle injury. ==Personal life== In 2010, he moved to live in Sydney, Australia with his wife Anne Marie and their six children. McStay now runs Maestro Sports, a startup software company specialising in sport coaching and management. McStay attempted to raise $100,000 AUD to fund an autobiography through the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter. The project was unsuccessful, with just 24% of the funding ($24,593 AUD) pledged by the closing date. McStay's great- uncles Jimmy and Willie McStay were former Celtic captains, and his brothers Willie and Raymond also played for Celtic. Their father John worked as a scout for the club.Tributes to Celtic scout and true gent John McStay, Evening Times, 10 July 2017 One of his sons, Chris, has played football for Sutherland Sharks in Australia and for Clyde in Scotland.Sons of Celtic legends Paul McStay and Peter Grant on handling the pressure and building their own careers at Clyde, Daily Record, 22 February 2018 His nephew John (Willie's son) played with Celtic Boys Club before moving onto Motherwell under-19s and later played for Ayr United as a defenderDavid W Potter, \"And they gave us James McGrory and Paul McStay\" Retrieved 21 June 2007.Ayr United land defender McStay, BBC Sport, 16 January 2007 before becoming a Celtic academy coach.Academy Coaches, Celtic FC His cousin Jock McStay played for Raith Rovers during the 1990s, and Jock's son Jonny played at Junior level in the 2010s.Glenafton 2 Lesmahagow 1, Glenafton Athletic FC, 12 January 2019We're lovin it as Jonny decides on McKenna Park, St Anthony's F.C., 28 June 2019 ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"| Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals !App !Goals |- |rowspan=\"17\"|Celtic |1981\u201382 |rowspan=\"16\"|Scottish Premier Division |10||1||2||0|||0||0||0||0||12||1 |- |1982\u201383 |36||6||4||0|||9||1||4||0||53||7 |- |1983\u201384 |34||3||5||2||8||2||6||0||53||7 |- |1984\u201385 |32||4||7||3||2||0||5||1||46||8 |- |1985\u201386 |34||8||2||0|||2||1||2||0||40||9 |- |1986\u201387 |43||3||4||0||5||1||4||0||56||4 |- |1987\u201388 |44||5||6||0||2||0||2||0||54||5 |- |1988\u201389 |33||5||5||0|||3||0||4||0||45||5 |- |1989\u201390 |35||3||6||1||4||1||2||0||47||5 |- |1990\u201391 |30||2||5||0||5||1||0||0||40||3 |- |1991\u201392 |32||7||4||0|||0||0||2||0||38||7 |- |1992\u201393 |43||4||3||0||3||0||4||1||53||5 |- |1993\u201394 |35||2||1||0||4||0||4||0||44||2 |- |1994\u201395 |29||1||4||0|||5||0||0||0||38||1 |- |1995\u201396 |30||2||4||0||1||0||3||0||38||2 |- |1996\u201397 |15||1||4||0||1||0||1||0||21||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !515!!57!!66!!6!!54!!7!!43!!2!!678!!72 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !515!!57!!66!!6!!54!!7!!43!!2!!678!!72 |} ===International appearances=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! colspan=3 | Scotland national teamNational Football Teams profile |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- | 1983 || 4 || 0 |- | 1984 || 5 || 2 |- | 1985 || 4 || 0 |- | 1986 || 5 || 1 |- | 1987 || 8 || 2 |- | 1988 || 7 || 1 |- | 1989 || 8 || 0 |- | 1990 || 9 || 0 |- | 1991 || 3 || 1 |- | 1992 || 10 || 2 |- | 1993 || 5 || 0 |- | 1994 || 3 || 0 |- | 1995 || 1 || 0 |- | 1996 || 1 || 0 |- | 1997 || 3 || 0 |- !Total || 76 || 9 |} ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Scotland's goal tally first. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! # !!
