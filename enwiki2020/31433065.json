    "text": "Starting with the first Doc Savage story in 1933 and running throughout the pulp adventures a group of recurring characters appeared either as Doc's supporting cast or antagonists. ==B== ===Brigadier General Theodore Marley \"Ham\" Brooks=== Ham Brooks is one of the characters referred to as \"The Fabulous Five\", the primary assistants of Doc Savage, and first appears with the full name Theodore Marley Brooks. The character is presented as a Harvard- educated lawyer, holding the military rank of brigadier general, and known as a dandy. He is shown as always carrying sword cane with a blade coated with a knock-out chemical. He is also shown to love fighting with his friend \"Monk\" Mayfair. This began during World War I, when a practical joke landed Monk in a military jail. Ham had taught Monk some insulting French words, presenting them as compliments. Monk used them while speaking to a French general and got locked in the guard house. Shortly after that, Ham was framed for stealing a truckload of hams, resulting in his insulting nickname. Ham was able to defend himself, but the fact that he was never able to prove that Monk was behind this has always been a source of irritation for him. During the story \"Dust of Death\" an odd ape took a liking to Ham. He kept it due to its similarity to Monk. He named it Chemistry, to infuriate Monk. Monk often calls it \"the what- is-it\", since it looks to be either an ape, chimpanzee, gorilla or baboon, or a mixture. ====In other media==== * In the film Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze, he was played by Darrell Zwerling. * In the 1985 National Public Radio series, he was played by Art Dutch. ==L== ===William Harper \"Johnny\" Littlejohn=== William Littlejohn is one of the characters referred to as \"The Fabulous Five\", the primary assistants of Doc Savage, and first appears with the full name William Harper Littlejohn. The character is presented as geologist and archaeologist and referred to as \"Professor\". Physically he is described as tall, extremely thin, with black hair and a large nose. He wore spectacles with a magnifying lens for use in field work over his left eye, rendered sightless by a war injury. Later, Doc restored his full vision with an operation. Johnny thereafter carried the magnifying glass as a monocle suspended on a black ribbon pinned to his lapel, habitually twirling it idly by its ribbon when puzzled. Despite being shown wearing the monocle over his right (not left) eye in interior illustrations, he never did so in the stories. Within the novels, it is stated that he first met Doc Savage in a prisoner of war camp during World War I. He is the only one of Doc's aides whose military rank is never mentioned. In the book Escape from Loki by Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer, it is stated that Johnny was in Germany in a civilian capacity when the war broke out. He was arrested on not entirely falsified espionage charges. ====In other media==== *In the film Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze, he was played by Eldon Quick. * In the 1985 National Public Radio series, he was played by Kimit Muston. ==M== ===Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Blodgett \"Monk\" Mayfair=== Monk Mayfair is one of the characters referred to as \"The Fabulous Five\", the primary assistants of Doc Savage, and first appears with the full name Andrew Blodgett Mayfair. The character is presented as an industrial chemist, holding the military rank of lieutenant colonel, and physically distinct, described as resembling a great ape. He is shown to love a good brawl, beautiful women, and needling his friend \"Ham\" Brooks. The latter stretching back to World War I when Monk framed Brooks for stealing hams during World War I in retaliation to Ham playing a practical joke on him. When he maintains his Wall Street laboratory, he often boasts he has the prettiest secretary in town. A blonde, her name is Lea Aster. She's kidnapped and rescued during the adventure of The Red Skull.\"The blonde was Lea Aster, Monk's secretary. Monk was wont to boast he had the prettiest secretary in New York, and he probably did not exaggerate.\" \"The Red Skull\", Bantam Edition, page 31. In the story \"The Phantom City\", Monk purchases an odd-looking pig, described as having long legs, large floppy ears and sharp teeth, in Bustan for one qirsh.

The explanation of his nickname is also given as a result of an event during the war where he help to defend a small European village using an ancient cannon known as a \"Long Tom\". \"Long Tom, like Ham, had earned his nickname in France. In a certain French village there had been ensconced in the town park an old-fashioned cannon... In the heat of the enemy attack, Major Thomas J. Roberts had loaded this ancient relic with a sackful of kitchen cutlery and broken wine bottles, and wrought genuine havoc.

The gun is an important plot element in Violent Night. A disguised Hitler thinks he's left his fingerprints on the gun, so Nazis keep trying to steal it. In her last pulp appearance, I Died Yesterday, Pat relates, \"I turned and walked away, wondering if the miracle that Doc had been working for had happened, and I was cured of my liking for adventure, or whether it was just that I was still scared. I didn't feel scared - which was what worried me.\"I Died Yesterday, Doc Savage Omnibus 5, Bantam Books, 1988, p 407.

The character is presented in some respects as Savage's opposite number, mirroring a number of his qualities. He is stronger, more intelligent, and possesses greater emotional control than ordinary people do. And in times of concentration or stress he emits a low growl subconsciously, very similar to Savage's trilling. He is also an idealist who seeks to end problems such as war, famine, and bigotry by bringing the world under his control. Sunlight has also appeared in a few of the comic book adaptations of Doc Savage: *\"The Monarch of Armageddon\" by Mark Ellis and Darryl Banks, published by Millennium Publications in 1991.
