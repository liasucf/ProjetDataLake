It lies approximately north of Nowa Ruda, north-west of K\u0142odzko, and south-west of the regional capital Wroc\u0142aw. The village has a population of 2,540. The oldest known mention of the village comes from 1352, although it certainly existed earlier. Between 1871 and 1945 it was part of Germany. During World War II, in 1942, the Germans established a forced labour camp for Jews in the village, which in 1944 was transformed into a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, intended for Jewish women. Of about 600 imprisoned women, up to 300 died. There is a historic Church of St. Michael the Archangel and a museum in the village. ==Gallery== 2014 Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw.
