He lets daughter Ethel handle a potential purchase of the Draytons' riverfront property, whereupon she develops a romantic interest in the Draytons' son, Tom. Jim inadvertently commits money he doesn't have to his lodge's hosting a convention. At dinner, he persuades Mr. Drayton to join the lodge and pay a $2,000 admittance fee, then uses the money for his own purposes. The family runs out of patience with Jim's ways, and only daughter Sprat's disappearance brings him to his senses, at least temporarily. == Cast == *Cecil Kellaway as Jim Hilton *Helen Walker as Ethel Hilton *Mabel Paige as Miss Kent *James Brown as Tom Drayton *Patti Hale as Sprat *Kathleen Lockhart as Mary Hilton *Douglas Wood as John Drayton *Norma Varden as Mrs. Drayton *Olin Howland as Reynolds *Tom Fadden as Harvey *William B.
