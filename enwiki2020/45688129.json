The French captured her in late September 1810, only to have the British recapture her in early December. She returned to the service of the Bombay Marine, assisting the British Government and the Royal Navy in various campaigns in the East Indies and the Persian Gulf. She was still listed on the rolls of the Bombay Marine on 1 January 1828. ==Career== Aurora went into active service shortly after she was launched. Under the command of Lieutenant Conyers, she participated the Persian Gulf campaign of 1809.Low (1877), p.330. The Royal Navy and the EIC sent a large force to the Persian Gulf to force the Al Qasimi (or Joasmi) to cease their raids on British ships, particularly on the Persian and Arab coasts of the Straits of Hormuz. The operation's success was limited as British were unable to suppress permanently the strong fleets of the Al Qasimi of Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah. ===Capture and recapture=== Aurora, under the command of Lieutenant Watkins, left Bombay on 16 August 1810 on a cruise. Lloyd's List reported that the French frigates Iphigenia and Astree had captured Aurora, of 10 guns and 100 men, in October.Lloyd's List, no.4525, \u2013 accessed 12 March 2015. French records reveal that Iphig\u00e9nie, under Acting Captain Bouvet, and Astr\u00e9e captured Aurora, of 16-guns, on 20 September 1810. Both reports agree that her captors took her to \u00cele de France. The French Navy then took Aurora into service as the corvette Aurore.Winfield and Roberts (2015), p. 183. The British recaptured Aurora, and several other EIC vessels, as a consequence of their successful invasion of Isle de France in November\u2013December 1810.Low (1877), p.230. Aurora then returned to Bombay and the EIC's service. When the French captured British vessels they tried to get sailors, marines, and in the case of EIC ships, lascars, to join the French Navy. Apparently they generally had some success, particularly with Irishmen and lascars. However, in the case of Aurora, her marine detachment of 16 or 17 sepoys, recruited from among the Concanny Purwarries and serving in the Marine Battalion of the Bombay Marine, were steadfast in resisting first blandishments and then harsh treatment. ===Invasion of Java and punitive expeditions=== In 1811, the Royal Navy and the EIC combined to launch an invasion of Java. The EIC contributed several warships, including Aurora, under the command of Commander Watkins, and several East Indiamen and other transports.Low (1877), p.238. In December Aurora was in Calcutta when the news arrived that a large group of Burmese had invaded the area of Chittagong. Captain Macdonald of Aurora assembled a force consisting of Aurora and the EIC's cruisers Phoenix, Thetis, and Vestal, as well as a 900 troops. The Troops disembarked at Chittagong on 6 December, at which point the Burmese retreated.Low (1877), pp.275-76. In 1812, Palimbang was under British control, with Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles as the governor of British Java. The ex- sultan of Palimbang established a stockade a few miles up from the city. From there he intercepted supplies and threatened the new sultan. Major Mears of the Bombay Army and Captain MacDonald of Aurora sent 200 men in boats to capture the stockade. They were able to do so, though not without the loss of Major Mears.Low (1877), p.252. That same year, , , and , and a detachment of 100 men from the 48th Highlanders set out on a punitive expedition against the Sultanate of Sambas, along the Sambas River in western Borneo. Barracouta was unable to force the river defenses and the expedition retreated after she suffered some casualties.Low (1877), p.256-60. From January Aurora and some gunboats then maintained a blockade until a second punitive expedition arrived in June 1813. While she maintained the blockade, Aurora recaptured some valuable Chinese junks, and unsuccessfully chased the ship Coromandel, up the river. For the second punitive expedition against Sambas, the Royal Navy contingent consisted of , , , , , and Procris, with Captain Sayer of Leda as the senior naval officer. The EIC contributed the cruisers Malabar, Teignmouth, and Aurora, seven gunboats, the transport Troubridge, and the East Indiaman . The army contingent consisted of the 14th Regiment of Foot, a company each from the Bengal artillery and the HEIC's European Regiment, and the 3rd Bengal Volunteer Battalion. Eventually the British vessels, except the frigates, were able to cross the bar in front of the river and move towards the town of Sambas. Capturing two forts yielded over 70 brass and iron guns of mixed calibers, but the town of itself yielded little booty. The expedition was able to recapture the Portuguese brig Coromandel, which the pirates had captured the year before. British casualties from combat were relatively low, but casualties from fever and disease were high. In early 1814 the British Army officer in charge at Palimbang replaced the current sultan with the old sultan, in retirement in the interior. Raffles sent Captain MacDonald and Aurora, to investigate the situation. The old sultan was deposed and his predecessor reinstated.Low (1877), p.250; footnote. In April, the EIC put together a small force consisting of Malabar, under Captain Robert Deane, the overall naval commander, Teignmouth, Aurora, and some gunboats, and an Army contingent under the command of Major-General Miles Nightingale. On 7 June the British attacked Makassar, burning the rajah's palace. The rajah fled and the British were able to impose a new rajah. Shortly thereafter, Aurora returned to Calcutta, carrying the Army staff and several officials.Low (1877), pp.260-1. ===Incident in 1816=== Maratha raiders posed a longstanding problem for the EIC. Apparently in 1816 Aurora engaged in combat with a flotilla of these raiders, supposedly in the Bay of Bengal. The painting above shows Aurora engaging two grabs and numerous gallivats.A grab (from the Marathi gurab), was a two or three-masted ship generally found on the Malabar Coast. A gallivat was a small vessel resembling a Mediterranean felucca, and like a felucca carried a triangular sail. The problem with the Maratha navy ended with the British victory in the Third Anglo-Maratha War (1817\u201318), which brought the Maratha Empire under EIC control. ===Incident in 1817=== In January 1817 Aurora was under the command of Captain Jeakes. She was towing a large \"baghalah\", which carried treasure from Kuwait and destined for the Imaum of Muscat. As they were sailing down the Gulf, 15 \"dhows and trankies\" manned by Jaoasmi pirates attacked them, attempting to capture the baghalah. Jeakes managed by skilful sailing to maneuver Aurora to bring her guns to bear and sink many of the dhows. When Aurora and the baghalah arrived at Muscat, the Imaum presented Captain Jeakes with a valuable sword and an Arabian horse. Aurora then continued her journey onto Bombay.Low (1877), pp.239-41. ===Punitive expedition against Ras-al-Khaima=== In November 1819, the British embarked on an expedition against the Al Qasimi, led by Major-General William Keir Grant, voyaging to Ras Al Khaimah with a platoon of 3,000 soldiers. The British extended an offer to Said bin Sultan of Muscat in which he would be made ruler of the Pirate Coast if he agreed to assist the British in their expedition. Obligingly, he sent a force of 600 men and two ships. Ras Al Khaimah fell to British forces on 9 December 1819 The naval force consisted of Liverpool, , , and a number of gun and mortar boats. Captain Collier, of Liverpool, 'led the naval force. The Bombay Marine of the East India Company (EIC) contributed six armed vessels: the 16-gun Teignmouth under the command of Captain Hall, the EIC senior captain, the 16-gun Benares, the 14-gun Aurora, the 14-gun Nautilus, the 12-gun Ariel and the 12-gun Vestal.The United service magazine, Vol. 141, pp.77-81. Later two frigates and 600 men belonging to the Sultan of Muscat joined the expedition. On the army side, Major General Sir William Keir commanded some 3,000 troops in transports, including the 47th and 65th Regiments of Foot, the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment of Native Infantry, the flank companies of the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of Native Infantry and of the Marine Battalion, and half a company of Pioneers. In all, 1,645 European and 1,424 Indian soldiers ('sepoys') and marines took part in the expedition. The force gathered off the coast of Ras Al Khaimah on 25 and 26 November and, on 2 and 3 December, troops were landed south of the town and set up batteries of guns and mortars and, on 5 December, the town was bombarded from both land and sea. Collier placed Captain Walpole of Curlew in charge of the gun boats and an armed pinnace to protect the landing, which was, however, unopposed.United service magazine Part 1, pp. 711\u201315. The bombardment of the town commenced on 6 December, from landed batteries of 12 pound guns and mortars as well as from sea. On 7 December, two 24-pound cannon from Liverpool were added to the land batteries. The rout of Ras Al Khaimah led to only five British casualties as opposed to the 400 to 1000 casualties reportedly suffered by the Al Qasimi. Following the fall of Ras Al Khaimah, the Aurora, together with Curlew and Nautilus, were sent to blockade Rams to the North and this, too was found to be deserted and its inhabitants retired to the 'impregnable' hill-top fort of Dhayah. Following a three-day bombardment, Dhayah Fort surrendered on 22 December. The British expeditionary force then blew up the town of Ras Al Khaimah and established a garrison there of 800 sepoys and artillery, before visiting Jazirat Al Hamra, which was found to be deserted. They went on to destroy the fortifications and larger vessels of Umm Al Qawain, Ajman, Fasht, Sharjah, Abu Hail, and Dubai. Ten vessels that had taken shelter in Bahrain were also destroyed. The Royal Navy suffered no casualties during the action.United service magazine Part 1, pp. 711\u201315. ==Fate== The last readily available online mention of Aurora notes that she was still listed as serving the Bombay Marine on 1 January 1828.Low (1877), p.479. ==Notes, citations and references== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===References=== *Colledge, J.J.
