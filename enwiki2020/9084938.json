The Deere company briefly experimented with building its own tractor models, the most successful of which was the Dain All-Wheel-Drive. ==Dain All-Wheel Drive== The Dain All- Wheel Drive was the first tractor produced by John Deere, and had only a single rear wheel. In 1911, Deere purchased the Dain Manufacturing Company of Ottumwa, Iowa. The next year, Deere decided to design its own tractor, and Dain founder Joseph Dain Sr., was directed to design that tractor. After several prototypes, the design was finalized in 1917, and 100 production units were ordered. By 1919 when that production run was complete, Deere had purchased the Waterloo Boy company. Although the Dain AWD was ahead of its time, with features such as a shift-on-the-fly transmission, Deere halted production in late 1919, partly because the cost of the Dain tractor was double that of the Waterloo Boy, and partly because of the death of Dain Sr. ==Waterloo Boy== Waterloo Boy tractor The predecessor of Waterloo Boy came about in 1892. It was made by thresherman John Froelich. It is called the Froelich tractor. Scale Models of Dyersville, Iowa made a 1/16 scale toy of this tractor. In March 1918 Deere & Company decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company which manufactured the popular Waterloo Boy tractor at its facilities in Waterloo, Iowa. Deere & Company continued to sell tractors under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923. ==Model D (Spoker Model D)== John Deere model D tractor Despite a rather severe farm economy depression at the time, Deere management decided to build a Model D prototype in 1923, designed by Muir L. Frey (father of Ford Mustang designer Donald N. Frey). The Deere Model D was produced from March 1, 1923 to July 3, 1953, the longest production span of all the two-cylinder John Deere tractors. Over 160,000 were made.Placard at Western Development Museum display. The first Model D rode on steel wheels with a (later ) two-cylinder hand-cranked engine rated .Placard at Western Development Museum display. It was not, however, the first tractor to bear the Deere name - as a number of Deere experimental tractors, and the John Deere Dain \"All Wheel Drive\" tractor (of which approximately 100 were produced during 1918 and 1919) had all carried the Deere name before the D. By 1925, the company realized the standard Model D did not meet customers' needs for industrial applications. Steel wheels were not suitable for hard surfaces, and the gearing was too slow for safe road speeds. Solid rubber tires were added, and engineers fitted a 28-tooth sprocket to the final drive, giving a road speed of . The company replaced the two-cylinder engine with a . In 1926, Deere advertised the model as the \"John Deere Industrial Tractor\" with 40 \u00d7 b inch rear wheels and fronts with solid tires. This became known as the \"DI\". Options also included wheel weights.Rukes, B. - John Deere Industrials. - ==GP tractor== On June 20, 1928, the model designation was changed from \"C\" to \"GP\" to avoid confusion with the \"D\" when dealers were phoning in orders to the factory. \"GP\" stands for \"General Purpose\". This new model GP had the same horsepower, engine displacement, weight and three-speed transmission as the model C. The GP's first serial number was 200211 . In 1930, the GP was updated with a 25-horsepower, 339 cubic-inch engine. The John Deere model GP was built in five distinct versions through the course of its production: * The standard- front GP, or John Deere Standard, built from March 1928 to February 1935. * The John Deere two-wheel tricycle-front GP, or GP-tricycle, of which twenty- three units were built between August 1928 and April 1929 * The John Deere GP wide-tread, or GPWT, built from November 1929 to November 1933 * The John Deere GP wide-tread Series P, a GPWT with narrowed rear tread width designed to suit potato rows, built between January and August 1930. * The John Deere General Purpose orchard tractor, or \"GPO\", from April 1931 to April 1935. This tractor had specialized shielding for groves and orchards and around low- hanging branches. Some GPOs were fitted with crawler undercarriages from the Lindeman Brothers in Yakima, Washington. These are commonly known as \"GPO Lindemans\". The John Deere Model A came off the assembly line in April 1934. The tractor was 25 hp, was 309 CID and had a four-speed transmission. There were eight different model A variations. Some of these were tricycle, hi-crop, orchard, single front tire and industrial models. The tricycle wheel design, patterned after that of the Farmall tractor, reduced steering effort and greatly increased maneuverability. The Model B was introduced in June 1934. This tractor had a shorter frame than the Model A, but it was eventually lengthened so it could use some of the same equipment that the larger models A and G used. There were also eight different Model B tractor variations, the same as the larger Model A. The much larger G model arrived in 1937. It was fitted with a 36-horsepower, 425-cubic-inch engine and a four-speed transmission. John Deere publicized the G as a three-plow tractor and it was built until 1941 when the GM (G, Modernized) replaced it. The GM model was made from 1942 to 1947. The power was increased to 38 horsepower and a new six-speed transmission was also added. The G model got a restyled front at this point as did the other John Deere tractor models. The GM had electric starting and lighting added to it options. During its production time the G tractor was available as a hi-crop, single front wheel and styled. ==Unstyled row crop tractors== Deere made their first unstyled rowcrop tractor in 1929 to compete with the Farmall. It was a modified GP tractor with adjustable rear axle track (distance between wheels on the same axle) and a narrow front end. In 1933 Deere started experimenting with what would come to be known as the Model A. The new model A went into production in 1934. The A launched Deere into the rowcrop farming market. The A was by far the most popular two- cylinder tractor that Deere produced. The next year the Model B was introduced. It was one third smaller than the A which made it ideal for smaller farms. A few years later, the Model G was introduced in 1937. It remained unstyled for several more years than the A and B. The unstyled tractors launched Deere into the rowcrop farming market which they are still a major part of today. The Deere company very nearly went bankrupt in the Great Depression. Only a large order of tractors for the Soviet Union kept the company going. ==Streamlined look== In 1937 John Deere hired well known industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss from New York City to re-style Deere's agricultural equipment, especially its tractors. In the fall of 1937, a Deere tractor engineer was sent to New York to ask Dreyfuss to redesign the tractors. Legend has it that Dreyfuss was so intrigued by the project that he took a train to Waterloo that very night. Dreyfuss learned to operate the tractors and worked with them in the field to gain firsthand knowledge of the changes that needed to be made. The first two letter series tractors (the A and B) were the first to receive the new modern styling, and other models were added later. The Dreyfuss styling was intended to help John Deere compete with the forthcoming Farmall \"letter series\" of tractors, which, along with the Ford-Ferguson, were John Deere's largest competition at this time. Dreyfuss and the Waterloo engineers perfected the styled design that was used on all John Deere tractors with only minor changes through 1959. The 1930s and 1940s saw a large number of different John Deere models emerge, as small farmers emerging from their Depression troubles increasingly turned from horses to tractors. John Deere's GM model was introduced in 1942, and was made until 1947. Power was increased to 38 hp and a new six-speed transmission was also added. The G model got a restyled front at this point as did the other John Deere tractors models. The GM had electric start and lights added to its options. During its production time the G tractor was available in hi-crop and single front wheel versions. The G was restyled in 1941 but did not start to roll off the assembly line until early 1942. Like the smaller A and B tractors the G model had the six-speed transmission added to it. In 1946, the 1946 model \"D\" had a 501-cubic-inch engine, which was enormous for the day. Two new additions to the tractor line, the M and R models, were also added. John Deere model M Tractor After the models A and B got new styling, both tractors were given six-speed transmissions in late 1940. The A was 29 hp out of a 321 CID engine while the smaller B was both 18 and 23 hp reflecting the earlier and later updates between 1938 and 46. The 14.84 model H was given the Dreyfuss look from the time it was introduced in 1938. The H broke a fuel economy record when it was tested in Nebraska. This tractor also had three variations that came out in 1940-'41. The H tractor was 14.84 horsepower out of a 90 CID engine and had a three-speed transmission. Model AW (1947-52, late styled) in original condition, Gulgong museum, NSW Australia In 1939, the restyled model D appeared. The D was a 42 hp tractor, and weighed 5,300 pounds. Options available on this tractor included electric lighting and starting. In August 1940 John Deere introduced the new model LA which was followed by the model LI. The LA had a 77 CID engine with 14 belt horsepower. The John Deere G tractor was restyled in 1941 but did not start to roll off the assembly line until early 1942. Like the smaller A/B tractors the G model also had the 6-speed transmission, but also featured electric lights and electric start. In 1947, John Deere opened a new tractor factory in Dubuque, Iowa, built to produce the John Deere M. The M was created to address the increasing demand for small tractors and compete with the increasingly popular Ford and the smaller Farmall tractor models. The M was the first Deere tractor to use a vertical two-cylinder engine, with a square bore and stroke of 4.0 \u00d7 4.0 inches (100.5cuin) with a high row crop. ==1949\u20131959: diesels and post World War II production== John Deere Model 60 1955 John Deere Model 530 1959 John Deere Model 430S Circa 1960 After years of testing, John Deere released its first proper diesel tractor in 1949, the Model R. The R was also the first Deere tractor with a 'live' independent PTO equipped with its own clutch. The R also incorporated live hydraulics. PowrTrol, as it was known, provided the operator the ability to lift equipment by the pull of a lever. A pump powered by the PTO clutch provided 1800 PSI of hydraulic pressure to a lever controlled valve. At 45 hp at the drawbar and 50 hp at the belt, it was the most fuel-efficient tractor available at the time, and this combination of features resulted in over 21,000 being built. The model R had a shipping weight of 7,670 lb. The R was equipped with two engines. The primary plant is a two-cylinder, four-stroke, naturally aspirated 416 cubic inch (5.75 X 8 bore and stroke) direct injected diesel engine with a 16:1 compression ratio. The starting motor is also a Deere two-cylinder, 26 cubic-inch horizontally opposed gasoline engine. The starting or \"pony\" engine is electrically started by a six-volt electrical system, and is used to crank the diesel. Testing results with various electrical starting systems for the diesel proved to be too bulky requiring a 24- or 32-volt system. The design of the pony start Rs allowed for hot exhaust gasses to preheat the intake air for the diesel and a common liquid cooling system allowed the pony engine to warm the diesel block and head. This provided sufficient cold weather starting aids for the diesel that it would reliably run in sub zero conditions. The R did have several teething problems as this was Deere's first production diesel tractor. Available as a standard tractor only, it did not have an adjustable front axle, nor did it have a three-point hitch. The engine was mainly an up-scaled gasoline engine from the Model D. The use of a thermosiphon cooling system and the lack of a three-point bearing crankshaft proved inadequate for diesel compression ratios. The R was prone to overheating and cracking the cylinder head. The lack of a center main bearing in the crankshaft allowed the shaft to flex when used as a stationary powerplant on the belt; this would lead to its failure. The live PTO was directed through (2) 45\u00b0 bevel gears that proved too small to durably transmit the full torque of the engine. The tractor was fully serviceable at pulling larger equipment efficiently on large acre wheatland farms. During the 1950s, the R saw a series of upgrades in the models 80, 820 and 830. The 80 was produced for two years and 3,500 were produced. It had new features, including power steering and dual hydraulics. It developed 68 hp and weighed 8,100 pounds. The 80 also corrected the other design flaws within the R such as using a water pump and pressure radiator cap and the addition of a center crankshaft main bearing. The 820 and 830 were similar overall, but also differed in their sheet metal exteriors, fuel tank designs and color schemes. The 820, a larger version of the 720 and the 720, was basically the same as the 70, except for the model number and that the sides of the hood are painted JD yellow. The 720 was upgraded to the 730 for 1959. The 730 featured more contoured bodywork than the 720 and came with more ergonomic features for the operator. Although the 730 had a short production run it became one of John Deere's most popular models. The 730 also featured power steering and 24-volt electric starter motor instead of the V4 pony start engine. The 730 was available in diesel, gasoline and LPG as well as in row crop tricycle, row crop wide front, standard tread and hi crop wide front formats. The 730 is very popular with tractor pulling enthusiasts because of its weight, power and slow speed. Plus its good looks have become popular with tractor restorers. The 730 was a 59 hp tractor at the belt and 54 at the drawbar. After making more than 1 1\u20444 million two-cylinder tractors, John Deere switched to four- and six-cylinder engines. Announcement of the change came after seven years of development and forty million dollars in retooling. In October 1959 the company showcased a new large 215 hp 4WD, called the 8010, on the Robert Ottilie Seed Farm north of Marshalltown, Iowa. It was shown during the largest farming field days event held in Iowa up to that time. Only 100 8010s were built, and 99 of those were rebuilt at the factory and re-released as 8020s in 1960.[6][7] ==1960s: New Generation== John Deere 3020 To introduce its New Generation tractors to all of its dealers in a single day, the company chartered planes to fly more than 5,000 people to Dallas, Texas, on August 30, 1961. Deere put their new tractors on display outside the Cotton Bowl and inside Neiman Marcus. The day would mark the release of a revolutionary line of farm tractors with sleek new styling by Henry Dreyfuss that would soon become the standard all other farm tractors would be measured by. These tractors were the 1010, 2010, 3010 and 4010. These were soon followed by the model 5010 standard introduced in 1962. The 5010 was the first two-wheel drive to exceed 100 hp at the PTO and drawbar. Designed for the western wheatlands, the 5010 was never available as a row crop model. In 1963 the 3010 and 4010 were replaced by the 3020 and 4020. The 4020 is one of the most popular tractors Deere and company has ever made. The year 1965 brought the 5020 standard, which was the industry's most powerful two-wheel-drive model, along with the 1020, 2020, and 54 hp model 2510. By 1966 Sales of the 4020 accounted for 48% of all John Deere tractor sales. Also that year the row crop version of the 5020 was introduced. In the late 1960s John Deere pioneered the roll- over protection structure to protect the farmer from injury in the event of a tractor roll-over. John Deere invited the competition to view a demonstration of its new Roll-Guard. Deere recommended that all tractors include this safety feature and offered to share its design and test data with its competitors. Deere also encouraged farmers to retro-fit their tractors with this safety feature, and offered Roll Guards at cost to farmers who wished to install them on their older New Generation tractors. In 1968 nine new models appeared: the 820, 920, 1120, 1520, 2520, 4000, 4520, WA-14, and WA-17. The WA-14 and WA-17 were articulated four-wheel-drive tractors. The 4520 was John Deere's first turbocharged tractor. The 3020 and 4020 were updated with new features, and the 5020 model had a power increase to an industry leading 141 hp. The 4000 was a high horsepower-to-weight tractor, designed to be a \"runner\" rather than a \"lugger\". The 4000 used the same engine as the popular 4020, but weighed almost 1000 lbs less. According to Deere the 4000 could, in the same amount of time, pull a 4-bottom plow fast enough to cover the same acreage as a 4020 pulling a 5-bottom plow. The John Deere 4000 was also an economy tractor, providing the same horsepower as the 4020 with fewer features and smaller rear axles. ==1970s Generation II== During the 1970s, John Deere introduced 36 new models. In 1972 John Deere introduced the Generation II tractors. Generation II was characterized by the optional Sound Guard body which was the first truly successful integrated tractor cab. This innovative cab was isolated from the tractor by large rubber bushings which dampened vibrations, and the interior was insulated with foam to reduce noise and protect the operator from extreme temperatures outside. A foam pad on the firewall and sheets of lead under the dash greatly reduced engine noise inside the cab. The Sound Guard body also featured a rounded front windshield with an integrated door. The door post was in line with the exhaust and air intake pipes pipe through the hood for the best forward visibility possible. Fully integrated heating and air conditioning was standard equipment, and it also featured windshield wipers, a dome light, a red interior lamp to illuminate the gear shift levers and hydraulic controls during nighttime operation, and speakers for an optional AM/FM radio which many farmers added because they found the cab so quiet they could actually hear it. When it was introduced it was the quietest tractor cab in the industry and a vast improvement over the aftermarket cabs that John Deere had previously retrofitted to its tractors. The Generation II tractors also offered other innovative features not available on previous Deere models such as a Quad Range transmission that improved on Deere's proven Synchro Range transmission by adding a high and low gears in each range, and Deere's new Perma-Clutch, a wet clutch that would last much longer - virtually the life of the tractor. *1970 the 116 hp 4320, the 135 hp 4620, and 146 hp 7020 were introduced. *1970 in Argentina, introduced the local-made 20 series, with the 1420,http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2013/05/john- deere-1420.html 2420,http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2013/05/john- deere-2420.html 3420http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2013/12/john- deere-3420.html and 4420.http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2013/05/john-deere-4420.html *1971 the 60 hp 2030, the 175 hp 6030, and 7520 (also at 175 hp) were added. *1972, On Saturday August 19, John Deere dealers held an open house to usher in their 'Generation 2' tractors. The four new tractors were the 80-HPhp 4030, 100 hp 4230, 125 hp 4430 and 150 hp 4630. There were billed as \"Sound Idea\" tractors because of their innovative Sound Guard Body operators enclosure. *1973 would see the final New generation utility tractors launched, - the 35 hp 830, 45 hp 1530 and 70 hp 2630. *1974 the first two models in the Generation 2 four-wheel drive range appeared in 1974 in the 215 hp 8430 and 275 hp 8630. *1975 in Argentina, the 30 series was launched with the 2330,http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2014/01/john-deere-2330.html 2530,http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2014/01/john-deere-2530.html 2730,http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2014/08/john-deere-2730.html 3330,http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2014/10/john-deere-3330.html 3530http://pesadosargentinos.blogspot.com.ar/2014/08/john-deere-3530.html and 4530. *1975 the initial Generation 2 utility tractors were introduced. These were the 40 hp 2040, 50 hp 2240, 60 hp 2440 and 70 hp 2640. *In late 1976 a new 80 hp addition as the 2840. *1977 saw what came to be known as \"Seven in '77.\" The company's first compact diesels, the \"Task Master\" tractors, were introduced in the 22 hp 850 and 27 hp 950. Other than that, the big news was what John Deere called \"The New Iron Horses\" with more horses and more iron. These were the 90 hp 4040, 110 hp 4240, 130 hp 4440, 156 hp 4640, and the 180 hp 4840, which replaced the 6030. The \"Iron Horses\" featured an improved Sound Guard Body with more sound proofing, hydraulic seat suspension and Deere's Personal Posture seat as standard equipment. The 4240, 4440, 4640, and 4840 featured a new engine. *1978 brought the 215 hp 8440 and 275 hp 8640 articulated four wheel drive tractors. *1979, late in year a third diesel compact was added, the 33 hp 1050. It had a turbo diesel engine which was unique in its class. Five new utility tractors were added at the same time, the 41 hp 2040, 50 hp 2240, 60 hp 2440, 70 hp 2640 and 81 hp 2940. These five new models had a black and yellow \"tiger stripe\" on both sides of the hood. *1979 was the first year for the 40 series in Argentina, because the first model are the John Deere 3440, and continues in the 80's with the 2140, 3140 / 3140 DT, 3540. ==1980s== John Deere introduced at least 38 new tractors during the 1980s during a time when at least 3 other competitors merged, were sold or went out of business altogether: * Two new small compact diesel tractors were added in 1981. These were the 14.5 PTO hp 650 and 18 PTO hp 750. Three new 4WDs came to market in the fall of 1981. These were the 225 hp 8450, 290 hp 8650, and big 370 hp 8850. The 8850 came with the company's biggest engine, the 955-cubic-inch V-8. * Besides the 8850 the JD844 wheel loader and 990 hydraulic excavator were the only other John Deere products to get this V-8. Also according to Wayne Broehl's 1984 book, about the John Deere's Company, a larger 4WD tractor than the 8850 was supposed to appear but never did. * In 1982 11 new 50 series tractors from 40 up to 192.99 hp debuted. The 40 hp 1250, 45 hp 2150, 55 hp 2350, 65 hp 2550, 75 hp 2750, 85 hp 2950, 100 hp 4050, 120 hp 4250, 140 hp 4450, 165 hp 4650 and 192.99 hp 4850. From the 2150 to the 4850 got another industry leading innovation in the use of Castor Action mechanical front-wheel drive which provided 20 percent more pulling power. Like the front tires of a motor grader this Castor/Action Mechanical Front Wheel Drive (MFWD) had the front tires lean to give a shorter turning radius. Deere's 50 series tractors also offered a new power shift transmission with 15 operating speeds. When tested in Nebraska the 4850 was the most fuel efficient tractor ever tested over 60 hp. * The following year 1983 brought in the final two 50 Series tractors namely the 50 hp 1450 and 60 hp 1650. When tested in Nebraska the 1650 proved to be the most fuel efficient tractor ever tested. A 4020 shadow namely the 95 hp 3150 came about in 1985. This was the first John Deere row crop tractor to have MFWD as standard equipment. * Three new diesel compacts came to light in 1986. These were the 16 hp 655, 20 hp 755, 24 hp 855 and 900HC. The 900HC was offset like the 2-cylinder M and was for niche markets. The 655, 755 and 855 all had a hydrostatic drive transmission. The 2355, 2555, 2755 and 2955 were featured as price fighter (Economy) tractors in 1986 with less features. * The following year 1987 John Deere brought out six new models in the 45 hp 2155, 55 hp 2355, 65 hp 2555, 75 hp 2755, 85 hp 2955, and 96 hp 3155. * In an October 1988 at the dealer meeting in Denver, Colorado the new 235 hp 8560, 300 hp 8760, and 370 hp 8960 were introduced. * In early 1989 in Palm Springs, California six new 55 Series tractors were shown to dealers. These were the 105 hp 4055, 120 hp 4255, 140 hp 4455, 156 hp 4555, 177 hp 4755, and 202 hp 4955. The 4555 was an entirely new model which was the same size as the 4640. * This year also brought the 70 Series gear driven compact diesels. These were the 18 hp 670, 24 hp 770, 28 hp 870, 33 hp 970, and 38 hp 1070. ==1990s and generation 3== * In 1990 a new hydrostatic compact utility tractor was introduced: the 955 with a diesel 33 hp three-cylinder engine. ===5000 series=== In some industry watchers were calling Generation 3 the year 1991 brought a glimpse of what John Deere tractors of the 1990s would be like. Eight new tractors were introduced in 1991 starting with the three 5000 Series tractors. These were the 40 hp 5200, 50 hp 5300, and 60 hp 5400. A new model the 92 hp 3055, and 100 hp 3255 followed. John Deere is manufacturing 5000 series of tractors from Sanaswadi, Pune in India, range of products from India are listed below. Additionally, the paint schemes changed in 2007. In 2007, Deere made some HP rating changes in otherwise unchanged machines. The 5103 came with a black engine and drive line prior to 2007 when they began painting the engine area all green. These are referred to as black belly's or green bellies. The black belly 5103 was rated at 50HP, while as is listed below the green belly 5103 was rated at 40HP. * 5036C 35 hp * 5041C 41 hp * 5103 Economy (35 hp) * 5038 D (38 hp) * 5103 (40 hp) * 5103 S (42 hp) * 5104 (45 hp) * 5203 S (50 hp) * 5204 (50 hp) * 5210 (45 hp) * 5310 (55 hp) * 5310 MFWD (55 hp) * 5410 (65 hp) * 5510 MFWD (75 hp) ===60 series=== For 1992 model year the 160 hp 4560, the 175 hp 4760, and 202 hp 4960 were introduced. They were nearly identical to the 4555, 4755, and 4955 they replaced with the improvements being improved lighting and safety, hood free of the air intake and exhaust pipe, which was moved to the right corner post of the cab on the 60 series tractors, and an improved cab entry step with handrail. ===6000/7000 series=== In the fall of 1992 six totally new 6000/7000 Series tractors were introduced; the 62 hp 6200, 75 hp 6300, 85 hp 6400, 110 hp 7600, 125 hp 7700, and 146 hp 7800. Also the cabs were completely redesigned for better visibility and operator comfort.

The company had another dealer meeting in late July 2008 to introduce many new utility tractors. But the real announcement came with John Deere introduced a new Worldwide Numbering Scheme for the Entire Line up of Compact and AG Tractors. ===Power ratings / model numbers=== From the 2008 model range on the Engine horsepower will now be advertised in metric (ISO) per the International Organization for Standardization 97/68/EC standard for determining bare engine horsepower at rated engine power in the Model name. *The First digit will determine size, *The next Three will determine engine horsepower, *A new letter will be added (currently D, E, or M) to determine spec level. **R being a high spec machine (like the Premium series in the 6000 and 7000 series) the **M to denote a mid spec and **E/D to denote a low-spec (\"value spec\") (like the 03 and 05 series in the 6000 and 5000 respectively). *A sixth digit describes special configurations (like \"T\" for Tracks on the 8RT series tractors) ====Example==== For example, the new 3032E Tractor will be a 3000 with 32 hp on engine. The E is low-spec. This tractor represents the 2007 year 3203 for its spec, not to be mistaken for the 3320 which has the same hp but more features and at a higher price. Over the next few years all Tractors will get this scheme. The issue is that Deere is using Engine hp in the Name, not PTO which is usually less. ===2008 Models=== In 2008, the first Tractors to get this scheme were the 5D, 5E, 5E Limited edition and the 6D Series tractors. These tractors were introduced at the annual John Deere dealer meeting. This year's event was held in Denver, Colorado. *5D - range of the 45 hp 5045D, and 55 hp 5055D. The PTO ratings are 37 and 45 respectively. The 5D tractors are only available in two-wheel drive. *5E -range of the 45 hp 5045E, 55 hp 5055E, 65 hp 5065E, and 75 hp 5075E. The PTO hp ratings are the 37, 45, 53, and 61 respectively. The 5E Limited come with MFWD-mechanical front-wheel drive. *5E Limited tractors which are the 83 hp 5083E, 93 hp 5093E, and 101 hp 5101E. The PTO hp ratings are 65,75 and 82 respectively. The 5E tractor are available in both 2-wheel drive and MFWD versions. The biggest tractors in the new range were the 100-140 hp 6D models. *6D - range of the 100 hp 6100D, 115 hp 6115D, 130 hp 6130D, and 140 hp 6140D. PTO hp for the 4 models are 82, 95, 105 and 115 respectively. The 6D is offered in 2WD and MFWD versions. According to Deere.com the company introduced two new 3E Series tractors. This pair of new 3E Series tractors is on page two of The Furrow, December 2008 edition. Both new 3E models would appear in early October 2008. These would be the 31/25 hp 3032E and 37/30 hp 3038E.

The 8225R is the only one available as a two-wheel- drive model. Optional IVT or Powershift Transmissions. In John Deere language the first number=size, the next three numbers are the engine hp and the letter at the end stands for capability.

Despite their competitors going with SCR to counter this John Deere will be using EGR-Exhaust Gas Recirculation. To tell these new 8R tractors apart from the 2010 tractors John Deere put new wrap-around lights up front. Also the model number has been moved close to the front just off the black grill on both sides .Another characteristic is the new large black muffler on the right corner of the cab.
