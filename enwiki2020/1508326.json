He competed at the 1952 Winter Olympics in the Nordic combined and 18 km cross- country skiing and won the gold medal in the former event. Earlier he won a Nordic combined bronze medal at the 1950 World Championships. He won 14 Norwegian titles and was the first Nordic combined athlete to jump over 100 m. Sl\u00e5ttvik won the Nordic combined event at the Holmenkollen ski festival in 1948, 1950 and 1951, and was awarded the Holmenkollen medal in 1951. Sl\u00e5ttvik started competing in Nordic events aged 15. His career was delayed by World War II and peaked around 1950, when he was already in his thirties. After the 1952 Olympics he won a national title in 1953, placed fifth at the 1954 World Championships, and remained active through the late 1950s. Sl\u00e5ttvik was known for his relatively mild training regime, and would often smoke after a race. In the early 1950s he moved to Lillehammer, married and had two sons. He named one of them Heikki after his Finnish friend and long-term rival Heikki Hasu. ==Cross-country skiing results== ===Olympic Games=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center; border:grey solid 1px; border- collapse:collapse; background:#ffffff;\" ! style=\"background-color:#369; color:white; width:60px;\"| Year ! style=\"background-color:#369; color:white; width:40px;\"| Age ! style=\"background-color:#4180be; color:white; width:75px;\"| 18 km ! style=\"background-color:#4180be; color:white; width:75px;\"| 50 km ! style=\"background-color:#4180be; color:white; width:75px;\"| 4 \u00d7 10 km relay |- | 1952 || 34 || 15 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- |} ===World Championships=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center; border:grey solid 1px; border-collapse:collapse; background:#ffffff;\" ! style=\"background- color:#369; color:white; width:60px;\"| Year ! style=\"background-color:#369; color:white; width:40px;\"| Age ! style=\"background-color:#4180be; color:white; width:75px;\"| 15 km ! style=\"background-color:#4180be; color:white; width:75px;\"| 30 km ! style=\"background-color:#4180be; color:white; width:75px;\"| 50 km ! style=\"background-color:#4180be; color:white; width:75px;\"| 4 \u00d7 10 km relay |- | 1954 || 36 ||59||\u2014 ||\u2014 ||\u2014 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Holmenkollen medalists \u2013 click Holmenkollmedaljen for downloadable pdf file * Holmenkollen winners since 1892 \u2013 click Vinnere for downloadable pdf file Simon Sl\u00e5ttvik (left) and Erling Kroken at the 1952 Holmenkollen Category:1917 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Norwegian male Nordic combined skiers Category:Norwegian male cross-country skiers Category:Olympic Nordic combined skiers of Norway Category:Olympic cross- country skiers of Norway Category:Cross-country skiers at the 1952 Winter Olympics Category:Nordic combined skiers at the 1952 Winter Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Norway Category:Holmenkollen medalists Category:Holmenkollen Ski Festival winners Category:Olympic medalists in Nordic combined Category:FIS Nordic World Ski Championships medalists in Nordic combined Category:Medalists at the 1952 Winter Olympics ",
