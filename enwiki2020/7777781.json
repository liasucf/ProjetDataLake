New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 21 February 2019 the second son of Captain Francois Mariauchau d'Esgly (1670-1730), of the Dauphin's Regiment and the Governor-General's Guards;The Encyclopedia of Canada, Vol. II, W. Stewart Wallace, ed.),Toronto, University Associates of Canada, 1948, p. 298 King's Lieutenant at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. His mother, Louise-Philippe Chartier de Lotbini\u00e8re (1690-1725), was the daughter of Ren\u00e9-Louis Chartier de Lotbini\u00e8re. He was godson of his mother's first cousin, Pierre de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial, and he himself was a first cousin of Michel Chartier de Lotbini\u00e8re, Marquis de Lotbini\u00e8re. After completing his studies at the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, he was ordained priest in 1734 and appointed pastor of Saint-Pierre-d'Orl\u00e9ans, which also included duties at Saint-Laurent in L'Arbre-Sec. After thirty-five years of humble ministry, he was called to the episcopate and consecrated coadjutor of Quebec, 12 July 1772, the first native of Canada to attain to the dignity of bishop. The Lotbini\u00e8re family had lobbied the governor, and Bishop Briand thought it best to agree even though his proposed successor was older than he and deaf. While accepting the position, Esgly chose to remain parish priest at St. Pierre. In 1775 he made a pastoral visit to the other parishes on the \u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans. On the resignation of Bishop Briand, he succeeded to the See of Quebec 29 November 1784, but continued to serve as pastor at St. Pierre.Scott, Henry Arthur. \"Archdiocese of Quebec.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 21 February 2019 One of his first acts was to appoint his vicars general for the vast diocese. He confirmed Henri- Fran\u00e7ois Grav\u00e9 de La Rive at Quebec, Pierre Garreau at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, and \u00c9tienne Montgolfier at Montreal,Pelletier, Jean-Guy. \u201cMariauchau d\u2019Esgly, Louis-Philippe\u201d, Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 4, University of Toronto/Universit\u00e9 Laval, 2003 while he oversaw things from Saint- Pierre-d'Orl\u00e9ans. In his first pastoral letter he alludes to the appointment of a coadjutor, a precaution justified by age, infirmity, and the necessity of securing a successor. Bishop Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Hubert, who was a missioner at Notre-Dame-de l\u2019Assomption near Detroit at the time, was nominated coadjutor that same year, but the approval of the British Government was withheld till 1786. The main question that concerned him was the lack of priests. Bishop d'Esglis tried unsuccessfully to supply the dearth of clergy by obtaining priests from France. The British Government preferred the emigration of priests for the settlements in Upper Canada and the Maritime Provinces. Pending the arrival of a missionary for the Acadians, a layman was authorized to baptize and witness marriage contracts. Acadians settled in the maritime provinces and confirmed Joseph-Mathurin Bourg as Vicar-General for that area. Fathers Girouard, Le Roux, and Donat, of the congregation of the Holy Ghost served there, while the Irish and Scotch Catholics of the same region were attended by the Abb\u00e9 Phelan and Capuchin James Jones, who resided at Halifax. Bishop John Butler of Cork sent some priests, recruited by the Irish Father Thomas Hussey, representative of the Diocese of Quebec in London. In 1787, Bishop d'Esglis issued a pastoral letter to all the faithful of the lower provinces, exhorting them to union and steadfastness in the Faith. He died 4 June 1788 in the fifty-fifth year of his priesthood and was buried at Saint- Pierre. In 1969, his remains were transferred to the crypt of the basilica of Notre-Dame in Quebec. == See also == * Joseph-Laurent Bertrand ==References== ==Sources== * Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online Category:Roman Catholic Bishops of Quebec Category:18th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:1710 births Category:1788 deaths Category:Burials at Notre- Dame de Qu\u00e9bec Cathedral ",
