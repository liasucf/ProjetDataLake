At age twelve in October 1104, Irtash briefly replaced his nephew, the one-year old Tutush II, as ruler of Damascus. Duqaq, the brother of Tutush I and father of Tutush II, had Irtash imprisoned at Baalbek in 1104, then ruled by al-Taj G\u00fcm\u00fcshtegin. Released on the order of Toghtekin and suspicious of the latter\u2019s intentions, he fled to Hauran where he was given asylum by emir Aytekin al-Halabi of Bosra. The two deserted to the Franks and supported Baldwin I in the third battle of Ramla. He then retired to ar-Rahba. ==References== * * * * * The Crusades\u2014An Encyclopedia, Alan V.
