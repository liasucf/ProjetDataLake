Bob \"Bobke\" Roll (born July 7, 1960 in Oakland, California) is an American former professional cyclist, author, and television sports commentator. He was a member of the 7-Eleven Cycling Team until 1990 and competed for the Motorola Cycling Team in 1991. In 1992 Roll moved to Greg LeMond's Z team and added mountain biking to his racing accomplishments. Roll continued racing mountain bikes professionally through 1998. Roll is known in the cycling world, and to his global cable television fans, fondly, as \"Bobke\". He has written Bobke: A Ride on the Wild Side of Cycling, Bobke II, and two Tour de France Companion volumes. (\"Bobke\" is Southern Dutch for \"Bobby\".) He has also had many columns published in VeloNews. He is credited with suggesting that Joe Parkin, professional cyclist and author, move to Europe and wrote the foreword for Joe's first book. As the accounts of the now legendary story go, in 1998 a young Lance Armstrong, continuing to recover from testicular cancer remediation, had recently dropped out of the Paris\u2013Nice cycling race. Armstrong's training coach, Chris Carmichael, invited the affable and entertaining Roll to journey to Boone, North Carolina, to talk with Lance and do training rides with the young Armstrong for several days. Armstrong was extremely discouraged by his recent European cycling results, and Carmichael believed Armstrong had lost his career focus and was on the verge of fully retiring from professional cycling. Almost out of desperation, Carmichael talked Armstrong into doing one last series of intensive training rides, with \"Bobke\" as his riding partner. Roll was up to the challenge. Armstrong was a promising future cycling talent and his cycling career was in jeopardy. According to Roll, \"I am sure Lance had probably never met a bike racer like me...a person who could still find some joy and happiness in such weather misery. We had eight hours a day, for eight straight days, of continuous riding in the pouring rain - rain in Biblical proportions! I think Lance would've turned things around even without our talks and rides in the Appalachia[n]s, but it turned out to be a pivotal career event for him (and Roll had made a new cycling friend).\" A refocused and encouraged Armstrong went on to a successful fourth-place finish in the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, and within a year and a half he had won his first yellow jersey overall victory in the Tour de France road race. Armstrong has since had his yellow jersey wins nullified due to doping. (Roll's tale of the ride is in Bobke II; Armstrong's is in It's Not About the Bike.Lance Armstrong, Sally Jenkins: It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life, Chapter 5, (), Putnam 2000.) Roll continues to enjoy riding road and mountain bicycles for recreation, and is a member of the veteran cable television broadcasting team (along with Phil Liggett, MBE and the late Paul Sherwen) who serve as road cycling expert-commentators for the NBC Sports Network cable network's coverage of the Tour de France, Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, Giro d'Italia, Paris\u2013Roubaix, Tour of California, and other international cycling road races. Roll has appeared in a series of Road ID Tour de France television commercials as himself, riding a bus along with \"Tour Mania\" (a costumed-disguised rowdy faux rock group played by well-known professional cyclists, such as George Hincapie). ==Cycling achievements== *3-time Tour de France racer - 63rd (1986), DNF due to a crash (1987), 132nd (1990).

He finished 61st. He finished 78th in 1985 and 114th in 1989. *7-time Paris\u2013Roubaix racer - 55th (1986), 48th (1987), 25th (1988), 37th (1989), 61st (1990), and two DNFs *2-time Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge racer - 17th (1987), and 54th (1990) *3-time Tour de Suisse racer - 56th (1987) - as a domestique for overall winner Andrew Hampsten, 48th (1990) *2-time Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9 racer - 1990, 97th (1991) - where in an odd twist he wore the number ending in 1 signifying he was Motorola's \"team leader\" for the event Bob Roll wins stage 1985 Coors Devils Cup Mt Diablo. *2-time Amstel Gold Race participant - 64th (1988), 120th (1991) *Tour of Luxembourg racer - 40th (1987) *Won stage 3 of the 1988 Tour de Romandie *Won stage 11 (Vail criterium) of the 1985 Coors Classic *Won the 1997 & 1998 San Francisco Hill Climb *Raced in eight World Championships (in both road racing and mountain biking) ===Grand Tour general classification results timeline=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Grand Tour ! scope=\"col\" | 1985 ! scope=\"col\" | 1986 ! scope=\"col\" | 1987 ! scope=\"col\" | 1988 ! scope=\"col\" | 1989 ! scope=\"col\" | 1990 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A pink jersey Giro d'Italia | style=\"text- align:center;\"|78 |\u2014 |\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|61 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|114 |\u2014 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A yellow jersey Tour de France |\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|63 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|DNF |\u2014 |\u2014 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|132 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A red jersey Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Legend |- ! scope=\"row\" | \u2014 | Did not compete |- ! scope=\"row\" | DNF | Did not finish |- ! scope=\"row\" | IP | In Progress |} ==Bibliography== * * * ==References== ==External links== * Bob Roll's website * Bob Roll's book * A weblog/tribute to Bob with comments on current events in cycling * Bob in his 7-Eleven uniform * 2007 Pezcyclingnews interview of Bob Roll by Matt Wood Category:American male cyclists Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:American sports announcers Category:American color commentators Category:Cycling announcers Category:American mountain bikers Category:Sportspeople from Oakland, California Category:Tour de France cyclists ",
