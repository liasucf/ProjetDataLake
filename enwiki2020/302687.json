    "text": "These shapes are rhomboids Traditionally, in two-dimensional geometry, a rhomboid is a parallelogram in which adjacent sides are of unequal lengths and angles are non-right angled. A parallelogram with sides of equal length (equilateral) is a rhombus but not a rhomboid. A parallelogram with right angled corners is a rectangle but not a rhomboid. The term rhomboid is now more often used for a rhombohedron or a more general parallelepiped, a solid figure with six faces in which each face is a parallelogram and pairs of opposite faces lie in parallel planes. Some crystals are formed in three- dimensional rhomboids. This solid is also sometimes called a rhombic prism. The term occurs frequently in science terminology referring to both its two- and three-dimensional meaning. ==History== Euclid introduced the term in his Elements in Book I, Definition 22, Euclid never used the definition of rhomboid again and introduced the word parallelogram in Proposition 34 of Book I; \"In parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another, and the diameter bisects the areas.\" Heath suggests that rhomboid was an older term already in use. ==Symmetries== The rhomboid has no line of symmetry, but it has rotational symmetry of order 2. ==In biology== In biology, rhomboid may describe a geometric rhomboid (e.g. the rhomboid muscles) or a bilaterally-symmetrical kite-shaped or diamond-shaped outline, as in leaves or cephalopod fins. ==In medicine== In a type of arthritis called pseudogout, crystals of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate accumulate in the joint, causing inflammation. Aspiration of the joint fluid reveals rhomboid- shaped crystals under a microscope. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Quadrilaterals ",
