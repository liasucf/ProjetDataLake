    "text": "The NXT Year-End Awards is a concept used by WWE, where awards, similar to the Academy, Grammy and WWE's own Slammy Awards, are given to professional wrestlers who have competed in NXT in the previous year. There have been five editions of the concept. Fans cast votes online, via Twitter or WWE's website, to decide the winners. Recipients of the award are given a golden ring bell with a hammer. Starting with the 2019 edition, the NXT Year-End Awards also recognize wrestlers from the NXT UK brand. == Versions == === 2015 NXT Year- End Awards === The award winners were announced on the January 13, 2016 episode of NXT via video presentation.
