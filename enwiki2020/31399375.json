    "text": "\u00c9velyne Lever (known simply in English as Evelyne Lever) is a contemporary French historian and writer. She was married to a French historian, Maurice Lever, who is the author of Sade. Lever was previously a research engineer at CNRS, and then began to focus more on 18th-century history. In particular, she focuses on certain people, including Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and Madame de Pompadour. Marie Antoinette: The Last Queen of France was her first book to be published in the United States. It is less extensive than Lever's French version (Marie-Antoinette : la derni\u00e8re reine), and was written specifically for an American audience. She continues to write on and about 18th-century history. == Publications == French * 1792, les proc\u00e8s de Louis XVI et de Marie-Antoinette, Complexe * Louis XVIII, Fayard, 1988 * Louis XVI, Fayard, 1991 * M\u00e9moires du baron de Breteuil, \u00e9dition critique, Paris, Fran\u00e7ois Bourin, 1992 * Marie-Antoinette : la derni\u00e8re reine, Gallimard, coll. \"D\u00e9couvertes Gallimard\" vol. 402, Paris, 2000 * Madame de Pompadour: A Life, (with) Catherine Temerson, trad. by Catherine Temerson, St. Martin's Press, 2003 * L'Affaire du Collier, Fayard, 2004 * Les derni\u00e8res noces de la monarchie.
