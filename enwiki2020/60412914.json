CBC Music also praised it writing that Dion soars on this dance anthem as she embraces the \"winds of change\" as she sings. According to CBC review, it is the beat drop of the chorus paired with Dion's \"tremendous emphasis\" of the words \"my own\" that make this track \"truly take off\". ==Music video== The debut live performance of \"Flying on My Own\" was filmed in Las Vegas on 7 June 2019 and uploaded to Dion's YouTube channel the next day.
