    "text": "thumb|Phase out of lightweight plastic products in the United States There is no national plastic bag fee or ban currently in effect in the United States. However, the states of California, Hawaii (de facto), New York, Oregon, and Vermont, and the territories of American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico have banned disposable bags. Additionally, the states of Washington, Connecticut, Delaware, and Maine have passed laws banning disposable bags that are set to go into effect in 2021. Over 200 counties and municipalities have enacted ordinances either imposing a fee on plastic bags or banning them outright, including all counties in Hawaii. Some attempts at banning plastic shopping bags statewide (for example in Massachusetts, though as of August 2019, 122 cities and towns in the state have done soMassachusetts plastic bag ban is now tied up in Beacon HillPlastic Bag Laws in Massachusetts) have not succeeded mainly due to plastic industry lobbying. A few jurisdictions have chosen to implement a fee-only approach to bag reduction such as Connecticut, Washington, D.C. and adjacent Montgomery County, Maryland, although Connecticut plans on replacing the fee with a full ban by July 2021. Some US states, such as Florida and Arizona, have passed laws preventing local municipalities from passing their own bans. Some retailers have stopped using plastic bags ahead of government mandates. ==Summary of plastic bag laws== {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" style=\"width:100%\" |+Local laws governing plastic bag use in the United States |- ! rowspan=1 width= \"12%\" | State/Territory ! rowspan=1 width= \"15%\" | Jurisdiction ! rowspan=1 width= \"10%\"| Passage date ! rowspan=1 width= \"10%\"| Effective date ! rowspan=1 width= \"38%\"| Effect |- | rowspan=\"9\"| Alaska |- | City of Bethel | | | Plastic bag ban. |- | City of Homer | | | Plastic bag ban. |- | City of Hooper Bay | | | Plastic bag ban. |- | City of Wasilla | | | Plastic bag ban. |- | City of Kodiak | | | Plastic bag ban. |- | City of Palmer | | | Plastic bag ban. |- | City-Borough of Anchorage | | | Plastic bag ban, 10 cent charge for paper bags.

In response, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent letters to 11 other Texas cities with bag bans telling them that such bans were now illegal and unenforceable. On July 3, 2018, the City of Austin announced that it would end enforcement of its bag ban. *Minnesota has a preemption on local laws that ban plastic bags, but allows for fees on them instead. == California == Californians voted in November 2016 to approve state legislation banning plastic bags statewide in Propositions 67 and 65. Over 100 local laws with similar or tougher regulations will remain and supersede the statewide legislation. {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw- collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"width:100%\" |+Local laws governing plastic bag use in California |- ! rowspan=1 width= \"12%\" | Region ! rowspan=1 width= \"15%\" | County ! rowspan=1 width= \"15%\"| Jurisdictions covered ! rowspan=1 width= \"10%\"| Passage date ! rowspan=1 width= \"10%\"| Effective date ! rowspan=1 width= \"38%\"| Effect |- |rowspan=\"3\"| Central Valley | rowspan=\"2\"| Sacramento County | Sacramento | 2015 \u2013 March | 2016 \u2013 January | rowspan=\"2\"| Plastic bag ban; 10 cent charge for paper bags. |- | Unincorporated territories | 2016 \u2013 April | 2016 \u2013 July |- | rowspan=\"1\"|Yolo County | Davis | 2013 \u2013 November | 2014 \u2013 July | Plastic bag ban. |- |rowspan=\"25\"| Greater Los Angeles Area | rowspan=\"16\"|Los Angeles County | Beverly Hills | 2014 \u2013 22 April | 2014 \u2013 1 July | rowspan=\"7\"| Plastic bag ban; 10 cent charge for paper bags. |- | Calabasas | 2011 \u2013 February | 2011 \u2013 July |- | Culver City | 2013 \u2013 May | 2013 \u2013 December |- | Glendale | 2013 \u2013 January | 2013 \u2013 July |- | Hermosa Beach | \u2013 | 2016 \u2013 April |- | Long Beach | 2012 \u2013 February | 2013 \u2013 January |- | Los Angeles | 2013 \u2013 June | 2014 \u2013 January |- | Malibu | 2008 \u2013 May | 2009 \u2013 May | rowspan=\"2\"| Plastic bag ban. |- | Manhattan Beach | 2008 \u2013 July | 2011 \u2013 July |- | Monrovia | 2014 \u2013 July | 2015 \u2013 January | rowspan=\"7\"| Plastic bag ban; 10 cent charge for paper bags. |- | Pasadena | 2011 \u2013 November | 2012 \u2013 July |- | Pico Rivera | 2014 \u2013 October | 2016 \u2013 July |- | Santa Monica | 2011 \u2013 February | 2011 \u2013 September |- | South Pasadena | 2014 \u2013 October | 2014 \u2013 December |- | West Hollywood | 2012 \u2013 August | 2013 \u2013 February |- | Unincorporated territories | 2010 \u2013 November | 2012 \u2013 January |- | rowspan=\"3\"|Orange County | Dana Point | 2012 \u2013 March | 2013 \u2013 April | Plastic bag ban. |- | Huntington Beach | 2013 \u2013 April | 2013 \u2013 November | Plastic bag ban; 10 cent charge for paper bags. |- | Laguna Beach | 2012 \u2013 February | 2013 \u2013 January | Plastic bag ban; 10 cent charge for paper bags. |- | rowspan=\"5\"|Riverside County | Cathedral City | 2015 \u2013 July | 2016 \u2013 February | Plastic bag ban; 10 cent charge for paper bags. |- | Desert Hot Springs | 2014 \u2013 March | 2014 \u2013 September | Plastic bag ban.
