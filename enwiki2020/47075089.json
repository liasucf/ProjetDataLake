Launched in 2012 to replace its predecessor, the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission, the CMG is responsible for implementing the Child Support Act 1991 and subsequent legislation in the form of its two services, the Child Support Agency and from 2012 its long-term successor, the Child Maintenance Service. The current Minister in charge of the Child Maintenance Service is Baroness Stedman-Scott Child maintenance is assessed on a number of factors. A non resident parents annual gross income. The Number of children that live with the non resident parent. The Number of children in a family based arrangement. The Number of Qualifying children on the child maintenance case. Shared Care; the existing number of overnight stays are banded for example between 52-103 overnight stays a year will entitle the resident parents to a 1/7 reduction. Special Expenses; for example contact costs. Once this is factored in, payments are calculated based upon a percentage of the non resident parents income. ==Press Releases and News== *Official GOV.UK Website; Child Maintenance Reform ==See also== *Child Support Agency *Child Support Agency Australia *Family dispute resolution *Shared care ==External links== *Official CSA website *The independent Case Examiner *DWP official statistics https://www.gov.uk/child-maintenance Category:Department for Work and Pensions Category:Family law in the United Kingdom Category:Child welfare in the United Kingdom ",
