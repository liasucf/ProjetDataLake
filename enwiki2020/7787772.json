Unlike the recently introduced heavy roller which became universally used by 1880 and produced significant changes in the game by eliminating previously ubiquitous shooters, covering was for a long time severely rejected in England:Rosenwater, Irving; \"A History of Wicket-Covering in England\"; in Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanac; One Hundred and Seventh Edition (1970); pp. 131\u2013146 it was the wet summer of 1924Pardon, Sydney H. (editor); John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack, Sixty- Second Edition (1925); Part I; p. 333 before covering as regular practice was even considered and 1959 before it was considered \"acceptable\". * 14 May: MCC lose seven wickets before their first run is scored on a sticky wicket at Lord's against James Southerton and William Marten of Surrey.Marylebone Cricket Club v Surrey in 1872 Their ninth wicket falls at 8 - which would have been the lowest score in an important match for sixty-two years - but the last wicket doubles the score * Prince's Cricket Ground hosted its first first- class match being between North and South on 16 May. Before being built on, it was generally praised for its wicketsRae, Simon; W. G.
