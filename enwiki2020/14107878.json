Period/Epoch ! Event |- | 350 Ma | Devonian | An unnamed terrane collides and accretes to the North American Plate, along a line roughly coinciding with the Nevada\u2013Utah border and called the Carlin Unconformity. |- | 250 Ma | Permian | The Sonomia Terrane collides and accretes to the North American Plate, along a line called the Golconda Thrust (also the name of the event) which runs through central Nevada. |- | 200 Ma | Triassic | Sierra Nevada batholith first develops. |- | 180 Ma | Jurassic | The Intermontane Plate collides with the Pacific Northwest, the remnants of which form the Intermontane Belt today. |- | 165 Ma | Jurassic | The Smartville Block, an island arc terrane, collides and accretes to the North American Plate, along a line which coincides with the Mother Lode country of California. |- | 140 Ma | Jurassic | Second wave of plutons added to Sierra batholith. |- | 115 Ma | Cretaceous | The Insular Plate collides with the Pacific Northwest. The remnants of that terrane comprise the Insular Belt today, of which Vancouver Island is a part. |- | 90 Ma | Cretaceous | Third and last wave of plutons added to Sierra batholith. |- | 43 Ma | Eocene | The Pacific Plate changes its direction of motion from north to northwest. |- | 35 Ma | Eocene | Rio Grande Rift begins to form. |- | 20 Ma | Miocene | San Andreas Fault comes into being as the North American Plate begins splitting the Farallon Plate in two. |- | 17 Ma - 14 Ma | Miocene | Columbia River Basalt Group Forms. |- | 8 Ma | Miocene | Onset of faulting creating the Basin and Range geologic province. |- | 5 Ma | Miocene - Pliocene | Northward propagation of the East Pacific Rise into the North American Plate initiates rifting off of the Baja California peninsula. |- | 4 Ma | Pliocene | Sierra Nevada begins to rise. |- | 3.5 Ma | Pliocene | The Pacific Plate changes its direction of motion about 11 degrees east of its previous heading, from northwest to the present northwest by north. |} ==External links== * https://web.archive.org/web/20080808112624/http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~joel/g148_f06/readings/geol_history/geol_history.html * Dating of the Ages of Three Plutonic Episodes in the Sierra Category:Geology timelines Category:North America geology-related lists Category:Timelines of North American history Category:Natural history of North America Category:Geology of California Category:Western United States ",
