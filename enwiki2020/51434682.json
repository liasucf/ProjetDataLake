She married the Swedish Folkvid the Lawspeaker in 1177 and abandoned him to marry the Norwegian Birkebeiner B\u00e5rd Guttormsson in 1184. She is known for the lawsuits she faced to avoid having her second marriage declared void since her first spouse was still alive. ==References== *Helle, Knut. (2009, 13. februar).
