However the Women's International Squash Players Association (WISPA), refused to grant permission for her to play in the outfit. Her popularity and fame increased after the incident, though afterwards she stated that the whole idea of \"skimpy\" clothing on-court was a publicity stunt dreamed up by the members of WISPA. She went on to say that she was selected as the player to wear the clothing. She also said that this was not her idea at all, and that she did not think the incident would become so infamous. Botwright now works as a squash coach having retired from the international tour in October 2008. She continues to make appearances as a player in Premier League Squash in England. Vicky is the elder sister of Becky Botwright, who is also a squash player. ==World Open== ===Finals: 1 (0 title, 1 runner-up)=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |width=\"100\"|Outcome |width=\"50\"|Year |width=\"200\"|Location |width=\"200\"|Opponent in the final |width=\"200\"|Score in the final |- | bgcolor=\"ffa07a\"|Runner-up || 2008 || Manchester, England || Nicol David || 5\u201311, 11\u20131, 11\u20136, 11\u20139 |} ==Major World Series final appearances== ===Qatar Classic: 1 final (0 title, 1 runner-up)=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |width=\"100\"|Outcome |width=\"50\"|Year |width=\"200\"|Opponent in the final |width=\"200\"|Score in the final |- | bgcolor=\"ffa07a\"|Runner-up || 2005 || Vanessa Atkinson || 9\u20137, 9\u20134, 9\u20132 |} ==Quotes== Botwright stated the following after she was defeated by Nicol David after the World Open in 2008. ==See also== * Official Women's Squash World Ranking ==References== ==External links== * * Interview, April 2004 * Ms Botwright poses in the controversial outfit Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:English female squash players Category:Commonwealth Games silver medallists for England Category:Commonwealth Games bronze medallists for England Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in squash Category:Squash players at the 2006 Commonwealth Games Category:Sportspeople from Manchester ",
