    "text": "Philippus Lastric ab Ocevia Filip Lastri\u0107 (born Martin Jakovovi\u0107, 1700 - 19 April 1783), also known as Philippus de Occhievia, was a Bosnian writer and friar of the Franciscan Province of Bosna Argentina. His works include the first overview of the geography and history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. == Family == Lastri\u0107 was born in a hamlet called Lastre, from which his cognomen derives, part of the village O\u0107evija near Vare\u0161 in the Sanjak of Bosnia, Ottoman Empire. Christened Martin, he was one of at least four children of Jakov Ivani\u0107. The family was quite poor. His younger sisters, An\u0111elija and Lucija, lived in Kraljeva Sutjeska following marriage, while a brother is known to have required financial help from the already ordained Lastri\u0107. == Education and career == Front page of Epitome vetustatum Bosnensis provinciae Lastri\u0107 probably came to the monastery of Kraljeva Sutjeska between 1712 and 1714, as the rules of the monastery stipulated that the boys should be between 12 and 14 years old upon arrival. At the monastery, Lastri\u0107 learned to read and write in \"Illyrian, Latin and Italian language\", as well as the bosan\u010dica and Latin script. He became a novice in 1719, taking the name Filip. He continued his studies in the Papal States town of Narni, where he was ordained a priest in 1724. Lastri\u0107's career started in the Slavonian town of Po\u017eega, where he taught philosophy between 1726 and 1729. He then returned to Kraljeva Sutjeska, becoming teacher of the novices. He became custos of Bosna Argentina in 1734, and was promoted to provincial superior in 1741. As such, he was very vocal in defending Bosnian Franciscans and lay Catholics in Rome and Vienna as well as in Ottoman courts. He served as provincial superior until 1745. Thanks to Lastri\u0107's insistence in Rome, Bosna Srebrena was restored to the rank of province by Pope Clement XIII on 15 December 1758, a year after it was demoted to a custody due to the low number of monasteries and friars. Filip Lastri\u0107 died of a heart attack in Kraljeva Sutjeska on 19 April 1783. == Works == The surviving works by Filip Lastri\u0107 include a philosophy manual (preserved in manuscript) composed during his stay in Po\u017eega, four sermon collections, as well as an overview of the history of Bosna Srebrena. The latter, titled Epitome vetustatum Bosnensis provinciae (Pregled starina Bosanske provincije) and published in 1765, includes the first work on Bosnian geography and history. Lastri\u0107 also assisted foreigners in their writings about Bosnia, such as the Venetian Jesuit Daniele Farlati (Illyricum sacrum) and the Hungarian Piarist Elek Hor\u00e1nyi. Lastri\u0107's other notable works are: * Testimonium bilabium (Dvojezi\u010dno svjedo\u010danstvo), 1755 * Od uzame, 1765 * Nediljnik dvostruk: govorenja za svaku nedilju, 1766 * Svetnjak: govorenja za svetkovinu, 1766 == References == Category:1700 births Category:1783 deaths Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina writers Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina Franciscans Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina Roman Catholic priests Category:Franciscan writers Category:Christian clergy of the Ottoman Empire Category:18th-century writers of the Ottoman Empire ",
