Although she was classified as a secretary, she worked as a reporter and photographer, and is considered by some to be the first full-time television reporter in Omaha. For a portion of her time at WOW, she was the only woman reporter in Omaha. She was a founding member of the Omaha Press Club and also its first woman president. She left WOW in 1959 over a pay dispute, and then went to work for the Municipal University of Omaha General Printing and Information Office. She changed jobs several times, and the final career from which she retired was public relations spokesperson for the Immanuel Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska. She died in 2012 and posthumously received the Omaha Press Club Foundation Career Achievement Award. ==References== Category:American women television journalists Category:Women in Nebraska Category:1931 births Category:2012 deaths Category:People from Omaha, Nebraska Category:20th-century American journalists ",
