It was the first bank operating in British Columbia. It also operated agencies in New York City and San Francisco. Like the other Canadian chartered banks, it issued its own paper money. The bank issued notes 1852-1911\\. The end dates are the final dates appearing on notes, which may have circulated for some time after. The Bank of Canada was established through the Bank of Canada Act of 1934 and the banks relinquished their right to issue their own currency. It merged with the Bank of Montreal in 1918. British North America was the common name by which the British colonies and territories that now comprise Canada were known prior to 1867. Many Canadian banks disappeared as a result of mergers in the 20th century and by 2007, only five or six major banks and several smaller ones still operate in Canada. ==Branches== The Bank of British North America in Dawson, Yukon built in 1899 is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada.http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit-visite/affichage- display.aspx?id=11263 Bank of British North America The Bank of British North America in Winnipeg, Manitoba, constructed in 1903-04, is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada.http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit- visite/affichage-display.aspx?id=8663 Bank of British North America ===49 Yonge Street, Toronto=== 49 Yonge St; current building The first Toronto branch, designed by John George Howard was built in 1845 at the northeast corner of Yonge Street and Wellington.
