He was a good friend of Emin \u00c7\u00f6la\u015fan, with whom he had worked in the newspaper H\u00fcrriyet before they were controversially sacked by the paper's editor-in-chief, Ertu\u011frul \u00d6zk\u00f6k. As staunch secularists, both were critical of the Justice and Development Party. ==Personal life== Bekir Co\u015fkun was born in the Turkmen village of T\u00fclmen in \u015eanl\u0131urfa in the southeastern Anatolia region of the country.haberiniz.com.tr, 23 May 2013, Cumhuriyet'te Bekir Co\u015fkun depremi He graduated from Ankara's Y\u00fcksek Gazetecilik Okulu in 1974. ==Career== Co\u015fkun joined the G\u00fcnayd\u0131n newspaper in 1978. He joined Sabah in 1987 and moved to Hurriyet in 1993. In an article written some weeks before the July 2007 General Elections, he described AK Party supporters as \"men who scratch their belly\" (). After Abdullah G\u00fcl's victory in the presidential elections of 2007, Co\u015fkun stated, \"he will not be my President\", upon which the Prime Minister Erdo\u011fan retorted by saying \"he should abdicate his citizenship and leave the country if he doesn't consider [Gul] as his President\". This led to an outcry among supporters of secularism in the country that people who didn't share AK Party's ideology would no longer be welcome in the country. In 2007, after Emin \u00c7\u00f6la\u015fan left H\u00fcrriyet, for a while he considered leaving as well. In the meantime, rival newspaper and staunchly secularist Cumhuriyet offered him a position as one of their columnists. The absence of Co\u015fkun's columns for a period of two weeks in August 2007 was attributed by some to an imminent switch. During this time, Ayd\u0131n Do\u011fan, the owner of the most powerful media conglomerate in Turkey (Do\u011fan Media Group, which owns H\u00fcrriyet) convinced Cumhuriyet representatives to retract their offer. He resigned from Hurriyet in 2009, moving to Habert\u00fcrk shortly after, an episode he described in his book Ba\u015f\u0131n \u00d6ne E\u011filmesin (\"Don\u2019t bow your head\").Yusuf Kanl\u0131, 14 February 2011, Paying a price He left Habert\u00fcrk a year later in controversial circumstances, moving to Cumhuriyet in November 2010. The opposition CHP party claimed that Co\u015fkun had been dismissed from Habert\u00fcrk as a favour to the AKP, in order to benefit Habert\u00fcrk's parent company, Ciner Group, which was bidding on privatization deals.Hurriyet Daily News, 15 October 2010, Journalist Co\u015fkun dismissed to win bid, claims Turkish opposition chief In 2012 Co\u015fkun wrote a column for Cumhuriyet presenting \"an imaginary dialogue between a wolf and a tamed dog called \u201cPasha\u201d \u2013 a popular dog name and the Ottoman-era word for general. The chubby Pasha boasts about his comfortable life in the hut, but says that one must accept to wear a leash and obey their owner in return for the bones and cushions.\" The column was condemned by Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who urged the army to sue; the Army General Staff filed a complaint, leading to prosecutors investigating.Hurriyet Daily News, 9 May 2012, Turkish Prime Minister urges generals to sue columnistHurriyet Daily News, 18 May 2012, Columnist faces probe Co\u015fkun, agreed with Cumhuriyet newspaper between 2010\u20132013, then he wrote his articles in S\u00f6zc\u00fc on 14 March 2014.
