    "text": "Holonymy (in Greek \u1f45\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd holon, \"whole\" and \u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 onoma, \"name\") is a semantic relation. Holonymy defines the relationship between a term denoting the whole and a term denoting a part of, or a member of, the whole. That is, :'X' is a holonym of 'Y' if Ys are parts of Xs, or :'X' is a holonym of 'Y' if Ys are members of Xs. For example, 'tree' is a holonym of 'bark', of 'trunk' and of 'limb.' Holonymy is the opposite of meronymy. Holonymic/meronymic relations are considered from the paradigm of canonical/prototypical relations,See D. A. Cruse, Lexical Semantics, Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics Series (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986), 162; S. G. Pulman, Word Meaning and Belief (London: Croom Helm, 1983), 83-106; L. Coleman, and P. Kay, Prototype semantics: The English word \"lie,\" Language 57: 26-44. i.e. that which is considered an essential component/characteristic/part of the unit in question. Cruse uses the example of a \"door-handle\" relation compared to a \"body-ear\" relation: not every \"door\" has a handle, essentially (e.g. sliding doors, swinging doors), but every \"body\" (i.e. human body) does have an \"ear\". He refers to the former as a \"facultative\" relationship. A handle represents an optional relation. ==References== Category:Lexical semantics ru:\u041c\u0435\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c \u0438 \u0445\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c ==External links== ",
