After a close competition between England, Scotland and Wales, England won by a single point. Scotland and Wales followed with another point between them above Ireland who failed to gain a single point and only scored two goals. Wales and Ireland began the tournament with the Welsh winning a close match in Belfast. England played Ireland in the second game with the same scoreline, leaving England and Wales equal at the head of the table. Wales and Scotland drew a hard fought game before Scotland finished Ireland's tournament with a 2\u20130 win. England and Wales played a match in London in which a Welsh win would have given them the trophy but the English side was too strong and ran out 3\u20130. In the final game between England and Scotland a win for either side would gain them the championship but England would also win with a draw, a result they achieved at home in Liverpool. ==Table== ==Results== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==References== * Category:1911 in British sport 1911 Category:1910\u201311 in Scottish football Category:1910\u201311 in English football Brit Brit it:Torneo Interbritannico 1910 ",
