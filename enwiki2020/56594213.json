    "text": "Corys is a manufacturer of training and engineering simulators for the rail transport, energy and hydrocarbon industries. The company is based in Grenoble, France, and was founded in 1997. Corys is the acronym for COmpagnie de R\u00e9alisation Industrielle de Simulateurs - Company of industrial simulators production. The firm's capital is held by Framatome and French Electricity Training. It has subsidiaries in the United States (Corys Inc.), in China (HKD), in India (Corys India Simulation Systems Pvt Ltd) and Cyprus (HyperionRSI Simulation). British Rail Class 395 and British Rail Class 185 train simulators are supplied by Corys TESS. ==History== Corys was created in 1997 following the acquisition of the assets of Tractebel Engineering and Technicatome. The company is currently collaborating with Tractebel and Siemens on a project of eight driving simulators for the operators training of the Russian-designed VVER 440MW nuclear power plants in several Eastern European countries. In 1998, Corys TESS opened a subsidiary Corys TESS Inc. in Chicago to develop the US market, including a simulator for Amtrak's high speed Acela trains. In 1999, while it still remained primarily focused in the energy field, the company won several railway industry contracts in the United States and Australia. In 2007, it created a Beijing subsidiary called BKRT (for Beijing Keruitai; ke = science, rui = beautiful/timely, tai = peaceful/the name of a mountain) to develop a verification and validation simulator for the Ling Ao II power plant in Shenzhen. In 2008, Ralf Gathmann became the new Managing Director of the firm. In the same year, the firm bought our and merged Thunder Simulation Inc. (based in Saint Marys, Georgia United States) with Corys TESS Inc. in Chicago to form Corys Thunder Incorporation. In 2009, Tractebel Engineering withdrew from the firm, with Areva and EDF becoming the shareholders of Corys, holding 66% and 34% of the capital of the Grenoble-based company. Following this change of shareholders, the firm changed its status and became a simplified joint-stock company (SAS). ==Products== The company has three business lines: energy, transportation and the hydrocarbon industry. ===Energy=== Corys provides training and engineering simulators for nuclear power plants, power plants, power grids, etc. It designs, renovates and maintains i simulators, and provides provide training programs. The company is also involved in engineering activities for nuclear construction projects, in the design, testing and commissioning phases. It also develops of simulators for construction plants such as the Flamanville in France or the Taishan in China (China National Nuclear Corporation). By 2016, Corys had already delivered more than 180 power plant simulators and maintained more than 100 full-scale nuclear power plant simulators in the United States and France in operational conditions. ===Transport=== Corys manufactures rail driving simulators for cargo trains, TGV (a French high- speed electric passenger train), highways, trams, and subway trains. They produce simulators that represent the various rolling stock with computer- generated images designed with the Matrix 3D engine. === Hydrocarbons === Since the merger of RSI Corys, the company has also become a solution provider dynamic simulation to the industry of oil and gas. This includes the steps from process design to plant operation. The simulators are used for engineering studies, operator training and operations support for the upstream, refining and petrochemical industries. ==Structure== The activity of Corys is organized between the parent company and its subsidiaries. Corys Inc. handles North American customers for transportation, energy and hydrocarbons, while HyperionRSI Simulation (joint venture) is dedicated to the hydrocarbon industry. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Technology companies established in 1997 Category:Training companies Category:Rail transport in Europe Category:Transport companies of France Category:Organizations based in Grenoble ",
