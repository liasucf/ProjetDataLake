    "text": "From 1990 to 2005, the government and parliament of Galicia, Spain, the Xunta de Galicia, was presided over by the People`s Party (Partido Popular, Spain's main national conservative party) under Manuel Fraga, a former minister and ambassador under Francoist Spain. Fraga is remembered by Galician people as the man who built Galicia's economy up from nothing, but he is also remembered for his dictatorial style of governance. In the 2005 Galician elections, the People's Party lost its overall majority, while just remaining the largest party in the parliament. In the event, power passed to a coalition between the Socialists' Party of Galicia (Partido dos Socialistas de Galicia, PSdeG), a regional sister-party of Spain's main socialist party, the Spanish Socialist Workers Party) and the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG, a nationalist party). As the senior partner in the new coalition, the PSdeG nominated its leader, Emilio Perez Touri\u00f1o, to serve as Galicia's new president. ==References== ==External links== Category:History of Galicia (Spain) Category:21st century in Spain ",
