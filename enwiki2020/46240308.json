In 1807, she was stationed in Vlissingen under Commander Dupotet, in the squadron of Vice-Admiral Missiessy. She aided in the defence of Antwerp against the amphibious raid led by Chatham, and again during the Siege of Antwerp of 1814. After the Bourbon Restoration, on 30 August 1814, Charlemagne was transferred to the Dutch Navy, as per the Treaty of Paris. The Dutch brought her into service as Naussau. ==Notes and references== === Notes === === References === * Category:1804 ships Category:Ships built in France Category:Ships of the line of the French Navy Category:T\u00e9m\u00e9raire-class ships of the line ",
