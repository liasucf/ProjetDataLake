Raised in the small town of Lerdala, Sweden, SHY Martin first began writing songs and poetry in her youth as a means of self-expression. After winning a music contest at her school at age 17, SHY signed with EMI for a period though ultimately she decided to go independent. She decided to start studying at the songwriting school Musikmakarna in \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, in the north of Sweden. Shortly after she moved to Stockholm and signed to the independent label BLNK Music. == Career == SHY Martin first established herself as a songwriter, a path that launched in dynamic fashion via her co-write and featured vocal on Mike Perry's \"The Ocean (ft. SHY Martin).\" Recording the vocals in one-take in her home wardrobe, SHY wrote the track with longtime Swedish songwriting partner, SHY Nodi, whom she has written several other songs with. The track won Spotify Sweden's \u2018Most Streamed Song of the Year\u2019 with a groundbreaking 550 million+ streams. SHY's songwriting catalog has gone on to generate over 2.5 billion streams on Spotify alone including credits on \"First Time\" by Kygo ft. Ellie Goulding, \"(Not) The One\" by Bebe Rexha, \"All We Know\" by The Chainsmokers, \"I Wanna Know\" by NOTD (ft. Bea Miller), as well as songs for Jess Glynne, Astrid S, and ALMA, among others. In April 2020, Martin released the single \"can I call you back?\". James Keith of Complex UK called the song \"a dream-like flurry of breathy vocals, soul-touching songwriting and twinkling electronics.\" In addition to her artistry, SHY is also a member of numerous music industry initiatives, most notably joining Spotify CEO/Founder Daniel Ek and songwriter/producer Max Martin's coveted 'Equalizer Project', a group aiming to combat gender inequality in the music industry. SHY also participated in Bebe Rexha\u2019s 2018 'Women In Harmony' Dinner in Los Angeles, a gathering to empower female artists in music including Charli XCX, Kim Petras, and Avril Lavigne. She also performed alongside Matoma at the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize Concert. == Discography == === Extended plays === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Album ! scope=\"col\"| Details ! scope=\"col\"| Track listing |- ! scope=\"row\"| Overthinking | * Released: 7 December 2018 * Label: BLNK Records * Formats: Digital download | |} === Singles === ==== As lead artist ==== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Single ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| SWE |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"A Little Longer\" | rowspan=\"2\" | 2017 | \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Good Together\" | 79 | rowspan=\"5\" | Overthinking |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Bad in Common\" | rowspan=\"4\" | 2018 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Forget to Forget\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Lose You Too\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Just a Little Longer\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Out of My Hands\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 2019 | \u2014 | rowspan=\"7\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Same Old\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Make Us Never Happen\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Slow\" | rowspan=\"4\"| 2020 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Still the Same\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"can I call you back?\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Nobody Likes Moving On\" | \u2014 |} Notes ==== As featured artist ==== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Single ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| SWE ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| AUS ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| AUT ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| DEN ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| GER ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| NL ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| NOR ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| NZ ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| SWI ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| UK |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"The Ocean\" | rowspan=\"2\" | 2016 | 1 || 11 || 4 || 13 || 5 || 10 || 3 || 32 || 4 || 39 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Is It Over\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | DF |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Raincoat\" | 2017 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | Too Much |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Start It Over\" | 2018 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | Ninjawerks Vol. 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Keep You Mine\" | 2019 | 45 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |} Notes ==== Guest appearances ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em;\" |Title ! scope=\"col\" |Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" |Other artist(s) ! scope=\"col\" |Album |- ! scope=\"row\" |\"Painting with Dreams (Nothing Like Them)\" |2016 |Tritonal |Painting with Dreams |- ! scope=\"row\" |\"Perfect Touch\" | rowspan=\"2\" | 2017 |Josh Philips | |} === Writing credits === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year !Title !artist |- |2016 |The Ocean |Mike Perry |- |2016 |Summer Love |FO&O; |- |2016 |Perfect Touch |Josh Philips |- |2016 |5000 Volt |S\u00f6dra Station |- |2016 |Glad D\u00e5 |S\u00f6dra Station |- |2016 |Hatar att jag saknar dig |S\u00f6dra Station |- |2016 |Bara du som ser mig |S\u00f6dra Station |- |2016 |Inget kan ta slut nu |S\u00f6dra Station |- |2016 |Reflections |Dimitri Vangelis & Wyman |- |2016 |Is it over |Disco Fries |- |2016 |All we know |The Chainsmokers |- |2016 |Parachute |Galavant |- |2016 |Reflections |Dimitri Vangelis & Wyman |- |2016 |You on repeat |Jeremy Folderol |- |2016 |Taped up heart |KREAM feat.
