    "text": "The 2015\u201316 RFU Championship, known for sponsorship reasons as the Greene King IPA Championship, is the seventh season of the professionalised format of the RFU Championship, the second tier of the English rugby union league system run by the Rugby Football Union. It is contested by eleven English clubs and one from Jersey in the Channel Islands. This is the third year of the competition's sponsorship with Greene King Brewery, which runs until 2017. The twelve teams in the RFU Championship also compete in the British and Irish Cup, along with clubs from Ireland and Wales. Some matches in the RFU Championship are broadcast on Sky Sports. Moseley are relegated into the 2016\u201317 National League 1 after finishing bottom of the table. After seven years of trying for promotion (five of which they actually topped the league stage including during this season), Bristol finally did it. In front of a divisional and club record crowd of 16,084, Bristol managed to gain promotion to the Aviva Premiership despite losing 32-34 to away side (and league stage runners up), Doncaster Knights, due to an emphatic first leg victory, to go up 60 - 47 on aggregate. ==Structure== The Championship's structure has all the teams playing each other on a home and away basis. The play-off structure will remain the same as the previous year. The top four teams at the end of the home-and-way season qualify for the promotion play-offs which follow a 1 v 4, 2 v 3 system. The winners have to meet the RFU's Minimum Standards Criteria in order to be promoted to the Premiership. There is no promotion if grounds fail to meet the criteria. There are no relegation play-offs; the bottom team is automatically relegated. This the last year of a 2012 funding agreement with the RFU, where each club would have been given a grant of \u00a3380,000. Following claims, by Championship teams, including Plymouth Albion, that the current arrangement was not enough to sustain professional clubs, the RFU increased the annual funding to over \u00a3500,000 per club in a new agreement which will last until 2020. ==Teams== Ten of the teams, listed below, played in the championship last season. Worcester Warriors were promoted to the English Premiership defeating Bristol in the 2014\u201315 RFU Championship play-off final and are replaced by London Welsh, following their relegation from the 2014\u201315 English Premiership, after finishing bottom of the table and earning only one point. Plymouth Albion were relegated from the Championship after finishing bottom in the 2014\u201315 RFU Championship, ending a thirteen-year spell in the second tier of English rugby. They are replaced by Ealing Trailfinders who were promoted as champions of 2014\u201315 National League 1, returning to the RFU Championship after relegation the previous year. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !| Club !| Stadium !| Capacity !| Area !| Captain !| DOR/Head Coach |- | Bedford Blues | Goldington Road | style=\"text-align:left;\" |6,000 | Bedford, Bedfordshire | Nick Fenton-Wells | Mike Rayer |- | Bristol | Ashton Gate Stadium | style=\"text-align:left;\" |16,600 | Bristol | Dwayne Peel | Andy Robinson |- | Cornish Pirates | Mennaye Field | style=\"text-align:left;\" |4,000 (2,200 Seats) | Penzance, Cornwall | Chris Morgan | Ian Davies |- | Doncaster Knights | Castle Park rugby stadium | style=\"text-align:left;\" |5,000 | Doncaster, South Yorkshire | Michael Hills | Clive Griffiths |- | Ealing Trailfinders | Trailfinders Sports Ground | style=\"text-align:left;\" |3,020 (1,020 seats) | West Ealing, London | Danny Kenny | Ben Ward |- | Jersey | St Peter | style=\"text-align:left;\" |5,000 | Saint Peter, Jersey | Alex Rae | Harvey Biljon |- | London Scottish | Athletic Ground, Richmond | style=\"text-align:left;\" |4,500 | Richmond, London | Mark Bright | Mike Friday |- | London Welsh | Old Deer Park | style=\"text-align:left;\" |5,850 (1,000 seats) | Richmond, London | Matt Corker | Rowland Phillips |- | Moseley | Billesley Common | style=\"text-align:left;\" |3,000+ | Birmingham, West Midlands | Mike Powell | Kevin Maggs |- | Nottingham Rugby | Lady Bay Sports Ground | style=\"text-align:left;\" |2,000 (est) | Nottingham, Nottinghamshire | Daniel Montagu | Martin Haag |- | Rotherham Titans | Clifton Lane Herringthorpe Playing Fields | style=\"text-align:left;\" |2,500 Unknown capacity | Rotherham, South Yorkshire | Tom Holmes | Lee Blackett |- | Yorkshire Carnegie | Headingley Carnegie Stadium | style=\"text-align:left;\" |21,062 | Leeds, West Yorkshire | Ryan Burrows | Ian McGeechan |} ==Table== ==Fixtures== ===Round 1=== \\---- ===Round 2=== \\---- ===Round 3=== \\---- ===Round 4=== \\---- ===Round 5=== \\---- ===Round 6=== \\---- ===Round 7=== \\---- ===Round 8=== \\---- ===Round 9=== \\---- ===Round 10=== \\---- ===Round 11=== \\---- ===Round 12=== \\---- ===Round 13=== \\---- ===Round 14=== \\---- ===Round 15=== \\---- ===Round 16=== \\---- ===Round 17=== \\---- ===Round 18=== \\---- ===Round 19=== \\---- ===Round 20=== \\---- ===Round 21=== *Moseley are relegated after Ealing beat Jersey during the Saturday fixture. \\---- ===Round 22=== ==Play-offs== ===Semi-finals=== The semi-finals follow a 1 v 4, 2 v 3 system \u2013 with the games being played over two legs and the higher placed team choosing which leg they play at home. Both Bristol and Doncaster elected to play the second leg at home and therefore visited Bedford Blues and Yorkshire Carnegie respectively in the first legs on 1 May. The grounds of three of the teams met the minimum standards required to play in the Premiership next season. If Doncaster Knights are promoted they will initially play their matches at the Keepmoat Stadium, the home of Doncaster Rovers while Bristol will continue to play at Ashton Gate. Yorkshire Carnegie would have used their current home of Headingley Stadium if they had earned promotion. Bedford Blues did not apply to have their ground audited and, therefore, could not win promotion; if they had won the play-off final, the last-placed team in the Premiership (London Irish) would not have been relegated. ====First leg==== \\---- ====Second leg==== * Doncaster Knights won 44\u201334 on aggregate \\---- * Bristol Rugby won 90\u201335 on aggregate ===Final=== The final is played over two legs \u2013 with the higher placed team deciding who plays at home in the first leg. ====First leg==== ====Second leg==== * Bristol won 60\u201347 on aggregate ==Attendances== *Includes playoff games. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\" |- !Club !Home Games !Total !Average !Highest !Lowest !% Capacity |- | style=\"text- align:left\"| Bedford Blues || 12 || 31,333 || 2,611 || 4,341 || 2,077 || 44% |- | style=\"text-align:left\"| Bristol Rugby || 13 || 100,129 || 7,702 || 16,084 || 4,560 || 46% |- | style=\"text-align:left\"| Cornish Pirates || 11 || 15,705 || 1,428 || 2,340 || 1,025 || 36% |- | style=\"text-align:left\"| Doncaster Knights || 13 || 29,937 || 2,303 || 4,797 || 1,019 || 46% |- | style=\"text-align:left\"| Ealing Trailfinders || 11 || 7,338 || 667 || 874 || 310 || 22% |- | style=\"text-align:left\"| Jersey || 11 || 22,790 || 2,072 || 2,613 || 1,526 || 41% |- | style=\"text-align:left\"| London Scottish || 11 || 12,809 || 1,164 || 1,850 || 884 || 26% |- | style=\"text-align:left\"| London Welsh || 11 || 13,214 || 1,201 || 2,032 || 730 || 24% |- | style=\"text- align:left\"| Moseley || 11 || 11,509 || 1,046 || 1,431 || 726 || 35% |- | style=\"text-align:left\"| Nottingham Rugby || 11 || 11,202 || 1,018 || 1,864 || 623 || 51% |- | style=\"text-align:left\"| Rotherham Titans || 11 || 12,980 || 1,180 || 1,721 || 887 || 48% |- | style=\"text-align:left\"| Yorkshire Carnegie || 12 || 28,520 || 2,377 || 3,672 || 1,329 || 11% |- |} ==Individual statistics== * Note that points scorers includes tries as well as conversions, penalties and drop goals.
