Tajbeg Palace or Tapa-e-Tajbeg (; ; Palace of the Large Crown), also inaccurately called the Queen's Palace, is a palace built in the 1920s and located about 10 miles (16 km) south-west outside the centre of Kabul, Afghanistan. The once stately mansion sits atop a knoll among foothills where the Afghan royal family once hunted and picnicked. It should not be confused with Darul Aman Palace, which is about northeast from Tajbeg Palace. Built to house the Afghan royal family, Tajbeg Palace is one of the most impressive landmarks of \"Darulaman,\" newly created during the era of Am\u0101null\u0101h Kh\u0101n by a team of European architects in an attempt to establish a new seat of government and modernise Afghanistan, both of which ultimately failed when religious conservatives forced Am\u0101null\u0101h from power and halted his reforms. The palace was eventually used as governmental and military houses until it was damaged, leaving it in ruins. ==History== Not far from the castle or Tapa e Taj Beg (Taj Beg hill), a palace for the Queen of the Timurids is said to have been found a long time ago. Terraced garden designs were preferred by Timurids and Moguls, and today some ruins remain. The Timurids and their successors, the Moguls, have kinship relations with the Pashtun tribes of Abdali Durrani and later Yusufzai. The daughter-in-law of Ahmad Khan Abdali (the wife of Timur Shah Durrani) was the daughter of Alamgir II. According to some historians, the palace seems to have been renovated by Zaman Shah Durrani in 1795 (1210 AH), which was subsequently destroyed in military conflicts, and the ruins from ancient times remain. Foreign soldiers of ISAF have documented ruins of the former castle.http://afghanistanmylasttour.com/tag/tajbeg-palace/ 14th century Mongol ruins, the historical Taj Beg Palace On December 27, 1979, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics launched its intervention in Afghanistan. That evening, the Soviet military launched Operation Storm-333, in which some 700 troops, including 54 KGB spetsnaz special forces troops from the Alpha Group and Zenith Group, stormed the Palace and killed President Hafizullah Amin, who had resided there since December 20.Humanitarian Invasion: Global Development in Cold War Afghanistan by Timothy Nunan During the Soviet\u2013Afghan War it served as the headquarters of the Soviet 40th Army. The palace was severely damaged in the years after the Soviet withdrawal, when different mujahideen factions fought for control of Kabul after the fall of President Najibullah's Moscow- backed government in 1992. The Afghan government, in conjunction with the German government, have drafted plans for renovating the palace for official use, requiring funds from private donations from wealthy Afghans. These plans were on indefinite hold as the Afghan government seeks to establish peace and stability. A similar plan was approved for the nearby Darul Aman Palace which was completely renovated and opened to the public on Afghan Indendence Day, August 2019. The Palace is (as of October 2019) undergoing restoration.{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGyg- Wq0WVA&list;=WL&index;=10|title=Zaman-Tajbeg Palace Kabul - Afghanistan ==Gallery== Tajbeg Palace, Kabul - panoramio.jpg|Tajbeg Palace in 2012 Tajbeg Palace, Darulaman, Kabul - panoramio.jpg|Bird's eye view of the palace in 2012 The ruined 'Queen's Palace',Kabul -e.jpg|The ruined palace Queens Palace (5300182685).jpg|The ruined palace \u0414\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446 \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u044b \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u044b\u043b\u0430 27 12 79.jpg|Photograph of the palace's west side during the Soviet assault on 27 December 1979 ==See also== * Beg (title) * Taj Mahal * Darul Aman Palace *Bagh-e Bala Palace ==References== ==External links== *www.Darulaman.de \u2013 (At the moment only in German \u2013 English will follow.) *Qasr-e Taj Beg Category:Palaces in Afghanistan Category:Buildings and structures in Kabul Province Category:Houses completed in the 20th century Category:Royal residences in Afghanistan Category:Ruined palaces Category:1920s establishments in Afghanistan ",
