    "text": "Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is a Sri Lankan management group for the sport of cricket, first registered with the Ministry of Sports on 30 June 1975 as a national sports body. Initially named Board of Cricket for Sri Lanka (BCCSL), it was renamed Sri Lanka Cricket in 2003. The SLC is thus the apex national body for the administration and development of cricket in Sri Lanka, including management of the Sri Lanka national cricket team. Thilanga Sumathipala (currently Deputy Speaker of the Sri Lankan Parliament) was elected SLC President on 3 January 2016. ==History== Cricket was brought to the nation when it was colonized by the British. As everywhere that the British arrived in numbers, cricket soon followed and it is reasonable to assume that the game was first played on the island by 1800. The earliest definite mention of cricket in Ceylon was a report in the Colombo Journal on 5 September 1832 which called for the formation of a cricket club. The Colombo Cricket Club was formed soon afterwards and matches began in November 1833 when it played against the 97th Regiment.See CricInfo re this club and its ground; see also Bowen Throughout the 20th century, the game became increasingly popular in Sri Lanka. It was in the 1975 inaugural Cricket World Cup that they made their international debut. They lost to the West Indies by 9 wickets. They did however turn heads at the same tournament with an excellent display in their match against Australia. The national team won the ICC Trophy in 1979. On 21 July 1981, Sri Lanka was admitted to full membership of the ICC and was awarded Test Match status. The inaugural Test was played at the Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu Stadium in Colombo in February 1982 against England but Sri Lanka lost by 8 wickets. Sri Lanka won the 1996 Cricket World Cup by defeating Australia. Sri Lanka won the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 by defeating India. ==Domestic competitions== Sri Lanka Cricket oversees the progress and handling of the major domestic competitions in the country: the first-class Premier Trophy, the List A Premier Limited Overs Tournament and the SLC Super Provincial Twenty20. They also organize and host the Inter-Provincial Cricket Tournament, a competition focusing on provincial-level teams with pooled talent rather than on individual cricket clubs. ==Leadership== ===Presidents=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%\" |- ! style=\"width:50%;\" | Name ! style=\"width:50%;\" | Tenure |- |colspan=2 align=center|Ceylon Cricket Association (1914\u20131948) |- |align=center|Col.
