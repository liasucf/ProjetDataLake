    "text": "Tungsten(V) fluoride is an inorganic compound with the formula WF5. It is a hygroscopic yellow solid. Like most pentafluorides, it adopts a tetrameric structure, consisting of [WF5]4 molecules. In this way, each W center achieves octahedral coordination. ==Production== Tungsten(V) fluoride is produced by the reaction of tungsten and tungsten hexafluoride: :W + 5 WF6 \u2192 6 WF5 At room temperature, it disproportionates to the tetra- and hexafluoride: :2 WF5 \u2192 WF4 \\+ WF6 ==References== Category:Tungsten compounds Category:Fluorides Category:Metal halides ",
