This was the 9th season in which an NCAA ice hockey championship was held and is the 61st year overall where an NCAA school fielded a team. Clarkson completed the first undefeated season, going 23-0, since the inception of the NCAA tournament. As of 2016 only Cornell (in 1970) has been able to accomplish the same feat. ==Regular season== ===Season tournaments=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
