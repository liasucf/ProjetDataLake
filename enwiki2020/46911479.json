TV critic Alan Sepinwall wrote, with regard to the third season, \"Few sitcoms are built to handle the kind of provocative content that The Carmichael Show embraces as its reason for being... Carmichael not only keeps the jokes flying the whole time, but makes them better when it's at its most Very Special.\" ===Controversy=== On June 14, 2017, after mass shootings in Virginia and San Francisco, NBC pulled the original episode, \"Shoot-Up-Able,\" which saw Carmichael's character surviving a mass shooting physically unharmed but psychologically scarred. They replaced it with the episode \"Lesbian Wedding.\" That same day, Carmichael appeared on the Netflix talk show Chelsea, which was filmed after the shootings but before NBC had made the final decision to pull the episode. Carmichael told host Chelsea Handler that he hoped NBC would not pull \"Shoot-Up-Able,\" and that doing so would be a \"disservice\" to viewers. The episode was not centered around political discussions such as gun control, but Carmichael and his family afterward. It eventually aired on June 28. ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
