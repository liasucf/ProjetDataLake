    "text": "Trine University is a private university in Angola, Indiana. It was founded in 1884 and offers degrees in the arts and sciences, business, education, and engineering. Trine University is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC). ==History== Trine was founded in 1884 as Tri-State Normal College and retained the reference to the \"tri-state\" area for more than 120 years because of its location in Indiana and proximity to Michigan and Ohio. In 1906, the school was renamed Tri-State College, and in 1975 Tri-State University. In 2008, the school's name was changed to the Trine University, in honor of alumnus Dr. Ralph Trine and his wife Sheri. The dropping of the \"tri-state\" identifier reflected a desire to brand the school as a nationally competitive private university, not to be mistaken for state-funded or associated with businesses or organizations nationwide also using the term \"tri-state\". During the 1990s, the university opened several satellite campuses throughout northern and central Indiana. ==Campus== Trine's main campus covers 450 acres (1.8 km\u00b2) in Angola, Indiana. Graduate programs for the Rinker-Ross School of Health Sciences are housed at Trine's Health Sciences Education Center in Fort Wayne.

It launched a Master of Physician Assistant Studies degree in fall 2018 and is planning a major expansion to its health sciences programs. ==Student life== More than 2,000 students live on the main campus. 26% of male and 19% of female undergraduates are involved in Greek life.
