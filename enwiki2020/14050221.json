    "text": "Antonia Bertucci-Pinelli (died c. 1640) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. She was born in Bologna, and was instructed in art by Lodovico Carracci. She painted some pictures for the churches; among others, the Guardian Angel for San Tommaso; and St Philip & St. James for the church dedicated to those saints. But her most celebrated work was a St. John the Evangelist for the Annunziata, painted from a design of Lodovico Carracci. Her maiden name was Pinelli, but she married Giambattista Bertucci. ==References== * Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian Baroque painters Category:Bolognese painters Category:Italian women painters Category:Year of birth missing Category:1640s deaths Category:17th-century women artists Category:18th-century women artists ",
