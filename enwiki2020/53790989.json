The inscription reads; \"TABERNACLE Baptist Chapel ST. JT. Builders. 1837.\" The manse is attached to the chapel, which has a Grade II* listing as \"a little-altered example.\" The architectural historian John Newman describes the chapel as; \"a simple gable-ended building.\" It is constructed of Old Red Sandstone rubble, with a Welsh slate roof. The porch is 20th century but the doors are original. The interior has a seating gallery on three sides, supported by cast iron pillars. Newman reports; \"long rows of hat-pegs at both levels.\" ==Notes== ==References== * Category:Grade II* listed churches in Monmouthshire Category:History of Monmouthshire Category:Baptist churches in Wales ",
