In September 1941, while still under construction, she was renamed HMS Taitam. On 26 December 1941, still unfinished, she was seized by the Japanese after the Fall of Hong Kong. The Japanese continued construction and she was launched on 20 February 1943 and renamed W-101. On 10 April 1944, she was completed, commissioned, and attached to the Yokosuka Naval District under Lieutenant Commandeer Ginji Yamashita. She spent most of 1944 on escort duty and conducting minesweeping activities between Japanese controlled ports in the Philippines (Manila, Zamboanga, Basilan Island), Borneo (Tarakan, Laut Island, Balikpapan), Flores Island (Maumere), Java (Surabaya), and Sulawesi (Macassar). ===Convoy MI-27=== On 15 November 1944, she departed Moji, Kitaky\u016bsh\u016b destined for Miri, Borneo with Type C escort ship CD-61, Type D escort ship CD-134, and s and Cha-157 escorting convoy MI-27 consisting of four tankers (Awagawa Maru, Kyokuun Maru, Osakasan Maru, and Enkei Maru) and six transport/cargo ships (, Shoho Maru, Matsuura Maru, , Koshu Maru, and Chinkai Maru). Enkei Maru and Kyokuun Maru developed mechanical problems and were forced to return to Moji. The convoy was running parallel to Convoy Hi-81 which had left Imari on 14 November 1944 destined for Formosa to benefit from air cover provided by HI-81's escort carrier which was carrying fourteen Nakajima B5N \"Kate\" torpedo bombers of the 931st Air Squadron, Saeki Naval Air Station. The two convoys converged together at times. On 17 November 1944, in the Yellow Sea off Cheju Island, MI-27 was spotted by US submarines and which were operating in a wolfpack with . Sunfish torpedoed and damaged both Edogawa Maru and Seisho Maru while Peto torpedoed and sank Osakasan Maru (killing 142). Nearby, Spadefish spotted Shin'y\u014d of HI-81 and fired six torpedoes four of which hit causing the carrier to burst into flames and sink (killing 1,130). W-101 and CD-61 were unattached from MI-27 to pick up survivors. On 18 November 1944, Sunfish torpedoed and sank the damaged Seisho Maru (killing 448) and the damaged Edogawa Maru (killing 2,083); while Peto torpedoed and sank Chinkai Maru (killing 39). After losing four of the eight ships being escorted, the remainder of convoy MI-27 arrived at Sijiao Island on 19 November 1944. ===Convoy Tama-33=== On 30 November 1944, W-101 departed Takao for Manila escorting landing craft depot ships and Kibitsu Maru along with escorts , the Daito, and four Type D escort ships (CD-14, CD-16, CD-46, and CD-134). The convoy diverted and disembarked its troops at San Fernando, Luzon due to enemy air attacks at Manila. ===Convoy HI-85=== On 29 December 1944, she joined convoy HI-85 in the South China Sea consisting of the light cruiser , two Ukuru-class escort ships (Ukuru and Daito), and three Type C escort ships (CD-23, CD-27, CD-51) in escorting nine tankers (Enkei Maru, Yamazawa Maru, Engen Maru, Encho Maru, Daigyo Maru, Otususan Maru, Fuei Maru, Oei Maru, Seria Maru) and one cargo ship (Shinyu Maru). After several unsuccessful attacks by B-24 Liberator bombers, the convoy arrived at Cap Saint-Jacques on 4 January 1945. ===Demise=== On 11 January 1945, W-101 along with CD-35, CD-43, patrol boat No. 103, and subchaser CH-31 left Cap Saint Jacques escorting convoy SATA-05 consisting of two transports (Kensei Maru, Toyo Maru), a (T-149), and three tankers (Ayayuki Maru, Koshin Maru, Eihi Maru) (T-149 was unable to handle the heavy seas and returned to Cap St Jacques). On 12 January 1945, off Cap Padaran (south of Phan Rang\u2013Th\u00e1p Ch\u00e0m) in the South China Sea (), W-101 was attacked and sunk by aircraft from Vice Admiral John S.
