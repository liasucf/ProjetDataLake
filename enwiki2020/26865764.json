Population: ==History== Sablino railway station in the 1860s Until 1922, the name of Ulyanovka was Sablino. In the 1900s, Sablino was a summer house settlement, a part of Tsarskoselsky Uyezd of Saint Petersburg Governorate. In 1918, Sablino split off Tosnenskaya Volost and became the center of Sablinskaya Volost. On November 20, 1918 the uyezd was renamed Detskoselsky. Sablino was renamed Ulyanovka in 1922 after Vladimir Lenin whose original surname was Ulyanov. On August 12, 1922 Detskoselsky Uyezd was merged with Petergofsky Uyezd to form Gatchinsky Uyezd (since 1923, Trotsky Uyezd). On June 16, 1925 Ulyanovka was granted urban-type settlement status. On February 7, 1927, it was transferred to Leningradsky Uyezd. The governorate was renamed Petrogradsky in 1913 and Leningradsky in 1924. On August 1, 1927, the uyezds were abolished and Kolpinsky District, with the administrative center in the town of Kolpino, was established. The governorates were also abolished, and the district was a part of Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. Ulyanovka became a part of Kolpinsky District. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On August 19, 1930 the district was abolished.
