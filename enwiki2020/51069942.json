    "text": "Maqbool Sherwani (Koshur:) was a Kashmiri Muslim youth and National Conference member, who delayed the march of Pakhtoon tribesmen from Pakistan and rebel forces (of then Kashmir State) in Baramulla, in October 1947. In this manner, he played an important role in buying time for Indian Sikh Regiment troops who landed in Srinagar once the accession was accepted. ==Role in October 1947== Maqbool spotted tribesmen planning to invade Kashmir. He misguided them to a wrong path when asked to guide for road to Srinagar Airport. He was crucified by the angry rebel forces when they realised that he misguided them to delay their march. Maqbool Sherwani is considered as a hero and martyr of Kashmir in India by National Conference and Indian Army. ==Legacy== In his memory, at Maqbool Sherwani Auditorium and Mohammad Maqbool Sherwani Memorial in Baramulla, tributes are paid by Kashmiris and government officials. Balidan Stambh monument by Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry also has name of Maqbool Sherwani. Writer Mulk Raj Anand wrote an account of Maqbool Sherwani's story in his novel, Death Of A Hero. ==See also== *Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\u20131948 *Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir) *Mohammad Usman *Rajinder Singh (brigadier) *Abdul Hamid (soldier) *Jammu & Kashmir National Conference *Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)#End of the princely state *Kashmir conflict#Accession == References == Category:Year of birth missing Category:1947 deaths Category:People of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 Category:Jammu and Kashmir (princely state) Category:Kashmir conflict ",
