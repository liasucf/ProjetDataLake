    "text": "Observational comedy is a form of humor based on the commonplace aspects of everyday life. It is one of the main types of humor in stand-up comedy. In an observational comedy act, the comedian \"makes an observation about something from the backwaters of life, an everyday phenomenon that is rarely noticed or discussed.\" The humor is based on the premise of \"Have you ever noticed?\" (or \"Did you ever notice?\"), which has become a comedy clich\u00e9. \"Observational humor usually takes the form of long monologs of personal narrative; the punchline is either hard to predict or never came.\" ==Overview== British comedians Richard Herring and Jo Caulfield wrote in an article that observational comedy \"essentially involves saying 'Did you ever notice?' and then recounting something that will hopefully be universally familiar, but that won't necessarily have been consciously noted by your audience. If it's too obvious an observation it won't be funny (Have you ever noticed how buses always come in threes? Yes.) and if it's too oblique then it won't hit home.\" Eddie Izzard noted that a comedian's observations \"need to be something that people can relate to, for the audience to pick up on it\" in order to be considered a successful observational comedy act. Douglas Coupland writes, \"Anybody can describe a pre-moistened towelette to you, but it takes a good observational comedian to tell you what, exactly is the 'deal' with them.\" He adds that observational comedy first of all depends on a \"lone noble comedian adrift in the modern world, observing the unobservable-those banalities and fragments of minutiae lurking just below the threshold of perception: Cineplex candy; remote control units.\" Observational comedy has been compared to sociology. ==History== Although observational comedy became popular in the United States in the 1950s, one author suggests that it \"has never been particularly new. Even the more 'old-fashioned' jokes it supposedly replaced were often themselves disguised commentaries based on observing human nature.\" Comedians, however, have long been making observational comedy, though it may not have been called that before 1950. Will Rogers, who was similar to Mark Twain in that his comedic styles observed American plainsman and made fun of him, said, \"I just watch the government, and report their activities.\" Shelley Berman was one of the pioneers in the field. David Brenner's \"brand of observational comedy became a staple for other standups\", like Jerry Seinfeld, who has been called \"the master of observational comedy\". Seinfeld's \"brand of accessible, refined observational humor largely defined 1980s comedy.\" A 1989 Los Angeles Times article wrote that Seinfeld is \"clearly the standard of excellence in observational comedy\", while Judd Apatow called Seinfeld \"the greatest observational comedian who ever lived\". George Carlin was a significant figure in observational comedy since the 1960s and influenced Seinfeld. The British observational comedy tradition began with the Irish comedian Dave Allen's performances in the early 1970s. ==Notable observational comedians== * Amanullah * Dave Allen * Woody Allen * Trevor Noah * Dimitrije Banjac * Carl Barron * Shelley Berman * Danny Bhoy * Ed Byrne * Jo Brand * David Brenner * Hannibal Buress * Bill Burr * Sid Caesar * George Carlin * Jim Carrey * Dave Chappelle * Louis C.K. * Dane Cook * Sir Billy Connolly * Bill Cosby * Larry David * Ellen DeGeneres * Gad Elmaleh * Wayne Federman * Craig Ferguson * Jim Gaffigan * Ricky Gervais * Eddie Griffin * Mitch Hedberg * Bill Hicks * Gabriel Iglesias * Jim Jefferies * Richard Jeni * Kim Joon-ho * Peter Kay * Trey Kennedy * Jay Leno * Ash Lieb * Norm Macdonald * Sebastian Maniscalco * Marc Maron * Demetri Martin * Jackie Mason * Michael McIntyre * Rick Mercer * Sarah Millican * Bo Burnham * John Mulaney * Eddie Murphy * Dara \u00d3 Briain * Jack Paar * Russell Peters * John Pinette * Paula Poundstone * Richard Pryor * Brian Regan * Don Rickles * Joan Rivers * Chris Rock * Joe Rogan * Will Rogers (plainsman) * Ray Romano * Jerry Seinfeld * Daren Streblow * Bernie Mac * Yoo Jae Suk * Chris Tucker * Robin Williams * Victoria Wood * Steven Wright * Jose Manalo * Vic Sotto * Allan K. * Pete Davidson * Jimeoin ==Criticism of the term== Richard Zoglin considers the term \"observational comedy\" misleading because it is not \"about politics or social issues or the comedian's own autobiography, but simply about everyday life.\" ==References== Category:Comedy genres Category:Observation Category:Stand-up comedy ",
