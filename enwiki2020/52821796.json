    "text": "Weightlifting was part of the 2009 National Games of China held in Shandong. Men competed in eight and women in seven weight classes. The competition program at the National Games mirrors that of the Olympic Games as only medals for the total achieved are awarded, but not for individual lifts in either the snatch or clean and jerk. Likewise an athlete failing to register a snatch result cannot advance to the clean and jerk. ==Medal summary== ===Men=== {| |- |56 kg |Long Qingquan Hunan ||302 kg |Li Lizhi PLA ||293 kg |Wu Jingbiao PLA ||293 kg |- |62 kg |Yang Fan Hunan ||326 kg |Ding Jianjun Fujian ||317 kg |Qiu Le Guangxi ||315 kg |- |69 kg |Liao Hui PLA ||358 kg |Tang Deshang Zhejiang ||341 kg |Lin Qingfeng Fujian ||332 kg |- |77 kg |Su Dajin PLA ||374 kg |L\u00fc Xiaojun Tianjin ||373 kg |Li Hongli Guangdong ||365 kg |- |85 kg |Lu Yong Guangxi ||376 kg |Song Jiawen Guangdong ||360 kg |Kong Xu Beijing ||356 kg |- |94 kg |He Shuyong Shandong ||392 kg |Jiang Hairong Guangdong ||391 kg |Yuan Aijun Jiangsu ||386 kg |- |105 kg |Yang Zhe Shandong ||402 kg |Wang Hailong Heilongjiang ||393 kg |Zhang Lixiong Hebei ||390 kg |- |105+ kgDong Feng of Liaoning originally won the silver medal with 438 kg but was later disqualified for doping.
