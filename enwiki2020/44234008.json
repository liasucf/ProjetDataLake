    "text": "Aberdovey Lifeboat Station (Welsh: Aberdyfi) is an RNLI lifeboat station in the coastal village of Aberdyfi, Gwynedd, West Wales, on the Dyfi estuary in Cardigan Bay. It was established in 1853, but there has been a lifeboat serving the village since 1837. Since 1998 the station has operated an inshore lifeboat, RNLB Sandwell Lifeline (B-758), launched by tractor. ==History== The first Aberdyfi lifeboat was bought in 1837. The RNLI took over the station in 1853 and in 1858 built a new boathouse for the lifeboat and carriage. A tragedy occurred in 1862 when crew member Owen Owen, aged 33, died as a result of a capsize on exercise. In February 1863 David Williams was awarded a Silver Medal for putting out to the stranded brig Friends and his crew were voted \u00a38 reward by the Institution. In September the same year the RNLI voted to reward the crew of the lifeboat \u00a34 10s for rescuing six crew of the stranded barque William Bromham. In 1886 a plot was bought for \u00a3150 and a new boathouse built for \u00a3320. There was a second tragedy in 1898 when crew member John Price, aged 72, lost his life trying to save people after a boating accident. His dependants were awarded \u00a350 compensation by the RNLI\u2019s Committee of Management. A slipway for the lifeboat was built at a cost of \u00a3300 in 1903 to enable the lifeboat to be launched into the river. The station closed in 1931, but was reopened in 1963 at the Outward Bound Sea School as an inshore station supplied with a D-class lifeboat, which in 1974 was replaced by an lifeboat. A new boathouse was built in 1991 to house the Atlantic 21 and its launching tractor, a shop and crew facilities, and in 1995 an upper floor was built to provide a crew room, galley and store. Since 1998 the station has operated an inshore lifeboat, RNLB Sandwell Lifeline (B-758), launched by tractor, and making an average of 25 emergency launches a year. She replaced B-559 which has transferred to the British Virgin Islands as a rescue craft. ==Fleet== ===All Weather lifeboats (ALBs)=== {|class=\"wikitable\" ! Dates in service ! Class ! ON ! Name !
