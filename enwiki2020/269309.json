Its capital was Bra\u0219ov. Its territory included the part of the old region of \u021aara B\u00e2rsei. The county's territory was enlarged as a result of the administrative reform of 1925. Its territory covered the eastern part of today's Bra\u015fov County, and the south of today's Covasna County. It was bordered on the west by the counties of F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 and Muscel, to the north by Trei Scaune County, to the east by Buz\u0103u County, and to the south by the counties of Prahova and D\u00e2mbovi\u021ba. ===History=== Prior to World War I, the territory of the county belonged to Austria-Hungary and was identical with the Brass\u00f3 County of the Kingdom of Hungary. The territory of Bra\u0219ov County was transferred to Romania from Hungary as successor state to Austria-Hungary in 1920 under the Treaty of Trianon. In 1938, King Carol II promulgated a new Constitution, and subsequently he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. 10 \u021binuturi (approximate translation: \"lands\") were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by reziden\u021bi regali (approximate translation: \"Royal Residents\") - appointed directly by the King - instead of the prefects. Bra\u0219ov County became part of \u021ainutul Arge\u0219. In 1940, part of the county was transferred back to Hungary with the rest of Northern Transylvania under the Second Vienna Award. Beginning in 1944, Romanian forces with Soviet assistance recaptured the ceded territory and reintegrated it into Romania. Romanian jurisdiction over the entire county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. The county was disestablished by the communist government of Romania in 1950, and re-established in 1968 when Romania restored the county administrative system. ===Administration=== Map of Bra\u0219ov County as constituted in 1938. Until the administrative reform of 1925, Brasov County was divided into three administrative districts (pl\u0103\u1e63i), 23 rural communes, and one urban commune (Bra\u0219ov). After 1925, the area of the county was similarly divided into three districts:Portretul Rom\u00e2niei Interbelice - Jude\u021bul Bra\u0219ov #Plasa Bran, headquartered at Bran #Plasa Buz\u0103ul Ardelean, headquartered at \u00centorsura Buz\u0103ului #Plasa S\u0103cele (previously named Plasa Bra\u0219ov), headquartered at Prejmer Plasa Bran included the following settlements: Bran, Codlea, Cristian, Fundata, Ghimbav, H\u0103lchiu, Holbav, M\u0103gura, Moieciul de Jos, Moieciul de Sus, Pe\u0219tera, Poiana M\u0103rului, Predeal, R\u00e2\u0219nov, Satu Nou, Simon, Sohodol, \u0218irnea, Tohanu Nou, Tohanu Vechi, \u021a\u00e2n\u021bari, Vl\u0103deni, Vulcan, and Z\u0103rne\u0219ti.
