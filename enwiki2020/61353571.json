Perrine, in 1893, made an acknowledgement of gifts to Stanford's Electrical Engineering Department in The Stanford Daily. Professor F.A.C. Perrine was the first faculty to teach the subject of electrical engineering at Stanford. In 1894, the first undergraduate degree in electrical engineering was awarded. Lucien Howard Gilmore of Capron, Illinois was the recipient. Prior to 1894, electrical engineering had been taught as part of the Physics and Mechanical Engineering curriculum. With the advancement of electricity, industry and employment opportunities were plentiful for those with knowledge in the subject. In 1899, Standard Electrical Company completed one of the world's longest transmission lines. Professor FAC Perrine was the engineer, and the following year, he left academia for industry. In 1919, Leonard F. Fuller earned the first PhD degree at Stanford's Electrical Engineering Department. Fuller was Stanford's first PhD in any engineering discipline. Fuller helped advance the west coast's electric power industry, as well as communications lines. After managing the Federal Telegraph Company's plant in Palo Alto, he became professor, and chair, of the electrical engineering department at University of California, Berkeley. The Stanford University Department of Electrical Engineering offers bachelor of science, master of science, and doctoral of philosophy degrees. Degree programs offer some flexible options, such as: * coterminal BS and MS degrees completed in 5 years. * Joint programs: EE MS/MBA and EE MS/JD * online graduate certificates * and non-degree options. ==Research areas== Electrical Engineering is a broad subject. Stanford's EE Department presents their research in 3 core areas, and 2 interdisciplinary areas. * Information Systems & Science * Hardware/Software Systems * Physical Technology & Science * (Interdisciplinary) Energy * (Interdisciplinary) Biomedical ==Notable faculty and alumni== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! scope=\"col\" | Name ! scope=\"col\" | BS; MS; PhD ! scope=\"col\" | Notability |- | scope=\"row\" | Stephen P.
