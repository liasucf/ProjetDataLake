Best Picture was awarded to An American in Paris, which, like A Place in the Sun, received six Academy Awards. A Streetcar Named Desire won four Oscars, including three of the acting awards. The film's only unsuccessful acting nomination was that of Marlon Brando, whose performance as Stanley Kowalski was later considered one of the most influential of modern film acting. Humphrey Bogart was the last man born in the 19th century to win a leading role Oscar. An American in Paris became the second color film to win Best Picture, after 1939's Gone with the Wind. It was also the first film since Grand Hotel to win Best Picture without any acting nominations. ==Awards== Nominations were announced on February 11, 1952. Winners are listed first and highlighted in boldface. {| class=wikitable |- ! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Motion Picture ! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width:50%\" | Best Director |- | valign=\"top\" | *An American in Paris \u2013 Arthur Freed for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer **Decision Before Dawn \u2013 Anatole Litvak and Frank McCarthy for 20th Century Fox **A Place in the Sun \u2013 George Stevens for Paramount Pictures **Quo Vadis \u2013 Sam Zimbalist for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer **A Streetcar Named Desire \u2013 Charles K.
