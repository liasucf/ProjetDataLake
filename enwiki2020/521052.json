    "text": "Hippolyte Bayard (20 January 1801 \u2013 14 May 1887) was a French photographer and pioneer in the history of photography. He invented his own process that produced direct positive paper prints in the camera and presented the world's first public exhibition of photographs on 24 June 1839. He claimed to have invented photography earlier than Louis-Jacques Mand\u00e9 Daguerre in France and William Henry Fox Talbot in England, the men traditionally credited with its invention. Bayard experimented with the new medium taking photos of plant speciments, statuary (including posing with them for self-portraits), street scenes, urban landscapes, architectural photos, and portraits. He photographed prominent figures and an ordinary worker. He also advocated combination printing and was one of the founders of a photo society. ==Early life and career== While working as a civil servant, Bayard experimented with photography. He developed his own method of producing photos called the direct positive process.Hippolyte Bayard It involved exposing silver chloride paper to light, which turned the paper completely black. It was then soaked in potassium iodide before being exposed in a camera. After the exposure, it was washed in a bath of hyposulfite of soda and dried.Hippolyte Bayard Historic Camera Breteuil The resulting image was a unique photograph that could not be reproduced. Due to the paper's poor light sensitivity, an exposure of approximately twelve minutes was required. Using this method of photography, still subject matter, such as buildings, were favoured. When used for photographing people, sitters were told to close their eyes so as to eliminate the eerie, \"dead\" quality produced due to blinking and moving one's eyes during such a long exposure. In the summer of 1851, along with photographers \u00c9douard Baldus, Henri Le Secq, Gustave Le Gray, and O. Mestral, Bayard travelled throughout France to photograph architectural monuments at the request of the Commission des Monuments Historiques. ==Self Portrait as a Drowned Man== Self portrait as a drowned man, direct positive print Bayard was persuaded to postpone announcing his process to the French Academy of Sciences by Fran\u00e7ois Arago, a friend of Louis Daguerre, who invented the rival daguerreotype process. Arago's conflict of interest cost Bayard the recognition as one of the principal inventors of photography. He eventually gave details of the process to the French Academy of Sciences on 24 February 1840 in return for money to buy better equipment. As a reaction to the injustice he felt he had been subjected to, Bayard created the first staged photograph entitled, Self Portrait as a Drowned Man. In the image, he pretends to have committed suicide, sitting and leaning to the right. Bayard wrote on the back of his most notable photograph: ==Late career== Despite his initial hardships in photography, Bayard continued to be a productive member of the photographic society. He was a founding member of the French Society of Photography. Bayard was also one of the first photographers to be commissioned to document and preserve architecture and historical sites in France for the Missions H\u00e9liographiques in 1851 by the Historic Monument Commission. He used a paper photographic process similar to the one he developed to take pictures for the Commission. Additionally, he suggested combining two negatives to properly expose the sky and then the landscape or building, an idea known as combination printing which began being used in the 1850s. ==Famous photographs== Construction Worker in Paris, salt print (circa 1846) * Self Portrait as a Drowned Man, 1840. * Specimens, 1842. * Construction Worker, Paris, 1845\u20131847. * Self Portrait in the Garden, 1847. ==Gallery== File:Essais de photosensibilisation, Hyppolite Bayard.jpg|Tests of photosensitivity (1839) File:Hippolyte Bayard - Stilleben c.1839.jpg|Still life with plaster casts circa 1839 File:Bayard Self-portrait.png|Self portrait (1839/1840) File:Bayard Arrangement of Specimens.jpg|Arrangement of specimens, direct positive print (1842) Hippolyte Bayard Paris Montmartre c.1842.jpg|Montmartre circa 1842 File:Dame mit F\u00e4cher.jpg|Woman with fan (1843) File:Hippolyte Bayard - Madeleine Paris c.1845.jpg|Madeleine Paris (circa 1845) File:Arch and Picture Of Horse LACMA M.2008.40.195.jpg|Arch and picture of horse (1847) File:Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris pendant les travaux de restauration (1850).jpg|Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris (1850) File:Untitled (Family Portrait - People With House) LACMA M.2008.40.196.jpg|France, albumen print (1858) File:Chevalier, Pierre Michel Fran\u00e7ois, dit Pitre-Chevalier, Bayard et Bertall, BNF Gallica.jpg|Pierre Michel Fran\u00e7ois Chevalier (1861) File:Duchesse d'Harcourt.jpg|Duchess d'Harcourt File:Ernest Pinard par Bayard et Bertall BNF Gallica.jpg|Ernest Pinard File:Hippolyte Bayard 1863.jpg|Self portrait (1863) ==See also== * Bayard Islands ==References== *Gautrand, Jean-Claude and Frizot, Michel, Hippolyte Bayard.
