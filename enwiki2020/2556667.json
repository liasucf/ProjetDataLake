    "text": "Sand Point Sand Point is a community in the township of McNab/Braeside, Ontario, Canada, along the Ottawa River, roughly six miles to the west of Arnprior on the River Road. During the 1860s and early 1870s it was the terminus of the Canada Central Railway (subsequently acquired by the Canadian Pacific Railway). At one point Sand Point boasted a hotel, a dance hall, a general store, and a post office. == Sand Point Ferry Norvic == For decades Sand Point was the Ontario terminus of the Sand Point, Ontario-Norway Bay, Quebec ferry which provided access to the CPR and Anrprior. From 1923 to 1963 the eight car ferry, Norvic, landed at the Norway Bay Wharf. The Norvic was originally owned by Colonel Courtney, and her father-in-law James Young, both of Ottawa, with Dudley Gamble as manager. The ferry was sold in 1963 to Mr. Charles Bond of the Bond Marina at Manotick, Ontario. Mr. Gamble who owned the ferry paid the wharfage fees charged each year by the federal government. Gamble died in 1966. The ferry has been revived as a tour boat in the 1000 Islands system. The boat was the successor to the old Norway Belle destroyed by ice when it was pushed off the Norway Bay wharf in 1919. The \"Norvic\" derived its name from its home harbor, Norway Bay, and its builders, Vicker's Marine of Montreal. Seventy two feet long with a beam of twenty two feet, solid steel hull with diesel engine, built in 1922.Some of the captains who sailed the Norvic were Captains Charier and Fleming, Dudley Gamble,the Bailey brothers, Jack, George and Lincoln and Jim McKnight. For those who are familiar with the Norvic, the vessel had a very distinctive and unique bow and stern shape. In approximately the year 2003, the easily recognizable hull of the boat was sited as the base of a refurbished yacht tied up at a marina on the Ottawa River near Rideau Falls. The boat was refurbished by Ottawa developer Bill Teron and relaunched in 1989. == Arnprior Golf Club == In 1924 several Arnprior residents began construction of a golf course and club on the hill above Sand Point where it remains a mainstay of the community. In 2018 the golf club was sold, and renamed to \"Sand Point Golf Club\" Arnprior Museum and Archives Post Card == Rhoddy's Bay == Rhoddy's Bay just west of Sand Point along the River Road is a popular summer cottage destination with great beaches and sandy river bottoms. In 2017 & 2019 the community experienced floods that were the worst of the Ottawa area spring flooding of those years. You can find a Little_Free_Library on Sullivan's Point in the community.
