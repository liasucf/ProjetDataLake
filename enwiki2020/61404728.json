    "text": "Bianca Michelle Devins (October 2, 2001 \u2013 July 14, 2019) was a teenager from Utica, New York who was stabbed to death on July 14, 2019, allegedly by Brandon Andrew Clark after attending a Nicole Dollanganger concert. She was dead by the time police arrived. Photos of her corpse were then allegedly uploaded by Clark to the internet, who attempted suicide following Devins' death but failed. The photos were widely shared, sparking mockery and sympathy. Clark and Devins, were already friends before the incident, although Clark at times called himself her boyfriend and reportedly \"wanted more\" from their friendship. The nature of their friendship is composed of conflicting reports, with some calling him a close family friend, while others fear he was exploitative towards Devins. Clark was often described on social media as a lonely stalker, obsessed with Devins, the latter of which he may have been. He pleaded guilty on February 10, 2020, although later revoked this. His verdict will be decided on October 30. Clark is facing 25 years to life. The case saw international mainstream news reporting. Initial reports were marred with misinformation and rumors regarding Devins found their way online. The response by social media sites to the spread of the photos, which was slow and inconsistent, was strongly criticized leading to Instagram to implement features in response. Legislation was introduced in Devins' name to further the moderation of social media companies. == Background == Its believed that in April 2019, Bianca Michelle Devins and Brandon Andrew Clark meet and kept in communication through Instagram. They later met in person, with Clark attending her high school graduation party. They were on friendly terms, although Clark reportedly \"wanted more\", something which Devins was aware of. He at times referred to himself as Devins' boyfriend in spite of her saying otherwise. Described as a \"close and trusted family friend\" by one of her sisters, the exact nature of Clark and Devins' relationship was a topic her and her mother, Kim Devins, had previously discussed. Police described their relationship as a \"personally intimate one\" while friends and family state that they were not romantically involved. Investigations of Clark's internet history suggested that he was possibly obsessed with Devins, searching her name and checking her social media platforms frequently as well as saving photos of her and repeatedly sending messages to her annoyances. There is no evidence that Clark was abusive, although one of Devins' sister noted that by virtue of age\u2014Clark was 21, Devins 17\u2014gender and \"his outright inclination towards violence\" he held power over Devins. One friend of Devins' expressed worry that he may have taken advantage of her\u2014sexually\u2014while they were high on drugs, which friends of her's said Clark would give at times so Devins would spend time with him. Clark lived an unstable childhood with his father being abusive to his mother, including holding her held at knifepoint for hours, when Clark was ten which lead to him going into foster care. People who knew him, including Kim Devins, described him as \"affable\", \"charming\" and \"polite\", although his childhood best friend called him \"obsessive\", noting fixations on Pok\u00e9mon and lolicon. During the time he met Devins, he was an admin of a Facebook group related to inceldom. Bianca Devins was a recent high school graduate who had planned to attend Mohawk Valley Community College in Utica to study psychology. She had struggled with mental illness, in the form of depression, anxiety borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Her isolation as a result of her caused her to seek refuge online. Devins often clashed with her father, who was described by her mother as \"emotionally abusive\" and from 2015 onward kept little contact with Devins. Those who knew Devins, described her as \"supportive\", \"kindhearted\", and \"occasionally erratic\". Her behavior did, however, arise concern from her friends who said she would often lie about minor details of her life, become paranoid and avoid them for weeks on end. She once confided to a mental-health counselor that she had fantasized about injuring herself via jumping off a roof. According to Syracuse Devins' had been dealing with the online harassment from incels for at least two years. ==Murder== Devins and Clark travelled to New York City for the night to see a live performance by Nicole Dollanganger. They met a male friend, named Alex, and smoked cannabis in the vehicle, which belonged to Clark. Clark witnessed Devins kiss Alex at the show, which she knew angered him. Devins eventually fell asleep in the back of his car, Clark then wakes her to discuss her kissing Alex. Devins apologizes but states that they're not in a monogamous relationship. Clark, unsatisfied with her response allegedly began to assault her and eventually continually slice into her neck with a long knife, he hid by his seat, killing her in a deserted, wooded dead-end road. Her body was left in the car and a bonfire began to be built by Clark. After Devins' death, Clark called numerous family members, in a manner akin to a suicide note, and allegedly took pictures of the Devins' bloodied body. All the people called then called 911. The images of Devins' body were then posted by Clark to Discord, at around 6:00. By 7:20, Police, who become aware of the murder through users on Discord, had received \"numerous\" calls, including one by Clark. He reportedly told the dispatcher, \"I killed my girlfriend.\" When police arrived he stabbed himself in the neck, all while posting more photos online; his attempt was unsuccessful and he was taken to hospital. By the time they arrived she was already dead and nearly decapitated. Clark reportedly spray painted a suicide note with spray paint he had brought. == Reaction == === Social media === The images of Devins' became widely shared on social media such as Instagram and Twitter. In response, Instagram and Facebook removed Clark's account (that went by the name @yesjuilet) and attempted to stop the spread of the photos. Facebook added images of the murder to a digital fingerprint database to prevent further distribution. The hashtag #yesjuliet was also blacklisted, while the Discord server that shared the corpse photo was terminated. Dr James Densley, a professor of criminal justice in Minnesota, said that the images held the possibility to cause trauma in those who viewed them. Devins' family became aware of her death through the images being sent to them and her stepfather\u2014who received the most harassment\u2014reported having flashbacks. Devins' \"e-girl\" style of fashion (pictured here, although the subject is not Devins) became a source of mockery on 4chan.After their initial posting, the photos gained traction on the website 4chan with hundreds of posts where users praised Clark for committing \"another 4chan murder\". Devins previous use of 4chan and \"e-girl\" image became a source of mockery for 4chan users. Users on incel.co also celebrated the murder. A video of Devins before and during the murder was also taken, that was falsely claimed to be uploaded by Clark in the hours following her death. The initial online discovery was clouded by misinformation, including tweets from a prominent Twitter users\u2014one of which was shared more than 16,000 times\u2014falsely identifying Clark as an incel, and rumors and such as Clark stalking her, Devins being asexual, and addicted to hard drugs which she supported through selling nudes; the latter was debunked by her family. Theories on if Devins' death was the result of internet harassment, and Clark\u2019s motives also took place. Youtube videos and Twitter and Reddit threads were dedicated to explaining the crime and Devins' history, respectively. Clark was often portrayed as a lonely, obsessed, stalker of Devins, who tracked her down at a concert and then killed her after she declined his sexual advances. #RIPBianca was used to express support, and discuss the murder's relation to similar stories as well as women's fear of rejecting men. A hashtag of her name was used to combat the photos of her being shared. #RIPBianca briefly trended on Twitter. Accounts promising to post images of Devins\u2019 murder in exchange for likes and follows and illegitimate fund-raising sites sprung up to capitalize on her name and death. Law enforcement, Dollanganger and Devin's stepmother, Kaleigh Nicole Rimmer, requested that people stop sharing the photos. Users who attempted to report them on Instagram found that they often evaded detection and were at times considered not violations of community guidelines, although a spokesperson for Instagram refuted this. Instagram's and other sites slow response to the photos virality was strongly criticized. It was reported that some images stayed on Instagram for as long as four days and Kim claimed that by September the images could still found on Facebook. Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley whose research focuses on digital forensics and image analysis, claimed that Instagram and other companies had the tools capable to deal with the spread and that their activity neared the criminal, despite a strictly legal perspective saying otherwise. === News reports and commentary === Similarites to the Christchurch mosque shooting, such as both men using the meme 'Subscribe to PewDiePie', were noted by commentators. By July 15, the story had reached the mainstream and was subsequently reported around the world. Initial reports of Devins' murder falsely described her as \"Instagram celebrity\", despite only having 2,000 followers. She did, however, have a reputation 4chan's /r9k/ board. Clark was similarly, falsely described. Reports regarding Clark's motive were conflicted and misconceptions such as Devins being decapitated were also reported. Many media outlets used the murder to decry the dangers of meeting people online, a narrative which Kim strongly criticized. Elizabeth Doran of Syracuse noted that the case was more closer to \"the well-worn story...of abusive male partners\". Queenie Wong of CNET, described the murder and the subsequent events as \"the latest example of the challenge social networks face in combating violent images and videos on their platforms\". Kelly-Leigh Cooper of the BBC described it as \"the latest case to place scrutiny on how social media companies police extreme content.\" In the same article, Densley, said the images exposed the \"weird incentive structures\" in modern social media and lamented how Devins lives in \"sort of perpetual infamy online every time her image is shared.\" Melissa Jeltsen of HuffPost, recalled that in the immediate aftermath of her death \"Everyone wanted [it] to mean something.\" The crime has been discussed as a case of domestic violence against women caused by toxic masculinity. Evelyn Douek of Harvard University drew parallels between the sharing of photos of Devins to the sharing of videos related to the Christchurch shooting, although she acknowledged that Devins' murder was different in the fact that it attracted far less media and public attention. Others have drawn similar conclusions with it being noted that before men repeated the meme 'subscribe to Pewdiepie' following the events. Clark's actions following Devins' death have been interpreted as a demonstration of control. Utica Police Sgt. Michael Curley, believed that Clark desired to \"generate attention and generate fame for himself\". == Aftermath == A vigil for Devins was held on July 15. Clark, pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, on July 29. In December, while at Oneida County Correctional Facility, he was charged with promoting prison contraband after a sharpened toothpaste was found in his cell. On February 10, 2020, before his trial, the accused changed his plea to guilty, facing potentially 25 years to life in prison. Devins' family expressed relief at this decision. Four days later, the video Clark took of Devins was publicly announced despite Clark's wishes. The video's existence significantly affected Clark's claims of blacking out and forgetting details of her death. His sentencing was originally scheduled for April 7 but was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 2, he filed a notice to withdraw his guilty plea, claiming his lawyer, First Assistant Public Defender Luke Nebush, had failed him. His hearing took place on September 30 and a written decision will be drawn upon on October 30. According to authorities, there is ample evidence that the murder was premeditated with knives, rope, and multiple other tools found at the scene of her murder. Investigator Peter Paladino believed that Clark committed the murder to differentiate himself from the other \"beta orbiters\". Paladino also thinks the attack was premeditated. Oneida County Assistant District Attorney Sarah DeMellier claimed that Clark has told \"different people in his life different reasons why he did what he did\". His mother, who criticized the prosecution for portraying him as a \"manipulative monster\", believed that his internet history, which included searches on how to find the carotid artery, how incapacitate or kill someone and general searches for choking and hanging was related to plans to commit suicide instead of being related to a plot of murder. He has formally expressed remorse for his actions. Kim Devins alongside Anthony Brindisi have called for increased monitoring of social media such as Instagram, who in response allowed users to block private messages from strangers. They also promised to share results of an audit, requested by Brindisi, to Kim in August, 2019, although by December, Kim had yet to receive the results. Brindsi has personally contacted the Federal Trade Commission and requested they investigate the case for full accountability. On September 21, 2020, Brindsi and Devins' family introduced \"Bianca's law\". The proposed legislation would mean that all social media platforms with more than $10 million in revenue and more than 100,000 monthly users would have to establish an office dedicated to identifying and removing violent content that violates the platform\u2019s moderation standards. Devins also started a scholarship in Bianca's name for students pursuing psychology degrees. ==Notes== ==References== Category:2019 controversies Category:2019 crimes in New York (state) Category:2019 murders in the United States Category:Female murder victims Category:Violence against women in the United States Category:Deaths by stabbing in New York (state) Category:People murdered in New York (state) ",
