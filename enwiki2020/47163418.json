The house was built in 1928 for the university's Eta Chapter of the Kappa Delta Rho fraternity, which chartered in 1921. The building has a French Eclectic design, a style popularized in America after World War I by returning soldiers and several photographic studies of French homes. The building's key French Eclectic features include a stucco exterior, a limestone entrance surround shaped like a basket handle, a stair tower, casement windows, and a hip roof with flared eaves. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 21, 1990. ==References== Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Residential buildings completed in 1929 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Champaign County, Illinois Category:Buildings and structures of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Category:Fraternity and sorority houses Category:Buildings and structures in Champaign, Illinois ",
