The 1st Squadron, 75th Cavalry Regiment (1-75 CAV) is a United States Army cavalry squadron established in 2004. It is the Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition Squadron (RSTA) squadron of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team \"Strike\" \u2665, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and performs reconnaissance and cavalry missions in support of that brigade. ==Activation== 1st Squadron, 75th Cavalry (\"Widowmakers\"), a RSTA, was formed under the U.S. Army's transformation in September 2004. The squadron was formed under 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team \"Strike\", 101st Airborne Division in place of 3-502nd Infantry. The first commander of the squadron was LTC Alfonso J. Ahuja with CSM Scott C. Schroeder. The lineage of the Squadron dates back to World War II, as the 705th Tank Destroyer Battalion which was attached to the 502nd Infantry Regiment. The motto of 1-75 CAV (Widowmakers) is ONE ROUND! ==Deployment and training== The 1-75 Cavalry deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in autumn of 2005. The squadron remained with 2BCT, 101st Airborne Division based out of Camp Striker. The squadron, along with the rest of 2BCT, patrolled Southwest Baghdad in an area known as the \"triangle of death\". 1-75 CAV is noted for locating and destroying multiple weapons caches as well as detaining several ranking members of Al- Qaeda in Iraq. In January 2006 the Squadron was moved to protect a deadly Main Supply Route (MSR) leading into Baghdad. While controlling this supply route, the squadron successfully decreased improvised explosive device and small arms attacks by over 80%, thus enabling safe transport of supplies and materials into central and northern Iraq. During the time spent on MSR security, the squadron suffered two casualties. 1-75 CAV returned to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in October 2007, and redeployed to Fort Campbell in late November 2008. 1-75 CAV deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in June 2010 and returned in April 2011.
