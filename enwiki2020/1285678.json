Another source from the late nineteenth century indicates that the Mi'kmaq named the area Magabegeak which means \"roughly flowing\".

The Atlantic salmon is mainly a fly fishing only, \"catch and release\" species; and salmon fishing in this area is highly regulated by the Province of Quebec, with special daily permits and licenses required.http://o249-saumon-b4h1.demo.lanec.com/en/regulations/catch-limits- and-catch-and-release It is recommended to inquire in the village of Matapedia for information on permits and guides. Public waters are available to anglers in the upper portions of the river. Limited-access salmon fishing, generally with outfitters or guides to the most productive salmon pools is made available to the public via a special annual lottery. There are still many private fishing camps on the banks of the lower river, such as Cold Springs, Glen Emma, Runnymeade Lodge, Restigouche Salmon Club and the Tobique, most of them owned by businessmen and large corporations. == Municipalities on watercourse == Matap\u00e9dia River crosses the territory of these Quebec municipalities: *Amqui (taking his source in Matap\u00e9dia Lake) *Lac-au-Saumon (where the river crosses lac au Saumon (Matap\u00e9dia)) *Causapscal *Sainte- Florence *Routhierville *Saint-Alexis-de-Matap\u00e9dia *Matap\u00e9dia (where the rive empties in Restigouche River) == List of salmon pools == The river exceeded its target for salmon management in 2018, and in July 2018 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks announced that in August anglers could keep their catch of one large salmon or longer in the Gros M\u00e9catina, Napetipi, Saint- Paul, Vieux Fort and Matapedia rivers.
