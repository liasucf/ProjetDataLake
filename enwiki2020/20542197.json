It was shot in a 1905-built house in South Los Angeles. The music video was nominated for Wide Open Country Video of the Year at the 2009 CMT Music Awards. ==Robert Plant and Alison Krauss version== ===Chart performance=== Plant and Krauss' version of the song initially failed to chart, but after winning the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, the song entered the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart at #20 (the virtual equivalent to #120 on the Hot 100) in 2009. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Chris Jones, in his review for the BBC, felt that the version by Plant and Krauss is \"completely improved\" from the original track. Thom Jurek wrote for Allmusic: \"Slow, plodding, almost crawling, Krauss' harmony vocal takes it to the next step, adds the kind of lonesome depth that makes this a song whispered under a starless sky rather than just another lost love song.\" The song features in the closing moments of the final episode of the USA TV show The Riches. ==Track listing== 2008 US CD single (Rounder RPAK102-R1) #\"Please Read the Letter\" (Radio Edit) (Jones, Lee, Page, Plant) \u2013 3:47 #\"Please Read the Letter\" (Jones, Lee, Page, Plant) \u2013 5:55 ==References== Category:1998 songs Category:2008 singles Category:Robert Plant songs Category:Alison Krauss songs Category:Jimmy Page songs Category:Grammy Award for Record of the Year Category:Songs written by Robert Plant Category:Songs written by Jimmy Page Category:Song recordings produced by T Bone Burnett Category:Song recordings produced by Jimmy Page ",
