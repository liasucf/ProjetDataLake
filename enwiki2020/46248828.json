    "text": "Thokar also called The Kick is 1939 Hindi/Urdu film directed by A. R. Kardar. Produced by Chandulal Shah for his production banner Ranjit Movietone, it had music by Gyan Dutt. The story writer was M. Sadiq, with cinematography by Gordhanbhi Patel. The cast included Kumar, Ishwarlal, Madhuri, Yakub, Noor Mohammed Charlie, Ram Marathe, Waheedan Bai and Dixit. Thokar is cited as one of the \"most interesting\" films made by Kardar for Ranjit Movietone. The other was Pagal (1940). The story involved a blind villager winning a lottery but he eventually realises that money can not bring happiness. Baburao Patel, editor of the cine magazine Filmindia, called it one of the \"good social pictures\" and \"the best\" from Chandulal Shah. ==Plot== Mohan is a poor blind villager taking care of his ward Radha, who is in love with him. The village tramp, Ramesh (Charlie) sells him a lottery ticket. To Mohan's astonishment, he wins the sweep-stakes but Ramesh wants his share. Ramesh takes Mohan to the city with the intention of getting his eyes treated. In the city, Ramesh deviously gets Mohan married off to a prostitute who is having an affair with Ramesh. When Mohan's eyesight is restored, he sees his wealth diminishing, and an adulterous wife. He takes revenge on Ramesh and his wife. Mohan finally returns to the village and to Radha. ==Cast== * Ishwarlal * Madhuri as Radha * Kumar as Mohan * Charlie as Ramesh * Yakub * Waheedan Bai * Dixit * Ram Marathe * Suresh * K. N.
