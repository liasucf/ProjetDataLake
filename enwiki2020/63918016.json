    "text": "Sutter Health Mills-Peninsula Medical Center (MPMC) is a 241-bed, not-for- profit general medical and surgical teaching hospital located in Burlingame, California. In addition to emergency and ICU services, MPMC offers both inpatient and outpatient services at its 450,000 square foot campus. == History == Originally founded in 1954 as Peninsula Hospital, it merged with Mills Memorial Hospital in 1985 and became Mills-Peninsula Hospitals. In 1986, Mills-Peninsula was a founding member of the California Healthcare System (CHS), along with local medical centers California Pacific, Alta Bates Summit, and Marin General. Ten years later, in 1996, CHS merged with Sutter Health. The same year, the Burlingame hospital became Mills-Peninsula Medical Center and absorbed all inpatient care; the Mills hospital campus in San Mateo, originally founded in 1907, became Mills Health Center and transitioned to an outpatient clinic. In 2011, the original Peninsula Hospital building was demolished after a new hospital was constructed to meet California's seismic requirements. == References == Category:Sutter Health Category:Hospitals in California Category:California hospital stubs Category:Teaching hospitals in California ",
