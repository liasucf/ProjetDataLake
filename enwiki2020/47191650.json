Holtermann's great-grandfather, Coert Holtermann, is believed to have first immigrated from Rothenburg in Germany to Bergen with his son Henrich Holtermann (1650-1730). They acquired citizenship in 1676 and became involved in trading. Hans Holtermann's father, Henrik Holtermann (1683-1728), acquired trading rights in Bergen. At that time there was no market town (kjobstad) in Sunnm\u00f8re and the Holtermans extended their privileges to Borgund and set up a trading post at Brunholmen that eventually became the nucleus of the town of \u00c5lesund. Hans Holtermann operated as a trader in Molde and later at Vegsund in Borgund (now \u00c5lesund).Dale, Bj\u00f8rn Jonson. 1995. \u00d8rstingar\u2014\u00e6ttebok for \u00d8rsta.

Cathrina, Cathrine) Hagerup (August 30, 1730 \u2013 1796), the daughter of Bishop Eiler Hagerup.Erlandsen, Andreas. 1855. Biographiske Efterretninger om Geistligheden i Trondhjems Stift. Christiania: Chr. T\u00f8nsbergs forlag. Holtermann was the brother-in-law of the magistrate Melchior Falch, who was married to a younger daughter of Bishop Hagerup. His son, Knut Holtermann, became a supreme court judge in Copenhagen (then also the capital of Norway). Holtermann purchased the Austr\u00e5tt estate in 1760 and settled there. Drawing by Gerhard Sch\u00f8ning around 1770 Hans Holtermann purchased parts of the Giske estate circa 1750, and in 1760 Austr\u00e5tt manor in \u00d8rland. Holtermann is believed to have paid 26,000 riksdaler for Austr\u00e5tt. The Austr\u00e5tt manor also included part or full ownership of a large number of smaller farms in the \u00d8rland region.Moe, Wladimir. 1920. Norske Storgaarder. 2nd ed. Kristiania: Aschehoug.

Upon purchasing the Giske estate (Giskegodset), Holtermann had also become the owner of Giske Church, and together with Hans Str\u00f8m he carried out a major restoration of the dilapidated building.Giske kyrkje. After the restoration, Hans Str\u00f8m had an epitaph written, including the following praise of Holtermann:Tenn\u00f8, Karl, & Knut Ekroll. 1914. Litt om Giske kapel. Tidsskrift for Sunnm\u00f8re Historielag, vol. 6 (Aalesund). Sikkert var gudshuset faldt, / glemt som det var alverden, / hadde ei Holtermann faat, / den gj\u00e6ve eier og v\u00e6rge, / reist dig til fordums magt. / Og kongen har arbeidet bifaldt. / Nu, o kirke, vil du, / frelst kunne synge Guds pris. (Certainly this house of worship fell, / Forgotten by the whole world, / A Holtermann received it, / A princely owner and guardian, / And raised thee to thy former might. / And the king approved of the work. / Now, oh Church, saved, / May you sing God's praises.) == References == Category:Norwegian businesspeople Category:People from M\u00f8re og Romsdal Category:Norwegian landowners Category:1781 deaths Category:1709 births Category:Norwegian people of German descent ",
