    "text": "Somewhere in the Sun... Best of the Dream Academy is a compilation album released by The Dream Academy in Japan in 2000. The compilation album contains the extended version of \"Life In A Northern Town\" and an acoustic version of \"The Party\" rather than the more common versions. At the time of its release, Nick Laird-Clowes revealed that the band actually had no involvement with the album, and he went on further to say that they weren't even informed by Warners that a compilation album was being made. His former label boss, Alan McGee, then of Creation Records, was the one who actually brought him home a copy when he was visiting Japan on business. According to Kate St John, around the same time that this album was being made, Warner Brothers were considering a US compilation album, but they and the band decided to re-issue their first album, The Dream Academy. ==Track listing== #\"Life in a Northern Town\" (Extended Version) \u2013 5:20 #\"Ballad in 4/4\" \u2013 3:59 #\"Power to Believe\" \u2013 5:15 #\"Lucy September\" \u2013 3:08 #\"Twelve-Eight Angel\" \u2013 4:20 #\"One Dream\" \u2013 2:33 #\"Hampstead Girl\" \u2013 3:41 #\"This World\" \u2013 5:07 #\"The Love Parade\" \u2013 3:46 #\"It'll Never Happen Again\" \u2013 3:32 #\"Love\" (Hare Krishna Mix) \u2013 7:02 #\"Indian Summer\" \u2013 4:55 #\"In Places on the Run\" \u2013 4:28 #\"(Johnny) New Light\" \u2013 4:23 #\"The Party\" (Acoustic Version) \u2013 3:32 #\"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\" \u2013 3:07 #\"Waterloo\" \u2013 5:03 #\"Lowlands\" \u2013 3:46 ==References== Category:2000 compilation albums Category:Warner Records compilation albums Category:The Dream Academy albums ",
