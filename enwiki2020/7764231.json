    "text": "Fran\u00e7ois Byssot de la Rivi\u00e8re (1612\u20131673) was an early figure in the New World, his presence being recorded at \u00cele-aux-Ruaux in 1639 when the Jesuits took possession of the property. He married Marie Couillard in Quebec on 25 October 1648. Byssot was active in a number of pursuits and his name is associated with some of the earliest land grants and was also a person of note in seigneurial justice. In 1661, he received, from the Compagnie des Cent- Associ\u00e9s, a concession in what is now Labrador. He may have constructed a post at Mingan. He constructed the first tannery and was granted some other important concessions in both fishing and harvesting seals. He had twelve children, two of whom, Jean-Baptiste and Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph, attained some notability in Canadian history. == References == * * Category:1612 births Category:1673 deaths Category:Canadian explorers Category:French emigrants to pre-Confederation Quebec Category:People of New France Category:1639 in Canada Category:Immigrants to New France ",
