The location is within the Lujeri Tea Estate, approximately , by road, southeast of Blantyre, the commercial and financial capital of Malawi. ==Overview== In March 2018, Malawi's installed electricity-generating capacity was , With peak demand of 350 megawatts and growing at about 6 percent annually, the Malawian grid has very little flexibility. This has exposed the country to severe, recurrent load-shedding. Mulanje Renewable Energy Plc (also Mulanje Hydro Limited), a private energy-generating company, domiciled in Malawi, contracted Gilkes, a British electric turbine manufacturer to build this power station, over a two-year period. ==Technical details== The power station is a run-of-river design which does not require a dam and therefore no need for a reservoir. There are three Pelton-type turbines each rated at . One was installed on the Ndizi River, during the first phase. Due to the water flow rates on this small river, only 1.65 megawatts could be extracted. The second phase included the installation of two more Pelton turbines each rated at 3.3 megawatts, across the Ruo River, yielding a total of 6.6 megawatts in new energy generation. The total output of the power complex is 8.25 megawatts. ==Construction== The construction budget has been reported at US$16 million. Construction began in June 2018 and concluded in April 2020. The power generated is sold to the national power distributor Electricity Supply Commission of Malawi (Escom), under a long-term power purchase agreement. ==See also== * List of power stations in Malawi ==References== ==External links== *Brief Description Category:Dams in Malawi Category:Mulanje District Category:Southern Region, Malawi Category:Energy infrastructure in Africa Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Malawi Category:2020 establishments in Malawi Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2020 ",
