    "text": "The Vitznau\u2013Rigi Railway (Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn, VRB), called the Rigibahn (Rigi Railway) until 1969, is a Swiss standard gauge rack railway that runs from Vitznau on the shore of Lake Lucerne to Rigi. Together with the Arth\u2013Rigi Railway (Arth-Rigi-Bahn, ARB), which runs on the other side of the mountain, and the Weggis\u2013Rigi Kaltbad cable car (Luftseilbahn Weggis\u2013Rigi Kaltbad, LWRK), it has formed the Rigi Railways (Rigi-Bahnen Aktiengesellschaft, RB) since 1992. == History== Share worth 500 francs in the Rigibahn-Gesellschaft of 31 December 1889 The Vitznau\u2013Rigi railway (VRB) was opened on 21 May 1871 as the Rigibahn and the first mountain railway in Europe. The first rack railway of Europe had already been opened in the quarry of Ostermundigen in 1870. The quarry was officially opened for marketing reasons only in October 1871. The Vitznau\u2013Rigi Railway was built by the engineers Niklaus Riggenbach, Ferdinand Adolf Naeff and Olivier Zschokke. At first it ran only from Vitznau (439 metres above sea level) via Kaltbad (1453 m.a.s.l.) to Rigi Staffelh\u00f6he (1550 m.a.s.l.). On 27 June 1873,The date 23 June 1873 frequently quoted contradicts the fact that the Federal Council did not authorise the railway company's board of directors to hand over the section of track for public operations until its meeting of 25 June 1873. \u2013 see: the railway was extended to Rigi Kulm (1752 m.a.s.l.). This section is located in the canton of Schwyz, for which the VRB had no concession. The track belonged to the ARB and was leased by the VRB. The line is mostly single track, but the line has been double-track since 1874 from the request stop of Freibergen to Rigi Kaltbad- First. The Rigibahn was only open in the summer in the early years. Winter sports gradually developed and operations in the winter commenced. The narrow- gauge Rigi\u2013Scheidegg railway (Rigi-Kaltbad-Scheidegg-Bahn, RSB) to Rigi Scheidegg, which was completed in 1875, began in Kaltbad. This railway was closed in 1931 and finally abandoned in 1942. The Weggis\u2013Rigi Kaltbad cable car (Luftseilbahn Weggis\u2013Rigi Kaltbad, LWRK) from Weggis, also operated by the Rigi Railways, has ended in Kaltbad since 1968. The Vitznau\u2013Rigi Railway (officially called the Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn since 1 January 1970) connects in Rigi Staffel with the tracks of the Arth\u2013Rigi Railway, which has operated from since 1875. The VRB used a track that ran parallel with the track of the ARB to the common terminus in Rigi Kulm. Both railways were once strictly separated and competitors. The only connection was a transfer table in front of the joint depot building on Rigi Kulm. It was not until 1990 that a connecting track was built between the ARB and the VRB in Rigi Staffel. This was the beginning of the merger, which was completed in 1992. The VRB switched to electric traction in 1937 and an overhead line was erected on the Vitznau\u2013Rigi Kulm line. The traverser in Freibergen was replaced by a rack railway set of points in 1959; the same occurred in Kaltbad in 1961. These sets of points were replaced by new systems in 2000 and 2012. In 2012, the station complex in Kaltbad was completely renewed and a second platform track was installed. The station building in Kaltbad was demolished; construction of the new building started in May 2014 and was finished in September 2014. The new Kaltbad station building was inaugurated on 1 March 2015. ==Technical data== The railway has the following technical data: Steam locomotive in Rigi- Kaltbad VRB train shortly after Vitznau Vitznau\u2013Rigi railway points in Kaltbad, state as of before 2012 Vitznau Rigi Bahn steam locomotive of the Riggenbach rack system === Electrical system === {| class=\"wikitable\" |Introduction of electrical operation |3 October 1937 |- |Equipment for electrical operation: |3 rectifier plants |- |Supply of three-phase current: |15 kV/50 Hz |- |DC voltage: |1,500 V |- |Power of the rectifier stations: |4,000 kW |} === Speed=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |Steam locomotives |9 km/h |- |Ascent: |18/23 km/h |- |Descent: |12/14 km/h |- |Vitznau\u2013Rigi Kulm travel time: |30 minutes |- |Capacity: |about 850 people/ |} == Rolling stock== * 1 electric locomotive of 331 kW (no. 18) * 4 electric motor cars of 330 kW (no. 1\u20134) * 1 electric motor cars of 752 kW (no. 5) * 2 electric push-pull sets of 824 kW (no. 21\u201322) * 1 snow plough of 309 kW (not self-propelled) * 2 steam locomotives of 340 kW (no. 16\u201317) * 9 passenger cars * 13 freight wagons, official vehicles, snow ploughs etc. == Notes== == References == ===Footnotes=== ===Sources=== * * * Category:Railway lines in Switzerland Category:Standard gauge railways in Switzerland Category:Rack railways in Switzerland Category:Railway lines opened in 1871 Category:1871 establishments in Switzerland ",
