He placed adverts in Billboard magazine reading \"RECORD COLLECTIONS. We BUY any record collection. Any style of music. We pay HIGHER prices than anyone else.\" and used agents to act on his behalf. He bought the remaining stock of 200,000 records from Colony Records in New York's Times Square after the store's 2012 closure and bought the stock of the Rio de Janeiro's Modern Sound store around the same time.

The records are cleaned and cataloged by a team of assistants that he has recruited but he is acquiring new material faster than they can work and only 250,000 records have been processed so far.

Freitas continues to maintain agents around the world, including in Mexico, New York and Nigeria. These enable him to buy a diverse range of material such as the collection of the late Bob Hope and the 100,000 albums of Cuban music he has acquired. His staff joke that the island of Cuba must be rising due to the weight of material that Freitas has removed. ==Future plans== Freitas is building a warehouse to store his collection which he plans to call the Emporium Musical. ==Business activities== In addition to transport, Freitas runs a business providing audio-visual systems for concerts and other public events. ==See also== * List of record collectors * LP record * Music of Brazil ==References== ==External links== * Brazilian bus magnate offers \u00a323,000 for Birmingham vinyl collector's stock.
