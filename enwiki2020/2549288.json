He was author of works on the history of ancient Greek culture and religion, classical education, and popularization of classical studies (published largely in Russian and German). He was professor at the University of St. Petersburg (1890\u20131922), and after Polish independence at Warsaw University for 17 years (1922\u20131939) during the interwar period. He was the recipient of honorary doctorates from the Jagiellonian University, Krak\u00f3w (1930), and twelve western European universities. Between 1933\u20131939 Zieli\u0144ski was a member of the prestigious Polish Academy of Literature. Although Zieli\u0144ski was active in many areas of classical scholarship, one of the studies for which he is best known in the west is his investigation of the prose rhythm of Cicero, published in 1904 and which is still often referred to today.Srebrny (1947 (2013)), p. 149. (See Clausula (rhetoric)). His daughter became wife of Prof. Vladimir Beneshevich, executed by the Soviet regime in 1938. Adrian Piotrovsky, his natural son, was arrested by the NKVD in November 1937 and executed.Clark, Katerina (1995) Petersburg: Crucible of Cultural Revolution, Cambridge, MA: Harvard, pp. 291-2. ==Works== * Cicero im Wandel der Jahrhunderte.
