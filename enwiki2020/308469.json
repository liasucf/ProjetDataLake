Very early he traveled in Italy and Europe. He entered the University of Pisa in 1922. == Meeting Gandhi == In December 1936, Lanza went to India, joining the movement for Indian independence led by Gandhi. He knew of Gandhi through a book by Romain Rolland. He spent six months with the Mahatma, then in June 1937, went to the source of the Ganges river in the Himalayas, a famous pilgrimage site. There he saw a vision which told him \"Go back and found!\" He then left India and went back to Europe. In 1938, he went to Palestine, then in the midst of civil war, to Jerusalem and Bethlehem, \"between two lines of tanks\". He came back to Paris at the time when the Second World War started. He wrote some books of poetry and in 1943 published the story of his trip to India, Return to the Source, which became a huge success. == Foundation of the Ark == He founded the Community of the Ark in 1948 which first met with many difficulties. In 1954, he went back to India to participate in nonviolent anti-feudal struggles with Vinoba Bhave. In 1962 the Community of the Ark settled in Haut-Languedoc, in the south of France, at \"La Borie Noble\", near Lod\u00e8ve, in a deserted village. After numbering over a hundred members in the 1970s and 1980s, some communities were closed in the 1990s due to conflicts, ageing population (under thirty members) and a lack of interest in their work and lifestyle. Since 2000, groups are present in a few regions of France, in Belgium, Spain, Italy, Ecuador and Canada.R\u00e9gions Community of Ark website. == Nonviolent struggles == In 1957, during the Algerian War, del Vasto started with other well-known people (General de Bollardi\u00e8re, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, Robert Barrat, etc.) a movement of protest against torture.
