    "text": "Sudhir Ranjan Jain(16 May 1963) is an Indian theoretical physicist at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Mumbai, known for his contributions in complex quantum systems and Nonlinear dynamics. He is a scientist at the nuclear physics division of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, professor at Homi Bhabha National Institute and adjunct professor at the Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences. He authored Mechanics, Waves and Thermodynamics: An Example-based Approach. His doctoral advisor was Prof. Suresh V. Lawande who was a student of Edward Teller. Prof. Lawande is known for his contributions in developing Monte Carlo methods in the evaluation of Feynman path integrals in imaginary time. ==Biography== Sudhir Ranjan Jain was born in Mainpuri, (Uttar Pradesh, India). He completed his Bachelors\u2019 degree from Hindu College, Delhi in 1983 and Masters\u2019 degree from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in 1985. He joined Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in 1986. Subsequently, he obtained his Ph.D. degree from University of Mumbai in 1994 under the guidance of Dr. Suresh V. Lawande. He did post-doctoral research at Centre for Nonlinear Phenomena and Complex Systems, Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles, Belgium with Pierre Gaspard, where he worked on Semiclassics of many-body Fermionic systems. He has been a Visiting Professor at Feza G\u00fcrsey Institute, Istanbul, Turkey (2008), Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9, Paris, France (2007), Institute of Theoretical Physics, Utrecht University, Netherlands (2006) and Institute for Physical Science and Technology, University of Maryland, College Park (2005). ==Research== Sudhir Ranjan Jain's areas of specialization are theoretical nuclear physics, semiclassical physics, and nonlinear dynamics. He is known for his work on many-body systems,especially for Jain-Khare models which gave exact quantum solutions with connections to random matrix theory, leading to exact eigenfunctions for a class of chaotic systems. The bosonised version of the Jain-Khare model exhibits Bose Einstein condensation. His notable works include his work on Pseudo Hermitian Random Matrix theory,Pseudo-Hermitian random matrix theory, S. C. L. Srivastava, Sudhir R.
