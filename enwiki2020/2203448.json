    "text": "Haycocknema perplexum are nematodes which reside in tissues under the skin or in blood vessels. The origin of these parasites and their natural hosts are not known at this time. This group is around 8% of nematode species which affect vertebrates. Clinical symptoms of this parasite include eosinophilia and high levels of creatine kinase. While rare with only five documented cases in Australia, this parasite can become fatal if untreated due to the muscles of the respiratory system becoming unable to function properly. The treatment for this parasite is 400 mg of Abendazole. This broad spectrum medication is an antihelmintic drug that can treat diseases by impairing the parasite's ability to absorb glucose, resulting in its death. == References == # Haycocknema perplexum: [Internet].
