    "text": "James \"Slim\" Hand (July 7, 1952 \u2013 June 8, 2020) was an American country music singer and songwriter. ==Early life== James Edward Hand was born on July 7, 1952 in Waco, Texas. He was raised in the community of Tokio in McLennan County, Texas, and took to guitar playing and singing when approximately twelve years old. He worked in various jobs, including horse training and driving a truck. About his work with animals, Hand said, \u201cPeople act like it\u2019s some big deal, like this whole horse whispering thing. But I\u2019ll tell you something \u2013 you can whisper to \u2019em, you can get down on your knees and act like \u2019em, but the horse knows you ain't a horse.\" ==Career== As a teenager, Hand joined a small band and began performing in honky-tonks near his home of West, Texas. At some point he started to write and perform his own songs. After years of songwriting and performing locally in obscurity, he released his first album in 1997, when he was 45 years old. In 2014, Hand played a fictional version of himself in the independent film Thank You a Lot. The Austin Film Society's website noted that Hand and co-protagonist Blake DeLong, playing his son, had a chemistry that was \"hilariously realistic\". ===Critical appraisal=== Reviewers have generally emphasized the \"authenticity\" of Hand's songs. His music reportedly can match the \"rigor\" of historical performers of country music, \"with the slightest touch of outlaw bluster,\" while his voice can be \"uncertain in moments.\" On the release of his first album, one reviewer wrote that Hand \"sings the songs as if he has lived every minute of them,\" while The Washington Post's reviewer called him \"the real deal,\" a view shared also by Willie Nelson. ==Death== On June 8, 2020, Hand died from complications of heart failure at Providence Healthcare Center in Waco, at age 67. ==Discography== *Shadows Where the Magic Was (1997) *Evil Things, on Cold Spring Records (1999) *Live From The Saxon Pub Austin TX, on Knight Klub Records (2003) *The Truth Will Set You Free, on Rounder Records (2006) *Shadow on the Ground, on Rounder Records (2009) *Mighty Lonesome Man, on Hillgrass Bluebilly Records (2012) *Stormclouds in Heaven, on Slim Hand Music (2014) ==References== ==External links== *Official website * Category:1952 births Category:2020 deaths Category:20th-century American singers Category:20th- century male singers Category:21st-century American singers Category:21st- century male singers Category:American country singer-songwriters Category:American male film actors Category:American male singer-songwriters Category:Country musicians from Texas Category:Male actors from Texas Category:People from McLennan County, Texas Category:People from Waco, Texas Category:Rounder Records artists ",
