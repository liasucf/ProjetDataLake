They play in the Lakehead Junior Hockey League and are eligible to compete for the Keystone Cup, Junior B Championship of Western Canada. ==History== The Thunder Bay Stars joined the Thunder Bay Junior B Hockey League in 2009. The team was formed after the K&A; Wolverines accepted an invitation to play Junior A in the Superior International Junior Hockey League. In both 2010 and 2011, the Stars finished third in the regular season, but managed to upset the second place Nipigon Elks in the league semi-finals to earn entrance into the league finals. In both cases, the Stars were defeated by the Thunder Bay Northern Hawks. At the end of the 2016\u201317 season, long-time Stars owners Dave and Scott Simpson sold the franchise to Derek Geddes. The team was rebranded as the Thunder Bay Fighting Walleye. For the 2018 season British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan elected not to participate in the Keystone Cup. As a result, the tournament was reorganized to feature the LJHL and KJHL champion and runner-up. Although the Thunder Bay Northern Hawks won the LJHL championship, the new format allowed the Fighting Walleye make their first Keystone Cup tournament. They returned to the Keystone Cup the following season as well, and then were awarded hosting duties for the 2020 tournament. However, the 2020 tournament would be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Team owner Derek Geddes also added a Junior A team called the Kam River Fighting Walleye to the Superior International Junior Hockey League in 2020\u201321. Prior to the 2020-21 season the team rebranded once again as the Kam River Pickerel. ==Season-by-season standings== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- \" bgcolor=\"#dddddd\" |Season ||GP || W || L || T |OTL||Pts || GF || GA || Results || Playoffs |- |2009-10 ||30 ||6 ||24 ||0 | ---||12 ||123 ||222 ||3rd of 3 ||Won Semifinals, 3-1 vs Elks Lost Finals, 0-4 vs Northern Hawks |- |2010-11 ||30 ||9 ||17 ||4 | ---||22 ||123 ||161 ||3rd of 4 ||Won Semifinals, 3-1 vs Elks Lost Finals, 0-4 vs Northern Hawks |- |2011-12 ||32 ||15 ||17 ||0 | ---||30 ||149 ||171 ||3rd of 5 ||Lost Semifinals, 2-3 vs Elks |- |2012-13 ||32 ||14 ||17 ||1 | ---||29 ||140 ||143 ||3rd of 5 ||Lost Semifinals, 3-4 vs Elks |- |2013-14 ||30 ||16 ||12 ||2 | ---||34 ||123 ||104 ||2nd of 4 ||Won Semifinals, 4-1 vs Elks Lost Finals, 1-4 vs Northern Hawks |- |2014-15 ||30 ||15 ||15 ||0 | ---||30 ||149 ||132 ||2nd of 4 ||Won Semifinals, 4-1 vs Elks Lost Finals, 0-4 vs Northern Hawks |- |2015-16 ||32 ||27 ||5 ||0 | ---||54 ||210 ||81 ||1st of 5 ||Won Semifinals, 4-0 vs Falcons Lost Finals, 2-4 vs Northern Hawks |- |2016-17 ||30 ||4 ||22 ||4 | ---||12 ||114 ||231 ||3rd of 4 ||Lost Semifinals, 1-4 vs Elks |- |2017-18 ||28 ||16 ||8 ||4 | ---||36 ||212 ||109 ||1st of 4 ||Won Semifinals, 4-0 vs Falcons Lost Finals, 1-4 vs Northern Hawks (advance as LJHL representative; Northern Hawks are host) |- |2018\u201319 ||30 ||17 ||10 ||4 | ---||38 ||187 ||96 ||2nd of 4 ||Won Semifinals, 4-0 vs Elks Lost Finals, 1-4 vs Northern Hawks (advance to Keystone Cup as LJHL league finalist) |- |2019\u201320 |27 |17 |8 |1 |1 |36 |143 |104 |2nd of 4 |Cancelled due to COVID-19 |} ==Keystone Cup history== Central Canadian Jr. B Championships (Northern Ontario to Saskatchewan) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- style=\"font-weight:bold; background-color:#dddddd;\" | |Year || Round-robin || Record || Standing ||Gold medal game|| Bronze medal game |- | 2018 ||align=left|W, 7\u20132 vs. Peguis Juniors L, 1\u20133 vs. St. Malo Warriors L, 3\u20139 vs. Thunder Bay Northern Hawks || 1\u20132\u20130 || 3rd of 4 ||---||L, 3\u20136 vs Peguis Juniors in semifinal - Bronze medalist |- | 2019 ||align=left|L, 3\u20134 vs. Thunder Bay Northern Hawks W, 6\u20132 vs. Cross Lake Islanders W, 6\u20130 vs. Peguis Juniors|| 2\u20131\u20130 || 2nd of 4 ||L, 2\u20134 vs Thunder Bay Northern Hawks Silver medalist||\u2014 |} ==References== ==External links== *Kam River Pickerel Category:Ice hockey teams in Ontario Category:Sport in Thunder Bay ",
