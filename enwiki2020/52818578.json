The film also stars Anupama Kumar in an important role. The film features music composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja. Chandini plays title role of Ranguski in this film. This film received generally positive reviews. ==Plot== Raja is a police constable who lives with his colleague Baskar. He falls in love with an aspiring writer named Ranguski. He often visits Maria, a senior citizen living in a villa community who has demanded police protection as she is an antique collector and possesses many valuable things. Maria and Ranguski live in the same housing complex. Raja tries to woo Ranguski by making her prank calls in the name of a stranger and forcing her to love him instead. As Ranguski is frustrated by this, she falls in love with Raja. To Raja's surprise, he finds that Ranguski still gets such calls from a stranger. Soon, he too gets such calls, and the caller threatens to kill Ranguski. Raja rushes to Ranguski's home to save her, but he finds out that the killer has killed Maria instead. With circumstances proving that Raja is the killer, he plans with Baskar and Ranguski to find the real killer. They deduce that the killer is part of the villa community too. When Raja goes to meet a photographer who claimed to know who the real killer is, he finds the latter has been murdered. Raja is then arrested by CBCID officer, KK. However, Raja manages to escape custody and reunites with Ranguski and Baskar. He tells them while at Maria\u2019s house on the day of murder, he saw a man with a tattoo on his forearm. They then track down that man, John. John says that he went to Maria\u2019s house looking for the highly valuable Gutenberg Bible but found her already dead. Raja then asks Ranguski to meet KK and hand over a recording of John\u2019s confession to him. They then find John dead. Raja receives a call again which seems to indicate that Ranguski has been kidnapped. Raja and Baskar are then rounded up by the police. However, Raja fights off the police and runs away to find his friend Shiva. Shiva tells him that the last location of Ranguski\u2019s phone was at a church in Cheyur. Raja visits the church and meets Maria\u2019s twin sister Mary, who reveals that Ranguski is the one who committed all the murders and framed Raja. Meanwhile, Ranguski, in possession of the Gutenberg Bible, meets the buyers, the contact she got from John before killing him. While trying to escape with the money, she is shot by the police and dies in Raja\u2019s arms. ==Cast== *Shirish Saravanan as Raja *Chandini Tamilarasan as Ranguski and Regina *Anupama Kumar as Maria and Mary *Kalloori Vinoth as Baskar *Jayakumar Janakiraman as K.K *Sathya as Arokkiyam *Sayee Sekar as John *Madhu Raghuram as Madhu *Vijay Raghavn as Raja Raam *Gopi Gpr as Gopi *Ravichandren as Perumal *DuraiPandi as Kumar ==Production== Dharani Dharan and Shirish, who made his acting debut with Metro (2016), announced that they would make a film together during September 2016.
