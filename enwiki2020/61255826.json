    "text": "Fredrick Edward Arndt Jr. (February 24, 1917 \u2013 October 9, 2002) was an American professional basketball player. He played for the Whiting Ciesar All- Americans in the National Basketball League for two games during the 1937\u201338 season. Sources list Arndt as having attended Purdue University, but he does not appear in any all-time rosters and therefore he likely did not play for the school's basketball team. ==References== Category:1917 births Category:2002 deaths Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Indiana Category:Forwards (basketball) Category:Purdue University alumni Category:People from Starke County, Indiana Category:Sportspeople from Hammond, Indiana Category:Whiting Ciesar All- Americans players ",
