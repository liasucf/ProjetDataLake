The state highway officially terminates on Pioneer Highway just at the entrance to the city. ==History== Children from Longburn School crossing SH56 SH 56 used to connect SH 1 at Himatangi but was rerouted to intersect SH 57 in the mid 1990s. The eastern terminus used to connect to SH 3 at the intersection of Main and Princess Streets but recently the section between there and Maxwells Line has lost its highway status. ==See also== * List of New Zealand state highways ==References== ==External links== *New Zealand Transport Agency 56 Category:Transport in Manawat\u016b-Whanganui ",
