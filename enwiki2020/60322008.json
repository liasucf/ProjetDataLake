He is most-known by his single, titled Gimme the Loot. On November 16, 2018 Big Baby Tape released his first studio album, titled Dragonborn. == Early life == Born on January 5, 2000. Acquaintance of Egor with rap happened at the age of 4, when he first heard 50 Cent songs, which impressed the future musician. A little later, Egor became acquainted with the songs of Gucci Mane, which influenced the current work of Egor. At the age of six, to the question of the aunt: \u201cWhat do you want to be when you grow up?\u201d Egor answered: \u201cRapper!\u201d. At the age of 12, he began to learn how to create music in the Fruity Loops program, which Egor introduced to his sister\u2019s friend. At first, he randomly pressed various buttons, not understanding how to work with it, and soon abandoned it. A year later, Egor returned to work in this program and did not stop creating beats (hip-hop instrumental), taking breaks for no more than one day for several years. The reference points for bitmaking for him at various times were Madlib, DJ Zinc, DJ Rashad, DJ Smokey and DJ Paul. At the age of 15, Egor took the pseudonym DJ Tape and even planned to release an instrumental music album DJ Tape 2000, but the release did not take place, as Egor was unable to bring the project to the planned quality. After that, he decided to rap under the pseudonym Big Baby Tape. ==Musical career== ===2017\u20142018: Hoodrich Tales and Dragonborn=== In May 2017, the first Egor's 4-track mixtape Cookin' Anthem was released. At the end of 2017, the rapper met Feduk, seeing that he was listening to his songs in Stories on Instagram. In an interview for the show \"\u0432\u0414\u0443\u0434\u044c\", Fedor said that Big Baby Tape is in the top 2 of his most beloved rappers, and Big Baby Tape gets its first wide publicity. Subsequently, Egor begins selling instrumental tools to his colleagues. In addition to Feduk, in 2018, Egor caught the attention of such major artists as Kizaru, Boulevard Depo, Face and Pharaoh. March 8, 2018 released a joint with Feduk single \"Hustle Tales\". On June 1, 2018, the debut mini-album Hoodrich Tales was released with guest participation Polyana (MellowBite), Alizade, Boulevard Depo, Feduk and Egor's alter ego Tape LaFlare. The musical release was completely produced by Egor himself. On November 16, 2018, was the release of the debut studio album Dragonborn, released on the label Warner Music Russia. Boulevard Depo, Husky, Jeembo, i61, White Punk and others took part in the recording of the music release. A few days after the release of the album, the track \"Gimme The Loot\" took the first position in the song charts of Apple Music, the iTunes Store, VKontakte, shifting the latest Feduk and Eldzhey albums, and also beat Travis Scott's \"Sicko Mode\" and \"Thank U, Next\" by Ariana Grande on the Genius.https://genius.com/Big-baby-tape-gimme-the-loot-lyrics ===2019: the breakdown of the \"Benzo Gang\"=== On March 8, 2019, on the official YouTube channel of the creative association Benzo Gang, a half-hour video was released, in which Egor told the story of their acquaintance, about working inside the team and about the relationship with each participant. In the course of the monologue, it became known that the low productivity of the participants contributed to the collapse of the team. Initially, at the direction of Yegor, the association was left by Dope V, Cash Choppa and LilJPlug. Particular attention in the video was paid to his relationship with Dimebag Plugg, Andrey's correspondence with fans, who sent Egor in social networks. The reason for their bad relationship was Andrey's problems with the law, drugs, financial situation, hypocrisy, and low activity within the team. And the video ended with the words of Egor: \u201cIn short, Dimebag is the sheer lame and sheer schmuck.
