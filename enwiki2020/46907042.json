    "text": "CSM Suceava, full name Clubul Sportiv Municipal Suceava, was a sports club from Suceava, Romania. It is notable for its football team which played one season in the Divizia A, the highest Romanian league at that time. ==History== CSM Suceava was founded on 19 July 1972, incorporating the sections of football, track and field, rugby and volleyball. During the years, more sections were added and offered to its members, among them archery, baseball, boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling, handball, ice hockey, rowing, speed skating and swimming. The current setup includes archery, boxing, ice hockey, rugby, track and field, volleyball and wrestling. ===Football=== Being one of the founding sections, the football team rose through the ranks of the Romanian league system before eventually gaining promotion to the Divizia A at the end of the 1986\u201387 season. However, competition there proved to be too strong and relegation back to Divizia B was the logical consequence, a league in which the team played for the rest of its existence. Before the 1993\u201394 season, the name was changed to Bucovina Suceava, after the name of the region Bukovina. Bucovina at the end of the 1996\u201397 season, merged with Foresta F\u0103lticeni, creating the most successful team in the history of Suceava County, the new team being called Foresta Suceava, with the home ground in Suceava, on Stadionul Areni. Bucovina became the second team of Foresta F\u0103lticeni, being called Foresta II F\u0103lticeni, playing his matches on Nada Florilor, F\u0103lticeni. ==Chronology of names== In 1957, Flamura Ro\u015fie Burdujeni moved to Suceava, becoming Progresul Suceava. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text- align: left;\" |- !
