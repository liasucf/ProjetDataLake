    "text": "Heinrich Hirschsprung The Hirshsprung Family by P.S. Kr\u00f8yer (1881) Heinrich Hirschsprung by P.S. Kr\u00f8yer (1899) Heinrich Hirschsprung (7 February 1836 \u2013 8 November 1908) was a Danish tobacco manufacturer, arts patron and art collector most known for founding the Hirschsprung Collection in Copenhagen, a museum dedicated to Danish art from the 19th and early 20th century. Heinrich and his brother Bernhard Hirschsprung (1834-1909) took over A.M. Hirschsprung & S\u00f8nner after their father in 1858. ==Family and business life== Heinrich Hirschsprung was born in Copenhagen into a family of German-Jewish descent. His father, Abraham Marcus Hirschsprun (1793-1871), had been born in Friedberg near Frankfurt am Main in 1783 but moved to Denmark where he opened a small tobacco business in Copenhagen's Hotel D'Angleterre in 1826. Two years later, in 1827, he married Petrea Hirschsprung n\u00e9e Hertz (1804\u20131891), and they had six children. Hirschsprung's disease is named after their pediatrician son Harald Hirschsprung (1830\u20131916) who first described it. Heinrich and his brother Bernhard took over their father's shop in 1858 and under their leadership the business, now specializing in cigar making, grew rapidly. In 1866, they bought a piece of unused land at Gammelholm, an area which had been a naval site until 1859. There they built a modern factory for manufacturing cigars. It was designed by young architect Ove Petersen in a Historicist style which ses inspired by Italian Renaissance architecture. Heinrich married Pauline Elisabeth Jacobson (1845 - 1912) on 26 June 1864; she was the daughter of wholesaler Daniel Simon (1791\u20131858) and Friederiche Jacobson n\u00e9e Gerhardt (1811\u20131855). Heinrich and Pauline had five children: Ellen, Ivar, \u00c5ge, Robert, and Oskar. They had their first apartment on H\u00f8jbro Plads in Copenhagen and subsequently a house on Bredgade. They also had country homes in the north of Sj\u00e6lland as well as in Italy. ==Art collection and artist friends== Hirschsprung began his art collection in 1866, with the purchase of a painting by Julius Exner (1825\u20131910). His collection expanded over the years with additional purchases of paintings by contemporary Danish artists. It was a modern collection of examples from the Skagen Painters, the Funen Artists) (Fynboerne) and Symbolists. Hirschsprung was a great supporter, both personal and economic, of P.S. Kr\u00f8yer who met him through Frants Henningsen, (1850\u20131908), a mutual friend at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi). Hirschsprung admired Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s artistic talent and skills, and he purchased the first paintings from him in 1874 \u2014 four watercolors from Hornb\u00e6k. They continued a lifelong friendship. Hirschsprung helped finance Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s travels and foreign residence during the years 1877-1881, giving him the economic support needed to develop his artistic skills. Kr\u00f8yer was a friend of the entire family. He carried on a personal correspondence with Pauline and made a number of family portraits of Heinrich, Pauline and their children. In addition to P.S. Kr\u00f8yer, their homes were gathering places for such other contemporary artists as authors Holger Drachmann (1846\u20131908), Herman Bang (1857\u20131912) and Henrik Pontoppidan (1857\u20131943) and painters Wilhelm Marstrand (1810\u20131873), Frederik Vermehren (1823\u20131910), Otto Bache (1839\u20131927), Kristian Zahrtmann (1843\u20131917), and Frants Henningsen (1850\u20131908). The Hirschsprung Collection (Den Hirschsprungske Samling) was established by Pauline and the museum opened in 1911 with 45 paintings, 13 pastels, 205 drawings, 14 watercolors, 12 busts, 55 sketchbooks as well as P.S. Kr\u00f8yer\u2019s letters and documents. The collection has grown since then, and the museum continues to this day in a beautiful park setting near central Copenhagen, around the corner from the National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst). ==References== ==External links== * Den Hirschsprungske Samling website * The story of P.S.
