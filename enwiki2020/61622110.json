    "text": "In algebraic geometry, a localized Chern class is a variant of a Chern class, that is defined for a chain complex of vector bundles as opposed to a single vector bundle. It was originally introduced in Fulton's intersection theory, as an algebraic counterpart of the similar construction in algebraic topology. The notion is used in particular in the Riemann\u2013Roch-type theorem. S. Bloch later generalized the notion in the context of arithmetic schemes (schemes over a Dedekind domain) for the purpose of giving #Bloch's conductor formula that computes the non-constancy of Euler characteristic of a degenerating family of algebraic varieties (in the mixed characteristic case). == Definitions == Let Y be a pure-dimensional regular scheme of finite type over a field or discrete valuation ring and X a closed subscheme. Let E_{\\bullet} denote a complex of vector bundles on Y :0 = E_{n-1} \\to E_n \\to \\dots \\to E_m \\to E_{m-1} = 0 that is exact on Y - X. The localized Chern class of this complex is a class in the bivariant Chow group of X \\subset Y defined as follows. Let \\xi_i denote the tautological bundle of the Grassmann bundle G_i of rank \\operatorname{rk} E_i subbundles of E_i \\otimes E_{i-1}. Let \\xi = \\prod (-1)^i \\operatorname{pr}_i^*(\\xi_i). Then the i-th localized Chern class c_{i, X}^Y(E_{\\bullet}) is defined by the formula: :c_{i, X}^Y(E_{\\bullet}) \\cap \\alpha = \\eta_*(c_i(\\xi) \\cap \\gamma) where \\eta: G_n \\times_Y \\dots \\times_Y G_m \\to X is the projection and \\gamma is a cycle obtained from \\alpha by the so-called graph construction. == Example: localized Euler class == Let f: X \\to S be as in #Definitions. If S is smooth over a field, then the localized Chern class coincides with the class :(-1)^{\\dim X} \\mathbf{Z}(s_f) where, roughly, s_f is the section determined by the differential of f and (thus) \\mathbf{Z}(s_f) is the class of the singular locus of f. == Bloch's conductor formula == == References == *S.
