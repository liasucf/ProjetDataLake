    "text": "The 1908\u201309 Williams Ephs men's ice hockey season was the 6th season of play for the program. ==Season== After a tremendous season in 1908, Williams attempted to build on that success by scheduling four games against teams from the Intercollegiate Hockey Association. While it was not surprising that the Ephs lost many of those games, failing to win any of their first five games was a bit of a setback. Much of the hand-wringing ended when the team trounced Cornell 8\u20131, beginning a 4-game winning streak to end the season. Williams also played their first games against eventual long-time rival Amherst. ==Roster== ==Standings== ==Schedule and Results== |- !colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season ==References== Category:Williams Ephs men's ice hockey seasons Williams Ephs Williams Ephs Category:1908 in sports in Massachusetts Category:1909 in sports in Massachusetts ",
