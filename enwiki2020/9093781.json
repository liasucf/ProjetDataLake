    "text": "Night of the Pencils () is a 1986 Argentine historical drama film directed by H\u00e9ctor Olivera and written by Olivera and Daniel Kon. It is based on the non- fiction book by Mar\u00eda Seoane and H\u00e9ctor Ruiz N\u00fa\u00f1ez.. It stars Alejo Garc\u00eda Pintos, Vita Escard\u00f3, Leonardo Sbaraglia, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Monje, Pablo Machado, Adriana Salonia and H\u00e9ctor Bidonde. The film, based on the actual events recorded in history as the \"Night of the pencils\" (La noche de los l\u00e1pices), tells the story of seven students who, after protesting for lower bus fares for students in the city of La Plata, were abducted in September 1976, during Argentina's last dictatorship (1976 - 1983), and subsequently disappeared. Only one student survived to tell what happened. ==Plot== During a time of economic and political unrest and State-sponsored terrorism in Argentina in the mid-1970s, the students want reduced bus fares, so they take to the streets and protest in support of the boleto estudiantil: the students' ticket. At first, under Isabel Mart\u00ednez de Per\u00f3n's government they succeed, but their protests draw hostile attention from the ensuing military regime led by Jorge Rafael Videla, which overthrows Per\u00f3n on March 24, 1976. The dictatorship announces that the \"leftist agitators\" will not be tolerated by the new \"government\". The increasingly violent crackdown on student gatherings is demonstrated when the police break up a school dance brandishing guns. On September 16, six students of the city of La Plata are kidnapped in the middle of the night, and the police claims ignorance about their whereabouts. This is the actual event that will later be called \"Night of the Pencils\". Pablo (Alejo Garc\u00eda Pintos), the seventh member of the group, is abducted 5 days later by the police. He learns that his friends have been brutally tortured by governmental authorities and that he will receive the same treatment. The interrogators give him electric shocks while radio music and a pillow mask his cries. Pablo is set free and tells the truth about the group's horrific story. However, his classmates were never found and became part of the thousands of desaparecidos of the dictatorship, who were kidnapped and never seen again. ==Cast== * Alejo Garc\u00eda Pintos as Pablo D\u00edaz * Vita Escard\u00f3 as Claudia Falcone * Leonardo Sbaraglia as Daniel * Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Monje as Panchito * Pablo Machado as Claudio * Adriana Salonia as Mar\u00eda Clara * Tina Serrano as Mrs. Falcone * H\u00e9ctor Bidonde as Mr. Falcone * Alfonso De Grazia as Priest impersonator * Lorenzo Quinteros as Ra\u00fal * Juan Manuel Tenuta as the Rector ==Background== The motion picture was based on the non-fiction book, La noche de los l\u00e1pices, written by Mar\u00eda Seoane and H\u00e9ctor Ruiz N\u00fa\u00f1ez. The book profiles seven high school student activists from La Plata, including lone survivor Pablo D\u00edaz, who gives the authors his testimony.

Thakur was appreciative of the direction of the film and wrote, \"Olivera seems to have kept his integrity mostly intact. He does not shy away from disturbing realities, and he draws a surprisingly complex portrait of the students, their captors, and the students' parents. The film's accomplishment in this regard is considerable and therefore worthy of serious attention...[and] this is especially true of the film's second half.\"Thakur, Manavendra K. The Tech, Volume 109, Number 54, page 9, December 1, 1989. Last accessed: January 15, 2008. Caryn James, film critic for The New York Times, also liked Olivera's work, and wrote, \"Mr. Olivera builds his film on irony and contrast, so the visual beauty of the early scenes - the deep blue night in which cars and lights glisten - calls attention to the ominous unseen political dangers. In daylight, the once- beautiful, now crumbling buildings, including the high school itself, become emblems of a country falling apart, not knowing what to preserve from its past.\"James, Caryn.
