It can be found on Ellis' album Tall Tales, Lost Trails & Heroes.Tracks and Trails - Sounds, tucsoncitizen.com; 21-12-2000 ==Lyrics== :Well, his name was Patrick Murphy, he was Irish through and through, :He came from Mother Ireland, cross the ocean wide and blue. :He was kind of wild and wooly in the crazy things he'd do, :He loved his Irish whiskey and the biplane that he flew. :Out in Bisbee, Arizona, he was sittin' in a bar. :A-spittin 'Irish whiskey to the music of guitars, :A-talkin' 'bout the rebel and the federale war :In the border town of Naco, on the Arizona shore. :Now, as he downs another shooter, Patrick Murphy starts to brag, :\"I salute the rebel spirit ... I salute them scallywags. :I could blow them federales all the way to kingdom come :From the cockpit of me biplane ... with me little homemade bombs.\" :So he found some leather pouches and he fills 'em up just right :He puts 'em in his cockpit and he takes 'em fer a flight :To help them rebel soldiers was an Irishman's delight. :Now there were two towns called Naco on the border down below; :One was in America, the other in Mexico. :Murphy and his whiskey weren't too accurate that day, :He missed the one in Mexico ... and he bombed the U.S.A. :\"He's gonna kill us all!\" said the feds and rebels, too. :\"Someone shoot him down, it's the only thing to do!\" :A federale shot his plane and Murphy's war was through. :Now, history doesn't know where Patrick Murphy is today. :When he finally sobered up, he kinda quickly went away. :Yes, he faded with his biplane to some other place and time :Cuz to bomb ol' Arizona was a heavy duty crime. :So, lads, go tell yer fathers and yer sisters and yer mums :The moral of me story that I've sung ya in me song :That in all the U.S. wars from Valley Forge to old Saddam :'Tis the only time in history the mainland has been bombed. :It was the day we all got bombed down in Naco :I ain't talkin' 'bout tequilla from the bar. :So, if yer down there drinkin' margaritas with yer tacos, Bucko, :Remember Patrick Murphy ... remember Patrick Murphy :Remember Patrick Murphy and his war. ==See also== * Siege of Naco ==References== Category:American folk songs Category:Arizona folklore Category:Escobar Rebellion Category:Year of song missing ",
