Murray. Little is known of her life, but it has been assumed that she is the wife of George James Cookson (1805-1838), a member of the Bengal Artillery, whom she married on 8 June 1832. Her husband died of smallpox on 20 January 1838. ==Artistic work== The work that she is known for is Flowers Drawn and Painted in India, which was published around 1835. Cookson wrote and illustrated the volume, and it is her only known work. The volume contains 31 botanical drawings of indigenous Indian plants. The plates are hand-coloured lithographs. The bound album was presented to the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh Library by Queen Elizabeth II on the opening of the new Herbarium and Library building in 1964. ==References== Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Date of death unknown Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:Irish women artists Category:Irish illustrators Category:Irish women illustrators Category:Botanical illustrators Category:People from County Wicklow Category:19th-century women artists Category:Irish non-fiction writers ",
