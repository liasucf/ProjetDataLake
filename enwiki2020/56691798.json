    "text": "Finger heart A finger heart is a gesture in which a person performs a heart shape using their index finger and thumb. In South Korea, it is a known symbol among K-pop stars and their fans, and is popularly performed using the thumb and index finger. The thumb and index finger gesture has become popular across Asia due to the popularity of K-pop and Korean dramas, and increasingly so in other parts of the world as a factor of the Korean Wave. During the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, The North Face provided gloves with highlighted thumb and index finger sleeves to highlight this symbol. The gesture is very similar to the \"ask for money\" gesture, thus causing misinterpretations. The finger heart has also been misconstrued as a Christian cross. ==See also== *Hand heart == References == Category:Hand gestures ",
