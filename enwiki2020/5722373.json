    "text": "Cochrane Stadium is a 4,000-seat multi-purpose stadium in Jersey City, New Jersey. Opened in 1983, the stadium is located in the Ed \"Faa\" Ford Athletic Complex in the Caven Point area of Jersey City near Liberty State Park and Liberty National Golf Club. In 2008, the stadium's field was re-surfaced with FieldTurf six months after the previous playing surface was found to be contaminated with lead. Cochrane Stadium (often referred to as Caven Point due to the surrounding area) served as the home for the St. Peter's Peacocks football team until the school folded its program in 2007. Six Jersey City high schools (three Catholic, three public) currently share Cochrane Stadium. They are: *St. Anthony High School *St. Peter's Preparatory School *Hudson Catholic High School *James J. Ferris High School *Lincoln High School *Henry Snyder High School ==References== Category:Sports venues completed in 1990 Category:Saint Peter's Peacocks football Category:College football venues Category:Sports venues in New Jersey Category:Multi-purpose stadiums in the United States Category:Sports in Hudson County, New Jersey Category:Buildings and structures in Jersey City, New Jersey Category:Rugby league stadiums in the United States Category:High school football venues in the United States Category:1990 establishments in New Jersey Category:American football venues in New Jersey Category:Defunct college football venues Category:Rugby league in New Jersey ",
