    "text": "Fran\u00e7oise Chab\u00e9 (1976\u20132005) was a French woman who was murdered by strangulation on 26 February 2005 at her home in Humbercourt, in the Somme d\u00e9partement of northern France. Her widower, Ludovic Chab\u00e9, was convicted of her murder in 2013, but was acquitted on appeal in 2015. == Biography == Fran\u00e7oise Chab\u00e9 was born in 1976. She was described as cheerful and optimistic. She was a secretary at an agricultural wholesaler in Beaumetz-l\u00e8s- Loges. She was married to Ludovic Chab\u00e9, a firefighter based at the fire station in Montreuil, in the suburbs of Paris. Ludovic was described by his superiors as being of an exemplary character. At the time of her murder, Fran\u00e7oise was pursuing an extramarital affair with a colleague known only as St\u00e9phane Q. == Murder and investigation == On 2 February 2005, St\u00e9phane Q. had a 17-minute telephone call with Fran\u00e7oise, in which he told her that he was ending their relationship after learning that his wife was pregnant with their second child. In early February 2005, those nearest to Fran\u00e7oise noticed her mood change; she had become anxious and tired. Fran\u00e7oise confided in a colleague: \"Now it will never be like it was before.\" On 26 February 2005, Fran\u00e7oise was strangled with a scarf at her home in Humbercourt. Fran\u00e7oise's husband, Ludovic, discovered her body upon returning home from a 48-hour firefighting shift. He found Fran\u00e7oise lying face down on the living-room floor. Fran\u00e7oise was still wearing her hearing protection device that she used for sleeping. Ludovic turned Fran\u00e7oise onto her back and unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate her. He phoned the fire brigade at 10.04 a.m. and firefighters arrived at the home at 10.15 a.m. Police detectives found a cigarette butt on the floor and threw it in the bin. Semen was found in Fran\u00e7oise's vagina but was not stored correctly and could not be analysed. The forensic pathologist determined Fran\u00e7oise's cause of death to be strangulation. There were no defensive wounds. Fran\u00e7oise's house was not sealed off in the way that crime scenes usually are. On 27 February 2005, the day after the murder, Fran\u00e7oise's family cleaned the house. Investigators quickly abandoned the theory of a prowler, and Ludovic became their prime suspect. A neighbour reported seeing Fran\u00e7oise alive through her window between 9 and 9.30 a.m. on 26 February. The same neighbour stated that she then saw Ludovic arrive at the property at 9.30 a.m. Ludovic had been browsing online dating websites and had had a brief fling with a colleague. Ludovic was quickly arrested. He proclaimed his innocence. The investigators questioned his mother and sister, orchestrating proceedings in such a way that Ludovic could see the interrogation from a neighbouring room. On 3 May 2005, the exhausted Ludovic admitting to killing Fran\u00e7oise by accident during a game. According to his statement, the game was intended to play out as follows: Fran\u00e7oise would be standing up, with Ludovic standing behind her. Ludovic would spread his arms out and clap them shut in front of him. Fran\u00e7oise had to duck before Ludovic's arms came together. However, according to Ludovic, Fran\u00e7oise did not duck quickly enough and his palms slammed against both sides of her head, knocking her unconscious. Ludovic later renounced his confession. He claimed that the examining magistrate sought only to gather evidence favouring the prosecution and ignored exculpatory evidence. According to Ludovic, the police put him under pressure to confess, telling him that if he did not do so, his mother would be charged with the murder. == Trial == On 10 June 2013, Ludovic Chab\u00e9's trial began at the Court of Assizes of the Somme d\u00e9partement in Amiens. His defence barrister was Philippe Valent, while the prosecution barrister was Philippe Bordereau. On 12 June 2013, Chab\u00e9 was found guilty and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. He appealed against the verdict. On 29 May 2015, Chab\u00e9's appeal began at the Court of Assizes of the Oise d\u00e9partement in Beauvais. On 5 June 2015, Chab\u00e9's conviction was quashed and he was formally acquitted of the crime. ==See also== *List of unsolved murders == References == Category:2000s murders in France Category:2005 in France Category:2005 murders in Europe Category:Crime in Hauts-de-France Category:February 2005 crimes Category:February 2005 events in Europe Chabe Chabe Category:Unsolved murders in France Category:Deaths by person in Europe ",
