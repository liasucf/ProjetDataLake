    "text": "The Green Man The Green Man is a disused public house in High Street, Potters Bar, England, and a grade II listed building with Historic England. It was built in the mid 17th century, and subsequently remodelled and extended. Plans to turn the site into a 46-bed care home were repeatedly rejected by the council in 2015 and 2016. In 2019 plans were agreed to convert the building into \"a children\u2019s nursery, or maybe a gym, or maybe a religious centre\" and to build flats on the rear car park site. ==References== ==External links== Category:Pubs in Hertfordshire Category:Grade II listed pubs in England Category:Grade II listed buildings in Hertfordshire Category:Potters Bar ",
