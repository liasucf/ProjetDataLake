    "text": "The Parthian language, also known as Arsacid Pahlavi and Pahlaw\u0101n\u012bg, is a now- extinct ancient Northwestern Iranian language spoken in Parthia, a region situated in present-day northeastern Iran and Turkmenistan. Parthian was the language of state of the Arsacid Parthian Empire (248 BC \u2013 224 AD), as well as of its eponymous branches of the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia, Arsacid dynasty of Iberia, and the Arsacid dynasty of Caucasian Albania. This language had a significant impact on Armenian, a large part of whose vocabulary was formed primarily from borrowings from Parthian. Many ancient Parthian words were preserved, and now can be seen only in Armenian. ==Classification== Parthian was a Western Middle Iranian language. Language contact made it share some features of the Eastern Iranian language group, the influence of which is attested primarily in loanwords. Some traces of Eastern influence survive in Parthian loanwords in Armenian. Parthian loanwords appear in everyday Armenian vocabulary; nouns, adjectives, adverbs, denominative verbs, and administrative and religious lexicons. Taxonomically, Parthian, an Indo-European language, belongs to the Northwestern Iranian language group while Middle Persian belongs to the Southwestern Iranian language group. ==Written Parthian== The Parthian language was rendered using the Pahlavi writing system, which had two essential characteristics: First, its script derived from Aramaic, the script (and language) of the Achaemenid chancellery (i.e. Imperial Aramaic). Second, it had a high incidence of Aramaic words, rendered as ideograms or logograms, that is, they were written Aramaic words but understood as Parthian ones (See Arsacid Pahlavi for details). The Parthian language was the language of the old Satrapy of Parthia and was used in the Arsacids courts. The main sources for Parthian are the few remaining inscriptions from Nisa and Hecatompylos, Manichaean texts, Sasanian multi-lingual inscriptions, and remains of Parthian literature in the succeeding Middle Persian. Among these, the Manichaean texts, composed shortly after the demise of the Parthian power, play an important role for reconstructing the Parthian language. These Manichaean manuscripts contain no ideograms. ==Attestations== Attestations of the Parthian language include: *Some 3,000 ostraca (ca. 100\u201329 BCE) found in Nis\u0101 in southern Turkmenistan. *A first century AD parchment dealing with a land- sale from Awraman in south-west Iran. *The first century BC ostraca from Shahr-e Qumis in Eastern Iran. *The poem Draxt i Asurig *Inscription of on the coins of Arsacid Kings in the first century AD. *The bilingual inscription of Seleucia on the Tigris (150\u2013151 AD). *The inscription of Ardavan V found in Susa (215). *Some third century documents discovered in Dura-Europos, On the Euphrates. *The inscription at Kal-e Jangal, near Birjand in South Khorasan (first half of third century). *The inscriptions of early Sassanian Kings and priests in Parthian including Ka'ba-ye Zartosht near Shiraz and Paikuli in Iraqi Kurdistan. *The vast corpus of Manichaean Parthian which do not contain any ideograms. * In North Pakistan, Indo-Parthian culture in Taxila with Gondophares 20 BC\u201310 BC and Abdagases, Bajaur, Bajaur, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and down in to Sistan, Balochistan. == Samples == This sample of Parthian literature is taken from a Manichaean text fragment: {| class=\"wikitable\" |+A fragment from Mani\u2019s own account of his life !Parthian !English |- |\u0100\u03b3ad h\u0113m Parw\u0101n-\u0160\u0101h, u-m w\u0101xt ku: Dr\u014dd abar t\u014d a\u017e yazd\u0101n. \u0160\u0101h w\u0101xt ku: A\u017e ku ay? \u2013 Man w\u0101xt ku: Bizi\u0161k h\u0113m a\u017e B\u0101bel zam\u012bg.

In the text above, the following forms can be noticed: * \u27e8\u0101\u03b3ad\u27e9, came, instead of Middle Persian \u27e8\u0101yad\u27e9. * \u27e8w\u0101xt\u27e9, said, instead of \u27e8g\u014dft\u27e9. This form for the verb to say can still be found in many contemporary Northwestern Iranian languages, e.g. Mazandarani \u27e8v\u0101t\u03b5n\u27e9 or Zazaki \u27e8vat\u0131\u015f; vaten\u27e9. It is also common in Tati and Talysh, though not in Gilaki, Kurmanji or Sorani. * \u27e8a\u017e\u27e9, from, instead of \u27e8az\u27e9. Observe also in \u27e8kan\u012b\u017eag\u27e9, handmaiden, instead of \u27e8kan\u012bzag\u27e9 and even in \u27e8dru\u0161t\u27e9, healthy, instead of \u27e8drust\u27e9. The rendering of the Persian sound /z/ as /\u0292/, /t\u0283 / or /d\u0292/ is also very common in Northwestern Iranian languages of today. * \u27e8ay\u27e9, you are (Singular), instead of \u27e8h\u0113\u27e9. * \u27e8zam\u012bg\u27e9, land, instead of \u27e8zam\u012bn\u27e9. The form \u27e8zam\u012bg\u27e9 can be found in Balochi. The form \u27e8zamin\u27e9 can be found in Persian. * \u27e8h\u014d\u27e9, that or the, instead of \u27e8(h)\u0101n\u27e9. * The abstractive nominal suffix \u27e8-\u012bft\u27e9 instead of \u27e8-\u012bh\u27e9, as in \u27e8\u0161\u0101d\u012bft\u27e9, joy, Middle Persian \u27e8\u0161\u0101d\u012bh\u27e9. Other prominent differences, not found in the text above, include the personal pronoun \u27e8az\u27e9, I, instead of \u27e8an\u27e9 and the present tense root of the verb \u27e8kardan\u27e9, to do, \u27e8kar-\u27e9 instead of Middle Persian \u27e8kun-\u27e9. Also, the Middle Persian linking particle and relative pronoun \u27e8\u012b(g)\u27e9 was not present in Parthian, but the relative pronoun \u27e8\u010d\u0113\u27e9, what, was used in a similar manner. ==See also== *Avestan language *Old Persian language *Middle Persian *Persian language and history of Persian language *Pahlavi literature ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * * * ==External links== * Some valuable texts in Parthian including Boyce, Mary The Manichaean hymn-cycles in Parthian (London Oriental Series, Vol. 3).
