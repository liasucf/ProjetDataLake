She represented her nation Lithuania in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), and also set her own personal best of 2:31:30 in the women's division at the 2002 Frankfurt Marathon in Frankfurt, Germany. Before turning her sights to marathon in 2002, Juodeskiene ran a national record of 15:28.66 in the women's 5000 metres at the IAAF Permit Meet in Heusden-Zolder, Belgium that guaranteed her a spot on the Lithuanian team for the 2000 Summer Olympics. Juodeskiene made her official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where she competed in the women's 5000 metres. She ran outside her career best of 15:46.37 to obtain a twelfth spot in a field of seventeen athletes during the third heat, but failed to advance further into the final. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Juodeskiene qualified for her second Lithuanian squad in the women's marathon at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, by finishing third and registering an A-standard entry time of 2:31:30 from the Frankfurt Marathon. She finished the race with a sixty-third place time in 3:09:18 over a vast field of 83 marathon runners, trailing further behind gold medalist Mizuki Noguchi of Japan by forty seconds. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Lithuanian female long-distance runners Category:Lithuanian female marathon runners Category:Olympic athletes of Lithuania Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from \u0160iauliai ",
