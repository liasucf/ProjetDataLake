They came very close to winning the first Olympic medal in Israeli history, missing one by 11.30 points. Their second race fell on Yom Kippur, and Israeli officials forbade them from competing that day, so they had missed that race. Had they been able to compete in the second race, they would have certainly medaled. In 1990, Amir and Sela came in 5th in the World Championships. In 1991, they won the Italian Open and came in second in the France Open. == References == Category:Jewish sailors (sport) Category:Olympic sailors of Israel Category:Sailors at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Flying Dutchman Category:Israeli Jews Category:People from Hadera Category:Sailors at the 1992 Summer Olympics \u2013 Flying Dutchman Category:Sailors at the 1984 Summer Olympics \u2013 Flying Dutchman Category:Israeli male sailors (sport) Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Israeli male models ",
