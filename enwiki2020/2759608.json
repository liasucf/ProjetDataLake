Her pilot mistook the St Agnes light for the Wolf Rock and thought they were passing between the Isles of Scilly and the Wolf. Shortly after she struck a rock off Peninnis Head () and the vessel sunk at once with some of the crew being drowned in their berths. Those on deck climbed into the rigging, and as the tide rose the ship was driven closer to land, and some managed to climb onto the shore over the jibboom. The master, pilot and eight crew drowned. ==See also== * SS Minnehaha \u2013 wrecked in the Isles of Scilly on 18 April 1910 * List of shipwrecks of the Isles of Scilly ==References== ==External links== * Diving the South Coast of England (archived) - Cornwall Dive Sites * Photographic archive: \u2018The Gibson archive\u2019 at the Royal Museums Greenwich (RMG) Category:1857 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1874 Category:Shipwrecks of the Isles of Scilly ",
