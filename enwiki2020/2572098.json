The ships were also referred to as County-class cruisers as they carried the names of British counties. ==Design== Left elevation and deck plan as depicted in Jane's Fighting Ships 1914 Aft port casemate guns on , illustrating the unfortunate positioning Expected only to fight light cruisers and armed merchant ships, the class was armed with fourteen 6-inch guns at a time when most British armoured cruisers also carried at least a pair of 9.2-inch guns: Four of the guns were mounted in two twin turrets at a good height, the remaining ten were installed in hull-mounted casemates, five on each side. The lower casemate guns were just a few feet above water, making them impossible to use in heavy seas. Sir John Fisher commented that \"Sir William White designed the County class but forgot the guns.\" On the other hand, they were relatively fast ships for their time. ==Building programme== The following table gives the build details and purchase cost of the members of the Monmouth class. Standard British practice at that time was for these costs to exclude armament and stores. The compilers of The Naval Annual revised costs quoted for British ships between the 1905 and 1906 editions. The reasons for the differences are unclear.The 1906 figure for Monmouth is particularly high. but is as quoted in the original. The 1914 edition also quotes \u00a3979,591 as the cost of Monmouth. {| class=\"wikitable\" |-valign=\"top\" ! width=120 rowspan=2 |Ship ! align = center rowspan=2 | Builder ! align = center rowspan=2 | Engine Maker ! colspan = 3 |Date of ! colspan = 2 |Cost according to |-valign=\"top\" ! align = center width = 74 | Laid Down ! align = center width = 74 | Launch ! align = center width = 74 | Completion ! align = center | (BNA 1905)Brassey's Naval Annual 1905, p234-243 ! align = center | (BNA 1906)Brassey's Naval Annual 1906, p208-215 |-valign=top | |align=center | London and Glasgow Shipping Company |align=center | London & Glasgow Shipping Company |align=right | 29 Aug 1899 |align=right | 13 Nov 1901 |align=right | 2 Dec 1903 |align=right | \u00a3709,085 |align=right | \u00a3979,591 |-valign=top | |align=center | Fairfield, Govan |align=center | Fairfield |align=right | 19 Feb 1900 |align=right | 31 Aug 1901 |align=right | 11 Nov 1903 |align=right | \u00a3734,330 |align=right | \u00a3706,020 |-valign=top | |align=center | Pembroke Dockyard |align=center | J Brown |align=right | 1 Jan 1900 |align=right | 29 Aug 1901 |align=right | 22 Mar 1903 |align=right | \u00a3770,325 |align=right | \u00a3736,557 |-valign=top | |align=center | Portsmouth Dockyard |align=center | Hawthorn |align=right | 12 Feb 1900 |align=right | 6 Mar 1901 |align=right | 1 Oct 1903 |align=right | \u00a3733,940 |align=right | \u00a3700,283 |-valign=top | |align=center | W.

During this time HMS Bedford was wrecked in the East China Sea and scrapped. Following the outbreak of WW1, the ships were primarily tasked with combating German commerce raiders, patrolling in both the North and South Atlantic. HMS Monmouth was assigned to Rear Admiral Sir Christopher Cradock's squadron, and was sunk at the Battle of Coronel. HMS Kent was also assigned to Cradock's squadron, but failed to join in time; she remained at the Falklands and joined Admiral Sturdee's squadron, which also included HMS Cornwall. In the ensuing Battle of the Falklands, HMS Kent pursued and sank , while HMS Cornwall pursued and sank . HMS Kent continued the pursuit of , eventually locating her and forcing her to be scuttled at the Battle of M\u00e1s a Tierra. Later HMS Cornwall participated in the blockade of in the Rufiji river. After the war, several of the ships served briefly as training ships. All were withdrawn from service and scrapped in 1920\u201321. ==Notes== ==Footnotes== == Bibliography == * Brassey, T.A.
