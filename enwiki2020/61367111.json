In 2017, they released the single \"Coming Up\", the song did not enter the Swedish Singles Chart, but peaked at number two on the Sweden Heatseeker Songs. In an interview with Wiwibloggs, Victor said, \"Marcus Svedin and I wrote this song when I was back in Sweden shortly after winning Eesti Laul. We wrote it with an acoustic guitar and wanted to create a positive vibe. We felt that Tungevaag & Raaban should produce it. \"Take Me Away\" is about getting away to the sea, to the mountains or to nature. In a nutshell, it is about living life to the fullest. We believe that it is a song that works both acoustically and for clubbing. I hope you enjoy it.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! Chart (2019) !
