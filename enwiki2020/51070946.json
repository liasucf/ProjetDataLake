    "text": "The 2020 United States Senate election in Montana will be held on November 3, 2020, to elect a member of the United States Senate to represent the State of Montana, concurrently with the 2020 U.S. presidential election, as well as other elections to the United States Senate in other states, elections to the United States House of Representatives, and various state and local elections. Originally this seat was projected to be a likely Republican hold. However, Steve Bullock, Montana's popular Democratic governor, entered the race on the last day to file, which has shifted the dynamics of the contest dramatically, and many political pundits now consider it a competitive race and potential pickup for Democrats. As the Green Party was removed from the ballot and both Libertarian nominees withdrew, this will be the first time since 1988 that there will be no non-Republican or Democratic candidates running for either United States House of Representatives or United States Senate in Montana. ==Republican primary== ===Candidates=== ====Nominee==== *Steve Daines, incumbent U.S. Senator ====Eliminated in primary==== *John Driscoll, former Democratic Speaker of the Montana House of Representatives (1977\u20131979) *Daniel Larson, hardware store manager ===Endorsements=== ===Results=== thumb|Results by county ==Democratic primary== ===Candidates=== ====Nominee==== * Steve Bullock, incumbent Governor of Montana and former candidate for President of the United States in 2020 ====Eliminated in primary==== *John Mues, nuclear engineer and U.S. Navy veteran ====Withdrawn==== *Jack Ballard, former professor at Montana State University Billings (endorsed Bullock) *Wilmot Collins, mayor of Helena (endorsed Bullock) * Mike Knoles, mathematician, physicist, and data analyst (endorsed Bullock) https://mobile.twitter.com/KnolesMichael/status/1236997949730611207 (remained on ballot) *Cora Neumann, public health expert and founder of the Global First Ladies Alliance (endorsed Bullock) *Josh Seckinger, fishing guide (endorsed Bullock) ====Declined==== *Michael Punke, writer and former U.S. ambassador to the World Trade Organization *Brian Schweitzer, former Governor of Montana *Kathleen Williams, former state representative and nominee for Montana's at- large congressional district in 2018 (running for Montana's at-large congressional district) ===Endorsements=== ===Results=== thumb|Results by county ==Other candidates== ===Libertarian Party=== After Susan Geise officially withdrew, the Montana Libertarian Party could name a replacement candidate for the general election. However, during a meeting to select a replacement candidate, a majority of party officials selected not to have a replacement candidate, with \"none of the above\" winning the most votes. ====Withdrawn==== *Eric Fulton, Republican candidate for District 65 of the Montana House of Representatives in 2014 *Susan Geise, Lewis and Clark County commissioner and former chair of the Montana Republican Party ===Green Party === ====Disqualified==== *Wendie Fredrickson, former audit reviewer for Montana State Department of Public Health and Human Services ====Eliminated in primary==== *Dennis Daneke, retired college professor ====Results==== thumb|Results by county ==General election== === Debate === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Host ! rowspan=\"2\" |Date & Time ! rowspan=\"2\" |Link(s) ! colspan=\"2\" |Participants |- !Steve Daines (R) !Steve Bullock (D) |- | align=\"center\" |Montana Broadcasters Association | align=\"center\" |August 8, 2020 9:30pm MDT | align=\"center\" | | | |- | align=\"center\" |Montana Television Network | align=\"center\" |October 10, 2020 5:47pm MDT | align=\"center\" | | | |} ===Predictions=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Source !Ranking !As of |- | align=left | The Cook Political Report | |October 7, 2020 |- | align=left | Inside Elections | |October 1, 2020 |- | align=left | Sabato's Crystal Ball | | October 8, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Daily Kos | | October 6, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Politico | |September 9, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |RCP | |October 7, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Niskanen | |September 15, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |DDHQ | |October 9, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |538 | |October 10, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Economist | |October 6, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |CNN | |October 2, 2020 |} ===Endorsements=== ===Polling=== ;Graphical summary Aggregate Polls {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ !colspan=\"7\"|Steve Bullock vs. Steve Daines |- !Source of poll aggregation !Dates administered !Dates updated !Steve Bullock !Steve Daines !Other/Undecided !Margin |- |Real Clear Politics | September 14 - October 10, 2020 |October 12, 2020 |45.0% ||48.3% |6.7% ||Daines + 3.3 |- |270 to Win |September 20 - October 12, 2020 |October 12, 2020 |45.0% ||48.3% |6.7% ||Daines + 3.3 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;text- align:center;\" |- valign=bottom !
