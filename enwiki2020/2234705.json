    "text": "The Northern Velebit National Park () is a national park in Croatia that covers 109 km2 of the northern section of the Velebit mountains, the largest mountain range in Croatia. Because of the abundant variety of this part of the Velebit range, the area was upgraded from a nature reserve in 1999, and opened as a national park in September the same year. The whole of the Velebit range is a \"nature park\", a lesser conservation category. Another national park on Velebit is the Paklenica on its southern side. ==The park== The park reserve is protected and visitors are restricted to designated trails. Inside the reserve is the Visibaba (Galanthus) botanical reserve, with an abundance of the endemic Croatian subspecies of Sibiraea altaiensis, and the Zavi\u017ean\u2013Balinovac\u2013Velika kosa botanical reserve, famous for its outstanding collection of mountain flora species. Inside the reserve is the well-known Velebit Botany Garden, founded by pharmacology professor and botanist Fran Ku\u0161an in 1967. The Park is criss-crossed with mountaineering trails. The best- known is Premu\u017ei\u0107's Trail, named after its constructor, the forester Ante Premu\u017ei\u0107 who built it in late 1933. The path runs through the most beautiful and most interesting parts of the park. From the numerous peaks in the surroundings there are magnificent views of the Adriatic Sea and its islands (Pag, Rab, Goli Otok, Prvi\u0107 and Krk) as well as of the continental side. Park map Adding to the Park's cultural value are the numerous ruins of so-called \"summer lodges\". These remain from when Velebit was populated by shepherds and cattle farmers. On its coastal slopes are many ruined houses, lodges and stone walls, all the remaining evidence of a lost local population. The Zavi\u017ean (1676 m) peak is within the park, the highest meteorological station in Croatia. ==Special reservations== The special reservations in the park are two locales called Hajdu\u010dki kukovi and Ro\u017eanski kukovi. Their names come from a folk name given to large stone masses which rise up over the surroundings of the Velebit mountains. They are in the center of the park, but are not a regular part of it, access to them is restricted to scientific researchers and educational visitors. ===Hajdu\u010dki kukovi=== Hajdu\u010dki kukovi is one of the Kukovi group of peaks in the northern part of the Velebit. Together with Ro\u017eanski kukovi it forms an area of around 22 km2 declared as a nature reserve in 1969. It is separated from Ro\u017eanski kukovi by the Skrbina Draga and Veliki Lubenovac field. The kukovi group has around 40 summits exceeding 1600 m. The area around Hajdu\u010dki kukovi has a complex underground drainage system. The terrain is much wilder than around Ro\u017eanski kukovi, and there are parts where even today no human foot has ever trod.Radovan Radovinovi\u0107, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pg. 143, Naklada Naprijed - Zagreb (1999), Lukina jama, the deepest mountain cave in Croatia and one of the deepest in southeast Europe, with a depth of 1392 m, was discovered in 1992 by a local caving enthusiast named Ozren Luki\u0107. Luki\u0107 joined a mountain division during the war (1991\u201395) as a volunteer and was killed by a sniper in 1992.Rudolf Abraham, Walking in Croatia, pg. 130, Cicerone Press (2004), Lukina jama was named after him. ===Ro\u017eanski kukovi=== Rossi's Cabin The first \"kuk\", Gromova\u010da (1675 m), is a two-and-a-half-hour walk from the hostel in Zavi\u017ean. The centre of the rocks begin immediately behind Rossijeva koliba (a mountain hut), also 2.5 hours' walk from the hostel. The most interesting part of this rocky region is on the path from Rossilijeva koliba to Crikvena (1641 m), half an hour's walk from the hut. In an area of about 18 km2 there are more than fifty stony peaks, all over 1600 m, some with bizarre shapes of towers, spires or obelisks. Here all the phenomena of karst rock meet \u2013 chasms, dizzying heights, crevices, caves, natural gateways and passes. The best-known and most popular sights are Novotnijev kuk, Rossilijev kuk and Premu\u017ei\u0107ev kuk. ==Climate== ==See also== * Geography of Croatia * Rewilding Europe * Zavratnica ==References== ==External links== * * Awarded \"EDEN - European Destinations of Excellence\" non traditional tourist destination 2009 Northern Velebit Category:Biosphere reserves of Croatia Category:Dinaric Alps Category:1999 establishments in Croatia Category:Protected areas established in 1999 Category:Protected areas of Lika-Senj County Category:Primeval Beech Forests in Europe ",
