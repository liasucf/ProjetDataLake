    "text": "The Argentine presidential election of 1886 was held on 11 April to choose the president of Argentina. Miguel Ju\u00e1rez Celman was elected president. ==Background== Confident of his authority following six years of peace and prosperity, President Roca was by then known for his shrewdness as \"the fox.\" Enjoying the support of the agricultural elites - as well as of the London financial powerhouse, Barings Bank - Roca daringly fielded his son-in-law, C\u00f3rdoba Province Governor Miguel Ju\u00e1rez Celman, as the PAN candidate for president. A number of distinguished candidates appeared, including Buenos Aires Governor Dardo Rocha and Foreign Minister Bernardo de Irigoyen. Roca tolerated no opposition against his dauphin, however, who was selected nearly unanimously on 11 April 1886.Todo Argentina: 1886 ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=19% ! colspan=2| Argentine Republic |- | Population | align=right| 3,094,000 |- | Voters | align=right| 61,900 |- | Turnout | align=right| 2% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\" |- !width=\"50%\"| Presidential Candidates !width=\"35%\"| Party !width=\"15%\"| Electoral Votes |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | Miguel Ju\u00e1rez Celman | National Autonomist Party | 168 |- | Manuel Anselmo Ocampo | Partidos Unidos | 32 |- | Bernardo de Irigoyen | Partidos Unidos | 13 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total voters | 213 |- | colspan=2| Did not vote | 19 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total | 232 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\" |- !width=\"50%\"| Vice Presidential Candidates !width=\"35%\"| Party !width=\"15%\"| Electoral Votes |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | Carlos Pellegrini | National Autonomist Party | 179 |- | Rafael Garc\u00eda | Partidos Unidos | 28 |- | Luis S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a | Partidos Unidos | 3 |- | Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre | Partidos Unidos | 3 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total voters | 213 |- | colspan=2| Did not vote | 19 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total | 232 |} === Results by Province === {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=2| Province ! colspan=3| President ! rowspan=2 width=\"1%\"| ! colspan=4| Vice President |- !
