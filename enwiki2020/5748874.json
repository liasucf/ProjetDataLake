Of the two northern Norwegian teams that participated this year, Bod\u00f8/Glimt made it all the way to the fourth round. The surprise team of the cup this year was Sagene, a team that made it to the quarter final, despite playing in the third division (tier three). Skeid won the cup, beating Fredrikstad 2-1 in the final. ==Final three rounds== ==See also== *1963 Norwegian First Division ==References== *http://www.rsssf.no/1963/Cup.html Category:Norwegian Football Cup seasons Norway Football Cup ",
