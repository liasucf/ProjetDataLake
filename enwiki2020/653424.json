    "text": "The Ripon Society is an American centrist Republican public policy organization based in Washington, D.C. It produces The Ripon Forum, the U.S.'s longest running Republican thought and opinion journal, as well as The Ripon Advance, a daily news publication. Founded in 1962 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Society's name comes from the 1854 birthplace of the Republican Party\u2014Ripon, Wisconsin. Its main goals are to promote the following American ideas and principles: national security, low taxes, and a federal government that is smaller, smarter and more accountable to the people. The Ripon Society's objectives are focused on an understanding within the Republican Party of public policies, ideas and actions that: # Strengthen the American family. # Promote and achieve an innovative and effective educational system. # Improve and protect health, and safety and the natural environment. # Advance participation in and development of a sound, growing economy. # Ensure a strong, effective national defense. # Encourage reasoned, effective government at local, state and federal levels that nurtures participation in our political system. The Ripon Society was the first major Republican organization to support passage of the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s. In 1967, it advanced the concept of the \"Negative Income Tax\" as a means of ameliorating poverty in the U.S. with the simple expedient of the government's providing cash payments to families in need. The society's paper stated the program would help families rise up the income ladder, moving them from payment recipients to working taxpayers. In the early 1970s, it called for the normalization of relations with China, and the abolition of the military draft. ==History== {| class=\"infobox bordered\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:21em;\" ! style=\"font-size:120%; text-align:center; padding:15px 0;\" | The Ripon Forum |- | Two U.S. presidents and Republican presidential nominees have written guest articles in The Ripon Forum: 175px President Richard M.

He had studied in England on a Fulbright scholarship. While in England, he met members of a group called the Bow Group. The Bow Group founders had been \"dissatisfied with the Conservative Party's image as 'the Stupid Party'.\" The Bow Group impressed Frankel, particularly regarding the level of detail that its members applied to study public policy problems and the proactive way its members became experts on policy topics.Geoffrey Kabaservice, Rule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party, From Eisenhower to the Tea Party. Oxford University Press. January 4, 2012. Retrieved June 7, 2013 via Google Books At the same time John S. Saloma III was a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Like Frankel, Saloma had studied in England on a Fulbright scholarship. Both Frankel and Saloma became editors at Advance magazine. In December 1962, Frankel and Saloma \"circulated a confidential 'Proposal for an American Bow Group'\". Saloma and Frankel held a meeting on December 12, 1962, in Cambridge, Massachusetts at Harvard College. The meeting would become the first meeting of the group that eventually became known as the Ripon Society. The name is a reference to Ripon, Wisconsin, the informal birthplace of the Republican Party. (The town's claim was disputed by Jackson, Michigan, where the first official meeting of the Party was held; but a Republican organization was unlikely to name itself \"The Jackson Society\"). The society's meetings took place monthly at locations around Harvard. Some sixty individuals attended at least one Ripon meeting during its first year, and about half became active members. Most were graduate or professionals students and young professors from Harvard, M.I.T., and the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts. Although conservatives liked to pretend that progressive, East Coast Republicans were all top-hatted aristocrats, the members of the Ripon Society were mainly middle-class, and a preponderance of them were from the Midwest. One of the main goals of the Ripon Society is to promote ideas and principles that have contributed to the GOP's past success. These ideas include keeping the nation secure, keeping taxes low and having a federal government that is not just smaller, but smarter and more accountable to the people. ====A Call to History==== On November 22, 1963, a group of Ripon Society members were having lunch in a dining hall at Harvard University. During lunch, they were planning a trip to campaign for Nelson Rockefeller for president, who was at that time the Republican governor of New York. Near the end of their lunch meeting, the members got word that President John F. Kennedy had been shot. Political historian and author Geoffrey Kabaservice writes, \"Although they (the Ripon Society members) were Republicans, JFK had been their political inspiration. When the news confirmed that Kennedy had been killed, they were caught between grief for their fallen hero and fear of Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded to the presidency\". Over the weeks following Kennedy's death, the Ripon members wrote a manifesto, \"A Call to Excellence in Leadership: An Open Letter to the New Generation of Republicans.\" Newspapers around the U.S. published highlights of the manifesto. The New York Herald Tribune published it in full. The media attention given to the \"Call to Excellence\" thrust Ripon onto the national stage. The Washington Star was one newspaper that editorially hailed the Society as \"a new voice in the land ... a voice that ought to be heeded.\" Another voice was President (and Republican) Dwight Eisenhower, who wrote \"my delight that an obviously intelligent group of people has taken the trouble to voice its consensus on this important subject, and also to express my basic agreement in the mainstream of its thinking.\"\"Dwight D. Eisenhower to Walter N. Thayer\". Ripon Society Papers 3:177. January 23, 1964. ====The Ripon Papers==== The Ripon Society wrote its first public statement in the weeks that followed Kennedy's assassination and published the statement on January 6, 1964:\"The History of the Ripon Society\", Ripon Society website, Accessed 06 June 2013 > While we yet sorrow, so must we seize this moment before our thoughts slip > away to be lost in the noise of 'life as usual.'

Saloma III, serving from 1963 until 1967.Lindsey Gruson, \"John S. Saloma, 48; Specialist in Politics Started Ripon Group\", The New York Times, 8 July 1983, Retrieved 06 June 2013 In 1962, Saloma founded the American Bow Group, a society of university intellectuals. In 1963, the American Bow Group became the Ripon Society. Saloma attended MIT and the London School of Economics. He received his doctorate from Harvard University with his dissertation \"British Conservatism and the Welfare State\". In his career, Saloma's work focused mainly on the American political party system. Participating in a project studying the U.S. Congress sponsored by the American Political Science Association and the Carnegie Foundation, he published Congress and the New Politics in 1969 which dealt with the workloads in the offices of members of Congress. This led to an interest in the congressional budget process and the possibilities of computer use in the daily job of a representative. He died on July 6, 1983 in San Francisco, California.

The society published an essay on its ideas for ending the draft. Ideas included increasing military salaries, paying volunteers higher salaries than draftees, and getting rid of \"irrelevant induction standards to increase the flow of volunteers.\" |- | 1967 | Negative income tax | center | In 1967, Ripon proposed a new tax overhaul plan. Certain families would not pay taxes; instead, the government would send payments to the families. To qualify, families had to have low incomes. At the time, the proposed income cutoff was $6,000 (equivalent to $42,000 in 2014 dollars). Ripon released a report detailing the proposal. In the report, the society said, \"The negative income tax encourages families to move up the income scale until they can begin to pay positive income taxes.\" |- | 1970 | Changes to GOP's \"Southern Strategy\" | center | During President Nixon's first term, the Ripon Society publicly asked Nixon to change the Republican Party's political tactics by getting rid of what was known as the \"southern strategy.\" The Society arrived at this position because George Wallace had won the vote in Alabama, and the Society believed that Wallace's victory \"killed it [the southern strategy] as a national tactic\", the Kentucky New Era wrote in 1970. |- | 1970 | Senatorial rating system | center | In 1970, the Society created its first system to rate Members of Congress' voting records. The system rated the votes of U.S. Senators on key issues. The Society said that the goal of the rating system was to help people distinguish between liberal and conservative politicians. In that first year of rating, two senators received a near-perfect rating record: Senator Charles A. Goodell (R-NY) and Senator John Sherman Cooper (R-KY). The rating system was based on 29 specific roll call votes in the U.S. Senate. |- | 1971 | Interior Secretary Hickel \"Man of the Year\" | center | In November 1970, President Nixon fired his Secretary of the Interior, Walter J. Hickel. In April 1971, the Ripon Society gave Hickel the Ripon Society Man of the Year award. The Society made its decision by looking at the results of a poll it had taken of the readers of its magazine, The Ripon Forum. |- | 1972 | George Romney, Republican of the Year | center | In 1972, the Ripon Society awarded George Romney the Ripon Society \"Republican of the Year\" award. George Romney is Mitt Romney's father. At that time, George Romney served in as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.The Society used a number of criteria when selecting Romney. For example, the Society supported Romney's work in the areas of \"new housing, metropolitan planning, and federal revenue sharing with state and local governments,\" according to the Rome News-Tribune. |- | 1976 | President Ford's reelection | center | In 1976, the Society publicly denounced the idea of President Gerald Ford picking John Connally as Ford's running mate in the 1976 presidential election. \"[He] might as well just nominate Rose Mary Woods.\" |- | 1981 | Nuclear sanctions | center | In 1981, the Ripon Society voiced public support for sanctions on nuclear- exporting countries. The society asked President Reagan to sanction any nation that sold weapons-grade nuclear materials or facilities. |- | 1984 | Republican party direction | center | In 1984, Congressman Jim Leach, who served as head of the Ripon Society at the time, held a press conference on Capitol Hill. At the press conference, Leach said that the Republican Party had been the first party to endorse the Equal Rights Amendment; that the party was founded on the \"Lincolnian notion that rights, to be valid, must be color- blind\"; and that the party had historically been supportive of the separation of church and state. As the Milwaukee Journal characterized it, \"Leach ... had some rough words for the GOP.\" |- | 1985 | George H. W. Bush, Republican of the Year | center | In July 1985, the society awarded its Republican of the Year award to then-Vice President George H.W. Bush. |- | 1995 | Welfare reform | President Bill Clinton signs the \"Welfare to Work\" reform legislation. | In 1995, the Society advocated for changes to the welfare reform bill. The Society called its idea \"Work, Not Wait Incentive.\" The plan would have allowed welfare recipients to keep more of the money they earned from work before losing some of their welfare benefits. Several Members of Congress who served on Ripon's Advisory Board advocated for the \"Work, Not Wait Incentive\". Those members included Representatives Bill Clinger, Amo Houghton, Nancy Johnson, Susan Molinari, Tillie Fowler, Connie Morella, and Senators John Chafee, Nancy Kassebaum and Arlen Specter. In 2010, the Richard Nixon Foundation published a post on its website that said that \"many of the ideas involved in welfare reform came out of the work of economist Milton Friedman, as well as discussions within the Ripon Society and groups affiliated with it, especially Yale Law School's Trumbull Society.\" |- | 2006\u20132014 | Immigration reform | An original \"green card\" issued by the U.S. government in 1946 The patch of a United States Border Patrol (USBP) uniform, worn on the right sleeve President George W. Bush addressed the nation on immigration reform on May 15, 2006. | In 2006, Tamar Jacoby (a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute) wrote an editorial in the Ripon Society's magazine, The Ripon Forum, about the immigration issue. Jacoby argued that the American public wanted Congress and the President to finally solve the problem of illegal immigration and end it. Jacoby saw three options. First, the \"tough\" option, would increase border enforcement. Jacoby argued that this option would not work because tough-talking rhetoric and increases in border patrol budgets had not changed the number of illegal immigrants coming into the United States per year. The second option was to do nothing. (Jacoby argued against this option, too). The third option was to reform the systems related to immigration and naturalization, which President George W. Bush had pushed for. The immigration issue was large enough to come into play as a major topic at a Ripon Society event in Dublin, Ireland in 2013. The Franklin Center for Global Policy Exchange and Ripon hosted a policy conference in September 2013. Irish politicians and business people, plus 11 Members of Congress, participated. The panel discussed a problem known as \"brain drain\" that was affecting both Ireland and the United States: high-skilled workers were moving to other countries. Panel members pushed for the inclusion of a solution to this problem in any immigration reform package passed by Congress. The Ripon Society throughout 2014 hosted a series of public forums about the issue of immigration reform. Former Republican presidential nominee John McCain headlined a forum in April. McCain encouraged Congress to pass an immigration reform bill; he said that doing so would improve the economy, make the country safer and make the Republican Party perform stronger with Hispanic voters. \"I've been to Iraq and Afghanistan many times, and I can assure you that we have the technology to secure our border,\" McCain said. McCain warned the audience that the Republican Party will not be able to win another presidential race unless the party supported immigration reform. In March, the president of the Pew Research Center, Michael Dimock, warned the Republican Party during an address to the Ripon Society to stop advocating small government conservative policies (\"Try to take as much of the anti-government rhetoric out,\" he told the room). Dimock explained the demographic shift that would displace non-white people as the majority of the American population. In August, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy along with two California House members, Congressman Jeff Denham and Congressman David Valadao, spoke at a Ripon forum. The three emphasized border security as an important issue within immigration reform. |} ==Ripon Society and Federal Election Commission== In 2004, the Ripon Society requested a legal advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Ripon wanted to pay for a TV campaign commercial in favor of the re-election of Congresswoman Sue Kelly (R-NY). Ripon's argument in favor of being allowed to run the commercial was that the commercial would promote homeland security policies that the Ripon Society, and Congresswoman Kelly, supported. The requested advisory opinion amounted to a request for an interpretation of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 as it applied to the specific details of the proposed campaign advertisement. The FEC responded by saying that the law prohibited Ripon from paying for the ad if it was televised within Congresswoman Kelly's congressional district. However, the FEC said that Ripon could pay for the ad if it were televised outside of her district and only if the Ripon Society did not coordinate with Republican Party officials. In FEC Advisory Opinion 2004-33, the FEC said the Ripon Society could not legally pay for a political TV commercial for a congressional candidate if it was aired in the candidate's district immediately before an election (30 days before a primary election or 60 days before a general election). At that time (2004), the law prohibited corporate funds from paying for \"electioneering communication\", an umbrella term that includes campaign TV commercials. ==Republican of the Year Award== In addition to George H.W. Bush, other Republican of the Year recipients have included former Senator Bob Dole and former Senator Howard H. Baker, Jr.Marjorie Hunter and Warren Weaver, \"Briefing; Republican of the Year\", The New York Times, 30 July 1985, Retrieved 06 June 2013 ==Programs== ===Lecture series=== The Ripon Society hosts a series of lectures known as their \"Policy & Politics Dialogue Series\", which in 2011 has consisted of over 40 idea-based forums. Speakers have included: Speaker of the House John Boehner, Representatives Kevin Brady and Greg Walden, Senators Rob Portman and John McCain, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. At a Ripon event in January 2013, shortly after President Obama's second inaugural address, Boehner told the audience that President Obama was trying to \"annihilate the Republican Party.\" ===Breakfast series=== The Ripon Society hosts breakfast forums that feature members of Congress. For example, the breakfast forums have hosted the Republican Women's Policy Committee,\"After recent GOP losses among women, Ripon Society hosts breakfast meeting on what can be done to reverse that trend\" (Press release).

Card. ==Bipartisan action== This section summarizes some of the bipartisan legislation and actions led by Members of Congress who sit on Ripon's congressional advisory board. ===Superbugs, nightmare bacteria and the FDA=== Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), a member of the Ripon congressional advisory board, along with Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) introduced a bill in January 2015 known as the PATH Act. The bill would change the drug approval process for antibiotic drugs that fight \"combat resistant bacteria\". These types of bacteria, also known as \"superbugs\", don't respond to antibiotic medication. The Centers for Disease Control says that 23,000 people in the U.S. die each year from these types of bacteria. ==Congressional Advisory Board== {| class=\"wikitable hlist\" style=\"width:100%\" !
