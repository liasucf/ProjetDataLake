The website was subsequently sold and now publishes anti- American attacks,https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1301210359492161539?s=20https://twitter.com/iraniandotcom/status/1240757793763688448?s=20 Palestinian rights advocacy,https://twitter.com/larudee/status/1295735902166061057?s=20 and anti regime change advocacy.https://twitter.com/JZarif/status/1299348104496455686?s=20 When Javid started the website in 1995, he called it The Iranian (after The New Yorker). The site has been under severe criticism generated revenues through donations from the US military and causing its audience to question its ownership and purpose, Google AdSense, advertisers and sponsors like World Singles Networks. On April 24, 2012, Javid announced to his sponsors at PBS that he was pursuing a new venture, and that he had sold his remaining shares to his partner, entrepreneur Sa\u00efd Amin. Said Amin is connected to the board of the controversial National Iranian American Council, alongside Amb. Thomas Pickering, who was the special assistant to Henry Kissinger. Although the site claims to be \"by the Iranian diaspora and for the Iranian diaspora\", many in the community have vocalized the concern that their identities are being hijacked and exploited for purposes of disinformation dissemination under the many USAGM enabled programs attacking Iranians in racist and discriminatory fashion with war lies today. ==See also== * Media of Iran * List of Persian- language magazines ==References== ==External links== * Category:American news websites Category:English-language websites Category:Ethnic mass media in the United States Category:Iranian-American culture in California Category:Internet properties established in 1995 Category:News aggregators ",
