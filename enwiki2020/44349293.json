His father was a seaman. He was the eldest of four children. At the age of 10, he entered the military school of Miliana, and then entered the Cadet School (Ecole des cadets) of Kol\u00e9a. He pursued his studies at Aix-en-Provence at its military school and passed there his Baccalaureate. Then he succeeded at the entrance examination of Saint-Cyr. But with the independence of Algeria, he decided to return home once and for all on January 26, 1963. In 1963, he succeeded at the entrance examination of the ENITA (Algerian National engineer and technician military school). In 1974, he earned his degree of electromechanical engineer.

But in reality he was attracted by journalism. His first articles were published on Alger R\u00e9publicain. Satisfied by this first experience, he decided, in May 1964, to leave his job in the Ministry of Energy and devote himself to writing and working as a full- time journalist. Following the advice of Henri Alleg who was the director of the newspaper, he participated in the satirical column of \u201cL\u2019Ogre\u201d which will become later \u201cEl Ghoul\u201d. At the same time, he started his own column named \u201cMesmar Djeha\u201d. He stayed at Alger R\u00e9publicain until June19th 1965, date of the putsch of Houari Boum\u00e9di\u00e8ne who prohibited the newspaper. In October 1965, he will be recruited by the l\u2019EGA (Sonelgaz). Since 1989, he rejoined \u201cAlger R\u00e9publicain\u201d and wrote on a regular basis El Ghoul column. He also participated in the satirical newspaper \u201cEl Manchar\u201d. But in 1991, and accompanied by a group of journalists, he left Alger R\u00e9publicain to create the daily newspaper \u201cLe Matin\u201d. ==Death== He received repeatedly death threats. On March 8, 1994, he escaped a terrorist attack not far from his home. But on December 3, 1994, he was for second time the target of terrorists and was hit by two bullets. He died the next day at Ain Naadja hospital at Algiers. ==References== Category:Algerian journalists Category:Murdered journalists Category:1940 births Category:1994 deaths Category:20th-century journalists ",
