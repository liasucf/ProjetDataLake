Her origins are said to derive from N\u00fc Wa, the legendary creater and mother goddess. ==Legends== According to legend, she is often equated with N\u00fc Wa, as she has long been worshipped on the same mountain, but actually, Lishan Laomu has her own number of stories. Her disciples and apprentices are legendary female heroes, such as Zhong Wuyan, Fan Lihua, Bai Suzhen, Zhu Yingtai, Mu Guiying, Liu Jinding, these women are heroine era. During the Tang Dynasty, Taoist Li Quan (618-907) a commoner fond of the way of the immortals, who often travelled to spiritual places in the mountains, met with Lishan Laomu at the foot of Lishan Mountain, and Laomu taught him Huangdi Yinfujing (The Yellow Emperor's Scripture on \"Unconscious Unification\"). The Song dynasty leishu encyclopedia Taiping Yulan quotes a Han dynasty source, the San Qinji (\u4e09\u79e6\u8a18), and provides a legend about the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, encountering the goddess at Mount Li. At the time of the First Emperor, there was a crossway of eighty li to Mount Li. People walked over the bridge, carts drove under the bridge. The pillars of metal and stone can still be seen. In the west, there are hot springs, and it is said that Qin Shi Huang played a divine woman there. As he was ill-mannered, the goddess spat at him, and an ulcer grew on that place. Struck by terror the First Emperor apologized, and the divine woman made a hot spring appear, which cured his illness. Because of that, later generations use to bath there. In the Shiji and Hanshu are some statements about the old mother of Mt. Lishan. She was seen as a heavenly daughter or as a woman married to a western barbarian, chieftain named Xuxuan (\u80e5\u8f69). Through this marriage it was able for the rulers of the Shang (17th-11th cent. BC) or Zhou (11th. cent.-221 BC) dynasties (the time is given with that period) to control the peoples in the west. Lishan Laomu Temple in Taiwan Laomu's main temple is called \"Lishan Laomu Palace\" in Xi'an of Shaanxi Province is the most famous one among those extant temples. The palace is situated on the Xixiu Ridge of Mount Li, Lintong District, Xi'an. ==See also== * N\u00fc Wa * Wusheng Laomu * Doumu * Xiwangmu * Jiutian Xuann\u00fc ==References== Category:Chinese deities Category:Chinese goddesses Category:Chinese salvationist religions ",
