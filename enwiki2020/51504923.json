    "text": "The Werder pistol model 1869 was an infantry and light cavalry falling block pistol, invented by Johann Ludwig Werder in Bavaria and based on his rifle design of 1868. It was one of the first centerfire pistols to be adopted for use by a European military. Although it was originally known as the \"Bavarian Lightning pistol\" because of its rate of fire, the Werder pistol proved too heavy for practical use, and was not used during the Franco-Prussian War. It was also fazed out by the Dreyse Rifles still used by 1870 and was put into training service in 1891 with the introduction of the Gewehr 88. == Sources and references == * Werder, Johann Ludwig, Horst Held = Antique Handguns Category:Pistols ",
