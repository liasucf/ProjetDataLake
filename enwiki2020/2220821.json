    "text": "Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel is a resort hotel located at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, owned by The Walt Disney Company and operated through its Parks, Experiences and Consumer Products division. The hotel was originally built and owned by the Tokyu Group, and opened in 1984 as the Emerald of Anaheim. It was renamed Pan Pacific Hotel, Anaheim in 1989 when Tokyu merged its Emerald and Pan Pacific hotel divisions. Disney purchased the hotel from Tokyu in 1995 and renamed it Disneyland Pacific Hotel. The hotel was rebranded as Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel on December 15, 2000, named after the formerly Paradise Pier (now Pixar Pier) area in Disney California Adventure Park that the hotel tower overlooks. ==History== Disneyland Pacific Hotel logo, 1996\u20132000 Tokyu Group built the 15-story Emerald of Anaheim in 1984. The hotel was renamed the Pan Pacific Hotel, Anaheim in 1989 when Tokyu consolidated its Emerald and Pan Pacific hotel brands. In December 1995, Disney purchased the hotel from Tokyu for a reported US$36 million and changed its name to Disneyland Pacific Hotel. As part of the 1998-2001 expansion of the Disneyland Resort, the hotel was re-branded as Disney's Paradise Pier Hotel to complement the themed land the hotel tower overlooks in the adjacent Disney California Adventure Park. The lobby and convention/banquet facilities have undergone several renovations since the re-branding, most notably in 2004 and 2005. At the time that the park opened, guests originally had an exclusive entrance to Disney's California Adventure Park, located between the Corn Dog Castle and Souvenir 66 in the Paradise Pier section of the park, but it was closed due to low use in 2004. The area is now the site of the expansion of Disney's Grand Californian Hotel & Spa. ==Facilities== The hotel complex consists of a high-rise guest room tower with 481 rooms, which includes 25 suites. At the base of the tower is the lobby, restaurants, a gift shop, over 30,000 square feet (3,000 m\u00b2) for meeting space, and a 7,250-square-foot (670 m\u00b2) ballroom. There is also an outdoor swimming pool and California Streamin' themed waterslide located on the third floor. ===Restaurants=== * Disney's PCH Grill *The Sand Bar * Surfside Lounge ===Store=== * Mickey in Paradise ==References== ==External links== * Category:Hotels in Disneyland Resort Category:Buildings and structures in Anaheim, California Category:Tourist attractions in Anaheim, California Category:Hotels established in 1984 Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1984 Category:Hotels established in 2000 Category:Skyscraper hotels in California Category:Skyscrapers in California ",
