I think I'd have to be there and see the ball and feel it and make sure it was deflated or not deflated. If there was a question there, then yes, I think he cheated.\" Asked later by a reporter about her response, Cantrell said \"It was kind of a funky question...I'm not a football player, and I really wasn't there to feel that ball.\" She beat out first runner-up Miss Mississippi 2015, Hannah Roberts, for the 2016 title and was crowned by Miss America 2015, Kira Kazantsev of New York, on September 13, 2015.
