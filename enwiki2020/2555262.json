    "text": "The Night is the fifth and final studio album by the alternative rock band Morphine. Jerome Deupree, the band's original drummer who had earlier quit due to health problems, rejoined alongside Billy Conway, thus making The Night Morphine's only album as a quartet rather than a trio. Recording sessions for the album were completed shortly before the sudden July 1999 death of bass player and lead singer Mark Sandman; the remaining members oversaw the final mixing process and the album was released in February 2000. The album was released on the DreamWorks label. ==Track listing== All songs written by Mark Sandman. # \"The Night\" \u2013 4:50 # \"So Many Ways\" \u2013 4:01 # \"Souvenir\" \u2013 4:40 # \"Top Floor, Bottom Buzzer\" \u2013 5:44 # \"Like a Mirror\" \u2013 5:26 # \"A Good Woman is Hard to Find\" \u2013 4:14 # \"Rope on Fire\" \u2013 5:36 # \"I'm Yours, You're Mine\" \u2013 3:46 # \"The Way We Met\" \u2013 2:59 # \"Slow Numbers\" \u2013 3:58 # \"Take Me with You\" \u2013 4:54 ==Personnel== Morphine *Mark Sandman \u2013 voice, 2 string slide bass, acoustic guitar, piano, organ *Dana Colley \u2013 baritone sax, tenor sax, bass sax *Jerome Deupree \u2013 drums (tracks 1\u20138, 10, 11) *Billy Conway \u2013 cocktail drum, drums, percussion Guests *Jane Scarpantoni \u2013 cello on \"The Night\", \"Rope on Fire\" and \"Take Me with You\" *Mike Rivard \u2013 double bass on \"Rope on Fire\" and \"Take Me with You\" *John Medeski \u2013 organ on \"Top Floor, Bottom Buzzer\" and \"I'm Yours, You're Mine\" *Billy Beard \u2013 hand drum on \"Rope on Fire\" *Brahim Fribgane \u2013 oud, frame drum on \"Rope on Fire\" *Joseph Kessler \u2013 viola on \"Rope on Fire\" and \"Take Me with You\" *Carolyn Kaylor, Linda Viens, Ramona Clifton, Margaret Garrett, Tara McManus \u2013 backing vocals ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !
