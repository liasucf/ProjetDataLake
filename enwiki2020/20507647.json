    "text": "The Lars Petterson-Fred Gurney Three-Decker is a historic triple decker house at 2 Harlow Street in Worcester, Massachusetts. Built about 1910, it is a good local example of Colonial Revival architecture, built by prominent local builder Lars Petterson. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. ==Description and history== The Lars Petterson-Fred Gurney Three-Decker is located northeast of downtown Worcester, in the Brittan Square neighborhood. It is set on the north side of Harlow Street, between Lincoln and Paine Streets. It is a three-story wood frame structure, its third floor under a cross-gabled gambrel roof, and its exterior finished mainly in wooden clapboards. The front facade is asymmetrical, with porches on the left, and a polygonal window bay on the right. The porches of the first two floors are supported by square posts with arched peaks between them; the second-story porch has been enclosed in glass. The third-floor porch is set in a round-arch recess under the gambrel roof. The house was built c. 1910 by Lars Petterson, a local builder who developed a number of other properties in Worcester. He retained ownership of this house into the 1920s, when he sold it to Fred Gurney, a superintendent at a wire factory. Early tenants appear to be have been employed either at the Norton Company factory in northern Worcester, or in one of the nearby steel and wire factories. ==See also== *Lars Petterson- James Reidy Three-Decker, 4 Harlow Street *Lars Petterson-Adolph Carlson Three-Decker, 76 Fairhaven Road *Lars Petterson-Silas Archer Three-Decker, 80 Fairhaven Road *National Register of Historic Places listings in eastern Worcester, Massachusetts ==References== Category:Apartment buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Massachusetts Category:Houses completed in 1910 Category:Apartment buildings in Worcester, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Worcester, Massachusetts ",
