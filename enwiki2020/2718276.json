    "text": "Sirius Passet is a Cambrian Lagerst\u00e4tte in Greenland. The Sirius Passet Lagerst\u00e4tte was named after the Sirius sledge patrol that operates in North Greenland. It comprises six places in Nansen Land, on the east shore of J.P. Koch Fjord in the far north of Greenland. It was discovered in 1984 by A. Higgins of the Geological Survey of Greenland. A preliminary account was published by Simon Conway Morris and others in 1987 and expeditions led by J. S. Peel and Conway Morris have returned to the site several times between 1989 and the present. A field collection of perhaps 10,000 fossil specimens has been amassed. It is a part of the Buen Formation. == Age == The fauna is inevitably compared to that of the Burgess Shale, although it is probably ten to fifteen million years older \u2013 vs. ) \u2013 and more closely contemporaneous with the fauna of the Maotianshan shales from Chengjiang, which are dated to . == Preservation == The preservation of the Sirius Passet is not typical of a Burgess Shale type, but rather represents silicification associated with a death mask, recalling the 'Ediacara-type' preservation of the Precambrian Ediacara biota. Geochemical analysis indicates that the fossils lived close to the boundary of an oxygen minimum zone, possibly being preserved in oxygen- starved periods. == Fauna == Although the fauna has not yet been fully described, it is known to consist of a moderate number of arthropods and sponges, and rare representatives of other groups. It has yielded the problematic taxon Halkieria, and the Panarthropods Kerygmachela and Pambdelurion, all of which have played prominent roles in discussions about the origins of the modern animal phyla. === Taxa from the Sirius Passet fauna === This is a partial list of taxa described from the Sirius Passet. * Aaveqaspis inesoni * Buenaspis forteyi * Buenellus higginsi * Hadranax augustus * Halkieria evangelista * Kerygmachela kierkegaardi * Kiisortoqia soperi * Kleptothule rasmusseni * Ooedigera peeli * Pambdelurion whittingtoni * Pauloterminus spinodorsalis * Phragmochaeta canicularis * Tamisiocaris borealis == References == == Further reading == * * == External links == * Palaeos.com: Cambrian Sirius Passet Category:Geologic formations of Greenland Category:Cambrian Greenland Category:Cambrian paleontological sites Category:Paleontology in Greenland Category:Lagerst\u00e4tten * ",
