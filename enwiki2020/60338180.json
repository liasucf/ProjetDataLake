    "text": "Pope Pius II Vocavit nos pius (13 October 1458) is a papal bull issued by Pope Pius II inviting all the European rulers to a Congress to prepare for a crusade against the Ottoman Empire. Pius declared that since the time of Constantine the Church had never been so trampled upon than she now was by the followers of the \"false prophet Mahomet\".Ludwig Pastor, The History of the Popes from the Close of the Middle Ages, Volume III (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner, & Co., 1894), p. 24. He claimed this was a punishment from God for the sins of the nations but that God had appointed him to the Holy See to deliver the world from this threat. Pius accepted this would be difficult but added: \"The bark of the Church often rocks to and fro, but it does not sink; it is buffeted, but not shattered; it is assailed, but not wrecked; God permits His people to be tried, but He will not suffer them to be overwhelmed\". A Congress was duly held in Mantua in 1459\u201360. ==Notes== Category:15th-century papal bulls Category:Documents of Pope Pius II ",
