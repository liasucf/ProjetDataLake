    "text": "The 2020 Portland mayoral election will determine the Mayor of Portland, Oregon for the term beginning in January 2021. Portland uses a nonpartisan system for local elections, in which all voters are eligible to participate. All candidates are listed on the ballot without any political party affiliation. All candidates meeting the qualifications competed in a blanket primary election on Tuesday, May 19, 2020. As no candidate received an absolute majority, a runoff election between the top two candidates is scheduled for Tuesday, November 3, 2020. Voters can also choose to write-in candidates. In the General Election, Portland voters will also be electing members of their City Commission and voting on local ballot initiatives. == Candidates == === Candidates who advanced to runoff === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Candidate !Experience !Announced !References |- | colspan=\"4\" |The following candidates advanced to the runoff election on April 2 |- |168x168px Ted Wheeler |53rd Mayor of Portland, Oregon Former Oregon State Treasurer | 139x139px (website) | |- | Sarah Iannarone 2020 Official Campaign Photo Sarah Iannarone |Community Activist Urban Policy Consultant | Sarah Iannarone 2020 Official Campaign Logo (website) | |} === Candidates eliminated in the first round === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Candidate !Experience !Announced !References |- | colspan=\"4\" |The following candidates were eliminated in the first round and did not advance to the runoff election |- |167x167px Teressa Raiford |Founder of Don't Shoot Portland | 192x192px (website) | |- |167x167px Bruce Broussard |Host of Oregon Voter Digest on PBS | 167x167px (website) | |- |167x167px Ozzie Gonzalez |Architect and Sustainability Consultant | (website) | |- | Piper Crowell |Director of Global Digital and Innovation Policy at Nike, Inc. | 179x179px (website) Suspended campaign March 25, 2020 | |- | Randy Rapaport |Real Estate Developer Educational Psychologist | | |- | Mark White |Co-Chair of the Portland City Charter Commission | | |- |146x146px Cash Carter |Former Portland Timbers team chef | (website) | |} ==== Candidates who received fewer than 1,000 votes ==== * Willie Banks, community advocate * Jarred Bepristis, bartender * Daniel Hoffman, homeless rights activist * Lew Humble, retired mechanic, perennial candidate * Michael Jenkins, cannabis grower * Sharon Joy, retired, community advocate * Floyd LaBar, yoga teacher * Beryl McNair, retired Federal government employee, candidate for Portland Mayor in 2008 * Michael O'Callaghan, activist * Mark White, program manager * Michael Burleson, community leader, activist, attorney at law (Suspended) === Declined to run === * Diego Hernandez, representative for Oregon's 47th House district *Jessica Vega Pederson, Multnomah County commissioner ==Endorsements== == Polling == === Runoff === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Poll source !Date(s) administered !Sample size !Margin of error ! style=\"width:75px;\" |Ted Wheeler ! style=\"width:75px;\" |Sarah Iannarone !Write In ! style=\"width:75px;\" |Undecided |- |DHM Research/OPB |October 7\u201411, 2020 | align=\"center\" |400 (LV) | align=\"center\" |\u00b14.9% | align=\"center\" |33% | align=\"center\" |34% | align=\"center\" |6% | align=\"center\" |28% |- |DHM Research/Portland Business Alliance |September 17\u201322, 2020 | align=\"center\" | \u2013 (LV) | align=\"center\" |\u00b14% | align=\"center\" |30% | align=\"center\" |41% | align=\"center\" |16% | align=\"center\" |13% |- |Public Policy Polling | align=\"center\" |June 17\u201318, 2020 | align=\"center\" |992 (V) | align=\"center\" |\u00b13.1% | align=\"center\" |33% | align=\"center\" |32% | align=\"center\" | \u2013 | align=\"center\" |35% |} == Results == === Primary === === Runoff === Since no candidate received a simple majority (50% plus one) vote in the primary election, the two candidates who received the most votes will run again in the general election on November 3, 2020.
