It begins at the confluence of the rivers Silala and Caj\u00f3n, at an elevation over 4,000 m asl. A part of its flow is diverted (between 50 and 60 l/s) and conducted across the desert to Chuquicamata for domestic water supply. About 8 km south, the waters of the river disappear in a floodplain area to reappear 15 km downstream at the so-called Ojos del San Pedro in the form of a partially overground stream, at the eastern border of a salt flat with a surface of 5 km\u00b2. Loa and its tributaries San Pedro, Silala and Salado Rivers Before discharging into Loa River, the river skirts the San Pedro volcano, where it has carved a 100-m-deep canyon through a rhyolite lava flow. ==References== *This article draws heavily on the corresponding article in the Spanish-language Wikipedia, accessed August 31, 2007. * Category:Rivers of Antofagasta Region Category:Rivers of Chile ",
