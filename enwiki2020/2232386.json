The name Satria which means knight in Sanskrit was chosen for Proton's 3-door hatchback to reflect the sportiness of the car. == Satria (C96, C97, C98, C99; 1994\u20132006) == 1996-2005 Proton Satria (front) 1996-2005 Proton Satria (rear) The first generation Proton Satria, also marketed as the Proton Compact in the United Kingdom, and the Proton 300 Series in various European markets is a 3-door hatchback based on the fourth generation Mitsubishi Mirage / Colt. It was unveiled on 12 November 1994 as the result of a joint venture between Proton and Diversified Resources Bhd. (DRB), and was first imported to Europe during 1995. The Proton Satria was produced at Automotive Manufacturers Malaysia's (AMM) plant in Pekan, Pahang and was initially distributed by Usahasama Proton-DRB (USPD), a company in which Proton held a 30% stake in late 1994. In Australia, the Satira was launched in 1997 with 3 variants oringally on offered: 1.5 GL, 1.5 GLi and 1.6 XLi. All three variants was fuel injected. The car was featured as a regular prize on the Australian television games how Sale of the Century. The Proton Satria was initially available in three variants at launch with two engine options, namely the old 12-valve carburetted 1.3-litre 4G13P unit from the Proton Saga and a newer 16-valve multipoint fuel injected 1.6-litre 4G92P unit. The old 12-valve carburetted 1.5-litre 4G15P, also from the Proton Saga was added to the range later in the Satria's production cycle. The 1.5 and 1.6-litre engines were fitted with either a 3-speed or 4-speed automatic transmission, and a 5-speed manual transmission was offered with all three engine configurations. On the exterior, the Proton Satria shared the vast majority of its front-end styling and interior parts and components with the Proton Wira, but the rear-end was left largely unchanged over the Mirage / Colt it was based on. The Proton Satria had a development cost of RM150 million in late 1994, and it was priced between RM38,000 and RM54,000 at launch. Trim levels were LSi, GLi, GLSi and SEi. The base-specification LSi had the 1.3-litre 12-valve engine only: GLi versions got the 1.5-litre 12-valve engine in addition to the 1.3-litre: whilst GLSi and SEi versions got the 1.6 16v engine as well as the 1.5 12v. A later facelift version featured a redesigned rear end, different from that of the original Mirage. These were launched in 1996 in Malaysia and later in other countries, and new XLi, S XLi and GTi trim levels were available. New 1.3 12v, 1.5 12v, and 1.6 16v petrol engines were available. In 2004 in Malaysia, the Satria Special Edition was launched. Three variants were offered: 1.3 GL M/T, 1.5 GL M/T and 1.5 GL A/T. No mechanical change compared to regular Satria's. Rather changes were mostly cosmetic that included the headlights internal casing painted black, an addition of an engine cover, hollow race style headrests for the front seats, revised metre graphics, gunmetal finish for the dashboard centre cluster, aluminum pedal, and a yellow gear shifter base. === Satria GTi === 1998-2005 Proton Satria GTi (C99) The Proton Satria GTi was launched in 1998 with a 1.8-litre Mitsubishi-sourced 4G93P engine (\"P\" for Proton), originally found in the Mitsubishi Lancer GSR, but here without the turbo and with an increase in compression to compensate. The Satria GTi was developed and re-engineered as a traditional hot hatch by Lotus in Hethel, England. The Satria GTi could sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 8.5 seconds, making it among the fastest Proton production models ever produced. A new body kit was also adopted for better aerodynamics. The Satria GTi also wore a 'Handling by Lotus' badge on the rear hatch. The engine and handling of the Satria GTi were progressively updated and revised between 1998 and 2005. The Mitsubishi version was produced from 1998 until mid-2002. The VDO (Siemens) version had been in production from mid-2002 until 2005 when Proton ceased production. The Proton Satria GTi launched in the United Kingdom in November 1999 with a \u00a314,500 price tag. It was equipped with air-conditioning, ABS, dual front power windows, electric mirrors and Recaro seats. Proton sold 160 units of the Satria GTi within its first six months in the U.K. Richard Hammond had reviewed the Proton Satria GTi alongside the more established Peugeot 206 GTi. The Satria GTi received more praise and approval as a traditional hot hatch, despite costing \u00a3500 more than the 206 GTi. ===Cabriolet=== A concept Proton Cabriolet was shown at the 1997 Frankfurt International Motor Show, with ambitions for sales in the UK from 1999 but this did not happen. === Satria R3 === The Proton Satria R3 is a limited edition Satria sold in Malaysia. It was officially soft-launched on 4 October 2004, then made available for booking on 17 October 2004. The term R3 stands for Race, Rally, Research. R3 is a redefined version of the Satria GTi by Proton's Racing development team in collaboration with Lotus. It houses the same 1800 cc Mitsubishi 4G93P engine but has undergone some minor adjustments by Lotus handling. The body shell has been improved with double stitch welded monocoque chassis with front and rear strut tower brace bars. Body weight has been lightened as well. It comes with Recaro SR4 semi-bucket seats, both Momo steering wheel and gear knob. == Satria Neo (BS3, BS6; 2006\u20132015) == 2007-2009 Proton Satria Neo GX in Australia.

Based on a new platform developed in-house by Proton (with some parts borrowed from the bigger Gen-2 and Waja), the car is currently only available in a three-door hatchback guise. The car was developed at a cost of RM500 million and four years, and was expected by Proton to generate a monthly sales volume of 2,000 - 2,500 units. The car was also intended to target those who are \"youthful and sporty\". The Satria Neo was launched by former Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. The Satria Neo is also the only Proton car to be sold in Japan.

The 1.6 M-line and top-of-the-range H-line models have 1.6 litre versions of the same engine, with an output of at 6,000 rpm and 148 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm. Both the M-line and H-line models have active system antennae which actively search for signals in areas with poor reception. All cars have the option of either 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic gearboxes supplied by Mitsubishi that are carried over from the previous Satria, with the H-line benefiting from safety features such as twin airbags, ABS with EBD and seatbelt pre-tensioners. All versions of the car come with an integrated Blaupunkt CD player. === Proton Satria Neo CPS === 2011 Proton Satria Neo CPS H-Line.

The Group N Proton Satria Neo rally cars will be based on stock standard road-registered 1600cc showroom models acquired by CUSCO, homologated according to FIA regulations for competition use, and retrofitted with CUSCO-developed aftermarket performance and race components. With the Satria Neo, CUSCO is essentially Proton's customer \u2013 they buy the body shells, equip them with CUSCO-developed race components, and then sell the completed Group N rally-going Neos to customers who will compete in Junior Rally Championships in Japan and Asia Pacific. Veteran Malaysian rally driver, Karamjit Singh piloted a CUSCO-tuned Proton Satria Neo 2WD in which he crossed the line to finish first in the overall 2011 APRC 2WD category on May 2011 Rally of Queensland as well as first in the N2 category. Three Satria Neos were fielded in the 2011 Japan Rally Championship in JN-3, one unit for the CUSCO Team and two for the CUSCO Junior Rally Team respectively. The latter finished with a class win in Rally Hokkaido 2011. In the 2012 season, only the Junior Rally Team drove the Satria Neos, whereas the CUSCO Team had replaced their unit with a Toyota 86. == References == == External links == *Proton Satria Neo R3 Satria Category:Hot hatches Category:Cars introduced in 1995 Category:2000s cars Category:2010s cars ",
