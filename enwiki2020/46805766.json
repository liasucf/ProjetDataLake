Like their debut, all songs were written, produced and recorded by the duo except the album's single \"Rise\" which was produced and mixed by TV on the Radio band member and producer Dave Sitek. On March 28, 2019, the band hosted 2 private events in Los Angeles which they called The Pink Chateau, an audio immersive, multi-sensory music experience. Guests were guided and wandered through a mansion wearing wireless headphones exploring different rooms where actors lived out erotic fantasies depicted from the movie. The new album was broadcast through the headphones along with spoken word directions and erotic tails from Angela. The end of the experience crescendoed into the band being revealed and performing live over the headphones in a hidden ballroom. To promote the movie and album, the band screened the movie around the United States primarily at Alamo Draft House Cinemas performing the score live over wireless headphones. The movie premiered at the Newport Beach Film Festival on April 26, 2019. Brooklyn Vegan calls the movie \"A dreamlike diorama of interconnected musical vignettes inspired by vintage French erotica and the faded colors of 1970s films. Each song on \u2018The Pink Chateau\u2019 serves as a portal through which the film's enigmatic female protagonist confronts her most deep-seated desires.\" While PopMatters wrote \"Perhaps the most intriguing project of the year thus far that melds alternative rock-pop music with risk- taking movie making\" and Art Matters called it \"a visual album of special magnificence. An Alice in Wonderland of queer female please and beauty.\" The album cover depicts a simple drawing of a flower, while the back cover reveals the flower as the genitalia of a woman. The band released limited edition \"Merkin\" vinyl covers containing different colored furry triangle patches. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * The Belt (2014) * The Pink Chateau (2019) ===Extended plays=== * In the Valley Below (2011) * Man Girl (2014) * Peaches Remixes (2014) * Elephant (2017) ===Singles=== * \"Peaches\" (2013) * \"Neverminders\" (2014) * \"Peaches\" (2014, re-release) #18 Billboard Alternative Songs, #33 Billboard Rock SongsIn the Valley Below - Charts & Awards; AllMusicBillboard chart history; Billboard *\"Bloodhands (Oh My Fever)\" (2017) *\"Rise\" (2019) === Feature Film === * The Pink Chateau (2019) ==References== ==External links== * Category:Indie rock musical groups from California Category:Dream pop musical groups ",
