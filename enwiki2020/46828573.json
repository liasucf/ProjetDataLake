It was the last biannual meeting of the international governing body of association football FIFA, since 1998 the congress has been held on an annual basis. The congress saw the election of Joseph \"Sepp\" Blatter as the 8th President of FIFA who succeeded Jo\u00e3o Havelange. Havelange had held the presidency since 1974. ==1998 presidential election== Voting for the presidential election took more than three hours, with the Swedish football administrator and president of the European football governing body UEFA Lennart Johansson considered the favourite to win. Johansson's rival was the Swiss-German football executive Joseph \"Sepp\" Blatter who had previously been an executive at the Swiss watch manufactures Longines and had served as the general secretary of FIFA since 1981. The first round of voting in the election did not produce an immediate victor (a two-thirds supermajority needed to avoid a second round), with Blatter receiving 111 votes to Johansson's 80, but Johansson conceded victory. ===Voting results=== {| border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 style=\"margin: 0.5em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" width=450px |colspan=3 align=center|51st FIFA Congress 8 June 1998 \u2013 Paris, France |- !width=75%|Candidate ! align=center| ! align=center| |- | Sepp Blatter | align=\"center\" |111 | align=\"center\" |Winner |- | Lennart Johansson | align=\"center\" |80 | align=\"center\" |Withdrew |} ==References== ==External links== *FIFA Congress official page Category:FIFA Congresses Category:1998 conferences Category:1998 FIFA World Cup Category:1998 in association football Category:1998 in French sport Category:Football in Paris Category:1998 in Paris Category:1997\u201398 in French football Category:June 1998 events in Europe Category:Events in Paris ",
