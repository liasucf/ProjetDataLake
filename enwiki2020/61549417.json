    "text": "The Suntan Special was a summer excursion train run by the Southern Pacific Railroad between San Francisco and Santa Cruz, California. It ran from 1927 to 1959. ==History== Trains operated over the former South Pacific Coast Railroad from 1927 until that line was destroyed by storm damage in February 1940. Trains originated in San Jose, California, until the departure point shifted to San Francisco in 1932 with at least three sections every summer Sunday and holiday. A section from Oakland, California, was added in 1934. As many as 3,500 passengers from the San Francisco Bay area paid $1.25 for a round trip visit to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. As many as seven double-headed sections originating in San Francisco, Oakland, or San Jose were required to carry these passengers. Service resumed over a longer route through Watsonville, California in April 1940. Service was suspended by World War II from 1941 through 1946, but resumed in July, 1947, carrying about 900 passengers per trip. The train would reach Santa Cruz about 11 AM and depart about 5 PM. The last train ran in September, 1959. ==References== Category:Passenger trains of the Southern Pacific Transportation Company Category:Named passenger trains of the United States Category:Railway services introduced in 1927 Category:Railway services discontinued in 1959 ",
