It was played on 29 January 2017 at Est\u00e1dio Algarve. The competition involved the 35 clubs playing in the top two tiers of the Portuguese football league system \u2013 18 from Primeira Liga and 17 from Segunda Liga \u2013 during the 2016\u201317 season. Reserve sides of Primeira Liga teams which played in the 2016\u201317 Segunda Liga were excluded from the competition. Moreirense defeated Braga 1\u20130 to win their first national cup in their first appearance in a national cup final. ==Background== On 19 June 2015, the Liga Portuguesa de Futebol Profissional (\"LPFP\") announced that the number of teams in the 2016\u201317 LigaPro season would be reduced to 22, thus reducing the number of teams that would play in the Ta\u00e7a da Liga from 37 to 35. On 28 June 2016, the LPFP approved some changes in relation to the semi- finals matches. It was settled that both the semi-finals and final match were to be played in the same week and in the same stadium. Braga made their second appearance in the Ta\u00e7a da Liga final after their first final in 2013, where they defeated Porto 1\u20130. Moreirense had their first appearance in any national competition final in the club's history. Both clubs are from Braga Football Association. In Braga's and Moreirense's entire history, the two teams had played one another 15 times \u2013 Braga won eight matches, Moreirense won one match and the teams drew six matches. Before the final, the last meeting between both sides had been in the domestic league, on 22 December 2016, with hosts Braga defeating Moreirense 2\u20131. ==Route to the final== Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away; N: neutral). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !colspan=3|Braga !Round !colspan=3|Moreirense |- style=\"background:#c1e0ff\" |Opponent |Result |Stadium |rowspan=2|First round |Opponent |Result |Stadium |- |colspan=3|Bye |colspan=3|Bye |- |- style=\"background:#c1e0ff\" |Opponent |Result |Stadium |rowspan=2|Second round |Opponent |Result |Stadium |- |colspan=3|Bye |Estoril |1\u20130 (H) |Parque de Jogos Almeida Freitas |- |- style=\"background:#c1e0ff\" |Opponent |Result |Stadium |Third round |Opponent |Result |Stadium |- |Rio Ave |1\u20132 (H) |Est\u00e1dio Municipal de Braga | style=\"background:#c1e0ff\"|Matchday 1 |Feirense |1\u20132 (A) |Est\u00e1dio Marcolino de Castro |- |Sporting da Covilh\u00e3 |4\u20130 (H) |Est\u00e1dio Municipal de Braga | style=\"background:#c1e0ff\"|Matchday 2 |Belenenses |3\u20133 (H) |Parque de Jogos Almeida Freitas |- |Mar\u00edtimo |0\u20131 (A) |Est\u00e1dio do Mar\u00edtimo | style=\"background:#c1e0ff\"|Matchday 3 |Porto |1\u20130 (H) |Parque de Jogos Almeida Freitas |- |colspan=3 valign=top|Group C winners {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !width=175 |Team !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=20 | |- style=\"background:#cfc\" |align=left|Braga |3||2||0||1||6||2||+4||6 |- |align=left|Rio Ave |3||2||0||1||4||2||+2||6 |- |align=left|Mar\u00edtimo |3||1||1||1||2||2||0||4 |- |align=left|Sporting da Covilh\u00e3 |3||0||1||2||1||7||\u22126||1 |} | style=\"background:#c1e0ff\"|Final standings |colspan=3 valign=top|Group B winners {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !width=175 |Team !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=20 | !width=20 | |- style=\"background:#cfc\" |align=left|Moreirense |3||2||1||0||6||4||+2||7 |- |align=left|Belenenses |3||0||3||0||5||5||0||3 |- |align=left|Feirense |3||0||2||1||4||5||\u20131||2 |- |align=left|Porto |3||0||2||1||1||2||\u20131||2 |} |- style=\"background:#c1e0ff\" |Opponent |Result |Stadium |Knockout phase |Opponent |Result |Stadium |- |Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal |0\u20133 (N) |Est\u00e1dio Algarve | style=\"background:#c1e0ff\"|Semi-finals |Benfica |3\u20131 (N) |Est\u00e1dio Algarve |} ===Braga=== Braga entered the 2016\u201317 Ta\u00e7a da Liga in the third round.
