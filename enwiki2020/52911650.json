    "text": "Einar Sveinsson (16 November 1906 \u2013 12 March 1973) was an Icelandic architect. He was the City Architect of Reykjav\u00edk between 1934\u20131973, and widely considered to have played a key role in shaping the appearance of Reykjav\u00edk in the mid-20th century. Einar was the first Icelander to study architecture in Germany, doing so at the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt between 1927 and 1932. He completed his degree in 1932. Einar was influenced by the Bauhaus style and introduced functionalist architecture to Iceland. Some of his notable works include Laugarnessk\u00f3li, Melask\u00f3li, Langholtssk\u00f3li, Heilsuverndarst\u00f6\u00f0 Reykjav\u00edkur, Borgarsp\u00edtalinn, Vogask\u00f3li, Laugardalslaug, and the bus terminal at Snorrabraut 56, which he co-designed with \u00c1g\u00fast P\u00e1lsson. Melask\u00f3li was considered so exquisite in its early years that foreign dignitaries were often brought to the building for meetings. He is widely considered to excel at crafting interiors. At the time, he was criticized for the cost of many of his buildings. His buildings have, however, lasted long without renovation and thus proved quite cost-effective in the long-term. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Icelandic architects Category:1906 births Category:1973 deaths Category:People from Reykjav\u00edk Category:20th-century architects ",
