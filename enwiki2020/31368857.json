The hospital is located in the La Boca neighborhood. ==History== The oldest antecedent of the Argerich Hospital is the La Boca Sanitary Station, inaugurated in 1897 during the administration of Mayor Francisco Alcobendas. It was located on 555, 5 Brandsen Street and it was a simple aid room built by the neighbors, \u201cLa Asistencia\u201d. With the increase in demand and the rapid growth of the neighborhood, a new building was already necessary in 1900, and opened at Pinz\u00f3n 546. On October 28, 1904. The name of Dr. Cosme Argerich was given to the hospital. The current building of the hospital was built by the General Directorate of Architecture of the Ministry of Public Works, and transferred, before its opening, to the Municipality of the City of Buenos Aires, on November 8, 1945. The new Hospital Argerich was finally opened on 30 December 1945. The hospital was built on land formerly owned by the Catalinas company, founded by Francisco Seeber in the late 19th century. This company was the owner of a dock and two large areas of port warehouses, which were named Catalinas Norte and Catalinas Sur. The company disappeared in the 1940s, selling both extensive lands. Catalinas Sur, in the La Boca neighborhood, was later transformed by the Municipality into a public housing neighborhood, and retained its old name, with which the housing complex is known today. In 1952 the area of cardiovascular surgery, the area of ileopancreatic surgery and hemodynamic diagnostics and treatments and infrastructure for 173 beds were added. In 1997, it was remodeled again by the City Government, according to the project of the architects Aftali\u00f3n-Bischof-Egozcu\u00e9-Vidal . In 2010, 34 deaths due to bacteria occurred in the hospital of the City Government. For the deaths, the former Buenos Aires Health Minister criticized the head of government Mauricio Macri, considering that, during his three years in office, \" City hospitals went back 50 years in \"quality of care for disinvestment in personnel and technology. ==References== * Category:Hospitals in Buenos Aires ",
