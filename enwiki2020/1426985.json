    "text": "The Drepanidae is a family of moths with about 660 species described worldwide. They are generally divided in three subfamilies (Minet and Scoble, 1999;) which share the same type of hearing organ. Thyatirinae, previously often placed in their own family, bear a superficial resemblance to Noctuidae. Many species in the Drepanid family have a distinctively hook-shaped apex to the forewing, leading to their common name of hook-tips. The larvae of many species are very distinctive, tapering to a point at the tail and usually resting with both head and tail raised. They usually feed on the leaves of trees and shrubs, pupating between leaves spun together with silk. ==Taxonomy== *Subfamily Drepaninae - hook-tips *Subfamily Thyatirinae - false owlets *Subfamily Cyclidiinae *Unassigned to subfamily **Hypsidia Rothschild, 1896 **Yucilix Yang, 1978 ==See also== *List of drepanid genera == References == * (1986): Collins Guide to the Insects of Britain and Western Europe * (1999): The Drepanoid/Geometroid Assemblage.
