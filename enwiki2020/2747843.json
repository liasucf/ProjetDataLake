He posted a 9-4 record with a 2.20 ERA and 13 complete games. Terrell set the league record for innings pitched in a season, and was named the league's outstanding pitcher. Terrell was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2007. On April 1, 1982, the Mets traded outfielder Lee Mazzilli to the Texas Rangers for minor league pitchers Ron Darling and Terrell. On August 6, 1983, Terrell hit a two-run home run off future Hall of Famer Ferguson Jenkins of the Chicago Cubs in the third inning, then another two-run homer the very next inning. Jenkins shut down the rest of the offense, but lost the game 4-1. Later that same month, Terrell had another three hits, including a three-run home run. In five years as a hitter, Terrell logged only three home runs and ten runs batted in but all three home runs and seven of the ten RBI came in a seventeen-day span. Against the California Angels at Tiger Stadium on August 20, 1986, Terrell had a no-hitter broken up with two out in the ninth by a Wally Joyner double. It was the only hit he would allow in a 3-0 Tiger victory. He also surrendered the first of Mark McGwire's 583 home runs on August 25, 1986. Terrell had a career-best 17 wins during the Tigers drive to the 1987 American League East pennant. Terrell finished with a career mark of 111-124 in 321 games, with a 4.22 all-time ERA. He struck out 929 in 1,986.2 innings pitched. Although a weak hitting pitcher, posting a .120 batting average (23-for-192) with 3 home runs and 10 RBI, Terrell was an above average fielding pitcher. He recorded a .980 fielding percentage with only 10 errors in 489 total chances and started 38 double plays. ==Personal life== Terrell was born in Jeffersonville, Indiana, and attended Morehead State University, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He batted left-handed and threw right-handed. He had several children. ==References== ==External links== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Chatham Anglers players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Baseball players from Indiana Category:Morehead State Eagles baseball players Category:New York Mets players Category:New York Yankees players Category:People from Jeffersonville, Indiana Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:San Diego Padres players ",
