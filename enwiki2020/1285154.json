The 65-km-long metre gauge line from Dibrugarh to Margherita was constructed mainly for transportation of tea and coal. This company later started the first passenger train in Assam by the name of Dibru Sadiya Railway. The North Eastern Railway was formed on 14 April 1952 by amalgamating two railway systems: the Assam Railway and Oudh and Tirhut Railway. Later, it was bifurcated into two railway zones on 15 January 1958, the North Eastern Railway (India) and the Northeast Frontier Railway.Rao, M.A. (1988). Indian Railways, New Delhi: National Book Trust, pp.42-4 to better serve the needs of the northeastern states. ==Operational area== Map of Northeast Frontier Railway zone railway lines Agartala Railway Station Dibrugarh railway station The area of Northeast Frontier Railway operations is characterized by exceptional beauty and at the same time by some of the most arduous terrain. This difficult terrain limits the rail network expansion, and the only state with a decent rail network is Assam. The network is not broad gauge in many parts and the rail lines are antiquated with speeds at some sections being limited to a maximum of . Before the Saraighat Bridge was constructed, passengers had to get down on the Amingaon side of the Brahmaputra and take a ferry across to Pandu Junction from where they could resume their journey. The majority of the tracks have been converted to BG and electrification is in process starting from Katihar till Guwahati. ===Major sections=== A few of the major sections under the Northeast Frontier Railway zone are: * Eklakhi\u2013Balurghat branch line *New Bongaigaon\u2013Guwahati section *New Jalpaiguri\u2013New Bongaigaon section *Rangia-Murkongselek section *Guwahati\u2013Lumding section *Lumding\u2013Dibrugarh section *Silchar\u2013Sabroom section *Katihar\u2013Siliguri section *Katihar-Jogbani branch line == Darjeeling Himalayan Railway == Darjeeling to Ghoom Heritage Narrow Gauge Train The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is maintained and governed under the responsibility of Katihar division. It ascends from New Jalpaiguri (Siliguri); the climb begins at Sukna, continues uninterruptedly to Ghum () and descends the final to Darjeeling. After independence, India's partition resulted in the isolation of the Northeast region. Consequently, the DHR was merged into Assam Railways, it was closed for the construction of the Assam\u2013Bengal link line and one of its extension lines to Kishanganj was converted to metre gauge. DHR's other extension line to Kalimpong was washed away due to floods. On reopening, the DHR was merged with North Eastern Railway in 1952 and later into Northeast Frontier Railway in 1958. The DHR achieved worldwide fame for many reasons such as: * A gateway to the Himalayas * The tiny four-wheeled steam locomotives of the 19th century * The curves, loops, \"Z\"s and steep grades crisscrossing the road An interest in DHR all along has ensured that it continues to operate notwithstanding very heavy losses. The steam locomotive is an icon of this Railway. Tindharia workshop has kept 13 locomotives surviving, some of which are over 100 years old and the youngest is about 70 years old. Timeline of DHR: * 20 January 1948: Purchased by the Government of India * 26 January 1948: Transferred to Assam Rail Link * 26 January 1950: Transferred to Assam Railway * 14 January 1952: Transferred to North Eastern Railway * 15 January 1958: Transferred to Northeast Frontier Railway Jan Shatabdi Express Kaziranga Express Mahananda Express ==Loco sheds== * Diesel Loco Shed, Siliguri * Diesel Loco Shed, Malda Town * Diesel Loco Shed, New Guwahati City ==See also== * All India Station Masters' Association (AISMA) * Zones and divisions of Indian Railways ==Further reading== * ==References== ==External links== * Northeast Frontier Railway * Indian Railways Online (official site) * Indian Railways Fan Club * IR.
