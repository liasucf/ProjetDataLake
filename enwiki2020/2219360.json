    "text": "Corey Schwab (born November 4, 1970) is a former Canadian professional ice hockey goalie. He was drafted in the 10th round, 200th overall in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils. Schwab won the 2003 Stanley Cup with the New Jersey Devils and the 1995 Calder Cup with the Albany River Rats. ==Playing career== Following a three-year WHL career in Seattle, Schwab saw time with the ECHL's Cincinnati Cyclones and the AHL's Utica Devils before settling in with the AHL's Albany River Rats for two seasons. During the 1994-95 season, Schwab was joined by fellow 1990 draftee Mike Dunham between the pipes. While Schwab led the league in goals against average with 2.59, the two combined for the AHL's fewest goals against and were awarded the Harry \"Hap\" Holmes Memorial Trophy as well as the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the playoff MVP's helping the River Rats capture their first Calder Cup title. The next season, Schwab saw his first action in the NHL when he was called up to New Jersey where he appeared in ten games. At the end of the season, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning, where he stayed for three seasons. He then went out West to the Vancouver Canucks for another brief stay and spent time that year with the AHL's Syracuse Crunch and IHL's Orlando Solar Bears before moving on to play with the IHL's Kansas City Blades in 2000-01. Schwab began the 2001-02 season at the Toronto Maple Leafs' training camp without a contract. After an impressive pre-season, he was signed to the team as the backup goaltender for Curtis Joseph. Schwab started 30 games for the Leafs and had a career high 12 wins before signing as a free agent in the off-season with the team that originally drafted him back in 1990, the New Jersey Devils. The return to New Jersey was very timely for Schwab, as the Devils claimed the Stanley Cup in 2003 - the franchise's third title in nine years and Schwab's first as a player. Schwab's final game was played on January 17, 2004 where he posted a 2\u20131 overtime victory over the Washington Capitals. Schwab finished his career having played in 147 regular season NHL games amassing 43 wins, 63 losses and 13 ties with a goals against average of 2.89, a save percentage of .896, and 6 shutouts. Schwab appeared in 40 minutes of postseason action over 3 games with the Maple Leafs and Devils stopping all 13 shots he faced. He served as goaltending development coach and scout for three seasons (2005\u201308) with the Tampa Bay Lightning. He was the goaltending development coach for the San Jose Sharks (2008-2015). He is currently the goaltending coach for the Arizona Coyotes. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:75%\" |- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! align=\"center\" colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! align=\"center\" rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! align=\"center\" colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | Regular season ! align=\"center\" rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! align=\"center\" colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | Playoffs |- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
