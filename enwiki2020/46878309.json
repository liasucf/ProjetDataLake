    "text": "The 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment is the BCT cavalry squadron assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division. Carrying the lineage of Company A, United States Regiment of Dragoons, the squadron has served in the Mexican War, Civil War, various Indian Wars, the Spanish\u2013American War, the Philippine Insurrection, World War II, Vietnam, and the Global War on Terrorism. == History == === Early history === From 1833-1945, the 1st US Cavalry Regiment has distinguished itself across most of America's battlefields. The current 1st Squadron carries the lineage of the original Company A from the unit's constitution in 1833 through the implementation of the Combat Arms Regimental System in 1957. For more information on the early beginnings of the 1st Squadron's pre-history, see the 1st Cavalry Regiment. === Cold War; 1945-1954 === After World War II, the Regiment reorganized as the 1st Tank Battalion, was later converted to the 1st Constabulary Squadron, serving on occupation duty in Germany until December 1948, when it was inactivated. Reactivated as the 1st Medium Tank Battalion in March, 1951 at Fort Hood, Texas, the Regiment served with Combat Command A, 1st Armored Division, until February 1962 when the remainder of the 1st Armored Division was reactivated. At this time the Regiment was redesignated as the 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment (or 1-1 Cavalry), and resumed its historic role as the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of its parent organization. During October, 1962, as a result of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Squadron moved to Fort Stewart, Georgia with other elements of the 1st Armored Division. As the world situation eased, the Squadron participated in a STRAC (Strategic Army Corps) mobility exercise and amphibious training at Port Everglades, Florida. During the spring of 1963 the Squadron took part in the STRICOM (Simulation, Training & Instrumentation Command) exercise \u201cSwift Strike,\u201d and then returned to Fort Hood. === Vietnam War === In January, 1967, the commander of 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment, was called to Vietnam to assist in studying the role of Armor in Vietnam. Upon his return to Fort Hood, Texas in March, 1967, the Squadron began training for a deployment to Vietnam. From March to August 1967, the officers and men of the Squadron trained daily in all phases of Squad, Platoon, Troop and Squadron operations. The Squadron received superior ratings in their annual training test, annual general inspection, and Command Maintenance Management Inspections during this period. It surpassed every assigned mission with such professionalism, that in late July 1967, the Squadron was awarded the Third US Army Corps Superior Unit Award. Arriving in Vietnam in August, 1967, the Squadron consisted of three Armored Cavalry Troops and one Air Cavalry Troop, D Troop, which was not deployed until July 1968. The Squadron immediately deployed in the I Corps Tactical Zone around the city of Chu Lai. It was committed to battle two days after its arrival, operating against the North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong. From 1 September 1967 to June 1968, the Squadron was involved in eleven major battles and numerous smaller engagements; among these were Cigar Island, Que Son Valley, Pineapple Forest, the Western Valley and Tam Ky. The Air Cavalry Troop, Troop D, joined the Squadron 21 July 1968, disembarking at Da Nang and flew directly to Camp Eagle. The Troop remained on combat duty in I CORP for the next four years using the call sign Sabre. The Squadron was further augmented by Troop F, 8th Cavalry, attached to the Squadron as its \u201ceyes and ears.\u201d In the Pineapple Forest Battle of February 1968, the ground-air cavalry team had its greatest victory, killing 180 of the enemy without losing one of its own number. 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment remained in the field continuously during the Vietnam War from 1967-1972, attached as an independent Squadron to elements of the 101st Airborne Division and took part in 13 campaigns. The Squadron departed Vietnam on 10 May 1972. === Cold War: 1972-1991 === 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment returned to Europe and the 1st Armored Division. It took up a frontier mission in December 1978, conducting surveillance of the international border between the Federal Republic of Germany and Czechoslovakia. While watching the border, it eventually gained additional aviation elements to help support its mission. V Corps' Kiowa force stood at 27 soldiers strong, hailing from B\u00fcdingen, Germany. At this time, the Squadron consisted of 3 aerial troops: D Troop (\"Desperado\"), E Troop (\"Executioner\") and F Troop (\"Falcon\"). They conducted aerial reconnaissance missions and reported the composition/disposition of obstacles or enemy positions, to the 1st Armored Division headquarters. As with their forebearers, the Kiowas lead the Division in all things Scout related. They also worked closely with the Abrams tanks and Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicles on the ground.Units operated out of Camp Pitman a forward base located in Weiden, West Germany.Bco.501st M.I.Bn (Katterbach) had a permanent detachment at the camp. === Gulf War === In February 1991, the Squadron spearheaded the 1st Armored Division\u2019s attack into Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. As the Division's best Cavalry Squadron, 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment made first enemy contact with the Medina Division and informed the Division Commander of the location of the enemy forces. The subsequent battle, known as Medina Ridge, soon involved the Division\u2019s 2nd Brigade consisting of 1-35th Armor, 4-70th Armor, 2-70th Armor and 6-6th Infantry. Medina Ridge was one of the few battles during Desert Storm where American forces encountered significant Iraqi resistance and found it extremely difficult to advance. The Iraqi forces were well-deployed. They could not be seen by American forces advancing until after they had cleared the top of the ridge-line. This defilade position gave the Iraqis protection from the powerful long-range direct fire of the M1 Abrams tanks and the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. The American units found it necessary to engage an entrenched enemy at close range, resulting in a higher degree of damage to the American armored units. Following the Gulf War, 1st Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment returned with the Division to Germany where it remained until the Bosnian Conflict (1992-1995). ==Lineage & Honors== ===Lineage=== * Constituted 2 March 1833 in the Regular Army as Company A, United States Regiment of Dragoons. * Organized 12 August 1833 at Nashville, Tennessee * Redesignated 15 May 1836 as Company A, 1st Regiment of Dragoons * Redesignated 3 August 1861 as Company A, 1st Cavalry :(Cavalry companies officially designated as troops in 1883) :(1st Cavalry assigned in December 1917 to the 15th Cavalry Division; relieved in May 1918 from assignment to the 15th Cavalry Division; assigned 20 August 1921 to the 1st Cavalry Division; relieved 3 January 1933 from assignment to the 1st Cavalry Division) * Reorganized and redesignated 16 January 1933 as Company A, 1st Cavalry, Mechanized * Reorganized and redesignated 15 July 1940 as Company A, 1st Armored Regiment, an element of the 1st Armored Division * Reorganized and redesignated 20 July 1944 as Company A, 1st Tank Battalion * Converted and redesignated 1 May 1946 as Troop A, 1st Constabulary Squadron, an element of the 15th Constabulary Regiment * Inactivated 20 December 1948 in Germany; concurrently converted and redesignated as Company A, 1st Medium Tank Battalion, an element of the 1st Armored Division. * Activated 7 March 1951 at Ft.
