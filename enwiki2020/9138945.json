    "text": "Horizon is a current events television program produced by KAET in Phoenix, Arizona. It is one of the two locally produced news programs for KAET, the other being its sister program, Horizonte. ==About== === Mission Statement === For more than 25 years, viewers have relied on Horizon for in-depth coverage of issues of concern to Arizonans. From the impeachment trial of former Governor Evan Mecham, AZSCAM hearings, public debate over the baseball stadium and the 1996 Arizona Presidential Forum, Horizon has consistently provided unprecedented, insightful public affairs programming. Unlike conventional newscasts, Horizon goes beyond headlines and sound bites. The program's format of pre-taped reports and studio discussion offers viewers an opportunity to explore all sides of each issue. HORIZON reports examine a wide range of subjects including politics, consumer affairs, the environment, business, health concerns and social and legal issues. While viewers remain our most important critics, Eight is proud of the many awards Horizon has received from such organizations as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the American Bar Association, Associated Press Broadcasters Association of Arizona and the Arizona Press Club. And the Arizona Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences has honored Horizon numerous times with The Governors' Award, its most prestigious Emmy. === Host and Managing Editor === Ted Simons has worked in television and radio in the Phoenix area for more than 20 years, and got his start in TV here at Eight as a public affairs producer/reporter. He most recently hosted the afternoon drive news/talk show on KTAR radio. The long-time Valley journalist previously worked as news director/morning show host for KZON-FM and news/sports anchor/reporter at KPHO-TV. Simons was also sports director/anchor at KOFY-TV in San Francisco, Calif. ==Format== Horizon has two formats: a normal, in-depth news discussion and interviews on current hot-button issues from Monday to Thursday, with a special \"Journalists' Roundtable\" every Friday that features a panel of local radio and print journalists, who will discuss the issues of the work week that has passed by. ==Production== The show is produced at KAET's studios in the Cronkite Building on Arizona State University's downtown Phoenix campus. Student employees are involved in production aspects of the show and work under the guidance of trained journalists with experience in the area. ==Present day== In January 2007, longtime host Michael Grant departed from the show after 25 years of service. A search for a new host began immediately. This ended in November, when local television/radio personality Ted Simons was chosen as host. == References == Category:1981 American television series debuts Category:1980s American television talk shows Category:1990s American television talk shows Category:2000s American television talk shows Category:Local talk shows in the United States Category:2010s American television talk shows ",
