    "text": "Little Red Riding Hood is a 1997 black and white short film based on the traditional children's fairytale Little Red Riding Hood. Written and directed by David Kaplan, it features Christina Ricci in the title role.http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b80de8ce2 The film bears similarities to some of the earliest versions of the fairytale, including the Italian \"La finta nonna\" (The False Grandmother).https://www.mayastarling.com/little-red-riding-hood-moral- warnings-and-sexual-implications/ ==Plot== This version of the classic children's story employs elements of black comedy. The black-and-white scenario shows the forest of the tale, and narrator Quentin Crisp is the only voice heard in the film. An androgynous anthropomorphized black wolf, portrayed by ballet dancer Timour Bourtasenkov, tries to trick Little Red Riding Hood. He successfully eats her grandmother, and then tries to eat her. However, she tricks him and survives. She is clever enough manage without being rescued by the huntsman, often included in versions of the tale, and does not \"rescue\" the eaten grandmother at all; she in fact eats her grandmother's flesh as well, even after being warned by a cat. She is thus portrayed, in another contrast to traditional depictions of the story, as being less than innocent. == Cast == *Christina Ricci: Little Red Riding Hood *Timour Bourtasenkov: The Wolf *Evelyn Solann: The Grandmother *Quentin Crisp: Narrator ==Reception == ===Awards=== *Avignon Film Festival, 1998: Prix Panavision award, David Kaplanhttps://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000069/1998 *Avignon/New York Film Festival, 1998: Vision Award, Scott Ramseyhttps://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000070/1998 *Williamsburg Brooklyn Film Festival 1999: Certificate of Excellence \u2014 Best Cinematography, Scott Ramseyhttps://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000699/1999 ==See also== *Red Riding Hood, a 2006 film taking another unconventional approach to the fable *Red Hot Riding Hood, a 1943 Tex Avery cartoon emphasizing the sexual undertones of the character ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:American films Category:1997 films Category:1997 short films Category:Films based on Little Red Riding Hood Category:American short films ",
