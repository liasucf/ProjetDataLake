    "text": "France Info (; stylized as franceinfo:) is a French domestic rolling news channel which started broadcasting on 31 August 2016 at 6:00 p.m. on the Web. TV broadcasting began on 1 September 2016 at 8:00 p.m. on most TV operators (Bouygues Telecom, Orange, SFR, Numericable...), and on the TNT (Digital Terrestrial Television). As for and Canalsat, it began on 6 September. France Info involves France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, Radio France, France M\u00e9dias Monde (with France 24) and the Institut national de l'audiovisuel (INA). It shares its name with a global news service which gathers the TV channel itself, the radio channel France Info and the website www.francetvinfo.fr. France Info broadcasts from 06:00 seven days a week until 00:00 and simulcasts France 24 overnight. France Info can be watched live on YouTube (with a 12-hour rewind availability) and web. == Background == After LCI, CNEWS and BFMTV (available on free national DTT), and France 24 (worldwide and in \u00cele-de-France only), France Info is the fifth rolling news channel in France. The goal of France Info is to distance itself from the competition by focusing heavily on straight news coverage, hoping to offer a higher-quality news service. The channel's music was produced by French composer, Jean-Michel Jarre. France Info is supported by France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, in particular France 2 and 3. The channel has 204 employees (176 at France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, 28 at Radio France), as well as 3,000 journalists distributed among the editorial teams of France 2, France 3 R\u00e9gions, R\u00e9seau Outre-Mer premi\u00e8re, Franceinfo, France Inter and France 24. Its total budget is 15 million euros for France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions and 3.5 million euros for Radio France. It includes the characteristic elements of rolling news channels (live bulletins, distinctive daypart-separated blocks) and debate and analysis programs. The sister radio station provides headline reminders three times each hour at :20, :40 and :50 past (four times an hour at :10, :20, :40 and :50 past between September 2016 and mid-January 2017), France 24 fills in the overnight programming (that would otherwise be filled in by continuous repeats of the day's last live newscast), and Ina offers magazines on \"the news seen through a historical eye\". France Info thus becomes a global public-service news offering that brings together radio and television and makes use of the experience of the public service as a whole in terms of information. This is the first major collaboration between public radio and television since 1975; at that time France Inter supplied the footage in the bulletins of the 3e cha\u00eene couleur de l'ORTF (now France 3). == Programs == Unlike other news channels, France Info can be watched without sound, thanks to some reports being text-heavy. Journalists can explain the stories using an interactive touchscreen. The cameraman moves along with the journalists, with a mobile device accompanied. The tone is mostly offbeat, without forgetting to be serious if required. The presentation - done in a studio integrated directly into the newsroom by an anchorman and/or anchorwoman, serving as both news anchors and segment introducers - as well as the interactivity with the \"Le Live\" thread seen on the channel's website, are other distinctive differences. * France 24 - world news in simulcast with France 24 * franceinfo: et tout est plus clair - flagship banner for weekday afternoon and weekend rolling news block * 6h30:8h30 - breakfast rolling news block with Samuel \u00c9tienne and Johanna Ghiglia *10h30:13h - morning rolling news block with Louis Laforge and Marianne Th\u00e9oleyre *14h:17h - afternoon rolling news block with Sophie Le Saint *17h:19h - evening rolling news block with Djamel Mazi and Lucie Chaumette *21h:23h - late night rolling news block before Le 23h *Le 23h - final bulletin prior to overnight France 24 simulcast, introduced to help replace Soir 3 which previously aired on France 3 with Patricia Loison (Monday-Friday) and Sorya Khaldoun (Saturday and Sunday/Friday(Replacement)) * Le journal - hourly live news bulletins, last 12 minutes * :l'info - live headlines at :20, :40 and :50 every hour, simulcast with Franceinfo Radio * l'essentiel de l'info - bottom-of-the-hour headlines between 9am and 6pm * Les inform\u00e9s de Franceinfo - nightly news debates, simulcast with Franceinfo Radio * Questions politiques - Sunday political interview, simulcast with France Inter == Presenters == === Studio Gilles Jacquier (from France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions) === ==== Main presenters ==== * Samuel \u00c9tienne (6:30-9:30) *Djamel Mazi (9:30-13:30) * Louis Laforge (17:00-20:00) *Julien Benedetto (21:00-0:00) ==== Newsreaders ==== * Cl\u00e9mence de la Baume (21:00-0:00) * Sorya Khaldoun (17:00-20:00) * Camille Grenu (weekends 18:00-0:00) * Christophe Gascard * Djamel Mazi * Karine Baste-R\u00e9gis (6:30-9:30) * S\u00e9bastien Thomas * Marine Demazure * Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique H\u00e9nault * Marianne Th\u00e9oleyre * Alexandra Uzan === Studio \"L'Info\" (from Maison de la Radio) === Staff present live headlines every 10 minutes on TV and radio: * Agathe Mahuet * L\u00e9o Chapuis * Bintily Diallo * Yasmina Adila * Pierrick Bonno * Edwige Coupez * David Dauba * Diane Ferchit * Gilles Halais * Victor Matet * St\u00e9phane Milhomme * Lorrain S\u00e9n\u00e9chal === Studio 221 (from Maison de la Radio) === Radio presenters whose their shows are also simulcast on TV: * 8H30 Aphatie: Jean-Michel Aphatie, Guy Birenbaum, Fabienne Sintes and Gilles Bornstein * Les Inform\u00e9s de Franceinfo: J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cadet (Sunday) and Jean-Mathieu Pernin (weekday) * Le Clasico: Matteu Maestracci and Nicolas Demorand (weekday) and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cadet (Saturday) * 8H30 Politique: Ya\u00ebl Goosz and Jules Lavie == References == == External links == * Official Site * France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions Corporate site * Radio France site * France M\u00e9dias Monde site * Institut national de l'audiovisuel site Category:France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions Category:France M\u00e9dias Monde Category:Radio France Category:Television channels and stations established in 2016 Category:Television stations in France Category:24-hour television news channels in France Category:2016 establishments in France Category:French-language television stations ",
