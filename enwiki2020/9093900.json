They are members of the Firelands Conference. In 1957, Plymouth consolidated their district with New Haven to create Huron Valley High School.http://www.crawfordcountybasketball.com/huronerieleague.html The Ohio Supreme Court voided the merger in February 1958, and the schools immediately split apart. Eventually, just in time for the 1958\u201359 school year, Plymouth's school district merged with Shiloh's school district, and Plymouth High School began taking in Shiloh's students.http://www.crawfordcountybasketball.com/plymouthopponents.html ==State championships== * Boys Cross Country \u2013 1971, 1974 ==References== ==External links== * Category:High schools in Richland County, Ohio Category:Public high schools in Ohio ",
