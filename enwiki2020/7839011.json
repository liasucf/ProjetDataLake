    "text": "Valley Lutheran High School is a private, parochial school located in Saginaw Charter Township, Michigan. The foundation and mission of the school is \"At Valley Lutheran, Christ is the foundation for everything we do. We prepare our students as children of God academically, physically, socially, emotionally, and spiritually to serve in the world today and tomorrow.\" The school is owned and operated by the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod. The school was founded in 1977 and celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2017. ==Sports== Valley Lutheran is a class \"C\" school. Prior to the mid-1990s Valley Lutheran did not have a football team (also due to budget restrictions), as a result, the school was always well known for its soccer team. Because there was no football team, the annual homecoming dance was held in conjunction with a soccer match instead of the more-traditional football game. The following sports are offered at Valley Lutheran: * Boys Soccer * Football * Boys Cross Country * Boys Basketball * Boys Wrestling * Boys Bowling * Boys Baseball * Boys Track * Boys Golf * Girls Volleyball * Girls Cross Country * Cheerleading * Pom Pons * Girls Golf * Girls Basketball * Competitive Pom Pons * Girls Bowling * Hockey * Girls Softball * Girls Soccer * Girls Track ==The \"Carpet Dome\"== Prior to 1995 Valley Lutheran's basketball court was carpeted, and students dubbed the gym the carpet dome. When the school was constructed, the decision was made to cover the gym in carpet for financial reasons as well as noise reduction. Because of the school's religious background, there are daily chapel assemblies and it was thought that a carpeted gym would be quieter than wooden flooring. In 1995, the school replaced the carpeted basketball court with a more-traditional wooden flooring. The Saginaw News frequently reported that the carpeted floor gave the home team a ten-point advantage and many carpet burns. ==References== ==External links== * Valley Lutheran High School Category:Private high schools in Michigan Category:Educational institutions established in 1977 Category:Lutheran schools in the United States Category:Schools in Saginaw County, Michigan Category:1977 establishments in Michigan Category:Saginaw Intermediate School District Category:Secondary schools affiliated with the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod ",
