    "text": "Love and Death on Long Island is a 1997 UK / Canadian film directed by Richard Kwietniowski and starring Jason Priestley, John Hurt, Fiona Loewi, Sheila Hancock and Anne Reid. The storyline of obsession somewhat resembles that of Death in Venice. The title includes a pun: Death/De'Ath. ==Plot== Giles De'Ath (John Hurt) is a British writer who doesn't use or understand anything modern. One day, he forgets his keys and locks himself out of his flat. It begins to rain, so he goes to see an E. M. Forster movie but, instead, accidentally enters the wrong theatre and sees the teen flick Hotpants College II starring Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley). He becomes instantly infatuated with Ronnie's beauty and obsessed with the young actor. He goes to his movies in the cinema, buys teen magazines and cuts out pictures of him, and buys a VCR and TV in order to play rented video tapes of his movies. He lets his housekeeper come into his office less and less, so that he can do these things undisturbed. As his infatuation grows, it becomes obvious to those around him that Giles is becoming increasingly disturbed, though they don't know why. His friend and agent suggests that he take a holiday. Giles sets out to meet Ronnie on Long Island, New York. He flies to Long Island and takes a train to Ronnie's home town where he takes a motel room for several weeks. He searches the town for Ronnie - unsuccessfully at first - but finally spots Ronnie's girlfriend and follows her to the supermarket. Giles rams his shopping cart into her to force an introduction and invents a story about his god-daughter, Abigail, being in love with Ronnie. The girlfriend, Audrey (Fiona Loewi), is seemingly glad to have found a fan-base for Ronnie in England, and spends the day talking to Giles. She then tells him that she and Ronnie will invite him over at another time, and they can talk about Ronnie's career. Eventually Giles becomes a regular visitor at Ronnie and Audrey's house. Ronnie is flattered by Giles, and Giles is able to stay longer in his presence by claiming that he will write a new script for Ronnie, one that better suits his acting abilities. Audrey becomes suspicious of Giles's motives regarding Ronnie, and she tells Giles that she is taking Ronnie to see her parents for an extended visit. Giles is very upset, and in a last-ditch effort confronts Ronnie and tells him how he feels about him. He says that many artists have had younger male lovers, and that Ronnie should split up with Audrey because it is obvious to him (Giles) that it won't last. Ronnie rejects Giles but seems genuinely concerned for him. The film ends with a screening of Ronnie's next film: another Hotpants College movie where he quotes Walt Whitman at his mother's funeral as written by Giles. What happens to Giles in the end is not shown. == Cast == * John Hurt - Giles De'Ath * Jason Priestley - Ronnie Bostock * Fiona Loewi - Audrey * Sheila Hancock - Mrs. Barker * Harvey Atkin - Lou * Gawn Grainger - Henry * Elizabeth Quinn - Mrs. Reed * Maury Chaykin - Irving 'Irv' Buckmuller * Linda Busby - Mrs. Abbott * Bill Leadbitter - Eldridge * Anne Reid - Maureen (as Ann Reid) * Danny Webb - Video Assistant (as Daniel Webb) * Andrew Barrow - Harry * Dean Gariss - Rob * Robert McKewley - Video Salesman == Production == The film has a musical score by Richard Grassby-Lewis.

Critic Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars and praised Hurt for giving De'Ath \"a dignity...that transcends any snickering amusement at his infatuation.https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/love-and-death-on-long- island-1998 And the Chicago Tribune's Mark Caro also gave the film three and a half stars and called it \"a bewitching comedy about what happens when Giles opens himself up to the modern world -- and his own sexual inclinations,\" adding that it's \"charming, caustic, touching and vaguely creepy.\" Caro singled out Hurt for capturing \"the ridiculousness of Giles' mission without ever sacrificing his dignity. It's a performance in which you marvel at the details: the contrast between his haughty manner outside and his private embarrassed laughter as he watches a Bostock video in which a biker is catapulted into a manure pile; his startled reaction to a car that robotically warns, \"You are standing too close to this vehicle\"; the way he flinches when a close-up of a mortally wounded Bostock character cuts to a shot of a priest, as if Giles had forgotten that the precious image on his TV screen was not fixed there.\" Caro also lauded director Kwietniowski for showing \"a gentle touch in portraying Giles' folly and satirizing British stuffiness and American anti- intellectualism.\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-03-13/entertainment/9803130060_1_giles- de-ath-kwietniowski-ronnie-bostock The film currently has an 87% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 38 reviews.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/love_and_death_on_long_island == References == == External links == * Category:1997 films Category:British films Category:Canadian films Category:1997 drama films Category:English- language films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films set in Long Island Category:British independent films Category:British LGBT-related films Category:Canadian LGBT-related films Category:Films directed by Richard Kwietniowski Category:Lionsgate films Category:Films shot in Nova Scotia Category:1997 LGBT-related films Category:British drama films Category:Canadian independent films Category:1997 independent films ",
