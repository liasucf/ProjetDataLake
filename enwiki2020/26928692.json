    "text": "Fezolamine (Win-41,528-2) is a drug which was investigated by Sterling Drug as an antidepressant in the 1980s. The isomeric N,N-dimethyl-4,5-diphenyl-1H-pyrazole-1-propanamine was completely inactive in the primary antidepressant screens. It acts as a serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, with 3- to 4-fold preference for the former neurotransmitter. It was found to be effective and well tolerated in clinical trials but was never marketed. == See also == * 3,3-Diphenylcyclobutanamine == References == Category:Dimethylamino compounds Category:Serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors Category:Pyrazoles ",
