Tome premier quatrieme IP. 3 / p. 499 Judicial proceedings were commenced against him for having used the forbidden title of pastors for Protestant ministers. He published Dialogue sur les difficult\u00e9s que les Missionnaires font aux Protestant de France. This dialogue on the tolerance of Lutheran errors inspired the Elector Palatine to try and unite the two reformed churches in Germany, the Lutheran and the Calvinist churches. Palatine advocated their union in the assembly of Protestant princes at Frankfurt. Upon hearing this, Matthieu Bochart published his Dialectician, a conciliatory treatise, in 1662, which he dedicated to Palatine. It contains the plan of this projected union. Matthieu's cousin is the more well-known Samuel Bochart.Penny Cyclopaedia. Vol. 5.
