Tin clockwork toy train, German manufacture, c. 1900 ==Description== Penny toys, also known as tin toys, were made of tin metal with painted surfaces that typically included excellent detail. Most penny toys were manufactured in Germany and were originally sold to wholesalers by the gross for 8 shillings allowing the seller, often street peddlers to sell them for a substantial profit.Levy, Allan, A Century of Toys from the London Toy & Model Museum Michael Edgley, 1982, p. 17 Typically the toys were miniatures, that is; under 10 cm and often included elements that facilitated movement, adding to their charm.Pressland, David, Book of Penny Toys, Pei International, 1991 In the United Kingdom, the toys were sold for one Penny, hence the popular name of penny toys. The advent of penny toys broadened the market for children's toys, by making them accessible and affordable for working-class families.Cross, G., Kids' Stuff: Toys and the Changing World of American Childhood, Harvard University Press, 2009, pp 95-96 Although penny toys were manufactured into the first decades of the 20th century, the period 1885 -1914 is the peak period for their production. Today, penny toys are highly collectible.O'Neill, R., The Collector's Encyclopedia of Metal Toys: A Pictorial Guide to Over 2,500 Examples of Tinplate and Diecast Toys Dating from 1850 to the Present Day, Crescent Books, 1988 Publicly accessible examples can be found in museums in England, North America, Scandinavia and across Europe; including Birmingham Science Museum in England, Royal Ontario Museum in Canada, Plassenburg Zinnfiguren Museum in Germany and Museo des Soldados de Iberica in Valencia, Spain. ===Types=== Individual toys were manufactured for specific markets.
