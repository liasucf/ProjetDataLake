Its width at Punta Palasc\u00eca, east of Salento is less than . The strait is named after the Italian city of Otranto. == History == Since ancient times the Strait of Otranto was of vital strategic importance. The Romans used it to transport their troops eastwards. The legions marched to Brundisium (now Brindisi), had only a one-day sea voyage to modern Albania territory and then could move eastwards following the Via Egnatia. The Strait of Otranto on a map from the early 17th century === World War I === During World War I, the strait was of strategic significance. The Allied navies of Italy, France, and Great Britain, by blockading the strait, mostly with light naval forces and lightly armed fishing vessels known as \u2018drifters', hindered the cautious Austro-Hungarian Navy from freely entering the Mediterranean Sea, and effectively kept them out of the naval theatre of war. The blockade was known as the \u2018Otranto Barrage\u2019. However, the barrage was notoriously ineffective against the German U-boats operating out of the Adriatic, which were to plague the Allied powers for most of the war throughout the Mediterranean.First World War - Willmott, H.P., Dorling Kindersley, 2003, Page 186 === After the fall of the Iron Curtain === In 1992, Albania and Italy signed a treaty that delimited the continental shelf boundary between the two countries in the strait. In 1997 and 2004, nearly 100 people lost their lives trying to illegally cross the strait following the 1997 unrest in Albania and poor economic conditions in the Tragedy of Otranto and the Karaburun tragedy. In 2006, the Albanian government imposed a moratorium on motor-powered sailing boats on all lakes, rivers, and seas of Albania to curb organized crime. Council of Ministers of the Republic of Albania, www.keshilliministrave.al, 10 August 2006. The only exemption to the rule are government owned boats, foreign owned boats, fishing boats, and jet boats. In 2010, the moratorium was extended for 3 more years, until 2013. ==See also== *Otranto Barrage *Otranto Raid *Battle of the Strait of Otranto (disambiguation) *Karaburun tragedy == References == Otranto Otranto Category:Albania\u2013Italy border Category:International straits Category:Ionian Sea Category:Adriatic Sea Category:Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast Category:Albanian Ionian Sea Coast ",
