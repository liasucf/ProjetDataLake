It was established by the Sisters of Providence, a Roman Catholic order of nuns from Montreal, and part of the Providence Hospital System. It closed in 1968 due to aging facilities. The hospital survived a 1910 fire that severely damaged the city of Wallace. A statue of Jesus of the Sacred Heart, which sat in the first-story window of the hospital, has been missing for several decades as of 2011. ==References== ==External links== *Hospital photos at the Providence Archive Category:1891 establishments in Idaho Category:Defunct hospitals in the United States Category:Providence Health & Services ",
