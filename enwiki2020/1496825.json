    "text": "Another Perfect Day is the sixth studio album by the band Mot\u00f6rhead, released 4 June 1983, on Bronze Records; which would also be their last full length original album with the label. It is the band's only studio album to feature lead guitarist Brian \"Robbo\" Robertson, best known for his work with Thin Lizzy. ==Recording== After lead guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke left Mot\u00f6rhead in 1982 in the midst of the band's Iron Fist US tour, guitarist Brian \"Robbo\" Robertson (ex-Thin Lizzy, Wild Horses) was recruited to complete the tour. Drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor, who had been a huge Thin Lizzy fan, had lobbied vocalist/bassist/band leader Lemmy to hire Robertson. The change was initially welcomed by both Lemmy and Taylor; in Joel McIver's book Overkill: The Untold Story of Mot\u00f6rhead, Lemmy is quoted at the time saying that the band's sound had: These feelings would change dramatically once they entered the studio with producer Tony Platt; Lemmy would recall years later in the Mot\u00f6rhead documentary The Guts and the Glory: The original vinyl release featured a lyric-sheet insert, with a cartoon storyboard of the adventures of the new band, as it were. The cassette and US LP versions had a vastly different track list, with \"I Got Mine\" opening the album and \"Back at the Funny Farm\" opening side two. The band supported the album with the Another Perfect Tour tour, and almost immediately audiences and industry personnel alike took notice of the jarring contrast between Lemmy and Taylor, clad in their usual leathers, and Robertson, who took to wearing satin shorts and slip-on espadrille shoes onstage, which were becoming quite fashionable in the mid-1980s. In his 2002 autobiography White Line Fever, Lemmy writes: Lemmy began to make light of Robertson's attire during shows, but he explained to Classic Rock interviewer David Ling: In his memoir, Lemmy put the album into perspective: Following the album and tour, Robertson and Taylor left Mot\u00f6rhead to form the band Operator, leaving only Lemmy to continue on with Mot\u00f6rhead. Since then, \"Shine\", \"Die You Bastard!\", \"Dancing on Your Grave\", \"I Got Mine\", \"Another Perfect Day\", \"One Track Mind\", and \"Rock It\" have been featured in the band's live set. In 2013, Lemmy told Lee Marlow of Classic Rock that he hadn't spoken to Robertson since 1983 and maintained: ==Sleeve artwork== Joe Petagno, the sleeve artist, commented that the cover was inspired by the upheaval prevalent in the band and its members at the time: In 1988 Castle Communications re-issued this album along with Overkill in a gatefold sleeve. ==Critical reception== John Franck of AllMusic calls Another Perfect Day \"one of the most unique (albeit misunderstood) albums in the entire Mot\u00f6rhead catalog\", adding that it is one of \"the band's best-sounding records ever, but tinkering with a legendary formula is always fraught with danger (is that a boogie-woogie piano on 'Rock It'?), and as one might expect, the results here are alternately exhilarating and sometimes frustrating\". Mot\u00f6rhead biographer Joel McIver wrote in 2011 that it was \"worth revisiting for those who may have forgotten its genuine charms\". The thrash metal band Sepultura named themselves after the third track from this album, \"Dancing on Your Grave\" (\"sepultura\" is \"grave\" in Portuguese).Max Cavalera tells how this came to be after translating the lyrics to the \"Dancing on Your Grave\" on the video Third World Chaos. The songs \"Back at the Funny Farm\" and \"Marching Off to War\" were featured on the video game Br\u00fctal Legend.As listed on the original album, the listing for the Deluxe Edition [ allmusic article] and the 1991 CD sleeve. ==Track listing== ===Sanctuary Records 2006 2CD deluxe edition=== *Disc one is the original album minus the bonus tracks, except the B-Side of I Got Mine single. *Disc two is a live recording at the Manchester Apollo, 10 June 1983. ==Personnel== Per the Another Perfect Day liner notes. * Lemmy \u2013 bass, vocals * Brian \"Robbo\" Robertson \u2013 guitars, piano on \"Rock It\", Fender piano on \"Shine\" and backing vocals on \"Back at the Funny Farm\" * Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor \u2013 drums ===Production=== *Tony Platt \u2013 producer, mixing *Andy Pearce \u2013 mastering (2006 remaster) *Joe Petagno \u2013 Snaggletooth *Curt Evans \u2013 2006 cover design ===2006 deluxe edition remaster=== * Steve Hammonds \u2013 release coordination * Jon Richards \u2013 release coordination *Malcolm Dome \u2013 sleeve notes *Mick Stevenson \u2013 project consultant, photos and archive memorabilia ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
