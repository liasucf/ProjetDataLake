Releasing her first album in 2006, and Rolling Stone said of her, \"Smith could easily be lumped in with expressive chanteuses like Norah Jones and Alicia Keys, but she has a broader palette than either.\" The magazine listed her as one of the 10 Artists to Watch in 2006. Smith performing at the Apollo Theater Her debut album, For Lovers, Dreamers & Me, was a collection of songs spanning genres from country to rock to funk. The title was borrowed from the Muppets. \"We were just trying to think of a title because I haven\u2019t thought of a name after it was all done,\" she said in an interview with Hiphoprnbsoul.com. \"We were thinking about the music and we were throwing ideas around. We were thinking about The Beatles and The Wizard of Oz and whatever else made us think of. Then something made me think of The Muppets. I don\u2019t even know. It wasn't something in the forefront of my mind. I just thought of it and it came to me like that.\" The song \"Dream\" was featured on an episode of Entourage (season four) during the closing credits. \"Dream\" was also featured in the final act of episode four, season five, of the Showtime series The L Word (\"Let's Get This Party Started\").
