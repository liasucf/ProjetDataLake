Hurtado regarding his view of the Pauline theology. He sees Paul's theology as seen through the 'lens' of his understanding of who Jesus is, his Christology. In his work of 2015 Herkunft und Horizont der Theologie des Neuen Testaments he drew attention to the need to recall the 'transcendence of God' in our remembering true theology is the purpose and not just a methodology. ==Personal life== Klumbies is married and has two children. ==Works== ===Books=== * * * * * * ===As editor=== * * * * ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:New Testament scholars Category:German biblical scholars Category:German Lutheran theologians Category:University of Freiburg faculty Category:University of Kassel faculty Category:Lutheran biblical scholars ",
