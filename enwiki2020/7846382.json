    "text": "The Distinguished Intelligence Cross is the highest decoration awarded by the United States Central Intelligence Agency. It is the agency's equivalent of the military's Medal of Honor or Service Cross, i.e., Navy Cross, Army Distinguished Service Cross, Air Force Cross. It has been said https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/2013-press- releases-statements/cia-bestows-distinguished-intelligence-cross-upon-two- agency-legends.html that the DIC is the equivalent to the Medal of Honor, but the MOH is awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the US Congress and the DIC is awarded by the CIA.https://fas.org/irp/cia/product/fact97/medals.htm The cross is awarded for \"a voluntary act or acts of extraordinary heroism involving the acceptance of existing dangers with conspicuous fortitude and exemplary courage\". Only a handful of people have been awarded this medal in the history of the agency, most posthumously. As such, it is one of the rarest awards for valor in the United States.The very best men: four who dared, the early years of the CIA, by Evan Thomas, published by Simon and Schuster, 1996. The Central Intelligence Agency has two awards for valor; the other is the Intelligence Star, which is analogous to the military's Silver Star.Bush at War, Bob Woodward, Simon and Schuester, 2002, page 317.Gup, Ted (2000).
