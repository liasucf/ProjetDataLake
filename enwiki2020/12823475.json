He defeated two other candidates including former Calgary mayor and one-time Liberal MLA Robert Colin Marshall. Kennedy ran as a New Democracy candidate and was defeated in the 1940 Canadian federal election by Liberal candidate Frederick Casselman. After his defeat in the 1940 election he became a perennial candidate running in almost every federal election under the Social Credit banner in various federal electoral districts in Alberta until 1963. He also served as chief campaign organizer for Social Credit parties on the provincial level in various elections.
