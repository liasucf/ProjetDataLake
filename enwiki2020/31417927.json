    "text": "Antoni Mart\u00ed Petit (, born 30 July 1963) is an Andorran architect and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Andorra from May 2011 to 16 May 2019, when he was elected on the ticket of the Democrats for Andorra. He was re-elected in the 2015 parliamentary election. ==Early life and education== Mart\u00ed was born in Escaldes-Engordany and studied at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'architecture de Toulouse (Toulouse National School of Architecture), part of the Universit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Toulouse Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. He is an architect by profession. ==Political career== Mart\u00ed was first elected to the General Council in 1993, the first parliamentary election to involve political parties, as a member of the Liberal Union. In the election, the Liberal Union came a close second. \u00d2scar Ribas Reig, who had been appointed Prime Minister, lost a vote of no confidence in 1994, leading to Marc Forn\u00e9 Moln\u00e9, the leader of the Liberal Union, being appointed as Prime Minister. Mart\u00ed was re-elected in the 1997 election, in which the Liberal Union won and Moln\u00e9 remained as Prime Minister. Shortly before the 2001 election, the Liberal Union was renamed as the Liberal Party of Andorra, and went on to win the election, with Moln\u00e9 retaining his role as Prime Minister. In 2004, Mart\u00ed resigned from the General Council and was elected as Mayor of Escaldes- Engordany, the second largest town in Andorra. He served two consecutive terms as Mayor, from 2004 to 2007, and from 2008 to 2011. The Liberal Party had contested the 2009 election as part of the Reformist Coalition, losing to the Social Democratic Party led by Jaume Bartumeu. Bartumeu opted to call an early election in 2011 after losing the budget vote two years running to the opposition parties. In February 2011, the Democrats for Andorra was formed as a direct successor to the Reformist Coalition, with Mart\u00ed as their candidate for Prime Minister. He campaigned against Bartumeu's proposed introduction of an income tax. The Democrats for Andorra won 55.5% of the vote, and Bartumeu resigned as Prime Minister on 28 April 2011, to be replaced by Pere L\u00f3pez Agr\u00e0s in an interim capacity until 12 May 2011, when Mart\u00ed was appointed. In 2011, Mart\u00ed opened negotiations with the European Union over various aspects of cooperation. During the negotiations, Andorra changed the foreign investment law, opening the country up to foreign investors, and also signed an agreement with France and Spain to avoid double taxation. Mart\u00ed has also overseen the introduction of the euro as the official currency of Andorra, following an agreement which was completed in June 2011. Andorra was permitted to issue their own euros from July 2013, but due to various delays, Andorran euros did not enter circulation until January 2015. In late May 2013, Mart\u00ed met with Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, the President of France and a Co-Prince of Andorra, to inform him of his intentions to bring in a law to introduce personal income tax in Andorra. Hollande encouraged Mart\u00ed to continue with economic reforms that may lead to growth. In June 2013, Mart\u00ed bowed to pressure from the European Union and did introduce a personal income tax for Andorrans. As Prime Minister, Mart\u00ed oversaw the response to the 2015 Andorran banking crisis, involving American allegations of money laundering made against the Banca Privada d'Andorra (BPA). The government responded to this by the restructuring of the bank, and the creation and sale of Vall Banc in place of BPA. In June 2016, Mart\u00ed praised Michel Camdessus's 2005 report about Andorra, that \"turned out to be prophetic.\" In turn, Camdessus expressed his respect for \"the government of Andorra for the fact that the Principality embarked on the path of reforms, turning from protectionism and stagnation in the direction of openness and competitiveness.\" == References == == External links == * govern.ad Andorra Government website |- Category:1963 births Category:Democrats for Andorra politicians Category:Heads of Government of Andorra Category:Living people Category:Members of the General Council (Andorra) Category:Andorran architects Category:People from Escaldes-Engordany ",
