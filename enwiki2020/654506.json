    "text": "Mithridates III () was the fourth King of Pontus, son of Mithridates II of Pontus and Laodice. Mithridates had two sisters: Laodice III, the first wife of the Seleucid King Antiochus III the Great, and Laodice of Pontus. He may have ruled in an uncertain period between 220 BC and 183 BC. Nothing is known of him since the years just cited, because the kingdom of Pontus disappears from history. His same existence is contested by certain historians, even if it is necessary to account for Appian's indication of Mithridates VI of Pontus as the eighth king of the dynasty and the sixth of the name. Mithridates married an obscure Seleucid princess called Laodice.Getzel, Hellenistic settlements in Europe, the islands and Asia Minor p. 387Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer p.50 By this wife, he had three children: Mithridates IV of Pontus,Callatay, The First Royal Coinage of Pontos (from Mithridates III to Mithridates V) p.21 Pharnaces I of Pontus Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus xxxviii and Laodice. ==References== *Hazel, John.
