The shorter headstream of \u017dupanjeva\u010dka reka (Cyrillic: \u0416\u0443\u043f\u0430\u045a\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0430) originates from the mountain of Gledi\u0107ke planine in southern \u0160umadija region of central Serbia. Its spring is just some 500 m away from the source of Lugomir's another headstream, the Dulenska reka. The river first flows to the east, next to the villages of Nadrlje, \u017dupanjevac, Dragovo and Belu\u0161i\u0107. At this point, the \u017dupanjeva\u010dka reka reaches the Juhor mountain, turns north along the Juhor's western slopes, and after the village of Beo\u010di\u0107 meets the Dulenska reka. The longer headstream of Dulenska reka (37,5 km; Cyrillic: \u0414\u0443\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u043a\u0430) also originates from the mountain of Gledi\u0107ke planine at an altitude of 793 m (Gomila peak), but flows northward. At the village of Dulene the river is dammed by the temporary (but still functioning) 7-meter high filled dam in 1964. The artificial lake Dulene (Dulensko jezero; Cyrillic: \u0414\u0443\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0458\u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u043e) is created, with an altitude of 435 m, a tunnel was dug through the Gledi\u0107ke planine and pipeline with pumps set to take water out into another artificial lake of Gro\u0161nica which is used for the supplying of the city of Kragujevac with water. The river turns east, receives the P\u010deli\u010dka reka from the left at the village of Velike P\u010delice and flows through the small town and municipal seat of Rekovac where it turns south. At the villages of Te\u010di\u0107, Vukmanovac and Lo\u0107ika, the Dulenska reka forms a small arc and turns northward in the narrow valley on the western slopes of the Juhor mountain, where it meets the \u017dupanjeva\u010dka reka at the village of Drago\u0161evac. == Lugomir == The Lugomir proper is 19,5 km long. The river continues the northeast direction of the Dulenska reka, along the western side of the Juhor, and enters the region of Veliko Pomoravlje. It flows through the villages of Kolare, Bresje and Majur and the southern outskirts of the town of Jagodina. After it is crossed by the Belgrade-Ni\u0161 highway, the Lugomir empties into the Velika Morava near the village of Ribari. The Lugomir drains an area of 446 km\u00b2, belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin and is not navigable. ==References== Category:Rivers of Serbia Category:\u0160umadija ",
