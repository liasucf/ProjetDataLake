    "text": "Hurricane Barry was an asymmetrical Category 1 hurricane that was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in Arkansas and the fourth-wettest in Louisiana. The second tropical or subtropical storm and first hurricane of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season, Barry originated as a mesoscale convective vortex over southwestern Kansas on July 2\\. The system eventually emerged into the Gulf of Mexico from the Florida Panhandle on July 10, whereupon the National Hurricane Center (NHC) designated it as a potential tropical cyclone. Early on July 11, the system developed into a tropical depression and later into the second tropical storm on the same day. On July 13, Barry attained its peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), with a minimum central pressure of . Subsequently, Barry made its first landfall at Marsh Island, and another landfall in Intracoastal City, Louisiana, both times as a Category 1 hurricane. Barry quickly weakened after landfall, falling to tropical depression status on July 15. The storm finally degenerated into a remnant low over northern Arkansas on the same day, before merging with a trough on July 16. Barry was one of four hurricanes to hit Louisiana as a Category 1 hurricane in the month of July, the others being Bob in 1979, Danny in 1997, and Cindy in 2005. Numerous tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for Mississippi and Louisiana ahead of the storm. Several states declared state of emergencies ahead of the storm. Though Barry only produced hurricane-force winds in a small area of Louisiana, more than 153,000 customers lost power in the state. The storm\u2019s large circulation produced heavy rainfall over a large area, reaching near Ragley, Louisiana, and near Dierks, Arkansas. The latter value was the highest amount of rainfall recorded in Arkansas related to a tropical cyclone. Many roads, including Interstate highways, were flooded. Dozens of water rescues were carried out in Louisiana and Arkansas, where flooding was the severest. One indirect fatality was attributed to Barry, and the damage was estimated to be about $600 million (2019 USD). ==Meteorological history== The origins of Barry can be traced to a mesoscale convective vortex that formed over southwestern Kansas on July 2. On July 5, the Climate Prediction Center noted the possibility for this disturbance to interact with a trough of low pressure over the Southeastern United States, eventually triggering a low pressure area over the Gulf of Mexico. The following day, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) highlighted a low likelihood of tropical cyclogenesis while the disturbance was still centered well-inland over Tennessee, anticipating that the weather system would track into the northern Gulf of Mexico. Over the next few days, the system drifted southeastward towards Georgia, steered by a ridge to its west. By July 8, the NHC assessed a high probability of a tropical cyclone developing due to favorable conditions in the Gulf. On July 9, a broad low pressure area exited the Florida Panhandle and tracked into the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, accompanied by scattered convection, or thunderstorms. It moved southwestward and curved to the west on the east side of a mid-level ridge. On July 10, the NHC initiated advisories on the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone Two, due to its threat it posed to the United States within a few days. At that time, the low pressure area was experiencing some northerly wind shear, which was expected to decrease. Sea surface temperatures of allowed the system to gradually organize. Barry intensifying over the Gulf of Mexico on July 12. At 00:00 UTC on July 11, the system developed into a tropical depression about 200 mi (320 km) south of Mobile, Alabama. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Barry six hours later as the convection had increased to the south of the system's circulation. The storm's convection organized into a large rainband south of an elongated circulation, though mid-level dry air and northerly wind shear restricted thunderstorms near the center. On July 12, data from two hurricane hunter reconnaisance aircraft found that Barry quickly intensified, with its central pressure dropping, despite a marginally favorable environment. Due to a slight decrease in shear on the morning of July 13, the storm's outflow expanded and the banding increased. Barry attained Category 1 hurricane status by 12:00 UTC that day, with a small area of hurricane-force winds occurring east of the center. Simultaneously, the storm reached its peak intensity, with a minimum central pressure of . At 15:00 UTC that day, Barry made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on Marsh Island, Louisiana. Barry was one of four hurricanes to hit Louisiana at Category 1 intensity in the month of July, the others being Bob in 1979, Danny in 1997, and Cindy in 2005. The storm quickly weakened after landfall, falling to tropical storm status late on July 13. Barry further weakened to a tropical depression at 00:00 UTC on July 15 just south of the Louisiana-Arkansas border. At 12:00 UTC that same day, Barry degenerated into a remnant low over northern Arkansas. The remnant low continue to spin down, and degenerated into a trough at 12:00 UTC a day later over southern Missouri. Barry brought a hot, tropical airmass along its path, continuing a heat wave along the East Coast of the United States.NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, State of the Climate: Hurricanes and Tropical Storms for July 2019, published online August 2019, retrieved on October 19, 2020 from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/tropical-cyclones/201907. ==Preparations== The Louisiana National Guard preparing for the coming of Hurricane Barry On July 10, the NHC began issuing various warnings and watches, including a hurricane watch for the Louisiana coast from Cameron to the Mississippi River Delta, a tropical storm watch from the Mississippi Delta to the mouth of the Pearl River, and a storm surge watch from the mouth of the Pearl River to Morgan City, Louisiana. After the disturbance became a tropical storm on July 11, the NHC issued a tropical storm warning from the mouth of the Pearl River to Morgan City, and a tropical storm watch eastward to the Mississippi/Alabama border, including the New Orleans metro area, Lake Pontchartrain, and Lake Maurepas. The agency also issued a storm surge warning from the mouth of the Atchafalaya River to Shell Beach, Louisiana. The Louisiana National Guard placing sandbags along a levee in Port Sulphur, Louisiana. The United States Army Corps of Engineers feared that levees would be overtopped in Plaquemines Parish by storm surge and historically high river levels. Thus, a mandatory evacuation was ordered for the parish effective on the morning of July 11, affecting approximately 8,000\u201310,000 residents. An evacuation order was also issued for low-lying areas of Jefferson Parish; the mayor of Grand Isle also issued a mandatory evacuation. Due to the storm threat, the Carnival Valor changed its disembarking point from New Orleans to Mobile, Alabama. Royal Dutch Shell evacuated non-essential personnel from its offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. On the afternoon of July 11, the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane warning for coastal Louisiana between Intracoastal City to Grand Isle, Louisiana. Curfews were enacted in several Louisiana communities across five parishes on July 12. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell urged residents to \"shelter in place\" but did not order evacuations, citing Category 3 status as the threshold. In a 24-hour span between July 10 and 11, 28 parishes issued emergency declarations. After declaring a state of emergency and deploying search and rescue assets, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards requested a federal disaster declaration for the entire state on July 11, citing the potential for widespread flooding; the request was granted by President Donald Trump later that day. On July 12, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public health emergency in Louisiana to prepare for Barry's potential impacts. In addition to making this declaration, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) worked with FEMA and positioned approximately 100 medical and public health personnel from various agencies, and provided medical equipment for medical teams. On July 12, Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency, allocating state resources for storm relief and activating the state's emergency operations center. The Mississippi Urban Search and Rescue Task Force dispatched two 12-person water rescue crews to Pike County and Camp Shelby to assist local emergency units. ==Impact== Total rainfall from Hurricane Barry and its remnants High water levels occurred from the Florida Panandle to the upper Texas Coast. Total economic losses from Barry are estimated at $600 million (2019 USD), with public and private insurers paying out nearly $300 million. More than 50,000 buildings were damaged or destroyed. Most of these losses were due to flooding along the Gulf Coast and in Arkansas. ===Louisiana=== While Barry was in its formative stages, it dropped of rainfall across the New Orleans area, causing flooding. An expansive thunderstorm inundated streets and businesses over a six-hour period on the morning of July 10. Portions of the French Quarter were flooded and public transportation was disrupted. The impacts were exacerbated by an elevated Mississippi River amid a prolonged period exceeding flood stage. Officials declared a flash flood emergency in New Orleans, as flooded streets forced businesses and government buildings to close. Hurricane Barry intensifying, then making landfall in Louisiana When Barry made landfall, it produced hurricane-force winds in a small area near the Louisiana coast. The strongest recorded winds on land was at Acadiana Regional Airport in New Iberia. For several days, Barry's intense rainbands affected the same portion of south- central and southwestern Louisiana. The highest rainfall total recorded along Barry's path was near Ragley. Waterspouts were reported on Lake Pontchartrain. A possible tornado damaged two homes when it struck the Gentilly neighborhood in New Orleans. The highest storm surge in Louisiana was above normal tide levels at Eugene Island in Atchafalaya Bay. A tide station in Amerada Pass recorded a high tide, but the station had been recording higher than normal tides due to high runoff from the Mississippi River. On the southern shore of Lake Pontchartrain, the storm surge reached . Flooding also occurred on the banks of the Atchafalaya River in Morgan City. The Lower Dularge East Levee in Terrebonne Parish was overtopped, prompting a mandatory evacuation for nearby areas. On the afternoon of July 12, Louisiana Highway 1 south of Golden Meadow was closed after seawater began to inundate portions of the road, cutting off access to Grand Isle and Port Fourchon. Coast Guard helicopter rescue near Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana A total of 153,000 customers lost power in Louisiana. Power lines knocked down by fallen trees in the Metairie area cut power to 5,140 electricity customers in the New Orleans metropolitan area. The most widespread power outages occurred where wind speeds were highest in Lafourche Parish and Terrebonne Parish, as well as eastern Baton Rouge; over 39,000 lost power in these areas. All electricity customers in Grand Isle lost power, and a total of 4,300 customers were affected by power outages as Barry's initial rainbands swept across coastal Louisiana. The storm also caused The Rolling Stones to postpone their July 14 show at the Superdome to July 15 due to heavy rain. ===Mississippi=== Five people were rescued southwest of Gulfport, Mississippi, after their ship ran aground. On July 14, a brief EF0 tornado in Forrest County damaged a few tree limbs on its path. In addition, a tornado warning was issued for Jackson County, though no tornadoes were reported in the county.{{cite news|title=Heavy rain occurred in southwestern Mississippi, and a rainfall amount of near Pass Christian. The rains flooded roads near the coast, in conjunction with higher tides. Hurricane Barry produced a storm surge in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. Floodwaters inundated parts of Beach Boulevard in Pascagoula, and closed roads in the Biloxi area. High winds and saturated soils led to fallen trees. ===Alabama and Florida=== The outer rainbands of Barry dropped heavy rainfall in southern Alabama, reaching near Fairhope.Torrential rainfall overwhelmed sewer systems in Alabama, with over 80,000 gallons (300,000 L) of water spilling into the streets of Mobile County. The storm caused in the closure of popular beaches, including those in Orange Beach and Gulf Shores. In southern Alabama, wind gusts reached 72 mph (116 km/h) on Pinto Island. Around of storm surge was reported in coastal Alabama. Floodwaters from coastal flooding reached several feet deep in some locations, causing beach erosion and leaving behind of sand on Bienville Boulevard on Dauphin Island. Floodwaters closed lanes of the Cochrane\u2013Africatown USA Bridge in Mobile. Along the Florida Panhandle, beaches issued warnings to the public to stay out of the water in order to avoid rip currents and dangerous swimming conditions; however, there were still many calls of swimmers in distress. In Panama City Beach, multiple people formed a human chain in an effort to save swimmers who had gotten caught in a rip current caused by the storm. Authorities performed 38 water rescues. A 67-year-old man drowned in the waters. Barry's large circulation produced gale-force wind gusts along the Gulf Coast as far east Panama City Beach, which recorded gusts of 41 mph (67 km/h). ===Arkansas=== 72-hour rainfall from Hurricane Barry in Arkansas. Following up to of rainfall, the National Weather Service issued a rare flash flood emergency at 5 a.m. CDT on July 16, for southern Pike and southern Clark counties. Later, water rescues and washed-out roads were reported in Hempstead, Howard, and Nevada counties, prompting a flash flood emergency to be issued for those counties as well. A portion of Interstate 30 was closed in Clark County due to flooding. The Clark County Humane Society in Arkadelphia was drenched by floodwaters, killing a puppy. Later, the remaining animals were rescued. A woman was rescued from fast-moving floodwaters in the same area. In Nashville, the police department building and the county jail were damaged by flash flooding, and inmates had to be evacuated. A rainfall total of was recorded near Dierks, making Barry the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. ===Elsewhere=== In Texas, wind gusts reached 56 mph (91 km/h) at Sabine Pass. In addition, a peak rainfall amount of was recorded in Beaumont. In Missouri, a peak rainfall amount of was recorded in Poplar Bluff, and in Tennessee, a peak amount of was recorded near Cookeville. More than of rain fell in Toronto, Canada on July 17, as the post- tropical cyclone moved just south of the area, resulting in street-level flash flooding and the blockage of a ramp to Ontario Highway 401, where several cars were submerged. The city recorded its highest daily rainfall total in the month of July since 2013. The storm also produced a funnel cloud in Oro- Medonte. In the Northeastern United States, Barry worsened a heat wave due to the tropical airmass it brought along with it. In addition, Barry's remnant moisture brought severe thunderstorms to the region from July 16-17, causing downed trees and power outages. Trees were reported down and power outages occurred in Ewing, New Jersey. A portion of the Garden State Parkway was closed briefly due to flooding. Rome, New York received more than of rain. On July 17, two people were injured in Lancaster, Pennsylvania due to strong winds. Overall, 160,000 customers lost power due to the storms in the Mid- Atlantic and New England. ==Aftermath== Parishes in Louisiana (beige) that received federal assistence from FEMA Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards traveled to coastal Louisiana on July 15 to inspect damage from the storm. He visited Myrtle Grove, near Port Sulphur, where roads were damaged by floods. The governor later said in a news conference that the storm was not as bad as originally anticipated, but urged residents to prepare for later storms. Mayor of Houston Sylvester Turner called New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell and offered to provide donations to affected areas through the Houston Relief Hub. However, Cantrell said that her city of New Orleans was \"beyond lucky\" and was ready to help other parishes that got hit harder. Many oil platforms and drilling companies were also affected by the storm. The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement asserted that Barry caused nearly 73% of crude oil production in the Gulf to shut on July 15, two days after the storm made landfall. About 62% of natural gas production was also ceased. More than a month after the storm, some communities in Louisiana were still recovering from the storm. On August 27, President Donald Trump issued a major disaster declaration and ordered federal assistance to increase recovery efforts in Louisiana. The same day, Governor John Bel Edwards announced that the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness and FEMA had recently completed damage assessments in the impacted areas. ==See also== * Other storms named Barry * 1940 Louisiana hurricane \u2013 produced flooding rainfall over southern Louisiana due to its slow movement * 1943 Surprise Hurricane \u2013 the first hurricane to be observed by Hurricane Hunters, taking a similar westward path * Hurricane Bonnie (1986) \u2013 a Category 1 hurricane that also took a similar track to Barry's * Hurricane Danny (1997) \u2013 storm with similar origins that struck the Gulf Coast * Hurricane Isaac (2012) \u2013 a Category 1 hurricane that made landfall in a similar location along the Gulf Coast * Tropical Storm Cindy (2017) \u2013 a tropical storm that took a similar track to Barry's ==References== ==External links== * The National Hurricane Center's advisory archive on Hurricane Barry * The Weather Prediction Center's advisory archive on Hurricane Barry * The Weather Prediction Center's storm summaries on Barry B Category:Category 1 Atlantic hurricanes Category:Hurricanes in Louisiana Category:Hurricanes in Mississippi Category:Hurricanes in Arkansas Category:July 2019 events in North America Barry ",
