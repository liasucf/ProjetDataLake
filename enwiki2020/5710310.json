    "text": "\"To You I Belong\" is a song by Irish girl group B*Witched. It was released as the third single from their eponymous debut album (1998). It reached number one on the UK Singles Chart in December 1998. It was their third UK chart- topping single. ==Music video== The music video was directed by Katie Bell, who would later also direct the video for \"I Shall Be There\". Like the song itself, the video has a Christmas feel to it: it features a cold, icy forest and a large lake. ==Live performances== During performances, lead singer Edele Lynch wore finger cymbals which she would clap in time with the cymbals claps in the music. This became another one of B*Witched's signature performance moves, along with the Irish jig for \"C'est la Vie\", the human rollercoaster for \"Rollercoaster\" and the facial hand gesture for \"Blame It on the Weatherman\". ==Releases== * UK CD 1 [666771 2] #To You I Belong 3:05 #Fly Away 3:01 #B*Witched's Message to Santa 0:53 * UK CD 2 [666771 5] #To You I Belong 3:05 #To You I Belong (Amen UK 12\" Mix) 9:02 #To You I Belong (The Wide Slam Mix) 5:23 * AU CD [xxxxxx x] #To You I Belong 3:05 #To You I Belong (Amen UK 12\" Mix) 9:02 #To You I Belong (The Wide Slam Mix) 5:23 #Fly Away 3:01 #Rollercoaster (Amen Mix) 8:09 * Vinyl [XPR 3286] #To You I Belong (Amen UK 12\" Mix) 9:02 #To You I Belong (Amen UK Dub Mix) 7:37 ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1998\u20131999) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |7 |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1998) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |33 |} ===Certifications=== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1998 singles Category:B*Witched songs Category:Number-one singles in Scotland Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Pop ballads Category:Songs written by Ray Hedges Category:Song recordings produced by Ray Hedges Category:Songs written by Tracy Ackerman Category:Epic Records singles Category:1990s ballads Category:1998 songs ",
