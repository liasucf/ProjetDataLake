    "text": "Unieqav is the ninth solo studio album by German electronic artist Alva Noto. The record was released on 16 March 2018 via Noton label. ==Background== The album Unieqav is the third and final installment in his Uni trilogy after 2008\u2019s Unitxt and 2011\u2019s Univrs. This is also seen in the coverart for each, which, when combined, form a triptych spelling Uni. The music is more rhythmic and dancefloor-oriented. Noto explains that the compositions sonically represent an underwater dive. ==Reception== Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of Financial Times wrote \"Nicolai\u2019s music is inspired by science and data, a sound world of patterns and randomness, such as Unitxt\u2019s conversion of Word and Excel files into sonic form. Patterns win out over randomness on Unieqav. Its 12 tracks are locked into intense geometric patterns, embroidered by the wonderfully detailed digital tones and textures that Nicolai conjures from his software. Sparse techno beats are imprinted in grid-like repetitions. The effect is austere but the degree of action taking place alongside ensures it does not become too severe. Track names advertise the play of difference and similarity\". Andrew Ryce of Resident Advisor stated \"Nicolai does a lot with very little. He can reduce his sound down to bundles of frequencies and pulses of noise in ways that can encompass techno, ambient and drone. He can endow the barest sounds with personality, turning them into music that sounds like little else. That's why Unieqav's simple formula is so thrilling: this is dance music with masterful sound design, like techno with an operating system upgrade. The album channels Alva Noto's trademark sounds into jittery, funky music that loses none of the complexity of his more challenging work. That must have been some night in Tokyo\u2014we're still reaping the rewards over a decade later\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Alva Noto \u2013 primary artist *Bo Kondren \u2013 mastering ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 albums Category:Alva Noto albums Category:Raster-Noton albums ",
