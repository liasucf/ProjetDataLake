    "text": "The Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute (IJS) () is the largest research institute in Slovenia. The main research areas are physics, chemistry, molecular biology, biotechnology, information technologies, reactor physics, energy and environment. At the beginning of the 2013 the institute had 962 employees, 404 of them were Ph.D scientists. The mission of the Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute is the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge at the frontiers of natural science and technology to the benefit of society at large through the pursuit of education, learning, research, and development of high technology at the highest international levels of excellence. ==History== The institute was founded by the State Security Administration (Yugoslavia) in 1949 for atomic weapons research. Initially, the Vin\u010da Nuclear Institute in Belgrade was established in 1948, followed by Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 Institute in Zagreb in 1950 and the Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute as an Institute for Physics in the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts. It is named after the distinguished 19th-century physicist Josef Stefan (), best known for his work on the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann law of black-body radiation. IJS is today involved in a wide variety of fields of scientific and economic interest. After close to 60 years of scientific achievement, the institute has become part of the image of Slovenia. Over the last 60 years it has created a number of important institutions, such as the University of Nova Gorica, the Jo\u017eef Stefan International Postgraduate School and the Ljubljana Technology park. ==Departments== *Physics **F1 Theoretical Physics **F2 Low and Medium Energy Physics **F3 Thin Films and Surfaces **F4 Surface Engineering and Optoelectronics **F5 Condensed Matter Physics **F7 Complex Matter **F8 Reactor Physics ** *Chemistry and Biochemistry **B1 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology **B2 Molecular and Biomedical Sciences **B3 Biotechnology **K1 Inorganic Chemistry and Technology **K3 Physical and Organic Chemistry **K5 Electronic Ceramics **K6 Engineering Ceramics **K7 Nanostructured Materials **K8 Synthesis of Materials K8 **K9 Advanced Materials **O2 Environmental Sciences *Electronics and Information Technologies **E1 Automation, Biocybernetics and Robotics **E2 Systems and Control **E3 Artificial Intelligence **E5 Open Computer Systems and Networks **E6 Communication Systems **E7 Computer Systems **E8 Knowledge Technologies **E9 Intelligent Systems *Reactor Engineering and Energetics **R4 Reactor Engineering *Centers **Centre for Knowledge Transfer in Information Technologies ** ** **Networking Infrastructure Centre ** **Reactor Infrastructure Centre **Scientific Information Centre Library **Center for Technology Transfer and Innovation ==Campuses== The institute has facilities in two locations.
