    "text": "This crowd-funded mantapa houses Bangalore's oldest inscription stone from 750 CE , the Hebbal-Kittayya veeragalu The Hebbal-Kittayya 750CE Inscription is one of the oldest known Kannada language inscriptions in Kannada script and Bangalore's oldest inscription. The inscription was discovered on 1 May 2018 in Hebbal. The inscription is on a Ooralivu Veeragallu in honour of Hebbal native Kittayya. Ooralivu veeragallu\u2019s are memorial stones erected in honour of a person martyred defending an attack on his or her town. Discovered by a few residents in Hebbal, this inscription was deciphered by P.V. Krishnamurthy, professor of epigraphy at the Kannada Sahithya Parishad as an inscription from the era of Ganga King Sripurusha in the 8th century CE. The Ooralivu Veeragallu inscription is now installed in a crowd-funded Ganga style stone mantapa adjoining the Hebbal city library, Bangalore. ==Discovery and dating == Until May 2018, lying in a roadside ditch close to Hebbal village gate were four ancient puja stones. These were in danger of being buried in any road development project. Dilip Kshatriya, a resident of Hebbal contacted Revival Heritage Hub (RHH), a Bengaluru based organization working in the area of heritage conservation and with their support, the four \"puja\" stones were shifted to an adjacent BBMP office. Of these four stones, one of which a Veeragallu when dug revealed a hitherto unknown and undocumented inscription on the portion that was buried under the earth. This veeragallu inscription was subsequently deciphered by Dr. P.V. Krishnamurthy an eminent Kannada epigraphist and dated to 750 CE. When discovered parts of the veeragallu had flaked and the inscription somewhat weathered. A 3D digital scan assisted in reading the inscription completely. On Palaeographic considerations, the date of the inscription is assigned to 750CE. In the absence of an explicit date mentioned in an inscription, it is a traditional practice to assign a date to the closest 10, 50, or 100th year on palaeographical considerations. ==Transliteration of the text in modern English== Flour trace of the 750CE Hebbal-Kittayya inscription The text of the inscription in Purvada halegannada language and written in Ganga period Kannada script was deciphered by eminent epigraphist Dr. P.V. Krishnamurthy. The exact transliteration of the inscription in IAST is as follows (line numbers are not part of the original inscription, including them is a default practice with inscriptions). # svasti \u015br\u012b siripuru\u1e63a mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101 prathuv\u012b r\u0101jya\u1e43geyye # perbbo\u1e37aln\u0101\u1e0du m\u016bvattum\u0101npe\u1e3bn\u0101gattarasar\u0101\u1e37e \u0101ra # kammo\u1e5fara mai\u1e43duna\u1e43 ko\u1e0dandaleyara kittayan\u0101 ra\u1e6d\u1e6dav\u0101 # \u1e0di k\u016bci tando\u1e0de \u016bra\u1e3bivin\u016b\u1e37e\u1e5fidindraka puk\u0101n # pergundiyu ki\u1e5fugundi tamma kur\u1e37ni\u1e5fidodu i kallu\u1e43 ==Transliteration of the text in modern Kannada== Digitally generated image of the inscription from a 3D scan of the 750CE Hebbal-Kittayya veeragalu The full reading of the inscription as published by Dr. P.V.

The Western Ganga dynasty were a powerful Southern Indian dynasty from 400-1000CE. Sripurusha\u2019s kingdom referred to as Gangavadi 96000 extended to the regions of modern-day Kolar, Bangalore, Krishnagiri, Salem, Erode, Mandya, Mysore, Coorg, Chikamagalur, Shimoga and Tumkur districts. Numerous veeragallus found from this period in these regions are testimonies to the fierce battles and skirmishes between the Gangas and the Rashtrakutas during this period. == Etymology of the place name Hebbal == The following is the etymology for the place-name Hebbal. piriya (big) + polal (town) in halegannada. piriya + po\u1e3bal = per-bo\u1e3bal > pervvo\u1e3bal > perbbo\u1e3bal > perbbo\u1e37 > pebbo\u1e37 > pebb\u0101\u1e37a > hebb\u0101\u1e37a \u0caa\u0cbf\u0cb0\u0cbf\u0caf + \u0caa\u0cca\u0cde\u0cb2\u0ccd = \u0caa\u0cc6\u0cb0\u200d\u0ccd\u0cac\u0cca\u0cde\u0cb2\u0ccd > \u0caa\u0cc6\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cb5\u0ccd\u0cb5\u0cca\u0cde\u0cb2\u0ccd > \u0caa\u0cc6\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cac\u0ccd\u0cac\u0cca\u0cde\u0cb2\u0ccd > \u0caa\u0cc6\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cac\u0ccd\u0cac\u0cca\u0cb3\u0ccd > \u0caa\u0cc6\u0cac\u0ccd\u0cac\u0cca\u0cb3\u0ccd > \u0caa\u0cc6\u0cac\u0ccd\u0cac\u0cbe\u0cb3 > \u0cb9\u0cc6\u0cac\u0ccd\u0cac\u0cbe\u0cb3 Between the 9th & 11th centuries many words in the Kannada language beginning with the character pa (\u0caa), the pa was replaced with character ha (\u0cb9) (e.g, puli->huli, paalu-> haalu). Similarly in some words containing a va (\u0cb5), the va was replaced by a ba (\u0cac). Over the centuries perbolal has become hebbal today. == Importance of the Inscription == # The Hebbal-Kittayya inscription is the oldest intact Kannada inscription in the city of Bengaluru. For comparison, it predates the earliest available literary work in Kannada, Kavirajamarga by about 100 years and provides an idea of the form and shape of characters that would have been used in this famous literary work by its author. # Being the oldest inscription in Bengaluru, Kittayya named in the inscription is the first documented resident of modern-day Bengaluru. This is the reason why he is fondly referred to as Bengaluru's first citizen by many historians. == The crowd-funded Ganga style mantapa == Inauguration of the crowdfunded Ganga style mantapa Bangalore once had about 160+ inscription stones documented in the Epigraphia Carnatica Vol 9, 1905ed. However, an on the ground verification shows only some 50 of these inscription stones are still around today. The 100+ inscription stones having been lost to callous development. In view of this and considering that a 750CE era inscription stone being discovered within the city as extremely improbable, a citizens group working for the conservation and awareness Bangalore\u2019s inscriptions \u201cInscription Stones of Bangalore\u201d launched a project to build a mantapa (pavilion) befitting enough for the Hebbal-Kittayya inscription. Yashaswini Sharma a conservation architect designed on pro-bono basis a Ganga style mantapa to house the inscription and the crowdfunding effort culminated in the completion of the mantapa in January 2020. Residents of Hebbal formally inaugurated-celebrated the completion of the mantapa by integrating it into their Sankranthi (Harvest festival) celebrations on 14 January 2020. ==See also== *Indian inscriptions *Kannada inscriptions *Early Indian epigraphy *History of Bangalore *Western Ganga dynasty *Hindu temple architecture ==References== Category:Kannada literature Category:Literature of Karnataka Category:History of Bangalore ",
