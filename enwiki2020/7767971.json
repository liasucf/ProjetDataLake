    "text": "Street Angel is the fifth studio album by American singer and songwriter Stevie Nicks. Released in 1994, the album peaked at #45 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart and has been certified Gold by the RIAA for shipments of over 500,000 copies. It is the last on Modern Records. ==Album history== The album was released in 1994, during a particularly unhappy time in Nicks' life and career. It was the first album she released after her much publicized departure from Fleetwood Mac, and during the tail end of her 7-year-long dependency on the prescription medication Klonopin. It is the least successful record of her solo career, peaking at only #45 in the U.S. with first week sales of 38,000, and spent only 3 weeks within the top 100. However, the album has achieved Gold status there for shipping 500,000 copies. Unlike all of her previous releases, the album did not yield any major hit singles, though \"Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind\" reached #57 on the Billboard Hot 100. A second single, \"Blue Denim\", reached number 70 in Canada. The album enjoyed slightly more prominence in the UK, where it peaked at #16, though again there were no top 40 hits from it. \"Blue Denim\" was originally lined up as the lead- release in the UK, and promotional copies were circulated to radio stations in April 1994, but it was replaced at the last moment by the more pop-friendly \"Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind\", which peaked at #42. The UK release of the \"Maybe Love...\" single featured two separate CD-single releases as an attempt to boost the song's chance of UK chart success (no promotional video was shot for the single, unlike \"Blue Denim\"), and included a newly recorded version of \"Thousand Days\" (originally demo-ed for her third solo album, Rock A Little). Nicks was not happy with production work done by Glyn Johns on the sessions and spoke about the issues in an interview with Joe Benson: \"And I didn't fix it while I was working with the person that I was working with (Johns)... who doesn't like to be talked about because he's not speaking to me, um... I didn't like it when he was there, and he knew it, and basically he told me to... like, in no uncertain English, very rough terms, to shut up and deal with it and this was the way it was going to be.\"http://rockalittle.com/offtherecord.htm \"This is not my record. So I went back in for about eight weeks and I didn't mess with the vocals, which I should have. But I was so sort of overwhelmed with trying to fix the things that I didn't like about the music, which was like... there was no percussion, there was no Waddy Wachtel. Because I was told that the last thing that I would need was Waddy Wachtel. And I, you know... I mean, to that comment I was so speechless that I just didn't do anything, I said ok. So when I went back in, I had Waddy come in and play, and I had Peter Michael come in and put percussion on, and Michael Campbell came back and put some more guitar on it, and we re-mixed everything, and we did a lot of other things besides that.\" \"I should have gone back in and really worked with the album, with the vocals. Because that's something that... I guess that was the last thing that I knew was wrong with it, and after being in two months trying to fix everything that I thought was wrong about the music and the mixes, it was almost kind of like, you know, maybe you just need to let this go and go on. I mean, this is three years now. And this record should have been out a long time ago. It may be new for everybody else, but it's really old for me.\" Regarding the song Blue Denim, Nicks stated, \"Well, I wrote this... um, it's a song about this guy who came into my life, but left just as quick. And his eyes were that intense, that it just makes you, even if you didn't know him, you would go, like, 'wow.' And you could be, like, the toughest person, but those eyes would make you be whatever he wanted you to be.\" Nicks later said in the video commentary of this song that the song was written about former lover Lindsey Buckingham. The album suffered further as Nicks spent her second stint in drug rehabilitation (for Klonopin dependency) during the mixing and mastering period. The record label rushed the production so Nicks would be ready to promote the album once out of rehab, but this meant that she had no input into the overall sound or track listing of the album - these duties were overseen by co-producer Thom Panunzio, who had previously worked with Nicks' close friend Tom Petty. On coming out of rehab, Nicks returned to the studio (without Johns) to overdub and re-record a lot of what had already been done. Despite her efforts, the album did not turn out how she wanted. She was, however, able to present some of the album's tracks (\"Street Angel\", \"Destiny\", \"Rose Garden\" and \"Blue Denim\") in her own final mixes on the 3-disc Enchanted retrospective in 1998. ==Track listing== Originally, the track \u201cIf You Were My Love\u201d, which Nicks had demo-ed for her 1981 debut album Bella Donna and for Fleetwood Mac\u2019s 1982 album Mirage, was slated to appear on this album. However, Nicks decided to remove it during the remastering with Panunzio. \u201cIf You Were My Love\u201d was released on Nicks\u2019s 2014 album 24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault. Additionally, the song \"I Call You Missing\", which had been demo-ed for 1985's Rock a Little, was tried out for this album, but did not surface. \"I Call You Missing\" remains unreleased. ==B-sides== # \"Mirror, Mirror\" \u2013 B-side to \"Blue Denim\" cassette single. Originally recorded for the Rock A Little album in 1984 and later surfaced during sessions for The Other Side of the Mirror in 1989 but was not included. Nicks later revealed that \"Mirror, Mirror\" was the original intended title for both albums. The version released as a B-side was recorded in 1984, but it was later revealed that a 1992 recording of the song was originally intended as the b-side and that the 1984 recording was added in error. # \"Thousand Days\" \u2013 B-side to the European CD single for \"Blue Denim\" and UK single for \"Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind\". Later appeared on disc 3 of the Enchanted box set. The song was originally written for the Rock a Little album, and demos were recorded, but the song was scrapped. # \"Inspiration\" - B-side to \"Maybe Love\". A song cut from the final album but included on the Japanese release as a bonus track. ==Personnel== ;Main Performers *Stevie Nicks \u2013 vocals, keyboards *Sharon Celani \u2013 backing vocals *Lori Nicks \u2013 backing vocals ;Session Musicians *Sara Fleetwood \u2013 backing vocals *Bernie Leadon \u2013 backing vocals, cello, guitar, mandocello, mandolin *Andy Fairweather Low \u2013 guitar, backing vocals *Peter Michael \u2013 drums, percussion *Christopher Nicks \u2013 harmonica on \"Greta\" *John Pierce \u2013 bass guitar *David Randi - bass guitar *Tim Pierce \u2013 guitar *Benmont Tench \u2013 organ, piano, synthesizer *Waddy Wachtel \u2013 guitar *Roy Bittan \u2013 piano, synthesizer *Mike Campbell \u2013 guitar *Bob Dylan \u2013 guitar, harmonica on \"Just Like A Woman\" *Ron Blair \u2013 bass guitar *Kenny Aronoff \u2013 drums, tambourine *David Crosby \u2013 vocals on \"Street Angel\" *Joel Derouin \u2013 synthesizer, violin on \"Jane\" *Pat Donaldson \u2013 bass guitar *Cat Gray \u2013 synthesizer *Ethan Johns \u2013 drums, guitar, percussion *Glyn Johns \u2013 drum programming *Dave Koz \u2013 saxophone ==Promotion and tour== Nicks made an appearance on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno on August 24, 1994, performing \"Blue Denim\" and sat down for an interview with Leno.
