He is mentioned as being from \"the land of Temani\", which may refer to the Edomite clan Teman. Husham was succeeded upon his death by Hadad ben Bedad. The date and even historicity of his reign are unknown, as he is not mentioned in any other surviving source. Category:Kings of Edom Category:Book of Genesis people ",
