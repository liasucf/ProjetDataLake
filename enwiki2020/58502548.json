The company was located on Toldbodvej (now Esplanaden). Jensen had recently returned from Germany and France where he had worked for some of the leading manufacturers of mill stones. The French mill stones were very sought after in Denmark at the time. The company published \"Ferdinand Jensen's Handbook for the Mill Industry\" (\"Ferd. Jensens Haandbog i M\u00f8lleindustrien\",) in 1893. The company was represented and won medals at a number of international exhibitions: 1879 (Berlin), 1880 (Malm\u00f8), 1888 (K\u00f8benhavn), 1896 (Malm\u00f8), 1897 (Stockholm). The growing company soon relocated to new and larger premises on Norgesgade (now Bredgade). It also started an import of Rheinich mill stones and later established a production of artificial mill stones. In 1775, Jensen established a sister company in Malm\u00f6. In 1994, he published a 75-page, bilingual (Danish and Swedish) \"Illustreret Katalog over Maskiner og Artikler til M\u00f8llebrug fra Kj\u00f8benhavns M\u00f8llestensfabrik og Malm\u00f8 franska Qvarnstensfabrik\". When the company's factory in Norgesgade also became too small, it relocated to a new site at Vodroffsvej 61 in Frederiksberg. A new factory was built in 1890. The ground floor contained the workshop. The first floor was used for offices and design studio. Hensen's father lived in an apartment of the second floor. Gerdinand Jensen lived with his family on the other side of the street in No. 56. The workshop in 1903 Ferdinand Jensen died from a stroke on 19 November 1898 The company was then continued by his widow Agnes Elisabeth Jensen (m\u00e9e Gr\u00f8nberg) until 1916 in a partnership with Carl Hemmerth who served as managin director. The company received more medals on international exhibitions in 1901 (Gefle), 1903 (Helsingborg), 1906 (Nork\u00f6bing) and 1907 (Lund). It was converted into a limited company () in 1921. On 17 May 1922, it was merged with N. Nielsen & Co., a company founded on 13 July 1871 by Niels Nielsen. The company was now located at Rentemestervej. Engineer Fritz B\u00fclow-Nielsen was managing director of the company from 1932. He died in 1936 and was succeeded by Erik Wintermark (born 1915). ==References== ==Rxternal links== Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of Denmark Category:Manufacturing companies based in Copenhagen Category:Danish companies established in 1867 ",
