The album contains the song \"Route 66\" which originally appeared on the soundtrack to the Burt Reynolds film Sharky's Machine. The album is essentially a live album (6 tracks) with some additional studio cuts (4 tracks). Five tracks were recorded live at the Nakano Sun Plaza in Japan in November 1983. Songs from these concerts were also released in 1996 on their album Man-Tora! Live in Tokyo. The other live cut, \"Duke of Dubuque\", was recorded for the Evening at Pops series on PBS. The song \"Safronia B\" was recorded in Sydney, Australia in December 1983. The other three songs were recorded in New York City. ==Charts== This album spawned another Billboard Hot 100 single in \"Baby Come Back to Me (The Morse Code of Love)\" which reached #83 on the chart in late 1984. The song was dedicated to The Capris (an Italian vocal group from Queens) who wrote and recorded it in 1982, and whose single \"There's a Moon Out Tonight\" was a top 10 hit in 1961. ==Awards== Route 66 hit the Billboard Hot 100 in 1982, reaching #78, and earned the group another Grammy Award in the category of \"Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Duo or Group.\" ==Track listing== == Personnel == ;The Manhattan Transfer * Cheryl Bentyne \u2013 vocals, vocal arrangements (6, 10) * Tim Hauser \u2013 vocals, musical arrangements (1), vocal arrangements (6, 8, 9, 10) * Alan Paul \u2013 vocals, vocal arrangements (6, 10) * Janis Siegel \u2013 vocals, musical arrangements (1), vocal arrangements (3-6, 10) ;Musicians * Yaron Gershovsky \u2013 keyboards, conductor, musical arrangements (2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10) * Jon Mayer \u2013 acoustic piano * Tom Kellock \u2013 synthesizers * Ira Newborn \u2013 guitar, musical arrangements (3, 8) * Wayne Johnson \u2013 guitar, musical arrangements (4) * Alex Blake \u2013 bass * Andy Muson \u2013 bass * Jim Nelson \u2013 drums * Art Rodriguez \u2013 drums, additional backing vocals (7) * Don Roberts \u2013 woodwinds, additional backing vocals (7) * Al Capps \u2013 vocal arrangements (1) * Richard Cole \u2013 vocal arrangements (2) * Phil Mattson \u2013 vocal arrangements (2) * John Cutcliffe \u2013 additional backing vocals (7) === Production === * Producers \u2013 Tim Hauser (Tracks 1, 2 & 4-10); Richard Perry and Tim Hauser (Track 3). * Tracking and Remix \u2013 Elliot Scheiner * Engineers \u2013 Howard Steele (Track 3) and Richard Lush (Track 7). * Second Engineers on Track 7 \u2013 Glen Holguin and Richard Muecke. * Tracking Engineer on Tracks 1, 2, 5, 8 & 9 \u2013 Kenichi Matsuda * Monitor Engineer on Tracks 1, 2, 5, 8 & 9 \u2013 Pete Winer * House Engineer on Tracks 1, 2, 5, 8 & 9 \u2013 Dan Kasting * Mastered by Bernie Grundman at A&M; Studios (Los Angeles, CA). * Art Direction \u2013 Bob Defrin * Cover Illustration \u2013 Leslie Cabarga * Management \u2013 Brian Avnet ==References / Sources== * The Manhattan Transfer Official Website Category:The Manhattan Transfer albums Category:1984 albums Category:Albums produced by Richard Perry Category:Atlantic Records albums ",
