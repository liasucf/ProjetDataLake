    "text": "Paul Schockem\u00f6hle (born 22 March 1945, in M\u00fchlen, Oldenburg) is a former German showjumper. He is the brother of Alwin Schockem\u00f6hle, another leading German rider. He was three times European Champion on his best horse Deister. In 1990, Schockem\u00f6hle was secretly recorded poling horses, a practice which involves rapping a horse's legs with a pole to train it to jump higher. Poling is forbidden by the International Equestrian Federation, and spot checks were subsequently carried out at several other German training establishments. Today, Schockem\u00f6hle is both a breeder and trainer of some of Germany's top sport horses. In October 2010, it was announced that he had purchased Moorlands Totilas, a champion dressage stallion shown by Edward Gal, from Moorlands Stables. ==Major achievements== *1976: Silver medal in team at the Olympic Games in Montreal with Agent *1981: Gold medal in team and individual at the European Championships in Munich with Deister *1983: Individual gold medal at the European Championships in Hickstead with Deister *1984: Bronze medal in team at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles with Deister *1985: Bronze medal in team and individual gold medal at the European Championships in Dinard with Deister *Hickstead Derby ** 1982: Winner with Deister ** 1985: Winner with Lorenzo ** 1986: Winner with Deister ==References== ==External links== * Paul Schockem\u00f6hle official website * Paul Schockem\u00f6hle and Deister in Gothenburg 1986 (Video) Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:People from Vechta (district) Category:German male equestrians Category:German show jumping riders Category:People from Oldenburg (state) Category:Olympic equestrians of West Germany Category:Equestrians at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Equestrians at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for West Germany Category:Olympic medalists in equestrian Category:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medalists for West Germany ",
