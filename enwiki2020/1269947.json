    "text": "Officers of the Schutzpolizei The Schutzpolizei (), or Schupo () for short, is a branch of the Landespolizei, the state (Land) level police of the German states. Schutzpolizei literally means security or protection police but is best translated as Protection police. The Schutzpolizei has by far the largest number of personnel, is on duty 24 hours a day and has the broadest range of duties. On patrol duty, mainly in vehicles, they keep their respective area under surveillance. As in most other countries, the uniformed police in Germany are usually the first to arrive at the scene of an incident, whether it is a murder or traffic accident. They also take the initial action (Erster Angriff), even if the case is handed over to investigators of the Kriminalpolizei (Kripo) later. These police officers are also responsible for promoting public safety, crime prevention, criminal prosecution and traffic control. Category:Police units of Germany ",
