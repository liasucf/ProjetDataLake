    "text": "My Devil in Your Eyes is the second studio album by American metalcore band The Color Morale. It was released on March 8, 2011 through Rise Records and was produced by Joey Sturgis. It is the last album to feature guitarist John Bross, who left the band in 2011. ==Critical reception== The album received mostly positive reviews, but also mixed reviews from several critics. JesusFreakHideout rated the album 4 out of 5 and stated: \"Now, I know those have legitimate, non-offensive uses, but I felt unclear about whether they threw those lyrics in with the non-offensive meanings implied, to sound passionate, to sound mainstream, or to just create controversy. Regardless of its intentions, I was a little turned off by that because I'd been looking for some good God-loving Christian music and got a tiny surprise there. Aside from that, the length of the record is only 36 minutes and 10 songs, which seems a little short to me. But My Devil in Your Eyes is a good album, and everytime I start listening to it I'm satisfied with my purchase. I'd recommend it to fans of Sent By Ravens, I Am Alpha And Omega, Blessthefall, Ballast, and all that good post-hardcore stuff.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from AllMusic.My Devil In Your Eyes \u2013 The Color Morale | AllMusicMy Devil In Your Eyes \u2013 The Color Morale Release | Common Revolt The Color Morale * Garret Rapp \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards * Ramon Mendoza \u2013 lead guitar * John Bross \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals * Justin Hieser \u2013 bass, vocals * Steve Carey \u2013 drums Additional musicians * Chad Ruhlig of For the Fallen Dreams \u2013 guest vocals on track 2, \"Human(s)being\" * Kellin Quinn of Sleeping with Sirens \u2013 guest vocals on track 3, \"The Dying Hymn\" * Chris Roetter of Like Moths to Flames \u2013 guest vocals on track 8, \"Quote on Quote\" Additional personnel * Joey Sturgis \u2013 engineering, mixing, mastering, production, guest vocals on track 6, \"Demon Teeth\" * Nick Sampson \u2013 engineering, vocal editing * Josh Schroeder \u2013 guest vocal tracking * Jeff Dunne \u2013 editing * Mark Hladish \u2013 logo design * Sons of Nero \u2013 layout design ==References== Category:2011 albums Category:Rise Records albums Category:Albums with cover art by Sons of Nero Category:The Color Morale albums Category:Albums produced by Joey Sturgis ",
