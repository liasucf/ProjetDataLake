The 1991 mass protests against Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 regime which have continued throughout the wars reinforced young people's antiwar orientation. The demonstrations in Belgrade were held mostly because of opposition the Battle of Vukovar, Siege of Dubrovnik and Siege of Sarajevo,\u017denski sud, 2013 while protesters demanded the referendum on a declaration of war and disruption of military conscription. More than 50,000 people participated in many protests, and more than 150,000 people took part in the most massive protest called \u201cThe Black Ribbon March\u201d in solidarity with people in Sarajevo. It is estimated that between 50,000 and 200,000 people deserted from the Yugoslav People's Army, while between 100,000 and 150,000 people emigrated from Serbia refusing to participate in the war. According to professor Renaud De la Brosse, senior lecturer at the University of Reims and a witness called by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), it is surprising how great the resistance to Milo\u0161evi\u0107's propaganda was among Serbs, given that and the lack of access to alternative news. A month after the Battle of Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64% of Serbian people wanted to end the war immediately and only 27% were willing for it to continue. Political scientists Orli Fridman described that not enough attention was given to anti-war activism among scholars studying the breakup of Yugoslavia and the wars, as well as that independent media and anti-war groups from Serbia did not attract the international attention. ==The main participants== The most famous associations and NGOs who marked the anti-war ideas and movements in Serbia were the Center for Antiwar Action, Women in Black, Humanitarian Law Center and Belgrade Circle. The Rimtutituki was a rock supergroup featuring Ekatarina Velika, Elektri\u010dni Orgazam and Partibrejkers members, which was formed at the petition signing against mobilization in Belgrade. The band organized a concert on the Republic Square and also they performed anti-war songs in an open truck while circulating the Belgrade streets. The most prominent politician who supported protests was Ivan Stamboli\u0107. The Democratic Party, People's Peasant Party, Serbian Liberal Party and Reform Party of Serbia took part in the \u201cThe Black Ribbon March\u201d.\u017denski sud, 2013 The famous architect Bogdan Bogdanovi\u0107 was one of the most prominent anti-war dissident. The Belgrade citizens who protested against the Siege of Dubrovnik were joined by prominent artists, composers and actors such as Mirjana Karanovi\u0107 and Rade \u0160erbed\u017eija, who sang jointly \u201cNe\u0107u protiv druga svog\u201d (\u201cI can\u2019t go against my friend\u201d). Independent media in Serbia reported on anti-war activities with much difficulty, in contrast to Milo\u0161evi\u0107's propaganda, which was aimed at reviving ethnonational sentiments and mobilizing people. An important role in media coverage was played by the independent electronic media B92 and Studio B. One of the more famous scenes during the anti-war protests was a tank parked in front of the Parliament Building, which was returned from the battlefield in Vukovar by soldier Vladimir \u017divkovi\u0107. ==See also== * 1992 anti-war protests in Sarajevo * Concert Yutel for Peace ==References== ;Books * * * ;Journal articles and documents * * Category:1991 in Serbia Category:1991 protests Category:1992 protests Category:1990s in Belgrade Category:Yugoslav Wars Category:Breakup of Yugoslavia Category:Protests in Serbia Category:Events in Belgrade Category:Anti-war Category:Pacifism ",
