He was ordained a priest early in 1795, taking the name Yohannan. In the same year he was appointed metropolitan of Salmas and he was consecrated a bishop at Baghdad on 8 November 1795 by Yohannan Hormizd (then metropolitan of Mosul), on the instructions of the Vatican. His appointment was resisted by a party in the Salmas district, who wanted as their bishop the priest Isaac, a nephew of the late metropolitan Ishoyahb Shemon. They sent Isaac to the Nestorian patriarch Shemon XVI Yohannan, who consecrated him bishop of Salmas at Qudshanis, giving him the name Ishoyahb Melchisedec. Eventually, following an approach by Yohannan Hormizd to the Persian authorities, Ishoyahb Gabriel was able to assert his authority and administer his diocese without opposition. As metropolitan of Salmas he was recognised as vicar with jurisdiction over the Mar Thoma Christians of Malabar by the Vatican in 1801.Hornus, J.-M., 'M\u00e9moire sur l'\u00e9tat actuel et l'avenir de la religion catholique et des missions lazaristes et protestantes en Perse par le Comte de Challaye, consul de France \u00e0 Erz\u00e9roun' (Cahiers d'\u00c9tudes Chr\u00e9tiennes Orientales 8-9 f\u00fcr 1970/73), Action Chr\u00e9tienne en Orient, Strasbourg o.

According to Yohannan's nephew Joseph Guriel, followed by Tfinkdji, Yohannan Guriel died on 15 July 1833. According to his epitaph in the cemetery of Khosrowa, however, whose inscription styles him 'Mar Yohannan, metropolitan of Khosrowa, son of Jonas', he died on 13 July 1832. ==See also== ==Notes== Category:1758 births Category:1833 deaths Category:Chaldean bishops Category:People from Salmas Category:Iranian bishops Category:Iranian Assyrian people Category:Iranian people of Assyrian descent ",
