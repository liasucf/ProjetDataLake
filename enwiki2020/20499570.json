He was a natural son of A.K. Razumovsky and an uncle of Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy, also a well-known man of letters. During the Patriotic War of 1812 (invasion of Napoleon Bonaparte) he served in the acting army as a volunteer. When living in Germany during his military service Perovsky took a great interest in German romanticism, and Hoffman, in particular, and it had a great impact on his own creativity. After retirement he settled in Petersburg and took care of upbringing and education of his nephew Aleksey. During that period Perovsky came to be one of the most active defenders of Alexander Pushkin, then a beginning poet. After the death of his father in 1822 Aleksey Perovsky settled in Pogoreltsy Estate in Ukraine, together with his sister and nephew and took the penname of Antony Pogorelsky, based on the estate name. Antony Pogorelsky's remarkable set of stories Dvoinik (The Double, or My Evenings in Little Russia) (1828) was closely related to the German fantastic tradition (Serapion Brothers by Hoffman) and anticipated the famous Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka by Nikolai Gogol and Russian Nights by Vladimir Odoevsky. In 1829 Pogorelsky published the book that brought him real fame: it was the fairy tale Black Hen, or Living Underground written for his nephew, the first book about childhood in Russian literature. His novel Monastyrka, a \u201cmoral-descriptive novel\u201d combining both sentimental and romantic elements was very well accepted by public and critics. ==External links== * Antony Pogorelsky's Biography * Works by Pogorelsky Category:1787 births Category:1836 deaths Category:19th-century Russian novelists Category:19th- century Russian short story writers Category:19th-century Russian writers Category:Imperial Russian male writers Category:Imperial Russian novelists Category:Imperial Russian short story writers Category:Members of the Russian Academy Category:Russian male novelists Category:Russian male short story writers Category:Russian military personnel of the Napoleonic Wars ",
