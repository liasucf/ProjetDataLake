    "text": "Malik Muhammad khan () \u2014 was second khan of Baku and a son of Mirza Muhammad Khan. == Reign == He was a firstborn son of Mirza Muhammad and daughter of Husein khan Rudbar. He was later a son-in-law of Fatali khan. He was already ruling in his father's name since 1765 and was practically a vassal of Quba khanate. When Fatali khan invaded Derbent khanate in 1766, captured it's khan Muhammad Husein Khan, blinded him and sent with his son Ali to Baku and ordered Malik Muhammad to keep them as hostages. He was described as an extremely cruel ruler by Samuel Gmelin.Iskenderova M.S. The Baku Khanate, Baku: \u00c7a\u015f\u0131o\u011flu, 1999, p.76 (in Russian) Although according to Azerbaijani historian Marziya Isgandarova, this could be due to the fact that khan was suspicious of him and once told him \"Would they allow an outsider to do that in Russia?\" when Samuel was examining oil fields in 1770. Samuel was even denied to stay inside city walls and drink water from city wells. According to Samuel, a Quba army contingent was garrisoned in Saray. After Fatali khan's invasion of Shamakhy and forcibly deposing Aghasi Khan, Avar khan (nutsal) Muhammed IV and Shaki khan Mahammadhuseyn Khan combined their forces and attacked Fatali khan. Battle was a disaster for allied forces, where Avar khan lost his brother and nephew.Leviatov V.N. Essays from the history of Azerbaijan in the XVIII century. - B .: AN ASSR, 1948. pp. 132-133 (in Russian) However, in 1774, Muhammed restored Aghasi Khan to Shirvan throne and challenged Quba khanate forces. Malik Muhammad headed his own forces to join battle where they defeated nutsal, forced him to negotiate and murdered him. This treacherous act enraged Caucasian rulers who allied their forces against Fatali Khan - new energetic Avar nutsal Umma V and Kaitag utsmi Amir Hamza rallied different Dagestani rulers to invade Quba with reinforcements from Karabakh khanate (Ibrahim Khalil khan was a son-in-law to Umma V). Battle of Gavdushan plains near Khudat in 1774 was a heavy blow to Fatali Khan's ambitions. Amir Hamza raided Baku environs and returned to Kaitag within a year. He was sent to Karabakh negotiate peace with by Fatali in 1779, where he was detained by Ibrahimkhalil khan. However, after Fatali's punitive raids, he was freed in 1781. == Death == After his release, he appointed his 11-year-old son Mirza Muhammad to be in charge of Baku during his pilgrimage to Mecca. However he died in 1784 en route near Najaf according to Bakikhanov, meanwhile other sources say he was buried in Karbala. == Family == He had two wives, one of whom was Khadija Bika (b. 1739, d. 1803), sister of Fatali Khan.
