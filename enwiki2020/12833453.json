HNUE High School, in Vietnamese: Tr\u01b0\u1eddng THPT chuy\u00ean, \u0110\u1ea1i h\u1ecdc S\u01b0 ph\u1ea1m H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, or, as commonly known, Chuy\u00ean S\u01b0 ph\u1ea1m (CSP)) is a public magnet school in Hanoi, Vietnam. The school was founded in 1966 as a national educational institution to nurture Vietnamese students who excelled at mathematics. One of the three national gifted high schools in Hanoi, along with Foreign Language Specialized School and Natural Science Gifted High School, HNUE High School is the second oldest magnet high school in Vietnam. The school and HUS High School for Gifted Students are often interchangeably ranked the first in National Science Olympiads for high school students and National University Entrance Examinations. HNUE High School ranks second nationally in the 2012 Vietnam university admission ranking.http://flss.edu.vn/Home.asp?param=news&NewsID;=147 Established as a school for mathematics talents, in recent years, HNUE high school's specialized education have spanned over other subjects such as physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, English and literature. == Foundation and history == During the Vietnam War, aware of the important role of sciences for future of the country, a group of Vietnam leading scientists including L\u00ea V\u0103n Thi\u00eam, Ho\u00e0ng T\u1ee5y and T\u1ea1 Quang B\u1eedu suggested that the government open up selective programs to nurture talented students, and to encourage them to follow science in their later years at universities and professions. As a premier national institution for training of science teachers, Hanoi National University of Education was selected to organize such a program. On December 24, 1966, at the height of the Vietnam War, the first class for gifted students was inaugurated with 33 mathematically inclined students, who were chosen from thousands of high school students in North Vietnam, at the evacuation site of the university in Ph\u00f9 C\u1eeb District, H\u01b0ng Y\u00ean Province. This class was the foundation of HNUE High School. HNUE High School main building The history of Hanoi National University of Education High School is divided three periods: * From 1966 to 1995, the special math classes were under the administration of the faculty of Mathematics, Hanoi National University of Education. * In 1995, the school expanded to include a specialized stream in Computer Science. It was then renamed Specialized School for Maths and Computer Science. * In 2005, the school started offering classes specialized in Literature, Physics, Chemistry and Biology and was named \"High School for Gifted Students of Hanoi National University of Education\". The HNUE High School was honored with many national awards, including the 3rd degree Labor Decoration award in 1986, the 2nd degree Labor Decoration in 1996, and most recently the 1st degree Labor Decoration (2001). == Education == === Admissions === In the first period of establishment of the school in the 80s, HNUE High School for Gifted Students did not directly handle the admission process; this work was taken by the Ministry of Education and Training. During this period, students with outstanding abilities in mathematics (only in Northern region, from Nam Dinh province northwards) were nominated by the region to the Ministry of Education and Training before participating in an entrance exam. Students who passed the exam would be divided two schools: High School for Gifted Students, Hanoi University of Science and HNUE High School for Gifted Students or HSGS High School for Gifted Students. Since the end of 1980, with the wave of eradication of subsidy mechanism, HNUE High School for Gifted Students and HSGS High School for Gifted Students directly handle their own admission process. The school's entrance examinations are held in June, attracts students from all over the countries. Candidates must take three compulsory papers on the first day of testing (Vietnamese language, Mathematics and English) and on the second day, one elective paper (from Mathematics, Literature, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, English studies ) for their specialization. These exams are highly competitive. Student Flower {in Vietnamese}: === Education model === The students are organized into specialized streams in one of the following subjects: Mathematics, Literature, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science and English. Each stream is offered an accelerated curriculum on the subject of specialization. Seminars are held during the school year, at which students can discuss with national and international scientists and researchers. Extra-curricular activities include sports, camping and clubs. === Teaching staff === Members of the staff often provide annual training for national Olympiad teams for international competitions, and have been consulted for developing textbooks and curriculum for Vietnamese national high school education.
