    "text": "Joseph Baldwin was an English professional footballer who played as an inside forward. Born in Blackburn, Lancashire, he started his career as an amateur with his hometown club Blackburn Rovers. He was signed on professional terms in the summer of 1929 by Football League Third Division North outfit Nelson. Along with a host of other new signings, Baldwin made his league debut on 11 September 1930 in the 1\u20130 defeat to Darlington at Seedhill. However, he struggled in the match and did not appear again for the club, returning to the reserves at Blackburn Rovers later in the year. ==References== Category:English footballers Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. players Category:Nelson F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Sportspeople from Blackburn Category:Association football forwards Category:Possibly living people Category:Year of birth missing ",
