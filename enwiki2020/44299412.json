(2011). Selling street and snack foods, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations: Rome. Retrieved 29 October 2014. They can be found throughout the city, especially in the areas of Mong Kok, Causeway Bay, Yuen Long, Tsuen Wan, and Kwun Tong. ==Characteristics== Street food is ready to be taken away and eaten elsewhere instantly. Generally, the customers are served snacks, which are contained in polystyrene boxes, with disposable bamboo sticks or plastic utensils. Street food needs to be sold along the street, even though nowadays street stalls have transformed into shops without providing seats. Food can easily be taken away via small plastic bags, paper bags or bowls. The food is prepared quite quickly. Nutritionists contend that, compared to other food, street food is often cooked in greater quantities of oil such and hawkers usually add large amounts of sugar or salt for seasoning.MSL Nutritional Diet Centre Website.

Then, during Qing dynasty, the street-side snack stalls gradually developed into street markets.<\u81ea\u8ca0>, \u300a\u5510\u646d\u8a00\u300b\u5377\u5341\u4e8c, \u738b\u5b9a\u4fdd. As highlighted in a feature article namely 'Finding the Dining Habit of the Unemployed' (Chinese: \u5c0b\u627e\u5730\u8e0e\u98f2\u98df), the scene of hawkers carrying wood barrels, traditional wares and stoves has become part of the history of local street snacks.\u67cf\u9f4a, \uff1c\u5c0b\u627e\u5730\u8e0e\u98f2\u98df\uff1e , HKEdCity website. ===Development in 20th century=== In the 1950s, facing the economic downturn and high unemployment rate, the majority of grass roots were forced to become itinerant hawkers to maintain their livelihood. Owing to the limited resources, rough canopies, cooking stove and wooden carts were used. Considering the effectiveness and convenience, they sold the snacks on mobile carts in the main streets to maximise revenue.\u6d88\u5931\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u8ca9\u6587\u5316, \u6881\u71d5\u73b2,\u300a\u5dba\u5357\u5927\u5b78 \u6587\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u300b, July 2011 During the post-war period, the political stability and economic development of Hong Kong attracted immigrants from Mainland China.\u9999\u6e2f\u6230\u5f8c\u5de5\u696d\u767c\u5c55, \u300a\u9999\u6e2f\u8a18\u61b6\u8a08\u5283\u300b, 2012 At that time, 300,000 of them worked as hawkers, including street food hawkers. The growth in the number of itinerant hawkers fostered the development of street food culture.Hawker, Wikipedia. Retrieved 29 October 2014. These hawkers mainly served the lower-income group. These stalls were in form of junkers, a kind of wooden car with wheels, allowing these junkers to be pulled and pushed around.Hong Kong Travel Guide: Hong Kong Street Food http://www.hongkongtripguide.com/hong-kong-street-food.html The food was very often cheap in price and with many variations.Popular Hong Kong Street Food by Lionel http://www.weekendnotes.com/popular-hong-kong-street-food/ They became very popular during 1950s to 1960s.

Retrieved 29 October 2014. This showed in the change in government policies. For example, the government stopped issuing itinerant hawker licenses to control the number of hawker stalls since 1979. Later, the Urban Council and the Regional Council implemented a policy to eliminate hawkers in 1995.Hung, W. S.

The street snacks contained germs like cholera and Escherichia coli. According to a publicity film released by the Medical and Health Department in 1987, food stalls were considered unhygienic in terms of their environment and cooking process. In the video, a hawker was shown smoking while selling snacks.\u5207\u52ff\u5149\u9867\u7121\u724c\u719f\u98df\u5c0f\u8ca9, publicity film (1987), Medical and Health Department His stall was located beside a busy road and the floor was wet with rubbish and sewage. This unhygienic condition aroused customer concern, which acted as a catalyst for change. The hawkers do not sell their goods in permitted areas, apply for hawker licenses, or fight for legislation that will make unlicensed hawking a kind of legal activity in the 1970s.Siu, K. W. M.

Those people were trying to live a better life in Hong Kong, as an escape of Chinese Authority. However, most of the people were not educated, therefore, barely did they earn a living. At that time, people lived in extremely crammed environment, many them chose to start their 'business' in the street, including food selling, singing and story telling. Between the 1960s and 1970s, it was the heyday of hawkers. There were more than 300 thousand people in the industry, accounting for 20% of the labor force. Thanks to the time that there were neither shopping malls nor markets, it provided many opportunities for hawkers to extend their business. The hawkers were then no longer limited to earning a living, but started to pursue better quality of life. Often crowds surrounding hawkers' carts are seen as causing inconvenience to other pedestrians. In some cases, the elderly might slip as they walked over the puddles, while children might get hurt by the boiled oil from the stalls.\uff1c\u8ab0\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u2500\u6230\u5f8c\u9999\u6e2f\u7684\u516c\u6c11\u6587\u5316\u8207\u653f\u6cbb\u8ad6\u8ff0\uff1e, \u7f85\u6c38\u751f, Oxford University Press(Hong Kong).

In short, the above honour has arisen Hong Kong citizens' appreciation towards the local street food culture. ===Demonstration of core values in Hong Kong=== Street snacks have epitomised Hong Kong's core values of cultural diversity. An example can be the emergence of street stalls selling foreign treats like Takoyaki and Indonesia skewers. This showed the diversity of choices of street snacks and matches Hong Kong's title of Gourmet Paradise. Despite all changes, it can also represent Hong Kong's identity. For example, the name of 'Hong Kong style Egg Waffle' showed its local origin.Christine Ho (2010).Kong Style Egg Waffle (\u96de\u86cb\u4ed4 Original Flavour) The alterable essence of local street food has demonstrated Hong Kong cultural acceptance and serves as a medium to display its character to the world. In 2015, a marked rise in nativist sentiment led to the growing influence of localist groups such as Civic Passion and Hong Kong Indigenous. Localists, feeling that street vendors \u2013 who generally representing the bottom stratum of Hong Kong society \u2013 were being increasingly oppressed by a government colluding with commercial interests and property owners, offered high-profile support for the traditional lunar new year Kweilin Street Night Market in 2015 when it was targeted for closure by the CY Leung administration. On the eve of lunar new year in 2016, FEHD inspectors carried out a pre-emptive raid against street vendors in Sham Shui Po, and made arrests and seizures. This led to the 2016 Mong Kok civil unrest, where nativists defended stall holders from being victimised by FEHD inspectors and engaged in confrontations with the police. ==List of common Hong Kong street food== Next Stop Hong Kong. http://www.nextstophongkong.com/gourmet/street-food/ .Retrieved 29 October 2014.Christopher DeWolf, Izzy Ozawa, Tiffany Lam, Virginia Lau, and Zoe Li.
