Lama is currently the highest international goal-scorer in Nepal, with 33 total international goals to her name. ==Personal life== Besides being a footballer Lama is also a member of the Armed Police Force, she along with Bhagwati Thapa, Laxmi Poudel and Usha Bhandari missed the first weeks of training for the 2014 SAFF Women's Championship because they had to go through the mandatory quarantine for the Ebola virus disease as the four had served in the U.N. mission in Liberia. ==International career== Anu Lama made her debut for Nepal U-23 during the 2010 South Asian Games women's football tournament against Bangladesh. Lama performed well landing Nepal a silver medal overall after scoring against Sri Lanka (1-0), and a hat-trick against Pakistan (1-0, 4-0, 6-0). During the same year, Lama was later called up for the senior team for the 2010 SAFF Women's Championship. In a friendly match against Kuwait Lama scored four goals in an 8-0 victory. After the match Lama dedicated her four goals to all the Nepalese fans who had made the long trip to support the team. === International goals === :Scores and results list Nepal's goal tally first. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! # !!
