    "text": "Skanderbeg Square () is a square in Pristina, Kosovo. ==Location and history== Following the end of the Kosovo conflict in 1999 and longer under Serbian rule, Kosovo Albanians in 2001 erected a monument within the centre of Pristina to Skanderbeg, a medieval Albanian who fought against Ottoman forces. Over a journey of four days the statue was brought from Kruj\u00eb in Albania to the middle of Pristina. The Skanderbeg statue of Pristina shares a similar socialist aesthetic and equestrian posture with minor differences in detail to existing Skanderbeg monuments in Tiran\u00eb, Skopje and other places in Europe. Skanderbeg is depicted on a horse with its right leg up in a menacing pose and his sword is outside of its sheath and pointed toward the ground. A war memorial dedicated to the victims of the Kosovo war is present in Skanderbeg square along with a series of photographs depicting the missing from the conflict. Skanderbeg Square is bordered on one side by Rugova Square, a space named after the first Kosovo President Ibrahim Rugova and on the other side by Mother Teresa Boulevard, named after Saint Teresa of Calcutta. Along with Tiran\u00eb and Skopje, Pristina is one of three Balkan capitals to install a Skanderbeg statue. ==Gallery== File:Skanderbeg Square (Pristina) 1.jpg|Bilingual sign designating Skanderbeg Square File:Skanderbeg Monument (Pristina) 2.jpg|Skanderbeg statue File:Skanderbeg Square (Pristina) 11.jpg|Skanderbeg Square File:Skanderbeg Statue And Kosovo Army.JPG|Parade by Kosovo Security Force in square File:Skanderbeg Square (Pristina) 2.jpg|War memorial dedicated to the victims of the Kosovo war File:Skanderbeg Square (Pristina) 9.jpg|Banner with photographs depicting the missing from the conflict File:Skanderbeg Square (Pristina) 8.jpg|Banner and flags honouring the Kosovo Liberation Army File:Skanderbeg Square (Pristina) 10.jpg|Banner with photographs depicting the missing from the conflict File:Skanderbeg Square (Pristina) 7.jpg|Poster of Skanderbeg in square File:Skanderbeg Monument (Pristina) 5.jpg|Pedestal plaque of the Skanderbeg statue File:Ne Udhetim 132.jpg|Skanderbeg statue on old pedestal (2000s) File:Gjergj Skanderbeg statue in Prishtin\u00eb, Kosovo - 1.jpg|Skanderbeg statue on new pedestal (2010s) ==See also== * Skanderbeg Square in Tiran\u00eb, Albania * Skanderbeg Square in Skopje, North Macedonia ==References== ==External links== * Category:Geography of Pristina Category:Tourist attractions in Pristina Category:Squares in Kosovo ",
