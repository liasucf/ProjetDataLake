    "text": "In variance analysis (accounting) direct material price variance is the difference between the standard cost and the actual cost for the actual quantity of material purchased. It is one of the two components (the other is direct material usage variance) of direct material total variance. ==Example== Let us assume that the standard direct material cost of widget is as follows: :2 kg of unobtainium at \u20ac 60 per kg ( = \u20ac 120 per unit). Let us assume further that during the given period, 100 widgets were manufactured, using 212 kg of unobtainium which cost \u20ac 13,144. Under those assumptions direct material price variance can be calculated as: Direct material price variance is because Todd pays too much for steel can be reconciled to direct material total variance by way of direct material usage variance: {{Infobox VarianceAnalysis VarianceBoxRec|tx1=Direct material usage variance |tx2=Direct material price variance |tx3=Direct material total variance |am1=720 |am2=424 |am3=1,144 |va1=A |va2=A |va3=A spending variance seen as per product cost (212*62)-(200*60) See direct material total variance#Example and direct material usage variance#Example for computations of both components. ==See also== *Variance analysis (accounting) Category:Management accounting ",
