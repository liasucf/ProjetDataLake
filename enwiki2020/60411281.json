She was known for her elegant colour linocut and woodcut prints of mostly topographical scenes. ==Biography== Findlay lived in Glasgow and studied at the Glasgow School of Art from 1912 to 1914. She studied under Claude Flight at the Grosvenor School of Modern Art and, for a period, her work was influenced by the style of the Futurists. Findlay spent some years living with her brother, an army officer, and his wife at St Ives in Cornwall. In Cornwall, Findlay exhibited with, and was a member of, the St Ives Society of Artists but by 1938 she had returned to Scotland. Findley was also a member of, and exhibited with, the Glasgow Society of Artist Printers, which was founded in 1921, and the Glasgow Society of Lady Artists. In Scotland she lived at Killearn in Stirlingshire and exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy from 1926 to 1942, with the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts and, one at least one occasion, with the Aberdeen Artists Society. Findlay also had exhibitions at the Redfern Gallery and at Manchester City Art Gallery. The British Museum holds an example of her 1932 print, The paper mill. ==References== Category:1885 births Category:1968 deaths Category:20th-century British printmakers Category:20th-century British women artists Category:Alumni of the Glasgow School of Art Category:Alumni of the Grosvenor School of Modern Art Category:Artists from Glasgow Category:Scottish wood engravers Category:Scottish women painters ",
