    "text": "The Oxhead school (Niu-t'ou zong) was a short lived tradition of Chinese Chan Buddhism founded by Fa-jung (Niutou Farong, \u725b\u982d\u6cd5\u878d, 594-657), who was a Dharma heir of the Fourth Patriarch Tao-hsin (580-651).Baroni, Helen J. (2002) The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism, The Rosen Publishing Group, p. 251. Their main temple was located at Oxhead Mountain (Niu-t'ou shan) in Chiang-su, near modern Nanjing, hence the name. The school thrived throughout the Tang and the early years of the Song dynasty (10th century).Ferguson, Andy (2011), Zen's Chinese Heritage: The Masters and Their Teachings, Simon and Schuster, p. 38. According to John R. McRae, the original text of an influential Zen work called the Platform Sutra may have originated within the Oxhead school.McRae, John R.(1983). The Northern School of Chinese Chan Buddhism. Ph.D. dissertation, Yale University. Another text associated with this school is the Treatise on the Transcendence of Cognition (Ch\u00fceh-kuan lun \u7d76\u89c0\u8ad6). This text is a dialogue between two hypothetical characters, Professor Enlightenment and the student Conditionality.McRae, John R. The Antecedents of Encounter Dialogue in Chinese Ch'an Buddhism in: The Koan: Texts and Contexts in Zen Buddhism, ed. Steven Heine and ed. Dale S. Wright (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 46-74. Regarding their teachings, according to McRae, they were > \"fundamentally in agreement with those of the Northern School on the > subjects of mental contemplation and the necessity of constant practice, and > both schools were known for their use of contemplative analysis. The major > difference between the two schools lay in the Ox-head\u2019s use of a certain > logical pattern that included, at one stage, the extensive use of negation. > (This distinctive proclivity to negation appears prominently in the mind- > verses of the Platform Sutra.)\"McRae, John R. (1987) The Northern School and > the Formation of Early Ch'an Buddhism (Kuroda Studies in East Asian > Buddhism), pp. 241-242. Their lineage is said to have been transmitted to Japan by Saicho, founder of the Tendai sect. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:Chan schools ",
