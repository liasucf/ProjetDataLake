On December 18 Bondars also left the alliance. In 2018, he joined their former allies during the 2017 Riga City Council elections, the party For Latvia's Development. == References == Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK politicians Category:Latvian Association of Regions politicians Category:For Latvia's Development politicians Category:Deputies of the 12th Saeima Category:Deputies of the 13th Saeima Category:Candidates for President of Latvia Category:University of Latvia alumni ",
