    "text": "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy () is a book by Karl Marx, first published in 1859. The book is mainly an analysis of capitalism and quantity theory of money,A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Chapter II, 3 achieved by critiquing the writings of the leading theoretical exponents of capitalism at that time: these were the political economists, nowadays often referred to as the classical economists; Adam Smith (1723\u201390) and David Ricardo (1772\u20131823) are the foremost representatives of the genre. ==Significance== Much of the Critique was later incorporated by Marx into his magnum opus, Capital (Volume I), published in 1867, and the Critique is generally considered to be of secondary importance among Marx's writings. This does not apply, however, to the Preface of the Critique. It contains the first connected account of one of Marx's main theories: the materialist conception of history, and its associated \"base and superstructure\" model of society, which divides human social development into an economic-technological \"base\" which \"conditions\"\u2014 not determines \u2014 the forms of its political-ideological \"superstructure\".Otto Ruhle (\"The Materialist Interpretation of History\", in Ruhle (1943)) says that the \"Preface\" contained \"the first connected account\" of Marx's economic interpretation of history. Briefly, this is the idea that economic factors \u2013 the way people produce the necessities of life \u2013 conditions the kind of politics and ideology a society can have: Marcello Musto emphasizes this point: \"Even the well-known thesis in the 'Preface' to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy...should not be interpreted in a determinist sense; it should be clearly distinguished from the narrow and predictable reading of 'Marxism\u2013Leninism', in which the superstructural phenomena of society are merely a reflection of the material existence of human beings.\"Marcello Musto, Another Marx: Early Manuscripts, trans. Patrick Camiller (London: Bloomsbury, 2018), pp. 105\u201306. ==Editions== In English, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy is available in an edition edited by Maurice Dobb, published in London in 1979; and from Progress Publishers, Moscow (translation by S. W. Ryazanskaya). Lawrence and Wishart (London), and International Publishers (New York) cooperate in the publication of the Progress Publishers edition.
