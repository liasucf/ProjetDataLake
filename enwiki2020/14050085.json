    "text": "The Green Post (German: \"Die Gr\u00fcne Post\") was a German newspaper from the Ullstein publishing house. Operations began on 10 April 1927, the paper enjoying a quick rise in popularity in all social classes, reaching a circulation of over one million during its first year. Its founder was future travel writer and journalist Richard Katz. Its editor was Ehm Welk, who would be later known for his work Die Heiden von Kummerow. In 1934, the Green Post ran an editorial under Welks' assumed alias Thomas Trimm, entitled \"A word please, Mr. Reichsminister\" in which he criticized Nazi press censorship under Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. The event led to Welk's imprisonment in KZ Oranienburg until public protest saw him released on the condition that he be banned from his profession. ==References== Category:Publications established in 1927 Category:Newspapers published in Germany ",
