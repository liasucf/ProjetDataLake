    "text": "Samolus valerandi is a species of water pimpernel native to a very wide area across Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. Common names include seaside brookweed, brookweed, thin-leaf brookweed, water cabbage, and water rose.Huxley. A. The New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. 1992. MacMillan Press 1992 ==Description== It is a small perennial, growing to around 35 cm (13.8 inches) high. Its inflorescence is a raceme, with small white flowers on long stalks. Its corollas have five lobes. It can produce flowers throughout the growing season, from spring to fall. Its fruits are capsules that are green and globose. Image:Samolus parviflorus.jpg|Mature inflorescences are widely spreading, with fruits on long stalks ==Taxonomy== Although some floras recognize the North American populations of S. valerandi as a separate species (S. parviflorus) or subspecies (S. valerandi ssp. parviflorus), a 2012 investigation based on molecular and morphological data indicated that S. vagans and S. parviflorus should not be regarded as separate species but as part of a widespread \"S. valerandi species complex\". ==Ecological aspects== This species is found in a variety of wet habitats, including stream banks, tidal marshes, and seeps. It can be found in both degraded and intact natural communities.IllinoisWildflowers ==Cultivation== The plant can be grown in ponds, bog gardens, and damp areas in the garden. S. valerandi prefers light (sandy), medium (loamy), and heavy (clay) soils, preferably neutral or basic (alkaline) soils. It cannot tolerate shade and likes a bright, sunny position. It requires moist or wet soil and can even grow in water. The plant can tolerate maritime exposure and is self-fertile. S. valerandi is sometimes grown in aquariums, although they seem to last only a limited time when grown fully submersed. ==References== ==External links== * Fora of North Central Texas * Flora of Missouri - illustrated * Illinois Wild Flowers valerandi Category:Flora of Europe Category:Flora of Africa Category:Flora of Asia Category:Flora of South America Category:Flora of North America Category:Flora of Australia Category:Freshwater plants Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
