    "text": "\u00d6regrund is a locality situated in \u00d6sthammar Municipality, Uppsala County, Sweden. As of 2010, it had 1,555 inhabitants. It is located by the Baltic Sea, on the coast of Uppland. Despite its small population, \u00d6regrund is still commonly referred to as a city for historical reasons . == History == \u00d6regrund circa 1700, in Suecia antiqua et hodierna The town was granted a royal charter in 1491, by request from citizens from nearby city of \u00d6sthammar. \u00d6sthammar had once been a coastal town, but due to post-glacial rebound its harbour had become useless. The royal council granted the request to construct a city at the end of the archipelago where the sea opened. It further proclaimed \"the city shall forever be known as \u00d6regrund\". The small but expanding city soon became a point of conflict. In 1520 Christian II of Denmark conquered Stockholm. A young Gustav Eriksson tried to gather an army, and \u00d6regrund became the port whereto ships with men and weapons were transported. As a countermeasure, the Danish King had the city burnt in the winter of 1520. And so, the citizens of \u00d6regrund had to move back to \u00d6sthammar. Not until 1555, when Gustav Eriksson had become King Gustav I of Sweden (Vasa) and stabilized the nation, were the citizens granted permission to reconstruct the city. Uppland underwent an industrial revolution in the 17th century, with the Swedish iron industry becoming the foundation of Sweden's status as a Great Power. Bar iron was exported through \u00d6regrund. In England the best quality wrought iron was known as Oregrounds iron. Fishing was basically the only industry through the centuries. The industrialization of the 19th century never took hold in \u00d6regrund; instead establishing itself in the nearby \u00d6sthammar. In the late 19th century a new industry prospered: the spas. People from outside built summer houses and made \u00d6regrund their summer residence. During this era, several fine villas and gardens were built. However, the summer residents led to decreased tax incomes for economically troubled city. In 1968, \u00d6regrund was merged with the then-city of \u00d6sthammar. Since the municipal reform of 1971, \u00d6regrund is in \u00d6sthammar Municipality. In 2017 \u00d6regrund was used as scenery for the Dutch television show (Crown Witness). == Modern times == The nave of \u00d6regrund is still the harbour. In modern times it is mainly used for small boats. In the summer it flourishes due to small sailboats and other pleasure boats. Boats also arrive from Stockholm, taking a trip from the Stockholm Archipelago. == Sights == \u00d6regrund is one of Uppland's best kept wooden cities and attracts many visitors. Apart from the wooden houses, there is also a noteworthy stone church in the town center, and a town hall from the mid 19th century. == References == == External links == * om \u00d6regrund (in Swedish) * article \u00d6regrund from Nordisk familjebok (1922) * \u00d6regrund historia private webpage / Stig Sandelin (Summary in English: ) Category:Populated places in Uppsala County Category:Populated places in \u00d6sthammar Municipality Category:Coastal cities and towns in Sweden ",
