    "text": "Oblique is an album by jazz vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson featuring performances by Herbie Hancock, Albert Stinson and Hutcherson's regular drummer Joe Chambers. The album was originally recorded in 1967 and first issued as catalog number GXF-3061 in Japan, in 1980. It was remastered and re- released on CD as a part of the Rudy Van Gelder Edition in 2005 with a different cover artwork. Oblique marks Hutcherson's second release in a quartet setting, his previous being Happenings from 1966. The personnel on Happenings are identical, save the replacement of Bob Cranshaw with Albert Stinson. == The pieces == Oblique differs from Hutcherson's previous sessions because there is less emphasis on his original compositions. He contributes three tunes to the date, all of which are of a more lyrical, subdued style. The one Hancock composition is of a more funky jazz-rock style, yet very laid back, likely due to the lack of horns. The set closes with two of Chambers' compositions, in his typically ominous and avant-garde manner. == Reception == Allmusic reviewer Steve Huey awarded four and a half stars to the album, saying: \"All the performances are spirited enough to make the sophisticated music sound winning and accessible as well, which means that Oblique is one of the better entries in Hutcherson's Blue Note discography and one worth tracking down.\" == Track listing == # \"'Til Then\" (Hutcherson) - 4:44 # \"My Joy\" (Hutcherson) - 7:10 # \"Theme from Blow Up\" (Hancock) - 8:13 # \"Subtle Neptune\" (Hutcherson) - 8:33 # \"Oblique\" (Chambers) - 7:18 # \"Bi-Sectional\" (Chambers) - 5:04 == Personnel == *Bobby Hutcherson - vibes *Herbie Hancock - piano *Albert Stinson - bass *Joe Chambers - drums == References == Category:1980 albums Category:Blue Note Records albums Category:Bobby Hutcherson albums Category:Post-bop albums Category:Albums produced by Alfred Lion Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio ",
