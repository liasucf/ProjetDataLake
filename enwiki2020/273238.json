    "text": "Adam Cadre (born February 5, 1974, in Silver Spring, Maryland) is an American writer active in a number of forms\u2014novels, screenplays, webcomics, essays\u2014but best known for his work in interactive fiction. ==Biography== Cadre's 1998 piece Photopia pioneered a new direction in interactive fiction, removing the puzzle and resource-management elements that had previously been dominant; it has been cited as \"hugely influential to IF development\" and \"important to video games as a whole, to the advancement of our understanding of the interactive medium.\" His next IF work, 1999's Varicella, won several XYZZY Awards and became the subject of academic study. His game 9:05 is commonly seen as a solid entry point for people wanting to engage with interactive fiction. Chief among his non-interactive work is a novel, Ready, Okay! (2000). ==Lyttle Lytton Contest== The Lyttle Lytton Contest, run by Adam Cadre, is a diminutive derivative of the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, and was first awarded in the year 2001. Both are tongue-in-cheek contests that take place annually and in which entrants are invited \"to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels.\" The Lyttle Lytton Contest varies from the Bulwer-Lytton in favoring shorter first sentences, initially limited to 25 words or fewer. For the 2008 competition, the maximum combined word count of an entrant's submission was increased to 30 words, and an individual entry could consist of multiple sentences. For 2011, the limit was raised to 33 words, and for 2012, a limit of 200 characters was established instead. ;Top winners *2019 \u2013 \"\u201cAre you okay?\u201d asks my sister Tlaloc. \u201cYou\u2019re as green as the parrots that inhabit this part of the continent.\u201d\" (Lachlan Redfern) *2018 \u2013 \"As I felt the vampire sexily drinking the blood from my neck, the warmth between my legs grew both in wetness and in fear for my life.\" (Cole Borsch) *2017 \u2013 \"1.
