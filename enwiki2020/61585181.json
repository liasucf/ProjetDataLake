    "text": "George Reed (7 February 1904 \u2013 29 November 1958) was an English football player and coach who played as a left half. Born in Altofts, Yorkshire, he began his professional career with nearby Leeds United in October 1924. He made his Football League debut on 6 April 1926, in a 2\u20130 home defeat to Sunderland. In the next three-and-a-half seasons, he missed just eight games, and in April 1930, he and teammate Harry Roberts shared a benefit match against Manchester United. He and Roberts both left for Plymouth Argyle at the end of the 1930\u201331 season, with Reed having appeared exactly 150 times for Leeds in all competitions, scoring three goals. Reed made his debut for Plymouth on 12 September 1931, in a 3\u20133 draw at home to Bradford City, and made a total of 48 appearances before leaving at the end of the 1933\u201334 season. His final appearance came on 26 December 1933, a 2\u20131 away defeat to Nottingham Forest. He then moved to Crystal Palace, where he also served as reserve team trainer, but managed just two appearances in his one season there before moving to Clapton Orient. He made one appearance for Orient, in April 1936, before joining non-league King's Lynn as player-manager for the 1936\u201337 season. After the Second World War, he returned to Plymouth as the club's assistant trainer. While running to change trains at Bristol after a scouting assignment at Coventry City on 29 November 1958, he suffered a heart attack and died. Reed's great-grandson is Wales international rugby union player Sam Warburton. ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1958 deaths Category:People from Altofts Category:English footballers Category:Association football wing halves Category:English Football League players Category:Leeds United F.C. players Category:Plymouth Argyle F.C. players Category:Crystal Palace F.C. players Category:Leyton Orient F.C. players ",
