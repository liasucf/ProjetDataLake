    "text": "Menke-Hennekam syndrome is a rare condition characterised by a constellation of lesions mostly involving the brain. ==Signs and symptoms== The feature of this condition include * Microcephaly * Ventriculomegaly * Absent corpus callosum * Autistic behavior * Feeding problems * Epilepsy * Variable intellectual disability * Staphyloma * Cochlear malformations * Mild hearing impairment * Exomphalos * Short stature * Recurrent upper airway infections ==Genetics== This condition has been associated with mutations in the CREB binding protein gene (CREBBP). This gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 16 (16p13.3). ==Pathopysiology== This is not understood. ==Diagnosis== This syndrome may be suspected on clinical grounds. The diagnosis is established by sequencing the CREBBP gene. ===Differential diagnosis=== *Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome ==Treatment== There is no specific treatment for this condition. Management is supportive. ==Epidemiology== This condition is considered to be rare with less than 20 cases reported in the literature. ==History== This condition was first described in 2019.Banka S, Sayer R, Breen C, Barton S, Pavaine J, Sheppard SE, Bedoukian E, Skraban C, Cuddapah VA, Clayton-Smith J (2019) Genotype-phenotype specificity in Menke- Hennekam syndrome caused by missense variants in exon 30 or 31 of CREBBP.
