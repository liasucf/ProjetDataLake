As the horses settled, Gronkowski moved through to challenge North America for the lead, with the leaders closely followed by Thunder Snow, Capezzano and New Trails. The positions at the front of the race remained unchanged until the final bend, where Capezzano and New Trails quickly faded. Into the home straight, North America started to drop back as Thunder Snow challenged Gronkowski for the lead. The two horses, now clear of the rest of the field, battled all the way to the line, with Thunder Snow getting up to win by a nose in a photo finish, becoming the first horse to win two Dubai World Cups. Gunnevera ran on from the back to take third place, with Pavel staying on to finish fourth. ===Full result=== Thunder Snow (left) defeating Gronkowski in a photo finish to win the 2019 Dubai World Cup. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- style=\"background:#DACAA5; text-align:center;\" | style=\"width:35px;\"| Position | style=\"width:45px;\"| Margin | style=\"width:160px;\"| Horse | style=\"width:160px;\"| Jockey | style=\"width:200px;\"| Trainer | style=\"width:80px;\"| Prize |- |1 | |Thunder Snow |Christophe Soumillon |Saeed bin Suroor |$7,200,000 |- |2 |nose |Gronkowski |Oisin Murphy |Salem bin Ghadayer |$2,400,000 |- |3 |2\u00be |Gunnevera |Emisael Jaramillo |Antonio Sano |$1,200,000 |- |4 |\u00bd |Pavel |Joel Rosario |Doug O'Neill |$600,000 |- |5 | |Audible |Flavien Prat |Todd Pletcher |$360,000 |- |6 |1\u00be |Yoshida |Jos\u00e9 Ortiz |Bill Mott |$240,000 |- |7 |2\u00bd |North America |Richard Mullen |Satish Seemar | |- |8 |head |Seeking The Soul |Mike E.
