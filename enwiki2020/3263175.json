In 1980 the European Union asked all of its member states to convert to the metric system, and in Ireland and the UK this process was originally to have been completed by 2009 with the UK still using imperial measurements https://www.rte.ie/archives/2017/0822/899135-imperial-measurements-retained/. Metrication succeeded in Ireland with the changeover fully completed in 2005 (with few exemptions such as the ongoing use of pints and acres). ==Metrication== During the First World War and after the Easter Rising, Charles A Stanuell, former President of the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland, published a paper advocating the use of the metric system and a decimal currency in the UK, of which Ireland was then a part. Metrication in Ireland began in the 1970s and by 2005 was almost completed; the only exception being that the imperial pint (568 ml) is still used in bars for reasons of tradition. The phrase a \"glass of beer\" is a colloquial expression for a half-pint (284 ml). All other places must sell liquids measured in millilitres and litres. Distance signs had displayed kilometres since the 1970s but road speed limits were in miles per hour until January 2005, when they were changed to kilometres per hour. Since 2005 all new cars sold in Ireland have speedometers that display only kilometres per hour; odometers generally became metric as well. The metric system is the only system taught in schools. Beginning in 1970, textbooks were changed to metric. Goods in shops are labelled in metric units. All of Ireland's railways still operate on imperial measurements. ==Continuation of supplementary Imperial units== In 2006 it became apparent that the 2009 cut-off for the use of Imperial supplementary units could cause problems in US-EU trade. After consultation, EU Directive 2009/3/EC of 11 March 2009, among other measures, permitted: * the indefinite use of Imperial supplementary indications. * the United Kingdom and Ireland to continue the limited exemptions concerning specified uses of the pint, mile and troy ounce, considering the absence of any impact of these exemptions on cross-border trade and the principle of subsidiarity; whilst repealing the exemption for the use of acres for land registration which is no longer applied. These amendments were published on 7 May 2009 and became effective on 1 January 2010. ==Horse racing== Horse racing in Ireland continues to use stones, pounds, miles and furlongs as measurements. http://www.hri-ras.ie/information-centre/hri-directives-and- rules/full/ ==References in Oireachtas debates== * That the Government be asked to appoint a Commission, with power to examine voluntary witnesses, to inquire into and report on the desirability or otherwise of adopting the Metric System in Saorst\u00e1t Eireann', * * * * * In the area of prepackaged goods the changeover is virtually complete, * * * ==See also== * Old Irish units of measurement * Irish measure ==Notes and references== Ireland Category:Economy of the Republic of Ireland Category:Irish units of measurement ",
