She lives in a village inhabited by various fairy-tale characters. The villagers are united in their fear of the forest and wolves. Other than Little Red Riding Hood, mother goat and her children, the three little pigs, the old farm dog, Sultan, and his son, Rex, live there. Everybody in the village professes to have had bad experiences with the wolves. The wolves live in the forest, which fascinates Little Red Riding Hood in spite of the stories. Eventually, her curiosity prevails and she goes into the woods where she meets Grimm the wolf. She finds out that he is not as frightening as his reputation suggests. Little Red Riding Hood is drawn to the hermit wolf, and they become friends. The wolf has only ever known Pig Wild (a wild boar) and Granny Owl. Pig Wild believes that a wolf and human cannot be friends, in spite of her own taboo love. Granny Owl supports the friendship of Grimm and Little Red Riding Hood. Moreover, she encourages her to bring him to the village to put an end to the rumors, unaware of the villagers' cruelty. The villagers are become defensive when Little Red Riding Hood brings Grimm to the village. The old yard dog, Sultan, the current mayor of the village, has dark secrets he wants to remain hidden. The Pig aspires to be mayor and plots against the wolf. == World premiere == Grimm! was premiered at the Children's Theater of Opera Graz (Next Liberty) on 7 December 2014.
