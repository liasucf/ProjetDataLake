    "text": "Elmer is a name of Germanic British origin. The given name originated as a surname, a medieval variant of the given name Aylmer, derived from Old English \u00e6\u00feel (noble) and m\u00e6r (famous). It was adopted as a given name in the United States, \"in honor of the popularity of the brothers Ebenezer and Jonathan Elmer, leading supporters of the American Revolution.\"Patrick Hanks and Flavia Hodges, A Dictionary of First Names (Oxford UP, 1990), p. 101. The name has fallen out of popular use in the last few decades and it is uncommon to find Elmers born after World War II.

All the Elmers, including the ham who took the most time and trouble to give you a push toward your license, are the birds who keep this great game young and fresh.\" *Elmer's Products, an American manufacturer of glue products ==Places== * Elmer, West Sussex, United Kingdom == See also == * == Notes == Category:Masculine given names Category:English masculine given names ",
