Each thinker within the Bhed\u0101bheda Ved\u0101nta tradition has their own particular understanding of the precise meanings of the philosophical terms \"difference\" and \"non-difference\". Bhed\u0101bheda Ved\u0101ntic ideas can be traced to some of the very oldest Ved\u0101ntic texts, including quite possibly B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a's Brahma S\u016btra (c. 4th century CE). Bhed\u0101bheda predates the positions of two other major schools of Ved\u0101nta. The Advaita (Non-dual) Ved\u0101nta that claims that the individual self is completely identical to Brahman, and the Dvaita (Dualist) Ved\u0101nta (13th century) that teaches complete difference between the individual self and Brahman. ==Influence== Bhed\u0101bheda ideas had an enormous influence on the devotional (bhakti) schools of India's medieval period. Among medieval Bhed\u0101bheda thinkers are: * Nimb\u0101rka (13th century), who founded the Sv\u0101bh\u0101bika Dvait\u0101dvaita school.Malkovsky, The Role of Divine Grace in the Soteriology of \u015aa\u1e43kar\u0101c\u0101rya, Leiden: Brill, p. 118, * Bh\u0101skara (8th and 9th centuries), who founded the Aup\u0101dhika Bhed\u0101bheda school. * Caitanya (1485-1533), the founder of Gaudiya Vaishnavism based in the eastern Indian State of West Bengal , and the theological founder of Achintya Bheda Abhedavedanta Other major names are R\u0101m\u0101nuja's teacher Y\u0101davaprak\u0101\u015ba, and Vij\u00f1\u0101nabhik\u1e63u (16th century). ==References== ==Sources== * ==Further reading== * * Complete English Translation of Sri Subodhini jee, published in Collected Works of Sri Vallabhcharya series, Sri Satguru Publications == External links == *Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Bhedabheda Category:Vedanta Category:Bhakti movement ",
