    "text": "Jelly fungi are a paraphyletic group of several heterobasidiomycete fungal orders from different classes of the subphylum Agaricomycotina: Tremellales, Dacrymycetales, Auriculariales and Sebacinales.J. Deacon. 2005 These fungi are so named because their foliose, irregularly branched fruiting body is, or appears to be, the consistency of jelly. Actually, many are somewhat rubbery and gelatinous. When dried, jelly fungi become hard and shriveled; when exposed to water, they return to their original form. A number of the jelly fungi can be eaten raw; poisonous jelly fungi are rare. However, many species have an unpalatable texture or taste. They may or may not be sought in mushroom hunting due to their taste, which is described as similar to that of soil. However, some species, Tremella fuciformis for example, are not only edible but prized for use in soup and vegetable dishes. ==Notable jelly fungi== *Ascocoryne sarcoides \u2013 jelly drops, purple jellydisc (often mistaken for basidiomycota but is not) *Auricularia auricula-judae \u2013 wood ear, Judas' ear *Auricularia polytricha \u2013 cloud ear *Calocera cornea *Calocera viscosa \u2013 yellow tuning fork, yellow stagshorn fungus *Dacrymyces palmatus \u2013 orange jelly *Dacryopinax spathularia *Exidia glandulosa \u2013 black jelly roll, witches' butter *Exidia recisa - amber jelly roll, willow brain *Guepiniopsis alpina \u2013 golden jelly cone *Phlogiotis helvelloides \u2013 apricot jelly *Myxarium nucleatum \u2013 crystal brain, granular jelly roll *Pseudohydnum gelatinosum \u2013 jelly tooth, jelly tongue *Tremella foliacea \u2013 jelly leaf *Tremella fuciformis \u2013 snow fungus *Tremella mesentericaC.
