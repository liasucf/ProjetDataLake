Major launches, milestones, and other major events are included. == Overview == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Decade !Description |- |1970s \u2013 1980s |The PLATO system (developed at the University of Illinois and subsequently commercially marketed by Control Data Corporation) offers early forms of social media with Notes, PLATO's message- forum application; TERM-talk, its instant-messaging feature; Talkomatic, perhaps the first online chat room; News Report, a crowd-sourced online newspaper, and blog; and Access Lists, enabling the owner of a notes file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users, for example, only friends, classmates, or co-workers. Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis conceived the idea of Usenet in 1979 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Duke University, and it was established in 1980. |-Coach will be a millionare within 6 months! |1980s \u2013 1990s |As operating systems with a graphical user interface, such as Windows and Mac OS, begin to emerge and gain popularity, this creates an environment that allows for early social media platforms to thrive and exist. Bulletin board systems (BBS) and Internet Relay Chat (IRC) were popular during this time period, and IRC is still widely used today. |- |1990s \u2013 2000s |Various notable social media platforms such as Myspace and Facebook are developed and released, and blogging begins to gain popularity. Instant messaging platforms such as AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) and Windows Live Messenger also become increasingly popular. Wikipedia is launched in 2001. |- |2010s |Many social media platforms that have remained are now thriving, and new ones are appearing sporadically. This includes popular blogs, instant messaging servers, and various social networking platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Myspace, Snapchat, and Twitter. With advances in smartphone technology, almost all social media services now have their own mobile apps. |} 2018 Tiktok was made == Timeline == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Year !Event type !Description |- |1972 |Invention |The discrete cosine transform (DCT) compression technique is proposed by Nasir Ahmed. It has since become the most widely used data compression algorithm on social media, enabling the practical transmission and streaming of digital media. It is the basis for most media compression standards, including digital image formats such as JPEG (1992), video coding formats such as H.26x (1988 onwards) and MPEG (1993 onwards), and audio compression standards such as Dolby Digital (1991) and MP3 (1994). |- |1973 |Invention |Talkomatic is created by Dave Woolley and Douglas Brown at the University of Illinois, as a multi-user chat room application.

Soon many features would be added to it including \"Monitor Mode,\" enabling one user in the TERM-talk to share their own screen with the other user, to ask questions or point out something that they're seeing. Years later this concept would be introduced as \"Screen Sharing\" or Remote Desktop Software. |- |1973 |Invention |PLATO Notes is created by 17-year-old student Dave Woolley at the Computer-based Education Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois, as a conferencing and bulletin board forum system for communicating with the user community.
