    "text": "MLB Showdown (colloq. Showdown) is an out-of-print collectible card game made by Wizards of the Coast that ran from April 2000 to 2005. The game was introduced to the public in 2000, featuring Atlanta Braves third baseman Chipper Jones on the product cover. Since the 2000 base set, cover athletes have included Shawn Green, Gary Sheffield, Manny Ram\u00edrez, Luis Gonzalez, Torii Hunter, Albert Pujols, and Craig Biggio. ==Gameplay== Original MLB Showdown Logo MLB Showdown simulates baseball through a card game, with heavy randomness. It involves a 20-sided die and cards made specifically for the game. These cards were available in booster packs, a staple of collectible card games, as well as starter games and draft packs. There are two types of cards: player cards (current and former Major League players) and strategy cards (actions that can add to or subtract from dice rolls, change results, draw extra cards, etc.) The outcome of an at-bat largely depends on the player cards. The player whose pitcher is pitching that turn rolls a die to determine whether the batting player rolls on the pitcher's chart or the batter's chart. Each of the two charts has a list of possible results from the at-bat. ==Organized play== The organized play was set into three levels: local leagues, regionals, and the national championship. The MLB Showdown card game has had four national champions: Scott Forster (2001), Gary Quinn (2002), Keith Pioro (2003), and Terry Dugan (2004). For the 2005 season, the national championship was set as a different format than it was previously because of changes in organized play. Eight players were regional champions only and won the grand prize of MLB season tickets to the team of his/her choice. However, Wizards of the Coast eventually approved a national championship in Houston, Texas. Prizes were reduced to merely autographed memorabilia sent in from Wizards of the Coast. Four players, Stephen Mendel, Ben Taylor, Jonathan Rosen, and Daniel Rosen split the tournament and were named national champions of the 2005 season. There was no formal organized play since Showdown was discontinued by Wizards of the Coast in January 2006 until May 20, 2013. On this day play began for the 2013 national championship in Williamsville, NY.http://www.showdowncards.com/forums ==Sets== {| class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
