Ensan was born in Iran and moved to Germany at the age of 25, in 1999. There, he studied civil engineering at the University of Munster. But being unable to pay his bills, especially at the time he was founding a family, he could not go all the way to obtain his diploma. He started working small jobs, such as a taxi driver, waiter, and painter. He then managed to start a taxi business in 2002, buying three cars, and had enough time to start his poker career. This was quite a late start, Ensan being 39 at that time. However he declared that he knew the rules of poker since he played five-card draw when he was a kid. In August 2014, Ensan won the seniors event at the European Poker Tour's Barcelona festival, then a week later he finished third out of 1,496 players in the Main Event for \u20ac652,000. He also made the final table at EPT Malta in March 2015, finishing in sixth. Finally, he made his third EPT final table in Prague that December and won the tournament for \u20ac754,000. Ensan won a WSOP circuit ring in Rozvadov, Czech Republic in 2017. He had just one WSOP cash prior to the 2019 Main Event, in the Colossus event at the WSOP Europe in 2017. At the 2019 Main Event, Ensan entered the final table with the chip lead at 177,000,000, more than a third of the chips in play. On the 301st hand of the final table, he defeated Dario Sammartino heads-up with against the of Sammartino. His opponent check-raised all in on a board and Ensan quickly called. Sammartino, a high roller regular and one of the best poker players in the world, said that Ensan played better during the heads-up. At age 55, Ensan became the oldest Main Event champion since Noel Furlong in 1999 and the second German champion after Pius Heinz in 2011. As of January 2020, Ensan's total live earnings exceed $13,000,000. ==World Series of Poker bracelets== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Tournament !Prize (US$) |- |2019 |$10,000 No Limit Hold'em Main Event |$10,000,000 |} ==Biggest scores== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Date !Tournament !Buy in !Ranking !Prize |- |03-07-2019 |WSOP Main Event |$10,000 |1/8,569 |$10,000,000 |- |16-12-2017 |PokerStars Championship Prague HR |\u20ac10,300 |3/256 |\u20ac242,000 |- |13-10-2017 |WSOP Circuit Rozvadov Main Event |\u20ac1,650 |1/672 |\u20ac184,812 |- |10-12-2015 |EPT Prague Main Event |\u20ac5,300 |1/1,044 |\u20ac754,510 |- |12-09-2015 |Rotterdam Series \u20ac550 Deep Stack |\u20ac550 |1/ ? |\u20ac12,057 |- |06-05-2015 |EPT Monte Carlo \u20ac330 Turbo |\u20ac330 |1/93 |\u20ac3,650 |- |04-05-2015 |EPT Monte Carlo \u20ac2,200 NLHE |\u20ac2,200 |1/263 |\u20ac87,043 |- |22-03-2015 |EPT Malta Main Event |\u20ac5,300 |6/895 |\u20ac153,700 |- |21-02-2015 |Eureka Rozvadov Main Event |\u20ac1,100 |8/664 |\u20ac12,770 |- |21-08-2014 |EPT Barcelona Main Event |\u20ac5,300 |3/1,496 |\u20ac652,667 |- |16-08-2014 |ESPT Barcelona Seniors Event |\u20ac220 |1/85 |\u20ac4,535 |- |19-04-2013 |EPT Berlin \u20ac330 NLHE |\u20ac330 |8/555 |\u20ac3,500 |} ==References== ==External links== *Hendon Mob profile *WSOP.com profile Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:German poker players Category:Iranian poker players Category:World Series of Poker Main Event winners Category:World Series of Poker bracelet winners Category:World Series of Poker Circuit event winners Category:European Poker Tour winners Category:People from M\u00fcnster Category:Iranian people Category:German people of Iranian descent Category:German taxicab drivers Category:Iranian taxicab drivers ",
