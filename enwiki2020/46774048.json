    "text": "Hitaveita Su\u00f0urnesja was an Icelandic energy company. The largest shareholder was Reykjanesb\u00e6r. The company was founded as a geothermal energy firm in the southwest of Iceland in 1974. It built a power plant at Svartsengi to tap the geothermal energy in the area, and was completed in 1976. It was reportedly the first power plant in the world of its kind. It produced and distributed heating and electricity for the entire Sudurnes region. In May 2008, Parliament passed Act no. 58/2008, amending some laws on natural resources and energy. As a result, Hitaveita Su\u00f0urnesja was divided into two independent companies, HS Utilities Ltd., distributing electricity, and HS Orka, heating and freshwater, which came into effect on July 1, 2008. ==References== Category:Energy companies of Iceland Category:Energy companies established in 1974 Category:1974 establishments in Iceland Category:2008 disestablishments in Iceland Category:Geothermal energy in Iceland Category:Energy companies disestablished in 2008 ",
