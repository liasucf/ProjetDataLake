Wraxall in his Memoir described Montagu's upbringing by his aunt: \"At her feet he was brought up, a school more adapted to form a man of taste and improvement than a statesman or a man of the world\".Wraxall's Memoirs, edited by Wheatley, iv. 377-9 (via: The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1790\u20131820, edited by R.
