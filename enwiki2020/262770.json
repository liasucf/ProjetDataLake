    "text": "The Tango Lesson () is a 1997 drama film written and directed by Sally Potter. It is a semi-autobiographical film starring Potter and Pablo Ver\u00f3n, about Argentinian Tango.. The film, a co-production of Argentina, France, Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom, was produced by Christopher Sheppard in Britain and Oscar Kramer in Argentina, and was shot mostly in black and white in Paris and Buenos Aires. The soundtrack includes original recordings of Carlos Gardel's Mi Buenos Aires querido and \u00c1stor Piazzolla's Libertango, two of the most iconic tangos in the history of the genre. It also includes an original song written and sung by Potter. ==Synopsis== Sally, a filmmaker and screenwriter suffering from writer's block, is dissatisfied with her film project, a murder mystery called Rage, which features the fashion industry. Taking a break, she travels to Paris, where she sees the dancer Pablo (Pablo Ver\u00f3n) performing tango. She becomes obsessed with the dance and offers Pablo a part in her film in exchange for dance lessons. The two become deeply involved as dancers and as lovers. Their emotional intimacy threatens the success of their dancing together. The film explores the conflict between the woman dancer accepting the man's lead in the dance, while the man must accept the woman's lead in the film. It is a love story and a showcase for Ver\u00f3n's dancing. ==Cast== * Sally Potter as Sally * Pablo Ver\u00f3n as Pablo * Morgane Maugran as Red Model * G\u00e9raldine Maillet as Yellow Model * Katerina Mechera as Blue Model * David Toole as Fashion Designer * George Yiasoumi as Photographer * Michele Parent as Seamstress * Claudine Mavros as Seamstress * Monique Couturier as Seamstress * Matthew Hawkins as Bodyguard * Simon Worgan as Bodyguard * Carolina Iotti as Pablo's partner * Zobeida as Pablo's Friend * Orazio Massaro as Pablo's Friend * Gustavo Naveira as Gustavo * Fabian Salas as Fabian * Carlos Copello as Carlos * Mar\u00eda Noel as Film Executive * Gregory Dayton as Film Executive ==Distribution== The film was first presented at the Venice Film Festival in Italy on 29 August 1997.

The lessons are numbered and > cataloged with an obsessive care like that of Peter Greenaway, but this > material has little of his corresponding complexity.\" Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert discussed in his review the film's major goal, writing, \"Most dances are for people who are falling in love. The tango is a dance for those who have survived it, and are still a little angry about having their hearts so mishandled. The Tango Lesson is a movie for people who understand that difference.\"Ebert, Roger. Chicago Sun-Times, film review, 19 December 1997. Last accessed: 18 January 2008. Edward Guthmann, San Francisco Chronicle staff critic, lauded the film and the courage of director Potter, and wrote, > \"British director Sally Potter stuck her neck out when she made The Tango > Lesson, a fictionalized account of her relationship with Argentine tango > master Pablo Veron...Potter takes what seemed like a recipe for > embarrassment and excess and delivers a film that's sweet and understated > and devoid of diva posturing...[the film is] smoothly directed, nicely > written and falters only in the performance that Potter was able to squeeze > out of herself while performing her multiple tasks.\" Yet, Guthmann says Potter should have cast another actor in her role. He adds, > \"It's too bad, then, that Potter couldn't have figured out a way to use > another actress to play herself. She often looks worn out, which makes sense > given her offscreen responsibilities but works against her tale of > courtship, infatuation and the emotional sparks that fly between two gifted, > bullheaded artists.\" ==Awards== ;Wins * Mar del Plata Film Festival: Best Film, Sally Potter; 1997. * National Board of Review: Special Recognition, for excellence in filmmaking; 1997. * American Choreography Awards: American Choreography Award Outstanding Achievement in Feature Film, Pablo Ver\u00f3n; 1998. ;Nominations * British Academy of Film and Television Arts: BAFTA Film Award; Best Film not in the English Language; 1998. ==References== ==External links== * Official Web-site * * La lecci\u00f3n de tango at the cinenacional.com * Category:1997 films Category:Argentine films Category:Argentine black-and-white films Category:British black-and-white films Category:Dutch black-and-white films Category:German black-and-white films Category:British films Category:Dutch films Category:Films directed by Sally Potter Category:French films Category:German films Category:1997 romantic drama films Category:Tango films Category:British romantic drama films Category:Films set in Buenos Aires Category:Films shot in Buenos Aires Category:1997 drama films ",
