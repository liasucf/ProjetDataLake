Helsingin Jalkapalloklubi were the defending champions.http://www.veikkausliiga.com/tilastot/2018/veikkausliiga/joukkueet/ ==New league format== Veikkausliiga adopted a new league format for the 2019 season. Each team played against each other twice in the regular season. After the regular season the top six teams advanced to the Championship Series which determines the champion and European tournament qualification places. The bottom six teams advanced to the Challenger Series. The best team from the Challenger Series plays in a tournament against the Championship Series' 4th, 5th, and 6th place teams. The winner from that plays in a final series against the 3rd best team from the Championship Series. The last UEFA Europa League qualification place goes to the winner of that final series. The bottom team from the Challenger Series will relegate to the Ykk\u00f6nen, and second to last team will play in a relegation play-off series against the 2nd best team from Ykk\u00f6nen. ==Teams== Palloseura Kemi Kings were relegated to Ykk\u00f6nen after finishing at the bottom of the 2018 season. Their place was taken by Ykk\u00f6nen champions HIFK Fotboll. Turun Palloseura as 11th-placed team lost their Veikkausliiga spot after losing to second-placed Ykk\u00f6nen team Kokkolan Palloveikot in a relegation/promotion playoff. ===Stadia and locations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Club !Location !Stadium !Turf !Capacity |- |FC Honka |Espoo |Tapiolan Urheilupuisto |Natural |6,000 |- |Inter Turku |Turku |Veritas Stadion |Natural |10,000 |- |FC Lahti |Lahti |Lahden Stadion |Natural |15,000 |- |HIFK |Helsinki |Telia 5G -areena |Artificial |10,770 |- |HJK |Helsinki |Telia 5G -areena |Artificial |10,770 |- |IFK Mariehamn |Mariehamn |Wikl\u00f6f Holding Arena |Natural |4,000 |- |Ilves |Tampere |Tammelan Stadion |Natural |5,040 |- |KPV |Kokkola |Kokkolan Keskuskentt\u00e4 |Natural |2,000 |- |KuPS |Kuopio |Savon Sanomat Areena |Artificial |5,000 |- |RoPS |Rovaniemi |Rovaniemen keskuskentt\u00e4 |Artificial |4,000 |- |SJK |Sein\u00e4joki |OmaSP Stadion |Artificial |6,000 |- |VPS |Vaasa |Elisa Stadion |Artificial |6,000 |} ==League table== ===Regular season=== ====Results==== === European competition === Five teams will play for a spot in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round. ====Bracket==== ====Final stage==== ===Relegation play-offs=== ==Season statistics== ===Top scorers=== Final standings {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Rank !Player !Club !Goals |- |rowspan=1|1 |align=\"left\"| Filip Valen\u010di\u010d |align=\"left\"|Inter Turku |rowspan=1|16 |- |rowspan=2|2 |align=\"left\"| Lauri Ala-Myllym\u00e4ki |align=\"left\"|Ilves |rowspan=2|12 |- |align=\"left\"| Borjas Mart\u00edn |align=\"left\"|Honka |- |rowspan=2|4 |align=\"left\"| Timo Furuholm |align=\"left\"|Inter Turku |rowspan=2|10 |- |align=\"left\"| Tiquinho |align=\"left\"|HIFK |- |rowspan=3|6 |align=\"left\"| Lu\u00eds Henrique |align=\"left\"|HIFK |rowspan=3|8 |- |align=\"left\"| Denys Oliynyk |align=\"left\"|SJK |- |align=\"left\"| Lucas Rangel |align=\"left\"|KuPS |- |} ==References== Category:Veikkausliiga seasons Vei Fin Fin ",
