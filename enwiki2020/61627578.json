    "text": "Einar Otto Wallin (born 21 November 1990) is a Swedish professional boxer. He held the WBA Continental heavyweight title in 2017 and won the EBU European Union heavyweight title in 2018. ==Amateur career== Wallin comes from a working-class family. His father and one of his brothers boxed, and he began boxing when he was 15. As an amateur, he won the Swedish championship for beginners in 2008. There were few heavyweights available to fight in Sweden, where professional boxing was banned until 2007, so Wallin would often fight whoever and whenever in order to stay active. In 2009, Wallin won a bronze medal at the Swedish Youth National Championships in the heavyweight division, and won the Ruska Tournament in the super-heavyweight division. In 2010, Wallin won silver at the Swedish National Championships, and silver at the Haringey Box Cup, losing to Anthony Joshua on points in the final. He also won silver at the 2010 Ruska Tournament. Wallin lost to Joshua on points again in a Sweden\u2013England dual match in Stockholm in January 2011. He then won bronze at the Swedish National Championships in February,http://amateur- boxing.strefa.pl/Nationalchamps/Sweden2011.pdf silver at the Nordic Championships in March,http://amateur- boxing.strefa.pl/Championships/Scandinavian_Championships2011.pdf gold at the Algirdas Socikas Tournament in May,http://amateur- boxing.strefa.pl/Tournaments/KaunasTournament_Szocikas2011.pdf gold at the Haringey Box Cup in June,http://amateur- boxing.strefa.pl/Tournaments/Haringey2011.pdf and gold at the Riga Open Tournament in December. In January 2012, Wallin defeated Frazer Clarke 32:11 in a Sweden\u2013England dual match in Uppsala, which qualified him for the 2012 European Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament. Wallin won bronze at the Gee-Bee Tournament in March, losing to Magomed Omarov in the semi-finals. At the European Boxing Olympic Qualification Tournament in April in Trabzon, Turkey, he was eliminated in the round of 16 by Mihai Nistor. Wallin finished with an amateur record of 34\u201312. ==Professional career== Wallin turned professional at the age of 22, in 2013. He trained under Torsten Schmitz for six months in Berlin, Germany, then moved to Copenhagen, Denmark, where he met former two-weight WBA world champion Joey Gamache, who became his trainer. Wallin followed Gamache to New York after Gamache left Denmark. After racking up a 19\u20130 record and winning the WBA Continental heavyweight title, Wallin defeated Adrian Granat (15\u20131, 14 KOs) to win the vacant Swedish and EBU European Union heavyweight titles in April 2018. Wallin won by unanimous decision 117\u2013111, 117\u2013112, and 118\u2013110. As a tall southpaw, he has also been a sparring partner for Anthony Joshua, Jarrell Miller and Adam Kownacki. Wallin then made his United States debut against Nick Kisner (21\u20134\u20131, 6 KOs) in April 2019, but the fight ended in a no contest after an accidental clash of heads opened a cut above Kisner's eye in the first round. He was set to fight BJ Flores (34\u20134\u20131, 21 KOs) in July, but Flores was ruled medically unfit to fight on the day of the scheduled bout. On 14 September 2019, Wallin faced the former unified heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury (28\u20130\u20131, 20 KOs) at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Wallin lost the fight by unanimous decision, with the scorecards reading 116\u2013112, 117\u2013111, and 118\u2013110. He opened up a large cut above Fury's right eye in the third round with a left hand, which affected Fury's vision for the rest of the fight. A ringside doctor examined the cut in the sixth and deemed Fury able to continue. The examination by the doctor seemed to motivate Fury, as he poured on the pressure afterwards, hurting Wallin repeatedly with solid shots. Despite fatiguing in the second half of the fight, Wallin came back in the twelfth and landed a strong left hand which seemed to trouble Fury. Commentators stated Wallin's performance had defied the odds despite the loss, as he came in as an over 10 to 1 underdog. Wallin was set to make his return to the ring against former WBA (Regular) heavyweight world champion Lucas Browne (29-2, 25 KOs) on 28 March 2020 at the Park Theater at the Park MGM in Las Vegas. The fight was scheduled for 10 rounds. On 26 February, Wallin was removed from the card due to a foot injury and was replaced by Apti Davtaev. He instead made his return against Travis Kauffman on 15 August 2020. Wallin dominated the fight, and Kauffman retired in the fifth round due to injury. == Personal life == Wallin was born in Sundsvall, Sweden, but has lived in New York City since 2017. Wallin's father died of a sudden heart attack shortly before the announcement of Wallin's fight with Tyson Fury. Wallin said his father, an amateur boxer and part-time trainer, motivated him to get into boxing, and hoped to use his father's death as extra motivation to upset the odds and defeat Fury, similar to Buster Douglas losing his mother before fighting Mike Tyson. Despite ultimately losing the bout, Wallin's performance was praised. Fury said in his in-ring interview, \"Big congratulations to Otto and I just wanna say rest in peace to his father. I know he would be very, very proud of his performance.\" ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |23 |Win |21\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Travis Kauffman |TKO |5 (10), |15 Aug 2020 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |22 |Loss |20\u20131 (1) |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Tyson Fury |UD |12 |14 Sep 2019 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |21 |style=\"background:#DDD\"| |20\u20130 (1) |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Nick Kisner |NC |1 (10), |13 Apr 2019 |align=left| |align=left| |- |20 |Win |20\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Adrian Granat |UD |12 |21 Apr 2018 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |19 |Win |19\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Srdan Govedarica |KO |3 (8), |27 Jan 2018 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |18 |Win |18\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Gianluca Mandras |TKO |5 (10), |22 Apr 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |17 |Win |17\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Raphael Zumbano |UD |10 |3 Dec 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |16 |Win |16\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Osborne Machimana |UD |8 |10 Sep 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |15 |Win |15\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Irineu Beato Costa Junior |TKO |3 (8), |23 Apr 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |14 |Win |14\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Samir Kurtagic |UD |6 |19 Dec 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |13 |Win |13\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Vladimir Goncharov |UD |6 |19 Sep 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |12 |Win |12\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oleksiy Mazikin |KO |2 (8), |20 Jun 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |11 |Win |11\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Beka Lobjanidze |KO |4 (8), |2 May 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |10 |Win |10\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| David Gegeshidze |TKO |2 (8), |14 Mar 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |9 |Win |9\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ivica Perkovic |RTD |4 (8), |6 Dec 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |8 |Win |8\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Vjekoslav Bajic |TKO |2 (8) |29 Nov 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |7 |Win |7\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Maksym Pedyura |TKO |4 (6), |30 Aug 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ladislav Kovarik |TKO |4 (4), |15 Feb 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ferenc Zsalek |PTS |4 |25 Jan 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Tomas Mrazek |PTS |4 |23 Nov 2013 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Gabor Farkas |TKO |3 (4), |26 Oct 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Valeri Semiskur |TKO |2 (4), |7 Sep 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Roman Cherney |TKO |1 (4), |15 Jun 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |} == References == == External links == * Category:Swedish male boxers Category:World Boxing Association champions Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:Southpaw boxers Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sundsvall Category:Swedish expatriate sportspeople in the United States ",
