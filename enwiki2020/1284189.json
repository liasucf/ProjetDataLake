A Criollo and an ilustrado who went to school in France, Varela published a series of books advocating social change in the Spanish Philippines, inspired by the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. His most important work is El P\u00e1rnaso Filipino, published in Sampaloc, Manila in 1814.Pedro Ortiz Armengol. Letras Filipinas . Publicado por Ministerio de AA.EE., 1999 He advocated the opening of local colleges to teach subjects such as mathematics, medicine, and navigation, as well as free primary schools for the poor. Varela also believed that foreign powers held too much influence over the local economy, and he accordingly worked to limit Chinese intrusion in the region by bolstering the local business associations.Putzel, James (2001).
