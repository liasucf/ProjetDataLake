In November 2011 the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention adopted the opinion that the detention was disproportional and breached human rights conventions. Kamaruzzaman, along with nine other senior members from Jamaat-e-Islami, was charged on seven counts of crimes against humanity during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, including genocide, killing, rape, looting, arson and deportation of unarmed civilians.

Kamaruzzaman denied the charges saying the trial was politically motivated and appealed the verdict in the supreme court. During the trial, Kamaruzzman had outbursts of anger and commented: \"There is no instance in history that a higher secondary student has been tried for crimes against humanity.\" The court upheld the death sentence on the charge of the Shohagpur genocide. He filed a review petition which was dismissed by the appellate division of the supreme court. Kamaruzzaman was executed on 11 April 2015 in Dhaka Central jail. ==Controversies== Though the government and ICT have stated that justice was the priority, opposition parties Jamaat-e-Islami and the BNP accused the prime minister Sheikh Hasina of using the tribunal to persecute them. Human Rights Watch called the trial \"seriously flawed\". === 2012 Skype controversy === In December 2012, conversations and emails between the judge and a Brussels-based lawyer were published, which according to The Economist revealed that the government wanted a quick verdict from the International Crimes Tribunal. In response, an application was submitted on behalf of Kamaruzzaman for a retrial, which was rejected. Following the revelations, the controversial chief Justice Nizamul Huq resigned from the post and Fazle Kabir was appointed there. ==See also== * Abdul Kader Mollah * Delwar Hossain Sayidee * Golam Azam * List of Bangladeshi criminals ==References== Category:Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami politicians Category:1952 births Category:Bangladeshi people convicted of crimes against humanity Category:Bangladeshi people convicted of war crimes Category:Razakar Category:21st-century executions by Bangladesh Category:Executed Bangladeshi people Category:People from Sherpur District Category:2015 deaths Category:People executed for war crimes Category:People executed for crimes against humanity Category:Bangladeshi politicians convicted of crimes ",
