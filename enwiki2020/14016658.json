    "text": "Led Zeppelin's 1973 European Tour was a concert tour of Europe by the English rock band. The tour commenced on 2 March and concluded on 2 April 1973. This tour began just four weeks after Led Zeppelin's previous tour of the United Kingdom. It is notable for the crowd violence which occurred at some shows, with concerts at Marseille and Lille being canceled as a result of riots by fans which had taken place at the band's earlier performances in France.Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press. , p. 88.
