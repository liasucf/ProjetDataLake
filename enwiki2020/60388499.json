The monument, installed in 1996, consists of three blindfolded individual men, walking forward in a radially divergent and centrifugal directions. Each is holding what is described as an oil lantern. At their feet are symbols of a sun, moon, and star. The complex does not appear to allude directly to any historical event, but appears to be a cryptic symbol of the human condition: blindfolded men holding a lamp, striding in divergent directions. Some claim that there may be an allusion to Diogenes, walking in the daylight with a lamp, searching for an honest man.Discover Pistoia, entry on statuary group. ==References== Category:Monuments and memorials in Tuscany Category:Buildings and structures in Pistoia Category:1996 sculptures ",
