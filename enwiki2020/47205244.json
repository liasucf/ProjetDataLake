    "text": "Walt\u00e9rcio Caldas J\u00fanior (born 6 November 1946), also known as Walt\u00e9rcio Caldas, is a Brazilian sculptor, designer, and graphic artist. Caldas is best known as part of Brazil's Neo-Concretism movement as well as for his eclectic choices in materials. == Early life and education == Caldas was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the son of Diva Caldas (n\u00e9e Fialho) and Waltercio Caldas, a civil engineer. Due to his father's occupation, Caldas has stated that from a young age he was surrounded by drawings and scale models. In the early sixties, Caldas had his first amateur exhibition showing at the Student\u2019s Council of the Philosophy Course at Rio de Janeiro State University. And in 1964, Caldas began studying under Ivan Serpa at the Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro. == Career == === Early work (1960s \u2013 1980s) === Caldas completed his first graphic project in 1965 and in the late 1960s first started experimenting with perception and enigmatic sculptures. In the early seventies, Caldas also started creating drawings and box object such as The Seven Stars of Silence (1970), Centre of Primitive Reason (1970), and You are Blind (1972) which drew critical acclaim including from Gilberto Chateaubriand. In 1973, Caldas exhibited his first solo show at the Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro which he was widely commended for. Writer, Ronaldo Brito wrote about the exhibition and commented that Caldas' work encouraged the viewer to not just look at the art, but contemplate it as well as it evoked a moment of \"psychic bewilderment\" in the viewer. Also at this time, Caldas edited Malasartes, a short-lived magazine that became a landmark in the Brazilian artistic scene and taught \"Art and Visual Perception\" at the Villa- Lobos Institute. In the 1980s, Caldas started to create more facilities in his work. Caldas moved to New York in 1985 where he experimented with non- transparent sculpture material. Caldas then returned to Brazil the following year where he showed two shows simultaneously in both Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo that paralleled each other and emphasized the idea of \"double intrinsic.\" In 1989, Caldas installed its first public sculpture: The Instant Garden in Carmo Park, S\u00e3o Paulo. === Later work (1990s \u2013 present) === In 1990, Caldas exhibited his first solo show in Europe, drawings at the Pulitzer Gallery in Amsterdam. Caldas then completed his second public commission sculpture, Omkring (Around), in 1994, which is now on permanent display in Leirfjord, Norway. The sculpture was classified as \"line articulation\" and commended for countering lightness with tension. ==Recognition== In 1990, Caldas was awarded the Brasilia Art Award at the Brasilia Museum of Art which also led to the museum incorporating pieces from Caldas into its collection. In 1993, Caldas' solo show, The Finest Air, was exhibited at the Fine Arts National Museum in Rio de Janeiro, which was awarded the Mario Pedrosa Award and named the Best Show of the Year in Brazil by the Brazilian Art Critics\u2019 Association. In 1998, Caldas was named a Johnnie Walker Award recipient and presented a sculpture to be permanently displayed at the Museu de Arte Moderna da Bahia. ==Personal life== Caldas is married to Patricia Vasconcellos and currently lives and works in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ==Exhibitions== Caldas has had solo exhibitions across North America, South American, and Europe.
