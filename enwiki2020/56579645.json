Her mother was Bavarian and her father was a naturalized British subject. In 1920 Osborne had her first photographic exhibition in Copenhagen. Between 1922 and 1924 she operated a portrait studio in Baden-Baden and in 1925 she located the studio to Giselastra\u00dfe 1, in Munich. In this time she also made theater-photography. In 1925 Osborne became a member of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Lichtbildner, Society of German Photographers. Her portrait subjects included Jean Arp, Albert Schweitzer and a production of King Lear in a style tinged with expressionism.Sir Rabindranath Tagore, by Li Osborne, In 1934 Osborne sold her studio and emigrated to Switzerland. During World War II, in Zurich, she began to teach herself sculpture. Although largely self-taught as a sculptor, she received advice from many internationally known artists, while living in Switzerland. In 1945 Osborne moved to East Bergholt in England and dedicated her time to sculpture. Her sculptures were based on figuration and expressiveness and she often left traces of her working of the material in the finished piece, in contrast to the smooth abstract work of others. In 1953 and 1956 works by her were shown at the Beaux-Arts Gallery, London. In 1953 she was one of the twelve British artists included in the international competition for the monument to the Unknown Political Prisoner Competition. Her sculpture subjects included Sandor Vegh, Herbert Read, Helen Lessore and the artists Bernard Leach, Patrick Heron and Mary Fedden. Her sculpture Three- fold Head is in the Tate collection.
