The station opened on April 22, 2016, along with the rest of the A Line. 38th & Blake station is planned to be the centerpiece to a new, transit-oriented neighborhood that would replace existing industrial buildings with mixed-use buildings for residences, offices and retail. It is also proposed as the northern terminus of the L Line, created by extending the existing terminus north from 30th & Downing station along Downing Street. ==References== Category:RTD commuter rail stations in Denver Category:2016 establishments in Colorado Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 2016 ",
