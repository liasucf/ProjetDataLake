They finished the season 24\u201312, 12\u20136 in Pac-12 play to finish in second place. As the No. 2 seed in the Pac-12 Tournament, they defeated Oregon State in the quarterfinals and Oregon in the semifinals before losing to Arizona in the championship game.

They received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament where they defeated Providence in the First Four and SMU in the First Round before losing in the Second Round to Baylor. ==FBI investigation== On September 26, federal prosecutors in New York announced charges of fraud and corruption against 10 people involved in college basketball, including USC assistant coach Tony Bland. The charges allege that Bland and others allegedly received benefits from financial advisers and others to influence student- athletes to retain their services. Following the announcement, USC placed Bland on administrative leave and announced that it would conduct an internal investigation of the matter. Potential 2018 NBA Draft pick De'Anthony Melton would be indefinitely suspended in relation to the scandal in January before leaving USC on February 21, 2018. ==Off-season== ===Departures=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%;\" border=\"1\" !
