    "text": "The adipokines, or adipocytokines (Greek adipo-, fat; cytos-, cell; and -kinos, movement) are cytokines (cell signaling proteins) secreted by adipose tissue. The first adipokine to be discovered was leptin in 1994. Since that time, hundreds of adipokines have been discovered. Members include: * Leptin * Adiponectin * ApelinGuo L, Li Q, Wang W, Yu P, Pan H, Li P, Sun Y, Zhang J. Endocr Res. 2009;34(4):142-54. * chemerinMacDougald1, Ormond A. and Burant, Charles F.
