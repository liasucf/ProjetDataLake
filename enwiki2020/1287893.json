    "text": "Coldstream is a closed railway station, located in Station Street, Coldstream, Victoria, Australia, on the now-closed Healesville greater-metropolitan line. The station buildings were destroyed by fire in the late 1990s. The track from Coldstream to Yarra Glen was formerly leased by the Yarra Valley Tourist Railway, who discontinued their lease due to the poor condition of bridges along the line. An old platform in poor condition remains at the former station. Until 1992, freight trains ran to Coldstream to service the fertilizer factory adjacent to the former station. In 2019, The Daylesford Spa Country Railway removed the turnouts from Coldstream for use at Bullarto by the railway.
