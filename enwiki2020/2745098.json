    "text": "Scene from Faust Die Schachspieler (The Chess Players) Friedrich August Moritz Retzsch (December 9, 1779 - June 11, 1857) was a German painter, draughtsman, and etcher. Retzsch was born in the Saxon capital Dresden. He joined the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts in 1798 under Cajetan Toscani and J\u00f3zef Grassi, later working autodidactically, copying the famous pictures of the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, among them a copy of the Sixtinian Madonna. He was made a member of the Academy in 1817 and professor in 1824. The Cotta publishing house commissioned illustrations for Johann Wolfgang Goethe's Faust (26 plates), which made him financially independent. Goethe liked his work, and he illustrated works by other famous authors, most notably Friedrich Schiller's Lied von der Glocke (43 plates), a Shakespeare Gallery (80 plates), and B\u00fcrger's Ballads (15 plates). He also did oil paintings on classical subjects, and portraits. Many of his works were created in a house in the L\u00f6\u00dfnitz, with a view of the Elbe Valley. As a winemaker, he was a member of the Saxon wine association from 1799 onwards. Retzsch died in Oberl\u00f6ssnitz/Radebeul. ==Notes== ==References== *Das Winzerfest der Weinbaugesellschaft im K\u00f6nigreich Sachsen am 25.10.1840, Meinhold & S\u00f6hne, Dresden *Neidhardt, H.J., Die Malerei der Romantik in Dresden, Seemann Verlag.
