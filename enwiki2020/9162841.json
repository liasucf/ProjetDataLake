Cain shared screenwriting credit. ==Plot== Blake Cantrell (Robert Taylor), an aristocrat from Maryland and a well-groomed cynic, uses his organized hunt to announce his imminent bankruptcy. In order to pay off his debts, Blake is forced to sell even his slaves, instead of freeing them, which causes the disapproval of his guest Susan Griffith (Florence Rice). Later in the evening, when he tries to seduce the girl, she bumps him back and leaves the mansion urgently. However, Blake is also forced to leave his home, since it was sold to cover his debts. He arrives to Cumberland to get a job at his father's old friend, Colonel Webb (Jonathan Hale), the head of the Baltimore-Ohio railroad construction. Webb offers Blake a job which consists of spying on Starkey (Wallace Beery), the head of a competing shipping company, but Blake refuses. In the evening of the same day, Blake is jailed for a fight. ==Cast== Lobby card * Wallace Beery as Starkey * Robert Taylor as Blake Cantrell * Florence Rice as Susan Griffith * Helen Broderick as Mandy Griffith * Charles Bickford as Mr. Arnold (Morgan) * Barton MacLane as Mr. Crowder * Charley Grapewin as \"Old Puff\" * John Qualen as Davy * Robert Gleckler as Sheriff Barney * Jonathan Hale as Colonel Webb ==Box office== According to MGM records, the film earned $1,233,000 in the US and Canada and $607,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $183,000. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1939 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American historical drama films Category:Films directed by W.
