    "text": "', provisional designation ', is a larger Jupiter trojan from the Greek camp, approximately in diameter. The unusual C/X-type Jovian asteroid is possibly a slow rotator with a rotation period of 250 hours. It was discovered on 5 October 1986 by Slovak astronomer Milan Antal at the Toru\u0144 Centre for Astronomy in Piwnice, Poland. It remains unnamed since its numbering in January 1992. == Orbit and classification == ' is a Jupiter trojan which stays in a 1:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter. It is located in the leading Greek camp at its Lagrangian point, 60\u00b0 ahead on its orbit . It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.8\u20135.6 AU once every 11 years and 10 months (4,331 days; semi- major axis of 5.2 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 11\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Piwnice in October 1986. == Physical characteristics == ' is an unusual C-/X-type according to Pan-STARRS survey and the SDSS-based taxonomy, and has a V\u2013I color index of 0.830. === Rotation period === In November 2009, Stefano Mottola at the Calar Alto Observatory observed ' in a photometric survey of 80 Jupiter trojans. The obtained lightcurve rendered a very long rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of in magnitude (). However, the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) considers the result as incorrect. As of 2018, no secure period has been obtained. === Diameter and albedo === According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, ' measures 39.84 and 57.83 kilometers in diameter with an albedo of 0.084 and 0.064, respectively. CALL agrees with the results obtained by IRAS, assumes an even lower albedo of 0.0404, and calculates a similar diameter of 57.56 kilometers. == Numbering and naming == This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 19 January 1992 (). As of 2018, it has not been named. == References == == External links == * Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info) * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (5001)-(10000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center * * 005025 Category:Discoveries by Milan Antal 19861005 ",
