Entry to the gallery is free of charge and open to visitors. As a cultural institution, Bentara Budaya hosts a wide spectrum of Indonesian cultural activities, from traditional to modern Indonesian arts, exhibitions of fine arts such as paintings, sculptures and graphic arts, to performing arts, and concerts. == History == The institution was founded on 26 September 1982 by Jakob Oetama, the founder of the Kompas Gramedia Group. An avid art collector, Oetama felt the need to share his art collections, which included paintings by Indonesian artists, sculptures, antique Chinese and Indonesian ceramics, and traditional crafts such as wayang. Subsequently, a building was constructed to store and display the collection, which later developed into an art gallery and exhibition hall to showcase the works of Indonesian artists and to promote Indonesian culture. Later, Bentara Budaya became a cultural institution, with a cultural philanthropic branch with the corporate social responsibility practices of the Kompas Gramedia Group. The Bentara Budaya premiered with the ceramics exhibition of Studio Titik Temu Tembikar, by Liosadang, Purwakarta promoted by the artist Adi Munardi in 1985. Bentara Budaya Jakarta Museum was opened on 26 June 1986. Modeled after Bentara Budaya in Yogyakarta, the design of the Jakarta building was influenced by a traditional house from the Javanese Regency of Kudus. The teakwood house, designed by the famed architect Romo Mangunwijaya, incorporated many aspects of traditional Indonesian, Hindu, and Chinese architecture. With its vast array of art collections and through its patronage and support for Indonesian and foreign artists, Bentara Budaya Jakarta sets its mission to nurture, conserve and promote art and culture, as well as to contribute and participate in the Indonesian cultural scene. ==Collection== Cirebon-style wayang glass painting, depicting Bharatayudha, Collection of Bentara Budaya Jakarta Today, Bentara Budaya Jakarta has about 573 paintings by various Indonesian artists, among others Affandi, S Sudjojono, Hendra Gunawan, Basoeki Abdullah, Bagong Kussudiardjo, Trubus Sudarsono, Rudolf Bonnet, H Widayat, Otto Jaya and many more.
