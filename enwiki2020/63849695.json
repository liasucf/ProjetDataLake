    "text": "Gonsalvo Monroy was a nobleman that served as Count of Malta between 1421 and 1427. Monroy served as a feudal lord of Malta, and was unpopular due to various heavy taxes being introduced, and this may have been one of the causes why the population was living in poverty. The population of Gozo revolted in 1425, with the peak being reached in 1426, when Maltese ransacked Monroy's residence in Mdina, and blocking the Castrum Maris in Birgu (where Monroy's wife, Donna Costanza, was). The Maltese people were ready to buy out the land from Monroy, and a deal was struck between Gonsalvo Monroy's administration and a Maltese nobleman, Antonio Inguanez, who offered his two sons in exchange of Lady Constance of Monroy. The sum to be paid was 30,000 florins, which however was still a hefty sum, and the local population never managed to settle, and Monroy relieved the debt in his will. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:1428 deaths Category:Feudalism in Europe Category:15th century in Malta Category:Heads of state of Malta Category:Kingdom of Sicily people ",
