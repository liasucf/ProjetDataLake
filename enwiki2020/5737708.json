    "text": "Metrolina Speedway is a defunct auto racing track located in northeast Charlotte, North Carolina on the Metrolina Fairgrounds. The track, also known as Charlotte Fairgrounds Speedway, was 1/2 mile (.804 km) in length and had a clay surface. It was paved for a short time in the 1970s to allow the NASCAR circuit to hold races there. Many racers have raced at Metrolina Speedway, including Dale Earnhardt Sr., Brad Teague, and Harry Gant. It is one of many racetracks in the Metrolina region of North Carolina and South Carolina. In 2009 plans were announced to reopen the track as Metrolina Speed and Sport Center. The track was to be repaved and the plans included a Go-Kart track, outdoor RC racing track, a hotel, and roof-top skate park though as of 2017 nothing has come of this proposal. The track was the subject of the first episode of Lost Speedways, on Peacock (streaming service), hosted by Dale Earnhardt Jr. ==External links== * Metrolina Speedway on Google Maps * Metrolina Speedway at Ghosts of Southern Dirt Tracks * Photos at Ghosts of Southern Dirt Track, the track in late 2005 * Flickr photos tagged Metrolina Speedway Category:Motorsport venues in North Carolina Category:NASCAR tracks Category:Sports venues in Charlotte, North Carolina Category:1982 establishments in North Carolina Category:Sports venues completed in 1982 Category:1998 disestablishments in North Carolina ",
