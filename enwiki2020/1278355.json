However, two college suspensions for marijuana use hurt his stock on draft day. Cleveland selected him as 16th overall pick in the first round of the 2002 NFL Draft. As a rookie in 2002, Green appeared in all 16 regular season games and started ten of them, gaining 887 yards and scoring six touchdowns. In a home game with playoff implications versus Atlanta late in the season, Green provided Browns fans with one of the most memorable moments of the new Browns. He ran a 64-yard touchdown to put the Browns ahead for good in a play known as \"Run William Run!\" due to radio play by play man Jim Donovan's call of the play. His 2003 season, however, was fraught with turmoil. After a good start with 559 yards, Green was arrested for drunk driving and marijuana possession. Green was also notoriously seen wearing one shoe and one sock during the arrest. The arrest led to a four-game suspension under the league's substance abuse policy. While under suspension, Green's fianc\u00e9e, Asia Gray, stabbed him in the back during a domestic dispute. The league extended his suspension through the end of the 2003 season \"for treatment purposes.\" In 2004, Green gained 585 yards on the season. On November 14, he was ejected prior to a game with the Pittsburgh Steelers for fighting with linebacker Joey Porter. Around this time, he had disclosed that he was having a child with a woman other than his wife. His final season in Cleveland was an injury-plagued 2005 campaign where he appeared in eight games and gained only 78 yards. The Browns placed him on injured reserve at the end of training camp in 2006 and reached an injury settlement with Green allowing them to release him.Zac Jackson, Browns, Green part ways, Cleveland Browns.com, 9,8,06 In March 2008, it was reported that Green would attempt to play in the NFL again after two seasons out of the league. He worked out at his alma mater Boston College's Pro Day on March 19, showing up in \"great shape,\" bench-pressing 225 pounds 25 times and posting a 42-inch vertical leap, but also ran a 4.85 forty yard dash. However, he did not sign a contract. ===NFL statistics=== Rushing Stats {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !! Team !! Games !! Carries !! Yards !! Yards per Carry !! Longest Carry !! Touchdowns !!
