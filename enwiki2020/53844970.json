In 2011 he moved abroad, joining K League Classic side Gyeongnam FC. Morato made his professional debut on 23 July 2011, coming on as a late substitute for Yoon Bit-garam in a 2\u20132 away draw against Incheon United. After six matches, only two as a starter, he was released. Morato subsequently returned to his homeland, and represented Ferrovi\u00e1ria, Mogi Mirim and Boa Esporte in quick succession. On 8 December 2015 he signed for Audax, but moved to FC Cascavel the following 18 February. After scoring doubles against Maring\u00e1 and J. Malucelli, Morato was presented at Ituano on 4 May 2016. He was a regular starter for the club during the S\u00e9rie D and the Campeonato Paulista campaigns, notably scoring a brace in a 5\u20130 home routing of Metropolitano on 9 July. On 11 April 2017, Morato signed an eight-month contract with S\u00e3o Paulo, club he already represented as a youth. He made his debut for the club eight days later, starting and assisting Lucas Pratto in a 2\u20131 Copa do Brasil away win against Cruzeiro. On 7 August 2018, Morato was loaned to fellow top tier side Sport as a part of Everton Felipe's deal to S\u00e3o Paulo. On 15 January 2019, Ituano announced that Morato had returned to the club. In April 2019, after performing well in the state league for Ituano, Morato was transferred to newly-merged Red Bull Bragantino where he won the 2019 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B . ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|State League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Conmebol !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |valign=\"center\"|Gyeongnam |2011 |K League Classic |999||100000000000000||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Ferrovi\u00e1ria |2012 |rowspan=\"2\"|Paulista A2 |colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6All appearance(s) in Copa Paulista||1||6||1 |- |2013 |colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!9!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!6!!1!!15!!1 |- |valign=\"center\"|Mogi Mirim |2014 |S\u00e9rie C |0||0||8||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||8||2 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Boa Esporte |2014 |rowspan=\"2\"|S\u00e9rie B |16||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||2 |- |2015 |0||0||2||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !16!!2!!2!!1!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!19!!3 |- |valign=\"center\"|Cascavel |2016 |Paranaense |colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||7||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||7||4 |- |rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\"|Ituano |2016 |rowspan=\"3\"|S\u00e9rie D |11||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||1||14||4 |- |2017 |0||0||12||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||12||2 |- |2019 |0||0||13||6||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||13||6 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !11!!3!!25!!8!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!3!!1!!39!!12 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|S\u00e3o Paulo (loan) |2017 |rowspan=\"2\"|S\u00e9rie A |0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- |2018 |0||0||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!1!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!2!!0 |- |valign=\"center\"|Sport (loan) |2018 |S\u00e9rie A |7||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||7||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !40!!5!!52!!15!!2!!0!!0!!0!!9!!2!!103!!22 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:People from S\u00e3o Paulo (state) Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie D players Category:Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Ferrovi\u00e1ria de Esportes players Category:Mogi Mirim Esporte Clube players Category:Boa Esporte Clube players Category:Ituano FC players Category:S\u00e3o Paulo FC players Category:Sport Club do Recife players Category:Red Bull Bragantino players Category:K League 1 players Category:Gyeongnam FC players Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in South Korea Category:Expatriate footballers in South Korea ",
