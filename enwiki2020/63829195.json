The Conservatives were a group that influenced the political developments and constitutional order of Serbia during the 19th century. Their political opponents were the liberals. The Conservatives advocated a more decisive role for the Royal council rather than the National Assembly (Parliament), and were also staunch opponents of the passage of liberal laws and constitution. Prominent leaders of the Conservatives include Ilija Gara\u0161anin, Jovan Marinovi\u0107 and Nikola Hristi\u0107. In the 1880s, the Conservative Party ceased to exist, being replaced in the National Assembly by the conservative liberal Serbian Progressive Party. ==Conservative Prime Ministers== {| class=wikitable !
