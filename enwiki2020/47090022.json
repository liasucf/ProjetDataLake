    "text": "Hugh Langwell (1860 - 15 May 1933) was an Irish-born Australian politician. He was born in Belfast to farmer Hugh Langwell and Matilda McCully. While he was very young the family moved to Victoria and he was educated at Warrnambool. He moved to New South Wales in 1880, becoming a stationworker. Around 1892 he married Sarah Jane Brooks, with whom he had eight children. He settled in Bourke, where he owned a small newsagency, tobacconist and barber shop. In 1891 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Bourke; although a labour supporter, he had failed to win endorsement from the new Labor Party and sat as an independent labour member. He was defeated in 1894. In 1900 he was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council, but he resigned early in 1902 after his appointment as Commissioner of the Western Lands Board. He was Chairman of the Board from 1928 until his dismissal following a Royal Commission in 1931. Langwell died in Bondi in 1933. ==References== Category:1860 births Category:1933 deaths Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Independent members of the Parliament of New South Wales ",
