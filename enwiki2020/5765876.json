Hatton enjoyed a successful silent film career, including a stint of being paired in 1920s comedies with Wallace Beery. However, during the sound era his career soon skidded and he usually played smaller supporting roles, including the tobacco-chewing, rip snorting Rusty Joslin in The Three Mesquiteers Western B picture series. He also appeared in the TV series Adventures of Superman. Hatton died in 1971 in Palmdale, California. He has a star in the Motion Picture section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1708 Vine Street. ==Selected filmography== ===Film=== *Tragic Love (1909, Short) - A Detective / In Factory *A Burglar's Mistake (1909, Short) - At Folsom's / Secretary *The Bangville Police (1913, Short) - Farm Hand (in vest) *That Ragtime Band (1913, Short) - Trumpet Player *The Squaw Man (1914) - Cowhand (uncredited) *The Circus Man (1914) - Ernie Cronk *The Girl of the Golden West (1915) - Castro *Young Romance (1915) - Jack *The Warrens of Virginia (1915) - Blake *The Unafraid (1915, Short) - Bosnian Valet *The Captive (1915) - Turkish Soldier (uncredited) *The Woman (1915) - Secretary *The Wild Goose Chase (1915, Short) - Mr. Wright *The Arab (1915) - Mysterious Messenger *Chimmie Fadden (1915, Short) - Larry, His Brother *Kindling (1915) - Steve Bates *The Case of Becky (1915) - Department Store Manager (uncredited) *Blackbirds (1915) - Hawke, Jr. *Carmen (1915) - Spectator at Bullfight (uncredited) *Armstrong's Wife (1915) - Runner *Chimmie Fadden Out West (1915) - Larry *At Bay (1915) - Minor Role (uncredited) *The Unknown (1915) - Second Private *The Cheat (1915) - Courtroom Spectator (uncredited) *The Immigrant (1915) - Munsing - Harding's Secretary *The Golden Chance (1915) - Jimmy The Rat *Temptation (1915) - Baron Cheurial *Tennessee's Pardner (1916) - Gewilliker Hay *To Have and to Hold (1916) - Nicolo *The Sowers (1916) - The Peddler *Public Opinion (1916) - Smith *The Honorable Friend (1916) - Kayosho *The Lash (1916) - Mr. Crawdon *Oliver Twist (1916) - The Artful Dodger *Joan the Woman (1916) - Charles VII *The American Consul (1917) - President Cavillo *A Romance of the Redwoods (1917) - Dick Roland *The Little American (1917) - Count Jules de Destin *What Money Can't Buy (1917) - King Stephen III *The Squaw Man's Son (1917) - Storekeeper *The Crystal Gazer (1917) - Phil Mannering *Hashimura Togo (1917) - Reporter *The Woman God Forgot (1917) - Montezuma *The Secret Game (1917) - Mr. Harris *Nan of Music Mountain (1917) - Logan *The Devil-Stone (1917) *Jules of the Strong Heart (1918) - Ted Kendall *One More American (1918) - Bump Rundle *The Whispering Chorus (1918) - John Tremble *Old Wives for New (1918) - Beautician (uncredited) *We Can't Have Everything (1918) - Marquis Of Strathdene *The Firefly of France (1918) - The Firefly *Sandy (1918) - Ricks Wilson *Less Than Kin (1918) - James Emmons *The Source (1918) - Pop Sprowl *Arizona (1918) - Tony *The Dub (1919) - Phineas Driggs *Don't Change Your Husband (1919) - Phineas Driggs *Maggie Pepper (1919) - Jake Rothschild *The Poor Boob (1919) - Stephen Douglas *Experimental Marriage (1919) - Arthur Barnard *Johnny Get Your Gun (1919) - Milton C.
