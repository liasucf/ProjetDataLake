    "text": "was a Japanese sumo wrestler from Noto Province. He was the sport's 6th yokozuna. He trained \u014dzeki Tsurugizan Taniemon. ==Early career== He was born in Shitsumi, Noto and went to Edo in 1815. His birth name remains ambiguous, but was claimed to be . He made his debut under the shikona in March 1815. He reached the top makuuchi division in October 1822. In January 1824, he was defeated by Inazuma, but defeated others at the maegashira #2 rank and was promoted to komusubi. In the summer of 1825, he defeated Inazuma at the Hirakawa Tenjin Shrine. He was promoted to \u014dzeki in October 1826. He changed his ring name to \u014cnomatsu in March 1827. ==Yokozuna== \u014cnomatsu was awarded a yokozuna license in February 1828. On March 25, 1829, Ienari Tokugawa saw that \u014cnomatsu defeated Inazuma. Because he grew up in a poor family, he attempted to win bouts by fair means or foul. To shake competitors' confidence, he would often do matta, or waiting, at the initial charge, or tachi-ai of his sumo bouts. He was often criticized for his fighting style. Even so, he was popular in Edo. He retired in November 1835. In the top makuuchi division, he won 142 bouts and lost 31 bouts, recording a winning percentage of 82.1. The 7th yokozuna Inazuma was his rival. His overall career record was quite far behind Inazuma, but his record over Inazuma was five wins (including two other than honbasho), four losses, five draws and one hold. ==Top division record== *The actual time the tournaments were held during the year in this period often varied. *Championships for the best record in a tournament were not recognized or awarded before the 1909 summer tournament, and the unofficial championships above are historically conferred.
