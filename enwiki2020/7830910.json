    "text": "The Puelo River has its origin in Lake Puelo in Argentine, and flows north- west through the Andes into Chile and the Reloncav\u00ed Estuary of the Reloncav\u00ed Sound at the northern end of the Gulf of Ancud. ==Course== Just downstream from its source in Puelo Lake, the river enters Inferior Lake. After leaving the lake, the river flows in a generally northwesterly direction, receiving the waters of a chain of lakes, the largest being Azul and Las Rocas. It also receives the waters of Ventisquero and Traidor rivers. A part of the northernmost border of Pumal\u00edn Park approximately parallels the course of the Ventisquero River. Traidor River rises in Hornopir\u00e9n National Park. A large northern tributary of the Puelo, the Manso, has its sources in Mascardi Lake and other lakes and streams south-east of the Cerro Tronador, also in Argentina, and flows south-west through the Andes to unite with the Puelo a few kilometers west of the 72nd meridian. Puelo river's lower course is impeded in such a manner as to form three small lakes, called Superior, Inferior and the Tagua Tagua Lake. ==References== Puelo River Puelo River Category:Rivers of Los Lagos Region Category:Rivers of Chubut Province Category:International rivers of South America ",
