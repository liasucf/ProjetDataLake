    "text": "Ewa Maria Kubicka is a Polish mathematician interested in graph theory and actuarial science. She is known for introducing the concept of the chromatic sum of a graph, the minimum possible sum when the vertices are labeled by natural numbers with no two adjacent vertices having equal labels. Kubicka studied mathematics at Wroc\u0142aw University of Science and Technology beginning in 1974, and earned a master's degree there in 1979. She came to Western Michigan University for graduate study, earning both a master's degree in computer science and a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1989. Her dissertation, The Chromatic Sum and Efficient Tree Algorithms, was supervised by Allen J. Schwenk. She became an assistant professor at Emory University and then, in 1990, moved to the University of Louisville, where she has been a full professor since 2004. At Louisville, she directs the actuarial program and is undergraduate advisor for mathematics. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Polish mathematicians Category:Polish women mathematicians Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:Graph theorists Category:Wroc\u0142aw University of Technology alumni Category:Western Michigan University alumni Category:Emory University faculty Category:University of Louisville faculty Category:20th- century women mathematicians Category:21st-century women mathematicians ",
