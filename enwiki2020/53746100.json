This site consists of two nearby areas of wetland in valleys which drain into the River Great Ouse. The northern one is a mire on shallow peat, and the southern one is agriculturally unimproved grassland and marsh on diverse soils, which has over a hundred flowering plant species. A footpath leads into the northern area, but there is no public access to the southern one. ==References== Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Northamptonshire ",
