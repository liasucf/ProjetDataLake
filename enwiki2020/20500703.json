    "text": "Inspired by the terms genome and genomics, other words to describe complete biological datasets, mostly sets of biomolecules originating from one organism, have been coined with the suffix -ome and -omics. Some of these terms are related to each other in a hierarchical fashion. For example, the genome contains the ORFeome, which gives rise to the transcriptome, which is translated to the proteome. Other terms are overlapping and refer to the structure and/or function of a subset of proteins (e.g. glycome, kinome). An omicist is a scientist who studies omeomics, cataloging all the \u201comics\u201d subfields. Omics.org is a Wiki that collects and alphabetically lists all the known \"omes\" and \"omics.\" == List of topics == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! style=\"width:120px;\"| -ome !! style=\"width:120px;\"| Field of study (-omics) !! style=\"width:250px;\"| Collection of !! style=\"width:120px;\"| Parent subject !!
