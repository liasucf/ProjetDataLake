    "text": "Marleen Gorris (born 9 December 1948) is a Dutch writer and director. Gorris is known as an outspoken feminist and supporter of gay and lesbian issues which is reflected in much of her work. In 1995, the Netherlands won an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film for her film,Antonia's Line. The film is the first feature film directed by a woman to win an Academy Award. ==Early life== Marleen Gorris was born on 9 December 1948 in Roermond in the Netherlands. She was born to Protestant, working-class parents in the Catholic southern part of the Netherlands. Gorris studied drama at home and abroad. She studied drama at the University of Amsterdam and has an MA in Drama from the University of Birmingham, England. She began working as a filmmaker with almost no previous experience in the cinema and made an auspicious writing and directorial debut in 1982 with A Question of Silence. The Dutch government provided the funding to finance the project. ==Career== It was not until the age of 30 that Gorris began writing scripts. She took her first effort to the Belgian filmmaker Chantal Akerman, hoping to interest her in directing it. Akerman, however, told Gorris that she must make the film herself. The result, A Question of Silence (1982), caused considerable international controversy with its story about three unacquainted women who murder a randomly chosen man. The film was hailed by some as a logical case study of what happens when women are driven to the brink by a male-dominated society, and others decried it as a juvenile revenge fantasy. Gorris was honored in her homeland with the Netherlands' Golden Calf Award and earned a reputation as a subversive new filmmaker. She followed up A Question of Silence with Broken Mirrors (1984). Set among a group of prostitutes in an Amsterdam brothel, the film re-examined some of the themes at play in Gorris' previous feature, particularly in its analysis of the patriarchy. It was greeted with mixed reactions; many critics recognized it as an insightful, disturbing look at the sexual threats (both literal and metaphorical) directed at women in everyday life. She did not make another film until The Last Island (1990). The film, which told the story of a group of people (two women and five men) and a dog stranded on an island, was dubbed by one critic as \"a feminist Lord of the Flies for the '90s.\" In 1995, Gorris had her greatest international success to-date with Antonia's Line. Starring Willeke van Ammelrooy, the story of an independent woman and her female descendants was not as radical as the director's previous work, although a number of critics complained that the men in the film were portrayed as either ineffectual idiots or potential rapists. However, critical support for the film was overwhelming, and it was honored with a number of international awards, including a Golden Calf and an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film. Her next film was Mrs Dalloway (1997), based on the novel by Virginia Woolf, with a cast that included Vanessa Redgrave, Natascha McElhone, and Rupert Graves. It earned a number of international honors, including an Evening Standard British Film Award. She followed this movie with The Luzhin Defence (2000), based on a novel by Vladimir Nabokov. Starring John Turturro and Emily Watson, it tells the story of the love affair between an eccentric chess champion and a strong-willed society woman. Carolina (2003), starring Julia Stiles, Shirley MacLaine, and Alessandro Nivola, was released direct-to-video in 2005. Gorris's 2009 film Within the Whirlwind, starring Emily Watson, was not picked up for distribution. According to Watson, \"It was delivered pretty much the day the market crashed so nobody was buying anything.\" ==Personal life== Marleen Gorris came out as a lesbian after the success of Antonia's Line. Her partner, Maria Uitdehaag, served in its production as first assistant director, and was mentioned by Gorris in her Academy Award acceptance speech. ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%;\" \"text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Director ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Producer ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Writer ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes |- | align=\"center\" | 1982 | A Question of Silence (De stilte rond Christine M.) | | | | Golden Calf for Best Film |- | align=\"center\" | 1984 | Gebroken spiegels (Broken Mirrors) | | | | |- | align=\"center\" | 1990 | The Last Island | | | | |- | align=\"center\" | 1995 | Antonia's Line (Antonia) | | | | Academy Award for Best International Feature Film Golden Calf for Best Film Golden Calf for Best Director of a Feature Film Nominated: BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language |- | align=\"center\" | 1997 | Mrs Dalloway | | | | Evening Standard British Film Award for Best Screenplay |- | align=\"center\" | 2000 | The Luzhin Defence | | | | |- | align=\"center\" | 2003 | Carolina | | | | |- | align=\"center\" | 2009 | Within the Whirlwind | | | | |- |} ===Television=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%;\" \"text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Director ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Producer ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Writer ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes |- | align=\"center\" | 1983 | De geest van gras (The Spirit of Grass) | | | | TV movie |- | align=\"center\" | 1993 | Verhalen van de straat (Stories of the Street) | | | | 5 episodes |- | align=\"center\" | 2007 | The L Word | | | | Episode: \"Livin' La Vida Loca\" |- | align=\"center\" | 2011 | Rembrandt en ik (Rembrandt and Me) | | | | Director: 4 episodes; Writer: 1 episode |- |} ==See also== * List of female film and television directors * List of lesbian filmmakers * List of LGBT-related films directed by women ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch feminists Category:Dutch film directors Category:Dutch screenwriters Category:Dutch women film directors Category:Dutch women screenwriters Category:Lesbian artists Category:LGBT directors Category:LGBT screenwriters Category:People from Roermond Category:LGBT people from the Netherlands Category:University of Amsterdam alumni Category:Alumni of the University of Birmingham Category:Golden Calf winners Category:Directors of Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award winners ",
