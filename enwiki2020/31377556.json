    "text": "Michael Weiss (1569-1612) 17th century drawing Michael Wei\u00df (also spelled Michael Weiss, born in 1569, in Mediasch, deceased 16 October 1612, in Marienburg) was a Transylvanian Saxon politician and historian. He is mostly known for being the mayor of Kronstadt (modern-day Bra\u015fov, Romania). ==Early life and political ascent== He was born in Mediasch (current-day Media\u015f, Romania) as the son, of mayor Johannes Wei\u00df and his wife, Gertrude Wolf (whom would both die of the plague in 1586). He went to the local elementary school, then, in 1583, aged 14, attended the courses of the Jesuit school of Klausenburg. During the two years spent there, he learned Hungarian, and progressed enough as to be able to write poems in this language.C\u0103rturari bra\u015foveni, p. 226. Shortly, he began his political career, as secretary of Count Ferdinand von Hardek, and then by working for the Hungarian chancellor office in Prague. He was noticed by Emperor Rudolf II, who ennobled him in 1589, at age 20.C\u0103rturari bra\u015foveni, p. 226. In 1590, he returned to Transylvania. He was chosen in the Assembly of the one hundred in 1591, then in 1594, as representative of Kronstadt in the Transylvanian Diet (the political and constitutional organ of the principality) and in the Senate, in 1600. As representative and senator of Kronstadt, the voivodes Istv\u00e1n Bocskay, Sigismund R\u00e1k\u00f3czi and those of the B\u00e1thory family sent Wei\u00df in several diplomatic missions, including to domnitor Radu \u015eerban of Wallachia. Michael Weiss described \u015eerban as being \"wealthy, cunning,in the sense of able, diplomatic and very skilled in the craft of war\".Mu\u015fatcu, p. 29. In 1606, the Wallachian prince invited him to take part in several hunting and fishing trips, for two weeks. During this time, it appears they have discussed political issues of common interest, the results of which will be seen five years later.Mu\u015fatcu, p. 90-91. ==Legacy== ===In memoriam=== In 1887, Nonnengasse (Nun Alley) was named after its former mayor. On the list of historical monuments created by the Ministry of Culture, at number 976, code LMI 2004 BV-IV-m-A-11919, is The Monument of Saxon Students fallen in Battle in 1612. Built between 1912\u20131913, it commemorates the 39 young students that died near Marienburg. After 1989, DFDR Bra\u015fov has reinstated the tradition of commemorating and honouring predecessors through a celebration at the forementioned monument. ===Literary works=== Besides the poems written in his youth, Michael Wei\u00df has left behind a few writings of importance with regard to his contemporary Kronstadt and Transylvania.C\u0103rturari bra\u015foveni, p. 226-227. * Liber annalium raptim scriptus per Mich. Weyss Mediensem, senatorem Republicae Coronensis, translatable as \"The book of haste chronicles by Michael Wei\u00df of Mediasch, Senator of the Republic of Kronstadt\", a journal later published by Eugen von Trauschenfels, with a preface signed by A. Kurz. * Brevis consignatio tumultum bellicorum ab anno Chr. 1610, usque completum annum 1613 ambitione et inquietudine Gabrielis B\u00e1thori Principis motorum, translatable as \"Brief writings of the tumultuous war of 1610, then added in 1613 by ambition and restlessness of Prince Gabriel B\u00e1thori\", with an anonymous addition to the events of 1613. It is also worth mentioning that all the documents of the Wei\u00df family have been donated to the patrimony of Johannes Honterus high-school of Kronstadt. ==References== ==Further reading== *Adolf Meschend\u00f6rfer: Michael Wei\u00df, Stadtrichter von Kronstadt (St\u00fcck) (\"Michael Wei\u00df, mayor of Brasov\" - theatre play), Bra\u0219ov, Kerschner Publishing, 1921; *Michael K\u00f6niges: Michael Wei\u00df, historical drama; *Maja Philippi: Michael Weiss - sein Leben und Wirken in Wort und Bild (Michael Weiss - life and work, in pictures and words), Kriterion Publishing, 1982; *Georgeta Filitti: Mileniul rom\u00e2nesc.1000 de ani de istorie in imagini, Litera Publishing, 2006; Category:1569 births Category:1612 deaths Category:16th-century Hungarian people Category:Transylvanian-Saxon people Category:People from Media\u0219 Category:People of the Long Turkish War ",
