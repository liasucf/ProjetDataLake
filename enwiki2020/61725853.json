His cooperation with the King, who at one point even decorated him, was not viewed favorably in Croatia.Pete\u0161i\u0107, \u0106iril: Katoli\u010dko sve\u0107enstvo u NOB-u 1941-1945., Zagreb, 1982, Vjesnikova pres- agencija and Globus, p. 130\u2014154 At a session of the Zagreb Assembly held on November 28, 1929, Rittig delivered a speech in which he strongly criticized Paveli\u0107, who, according to him, worked in the service of Italian and Hungarian interests.Pete\u0161i\u0107, \u0106iril (1982).
