    "text": "Mango Airlines SOC Ltd, trading as Mango, is a South African low-cost airline based at the OR Tambo International Airport, and a subsidiary of South African Airways. ==History== Mango was launched on 30 October 2006, with bookings going on sale at midnight on the same date. Mango's first flight took place on 15 November 2006. Mango planned to join Star Alliance as a Connecting Partner in the third quarter of 2016 but the plan has been put on hold due to South African Airways' financial state. ==Corporate affairs== ===Ownership=== Mango is 100% owned by South African Airways, which is itself owned by the government of South Africa, but operates independently as a low-cost airline with its own Board and balance sheet. ===Business trends=== Financial and operational figures for Mango are fully incorporated within the SAA Group figures. Not all the results in the Group reports are broken down to subsidiary level, however, and therefore some figures below are from press reports. As of March 2020, no results for Mango have been released for 2018 and 2019 because SAA has not itself released its Group results.
