It was introduced at the 2015 EICMA in Milan, Italy. It is the flagship member of the MT range from Yamaha. The crossplane engine is based on the 2015 YZF-R1 but re-tuned to focus on low to mid-range torque. It features a number of significant technical changes including newly designed intake, exhaust and fuelling systems. It produces a claimed @ 11,500 rpm and @ 9,000 rpm.
