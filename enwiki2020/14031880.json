    "text": "The 2000 Canadian Professional Soccer League season was the third season under the Canadian Professional Soccer League name. The season began on May 26, 2000 and concluded on October 1, 2000 with Toronto Croatia defeating Toronto Olympians 2-1 to claim their first CPSL Championship (known as the Primus CPSL Cup for sponsorship reasons). The final was hosted at Cove Road Stadium for the first time. Throughout the season, all eight clubs from the previous year returned, while the Olympians secured their third straight regular season title. The league received sponsorship from Primus Canada, which granted Primus naming rights to the CPSL Championship, and Vincent Ursini was appointed the CPSL Chairman. == Teams == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
