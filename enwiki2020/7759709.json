    "text": "PCP Torpedo is a 6\" vinyl EP by American grindcore band Agoraphobic Nosebleed. It was released in 1998 on Hydra Head Records. PCP Torpedo was pressed on assorted colours, including black, black/red mixed, red, and orange/red mixed. The opening sample on \"Thanksgiving Day\" is Richard Pryor as Zeke Brown in the film Blue Collar. ==Track listing== ==PCP Torpedo/ANbRx reissue== PCP Torpedo/ANbRx is a 2-CD set that contains the re-release of the out of print PCP Torpedo 6\". The second disc, ANbRx, consists of remixes of songs from PCP Torpedo. Among notable contributors are Merzbow, Vidna Obmana, James Plotkin and Justin Broadrick. Much like the Altered States of America album, both discs contain hidden tracks: \"Azido Phencyclidine Electrophoresis\" on disc one and \"Submachine Drum (Agoraphonic Nosecandy mix)\" on disc two, both of which are accessible by rewinding the first track. ===Track listing=== == References == Category:1998 albums Category:Agoraphobic Nosebleed albums Category:Hydra Head Records albums Category:Albums with cover art by Aaron Turner Category:2006 remix albums Category:2006 compilation albums Category:Hydra Head Records compilation albums Category:Hydra Head Records remix albums ",
