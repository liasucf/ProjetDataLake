    "text": "Slavsko Polje () is a village in central Croatia, in the municipality of Gvozd, Sisak-Moslavina County. It is connected by the D6 highway. ==History== In the late 17th century, the village became a part of the Military Frontier. In the 18th century, it belonged to the Glina regiment. The development of the Vrginmost-Karlovac railway line in 1905 was important for the development of the village as it both provided employment (i.e. railway maintenance work) and allowed residents to seek employment and engage in trade further afield. In 1918, the village became a part of the Serbian-Croatian-Slovenian Kingdom and later on, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The village suffered heavy demographic losses in the World War II with 417 of its residents perishing. Of those, 235 were civilian victims of fascism while 81 died as partisan resistance fighters, and others succumbed to typhoid. In Glina massacres alone, 136 men and boys lost their lives in early August 1941. The first residents losing their lives already in May 1941 perished in the Jadovno concentration camp while some of its captured partisans died as prisoners of war in far away Norway. After being heavily hit by brutal Usta\u0161e campaign in summer 1941, the population joined the antifascist resistance movement en masse.Du\u0161an Bai\u0107 \"Kotar Vrginmost u NO borbi 1941-1945.\"/\"District of Vrginmost during National Liberation War 1941-1945\", pages 789-813, 1980 ==Demographics== According to the 2011 census, the village of Slavsko Polje has 338 inhabitants.
