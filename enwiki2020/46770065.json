There she finds adventure, war and romance with the dashing Highland warrior Jamie Fraser. Gabaldon originally intended Outlander to be straight historical fiction, but after a few days of writing Claire she realized that the character did not behave like an 18th century woman. Gabaldon eventually leaned into the modern approach to Claire, which prompted the introduction of time travel. ==Outlander novels== * Outlander (1991) * Dragonfly in Amber (1992) * Voyager (1994) * Drums of Autumn (1997) * The Fiery Cross (2001) * A Breath of Snow and Ashes (2005) * An Echo in the Bone (2009) * Written in My Own Heart's Blood (2014) ==Television series== Claire is portrayed by Irish actress Caitriona Balfe in the Starz television series Outlander. ===Awards and nominations=== Balfe won a Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television in 2015 and 2016, and a People's Choice Award for Favorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy TV Actress in 2016.
