He played basketball for Mears Middle School in Anchorage.

He explained his decision by saying, \"I think it was the right thing for me because it was a family thing and a myself thing. Playing in G League is basically getting me ready for the NBA draft. It's just one step below the NBA.\" ==Personal life== Nix's mother, Mina Tupuola, played basketball for Lathrop High School in Fairbanks, Alaska and attended the University of Alaska Fairbanks. ==References== ==External links== *USA Basketball bio Category:2002 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Fairbanks, Alaska Category:Sportspeople from Anchorage, Alaska Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Alaska Category:Point guards Category:McDonald's High School All-Americans ",
