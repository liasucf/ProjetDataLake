    "text": "The Committee for the Executive Office was established to advise and assist the First Minister and deputy First Minister, on matters within their responsibilities as Ministers. The committee undertakes a scrutiny, policy development and consultation role with respect to the Executive Office and plays a key role in the consideration and development of legislation. The Assembly approved a motion on 12 June 2007 to change the name of the committee from Committee of the Centre to Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister. Following the renaming of departments in the Northern Ireland Executive in 2016, the Assembly committee was renamed as the Committee for the Executive Office, reflecting the new name of the former Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister. == Membership (11) == {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Party ! scope=\"col\" | Member |- || Stewart Dickson |- || Pam Cameron |- || William Irwin |- || Phillip Logan |- || Christopher Stalford |- || Cathal Boylan |- || Se\u00e1n Lynch |- || Ian Milne |- || Richie McPhillips |- || Danny Kennedy (Deputy Chairperson) |- || Mike Nesbitt (Chairperson) |} == See also == * Executive Office * First Minister and deputy First Minister == References == == External links == * Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister Category:Northern Ireland Assembly ",
