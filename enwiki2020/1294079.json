Corbu changed his story about Sauni\u00e8re in 1962 (see below). ==Early life== Born on 27 April 1912 in the 7th arrondissement of Paris to D\u00e9sir\u00e9-Victor-Henri Corbu and Marguerite-Marie Corbu ( Rousseau), the granddaughter of Fran\u00e7ois-de-Sales- Narcisse Rousseau (1810-1866), an attorney based in Clamecy, Ni\u00e8vre who, in the aftermath of the French coup d'\u00e9tat of 1851, had been forced to flee into exile into Belgium to escape deportation to Cayenne. Corbu had an elder brother, ten years his senior named Charles-Pierre Corbu, an airline pilot employed by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Transports A\u00e9riens, who died alongside his mechanic, during a test flight of a commercial aircraft carrying no passengers at Le Bourget Airport, on 10 December 1927. The young No\u00ebl Corbu lived in Morocco due to his father being an attach\u00e9 at the Embassy there, before obtaining the degree of Doctor of Science in Paris. While living in Perpignan, Corbu met his future wife, Henriette Coll, ten years his senior and a native of the town who was then living at 16, rue J. Tastu, where she ran her business of selling poultry, eggs and cheese. The couple married on 21 January 1935. In the following years, Corbu set up a pasta factory which he named les p\u00e2tes Claire after his eldest child, his daughter Claire, situated at route d'Elne, Perpignan. By the end of 1942, Perpignan became occupied by German troops. ==Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau== It was soon afterwards that Corbu decided to send his two children, his daughter Claire and her younger brother, to a more remote and less accessible place, to the village of Bugarach. Corbu published his detective novel, Le Mort cambrioleur (\"The Burglar Dead\") in 1943.No\u00ebl Corbu, Le Mort cambrioleur (Perpignan, Impr. du Midi, 1943). Republished in 2005. Through the intermediary of his children's school teacher (once Marie D\u00e9narnaud's lodger), Corbu found out that Marie D\u00e9narnaud was selling her estate in Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau.Claire Corbu, Antoine Captier, L'H\u00e9ritage De L\u2019Abb\u00e9 Sauni\u00e8re (Editions B\u00e9lisane, 1985 reprinted in 2000). After two years of hesitation, Marie D\u00e9narnaud finally agreed to sell her property en viager\"A real estate transaction, popular in France, in which homeowners sell their property to a buyer for an amount of cash equivalent to a down payment in addition to a lifetime of monthly payments. Under this arrangement, the homeowner remains in the home until death, at which point the buyer takes possession\". to the Corbus and by her Holographic will dated 22 July 1946, she named Corbu and his wife her sole legatees. Marie D\u00e9narnaud could not afford to keep up her estate, which was in need of repairs and she had run into serious debts (that were settled by No\u00ebl Corbu upon purchase). The property comprised the Villa Bethania, the Tour Magdala, an Orangery, and the Belvedere that connects the Tour Magdala to the Orangery.Pierre Jarnac, Histoire du Tr\u00e9sor de Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau (\u00c9ditions B\u00e9lisane, 1985). In 1950 Corbu returned to Morocco hoping to set up a sugar refinery, without success.Vinciane Denis, Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau, Le Tr\u00e9sor de l'Abb\u00e9 Sauni\u00e8re (Paris: Marabout, 1996). When Marie D\u00e9narnaud died in 1953, Corbu inherited her archives relating to B\u00e9renger Sauni\u00e8re. During Easter 1955 Corbu turned the Villa Bethania into a Hotel (called L'h\u00f4tel de la Tour) and opened a restaurant located underneath the belvedere that connects the Tour Magdala to the Orangery (Corbu installed the windows). Later during the 1990s, the Villa Bethania was turned into a hotel again. In January 1956, the local newspaper La D\u00e9p\u00eache du Midi serialised an interview with Corbu in who claimed that Father Sauni\u00e8re discovered the treasure of Blanche of Castile, and which 'according to the archives' consisted of 28,500,000 gold pieces. This was the treasure of the French crown assembled by Blanche de Castile to pay the ransom of Saint Louis, a prisoner of the Saracens, the surplus of which she had hidden at Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau. Sauni\u00e8re had only found one part of it, so it was necessary to continue his investigations.Albert Salamon, D'un coup de pioche dans un pilier du ma\u00eetre-autel, l'abb\u00e9 Sauni\u00e8re met \u00e0 jour le tr\u00e9sor de Blanche de Castille (\"With one blow of the pick-axe in a pillar of the main altar Abb\u00e9 Sauni\u00e8re uncovered the treasure of Blanche de Castile\"), in La D\u00e9p\u00eache du Midi 12, 13, 14 January 1956. Corbu also claimed Sauni\u00e8re had in 1892 discovered \"parchments\" whilst renovating his church \"written in a mixture of French and Latin, which at first glance could be discerned passages from the Gospels\".Robert Charroux, Treasures of the World, p.220 (Frederick Muller Limited, 1966; English translation by Gloria Cant\u00f9). It has been noted by critics however that Sauni\u00e8re began renovating his church in 1886, not 1892,Jean-Jacques Bedu, Rennes-Le-Ch\u00e2teau: Autopsie d'un mythe (Ed. Loubati\u00e8res, 1990). and that \"there was no evidence that these parchments had ever existed\".Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood, The Treasure of Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau, A Mystery Solved, p.112 (Sutton Publishing Limited, revised paperback edition, 2005, ). Corbu claimed that Marie D\u00e9narnaud would confide a secret to him before she died, saying \"Pray do not worry yourself, Monsieur Corbu. You shall have more money than you will be able to spend!\" Robert Charroux, Tr\u00e9sors du monde: enterr\u00e9s, emmur\u00e9s, engloutis (Paris: Fayard, 1962). Translated into English in 1967. Corbu provided a tape-recording of his story for his guests, a transcript of which was deposited in the Archives de l'Aude, Carcassonne on 14 June 1962 by Maurice Tous of Alet-les-Bains.Archives d\u00e9partmentales, c\u00f4te 2J248; Bill Putnam, John Edwin Wood, The Treasure of Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau: A Mystery Solved, pages 19; 255 (Revised paperback edition, 2005. ). Corbu's story inspired author Robert Charroux to develop an active interest and in 1958, with his wife Yvette and other members of The Treasure Seekers' Club (that he founded in 1951), scanned the village of Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau and its church dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene for treasure using a metal detector. The Dowsing-by-Pendulum enthusiast and hypnotist Rolland Domergue, with medium Germaine Goyard, joined Corbu in 1958 to look for the treasure, and thus began the extensive accumulation of pilgrimages to the site by many various people from all over France, that on 28 July 1965 forced the local Municipal council to introduce a local By-law prohibiting excavations in the village. In April 1961, the French Television Channel RTF made a documentary directed by Marina Grey entitled La Roue Tourne (\"The Wheel Turns\"), that cast No\u00ebl Corbu as Father Sauni\u00e8re.Ren\u00e9 Descadeillas, Mythologie du Tr\u00e9sor de Rennes: Histoire Veritable de L'Abb\u00e9 Sauni\u00e8re, Cur\u00e9 de Rennes-Le-Ch\u00e2teau (M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Arts et des Sciences de Carcassonne, Ann\u00e9es 1971-1972, 4me s\u00e9rie, Tome VII, 2me partie; 1974). Corbu then changed his story about Sauni\u00e8re on an interview for the France Inter radio programme to Robert Charroux in 1962,Broadcast on France Inter radio on 30 July 1962 called Aujourd\u2019hui Le Tr\u00e9sor du cur\u00e9 aux milliards (\"Today, the treasure of the priest with the billions\").The full transcript of Corbu's radio interview was given in Parle- moi de Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau!, Number 2, pages 22-41, 2005 (privately published by Patrick Mensior). dropping all references to Blanche of Castile and claiming that Sauni\u00e8re's alleged treasure discovery relied upon two alleged inscriptions discovered in 1928: one on a gravestone in the cemetery and another on a stone found on farmland property close to Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau (Corbu alleged both \"artifacts\" were discovered by a retired amateur archaeologist, Ernest Cros, who died in 1946). In the revised edition of his book Treasures of the World published during the 1970s (not translated into English), Robert Charroux added the material given in the 1962 radio interview, but also retained parts of the original chapter on Rennes-le- Ch\u00e2teau that mentioned Blanche of Castile.Robert Charroux,Tr\u00e9sors du monde, tr\u00e9sors de France, tr\u00e9sors de Paris (Paris: Fayard, 1972). These references to inscriptions by Corbu inspired two documents of unknown provenance called Recherches de Mons. L'Ingenieur en chef Ernest Cros; entreprises dans la Haute Vall\u00e9e de l'Aude, surtout durant les ann\u00e9es 1920 \u00e0 1943, commonly called \"The Cros Report\" (one of them is said to have originated on Corbu's typewriter, the other is attributed to Ren\u00e9 Chesa).The documents are reproduced in the revised edition of Claire Corbu and Antoine Captier's book, L'h\u00e9ritage de l'Abb\u00e9 Sauni\u00e8re (\u00c9ditions de l'Oeil du Sphinx, 2012. ). ==Priory of Sion hoax== No\u00ebl Corbu's account of the discovery of the parchments by Father Sauni\u00e8re was later quoted in the document Un Tr\u00e9sor M\u00e9rovingien \u00e0 Rennes-le- Ch\u00e2teau (1966) attributed to \"Antoine L'Ermite\",Pierre Jarnac, Les Myst\u00e8res de Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau, M\u00e9langes Sulfureux, p. 20-21 (CERT, 1994). that for \"stylistic reasons suggest that this was written by Pierre Plantard and/or Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey\".John Saul, Janice Glaholm, Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau, A Bibliography, p. 28 (Mercurius Press, 1985). Philippe de Ch\u00e9risey confessed to having forged the famous parchments that appeared in G\u00e9rard de S\u00e8de\u2019s 1967 book, L'Or de Rennes (as well as faking \"The Cros Report\") in his manuscript \"Stone and Paper\".Jean-Luc Chaumeil, Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau \u2013 Gisors \u2013 Le Testament du Prieur\u00e9 de Sion, Le Cr\u00e9puscule d\u2019une T\u00e9n\u00e9breuse Affaire, p.184-228 (Editions P\u00e9gase, 2006, ). The text of the document attributed to \"Antoine L'Ermite\" was modelled on Charroux's account found in his book, Tr\u00e9sors du Monde, where he extensively quoted No\u00ebl Corbu. ==Heritage, tourism and archaeology== No\u00ebl Corbu sold the Sauni\u00e8re estate in 1964 to Henri Buthion (1924\u20132002) and moved to the Ch\u00e2teau of Saint-F\u00e9lix-Lauragais which he recently acquired. On 20 May 1968, on his way to Fanjeaux from Montpellier, Corbu's car, a Renault 16 was hit by a truck who had failed to yield the right-of-way. Corbu who was not in the driving seat and not wearing his seat belt, was killed instantly, the driver suffered only minor injuries. Corbu was interred in a burial vault alongside his wife (who died in 1966) in the cemetery of Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau. The estate has been the property of the local Municipal council since 2000. No\u00ebl Corbu's daughter Claire Corbu with her husband Antoine Captier (whose grandfather was the carillonneur of the church of Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau, when B\u00e9renger Sauni\u00e8re was the local priest), first published their book L'H\u00e9ritage de l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Sauni\u00e8re in 1985, reproducing a selection of archives relating to B\u00e9renger Sauni\u00e8re,Claire Corbu, Antoine Captier, L'H\u00e9ritage De L\u2019Abb\u00e9 Sauni\u00e8re (Editions B\u00e9lisane, 1985 reprinted in 2000, revised edition 2012). and in May 1989 opened the Sauni\u00e8re Museum in the village of Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau as part of the Association Terre de Rhedae, also part of the local Municipal council. When the Sauni\u00e8re Museum re-opened on 1 March 2009, the story of B\u00e9renger Sauni\u00e8re and the history of Rennes-le- Ch\u00e2teau was presented in four different languages. The museum was re-opened and re-furbished more recently in 2016 and called Le Mus\u00e9e Domaine de l'Abb\u00e9 Sauni\u00e8re. While the local Municipal council superficially accepts the legend of the treasure of Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau because it acts as a tourist magnet attracting substantial financial revenue (for example, endorsing DVDs that publicise the legend), the legend is not treated seriously by French archaeology (itself part of the French Ministry of Culture).See for example, Christiane Amiel, \"L\u2019ab\u00eeme au tr\u00e9sor, ou l\u2019or fant\u00f4me de Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau\" in, Claudie Voisenat (editor), Imaginaires arch\u00e9ologiques, pages 61\u201386 (Ethnologie de la France, Number 22, Paris: \u00c9ditions de la Maison des sciences de l\u2019homme, 2008). . For example, when the then village mayor gave the go- ahead to excavate the Tour Magdala in 2003 he was subsequently threatened with legal action by the local body of Direction r\u00e9gionale des affaires culturelles (or DRAC) for doing so without gaining prior official permission and therefore breaching the French Code du patrimoine.La DRAC a port\u00e9 plainte contre le Maire de Rennes-le-Ch\u00e2teau pour 'Fouilles illicites\" suite aux fouilles entreprises sous la Tour Magdala Les Z\u00e9chos de Rhedae, N\u00b024/25 - Octobre/Novembre 2003Code du Patrimoine, Legifrance.gouv.fr ==Published works== *Le Mort cambrioleur (1943), Imprimerie du Midi, 14 rue de la loge, Perpignan.
