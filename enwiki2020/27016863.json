    "text": "\"Daddy\" is a song by British singer Emeli Sand\u00e9, featuring British record producer Naughty Boy. It was released on 27 November 2011 as the second single from her debut studio album, Our Version of Events, which was released on 13 February 2012. In early January 2012, it was made iTunes' song of the week. ==Music video== A music video to accompany the release of \"Daddy\" was first released onto YouTube on 21 October 2011 at a total length of three minutes and twenty seconds. The video features Sand\u00e9 singing, whilst burglars, in which one of them is the person Sand\u00e9 is singing about, raid a supermarket, and one of them takes the money from the cash machine. In the end, Sand\u00e9 is in the supermarket, whilst a burglar approaches her. He then takes off his mask. In the end, the burglar finds a folded piece of paper in his fridge. ==Critical reception== Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song a very positive review, stating: \"My friends keep telling you what he did last night, how many girls he kissed, how many he liked,\" she insists over haunting church bell chimes as she gives her bezzie a reality check on love; before a mish- mash of thrashing acoustics pound out with more drama than the EastEnders cliffhanger outro. By the time the catchy-as-cholera chorus kicks in, it's obvious that 2012 is Sande's for the taking. At least Cowell's got one thing right this year, eh? Similarly, John Earls of the Daily Star gave the song 9/10, stating \"Our fave new soul girl of the year proves Heaven was no fluke with another awesome mix of emotional vocals and modern grooves that make being a pop star seem so easy.\" Going on to say \"The chorus is as huge as her quiff \u2013 if Emeli keeps this up, her album, Our Version of Events looks set to be a classic.\" ==Track listing== * Digital remix single # \"Daddy\" \u2013 3:08 # \"Daddy\" (Fred V & Grafix remix) \u2013 4:29 # \"Daddy\" (Disclosure remix) \u2013 4:08 # \"Daddy\" (Third Party remix) \u2013 6:21 # \"Daddy\" (Cyantific remix) \u2013 5:40 # \"Daddy\" (Ifan Dafydd remix) \u2013 4:59 ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\" | Chart (2011) ! scope=\"col\" | Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratip Flanders) | 12 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratop Flanders Dance) | 14 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratip Wallonia) | 8 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgium (Ultratop Wallonia Dance) | 23 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Finland (Suomen virallinen lista) | 5 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Dance Club Songs (Billboard) | 47 |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Country ! scope=\"col\"| Release date ! scope=\"col\"| Format(s) |- ! scope=\"row\"| United Kingdom | 27 November 2011 | |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2011 singles Category:Emeli Sand\u00e9 songs Category:Virgin Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Naughty Boy Category:Song recordings produced by Mojam Category:Songs written by Emeli Sand\u00e9 Category:Naughty Boy songs Category:Songs written by Naughty Boy Category:Songs written by Mustafa Omer Category:2011 songs ",
