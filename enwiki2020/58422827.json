    "text": "Cayetunya is a genus of leaf beetles in the subfamily Eumolpinae. It is known from Central and South America. It was first described by the Czech entomologist Jan Bechyn\u00e9 in 1958. Most species in this genus are known to display strong sexual dimorphism, such that males and females could be mistaken for separate genera. The female of C. clarki is unknown. ==Species== * Cayetunya breesi Bechyn\u00e9, 1958 \u2013 Trinidad, Venezuela * Cayetunya clarki Flowers, 1997 \u2013 Venezuela * Cayetunya colombiana Flowers, 1997 \u2013 Colombia * Cayetunya consanguinea (Blake, 1976) \u2013 Panama * Cayetunya tifferae Flowers, 1997 (incorrectly formed as C. tifferi) \u2013 Costa Rica to Honduras ==References== Category:Eumolpinae Category:Chrysomelidae genera Category:Beetles of Central America Category:Beetles of South America ",
