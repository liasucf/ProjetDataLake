This species was first described in 2019 by Luiz A. Rocha and colleagues, along with Chromis hangganan and Chromis gunting, discovered and known from Verde Island, Batangas Bay and Puerto Galera Bay, in the Philippines. ==Etymology== The specific name bowesi was bestowed in honor of the late William K. Bowes Jr.,(1926 - 2016), who was the main sponsor of the Hope for Reefs initiative, from California Academy of Sciences. ==Description== The largest specimen used to describe C. bowesi is about 8.2 cm. In its natural habitat, C. bowesi has a bluish purple body with light blue stripes just behind the pectoral fins. Spines on dorsal and pelvic fins are light blue to almost white, with the soft dorsal fin transparent. The upper body is darker than the sides of the body and under the abdomen. The under-eye area is silvery white. Dark spots on the base of pectoral fins. Photographs of newly dead specimens are dark gray brown in the upper body, turning gray in the remaining body area.
