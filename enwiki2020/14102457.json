    "text": "Sorbus hupehensis (Hupeh rowan or Hubei rowan; ) is a species of rowan native to central and western China (between Qinghai and Gansu in the west, Yunnan in the south, Jiangxi in the southeast, and Shandong in the east). It is a small deciduous tree growing to 5\u201310 m tall, with grey-brown to purplish-brown bark. The branches and shoots are slender. The leaves are green above, paler beneath, 10\u201315 cm long, pinnate with 7-17 narrow oval leaflets 3\u20135 cm long and 1\u20131.8 cm broad, with an acute apex, and serrated margins. They change to orange or red in autumn. The flowers are 5\u20137 mm diameter, with five white petals and 20 yellowish-white stamens; they are produced in corymbs 6\u201310 cm diameter in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a pome 5\u20138 mm diameter, bright pink with persistent sepals, maturing in late autumn. There are two varieties: *Sorbus hupehensis var. hupehensis. Leaves with 9-17 narrow leaflets. Most of the species' range. *Sorbus hupehensis var. paucijuga (D.K.Zang & P.C.Huang) L.T.Lu. Leaves with 7-9 broad leaflets. Shandong Province. ==Cultivation and uses== It is grown as an ornamental tree, valued for its white fruit contrasting with the orange autumn colour. In cultivation, it has often been confused with the related Sorbus glabrescens (white-fruited rowan) and Sorbus oligodonta (kite-leaf rowan) from southwestern China. The former differs in being a larger tree (to 15 m) with stouter shoots and larger leaves, the latter in having pale pink fruit; both are tetraploid apomictic species which breed true. The cultivar 'Pink Pagoda', often cited as belonging to S. hupehensis, is of S. oligodonta.Rushforth, K. (1999). Trees of Britain and Europe.
