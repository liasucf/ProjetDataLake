    "text": "Jun\u00e1k - \u010desk\u00fd skaut (Jun\u00e1k - Czech Scouting), is the internationally recognized organization of Scouts and Guides of the Czech Republic. Founded in 1911, Jun\u00e1k - \u010desk\u00fd skaut is the largest organisation of children and youth in the nation, with a membership of 64,383 (for 2019). ==History== A voluntary, non-political civic organization, without restriction to membership, Jun\u00e1k was founded in 1911 by Anton\u00edn Benjamin Svojs\u00edk, who, after visiting British Scouts, wanted to establish a similar movement in his homeland. In 1910, inspired by the writings of Baden-Powell, Svojs\u00edk wrote Z\u00e1klady jun\u00e1ctv\u00ed (\"The Foundations of Scouting\"), the first handbook for Scouts already operating in the Czech lands. In that book, he combined Baden-Powell's system of education; ideas of the American writer, traveller and painter Ernest Thompson Seton (founder of Woodcraft); and the traditions of the Czech nation. He followed this with an experimental camp in 1912. The participants walked the entire 200 km distance on foot, and their luggage was brought there on a single large push-cart. In the quickly developing world of Scouting at the time, Jun\u00e1k- \u010cesk\u00fd skaut provided a model to be followed by many other developing national associations. Scouting in the Czech Republic has a long and distinguished history. The independent organization Jun\u00e1k was established in June 1914, the same year its first Scouting newsletter was issued; the chairman was Dr. \u010cen\u011bk Klika and Svojs\u00edk was the Chief Scout. A month later World War I started and many leaders were called up to fight. In January 1915, the first Girl Scouts were introduced, under the leadership of Vlasta Koseov\u00e1, and shortly thereafter, a section for Guide Education was established. Dr. Anna Berkovcov\u00e1 became the Chief Guide. The same summer, the first Girl Guide company \"Anemones\" held a camp on the banks of river Vltava. In 1918, at the creation of the Czechoslovak Republic, the Czech Scouts offered their services, and helped the established government with many things, they kept patrol over important buildings and sites, but they are best known for their mail delivery service, delivering official mail in Prague. They had their own stamps, the first Scout stamps in the world, which are very rare and valuable today among stamp-collectors. On December 21, 1918, \"Czech Scout mail\" was restored, due to the arrival of President Masaryk from exile. The ranks of Scouting grew rapidly in the new country, and in 1922 a National Scout festival took place in Prague to commemorate 10 years of Scouting. Following the end of World War I, the different associations within Czechoslovakia came together in one united national association, and the Czechoslovakian Scout and Guide Federation was among the charter members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1922, with Svojs\u00edk elected to the World Committee. Before World War II, Jun\u00e1k had the third most members of any Scout Association in Europe, and numbered seventh in the world; by 1936 the number of Scouts in Czechoslovakia was 70,000. Jun\u00e1k bid to host the World Jamboree in 1933. The preparations started in earnest and in 1931 Czech Scouts prepared the \"All- Slavonic Jamboree\" as the test for the World Jamboree, a successful festival which culminated in a march through Prague and an address by President Masaryk at Prague castle. But in the end the World Jamboree was to take place in Hungary. Czech Scouts participated in all World Jamborees from the first in 1920 through 1937. At the 1937 World Jamboree in the Netherlands, the Jun\u00e1k contingent had 314 members. Anton\u00edn Benjamin Svojs\u00edk died on September 17, 1938. Czech Scouts and Guides unified on January 22, 1939 to found the new association called Jun\u00e1k. The Chief Scout was Dr. Rudolf Plajner and the Chief Guide was Vlasta Koseov\u00e1. Jun\u00e1k was abolished by force and Scouting prohibited by German State Secretary Karl Hermann Frank during the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia on October 28, 1940. Many Scouts and Guides joined the Czech Resistance; over 700 of them died during the war as part of the movement. After the war, the association was re-registered in Prague in 1945, following the country's liberation, with 120,000 members registered in 1946, the number of members grew to nearly 250,000, (making it the second largest association in the World Movements at that time), and in 1947, a contingent of 500 represented Jun\u00e1k at the World Scout Jamboree in France, sporting two Scout bands. In summer 1946, Lady Olave Baden-Powell visited Czechoslovakia and she was welcomes in the whole country by Scouts and Guides. After the war, in lieu of Scout camps, their participants helped in local agriculture. Chief Guide Vlasta Koseov\u00e1 became the Vice-chairman of the World Committee of WAGGGS and Chairman Dr. Velen Fanderlik was a member of the World Scout Committee of WOSM. However, in 1948, after the Communist coup, Jun\u00e1k was disbanded; beginning in 1949, trials were held against various Jun\u00e1k Commissioners, some of whom were sentenced to many years of imprisonment in communist concentration camps, where many of them died. Many Jun\u00e1k troops continued to meet in secret. In 1968, during the Prague Spring, Scouts and Guides again began meeting openly, until Jun\u00e1k was banned by order of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, in October 1970. During that period, the number of Scouts in Czechoslovakia was 65,000. Again, many Jun\u00e1k units continued to operate in secret. After the 1989 Velvet Revolution, Jun\u00e1k was one of the first organisations to re-emerge from working underground, by then, for the fourth time in its history. By the close of 1989, the number of Scouts in Czechoslovakia was 80,000. On 1 February 1990, the Federation of Czech and Slovak Scouting was officially registered, paving the way for its re- admittance to the World Organization during the World Scout Conference in Paris in July 1990, re-recognised by the major world Scouting organisations (see below). Upon Czechoslovakia's dissolution on December 31, 1992, \u010cesk\u00fd Jun\u00e1k (as it was then called) and Slovensk\u00fd skauting were required to apply for membership of the World Organization as the national member organizations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, respectively. On June 30, 1996, Jun\u00e1k - svaz skaut\u016f a skautek \u010cR was welcomed as the 141st member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. In 1998, Jun\u00e1k became one of the founding members of the Czech Council of Children and Youth, a national youth council that aims to protect the rights and interests of Czech young people. Membership in 2019 was 64,383 Scouts and Guides in the Czech Republic. During the summer of 2018, 1,039 camps were held. In 2001, Jun\u00e1k hosted the European Guide and Scout Conference, in Prague. ==Organisation and structure== Czech Scouts within Jun\u00e1k are members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM), the Guides are members of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), and the Adult Scouts and Guides of the International Scout and Guide Fellowship (ISGF). The \"Adult Scout and Guide Guild\", also known as \"Czech Scout and Guide Fellowship\", chanced their name in 2007 from \"The Old Scout Guild\" into \"The Adult Scout and Guide Guild\". The association has a total membership of some 64,000 operating in a country with a population of around 10.5 million people. Jun\u00e1k is a \"Scout and Guide National Organization\" in accordance with the Statement on Relationships between WAGGGS and WOSM. The organisational body of Jun\u00e1k is divided into 14 regions and below 80 districts, overseen by the National Assembly (14 elected, 17 appointed by regions and internal bodies), led by the Chief Scout and Chief Guide, who, in turn, appoint the president and the members of the executive committee of Jun\u00e1k. Communications between the districts and regions, and to Jun\u00e1k headquarters, includes monthly information packages sent to all groups, mostly by e-mail. ==Events== The Scouts and Guides in Jun\u00e1k organise many events on the national and local level. One of them is the Svojs\u00edk's Race, which takes place every two years. Jun\u00e1k hosted Intercamp in 1994, 2004 and 2016, and the Czech Rover Moot Obrok, every two years and the Water Scouts hold a national water-themed jamboree, Navigamus, every three years. Jun\u00e1k also organises monetary drives and information campaigns, e.g. in support of cancer research and development projects in Ethiopia. Every Christmas, Czech Scouts and Guides distribute the Bethlehem Light around the country. Jun\u00e1k publishes four magazines, for its various divisions, as well as various other materials, numbering roughly 15\u201320 different publications a year. The organisation also maintains Scout/Guide centres around the country, run by their respective districts and groups. Some of these are open to the public, for a nominal fee, as self-service accommodation. == Program== * Vl\u010data and Sv\u011btlu\u0161ky/Cubs and Fireflies - ages 6 to 10 * Skauti and Skautky/Scouts and Guides - ages 11 to 15 * Rove\u0159i/Rovers and Rangers - ages 15 to 26 As Native American symbology and mythology has been popular in Central Europe since the 1880s, the most known merit badge in Czech Scouting is the Three Feathers of Eagle, highest one is Lion Scout.

The musician Karel Kova\u0159ovic composed the Czech Scout anthem. === Scout Promise (Skautsk\u00fd slib) === Slibuji na svou \u010dest, jak dovedu nejl\u00e9pe: *slou\u017eit nejvy\u0161\u0161\u00ed Pravd\u011b a L\u00e1sce v\u011brn\u011b v ka\u017ed\u00e9 dob\u011b, *plnit povinnosti vlastn\u00ed a zachov\u00e1vat z\u00e1kony skautsk\u00e9, *du\u0161\u00ed i t\u011blem b\u00fdt p\u0159ipraven pom\u00e1hat vlasti a bli\u017en\u00edm.
