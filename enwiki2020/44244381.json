They described it as a transition from their precedent single \"Boss\" (2014).

In an interview with Official Charts Company, Trainor revealed that \"Sledgehammer\" was one of the songs she wrote for her solo debut album \u2013 later called Title (2015) \u2013 however, Epic Records decided to release \"All About That Bass\" as a lead single, so Trainor offered the song to Fifth Harmony. \"Sledgehammer\" is a heavy synthpop production backed by an electronic dance music (EDM) beat, taking influence from new wave and 1980s music. Lyrically, the song expresses the physical sensations of being infatuated, comparing it to a sledgehammer motif: \"If you take my pulse right now, it would feel just like a sledgehammer.\" Jessica Hyndman of MTV suggested that the song is about a kind of love that just \"can't be contained\". According to music sheet published at Musicnotes.com by BMG Rights Management, \"Sledgehammer\" is written in the key of G Major and is set in a common time at 100 bpm with an upbeat pop melody. The quintet's vocals span from G3 to F5 and follow a chord progression of C\u2013G\u2013D\u2013C\u2013Em\u2013D. ==Reception== ===Critical=== \"Sledgehammer\" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard praised the song's \"EDM-meets-new-wave beat\" and its \"immediate hook\", believing that \"Sledgehammer\" is \"the best pop track about the physical effects of lovesickness since Demi Lovato's \"Heart Attack\" (2013)\". It was tied as the best ranked song of the week, sharing the honor with \"Don't It\" (2014) by country singer Billy Currington. Mike Wass of Idolator called it \"a sugary sweet synth-pop anthem with serious radio appeal\". Jessica Hyndman from MTV noted that \"'Sledgehammer' takes on a fun pop vibe\" that lacked in the group's previous single, \"Boss\". A reviewer from Teen Vogue deemed the track as \"catchy\", while Carolyn Menyes from Music Times gave \"Sledgehammer\" a mixed review. She praised the group's performance, commending that their distinctive voices sound \"perfectly\", but expressed that the single fell \"completely into average territory.\" In a 2017 article published on Idolator, Mike Neid covered the song in the website's \"Should Have Been Gigger\" feature, stating that the track was one of the group's most \"underrated\" songs. Neid further commented on how their visuals were not as \"sexy\" as the music video for their 2016 single \"Work from Home\", but served as a \"joyful and chic\" reminder of their \"youthful beginnings.\" Billboard ranked the song at number 57 on their 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time list. Lipshutz stated that though one of the lines is \"more than a bit confusing\", the group manage to \"sell their tale of unsaid infatuation with dedicated melismas and gooey production\". In 2017, Billboard ranked \"Sledgehammer\" at number 57 on its list of 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time: Critics' Picks. ===Commercial performance=== Upon its release, \"Sledgehammer\" debuted on Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart at number 28. It peaked at number 21 in December 2014, becoming their highest position\u2013surpassing their debut single \"Miss Movin' On\" (2013) at the time.

It eventually rose to a peak of 40 in its fifth week on the chart, with sales of 85,000\u2013aided by a price reduction on digital download services, which reported a 277 percent spike in sales. This marked Fifth Harmony's best week sales, as well as their highest-charting single and first top 40 hit; It has since been surpassed by \"Worth It\" (2015) and \"Work from Home\" (2016). On June 26, 2015, \"Sledgehammer\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States for sales of one million units.

It was directed and choreographed by Fatima Robinson, who also directed the music video for \"Boss\". Scenes in the visual include a swing set, a unicorn sculpture, and a silhouetted man swinging a sledgehammer while the group is dressed in colorful dresses and silky hair. MTV released an exclusive behind- the-scenes video of \"Sledgehammer\" on November 21, 2014. In the music video, the members of Fifth Harmony portray themselves as silhouettes dancing in a background of blue and white shades. The video begins with the members of Fifth Harmony standing in a background of white and blue shades, where Camila Cabello takes her pulse, the band starts dancing and the screen goes dark. The group is subsequently standing in a pyramid stair, with Cabello moving her hands in rhythm of the song before switching back to the prior scene. Following this, the screen goes dark several times, switching from a shot of a shirtless man moving a sledgehammer and the members in the white and blue shade background. The next scene turns into color, revealing the faces of the group for the first time, with each pounding their heart with their hands as the lyric \"If you could take my pulse right now, it would feel like a sledgehammer\" is sung. Choreographed dance moves such as the members throwing their fists in the air and the shot between the shirtless man moving the sledgehammer are alternated. Another seen has the girls on a swing set/scaffolding area barefoot and wearing different dresses. Normani is in a light green dress, Ally Brooke is in a red dress, Camila is in an orange dress, Dinah Jane is in a purple dress, and Lauren Jauregui is in a blue dress. The screen then shows blue and orange colors, in a special effect mimicking lights moving around them. Final scenes shows the members individually singing, all wearing a different dress from the first shot. The video continues with repeating several scenes with the negative special effects becoming more present. In a different shot, the silhouette one of the group is seen with a fan blowing air towards her, waving her hair and dress simultaneously. The video rewinds the moment the shirtless man breaks pieces of brick apart to make it seem as if though the pieces are reforming, similar to when one is going through heartbreak. Writing for Billboard, Lipshutz said the video's monochromatic setting allows the group to \"demonstrate their maturity\". He also states that the video is \"more of a relax fest\" and called the \"giddiness radiation\" of the girls \"pretty infectious\". As of July 2020, the video has surpassed over 170 million views. ==Live performances== On November 9, 2014, Fifth Harmony performed \"Sledgehammer\" for the first time at the pre-show of the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards. The following week, the group performed the song on Good Morning America and performed an acoustic version on Access Hollywood Live. Nearly a month later, the group performed a stripped down jazz version on VH1's Big Morning Buzz Live and closed the year by performing the song on \"Pitbull's New Year's Revolution\" that aired on Fox. Upon the release of Reflection, the group performed the song on The Today Show on February 3, 2015 and on The Talk. Several weeks later, the group presented the song on Sunrise while promoting the album in Australia and on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Sledgehammer also appeared on the set list for Fifth Harmony's performances at the 2015 New York, New York; Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; and Sunrise, Florida Jingle Ball concerts.
