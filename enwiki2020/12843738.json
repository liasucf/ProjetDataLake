    "text": "\"Apologize\" (also spelled \"Apologise\" internationally) is the debut single written by OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder for OneRepublic's debut album Dreaming Out Loud. It was released as the lead single of that album. A remix version was included on the Timbaland album, Shock Value, and on the deluxe version of Dreaming Out Loud. The song was the biggest radio airplay hit in the history of the Mainstream Top 40 chart in North America, with 10,394 plays in one week, until its record was broken by Leona Lewis's \"Bleeding Love\", which was also co-written by Tedder. The song was a major hit internationally, reaching number one in 16 countries, including Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Sweden, Turkey, and the Netherlands, as well as staying at number one for eight consecutive weeks on the Billboard Pop 100 chart. The song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, staying in the top-10 for 25 weeks, and spent 13 weeks at number one in Canada. \"Apologize\" earned the band a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and was ranked number 50 on the list of the Billboard Hot 100's All-Time Top Songs list from the chart's first 50 years. It spent 25 consecutive weeks in the top 10, the longest stay there for any song since \"Smooth\" by Santana, which spent 30 weeks in 1999. It was also ranked number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 Songs of the Decade. It was OneRepublic's biggest hit single in the United States until \"Counting Stars\" was released in 2013. == Timbaland version == Timbaland remixed the song for his second studio album, Shock Value (2007). This version, also produced by Greg Wells, included an extra line of percussion, new backing vocals, and added sound samples, in addition to sound mixing and various other minor changes. The guitar solo after the second verse was omitted, completing its transformation to a more R&B; style to fit with Shock Value. When the remix debuted, on the back of the strong Timbaland name, radio outlets announced the artist for the song as \"Timbaland\" or \"Timbaland with OneRepublic\". As the song gained popularity, it was changed to \"Timbaland Presents OneRepublic\". === Music video === An official video associated with the remix was filmed on September 19, 2007, and released in early October. The video premiered on VH1's Top 20 Countdown on October 27, 2007. The video was directed by Robert Hales and was shot in a recording studio showing OneRepublic performing the song. The video also includes scenes from a New Year's Eve countdown party, starring actor Brian A. Pollack. In a third version of the video, also directed by Robert Hales and associated with the remix, Timbaland is portrayed remixing the song himself. A European version of the video features clips of the film Keinohrhasen, starring Til Schweiger. A Japanese version of the video was also made available for a short time. It features the same footage as the original but has more scenes from different camera angles. It also features footage of people falling and floating in the air in slow motion. The music video currently has 294.31 million views.(The Video must be on the account of OneRepublic channel but it is on Timbaland's channel) === Track listing === ; CD single #1 # \"Apologize\" \u2013 3:04 # \"Give It To Me\" \u2013 3:16 ; CD single #2 # \"Apologize\" \u2013 3:04 # \"Apologize\" \u2013 3:27 # \"The Way I Are\" \u2013 4:03 # \"Apologize\" \u2013 3:10 ; Australian CD single # \"Apologize\" \u2013 3:04 # \"Apologize\" \u2013 3:27 == Chart performance == \"Apologize\" was OneRepublic's breakout hit.
