The season two of the series stars Maria Jo\u00e3o Abreu, D\u00e2nia Neto, Jorge Corrula and Diana Chaves. == Plot == Crime in Alvorinha! On the floor of the wide, one body. People around. We realize it's our Euromillionaire. Panic! The Garcia are in shock, crying for help ... until Carlos (Pedro Laginha) and Alice (Diana Chaves) arrive, who introduces himself to Teresa (Oceana Bas\u00edlio) husband for the first time. They both try to save C\u00e9u's (Maria Jo\u00e3o Abreu) life from heaven. Will they be able to avoid tragedy? Tragic, little Beatriz (Matilde Serr\u00e3o) life. Frightened, she is in the Nobrega's house to ask Teresa to protect her from her parents. Priest An\u00edbal (Diogo Amaral), Teresa and Claudio (Duarte Gomes) try to solve the drama of the girl, calling Dalia (Andreia Dinis) and Serafim (Frederico Barata) but the conversation does not go well. The suspicious behavior of Bia's parents suggests a dark past... With the guilts of the past, Jessica (Carolina Carvalho) is desolate after seeing the marriage broken. The father Jos\u00e9 Luis (Jos\u00e9 Raposo) tries to comfort her but it is Preciosa (Manuela Maria), the grandmother of the bride, who ends up having the right words. Nothing like a person full of shadows to understand each other's sins. Especially if it's a Toledo... The Garcia saw an ambulance take C\u00e9u to the Hospital. Meanwhile, the police arrive and start questioning those present. The first is Ricardo (Ant\u00f3nio Camelier), who tries to warn them about the villains S\u00edlvia (D\u00e2nia Neto) and Caio (Jorge Corrula) but, without proof, ends up pointing the focus of guilt to himself. Realizing that they have nothing against her, S\u00edlvia, who still has no passport, finally insinuates to the police that the abduction of Telma (Isabela Valadeiro) was orchestrated by... Ricardo. In this ping pong game, who can win? Who does not want to lose the track to Tino (Jo\u00e3o Paulo Rodrigues) is Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds who goes to the arrumos room to confront the lover of the daughter but finds an empty room. Tino, humbled by the situation, had fled far, eventually finding and being comforted by... Branca (Sara Norte). What can come out of the relationship of these two? After a long time in the expectation, the Garcia know by Bruno (\u00c2ngelo Rodrigues) that the euromillionaire is stabilized thanks to the intervention of the new doctor, Alice Barreto. Heaven finally goes to the palace but... can not speak. Did our protagonist remain forever silent? In the last plane, we see a hand with S\u00edlvia's passport. Who could be maneuvering in silence? == Cast == === Main Cast === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" ! style=\"background:#84BE84;\" | Actor/Actress ! style=\"background:#84BE84;\" | Characters |- |Maria Jo\u00e3o Abreu |Maria do C\u00e9u Garcia |- |D\u00e2nia Neto |S\u00edlvia Mira/Miriam Barbosa Sousa Vale |- |Jorge Corrula |Caio Amaral/Jorge Montalv\u00e3o |- |Diana Chaves |Leonor Alves Craveiro/Alice Barreto |- |Isabela Valadeiro |Telma Garcia |- |\u00c2ngelo Rodrigues |Bruno Garcia |- |Manuela Maria |Preciosa Toledo |- |Jos\u00e9 Raposo |Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Toledo |- |Rui Mendes |Nat\u00e1rio Garcia |- |Carmen Santos |L\u00facia Garcia |- |Carolina Carvalho |J\u00e9ssica Toledo |} === Recurrent Cast === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" ! style=\"background:#84BE84;\" | Actor/Actress ! style=\"background:#84BE84;\" | Characters |- |V\u00edtor Norte |Hor\u00e1cio Toledo |- |Henriqueta Maya |Cremilde Reis |- |Helena Laureano |Rosanne Toledo |- |Rosa do Canto |Am\u00e1lia Reis |- |Ana Bustorff |Madre Ros\u00e1rio |- |Ana Guiomar |Patr\u00edcia Cruz |- |Jo\u00e3o Paulo Rodrigues |Justino \u00abTino\u00bb Sanganha |- |Oceana Bas\u00edlio |Teresa Dantas |- |Diogo Amaral |Padre An\u00edbal Dantas |- |Pedro Laginha |Carlos Alberto Nobrega |- |Duarte Gomes |Cl\u00e1udio Toledo |- |Cec\u00edlia Henriques |Graciete Pompeu |- |Ant\u00f3nio Camelier |Ricardo Assun\u00e7\u00e3o |- |Jo\u00e3o Paulo Sousa |Xavier Reis |- |Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pereira |V\u00edtor \u00abVitinho\u00bb |- |Miguel Raposo |Duarte Godinho/Vasco |- |Ricardo Carri\u00e7o |Gon\u00e7alo Vasques |- |Sara Norte |Branca Lucena |- |In\u00eas Monteiro |C\u00edntia Novais |- |Adriane Garcia |Kelly Lazzaro |- |Elsa Valentim |Eug\u00e9nia Alves Craveiro |- |Paulo Matos |Alfredo Nogueira |} === Guest Star Cast === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\" ! style=\"background:#84BE84;\" | Actor/Actress ! style=\"background:#84BE84;\" | Characters ! style=\"background:#84BE84;\" | Episode Number |- |Cl\u00e1udio Ramos |Himself |Episode 34 |- |Toy |Himself |Episode 46 |- |Maria Botelho Moniz |Jogador |Episode 50 |- |} == Episodes == == References == Category:Portuguese television series Category:Sociedade Independente de Comunica\u00e7\u00e3o original programming ",
