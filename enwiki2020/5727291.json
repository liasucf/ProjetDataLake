Patparganj has remained the Delhi Legislative Assembly constituency with East Delhi, Lok Sabha constituency, from 1993 to 2008, and remained after the delimitation of 2008. ==History== Patparganj in 1777 map of Delhi and Agra area In the 18th century, Patparganj was a flourishing town and an important grain market of Delhi, where wholesale grain merchants stayed and large enclosures were built to store grain from the doab region and ferried across Yamuna River into Paharganj market, and the walled city of Shahjahanabad (Old Delhi) markets. Towards the end of the reign of Ahmad Shah as his political fortunes declined, and Delhi was wrought by internal fighting, the Mughal empire owed a debt of 15 lakhs to the Najib Khan Rohilla and Bahadur Khan Balauch, thus a settlement was reached and the revenue of village in the Ganges\u2013Yamuna doab was assigned to them. However, on 26 November 1753, they left Delhi. After crossing the Yamuna, they captured Patparganj and seized the headman and the toll-offices. They left only after they received a ransom of Rs. 35,000. Much of the town was destroyed during the period. In later history, Patparganj was the location of the Battle of Delhi, which took place on 11 September 1803 during the Second Anglo-Maratha War, between British troops under General Lake, and Marathas of Scindia's army under General Louis Bourquin, also giving the battle its local name, Battle of Patparganj. After the British victory, the city of Delhi surrendered three days later. Patparganj was almost a deserted town for years to come.Fanshawe, p. 69Fanshawe, p. 232 A monument was later erected at the site, marked out by a surrounding ditch, commemorating Maj. Middleton (3rd Bengal Cavalry), Cornet Sanguine (27th Light Dragoons) and British soldiers who fell during the battle. The monument today stands as a well maintained sandstone slab at the Noida Golf Course and maintained by the authority. Post-independence, Patparganj saw rapid development as Delhi spilled into the trans-Yamuna area, and by the 1990s, many apartment complexes and society apartment blocks had come up. Meanwhile, 175 acres of land was allocated to various group housing societies, previously earmarked for the development of an industrial area in the Delhi Master Plan. In 2010, a 690-m long six-lane flyover opened near the Patparganj Industrial Area', between Anand Vihar and Ghazipur crossing, to decongest traffic in the area. ==Overview== Patparganj (Indraprastha Extension) is home to a large number of group housing societies, and many multi-storeyed apartment blocks. Well-connected with neighbouring residential colonies, its nearby areas are Preet Vihar, Nirman Vihar, Laxmi Nagar, Pandav Nagar and Mayur Vihar. Parparganj is also known for its industrial area known as Patparganj industrial area.
