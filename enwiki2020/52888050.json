    "text": "Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone is a 1997 cook book by Deborah Madison. It contains 1,400 vegetarian recipes from soups to desserts. ==Reception== In 2017 Washington Post Food Editor Joe Yonan listed it as one of three must-have classic vegetarian cookbooks. In a review of Vegetarian Cooking For Everyone, Gourmet magazine wrote \"Before you even read a word, the clean type, elegant, well-organized layout, and helpful illustrations reassure you that you won't be pulling your hair out trying to follow a recipe. And then Madison's warm, knowledgeable prose pulls you in.\" Michael Ruhlman noted \"For all these reasons, in the 17 years I've been writing about cooks and cooking, I have purchased a single cookbook, several years ago, for myself, a single book to inspire me and broaden my culinary imagination: \"Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone,\" by Deborah Madison, ..\" and The New Yorker \"found Madison to be a charming and non-threatening psychopomp into the realm of what I imagined to be the half-dead, the eaters of what she frequently calls \u201cplant food,\u201d which, to me, sounded like \u201cfish food.\u201d\" Publishers Weekly gave a starred review writing \"Many have tried to create a reliable, encyclopedic vegetarian cookbook, but few have succeeded. Madison (The Greens Cookbook; The Savory Way) comes through with a weighty volume..\" and called it an \"incredibly complete and triumphant effort.\" ==Awards== *1998 IACP Cookbook of the Year - winner *1998 James Beard Vegetarian Book Award - winner *2008 Gourmet August Cookbook Club Pick ==The New Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone== In 2014 Madison brought out a revised version about which The Wall Street Journal wrote \"Ms. Madison shows herself to be a formidable teacher not just of vegetarian cooking but of imaginative cooking generally.\" == See also == * Vegetarian cuisine ==References== Category:1997 non-fiction books Category:American cookbooks Category:Vegetarian cookbooks ",
