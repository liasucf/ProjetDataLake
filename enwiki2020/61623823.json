    "text": "Xindu Commandery () was a historical commandery of China, located in modern southern Hebei. The commandery was created in early Western Han dynasty. In 155 BC, the territory was granted to Liu Pengzu (\u5289\u5f6d\u7956), son of the Emperor Jing, as the Principality of Guangchuan (\u5ee3\u5ddd\u570b). Later, Pengzu acquired the new title Prince of Zhao, and the principality was granted to Liu Yue, another son of the emperor. In 50 BC, the principality was abolished and reverted to a commandery.Book of Han, Chapter 53. In 37 BC, the territory was granted to Liu Xing (\u5289\u8208), son of the reigning Emperor Yuan, whose descendants held the fief until Wang Mang's usurpation.Book of Han, Chapter 80. After the restoration of Eastern Han, the commandery again became known as Xindu. In 72 AD, it was granted to Liu Dang (\u5289\u9ee8), son of the reigning Emperor Ming as the Principality of Lecheng (\u6a02\u6210\u570b). After 122 AD, it became known as the Principality of Anping (\u5b89\u5e73\u570b). The principality was dissolved in 184 AD, and it was subsequently administered as the Anping Commandery (\u5b89\u5e73\u90e1).Book of Later Han, Chapter 50. In 2 AD, it administered 17 counties, namely Xindu (\u4fe1\u90fd), Li (\u6b77), Fuliu (\u6276\u67f3), Piyang (\u8f9f\u967d), Nangong (\u5357\u5bae), Xiabo (\u4e0b\u535a), Wuyi (\u6b66\u9091), Guanjin (\u89c0\u6d25), Gaodi (\u9ad8\u9684), Guangchuan (\u5ee3\u5ddd), Lexiang (\u6a02\u9109), Pingdi (\u5e73\u9684), Tao (\u6843), Xiliang (\u897f\u6881), Changcheng (\u660c\u6210), Dongchang (\u6771\u660c) and Xiu (\u8129). The population was 304,384 or 65,556 households in 2 AD, and 655,118 (91,440 households) in 140 AD.Book of Han, Chapter 28.Book of Later Han, Chapter 110. During early Western Jin dynasty, Anping again briefly became an principality and was granted to Sima Fu, brother of Sima Yi. Xindu County in Anping was also the capital of Ji Province.Book of Wei, Chapter 106. In 280 AD, the principality had a population of 21,000 households in 8 counties. Later during Jin dynasty, it became Changle Commandery (\u9577\u6a02\u90e1).Book of Jin, Chapter 14. The commandery was abolished in early Sui dynasty. In Sui and Tang dynasties, Xindu Commandery became the alternative name of Ji Prefecture (\u5180\u5dde). In 742 AD, the prefecture had 9 counties: Xindu, Nangong, Tangyang (\u5802\u967d), Zaoqiang (\u68d7\u5f37), Wuyi (\u6b66\u9091), Hengshui (\u8861\u6c34), Fucheng (\u961c\u57ce), Tiao (\u84da) and Wuqiang (\u6b66\u5f37).
