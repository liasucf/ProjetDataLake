    "text": "Olympos is a science fiction novel by American writer Dan Simmons published in 2005; it is the sequel to Ilium and final part of the Ilium/Olympos series. Like its predecessor it contains many literary references: it blends together Homer's epics the Iliad and the Odyssey, Shakespeare's The Tempest, and has frequent smaller references to other works, including Proust, James Joyce, Caliban upon Setebos, Shelley's Prometheus Unbound, Shakespearean poetry and even William Blake and Virgil's Aeneid. ==Plot introduction== The novel centers on three main character groups; that of the scholic Hockenberry, Helen and Greek and Trojan warriors from the Iliad; Daeman, Harman, Ada and the other humans of Earth; and the moravecs, specifically Mahnmut the Europan and Orphu of Io. The novel is written in present-tense when centered on Hockenberry's character, but features third-person, past-tense narrative in all other instances. Much like Simmons' Hyperion where the actual events serve as a frame, the three groups of characters' stories are told over the course of the novel and their stories do not begin to converge until the end. ==References to the real world== The \"Paris Crater\" location (a devastated French capital) includes a few references to the real world, supposedly produced by folk etymology such as \"Invalid Hotel\" for \"H\u00f4tel des Invalides\", \"Champs Ulysses\" for \"Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\" or \"Guarded Lion\" for \"Gare de Lyon\". A single reference in passing is made to the mountain \"Pikespik\" (for \"Pikes Peak\"). ==References== ==External links== * Olympos on Worlds Without End Category:2005 American novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Sequel novels Category:Novels by Dan Simmons Category:Science fantasy novels Category:Novels set on Mars Category:Greco-Roman mythology in popular culture Category:HarperCollins books Category:Novels based on the Odyssey Category:2005 science fiction novels Category:Novels based on the Iliad Category:Works based on The Tempest Category:Modern adaptations of the Odyssey Category:Modern adaptations of works by William Shakespeare Category:Modern adaptations of the Iliad ",
