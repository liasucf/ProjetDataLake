Jewel case. ==Notes== ===Recording=== Recorded on all analogue equipment in real time with each track recorded on a one track per day basis with no overdubs or edits on a 2 track recording machine within Studio 2. Rather than a stereo mix being mixed down into a mono version both stereo and mono mixes were recorded separately within the same session on the same day. Mistakes made during the recording sessions resulted in immediate retakes thus multiple versions of all tracks exist in EMI's tape vaults. All the tracks were recorded in several sessions over a 6-month period, in 8 session-days, during which other singles (e.g. Guitar Tango, All Day, What a Lovely Tune, Groanin' (unissued), Les Girls (Cliff LP), Round and Round (Cliff LP)); EPs such as The Boys (EP) - 4 tracks) were intermediately recorded as well. # Spring Is Nearly Here (recording-date-no.1a=26/1/62) # The Bandit (recording-date-no.1b=26/1/62) # Cosy (recording-date-no.2=5/4/62) # Perfidia (recording-date-no.3a=12/4/62) # South of the Border (recording-date-no.3b=12/4/62) # Little B (recording-date- no.4a=22/5/62) # The Bandit (recording-date-no.4b=22/5/62) # Are They All Like You (recording-date-no.5=28/5/62) # Bo Diddley (recording-date-no.6a=31/5/62) # The Rumble (recording-date-no.6b=31/5/62) # Tales of a Raggy Tramline (recording-date-no.7=19/12/61) # 1861 (recording-date-no.8a=4/6/62) # Kinda Cool (recording-date-no.8b=4/6/62) This was the first Shadows album to feature Brian Licorice Locking, who replaced Jet Harris midway through the album's creation. The album is also the first album for Brian Bennett. ===Style=== The British public in 1961-62 anticipated an all instrumental second album but the Shadows and Paramor wanted to produce an album showcasing their numerous diverse talents instead. The album nevertheless features 6 (out of 13) all new original compositions written by all members of the Shadows in various permutations. By contrast, the second album of rival instrumental rock band The Ventures was an all instrumental one. The album is also much slower and smoother than the previous album. ===Release and reception=== The album reached the no. 1 slot in the UK album charts in 1962. No singles were released from it, though 2 EPs were: \"Out of the Shadows\" and \"Out of the Shadows no.2\" both in mono and stereo. Only track Little B has been used to promote this album when on tour in 1962 and has been used as first choice Shadows drum solo for live concerts from 1962 to 2004. ==Bibliography== ;Books *1.
