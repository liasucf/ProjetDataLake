    "text": "Microtralia insularis is a species of minute air-breathing land snail, a marine pulmonate gastropod mollusc in the family Ellobiidae. In Powell, 1979, this species was referred to as Rangitotoa insularis. However, the genus Rangitotoa is now considered to be an invalid synonym of Microtralia, and Rangitotoa insularis an invalid synonym of Microtralia occidentalis.Climo, F.M. 1982: The systematic status of Auricula (Alexia) meridionalis Brazier, 1877 and Rangitotoa insularis Powell, 1933 (Mollusca: Pulmonata: Ellobiidae) in Australasia. National Museum of New Zealand records, 2(6): 43-48. The latter name is considered by some sources to be an invalid synonym of Microtralia ovulum (sometimes spelled Microtralia ovula), while other sources treat all three nominal species, including Microtralia insularis, as valid.Rosenberg, G. (2012). Microtralia. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=415641 on 2012-07-09 There does not appear to be any published reason to doubt Climo's (1982) synonymies. ==References== * Powell A.
