The Heian period scholar Minamoto no Shitag\u014d (\u6e90\u9806, 911\u2013983 CE) began compilation in 934, at the request of Emperor Daigo's daughter. This Wamy\u014d ruijush\u014d title is abbreviated as Wamy\u014dsh\u014d, and has graphic variants of \u548c\u540d\u985e\u805a\u6284 with wa \u548c \"harmony; Japan\" for wa \u502d \"dwarf; Japan\" and \u502d\u540d\u985e\u805a\u9214 with sh\u014d \u9214 \"copy; summarize\" for sh\u014d \u6284 \"copy; annotate\". The Wamy\u014d ruijush\u014d is the oldest extant Japanese dictionary organized into semantic headings, analogous to a Western language thesaurus. This ancient lexicographical collation system was developed in Chinese dictionaries like the Erya, Xiao Erya, and Shiming. The Wamy\u014dsh\u014d categorizes kanji vocabulary, primarily nouns, into main headings (bu \u90e8) divided into subheadings (rui \u985e). For instance, the tenchi (\u5929\u5730 \"heaven and earth\") heading includes eight semantic divisions like seishuku (\u661f\u5bbf \"stars and constellations\"), un'u (\u96f2\u96e8 \"clouds and rain\"), and f\u016bsetsu (\u98a8\u96ea \"wind and snow\"). Each dictionary entry gives the Chinese character, sources cited, Chinese pronunciations (with either a homonym or fanqie spelling), definitions, and corresponding Japanese readings (in the ancient Man'y\u014dgana system using kanji to represent Japanese pronunciation). It cites over 290 sources, both Chinese (for example, the Shuowen Jiezi) and Japanese (the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b). The Wamy\u014d ruijush\u014d, survives in both a 10-volume edition (\u5341\u5dfb\u672c) and a 20-volume edition (\u4e8c\u5341\u5dfb\u672c). The larger one was published in 1617 with a commentary by Nawa D\u014den (\u90a3\u6ce2\u9053\u5186, 1595\u20131648) and was used in the Edo period until the 1883 publication of the 10-volume edition annotated by Kariya Ekisai (\u72e9\u8c37\u68ed\u9f4b, 1775\u20131835), also known as the Sench\u016b Wamy\u014d ruijush\u014d (\u7b8b\u6ce8\u502d\u540d\u985e\u805a\u6284 \"Annotated commentary to the Wamy\u014d ruijush\u014d\"). The 10-volume edition has 24 main headings divided into a total of 128 subheadings, while the 20-volume version has 32 and 249, respectively. The table below illustrates how words are semantically categorized in the 10-volume edition. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Subject headings in the 1883 Wamy\u014d ruijush\u014d ! ! R\u014dmaji ! Kanji !

In the present day, it provides linguists and historians with an invaluable record of the Japanese language over a thousand years ago.
