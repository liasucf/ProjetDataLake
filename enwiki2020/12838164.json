    "text": "Wildlife is the third studio album by the British band Mott the Hoople. The album was originally released in 1971; in the UK by Island Records (catalogue number ILPS 9144) and in the US by Atlantic Records (cat. no. SD 8284). It was subsequently re-released by Angel Air in 2003 SJPCD159. It reached No. 44 in the UK Albums Chart in April 1971. ==Critical reception== Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album four stars out of five and stated: ==Track listing== ===Side one=== # \"Whiskey Women\" (Mick Ralphs) \u2013 3:42 # \"Angel of Eighth Avenue\" (Ian Hunter) \u2013 4:33 # \"Wrong Side of the River\" (Ralphs) \u2013 5:19 # \"Waterlow\" (Hunter) \u2013 3:03 # \"Lay Down\" (Melanie Safka) \u2013 4:13 ===Side two=== # \"It Must Be Love\" (Ralphs) \u2013 2:24 # \"Original Mixed-Up Kid\" (Hunter) \u2013 3:40 # \"Home Is Where I Want to Be\" (Ralphs) \u2013 4:11 # \"Keep a Knockin' (live at Fairfield Halls, Croydon, 13 September 1970)\" (Richard Penniman) \u2013 10:10 (*) (*) This track is a rock and roll medley that, in addition to \"Keep A Knockin'\", also includes snippets of \"I Got A Woman\" (by Ray Charles), \"What'd I Say\" (Charles) and \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" (Jerry Lee Lewis). On the recording, however, singer Ian Hunter incorrectly introduces \"What'd I Say\" as being written by Jerry Lee Lewis. ===2003 CD bonus tracks=== # * \"It'll Be Me\" (Jack Clement) \u2013 2.58 # \"Long Red\" (Leslie West, Felix Pappalardi, John Ventura, Norman Landsberg) \u2013 3.47 ===2018 CD bonus track=== In 2018, as part of a boxed set of Island era material, Whiskey Women was issued under its original title of Brain Haulage. This is an unedited take, with the guitar power-chords mixed higher. It's heavier, and closer to the live versions of the song. ==Personnel== ===Mott the Hoople=== * Ian Hunter \u2013 lead vocals (tracks 2, 4, 5, 7, 9), and backing vocals, rhythm guitar, piano * Mick Ralphs \u2013 lead guitar, lead vocals (tracks 1, 3, 6, 8), backing vocals * Verden Allen \u2013 organ, backing vocals * Pete \"Overend\" Watts \u2013 bass, backing vocals * Dale \"Buffin\" Griffin \u2013 drums, backing vocals ===Additional personnel=== * Jerry Hogan \u2013 steel guitar on \"It Must Be Love\" and \"Original Mixed-Up Kid\" * Jess Roden \u2013 background chorus on \"Lay Down\" * Stan Tippins \u2013 background chorus on \"Lay Down\" * Michael Gray \u2013 string arrangements and conductor on \"Waterlow\" * Jim Archer \u2013 violin on \"Angel of Eighth Avenue\" ===Technical=== * Andy Johns, Brian Humphries, Phill Brown \u2013 engineers * Brian Cooke \u2013 photography ==Charts== ===Album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Chart !Position !Weeks on chart |- |1971 |Official Charts (UK) |align=\"center\"|44 |align=\"center\"|2 |} ==References== Category:1971 albums Category:Mott the Hoople albums Category:Albums produced by Guy Stevens Category:Island Records albums ",
