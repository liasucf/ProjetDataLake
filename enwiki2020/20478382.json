    "text": "The four scattered and poorly attested Alumic languages form a branch of the Plateau languages of central Nigeria. ==Classification== The following classification is taken from Blench (2008). The languages are not closely related and are morphologically quite diverse due to different contact situations; given the poor state of their description, their relationship is provisional. Ethnologue scatters these languages throughout Plateau: Hasha and Sambe with Eggon (Southern branch), and Alumu\u2013Tesu and Toro as two independent branches. Blench (2019) also includes Nigbo (extinct). ==Names and locations== Below is a list of language names, populations, and locations from Blench (2019). {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" | style=\"font-size: 85%;\" | !
