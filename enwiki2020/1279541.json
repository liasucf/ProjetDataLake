    "text": "Cut is an album by Dutch hard rock band Golden Earring, released in 1982 (see 1982 in music). The album spawned the hit song \"Twilight Zone,\" which reached #1 in the Netherlands and #1 in the United States on Billboards Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks (it reached #10 on the Billboard Hot 100.) The album's cover image is the 1964 photo Cutting the Card Quickly taken by M.I.T. Professor \"Doc\" Edgerton showing the jack of diamonds playing card being shredded by a bullet. The image is used in the music video of \"Twilight Zone\" in which the card represents the life of the rogue espionage agent. A music video was also made to support the second single released from the album, \"The Devil Made Me Do It.\" However, the song and video saw limited airplay in the United States, because its lyrics contain the word \"bullshit.\" ==Track listing== All songs written by Hay and Kooymans except where noted. # \"The Devil Made Me Do It\" \u2013 3:25 # \"Future\" (Kooymans) \u2013 5:25 # \"Baby Dynamite\" (Hay) \u2013 5:15 # \"Last of the Mohicans\" \u2013 4:09 # \"Lost and Found\" (Gerritsen, Hay) \u2013 4:00 # \"Twilight Zone\" (Kooymans) \u2013 7:58 # \"Chargin' Up My Batteries\" \u2013 4:17 # \"Secrets\" (Hay) \u2013 4:04 ==Personnel== ===Golden Earring=== * Rinus Gerritsen - bass, keyboards * Barry Hay - guitar, vocals * George Kooymans - guitar, vocals * Cesar Zuiderwijk - drums Additional personnel * Robert Jan Stips - synthesizer ===Production=== * Producer: Shell Schellekens * Engineer: John Kriek * Digital mastering: Dick Van Leeuwen * Horn arrangements: Hans Hollestelle * Photography: Harold Edgerton, Kees Tabak * Lettering: Koos O. ==Charts== Album - Billboard (United States) {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|Top LPs & Tape (Billboard) |align=\"left\"|24 |- |} Singles - Billboard (United States) {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Single !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|\"Twilight Zone\" |align=\"left\"|Top Tracks (Billboard) |align=\"left\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|\"Twilight Zone\" |align=\"left\"|Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"left\"|10 |- |align=\"left\"|1983 |align=\"left\"|\"The Devil Made Me Do It\" |align=\"left\"|Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"left\"|79 |- |} ==References== Category:Golden Earring albums Category:1982 albums Category:Capitol Records albums Category:Mercury Records albums Category:PolyGram albums ",
