    "text": "The Kingdom of Opona is a mythical kingdom in Russian folklore, envisioned by Russian peasants as lying at the edge of the flat earth. Here, it was believed, the peasants lived happy lives undisturbed by the state or the gentry,Figes, p. 101 under a \"White Tsar\" who ruled truly and justly.Ellwood, p. 97 It was also known under the names of the Golden Land, Land of Chud, and Belovodye. The myth of the Utopian kingdom of old Russia is similar to other myths of \"earthly paradises\", out of sight but possibly reachable by the right courageous explorer, such as Shambhala, El Dorado, etc. Groups of peasants were even known to have gone on expeditions in the far north of Russia to find the mythical utopia. Dubbed \"Wanderers\", they spent their lives trying to discover the hidden paradise, which it was said could be reached by those who searched diligently enough. ==See also== *Buyan *Iriy *Kitezh *Cockaigne ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:Locations in Slavic mythology Category:Mythological kingdoms, empires, and countries Category:Russian folklore Category:Utopias ",
