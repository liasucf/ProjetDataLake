The Wisconsin Marching Band plays it and the students sing the \"O-OOOOO-O-O-O-O-O-O-O\" part of the song ending it with the word \"sucks\" to refer to section \"O\" of the student section, the \"sucks\" is chanted by other student sections especially section P, this is usually followed by a chant of \"fuck you, eat shit\" by student sections O and P.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMX6Kd6lWno Despite the song being popular among the students, several attempts to have the song banned by the UW staff and the Chancellor have been attempted due to the controversial \"fuck you, eat shit\" chant, but the banning of the song has so far proven to be unsuccessful. Steve Miller, himself a graduate of the University of Wisconsin and vocalist of the Steve Miller Band guest conducted the song with The Wisconsin Marching Band.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Msujx_kA_LY ==Inspiration for Ozzy Osbourne's \"Crazy Train\"== Guitarist Greg Leon, who initially took Randy Rhoads' place in Quiet Riot, claims that the iconic verse riff to Ozzy Osbourne's \"Crazy Train\" came about when he and Rhoads were messing around with \"Swingtown\". \u201cWe were hanging out, and I showed him the riff to Steve Miller\u2019s \"Swingtown\". I said: \"Look what happens when you speed this riff up\". We messed around, and the next thing I know he took it to a whole other level and end up writing the \"Crazy Train\" riff.\u201d ==References== ==External links== * Lyrics of this song * Category:1977 songs Category:1977 singles Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Steve Miller Band songs Category:Songs about dancing Category:Fictional populated places ",
