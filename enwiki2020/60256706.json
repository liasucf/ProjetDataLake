In the words of the Colombian president, who made the announcement on 14 January 2019, PROSUR would be \"a South American coordination mechanism for public policies, in defense of democracy, the independence of powers, the market economy, the social agenda, with sustainability and with due application\". On 18 February 2019, the President of Chile, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, said \"this new forum will be open to all South American countries that meet two requirements: full validity of the rule of law and full respect for freedoms and human rights\". It has been characterised as a right-wing response to the left-wing UNASUR. ==Summits== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\" !Year !# !Date !Place !Host |- |2019 |1st |22 March |Santiago, Chile |Sebastian Pi\u00f1era |- |} The first PROSUR Summit, called the \"Meeting of Presidents of South America\", took place on 22 March 2019 in Santiago, Chile.
