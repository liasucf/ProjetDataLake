    "text": "Ames Hall, Green Mountain College, November 2013 Green Mountain College was a private liberal arts college in Poultney, Vermont, United States, at the foot of the Taconic Mountains between the Green Mountains and Adirondacks. The college was affiliated with the United Methodist Church and offered a liberal arts undergraduate education with a focus on the environment, plus some graduate degrees. It was founded in 1834 and closed at the end of the 2018\u201319 academic year; for part of its history it was a women's college. == History == Green Mountain was founded in 1834 as Troy Conference Academy, a coeducational Methodist institution. It opened in 1837. In 1863, during a period of private operation, it became Ripley Female College; in 1874 it reopened as a Methodist college, again as Troy Conference Academy. In 1937 it was renamed Green Mountain Junior College. Green Mountain became a two-year junior college for women in 1943. In 1974, the school changed its name to Green Mountain College and returned to coeducational status, offering four-year baccalaureate degrees. In the late 1990s the college began to focus on environmental literacy and citizenship. === Closure === On January 23, 2019, Green Mountain's President, Robert W. Allen, announced that, despite a 2018 loan from the Department of Agriculture Rural Development Community Facilities Programs, the college had insufficient income to continue and would close that summer, at the end of the academic year. Arizona's Prescott College \u2014 which also focuses on the environment and sustainability \u2014 agreed to allow Green Mountain students to complete their degrees at Prescott. Prescott also said it would maintain the college's student records and hire some Green Mountain faculty. There were approximately 430 students when the college closed. The campus was offered for sale and then at auction. In 2020 entrepreneur Raj Bhakta purchased the former Green Mountain campus for $4.5 million. == Academics == Green Mountain College's core courses were known as the Environmental Liberal Arts curriculum, in environmental and natural sciences, writing, reading, history and philosophy. The college offered 23 undergraduate majors and the following graduate degrees: MBA in Sustainable Business; MS in Environmental Studies; MS in Sustainable Food Systems; and MS in Resilient and Sustainable Communities. It was part of the Eco League, a group of liberal arts colleges committed to environmental sustainability. === Progressive program === GMC offered an educational track known as the Progressive Program. Based on the ideas of philosopher John Dewey and formed on a philosophy similar to that of Goddard College, a Vermont institution recognized for its dedication to progressive education, the students in the program defined their own education goals and worked with faculty members individually to meet them. == Green campus == In 2007, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education awarded Green Mountain College the Campus Sustainability Leadership Award in the \"Under 1,000\" category. The award recognizes Green Mountain for commitment to environmental sustainability in its governance and administration, curriculum and research, operations, campus culture, and community outreach. GMC was also named the Sierra Club's #1 Cool School for 2018. Green Mountain was named an EPA Energy Star Showcase Campus following campus-wide retrofitting of light fixtures. Students installed a wind turbine to power the campus greenhouse and solar panels on the roof of the student center. On April 22, 2010, GMC formally opened a new combined heat and power biomass plant costing $5.8m. Through the Student Campus Greening Fund every GMC student contributed $30 from the college activities fee. Students designed projects and submitted proposals. Awards were based on a student vote. SCGF money was used to install bike racks, purchase recycling bins, use bio-diesel in campus maintenance equipment, and upgrade the alternative energy systems that powered the farm greenhouse. == Student clubs == According to the college, its choral group was the only collegiate choir in the United States with a repertoire of Welsh language music. == Notable alumni == * Amsale Aberra \u2013 Ethiopian-born American fashion designer and entrepreneur * William Duell \u2013 actor and singer * Richie Grant \u2013 soccer coach * Anna Katharine Green - novelist and poet * Edward H.
