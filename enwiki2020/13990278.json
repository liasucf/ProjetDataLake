    "text": "KXPC (90.3 FM) is a radio station licensed to serve Welches, Oregon, and the Portland, Oregon, United States, radio market. The station is owned, and the broadcast license held, by the Educational Media Foundation. ==History == The 90.3 frequency in Welches has been network-fed its entire life, beginning as an Air 1 outlet in 2001. The station was heard on 102.7 in Gresham and 92.7 in Vancouver Washington to improve its signal in the Portland area. Two other translators in the Portland area at 95.9 and 96.3 were rebroadcasting KLVP 88.7. In 2013, KNRQ moved from Eugene to Portland, and what was then KLVP on 88.7 took the KZRI call letters and Air1 affiliation, as 97.9, which briefly held the KXPC call letters, took the KLVP calls from 88.7. Around the same time, 92.7 upgraded and moved to Portland, continuing to rebroadcast KZRI, now at 88.7. The 96.3 signal would also rebroadcast KZRI until its move to 103.7, when it was leased to iHeart Media and now broadcasts as Tailgate Country 103.7. The 102.7 signal would be leased to Alpha Media to rebroadcast KXTG, leaving 92.7 as the Air1 signal directly in Portland. KXPC's repeater in Portland is 95.9. ==See also== KNRQ KLVP ==References== ==External links== * * * bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn;=101445565&formid;=301&fac;_num=61987 FCC construction permit] XPC Category:Radio stations established in 2001 Category:2001 establishments in Oregon ",
