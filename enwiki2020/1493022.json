    "text": "The Shenzhen Tong () is a reusable contactless stored value smartcard used for electronic payments in public transportation and some other areas in Shenzhen city, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China. It was developed by Shenzhen Modern Computer, the provider of automatic fare collection systems to Shenzhen Metro, with cooperation from Octopus Cards Limited, the operator of Hong Kong's Octopus cards system. It was first adopted by minibuses in Shenzhen, until the new system was introduced by Shenzhen Metro. The English name was originally TransCard. Starting from January 18, 2006, Shenzhen Tong was gradually accepted by public buses to replace the old IC card system by Shenzhen Bus. All routes operated by Shenzhen Bus Group, Shenzhen Eastern Bus, Shenzhen Western Bus and most other private buses operators accept Shenzhen Tong cards. Shenzhen Tong card can be purchased for RMB20 (Sale Version Card) deposit. A combined Shenzhen Tong and Hong Kong Octopus card is available, called the Hu Tong Xing, with RMB & HKD in different purses.
