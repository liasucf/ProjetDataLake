    "text": "Austroargiolestes calcaris is a species of Australian damselfly in the family Megapodagrionidae, commonly known as a powdered flatwing. It is endemic to south-eastern Australia, where it inhabits streams, deep pools and bogs, generally in mountainous areas. Austroargiolestes calcaris is a medium-sized to large, black and pale yellow damselfly, strongly pruinescent when mature. Like other members of the family Megapodagrionidae it rests with its wings outspread. Austroargiolestes calcaris appears similar to Austroargiolestes isabellae, which is found in the Sydney Basin. ==Gallery== Austroargiolestes calcaris female (11775281425).jpg | Tip of female tail Austroargiolestes calcaris male (11869933125).jpg | Tip of male tail Austroargiolestes calcaris female wings (34018042363).jpg | Female wings Austroargiolestes calcaris male wings (34018049473).jpg | Male wings ==See also== * List of Odonata species of Australia == References == Category:Megapodagrionidae Category:Odonata of Australia Category:Insects of Australia Category:Endemic fauna of Australia Category:Taxa named by Frederic Charles Fraser Category:Insects described in 1958 Category:Damselflies ",
