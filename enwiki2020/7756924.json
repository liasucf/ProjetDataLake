    "text": "The Santo Ant\u00e3o North Premier Division is a regional championship played in Ribeira Grande and Paul (though not listed), Santo Ant\u00e3o Island, Cape Verde. It is organized by the Santo Ant\u00e3o North Regional Football Association (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Regional de Futebol de Zona Norte do Santo Ant\u00e3o, ARFZNSA). The winner of the championship plays in Cape Verdean football Championships of each season. The league was formed in 1997 and continued to play with the Santo Ant\u00e3o Island League until the breakup into the north and south zones in 2002. Six clubs participate, a club with the most points participates in the national championships each season while the last placed club from the regional premier division relegates into the second division the following season. In 2013, the main portion became the Premier Division after the Premier Division was added. Paulense has the most island titles with six and will total seven on its entirety in late March, second is Solpontense with five, third is Rosariense with three and three clubs Beira-Mar and Foguet\u00f5es and now Sinagoga with only one title. ==Santo Ant\u00e3o North Premier Division- Clubs 2017/18== * Beira Mar - Ribeira Grande * Foguet\u00f5es - Eito * Paulense - Paul * Rosariense - Ribeira Grande * Santo Crucifixo - covering the parish, based in Coculi * Sinagoga ==Winners== Source:Santo Ant\u00e3o North Zone Winners at RSSSF ===Regional championships (1997-2012)=== *1997/98 : Rosariense Clube *1998/99 : Solpontense *1999/00 : Solpontense *2000-02 : not held as the Santo Ant\u00e3o Island League continued without the two zones *2002/03 : Paulense DC *2003/04 : Paulense DC *2004/05 : Paulense DC *2005/06 : Beira-Mar (Ribeira Grande) *2006/07 : Rosariense Clube *2007/08 : Solpontense *2008/09 : Foguet\u00f5es *2009/10 : Solpontense *2010/11 : Rosariense Clube *2011/12 : Paulense ===Regional Premier Division (since 2013)=== *2012/13 : Solpontense *2013/14 : Paulense *2014/15 : Paulense *2015/16 : Sinagoga *2016-17: Paulense *2017\u201318: Os Foguet\u00f5es ===Performance by club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
