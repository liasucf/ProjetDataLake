It was established in 1960 by the Wisconsin Province of the Society of Jesus. Sogang is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit institution of higher education in South Korea. ==History== ===Beginnings=== At the initiative of the Catholic Hierarchy of Korea, Pope Pius XII gave assurance that a Catholic institution of higher learning would be established in Korea. In 1948 he entrusted the task to the Society of Jesus. In October 1954 Jesuit Fr. Theodore Geppert, SJ from Sophia University of Tokyo came to Korea in search of a suitable site to establish a Jesuit college. In February 1955 Jean-Baptiste Janssens, SJ, the twenty-seventh Superior General of the Society of Jesus, assigned the task of establishing the college to the Wisconsin Province of Jesuits. Fr. Leo Burns, SJ, Superior of the Wisconsin Province of the Society of Jesus, came to Korea and, with the Korean Catholic Hierarchy, began negotiations with the Syngman Rhee government for the establishment of a liberal arts college. In January 1957 the Society of Jesus purchased a property of 67,075 pyong (217,323 sq. meters, 53 acres) at Nogosan, Sinsu-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul. The site was prepared for construction of an Administration Building, which was completed in November 1959. Sogang College was opened in 1960 and was granted university status in 1970. ===Development=== The 1979 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Mother Teresa visited Sogang in May 1981 and gave addresses in the auditorium and at the basketball court, appealing for all to practice a charity that is universal. In 1984 the Korean Catholic Church celebrated its bicentennial. For the celebration Pope John Paul II visited Korea on May 5, meeting with priests along with men and women religious in the gymnasium and with Korean intellectuals in the auditorium.A Sogang University campus building On April 24, 1985, Sogang's 25th anniversary was commemorated, with Sogang's founder Fr. Geppert, SJ as a special guest. ==University Symbol and Slogan== The cardinal red university color symbolizes love, the Holy Spirit, martyrdom, loyalty, and victory. The silver chevron comes from the first letter '\u3145' of \uc11c\uac15 (Sogang), representing the intellectual spirit of Sogang and an ivory tower. The \"IHS\" comes from the first letters of the Greek name for Jesus and is also found on the seal of the Society of Jesus, the Catholic religious order that founded the University. The medieval crown stands for the Virgin and Trinity, symbolizing wisdom. Sogang University also has a famous slogan which is: Be as Proud of Sogang as Sogang is Proud of You.
