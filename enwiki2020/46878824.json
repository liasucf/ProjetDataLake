    "text": "Danick Martel (born December 12, 1994) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who is currently an unrestricted free agent. He most recently played under contract to the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has previously played in the NHL for the Philadelphia Flyers and Tampa Bay Lightning. ==Playing career== As a youth, Martel played in the 2007 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Drummondville Voltigeurs minor ice hockey team. During the 2014\u201315 season, while playing with the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL)'s Blainville-Boisbriand Armada, Martel scored 48 goals and 54 assists, and was named to the QMJHL First All- Star Team. He was further honoured when he was named the 2014\u201315 CHL Humanitarian of the Year. Unselected in any NHL Entry Draft, Martel signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Philadelphia Flyers on March 10, 2015. He signed an amateur try-out with the Flyers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Lehigh Valley Phantoms, on April 11, 2015. In the 2017\u201318 season, Martel began his fourth season with the Phantoms and was leading the team and AHL with 14 goals in 17 games before earning his first call-up to the Flyers on November 22, 2017. He made his NHL debut that night against the New York Islanders, and would play three more games after that before being sent back to the AHL. In January 2018, Martel was selected for the 2018 AHL All- Star game; however, due to an injury, he was replaced by Oskar Lindblom. Nearing the end of the 2017\u201318 season, Martel was named the Phantoms' 2017\u201318 IOA/American Specialty AHL Man of the Year for his work in the community. On September 22, 2018, Martel was claimed off waivers by the Tampa Bay Lightning. In the 2018\u201319 season, on December 18, 2018, in a 5\u20132 win over the Vancouver Canucks, Martel scored his first NHL career point, assisting on a goal scored by C\u00e9dric Paquette. Primarily serving as the Lightning's reserve forward on the roster, Martel served as healthy scratch to appear in just 9 regular season games for 2 goals. On July 4, 2019, Martel was re-signed to a one-year, two-way contract extension with the Lightning. In the following 2019\u201320 season, Martel cleared waivers and continued in the AHL with the Syracuse Crunch, collecting 30 points in 52 games. On February 20, 2020, Martel was traded by the Lightning to the Florida Panthers in exchange for Anthony Greco. ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
