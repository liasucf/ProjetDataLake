    "text": "The Islands was a provincial electoral district in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It first appeared on the hustings in the 1890 provincial election and lasted until it was integrated into the new riding Nanaimo and The Islands at the 1941 election. == Demographics == {| class=\"wikitable\" |Population | |- |Population Change, | % |- |Area (km\u00b2) | |- |Population density (people per km\u00b2) | |} == Geography == ==History== ==Notable MLAs== This Nanaimo-Gulf Islands area riding's first appearance was in 1903. It was originally created for the 1890 election, but was redistributed and done away with for the 1894 election, but it was brought back again in the large redistribution that set the stage for the watershed 1903 election, which ended the no-party era in the BC House. The Islands then lasted until the 1937 election, and subsequently parts of it became Nanaimo and the Islands, which was a riding in elections from 1941 to 1963, or in other Nanaimo-area electoral districts. Parts of the area covered by The Islands are currently represented by various newer ridings: *Nanaimo 1996\u2013present *Saanich North and the Islands (current) *Saanich and the Islands (past) ==Electoral history== Note: Winners of each election are in bold. |- |- bgcolor=\"white\" !align=\"right\" colspan=3|Total valid votes !align=\"right\"|115 !align=\"right\"|100.00% !align=\"right\"| |- bgcolor=\"white\" !align=\"right\" colspan=3|Total rejected ballots !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"| |- bgcolor=\"white\" !align=\"right\" colspan=3|Turnout !align=\"right\"|% !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"| |} For the 1890 election The Islands was redistributed between North Nanaimo, South Nanaimo and Cowichan- Alberni.
