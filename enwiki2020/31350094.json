From his works, I draw my conviction that all music, even > instrumental music, is Song - elementary human expression. Dogmas exist only > to be overthrown: I liked Franz Hummel's attitude towards this notion long > before we knew each other and I like that about Wolfgang Rihm, too. The > courage to be free, to have one's own voice: that is of utmost > importance.Jens Joneleit: String Quartet No 6, Io Sol Uno arkivmusic.com > 2003 ==Operas== Joneleit's opera Der Brand.
