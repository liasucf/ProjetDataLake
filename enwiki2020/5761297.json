    "text": "Abner Charles Powell (December 15, 1860, in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania \u2013 August 7, 1953, in New Orleans) was a Major League Baseball player who was a member of the Washington Nationals of the Union Association in 1884. He later played for the Baltimore Orioles and the Cincinnati Red Stockings in 1886. He also managed and owned several teams, and he is best known for his innovations as a manager. ==Innovations== New Orleans Pelicans Powell is credited with various innovations that changed baseball, though in many cases this is incorrect or overstated. He is incorrectly credited with inventing rain checks and \"ladies' day\", but both of these were in use in New Orleans before Powell. However, Powell did improve the existing rain check, adding a perforated stub to ticket when sold so that only purchasers of tickets (and not other spectators, notably free-riders and fence-climbers) could get a new ticket. The idea of Ladies Day was to create an environment in the stands free of unsavory characters and conduct, as well as to make baseball a family-oriented event; it dates at least to 1880 in New Orleans, and the practice is still in place today. Powell scheduled a recurring Ladies Day on April 29 of 1887. Powell is also credited with using an infield tarpaulin so that fields could be ready immediately after rain storms. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1860 births Category:1953 deaths Category:Washington Nationals (UA) players Category:Baltimore Orioles (AA) players Category:Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA) players Category:Major League Baseball outfielders Category:19th-century baseball players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball right fielders Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania Category:Atlanta Crackers managers Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Peoria Reds players Category:Washington Nationals (minor league) players Category:New Orleans Pelicans (baseball) players Category:New Orleans (minor league baseball) players Category:Hamilton Hams players Category:Montreal (minor league baseball) players Category:Spokane (minor league baseball) players Category:Seattle (minor league baseball) players Category:Seattle Hustlers players Category:Nashville Tigers players Category:Wilkes-Barre Coal Barons players Category:New Castle Quakers players Category:Newark Colts players Category:Paterson Giants players Category:People from Shenandoah, Pennsylvania ",
