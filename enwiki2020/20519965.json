    "text": "Untasted Honey is the fourth studio album by American country music artist Kathy Mattea. It was released in 1987 on Mercury Records. The album produced Mattea's first Number One hit on the Billboard country charts in its lead-off single \"Goin' Gone\". Following this song was another Number One hit, \"Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses\", then \"Untold Stories\" and \"Life as We Knew It\", both of which reached #4. \"The Battle Hymn of Love\" was later released as a single from Mattea's 1990 album A Collection of Hits. Like Walk the Way the Wind Blows before it, this album includes a cut originally found on Nanci Griffith's 1986 album The Last of the True Believers, this time in the track \"Goin' Gone\". Untasted Honey was certified gold by the RIAA. ==Track listing== #\"Untold Stories\" (Tim O'Brien) \u2013 3:05 #\"Life as We Knew It\" (Walter Carter, Fred Koller) \u2013 3:20 #\"Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses\" (Gene Nelson, Paul Nelson) \u2013 3:23 #\"The Battle Hymn of Love\" (Paul Overstreet, Don Schlitz) \u2013 2:55 #*duet with Tim O'Brien #\"Late in the Day\" (O'Brien) \u2013 4:31 #\"Goin' Gone\" (Pat Alger, Bill Dale, Fred Koller) \u2013 4:28 #\"Untasted Honey\" (Craig Bickhardt, Barry Alfonso) \u2013 3:26 #\"Like a Hurricane\" (Alger, Mark D.
