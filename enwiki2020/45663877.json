    "text": "Text logo Tiny Desk Concerts is a video series of live concerts hosted by NPR Music at the desk of All Songs Considered host Bob Boilen in Washington, D.C. ==History== The first Tiny Desk Concert came about in 2008 after Boilen and NPR Music editor Stephen Thompson left a bar show frustrated that they couldn't hear the music over the crowd noise. Thompson joked that the musician, folk singer Laura Gibson, should just perform at Boilen's desk. A month later Boilen arranged for her to do just that, making an impromptu recording and posting it online. The name is taken from Boilen's 1970s psychedelic dance band called Tiny Desk Unit. ==Concerts== As of August 2018, the series included more than 800 concerts viewed a collective 2 billion times on YouTube. The series has sometimes drawn criticism for narrowness in the musical genres it includes\u2014described as focused on \"hipster-infused indie rock\" by Zachary Crockett at Vox\u2014to the exclusion of genres like country and hip-hop. However reviewers also say the series' musical focus has broadened in scope over time. Performer Anderson Paak's appearance on the series is Tiny Desk Concerts' most popular video with 53 million views (as of August 2020), surpassing (from November 2017) the previous number 1 viewed video of T-Pain, seen 14.96 million times.. Popular entries include Mac Miller's set (featuring Thundercat), viewed more than 44.4 million times as of September 2020. ==List of concerts== ===2020=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Date !Concert |- |May 23, 2020 |Clem Snide With Scott Avett |- |May 22, 2020 |Buddy And Kent Jamz |- |May 21, 2020 |Sylvan Esso |- |May 18, 2020 |Lankum |- |May 16, 2020 |Raul Mid\u00f3n |- |May 15, 2020 |Alex Isley |- |May 14, 2020 |Ashley McBryde |- |May 13, 2020 |Frances Quinlan |- |May 11, 2020 |Augustin Hadelich |- |May 8, 2020 |Braxton Cook |- |May 7, 2020 |MILCK |- |May 5, 2020 |Lianne La Havas |- |May 4, 2020 |Jon Batiste |- |May 1, 2020 |Buck Curran |- |April 30, 2020 |Jeru The Damaja |- |April 29, 2020 |Daughter Of Swords |- |April 28, 2020 |Rodrigo y Gabriela |- |April 27, 2020 |Mahan Esfahani |- |April 24, 2020 |Fogerty's Factory - John Fogerty + Family |- |April 23, 2020 |The Pop Ups |- |April 22, 2020 |Nick Hakim |- |April 20, 2020 |The Free Nationals Feat.

A jury of musicians and NPR staff choose a winner to play a Tiny Desk Concert. The contest has continued annually, each year drawing more than 6000 submissions. Jurors have included Trey Anastasio of Phish, Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, and Jess Wolfe of Lucius. Tiny Desk Contest winners have been Fantastic Negrito (2015), Gaelynn Lea (2016), Tank and the Bangas (2017), Naia Izumi (2018), and Quinn Christopherson (2019). ==References== ==External links== * Tiny Desk Concerts at NPR Category:American music websites Category:NPR Category:2008 introductions ",
