The album features songs about \"growing up and moving on\".https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8478662/lukas- graham-tour-dates The band will tour in support of the album in 2019. The album debuted at number one in Denmark while on the singles chart, \"Love Someone\" stayed atop for an eighth week, \"Not a Damn Thing Changed\" rose back up to number two and the other eight album tracks also entered. ==Critical reception== Mark Kennedy of the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette called the album full of \"regret and moodiness\" and noted that it is \"also largely shorn of the upbeat tempos and hip-hop elements that made his [Graham's] last album so successful. This is a truly melancholy Dane.\" Kennedy ultimately felt that the album leaves the listener feeling \"bummed out\". ==Track listing== Notes * signifies a vocal producer * signifies a co-producer ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Digital Albums (ARIA) | 31 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| South Korean Albums (Gaon) | 93 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) | 62 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Swedish Albums (Sverigetopplistan) Click on \"Veckans albumlista\". | 3 |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Danish Albums (Hitlisten) | 6 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Danish Albums (Hitlisten) | 9 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2018 albums Category:Lukas Graham albums Category:Warner Records albums ",
