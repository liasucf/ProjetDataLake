    "text": "Glasgow University Students' Representative Council was founded on 9 March 1886 and recognised as the legal representative body for students of the University of Glasgow by the Universities (Scotland) Act 1889. The SRC is responsible for representing students' interests to the management of the University and to local and national government, and for health and welfare issues. Under the Universities (Scotland) Acts, all students of the University automatically become members of the SRC. However, they are entitled to opt out of this. Unlike at other Scottish Universities, the SRC is one of four student bodies on campus, with it being the only representative body sitting on university level committees. It organises numerous events and campaigns during the year including freshers' fair and other freshers' week activities, welfare initiatives, as well as funding over 300 hundred clubs and societies. Since 1968, all of the SRC's offices have been located in the McIntyre Building on University Avenue. ==History== The SRC was founded on 9 March 1886 by a body of students whose primary focus was raising funds to build the GUU. Prior to this the only official representation to the university had been carried out through the office of Rector and rectorial clubs such as the Peel Club formed in 1836. The McIntyre Building, in which the SRC is based, had been built in 1890 to house the then newly formed GUU. In 1932, the GUU obtained its own building at the foot of University Avenue and the McIntyre Building became home to the Queen Margaret Union. At this time, the SRC was housed in rooms in Pearce Lodge, the former gatehouse of the University's old site on the High Street which had been reassembled at Gilmorehill. However, it moved into the John McIntyre Building when new premises were built for the QM in 1969. The dedication refers to John McIntyre, a physician who donated five thousand pounds (equal to around \u00a3300,000 in 2010http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/results.asp#mid) for its construction, in memory of his wife Anne. The John McIntyre building has since been renamed simply the McIntyre building. ===Notable former officers=== *Jamie Hepburn, Member of the Scottish Parliament (Senior Vice-President) *Angela Constance, Member of the Scottish Parliament (President, 1991\u201392) *Alasdair Allan, Member of the Scottish Parliament (Senior Vice-President, 1991\u201392) *Ron Donachie, actor (President, 1976-1977) (as Ronald Porter) *John Lamberton Bell, minister and hymn-writer, Rector of the University (President, 1974\u201375) *Donald Dewar, First Minister of Scotland (Honorary Secretary, 1959\u201360) *Sir William Kerr Fraser, civil servant, Chancellor of the University (President, 1951\u201352) *Robert Gibson, Lord Gibson, Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Scottish Land Court (President, 1910\u201311) *Sir Robert Horne, Chancellor of the Exchequer (President, 1892\u201393) *Liam Fox, Member of Parliament (General Representative, 1981-82) *John Nicolson, Member of Parliament (General Representative, 1982-83) *Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland (General Representative) == Representation == The SRC comprises 47 representatives, four of whom are general representatives and two of whom are first-year representatives.

The four sabbatical officers are also accorded membership of the Senate, while the President and a Court Assessor (elected by the Council) are entitled to sit on the University Court. The Council also elects representatives to numerous university committees, including the Health, Safety & Well-being Committee, the Library Committee and the Academic Dress Committee. The SRC is also home to the Rector of the University, elected by the students to represent them. This is achieved primarily through the Rector's role as chair of the University Court. The position of Rector is currently vacant, with the scheduled March 2020 Rectorial election being postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The most recent Rector was human rights Lawyer Aamer Anwar, whose term ended on the 31st of March 2020.

Many of those involved in the SRC's student media have won awards for their work and gone on to find a career in the media. These groups are: * Glasgow University Guardian - fortnightly newspaper * Glasgow University Magazine (GUM) - termly magazine * Glasgow University Student Television (GUST) - broadcast online and via screens around campus * Subcity Radio - internet radio station The SRC previously referred to the media as \"publications\" and until 2004 the SRC website glasgowstudent.net was run as a fifth media group.
