Duggan attended the University of California, Santa Barbara and University of California, Los Angeles. His father was an Irish immigrant who became an industrial engineer in the U.S; his mother was a nurse. According to Robert Duggan in Investopedia, \u201cWe [our family] made about $800 a month\u2026The last couple days of every month we scrambled around the house looking for lost quarters, dimes, and nickels [to pay the bills].\" Duggan attended St. Francis High School in San Jose, California, where he was both the captain and quarterback of the school football team. Robert is recorded as saying \u201cI captained my football team, I\u2019d get in a huddle, and I\u2019d go: \u2018Guys \u2013 sacrifice your body. We\u2019re behind in this game. We are not losing this game. Get out there. Sacrifice your body. Win the game guys. There\u2019s nothing more important in life right now than winning this game.'\" Duggan's first business venture was mowing lawns as a teenager in California. He said this about the lawn mowing enterprise to Entrepreneur.com, \"as a teenager, my first business was mowing lawns. My goal as a teenager was not to make the Forbes 400 list but to simply make enough money to get myself through college. When I was mowing lawns I realized when I went that extra mile to make a difference for the better, the property owner wanted to tip me or give me more work. It wasn't even very difficult. Sometimes it was a simple smile, extra care to make sure a hedge was edged perfectly, or taking the time when I was done to have the owner walk the property with me admiring my work.\" ==Career== === Sunset Designs === Duggan's first company, Sunset Designs, supplied Jiffy Stitchery kits to consumers - helping them create their own high-quality stitched projects at home.
