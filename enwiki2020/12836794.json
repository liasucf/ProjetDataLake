    "text": "Roger Neville Walker (born 1942) is a New Zealand architect based in Wellington. ==Career== After graduating in architecture from the University of Auckland in the 1960s, Walker worked for the architecture firm Calder, Fowler & Styles, until he established his own practice in the early 1970s. He now runs Walker Architecture & Design in Wellington. Like his compatriot Ian Athfield, Walker is notable for his unconventional design approach, which came out of a reaction against the then-dominant modernist architecture in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1998 Queen's Birthday Honours, Walker was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to architecture. He was awarded the New Zealand Institute of Architects' highest honour, the Gold Medal, in 2016. == Selected designs == * Mansell House (1st house designed in 1966), Highbury, Wellington (1968) * Link Building, Wellington Waterfront (1969) * Sotiri House, Highbury, Wellington (1969) * Wellington Club (1969\u201372, demolished c. 1986) * Centrepoint Arcade, Masterton (1972, demolished 1997) Whakat\u0101ne airport terminal * Whakatane Airport (1973\u201374) * Cuttance House, Tirohanga, Lower Hutt * Park Mews, Hataitai, Wellington (1974) * Rainbow Springs Tourism Complex, Rotorua (1976\u201381) * Britten House, Seatoun, Wellington (1977)University of Auckland - NZIA Regional Awards * Willis Street Village, Wellington (1979\u201380)WellUrban - Willis Street Village * Ainsworth House, Korokoro, Wellington (1970s)NZIA Wellington Awards - Saturday, 14 November 2009 * Waitomo Caves Visitor Centre * Ropata Village, Lower Hutt * Centre City Shopping Centre, New Plymouth (1985) * Novotel Gardens Park Royal Hotel, Queenstown (1988, formerly the THC Queenstown) * Chesterman Group Offices, Hamilton (1992\u201393) * Pirie St Townhouses, Mount Victoria, Wellington * Margrain Winery and Conference Centre, Martinborough (1990s) * Sirocco Apartments, Wellington (1999) * Thorndon School, Wellington (c. early 2000s) * New World Supermarket, Thorndon, Wellington * Century City Apartments (completed mid-2009) * The Boundary townhouse complex, Wellington * (cancelled after the bankruptcy of developer Terry Serepisos) * Harris House, Lake Rotoroa * St Patrick\u2019s Church, Taumarunui * Solitaire Lodge, Tarawera * Wairakei Hotel Villas and recreational facilities, Taupo * 164 The Esplanade, Island Bay * 62 The Parade Paekakariki ==See also== *Ian Athfield *Miles Warren ==References== ==Further reading== * Positively Architecture!
