She currently resides in Virginia. ==Early life== Cluck was raised in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. She began taking piano lessons at the age of 7, and was classically trained on scholarship at the Pennsylvania Academy of Music. ==Music== Cluck began performing her songs publicly in New York City in 2000. She self-released her first solo album, Diane Cluck, that same year. By 2001 she was appearing regularly at the SideWalk Cafe in New York's Lower East Side, a venue that has featured such artists as Jeffrey Lewis, Regina Spektor, and Kimya Dawson. Massachusetts-based record label Important Records distributed Cluck's second and third albums, Macy's Day Bird in 2001 and Black With Green Leaves in 2002. Also in 2002, her song \"Monte Carlo\" was included in a compilation of New York City Anti-folk music, Anti-folk Vol. 1, released by British label Rough Trade Records. She wrote most of her fourth album, Oh Vanille / ova nil, while staying at the Dorland Mountain Arts Colony in Temecula, California in 2003. The album was distributed in 2004 by Important Records, and subsequently reissued on 180g audiophile vinyl pressed by 3 Syllables Records in 2010. Her fifth album, Countless Times, was distributed by Voodoo-Eros in 2005, and her sixth album, Monarcana, 2001\u20132004, was distributed in 2006 by Very Friendly. Although known as a solo performer, she has often collaborated with others, including Jeffrey Lewis, CocoRosie, Toby Goodshank, Herman D\u00fcne, and recently with drummer Anders Griffen and cellist Isabel Castellvi on tours in the US, UK and Europe.Letters with mixtapes, October 1, 2009Diane Cluck and Anders Griffen announce new UK shows, May 2, 2010 In December 2011 she announced a fan-funded \"Song-of-the-Week\" project, in which she has been writing and distributing a series of 24 new songs directly to subscribers. In March 2014, Cluck released her seventh album Boneset, her first in eight years, on 10\" vinyl, CD, and digitally, laid out \"Dark to light to dark, the album overends as a mobius strip, its songs seeded with connection and release, overcoming fear with heart...birds, bones, surrender,\" which NPR Music described as \"as thrilling a showcase of Cluck's clawed, counterintuitive fingerpicking and elastic voice as anything she's ever released.\" In early 2014, Cluck embarked on a tour of the US, Ireland, the UK & Europe. She released and co-directed her first official music video for Boneset's first single, Sara. ==Style== Shawn Bosler of The Village Voice wrote that \"she is likely one of the most refined and elegant songwriters in all of neo-folkdom. A brilliant idiosyncratic guitarist, a witty and wise lyricist, an imaginative melody writer with a powerful voice; her dark and introspective tunes are utterly captivating, sorta like an earthier Kate Bush. Watch her spellbind the room.\" David Garland of NPR Music described her sound as \"an unlikely mix of Aaron Neville, the Baka people and Joni Mitchell.\" Praising Cluck's singing for being \"unaffected yet unusual\", he notes that she \"handles her guitar in a distinctive way, often plucking the strings where the neck meets the body of the guitar, producing a harp-like tone.\" ==Discography== *Diane Cluck \u2013 2000 (self-released) *Macy's Day Bird \u2013 2001 (distributed by Important Records) *Black With Green Leaves \u2013 2002 (distributed by Important Record) *Oh Vanille/Ova Nil \u2013 2003 (distributed by Important Records) *Countless Times \u2013 2005 (distributed by Voodoo-Eros) *Monarcana, 2001\u20132004 \u2013 2006 (distributed by Very Friendly) *Oh Vanille/Ova Nil 180g audiophile vinyl \u2013 2010 (reissue with previously unreleased tracks, pressed and printed by 3 Syllables Records, mastered by Ray Staff) *Boneset \u2013 2014 (distributed by Bone & Bloom Publishing) ==Collaborations (incomplete list)== *Travel Light, The River, Finish Line \u2013 2001 \u2013 With Jeffrey Lewis *So Not What I Wanted \u2013 With Herman D\u00fcne *To Live Like the Boys \u2013 With Herman D\u00fcne *Palam & Porom \u2013 2005 \u2013 With Toby Goodshank *tremenda \u2013 2005 \u2013 With Sierra Casady (on Les Disque Du Crespuscule (The Black and White Skins))The Black & White Skins Vol.1 on Discogs *Noah's Ark \u2013 2005 \u2013 Contributed to CocoRosie albumCocoRosie \u2013 Noah's Ark liner notes on Discogs *Tell Me to Stay (vocals) \u2013 2009 \u2013 by Stanley Brinks ==Compilation appearances== *AFNY Collaborations Volume 1 (Olive Juice Music) \u2013 2001 \u2013 With Jeffrey Lewis and Kimya DawsonAFNY Collaborations Volume 1 on Discogs *Antifolk Vol. 1 (Rough Trade) \u2013 2002 \u2013 Monte Carlo *The Golden Apples of the Sun \u2013 2004 \u2013 Heat From Every Corner *The Enlightened Family: A Collection Of Lost Songs \u2013 2005 \u2013 Real Good Time and Nothing But God *Rough Trade Shops: Singer Songwriter 1 \u2013 2006 \u2013 Easy to be Around *So Much Fire to Roast Human Flesh \u2013 2006 \u2013 A Phoenix and Doves *From Colette With Love \u2013 2006 \u2013 Real Good TimeFrom Colette With Love on Discogs *Anticomp Folkilation \u2013 2007 \u2013 The River \u2013 With Jeffrey Lewis *Margot at the Wedding OST \u2013 2007 \u2013 Easy to be Around *Skins \u2013 2011 \u2013 Petite Roses *Audio Antihero presents: REGAL VS STEAMBOAT for Rape Crisis \u2013 2013 \u2013 Content to Reform (Montreal Studio Version) ==References== Category:American women guitarists Category:American female singers Category:Freak folk Category:Musicians from Lancaster, Pennsylvania Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Guitarists from Pennsylvania ",
