Will Butler - Policy. Merge Records. Retrieved 16 March 2015. == Concept == Butler set out to make an album akin to what he calls \"American Music\". Butler has stated that \"Policy is American music\u2014in the tradition of the Violent Femmes, The Breeders, The Modern Lovers, Bob Dylan, Smokey Robinson, The Magnetic Fields, Ghostface Killah, and John Lennon (I know, but it counts).\" He has called this type of music \"Music where the holy fool runs afoul of the casual world\". == Recording and release == Policy was recorded in a week in Jimi Hendrix's old living room, which is now Studio C at Electric Lady Studios. Butler recorded it during a short break on Arcade Fire's Reflektor tour. All songs were recorded there, with the exception of \"Something's Coming\", which was recorded in Aaron Dessner's home recording studio, the recording place of The National.

A review from Rolling Stone praised the album for its intent on making what Butler calls \"American Music\", while still retaining a little bit of Arcade Fire, saying that \"The first solo album by the younger Butler sibling in Arcade Fire is less than half the length of his band's 2013 Reflektor. Policy is also more playful, a montage of impulses \u2014 crunchy rock, apocalyptic electro-disco, solo-John Lennon balladry \u2014 that come like whiplash... In the melodic arc of \"Son of God\", a slice of The Suburbs skinned down to the folk-rock jitters of the Violent Femmes.\"Fricke, David. Will Butler - Policy. Rolling Stone. Retrieved 17 March 2015. SPIN said \"This is the birth of Will Butler, solo artist, whose career seems just as woozily unpredictable and captivating as that of his 'day job'\". Dean Essner of Consequence of Sound had mixed feelings about Policy: \"May just be too slight to be successful, forcing its shortcomings to be amplified even if there are, in fact, many things to enjoy about this record\". == Track listing == == Personnel == All other artists who worked on Policy are unnamed by Butler. * Will Butler \u2013 guitar, vocals, bass * Jeremy Gara \u2013 drums == References == Category:2015 debut albums Category:William Butler (musician) albums Category:Merge Records albums ",
