Published in the United States under the title The Nazi Legacy: Klaus Barbie and the International Fascist Connection, New York: Holt, Rinehart,and Winston, 1985. , . His international activities started early. He first took part in Yves Gu\u00e9rin-S\u00e9rac's \"Aginter Press\", founded in Salazar's Portugal in 1965. After assisting Borghese during his 1970 attempted coup in Italy, he escaped to Franquist Spain -- as would Vincenzo Vinciguerra -- and met with future members of the GAL paramilitary group. He was then present at the June 20, 1973 Ezeiza massacre in Argentina,Sorin, Sergio. \"Las Relaciones Secretas Entre Pinochet, Franco y la P2: Conspiraci\u00f3n Para Matar\". Nizkor Project, February 4, 1999. and then met with US-born DINA agent Michael Townley in 1975 to prepare Chilean Christian Democrat Bernardo Leighton's failed assassination. In 1976, he participated in the Montejurra Incidents against left-wing Carlists in Spain, before leaving for Latin America. In South America, he took part in the 'Cocaine Coup' of Luis Garc\u00eda Meza Tejada, when a notoriously corrupt military regime forced its way to power in Bolivia in 1980, with assistance from the Argentine SIDE which had been called on for 70 foreign agents. He later worked for the new government in training its soldiers. Stefano Delle Chiaie later declared in a 1983 interview to a Spanish reporter: > I was decided to give my hand to the creation of an international > revolutionary movement... Therefore, when the opportunity of a national > revolution appeared in Bolivia, we were there to shoulder our comrades. We > were neither repressors nor narco-terrorists, but political > militants.Hearing of Stefano Delle Chiaie on 22 July 1997 before the Italian > Parliamentary Commission on Terrorism. Headed by Senator Giovanni > Pellegrino. Judge Baltazar Garz\u00f3n's investigations demonstrated that he had worked both for Pinochet's political police, the DINA, for the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A) and for Hugo Banzer's dictatorship in Bolivia. Delle Chiaie had met in Madrid with Pinochet during Franco's funeral in 1975, beginning his involvement with the Chilean regime and his part in Operation Condor. According to lawyer Alun Jones, representative of the Spanish justice during Spain's request to Great Britain for the extradition of Augusto Pinochet, Pinochet met with Delle Chiaie in Madrid to plan an attack against Carlos Altamirano, the leader of the Chilean Socialist Party. The plan failed, either because of Altamirano's awareness and personal caution, or because some intelligence agency -- it is not known from which country -- may have made him aware of the threats on his personal life. According to Le Monde diplomatique, Delle Chiaie met with Abdullah \u00c7atl\u0131 in Latin America and during a visit of the Turkish \"Grey Wolves\" member in Miami in September 1982. Abdullah \u00c7atl\u0131 \"is reckoned to have been one of the main perpetrators of underground operations carried out by the Turkish branch of the Gladio organisation and had played a key role in the bloody events of the period 1976-80 which paved the way for the military coup d'\u00e9tat of September 1980.Nezan, Kendal. \"Turkey\u2019s Pivotal Role in the International Drug Trade\". Le Monde diplomatique, July 1998. During a 1997 hearing before the Commission on terrorism headed by senator Giovanni Pellegrino, Stefano Delle Chiaie went on speaking about a \"black fascist International\" and his hopes of creating the conditions of an \"international revolution.\" He talked about the World Anticommunist League, but said that after attending a meeting in Paraguay, he left it. He claimed that the latter was a front for the CIA. He only admitted having taken part in the New European Order (NOE) organization, and denied having worked with the International Anticommunist Alliance around 1974. According to CIA documents, in Madrid, Stefano Delle Chiaie also met with Michael Townley, a DINA agent, and Virgilio Paz Romero, a Cuban based in Miami, with connections in Chile, to prepare, with the help of Franco's secret police, the murder of Bernardo Leighton, a Chilean Christian Democrat. On 6 October 1975 Leighton and his wife were severely injured by gunshots while in exile in Rome.Kornbluh, Peter. \"Chile and the United States: Declassified Documents Relating to the Military Coup, September 11, 1973\".

Delle Chiaie, along with fellow neo-fascist Vincenzo Vinciguerra, also testified in Rome in December 1995 before judge Mar\u00eda Servini de Cubr\u00eda that Enrique Arancibia Clavel (a former Chilean secret police agent prosecuted for crimes against humanity in 2004 Gotkine, Elliot. \"Vital Rights Ruling in Argentina\". BBC, August 24, 2004. ) and Michael Townley were directly involved in this assassination.Calloni, Stella. \"Arancibia, \"Clave\" en la Cooperaci\u00f3n de las Dictaduras\". La Jornada, May 22, 2000.
