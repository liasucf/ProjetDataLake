Thernstrom is a neoconservative thinker. He was raised in a strong liberal tradition, as was his wife, Abigail. They argue that the left, not they, changed. They reject the policies of race preferences and argue that such policies mainly lead to higher dropout rates among African Americans in colleges.G.G.
