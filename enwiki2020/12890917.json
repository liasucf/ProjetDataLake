For right now we are putting Stellar on hiatus until further notice. Thanks to you all.\" While there have been a few Itzacon events, the most notable a last-minute replacement for the unexpected November 2001 failure of UncommonCon 2, and Phoenix Entertainment's signature anime convention A-Kon continues to grow each year, as of September 2011 there is no sign that Stellar Occasion will ever return. == References == == External links == *Phoenix Entertainment official site *original Stellar Occasion website at Archive.org Category:Defunct science fiction conventions in the United States Category:Conventions in Texas Category:Recurring events established in 1994 Category:Babylon 5 ",
