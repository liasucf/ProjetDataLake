His real name being Hashimoto Naoyoshi, he was a retainer of the Sakakibara clan of Takada domain in Echigo province. After the collapse of the Tokugawa Shogunate, he joined the Sh\u014dgitai and fought in the Battle of Ueno. After the defeat at Ueno, he fled to Hakodate, Hokkaid\u014d, fought in the Battle of Hakodate at the Gory\u014dkaku star fort under the leadership of Enomoto Takeaki and \u014ctori Keisuke achieving fame for his bravery. But following the Sh\u014dgitai\u2019s surrender, he was handed over to the authorities in the Takada domain. In the eighth year of Meiji, with the intention of making a living in the way that he was fond of, went to the capital and lived in Yushima-Tenjin town. He became an artist for the Kaishin Shimbun, and on the side, produced many nishiki-e pieces. Regarding his artistic background: when he was younger he studied the Kan\u014d school of painting, but later switched to ukiyo-e and studied with a disciple of Keisai Eisen; and next joining the school of Utagawa Kuniyoshi , called himself Yoshitsuru. After Kuniyoshi\u2019s death, he studied with Kunisada. Later he studied nigao-e with Toyohara Kunichika, and called himself Isshunsai Chikanobu. He also referred to himself as Y\u014dsh\u016b. Among his disciples were and as a painter of images on fans (uchiwa-e), and several others. Gyokuei produced Kajita Hanko. Since only Nobukazu now is in good health, there is no one to succeed to Chikanobu\u2019s bijin-ga, and thus Edo-e, after the death of Kunichika, has perished with Chikanobu. It is most regrettable.\" -- trans. by Kyoko Iriye Selden (October 2, 1936, Tokyo-January 20, 2013, Ithaca), Senior Lecturer, Department of Asian Studies, Cornell University, ret'd.

Portrait of the Meiji Emperor No works have surfaced that are signed either \"Toyohara Chikanobu\" or \"Hashimoto Chikanobu\".Library of Congress ==Military career== Chikanobu was a retainer of the Sakakibara clan of Takada Domain in Echigo Province. After the collapse of the Tokugawa Shogunate, he joined the Sh\u014dgitai and fought in the Battle of Ueno. He joined Tokugawa loyalists in Hakodate, Hokkaid\u014d, where he fought in the Battle of Hakodate at the Gory\u014dkaku star fort. He served under the leadership of Enomoto Takeaki and \u014ctori Keisuke; and he achieved fame for his bravery. Following the Sh\u014dgitai's surrender, he was remanded along with others to the authorities in the Takada domain. ==Artistic career== In 1875 (Meiji 8), he decided to try to make a living as an artist. He travelled to Tokyo. He found work as an artist for the Kaishin Shimbun.\u6539\u9032\u65b0\u805e (\u304b\u3044\u3057\u3093\u3057\u3093\u3076\u3093) In addition, he produced nishiki-e artworks. In his younger days, he had studied the Kan\u014d school of painting; but his interest was drawn to ukiyo-e. He studied with a disciple of Keisai Eisen and then he joined the school of Ichiy\u016bsai Kuniyoshi; during this period, he called himself Yoshitsuru. After Kuniyoshi\u2019s death, he studied with Kunisada. He also referred to himself as Y\u014dsh\u016b. Like many ukiyo-e artists, Chikanobu turned his attention towards a great variety of subjects. His work ranged from Japanese mythology to depictions of the battlefields of his lifetime to women's fashions. As well as a number of the other artists of this period, he too portrayed kabuki actors in character, and is well known for his impressions of the mie (mise en sc\u00e8ne) of kabuki productions. Chikanobu was known as a master of bijinga. images of beautiful women, and for illustrating changes in women's fashion, including both traditional and Western clothing. His work illustrated the changes in coiffures and make-up across time. For example, in Chikanobu's images in Mirror of Ages (1897), the hair styles of the Tenmei era, 1781-1789 are distinguished from those of the Kei\u014d era, 1865-1867. His works capture the transition from the age of the samurai to Meiji modernity, the artistic chaos of the Meiji period exemplifying the concept of \"furumekashii/imamekashii\".Miner, Odagiri and Morrell in the Princeton Companion to Classical Japanese Literature, pp. 9, 27. \"The Korean Uprising of 1882\" -- woodblock print by Chikanobu Chikanobu is a recognizable Meiji period artist,Gobrich, Marius. \"Edo to Meiji: Ukiyo-e artist Yoshu Chikanobu tracked the transformation of Japanese culture,\" Japan Times. March 6, 2009; excerpt, \"We think the characteristics of the artist start to show around the late 1880s.... Before this, in his early works, he tends to imitate his teacher, Toyohara Kunichika.\" but his subjects were sometimes drawn from earlier historical eras. For example, one print illustrates an incident during the 1855 Ansei Edo earthquake.Gobrich, \"Edo to Meiji,\" Japan Times. March 6, 2009; excerpt, \" One picture shows people escaping from a collapsing house during the Ansei Edo earthquake of 1855, which reportedly killed over 6,000 people and destroyed much of the city. What gives this image a particularly timeless feel is the fact that the noble lady of the house \u2014 in accordance with the rules of etiquette and social decorum \u2014 has taken the trouble to get into her palanquin first before being carried out of the collapsing house..\" The early Meiji period was marked by clashes between disputing samurai forces with differing views about ending Japan's self-imposed isolation and about the changing relationship between the Imperial court and the Tokugawa shogunate.\"Y\u014dsh\u016b Chikanobu [obituary],\" Miyako Shimbun, No. 8847 (October 2, 1912). p. 195; Gobrich, \"Edo to Meiji,\" Japan Times. March 6, 2009; excerpt, \"[Chikanobu] was originally a samurai vassal of the Tokugawa Shogunate who saw action in the Boshin War (1868-69), which ended the country's feudal system.\" He created a range of impressions and scenes of the Satsuma Rebellion and Saig\u014d Takamori.British Museum, Meiji shoshi nenkai kiji, 1877; woodblock print, triptych. Saigo Takamori and his followers in the Satsuma rebellion Some of these prints illustrated the period of domestic unrest and other subjects of topical interest, including prints like the 1882 image of the Imo Incident, also known as the at right. The greatest number of Chikanobu's appeared in triptych format. These works documented the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. For example, the \"Victory at Asan\" was published with a contemporaneous account of the July 29, 1894 battle.
