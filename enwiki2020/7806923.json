    "text": "The Western India States Agency (WISA) was one of the agencies of British India. This agency was formed on 10 October 1924 as a part of the implementation of the Montague Chelmsford report on constitutional reforms. It was formed by merging the areas under the erstwhile Kathiawar, Cutch (covering only Kutch state) and Palanpur agencies.Great Britain India Office. The Imperial Gazetteer of India. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1908 At one time or another between 1924 and 1944, 435 princely states were included in this agency, roughly covering the present Gujarat state, but only eighteen out of these were salute states. Some 163 Talukas and Estates were included in this Agency: these were mostly petty (e)states, some no larger than a town or village. == Agencies == The divisions of the Western India States Agency were : * Eastern Kathiawar Agency (from 1926 onwards) ** Sabar Kantha Agency (merged with Eastern Kathiawar Agency on 1 September 1943) *** Banas Kantha Agency (former Palanpur Agency) and Mahi Kantha Agency merged in 1933 to form Sabarkantha Agency in 1933 except Danta and Palanpur states which went to Rajputana Agency. * Western Kathiawar Agency (from 1926 onwards) == History == The city of Rajkot became the headquarters of this new agency and C.C. Watson became its first Agent to the Governor General of British India (AGG). Its boundary was modified twice, in 1933 and 1943. On 5 November 1944 it was merged with the Baroda and Gujarat States Agency to form the larger Baroda, Western India and Gujarat States Agency. In 1924, Palanpur Agency was merged into the Western India States Agency and placed under the political control of the Government of India. The designation of Palanpur Agency was changed to Banas Kantha Agency in 1925 and Palanpur State was transferred to the Rajputana Agency in 1933. Also in 1933, the states of the Mahi Kantha Agency, except for Danta were included in this agency.William Lee-Warner, The Native States Of India (1910) In 1941, the area covered by this agency was and the population was 52,20,011. == Chief officers == === Agent to the Governor- General and Resident, Western States === *10 Oct 1924 - 15 July 1926 Charles Cunningham Watson (1st time) (born 1874 - died 1934) *16 July 1926 - Nov 1926 A.D.
