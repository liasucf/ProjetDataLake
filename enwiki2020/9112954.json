He was the oldest son of Sir Thomas Bennet, 1st Baronet of Babraham, Cambridgeshire and his wife Mary Munck, daughter of Levinus Munck. In 1667, he succeeded his father as baronet. Bennet was educated at Gray's Inn in 1644. He was appointed High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire in 1652, and sat as Member of Parliament (MP) for Cambridgeshire from 1679 until his death in 1693. On 6 July 1653, at All Hallows-on-the-Wall, London, he married Judith Boevey, the daughter of William Boevey (died 1661) of Flaxley Abbey, Gloucestershire, son of the Dutch-born Huguenot Andrew Boevey (died 1625), and brother of the merchant, lawyer and philosopher James Boevey (1622\u20131696).
