This was followed in August by a flood, which swept two of his men, who were working to protect the building, into the culvert under King William Street, and one was drowned. The brewery was back in action early in 1863. Sometime around 1860 he took E. T. Smith on as a partner. Logue died in 1865; his will would be the subject of a legal dispute. Smith continued operating the business, which he renamed Kent Town Brewery, and two years later was its proprietor. :Kent Town was named for Dr. Benjamin Archer Kent (1808 \u2013 25 November 1864), who before emigrating was a medical practitioner in Walsall, Staffordshire. He was the attendant physician when Edwin Smith was born. Smith would later build his brewery on the site of the doctor's cottage. The cellars were enlarged in 1868. Kent Town was subjected to another major flooding in July 1873, which did considerable damage to nearby properties, but apart from minor incursion into the cellars and some undercutting of the foundations the brewery was unaffected. In Smith contracted Thomas English as architect for new premises completed 1876 at the nearby corner of Rundle Street and Dequetteville Terrace. Brown & Thompson were the builders. He also had nine workmen's cottages built at the rear of the premises by contractor Dickin. In 1888 the South Australian Brewing, Malting, and Wine and Spirit Company (later South Australian Brewing Company) was formed to take over the assets of The Kent Town Brewery, West End Brewery and Rounsevell & Simms's wine and spirit business. ==Building conversion== The malt towers of the old Kent Town Brewery have now been turned into luxury apartments overlooking the Adelaide Park Lands and Adelaide city centre. ==Further reading== *The breweries of Adelaide and its suburbs - 1868 article in the South Australian Register on the practicalities of beer brewing in Adelaide (Kent Town, West End, Union, Pirie Street, Hindmarsh, Morphett Street, and Walkerville breweries). == References == Category:Food and drink companies established in 1856 Category:1888 disestablishments in Australia Category:Beer brewing companies based in South Australia Category:Breweries in Australia Category:Australian companies established in 1856 ",
