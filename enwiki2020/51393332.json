Honor Girl, Thrash's first book, was published by Candlewick Press in 2015. The book describes her early life as a teenager coming out as a lesbian while attending conservative summer camp. It received strongly favorable reviews and was named a finalist for the 2016 Los Angeles Times Book Prize in the Graphic Novel/Comics category. Her follow-up memoir, Lost Soul Be At Peace, published in 2018, explores a period of teen depression and her relationships with her family, notably her father, a federal judge. Thrash has also written two books in a mystery series for young adults. The first book called Strange Truth (formerly We Know It Was You) was published in 2016 by the Simon Pulse imprint of Simon & Schuster. The sequel, Strange Lies, was published in October 2017. Thrash currently lives in Greater Boston Massachusetts. She was a frequent contributor to Rookie, a (now defunct) online magazine for teenage girls. ==References== ==External links== * * *Maggie Thrash on QUEERY with Cameron Esposito Category:American female comics artists Category:American comics writers Category:LGBT comics creators Category:Lesbian writers Category:Living people Category:Women writers of young adult literature Category:Women memoirists Category:American women novelists Category:American writers of young adult literature Category:21st-century American women writers Category:21st-century American novelists Category:Hampshire College alumni Category:Female comics writers Category:The Lovett School alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
