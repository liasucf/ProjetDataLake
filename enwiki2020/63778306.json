    "text": "The Baffin ice sheet is the most northerly ice sheet from the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Centered in the Foxe Basin between Baffin Island and the Melville Peninsula, north of Hudson Bay. Blocked from a southward flow by the Keewatin and Labrador Ice sheets, it moved north and eastward across Baffin Island into the Baffin Sound. Two smaller ice domes formed along the island chain of the Sound as the Barnes Dome, Penny Dome and the Amadjuak Dome. ==See also== *Laurentide Ice Sheet **Cordilleran ice sheet **Keewatin ice sheet **Labrador ice sheet **Baffin ice sheet ==References== ==Bibliography== *Fulton, R.
