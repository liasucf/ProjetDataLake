The show has been positively reviewed in The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, The A.V. Club, and Kill Your Darlings, which described the show as the \"distilled... pleasures, the prowess and, indeed, the rigours of sophisticated cultural critique\". From 2012 until 2014, the show was also broadcast on the radio in an abridged version alongside the Slate Political Gabfest as part of WNYC's now discontinued Gabfest Radio. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2008 podcast debuts Category:Audio podcasts ",
