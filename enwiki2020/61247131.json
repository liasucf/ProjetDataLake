Loehlin, he conducted a study of 850 twin pairs to determine the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors on individual differences in personality. The study was published in 1976 as the book Heredity, Environment, and Personality: A Study of 850 Sets of Twins. It was among the first studies examining the potential role of genetic factors in personality, after decades of researchers ignoring the subject. He has also researched the role of genetics in human intelligence. ==Biography== Nichols was born in Kentucky in 1927.
