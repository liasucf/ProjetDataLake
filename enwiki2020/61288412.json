Masquelet purchased a property on the corner of Dauphine Street and St. Ferdinand Street in Faubourg Marigny for $3,000 to build a parish church. He commissioned the architect Theodore Giraud to design the church building. The following year the parish is dedicated as Holy Trinity Church, a Catholic church serving the German immigrant community. The original church was destroyed in a fire in 1851. In 1853 a new church is built under the direction of Rev. Matthias Schifferer. Mary garden at Holy Trinity. In the late 1860s New Orleans suffers from an outbreak of yellow fever, killing two of the church's priests. In 1873 a chapel is built and dedicated to St. Roch, whom the congregation credited with ending the outbreak. Holy Trinity opened a Catholic School in 1871, run by Benedictine sisters. The school became a free parochial school in 1910. In 1876 the parish established St. Roch Cemetery. The church was damaged by Hurricane Betsy in 1965. In 1997 Holy Trinity closed and was deconsecrated by the Archdiocese of New Orleans. In 1999 the stained glass windows and organ were removed from the building. The building was badly damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. === Marigny Opera === In 2011 the church building is bought by Dave Hulbert and Scott King, converted into a performing arts venue, and renamed the Marigny Opera House.
