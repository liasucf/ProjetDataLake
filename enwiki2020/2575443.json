    "text": "South Arabia also known as Greater Yemen is a historical region that consists of the southern region of the Arabian Peninsula, mainly centered in what is now the Republic of Yemen, yet it has also historically included Najran, Jizan, and 'Asir, which are presently in Saudi Arabia, and the Dhofar of present-day Oman. South Arabia is inhabited by people possessing distinctive linguistic and ethnic affinities, as well as traditions and culture, transcending recent political boundaries. There are two indigenous language groups: the now extinct Old South Arabian languages and the unrelated Modern South Arabian languages, both members of the Semitic family. ==Etymology== The term Yamnat was mentioned in Old South Arabian inscriptions on the title of one of the kings of the second Himyarite kingdom known as Shammar Yahr\u02bdish II. The term was probably referring to the southwestern coastline of the Arabian peninsula and the southern coastline between Aden and Hadramout. One etymology derives Yemen from , meaning \"South\", and significantly plays on the notion of the land to the right (\ud802\ude7a\ud802\ude63\ud802\ude6c). Other sources claim that Yemen is related to yamn or yumn, meaning \"felicity\" or \"blessed\", as much of the country is fertile. The Romans called it Arabia Felix (fertile Arabia), as opposed to Arabia Deserta (deserted Arabia). Classical Latin and Greek writers used the name \"India\" to refer to South Arabia (ancient Yemen). The use of the term \"India\" arose from the fact that the Persians called the Abyssinians whom they came into contact in South Arabia by the name of the dark-skinned people who lived next to them, i.e., Indians.Origin Of Islam In Its Christian Environment Bell, Richard p.g 34 ==History== South Arabian forehead ornament, probably late 1800s, made of gold, pearls, turquoise, gemstones, exhibited in the Dallas Museum of Art (Dallas, Texas, US) Three thousand years ago, several ancient states occupied the region of South Arabia, being M'ain, Qataban, Hadhramaut, and Saba.Brian Doe, South Arabia (London: Thames & Hudson 1971) at 60\u2013102.

Two thousand years ago the Himyarites became the masters of South Arabia, dominating the region for several centuries. The Ethiopian Kingdom of Aksum invaded South Arabia first in the 3rd\u20134th centuries, then later in the 6th under King Kaleb who subjugated the region, c. 520. They were displaced by Persian forces of the Sassanid dynasty, c.575, who also arrived by sea.al-Tabari, The History of al-Tabari, volume V, The Sasanids, the Byzantines, the Lakmids, and Yemen (S.U.N.Y. 1999), in Yemen: Ethiopian conquest at 179, 182\u2013183, 204\u2013208, 212; Persia over al-Habashah at 159\u2013160, 236\u2013249.Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum.
