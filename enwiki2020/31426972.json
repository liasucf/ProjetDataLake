    "text": "The Grammy Award for Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano) is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for releasing albums in the regional Mexican or tejano genres. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\". In 2012, the award - then known as \"Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album\" - was one of the new categories that resulted from the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards for that year. According to the Academy, \"it was determined that musical distinctions among some of the regional Mexican subgenres were often very difficult to draw, so the restructuring in categories was warranted\". Grammy Awards Restructuring This award combined the previous categories for Best Regional Mexican Album and Best Tejano Album. Other Latin categories were also either merged or discontinued. Further restructuring took place in 2012 and was implemented in the 2013 Grammy Award season. As of 2013, this category was merged with the Best Banda or Norte\u00f1o Album category which had been created in 2012. According to the Academy, \"Best Banda or Norte\u00f1o Album and Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album are now merged into one category: \"Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano)\", for albums containing at least 51 percent playing time of new vocal or instrumental regional Mexican (banda, norte\u00f1o, corridos, gruperos, mariachi, ranchera, and Tejano) recordings.\"NARAS Press Release, 8 June 2012 As a result, this category is now named Best Regional Mexican Music Album (including Tejano). As of the 2020 Grammy Award season, Mexican singer Vicente Fernandez holds the record for the most wins in this category, with two. Mariachi Divas de Cindy Shea holds the record for the most nominations, with six (one of which went on to be awarded with a Grammy).
