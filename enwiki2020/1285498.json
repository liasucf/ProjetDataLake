The displacement is and the compression ratio is 22.0:1. Some engine variants have an intercooler in addition to the turbocharger, they can be identified by the tds. The M51 is an engine made of cast iron, it has one chain driven overhead camshaft and two valves per cylinder. Compared to the M21 the M51 now has tappets and a hydraulic valve lash adjustment. The fuel injection in the first engines is controlled by the ECU Bosch DDE 2.1, which was replaced after the first technical revision by the DDE 2.2. This results in greater torque at lower revs. For lubrication SAE 5W-40 oil is used. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\" ! Engine !! Power output !!
