The arena has 43 luxury suites on two separate levels and seating capacities range from 2,200 (theater set-up) to 10,595 for end stage events. It was estimated to attract over 750,000 visitors annually. Since 2016, the arena has been home to the Windy City Bulls, the Chicago Bulls' affiliate in the NBA G League. The Now Arena is located near the former site of the Poplar Creek Music Theater. ==History== The venue opened as Sears Centre on October 26, 2006, with performances by Duran Duran and Bob Dylan. In 2011, the Village of Hoffman Estates took over ownership of the arena after Ryan Companies US, Inc. walked away from the arena due to the arena's lack of success. However, since the village took over the arena and hired Global Spectrum to manage it, the arena has shown improvements. The naming rights to the arena were not affected by Sears Holdings' bankruptcy in 2018. On June 23, 2020, the Village of Hoffman Estates approved an $11.5 million deal to rename the venue to Now Arena. The name change would officially take effect on September 1, 2020. ==Notable events== *In 2008 and from 2010 until present, the Illinois Recreational Cheerleading Association (IRCA) hold their annual state championship at the facility. *The fourth annual TNA Bound for Glory Professional wrestling pay-per-view event on October 12, 2008, which was TNA's first ever event in the Chicago area. *The arena was also the venue which featured TNA's first ever Impact Wrestling outside of Orlando, Florida, on March 14, 2013. *On May 19 and 20, 2011, it played host to the Chicago audition stages in the first season of the Fox singer search program The X Factor. *In 2009 and 2011, it played host to Strikeforce events. *September 12\u201314, 2014: Played host to the Davis Cup, hosting matches between the United States and Slovakia. *2014 Skate America *The 2017 and 2018 Ken Kraft Midlands Championships, hosted by Northwestern University's wrestling program, have been hosted at the Sears Centre. *September 1, 2018: All In, the largest ever independent professional wrestling event, presented by Cody Rhodes and The Young Bucks, featuring the top names in the indies and certain wrestlers from New Japan Pro-Wrestling, like Kenny Omega and Kazuchika Okada.
