    "text": "Strontium peroxide is an inorganic compound with the formula SrO2 that exists in both anhydrous and octahydrate form, both of which are white solids. The anhydrous form adopts a structure similar to that of calcium carbide.Bernal, J. D.; D'yatlova, E.; Kasarnovskii, I.; Raikhstein, S. I.; Ward, A. G. \"The structure of strontium and barium peroxides\" Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Kristallographie, Kristallgeometrie, Kristallphysik, Kristallchemie (1935), 92, 344-54.Natta, G. \"Structure of hydroxides and hydrates. IV. Octahydrated strontium peroxide\" Gazzetta Chimica Italiana (1932), 62, 444-56. ==Uses== It is an oxidizing agent used for bleaching. It is used in some pyrotechnic compositions as an oxidizer and a vivid red pyrotechnic colorant. It can also be used as an antiseptic and in tracer munitions. ==Production== Strontium peroxide is produced by passing oxygen over heated strontium oxide. Upon heating in the absence of O2, it degrades to SrO and O2. It is more thermally labile than BaO2.Bauschlicher, Charles W.
