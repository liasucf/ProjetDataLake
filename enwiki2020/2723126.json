Other products included silver, sulphuric acid, and small quantities of nickel and gold. In the Kaiser Friedrich mine close by, the first steam engine in Germany was erected on 23 August 1785. Hettstedt is mentioned as early as 1046; in 1220 it possessed a castle; in 1380 it received civic privileges. When the county of Mansfeld was sequestrated, Hettstedt came into the possession of Saxony, passing to Prussia in 1815. ==Notable people== Politician Roland Claus, member of the Bundestag, is from Hettstedt. ==International relations== Hettstedt is twinned with: * V\u00f6hringen, Germany * Bergkamen, Germany ==Notes== ==References== ;Attribution * ==External links== * Category:Towns in Saxony-Anhalt Category:Mansfeld-S\u00fcdharz Category:Province of Saxony Category:Bezirk Halle ",
