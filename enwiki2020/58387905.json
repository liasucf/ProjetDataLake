    "text": "Farzia Fallah (born 1980 in Tehran) is a composer. Since 2003 she has been living in Germany, and is currently based in Cologne. ==Biography== ===Education=== Fallah studied Electronics and Signal Processing at the Sharif University of Technology from 1998-2003, while simultaneously studying with Alireza Mashayekhi and Farimah Ghavamsadri. From 2007-2014 Fallah studied composition at the University of the Arts Bremen, first with Younghi Pagh-Paan and later with J\u00f6rg Birkenk\u00f6tter. She also studied electroacoustic composition with Kilian Schwoon and Joachim Heinz. From 2014-2016 she studied at the University of Music and Dance Cologne, taking composition lessons with Johannes Sch\u00f6llhorn. ===Career=== Her 2016 work, in sechs Richtungen for accordion and tape, features the tanbur playing of Mehdi Jalali. The piece is based on a poem by Mawlana Rumi, in which he searches for his home \"in six directions\", and not only from a certain place. The tambur is abstracted on the tape part, and attempts a unity of the two instruments despite the different means of sound production. The piece was written for Margit Kern, but has also been performed by Eva Z\u00f6llner. In 2017, she wrote t\u00e4nzerisch an der Kante, which was written for Ensemble Musikfabrik and her 2015 work for solo alto flute, Posht-e Hichestan, has been performed by the ensemble's flautist, Helen Bledsoe. In 2017, her work was performed at the launch concert of the Iranian Female Composers Association, founded by Niloufar Nourbakhsh. In the same year, she was also commissioned to write a work for accordion and shawm, for Duo Mixtura (Katharina B\u00e4uml and Margit Kern), which received its premiere at the Acht Br\u00fccken Festival. == List of works == * Ein weiterer Augenblick des stehenden Jetzt (2018) - percussion, piano and video * Ausgedehnter Augenblick (2018) - accordion, bass clarinet, cello and video * Im selben Augenblick (2017/18) - saxophone, bass clarinet, trombone, percussion, harp and contrabass * The expanded moments (2017/18) - accordion, bass clarinet * T\u00e4nzerisch an der Kante (2017) - ensemble * T\u00e4nzerisch bis zur Kante (2017) - ensemble * Ecco la primavera (2017) - accordion and shawm * Lalayi II (2017) - for violin, viola and cello * Atemlos lebendig (2016/17) - double bell horn and viola * Lalayi (2016/17) - two violas * In sechs Richtungen (2016) - accordion and tape * Die dritte Schrift (2015/16) - orchestra * Posht-e Hichestan (2015) - flute solo * Ungepaart und geschlossen (2015) - piano, cello and clarinet * Besorgnis der Sperlinge II (2015) - recorder solo * Besorgnis der Sperlinge I (2013/14) - recorder and electronics * Soovashoon (2012/13) - 19 musicians in 3 groups * Frau Meier, die Amsel (2011) - 7 musicians * Verwandeltes Lichtgr\u00fcn (2010/11) - organ and soprano * Khosha (2010-2014) - for alto and soprano recorder, bass clarinet and bassoon * \u2026 und dann befreit..?
