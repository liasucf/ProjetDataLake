    "text": "Slavic Native Faith in Poland (Rodnovery; Polish: Rodzimowierstwo) has in 2007, according to Scott Simpson, between 2000 and 2500 \"actively engaged and regular participants\". ==History== In 1818, the Polish folklorist and Slavophile Zorian Do\u0142\u0119ga-Chodakowski (pseudonym of Adam Czarnocki; 1784\u20131825) stated that Poland \"must return to [the] native faith\". According to that, he's recognised as precursor of the Slavic Native Faith in Poland. Another precursor in Poland was Jan Sas Zubrzycki (1860\u20131935), who elaborated the doctrine of \"God-Knowing\" (Bogoznawstwo). In the interwar period, a few movements emerged in Poland, recognized as early Polish Slavic Native Faith followers: the \u015awi\u0119te Ko\u0142o Czcicieli \u015awiatowida (\"Holy Circle of Worshippers of Svetovid\"; 1921) of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Ko\u0142odziej (1897\u20131978), Demiurg (1934), and Zadrugism (1937) of Jan Stachniuk (1905\u20131963). Another example is the pilot and army officer Zdzis\u0142aw Harlender (1898\u20131939), who advocated Polish Native Faith in his book Czciciele Dad\u017ab\u00f3g Swaro\u017cyca (\"Worshipers of Dad\u017ab\u00f3g Swaro\u017cyc\", 1937). The rapper and music producer Donatan is a self-declared adherent of Slavic Native Faith. He released his debut album R\u00f3wnonoc (English: Equinox) in 2012 and is a prolific music producer in Poland; he produced the song \"My S\u0142owianie (We Are Slavic)\" which represented Poland at the Eurovision Song Contest 2014. ==Rodnover organisations in Poland== V Poland-wide Slavic Native Faith Congress The major organisation of Rodnovery in Poland is the Rodnover Confederation. There are five formally registered religious organisations: * Native Polish Church; * Polish Slavic Church; * Religious Organisation of Polish Rodnovers \"Rod\"; * Rodzima Wiara (\"Native Faith\"); * West-Slavic Religious Organization \"Slavic Faith\". ==See also== * Slavic Native Faith in Russia * Slavic Native Faith in Ukraine ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * * * * ==Further reading== * Category:Slavic Native Faith by country Category:Neopaganism in Poland ",
