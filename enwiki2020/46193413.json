The Hong Kong government has a zero tolerance policy against illegal drug use. Drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy, which can be considered recreational drugs in other countries are all illegal in Hong Kong.Boland, R. (n.d.). Drugs in Hong Kong.

This trend dropped in the mid-1990s, but reappeared in the beginning of the 21st century.Chan Wai Leung, Chu Fung, Wong Pui Ling, Yu Kai Ming Caritas \u2013 Hong Kong.

Hong Kong: Security Bureau, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People\u2019s Republic of China The increase of consumption of illegal drugs among adolescents in Hong Kong can be attributed to the global trend of recreational drug use at nightclubs and rave parties. Following the popularisation of nightclubs and rave culture in Hong Kong, the abuse of party drugs such as ecstasy and ketamine has been on the rise since 2000.Cheung, N. W., & Cheung, Y. W. (2006).

Despite Hong Kong being a relatively safe city, and the Hong Kong government\u2019s efforts in controlling the use of illegal substances, drug abuse is still a prevailing issue in Hong Kong. Each year, more than 2000 people are reported to have taken illicit drugs for the first time.Central Registry of Drug Abuse.(12.19.2014). Newly/previously reported drug abusers by age. Retrieved from http://www.nd.gov.hk/statistics_list/doc/en/t1.pdf This can be attributed to Hong Kong's relatively lenient punishment for those found to have possessed illegal drugs and adolescent's receptive viewpoint regarding drug use as a normal part of leisure, as well as easy access of party drugs in club settings.
