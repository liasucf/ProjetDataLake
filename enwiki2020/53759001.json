Its delivery to the Spanish Navy is scheduled for 2018. The launching of the ship has been delayed several times due to labor conflicts with the employees of Navantia. The launch planned for July 2017 and, after three attempts, was postponed in early September and, due to new conflicts, the launch was delayed a few weeks, scheduled for mid or late that month. Finally, the sixth ship of the class, called Furor, was launched on September 8, 2017, in a private act (something atypical, as they are usually launched in a public act) and without being finished the structure, since the superstructure is not yet assembled. The ship was commissioned on January 21, 2019.
