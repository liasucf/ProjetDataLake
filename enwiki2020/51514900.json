For the new convent, the architect Mino Fiocchi designed and organized the construction in two years, with consecration in 1951. The large church has eight chapels. The two story nave has an octagonal dome. The facade has a palladian window above a portico with columns.Comune of Lecco, entry on church. ==References== Category:Roman Catholic churches in Lecco Category:20th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1951 ",
