Although Khanji chose to accede to Pakistan after the partition of India, the state was soon annexed by India and a subsequent referendum resulted in a massive Indian victory. An able sportsman, Khanji played first-class cricket for Western India and in his later life, was also the president of the Pakistan Hockey Federation. ==Early life== Khanji was born as Ghulam Moinuddin Khanji at Manavadar, Bantva Manavadar (in present-day Gujarat, India) on 22 December 1911. He was the eldest son of Nawab Fatehuddin Khanji. His mother, Fatima Siddiqa Begum was the second wife of Fatehuddin. Moinuddin graduated from Rajkumar College, Rajkot.Who's Who in India, Burma & Ceylon (Who's Who Publishers (India) Limited, 1936), p. 541 ==Reign== Khanji ascended the throne of Manavadar on 19 October 1918 after the death of his father. Since he was only seven years old, his mother acted as Regent until 1931, when 20-year-old Khanji's investiture took place. Following the independence and partition of India in 1947, the princely states were invited to either join India or Pakistan or remain independent. On 24 September, Khanji acceded to the new Dominion of Pakistan. However, on the orders of the Deputy Prime Minister of India Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, India annexed the state on 22 October. A referendum was held in Manavadar, Mangrol, and three other states. Out of 31,434 votes which were cast, 34 were in favour of Pakistan. Khanji was initially put under house arrest at Songadh and later arrested at Rajkot. In 1951, he left for Pakistan following the Liaquat\u2013Nehru Pact.Vidya Dhar Mahajan, Fifty Years of Modern India: 1919-1969 (S. Chand & Co., 1970), pp. 327\u2013328 ==Sportsman== Khanji was the founder of the Manavadar hockey team coached by Mirza Nasiruddin Masood.

Khanji also played cricket and represented Western India in the Ranji Trophy between 1935 and 1941. After migrating to Pakistan, he became the president of the Pakistan Hockey Federation. ==Personal life== Khanji married his first wife Qudsia Siddiqa Begum, daughter of the Nawab of Kurwai on 14 November 1933.
