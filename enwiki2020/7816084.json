    "text": "Ryan Henk Donk (born 30 March 1986) is a Dutch professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Turkish club Galatasaray. He can also play as a centre back. ==Club career== ===Netherlands=== Ryan Donk impressed in the 2005\u201306 season at RKC Waalwijk, and with an expiring contract, he wanted to make a step up to a higher level. AZ first approached him, but other clubs including Ajax, PSV and Barcelona showed serious interest in him. Donk chose to go to AZ as a replacement for defender Joris Mathijsen who had been sold to German club Hamburger SV, thinking it to be the best for his development. Initially AZ intended to loan Donk to RKC Waalwijk, but the player stated his intent to stay at the club in an attempt to push into the first team. He earned himself a place in the starting line-up and impressed with his performances at AZ. ====Loan to West Bromwich==== On 31 August 2008, Donk signed for West Bromwich Albion for one year on loan. He made his debut in a 1\u20130 win away at Middlesbrough on 28 September 2008. ===Club Brugge=== On 26 June 2009, Donk moved from AZ in his home country of the Netherlands, to Belgium to play for Club Brugge. ===Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa=== At the start of the 2013\u201314 season, Donk transferred to Turkish side Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa for an undisclosed fee. He played as a central defender for the team in his first two years, however during the first half of the 2015\u201316 season before transferring to Galatasaray, he played mainly as defensive midfielder. ===Galatasaray=== On 5 January 2016, Galatasaray announced dealing with Donk. On 9 January 2016, Donk made his debut for Galatasaray and scored his first goal in penalty box against Kar\u015f\u0131yaka in the 2015\u201316 Turkish Cup.Donk beleeft droomdebuut voor Galatasaray \u2013 Voetbal International He also made an assist for his teammate Bilal K\u0131sa in same match. ====Betis (loan)==== On 31 August 2016, after being rarely used, Donk joined La Liga club Real Betis in a season-long loan deal, with a buyout clause. And now he is back to Galatasaray. ==International career== In 2007 Donk was called up by Jong Oranje coach Foppe de Haan to be part of his squad for the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship held in the Netherlands. Donk participated in both of their first round group matches against Israel (1\u20130 win) and Portugal (2\u20131 win) to secure a semi final spot and to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics. During the tournament his sister was involved in a car accident.Beurse schouders van alle gelukwensen \u2013 BN De Stem Donk left the Dutch squad for a day and returned into the tournament after it was known her health was improving. After the Dutch qualified for the semi final and Olympics Donk took off his football jersey to reveal another shirt having the text \"Dit toernooi is voor jou, ik hou van je.\" (This tournament is dedicated to you, I love you.) on it to support his sister. In the semi finals against England (1\u20131, 13\u201312 after 32 penalty kicks) Donk assisted Maceo Rigters to score his 90th-minute equaliser with a bicycle kick which took the game into extra time. Donk was the only Dutch player on the field at the end of the game not to shoot a penalty after one England player (Nedum Onuoha) was unable to shoot due to an injury while England had no substitutes left. The Dutch went on to retain their 2006 title by beating Serbia 4\u20131 in the final. After his display at the tournament, Donk made the pre-selection of the Dutch national team on 6 August. Born in the Netherlands and of Surinamese descent, Donk was called up for a friendly match with the Suriname national football team in 2014, but was not given permission to join the squad. In 2015, Donk expressed an interest in representing the Turkey national football team, being eligible through residence in the country. He has not received a formal callup to the team. In November 2019, Donk got an official call up by Dean Gorr\u00e9 to represent Suriname. ==Style of play== A tall and commanding defender, Donk has drawn comparisons to many former footballers \u2013 one being former Dutch defender Jaap Stam.Nederlander Ryan Donk voor vier jaar naar Club Brugge 'Hij heeft meer talent dan Jaap Stam' \u2013 Nieuwsblad ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Waalwijk |2005\u201306 |rowspan=\"2\"|Eredivisie |7||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||7||0 |- |2006\u201307 |2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !9!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!9!!0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|AZ |2006\u201307 |rowspan=\"2\"|Eredivisie |20||0||1||0||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||0 |- |2007\u201308 |24||1||0||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||27||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !44!!1!!1!!0!!7!!0!!0!!0!!52!!1 |- |West Bromwich (loan) |2008\u201309 |Premier League |16||0||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||19||0 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Club Brugge |2009\u201310 |rowspan=\"4\"|Pro League |23||2||4||0||8||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||35||2 |- |2010\u201311 |36||0||2||0||7||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||45||1 |- |2011\u201312 |39||4||2||1||11||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||52||8 |- |2012\u201313 |32||4||1||0||7||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||40||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !130!!10!!9!!1!!33!!4!!0!!0!!172!!15 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa |2013\u201314 |rowspan=\"3\"|S\u00fcper Lig |27||5||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||28||5 |- |2014\u201315 |32||4||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||32||4 |- |2015\u201316 |16||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !75!!11!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!76!!11 |- |Galatasaray |2015\u201316 |S\u00fcper Lig |14||0||6||1||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||22||1 |- |Real Betis (loan) |2016\u201317 |La Liga |16||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||18||0 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Galatasaray |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"3\"|S\u00fcper Lig |17||0||7||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||24||0 |- |2018\u201319 |22||2||7||0||7||0||1||0||37||2 |- |2019\u201320 |17||2||5||0||6||0||1||0||28||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !56!!4!!19!!0!!13!!0!!2!!0!!90!!4 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !360!!26!!41!!2!!55!!4!!2!!0!!458!!32 |} == Honours == Galatasaray * S\u00fcper Lig: 2017\u201318, 2018\u201319 * T\u00fcrkiye Kupas\u0131: 2015\u201316, 2018\u201319 *S\u00fcper Kupa: 2016, 2019 ==References== ==External links== *Ryan Donk player profile at wba.co.uk * Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Amsterdam Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football central defenders Category:Dutch footballers Category:Netherlands under-21 international footballers Category:Dutch people of Surinamese descent Category:A.V.V.
