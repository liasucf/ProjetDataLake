The project is a multi-year endeavor aimed at accelerating the pace of reform in post-1989 democracies and advancing the date for the integration of these democracies into the institutions of the Euro-Atlantic. ==Biography== Bruce P. Jackson is son of William Harding Jackson, United States National Security Adviser under Eisenhower. From 1979 to 1990, Jackson served in the United States Army as a Military Intelligence Officer. From 1986 to 1990, he served in the Office of the Secretary of Defense in a variety of policy positions pertaining to nuclear forces and arms control. Upon leaving the Department of Defense in 1990, Jackson joined Lehman Brothers, an investment bank in New York, where he was a strategist in the firm's proprietary trading operations. Between 1993 and 2002, Jackson was Vice President for Strategy and Planning at Lockheed Martin Corporation. During 1995 and 1996, Jackson was National Co-Chairman of the Dole for President Finance Committee. In 1996, he was a delegate to the Republican National Convention where he served on the Platform Committee and the Platform's subcommittee for National Security and Foreign Policy. During the 2000 Presidential Campaign, he was a delegate committed to Governor Bush and chaired the Foreign Policy Subcommittee of the Republican Platform Committee. From 1995 until 2003, he was the President of the US Committee on NATO, a non-profit corporation formed in 1996 to promote the expansion of NATO and the strengthening of ties between the United States and Europe. In 2004, Jackson became a member of the International Commission on the Balkans and the Board of Directors of the We Remember Foundation, which is working to bring the officials of the Government of Belarus to justice for the disappearances of political opposition leaders and journalists. He has been recognized for his work on democratic change and European integration by the Governments of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Most recently, Jackson's work has focused on accelerating the integration of the Western Balkan countries and Turkey into the European Union and NATO and on building closer relationship between European institutions and the democracies within the European Union's Eastern Partnership, particularly Ukraine.
