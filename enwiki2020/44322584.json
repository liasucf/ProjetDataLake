Fernandez studied and developed his career with the National Autonomous University of Mexico, as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Manuel Toussaint. Then the latter died in 1955, Fernandez took over as head of the Aesthetic Research Institute at UNAM, where he would develop the most of his writing and research until his death. Fernandez\u2019s work was recognized by the Mexican government with the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes in 1969. ==Life== Justino Fernandez Garcia was born on September 28, 1904 in Mexico City. He was the grandson of the jurist Alonso Tom\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez P\u00e9rez, a magistrate in the supreme court, and Do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda de los Dolores Mondo\u00f1o y Fern\u00e1ndez. Son of Justino Fernandez Mondo\u00f1o, originally from Mexico City, who served as a member of the Mexican Constituent Congress which wrote the 1857 Constitution of Mexico. His mother was Sergia Garcia a native of Valladolid, Spain and his father's second wife. His nephew, Justino Reyes Retana Fern\u00e1ndez, served in the Mexican Airforce with the 201st Fighter Squadron during World War II. Justino Fern\u00e1ndez had no children but his sister had a single child called Colonel Justino Ignacio Jos\u00e9 Reyes-Retana Fern\u00e1ndez, a colonel, pilot and hero who fought in the Mexican Air Force in the Philippines as part of the \"Escuadron 201\" as an American ally during the Second World War. Justino Reyes-Retana Fern\u00e1ndez married Susana Marquina y Barcena, daughter to one of the most important archeologists and anthropologists of Mexico, Architect Ignacio Marquina Barredo. They had three children: Justino Ignacio Jos\u00e9 Reyes-Retana Marquina, Sergio Jos\u00e9 Reyes-Retana Marquina in honor of Sergia Garcia (Justino Fernandez's Mother) and Susana Leonor Reyes-Retana Marquina. He began school at the Colegio Franc\u00e9s de la Perpetua, but in 1910, he was sent to the United States to avoid the Mexican Revolution. He returned to Mexico in 1923, at the time when the Mexican muralism movement was being established. He did all of his undergraduate and graduate work at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). As an undergrad, he studied under Jos\u00e9 Gaos and Juan David Garc\u00eda Bacca, who introduced him to German philosophy and that of Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset. He earned his master's degree in 1953 and his doctorate the following year with a thesis entitled \u201cCoatlicue: est\u00e9tica de arte ind\u00edgena antiguo\u201d (Coatlicue, the aesthetics of ancient indigenous art) . Before he was established as a writer and researcher, he had a number of jobs to make ends meet, including working as an assistant of an architect. Fernandez died in Mexico City on December 12, 1972. ==Career== He was a writer, historian, critic, philosopher and researcher. While still a student, in 1932 he founded the Editorial Alcanc\u00eda publishing concern with Juan O'Gorman which operated until 1959. As a graduate student, he was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of well-known researcher, historian and critic Manuel Toussaint, becoming his assistant when he founded the Aesthetic Research Institute at UNAM in 1936. The following year he began teaching summer classes at the university in art history. He remained with this institution until his death, and concentrated most of his research and art criticism here. In this way, he continued the work of his mentor, Toussaint. Influenced by positivism, he is best known as a specialist in modern (20th century) Mexican art, in both its documentation and interpretation, relating it to art movements in the rest of the world. He particularly wrote about Mexican muralism, especially the work of Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco . However, he also did research work in both colonial period and 19th century Mexican art, writing an important work on the Altar of the Kings at the Mexico City Cathedral and studied the work of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco . When Toussaint died in 1955, Fernandez became the interim director of the Aesthetic Research Institute with the position becoming permanent the following year. He remained as such until 1968. In 1969 UNAM named him a researcher emeritus. From 1970 to 1972, he served as member of the governing board of UNAM. Other important associations included being a member of the Academia Mexicana de la Historia (as liaison to the Academia Real in Madrid) in 1965 and was a founding member of the Academia de Artes . His highest award was the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes from the Mexican government in 1969.
