This high school is part of the Tulare Joint Union High School District, along with Tulare Western High School and Mission Oak High School, led by Superintendent Tony Rodriguez.Tulare County Office of Education Official Site Enrollment at the four-year high school is approximately 1,650 for the current school year. The Administration Building and the school's Tulare Community Auditorium are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. ==Facilities== The school has grown steadily since the 1980s with expanding local land development and corresponding general population. In 1989 the Tulare Joint Union High School District retained the firm of Earth Metrics to forecast district growth and analyze the facility needs of the system in future years.Relation of Commerce and Housing and the Need for Additional High School Facilities in the Tulare Joint Union High School District, Earth Metrics Incorporated, September, 1989 In the 1980s the California Legislature changed the rules governing school facilities financing by authorizing school districts to directly levy School Impact Fees (sometimes called \"Developer Fees\"), and by deeming the School Facilities ActCalifornia Government Code Section 65970 et seq. the exclusive means by which cities and counties can address the overcrowding of schools.California Assembly Bill 2926, 1986 Stats. Chapter 887 Thus at that time the district forecast the future enrollment and established appropriate development fees to finance forecast facilities needs to expand Tulare Union High School and other district facilities. ==Athletics== The school's athletic teams compete in the six-team East Yosemite League under the name Tribe. Tulare Union is one of few U.S. high schools to have graduated multiple Olympic gold medal winners. Decathlete Bob Mathias won gold in 1948 and 1952, and discus thrower Sim Iness won in 1952. Mathias and Iness were classmates who graduated the same year. The school's stadium was named after Mathias in 1977, and a gymnasium was named after Iness in 1994. From 1924 until 2016, the school's athletic nickname was the Redskins. The term \"redskin\" is widely defined by dictionaries as pejorative, and the California State Assembly banned use of the mascot by public schools in September 2015. Principal Nunley defended the term, saying that the school had no history of racism and that the mascot honored natives. State Senator Marty Block described that as a rationalization, and said the term is a racist slur which warrants state intervention. The school had until 2017 to switch, and the district voted in June 2016 to change the name to Tribe. The move was part of a wider controversy over the use of Native American imagery as mascots ==Noted graduates== *Ryan Benjamin - American player of gridiron football *Matt Crafton - Two-time champion of the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series *Marquess Wilson - NFL Wide Receiver for the Chicago Bears *Bryce Harris - NFL Offensive Tackle for the Atlanta Falcons *Bryan Allen, pedal-powered aircraft pilot *Max Choboian, Former NFL quarterback for the Denver Broncos *Zac Diles, NFL linebacker currently a free agent *Dominique Dorsey, Former Canadian Football League player *Freddie Ford, Former NFL player *Virgil Green, NFL tight end for the Denver Broncos *Sim Iness, Olympic discus gold medalist, 1952 *Vic Lombardi, Former MLB pitcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers/Pittsburgh Pirates *Bob Mathias, Olympic decathlon gold medalist (1948 & 1952) and former U.S. Congressman *Devin Nunes, Republican Party (United States), United States House of Representatives, California's 21st congressional district *Maurice Preston, Four star General, U.S. Air Force *Elmo Zumwalt, Admiral, U.S. Navy == References== ==External links== * * Tulare Joint Union High School District Official Site Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:High schools in Tulare County, California Category:Public high schools in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Tulare County, California ",
