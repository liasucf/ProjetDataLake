    "text": "A crime information center is a data warehouse and search engine operated by a staff of detectives that assists in providing relevant and timely information to officers conducting an investigation. The computer network stores facts about convicted persons, suspects, encounters, nicknames and items of seemingly trivial value whose correlation could assist in an investigation. The computer network's control room can display real-time satellite and surveillance camera images and hosts a wireless link to police vehicles equipped to generate sketches at crime scenes and transmit them for comparison to stored data. ==List of CICs in the United States== * NCIC, run by the FBI * Real Time Crime Center, run by the NYPD * GCIC, run by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation ==See also== *Interstate Identification Index ==References== Category:Law enforcement databases in the United States Category:Criminal justice Category:Criminal law Category:Criminal records ",
