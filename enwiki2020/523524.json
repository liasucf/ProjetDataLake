    "text": "Hypocrisy is a Swedish death metal band formed in October 1991 in Ludvika, Sweden by Peter T\u00e4gtgren. Musically, the band started off with a traditional death metal sound on their early albums, but soon turned into a melodic death metal band.\"On the road at the New England Metal Festival: part 2 (continued)\". Dailycollegian.com. 2005-05-10. Retrieved 2012-01-04. Their early lyrics \u2013 written by original vocalist Masse Broberg \u2013 dealt with anti- Christian themes and Satanism. However, the band later chose to focus on themes such as the paranormal and extraterrestrials. Contrary to what some might believe, Magnus did not leave because of a shift in lyrical content, but because of a cracked eardrum during their 1st European tour (he later went on to black metal band Dark Funeral as Emperor Magus Caligula). Their tenth album, Virus, contains themes more typical of death metal such as violence, the horrors of reality, insanity, torture, war, drug addiction, and emotional strife. Their twelfth album titled End of Disclosure deals with conspiracy and anti-Illuminati themes. == History == After spending three years in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1990, founder Peter T\u00e4gtgren returned to his homeland of Sweden, to form his own band. Hypocrisy's early releases were noted as being well-executed death metal, but panned for not being particularly innovative. That criticism waned as the band matured, cultivating a more distinctive sound as well as employing an introspective lyrical approach. Later releases have a more atmospheric sound, with lyrical exploration of aliens and abduction experiences. T\u00e4gtgren's experience as a producer may have also have led to the band's change in musical direction, as he is more closely involved with many other bands while producing their albums. On November 17, 2009, Hypocrisy cancelled their U.S. tour. After cancelling earlier in 2009, Hypocrisy confirmed a North American tour for 2010. Joining Hypocrisy on the \"Long Time, No Death\" tour were Scar Symmetry, Hate, Blackguard and Swashbuckle. From January to March 2010, they toured Germany, Eastern Europe and Scandinavia, finishing in Moscow. Their North American tour took place in May 2010. On October 14, 2011, Hypocrisy released a DVD called Hell Over Sofia - 20 Years of Chaos and Confusion. It contains a full concert from the \"Long Time, No Death\" tour. The DVD also contains a one and a half hour documentary about the band. On November 10, 2011, Mikael Hedlund announced writing material for a new studio album during an interview with Metal Shock Finland's Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi. Mikael tells Metal Shock Finland: In early 2012 the band began to write new material for a follow up to A Taste of Extreme Divinity. On December 21, 2012 Hypocrisy announced that the title of the upcoming album would be End of Disclosure. It was released on March 22, 2013. ==Band members== Hypocrisy Rockharz 2019 19.jpg|Singer and guitarist Peter T\u00e4gtgren Hypocrisy Rockharz 2019 05.jpg|Bassist Mikael Hedlund Hypocrisy Rockharz 2019 14.jpg|Drummer Reidar Horghagen Hypocrisy Rockharz 2019 16.jpg|Live-Guitarist Tomas Elofsson ;Current members * Peter T\u00e4gtgren \u2013 guitars (1991\u2013present), vocals (1993\u2013present) * Mikael Hedlund \u2013 bass (1991\u2013present) * Horgh \u2013 drums (2004\u2013present) * Tomas Elofsson \u2013 guitars (2010\u2013present) ;Former members * Magnus \"Masse\" Broberg \u2013 vocals (1992\u20131993) * Lars Sz\u00f6ke \u2013 drums (1992\u20132004) * Jonas \u00d6sterberg \u2013 guitars (1992) * Mathias Kamijo \u2013 live guitars (1995\u20132004) * Andreas Holma \u2013 guitars (2004\u20132006) * Klas Ideberg \u2013 live guitars (2006) *Alexi Laiho \u2013 live guitars (2009) === Timeline === ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
