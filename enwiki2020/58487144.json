    "text": "New Hudson Ballpark is the temporary name for a proposed baseball stadium to be built in Hudson, Wisconsin. In 2021 it will become home to the St. Croix River Hounds of the Northwoods League, a collegiate summer baseball league. The new stadium will be part of a multi-use campus planned for the old 130-acre St. Croix Meadows dog track, a facility which was in business from 1991 to 2001, and which was unused afterwards. It was reported in July 2017 that construction could start the next month, with ticket sales starting that September and the stadium opening in May 2018. The St. Croix Meadows dog track was demolished in January 2018 to make room for the new Hudson Gateway development. Baseball stadium construction is set to begin in 2020. ==References== ==External links== * St. Croix River Hounds website * Northwoods League website Category:Baseball venues in Wisconsin Category:Buildings and structures in St. Croix County, Wisconsin Category:Stadiums under construction in the United States ",
