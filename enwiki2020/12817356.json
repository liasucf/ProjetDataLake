At six, she began attending a music school where she studied the cello. Dolina's musical career began in 1971 in the performance group \"My Odessity\" (We are Odessa Natives). She then worked as lead singer for the \"State Performing Orchestra of Armenia\", the \"State Performing Orchestra of Azerbaijan\", and the performing group \"Sovremennik\" (Contemporary). In 1981, Dolina performed together with Weyland Rodd as part of the \"Anthology of jazz vocals\" tour.
