    "text": "Morning Star is a Philippine morning talk show that aired on ABS-CBN. It replaced Good Morning, Kris, and ran from October 11, 2004 to January 28, 2005. The talk show was hosted by various ABS-CBN artists. It also served as the first talk show to be hosted by more than one artist from ABS-CBN. Since the show only served as a Christmas special which is meant for only a mere 3 months, it was replaced by another talk show Homeboy, which would be solely hosted by Abunda.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw07fw1hmbohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4KFk6aM8jo ==References== ==See also== *List of programs aired by ABS-CBN Category:2004 Philippine television series debuts Category:2005 Philippine television series endings Category:ABS-CBN original programming Category:Philippine television talk shows Category:Filipino-language television shows ",
