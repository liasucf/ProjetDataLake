Lackey Page 5 The first public demonstration of Velox was at VDI Scientific Conference in Berlin on 15 October 1932.Gas Turbine Powerhouse: The Development of the Power Generation Gas Turbine by Dietrich Eckardt Page 163 ==Design== ===Velox principle=== From Brown Boveri ReviewTHE BROWN BOVERI REVIEW THE HOUSE JOURNAL OF BROWN, BOVERI & COMPANY, LIMITED, BADEN (SWITZERLAND) VOL. XXVIII AUGUST/SEPTEMBER, 1941 No. 8/9 Page 190 ==Working== Velox boiler is based on the principle that heat transfer rate increases when velocity of flue gas is more than speed of sound. This increases steam generation rate.Velox Boiler Slides Uploaded by Parth Shah Slide 2 Flue gases are used to turn turbine which is connected to the compressor. It increases the flow of hot air to speed of sound. This increases the rate of heat transfer to the water coming from economizer into evaporating section causing it to generate more steam that goes in superheater via steam separator. Steam from superheater is at high temperature and pressure. This is used to operate turbines. === Components === * Water feed pump * Economizer for water preheating * Hot water circulating pump * Tube evaporating section * Turbine * Compressor * Steam separator * Superheater ==Uses== Velox boiler was primarily marketed for electricity generation. They were anticipated to be used in steam locomotives on land as well as on sea but eventually lost to efficiency and cost effectiveness of supercharged diesel engine and constant pressure combustion gas turbine. Advantages of somewhat reduced weight and purely rotary motion were greatly offset by the fact that Velox boilers were little over half efficient compared to diesel engines.Discussion on the First Gas Turbine Locomotive (by A. Meyer) and on a New Rotary Compressor (by A. Lysholm), in Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, volume 150, p. 1 and 11; published June 1, 1944 AdvantagesConstruction and Working Principle of Velox Boiler: * Compact design. * Flexibility of design. * High combustion rate. * It can be quickly started. Disadvantages: Requires additional partsVelox Boiler Locomotives * Electric starter. * Gas turbine to drive air compressor. * Steam turbine for water circulation. == References == Category:Steam boiler types ",
