Cottage Grove Dam, which impounds the lake, is long and high. It was completed in 1942 as one of the 13 dams built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the Willamette River basin. It is about south of Cottage Grove at river mile 29 (kilometer 47). The dam's main function, in conjunction with the Dorena Dam on the Row River, a Coast Willamette tributary, is flood control. Other functions are to supply water for irrigation and improved river navigation. The lake and its surrounds are used for recreation, including boating, camping, fishing, picnicking, and bird-watching. == See also == * List of lakes in Oregon ==References== Category:Dams in Oregon Category:United States Army Corps of Engineers dams Category:Reservoirs in Oregon Category:Lakes of Lane County, Oregon Category:Buildings and structures in Lane County, Oregon Category:Dams completed in 1942 Category:1942 establishments in Oregon ",
