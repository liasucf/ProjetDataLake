    "text": "{| |} S5 is the code name for a planned class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines currently being developed by India. S5 will weigh around twice as much as the preceding . == Design == The S5-class of submarines are planned to weigh around . They are planned to be armed with up to twelve or sixteen K6 Submarine-launched ballistic missiles, each armed with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles. == Development == The Government of India made an assessment of India's capability to design and construct a class of three new ballistic missile submarines codenamed 'S5' in 2006 when it was realised that the reactor and payload capacity of the Arihant-class submarines was limited. These submarines were initially planned to be operationalised beginning in 2021 but were later delayed. This delay had prompted the Indian Government to sanction an additional Arihant-class submarine in 2012 to avoid the idling of the production line. == See also == * Arihant-class submarine * Indian Navy SSN programme * Future of the Indian Navy == References == == External links == Category:Ballistic missile submarines Category:Submarines of India Category:Proposed ships ",
