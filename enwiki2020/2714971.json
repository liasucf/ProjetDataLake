    "text": "Butyraldehyde, also known as butanal, is an organic compound with the formula CH3(CH2)2CHO. This compound is the aldehyde derivative of butane. It is a colourless flammable liquid with an unpleasant smell. It is miscible with most organic solvents. ==Production== Butyraldehyde is produced almost exclusively by the hydroformylation of propylene: : CH3CH=CH2 \\+ H2 \\+ CO \u2192 CH3CH2CH2CHO Traditionally, hydroformylation was catalyzed by cobalt carbonyl and later rhodium complexes of triphenylphosphine. The dominant technology involves the use of rhodium catalysts derived from the water-soluble ligand tppts. An aqueous solution of the rhodium catalyst converts the propylene to the aldehyde, which forms a lighter immiscible phase. About 6 billion kilograms are produced annually by hydroformylation. A significant application is its conversion to 2-ethylhexanol for production of plasticizers. A major use of butyraldehyde is in the production of bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, a major plasticizer. Butyraldehyde can be produced by the catalytic dehydrogenation of n-butanol. At one time, it was produced industrially by the catalytic hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde, which is derived from acetaldehyde.Boy Cornils, Richard W. Fischer, Christian Kohlpaintner \"Butanals\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. . Upon prolonged exposure to air, butyraldehyde oxidizes to form butyric acid. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Flavors Category:Aldehydes ",
