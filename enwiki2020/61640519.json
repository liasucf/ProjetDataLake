In 1904, Campbell authored a series of articles, The Evolution of Man's Diet in The Lancet journal. He also contributed articles to the book, A System of Diet and Dietetics which was positively reviewed in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Campbell authored the book What is Wrong With British Diet?, in 1936. Campbell argued that the British diet was too heavy in cereal foods, cooked vegetables and puddings which provided inadequate mastication. He believed that habitual consumption of soft \"pappy\" foods and \"pultaceous puddings\" caused undersized jaws and dental disease. He recommended a pre-agricultural diet that consisted of animal products and raw vegetables. He wrote that the \"British diet errs mainly in containing an excess of cereals and starchy foods generally, and a dearth of animal and raw vegetable foods.\"Campbell, Harry. (1936). Introduction. In What Is Wrong with British Diet? Being an Exposition of the Factors Responsible for the Undersized Jaws and Appalling Prevalence of Dental Disease Among British Peoples. London: William Heinemann. Dr. Campbell wrote several medical research papers on mastication and the physiology of the jaw bones, jaw muscles and teeth formation in children and this is reflected in the series published in The Lancet, Observations on Mastication I-III in 1903. He established in 1925, after he retired from the medical profession, manufacturing natural rusks which he called Bickiepegs in Welwyn Garden City. Made from cereal wheat the finger shaped product was designed to help babies cut the back and front teeth whilst exercising the jaw muscles, bones and gums. The company Bickiepegs Healthcare still exists 95 years on and bakes to the original recipe from its factory in Aberdeenshire. He died in Norwood. ==Selected publications== *The Causation Of Disease (1889) *Headache, and Other Morbid Cephalic Sensations (1894) *Respiratory Exercises in the Treatment of Disease (1899) *Observations on Mastication (The Lancet, 1903) *The Evolution of Man's Diet (Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, Part 5, Part 6, Part 7, The Lancet, 1904) *On Treatment (1907) *Alcohol in Health and Disease (A System of Diet and Dietetics, 1908) *The Cause and Prevention of Dental Caries.
