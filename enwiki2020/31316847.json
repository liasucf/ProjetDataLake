Deborah Shapiro (Elizabeth Taylor) is also middle-aged and newly divorced, though she is still coming to terms with being single again and has had little luck finding a new beau. Mary and Deborah meet literally by accident when they get into a fender-bender outside Mary's office, but the two soon strike up a friendship after Deborah asks Mary to help her sell her house. Together, Mary and Deborah help each other deal with their new lives as single women, the difficulty of getting back into the dating pool, and the mildly terrifying onset of middle age and menopause. ==Cast== ==Production== Between Friends was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada from February to March 1983.Elizabeth Taylor: A Shining Legacy on Film De La Hoz, Cindy. ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Award ! scope=\"col\" | Category ! scope=\"col\" | Name ! scope=\"col\" | Result |- | 1984 | CableACE Award | Best Actress in a Dramatic or Theatrical Program | Carol Burnett | |- | 1984 | CableACE Award | Best Writing in a Dramatic Program | Jonathan Estrin, Shelley List | |- | 1984 | CableACE Award | Best Actress in a Dramatic or Theatrical Program | Elizabeth Taylor | |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1983 television films Category:1983 films Category:1980s drama films Category:Canadian television films Category:American buddy drama films Category:American films Category:Canadian drama films Category:Canadian films Category:English- language films Category:HBO Films films Category:Films shot in Toronto Category:1980s female buddy films ",
