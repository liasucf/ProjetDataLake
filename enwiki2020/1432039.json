    "text": "A version of the film Workers Leaving The Lumi\u00e8re Factory in Lyon (), also known as Employees Leaving the Lumi\u00e8re Factory and Exiting the Factory, is an 1895 French short black-and-white silent documentary film directed and produced by Louis Lumi\u00e8re. It is often referred to as the first real motion picture ever made, although Louis Le Prince's 1888 Roundhay Garden Scene pre- dated it by six and a half years. ==Plot== Three separate versions of this film exist, which differ from one another in numerous ways-\u200c\u200c\u200c\u200c\u200c\u200cthe clothing style changes demonstrating the different seasons in which they were filmed. They are often referred to as the \"one horse\", \"two horses\", and \"no horse\" versions, in reference to a horse-drawn carriage that appears in the first two versions (pulled by one horse in the original and two horses in the first remake). Another film with the same theme was made in 1896, that features another factory (or another entrance to the same factory) with different people. ==Production== This film was made in the 35 mm format with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, and at a speed of 16 frames per second. At that rate, the 17 meters of film length provided a duration of 46 seconds, holding a total of 800 frames. ==Current status== Given its age, this short film is available to freely download from the Internet. It has also featured in a number of film collections including Landmarks of Early Film volume 1, The Movies Begin \u2013 A Treasury of Early Cinema, 1894\u20131913 and The Lumi\u00e8re Brothers' First Films. The film has been known by a large number of alternative titles in France and the United States over the years since its production including La Sortie des Usines Lumi\u00e8re \u00e0 Lyon-Montplaisir, Sortie de l'Usine Lumi\u00e8re, La Sortie des Usines, Les ouvriers et ouvri\u00e8res sortant de l'Usine Lumi\u00e8re, Employees Leaving the Lumi\u00e8re Factory, Leaving the Factory, Workers Leaving the Lumi\u00e8re Factory, Lunch Hour at the Lumi\u00e8re Factory, Dinner Hour at the Factory Gate of M.
