From 1964 to 1968, Poole was married to Nancy Van Rijn, a Broadway performer and choreographer. In the late 1960s, Poole and his lover Peter Schneckenburger (later known as Peter Fisk, star of Boys in the Sand) began experimenting with film and multimedia shows, culminating in a multimedia gallery show for Broadway poster artist David Edward Byrd at the Triton Gallery in New York. Poole made his directorial film debut with Boys in the Sand (1971). He and Boys in the Sand producer Marvin Shulman made another film the following year entitled Bijou, starring Bill Harrison. Poole and Shulman then attempted to make a crossover film, Wakefield Poole's Bible, a trio of Old Testament stories focusing on female Biblical figures and starring Georgina Spelvin as a comic Bathsheba. The film was unsuccessful with audiences, though well received by the few critics who saw it. A number of Poole's films starred Casey Donovan, one of the best known porn stars of his time. One of them, Moving! (1974) challenged what Poole in a 1978 interview called the \"middle-class values\" of \"the vast majority of gays\" with its lengthy and graphic fisting scenes, which Poole considered important as \"one interpretation of reality related man-to-man.\"Jack Fritscher, \"DIRTY POOLE (Everything You Fantasized about Porn Director Wakefield Poole, But Were Too Wrecked to Ask),\" Drummer, February 1979, http://www.jackfritscher.com/Drummer/Issues/027/Dirty%20Poole.html#Feature%20article. Poole said that he stopped making films because of \"the AIDS situation. I lost my fanbase to AIDS.\" In the same interview, Poole said that he had been a heavy cocaine user, and that \"cocaine saved my life,\" because it made him unable to have sex.Gary M. Kramer, \"An Interview with Wakefield Poole,\" South Florida Gay News, November 12, 2014, p. 15, http://southfloridagaynews.com/Film/an-interview-with-porn-director-wakefield- poole.html?highlight=WyJwb29sZSIsInBvb2xlJ3MiXQ==, retrieved 11/21/2014. The online version is titled \"An Interview With Porn Director Wakefield Poole.\" Poole appears as himself in the film documentaries Ballets Russes, That Man: Peter Berlin, and Where Ocean Meets Sky. In 2000, Alyson Books published his autobiography Dirty Poole: the Autobiography of a Gay Porn Pioneer, which was reprinted with a new afterword by Lethe Press in 2011. A film documentary based on the autobiography, entitled I Always Said Yes: The Many Lives of Wakefield Poole, was directed and produced by Jim Tushinski (director of That Man: Peter Berlin) in 2013. ==Partial filmography== * Boys in the Sand (1971) * Bijou (1972) * Wakefield Poole's Bible (1973) * Moving!
