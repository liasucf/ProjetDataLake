    "text": "I Am Mary Dunne is a novel, first published in 1968, by Northern Irish- Canadian writer Brian Moore about one day in the life of a beautiful and well- to-do 31-year-old Canadian woman living in New York City with her third husband, a successful playwright. Triggered by seemingly unimportant occurrences, the protagonist / first person narrator remembers her past in a series of flashbacks, which reveal her insecurities, her bad conscience concerning her first two husbands, and her fear that she is on the brink of insanity. I Am Mary Dunne has been described as \"perhaps [Brian Moore's] best book\". Robert Fulford, writing in Canada's The Globe and Mail, calls it \"[a] feminist novel written before the wave of feminist novels began\". In its original draft, I Am Mary Dunne was called A Woman of No Identity. ==References== ==Further reading== * Brady, Charles A. \"I Am Mary Dunne\" in Eire-Ireland 3, Winter 1968, pp. 136\u201340. * Dorenkamp, J H. \"Finishing the day: Nature and Grace in Two Novels by Brian Moore\" in Eire-Ireland 13, Spring 1978, pp. 103\u2013112.
