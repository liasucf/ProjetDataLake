It is an androgen ester \u2013 specifically, the C17\u03b2 ciclotate (4-methylbicyclo[2.2.2]oct-2-ene-1-carboxylate) ester of nandrolone. Nandrolone cyclotate has potent and prolonged activity as an AAS when administered by intramuscular injection and is reported to have a similar duration of action to that of nandrolone decanoate via this route. == See also == * List of androgen esters \u00a7 Nandrolone esters == References == Category:Abandoned drugs Category:Androgens and anabolic steroids Category:Estranes Category:Nandrolone esters Category:Progestogens ",
