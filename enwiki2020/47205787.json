This bathhouse was built in the late Qajar (Ahmad Shah) by Haji Muhammad Ibrahim khansari. A variety of decorated tiles in the building display designs of humans, animals, and plants. Drawings and paintings of the four seasons of the year in the four corners of the bathroom is the reason for its name. The bathroom is the only bathroom where a separate part is devoted to religious minorities.
