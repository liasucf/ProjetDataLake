    "text": "The Lemieux\u2013Johnson or Malaprade\u2013Lemieux\u2013Johnson oxidation is a chemical reaction in which an olefin undergoes oxidative cleavage to form two aldehyde or ketone units. The reaction is named after its inventors, Raymond Urgel Lemieux and William Summer Johnson, who published it in 1956. The reaction proceeds in a two step manner, beginning with dihydroxylation of the alkene by osmium tetroxide, followed by a Malaprade reaction to cleave the diol using periodate. Excess periodate is used to regenerate the osmium tetroxide, allowing it to be used in catalytic amounts. The Lemieux\u2013Johnson reaction ceases at the aldehyde stage of oxidation and therefore produces the same results as ozonolysis. :600px The classical Lemieux\u2013Johnson oxidation often generates many side products, resulting in low reaction yields; however the addition of non-nucleophilic bases, such as 2,6-lutidine, can improve on this. OsO4 may be replaced with a number of other Osmium compounds. Periodate may also be replaced with other oxidising agents, such as oxone. ==History== The development of the Lemieux\u2013Johnson oxidation was preceded by an analogous process, developed by Lemieux, which used an aqueous solution of sodium periodate with a low (catalytic) concentration of potassium permanganate. This mixture became known as Lemieux reagent and has been used to determine the position of double bonds and for preparing carbonyl compounds. Unlike the Lemieux\u2013Johnson oxidation, which normally stops at the aldehyde, this older method could continue to give a mixture of aldehydes and carboxylic acids. ==See also== *Upjohn dihydroxylation *Milas hydroxylation *Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation *Ozonolysis ==References== Category:Organic oxidation reactions Category:Carbohydrate chemistry Category:Name reactions ",
