According to The Economist, he was \"reputed to be Russia\u2019s mafia boss.\" ==Criminal acts== Starting in 2007, \u00dbsoyan was embroiled in a gang war with Georgian mobster Tariel Oniani, who was seeking to reestablish himself in Moscow. Several of \u00dbsoyan's top lieutenants were killed including the Armenian national Alek Minalyan, a man allegedly in charge of extorting construction firms working on the 2014 Winter Olympics.Shuster, Simon. Will New Laws Help Russia Take Down the Mafia?, TIME Magazine, 13 October 2009. Accessed 24 April 2012. In July 2008 police raided Oniani's yacht as a meeting took place amongst the criminal leaders in an attempt to settle the conflict. \u00dbsoyan was not however amongst those detained. He later gave an interview to a newspaper, denying the stories of escalating violence and stated that \"We are a peaceful people and don't bother anybody, we are for peace in order to prevent lawlessness\".Schwirtz, Michael. In a River Raid, a Glimpse of Russia's Criminal Elite, The New York Times, 30 July 2008. Accessed 24 April 2012.

Although he did not attend, \u00dbsoyan sent an elaborate wreath to Ivankov's funeral saying \"To our brother from Grandpa Hassan\".Franchetti, Mark.
