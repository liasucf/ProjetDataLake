The film was directed by Claude Chabrol and stars Christophe Malavoy, Mathilda May and Virginie Th\u00e9venet. Divorced illustrator Robert spies on a young woman named Juliette whom he envies for her seemingly happy life. When they finally meet and Juliette leaves her fianc\u00e9 Patrick for Robert, the situation quickly escalates. ==Plot== Parisian illustrator Robert becomes obsessed with a young woman, Juliette. Night after night, Robert sneaks around the house to catch a glimpse of Juliette, until one day he finally gathers the courage to introduce himself. Juliette realizes that she is not happy with her fianc\u00e9, Patrick, and leaves him to be with Robert. Robert in turn is not happy with Juliette's obtrusive advances. One night, Patrick attacks Robert in a deserted area; Robert defends himself and knocks Patrick unconscious, leaving him on the shores of a nearby river. The next day, Robert is interrogated by the police. Patrick is missing, and suddenly Robert is the prime suspect. Nobody knows that Patrick has allied with Robert's bitter ex-wife, V\u00e9ronique, to take revenge on Robert; he is hiding from the police in order to make them think Robert killed him. Robert's professional and private life falls apart after becoming a police suspect. The situation escalates when Juliette commits suicide, and Patrick launches a vendetta against Robert. In a final confrontation between the men, V\u00e9ronique is accidentally killed, and although Patrick is defeated, Robert is again left as a suspect in an apparent crime scene. ==Cast== * Christophe Malavoy as Robert * Mathilda May as Juliette * Jacques Penot as Patrick * Jean-Pierre Kalfon as Police commissioner * Virginie Th\u00e9venet as V\u00e9ronique * Patrice Kerbrat as Marcello * Jean-Claude Lecas as Jacques * Agn\u00e8s Den\u00e8fle as Suzie * Victor Garrivier as Doctor * Jacques Brunet as Father * Charles Millot as Director * Yvette Petit as Neighbor * Dominique Zardi as Neighbor * Henri Attal as Cop * Albert Dray as Cop * Nadine Hoffmann as Josette * G\u00e9rard Croce as Cop * Isabelle Charraix as Mme Tessier * Laurent Picaudon as Boy * Christian Bouvier as Ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel * Gilles Dreu as M.
