    "text": "The 1900 Philadelphia Phillies season was the 18th season for the National League franchise. The Phillies finished the season in third place in the National League with a record of 75\u201363. Bill Shettsline managed the Phillies, who played their home games at National League Park. The Phillies' lineup featured three future Hall of Famers in Ed Delahanty, Nap Lajoie, and Elmer Flick. The team finished second in hitting (.290) and first in attendance with 4,313 fans per game. == Regular season == === Sign Stealing and Discovery === On September 17, 1900, at home in game 1 of a doubleheader against the Cincinnati Reds, the Phillies were discovered to have been stealing opponents' signs using hidden wires and an electronic device. Phillies\u2019 backup catcher Morgan Murphy sat in center field by the team\u2019s Baker Bowl lockers and offices. The Phillies ran wires under the field from the seat to a battery- powered device buried in the dirt beneath the third-base coach\u2019s box. Murphy spotted the opposing catcher\u2019s signals to the pitcher and signaled once for a fastball and twice for a breaking ball. Phillies infielder Pearce Chiles coached third-base, received the signal beneath his feet, and then signaled to the batter. In the third inning, Cincinnati\u2019s Tommy Corcoran walked to the third-base coach\u2019s box and began digging at the dirt with his cleats. Before the Phillies' groundskeeper could stop him, Corcoran had unearthed the electronic box and showed it to umpire Tim Hurst. Hurst disciplined no one, signaled the game to continue, and is reported to have shouted, \u201cBack to the mines, men!\u201d. === Season standings === === Record vs. opponents === === Roster === {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #0f437c; color: white; text-align: center;\" | 1900 Philadelphia Phillies |- | colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #af0039; color: white; text-align: center;\" | Roster |- | valign=\"top\" | Pitchers * * * * * * * * * | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Catchers * * * * Infielders * * * * * * * * | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Outfielders * * * | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Manager * |} == Player stats == === Batting === ==== Starters by position ==== Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | Pos ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | AB ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | H ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | Avg. ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | HR ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | RBI |- align=\"center\" | C || || 94 || 344 || 105 || .305 || 0 || 38 |- align=\"center\" | 1B || || 131 || 539 || 174 || .323 || 2 || 109 |- align=\"center\" | 2B || || 102 || 451 || 152 || .337 ||| 7 || 92 |- align=\"center\" | SS || || 131 || 466 || 94 || .202 || 3 || 62 |- align=\"center\" | 3B || || 101 || 383 || 108 || .282 || 3 || 58 |- align=\"center\" | OF || || 140 || 531 || 168 || .316 || 0 || 33 |- align=\"center\" | OF || || 138 || 545 || 200 || .367 || 11 || 110 |- align=\"center\" | OF || || 141 || 574 || 165 || .287 || 0 || 45 |} ==== Other batters ==== Note: G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | AB ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | H ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | Avg. ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | HR ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | RBI |- align=\"center\" | || 74 || 257 || 51 || .198 || 1 || 27 |- align=\"center\" | || 50 || 160 || 48 || .300 || 0 || 25 |- align=\"center\" | || 33 || 111 || 24 || .216 || 1 || 23 |- align=\"center\" | || 11 || 36 || 10 || .278 || 0 || 3 |- align=\"center\" | || 7 || 28 || 5 || .179 || 0 || 2 |- align=\"center\" | || 3 || 11 || 3 || .273 || 0 || 1 |- align=\"center\" | || 5 || 11 || 2 || .182 || 0 || 3 |} === Pitching === ==== Starting pitchers ==== Note: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | IP ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO |- align=\"center\" | || 33 || 262 || 14 || 14 || 3.78 || 68 |- align=\"center\" | || 32 || 240 || 15 || 10 || 3.60 || 41 |- align=\"center\" | || 29 || 223.1 || 15 || 9 || 3.14 || 58 |- align=\"center\" | || 32 || 218.2 || 15 || 10 || 4.77 || 49 |- align=\"center\" | || 22 || 160.2 || 9 || 10 || 4.65 || 47 |- align=\"center\" | || 10 || 80 || 5 || 5 || 4.84 || 12 |- align=\"center\" | || 5 || 38 || 2 || 3 || 6.16 || 6 |} ==== Other pitchers ==== Note: G = Games pitched; IP = Innings pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | IP ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO |- align=\"center\" | || 4 || 17.1 || 0 || 2 || 8.31 || 2 |} ==== Relief pitchers ==== Note: G = Games pitched; W = Wins; L = Losses; SV = Saves; ERA = Earned run average; SO = Strikeouts {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"16%\" | Player ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | G ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | W ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | L ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SV ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | ERA ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"9%\" | SO |- align=\"center\" | || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 4.50 || 1 |- align=\"center\" | || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3.38 || 0 |} ==References== ==External links== *1900 Philadelphia Phillies season at Baseball Reference Category:Philadelphia Phillies seasons Philadelphia Phillies season Penn ",
