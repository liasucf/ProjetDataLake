    "text": "In algebra, specifically in the theory of commutative rings, a quasi-unmixed ring (also called a formally equidimensional ring in EGA) is a Noetherian ring A such that for each prime ideal p, the completion of the localization Ap is equidimensional, i.e. for each minimal prime ideal q in the completion \\widehat{A_p}, \\dim \\widehat{A_p}/q = \\dim A_p = the Krull dimension of Ap. ==Equivalent conditions== A Noetherian integral domain is quasi-unmixed if and only if it satisfies Nagata's altitude formula. (See also: #formally catenary ring below.) Precisely, a quasi-unmixed ring is a ring in which the unmixed theorem, which characterizes a Cohen\u2013Macaulay ring, holds for integral closure of an ideal; specifically, for a Noetherian ring A, the following are equivalent: *A is quasi-unmixed. *For each ideal I generated by a number of elements equal to its height, the integral closure \\overline{I} is unmixed in height (each prime divisor has the same height as the others). *For each ideal I generated by a number of elements equal to its height and for each integer n > 0, \\overline{I^n} is unmixed. == Formally catenary ring == A Noetherian local ring A is said to be formally catenary if for every prime ideal \\mathfrak{p}, A/\\mathfrak{p} is quasi-unmixed. As it turns out, this notion is redundant: Ratliff has shown that a Noetherian local ring is formally catenary if and only if it is universally catenary.L. J.
