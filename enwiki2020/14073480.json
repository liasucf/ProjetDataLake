    "text": "Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit alpha (IKK-\u03b1) also known as IKK1 or conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase (CHUK) is a protein kinase that in humans is encoded by the CHUK gene. IKK-\u03b1 is part of the I\u03baB kinase complex that plays an important role in regulating the NF-\u03baB transcription factor. However, IKK-\u03b1 has many additional cellular targets, and is thought to function independently of the NF-\u03baB pathway to regulate epidermal differentiation. == Function == === NF-\u03baB response === IKK-\u03b1 is a member of the serine/threonine protein kinase family and forms a complex in the cell with IKK-\u03b2 and NEMO. NF-\u03baB transcription factors are normally held in an inactive state by the inhibitory proteins I\u03baBs. IKK-\u03b1 and IKK-\u03b2 phosphorylate the I\u03baB proteins, marking them for degradation via ubiquitination and allowing NF-\u03baB transcription factors to go into the nucleus. Once activated, NF-\u03baB transcription factors regulate genes that are implicated in many important cellular processes, including immune response, inflammation, cell death, and cell proliferation. === Epidermal differentiation === IKK-\u03b1 has been shown to function in epidermal differentiation independently of the NF-\u03baB pathway. In the mouse, IKK-\u03b1 is required for cell cycle exit and differentiation of the embryonic keratinocytes. IKK-\u03b1 null mice have a truncated snout and limbs, shiny skin, and die shortly after birth due to dehydration. Their epidermis retains a proliferative precursor cell population and lacks the outer two most differentiated cell layers. This function of IKK-\u03b1 has been shown to be independent of the protein's kinase activity and of the NF-\u03baB pathway. Instead it is thought that IKK-\u03b1 regulates skin differentiation by acting as a cofactor in the TGF-\u03b2 / Smad2/3 signaling pathway. The zebrafish homolog of IKK-\u03b1 has also been shown to play a role in the differentiation of the embryonic epithelium. Zebrafish embryos born from mothers that are mutant in IKK-\u03b1 do not produce a differentiated outer epithelial monolayer. Instead, the outermost cells in these embryos are hyperproliferative and fail to turn on critical epidermal genes. Different domains of the protein are required for this function of IKK-\u03b1 in zebrafish than in mice, but in neither case does the NF-\u03baB pathway seem to be implicated. === Keratinocyte migration === I\u03baB kinase \u03b1 (IKK\u03b1) is a regulator of keratinocyte terminal differentiation and proliferation and plays a role in skin cancer. Activation of three major hydrogen peroxide-dependent pathways, EGF, FOXO1, and IKK-\u03b1 occur during injury-induced epidermal keratinocyte migration, adhesion, cytoprotection and wound healing. IKK\u03b1 regulates human keratinocyte migration by surveillance of the redox environment after wounding. IKK-\u03b1 is sulfenylated at a conserved cysteine residue in the kinase domain, which correlated with derepression of EGF promoter activity and increased EGF expression, indicating that IKK-\u03b1 stimulatea migration through dynamic interactions with the EGF promoter depending on the redox state within cells. === Other cellular targets === IKK-\u03b1 has also been reported to regulate the cell cycle protein cyclin D1 in an NF-\u03baB-independent manner. == Clinical significance == Inhibition of I\u03baB kinase (IKK) and IKK-related kinases, IKBKE (IKK\u03b5) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), has been investigated as a therapeutic option for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer. Mutations in IKK-\u03b1 in humans have been linked to lethal fetal malformations. The phenotype of these mutant fetuses is similar to the mouse IKK-\u03b1 null phenotype, and is characterized by shiny, thickened skin and truncated limbs. Decreased IKK-\u03b1 activity has been reported in a large percentage of human squamous cell carcinomas, and restoring IKK-\u03b1 in mouse models of skin cancer has been shown to have an anti-tumorigenic effect. == Interactions == IKK-\u03b1 has been shown to interact with: * HDAC9, * AKT1, * AKT2, * CTNNB1, * FANCA, * IKBKG * IKK2, * IRAK1, * MAP3K14, * MAP3K7, * MAP3K8, * NFKBIA, * NCOA3, * PPM1B, * PRKDC, and * TRAF2. ==References== ==External links== * Category:EC 2.7.11 ",
