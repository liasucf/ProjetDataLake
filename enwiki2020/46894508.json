Unlike traditional reality television shows, The Island does not include any prizes, eliminations, or winners. ==Production== It is based on the British series The Island with Bear Grylls. The first season has six episodes. In the UK all episodes are available on All 4. In the series' premiere, fourteen men from various occupations and backgrounds are taken to a remote, uninhabited island by Bear Grylls, where they were left completely alone. Filming themselves, the men hunt for food, source water, erect shelter, build community and try to survive using only their strength, determination and know-how. They are equipped with limited tools, a basic medical kit, and a satellite phone for medical emergencies. On August 16, 2016, NBC cancelled The Island after one season. ==Cast== *Rob Brothers, Stay-at-home Father *Davion Carrillo, Firefighter *Taylor Cole, Radio Producer *Matthew Getz, Embedded Cameraman *Benji Lanpher, Embedded Cameraman *Earnest Marshall, Iraq War Veteran *Dakota Mortensen, Bird Farmer *Jim Murray, Retired Police Chief *Jud Nichols, Criminal Defense Attorney *Dr. Buck Parker M.D., Trauma Surgeon *Michael Rossini, Engineer *Graham Sheldon, Embedded Cameraman *Rick Smith, Embedded Cameraman *Trey Williams, Digital Marketing Manager ;Evacuated off the island * Taylor Cole (medical, episode 1) * Michael Rossini (medical, episode 2) * Davion Carrillo (medical, episode 3) * Earnest Marshall (personal issues episode 4) * Trey Williams (medical, episode 5) ==Episodes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2010s American reality television series Category:2015 American television series debuts Category:2015 American television series endings Category:English- language television shows Category:NBC original programming Category:American television series based on British television series ",
