    "text": "Stan Wawrinka defeated Novak Djokovic in the final, 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20133, 6\u20134, to win the Men's Singles tennis title at the 2015 French Open. As he did when he won the 2014 Australian Open, Wawrinka defeated the world No. 1 and world No. 2 on his way to the title. Rafael Nadal was the five-time defending champion, but was defeated by Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals. This was just Nadal's second career defeat at the French Open (the previous one being in 2009) and ended his record win streak of 39 matches. Nadal had won all six of his prior matches against Djokovic at the French Open, each during one of his previous then-record nine title runs. Nadal fell to No. 10 in rankings after the loss, his lowest ranking since breaking into the Top 10 on April 18, 2005. In addition, Stan Wawrinka defeated 2009 champion Roger Federer in the quarterfinals, as Federer was attempting to become the first male player in the Open Era to achieve a double career Grand Slam, meaning that for the first time since 2004, neither Nadal nor Federer would win the title. ==Seeds== ==Qualifying== ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ===Bottom half=== ====Section 5==== ====Section 6==== ====Section 7==== ====Section 8==== {| width=53% | valign=top width=33% align=left | {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |Flag Icon Key |- | List of National Flags |} |} == References == *Official Roland Garros 2015 Men's Singles Draw * Main Draw *2015 French Open \u2013 Men's draws and results at the International Tennis Federation Men's Singles Category:French Open by year \u2013 Men's Singles French Open - Men's Singles ",
