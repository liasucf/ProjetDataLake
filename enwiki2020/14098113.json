    "text": "Enadoline is a drug which acts as a highly selective \u03ba-opioid agonist. In human studies, it produced visual distortions and feelings of dissociation, reminiscent of the effects of salvinorin A. It was studied as a potential analgesic, but abandoned because of the dose-limiting effects of dysphoria, which could be expected from a \u03ba-opioid agonist. There was mention of its potential in treating comatose head injury or stroke victims, where that type of side effect would be immaterial. ==Potency== When enadoline was first reported in 1990, it was \"the most potent \u03ba-selective analgesic ever reported ... 25 times more potent than morphine and 17 times more potent than U-62066\". ==References== Category:Synthetic opioids Category:Dissociative drugs Category:Pyrrolidines Category:Kappa agonists Category:Tetrahydrofurans Category:Acetamides Category:Benzofuranethanamines Category:Spiro compounds Category:Psychedelic drugs Category:Abandoned drugs ",
