(n\u00e9e Onley) (1861 - 1909) and Henry Wilkins Chandler (1852 - 1938) in Ocala, Florida.

After completing high school, Chandler attended Teachers' College of Howard University where he received his A.B. in Education in 1913. He then went to Clark University and obtained his M.S. in chemistry in 1914. His master thesis was titled On the dynamics of ester by acids. He completed his Ph.D. in chemistry in 1917 under the guidance Roger Adams at the University of Illinois which made him the second African American to earn a Ph.D. in chemistry in the United States after St. Elmo Brady.https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/edward-chandler (accessed on May, 1, 2020)https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/29155408.pdfhttps://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10200851.pdf == Career == After completing his Ph.D., he worked in the dye firm of Dicks, David and Heller Company until 1921.
