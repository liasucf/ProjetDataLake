The music video of \"You\" was shot in Stockholm City Hall. It features Mattisson performing in several rooms, like the Golden Hall. ==Critical reception== Music & Media wrote in their review of the song: \"This Swedish duo consists of singer/dancer Tess\u2014who has worked with Dr. Alban, Basic Element and Dromhus\u2014and DJ/rapper Andrez who has considerable club experience. Together they have come up with a potent slice of Eurodance. The song is already doing very well in Sweden and Norway, and it has the potential to repeat that success elsewhere.\" ==Track listing== ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
