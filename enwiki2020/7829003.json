    "text": "I Heard a Voice \u2013 Live from Long Beach Arena is the first live DVD release from the rock band AFI. It was released on December 12, 2006. The concert was filmed at the Long Beach Arena in Long Beach, California on Friday, September 15, 2006. Part of the Decemberunderground Tour, the crowd was the largest AFI had ever headlined with over 13,000 people in attendance. The concert was shot in HD with more than 23 cameras. The title of this DVD is lifted from a line of poetry in the decemberunderground CD booklet. Underneath the song \"37mm\", it says: \"The power went out. I turned on the radio. The power went out. I turned on the radio. The power went out. I turned on the radio...I heard a voice.\" The moth (which appears to be some species of hummingbird moth) on the case is also from the decemberunderground booklet. Throughout the week before the release, the concert film was shown as a screening in various cities. Attendants received a limited edition two-sided poster. A CD version was released on November 13, 2007. ==Track listing== # \"Prelude 12/21\" - 2:04 # \"Girl's Not Grey\" - 3:12 # \"The Leaving Song Pt.
