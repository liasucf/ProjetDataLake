The Nazi German persecution started with the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses in 1933, reached a first climax during Kristallnacht in 1938 and culminated in the Holocaust of European Jewry. The British Mandate of Palestine prohibited Jewish emigration to Mandatory Palestine. The 1938 Evian Conference, the 1943 Bermuda Conference and other attempts failed to resolve the problem of Jewish refugees, a fact widely used in Nazi propaganda (see also MS St. Louis). A small number of German and Austrian Jewish refugees from Nazism emigrated to Britain, where attitudes were not necessarily positive. Many of the refugees fought for Britain in the Second World War. After WW-II, eastern European Holocaust survivors migrated to the allied-controlled part of Europe, as the Jewish society to which most of them belonged did not exist anymore. Often they were lone survivors consumed by the often futile search for other family and friends, and often unwelcome in the towns from which they came. They were known as displaced persons (also known as Sh'erit ha-Pletah) and placed in displaced persons camps, most of which were by 1951 closed. The last camp F\u00f6hrenwald was closed in 1957. ;1947\u20131972:Jewish refugees look out through the portholes of a ship while docked in the port of Haifa.Iraqi Jews displaced 1951.Exodus bringing in refugees. Magic Carpet\" (1949\u20131950), the entire community of Yemenite Jews (called Teimanim, about 49,000) immigrated to Israel. The Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries, in which the combined population of Jewish communities of the Middle East and North Africa (excluding Israel) was reduced from about 900,000 in 1948 to under 8,000 today, and approximately 600,000 of whom became citizens of Israel. The history of the exodus is politicized, given its proposed relevance to a final settlement Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace negotiations.Changing tack, Foreign Ministry to bring 'Jewish refugees' to fore \"'To define them as refugees is exaggerated,' said Alon Liel, a former director-general of the Foreign Ministry\"Israel scrambles Palestinian 'right of return' with Jewish refugee talk \"Palestinian and Israeli critics have two main arguments: that these Jews were not refugees but eager participants in a new Zionist state, and that Israel cannot and should not attempt to settle its account with the Palestinians by deducting the lost assets of its own citizens, thereby preventing individuals on both sides from seeking compensation.\"Philip Mendes The causes of the post-1948 Jewish Exodus from Arab Countries Yehouda Shenhav The Arab Jews: A Postcolonial Reading of Nationalism, Religion, and EthnicityAvi Shlaim No peaceful solution When presenting the history, those who view the Jewish exodus as equivalent to the 1948 Palestinian exodus, such as the Israeli government and NGOs such as JJAC and JIMENA, emphasize \"push factors\", such as cases of anti-Jewish violence and forced expulsions, and refer to those affected as \"refugees\". Those who argue that the exodus does not equate to the Palestinian exodus emphasize \"pull factors\", such as the actions of local Jewish Agency for Israel officials aiming to fulfil the One Million Plan, highlight good relations between the Jewish communities and their country's governments, emphasize the impact of other push factors such as the decolonization in the Maghreb and the Suez War and Lavon Affair in Egypt, and argue that many or all of those who left were not refugees. :Then UNHCR announced in February 1957 and in July 1967, that these Jews who had fled from Arab countries \"may be considered prima facie within the mandate of this office,\" so according them in international law, as bona fide refugees. ;1947: Egypt passed the Companies' Law. This law required that no less than 75% of employees of companies in Egypt must be Egyptian citizens. This law strongly affected Jews, as only about 20% of all Jews in Egypt were Egyptian citizens. The rest, although in many cases born in Egypt and living there for generations, did not hold Egyptian citizenship. ;1948: State of Israel established. Antisemitism in Egypt strongly intensified. On May 15, 1948, emergency law was declared, and a royal decree forbade Egyptian citizens to leave the country without a special permit. This was applied to Jews. Hundreds of Jews were arrested and many had their property confiscated. In June through August 1948, bombs were planted in Jewish neighborhoods and Jewish businesses looted. About 250 Jews were killed or wounded by the bombs. Roughly 14,000 Jews left Egypt between 1948\u201350. ;1949: Jordan occupies and then annexes the West Bank \u2013 largely allotted by the 1947 UN Partition of Palestine to an Arab state, proposal rejected by the Arab leadership \u2013 and conducts large scale discrimination and persecution of all non-Muslim residents \u2013 Jewish, Christian (of many denominations), Druze, Circassian, etc. \u2013 and forces Arabisation of all public activity, including schools and public administration. ;1954: Gamal Abdel Nasser seizes power in Egypt. Nasser immediately arrested many Jews who were tried on various charges, mainly for Zionist and communist activities. Jews were forced to donate large sums of money to the military. Strict supervision of Jewish enterprises was introduced; some were confiscated and others forcibly sold to the government. ;1956: Suez Crisis. Roughly 3,000 Egyptian Jews were interned without charge in four detention camps. The government ordered thousands of Jews to leave the country within a few days, and they were not allowed to sell their property, nor to take any capital with them. The deportees were made to sign statements agreeing not to return to Egypt and transferring their property to the administration of the government. The International Red Cross helped about 8,000 stateless Jews to leave the country, taking most of them to Italy and Greece. Most of the Jews of Port Said (about 100) were smuggled to Israel by Israel agents. The system of deportation continued into 1957. Other Jews left voluntarily, after their livelihoods had been taken from them, until only 8,561 were registered in the 1957 census. The Jewish exodus continued until there were about 3,000 Jews left as of in 1967. ;1962 :Jews flee Algeria as result of OAS violence. The community feared that the proclamation of independence would precipitate a Muslim outburst. By the end of July 1962, 70,000 Jews had left for France and another 5,000 for Israel. It is estimated that some 80% of Algerian Jews settled in France. ;1965 :Situation of Jews in Algeria rapidly deteriorates. By 1969, fewer than 1,000 Jews remain. By the 1990s, the numbers had dwindled to approximately 70. ;1967: Six-Day War. Hundreds of Egyptian Jews arrested, suffering beatings, torture, and abuse. Some were released following intervention by foreign states, especially by Spain, and were permitted to leave the country. Libyan Jews, who numbered approximately 7,000, were subjected to pogroms in which 18 were killed, prompting a mass exodus that left fewer than 100 Jews in Libya. ;1968:1968 Polish political crisis forced thousands of Jews to leave communist Poland. ; ;1970 :Less than 1,000 Jews still lived in Egypt in 1970. They were given permission to leave but without their possessions. As of 1971, only 400 Jews remained in Egypt. As of 2013, only a few dozen Jews remain in Egypt. ;1970s\u20131990s: State-sponsored persecution in the Soviet Union prompted hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews, known as Refuseniks because they had been denied official permission to leave, to flee; most went to Israel or to the United States as refugees.Mark Azbel and Grace Pierce Forbes. Refusenik, trapped in the Soviet Union. Houghton Mifflin, 1981. ;1991: 14,000 Jews fled Ethiopia as part of Operation Solomon. ;2014:Members of the Lev Tahor sect who fled from Canada after accusations of child sexual abuse expelled from Guatemala by the residents who accused them of not integrating within the culture and damaging the tourism based economyhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/guatemala/11065563/Jewish- sect-expelled-from-Guatemalan-village-after-clashes-with-Mayan-villagers.html == Expulsions of Jews by country == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! style=\"width:120px;\"| Region !!
