    "text": "Nitocris II (or Nitokris II, Nitocris B, \u00a7 365 n. 951; table 13A Egyptian: Nt- jqrt, Nitiqret) was an ancient Egyptian princess and priestess during the reign of pharaoh Amasis II of the 26th Dynasty. ==Biography== Daughter of Amasis II, Nitocris II is mainly attested by an inscription on a bronze sitting statuette of Amun-Ra now in the University of Chicago Oriental Institute (registration no. E10584A-BPicture of the statuette on the Chicago Oriental Institute website) on which she is called High Priest of Amun; the same object also claims that the God's Wife of Amun Ankhnesneferibre was her \"mother\". Nitocris' title is notable because she is the last attested holder of the once influential office of High Priest of Amun at Thebes, as well as one of only two known female holders;Dodson, Aidan, Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson (2004). , p.246 she may have reached this office around 560 BCE. The fact that Ankhnesneferibre is called her \"mother\" suggests that Nitocris also held the office of Divine Adoratrice of Amun which usually led to the charge of God's Wife of Amun after the adoptive mother's death. However, it seems that Nitocris never managed to reach the latter position because these offices were abolished soon after the Persian invasion of Egypt in 525 BCE. ==References== Category:Princesses of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt Category:6th-century BC clergy Category:6th- century BC Egyptian women Category:Theban High Priests of Amun ",
