He credited Yuen as the inspiration for the series' main character, Kwai Chang Caine; Carradine\u2019s book, The Spirit of Shaolin, was dedicated to Kam. A grandmaster of Shaolin kung fu and known as the \"Praying Mantis of North America\" for his skill in the fighting style, Yuen\u2019s film credits include the role of Red Band in Circle of Iron, co-written by Bruce Lee which was produced posthumously and also stars Carradine, and Project Eliminator\".
