It is currently stored at the Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility in Houston, Texas. It is sample number 15415. ==Rock== Chemical analysis of the Genesis Rock indicated it is an anorthosite, composed mostly of a type of plagioclase feldspar known as anorthite. The rock was formed in the early stages of the Solar System, at least 4 billion years ago.Apollo 15 samples overview Lunar and Planetary Institute It was originally thought they had found a piece of the Moon's primordial crust, but later analysis initially showed that the rock was only 4.1 \u00b1 0.1 billion years old, which is younger than the Moon itself, and was formed after the Moon's crust solidified. It is still an extremely old sample, formed during the Pre-Nectarian period of the Moon's history. Dating of pyroxenes from other lunar anorthosite samples gave a samarium\u2013neodymium age of crystallization of 4.46 billion years.Norman, M. D., Borg, L. E., Nyquist, L. E., and Bogard, D. D.
