Rev. Fr Gratian Mundadan CMI was appointed the Apostolic Exarch. The Apostolic exarchate of Bijnor was bifurcated from the diocese of Meerut. It consisted of the civil districts of Bijnor (excluding the tehsil of Dhampur), Pauri, Tehri, Uttarkashi and Chamoli of the then state of Uttar Pradesh. Later the district of Haridwar was created taking parts of Bijnor and Saharanpur, and the district of Rudraprayag was created by dividing the district of Pauri. In 2000, when the new state of Uttarakhand was created, the districts of Pauri, Tehri, Uttarkashi, Chamoli, Rudraprayag, and Haridwar became part of the new state. At present the eparchy of Bijnor consists of a part of the district of Bijnor in Uttar Pradesh and districts of Pauri, Rudraprayag, Chamoli, Tehri, Uttarkashi and a part of Haridwar in Uttarakhand. Pope Paul VI raised the apostolic exarchate of Bijnor to an eparchy by the papal bull Quae cum Romano on 26 February 1977, and Apostolic Exarch Gratian Mundadan CMI was appointed its first Bishop. == Eparchy timeline == 23 March 1972 \u2013 Erection of Apostolic Exarchate of Bijnor by the papal bull Beatorum Apostolorum of Pope Paul VI.
