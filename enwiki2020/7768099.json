    "text": "\"L'amour de ma vie\" (English translation: \"The Love of My Life\") was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1986, performed in French by Canadian singer Sherisse Laurence. The song was composed by Alain Garcia, Rolf Soja and Frank Dostal. This was Soja and Dostal's second entry in the Contest, in 1978 they had written/composed/produced Spanish disco duo Baccara's \"Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais?\" which only finished 7th in the Contest but still became a considerable commercial success in Continental Europe and Scandinavia. \"L'amour de ma vie\" is notably different from their previous entry, it is a ballad with an arrangement influenced by contemporary synthpop, in which Laurence describes her desire to find the love of her life and what sort of a personality he would have. The verses are memorable for the repetition of the French phrase \"sans raison\" (\"for no reason\") at the end of each line. Laurence also recorded the song in an English-language version, as \"The Love of My Life\". The song was performed first on the night (preceding Yugoslavia's Doris Dragovi\u0107 with \"\u017deljo moja\"). At the close of voting, it had received 117 points, placing 3rd in a field of 20. It was succeeded as Luxembourgish representative at the 1987 contest by Plastic Bertrand with \"Amour Amour\". ==Sources and external links== * Official Eurovision Song Contest site, history by year, 1986 * Detailed info & lyrics, The Diggiloo Thrush, \"L'amour de ma vie\".
