The Indonesian government quickly set up provinces and appointed governors to the provinces. The Sumatran province, which consisted of the North Sumatra, Central Sumatra, and South Sumatra sub-province was formed, and Teuku Muhammad Hasan was inaugurated as the governor of the province on 29 September 1945. The North Sumatra sub-province consisted of Aceh, Tapanuli, and East Sumatra Residency. As the governor of Sumatra, Hasan appointed three junior governors to act as his deputies in the residencies. Nasution was inaugurated by Hasan as the Junior Governor of North Sumatra on 14 April 1947. His inauguration was held at the Elephant Division II building in Siantar, and was attended by Teuku Muhammad Daudsjah, the Resident of Aceh, Ferdinand Lumbantobing, the Resident of North Sumatra, and Abubakar Jaar, the Resident of East Sumatra. At first, it was decided that the capital of the North Sumatra sub-province was Medan, but due to the occupation of Medan by the Dutch army, it was decided that the location of Nasution's inauguration, Siantar, as the capital of the sub- province. Some time later, Siantar was occupied by the Dutch army, so the government of the sub-province decided to move the capital to Kutaraja, Aceh. Even though Siantar was occupied by the Dutch army, Nasution recklessly visited his mother's house in the Mandailing Village in Siantar. When Nasution arrived, his mother's house was surrounded by the Dutch army. He was arrested and brought to Medan under tight escort. He was put into house arrest under a heavy surveillance in a home owned by a man named Yusuf. During his house arrest, Nasution observed the preparations for the formation of the State of East Sumatra, which was attended by notable figures in East Sumatra.
