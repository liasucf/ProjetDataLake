    "text": "Selena Jane Malijarri Uibo (born 25 March 1985) is an Australian politician. She is a Labor member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly since 2016, representing the electorate of Arnhem. ==Early life and career== Uibo was born in the Northern Territory. Her mother is a Nunggubuyu woman from Numbulwar and Wanindilyakwa from Groote Eylandt both located in south-east Arnhem Land. Her father was born in Sydney. She went to school in Batchelor and Darwin and participated in many youth programs including the Aboriginal Islander Tertiary Aspirations Program, YMCA Youth Parliament and the National Youth Round Table. Uibo graduated valedictorian from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Education (Secondary) in 2010. She began her teaching career at the Casuarina Senior College before moving to Numbulwar in 2012, where she was acting senior teacher. In 2013 she won a Commonwealth Bank Foundation award for teaching financial literacy to her secondary students. Uibo also won the NT Award for Excellence in Teaching or Leadership in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education in both the Arnhem region for the Northern Territory. ==Politics== Uibo was elected into the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 2016 in the electoral division of Arnhem, previously held by Larisa Lee. She won the seat on 64 percent of the two-party vote, reverting Arnhem to its traditional status as a safe Labor seat. Lee, who served under three different banners during her tenure (Country Liberal, independent, Palmer United and independent again), won only 117 votes. Meanwhile, Uibo won 54 percent of the primary vote, enough to reclaim the seat for Labor without the need for preferences. In a reshuffle of the Gunner Ministry on 26 June 2018, Uibo was promoted to the Cabinet of the Northern Territory as Minister for Education and Minister for Training. ==References== Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Category:Indigenous Australian politicians Category:Women members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Category:University of Queensland alumni Category:21st- century Australian politicians Category:21st-century Australian women politicians ",
