    "text": "F. Michael Christ in 2011 Francis Michael Christ (born 7 June 1955) is an American mathematician, specializing in harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, and several complex variables. He is known for the Christ\u2013Kiselev maximal inequality. ==Biography== He received in 1977 from Harvey Mudd College his bachelor's degree and in 1982 from the University of Chicago his PhD under the supervision of Alberto Calder\u00f3n with thesis Restrictions of the Fourier transform to submanifolds of low codimension. At Princeton University (where he worked with Elias M. Stein), Christ was from 1982 to 1984 an instructor and from 1984 to 1986 an assistant professor. He was at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) from 1986 to 1988 an associate professor and from 1988 to 1996 a full professor. In 1996 he became a full professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Christ was a Sloan Fellow for the academic year 1986\u20131987. He was an invited speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1990 in Kyoto and in 1998 in Berlin. In 1997 he shared with David E. Barrett the Stefan Bergman Prize. ==Selected publications== ===Articles=== * Christ, Michael; Journ\u00e9, Jean-Lin. Polynomial growth estimates for multilinear singular integral operators.
