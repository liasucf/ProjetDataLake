    "text": "Woldemar Bargiel. Woldemar Bargiel (3 October 182823 February 1897) was a German composer. ==Life== Bargiel was born in Berlin, and was the younger maternal half-brother of Clara Schumann. Bargiel\u2019s father Adolph was a well- known piano and voice teacher while his mother Marianne Tromlitz had previously been unhappily married to Clara\u2019s father, Friedrich Wieck. Clara was nine years older than Woldemar. Throughout their lives, they enjoyed a warm relationship. The initial opportunities which led to the success and recognition he enjoyed were due to Clara, who introduced him to both Robert Schumann and Felix Mendelssohn. Bargiel received his first lessons at home and later with the well-known Berlin teacher of music theory Siegfried Wilhelm Dehn. Upon the suggestion of Schumann and the recommendation of Mendelssohn, Bargiel at age 16 went to study at the famous Leipzig Conservatory with some of the leading men of music: Ignaz Moscheles (piano) and Niels Gade (composition), and also with Julius Rietz.Stowell, Robin (2003). . Cambridge University Press. page 346. . After leaving Leipzig in 1850, he returned to Berlin where he tried to make ends meet by giving private lessons. Eventually, Clara and Robert were able to arrange for the publication of some of his early works, including his First Piano Trio. Subsequently, Bargiel held positions at the conservatories in Cologne and Rotterdam (where he met Hermine Tours, his future wife, sister of the composer Berthold Tours) before accepting a position at the prestigious Hochschule fur Musik in Berlin where he taught for the rest of his life. Among his many students were Paul Juon, Waldemar von Bau\u00dfnern, Alexander Ilyinsky and Leopold Godowsky. Besides teaching and composing, Bargiel served with Brahms as co-editor of the complete editions of Schumann's and Chopin's works. While Bargiel did not write a lot of music, most of what he composed was well thought out and shows solid musical craftsmanship. His chamber music\u2014he wrote four string quartets, a string octet and three piano trios\u2014represents an important part of his output. ==Selected list of compositions== *W/o Opus- String Quartet No.1 in E major(1848) *W/o Opus- String Quartet No.2 in D minor(1848-50) *Op. 1 3 Character pieces for piano (1848-1850) *Op. 2 Character pieces for piano (1850) *Op. 3 Three nocturnes for piano (1849\u201351)Available in score at IMSLP *Op. 4 Six bagatelles for piano (1851) *Op. 6 Piano trio No. 1 in F major (1851) *Op. 7 Suite for piano, four hands (1853) *Op. 8 Three character pieces for piano (1853) *Op. 9 Three fantasy-pieces for piano (1853\u201354) *Op. 10 Violin Sonata in F minor (1854) *Op. 13 Scherzo for piano (1857)Austrian National Library Musiksammlung digital catalog *Op.15 Fantasy Piece for Piano (1856) *Op. 15a Octet for strings in C minor (I.Adagio - Allegro appassionato; II.Andante sostenuto - Allegro - Tempo 1 - Tempo 2; III.
