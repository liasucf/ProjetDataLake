    "text": "Elisha Mitchell (August 19, 1793 \u2013 June 27, 1857) was an American educator, geologist and Presbyterian minister. His geological studies led to the identification of North Carolina's Mount Mitchell as the highest peak east of the Mississippi River. ==Early life== Elisha Mitchell was born August 19, 1793, in Washington, Connecticut. He was graduated from Yale University in 1813, where he studied under chemist Benjamin Silliman, whose courses would shape his own teaching career. ==Mitchell at the University of North Carolina== Mitchell began his career as a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1818, teaching math and natural philosophy. In 1825, he began teaching geology \u2013 the field with which he would be primarily associated for the rest of his life.Watson, Elgiva D. \u2018Elisha Mitchell.\u2019 Originally published in the \"Dictionary of North Carolina Biography,\" edited by William S. Powell. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1991. Available at:http://docsouth.unc.edu/browse/bios/pn0001194_bio.html In addition to teaching, Mitchell also served as the university's bursar, accountant, and acting president at various times; he also led chapel services, as he had been ordained by the Presbytery of Orange in Hillsborough, NC, in 1821. ==Discovery of \u201cMount Mitchell\u201d== Mitchell completed a geographical survey of North Carolina in 1828 and observed a peak in the Black Mountains he believed to be higher than Grandfather Mountain, at that time thought to be the highest in the region.Mewborn, Suzanne. \u2018Elisha Mitchell and his mountain.\u2019 Originally published in Tar Heel Junior Historian, volume 46, no. 1 (Fall 2006). Published by the North Carolina Museum of History. Available at: http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-newnation/4391 In 1835, he first measured the height of this mountain, at the time known as Black Dome. Through subsequent measurements in 1838 and 1844, Mitchell proved it was higher than New Hampshire\u2019s Mount Washington, establishing the peak as the highest above sea level in the Eastern US. Watch belonging to Elisha Mitchell, which broke during his fatal fall and shows his exact time of death. North Carolina Collection, Wilson Special Collections Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2012 ==Findings challenged== Elisha Mitchell fell to his death at nearby Mitchell Falls in 1857, having returned to verify his earlier measurements, which had been challenged by state senator Thomas Clingman, a former student of Mitchell\u2019s. He was originally buried in Asheville, but was reinterred in a tomb on the mountain in 1858. In 1881\u201382 the U.S. Geological Survey upheld Mitchell\u2019s measurements and officially named his peak Mt. Mitchell. At high, Mt. Mitchell is the highest point east of the Mississippi River. Tomb of Elisha Mitchell on the peak of Mount Mitchell ==Honors== The Journal of the Elisha Mitchell Scientific Society, published by the North Carolina Academy of Science, was founded in his honor in 1883. On August 18, 1888, University of North Carolina Alumni erected an obelisk memorializing him at his grave site atop Mt. Mitchell. On January 1st, 1915, high winds destroyed the monument. It was replaced 13 years later by the funeral cairn and plaque currently marking his tomb. \"University\" is misspelled on the plaque. Mitchell County, North Carolina, is named after him. Mount Mitchell, however, is not within the boundaries of Mitchell County, but in neighbouring Yancey County. ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:American geologists Category:1793 births Category:1857 deaths Category:Leaders of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Category:University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faculty Category:Mountaineering deaths ",
