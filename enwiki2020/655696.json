Alevis are found primarily in Turkey among ethnic Turks and Kurds, and make up approximately 11% of the population; but recent figures suggest Alevis number in the region of 20 to 25 million. They are the second-largest Islamic sect in Turkey, with Sunni Hanafi Islam being the largest. After the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, a dispute arose about his legitimate successor. The Islamic community was divided into those who adhered to Abu Bakr, named Sunnis, and those who sided with Ali, called Shia. Concurrently, people who sided with Ali were called Alevis, defined as \"those who adore Ali and his family\".Jorgen S Nielsen Muslim Political Participation in Europe Edinburgh University Press 2013 page 255 Therefore, some authors use Shiism synonymously with Alevism.Rasim \u00d6sg\u00fcr D\u00f6nmez, Fazilet Ahu \u00d6zmen Gendered Identities: Criticizing Patriarchy in Turkey Lexington Books 2013 page 150 However, Alevism is not Twelver Shiism, but rather its own Sufi centric form of Shiism. and although they share some common beliefs with the Twelver Shia, their rites and practices are different from Twelver Shiism. Thus Alevism incorporates Turkish beliefs present during the 14th century, mixed with Shia, Sunni and Sufi beliefs that were adopted by some Turkish and later Kurdish tribes. Alevis have strong links with Twelver Shia Islam (such as importance of the Ahl al-Bayt, the A\u015fura, the Mourning of Muharram, commemorating Karbala), but do not follow taqlid towards a Marja' \"source of emulation\". Some practices of the Alevis are based on the Sufi doctrines of the Bektashi Tariqa. == Etymology == \"Alevi\" () is generally explained as referring to Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad. The name represents a Turkish form of the word \u2018Alawi () \"of or pertaining to Ali\". A minority viewpoint is that of the Ishikists, who assert, \"Alevi\" was derived from \"Alev\" (\"flame\" in Turkish) in reference to fire which is extensively used in Alevi rituals. According to them the use of candles is based on Quran chapter 24, verses 35 and 36: > \"God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is > like a niche within which there is a lamp, the lamp is encased in a glass, > the glass is like a radiant planet, which is lit from a blessed olive tree > that is neither of the east nor of the west, its oil nearly gives off light > even if not touched by fire. Light upon light, God guides to His light whom > He pleases. And God sets forth examples for the people, and God is aware of > all things. (Lit is such a Light) in houses, which God has permitted to be > raised to honor; for the celebration, in them, of His name: In them is He > glorified in the mornings and in the evenings, (again and again).\") == Beliefs == According to scholar Soner \u00c7a\u011faptay, Alevism is a \"relatively unstructured interpretation of Islam\". Journalist Patrick Kingsley states that for some self-described Alevi, their religion is \"simply a cultural identity, rather than a form of worship\". Many teachings are based on an orally transmitted tradition, traditionally kept secret from outsiders (but now widely accessible). Alevis commonly profess the Islamic shahada, but adding \"Ali is the friend of God\". The basis for Alevis' most distinctive beliefs is found in the Buyruks (compiled writings and dialogues of Sheikh Safi-ad-din Ardabili, and other worthies). Also included are hymns (nefes) by figures such as Shah Ismail or Pir Sultan Abdal, stories of Hajji Bektash and other lore. === God === In Alevi cosmology, God is also called Al-Haqq (the Truth)Hande S\u00f6zer Managing Invisibility: Dissimulation and Identity Maintenance among Alevi Bulgarian Turks BRILL 2014 page 114 or referred to as Allah. God created life, so the created world can reflect His Being.Tord Olsson, Elisabeth Ozdalga, Catharina Raudvere Alevi Identity: Cultural, Religious and Social Perspectives Tord Olsson, Elisabeth Ozdalga, Catharina Raudvere page 25 Alevis believe in the unity of Allah, Muhammad, and Ali, but this is not a trinity composed of God and the historical figures of Muhammad and Ali. Rather, Muhammad and Ali are representations of Allah's light (and not of Allah himself), being neither independent from God, nor separate characteristics of Him. {| style=\"border: 1px black solid; margin-center:1em; text-align: left;\" align=\"center\" width=\"300\" ! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:DarkKhaki\" align=\"center\" |Haqq-Muhammad-Ali |- style=\"background:DarkKhaki\" | ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:DarkKhaki\" align=\"center\" |Muhammad-Ali ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:DarkKhaki\" align=\"center\" |ALLAH |- style=\"background:DarkKhaki\" | ! colspan=\"1\" style=\"background:DarkKhaki\" align=\"center\" |ALI ! colspan=\"1\" style=\"background:DarkKhaki\" align=\"center\" |MUHAMMAD |- style=\"background:PaleGoldenrod\" | | align=\"center\" | 193px | align=\"center\" | 250px | align=\"center\" | 177px |- style=\"background:PaleGoldenrod\" | | colspan=\"3\" align=\"left\"|Left side: Ali ibn Abi Talib, Center: Muhammad, Right side: Allah. (Reflections of the Qizilbash-Bektashi belief) |} In Alevi writings are many references to the unity of Muhammad and Ali, such as: A representation of the sword of Ali, the Zulfiqar in an Ottoman emblem. The phrase \"For the love of Allah-Muhammad-Ali\" (Hakk-Muhammed-Ali a\u015fk\u0131na) is common to several Alevi prayers. === Spirits and afterlife === Alevis believe in the immortality of the soul. Alevis, who believe in a literal existence of supernatural beings, also believe in good and bad angels (melekler), basically the same as Sunni Islam. Alevis, believe in Satan who is the one that encourages human's evil desires (nefs). Alevis, believe in an existence of spiritual creatures, such as the Jinns (Cinler) and the evil eye. === Scriptures and prophets === Like Islam, all Alevis acknowledge at least the four scriptures revealed from heaven.Tord Olsson, Elisabeth Ozdalga, Catharina Raudvere Alevi Identity: Cultural, Religious and Social Perspectives Tord Olsson, Elisabeth Ozdalga, Catharina Raudvere page 72 Additionally, Alevis don't mind to look to other religious books outside the four major ones as sources for their beliefs including Hadiths, Nahjul Balagha and Buyruks. Alevism also acknowledges the Islamic prophet Mohammed (peygamber). {| style=\"border: 1px black solid; margin-center:1em; text-align: left;\" align=\"center\" width=\"300\" ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:DarkKhaki\" align=\"center\" |\"Alevi-Bektashis acknowledge they are from Ahl al Kitab\" by stating that the last four holy books (Quran, Gospel, Torah and Psalms) has the same degree of importance in guiding people to the Divine Truth.

Each Imam represents a different aspect of the world. They are realized as twelve services or On \u0130ki Hizmet which are performed by members of the Alevi community. Each Imam is believed to be a reflection of Ali ibn Abu Talib, the first Imam of the Shi'ites, and there are references to the \"First Ali\" (Birinci Ali), Imam Hasan the \"Second 'Ali\" (\u0130kinci Ali), and so on up to the \"Twelfth 'Ali\" (Onikinci Ali), Imam Mehdi. The Twelfth Imam is hidden and represents the Messianic Age. === Plurality === There are two sides to creation, one from a spiritual center to plurality, another from plurality to the spiritual center. Plurality is the separation of pure consciousness from the divine source. It is seen as a curtain alienating creation from the divine source and an illusion which called the Z\u0101her\u012b or exoteric side to reality. The hidden or true nature of creation is called the b\u0101\u1e6den\u012b or the esoteric. The plurality in nature is attributed to the infinite potential energy of Kull-i Nafs when it takes corporeal form as it descends into being from Allah. During the Cem ceremony, the cantor or a\u015f\u0131k sings: :\"All of us alive or lifeless are from one, this is ineffable, Sultan. :For to love and to fall in love has been my fate from time immemorial.\" This is sung as a reminder that the reason for creation is love, so that the followers may know themselves and each other and that they may love that which they know.

Although it is common to refer to Ali and Haji Bektash Veli or the other Alevi saints as manifestations of the perfect human being, the Perfect Human Being is also identified with our true identity as pure consciousness, hence the Qur'anic concept of human beings not having original sin, consciousness being pure and perfect. The human task is to fully realize this state while still in material human form. The perfect human being is also defined in practical terms, as one who is in full moral control of his or her hands, tongue and loins (eline diline beline sahip); treats all kinds of people equally (yetmi\u015f iki millete ayn\u0131 g\u00f6zle bakar); and serves the interests of others. One who has achieved this kind of enlightenment is also called \"eren\" or \"m\u00fcnevver\" (m\u016bnavvar).

As\u0101d\u02bfull\u0101h: Nickname given by Muhammad to describe his kinsman Ali. Asadullah means \"Lion of Allah\", which is also well known as \"Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b\". Alevism, Bektashism and Sufism consider Ali as the holder of the divine secrets and esoteric meaning of Islam, transmitted to him by Muhammad. \"I am the city of knowledge, Ali is its gate.\" \u2014Muhammad. Alevi used to be grouped as (\"redheads\"), a generic term used by Sunni Muslims in the Ottoman Empire for the various Shia sects from the 15th century. Many other names exist (often for subgroupings), among them Tahtac\u0131 \"Woodcutters\", \"Bards\" and . === Creed and jurisprudence === Sources differ on how important formal doctrine is among contemporary Alevi. According to scholar Russell Powell there is a tradition of informal \"Dede\" courts within the Alevi society, but regarding Islamic jurisprudence or fiqh there has been \"little scholarship on Alevi influences\" in it. Other sources put more emphasis on creed and doctrine. Alev\u012bs follow Tasawwuf\u012b-Batiniyya aqidah (creed) of Maym\u016bn\u2019al-Q\u0101dd\u0101h\u012b according to one source (Dede \u0130zzettin Do\u011fan).\"Muhammad ibn \u0100liyy\u2019\u016bl Cill\u012b aqidah\" of \"Maym\u016bn ibn Abu\u2019l-Q\u0101sim Sulaiman ibn Ahmad ibn at-Tabar\u0101n\u012b fiqh\" (S\u016blaiman Affandy, Al-B\u0101k\u016brat\u2019\u016bs S\u016blaiman\u2019\u012byyah \u2013 Family tree of the Nusayri Tariqat, pp. 14\u201315, Beirut, 1873.)Both Muhammad ibn \u0100liyy\u2019\u016bl Cill\u012b and Maym\u016bn ibn Abu\u2019l-Q\u0101sim\u2019at-Tabar\u0101n\u012b were the murids of Al-Kha\u1e63\u012bb\u012b, the founder of the Nusayri tariqat. In contrast the Sunni majority of Turkey's population follows Maturidi aqidah of the Hanafi fiqh and Ash'ari aqidah of the Shafi'i fiqh. According to another source, Alevi aqidah (creed or theological convictions) is based upon a syncretic fiqh system called as Batiniyya-Sufism/Ismailism which incorporates some sentiments of Sevener-Qarmatians, originally introduced by Abu\u2019l-Kh\u0101tt\u0101b Muhammad ibn Abu Zaynab al-Asad\u012b, and later developed by \"Maymun al-Q\u0101dd\u0101h\" and his son \"\u02bfAbd All\u0101h ibn Maymun\", and Mu'tazila with a strong belief in the Twelve Imams. * \"The Alevi-Turks\" has a unique belief system tracing back to Kaysanites and Khurramites which are considered Ghulat Shia Islam by some. According to Turkish scholar Abd\u00fclbaki G\u00f6lpinarli, the Qizilbash (Red-Heads) of the 16th century \u2013 a religious and political movement in Azerbaijan that helped to establish the Safavid dynasty \u2013 were spiritual descendants of the Khurramites.Roger M. Savory (ref. Abd\u00fclbaki G\u00f6lpinarli), Encyclopaedia of Islam, \"Kizil-Bash\", Online Edition 2005 * Among the members of the \"Qizilbash-Tariqa\" who are considered as a sub-sect of the Alevis, two figures firstly Abu Muslim Khorasani , who assisted Abbasid Caliphate to beat the Umayyad Caliphate but later eliminated and murdered by Caliph Al-Mansur and secondly Babak Khorramdin who incited a rebellion against Abbasid Caliphate and consequently was killed by Caliph al- Mu'tasim, are highly respected. This belief provides strong clues about their Kaysanites Shia and Khurramites origins. In addition, Safaviyya Tariqa leader Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl is a highly regarded individual in the belief of Alevi-Qizilbash- Tariqa associating them with the Imamah (Shia Twelver doctrine) conviction of Twelver Shia Islam. * On the other hand, Bektashis has a conviction of Batiniyya Ismailism and Hurufism with a strong belief in the Twelve Imams. * Qizilbash-Alevi-Bektashis differ from followers of Ja'fari jurisprudence, in their Batiniyya-Hurufism and Qarmatian-Isma'ilism sentiments.\u00d6zt\u00fcrk, Ya\u015far Nuri, En-el Hak \u0130syan\u0131 (The Anal Haq Rebellion) \u2013 Hall\u00e2c-\u0131 Mans\u00fbr (Dara\u011fac\u0131nda Mira\u00e7 \u2013 Mira\u00e7 on Gallows), Vol 1 and 2, Yeni Boyut, 2011. == Differences with other Muslim denominations == Qizilbash and the Bektashi Order shared common religious beliefs and practices becoming intermingled as Alevis in spite of many local variations. Isolated from both the Sunni Ottomans and the Twelver Shi`a Safavids, Alevis developed traditions, practices, and doctrines by the early 17th century which marked them as a closed autonomous religious community. As a result of the immense pressures to conform to Sunni Islam, Alevis developed a tradition of opposition to all forms of external religion. Alevis accept Twelver Shi\u2018a beliefs about Ali and the Twelve Imams. Moreover, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed Alevis to be part of the Shia fold in the 1970s.Nasr, V: \"The Shia Revival,\" page 1. Norton, W. W. & Company, Inc, 2006 There are, however, Alevi philosophies, customs, and rituals that are appreciably different than those of Twelver Shias in Iraq, Iran, and Lebanon. In particular, much of mystical language in the Alevi tradition is inspired by Sufi traditions. Some sources link Alevism in particular to the heterodox syncretic Sufi group known as the Bektashi Order, which is also Shi'ite. Furthermore, during the period of Ottoman Empire, Alevis were forbidden to proselytise, and Alevism regenerated itself internally by paternal descent. To prevent penetration by hostile outsiders, the Alevis insisted on strict endogamy which eventually made them into a quasi-ethnic group. Alevi taboos limited interaction with the dominant Sunni political-religious centre. Excommunication was the ultimate punishment threatening those who married outsiders, cooperated with outsiders economically, or ate with outsiders. It was also forbidden to use the state (Sunni) courts. ===Alawites=== Similarities with the Alawite sect in Syria exist. Both are viewed as heterodox, syncretic Islamic minorities, whose names both mean \"devoted to Ali,\" (the son-in-law and cousin of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, and fourth caliph following Muhammad as leader of the Muslims), and are located primarily in the Eastern Mediterranean. Like mainstream Shia they are known as \"Twelvers\" as they both recognize the Twelve Imams. How the two minorities relate is disputed. According to scholar Marianne Aringberg-Laanatza, \"the Turkish Alevis... do not relate themselves in any way to the Alawites in Syria.\" However journalist Jeffrey Gettlemand claims that both Alevi and the less than one million Alawite minority in Turkey \"seem to be solidly behind Syria\u2019s embattled strongman, Bashar al-Assad\" and leary of Syrian Sunni rebels. DW journalist Dorian Jones states that Turkish Alevis are suspicious of the anti-Assad uprising in Syria. \"They are worried of the repercussions for Alawites there, as well as for themselves.\" Some sources (Martin van Bruinessen and Jamal Shah) mistake Alawites living in Turkey to be Alevis (calling Alevis \"a blanket term for a large number of different heterodox communities\"), but others do not, giving a list of the differences between the two groups. These include their liturgical languages (Turkish or Kurdish for Alevi, Arabic for Alawites). Opposing political nationalism, with Alawites supporting their ruling dictatorship and considering Turks (including Alevis) an \"opponent\" of its Arab \"historic interests\". (Even Kurdish and Balkan Alevi populations pray in Turkish.) Unlike Alevis, Alawites not only traditionally lack mosques but do not maintain their own places for worship, except for shrines to their leaders. Alevi \"possess an extensive and widely-read religious literature, mainly composed of spiritual songs, poems, and epic verse.\" Their origins are also different: The Alawite faith was founded in the ninth century by Abu Shuayb Muhammad ibn Nusayr. Alevism started in the 14th century by mystical Islamic dissenters in Central Asia, and represent more of a movement rather than a sect. == Practices == The Alevi spiritual path (yol) is commonly understood to take place through four major life-stages, or \"gates\". These may be further subdivided into \"four gates, forty levels\" (D\u00f6rt Kap\u0131 K\u0131rk Makam). The first gate (religious law) is considered elementary (and this may be perceived as subtle criticism of other Muslim traditions). The following are major crimes that cause an Alevi to be declared d\u00fc\u015fk\u00fcn (shunned):Also see, \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, ibid, pp. 78\u201381. In the old days, marrying a Sunni [Yezide ku\u015fak \u00e7\u00f6zmek] was also accepted as an offense that led to the state of d\u00fc\u015fk\u00fcn. See Alevi Buyruks * killing a person * committing adultery * divorcing one's wife * stealing * backbiting/gossiping Most Alevi activity takes place in the context of the second gate (spiritual brotherhood), during which one submits to a living spiritual guide (dede, pir, m\u00fcr\u015fid). The existence of the third and fourth gates is mostly theoretical, though some older Alevis have apparently received initiation into the third.Kristina Kehl-Bordrogi reports this among the . See her article \"The significance of m\u00fcsahiplik among the Alevis\" in Synchronistic Religious Communities in the Near East (co-edited by her, with B. Kellner-Heinkele & A. Otter-Beaujean), Brill 1997, p. 131 ff. === Dede === A Dede (literally meaning grandfather) is a traditional leader that is claimed to be from the lineage of Prophet Muhammad that performs ritual baptisms for newborns, officiates at funerals, and organises weekly gatherings at cemevis. === Cem and Cemevi === Ba\u011flama. Alevi cultural and other social activities take place in assembly houses (Cemevi). The ceremony's prototype is the Muhammad's nocturnal ascent into heaven, where he beheld a gathering of forty saints (K\u0131rklar Meclisi), and the Divine Reality made manifest in their leader, Ali. The Cem ceremony features music, singing, and dancing (Sam\u0101h) in which both women and men participate. Rituals are performed in Turkish, Zazaki, Kurmanji and other local languages. ;Ba\u011flama During the Cem ceremony the \u00c2\u015f\u0131k plays the Ba\u011flama whilst singing spiritual songs, some of which are centuries old and well known amongst Alevis. Every song, called a Nefes, has spiritual meaning and aims to teach the participants important lessons. One such song goes thus: :\"Learn from your mistakes and be knowledgeable, :Don't look for faults in others, :Look at 73 different people in the same way, :God loves and created them all, so don't say anything against them.\" ;Sam\u0101h A family of ritual dances characterized by turning and swirling, is an inseparable part of any cem. Sam\u0101h is performed by men and women together, to the accompaniment of the Ba\u011flama. The dances symbolize (for example) the revolution of the planets around the Sun (by man and woman turning in circles), and the putting off of one's self and uniting with God. ;G\u00f6rg\u00fc Cemi The Rite of Integration (g\u00f6rg\u00fc cemi) is a complex ritual occasion in which a variety of tasks are allotted to incumbents bound together by extrafamilial brotherhood (m\u00fcsahiplik), who undertake a dramatization of unity and integration under the direction of the spiritual leader (dede). ;Dem The love of the creator for the created and vice versa is symbolised in the Cem ceremony by the use of fruit juice and/or red wine [Dem] which represents the intoxication of the lover in the beloved. During the ceremony Dem is one of the twelve duties of the participants. (see above) ;Sohbet At the closing of the cem ceremony the Dede who leads the ceremony engages the participants in a discussion (chat), this discussion is called a sohbet. === Twelve services === There are twelve services () performed by the twelve ministers of the cem. # Dede: This is the leader of the Cem who represents Muhammad and Ali. The Dede receives confession from the attendees at the beginning of the ceremony. He also leads funerals, M\u00fcsahiplik, marriage ceremonies and circumcisions. The status of Dede is hereditary and he must be a descendant of Ali and Fatima. # Rehber: This position represents Husayn. The Rehber is a guide to the faithful and works closely with the Dede in the community. # G\u00f6zc\u00fc: This position represents Abu Dharr al-Ghifari. S/he is the assistant to the Rehber.

Mourning of Muharram and the remembrance of this event by Jafaris, Alevis and Bektashis together in Ottoman Empire. Painted by Fausto Zonaro. Newruz \"New Day\" is the Kurdish New Year observed on 21 March (the Spring equinox) as a celebration of newness and reconciliation. It is celebrated by many modern Turkic peoples as well. Apart from the original beliefs of the Zoroastrians regarding the New Year, Alevis also celebrate and commemorate the birth of Ali, his wedding with Fatima, the rescue of Yusuf from the well, and the creation of the world on this day. Various cem ceremonies and special programs are held. ==== Mourning of Muharram ==== Husayn at Karbala. The Muslim month of Muharram begins 20 days after Eid ul-Adha (). Alevis observe a fast for the first twelve days. This is called \"\", \"\" or \"\" (Mourning of Muharram). This culminates in the festival of Ashura (), which commemorates the martyrdom of Husayn at Karbala. The fast is broken with a special dish (also called a\u015fure) prepared from a variety (often twelve) of fruits, nuts, and grains. Many events are associated with this celebration, including the salvation of Husayn's son Ali ibn Husayn from the massacre at Karbala, thus allowing the bloodline of the family of Muhammad to continue. ==== H\u0131d\u0131rellez ==== A Persian miniature depicting Elijah and al-Khi\u1e0dr (A miniature version of Stories of the Prophets). H\u0131d\u0131rellez honors the mysterious figure Khidr () who is sometimes identified with Elijah (Ilyas), and is said to have drunk of the water of life. Some hold that Khidr comes to the rescue of those in distress on land, while Elijah helps those at sea; and that they meet at a rose tree in the evening of every 6 May. The festival is also celebrated in parts of the Balkans by the name of \"Erdelez,\" where it falls on the same day as \u0110ur\u0111evdan or St. George's Day. Khidr is also honored with a three-day fast in mid- February called H\u0131z\u0131r Orucu. In addition to avoiding any sort of comfort or enjoyment, Alevis also abstain from food and water for the entire day, though they do drink liquids other than water during the evening. Note that the dates of the Khidr holidays can differ among Alevis, most of whom use a lunar calendar, but some a solar calendar. ==== M\u00fcsahiplik ==== M\u00fcsahiplik (roughly, \"Companionship\") is a covenant relationship between two men of the same age, preferably along with their wives. In a ceremony in the presence of a dede the partners make a lifelong commitment to care for the spiritual, emotional, and physical needs of each other and their children. The ties between couples who have made this commitment is at least as strong as it is for blood relatives, so much so that m\u00fcsahiplik is often called spiritual brotherhood (manevi karde\u015flik). The children of covenanted couples may not marry.Krisztina Kehl- Bodrogi. 1988. Die Kizilbash/Aleviten, pp. 182\u2013204. Krisztina Kehl-Bodrogi reports that the identify m\u00fcsahiplik with the first gate (\u015feriat), since they regard it as a precondition for the second (tarikat). Those who attain to the third gate (marifat, \"gnosis\") must have been in a m\u00fcsahiplik relationship for at least twelve years. Entry into the third gate dissolves the m\u00fcsahiplik relationship (which otherwise persists unto death), in a ceremony called \u00d6z Verme \u00c2yini (\"ceremony of giving up the self\"). The value corresponding to the second gate (and necessary to enter the third) is \u00e2\u015final\u0131k (\"intimacy,\" perhaps with God). Its counterpart for the third gate is called pe\u015finelik; for the fourth gate (h\u00e2kikat, Ultimate Truth), c\u0131ng\u0131lda\u015fl\u0131k or cengilde\u015flik (translations uncertain).See again \"The significance of m\u00fcsahiplik among the Alevis\" in Synchronistic Religious Communities in the Near East (co-edited by her, with B. Kellner-Heinkele & A. Otter-Beaujean), Brill 1997, p. 131 ff. ==== Folk practices ==== It is a common Alevi-Sunni tradition to distribute lokma publicly in Turkey. Many folk practices may be identified, though few of them are specific to the Alevis. In this connection, scholar Martin van Bruinessen notes a sign from Turkey's Ministry of Religion, attached to Istanbul's shrine of Ey\u00fcp Sultan, which presents > ...a long list of \u2018superstitious\u2019 practices that are emphatically declared > to be non-Islamic and objectionable, such as lighting candles or placing > \u2018wishing stones\u2019 on the tomb, tying pieces of cloth to the shrine or to the > trees in front of it, throwing money on the tomb, asking the dead directly > for help, circling seven times around the trees in the courtyard or pressing > one\u2019s face against the walls of the t\u00fcrbe in the hope of a supernatural > cure, tying beads to the shrine and expecting supernatural support from > them, sacrificing roosters or turkeys as a vow to the shrine. The list is > probably an inventory of common local practices the authorities wish to > prevent from re-emerging.Religious practices in the Turco-Iranian World, > 2005. Other, similar practices include kissing door frames of holy rooms; not stepping on the threshold of holy buildings; seeking prayers from reputed healers; and making lokma and sharing it with others. ===== Ziyarat to sacred places ===== Performing ziyarat and du'a at the tombs of Alevi-Bektashi saints or pirs is quite common. Some of the most frequently visited sites are the shrines of \u015eahkulu and Karacaahmet (both in Istanbul), Abdal Musa (Antalya), Battal Gazi (Eski\u015fehir), the annual celebrations held at Hac\u0131bekta\u015f (16 August) and Sivas (the Pir Sultan Abdal K\u00fclt\u00fcr Etkinlikleri, 23\u201324 June). In contrast with the traditional secrecy of the Cem ceremony ritual, the events at these cultural centers and sites are open to the public. In the case of the Hacibekta\u015f celebration, since 1990 the activities there have been taken over by Turkey's Ministry of Culture in the interest of promoting tourism and Turkish patriotism rather than Alevi spirituality. Some Alevis make pilgrimages to mountains and other natural sites believed to be imbued with holiness. ===== Almsgiving ===== Alevis are expected to give Zakat but not in the Orthodox-Islamic sense rather there is no set formula or prescribed amount for annual charitable donation as there is in Orthodox Islam (2.5% of possessions above a certain minimum). Rather, they are expected to give the 'excess' according to Qur'an verse 2:219. A common method of Alevi almsgiving is through donating food (especially sacrificial animals) to be shared with worshippers and guests. Alevis also donate money to be used to help the poor, to support the religious, educational and cultural activities of Alevi centers and organizations (derg\u00e2h, vak\u0131f, dernek), and to provide scholarships for students. == Society == === Leadership structure === In contrast to the Bektashi tariqa, which like other Sufi orders is based on a silsila \"initiatory chain or lineage\" of teachers and their students, Alevi leaders succeed to their role on the basis of family descent. Perhaps ten percent of Alevis belong to a religious elite called ocak \"hearth\", indicating descent from Ali and/or various other saints and heroes. Ocak members are called ocakzades or \"sons of the hearth\". This system apparently originated with Safavid Persia. Alevi leaders are variously called murshid, pir, rehber or dede. Groups that conceive of these as ranks of a hierarchy (as in the Bektashi tariqa) disagree as to the order. The last of these, dede \"grandfather\", is the term preferred by the scholarly literature. Ocakzades may attain to the position of dede on the basis of selection (by a father from among several sons), character, and learning. In contrast to Alevi rhetoric on the equality of the sexes, it is generally assumed that only males may fill such leadership roles. Traditionally Dedes did not merely lead rituals, but led their communities, often in conjunction with local notables such as the a\u011fas (large landowners) of the Dersim Region. They also acted as judges or arbiters, presiding over village courts called D\u00fc\u015fk\u00fcnl\u00fck Meydan\u0131. Ordinary Alevi would owe allegiance to a particular dede lineage (but not others) on the basis of pre-existing family or village relations. Some fall instead under the authority of Bektashi dargah (lodges). In the wake of 20th century urbanization (which removed young laborers from the villages) and socialist influence (which looked upon the Dedes with suspicion), the old hierarchy has largely broken down. Many Dedes now receive salaries from Alevi cultural centers, which arguably subordinates their role. Such centers no longer feature community business or deliberation, such as the old ritual of reconciliation, but emphasize musical and dance performance to the exclusion of these.See Martin Stokes' study. Dedes are now approached on a voluntary basis, and their role has become more circumscribed \u2013 limited to religious rituals, research, and giving advice. === Position of women === According to John Shindeldecker \"Alevis are proud to point out that they are monogamous, Alevi women are encouraged to get the best education they can, and Alevi women are free to go into any occupation they choose.\" === Relations with other Muslim groups === Alevis are classified as a sect of Shia Islam, as Alevis accept Twelver Shi\u2018a beliefs about Ali and the Twelve Imams, and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini decreed Alevis to be part of the Shia fold in the 1970s. However, Alevi philosophies, customs, and rituals are appreciably different than those of mainstream, orthodox Ja'fari-Twelver Shi\u2018ah. According to more orthodox Shia Muslims, Alevis are labeled as \"Batiniyya\" groups since Alevis praise Ali beyond what mainstream Shia Muslims expect. According to Alevis, Ali and Muhammad are likened to the two sides of a coin, or the two halves of an apple. ==== Sufi elements in Alevism ==== Despite this essentially Shi\u2018i orientation, much of Aleviness' mystical language is inspired by Sufi traditions. For example, the Alevi concept of God is derived from the philosophy of Ibn Arabi and involves a chain of emanation from God, to spiritual man, earthly man, animals, plants, and minerals. The goal of spiritual life is to follow this path in the reverse direction, to unity with God, or Haqq (Reality, Truth). From the highest perspective, all is God (see Wahdat-ul-Wujood). Alevis admire Mansur Al-Hallaj, a 10th-century Sufi who was accused of blasphemy and subsequently executed in Baghdad for saying \"I am the Truth\" (Ana al-Haqq). There is some tension between folk tradition Aleviness and the Bektashi Order, which is a Sufi order founded on Alevi beliefs.Ataseven, I: \"The Alevi-Bektasi Legacy: Problems of Acquisition and Explanation\", page 1. Coronet Books Inc, 1997 In certain Turkish communities other Sufi orders (the Halveti-Jerrahi and some of the Rifa'i) have incorporated significant Alevi influence. ==== Relations with majority Sunnis ==== The relationship between Alevis and Sunnis is one of mutual suspicion and prejudice dating back to the Ottoman period. Hundreds of Alevis were murdered in sectarian violence in the years that preceded the 1980 coup, and as late as the 1990s dozens were killed with impunity. While pogroms have not occurred since them, the Erdogan has declared \u201ca cemevi is not a place of worship, it is a center for cultural activities. Muslims should only have one place of worship.\u201d Alevis claim that they have been subject to intolerant Sunni \"nationalism\" that has been unwilling to recognize Alevi \"uniqueness.\"Karin Vorhoff. 1995. Zwischen Glaube, Nation und neuer Gemeinschaft: Alevitische Identitat in der T\u00fcrkei der Gegenwart, pp. 95\u201396. == History == Alevis have been victims of pogroms during both Ottoman times and under the Turkish republic up until the 1990. === Seljuk period === During the great Turkish expansion from Central Asia into Iran and Anatolia in the Seljuk period (11\u201312th centuries), Turkmen nomad tribes accepted a Sufi and pro-Ali form of Islam that co-existed with some of their pre-Islamic customs. Their conversion to Islam in this period was achieved largely through the efforts not of textual scholars (ulema) expounding the finer points of Koranic exegesis and shari\u2018a law, but by charismatic Sufi dervishes whose cult of Muslim saint worship, mystical divination and millenarianism spoke more directly to the steppe mindset. These tribes dominated Anatolia for centuries with their religious warriors (ghazi) spearheading the drive against Byzantines and Crusaders.https://ebookshia.com/upload/bookFiles/656/\u0634\u064a\u0639\u0647_\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646_\u0632\u064a\u0631_\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0647_\u0639\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a.PDF === Ottoman period === As in Khorasan and West Asia before, the Turkmens who spearheaded the Ottomans\u2019 drive into the Balkans and West Asia were more inspired by a vaguely Shiite folk Islam than by formal religion. Many times, Ottoman campaigns were accompanied or guided by Bekta\u015fi dervishes, spiritual heirs of the 13th century Sufi saint Haji Bektash Veli, himself a native of Khorasan. After the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, the Ottoman state became increasingly determined to assert its fiscal but also its juridical and political control over the farthest reaches of the Empire. The resulting Qizilbash revolts, a series of millenarian anti-state uprisings by the heterodox Turkmen population of Anatolia that culminated in the establishment of a militantly Shiite rival state in neighbouring Iran. The Ottoman Empire later proclaimed themselves its defenders against the Safavid Shia state and related sects. This created a gap between the Sunni Ottoman ruling elite and the Alevi Anatolian population. Anatolia became a battlefield between Safavids and Ottomans, each determined to include it in their empire. ===Republic=== According to Eren Sar\u0131, Alevi saw Kemal Atat\u00fcrk as a Mahdi \"savior sent to save them from the Sunni Ottoman yoke\". However, pogroms against Alevi did not cease after the establishment of Atat\u00fcrk's republic. In attacks against leftists in the 1970s, ultranationalists and reactionaries killed many Alevis. Malatya in 1978, Mara\u015f in 1979, and \u00c7orum in 1980 witnessed the murder of hundreds of Alevis, the torching of hundreds of homes, and lootings. When he came to power in 2003, then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan initially promised to strengthen the rights of minorities. In 2007 he began an \u201cAlevi opening,\u201d and has protected Alevi from massacres. But the Erdogan government also emphasizes the teaching of Sunni doctrine in public schools, has placed few Alevis in government positions such as governor or police chief; and while it spends large sums for the construction of Sunni mosques, refuses to classify cemevis as official places of worship, let alone pay for their construction. In October 2013, tens of thousands of Alevis protested the lack of Alevi rights in a series of reforms introduced by Erdo\u011fan. In 2015 a cemevi was confiscated and repurposed as a mosque, despite the presence of another mosque a few hundred metres away. In 2016 the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) found that Alevis in Turkey \"were subjected to a difference in treatment for which there was no objective and reasonable justification.\" == Demographics == Distribution of Alevi population in Turkey. Red = Anatolian Alevis (Turks, Kurmanjis and Zazas). Dark red = Alawites (Arabs) in Southern Turkey. Most Alevi live in Turkey, where they are a minority and Sunni Muslims the majority. The size of the Alevi population is likewise disputed, but most estimates place them somewhere between 8 and 10 million people or about 12% of the population. Estimates of the percentage of Turkey's population that are Alevi include between 10 and 20%, 33%, and as much as 40%. Scattered minorities live in Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Caucasus, Greece, Iran and the Turkish Diaspora. Most Alevis come from Kizilbash or Bektashi origin, according to Minorityrights.org. The Alevis (Kizilbash) are traditionally predominantly rural and acquire identity by parentage. Bektashis, however, are predominantly urban, and formally claim that membership is open to any Muslim. The groups are separately organized, but subscribe to \"virtually the same system of beliefs\". ===Population estimates=== The Alevi population has been estimated as follows: * 12,521,000 according to Sabahat Akkiraz, an MP from CHP. * \"approx. 15 million...\" \u2014Krisztina Kehl-Bodrogi.From the introduction of Syncretistic Religious Communities in the Near East edited by her, B. Kellner-Heinkele, & A. Otter-Beaujean. Leiden: Brill, 1997. * In Turkey, 15% of Turkey's population (approx. 10.6 million) \u2014David ShanklandStructure and Function in Turkish Society. Isis Press, 2006, p. 81. * \"Most Alevi writers and spokespersons claim that Turkey's population today is one-third Alevi- Bektashi, or more than 20 million. Lower estimates range from 10 to 12 million.\" \u2014John Schindeldecker.From his Turkish Alevis Today. * \"The Alevi constitute the second-largest religious community in Turkey (following the Sunnis), and number some 25% (15 million) of the total population (Alevis claim 30%\u201340%). Most (?) Alevis are ethnic and linguistic Turks, mainly of Turkmen descent from Central and Eastern Anatolia. Some 20% of Alevis are Kurds (though most Kurds are Sunni), and some 25% of Kurds in Turkey are Alevi (Kurmanji and Zaza speakers).\" \u2014David Zeidan.\"The Alevi of Anatolia,\" 1995. * \"8 to 10 million...\" \u2014Olli Rehn, from the 1996 (Camiel) \"Eurlings Report\" to the European Commission (on the suitability of Turkish accession to the EU). * \"...a world total of between 10 and 15 million adherents. There is no independent data for their numbers, so these statistics are estimates or conjectures.\" \u2014\"Alevism,\" from The Encyclopedia of the Orient. * In June 2008, several Turkish newspapers reported that the Turkish military had commissioned three universities to research the ethnic demography of Turkey. The study was done in 2000 and included all ethnic groupings. According to the results, the Alevi population of Turkey, including those who currently reside in Europe, is around 10 million. * Conglomeration of syncretic beliefs: A wide variety of academic sources define Alevism as a syncretic religion, combining diverse religious beliefs,Formation of Alevi Sycretism, Ceren Selmanpakoglu, 2006The making of world society; Anghel, Gerharz et al.; Transaction Publishers; 2008; page 106 which developed from Islam, Buddhist-influenced Turkic shamanism, and some elements of Christianity.Soner Cagaptay, The Rise of Turkey: The Twenty- First Century's First Muslim Power, p. 85. Date=?Struggling for recognition, Sokefeld, Berghahn books, 2008, page 103 According to Turkish university research conducted in 2005 by a researcher named Soner Cagaptay, 44% of respondents who called themselves \"Alevis\" self-identify as Muslim and 56% do not.Soner Cagaptay, The Rise of Turkey: The Twenty-First Century's First Muslim Power, p.90. Date=?, Publisher=? Nevertheless, one should be aware of the fact that the university survey which was conducted at a specific location may not reflect the accurate results all the time, and there exists a high probability that the group who had been surveyed might belong to the non- Muslim Ishikists. Moreover, one should always bear in mind that some members of the non-muslim communities like Kurdish Y\u00e2res\u00e2n (Ahl-i Haqq) and Ishik- Alevis define/identify themselves under the title of Alawism as well. Henceforth, it is always possible either to enlarge or to shrink the borders of the Alevism with respect to which of these definitions are going to be used. * Alevis have been subjected to persecution (often deadly) for centuries. Due to this fact, some have been assimilated. It is not clear how effective the above study is in including those who might be more timid about advertising their Alevi origins. * Some of the Kurdish Alevis speak Kurmanji or Zazaki. Some Alevis are Azeris.David Zeidan: The Alevi of Anatolia, 1995. Despite universalist rhetoric and in contrast with Islam in general, or the Bektashi order, Alevi communities do not generally acknowledge the possibility of conversion to Aleviness. * Alevi communities are concentrated in central Anatolia, in a belt from \u00c7orum in the west to Mu\u015f in the east. The only province within Turkey with an Alevi majority is Tunceli, formerly known as Dersim. Beginning in the 1960s, many Alevis have migrated to the large cities of western and southern Turkey \u2013 and to western Europe, especially Germany \u2013 and are now heavily urbanized. * There is also a native 3000 Alevi community in Western Thrace, Greece. The founder of the Bektashiyyah Sufi order Hac\u0131 Bekta\u015f-\u0131 Veli (\u1e24\u0101jj\u012b Bakt\u0101sh Wal\u012b), a murid of Mal\u0101mat\u012b-Qal\u0101nd\u0101r\u012b Sheikh Qutb ad-D\u012bn Haydar, who introduced the Ahmad Yasavi's doctrine of \"Four Doors and Forty Stending\" into his tariqah. === Social groups === A Turkish scholar working in France has distinguished four main groups among contemporary Alevis, which cautiously show their distinctive features in modern Turkey. Calligraphic hat in Alevi-Bektashism. :The first group, who form majority of the Alevi population regard themselves as true Muslims and are prepared to cooperate with the state. It adheres to the way of Jafar as-Sadiq, the Sixth Imam of Shia Islam. This groups, concept of God is the same as Orthodox Islam, and like their Shia counterparts they reject the first three chosen Caliph's, who Sunni's accept as legitimate and only accept Ali as the actual and true Caliph. :The second group, which has the second most following among Alevis are said to be under the active influence of the official Iranian Shia's and to be confirmed adherents of the Twelver branch of Shia Islam and they reject the teachings of Bektashism Tariqa. They follow the Ja'fari jurisprudence and oppose secular state power.Bilici, F: \"The Function of Alevi-Bektashi Theology in Modern Turkey\", seminar. Swedish Research Institute, 1996 :The third group a minority belief held by the Alevis is mainly represented by people who belong to the political left and presumed the Aleviness just as an outlook on the individual human life rather than a religious conviction by persistently renouncing the ties of the Batiniyya-Alevism with Twelver political branch of Shia Islam. The followers of this congregation, who later turned out to be the very stern defenders of Erdo\u011fan \u00c7\u0131nar, hold ritual unions of a religious character and have established cultural associations named after Pir Sultan Abdal as well. According to their philosophy, human being should enjoy a central role reminiscent of the doctrine of Khurramites, and as illustrated by Hurufi phrase of God is Man quoted above in the context of the Trinity. :The fourth who adopted some aspirations of Christian mysticism, is more directed towards heterodox mysticism and stands closer to the Hajji Bektashi Brotherhood. According to the philosophy developed by this congregation, Christian mystic St Francis of Assisi and Hindu Mahatma Gandhi are supposedly considered better believers of God than many Muslims. == Influences of the Muslim sects on the Alev\u012b faith throughout Anatolia and the Balkans == {| class=\"{}\" style=\"float:{}; margin: 2ex 0 0.6em 0.5em; width: 8em; line- height:111%;\" The schematic history of the development of the Im\u0101m\u012b-Alevism |- Sh\u012b\u2018ah Im\u0101m\u012b Alev\u012b Bekt\u0101sh\u012b \u1e6car\u012bqah | === Bektashi === The Bektashiyyah is a Shia Sufi order founded in the 13th century by Haji Bektash Veli, a dervish who escaped Central Asia and found refuge with the Seljuks in Anatolia at the time of the Mongol invasions (1219\u201323). This order gained a great following in rural areas and it later developed in two branches: the Celebi clan, who claimed to be physical descendants of Haji Bektash Veli, were called Bel evladlar\u0131 (children of the loins), and became the hereditary spiritual leaders of the rural Alevis; and the Baba\u011fan, those faithful to the path (yol evladlar\u0131 \u2013 children of the way) who dominated the official Bektashi Sufi order with its elected leadership. ==== Bektashiyyah doctrine: Bektashism and Hurufism ==== The Bektashi Order is a Sufi order and shares much in common with other Islamic mystical movements, such as the need for an experienced spiritual guide \u2013 called a baba in Bektashi parlance \u2013 as well as the doctrine of \"the four gates that must be traversed\": the \"Sharia\" (religious law), \"Tariqah\" (the spiritual path), \"Marifa\" (true knowledge), \"Haqiqah\" (truth). ===== Wahdat al-Mawjud ===== Four Spiritual Stations in Bektashiyyah: Sharia, tariqa, haqiqa, and the fourth station, marifa, which is considered \"unseen\", is actually the center of the haqiqa region. Marifa is the essence of all four stations. Bektashism places much emphasis on the concept of Wahdat al-Mawjud \u0648\u062d\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f, the \"Unity of Being\" that was formulated by Ibn Arabi. Bektashism is also heavily permeated with Shiite concepts, such as the marked veneration of Ali, the Twelve Imams, and the ritual commemoration of Ashurah marking the Battle of Karbala. The old Persian holiday of Nowruz is celebrated by Bektashis as Imam Ali's birthday. In keeping with the central belief of Wahdat Al-Mawjud the Bektashi see reality contained in Haqq-Muhammad-Ali, a single unified entity. Bektashi do not consider this a form of trinity. There are many other practices and ceremonies that share similarity with other faiths, such as a ritual meal (muhabbet) and yearly confession of sins to a baba (magfirat-i zunub \u0645\u063a\u0641\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0646\u0648\u0628). Bektashis base their practices and rituals on their non-orthodox and mystical interpretation and understanding of the Qur'an and the prophetic practice (Sunnah). They have no written doctrine specific to them, thus rules and rituals may differ depending on under whose influence one has been taught. Bektashis generally revere Sufi mystics outside of their own order, such as Ibn Arabi, Al-Ghazali and Jelalludin Rumi who are close in spirit to them. ===== Batiniyya and Ismailism ===== Cenotaph for the Bektashi dervish G\u00fcl Baba at his t\u00fcrbe in Buda. Bektashis hold that the Qur'an has two levels of meaning: an outer (Z\u0101her \u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631) and an inner (b\u0101\u1e6den \u0628\u0627\u0637\u0646). They hold the latter to be superior and eternal and this is reflected in their understanding of both the universe and humanity, which is a view that can also be found in Ismailism and Batiniyya. Bektashism is also initiatic and members must traverse various levels or ranks as they progress along the spiritual path to the Reality. First level members are called a\u015f\u0131ks \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0642. They are those who, while not having taken initiation into the order, are nevertheless drawn to it. Following initiation (called nasip) one becomes a m\u00fchip \u0645\u062d\u0628. After some time as a m\u00fchip, one can take further vows and become a dervish. The next level above dervish is that of baba. The baba (lit. father) is considered to be the head of a tekke and qualified to give spiritual guidance (irshad \u0625\u0631\u0634\u0627\u062f). Above the baba is the rank of halife-baba (or dede, grandfather). Traditionally there were twelve of these, the most senior being the \"dedebaba\" (great-grandfather). The dedebaba was considered to be the highest ranking authority in the Bektashi Order. Traditionally the residence of the dedebaba was the Pir Evi (The Saint's Home) which was located in the shrine of Hajji Bektash Wali in the central Anatolian town of Hac\u0131bekta\u015f (Solucakarah\u00fcy\u00fck). Shah Ismail I, the Sheikh of the Safavi tariqa, founder of the Safavid Dynasty of Iran, of Kurdish ethnicity, and the Commander-in-chief of the K\u0131z\u0131lba\u015f armies. ==== Qizilbash ==== The Qizilbash (red-heads) were Turkmen tribes who adhered to the Safavid Sufi Order, whose Sheikhs claimed descent from Ali. Under Isma`il (d. 1524) they became dominant in Eastern Anatolia and conquered Azerbaijan with its capital Tabriz, where Isma`il named himself Shah in 1501 and went on to conquer all of Iran. His missionaries spread a message of revolt against the Sunni Ottomans in Anatolia, claiming that Isma`il was the awaited mahdi (messiah), and Anatolia became the scene of protracted warfare between Ottomans and Safavids. ===== Qizilbash doctrine: K\u0131z\u0131lba\u015fl\u0131k ===== Qizilbash and Bektashi tariqah shared common religious beliefs and practices becoming intermingled as Alevis in spite of many local variations. Isolated from both the Sunni Ottomans and the Twelver Shi`a Safavids, Qizilbash and Bektashi developed traditions, practices, and doctrines by the early 17th century which marked them as a closed autonomous religious community. As a result of the immense pressures to conform to Sunni Islam, all members of Alevism developed a tradition of opposition (ib\u0101\u1e25a) to all forms of external religion. The doctrine of Qizilbashism is well explained in the following poem written by the Shaykh of Safaviyya tariqah Ismail I: The lines of poetry above may easily be judged as an act of \"Shirk\" (polytheism) by the Sunni Ulama, but they have a b\u0101\u1e6den\u012b ta\u02bew\u012bl (inner explanation) in Qizilbashism. == Alevi music == A\u015f\u0131k Veysel \u015eat\u0131ro\u011flu. Alevi religious services, referred to collectively as cem or \u00e2y\u00een, include spiritual exercises that incorporate elements of zikr (\"remembrance\" or recitation of God's names, in this case without controlled breathing, but with some elements of body posturing) and sema (ritual dance). The latter is accompanied by sung mystical poetry in the vernacular, and by the sacred ritual instrument known as ba\u011flama or saz (a plucked folk lute with frets). Such music is performed by specialists known as z\u00e2kir, a\u015f\u0131k, sazende or g\u00fcvende, depending on regional usage. They are recruited from Alevi communities and descended from dede lineages. Many are also known to be poet/minstrels (a\u015f\u0131k, ozan) who perpetuate the tradition of dervish-lodge (tekke) poets such as Yunus Emre (13th century), Nes\u00eem\u00ee (14th century), Pir Sultan Abdal, Hat\u00e2'\u00ee and Gen\u00e7 Abdal (16th century) and Kul Himmet and Kul H\u00fcseyn (17th century). The poetry was composed in the Turkish vernacular and follows the principles of folk prosody known as hece vezne in which the focus is the number of syllables. The tomb of Ruhi Su at Zincirlikuyu Mezarl\u0131\u011f\u0131 in Istanbul. The specialized sacred musical repertoire of Alevi musicians includes :*Deyi\u015f (songs of mystical love) :*Nefes (hymns concerning the mystical experience) :*D\u00fcvaz or d\u0131wes im\u00e2m (hymns in honor of the 12 Alid imams) :*Mersiye (laments concerning the martyrdom of Imam Huseyn at Karbala) :*Mira\u00e7lama (songs about the ascent of the Muhammad to heaven) :*Sam\u0101h (ritual dance accompanied by folk lutes and sung poetry) The dances are performed by couples, and choreographies employ circle and line formations as well as arrangements where couples face one another, thus synchronizing their movements more closely. As the tempo of the music increases, the figures become more complex and intense. There are many regional variants of sema, but the most widespread and important are the Dance of the Forty (K\u0131rklar Semah\u0131) and the Dance of the Cranes (Turnalar Semah\u0131). The \u00e2y\u00een-\u00ee-cem can be heard on the JVC CD Turkey \u2013 An Esoteric Sufi Ceremony. The recording was made in Istanbul in 1993, and the ceremony includes in an order typical of a cem: a deyi\u015f that reiterates the line of descent of the sect in a historical framework, two divas (one based on the poetry of Hat\u00e2'\u00ee, and the other on the poetry of Kul Himmet), prayer formulas, the ill-\u00c2ll\u00e2h genre that incorporates the tahl\u00eel formula into the poem to create an atmosphere of zikr while sect members create rhythmic intensity by hitting their knees in time to the music and sway their bodies slightly, the Dance of the Forty (K\u0131rklar Semah), the Dance of the Cranes (Turnalar Semah\u0131) and prayer formulas. Alevis have a significant role in Turkish music and poetry. Pir Sultan Abdal, a 16th-century Alevi poet whose poems and songs often contain spiritual themes, is revered as a saint and hero. Important figures are the Sufi poet Yunus Emre, widely regarded as having been Alevi, and Kaygusuz Abdal. Their poems shape Turkish culture up to now, and are also performed by modern artists. Songs attributed to these poets have been embraced by left-wingers in the 20th century. The a\u015f\u0131k bards are also influenced by Alevi tradition. Many of the major traditional musicians in Turkey are Alevi, including Arif Sa\u011f, Musa Ero\u011flu, Ne\u015fet Erta\u015f, Erdal Erzincan, A\u015f\u0131k Mahzuni \u015eerif, A\u015f\u0131k Feyzullah \u00c7\u0131nar, A\u015f\u0131k Veysel \u015eat\u0131ro\u011flu, Ali Ekber \u00c7i\u00e7ek, Sabahat Akkiraz, Belk\u0131s Akkale, and Ula\u015f \u00d6zdemir. Other non-Alevis, such as Ruhi Su, have recorded many Alevi songs. Mercan Dede, an artist whose music combines electronic and traditional Sufi elements, has made some songs involving Alevi themes in cooperation with singer Sabahat Akkiraz. {| class=\"{}\" style=\"float:{}; margin: 2ex 0 0.6em 0.5em; width: 8em; line-height:111%;\" !The schematic history of the development of the Im\u0101m\u012b-Alevism from other Sh\u012b\u2018ah Muslim sects |- | Alevism and Shiat-ul-Ali ==See also== * Ashura * Duzgin Bawo * Religious humanism * Shi'a view of Ali == References == == Further reading == ;General introductions * Engin, Ismail & Franz, Erhard (2000).
