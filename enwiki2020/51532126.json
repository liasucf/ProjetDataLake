It was the birthplace of his son Leif Eir\u00edksson, the first known European discoverer of the Americas. A site thought to be that of the original farm has been investigated by archaeologists and remains of two buildings dating to the 9th\u201310th centuries have been identified. An open-air museum has been established nearby. ==Historical record== According to Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k and the Saga of Erik the Red, after first settling in Vestfir\u00f0ir, Eir\u00edkr married \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0hildur J\u01ebrundard\u00f3ttir and established the farm of Eir\u00edkssta\u00f0ir near the Vatnshorn in Haukadalur. His son Leifr was born there, but Eir\u00edkr had to leave the area after killing two men in revenge for the deaths of two of his thralls.Saga of Erik the Red, Chapter 2; Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k, Chapter 35. ==Archaeological investigations== A number of archaeological investigations have been carried out at what is thought to be the site of Eir\u00edkssta\u00f0ir (now on the land of St\u00f3ra-Vatnshorn farm). In 1894 made a plan of the visible signs of old buildings and they were excavated the following year by \u00deorsteinn Erlingsson. made a further investigation in 1896. An excavation in 1938 by uncovered a building of the longhouse type with a long central firepit.Adolf Fri\u00f0riksson, Sagas and Popular Antiquarianism in Icelandic Archaeology, Worldwide archaeology series 10, Avebury / Brookfield, Vermont: Aldershot, 1994, , pp. 148\u201352. In 1997\u20132002, at the request of the Eir\u00edkssta\u00f0anefnd (Eir\u00edssta\u00f0ir committee), Gu\u00f0mundur \u00d3lafsson conducted a further investigation for the National Museum of Iceland.Gu\u00f0mundur \u00d3lafsson, \"Eir\u00edkssta\u00f0ir \u00ed Haukadal. Fornleifaranns\u00f3kn \u00e1 sk\u00e1lar\u00fast\", \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0minjasafn \u00cdslands. Ranns\u00f3knask\u00fdrslur Fornleifadeild, 1998:11 (1999) , . ===Main building=== The main building was of a longhouse type, and was measured in the 1997 dig at approximately in area and long. There was a central fire-pit; this and rows of stones indicate that people sat along the walls. In the initial investigation in 1895, \u00deorsteinn Erlingsson thought there had been an attached bake-house at the rear, but the 1997 dig confirmed Matt\u00edas \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson's belief that the rocks there were from a natural landslide. The walls were turf set on a base of rocks, and were about thick; stones in the south wall indicate that it had been repaired. The building was simple in construction and indications are that it had not been occupied for long. C-14 dating of charcoal from an undisturbed area of human habitation deposits in front of the ruins yielded a date of the 9th\u201310th century. ===Pit-house=== In 2000 a pit-house was excavated next to the main building. Among other finds in the floor were carved stone spindles of Norwegian manufacture. Gu\u00f0mundur \u00d3lafsson interprets this as having been a dyngja, a \"bower\" or women's work-room.[Kristjana \u00c1g\u00fastsd\u00f3ttir], \"Fornleifaranns\u00f3knum a\u00f0 lj\u00faka \u00e1 jar\u00f0h\u00fasinu \u00e1 Eir\u00edksst\u00f6\u00f0um \u00ed Haukadal: Norskur sn\u00e6ldusn\u00fa\u00f0ur finnst \u00ed dyngjunni\", Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0, 13 July 2004, . It had previously been viewed as a bath-house or sauna (by \u00deorsteinn Erlingsson) and a kitchen or smokery (by Matth\u00edas \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson).Gu\u00f0mundur \u00d3lafsson and Ragnhei\u00f0ur Traustad\u00f3ttir, \"Ranns\u00f3kn \u00e1 Eir\u00edksst\u00f6\u00f0um \u00ed Haukadal: 21. j\u00fal\u00ed - 1. \u00e1g\u00fast\" , \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0minjasafn \u00cdslands.

It aims to reproduce Erik the Red's home as accurately as possible; the longhouse was built in imitation of the excavated building, using driftwood and replica tools.\"The replica farmhouse\", Eiriksstadir.is, retrieved 6 September 2016. The museum was created in 1999 and formally opened in 2000 in association with the celebration of the thousand-year anniversary of the discovery of Vinland.\"Eir\u00edkssta\u00f0ir\", Upplif\u00f0u Vesturland, retrieved 6 September 2016 ; \"Eirik the Red\u00b4s homestead\", Visit West Iceland, retrieved 6 September 2016.
