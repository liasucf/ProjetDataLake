    "text": "White Hill is a Canadian peak in the Cape Breton Highlands and is the highest elevation point in the province of Nova Scotia. Located on the plateau northwest of Ingonish and northeast of Cheticamp, the peak is situated in the Cape Breton Highlands National Park and is accessible only by hiking. It is an extremely remote, large flat hill, covered by small spruce trees rising from a marshy, barren, windswept upland about from the nearest road and from any maintained hiking trails. == Survey monument == There is a first order Natural Resources Canada Geodetic Survey Division Station (Unique Number: 23105) on the summit, consisting of a marker, a brass/bronze disk, set in the top of a concrete pier on a small bedrock outcrop. There was a metal tower marking the site, but it is now lying on the ground (as of 2008). The station was surveyed and placed in June 1923 and the marker was renewed in 1963. The station was inspected by helicopter in 1976 and 1987. ==See also== * List of highest points of Canadian provinces and territories ==References== ==External links== * Atlas of Canada \u2013 Facts about mountains * Peakbagger 1994 Summary of White Hill and surroundings (with photo) * 2007 Summary of hike to White Hill and surroundings (with many photos) * 2008 Summary of hike to White Hill and surroundings (with many photos) Category:Mountains of Nova Scotia Category:Landforms of Victoria County, Nova Scotia ",
