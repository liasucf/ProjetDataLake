The courthouse was constructed from 1897 to 1900, and was designed by the architectural firm of Yost & Packard of Columbus, Ohio. Its dome is topped by a figure carrying the scales of justice. The courthouse, located at the intersection of Adams and Jefferson Streets in downtown Fairmont, and the adjacent American Foursquare-style sheriff's residence, were jointly added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 for their architectural, artistic and governmental significance. ==See also== *List of Registered Historic Places in West Virginia ==References== Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in West Virginia Category:Buildings and structures in Marion County, West Virginia Category:Clock towers in the United States Category:County courthouses in West Virginia Category:Courthouses on the National Register of Historic Places in West Virginia Category:Government buildings completed in 1900 Category:Yost and Packard buildings Category:National Register of Historic Places in Marion County, West Virginia Category:American Foursquare architecture in West Virginia ",
