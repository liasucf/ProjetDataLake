    "text": "Bulgarian Americans are Americans of Bulgarian descent.Yu, Eleanor. \"Bulgarian Americans.\" Gale Encyclopedia of Multicultural America (3rd ed., vol. 1, Gale, 2014), pp. 357-371. For the 2000 United States Census, 55,489 Americans indicated Bulgarian as their first ancestry, while 92,841 persons declared to have Bulgarian ancestry. Those can include Bulgarian Americans living in the United States for one or several generations, dual Bulgarian American citizens, or any other Bulgarian Americans who consider themselves to be affiliated to both cultures or countries. Bulgarian Americans include persons born in Bulgaria, in the United States, and in other countries with ethnic Bulgarian population. Because some Bulgarians are not American citizens, others are dual citizens, and still others' ancestors came to the U.S. several generations ago, some of these people consider themselves to be simply Americans, Bulgarians, Bulgarians living in the United States or American Bulgarians. After the 2000 U.S. census, in the recent years the population grew significantly \u2014 according to the general assessments of Bulgarian diplomatic representations in the US for 2010, there are 250,000 Bulgarians residing in the country, and more than 30,000 students. ==History== Mass Bulgarian immigration to the United States began in the mid 19th century.G. Traichev, History of the Bulgarian Emigration to North America. From Its Beginning in mid 19th century to the 1980s, Sofia 1993 According to Mihaela Robila they tended to settle in Slavic enclaves in the Midwest or Northeast Eastern European Immigrant Families, 2013 David Cassens has published a study of 'The Bulgarian Colony of Southwestern Illinois 1900-1920' Illinois Historical Journal Vol. 84, No. 1 (Spring, 1991), pp. 15-24 There is a book written by the famous and eminent Bulgarian writer Aleko Konstantinov, called To Chicago and Back (Bulgarian:\"\u0414\u043e \u0427\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0433\u043e \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434\") which was first published in 1894 although this concerns attendance at a trade fair not emigration per se. According to the 2000 census, the highest number of Bulgarians lived in the cities of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami. The United States has one of the highest numbers of Bulgarians of any country in the world. As many as 250,0001 Bulgarians live in the country. From the Eastern European countries, Bulgaria has the second highest number of students who study in the United States, after Russia. ==Demographics== The 2000 United States Census shows that there were 63,000 people of Bulgarian descent in the US. According to the same source, the state with the largest number of Bulgarians is California, followed by Illinois, New York, Florida, Ohio, and Indiana. Texas, more specifically Houston, also has a growing population. According to the 2000 US census the cities with the highest number of Bulgarian Americans are New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Miami. Approximately 60% of Bulgarian Americans over the age of 25 hold a bachelor's degree or higher. Bulgarian Americans have an annual median household income of $76,862. Following the 2000 US census when Bulgarians were 50-100,000, during the last 10 years their number has grown significantly to over 250,000. ===Bulgarian-born population=== Bulgarian-born population in the US since 2010: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"|Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:160px;\"|Number |- align=center | 2010 | 62,684 |- align=center | 2011 | 65,202 |- align=center | 2012 | 64,964 |- align=center | 2013 | 67,941 |- align=center | 2014 | 63,318 |- align=center | 2015 | 67,377 |- align=center | 2016 | 70,800 |- |} ==Language== A Bulgarian church (Saint Climent of Ohrid) in Los Angeles, California According to the 2000 US Census, 28,565 people indicated that they speak Bulgarian at home in 2000. But in the recent years the number grew significantly to over 250,000 people. Some Bulgarian Americans speak Bulgarian, especially the more recent immigrants, while others might not speak the language at all, or speak Bulgarian mixed with English to a lesser or greater extent. Some Bulgarian Americans understand Bulgarian even though they might not be able to speak the language. There are cases where older generations of Bulgarians or descendants of Bulgarian immigrants from the early part of the 20th century are fluent in the Bulgarian language as well. ==Notable people== * John Vincent Atanasoff (1903\u20131995) \u2013 inventor of the first automatic electronic digital computer * Alexander Arabadzhiev - 3rd place winner of the NFTE New England Youth Entrepreneurship Challenge * Miroslav Barnyashev \u2013 professional wrestler for WWE who goes by the ring name \"Rusev\" * Christo \u2013 world-famous artist known for projects such as The Gates and The Wrapped Reichstag * Carolyn Christov- Bakargiev \u2013 writer, art historian, and curator * Laura Chukanov \u2013 Miss USA 2009 competitor * Bill Danoff \u2013 songwriter and singer * Carl Djerassi (1923\u20132015) \u2013 chemist, developed the first oral contraceptive pill, and nominated as one of the greatest medical discoveries in the last 166 years * Stephane Groueff (1922\u20132006) \u2013 writer and journalist who wrote the book Manhattan Project: The Untold Story of the Making of the Atomic Bomb * Assen Jordanoff (1896\u20131967) \u2013 aviation constructor with a global recognitionAssen Jordanoff - the man who contributed to America's airpower at www.pantonov.com * Dan Kolov (1892\u20131940) \u2013 early 20th century wrestler * Ted Kotcheff \u2013 film and television director and producer (First Blood, Weekend at Bernie's) * Leah LaBelle (1986\u20132018) \u2013 singer and finalist on American Idol * Milcho Leviev \u2013 jazz pianist and composer * Alex Maleev \u2013 comic book illustrator and artist best known for the Marvel Comics' series Daredevil (vol. 2), collaborating with writer Brian Michael Bendis * Angela Nikodinov \u2013 figure skater * Victor Ninov \u2013 nuclear physicist * Peter Petroff (1919\u20132003) \u2013 inventor, engineer, NASA scientist, and adventurer * Maria Popova \u2013 writer, critic, and blogger; named among the \"100 Most Creative People in Business\" by Fast Company in 2012 * Svetla Protich \u2013 classical pianist * Andre Roussimoff (1946\u20131993) \u2013 professional wrestler known as Andr\u00e9 the Giant * Dimitar Sasselov \u2013 astronomer and professor at Harvard University * Kyril Vassilev (1908\u20131987) \u2013 portrait painter of royalty and American society during the mid-20th century * Sam Voinoff (1907\u20131989) \u2013 college golf coach at Purdue University, with 10 Big Ten, and 1 NCAA championships. ==See also== * Bulgarian Eastern Orthodox Diocese of the USA, Canada and Australia * Macedonian Patriotic Organization * St. John of Rila Church (Chicago) ==Notes== Estimates of the Agency for Bulgarians Abroad for the numbers of ethnic Bulgarians living for the country in question based on data from the Bulgarian Border Police, the Bulgarian Ministry of Labour and reports from immigrant associations.
