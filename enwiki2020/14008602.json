    "text": "The Beauce Jaros were a minor professional ice hockey team from Saint-Georges, Quebec, located in the \"Beauce\" region of the province. The Jaros played one full season in the North American Hockey League during the 1975\u201376 NAHL season, and were the NAHL's regular season champions, but lost to the Philadelphia Firebirds in the Lockhart Cup finals. Jocelyn 'Joe' Hardy was the team's player-coach, and also league most valuable player and top scorer in 1975\u201376, scoring 208 points. This made him the first professional player to score 200 points or more in a single season. The Jaros played another 30 games into the 1976\u201377 NAHL season before ceasing operations from December 22, 1976. The Jaros' uniforms and logo were the basis for those worn by the fictional \"Syracuse Bulldogs\" in the 1977 film Slap Shot. ==External links== * Statistics at hockeydb.com Category:1975 establishments in Quebec Category:1976 disestablishments in Quebec Category:Defunct ice hockey teams in Canada Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1975 Category:Ice hockey clubs disestablished in 1976 Category:Ice hockey teams in Quebec Category:North American Hockey League (1973\u20131977) teams Category:Saint-Georges, Quebec ",
