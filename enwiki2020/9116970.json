The Cairns-based indigenous youth advocate used her profile to draw attention to domestic violence in the Aboriginal community. Her forthright way of addressing the problems focused national attention on the issue. She spoke \"I rule!\" to opinion makers, the public and government about sexual violence and rape in the Aboriginal community, asking Prime Minister John Howard to help lift the \"blanket of shame\" that was preventing such assaults being reported. \"I'm proud to be an Aboriginal Australian and to have been recognised and acknowledged for the work I'm involved in,\" Major said. In 2007, Major was named as the Young Australian of the Year, having been earlier named as the Queensland Young Australian of the Year. She is currently the Youth Development Project Officer for the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership, and a Regional Councillor for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC). ==References== ==External links== * Transcript, \"Cry from the Heart, 60 Minutes, 30 July 2006. * Four Corners Interview with Tania Major * Youtube video 2007 Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:People from Cairns Category:People educated at Clayfield College Category:Griffith University alumni Category:Australian indigenous rights activists ",
