    "text": "The 2006 Plymouth City Council election was held on 4 May 2006 to elect members of Plymouth City Council in England. One third of the council was up for election on the day, with an additional seat in Southway Ward remaining vacant until a by-election on 22 June. After the election, Labour were reduced to 28 out of the 56 filled seats, thus temporarily losing control of the council to No Overall Control. However, Labour won the Southway by-election on 22 June, thus restoring their overall control of the council. ==Overall results== |- | colspan=2 style=\"text-align: right; margin-right: 1em\" | Total | style=\"text-align: right;\" | 19 | colspan=5 | | style=\"text-align: right;\" | 60,804 | style=\"text-align: right;\" | ==Ward results== ===Budshead=== Location of Budshead ward ===Compton=== Location of Compton ward ===Devonport=== Location of Devonport ward ===Drake=== Location of Drake ward ===Efford and Lipson=== Location of Efford and Lipson ward ===Eggbuckland=== Location of Eggbuckland ward ===Ham=== Location of Ham ward ===Honicknowle=== Location of Honicknowle ward ===Moor View=== Location of Moor View ward ===Peverell=== Location of Peverell ward ===Plympton Chaddlewood=== Location of Plympton Chaddlewood ward ===Plympton St Mary=== Location of Plympton St Mary ward ===Plymstock Dunstone=== Location of Plymstock Dunstone ward ===Plymstock Radford=== Location of Plymstock Radford ward ===St Budeax=== Location of St Budeaux ward ===St Peter and the Waterfront=== Location of St Peter and the Waterfront ward ===Southway=== Location of Southway ward ===Stoke=== Location of Stoke ward ===Sutton and Mount Gould=== Location of Sutton and Mount Gould ward ==See also== * List of wards in Plymouth ==References== Category:2006 English local elections Category:May 2006 events in the United Kingdom 2006 Category:2000s in Devon ",
