    "text": "Adaline Dutton Kent or Adaline Kent Howard, (August 7, 1900 \u2013 March 24, 1957) was an American sculptor from California. She created abstract sculptures with forms inspired by the natural landscape. == Early life and education == Kent was born on August 7, 1900 in Kentfield, California, one of seven children of women's rights activist Elizabeth Thacher Kent and U.S. congressman William Kent. Her grandfather, Albert Emmett Kent, had purchased an 800-acre farm in 1871, which later became the town of Kentfield. She began her education at Vassar College before returning to the Bay Area to study at the California School of Fine Arts. She studied in Paris with Antoine Bourdelle at the Grande Chaumiere. She married Robert Boardman Howard on August 5, 1930, after they worked together on the Pacific Stock Exchange building, a Miller and Pflueger architecture firm project. They had two daughters, Ellen (May 1931 \u2013 Oct 1987) and Galen (born April 1933). == Work == The first fifteen years of her career her art focused on the human body. She loved the fact that sculpting the human body offered anyone to have their own personal interpretation to the craft. According to Kent, there is no awkwardness to the human body and its representation is not subjective to anyone other than the creator. Kent also felt comfortable with taking ideas from the human form because our bodies are familiar and easy to shape into various artistic position. This foundation in the form of the human body led her to discover her true passion of creating works of art that dealt with the flow of nature. Kent loved to hike and explore various trails in the Sierra Mountains. Kent found a lot of influence from the rock formations in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. In her travels Kent was able to find the meditation that influenced her use the ideas of others in her art. She ventured outside of the human form and into more three- dimensional curved form that left her art to interpretation. Kent also found influence in mountain formations, she explored the way gravity works with a few sketches. Her most notable sketch \u201cSong\u201d was made in 1945 and centered on the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the music of nature. Kent also made sculptures from various material such as seashells, driftwood, and crystals. Adaline Kent felt that \u201cworks of nature are one with works of art\u201d. Kent also took influence from primitive resources that originated in other cultures. She admired certain artworks from witchcraft and spiritual customs. According to Kent they represented a great deal of mystery and left interpretation up to the imagination. She was able to identify how shapes can carry certain meanings. The sharper edges an object might have, the more emotion it might trigger. The more a sculpture had rounder, smoother edges the more relaxed an individual might feel. Her sculptures remain an important part of surrealist and modern art because of her eye of interpreting the world and its forms. To Kent sculpting was an adventure into the unknown with meaning being attached to personal vision. === Golden Gate International Exposition === During the Golden Gate International Exposition (1939\u20131940), Kent produced a group of 20 statues called Pacific Unity, that were grouped around the Fountain of Western Waters surrounded the statue of Pacifica (Court of Pacifica) by Ralph Stackpole. Each cast stone statue was created to represent the four different population groups in the Pacific; North American, South American, Asian and Pacific Islander. In 1941 the US Navy took over control of Treasure Island (location of the former Golden Gate International Exposition) and removed all but six of the statues. In 1994, six of the remaining statues were restored and put on display on Treasure Island at Building One. == Death and legacy == On March 24, 1957, Kent died in an accident while driving on the Pacific Coast Highway in Marin County.
