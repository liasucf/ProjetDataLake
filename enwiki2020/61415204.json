It was the residence of the Swiss psychiatrist, psychologist, and essayist Carl Jung as well as his wife, psychologist Emma Jung-Rauschenbach. It is located at Seestrasse 228, K\u00fcsnacht, Switzerland, next to Lake Z\u00fcrich. Built in 1908, the house was restored a century later thanks to the Foundation C. G. Jung K\u00fcsnacht. In 2017 it was transformed into a museum, and opened to the public in May 2018. == History == Facade overlooking the lake The project began in 1906, with a letter from Jung to his cousin Ernst Robert Fiechter (1875\u20131948), architect and professor of architecture history at the Technical University of Munich: \"We have in mind to build a house someday, in the country near Z\u00fcrich, on the lake\". At that time, Jung was an assistant medical director at the Burgh\u00f6lzli psychiatric clinic in Z\u00fcrich, with limited financial resources. Jung could only afford to build a stately home after his wife inherited her father's wealth. In 1907, Jung found the property that suited his preferences next to Lake Z\u00fcrich in K\u00fcsnacht.Andreas Jung: Das grosse Haus am See. In: K\u00fcsnachter Jahrheft. Band 54, 2014, S. 59\u201369, hier S. 61 In 1908, he bought the land, and commissioned the construction of a large three-story house to his cousin Ernst Robert Fiechter and to garden architects Walter and Oskar Mertens.s.n.: Landhaus Dr. C. G. Jung in K\u00fcsnacht: erbaut durch Architekt Dr.-Ing. E. Fiechter in M\u00fcnchen. In: Schweizerische Bauzeitung. Band 56/57, Nr. 25, 1911, S. 343\u2013344 Jung played a decisive role in the planning and design of the house and garden. In 1909, Jung resigned from his position in Burgh\u00f6lzli and moved to his new house in K\u00fcsnacht; he lived there with his family for the rest of his life. His income now came from his private practice. The early years in the house, from 1909 to 1910, were the most intense time of his relationship with Sabina Spielrein. In 1960, Jung was appointed an honorary citizen of K\u00fcsnacht on the day of his 85th anniversary. He died at his home on June 6, 1961, after a brief illness.Op. cit., p. 37. == House museum == Lake view The Foundation C. G. Jung K\u00fcsnacht restored the home in 2017 and transformed it into a house museum. The restoration of the gardens and interior spaces is largely faithful to the original design. The museum, which opened its doors in April 2018, defines itself as a scholar's house and museum house; it can be visited with guided tours. The central motto for visitors is: \"Guest at C. G. and Emma Jung-Rauschenbach's house\". The lounge, dining room and veranda, host a permanent exhibition dedicated to Jung's family life and activities in his spare time. The study/consultation room, the waiting room and the library offer a vision of Jung's work style and research interests. Another room is reserved for temporary exhibitions, hosting extended samples that illustrate the general themes of the museum. == See also == * Bollingen Tower * Psychology Club Z\u00fcrich * C. G.
