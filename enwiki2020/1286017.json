The project started in 2009Attitude estimation for a low cost UAV and is being further developed and used at Autonomous Systems Lab of University of California Santa Cruz Several vendors are currently producing Slugs autopilots and accessories.Slugs TeamFlight test results for an improved line of sight guidance law for UAVs ==Overview== An autopilot allows a remotely piloted aircraft to be flown out of sight. All hardware and software is open-source and freely available to anyone under the MIT licensing agreement. free software autopilots provide more flexible hardware and software. Users can modify the autopilot based on their own special requirements, such as forest fire evaluation. The free software approach from Slugs is similar to that from the paparazzi Project, PX4 autopilot, ArduCopter and OpenPilot where low cost and availability enables its hobbyist use in small remotely piloted aircraft such as micro air vehicles and miniature UAVs. Such frameworks are common in Open-source robotics. ===Software=== The open-source software suite contains everything to let airborne systems fly. ==See also== *Crowdsourcing *Micro air vehicle ==References== ==External links== *Slugs Homepage Category:Avionics Category:Aircraft instruments Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles Category:Embedded systems Category:Free software ",
