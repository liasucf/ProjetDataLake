    "text": "Stanford/ITS character set is an extended ASCII character set based on SEASCII with modifications allowing compatibility with 1968 ASCII. == Usage == It is used as an alternate character set of the SUPDUP protocol for terminals with `%TOSAI` and `%TOFCI` bits set. It is also recommended for TeX implementations on systems with large character sets. The default plain TeX macro package sets values (`\u2191`) and (`\u2193`) as alternative character codes for superscripts and subscripts, respectively (the default being `^` and `_`). The Knight keyboard is an example of a keyboard capable of inputting all of the defined characters excluding `\u22c5\u03b3\u03b4\u00b1\u2295\u25ca\u222b`, as they are mapped to ASCII commands `NUL`, `HT`, `LF`, `FF`, `CR`, `ESC` and `DEL`, respectively. == Coverage == Each character is encoded as a single seven-bit code value. It contains all 95 printable ASCII characters along with 27 mathematical symbols and 6 Greek letters. == Code page layout == {| |- ! || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || |- ! || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || |- ! || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || |- ! || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || |- ! || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || |- ! || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || |- ! || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || |- ! || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || |} == See also == * Stanford Extended ASCII * Incompatible Timesharing System * SUPDUP * TeX == References == == Further reading == * - (Historic) SUPDUP Protocol.
