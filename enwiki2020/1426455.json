Cross section of the Jarmann M1884 ==Biography== Jarmann was born in the parish of Nord-Fron in Oppland, Norway. He was raised at the farm \u00d8ien in the traditional district of Gudbrandsdalen. He developed an interest in firearms at an early age, and he designed his first rifle\u2014a breech loading rifle firing cardboard cartridges\u2014in 1838, but this was turned down by the armed forces at the time. The logic was that a rifle capable of firing 13 shots a minute would be impossible to supply with enough ammunition. In the 1870s he stepped down from the daily running of his workshop to develop his newly invented bolt action rifle. This rifle, the Jarmann, was adopted by the Norwegian Army in 1884. The weapon was produced at the Kongsberg Weapon Factory (Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk). Jarmann was appointed a Knight of the Order of St. Olav and made a member of the Order of Vasa. He died in 1894, the same year his rifle was phased out of the service and replaced with the Krag-J\u00f8rgensen. After the Jarmann rifle was phased out of military use, some of the weapons were converted for use as the Jarmann harpoon rifle. ==References== ==Other sources== *Hanevik, Karl Egil (1998) Norske milit\u00e6rgev\u00e6rer etter 1867 (Hanevik v\u00e5pen) *Hanevik, Karl Egil Kongsberg-Colten (Hanevik v\u00e5pen) ==Related reading== *Flatnes, Oyvind (2014) From Musket to Metallic Cartridge (Crowood Press) ==External links== *The Jarmann rifle - Part 1 - Background history *The Jarmann rifle - Part 2 - Shooting Category:1816 births Category:1894 deaths Category:People from Nord- Fron Category:Firearm designers Category:Norwegian designers Category:Norwegian inventors Category:Recipients of the Order of Vasa Category:Recipients of the St. Olav's Medal ",
