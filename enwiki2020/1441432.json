    "text": "Fluorinert is the trademarked brand name for the line of electronics coolant liquids sold commercially by 3M. It is an electrically insulating, stable fluorocarbon-based fluid, which is used in various cooling applications. It is mainly used for cooling electronics. Different molecular formulations are available with a variety of boiling points, allowing it to be used in \"single- phase\" applications, where it remains a liquid, or for \"two-phase\" applications, where the liquid boils to remove additional heat by evaporative cooling. An example of one of the compounds 3M uses is FC-72 (perfluorohexane, C6F14). Perfluorohexane is used for low-temperature heat-transfer applications due to its boiling point. Another example is FC-75, perfluoro(2-butyl- tetrahydrofurane). There are 3M fluids that can handle up to , such as FC-70 (perfluorotripentylamine). 090519 products3.3m.com Fluorinert is used in situations where air cannot carry away enough heat, or where airflow is so restricted that some sort of forced pumping is required. ==Toxicity== Fluorinert may be harmful if inhaled, and care should be taken to avoid contact with eyes and skin. However, according to the documentation from the manufacturer, no health effects are expected from ingestion of Fluorinert. 090519 multimedia.3m.com Usage of fluorinated oils should be limited to closed systems and reduced volumes, since they have a very high global-warming potential and a long atmospheric lifetime. Although Fluorinert was intended to be inert, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory discovered that the liquid cooling system of their Cray-2 supercomputers decomposed during extended service, producing some highly toxic perfluoroisobutene.Kwan, J. Kelly, R, Miller G. Presentation at the American Industrial Hygiene Conference, Salt Lake City, UT, May 1991 Catalytic scrubbers were installed to remove this contaminant. The science-fiction film The Abyss (1989) depicted an experimental liquid-breathing system, in which the use of highly oxygenated Fluorinert enabled a diver to descend to great depths. While several rats were shown actually breathing Fluorinert, scenes depicting actor Ed Harris using the fluid-breathing apparatus were simulated.ALJEAN HARMETZ; FILM; 'The Abyss': A Foray Into Deep Waters - The New York Times ==Global warming potential== Fluorinert perfluorotributylamine absorbs infra-red (IR) wavelengths readily and has a long atmospheric lifetime. As such, it has a very high global warming potential (\"GWP\") of 9,000, and it should be used in closed systems only and carefully managed to minimize emissions. ==See also== *Full immersion cooling ==References== ==External links== *3M Fluorinert Electronic Liquids \u2013 contains links to Material Safety Data Sheets and Product Information Sheets Category:Coolants Category:Organofluorides Category:3M brands ",
