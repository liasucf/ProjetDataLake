An-Nasir succeeded Buluggin ibn Muhammad (1055\u20131062) after his murder in 1062. After the decline of the Zirids in Ifriqiya as a result of the invasion of the Banu Hilal (since 1051), An-Nasir was able to extend the influence of the Hammadids in the Maghreb. Vassals were installed in Tunis and territory as far as Kairouan came under control. Influence was also built up in the northern Sahara by driving out the Ibadi from Sadrata (1077). With the establishment of Bejaia as a second capital, maritime trade gained importance for the economy. Italian architects and craftsmen were enlisted in the construction of Bejaia. The extensive control of the trade routes led to economic growth and a flourishing of the kingdom. However, the stability of the realm was precarious, since the Bedouin Banu Hilal began to infiltrate the Hammadid state after their conquest of Ifriqiya. At first, they were used as mercenaries against the Almoravids - even when the Almoravids conquered territory as far as Algiers in 1081, they could be turned back with Bedouin help. But the Banu Hilal could not be kept under Hammadid control, and ultimately caused the downfall of the kingdom. An-Nasir was succeeded by his son Al-Mansur ibn an-Nasir.
