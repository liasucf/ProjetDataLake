It is currently the second tier of British ice hockey, below the Elite Ice Hockey League. Formerly called the English National Ice Hockey League (ENIHL), it was renamed in 2012 to recognise the inclusion of several teams from Scotland and Wales.http://www.facebook.com/SlapshotScotland The English Ice Hockey Association announced a new structure of the men's senior league for the 2019/20 season, at a meeting of NIHL clubs in Warwickshire. A new ten-team division was approved to sit above the existing Division 1 in North and South, to be known as the National League. In the inaugural 2019\u20132020 season the National League will comprise Basingstoke Bison, Bracknell Bees, Hull Pirates, Leeds Chiefs, MK Lightning, Peterborough Phantoms, London Raiders, Sheffield Steeldogs, Swindon Wildcats and Telford Tigers. There is no promotion to or relegation from the National League. Below the National League, the leagues are split into two regions, North and South, meaning teams do not have to travel long distances for away games. Each region has 2 divisions, with promotion and relegation between the divisions in each region. ==History== The ENIHL was formed in 1996; following the dissolution of the British Hockey League (BHL), and the creation of the Ice Hockey Superleague and the British National League (BNL) as the top two tiers of British hockey. The ENIHL served as the third tier of hockey; operating below the BNL. === Tiers of British ice hockey since 1995 === {| class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"width: 10%;\"|1995-1996 | style=\"width: 10%;\"|1996-97 | style=\"width: 10%;\"|1997-98 | style=\"width: 10%;\"|1998-99 | style=\"width: 10%;\"|1999-00 | style=\"width: 10%;\"|2002-03 | style=\"width: 10%;\"|2005-06 | style=\"width: 10%;\"|2012-13 | style=\"width: 10%;\"|2017-18 | style=\"width: 10%;\"|2019-20 |- | style=\"background: DarkSeaGreen;\" |BHL Premier Division | style=\"background: GoldenRod;\" |Ice Hockey Superleague | style=\"background: GoldenRod;\" |Ice Hockey Superleague | style=\"background: GoldenRod;\" |Ice Hockey Superleague | style=\"background: GoldenRod;\" |Ice Hockey Superleague | style=\"background: Gold;\" |Elite Ice Hockey League | style=\"background: Gold;\" |Elite Ice Hockey League | style=\"background: Gold;\" |Elite Ice Hockey League | style=\"background: Gold;\" |Elite Ice Hockey League | style=\"background: Gold;\" |Elite Ice Hockey League |- | style=\"background: DarkSeaGreen;\" |BHL Division 1 | style=\"background: IndianRed;\" |British National League | style=\"background: IndianRed;\" |British National League | style=\"background: IndianRed;\" |British National League | style=\"background: IndianRed;\" |British National League | style=\"background: IndianRed;\" |British National League | style=\"background: gray;\" |English Premier Ice Hockey League | style=\"background: gray;\" |English Premier Ice Hockey League | style=\"background: silver;\"|National Ice Hockey League | style=\"background: silver;\"|National Ice Hockey League National League |- | rowspan=\"2\" | | rowspan=\"2\" ! style=\"background: silver;\"| ENIHL | style=\"background: silver;\" |National Division | style=\"background: silver;\"|Premier Division/League | rowspan=\"2\" ! style=\"background: gray;\"|English Premier Ice Hockey League | rowspan=\"2\" ! style=\"background: gray;\"|English Premier Ice Hockey League | rowspan=\"2\" ! style=\"background: silver;\"| ENIHL | rowspan=\"2\" ! style=\"background: silver;\"|National Ice Hockey League | rowspan=\"2\" ! style=\"background: silver;\"| | rowspan=\"2\" ! style=\"background: silver;\"|National Ice Hockey League League 1 |- | style=\"background: silver;\" |ENIHL | style=\"background: silver;\" |ENIHL |- | | | | | style=\"background: silver;\" |ENIHL | style=\"background: silver;\"|ENIHL | | | |rowspan=\"2\" ! style=\"background: silver;\"|National Ice Hockey League League 2 |} Following its inaugural season, an upper tier within the ENIHL was founded, so as to serve as a league for the members of the BNL who could not afford to remain in that league due to the increased operating costs; but at the same time played ice hockey to a higher standard that of the other ENIHL teams. This division was originally known as the National Division, and during the 1997\u201398 season the teams in this division played dual schedules; a series of games solely amongst themselves, and another amongst all of the teams which fell under the jurisdiction of the ENIHL at this time. Solihull Blaze won the league and play-off trophies of both formats during this inaugural season. At the start of the 1998\u201399 season the divisions, whilst still both under the ENIHL umbrella, performed in their own separate competitions; and the national division adopted the name Premier Division, and later on became known as the Premier League. By the end of the season the league had established itself outside of the ENIHL as the English Premier Ice Hockey League (EPIHL); reducing the ENIHL to the fourth level of Britain's ice hockey pyramid. However, in 2005 the BNL disbanded; leaving the EPIHL to take its place as the second tier of the national game and, consequently, re-establishing the ENIHL as the third tier of British ice hockey.http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/leagues/80.html In April 2007, the EIHA lowered the upper age limit within the junior leagues, abolishing the under 19 age limit to become under 18. Due to the large gap from junior level to the EPIHL, many teams were forced to enter a reserve team into the ENIHL. This increased the size of the league from 22 teams through to 30 teams for the 2007\u201308 season.History , Vectis Tigers (last accessed 13 April 2009) Later in the 2007 off-season, the EIHA suggested introducing an under 25 age limit across the league.ENGLISH ICE HOCKEY ASSOCIATION COMPANY LIMITED MEETING OF DIRECTORS 8TH JUNE 2007 (last accessed 13 April 2009) However, this age limit was removed within weeks in favour of a drive towards developing players.News from the ENIHL AGM - Under 25's Age Limit Removed , Invicta Dynamos (last accessed 13 April 2009) The ENIHL was restructured for the 2008/2009 season into two regional divisions North and South, with two leagues in each regional division. Following the 2012\u201313 the league was renamed the National Ice Hockey League, removing the word English due to non-English teams participating. In 2013, it was agreed at the EIHA AGM to restructure the Northern league into two conferences; Moralee and Laidler. The split was done primarily on regions and neither conference was regarded as being higher than the other. However, at the following year's AGM, it was agreed to return to a tiered Division 1 and Division 2 format. However, the conference names remained in place with Division 1 taking the Moralee Conference title and Division 2 the Laidler Conference title. In 2014, it was agreed at the EIHA AGM to restructure the Southern Division 2 league to have Western and Eastern Conferences. Due to the odd-number of teams in the league, the Eastern Conference had six teams while the Western Conference had five teams. Both conferences were run completely separately and each winner was only regarded as being the conference winner, with no implication of one conference winner being regarded as the league winner. A two-round playoff format was introduced at the end of the season to determine a league-wide winner. The winner of the playoffs would then be the team promoted to Division 1. In 2017, the two conferences were reunited. == Players == The league itself is considered to be a development league, and as such the players are normally amateur. Many teams have affiliate teams in higher leagues. Other teams are aligned with junior ice hockey clubs, and exist to ensure that when players hit 18 there is still a possibility for them to play competitive hockey if they have not joined a professional team. ==The system== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !

At the end of the regular season, the top 4 teams in the division take part in the Playoff weekend, which are one-off games, replacing the previous home/away format. There is not usually a third placed Playoff. Blackburn Hawks currently hold the record of most consecutive final appearances with four from 2011/12 to the present season, winning in 2012/13 and 2014/15. The rules regarding promotion and relegation between the Moralee and Laidler regularly change. There are occasional cup competitions, but the format changes in most seasons but usually takes part in a league format. ===South=== Each team plays each of the other teams in their league a total of four times; twice home, twice away. Unlike the North, the South keep a two-legged home-and-away format throughout the playoffs. In Division 1, this is a three-rounded format, involving the teams who finished in the top 8 of the regular season. In Division 2, this is a two-rounded format, involving the teams who finished in the top 2 of their conference. In the semi-finals, the conference winners play the runners-up from the other conference with the final involving the winners of the two semi-finals. Division 1 has a Cup competition involving six of the teams. These are initially split into two groups of three, with the top two from each group going on to a knock-out, two-legged semi-final and final. Division 2 has a Cup competition involving eight teams. These are initially split into two groups of four, with each group containing two teams from each conference. The top two teams from each group go onto a single Cup Final Weekend held in a single venue, with semi-finals on the Saturday determining the two teams to play the final on the Sunday. ==League champions== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:85%\" |- |- bgcolor=\"#dddddd\" !Season !Northern Champions !Southern Champions !Playoff Champions !English National Cup Champions !North 2 Champions !South 2 Champions |- |1996/97 | Kingston Jets | London Raiders | Wightlink Raiders | N/A | N/A | N/A |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1997/98 | Solihull Blaze | Invicta Dynamos | Solihull Blaze | N/A | N/A | N/A |- |1998/99 | Billingham Stars | Cardiff Devils | Billingham Stars | N/A | N/A | N/A |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1999/00 | Billingham Stars | Haringey Greyhounds | Whitley Warriors | N/A | N/A | N/A |- |2000/01 | Billingham Stars | Basingstoke Buffalo | Whitley Warriors | Whitley Warriors | N/A | N/A |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |2001/02 | Whitley Warriors | Basingstoke Buffalo | Whitley Warriors | Whitley Warriors | N/A | N/A |- |2002/03 | Sheffield Scimitars | Basingstoke Buffalo | Basingstoke Buffalo | N/A | N/A | N/A |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |2003/04 | Flintshire Freeze | Invicta Dynamos | Sheffield Scimitars | Sheffield Scimitars | N/A | N/A |- |2004/05 | Sheffield Scimitars | Invicta Dynamos | Sheffield Scimitars | Sheffield Scimitars | N/A | N/A |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |2005/06 | Billingham Stars | Invicta Dynamos | Invicta Dynamos | Invicta Dynamos | N/A | N/A |- |2006/07 | TDC Northern Stars | Invicta Dynamos | Sheffield Scimitars | Sheffield Scimitars | N/A | N/A |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |2007/08 | Nottingham Lions | Peterborough Islanders | Whitley Warriors | Sheffield Scimitars | N/A | Invicta Dynamos |- |2008/09 | Sheffield Scimitars | Invicta Dynamos | Nottingham Lions | Sheffield Scimitars | Telford Titans | Chelmsford Chieftains |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |2009/10 | Whitley Warriors | Invicta Dynamos | N/A | N/A | TDC Northern Stars | Bristol Pitbulls |- |2010/11 | Whitley Warriors | Wightlink Raiders | N/A | N/A | Solihull Barons | Slough Jets |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |2011/12 | Billingham Stars | London Raiders | N/A | N/A | Solway Sharks | Solent Devils |- |2012/13 | Solway Sharks | Chelmsford Chieftains | N/A | N/A | Nottingham Lions | Oxford City Stars |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |2013/14 | Solway Sharks | Chelmsford Chieftains | N/A | N/A | Solihull Barons | Oxford City Stars |- |2014/15 | Blackburn Hawks | Chelmsford Chieftains | N/A | N/A | Solihull Barons | Bristol Pitbulls |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |2015/16 | Blackburn Hawks | Chelmsford Chieftains | N/A | N/A | Deeside Dragons | Chelmsford Warriors |- |2016/17 | Solway Sharks | Chelmsford Chieftains | N/A | N/A | Blackburn Eagles | Cardiff Fire |- |2017/18 | Sheffield Steeldogs | Basingstoke Bison | Basingstoke Bison | N/A | Altrincham Aces | Oxford City Stars |- |2018/19 | Hull Pirates | Swindon Wildcats | Hull Pirates | N/A | Widnes Wild | Slough Jets |- |} ==Rules== Follows International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) rules,Rulebook 2006-2010 International Ice Hockey Federation as used by countries in all major European leagues.
