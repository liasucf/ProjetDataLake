    "text": "Becel is a brand of margarine produced by Upfield and sold in a number of countries including Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden, and Turkey. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Slovakia, Poland, Czech Republic, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa the product is sold under the name Flora, in France as Fruit d'Or, in Israel as Mazola, and in the United States as Promise. The name Becel originates from the three letter acronym BCL (Blood Cholesterol Lowering). When introduced, the blood cholesterol lowering effect was achieved by modifying the triacylglycerol (TAG) profile of the fat used in the margarine: an increased level of poly- unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) reduces the blood cholesterol level.A. Keys et al., Serum cholesterol response to changes in the diet. IV. Particular saturated fatty acids in the diet, Metabolism 14, 776-787 (1965) More recently, products were introduced under the \"Pro-activ\" sub-brand. These products are based on the effects of plant sterols and sterol esters on blood cholesterol lowering.M.B. Katan et al., Efficacy and Safety of Plant Stanols and Sterols in the Management of Blood Cholesterol Levels, Mayo Clinic Proceedings 78, 965-978 (2003) In recent years the Becel/Flora brand has added cooking oil, pot yogurt and yogurt drinks to the non-margarine products, all of which are designed to help lower blood cholesterol level. This is achieved by a highly increased resorption of beta-sitosterol and other phytosterols which accumulate especially in the intima of blood vessels and may cause arteriosclerotic plaques. In consequence, consumption of Becel products does not lower the risk for coronary diseases such as arteriosclerosis and therefore does not inherit any medical benefits. ==European Food Safety Authority== In light of supporting evidence from various clinical trials, Becel Pro-activ gained the European Union's European Food Safety Authority\u2019s (EFSA) approval for its claim to reduce the levels of cholesterol in the blood. It does not reduce the risk of heart disease, and is not claimed to do so by Upfield, although many consumers believe it does. ==2010 Academy Awards controversy== In 2009, Becel commissioned Sarah Polley to direct a two-minute short \"to inspire women to take better care of that particular vital organ\" [the heart]. A week before the short's planned premiere in Canada during a commercial break during the CTV broadcast of the 82nd Academy Awards, Polley attracted headlines for taking her name off the film. Polley had understood that the film, titled \"The Heart\", would be used to promote the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, but was unhappy with the association with Becel. \"Regretfully, I am forced to remove my name from the film and disassociate myself from it. I have never actively promoted any corporate brand, and cannot do so now.\" In response, Becel said it was a \"founding sponsor\" of the Canadian Heart Truth campaign and had commissioned the film \"to put heart health on the radar of Canadian women.\" ==References== ==External links== *Becel Brazil website *Becel Canada website *Becel Denmark website *Becel Germany website *Becel Netherlands website *Becel Belgium website *Becel Turkey website *Flora Poland website *Flora UK website *Flora pro.activ website *Fruit d'Or France website Category:Former Unilever brands Category:Upfield (company) brands Category:Margarine brands ",
