The community boasts a tiled indoor pool with a retractable roof, two tennis courts, a newly renovated fitness center, yoga studio, Peloton bike studio, walking and biking trails, and an outdoor pool. ==History== Cambridge building Built in the Jacobean Revival style, Alden Park Manor was founded and built in 1926. The complex has three sets of towers - the Manor, Kenilworth, and Cambridge buildings. Designed by Edwin Rorke and developed by Lawrence Jones, it was built in a park-like setting on thirty-eight acres that had been the Justus C. Strawbridge estate. It was the first co-operative apartment complex in Philadelphia, although it now operates only as rentals. The complex overlooks the Wissahickon Valley section of Fairmount Park in the city's Germantown section. The buildings are surrounded by lawns and gardens, a rarity in the fairly urban setting. The complex features a unique indoor swimming pool which is lined with Mercer tiles and has a retractable roof. Alden Park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 and on the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places in 1981. The complex has been substantially renovated since 2015. ==External links== * *Alden Park Apartments at Philadelphia Architects and Buildings ==References== Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Philadelphia Category:Residential buildings completed in 1925 Category:Germantown, Philadelphia ",
