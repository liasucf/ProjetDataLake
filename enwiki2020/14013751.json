One is the definitions of \"force\", \"home grown terrorism\" and \"violent radicalization\" (section 899A) that some perceive as overly broad or vague. Critics charge that the vagueness in these definitions would permit the government to classify many types of venerated American political activity, such as civil disobedience, as terrorism. Critics frequently cite Section 899A, which reads, in part: \"The use, planned use, or threatened use, of force ...to coerce the ..government, (or) civilian population ..in furtherance of political or social objectives\",HR 1955 section 899A(accessed December 8, 2007) as particularly problematic. They argue that major societal reforms, which are now accepted but were perceived at the time as threatening to the government, such as civil rights, suffrage, and others, would be classified as terrorism.editorial from Baltimore Sun and others(accessed December 21, 2007)Reporter Justin Mohn for ManeaterColumnist Matt Renner for truthout(accessed December 12, 2007)Reporter Don Williams for Knoxville Voice (accessed December 12, 2007) ===Political reaction=== Then-presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich said he believed the bill to be \"unconstitutional\" and has referred to the bill as a \"thought crime bill\".Kucinich on 1955, December 2, 2007.

In North Carolina, Republican Congressional candidate BJ Lawson has made the bill a theme in his campaign against Democrat David Price, who voted in favor of the bill. ===Media reaction=== The Baltimore Sun published an opinion article by Professor Emeritus Ralph E.

Caroline Fredrickson asserted \"the bill should read 'intentionally aiding and abetting' violent radicalization, 'because otherwise you're really looking at what someone's thought processes are, what their ideology is, and not what they're doing.'\" Harman defended the resolution, saying: \"HR 1955 is not about interfering with speech or belief. The hearing record makes that abundantly clear. Radical speech, as I have said repeatedly, is protected under our Constitution.\"Mat Korade, Harman, ACLU Exchange Barbs Over Terrorism Commission, November 28, 2007.
