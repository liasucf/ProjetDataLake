    "text": "Nations in which Portuguese is an official language ( de facto or de jure). Lusophone countries are a subset of those where Portuguese is the main native language. Lusophones () are an ethnolinguistic group of peoples and nations that comprise an estimated 270 million people spread across 10 sovereign states and territories that recognize Portuguese as an official language. This area, known as the Lusofonia or Lusophone World (Mundo Lus\u00f3fono), is the corresponding community of Lusophone nations which exist in Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. The history of the Lusophone World is intrinsically linked with the history of the Portuguese Empire, although Portuguese diaspora, the Brazilian diaspora and the Cape Verdean diaspora communities have also played a role in spreading the Portuguese language and Lusophone culture. Today, Portuguese-speaking nations of the world come together for cooperation in politics, culture, and the economy, through the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth. ==Etymology== The term Lusophone is a classical compound, whereby the combining form \"Luso-\" derives from the Latin term for an area roughly corresponding to modern Portugal, called Lusitania. The suffix \"-phone\" derives from the Ancient Greek word (ph\u014dn\u0113), meaning \"voice\". The use of the term Lusophone mirrors similar terms, such as Anglophone for English- speakers, Francophone for French-speakers, Hispanophone for Spanish-speakers, and Sinophone for Chinese-speakers. The term is sometimes used in reference to the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, similar to the Francophonie. ==Officially Lusophone countries== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ !

It is one of the two Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China (the other being Anglophone Hong Kong, a former British colony). # Equatorial Guinea adopted Portuguese as one of its official languages in 2007, being admitted to CPLP in 2014. The use of the Portuguese language in this country is limited. However, a Portuguese-based creole language, Annobonese Creole, is used, mainly on islands of Annobon and Bioko. # 15% of Uruguay's population speaks Portuguese (in the northern regions near Brazil) as a native language though it is not an official language.The Portuguese Dialect of Uruguay (DPU) is spoken by circa 15% of the Uruguayan population according Juan Pedro Mir, director of education of the Ministry of Education and Culture of the country. pgl.gal (19 August 2017) This makes Portuguese the second most spoken language of the country.
