Brodeur stated that her mother supported her efforts to have the book written; by the time it was completed, the mother's illness was too severe for her to read the book. Malabar Brodeur, by 2019, had dementia. ==Content== Masad wrote that the work \"reads very much like a novel with a first-person narrator\". Masad states that the way Brodeur maintains her mindset that hiding her mother's affair was a good thing to do until the latter part of the memoir makes it \"especially novel-like\".

Publisher's Weekly, which deemed it a featured book, wrote that it is \"page-turning\" and \"This layered narrative of deceit, denial, and disillusionment is a surefire bestseller.\" ==References== Category:2019 non-fiction books Category:American memoirs ",
