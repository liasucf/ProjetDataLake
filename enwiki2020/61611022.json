Mencken. ==Mencken scholarship== Rodgers became interested in Mencken while researching Sara Haardt, who had attended Goucher College from whence Rodgers graduated in 1981. She discovered a trove of correspondences between Mencken and his eventual wife which she compiled and edited as the book Mencken and Sara: A Life in Letters: The Private Correspondence of H.L. Mencken and Sara Haardt. > Certainly Mencken\u2019s name came up during the course of my studies. But my > real introduction to Mencken was shortly before my graduation from Goucher > College, in 1981, while I was researching the papers of Southern writer and > alumna Sara Haardt, whom Mencken had married, thereby shattering his > reputation as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Foremost Bachelor.\u201d I was putting away one of her > scrapbooks in the vault of the library when I literally tripped over a box > of love letters between her and Mencken.

To say that my life changed at that moment would be an > understatement. Suddenly, a door was swung open into Mencken\u2019s life through > the tender route of romantic correspondence. In those days my dream was to > go to graduate school and write (yet another!) dull thesis on T. S.

Rodgers has subsequently edited collections of essays by Mencken, and authored a lavishly praised Mencken biography. Joseph C. Goulden, founder of The Mencken Society, declared Rodgers\u2019 book to be \"the most superb and entertaining biography (in any field) that I\u2019ve read in years.\u201d Kirkus Reviews praised the book as \u201cThe best biography of Mencken to date.\u201d The Blade found it to be \u201cby far the best Mencken biography ever written...a masterpiece.\u201d Publishers Weekly commended it as \"a meticulous portrait of one of the most original and complicated men in American letters.\u201d ==Personal life== Rodgers was born October 31, 1958 in Santiago, Chile, the daughter of Maria Arce Fernandez and William Livingston Rodgers. She has a sister, Linda, and a brother, William. Having met him at a tribute to the Baltimore Evening Sun, she married journalist Jules Witcover on June 21, 1997 in the rear garden of his historic home in Georgetown, in Washington, D.C. ==Selected works as author, editor, contributor== ===Books=== *Mencken and Sara: A Life in Letters: The Private Correspondence of H.L.
