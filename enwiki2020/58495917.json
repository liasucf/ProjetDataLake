    "text": "The Wisconsin Motor Manufacturing Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, manufactured internal combustion engines between 1909 and 2018?. In its early years Wisconson made a full range of engines for automobiles, trucks, heavy construction machines, and maritime use. After 1930 it focused on small air- cooled engines widely used in agriculture and construction machines. Wisconsin has always been an engine vendor, selling to other manufacurers, and has never built any equipment that used their engines. Wisconsin passed through the hands of a number of owners and production at their Tennessee plant ended in 2018???. == History == *March 12, 1909 Wisconsin Motor was incorporated by Charles H. John and Arthur F. Milbrath.

In the 1950s they were able to claim they were the world's largest manufacturer of heavy-duty air-cooled engines. All Wisconsin's products were 4-cycle and they had power outputs from . There were single, inline two, V-two, and V-four cylinder models. The engines were designed for outdoor field service in industries including agriculture, construction, marine, oil-field equipment and railway maintenance. Wisconsin Motor Corporation. New York Herald Tribune (European Edition) (Paris, France), Monday, Feb. 4, 1952. There are a wide range of variations in each engine family, including displacement, vertical and horizontal crankshafts, power ratings, and fuel used. Fuels can be gasoline, heating oil, kerosene, LPG, and CNG.

The Stutz Bearcat car was available with either Wisconsin's four-cylinder Type A or their six- cylinder engine. Both engines were rated at 60 horsepower. Stutz began to build their own engines in 1917. Pierce-Arrow was among other customers for Wisconsin engines. Wisconsin engines also powered the trucks made by The FWD Corporation.Belt Pulley Magazine, September/October 2004.
