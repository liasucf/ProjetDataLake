Andra was brought up in a typical Serbian, late 19th-century middle-class environment. After completing his gymnasium, he studied law at Visoka \u0161kola (Grandes \u00e9coles) in Belgrade where he graduated in 1873. His first published work \"The Economic State of Serbia in 14th-Century\" brought him immediate recognition and fame. After entering the civil service, he formed an alliance with Stojan Proti\u0107 and Lazar Pa\u010du and the trio became one of the closest political associates and personal colleagues in the Serbian government. The other leaders consisted of Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107, Alexander (Aca) Stanojevi\u0107, and Lazar Pa\u010du. Nikoli\u0107 continued to keep good relations with a group of young Radicals who left the party to found their own Independent Radical Party in 1901, but he did not join them. Andra Nikoli\u0107 served in several governments (Sava Gruji\u0107, Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 (13 May 1890 - 21 August 1892), Lazar Doki\u0107 (13 April - 5 December 1893), \u0110or\u0111e Simi\u0107 (29 December 1896 - 23 October 1897), Nikola Pasi\u0107 (10 December 1904 - 29 May 1905), Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 and Petar Velimirovi\u0107 (30 April 1906 - 24 February 1909), subsequently acting many times over as Minister of Education, Minister of Foreign Affairs (from 1 April 1893 until 4 June 1893; from 4 June 1893 until 23 November 1893; and from 21 September 1903 until 26 January 1904), Speaker of the National Assembly and the head of the diplomatic mission in Paris.As Minister of Education, he passed a law on 27 February 1905 making his alma mater the University of Belgrade. Nikoli\u0107 was one of the cosigners of the Treaty of London, which ended the Second Balkan War in 1913. Andra Nikoli\u0107 is remembered as the voice of reason and common sense in the Radical Main Committee since 1881. He died in Paris on 28 September 1918. His remains were eventually transferred to Serbia in 1926. ==Works== Nikoli\u0107 was not only concerned with law and politics but in literature as well. He began to write aesthetic literary and theatrical reviews early in his career.His literary works were published in literary journals, Otad\u017ebina (Fatherland), Rad (Opus), Delo (The Act), Odjek (Echo), Samouprava (Self-Government) and many other such periodicals and magazines. In the journal Otad\u017ebina, he edited a section called \"Literary Review\" from 1875 until 1881. He further distinguished himself by his literary works as an excellent expert in the Serbian language, it was no wonder that he was elected professor of History of Serbian Literature at the Grandes \u00e9coles in 1880, but declined the offer to remain in politics. He was a literary critic of great talent, fine observation, and great style even when he reviewed the work of his fellow politicians. He collaborated with Stojan Novakovi\u0107 and together published some editions of syntax books, and translations of the works by Taras Shevchenko. Nikoli\u0107 also translated George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss (1860) into Serbian under the title Vodenica na flossi in 1893. == References == * Translated and adapted from Serbian Wikipedia: \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438\u045b Category:Education ministers Category:Politicians from Belgrade Category:1853 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Presidents of the National Assembly of Serbia Category:People's Radical Party politicians Category:Foreign ministers of Serbia ",
