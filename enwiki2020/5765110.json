The area was settled in 1812 by workers in the various industries that provided Bogot\u00e1 with its day-to-day necessities. The name Chapinero comes from the shoemakers of bespoke shoes for chapines, the local expression for people suffering of pigeon toe syndrome. Toward the end of the 19th century, the area was further settled with mansions and country estates. As the urbanized city expanded, the area was integrated accordingly. Mule- pulled trams were extended northward in 1875, followed by electric tracks in 1910. When the Special District of Bogot\u00e1 was formed in 1955, the area was made into a locality. At that time the El Lago, Chic\u00f3, and Catalu\u00f1a neighborhoods were added into the locality. The physical boundaries remained the same under the reorganization into the Capital District that took place in 1991. Together with La Candelaria and Teusaquillo, Chapinero is one of the traditional neighborhoods that is distinctive of a particular era in the city's history and urban growth. A historically upper-class neighborhood, the southern part of Chapinero is famous for areas with large Victorian houses reflecting the influence of European architectural styles in Bogot\u00e1 at the beginning of the 20th century. == Economy and culture == Our Lady of Lourdes Basilica 93 Park Chapinero is one of the most important commercial and economic zones of the capital city.
