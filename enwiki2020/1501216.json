Cantor plays a hobo named Aloysius \"Al\" Babson, who walks into the camp of a movie company that is making the Arabian Nights. He falls asleep and dreams he is in Baghdad as an advisor to the Sultan (Young). He organizes work programs, taxes the rich, and abolishes the army, in a spoof of Roosevelt's New Deal. The cast also includes Gypsy Rose Lee, using the stage name of Louise Hovick, as the Sultana. The Raymond Scott Quintette also appears, performing \"Twilight In Turkey.\" ==Cast== *Eddie Cantor ...

A brief shot of Black is edited into the Ali Baba footage to create the impression that her character played a bit role in that film. Some scenes from Ali Baba Goes to Town are described in detail in Swing Time by Zadie Smith. The character Tracey resembles the dancer Jeni LeGon, who performs in the film. ==See also== * List of American films of 1937 ==External links== * Category:1937 films Category:1937 musical films Category:American black-and- white films Category:American films Category:Blackface minstrel shows and films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by David Butler Category:Films set in Baghdad Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American musical films ",
