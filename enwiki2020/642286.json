Situated on the banks of the Tigris River, it is the administrative capital of the Diyarbak\u0131r Province of southeastern Turkey. It is the third-largest city in Turkey's Southeastern Anatolia Region, after \u015eanl\u0131urfa and Gaziantep. Diyarbak\u0131r has been a focal point of the conflict between the Turkish state and various Kurdish insurgent groups.https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/tensions-increase-already-fragile- kurdish-peace-process-faulters-turkey Many Kurds view Diyarbakir as the capital of Kurdistan.https://mesopotamia.coop/cities/amed- diyarbakir/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/world/europe/an-aleppo-like- landscape-in-a-kurdish-redoubt-of-turkey.html ==Names and etymology== The city's name (; ; , , which means the Land of Bakir; , ;Western Armenian pronunciation: Dikranagerd; , ; , ; ) is inscribed as Amed on the sheath of a sword from the Assyrian period, and the same name was used in other contemporary Syriac and Arabic works.Diyarbak\u0131r . Turkish Airlines. Retrieved 2012-05-13. The Romans and Byzantines called the city Amida. Amit is found in Empire of Trebizond official documents from 1358.Zehiroglu, Ahmet M. ; \"Trabzon Imparatorlugu\" 2016 () ; p.223 Among the Artukid and Akkoyunlu it was known as \"Black Amid\" (Kara Amid) for the dark color of its walls, while in the Zafername, or eulogies in praise of military victories, it is called \"Black Fortress\" (Kara Kale). In the Book of Dede Korkut and some other Turkish works it appears as Kara Hamid. Following the Arab conquests in the seventh century, the Arab Bakr tribe settled in this region, which became known as the Diyar Bakr (\"landholdings of the Bakr tribe\", in , ).Abdul- Rahman Mizouri Taj Al- Arifeen: Udday bin Musafir Al- Kurdy Al- Hakary Is not an Umayyad. Part Two. College of Arts/ Dohuk University (2001) In November 1937, Turkish President Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk visited the city and, after expressing uncertainty on the exact etymology of the city, in December of the same year ordered that it be renamed \"Diyarbak\u0131r\", which means \"land of copper\" in Turkish after the abundant resources of copper around the city.See \u00dcng\u00f6r, U\u011fur (2011), The Making of Modern Turkey: Nation and State in Eastern Anatolia, 1913\u20131950. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 244. . ==History== Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict. The western half is currently (2017) being demolished. ===Antiquity=== The area around Diyarbak\u0131r has been inhabited by humans from the Stone Age with tools from that period having been discovered in the nearby Hilar cave complex. The pre-pottery neolithic B settlement of \u00c7ay\u00f6n\u00fc dates to over 10,000 years ago and its excavated remains are on display at the Diyarbak\u0131r Museum. Another important site is Girikihaciyan Tumulus in E\u011fil.Charles Gates, [Ancient Cities], 2011, p.19 The first major civilization to establish themselves in the region of what is now Diyarbak\u0131r were the Hurrian kingdom of the Mitanni. The city was first mentioned by Assyrian texts as the capital of a Semitic kingdom. It was then ruled by a succession of nearly every polity that controlled Upper Mesopotamia, including the Arameans, Assyrians, Urartu, Armenians, Achaemenid Persians, Medes, Seleucids, and Parthians.Trevor Bryce, The Kingdom of the Hittites, 1999 p. 137 The Roman Republic gained control of the city in 66 BC, by which stage it was named \"Amida\".Theodor Mommsen History of Rome, The Establishment of the Military Monarchy. Italian.classic-literature.co.uk. Retrieved 2012-05-13. In 359, Shapur II of Persia captured Amida after a siege of 73 days which is vividly described by the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus.The Eye of Command, Kimberly Kagan, p. 23 === Ecclesiastical history === Syriac Christianity took hold in the region between the 1st and 4th centuries AD, particularly amongst the Assyrians of the city. The earliest documented bishop of Amida was Simeon of the Assyrian Church of the East, who took part in the First Council of Nicaea in 325, on behalf of the Assyrians. In the next century, Saint Acacius of Amida (who died in 425, and is included in the Roman MartyrologyMartyrologium Romanum (Vatican Press 2001 ), under 9 April) was noted for having sold the church's gold and silver vessels to ransom and assist Persian prisoners of war. Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II (408\u2013450) divided the Roman province of Mesopotamia into two, and made Amida the capital of Mesopotamia Prima, and thereby also the metropolitan see for all the province's bishoprics. A sixth-century Notitia Episcopatuum indicates as suffragans of Amida the sees of Martyropolis, Ingila, Belabitene, Arsamosata, Sophene, Kitharis, Cefa, and Zeugma.Echos d'Orient X, 1907, pp. 96 and 145. The Annuario Pontificio adds Bethzabda and Dadima. The names of several of the successors of Acacius are known, but their orthodoxy is unclear. The last whose orthodoxy is certain is Cyriacus, a participant in the Second Council of Constantinople (553). Many bishops of the Byzantine Empire fled in the face of the Persian invasion of the early 7th century, with a resultant spread of the Jacobite Church. Michael the Syrian gives a list of Jacobite bishops of Amida down to the 13th century.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 989\u2013996http://www.al- monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/04/turkey-pkk-clashes-armenian-church- collateral-damage.html Why the Turkish government seized this Armenian church Inside the St. Giragos Armenian Church photographed after its restoration, 2012. In March 2016, the Turkish government confiscated this and several other churches in Sur, Diyarbak\u0131r after the Siege of Sur (2016). At some stage, Amida became a see of the Armenian Church. The bishops who held the see in 1650 and 1681 were in full communion with the Holy See, and in 1727 Peter Derboghossian sent his profession of faith to Rome. He was succeeded by two more bishops of the Armenian Catholic Church, Eugenius and Ioannes of Smyrna, the latter of whom died in Constantinople in 1785. After a long vacancy, three more bishops followed. The diocese had some 5,000 Armenian Catholics in 1903,Annuaire Pontifical Catholique, 1903, p. 173. but it lost most of its population in the 1915 Armenian Genocide. The last diocesan bishop of the see, Andreas Elias Celebian, was killed with some 600 of his flock in the summer of 1915.Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Leipzig 1931, p. 456Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, Complementi, Leipzig 1931, p. 93F.

Tcholakian, L'\u00e9glise arm\u00e9nienne catholique en Turquie, 1998 An eparchy for the local members of the Syriac Catholic Church was established in 1862. Ignatius Philip I Arkus, who was its first bishop, was elected patriarch in 1866, and kept the governance of the see of Amida, which he exercised through a patriarchal vicar. The eparchy was united to that of Mardin in 1888. Persecution of Christians in the Ottoman Empire during the First World War brought an end to the existence of both these Syrian residential sees.S. Vailh\u00e9, Antioche. Patriarcat syrien-catholique, in Dictionnaire de Th\u00e9ologie Catholique, Vol. I, Paris 1903, coll. 1433O. Werner, Orbis terrarum catholicus, Freiburg 1890, p. 164 In 1966, the Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Amida, with jurisdiction over all Chaldean Catholics in Turkey, was revived in Diyarbak\u0131r, with the city being both episcopal see and location of the diocesan cathedral of St. Mary Church, Diyarbak\u0131r. As of 2015, there are two Chaldean churches and three Armenian churches in at least periodic operation. Three other churches are in ruins, all Armenian: one in Sur, Diyarbak\u0131r, one in the citadel that is now part of a museum complex, and one in another part of the city. ==== Titular sees ==== No longer a residential bishopric until 1966 (Chaldean rite), Amida is today listed by the Catholic Church as a multiple titular see,Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 831 separately for the Roman Rite and two Eastern Catholic particular churches sui iuris. ===== Latin titular see ===== Amida of the Romans was suppressed in 1970, having had many archiepiscopal incumbents with a singular episcopal exception : * Domingo Valent\u00edn Guerra Arteaga y Leiva (19 December 1725 \u2013 8 March 1728) * Francisco Casto Royo (15 December 1783 \u2013 September 1803) * Ga\u00e9tan Giunta (6 October 1829 \u2013 unknown date) * Titular Bishop Augustus van Heule, Jesuits (S.J.)

So far, it has had the following incumbents, of the fitting episcopal rank with an archiepiscopal exception: * Gr\u00e9goire Ghabroyan, Patriarchal Clergy Institute of Bzommar (I.C.P.B.) (3 January 1977 \u2013 30 June 1986) as Vicar Apostolic of France of the Armenians (3 January 1977 \u2013 30 June 1986); later Eparch (Bishop) of Sainte- Croix-de-Paris of the Armenians (France) (30 June 1986 \u2013 2 February 2013) and Apostolic Visitor in Western Europe of the Armenians (30 June 1986 \u2013 8 June 2013), then Patriarchal Administrator of Cilicia of the Armenians (in Beirut, Lebanon) (25 June 2015 \u2013 25 July 2015), finally Patriarch of Cilicia as Gr\u00e9goire Pierre XX Ghabroyan (24 July 2015 \u2013 present) and President of Synod of the Armenian Catholic Church (25 July 2015 \u2013 present) * Titular Archbishop L\u00e9von Boghos Z\u00e9kiyan (21 May 2014 \u2013 21 March 2015), as Apostolic Administrator sede plena of Istanbul of the Armenians (Turkey) (21 May 2014 \u2013 21 March 2015), later succeeded as Archeparch (Archbishop) of Istanbul of the Armenians (21 March 2015.03.21 \u2013 present) and President of Episcopal Conference of Turkey (April 2015 \u2013 present) * K\u00e9vork Assadourian (5 September 2015 \u2013 present), Auxiliary Bishop of Beirut of the Armenians; no previous prelature ===== Syriac Catholic titular see ===== Established in 1963 as Titular archbishopric of the highest (Metropolitan) rank, Amida of the Syriacs. It has been vacant for decades, having had the following incumbent of Metropolitan rank; * Titular Archbishop Flavien Zacharie Melki (6 July 1963 \u2013 30 November 1989), as Patriarchal Vicar of Lebanon of the Syriacs (6 July 1963 \u2013 death 1983) ===Middle Ages=== Great Mosque of Diyarbak\u0131r In 639, the city was captured by the Muslim conquests, and introduced the religion of Islam. The city passed under Umayyad and then Abbasid control, but with the progressive fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate from the late 9th century, it periodically came under the rule of autonomous dynasties. Isa ibn al-Shaykh al-Shaybani and his descendants ruled the city and the wider Diyar Bakr from 871 until 899, when Caliph al-Mu'tadid restored Abbasid control, but the area soon passed to another local dynasty, the Hamdanids. The latter were displaced by the Buyids in 978, who were in turn followed by the Marwanids in 983. The Marwanids ruled until 1085, the Seljuks took the city from the Marwanids in 1085, the city came under the rule of the Mardin branch of the Oghuz Turks and then the Anatolian beylik of the Artuqids. The city came under the Ayyubid Sultanate in 1183 and ruled the city until it was taken over by the Mongols in 1260, the city was taken over by the competing Turkic federations of the Kara Koyunlu (the Black Sheep) first and then the Aq Qoyunlu until the rise of the Persian Safavids, who naturally took over the city and the wider region. ===Safavids and Ottomans=== The Ottomans charged against the Safavids and during Ottoman rule, the government began to assert its authority in the region in the early 19th century. Concerned with independent-mindedness of the Kurdish principalities, the Ottomans sought to curb their influence and bring them under the control of the central government in Constantinople. However, removal from power of these hereditary principalities led to more instability in the region from the 1840s onwards. In their place, sufi sheiks and religious orders rose to prominence and spread their influence throughout the region. One of the prominent Sufi leaders was Shaikh Ubaidalla Nahri, who began a revolt in the region between Lakes Van and Urmia. The area under his control covered both Ottoman and Qajar territories. Shaikh Ubaidalla is regarded as one of the earliest leaders who pursued modern nationalist ideas among Kurds. In a letter to a British Vice-Consul, he declared: the Kurdish nation is a people apart... we want our affairs to be in our hands'.' The breakup of the Ottoman Empire after its defeat in the First World War led to its dismemberment and establishment of the present-day political boundaries, dividing the Kurdish-inhabited regions between several newly created states. This 17th-century map detail shows Diyarbak\u0131r (west at top). From a 17th- century Ottoman map of the Tigris and Euphrates that may have been created by Evliya \u00c7elebi. Between the early 16th century the city and the much wider Eastern Anatolia region (comprising Eastern Anatolia and Southeastern Anatolia) was being heavily competed between the rivaling Safavids from Persia and the Ottomans, who counted on the support of the Kurdish chieftains around Idris Bitlisi. It was firstly conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1514 by the campaigns of B\u0131y\u0131kl\u0131 Mehmet Pa\u015fa under the rule of Sultan Selim I. Muhammad Han Ustaclu, the Safavid Governor of Diyarbakir, was evicted from the city and killed in the following Battle of Chaldiran in 1514. Following their victory, the Ottomans established the Diyarbekir Eyalet with its centre in Diyarbak\u0131r. The Ottoman eyelet of Diyarbak\u0131r corresponded to Turkey's southeastern provinces today, a rectangular area between the Lake Urmia to Palu and from the southern shores of Lake Van to Cizre and the beginnings of the Syrian desert, although its borders saw some changes over time. The city was an important military base for controlling this region and at the same time a thriving city noted for its craftsmen, producing glass and metalwork. For example, the doors of Jal\u0101l ad-D\u012bn Muhammad R\u016bm\u012b's tomb in Konya were made in Diyarbak\u0131r, as were the gold and silver decorated doors of the tomb of Imam-i Azam Ebu Hanife in Baghdad. Ottoman rule was confirmed by the Peace of Amasya of 1555 which followed after the Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1532\u20131555). However, a recapture of the city followed by Safavid Persia, ruled by shah Abbas I, during the Ottoman-Safavid War (1603\u20131618). Diyarbak\u0131r was retaken by the Safavids once again in 1623\u20131624, during the Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1623\u20131639). In 1895 an estimated 25,000 Armenians and Assyrians were massacred in Diyarbak\u0131r vilayet, including the city. At the turn of the 19th century, the Christian population of the city was mainly made up of Armenians and Syriac Orthodox Christians. The city was also a site of ethnic cleansing of Armenians and Assyrians in 1915; nearly 150,000 were deported from the city. ===Republic of Turkey=== A typical example of Diyarbak\u0131r's historic architectural style, with masonry tiles built of the city's indigenous type of dark basalt stone. Diyarbak\u0131r's city walls, built by Constantius II and extended by Valentinian I between 367 and 375, stretch almost unbroken for about 6 kilometres. Ke\u00e7i Burcu, the Goat Tower, a section of the city wall of Diyarbakir In January 1928, Diyarbak\u0131r became the center of the First Inspectorate-General, a regional subdivision for an area containing the provinces of Hakkari, Van, \u015e\u0131rnak, Mardin, Siirt, Bitlis and \u015eanl\u0131urfa. A Inspectorate-General had wide ranging authorities over all civil, military and educational matters. The post of the Inspectorate-General was abandoned in 1948. But its legal framework was only abandoned in 1952 under the government of the Democrat Party. In a reorganization of the provinces, Diyarbak\u0131r city was made the administrative capital of the Diyarbak\u0131r Province. In 1993 Diyarbakir was established as a Metropolitan Municipality. Its districts are Ba\u011dlar, Bismil, Ergani, Hazro, Kayapinar, \u00c7ermik, \u00c7inar, E\u011fil, Dicle, Kulp, Kocak\u00f6y, Lice, Silvan, Sur, Yeni\u015fehir and Hani. During the 1980s and 1990s, at the peak of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) insurgency, the population of the city grew dramatically as villagers from remote areas where fighting was serious left or were forced to leave for the relative security of the city. After the cessation of hostilities between the PKK and the Turkish army, a large degree of normality returned to the city, with the Turkish government declaring an end to the 15-year period of emergency rule on 30 November 2002. Diyarbak\u0131r grew from a population of 30,000 in the 1930s to 65,000 by 1956, to 140,000 by 1970, to 400,000 by 1990, and eventually swelled to about 1.5 million by 1997. The 41-year-old American-Turkish Pirin\u00e7lik Air Force Base near Diyarbak\u0131r, known as NATO's frontier post for monitoring the former Soviet Union and the Middle East, closed on 30 September 1997. This closure was the result of the general drawdown of US bases in Europe and the improvement in space surveillance technology. The base housed sensitive electronic intelligence-gathering systems that monitored the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Russia. Diyarbak\u0131r has been the victim of terror attacks in recent years. In 2008, a car bomb exploded in the city, killing five people, a blast for which nobody claimed responsibility. In 2015, a political rally of the People's Democratic Party was targeted, killing three people and injuring over 100. And in 2016, two separate attacks in February and March, each killing six people. In November 2016 ISIL perpetrated an attack that killed 9 people and wounded more than 100. In January 2017 another attack was perpetrated against the police, in which 4 police officers died. Between 8 November 2015 and 15 May 2016 large parts of Sur were destroyed in fighting between the Turkish military and the PKK. A 2018 report by Arkeologlar Derne\u011fi \u0130stanbul found that, since 2015, 72% of the city's historic Sur district had been destroyed through demolition and redevelopment, and that laws designed to protect historic monuments had been ignored. They found that the city's \"urban regeneration\" policy was one of demolition and redevelopment rather than one of repairing cultural assets damaged during the recent civil conflict, and because of that many registered historic buildings had been completely destroyed. The extent of the loss of non-registered historic structures is unknown because any historic building fragments revealed during the demolition of modern structures were also demolished.Diyarbakir Ziyareti: \u00c7ati\u015fma, Yikim ve Yeniden \u0130n\u015fa == Sports == The most notable football clubs of the city are Diyarbak\u0131rspor (established 1968) and Amed SK (established 1990). The women's football team Amed SFK were promoted at the end of the 2016\u201317 Turkish Women's Second Football League season to the Women's First League. ==Politics== In the 2014 local elections, G\u00fcltan K\u0131\u015fanak and F\u0131rat Anl\u0131 of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) were elected co-mayors of Diyarbak\u0131r. However, on 25 October 2016, both were detained by Turkish authorities \"on thinly supported charges of being a member of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)\". The Turkish government ordered a general internet blackout after the arrest. Nevertheless, on 26 October, several thousand demonstrators at Diyarbakir city hall demanded the mayors' release. Some days later, the Turkish government appointed an unelected state trustee as the mayor. In November, public prosecutors demanded a 230-year prison sentence for K\u0131\u015fanak. In January 2017, the Turkish government appointed unelected state trustee ordered the removal of the Assyrian sculpture of a mythological winged bull from the townhall, which had been erected by the BDP mayors to commemorate the Assyrian history of the town and its still resident Assyrian minority. In the Municipal election 2019 Adnan Sel\u00e7uk M\u0131zrakl\u0131 was elected mayor of Diyarbakir In August 2019 he was dismissed accused of supporting terrorism. ==Economy== Historically, Diyarbak\u0131r produced wheat and sesame. They would preserve the wheat in warehouses, with coverings of straw and twigs from licorice trees. This system would allow the wheat to be preserved for up to ten years. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Diyarbak\u0131r exported raisins, almonds, and apricots to Europe. Angora goats were raised, and wool and mohair was exported from Diyarbak\u0131r. Merchants would also come from Egypt, Istanbul, and Syria, to purchase goats and sheep. Honey was also produced, but not so much exported, but used by locals. Sericulture was observed in the area, too. Prior to World War I, Diyarbak\u0131r had an active copper industry, with six mines. Three were active, with two being owned by locals and the third being owned by the Turkish government. Tenorite was the primary type of copper mined. It was mined by hand by Kurds. A large portion of the ore was exported to England. The region also produced iron, gypsum, coal, chalk, lime, jet, and quartz, but primarily for local use. ==Demographics== ===Demographic history=== At the turn of the 19th century, the Christian population of the city was mainly made up of Armenians and Assyrians. The Assyrian and Armenian presence dates to antiquity. There was also a small Jewish community in the city. Konu: Diyarbak\u0131r Tarihi ve Demografik Yap\u0131s\u0131 ====Present day==== According to a November 2006 survey by the S\u00fbr Municipality, 72% of the inhabitants of the municipality use Kurdish most often in their daily speech due to the overwhelming Kurdish majority in the city with small minorities of Assyrians, Armenians, Turks and Yazidis still resident. After World War II, as the Kurdish population moved to urban centres, Diyarbakir's Kurdish population continued to grow. There are also several Alevi Turkmen villages around Diyarbak\u0131r old city, however there are no specific official data about the population numbers. Diyarbak\u0131r Alevi- T\u00fcrkmen k\u00f6yleri ==Culture== Some jewelry making and other craftwork continues today although the fame of the Diyarbak\u0131r's craftsmen has long passed. Folk dancing to the drum and zurna (pipe) are a part of weddings and celebrations in the area. ===Cuisine=== Diyarbak\u0131r is known for rich dishes of lamb which use spices such as black pepper, sumac and coriander; rice, bulgur and butter. The most famous specialty dish from Diyarbak\u0131r is Meftune which is made up of lamb meat and vegetable laced with garlic and sumac. Another known dish is Kaburga Dolmas\u0131 which is a baked lamb's ribs stuffed with rice, almonds and many spices. Diyarbak\u0131r is also known for its watermelons; one of the events in the city is the annually held Watermelon Festival. ==Main sights== Sheikh Matar Mosque with its Four-legged Minaret The core of Diyarbak\u0131r is surrounded by an almost intact, dramatic set of high walls of black basalt forming a circle around the old city. There are four gates into the old city and 82 watch-towers on the walls, which were built in antiquity, restored and extended by the Roman emperor Constantius II in 349. The area inside the walls is known as the Sur district; before its recent demolition and redevelopment this district had 599 registered historical buildings. === Medieval mosques and medreses === * Great Mosque of Diyarbak\u0131r built by the Seljuk Turkish Sultan Malik Shah in the 11th century. The mosque, one of the oldest in Turkey, is constructed in alternating bands of black basalt and white limestone (The same patterning is used in the 16th century Deliler Han Madrassah, which is now a hotel). The adjoining Mesudiye Medresesi/Medreseya Mes\u00fbdiyey\u00ea was built at the same time, as was another prayer-school in the city, Zinciriye Medresesi/Medreseya Zinc\u00eeriyey\u00ea. * Behram Pasha Mosque (Beharampa\u015fa Camii/Mizgefta Behram Pa\u015fa) \u2013 an Ottoman mosque built in 1572 by the governor of Diyarbak\u0131r, Behram Pasha, noted for the well-constructed arches at the entrance. * Sheikh Matar Mosque with D\u00f6rt Ayakl\u0131 Minare/Mizgefta \u00c7arling (the Four-legged Minaret) \u2013 built by Kasim Khan of the Aq Qoyunlu. * Fatihpa\u015fa Camii/Mizgefta Fetih Pa\u015fa \u2013 built in 1520 by Diyarbak\u0131r's first Ottoman governor, B\u0131y\u0131kl\u0131 Mehmet Pa\u015fa (\"the moustachioed Mehmet pasha\").
