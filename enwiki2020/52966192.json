At the age of 12 he was selected to be part of the representative youth team of the province of SAP Kosovo. They finished in first place at the tournament of the Yugoslav republics and provinces held in Borovo and immediately after, Yugoslav youth national team managers, Stevan Viloti\u0107 and Ante Mladini\u0107, called him to the Yugoslav national team to the tournament in Monte Carlo. Immediately upon their return, Stjepan Bobek and Marko Valok, who were coaching at the time FK Galenika Zemun, brought Lala along with his V\u00ebllaznimi teammate \u0110okica Stanojevi\u0107, to the club. Zemun is a suburb of capital Belgrade, and initially Lala had difficulties in adapting since he was coming from a rural area. After six months Lala was already feeling at home. The team was playing well with attractive football displayed by a number of great teammates, and all this was resulting in major enthusiasm and support from the fans. Around mid-1970s, as a player of FK Galenika Zemun, Lala was playing for Yugoslav youth national team at the Monte Carlo tournament in honour of Prince Charles. At that initial period he also played for the National amateur team of Yugoslavia and also the Yugoslav Olympic team. At that time footballers were starting to become real media stars and Lala gradually rose to fame and was considered a local star, especially in Zemun. His great performances with FK Zemun in the Yugoslav First and Second LeaguesStats from Yugoslav First and Second Leagues at zerodic.com made him grow in prominence significantly. At some point, after filming a movie \"Trener\" (translated \"Coach\") in which Lala was an actor, the president of Red Star Belgrade, Dragan D\u017eaji\u0107 along with his associates Branko Stankovi\u0107 and Stevan Ostoji\u0107, spoke with Lala about the possibility of him joining \"the giants\", Red Star. Unfortunately, the transfer was never realised. Then Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107 arranged a move of Simo Nikoli\u0107 and Lala to Olympique Lyonnais, however, Zemun management decided that only one could leave, and they chose Nikoli\u0107 over Lala. During the long period Lala spent at Zemun, he was also at trials in New York to join New York Cosmos but president of the club, Georgije Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, was advised by the coach that Lala was crucial for the club and that they couldn't let him go, so his transfer to Cosmos did not materialise. Lala was part of the generation that took Zemun to the semi-finals of the 1981\u201382 Yugoslav Cup in which they lost against Red Star, but previously eliminating Hajduk Split and also winning against Partizan Belgrade, on their home court, by 2\u20130 with Lala scoring the first goal. All in all, Lala spent his entire senior career at FK Zemun becoming one of club's greatest legends, having played over 350 official matches. His speed, agility, explosiveness, dribbling and general creativity of playing on the field left his fans in awe and inspired many to play football afterwards. After retiring Lala led the youth department of FK Zemun which produced numerous notable players such as Nenad D\u017eodi\u0107, Ilija Stolica, Nenad \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, Mateja Ke\u017eman and many more. He was declared an honorary citizen of Zemun by the Zemun Municipality. ==Personal life== With time, he has dedicated himself more to painting. He married at age 41 to his wife Kimet which he met during holidays in Gjakova, and has two children, a son Eduard and a daughter Edita both born and living in Belgrade, Zemun. ==References== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:People from Gjakova Category:Kosovan footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:KF V\u00ebllaznimi players Category:FK Zemun players Category:Kosovan football managers Category:FK Zemun managers Category:Kosovan expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Libya Category:Expatriate football managers in Oman ",
