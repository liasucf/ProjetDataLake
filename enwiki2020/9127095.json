They became defunct in 1973. ==History== Founded in 1899 as the Bournemouth Gas & Water Co works side and joined the Hampshire League West Division in 1904. In 1921 Bournemouth Gasworks were placed in the County Division (later to become Division One) and this marked the start of a very successful period for 'the Lights' as they were crowned champions in 1922\u201323. The club added the Athletic suffix to their name at this time. The late Twenties saw the side record some fine runs in the FA Amateur Cup, most notably in 1929\u201330 when they reached the final, which was played at West Ham United's Upton Park stadium where a crowd of 21,800 saw them hold Ilford 1\u20131 at the break before they eventually lost by a 1\u20135 scoreline. In 1932\u201333 they reached the Semi-Finals but were narrowly beaten 1\u20132 by Stockton. The Gasworks remained a strong force in county football and were Hampshire League Division One champions a further four times during the Thirties with the reserve side also winning the Division Two title. ==Post war== The post war era saw Bournemouth Gasworks remain a prominent force in the Hampshire League and the cups. During this time they were regular entrants in the FA Cup qualifying rounds and they won the Hampshire Senior Cup in 1952\u201353 and 1953\u201354. In 1956\u201357 the Gasworks were relegated after finishing bottom and after a mid-table finish in Division Two the club left the Hampshire League to play in local Dorset football. They would go on to win the Dorset League nine times, as well as winning the Dorset Senior Cup ten times and the Dorset Amateur Cup nine times. ==Demise== Through circumstances beyond their control, the loss of their magnificent Alder Road home ground in 1972 prompted the club's decision to call it a day after a decline in fortunes.Listed as defunct : Yore.Demon.co.uk personal website (PDF file). The final curtain came down in March 1973 the Club staged a formal Farewell Dinner to commemorative the end of an illustrious history. The event was well attended with a number of legends from the 1930 FA Amateur Cup final team in attendance. ==Honours== *Hampshire League Champions (5) \u2013 1922\u201323, 1931\u201332, 1934\u201335, 1935\u201336, 1937\u201338 *Hampshire Senior Cup Winners (2) \u2013 1952\u201353, 1953\u201354 *Dorset Senior Cup Winners (10) \u2013 1908\u201309, 1909\u201310, 1910\u201311, 1911\u201312, 1913\u201314, 1920\u201321, 1921\u201322, 1924\u201325, 1930\u201331, 1938\u201339 *FA Amateur Cup Runner-up \u2013 1929\u201330 (semi-finalists 1932\u201333) *FA Cup \u2013 Best performance \u2013 3rd Qualifying Round 1946\u201347, 1952\u201353, 1953\u201354 === League Records === {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=text-align:center !Season !Division !Position !Significant events |- |1904/05||Hampshire League West Division||5/9|| |- |1905/06||Hampshire League West Division||7/7|| |- |1906/07||Hampshire League West Division||2/7||Runners-up |- |1907/08||Hampshire League West Division||7/8|| |- |1908/09||Hampshire League West Division||3/7|| |- |1909/10||Hampshire League West Division||2/7||Runners-up |- |1910/11||Hampshire League West Division||2/7||Runners-up |- |1911/12||Hampshire League West Division||3/8|| |- |1912/13||Hampshire League West Division||2/8||Runners-up |- |1913/14||Hampshire League West Division||2/9||Runners-up |- |1914\u201319|| || || |- |1919/20||Hampshire League West Division||6/8|| |- |1920/21||Hampshire League West Division||4/10|| Promoted |- |1921/22||Hampshire League County Division||7/16|| |- |1922/23||Hampshire League County Division||1/17||Champions, promoted |- |1923/24||Hampshire League County Division||7/16|| |- |1924/25||Hampshire League County Division||8/16|| |- |1925/26||Hampshire League County Division||7/16|| |- |1926/27||Hampshire League County Division||6/16|| |- |1927/28||Hampshire League County Division||4/16||Re-organisation |- |1928/29||Hampshire League South Division||4/13||Re-organisation |- |1929/30||Hampshire League Division 1||5/16|| |- |1930/31||Hampshire League Division 1||5/16|| |- |1931/32||Hampshire League Division 1||1/16||Champions |- |1932/33||Hampshire League Division 1||3/15|| |- |1933/34||Hampshire League Division 1||3/16|| |- |1934/35||Hampshire League Division 1||1/16||Champions (Reserves runners-up in Division 2) |- |1935/36||Hampshire League Division 1||1/16||Champions (Reserves champions of Division 2) |- |1936/37||Hampshire League Division 1||2/16||Runners-up |- |1937/38||Hampshire League Division 1||1/16||Champions |- |1938/39||Hampshire League Division 1||3/16|| |- |1939\u201345|| || || |- |1945/46||Hampshire League Division 1||7/16|| |- |1946/47||Hampshire League Division 1||5/14|| (Reserves champions of Division 3) |- |1947/48||Hampshire League Division 1||6/14|| |- |1948/49||Hampshire League Division 1||2/14||Runners-up |- |1949/50||Hampshire League Division 1||6/14|| |- |1950/51||Hampshire League Division 1||7/14|| |- |1951/52||Hampshire League Division 1||7/14|| |- |1952/53||Hampshire League Division 1||3/14|| |- |1953/54||Hampshire League Division 1||3/14|| |- |1954/55||Hampshire League Division 1||12/14|| |- |1955/56||Hampshire League Division 1||12/14|| |- |1956/57||Hampshire League Division 1||14/14||Relegated |- |1957/58||Hampshire League Division 2||6/16||Left competition |- |1958\u201372||Club played in Dorset Senior League || || |} ==References== ===Print=== *Gone But Not Forgotten (Part 5), by Dave Twydell, ===Internet=== ==External links== * Football Club History Database profile of Bournemouth Gasworks Athletic F.C. * 2009 Reunion Article Category:Sport in Bournemouth Category:Defunct football clubs in England Category:Association football clubs established in 1899 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1973 Category:Defunct football clubs in Hampshire Category:1899 establishments in England Category:1973 disestablishments in England Category:Works association football teams in England ",
