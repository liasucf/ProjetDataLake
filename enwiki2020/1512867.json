    "text": "The Third Generation of Postwar Writers (\u7b2c\u4e09\u306e\u65b0\u4eba, daisan no shinjin) is a classification in Modern Japanese literature used to group writers who appeared on the postwar literary scene between 1953 and 1955. Sh\u016bsaku End\u014d, a member of the Third Generation once said, \"In those days, although we had received the Akutagawa Prize one after another, hardly did anyone expect that we would become great writers. We were regarded as if we would soon be forgotten by the literary world. Precisely, almost all people did not start to know Akutagawa Prize until Ishihara Shintaro had won the prize and surfed away mass media and provoked public opinion into asunder, as the first manifesto from one of the Postwar Generation.\" However, despite this, this generation has made a major mark on Japanese literature. The works of End\u014d in particularly have been translated into many languages and are widely read in the United States, France, and Germany. At that same time, women writers such as Aya K\u014dda (\u5e78\u7530\u6587), Minako Oba, and Sawako Ariyoshi also made their debuts. After this generation, predominant and various writers like Shintaro Ishihara, Morio Kita, and Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce appeared. ==List== * Sh\u016bsaku End\u014d (\u9060\u85e4\u5468\u4f5c) * Sh\u014dtar\u014d Yasuoka (\u5b89\u5ca1\u7ae0\u592a\u90ce) * Junnosuke Yoshiyuki (\u5409\u884c\u6df3\u4e4b\u4ecb\uff09 * Junzo Shono (\u5e84\u91ce\u6f64\u4e09) * Shumon Miura (\u4e09\u6d66\u6731\u9580) * Ayako Sono (\u66fd\u91ce\u7dbe\u5b50) * Hiroyuki Agawa (\u963f\u5ddd\u5f18\u4e4b) * Kojima Nobuo (\u5c0f\u5cf6\u4fe1\u592b) ==See also== * Japanese literature * The First Generation of Postwar Writers * The Second Generation of Postwar Writers Category:Japanese literature Category:Literary circles Category:1950s in Japan ",
