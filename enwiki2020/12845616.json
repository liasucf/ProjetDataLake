Other sections within the association include badminton, basketball, fencing, Judo, canoeing, Karate, athletics, rhythmic gymnastics, table tennis, and volleyball. == History == === TuS Eintracht 1848 Dortmund === The club has its origins as the gymnastics club Turnverein Eintracht Dortmund, founded on 15 July 1848, which grew into a broadly based sports association in the interwar period.Gr\u00fcne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag Future merger partner Dortmunder SC 1895 established a field hockey section in 1921 which left to join Dortmunder Tennis Club 1898 to create Dortmunder Tennis und Hockey Club, known today as Dortmunder Tennis Klub Rot-Weiss 98. A field hockey section was formed within TVE in 1926 and has played as Dortmunder Hockey-Club der Eintracht since 1954. Through the late 50s and into the mid 60s the club supported an ice hockey section that played in first and second-level competition. In 1965 the section withdrew from the association to become part of Eishockey Club Westphalia Dortmund. === Dortmunder SC 95 === Predecessor side Dortmunder SC 1895 was established on 10 May 1895 as Dortmunder Fussball Club 1895 and is recognized as the city's oldest football club. The team folded in 1897, but was re-formed on 27 October 1899. It was joined by Fussball Club Union Dortmund in 1910 and on 13 July 1913 merged with Ballspielverein 1904 Dortmund to become Sportvereinigung Dortmund 1895 before first adopting the name Dortmunder Sport Club 1895 in 1919. This combined side made an appearance in the top flight regional playoff round in 1920\u201321. In 1933, SC briefly merged with Ballspiel Club Sportfreunde 06 Dortmund to play as Sportfreunde 1895 Dortmund in the Gauliga Westfalen, one of sixteen top flight divisions formed that year in the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich. The team was relegated after just one season of play there and in 1935 the union ended with the two clubs going their separate ways. Following World War II most organizations in the country, including sports and football clubs, were ordered dissolved by occupying Allied authorities. The club was re-established in 1945 as S\u00fcdliche Sportgruppe Dortmund and by 1947 was once again playing as SC. The team played lower tier local football until advancing to the Landesliga Westfalen (III) in 1953. They claimed a title there in 1956 and were promoted to the 2. Liga-West (II) where they competed as a lower table side over the next 7 seasons. Restructuring of the country's football competition placed SC into the third division Amateurliga Westfalen in 1963. The club finished atop their group within the division, but missed an opportunity to be advance when they were beaten by Eintracht Gelsenkirchen (2:2, 1:1, 0:2) in an extended promotion playoff. The following season the club tumbled from first to fifteenth place and was relegated to the Landesliga Westfalen (IV) where they earned lower-to-mid table results over the next handful of seasons. After the 1969 merger the football tradition of SC was carried on by Eintracht Dortmund. However, the team stumbled and was sent down to fifth tier competition in 1970. The footballers currently compete in the Bezirksliga (VIII). == References == == External links == * Official team site * Das deutsche Fu\u00dfball-Archiv historical German domestic league tables (in German) Category:Football clubs in Germany Category:Football clubs in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Field hockey clubs in Germany Category:Association football clubs established in 1969 Category:Field hockey clubs established in 1895 Category:Dortmund Category:1895 establishments in Germany ",
