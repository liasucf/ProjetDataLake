    "text": "On 17 July 2016, a group of armed men calling themselves the Daredevils of Sasun ( Sasna Tsrrer; the name is taken from an epic poem) stormed a police station in Yerevan, Armenia, and took nine hostages. They demanded the release of opposition leader Jirair Sefilian, and the resignation of President Serzh Sargsyan. The group began a standoff with government forces, with growing crowds of protesters joining the calls for the resignation of the president. In a 2017 survey the 38% of respondents supported Sasna Tsrer's actions, while 16% condemned. ==Background== A controversial election occurred in 2013 which led to a loss of popularity for the governing Republican Party of Armenia. The Lebanese-born ethnic Armenian Jirair Sefilian led opposing forces under the formation New Armenia Public Salvation Front. Sefilian was arrested in 2006 on charges of calling for \"a violent overthrow of the government\" and was jailed for 18 months. He was then released in 2008. In 2015, he and several of his supporters were arrested again on suspicion of preparing a coup, but released shortly afterwards. On 20 June 2016, Sefilian was arrested yet again. According to the Armenian Special Investigation Service, Sefilian and a group of people planned to seize buildings and communication facilities, including the Yerevan TV tower. When Sefilian was formally charged with acquiring and possessing weapons when he appeared in court, the allegations of plotting a coup were dropped. Varuzhan Avetisian, a future Sasna Tsrer member, claimed that the opposition leader was arrested because he planned to campaign against Armenian territorial concessions to Azerbaijan. Tensions in the country have also been running high over Russian mediation attempts following the aftermath of the 2016 Armenian\u2013Azerbaijani clashes. With the Kremlin suggesting to give some land back to Azerbaijan and in turn allow the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic to receive international recognition. ==Hostage taking== The Daredevils of Sassoun took over the Ereubuni police station in Yerevan around 5:30 a.m. on July 17, 2016. The armed group drove a vehicle through the front door of the police station. One policeman was killed and at least two were injured (one of them died in hospital in 13 August). Nine people were taken hostage. Two policemen were released following negotiations. General Vitaly Balasanyan, a mediator between the government and the opposition, said those released were Yerevan's deputy police chief Valery Osipyan and national deputy police chief Vardan Yeghiazaryan. Throughout the day Facebook was inaccessible and the websites of media outlets reporting on developments were being shut down. On July 21, after releasing two hostages, the gunmen still held onto four hostages total. These hostages included: General Major Vardan Egiazaryan, the deputy head of the Armenian police force, and Colonel Valeri Osipyan, the deputy chief of Yerevan\u2019s municipal police force. During the siege two of the armed men had sustained injuries On July 22, President Serzh Sargsyan addressed the nation and said, \" I urge the armed people, who have occupied the territory of the police headquarters, to show restraint and not endanger the lives of others with their reckless moves. Hostages must be released,\u201d and also added that the armed group must also surrender their weapons. The same day, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation-Supreme Body of Armenia condemned the acts of Sasna Tsrer by stating, \"The A.R.F.-Dashnaktsutyun seeks the settlement of the current situation exclusively by peaceful means, considers new bloodshed as unacceptable, demands professionalism from law enforcing agencies, demands that the rights and dignity of law-abiding citizens be respected, and strongly condemns non-political methods and extremist thinking.\" On 23 July, there were indications the standoff was over. Four officers were set free, which included Vartan Yeghiazarian and Valeri Osipinian. During negotiations, Armenian law enforcement allowed Sasna Tsrer to speak with journalists in a designated neutral zone around the occupied police station. Approximately 40 reporters held a news conference but were not allowed to hold a live broadcast. At the news conference, Pavlik Manukyan stated that the police department has become evil for the people and enjoy lavish life styles with the use of unnecessary military equipment for policing. On 25 July, the gunmen had set a police vehicle on fire inside the headquarters, according to police spokesman Ashot Aharonian. It was the third vehicle to have been burned in two days. On July 27, 4 medics were allowed to enter the police station to treat Araik Handonyan, one of the armed men who was wounded in the leg but refused to go to the hospital. On July 30, the police issued an ultimatum to release all hostages and vacate the building or prepare for a police assault. Sasna Tsrer opened fire and shot down another officer. The group eventually surrendered that day to avoid further bloodshed. After surrendering, the group issued a statement saying, \"We will continue our struggle from prison. We believe that we have achieved our goal: we became the spark that allowed people to rise up and it makes no sense to spill blood.\" Demonstrators chose to march down Baghramyan Avenue towards the presidential residence and government buildings but were met with police, who placed coils of barbed wire across the avenue to stop the protests. Demonstrators still managed to block traffic for two hours and eventually dispersed the following day. ==Solidarity== Over 1,500 anti-government protesters held a rally in Yerevan on 18 July, calling for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. Violent protests also occurred where opposition supporters threw stones at police outside the hostage situation. They were hit back with tear gas and stun grenades. On 25 July, in a large show of support, thousands of protesters marched in Yerevan chanting \"unity\" and called for bystanders to join them\u2014who swelled their numbers\u2014as the march progressed toward Yerevan\u2019s central Republic Square.
