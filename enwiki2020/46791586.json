Tobin, one of the city's most prominent residents. ==History== The 1738-seat venue was first built in 1926 as the San Antonio Municipal Auditorium by Atlee Ayres. In 2014, it was renovated and expanded by the Seattle-based LMN Architects and the local firm Marmon Mok Architecture. During the 2008 presidential election campaign, Barack Obama gave a speech in front of the building to his supporters. On October 2, 2014, Sir Paul McCartney performed a special benefit concert for the Tobin Center. ==Performance and other venues== ===H-E-B Performance Hall=== This 1738-seat theater at the core of the center was designed to accommodate both acoustic and amplified performances with the specific intent of being the home to the San Antonio Symphony, Opera San Antonio, and Ballet San Antonio. Seating is on four levels -- orchestra, grand tier boxes, mezzanine, and balcony. ===Carlos Alvarez Studio Theater=== Built as a \"black box theater,\" the hexagon shaped space is a unique venue that offers a blank canvas customizable for any event. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Theatres in San Antonio Category:Cinemas and movie theaters in Texas Category:Theatres completed in 2014 Category:2014 establishments in Texas ",
