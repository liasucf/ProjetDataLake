However, by the 1996 elections he had established the MNR. In the elections the party won two of the seven seats in the Legislative Council. Although the People's Progressive Alliance (PPA) had received the most votes, the MNR formed a coalition government with the National Progressive Party and an independent MP, with Osborne as Chief Minister. In 2001 the party merged with the PPA to create the New People's Liberation Movement prior to the elections that year.People's Progressive Alliance (PPA) Caribbean Elections ==References== Category:Defunct political parties in Montserrat Category:Political parties disestablished in 2001 Category:2001 disestablishments in Montserrat ",
