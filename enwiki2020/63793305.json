Buckskins were members of the Class A-Short Season Northwest League for a single season in 1978. ==History== Boise went without professional baseball in 1977 following the departure of the Boise A's to Medicine Hat. Lanny Moss, who had gained notoriety as the 27-year-old female general manager of the Portland Mavericks was awarded ownership of an expansion franchise in the Northwest League. Without an affiliation with a major league team the Buckskins operated as an independent. In a unique financially strategy, Moss attempted a sponsorship program. Rather than sponsoring the Buckskins club, businesses and community members would sponsor individual players for $3000. The sponsorship concept was based on a roster of roughly twenty players. The Buckskins debuted against the Salem Senators and recorded the franchise\u2019s first win in an 11-3 victory. Unfortunately most of the headlines made by the Buckskins weren\u2019t related to their on field performance. Manger Gerry Craft gained national media attention regarding divine guidance that prompted him to release a player. Moreover, the Bucks added former Brewer and the sixth overall draftee from 1972, Danny Thomas to their roster. Thomas, earned the nickname \"Sundown Kid\" as he refused to play from sundown friday to sundown saturday in adherence with his religious beliefs, which ended his career with the Brewers. In fifty-four games Thomas led the with 11 home runs and an average of .359, but quit before the end of the season after not receiving his paycheck. By the final weeks of the season the Buckskins were playing without pay as low attendance severely impacted the club's finances. Boise finished the year last in the league with a record of 23-49. The team was plagued by low attendance and a player sponsorship plan that field to meet projections. Despite the club being on the verge of bankruptcy, Moss was determined to return the following season. Ultimately the franchise ceased operations. The City of Trees would be absent professional baseball until the arrival of the Boise Hawks in 1987. ==Ballpark== The Buckskins played their home games at Bill Wigle Field, which is located on the campus of Borah High School. The ballpark is still in use today. ==Season-by-season record== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; font-size:95%\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Season !scope=\"col\"|PDC !scope=\"col\"|Division !scope=\"col\"|Finish !scope=\"col\"|Wins !scope=\"col\"|Losses !scope=\"col\"|Win% !scope=\"col\"|Post-season !scope=\"col\"|Manager !scope=\"col\"|Attendance |- |align=\"center\" colspan=\"11\" style=\"background: #473729; color: white; border:2px solid #FFFFFF|Boise Buckskins |- |1978 | |South |3rd |23 |49 |.319 | |Gerry Craft |23,126 |} ==References== ==External links== *Stats Crew Boise Buckskins Category:Defunct Northwest League teams Category:Defunct baseball teams in Idaho ",
