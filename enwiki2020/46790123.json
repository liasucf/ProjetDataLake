    "text": "The Philippines competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 5 to 21 August 2016. Since the nation's official debut in 1924, Filipino athletes had appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, but did not attend the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the nation's partial support for the US-led boycott. The Philippine Olympic Committee fielded a team of 13 athletes, seven men and six women, to compete in eight different sports at the Games. Although its full roster was roughly larger by two athletes than in 2012, this was still one of the Philippines' smallest delegations sent to the Olympics. Among the sports represented by the nation's athletes, the Philippines marked its Olympic debut in golf (new to the 2016 Games) and table tennis, as well as its return to taekwondo after an eight- year absence. The Philippine delegation featured four returning Olympians, with only two of them headed to their third straight Games: 35-year-old long jumper Marestella Torres (the oldest competitor of the team), and world-ranked weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz. The remaining returnees on the Philippine roster were swimmers Jessie Lacuna and Jasmine Alkhaldi, who both competed at their maiden Games in London four years earlier. Meanwhile, nine Filipino athletes made their Olympic debut in Rio de Janeiro, including table tennis player Ian Lariba, who was appointed by the committee as the flag bearer for the country's delegation in the opening ceremony. The Philippines left Rio de Janeiro with a historic silver-medal feat from Diaz in the women's 53 kg category, ending the nation's twenty-year-old drought on the podium. ==Background== The Philippine Olympic delegation posing with President Rodrigo Duterte at the Malaca\u00f1ang Palace. POC 1st Vice President and Larong Volleyball sa Pilipinas, Inc. president Joey Romasanta, was named as the Philippine delegation's chef de mission for the Olympics. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, PSC Chairman Butch Ramirez, POC President Peping Cojuangco, Romasanta, and other sports officials, led a send-off ceremony for the athletes that will compete in the Rio Olympics. The ceremony was held at the Malaca\u00f1ang Palace on 18 July 2016. Six athletes from weightlifting, taekwondo, table tennis, golf, swimming and athletics attended, while the rest were absent from the send-off because they were outside the country preparing for the Games. President Duterte said that the cash allowances of athletes would be increased from $1,000 to $3,000 while those of sports officials, coaches and trainers would rise from $3,000 to $5,000. He will also give financial support to the Philippine athletes by giving money from unpaid tax collections from the oligarchy and tax evaders. Table tennis player Ian Lariba, was named as the Philippine delegation's flagbearer for the Rio Olympic opening ceremony. The 16-man Philippine delegation, which composed of six athletes, coaches and officials led by Romasanta and POC 2nd Vice President Jeff Tamayo flew to Rio de Janeiro on 23 July 2016. The Philippine flag was hoisted in the Athletes Village on 3 August 2016, signifying the entry of the Philippine contingent in the 2016 Summer Olympics. The Philippine Olympic Committee has partnered with Asics (Sonak Trading) as the official apparel outfitter of the Philippine delegation in the Olympics. ===Opening ceremony=== The Philippines was the seventy-fifth country (based in the Portuguese language) to walk in the parade of nations rites during the opening ceremonies of the 2016 Summer Olympics on 5 August 2016. Table tennis player Ian Lariba, was named as the Philippine delegation's flagbearer for the Rio Olympic opening ceremony.
