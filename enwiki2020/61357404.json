Music Singappenney starts with drums music over guitar tunes, veteran musician Keba Jeremiah played his masterpiece. A.R. Rahman begins well with the percussions dominating the composition, which lends it the perfect baseline. The mix of drums, percussion beats and the composer's signature piano set the tune for Rahman's vocals to follow. The composer delivers a good song that is both moving, hip, and catchy in its rhythm and structure. Voice Rahman dominates the song with his high pitched intonation, with Shashaa Tirupati joining in later. The latter gets only a few verses of melody that mark a subtle shift, but it is Rahman that controls the tempo of the whole composition. Like Some other music composers, Rahman can sing too, he used all his energy & perfection to sing Singappenney. Lyrics Vivek's lyrics, set in fairly chaste Tamil, add to the magic.
