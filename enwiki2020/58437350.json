It was played at the Derngate in Northampton and held between 1 and 13 December 1987 with the tournament televised on ITV. Foster's became the sponsors for this tournament as part of the Courage Group as was previous sponsor Hofmeister. Steve Davis and Tony Meo lost out in the first round and the only time they failed to make the last 16 in the history of the World Doubles. Last year's finalists Mike Hallett and Stephen Hendry went of to win the final World Doubles beating Cliff Thorburn and Dennis Taylor 12\u20136 and as most of the champions of the tournament, they got the highest combined break of 182.
