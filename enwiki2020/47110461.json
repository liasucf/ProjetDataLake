They are best known for their work on a number of large-scale public concrete murals during the 1960s and 1970s, many of which remain around the UK today. Their mural work often included elements relating to the cultural and industrial heritage of the location they were sited and is part of a tradition of muralists that includes William Mitchell and Kenneth Budd amongst others. Henry Collins and Joyce Pallot were both prominent members of the Colchester Art Society and exhibited together on a number of occasions. ==Henry Collins== Henry Collins was an artist and designer born in Colchester in 1910. He was the son of Henry Percy Collins and his wife Mary n\u00e9e Beagley. He studied at the Colchester School of Art and the Central School, London.

The artists also collaborated on a number of public concrete murals which they signed collectively as \u2018Henry and Joyce Collins'. ==Concrete Murals by Henry and Joyce Collins== Concrete mural sculpture by Henry and Joyce Collins, on the wall of Sainsburys, Bexhill Well known works by Henry and Joyce Collins include a series of concrete murals they completed together. These murals can be seen in their hometown of Colchester, Essex in the St Botolph\u2019s Circus underpass; the Crouch Street underpass; and on the fa\u00e7ade of the Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket in Priory Walk. In April 2012, Firstsite funded a project to restore and relocate a series of three reliefs to 15 Queen Street, Colchester. These works by Henry and Joyce Collins were completed for the fa\u00e7ade of the British Home Stores, Colchester in 1976 and were previously installed in the Lion Walk Shopping Centre until its redevelopment in 2009. Other concrete murals by Henry and Joyce Collins can be seen in other locations in the UK including a mural in Hamtun Street, Southampton which narrates the history of the city; the Stockport British Home Stores also depicting the history of the city; Newcastle Through the Ages (1974) located on the Primark in Newcastle; and Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket, Burkhurst Place, Bexhill-on-sea. These works are an example of Post-war mural art that was popularised following the Festival of Britain in 1951. The early process Pallot and Collins used to make these concrete murals included the use of plastic moulds. The relief was made in reverse and then poured concrete was put into the moulds. The moulds themselves would then be broken in order to remove the concrete mural.Mason, E.2012 Henry Collins and Joyce Pallot. C20 Magazine/Winter 2012 pp22-23 Later the couple would go on to use wooden moulds with a releasing agent which meant that moulds could be re-used.Wood, K. 2012 Henry Collins and Joyce Pallot. C20 Magazine/Winter 2012 pp24-25 Pallot and Collins would often extensively research the history of an area before starting a mural and would often allude to the city's history in the mural itself including references to important local figures and events.Wood, K. 2012 Henry Collins and Joyce Pallot. C20 Magazine/Winter 2012 pp24-25 According to the Twentieth Century Society, as many as one thousand murals were made between the end of the Second World War and the 1980s in the UK and were a product of the post war building boom. The Twentieth Century Society has launched a campaign to preserve some of these murals, as some have been destroyed in the redevelopment of cities in UK such as the 2008 destruction of a mural by Ray Howard-Jones in Cardiff and another by Mitzi Cunliffe in Sunderland. ==References== Category:Modern sculptors Category:English muralists Category:20th-century British sculptors Category:20th-century British painters ",
