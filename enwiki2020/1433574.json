She was the female soprano vocalist in Cradle of Filth for 14 years and also fronts her own band, Angtoria. In 2009, Deva started her self-titled solo project. The debut album A Sign of Sublime was released in February 2010. Her second album, called The Corruption of Mercy, was released on 27 June 2011 under a new three album record deal with Listenable Records. ==Career== Deva was raised in East Ham, London and has two half sisters and three half brothers. She had a troubled and turbulent childhood, leaving home when she was nine years old. Her godmother influenced her life greatly, getting her on the path to music. Deva's career started at the age of eleven at the Queen's Theatre, Hornchurch, Essex. A cover of Ella Fitzgerald's \"Summertime\" was her first performance in a live band and totally unrehearsed, she performed one more time there at the age of thirteen. Deva went on to write her own lyrics and later recorded a demo on her friend's 8-track console. Her first band was called Mad Dog, a punk group in which she was co-vocalist. She only did one show with the band, in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, supporting legendary punk band 999. Paul Allender and Dani Filth, founders of extreme metal band Cradle of Filth, would later meet Deva through mutual friends. After leaving Cradle of Filth in 2009, Deva started her self-titled solo project with Ken Newman and signed a deal with a small British record company. A Sign of Sublime was released on 15 February 2010. A European and UK tour followed inclusive of a performance at Femme Metal Festival. After various issues with the label, Deva left the record company and joined forces with Dan Abela, a musician and producer. Together, they co-wrote The Corruption of Mercy after signing a three-album record deal with Listenable Records in March 2011. ==Discography== ;Solo career * A Sign of Sublime (2010) * The Corruption of Mercy (2011) * Malediction (EP) (2012) ;Mad Dog * Howling at the Moon (1993) ;With Cradle of Filth * V Empire or Dark Faerytales in Phallustein (1996) * Dusk... and Her Embrace (1996) * Cruelty and the Beast (1998) * From the Cradle to Enslave (1999) * Midian (2000) * Bitter Suites to Succubi (2001) * Heavy, Left-Handed and Candid (2001) * Lovecraft & Witch Hearts (2002) * Live Bait for the Dead (2002) * Damnation and a Day (2003) * Nymphetamine (2004) * Peace Through Superior Firepower (2005) * Thornography (2006) * Godspeed on the Devil's Thunder (2008) * Midnight in the Labyrinth (2012) ;With Creation's Tears * Methods to End It All (2010) ;With The Kovenant * Nexus Polaris (1998) ;With Tulus * Mysterion (1997) ;With Therion * Vovin (1998) * Crowning of Atlantis (1999) * Live in Midg\u00e5rd (2002) * Celebrators of Becoming (2006) ;With Graveworm * Underneath the Crescent Moon (1998) ;With Mortiis * The Stargate (1998) * The Smell of Rain (2001) ;With Mystic Circle * Infernal Satanic Verses (1999) ;With The Gathering * Black Light District (2002) ;With Mendeed * From Shadows Came Darkness (2004) ;Angtoria * God Has a Plan for Us All (2006) ;Trigger the Bloodshed *Purgation (2008) ;Hecate Enthroned *Virulent Rapture (2013) *Embrace of the Godless Aeon (2019) ;Various artists * Emerald / A Tribute to the Wild One (Thin Lizzy tribute) (2003) (\"Southbound\" with Therion) * The Lotus Eaters (Dead Can Dance tribute) (2004) (\"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\") ==References== == External links == * Sarah Jezebel Deva site, at Internet Archive Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Cradle of Filth members Category:English female singers Category:English heavy metal singers Category:Female heavy metal singers Category:People from Forest Gate Category:Therion (band) members Category:The Kovenant members Category:Listenable Records artists ",
