    "text": "At Home is the second album by the rock band, Shocking Blue. It was released in 1969 on the Pink Elephant label. The album is the debut for Mariska Veres. ==Background== This is the group's first record with singer Mariska Veres. Robbie van Leeuwen acquired Veres in an attempt to ape the form of the female- fronted Jefferson Airplane. With Veres's notable vocal performance and stunning looks, the band finally had an adequate frontwoman.http://www.scrammagazine.com/shockingblue The band's second album was a mixture of influences ranging from pop rock to psychedelic rock. There is also early evidence of their interest in Americana, with tracks like \"California Here I Come\" and \"Harley Davidson\".http://www.allmusic.com/album/at-home-mw0000455808 Overall, it is best known for its hit single \"Venus\" which reached number one on the American national charts.
