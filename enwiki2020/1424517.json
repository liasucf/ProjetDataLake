    "text": "The \u02bcPhags-pa script is an alphabet designed by the Tibetan monk and State Preceptor (later Imperial Preceptor) Drog\u00f6n Ch\u00f6gyal Phagpa for Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty, as a unified script for the written languages within the Yuan. The actual use of this script was limited to about a hundred years during the Mongol Yuan dynasty, and it fell out of use with the advent of the Ming dynasty. It was used to write and transcribe varieties of Chinese, the Tibetic languages, Mongolian, the Uyghur language, Sanskrit, Persian, and other neighboring languages during the Yuan era. For historical linguists, the documentation of its use provides clues about the changes in these languages. Its descendant systems include Horizontal square script, used to write Tibetan and Sanskrit. There is a theory that the Korean Hangul alphabet was also partly inspired by \u02bcPhags-pa (see Origin of Hangul). During the Pax Mongolica the script has even made numerous appearances in western medieval art. == Nomenclature == \u02bcPhags-pa script: mongxol tshi, \"Mongolian script\"; d\u00f6rv\u00f6ljin \u00fcseg, \"square script\"; \"new Mongolian script\"; Yuan dynasty \"new Mongolian script\"; Modern \"\u02bcPhags-pa script\" == History == During the Mongol Empire, the Mongols wanted a universal script to write down the languages of the people they subjugated. The Uyghur-based Mongolian alphabet is not a perfect fit for the Middle Mongol language, and it would be impractical to extend it to a language with a very different phonology like Chinese. Therefore, during the Yuan dynasty (c. 1269), Kublai Khan asked the Tibetan monk \u02bcPhags-pa to design a new alphabet for use by the whole empire. \u02bcPhags-pa extended his native Tibetan alphabet to encompass Mongol and Chinese, evidently Central Plains Mandarin. p. 31. The resulting 38 letters have been known by several descriptive names, such as \"square script\" based on their shape, but today are primarily known as the \u02bcPhags-pa alphabet. Descending from Tibetan script it is part of the Brahmic family of scripts, which includes Devanagari and scripts used throughout Southeast Asia and Central Asia. It is unique among Brahmic scripts in that it is written top bottom, like how Chinese used to be written; and like the Manchu alphabet or later Mongolian alphabet. Despite its origin, the script was written vertically (top to bottom) like the previous Mongolian scripts. It did not receive wide acceptance and was not a popular script even among the elite Mongols themselves, although it was used as an official script of the Yuan dynasty until the early 1350sStrange Names of God: The Missionary Translation of the Divine Name and the Chinese Responses to Matteo Ricci's \"Shangti\" in Late Ming China, 1583-1644, by Sangkeun Kim, p139 when the Red Turban Rebellion started. After this it was mainly used as a phonetic gloss for Mongolians learning Chinese characters. It was also used as one of the scripts on Tibetan currency in the twentieth century, as script for Tibetan seal inscriptions from the Middle Ages up to the 20th century and for inscriptions on the entrance doors of Tibetan monasteries. == Syllable formation == Although it is an alphabet, phagspa is written like a syllabary or abugida, with letters forming a single syllable glued or 'ligated' together. Unlike the ancestral Tibetan script, all \u02bcPhags-pa letters are written in temporal order (that is, /CV/ is written in the order C\u2013V for all vowels) and in-line (that is, the vowels are not diacritics). However, vowel letters retain distinct initial forms, and short /a/ is not written except initially, making \u02bcPhags-pa transitional between an abugida, a syllabary, and a full alphabet. The letters of a \u02bcPhags-pa syllable are linked together so that they form syllabic blocks. == Typographic forms == \u02bcPhags-pa was written in a variety of graphic forms. The standard form (top, at right) was blocky, but a \"Tibetan\" form (bottom) was even more so, consisting almost entirely of straight orthogonal lines and right angles. A \"seal script\" form (Chinese \u8499\u53e4\u7bc6\u5b57 m\u011bngg\u01d4 zhu\u00e0nz\u00ec \"Mongolian Seal Script\"), used for imperial seals and the like, was more elaborate, with squared sinusoidal lines and spirals. Korean records state that hangul was based on an \"Old Seal Script\" (\u53e4\u7bc6\u5b57), which may be \u02bcPhags-pa and a reference to its Chinese name \u8499\u53e4\u7bc6\u5b57 m\u011bngg\u01d4 zhu\u00e0nz\u00ec (see origin of hangul). However, it is the simpler standard form of \u02bcPhags-pa that is the closer graphic match to hangul. == Letters == Following are the initials of the \u02bcPhags-pa script as presented in Menggu Ziyun.
