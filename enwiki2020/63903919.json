    "text": "Horatio Samuel Hildyard (17 October 1805 \u2013 10 April 1886) was an English first-class cricketer and clergyman. The son of The Reverend William Hildyard, he was born in October 1805 at Winestead, Yorkshire. He was educated at Shrewsbury School, before going up to Peterhouse, Cambridge in 1826. He was elected a fellow in 1831, and while he was a visiting fellow at the University of Oxford, Hildyard played two first-class cricket matches for Oxford University in 1832, both against the Marylebone Cricket Club. Hildyard took holy orders in the Church of England and was ordained in June 1832 as a priest at Rochester, a post he held for just under a year until he was transferred to Carlisle in 1833. He became the curate of Little Wilbraham in Cambridgeshire from 1834\u201342, during which time he was also a classics lecturer at the University of Cambridge. He became a rector at Loftus in North Yorkshire from 1842 until his death there in April 1886. His brother was the scholar James Hildyard. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1805 births Category:1886 deaths Category:People from Holderness Category:People educated at Shrewsbury School Category:Alumni of Peterhouse, Cambridge Category:Fellows of Peterhouse, Cambridge Category:English cricketers Category:Oxford University cricketers Category:19th-century English Anglican priests Category:Lecturers ",
