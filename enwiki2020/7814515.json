In 1018, King Olof's cousin, Ragnvald Ulfsson, the earl of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland, and the King Olaf's emissaries Bj\u00f6rn Stallare and Hjalti Skeggiason arrived at the thing of Uppsala in an attempt to sway the Swedish king to accept peace and as a warrant marry his daughter Ingegerd Olofsdotter to the king of Norway. However, King Olof would not allow the marriage of his daughter to occur. Ingegerd later became the consort of Yaroslav I the Wise of Kiev.Ragnvald Ulfsson (Store norske leksikon)Hjalte Skeggjason (Store norske leksikon)Astrid Olavsdatter \u2013 utdypning (Store norske leksikon) King Olaf of Norway and King Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung later agreed to a peace treaty at Kungah\u00e4lla ca 1020. King Olof was forced to accept a settlement with King Olaf, who already had been married with King Olof's daughter, Astrid Olofsdotter, through the efforts of Ragnvald Ulfsson. Ragnvald had delivered Astrid at Sarpsborg in Norway and she married King Olaf after Christmas of 1019. Bj\u00f8rn Stallare was long one of King Olaf's closest adviser. However, in 1026 King Olaf lost the Battle of the Helge\u00e5, and the Norwegian nobles rallied round the invading King Cnut the Great of Denmark, forcing King Olaf to flee the country. Bj\u00f6rn subsequently entered into an alliance with the King Canute. Later Bj\u00f6rn was reconciled with King Olaf. Reportedly Bj\u00f6rn supported King Olaf's return to Norway and is believed to have died with him in 1030 at the Battle of Stiklestad (slaget p\u00e5 Stiklestad). During the World War II, Arne Skouen adopted Bj\u00f8rn Stallare as a pseudonym writing about occupied Oslo. ==Sources== King Olaf's betrothal to Ingegerd is described in both Fagrskinna and in Heimskringla. ==References== Category:Vikings killed in battle Category:11th-century Norwegian people Category:1030 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ",
