    "text": "Alexandra \"Sandra\" Chick (born 2 June 1947) is a former field hockey player from Zimbabwe, who was a member of the national team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Her identical twin sister Sonia Robertson was one of her teammates in the capital of the Soviet Union, and both are the first twin gold medalists in hockey. Because of the boycott of the United States and other countries, only one team was available to compete in the women's field hockey tournament: the hosting USSR team. A late request was sent to the government of the African nation, which quickly assembled a team less than a week before the competition started. To everyone's surprise they won, claiming Zimbabwe's only medal in the 1980 Games. ==References== *sports-reference Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:People from Burnham Market Category:British emigrants to Rhodesia Category:Zimbabwean female field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Zimbabwe Category:Field hockey players at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for Zimbabwe Category:Olympic medalists in field hockey Category:Medalists at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Twin people from Zimbabwe Category:Twin sportspeople Category:Zimbabwean people of English descent Category:White Zimbabwean sportspeople ",
