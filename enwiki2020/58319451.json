    "text": "Vermont's state Senate consists of 30 members elected from 13 single or multi- member districts provided for in the redistricting and reapportionment plan developed by the Vermont General Assembly following the 2010 U.S. Census. The plan applies to legislatures elected in 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020. A new plan will be developed in 2022 following the 2020 U.S. Census. As of the 2010 census, the state as a whole had a population of 625,741. As there are a total of 30 Senators, there were 20,858 residents per senator. ==Members per district== Senators in multi-member districts are elected at-large throughout the district. Districts range from one to six senators. Three districts elect one senator each, six districts elect two each, three elect three each, and one (Chittenden) elects six. ==District naming== Senate district lines are drawn with an eye toward adhering to the boundaries of the state's 14 counties, and the districts are named after the county or counties in which the bulk of the district is located. However, due to equal representation requirements of the federal and state constitutions, most districts do not have precisely the same boundaries as their respective counties, containing either one or more towns from neighboring counties or not containing one or more from their own county (or both). ==Districts== The following is from the Vermont Secretary of State. {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- !
