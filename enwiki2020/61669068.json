    "text": "The Worcester Collegiate Hockey League was an intercollegiate athletic conference affiliated with the NCAA's College Division. The league was created in 1966 between 4 schools from around Worcester, Massachusetts as well as Nichols College, a few miles to the south. ==History== In 1966 a few colleges in the Worcester, Massachusetts area began sponsoring ice hockey as a varsity sport. The schools immediately banded together to form the Worcester Collegiate Hockey League and included the already existing programs at Assumption College and Nichols College. After one season four of the members joined ECAC 2 as well but continued to hold their own conference tournament. Holy Cross left the conference in 1970 to play a more rounded schedule in ECAC 2 play and after a year the three remaining ECAC teams became founding members of ECAC 3. Worcester Polytechnic Institute dropped its ice hockey program after 1972 and the conference was dissolved. ===WCHL Tournament=== The WCHL held a conference tournament each year of its existence. ==Member schools== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! !Location !Athletic nickname !Enrollment# !Colors !Founded !Joined !Left !Succeeding Conference !Current Conference\u2020 |- ! |Worcester, Massachusetts |Greyhounds |2,753 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1904 |1966 |1972 |ECAC 3 |Northeast\u201310 |- ! |Worcester, Massachusetts |Crusaders | 2,897 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1843 |1966 |1970 |ECAC 2 |Atlantic Hockey |- |- ! |Dudley, Massachusetts |Bison | 1,459 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1815 |1966 |1972 |ECAC 3 |CCC |- ! |Worcester, Massachusetts |Lancers |6,221 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1874 |1966 |1972 |ECAC 3 |MASCAC |- ! |Worcester, Massachusetts |Engineers |4,177 | style=\"text-align:right;\" | |1865 |1966 |1972 |colspan=2|Dropped Program |- |} # enrollment in 2018 \u2020 as of 2018 ==Membership timeline== DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy ImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:20 Period = from:08/01/1966 till:05/01/1972 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal PlotArea = right:20 left:0 bottom:50 top:5 #> to display a count on left side of graph, use \"left:20\" to suppress the count, use \"left:20\"<# Colors = id:barcolor value:rgb(0.99,0.7,0.7) id:men value:rgb(0.5,0.8,0.8) legend:men id:line value:black id:bg value:white id:Full value:rgb(0.5,0.8,0.8) # PlotData= width:15 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s bar:1 color:Full from:08/01/1966 till:05/01/1970 text:Holy Cross (1966\u20131970) bar:2 color:Full from:08/01/1966 till:05/01/1972 text:Assumption (1966\u20131972) bar:3 color:Full from:08/01/1966 till:05/01/1972 text:Nichols (1966\u20131972) bar:4 color:Full from:08/01/1966 till:05/01/1972 text:Worcester State (1966\u20131972) bar:5 color:Full from:08/01/1966 till:05/01/1972 text:WPI (1966\u20131972) ScaleMajor = gridcolor:line unit:year increment:1 start:1967 ==See Also== *ECAC 2 ==References== ==External links== Category:NCAA Division II conferences ",
