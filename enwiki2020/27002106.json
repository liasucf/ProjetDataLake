As a child he studied piano and music and began particular music studies in 1932, continued at the Jewish conservatory (1942) and graduated from the Music Academy of Bucharest (1954).Cummings, David (ed.), \"Natra, Sergiu\", International Who's Who in Classical Music, Routledge, 2000, p. 261. He studied, among others, theory, composition and orchestration with Leon Klepper and modern music with Michael Andricu. He began composing at an early age and his work titled \"March and Choral\" for symphony orchestra, earned him the status of a modernist in Romania. The Israel Philharmonic Orchestra performed this work in 1947 under the direction of Edward Lindenberg. NATRA had received many composition awards in for his creations, among which, for \"March and Choral\" for symphony orchestra and \"Divertimento in ancient style\" for symphony string orchestra, the George Enescu award for composition in 1945 (for works composed at the age of 19) and for \"Suite for symphony orchestra\" he received in 1951 the National prize for composition (for works composed at the age of 25). In 1961, Natra and his wife, Sonia, a sculptor and multidisciplinary artist, emigrated to Israel. A year later, conducted by Sergiu Comissiona, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra performed the \"Horizons Symphony for symphony string orchestra\", which was the last piece he had written in Romania, and the \"Music for violin and harp\", performed by the violinist Miriam Fried and the French harpist Fran\u00e7oise Netter. Besides composing music, Natra taught music, including at Tel-Aviv University, where he taught music of the 20th century, composition, and analysis of forms. He was a professor at the Music Academy in the Tel-Aviv University until 1985. Among his students were Lior Shambadal, Rafi Kadishson, Erel Paz, Ruben Seroussi, Deborah Rothstein Schramm, Dror Elimelech (composers), Yehonatan Berick (violinist), Sally Pinkas, Eugene Alcalay, Sivan Silver and Gil Garburg, Dr. Eran Lupu (pianists), Yoni Farhi (Pianist and conductor). Natra and his wife Sonia, have two sons, Danny and GabiWho's Who in Israel and Jewish Personalities from All Over the World, Bronfman, Ben Itzhak (ed.) 1985 (p. 237) ==Main works== Natra is a composer with a clear European orientation, who has a clear personal stamp and a particular writing style with melodic flow, atonal language, polyphonic idea, gradual development and shaping of motive material. He makes use of a rich palette of sound- colors, unusual instrumental combinations, central registers of instruments (and voices), playing techniques which are natural and comfortable and succeed in producing optimal sound, texts in a new language, with its fresh rhythms and sonorities.
