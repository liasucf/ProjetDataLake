The development of this class was one of the earliest attempts of the JCG to deal with spy boats from North Korea. In March 1999, the JCG tried to intercept vessels of unknown nationality suspected to be North Korean, but the unknown vessels were too fast, and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force had to be called to intercept the unknown vessels. As a consequence of this failure, JCG realized their need for high speed interceptors.Yoshifumi Mayama 2008, p142. The Tsurugi class is referred to as . Planned as the top-tier of JCG intercept spy boats, this class features very high speed and accurate firepower. Its weaponry includes a JM61 20 mm Gatling gun, and a Remote Firing System consisting of a remote weapon system with a laser-optical fire-control system.Shigehiro Sakamoto 2008, p. 134. In the Battle of Amami-\u014cshima, the combination of the 20 mm gun with the RFS proved its worth, but it became clear that its effective range was insufficient against weapons on board the North Korean spy boats such as 9K38 Igla MANPADS and B-10 recoilless rifle. In response, the JCG intends to organize mobile flotillas combining Tsurugi-class ships with vessels of the and es, which have Bofors 40 mm L/70 autocannons.Shigehiro Sakamoto 2008, p135. ==Ships in the class== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |+ Ships in the class !
