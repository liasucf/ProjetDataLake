Teelin is home to Col\u00e1iste Aoidh Mhic Bhricne, an Irish language college which attracts teenagers from across the province of Ulster. The college has been open in its current existence since 1955. Teelin was one of the first settlements to appear on maps of Ireland, as it was an important port.
