    "text": "Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors are compounds that slow or stop the action of the arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (5-lipoxygenase or 5-LOX) enzyme, which is responsible for the production of inflammatory leukotrienes. The overproduction of leukotrienes is a major cause of inflammation in asthma, allergic rhinitis, and osteoarthritis.David L. Nelson, Michael M. Cox. Lehninger's Principles of Biochemistry, Fifth Edition. W.H. Freeman and Co., 2008, p. 359. Examples of 5-LOX inhibitors include the pharmaceutical drugs meclofenamate sodium, zileuton and myxochelins/pseudochelin. Some chemicals found in trace amounts in food, as well as some dietary supplements, have been shown to inhibit 5-LOX; these include baicalein, caffeic acid, curcumin, hyperforin and St John's wort. acetyl-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA), one of the bioactive boswellic acids found in Boswellia serrata (Indian Frankincense) has been found to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase strongly as an allosteric inhibitor. Boswellia administration has been shown to reduce brain edema in patients irradiated for brain tumor and it's believed to be due to 5-lipoxygenase inhibition. ==See also== *Antileukotriene agents *Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase ALOX5-inhibiting drugs ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Oxidoreductase inhibitors ",
