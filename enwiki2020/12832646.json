    "text": "The Society of American Silversmiths (SAS) was founded in April 1989 as the nation's only professional organization devoted solely to the preservation and promotion of contemporary silversmithing. In addition to an outstanding benefits package, all members have access to the Society's technical and marketing expertise through its free consulting service to members. Its Artisan members, those silversmiths who have been juried into the Society based on their outstanding technical skill, are provided with support, networking, and greater access to the market. The SAS Artisan member archive contains a maker's mark registry, over 1,400 slides and 400 photographs, and a resume for each Artisan member. Through SAS, the public has access to a unique referral service that commissions silver holloware, flatware, and sculpture from its Artisans. The SAS Web site (http://www.silversmithing.com) provides information on silversmithing techniques; silver care; restoration and conservation; and the aesthetic value of this art form.
