    "text": "Red Cab to Manhattan is the third album by singer/songwriter Stephen Bishop and his first for Warner Bros. Unlike his previous two albums, Careless and Bish, none of its tracks nor the album itself cracked the top 100 on the Billboard singles or albums charts. Like his previous albums, Bishop had some big name help on the album. Notable contributors include Eric Clapton, Phil Collins and Art Garfunkel. ==Reception== Rolling Stone's Stephen Holden wrote that \"[t]he new album is a dazzling breakthrough.\" Stating that \"[o]n Red Cab to Manhattan, Stephen Bishop\u2014pop music's most endearing wimp and an unabashed acolyte of Paul Simon and Paul McCartney\u2014adds Steely Dan to his roster of idols.\" Noting that \"[i]t's been ages since Paul McCartney wrote a love song as fetching as \"Don't You Worry\"... [a]nd \"Red Cab to Manhattan\" is as delicately shaded a mood piece as any of Paul Simon's miniatures.\" Concluding that \"[t]hough Stephen Bishop still wears his idols on his sleeve, his sense of humor is unique.\" ==Track listing== All songs written by Stephen Bishop, except where noted. ==Personnel== * Stephen Bishop \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm track arrangements, backing vocals (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8), acoustic guitar (1, 2, 4-12), electric guitar (1, 2, 3, 7), acoustic piano (2), trombone (9) * Sid McGinnis \u2013 electric guitar (1, 5, 11) * David Spinozza \u2013 electric guitar (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9), acoustic guitar (2) * Hugh McCracken \u2013 slide guitar (2) * Dean Parks \u2013 electric guitar (4) * Eric Clapton \u2013 electric guitar (6, 10) * Jeff Mironov \u2013 electric guitar (7, 11) * Buzz Feiten \u2013 electric guitar (11) * Ed Walsh \u2013 synthesizer, programming (all tracks), koto (9) * Don Grolnick \u2013 acoustic piano (1, 3, 5), Fender Rhodes (1, 8, 9) * Warren Bernhardt \u2013 Fender Rhodes (4, 7, 11), clavinet (11) * Gary Brooker \u2013 Fender Rhodes (6, 10), acoustic piano (10) * Chris Stainton \u2013 acoustic piano (6, 7), Fender Rhodes (10) * Neil Larsen \u2013 acoustic piano (7) * Willie Weeks \u2013 bass guitar (1, 3, 5, 8, 9) * Jeffrey Stanton \u2013 bass guitar (2), backing vocals (2, 4) * Dennis Belfield \u2013 bass guitar (4) * John Giblin \u2013 bass guitar (6, 10) * Neil Jason \u2013 bass guitar (7, 11) * Andy Newmark \u2013 drums (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9) * Steve Gadd \u2013 drums (4) * Phil Collins \u2013 drums (6, 10) * Chris Parker \u2013 drums (11) * Lenny Castro \u2013 percussion (4, 7, 8, 11) * Mike Mainieri \u2013 rhythm track arrangements, marimba (1, 12), vibraphone (4, 12), synthesizer (4, 11), cymbal (8), timpani (8), arrangements (8), vocoder (11), contrabass (12) * Clive Anstree \u2013 cello (6) * Don Sebesky \u2013 horn arrangements and conductor (3) * Gene Page \u2013 arrangements (4) * Jeremy Lubbock \u2013 string and woodwind arrangements (9) * Phoebe Snow \u2013 backing vocals (3) * David Lasley \u2013 backing vocals (4, 11) * Arnold McCuller \u2013 backing vocals (4, 11) * Art Garfunkel \u2013 backing vocals (9) ==Production== * Producers \u2013 Tommy LiPuma and Mike Mainieri * Recorded by Steve Churchyard, Scott Litt and Alan Vonner * Mastered by Bob Ludwig at Masterdisk (New York, NY) * Art Direction and Design \u2013 John Kosh * Cover Photo \u2013 Lynn Goldsmith * Sleeve Photo \u2013 Elizabeth Lennard * Management \u2013 Trudy Green ==References== Category:1980 albums Category:Stephen Bishop (singer) albums Category:albums arranged by Don Sebesky Category:albums arranged by Gene Page Category:albums produced by Tommy LiPuma Category:Warner Records albums ",
