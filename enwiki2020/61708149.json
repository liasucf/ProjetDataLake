    "text": "The Magnolia Petroleum Company Filling Station is a historic automotive service station building at Larch and 1st Streets in Kingsland, Arkansas. It is a small single-story masonry building, built of red and buff brick and covered by a gabled roof. The front facade has a door on the left side and a plate glass window (now boarded up) on the right. A concrete pad in front of the building originally supported the fuel pumps. The building was built about 1930, and is a good example of an early filling station with Tudor and Craftsman features, built to a Magnolia Company design which was used for at least one other filling station, in North Little Rock (which was destroyed after a fire in 2018). The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. A similarly-named filling station in Fayetteville, Arkansas, in northwest Arkansas, was listed on the National Register in 1978 as the Magnolia Company Filling Station. ==See also== *List of historic filling stations in the United States *National Register of Historic Places listings in Cleveland County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Gas stations on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1930 Category:Buildings and structures in Cleveland County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cleveland County, Arkansas ",
