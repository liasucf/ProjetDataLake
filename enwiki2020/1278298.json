    "text": "Publius Pomponius Secundus was a distinguished statesman and poet in the reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius. He was suffect consul for the nundinium of January to June 44, succeeding the ordinary consul Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus and as the colleague of the other ordinary consul, Titus Statilius Taurus.Gallivan, \"The Fasti for the Reign of Claudius\", pp. 408, 424. Publius was on intimate terms with the elder Pliny, who wrote a biography of him, now lost. ==Name== His full name was Publius Calvisius Sabinus Pomponius Secundus, as indicated by two fragmentary inscriptions from Germania Superior., . For some time, Pomponius' praenomen was uncertain; Publius was not a regular name of the Pompilii, and Olli Salomies discusses the possibility that it might have been Gaius, but notes that a Publius Calvisius Sabinus was attested as existing in Spoletium, and concludes that it is \"possible to assume with some confidence\" that he had been adopted by a Publius Calvisius Sabinus.Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature, p. 114 That his praenomen was Publius, at least after his adoption, seems to be confirmed by an inscription from Veii, dating from his consulship, another from Cyrenae, when he was proconsul, and one from Mogontiacum, when he was Legatus Augusti pro praetore., , . ==Family== Pomponius' mother was Vistilia, who by other marriages was the mother of Publius Suillius Rufus and the general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo. The name of his father is not known, but Ronald Syme has suggested he could be either Gaius Pomponius Graecinus, consul suffectus in AD 16, or his brother, Lucius Pomponius Flaccus, consul ordinarius in 17.Syme, \"Domitius Corbulo\", p. 31 Pomponius' brother, Quintus Pomponius Secundus, was involved in various intrigues during the reigns of Tiberius and Claudius. Quintus tried to protect his brother from Tiberius' displeasure.Tacitus, Annales, vi. 18, xiii. 43. ==Political career== Pomponius was one of the friends of Sejanus, who was consul in 31, and on the latter's fall in October of that year, Pomponius was placed under house arrest, where he remained until Caligula released him.Cassius Dio, Roman History, lix. 6, 29.Tacitus, Annales, v.8, vi.18. During either the reign of Caligula or Claudius he was governor of the public province of Creta et Cyrenaica.Eck, \"\u00dcber die pr\u00e4torischen Prokonsulate in der Kaiserzeit\". It was during the reign of Claudius that Pomponius acceded to the consulship. He was afterwards governor of Germania Superior from the year 50 to 54; during his office Pomponius conducted a successful campaign, described by Tacitus, against the German Chatti, where, after forty years, survivors of the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest were freed from slavery. For this he received ornamenta triumphalia.Tacitus, Annales, xii.27, 28 ==Writings== It was by his tragedies that Secundus obtained the most celebrity. They are spoken of in the highest terms by Tacitus, Quintilian, and the younger Pliny, and were read even in a much later age, as one of them is quoted by the grammarian Charisius. These tragedies were first put on the stage in the time of Claudius. Quintilian asserts that he was far superior to any writer of tragedies he had known, and Tacitus expresses a high opinion of his literary abilities.Tacitus, Annales, xi. 13; Dialogus de Oratoribus, 13.Quintilian, Institutio Oratoria, x. 1. \u00a7 98.Pliny the Younger, Epistulae, iii. 5, vii. 17.Charisius, apud Bothe, Po\u00ebtae Scenici Latinorum Fragmenta, vol. ii. p. 279. Secundus devoted much attention to the niceties of grammar and style, on which he was recognized as an authority. His subject matter was Greek, with one known exception, a praetexta called Aeneas. Tragedians in the Julio-Claudian and Flavian periods typically were men of relatively high social status, and their works often expressed their political views under an insufficient veil of fiction. Only a few lines of his work remain, some of which belong to Aeneas.Conte, Latin Literature, pp. 417, 418.Rudich, Political Dissidence under Nero, p. 304. ==See also== * Pomponia (gens) * Calvisia gens ==References== ==Bibliography== * Gaius Plinius Secundus (Pliny the Elder), Historia Naturalis (Natural History). * Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (Quintilian), Institutio Oratoria (Institutes of Oratory). * Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus (Pliny the Younger), Epistulae (Letters). * Publius Cornelius Tacitus, Annales, Dialogus de Oratoribus (Dialogue on Oratory). * Lucius Cassius Dio Cocceianus (Cassius Dio), Roman History. * Flavius Sosipater Charisius, Ars Grammatica (The Art of Grammar). * Friedrich Heinrich Bothe, Po\u00ebtae Scenici Latinorum Fragmenta (Fragments of the Latin Theatrical Poets), Heinrich Vogler, Halberstadt (1822). * Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, ed., Little, Brown and Company, Boston (1849). * Theodor Mommsen et alii, Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (The Body of Latin Inscriptions, abbreviated CIL), Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften (1853\u2013present). * Ren\u00e9 Cagnat et alii, L'Ann\u00e9e \u00e9pigraphique (The Year in Epigraphy, abbreviated AE), Presses Universitaires de France (1888\u2013present). * Otto Ribbeck, Geschichte der r\u00f6mischen Dichtung, vol. iii.
