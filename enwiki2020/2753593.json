    "text": "The Hungarian Recording Industry Association (Hungarian: Magyar Hanglemezkiad\u00f3k Sz\u00f6vets\u00e9ge, more commonly abbreviated to MAHASZ or Mahasz) is the Hungarian music industry association, founded in 1992. MAHASZ issues the Hungarian Music Awards and maintains the music charts for Hungary. ==Certification levels== Since 1 January 2018, MAHASZ combined all certifications into one combined \"album\" certifications, which includes albums and singles of all genres and origins. For Gold status an album needs to sell 2,000 units and for Platinum 4,000 units, where ten singles are counted as one album. The certification also includes streaming at a rate of 1,000 paid streams or 5,000 free streams per album. ==Certification levels history== Certifications have existed in Hungary since the mid-1970s. During that period, albums had to sell 50,000 units to qualify for Gold status. Singles were required to sell 100,000 units to reach Gold level in the mid-1970s. ===Albums=== ====Domestic repertoire==== The table below shows certification levels for Gold and Platinum determined by MAHASZ. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
