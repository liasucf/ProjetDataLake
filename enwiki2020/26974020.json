The name is a clipped adjectival form, shortened from *Rakitna vas (i.e., ' village'). The adjective rakitna comes from the Slovene common noun rakita 'eared willow', and so the name literally means '(village of the) eared willow', thus referring to the local vegetation. ==History== Rakitna was along the route of the Roman road from Cerknica to Emona and from \u010cu\u0161perk to Lu\u017earji. A barrier known as the \"pagan wall\" () was built to protect the road, closing off the valley between Mount Novaki (, 998 m) and Av\u0161nik Hill (930 m). A school was established in Rakitna in 1903. The schoolhouse was burned in 1943 during the Second World War. ==Church== Holy Cross Church The local parish church is dedicated to the Holy Cross and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana.

The church was elevated to the seat of a parish in 1766. ==Natural monuments== The Brinar fir () was a mutant European silver fir that grew in the Zagabrnice Woods on the southwest slope of Mount Novaki (), about southwest of Rakitna. The tree was studied by the forestry researcher Miran Brinar (1909\u20132002), after whom it was named. The tree started growing 1890 and was characterized by an unusual columnar crown and markedly shorter, wider, and denser needles with a denser distribution of stomata. It also had a significantly faster rate of growth than surrounding firs and produced cones annually rather than every two to three years. The tree was felled by an unknown vandal in July 2016. At the time it was felled, it was still growing vigorously and had a height of and circumference of .Rogelj Petri\u010d, Silvestra. 2016. Da bo Brinarjeva jelka \u017eivela kljub vandalizmu.
