He also starred in the films Syriana (2005), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), Hannibal (2006), A Lost Man (2007), Cairo Time (2009) and Inescapable (2012). ==Early life== Siddig was born in Omdurman, Sudan. His father, Tahir, was Sudanese; his mother, Gloria (n\u00e9e. Taylor, d. 2001) was English. She was also the older sister of actor Malcolm McDowell. Siddig's parents met in the 1960s when his mother travelled to Sudan with a friend who introduced her to Siddig's father, a member of Sudan's ruling family at the time. Siddig's father was a student at Cambridge University in the 1950s and was proficient in English. Siddig's uncle Sadiq al-Mahdi was Prime Minister of Sudan from 19661967 and again from 19861989. Siddig is also the great-great-grandson of Muhammad Ahmad, a Nubian religious leader who was proclaimed the Mahdi by his disciples. Siddig's mother remained in Sudan for three years and returned to London with Siddig and his father. Siddig was 2 years old at the time. Siddig spoke Arabic when he was young, but is no longer able to speak or understand the language. He told Bidoun magazine that, according to his mother, he had forgotten the language within two years of moving to London.
