    "text": "SpaceX CRS-19, also known as SpX-19, was a Commercial Resupply Service mission to the International Space Station. The mission is contracted by NASA and was flown by SpaceX on a Falcon 9 rocket. Dragon capsule C106 made its third flight on CRS-19 having previously flown on CRS-4 and CRS-11. Dragon successfully returned to Earth on 7 January 2020 after a month-long stay at the ISS. ==Launch schedule history== CRS-19 launch On February 2016, it was announced that NASA had awarded a contract extension to SpaceX for five CRS additional missions (CRS-16 to CRS-20). In June 2016, a NASA Inspector General report had this mission manifested for December 2018. The mission was later delayed to 15 October 2019, but launched in December 2019. On 5 December 2019, CRS-19 launched successfully, followed by a successful first stage landing on the barge Of Course I Still Love You. ==Payload== NASA has contracted for the CRS-19 mission from SpaceX and therefore determines the primary payload, date/time of launch, and orbital parameters for the Dragon space capsule. CRS-11 carried a total of of material into orbit. This included of pressurised cargo with packaging bound for the International Space Station, and of unpressurised cargo composed of the Kib\u014d-mounted Hyperspectral Imager Suite (HISUI) from Japan, the Robotic Tool Stowage (RiTS) platform, and a replacement lithium-ion battery for the station's solar array truss. The following is a breakdown of cargo bound for the ISS: * Science investigations: * Crew supplies: * Vehicle hardware: * Spacewalk equipment: * Computer resources: * External payloads: ** Hyperspectral Imaging Suite (HISUI): ~ ** Robotic Tool Stowage (RiTS) ** Lithium-ion battery Among the science experiments transported to the station are the Anheuser-Busch-sponsored Germination of ABI Voyager Barley Seeds in Microgravity, the Confined Combustion experiment, and 40 genetically engineered mice as part of the Rodent Research-19 experiment. A number of CubeSats were launched on CRS-19. The ELaNa-25B flight included AzTechSat-1, SORTIE, and CryoCube, while the ELaNa-28 flight included CIRiS and EdgeCube. Other small satellites launched on this mission include QARMAN and MakerSat-1. ==See also== * Uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station ==References== Category:SpaceX Dragon Category:Spacecraft launched in 2019 Category:SpaceX payloads contracted by NASA Category:Supply vehicles for the International Space Station Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2020 ",
