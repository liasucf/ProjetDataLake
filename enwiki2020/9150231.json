    "text": "Galician Cantigas de Santa Maria. Bat-and-ball games (or safe haven games) are field games played by two opposing teams, in which the action starts when the defending team throws a ball at a dedicated player of the attacking team, who tries to hit it with a bat.In some games for a small number of players, such as workup and the way old cat games, there are no teams and players rotate through the positions. The best known modern bat-and-ball games are baseball and cricket, with common roots in the 18th-century games played in England. The teams alternate between \"batting\" (offensive) role, sometimes called \"in at bat\" or simply in, and \"fielding\" (defensive role), also called \"out in the field\" or out.Note that the terms \"in\" and \"out\" can have several other important meanings in various bat-and-ball sports; for an example of wordplay involving this in cricket that demonstrates the ambiguity inherent to the terms, see https://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/page/429550.html. Only the batting team may score, but teams have equal opportunities in both roles. The game is counted rather than timed. The action starts when a player on the fielding team puts the ball in play with a delivery whose restriction depends on the game. A player on the batting team attempts to strike the delivered ball, commonly with a \"bat\", which is a club governed by the rules of the game. After striking the ball, the batter may become a runner trying to reach a safe haven or \"base\". While in contact with a base, the runner is safe from the fielding team and in a position to score runs. Leaving a safe haven places the runner in danger of being put out. The teams switch roles when the fielding team puts the batting team out, which varies by game. In modern baseball, the fielders put three players out. In cricket, they retire all players but one. In many forms of early American baseball (townball, roundball), a single out ended the inning. Some games permit multiple runners and some have multiple bases to run in sequence. Batting may occur, and running begin, at one of the bases. The movement between those \"safe havens\" is governed by the rules of the particular sport, and runs (points) may be scored when the batting team's players go from one safe haven to another. == Common features == This list may not apply to all bat-and-ball games, but covers certain features common to many of them: * Safe haven rules: ** Only one player can be protected by a given safe haven (i.e. both batters can't stay in the same crease in cricket to avoid a runout). *** Schlagball and Lapta (game) allow multiple runners at a safe haven. ** The number of safe havens may range from 2 to 4. * How to score runs: ** How runs are scored by running: *** In cricket, two partners occupy 2 opposing safe havens known as each partner's ground, and can swap safe havens to score one run. More swaps can be made to score more runs. *** In Schlagball, a runner must make it from one of the safe havens to the other, and back, to score one run. *** In various baseball-like games, a runner must complete a full trip around all of the bases to score a run. ** Alternative ways to score runs: *** A ball that is hit very far (such as to the edge of, or out of the field) through the air (such as a home run or six (cricket)), or potentially in a specific area or place, such as in Bat-and-Trap, may automatically give the batting team some points, or at least the chance of earning points. https://protoball.org/Modern_rules_of_Schlagball \"Long hit point If a player hits the ball over the pitch into the long-hitting field, thus over 70 meters, the batting team is given a long hit point.\" * Ways for a batter to get out: ** When a batter hits a ball in the air that is caught by a fielder without bouncing, the fielding team gets closer to getting the batting team out, or otherwise receives an advantage. *** In baseball and cricket, catches get the batter out. **** In early forms of baseball, the ball could bounce once before being caught.https://www.mlb.com/cut4/10-bizarre-rules-from-baseballs- past/c-124363454 \"2. Fly balls could be caught off a bounce until 1864, and foul balls until 1883\" The \"one hand, one bounce\" rule of street cricket is similar. *** In Schlagball, a one-handed catch taken \"without bobbling\" earns the fielding team a point. https://protoball.org/Modern_rules_of_Schlagball \"Catch point If the batted ball caught by a player of the fielding team directly from the air, with one hand and without bobbling [Nachgreifen], the field team receives a catch point. Catch points also may be earned off invalid hits of the batting side by catching the ball.\" *** A fielder must remain within the field of play for the catch to be valid. ** The batter may have a \"strike zone\" or area within which they are obliged to hit or deflect the ball if it is thrown there, lest they be put out. (In baseball, 3 unhit balls in the strike zone get a batter out, while one ball hitting a batter's wicket gets them out in cricket). * Penalties are rewarded to the batting team if the ball isn't thrown \"fairly\" to the batter (i.e. isn't thrown from far away enough, or is thrown too far from the batter's hitting zone) ** See wide (cricket) and ball (baseball statistics). * Strategy: ** Batters have some latitude in terms of how far or when to run when scoring points (i.e. a baseball batter may stop at 1st base or continue to 2nd if they desire, though their choice also depends on whether there is a runner at 2nd or 3rd; see Base_running#Strategy), and this creates a risk-reward decision that could result in either more points or more outs. *** Generally, the further the ball is hit from the fielders, the more time this affords for running. ** There may be decisions on where to place fielders (see Infield shift) in anticipation of where a batter may hit the ball, or decisions on how and who best to deliver the ball to the batter so as to prevent them from hitting it and scoring (see Bowling_(cricket)#Bowling_tactics). * There may be certain places where the batter is not allowed or penalized for hitting the ball to. See foul ball. * The ball may be thrown through the air to the batter, or it might bounce on the ground before reaching them. (See bowling (cricket)) * How batters alternate the batting: ** In cricket, the two safe havens are occupied at all times by one player each from the batting team. The ball is delivered to the player standing in one of the safe havens, with the two players being a batting pair that face all deliveries for their team until one of them is dismissed, at which point another player from the batting team comes to occupy the now-unoccupied safe haven. *** The batting order (cricket) is not fixed, and a player may not be on a safe haven if they were out earlier in the inning. ** In baseball and other sports, every time the batter runs to a new safe haven, another batter comes in to bat. *** These games tend to have a fixed batting order, and players can bat several times in an inning. === Field === The safe havens of a cricket field (left) and baseball field (right) are depicted in green. In cricket and baseball, the playing field is large, and is divided into an infield and outfield (based on proximity to where the batters are running). Cricket has the delivery and hitting of the ball done in the same area where the batters can run (the cricket pitch), while baseball always does the running in a separate area. Many bat-and-ball games have playing area in front of the batter (such as Schlagball), but may (like baseball) restrict batters from hitting the ball behind themselves or too far to the side; see foul territory. === Game length === T20 cricket and baseball both last about 3 hours, while other forms of cricket can last multiple days. Informal bat-and- ball games may take place in shorter periods of time, and in general, the possibility of a team's batters getting out rapidly in succession makes it theoretically possible for certain periods of play in most bat-and-ball games to end quicker than usual. * The game may be played for a certain number of innings. ** There can potentially be time restrictions (as in Test cricket), or the possibility of a game being suspended and resumed at a later date if necessary.. ** The team with fewer runs may have to bat more innings than the other team (see Follow on). * There may be no restriction on the number of innings or time. ==== Result ==== Bat-and-ball games are played until: * In baseball and Test cricket, the team with fewer runs must complete all of its scheduled innings for there to be a winner, with the end of the inning occurring when the team has a certain number of outs. ** Test cricket also has the potential of a draw, which is where time runs out before the team that is behind on runs completes its innings. ** In limited overs cricket, an inning can also be completed when a team has faced a certain number of (legal) deliveries to score off of. * In bete-ombro and early forms of baseball, a game can be played until either team scores a certain number of runs. Ties can be dealt with in several ways: * The tie may simply be considered a tie. * Both teams may get additional deliveries to try to score off of, to break the tie. ** Cricket has a Super Over of 6 additional deliveries. ** Baseball has extra innings. === Terminology === Here are some terms or concepts common to many bat-and-ball games: * The person who delivers the ball to the batter: the bowler (cricket), pitcher * Getting the batter out by throwing the ball at something near the batter, when the batter doesn't hit the ball: strike out, Bowled#Dismissal_of_a_batsman * The act of getting the batter or runner out when they are not in a safe haven: ** If the ball is thrown at the runner: plugging, soaking ** If a fielder touches the runner with ball in hand: tagout ** If a fielder gets the ball to the safe haven before the runner does: force out, runout * getting a batter out by catching the ball when hit in the air by the batter: fly out, caught out * The points both teams score: runs * The safe havens: base (baseball), ground (cricket), crease (cricket) * A ball hit out of the field of play through the air: home run, six (cricket) ===Equipment=== * Bat: generally resembles the round shape of a baseball bat or the flat shape of the larger cricket bat . Other designs include something similar to a hockey stick. * Ball: Often about as large as a cricket ball * Protective equipment for the batter and/or fielders, ranging from helmets to gloves. In the field, there may be: * Physical markers for the safe havens (such as bases, wickets, and lines like the crease (cricket)) * Physical markers for the \"strike zone\" near the batter (see the target in Vitilla) * A physical boundary for the field (see the fence in baseball) ==List of bat-and-ball games== Notable bat-and-ball games include: ===Mainstream sports=== * Baseball \u2013 has four bases ** Softball * Cricket \u2013 has two wickets ** Test cricket ** First-class cricket ** Blind cricket ** Club cricket ** French cricket ** Kilikiti ** One Day International ** Kwik cricket ** List-A cricket ** Pro40 ** Indoor Cricket ** Limited-overs cricket ** Short form cricket ** Single wicket ** Twenty20 ** T10 League ===Other games=== * Bat-and-Trap * Gilli Danda * Oina * Old Cat (One old cat, Two old cat, etc.) \u2013 variable * P\u00e4rk * Stoolball ====Similar to baseball==== * Blooperball \u2013 Softball with a squishy, 16-inch ball * British Baseball \u2013 four posts * Br\u00e4nnboll \u2013 four bases * Corkball \u2013 four bases (no base-running) * Elle * Extreme Baseball a.k.a.

The objective is one batter (striking batter) on and at the right batter's box is pitched to, other batter (non-striking batter) stands on the left batter's box, then the striking batter must hit it and batter must runs around the bases in the normal counterclockwise direction, while the non-striking batter runs around bases in a clockwise direction at the same time. The game could last 12 innings of 5 overs. ====Non-bat-and-ball games==== Striking the ball with a \"bat\" or any type of stick is not crucial. These games use the foot or hand. Otherwise their rules may be similar or even identical to baseball. The first two use a large (35 cm) soft ball. * Kickball - four bases, sometimes called soccer baseball ** Matball - kickball with gym mats for bases * Punchball - four bases, sometimes called volleyball-style baseball or slug ==References== ==See also== *Comparison of baseball and cricket, the two largest bat-and-ball sports ==External links== * Project Protoball * Johnball * Best Youth Baseball Bat 2016 Category:Ball games ",
