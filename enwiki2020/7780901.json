    "text": "The North-West T-way is a continuous series of bus-only lanes and bus roadways between Parramatta, Blacktown and Rouse Hill in Western Sydney. Opened in stages between March and November 2007, the T-way was the second bus rapid transit route to be built in Sydney after the Liverpool\u2013Parramatta T-way. == Alignment == The T-way follows Old Windsor Road north from Westmead Hospital. At Memorial Avenue, Kellyville, the route branches, with one branch continuing north along Old Windsor and Windsor roads to Rouse Hill Town Centre and the other heading west along Sunnyholt Road to Blacktown. The alignment includes 10 new bridges and two new underpasses. Three of the T-way's 24 route- kilometres are bus lanes on existing roads. The Bella Vista\u2013Rouse Hill section of the T-way runs parallel with the Sydney Metro Northwest rail line. == Construction == The NSW Government announced the T-way network as part of its Action for Transport plan in 1998. The North-West project was approved in February 2004 and was jointly overseen by the then Ministry of Transport and Roads and Traffic Authority. The $323 million design\u2013build\u2013maintain contract was awarded to Leighton Contractors and construction began in mid 2005.North- T-way, Leighton ContractorsNorth West Bus Transitway , Leighton Construction took place alongside a major upgrade and widening program on Windsor and Old Windsor roads, known as 'All the way to Windsor'. The design was said to avoid many of the mistakes that had made the earlier Liverpool\u2013Parramatta T-way so expensive to build. The T-way opened in three stages:Hillsbus Service Update: Routes T63, T64, T65 and 610\", Hillsbus 25 September 2007.

A fourth section, continuing from the Blacktown branch and between Burns Interchange to Castle Hill, was never constructed. == Stations == Norbrik T-way station The North-West T-way has 30 stations, spaced approximately every 800 metres. Stations feature closed circuit television, real-time information screens, emergency help points, audio announcements and extensive landscaping. One station, Parramatta Station, also forms part of the Liverpool\u2013Parramatta T-way.

There are many services which traverse the T-Way, either in its entirety or a section of it. The route numbering follows the Sydney Metropolitan Bus Route Numbering System with T-way specific routes prefixed with T until July 2019.

Even before its opening, the Roads and Traffic Authority was criticised for its lack of planning and broken promises on the T-way's construction. Parramatta Council complained during construction that noise walls had not been built next to the homes of residents who lived along the T-way route, causing them distress. The planned cycleway alongside the T-way was not built in its entire length, and included a large deviation which Council complained would erode the cycleway's effectiveness.City of Parramatta, \"News: RTA urged to reconsider noise walls and cycleway route\", 11 November 2005. Accessed 16 April 2007. After the opening of the first stage of the T-way, a local cycle advocacy group identified a large gap in the cycleway, potentially compromising cyclists' safety.\"CAMWEST: North-West T-Way: From Abbott Road to Wentworthville\", 20 March 2007. Accessed 16 April 2007. Some local residents had their backyards destroyed.Soon, Nick, \"T-Way Nightmare\", Blacktown City Sun, 14 March 2007. Accessed 16 April 2007. On the opening of the initial route several other problems were raised. Comments were made concerning the initial patronage of the T-way. While the New South Wales State Government refused to say how many people used the T-way in its first week, a local newspaper discovered that the commuter carpark attracted as few as ten cars a day in the first week of operation.Campise, Kirsten, \"Commuters Ignoring T-Way\", The Northern News, 28 March 2007. Accessed 16 April 2007. Another local newspaper reported a traffic barrier separating vehicles from the busway at Westmead railway station was causing accidents.Stevens, Kylie, \"Barrier a 'hazard'\", Parramatta Sun, 28 March 2007. Accessed 16 April 2007. On 12 April 2007, the Roads and Traffic Authority quietly scrapped the bus priority system that would have given buses priority at all at-grade intersections. The decision was criticised as eliminating the main advantage of the T-way and not entice commuters back to public transport.Besser, Linton, \"Priority bus green lights scrapped\", Sydney Morning Herald, 12 April 2007. Accessed 16 April 2007. Bus operators expected better patronage once the toll on the Lane Cove Tunnel came into effect.Baker, Jordan, \"New tunnel sums: 17 minutes less, $25 more in toll\", Sydney Morning Herald, 23 March 2007.
