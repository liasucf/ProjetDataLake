    "text": "Crystal Garden, also known as \"CG\", is an American/Canadian rock band that was formed in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2015. Its founding members were singer- songwriter and guitarist Mycle Wastman, bassist and backing-vocalist Charlie Csontos, and drummer Matt Frewen. The band's first album, Let The Rocks Cry Out (which was produced by Boyd Tinsley, formerly of Dave Matthews Band) was released in 2017. The album featured Tinsley on numerous cuts and featured Stanley Jordan on two tracks. ==History== In August 2015, Boyd Tinsley brought the members of Crystal Garden together for the first time to \"do some creative session work\". For two years, Tinsley had looked for a specific group of musicians who would form his vision of an organic, modern day rock band. On the forming of the band, Tinsley commented \"The band was an idea I had maybe three years ago. I really wanted to create a young rock band \u2013 not a pop band \u2013 but a real rock band that had the same sensibility that rock from the 1960s and 1970s had to it. You know, something rocking from the heart and expressing something real. The question became: where am I going to find these guys? So I thought maybe I could try out some music agencies or talent agencies and see what I could come with. I started to pursue that a little bit, but then I realized the only way that this is going to come about is if it comes about organically. It has to be real. I have to be able to vibe off those people and know those people when I see them.\" In their first week of recording sessions at Boyd's Studio in Virginia they tracked the bulk of their first studio album, Let The Rocks Cry Out, which Tinsley produced. The album was released digitally on March 14, 2017 and physically on April 22, 2017. The band moved in together at the beginning of 2016 and spent the winter and spring rehearsing, writing new material, and preparing for a series of after-show gigs during Dave Matthews Band's Summer Tour. The same winter, Crystal Garden embarked on their its official tour through Canada playing in Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, and Montreal. The band toured North America with Tinsley, its manager. The band has appeared on numerous morning shows. On May 18, 2018, Boyd Tinsley was fired from Dave Matthews Band after a lawsuit was filed alleging sexual misconduct by former Crystal Garden band member James Frost-Winn.https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/05/boyd-tinsley- misconduct-allegations/ Tinsley issued a statement denying the \"false accusations\" and vowing to \"fight both in and out of court to repair the damage that has been done\". In June 2019, attorneys notified the court that the suit had been settled. ==Discography== ;Studio albums *Let The Rocks Cry Out (2017) ==References== Category:2015 establishments in Virginia Category:Musical groups established in 2015 Category:American rock music groups Category:Musical quartets ",
