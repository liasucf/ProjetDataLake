    "text": "The coat of arms of the Republic of Croatia () consists of one main shield and five smaller shields which form a crown over the main shield. The main coat of arms is a checkerboard (chequy) that consists of 13 red and 12 silver (white) fields. It's also informally known in Croatian as \u0161ahovnica (\"chessboard\", from \u0161ah, \"chess\"). The five smaller shields represent five different historical regions within Croatia. ==Official description== Croatian law describes the coat of arms as follows:Zakon o grbu, zastavi i himni Republike Hrvatske te zastavi i lenti predsjednika Republike Hrvatske, \u010clanak 7 The coat of arms of the Republic of Croatia is the historical Croatian coat of arms in the form of a shield twice divided horizontally and vertically into twenty- five red and white (silver) fields, so that the first field in the upper left corner is red. Above the shield lies a crown with five spikes, slightly arched with its ends conjoined with upper left and right parts of the shield. Within the crown, five lesser shields with historical Croatian coats of arms, lined from left to right in the following order: the oldest known Croatian coat of arms, coats of arms of the Dubrovnik Republic, Dalmatia, Istria and Slavonia. The ratio of height of the field of the main shield to the height of the smaller shields in the crown is 1:2.5, and of the width of the field of the main shield to the width of the smaller shields in the crown is 1:1. The oldest known coat of arms of Croatia contains in a shield on a light blue field a yellow (golden) six-pointed star with a white (silver) crescent. Coat of arms of the Republic of Dubrovnik contains in a shield on a blue field two red bars. The Dalmatian arms contain in a shield on a light blue field three yellow (golden) crowned leopard heads. The Istrian arms contain in a shield on a blue field a yellow (golden) goat facing left with red hooves and horns. The Slavonian arms contain on a light blue field two horizontal white (silver) bars, between bars a red field, on which sneaks a weasel to the left. In the upper light blue field is a yellow (golden) six-pointed star. The coat of arms is lined red. ==History== The checkerboard coat of arms (\u0161ahovnica) is first attested as an official symbol of the Kingdom of Croatia on an Innsbruck tower depicting the emblem of Maximilian I, Archduke of Austria in 1495.Karl-Heinz Hesmer: Chronik griffbereit: Flaggen und Wappen der Welt. Wissen Media Verlag GmbH, 2008. .Ottfried Neubecker: Wappen \u2013 ihr Ursprung, Sinn und Wert, It appeared on a seal from the Cetingrad Charter that confirmed the 1527 election of Ferdinand I, Archduke of Austria as king of Croatia in Cetin.Robert Stallaerts: Historical dictionary of Croatia. Scarecrow Press, Inc. 2010. Robert Layton, Julian Thomas, Peter G. Stone: Destruction and conservation of cultural property. Routledge, 2001. . Under the Hungarian kings and well after the Council of Constance, as shown in the works of Ulrich of Richenthal and Conrad Gr\u00fcnenberg, the Croatian coat of arms was an arm dexter holding a dagger (possibly alluding to Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107). The origin of the design has often been purported as being medieval. Historic tradition states it to be the arms of Stephen Dr\u017eislav in the 10th century.Bellamy, Alex J. (2003). The Formation of Croatian National Identity: A Centuries-old Dream. Manchester University Press. p. 36. . A Split stone baptistry from the time of Peter Kre\u0161imir IV (r. 1058\u20131074/5) has engraved falcons that carry something that resembles a chequy on their wings, and the bell tower of the medieval Church of St. Lucy, Jurandvor has a checkerboard pattern carved onto it. The size of the checkerboard ranges from 3\u00d73 to 8\u00d78, but most commonly 5\u00d75, like in the current design. It was traditionally conjectured that the colours originally represented Red Croatia and White Croatia, but there is no historical evidence to support this. Towards the Late Middle Ages the distinction for the three crown lands (Croatia proper, Dalmatia, Slavonia) was made. The \u0161ahovnica was used as the coat of arms of Croatia proper & together with the shields of Slavonia and Dalmatia was often used to represent the whole of Croatia in Austria-Hungary. It was used as an unofficial coat of arms of the Kingdom of Croatia adopted in 1848 and as an official coat of arms of the post-1868 Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia (both unofficially known as Triune Kingdom). The two are the same except for the position of the \u0161ahovnica and Dalmatian coat of arms which are switched around & with different crowns used above the shield \u2013 the later employing St Stephen's crown (associated with Hungarian kings). By late 19th century \u0161ahovnica had come to be considered a generally recognized symbol for Croats and Croatia and in 1919, it was included in the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) to represent Croats. When the Banovina of Croatia was formed, the \u0161ahovnica (chequy gules and argent) was retained as the official symbol. The Ustashe regime which had ruled Croatia during the World War II superimposed their ideological symbol, the letter \"U\" above or around the \u0161ahovnica (upper left square white) as the official national symbol during their rule. After the Second World War, the new Socialist Republic of Croatia became a part of the federal Second Yugoslavia. The \u0161ahovnica was included in the new socialist coat of arms.Jonas Frykman, Jonas Frykman G\u00f6sta Arvastson: Ethnologia Europaea, Volume 26, 1995. It was designed in the socialist tradition, including symbols like wheat for peasants and an anvil for workers, as well as a rising sun to symbolize a new morning and a red star for communism. During the change to multiparty elections in Croatia (as part of the collapse of Communist rule in Eastern Europe from the late 1980s), and prior to the establishment of the current design, the \u0161ahovnica, shedding the communist symbols that were the hallmark of Croatia in the second Yugoslavia, reappeared as a stand-alone symbol as both the 'upper left square red' and 'upper left square white' variants. The choice of 'upper left square red' or 'upper left square white' was often dictated by heraldic laws and aesthetic requirements. The first-field-white variant was adopted by the Republic of Croatia and used briefly in 1990. According to constitutional changes which came into effect on 26 June 1990 the red star in the flag of SR Croatia was to be replaced by the \"historical Croatian coat of arms with 25 red and white fields\", without specifying order of fields. The first-field-white variant was used at the official flag hoisting ceremony on 25 July and was later occasionally used on par with the first-field-red variant until 21 December 1990 when the current coat of arms was officially adopted. ==Current design== On 21 December 1990, the post-socialist government of Croatia, passed a law prescribing the design created by the graphic designer Miroslav \u0160utej, under the aegis of a commission chaired by Nik\u0161a Stan\u010di\u0107, then head of the Department of Croatian History at the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Zagreb. The new design added the five crowning shields which represent the regions of Croatia. They are, from left to right: {| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5px\" border=\"0\" class=\"noresize\" |- | 90px | Considered the oldest known symbol representing Croatia: Bleu celeste, a mullet of six points Or surmounted above a crescent Argent \u2013 A golden six-pointed star (representing the morning star) over a silver crescent moon on a blue shield. The oldest known example is found on the obverse side of the Croatian Frizatiks minted by Andrew II as Duke of Croatia (Latin: Dux Croatiae).Croatian National Bank First Croatian money (in Croatian), accessed 24 July 2013Croatian National Bank Croatian Frizatik (picture), accessed 24 July 2013Croatian Internet Portal in Switzerland Hrvatski novac u zadnjih 90 godina (in Croatian), accessed 24 July 2013 Traditionally this coat of arms was depicted on red (gules) background such as the flag of the Triune Kingdom by Josip Jela\u010di\u0107. This coat of arms was also commonly associated with the Illyrian movement. |- | 90px | Dubrovnik region \u2013 Coat of arms of Dubrovnik: Azure, two bars gules \u2013 Two red stripes on a dark blue shield. This is a simplified variation of the Coat of arms of Dubrovnik, with two red bars instead of four; it was used by Dubrovnik Republic since the 14th century. The original coat of arms is the old coat of arms of \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, granted to Dubrovnik Republic by King Louis I in 1358 as it became a vassal of the Hungarian-Croatian king.Vito Galzinski, Dr\u017eavni grbovi, page 344Zdenka Janekovi\u0107-R\u00f6mer, Okvir slobode, page 364, Jakov Lukari\u0107 \u2013 Copioso ristretto degli annali di Rausa, page 155 Accessed 24 June 2013Frane \u010cizmi\u0107, Dr\u017eavni grb Dubrova\u010dke Republike, page 32Maritime Museum in Dubrovnik Accessed 24 June 2013 The red-blue variant hails from the 1950s interpretation of the template (decorative) lines within the originally white lines of the original CoA.Frane \u010cizmi\u0107, Dr\u017eavni grb Dubrova\u010dke Republike, pages 22 and 32Vito Galzinski, Dr\u017eavni grbovi, pages 346 and 347 |- | 90px | Dalmatia \u2013 Coat of arms of Dalmatia: Bleu celeste, three leopards' heads affront\u00e9s caboshed Or, crowned Or \u2013 Three golden, crowned heraldic leopard heads, two over one, on a blue shield. The depicted version from the crown differs from the traditional depiction of these arms: traditionally, the leopards are roaring and langued (i.e. with tongues visible), and the colour of the shield is heraldic azure, not bleu celeste. Historically, this coat of arms was in use since at least the 14th century. The first officially recorded use goes back to King Louis I and his daughter Queen Mary who both used an earlier version of the arms as part of their personal coat of arms. Until 1526 this coat of arms was also used to represent Croatia in general, apparent from the coat of arms of several kings: Louis I, Mary, Matthias Corvinus and Louis II. It is also found on the great seals of Sigismund of Luxembourg,Szil\u00e1gyi S\u00e1ndor: A Magyar Nemzet T\u00f6rt\u00e9nete (in Hungarian) Albert II,Austria Forum Web Books Viewer Die osterreichisch-ungarische Monarchie in Wort und Bild, Ubersichtsband, 2.

Originally the coat of arms was three lion heads on red background, turned to left.Konrad von Gr\u00fcnenberg \u2013 Beschreibung der Reise von Konstanz nach Jerusalem, page 32 [13v] (in German), accessed 24 July 2013Konrad von Gr\u00fcnenberg \u2013 Wappenbuch (1602\u20131604) (in German), accessed 24 July 2013Bayerische Staatsbibliothek M\u00fcnchen Wernigeroder (Schaffhausensches) Wappenbuch, accessed 24 July 2013Gelre Armorial \u2013 Gelre Folio 52v, accessed 24 July 2013Ulrich von Richental \u2013 Chronik des Konzils zu Konstanz (Chronicle of the Council of Constance, page 343), (in German), accessed 14 February 2014 |- | 90px | Istria \u2013 Coat of arms of Istria: Azure, a goat (capricorn) statant Or, attired and hoofed Gules \u2013 Golden goat (capricorn) with red hooves and horns, on a dark blue shield. The goat as a symbol of Istria is claimed to be associated with Istria since ancient times.Hr\u010dak \u2013 Portal znanstvenih \u010dasopisa Republike Hrvatske Goat on the Istrian Coat of Arms, accessed 24 July 2013The FAME Istria County Coat of Arms, accessed 28 July 2013 However the origins of this coat of arms are unclear and until the 19th century there was no official symbol of Istria.Istarska Enciklopedija: Grb Istre The first depictions are found on the maps of Johann Weikhard von Valvasor in the 17th century and later in Stemmatographia sive armorum Illyricorum delineatio, descriptio et restitutio (1701) by Pavao Ritter Vitezovi\u0107. It was only in 1861 when the March of Istria became the Crown land in the Austrian Empire that this coat of arms became official. Traditional depictions of the arms differed greatly depending on the authors: mostly depicted on a blue but sometimes also on green background, colors (tinctures) of the charge (goat \u2013 sometimes with gold and sometimes with red hooves and horns), position or attitude of the goat \u2013 sometimes shown as passant (passing with front leg up) and sometimes statant (standing with all four legs on the ground), orientation of the charge \u2013 sometimes turned to right and sometimes to left (dexter and sinister) and even the charge itself with some variants showing a female goat and some a Capricorn (male goat).Slovenska heraldika \u2013 Grb Istre (in Slovenian)Koza u grbu Istre: prilog poznavanju povijesne pozadine grba i istarskog kozarstva \u2013 Jagoda Vondra\u010dek-Mesar (in Croatian) The current variant used in the crest and also as the coat of arms of County of Istria are both derived from the March of Istria arms from 1861 by Hugo Gerard Str\u00f6hl. |- | 90px | Slavonia \u2013 Coat of arms of Slavonia: Bleu celeste, a fess Gules fimbriated Argent surmounted by a mullet of six points Or, a marten Sable courant proper in chief \u2013 Six-pointed star (morning star) above two silver stripes on a blue shield (representing the rivers Drava and Sava marking the Northern and Southern border of Slavonia), between them a running Pine marten in natural colors (Kuna in Croatian \u2013 note the national currency Croatian kuna) on a red field. Historically correct version of the arms uses a heraldic blue rather than light blue (Bleu celeste). This coat of arms was derived from an earlier version found on Slavonian Banovac coins minted between 1235 and 1384,Ivan Bojni\u010di\u0107-Kninski \u2013 Grbovnica kraljevine \"Slavonije\", (1895) \u2013 PDF file (in Croatian), accessed 28 February 2014 which showed a marten running on a field between two six-pointed stars.Matica Hrvatska HRVATSKA NOV\u010cARSKA BA\u0160TINA (in Croatian), accessed 24 July 2013 The coat of arms was officially granted by king Vladislaus II Jagiellon on December 8, 1496.Matica Hrvatska Hrvatski grb u mijenama hrvatske povijesti (in Croatian), accessed 24 July 2013 It was used as the official seal of Croatian Sabor from 1497 until the late 18th century. |} Some of the more traditional heraldic pundits have criticized the latest design for various design solutions, such as adding a crown to the coat, varying shades of blue in its even fields, and adding the red border around the coat. The government has accepted their criticism insofar as not accepting further non-traditional designs for the county coats of arms, but the national symbol has remained intact. Unlike in many countries, Croatian design more commonly uses symbolism from the coat of arms, rather than from the Croatian flag. This is partly due to the geometric design of the shield which makes it appropriate for use in many graphic contexts (e.g. the insignia of Croatia Airlines or the design of the shirt for the Croatia national football team), and partly because the Pan-Slavic colors are present in many European flags. ===Historical versions of the crown arms=== Most coats of arms used in the crown on the modern-day coat of arms differ slightly from historically accurate versions.
