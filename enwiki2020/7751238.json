It is an experimental song done in a doom metal style, using some death metal vocals. Halls of Amenti was intended to be the first in a series of three. The second release, titled Antarctica: Journey to Amenti, has not been released. The story revolves around a planet being turned into a block of ice, with its inhabitants eventually becoming allergic to the sun's rays, having to live underground to retain warmth. When the planet eventually begins thawing, the inhabitants are finally forced to face the deadly light.
