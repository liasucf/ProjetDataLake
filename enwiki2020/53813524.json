    "text": "The Venezuelan Andes montane forests (NT0175) is an ecoregion in the northern arm of the Andes in Venezuela. It contains montane and cloud forests, reaching up to the high-level Cordillera de Merida p\u00e1ramo high moor ecoregion. The forests are home to many endemic species of flora and fauna. Their lower levels are threatened by migrant farmers, who clear patches of forest to grow crops, then move on. ==Geography== ===Location=== The Venezuelan Andes montane forests ecoregion covers most of the Venezuelan states of M\u00e9rida and Trujillo, much the state of T\u00e1chira and the highlands of the states of Lara and Barinas. It includes a small area in Colombia. It covers the lower part of the Venezuelan extension of the Cordillera Occidental of the northern Andes. It has an area of . To the southeast it adjoins the Llanos and the Apure- Villavicencio dry forests, and to the southwest adjoins the Cordillera Oriental montane forests. To the northwest it adjoins the Catatumbo moist forests and the Maracaibo dry forests. To the north it merges into Paraguana xeric scrub and La Costa xeric shrublands. It contains areas of Cordillera de Merida p\u00e1ramo on the higher ground. ===Terrain=== The Venezuelan Andes montane forests ecoregion contains the high altitude cloud forests of the Venezuelan Andean Cordillera, which reaches altitudes of .. This is a northeastern branch of the Andes that is separated from Colombia's Cordillera Oriental by the T\u00e1chira depression on the Venezuela\u2013Colombia border. The ecoregion extends from the T\u00e1chira depression for about in a northeast direction to the Barquisimeto depression. The ecoregion also includes the forests of the isolated Tam\u00e1 Massif, which lies between the Colombian Andes and the T\u00e1chira depression. The mountains were formed during the Paleocene epoch and continued rising until the end of the Pliocene epoch. They are mainly composed of quartzite schist, gneiss and limestone, with isolated intrusions of granite and diabase. The soils are mostly inceptisols, but entisols are often found in slopes and eroded areas. The rivers that form near the summits create large valleys that form physiographical barriers between the ranges of the Cordillera. The largest, the Chama, crosses the northeast\u2013southwest axis of the middle part of the Cordillera, dividing into the Cordillera de M\u00e9rida to the south and the Sierra de la Culata to the north. Other major rivers are the Santo Domingo, Bocon\u00f3 and Motat\u00e1n. ==Climate== Climate zones. The coolest areas are the p\u00e1ramos (dark blue and purple). The K\u00f6ppen climate classification is \"Cfb\": warm temperate, fully humid, warm summer. From in elevation the average annual temperatures are . Temperatures are lower above this elevation. The northeastern trade winds strongly affect the climate. There is a dry season from December to April and a wet season from April to November when moisture is carried from the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Average annual rainfall is , but varies considerably from place to place. Along the southeastern slopes high rainfall starts above , while along the northwest slopes high rainfall starts at . Slopes in the interior valleys are dry, and often very dry. ==Ecology== The Venezuelan Andes montane forests ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm, in the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. The ecoregion forms an ecological barrier between the Lake Maracaibo region and the Llanos. It has a great variety of plants, many endemic, and is seen as a plant refuge and dispersal center. ===Flora=== Sierra de La Culata, Edo. M\u00e9rida Vegetation includes evergreen transition forests between and and evergreen cloud forests higher up. The evergreen transition forests are dense, with two or three layers, with most trees of the families Lauraceae, Moraceae, Myrtaceae, Bignoniaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Araliaceae. From there are very dense cloud forests with two or three layers, many epiphytes and a rich understory. Common species are Retrophyllum rospigliosii, Prumnopitys montana, Podocarpus oleifolius, Alnus jorullensis, Oreopanax moritzii, Brunellia integrifolia, Hedyosmum glabratum, Weinmannia jahnii, Weinmannia microphylla, Tetrorchidium rubrivenium, Beilschemieda sulcata, Ruagea glabra and Ruagea pubescens. The montane forests and p\u00e1ramos of M\u00e9rida have 155 endemic plant species, and contains 30% of the ecoregion's endemic flora. The forests and p\u00e1ramos of the isolated Tam\u00e1 massif have another 82 endemic plant species. Common montane forest endemic plants are Podocarpus pedulifolius, Oreopanax veillonii, Psychotria aristeguiateae, Lagenanthus princeps, Delostoma integrifolium, as well as bromeliad, fern and orchid species. ===Fauna=== crab-eating rat (Ichthyomys hydrobates) There are four endemic mammal species in the ecoregion. The wood sprite gracile opossum (Gracilinanus dryas) and Luis Manuel's tailless bat (Anoura luismanueli) are found in both the Andean Cordillera and the Tam\u00e1 Massif. The dressy Oldfield mouse (Thomasomys vestitus) is found only in the Andean Cordillera. Musso's fish-eating rat (Neusticomys mussoi) has been reported for just one place in the Andean Cordillera. Mammal subspecies found only in the montane forests ecoregion and the Cordillera de M\u00e9rida P\u00e1ramo ecoregion include the Andean white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus goudotii), found in the ecotone between the high montane forests and the p\u00e1ramos, and the rufous little red brocket (Mazama rufina bricenii), found in evergreen forest and p\u00e1ramos from . Both deer species are endangered by hunting. In the forest margins beside the p\u00e1ramos the crab-eating rat (Ichthyomys hydrobates), which is restricted to the Andes in Venezuela and Colombia, is threatened by changes to its habitat, and the pacarana (Dinomys branickii), widespread in the Andes, is threatened by hunting. The endangered spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus) is found throughout the Andes from Bolivia to Venezuela. In Venezuela it is found between in the Andes and Serran\u00eda del Perij\u00e1, most often in cloud forests between . It has low rates of reproduction and is threatened by hunting and destruction of habitat. Endangered mammals include Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) and Musso's fish-eating rat (Neusticomys mussoi). grey- capped hemispingus (Hemispingus reyi) 25 endemic birds species with restricted ranges are reported in the ecoregion of which four are found only in the montane forest ecoregion. There are fewer species at higher levels and fewest in the p\u00e1ramos. Endemic birds include amethyst-throated sunangel (Heliangelus amethysticollis), grey-capped hemispingus (Hemispingus reyi), white-fronted whitestart (Myioborus albifrons), grey-naped antpitta (Grallaria griseonucha), rose-crowned parakeet (Pyrrhura rhodocephala) and M\u00e9rida flowerpiercer (Diglossa gloriosa). Restricted range species in the Tam\u00e1 massif include T\u00e1chira antpitta (Grallaria chthonia), hooded antpitta (Grallaricula cucullata) and Venezuelan wood quail (Odontophorus columbianus). Endangered birds include helmeted curassow (Pauxi pauxi), red siskin (Spinus cucullatus) and black-and-chestnut eagle (Spizaetus isidori). The salamander species Bolitoglossa orestes is endemic. The ecoregion is rich in endemic frog species, with 62 species in the Cordillera de M\u00e9rida alone, many endemic to the cloud forests. The most common families are Eleutherodactylus and Centrolenidae. They live between in the cloud forests and beside streams in very humid p\u00e1ramos. Endangered amphibians include Aromobates alboguttatus, A. duranti, A. haydeeae, A. leopardalis, A. mayorgai, A. meridensis, A. molinarii, A. nocturnus, A. orostoma, A. saltuensis, A. serranus, Atelopus carbonerensis, A. chrysocorallus, A. mucubajiensis, A. oxyrhynchus, A. pinangoi, A. sorianoi, Dendropsophus meridensis, Gastrotheca ovifera, Hyalinobatrachium pallidum, Mannophryne collaris, M. cordilleriana, M. yustizi, Pristimantis ginesi, P. lancinii and P. paramerus. ==Status== The World Wildlife Fund gives the ecoregion the status \"Vulnerable\". The low to mid-altitude montane forests are being invaded by migrant farmers, who fragment the habitat. This is the main threat, but extraction of valuable orchids and bromeliads is also an issue. Requests, so far refused, have been made for permits to mine for zinc, cooper, lead and silver in the Bailadores\u2013Guaraque region, including the General Pablo Pe\u00f1alosa National Park. Coal mining in the T\u00e1chira depression may threaten the adjacent Tam\u00e1 Masif. 20.78% of the ecoregion is protected. Venezuelan national parks that protect parts of the ecoregion include the Guaramacal National Park, Sierra Nevada National Park, Sierra La Culata National Park, General Juan Pablo Pe\u00f1aloza National Park, Dinira National Park and Yacamb\u00fa National Park. The Tam\u00e1 National Natural Park in Colombia and the El Tam\u00e1 National Park in Venezuela protect parts of the Tam\u00e1 Massif. Some of the parks are threatened by sheer numbers of tourists, and by fires and proposed construction of roads and pipelines. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * Category:Ecoregions of Venezuela Category:Ecoregions of Colombia Category:Andean forests Category:Neotropical tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests ",
