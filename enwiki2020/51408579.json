    "text": "This article provides information on the under 19 premiership deciders of rugby league competitions held on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia. The Match Details sub-section details the individual point-scorers in a match, where known. The current competition is conducted under the auspices of the Central Coast Division Rugby League, an affiliate of NSW Country Rugby League and the New South Wales Rugby League. A predecessor to Under 18 and Under 19 competitions was C Grade, which was held from the late 1940s to 1966. When Group status was obtained in 1967, C and D Grade became Under 19 and Under 17. The following year they were changed to Under 18 and Under 16. Between 1979 and 1982 the two competitions reverted to Under 19 and Under 17. In 2000, Third Grade and Under 18s were replaced by Under 19 and Under 17 competitions. There has been an Under 19 competition in each subsequent season, apart from 2012 (two Under 18 divisions) and 2013 (Under 18 and Under 17). ==List== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Under 19 Grand Finals !
