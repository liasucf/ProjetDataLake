    "text": "The culture of Uruguay is diverse in its nature since the nation's population is one of multicultural origins. Uruguay has a legacy of artistic and literary traditions, especially for its small size. The culture of Uruguay is known to be heavily European influenced, mostly by the contribution of its alternating conquerors, Spain and Portugal. However, from the year 1857 to 1940, large waves of European immigrants began arriving to Uruguay, with the majority of the immigrants coming from Italy. Minor European immigrant groups \u2013 Frenchmen, Germans, Swiss, Russians, Jews, and Armenians, among others \u2013 as well migrated to Uruguay. With the settlement of the European immigrants, this has resulted in traditions that integrate this diversity with the indigenous people or Charr\u00faa elements. Uruguay has century-old remains and fortresses of the colonial era. Its cities have a rich architectural heritage, and a number of writers, artists, and musicians. Carnaval and candombe are the most important examples of African influence by slaves, as well as Umbanda religious beliefs and practices. Guarani traditions can be seen in the national drink, mate. The culture in Uruguay is very similar to that of the culture of Argentina. ==Visual arts== ===Painting and sculpture=== The Casapueblo, one of Carlos P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3 most famous art piece Well-known Uruguayan painters include realists such as Juan Manuel Blanes, constructivists such as Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda, nativists like Carlos Mar\u00eda Herrera, post-impressionists such as Pedro Figari and Felipe Seade, abstract artists such as Carlos P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3, and numerous others. Jos\u00e9 Belloni: The Struggle, 1965 Well-known sculptors include realists Pablo Atchugarry, Jos\u00e9 Belloni, and Jos\u00e9 Luis Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn, as well as contemporary sculptors such as Juan Jos\u00e9 Calandria, \u00c1gueda Dicancro, Hugo Nantes, Claudio Silveira Silva, Mariv\u00ed Ugolino, and Carlos P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3, who created an internationally renowned \"livable sculpture\", Casapueblo. ===Architecture=== Due to European migration, new forms of art and design started to enter during the formation of Uruguay. Many buildings in Uruguay are European influenced, for example, the Palacio Salvo was designed by Italian architect Mario Palanti. Many well recognized architects around the world are Uruguayan. Some famous Uruguayan architects include Juan Antonio Scasso, Juan Giuria, Leopoldo Artucio, Eladio Dieste, and Carlos Ott. Rafael Vi\u00f1oly is a Uruguayan architect known for his most recognized project being the 432 Park Avenue in New York City. The building stands at 1,396 feet (425.5 m) with 96 floors, making it the tallest residential building in the world. He is also credited for designing other buildings such as the Tokyo International Forum, Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, and Uruguay's international airport Carrasco International Airport. ==Modern society== ===Immigration=== A map showing European immigration around the world, with the majority of Uruguay (and parts of Argentina and southern Brazil, respectively) having more than 90% of European ancestry Among the several peoples who settled Uruguay and formed the backbone of its society must be highlighted Spaniards and Italians, together with some descendants of African slaves. While Spaniards being the greatest contributor to other South American countries, Italians are arguably the greatest contributor to Uruguay. There are also significant minorities: Armenians, Austrians, Basque, Britons, Bulgarians, Croats, French, Germans, Greeks, Gypsies, Hungarians, Irish, Scots, Jews, Lebanese, Lithuanians, Poles, Russians, Slovaks, Slovenes, Swiss, and Ukrainians. There are very small Asian communities, mainly from China, Japan and Korea. ===Languages=== Spanish is the official language of Uruguay, and is spoken by almost all of the population. The Spanish spoken in Uruguay is more commonly known as Rioplatense Spanish, the same Spanish that is spoken in parts of Argentina. Rioplatense Spanish is known by many in South America as Spanish spoken with an Italian accent, due to Italian effects on modern day Uruguayan society. Minority languages in Uruguay include Italian, French, German, Hebrew, and other European languages. English is also considered a minority language, though it is more used in the business world. Other languages include Portuguese and Portu\u00f1ol, a mixture of Spanish and Portuguese (pidgin language). Both are present in northern regions near the Brazilian border. ===Gestures=== Uruguayan gestures are mostly adopted from Southern European culture, with hand gestures and tones being all used commonly throughout the country. A gesture that is only specifically used in Argentina and Uruguay is males kissing other males on the cheek, sometimes both cheeks, as a way of greeting. For the rest of Latin America, kissing on cheek as a form of greeting is mostly towards a male and female, or a female to another female. ==Popular culture== ===Music=== The Tango, which originated in the areas of Argentina and Uruguay Uruguayans enjoy music such as tango, folk, and waltz as well as local forms such as candombe, milonga and murga. Both tango and candombe have been recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Uruguay's annual Carnival is a major event with many unique features distinguishing it from those of its neighbours. Rock, jazz, pop and other international genres also enjoy great popularity in Uruguay. ===Motion pictures=== The first Uruguayan motion picture is \"Carrera de bicicletas en el vel\u00f3dromo de Arroyo Seco\". The film was directed by F\u00e9lix Oliver, the pioneer of cinematography in Uruguay. The best reviewed Uruguayan movie is the 2004 film, Whisky. Directed by Juan Pablo Rebella and Pablo Stoll, with a starring cast of Andr\u00e9s Pazos, Mirella Pascual, and Jorge Bolani, it was well-received by film critics. ===Smoking=== Roughly 1/3 of Uruguayan adults smoke tobacco, according to Uruguayan research groups. On March 1, 2006, a law went into effect banning smoking in all enclosed public spaces in Uruguay, including restaurants and bars, among the toughest smoking bans worldwide and the strictest in Latin America. The penalty for businesses that allow smoking is a fine of roughly US $1,100 or a three-day closure. One opinion poll found that 70% of smokers supported the ban. Current President of Uruguay, Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez, is a medic doctor specializing in cancer treatment. ==Literature== Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3 One of Uruguay's most famous works of literature is Ariel by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3 (1871\u20131917). Written in 1900, the book deals with the need to maintain spiritual values while pursuing material and technical progress. Florencio S\u00e1nchez (1875\u20131910) wrote plays about social problems that are still performed today. Juan Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn (1855\u20131931) wrote epic poems about Uruguayan history (notably Tabar\u00e9). Juana de Ibarbourou (1895\u20131979) and Delmira Agustini (1866\u20131914) were also notable poets. The Generaci\u00f3n del 45 (Generation of '45) were of group of writers, mainly from Uruguay, who were famously known to have an influence on literature and culture of the region. Well-known writers belonged to this group such as Mario Benedetti, Amanda Berenguer, Juan Carlos Onetti, Mauricio M\u00fcller, Humberto Megget, Armon\u00eda Somers, Idea Vilari\u00f1o, Emir Rodr\u00edguez Monegal, Carlos Maggi, Zenobia Camprub\u00ed and among others. ==Religion== Uruguay is South America's most secular country, meaning the importance of religion doesn't really apply to the majority of citizens. It has no official religion and church and state are separate. Religious freedom is guaranteed. The largest religion in Uruguay are the Roman Catholics, making about 66% of the population. Most Uruguayans baptize their children and marry in churches, but don't attend church that often. There is an estimated amount of 20,000 Jews in Uruguay, making it one of the most largest Jewish communities in South America and in the world. Most Jews in Uruguay are Sephardi Jews, followed by Ashkenazim, Mizrahim, and Italkim. During European migration to South America, many German Jews and Italian Jews migrated to Uruguay. There are also several Evangelical Protestant groups, making 2% of the Uruguayan population. Macumba and Umbanda, religions of Afro-Brazilian origin, are currently the fastest-growing religions in Uruguay. There are a few Christian missionary organizations in Uruguay, such as Serve the City (Run by Matthew Daniels). There is also a number of Jehovah's Witnesses, with 11,825 publishers and 156 congregations located within the country. ==Cuisine== The invigorating yerba mate in its gourd with thermos. It is a fixture in Uruguayan daily life. Uruguayans rival only neighboring Argentina in their consumption of beef, primarily at gatherings known in the continent as the asado. The parrillada (beef platter), chivito (a substantial steak sandwich), and pasta are the national dishes. The latter is due to Uruguay's many Italian immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Other Uruguayan dishes include morcilla dulce (a type of blood sausage cooked with ground orange fruit, orange peel, and walnuts) and milanesa (a veal breaded cutlet similar to the German Wienerschnitzel). Snacks include ol\u00edmpicos (club sandwiches), h\u00fangaras (spicy sausage in a hot dog roll), and masas surtidas (bite-sized pastries). Typical drinks include mate, tea, cleric\u00f3 (a mixture of white wine and fruit juice), and medio y medio (part sparkling wine and part white wine). ===Wine=== Plantings of Tannat (also known in Uruguay as Harriague) have been increasing in Uruguay each year as that country's wine industry develops, and the country is considered the second most notable Tannat region after Madiran, France. The Tannat wines produced here are characterized by more elegant and softer tannins and blackberry fruit notes. Vineyards in Uruguay have begun to distinguish between the \"old vines\" that are descendants from the original cuttings brought over from Europe and the new clones being produced today. The newer vines tend to produce more powerful wines with a higher alcohol level, but less acidity and complex fruit characteristics. Some wineries utilize both vines to make blends.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 241 Harcourt Books 2001 Now the wines typically spend about 20 months in oak prior to release.J. Robinson (ed) \"The Oxford Companion to Wine\" Third Edition pg 679 Oxford University Press 2006 Today it is often blended with Pinot noir and Merlot, and is made in a variety of styles including those reminiscent of Port and Beaujolais. ==Sports== The Uruguayan National Football Team winning the 2011 edition of the Copa America, hosted by Argentina Sports in Uruguay have been a key element to the culture since the nation's independence. Football (Spanish: f\u00fatbol) is the most popular sport in Uruguay. Uruguay has won an Olympic gold medal in 1924, and another one in 1928, which were considered the most important tournaments in football, before the FIFA World Cup began in 1930, hence the four stars on the Uruguayan jersey. The first World Cup, which Uruguay won,World Soccer was held in 1930 in Montevideo. The Estadio Centenario was built for the World Cup, and serves to this day as the country's main football stadium. Uruguay also won the World Cup in 1950, beating Brazil in Rio de Janeiro at the Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3. The event has had astounding impacts on the history of the sport, due to Brazil being a heavily favoured team at that time, and is also known as the Maracanazo. Uruguay has the most Copa Am\u00e9rica titles, the most important football tournament in the South American region. Uruguay currently has 15 titles to their name, the most recent being the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica hosted by Argentina. Uruguay has two major clubs, Pe\u00f1arol and Club Nacional de Football, which both have won major tournaments both nationally and internationally. Pe\u00f1arol has won the Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n a total of 49 times, while Nacional have won the division 46 times. Pe\u00f1arol has won the Copa Libertadores, the most prestigious club tournament in South America, 5 times and Nacional have won 3 times. Both teams have won the Intercontinental Cup a total of 3 times (which is the present day FIFA Club World Cup). In September 2009, Pe\u00f1arol was chosen as the South American Club of the Century by the IFFHS. Uruguayans are internationally known in the football world and have produced some of the biggest names of the sport. Some names include: *Enzo Francescoli *Juan Alberto Schiaffino *Hector Scarone *Diego Forl\u00e1n *Luis Su\u00e1rez *\u00c1lvaro Recoba *Jose Nasazzi *Diego God\u00edn *Edinson Cavani *Diego Lugano *Alcides Ghiggia *Antonio Pacheco D'Agosti *Ladislao Mazurkiewicz *Paolo Montero Other popular sports in Uruguay include athletics, auto racing, basketball, boxing, cycling, field hockey, fishing, golf, handball, mountaineering, padel tennis, polo, roller hockey, rowing, rugby union, sailing, skiing, swimming, tennis and volleyball. ==References== ==External links== * Uruguayan Government Portal * Uruguayan writers in Centro Virtual Cervantes ",
