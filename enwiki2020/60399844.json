    "text": "Crateuas or Cratevas, nicknamed the Rhizotomist (Evidence of spelling in \u201eDe materia medica, Dioscurides Pedianus, De materia medica, Wellmann, Weidmann, 1958\u201c) was a Greek doctor and pharmacologist who lived around 100 BC.

Krateuas is in the top left hand corner next to Galen.Der Wiener Dioskurides: Codex medicus Graecus 1 der \u00d6sterreichischen Nationalbibliothek. Graz: Akademische Druck- und Verlagsanstalt 1998 (Glanzlichter der Buchkunst) p. 18, Kommentar von Otto Mazal Lamb's tongue in the Vienna Dioscurides (Sheet 29v), an example of a possible copy from Krateuas' manuscripts. == Life and works == Crateuas was the personal physician of Mithridates VI of Pontus (reigned 120\u201363 BC). He wrote a three-part Herbal in which he described the medicinal properties of plants. He produced a second, popular edition with colour images, in which the plants were arranged in alphabetical order. This is the first known Herbal to have included images of the plants and was the model for very many later works of the same sort. To date, only two papyrus fragments of this work are known.Die Botanik in der Antike. Pliny the Elder records that Crateuas painted images of the plants and listed their effects below the images.Naturalis historia, 25, 8.Arzneimittellehre des Dioskurides. Crateuas' book was one of the main sources for Pedanius Dioscorides. In some of the tables of the \"Vienna Dioscurides\", the images are captioned by short texts beginning with the name of Crateuas. An image taken from Crateuas is found in Table 3 of the Vienna Dioscurides.Maria Przybylo: Dioskurides: De materia medica. In the 16th century, an illustrated manuscript of Crateuas is said to have still existed in Constantinople. Luigi Anguillara claimed to have used this manuscript in drawing up his 1561 work, Semplici.Luigi Anguillara. Semplici, liquali in piu pareri a diversi nobili nomini scritti appajano.

Leipzig 1846, p. 593 Digitised by the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek However, (1897) was able to prove that a Latin version of Dioscurides was the source of Anguillara's work. Wellmenn also suggested that a large number of the plant images in the Vienna Dioscurides were copied from manuscripts of Crateuas dating to the 2nd or 3rd centuries AD. Charles Singer's studies supported this suggestion.Charles Singer. \"The Herbal in the Antiquity.\" The Journal of Hellenic Studies. 47 (1927) pp. 1\u201352. == Honorific Taxon == Carl Linnaeus named the genus Crateva of the plant family Capparaceae (capers) in honour of CrateuasCarl von Linn\u00e9: Critica Botanica.
