From the late 11th century, when the Byzantine fleets were amalgamated into a single force under the megas doux, the post, now known as the Grand droungarios of the Fleet (\u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5, megas droungarios tou stolou), became the second-in-command of the megas doux and continued in this role until the end of the Byzantine Empire. ==Background and history of the office== Seal of Niketas, magistros, droungarios tou basilikou plo\u00efmou and katepan\u014d t\u014dn plo\u00efm\u014dn (late 9th/early 10th century) In response to the Muslim conquests, some time in the latter half of the 7th century, the bulk of the Byzantine navy was formed into a single command, the great fleet of the Karabisianoi (, \"the Ships' Men\"), commanded, like the land themes that appeared around the same time, by a strat\u0113gos (strat\u0113gos t\u014dn karab\u014dn/karabisian\u014dn, \"general of the ships/ships' men\"). The Karabisianoi, however, proved inadequate and were replaced in the early 8th century by a more complex system composed of three elements, which, with minor alterations, survived until the 11th century: a central fleet based at Constantinople; a few regional naval commands, namely the maritime Theme of the Cibyrrhaeots and a number of independent commands under a droungarios, which eventually evolved into the maritime themes of the Aegean Sea and of Samos in the course of the 9th century; and a greater number of local squadrons in the land themes, charged with purely defensive and police tasks and subordinate to the local thematic governors. A fleet was based in Constantinople at least since the 7th century, and indeed played a central role in the repulsion of the two Arab sieges of Constantinople in 674\u2013678 and 717\u2013718, but the exact date of the establishment of the Imperial Fleet (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, basilikos stolos, or \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03bd \u03c0\u03bb\u03cc\u03ca\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd, basilikon plo\u00efmon) as a distinct command is unclear. The Irish historian J. B. Bury, followed by the French Byzaninist Rodolphe Guilland, considered it \"not improbable\" that the Imperial Fleet existed as a subordinate command under the strat\u0113gos t\u014dn karabisian\u014dn already in the 7th century. Certainly the droungarios of the Fleet first appears in the Taktikon Uspensky of ; and as there is little evidence for major fleets operating from Constantinople during the 8th century, the Greek Byzantinist H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Ahrweiler dated the fleet's creation to the early 9th century. From that point on, the Imperial Fleet formed the main naval reserve force and provided the core of various expeditionary fleets. The droungarios of the Fleet Niketas Ooryphas punishes the Cretan Saracens, as depicted in the Madrid Skylitzes. In the Taktikon Uspensky, the droungarios of the Fleet is positioned relatively lowly in the hierarchy, coming after all the senior military and civilian officials, placed between the pr\u014dtostrat\u014dr and the ek pros\u014dpou of the themes. By the time of the 899 Kl\u0113torologion of Philotheos, however, he had risen considerably in importance, being placed variously either immediately before or after the logothet\u0113s tou dromou and in the 35th or 38th position of the overall hierarchy, ahead of the domestikoi of the guard regiments (tagmata) of the Hikanatoi and the Noumeroi, as well as of the various chartoularioi (civil department heads). Indeed, he was not classed with the other military commanders, whether of the themes or of the tagmata, but in the special class of military officials, the stratarchai, where he is listed second, after the hetaireiarch\u0113s, the commander of the imperial bodyguard. This rise coincided with the revival in the Byzantine navy's fortunes, begun under Michael III () but carried to fruition under the first two emperors of the Macedonian dynasty, Basil I the Macedonian () and Leo VI the Wise (). The Kl\u0113torologion further lists his subordinate officials as comprising his deputy or topot\u0113r\u0113t\u0113s (\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2), the secretary or chartoularios (\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2), the head messenger or pr\u014dtomandat\u014dr and the other messengers (\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2, mandatores), the commanders of squadrons or kom\u0113tes (\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2; sing. \u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2, kom\u0113s), and the centurions of the individual ships (\u03ba\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9, kentarchoi; sing. \u03ba\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, kentarchos). In addition, there was a kom\u0113s t\u0113s hetaireias (\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f11\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2), whose function is disputed: according to Bury, he probably commanded the foreign mercenaries, especially Rus' or Scandinavians, who served as marines, but the Greek historian Nicolas Oikonomides considered him the head of the droungarios personal guard. According to the De Ceremoniis of Emperor Constantine VII (), he also had a role in imperial ceremonies, often in association with the droungarios t\u0113s vigl\u0113s. Typical dignities associated with the post where the senior ranks of pr\u014dtospatharios, patrikios, and anthypatos. The office reached its heyday during the 10th century, when several important personages held it, most notably Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos (), who used it as a springboard to the throne. The office continued in the 11th century, but as the fleet was no longer very active, the droungarios chiefly commanded the Constantinopolitan fleet instead of leading expeditions; the title was now usually referred to as droungarios tou stolou (\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5). With the accession of Alexios I Komnenos () a major reorganization of the navy took place. With the great naval themes having suffered a long decline as military formations, Alexios gathered the remnants of the provincial fleets and amalgamated them with the Imperial Fleet into a single force based in Constantinople, and placed it under the command of the megas doux. The post of the droungarios of the Fleet remained in existence, now with the addition of the prefix megas (\"grand\"). According to the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, he \"has the same relation to the megas doux as the megas droungarios t\u0113s vigl\u0113s had to the megas domestikos\", i.e., he was the second in command. He was apparently in charge of subordinate droungarioi, who however were of very lowly rank and are rarely mentioned in the sources. Although reduced in significance in comparison to its heyday, the megas droungarios tou stolou remained important, ranking 32nd in the overall hierarchy in the Book of Offices. Pseudo-Kodinos gives his ceremonial costume at the time as follows: a gold-embroidered skiadion hat, a plain silk kabbadion kaftan, and a skaranikon (domed hat) covered in golden and lemon- yellow silk and decorated with gold wire and images of the emperor in front and rear, respectively depicted enthroned and on horseback. He bore no staff of office (dikanikion). == List of known holders == :Note: Uncertain entries are marked in italics. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" |- bgcolor=\"#FFDEAD\" |- ! width=\"18%\" | Name ! width=\"15%\" | Tenure ! width=\"18%\" | Appointed by ! width=\"44%\" | Notes ! width=\"5%\" | Refs |- | Krateros | | Michael II the Amorian | Titled exarch\u014dn tou stolou (\"leader of the fleet\") by Zonaras, perhaps the first holder of the post. | |- | John | | Michael III | Addressee of a letter by Patriarch Photios; otherwise unknown. | |- | Niketas Ooryphas | \u2013873 or 879 (?) | Michael III Basil I the Macedonian | A very successful commander, he spearheaded Basil I's naval offensive, relieving the Arab siege of Ragusa, attacking the Emirate of Bari, and scoring two major victories over the Cretan Saracens at Kardia and the Gulf of Corinth. | |- | Elias | \u2013 | Basil I the Macedonian | A pr\u014dtospatharios, he was charged by Basil with bringing the deposed Patriarch of Constantinople Ignatios to the capital in 867.
