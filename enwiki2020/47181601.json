Guadalajara won their third title after defeating Le\u00f3n 1\u20130 in the final. ==Participants== This tournament featured clubs from Liga MX who did not participate in the 2015-16 CONCACAF Champions League (Am\u00e9rica, Quer\u00e9taro, Santos Laguna and UANL) All Ascenso MX teams except FC Ju\u00e1rez and Sonora also participated, no official reason was given for the clubs' exclusion from the tournament. ==Tiebreakers== If two or more clubs are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings: # superior goal difference; # higher number of goals scored; # scores of the group matches played among the clubs in question; # higher number of goals scored away in the group matches played among the clubs in question; # best position in the Relegation table; # fair play ranking; # drawing of lots. ==Group stage== Every group is composed by four clubs, two from Liga MX and two from Ascenso MX. Instead of a traditional robin-round schedule, the clubs will play in three two-legged \"rounds\", the last one being contested by clubs of the same league. Each win gives a club 3 points, each draw gives 1 point. An extra point is awarded for every round won; a round is won by aggregated score, and if it is a tie, the extra point will be awarded to the team with higher number of goals scored away. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
