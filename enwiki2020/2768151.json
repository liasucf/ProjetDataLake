    "text": "\"Cold, Cold Heart\" is a country music and pop song recorded by Hank Williams. This blues ballad is both a classic of honky-tonk and an entry in the Great American Songbook. ==Hank Williams version== Williams adapted the melody for the song from T. Texas Tyler's 1945 recording of \"You'll Still Be in My Heart,\" written by Ted West in 1943. Despite the evidence pointing to the lyrics being written by Paul Gilley, in the Williams episode of American Masters, country music historian Colin Escott states that Williams was moved to write the song after visiting his wife Audrey in the hospital, who was suffering from an infection brought on by an abortion she had carried out at their home unbeknownst to Hank. Escott also speculates that Audrey, who carried on extramarital affairs as Hank did on the road, may have suspected the baby was not her husband's. Florida bandleader Pappy Neil McCormick claims to have witnessed the encounter: thumb The first draft of the song is dated November 23, 1950, and was recorded with an unknown band on May 5, 1951. Like his earlier masterpiece \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,\" it was released as the B-side (MGM-10904B) to \"Dear John\" (MGM-10904A), since it was an unwritten rule in the country music industry that the faster numbers sold best. \"Dear John\" peaked at #8 after only a brief four-week run on Billboard magazine's country music charts, but \"Cold, Cold Heart\" proved to be a favorite of disc jockeys and jukebox listeners, whose enthusiasm for the song catapulted it to #1 on the country music charts. Williams featured the song on his Mother's Best radio shows at the time of its release and performed the song on The Kate Smith Evening Hour on April 23, 1952, which ran from September 1951 to June 1952; the appearance remains one of the few existing film clips of the singer performing live. He is introduced by his idol Roy Acuff. Although a notorious binge drinker, Williams appears remarkably at ease on front of the cameras, with one critic noting, \"He stared at the camera during his performance of 'Cold, Cold Heart' with a cockiness and self-confidence that bordered on arrogance.\" The song would become a pop hit for Tony Bennett, paving the way for country songs to make inroads into the lucrative pop market. In the liner notes to the 1990 Polygram compilation Hank Williams: The Original Single Collection, Fred Rose's son Wesley states, \"Hank earned two major distinctions as a songwriter: he was the first writer on a regular basis to make country music national music; and he was the first country songwriter accepted by pop artists, and pop A&R; men.\" === Controversy === Music journalist Chet Flippo and Kentucky historian W. Lynn Nickell have each described how 21-year-old Kentuckian Paul Gilley wrote the lyrics, then sold them to Williams along with the rights, allowing Williams to take credit for it. Gilley also wrote the lyrics to \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" and other songs before drowning at the age of 27. ==Tony Bennett version== That same year, it was recorded in a pop version by Tony Bennett with a light orchestral arrangement from Percy Faith. This recording was released by Columbia Records as catalog number 39449. It first reached the Billboard magazine charts on July 20, 1951, and lasted 27 weeks on the chart, peaking at number 1. The popularity of Bennett's version has been credited with helping to expose both Williams and country music to a wider national audience. Allmusic writer Bill Janovitz discusses this unlikely combination: \"That a young Italian singing waiter from Queens could find common ground with a country singer from Alabama's backwoods is testament both to Williams' skills as a writer and to Bennett's imagination and artist's ear.\" Williams subsequently telephoned Bennett to say, \"Tony, why did you ruin my song?\" But that was a prank - in fact, Williams liked Bennett's version and played it on jukeboxes whenever he could. In his autobiography The Good Life, Bennett described playing \"Cold, Cold Heart\" at the Grand Ole Opry later in the 1950s. He had brought his usual arrangement charts to give to the house musicians who would be backing him, but their instrumentation was different and they declined the charts. \"You sing and we'll follow you,\" they said, and Bennett says they did so beautifully, once again recreating an unlikely artistic merger. The story of the Williams\u2013Bennett telephone conversation is often related with mirth by Bennett in interviews and on stage; he still performs the song in concert. In 1997, the first installment of A&E;'s Live By Request featuring Bennett (who was also the show's creator), special guest Clint Black performed the song, after which Bennett recounted it. Bennett re- recorded the song as a duet with Tim McGraw for the 2006 album Duets: An American Classic. A Google Doodle featured Bennett's recording of the song on its Valentine's Day doodle in February 2012. In 2012 Bennett recorded once again \"Cold, Cold Heart\" in a duet with Argentinian singer-songwriter Vicentico for Viva Duets, a studio album of Bennett in collaboration with Latin American music stars, released in October 2012. ==Notable cover versions== *Jazz singer Norah Jones included a sultry swing version on her 2002 album Come Away With Me, which was seen as \"re-introducing\" modern audiences to the song. ==Use in media== During the credits for the 2013 videogame Batman: Arkham Origins, the Joker, voiced by Troy Baker, can be heard singing the song. A quest in the 2010 post-apocalyptic open world action-RPG Fallout: New Vegas uses this song as its name. ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1951) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|United States Billboard Hot Country Singles |align=\"center\"|1 |} ==References== ==Source== * ==External links== * Category:1951 songs Category:Songs written by Hank Williams Category:Hank Williams songs Category:The Fontane Sisters songs Category:Tony Bennett songs Category:Petula Clark songs Category:Johnny Cash songs Category:Louis Armstrong songs Category:Aretha Franklin songs Category:Bill Haley songs Category:Rosemary Clooney songs Category:George Jones songs Category:Guy Mitchell songs Category:Jerry Lee Lewis songs Category:Frankie Laine songs Category:Glen Campbell songs Category:Number-one singles in the United States Category:Billboard Hot Country Songs number-one singles Category:Billboard Hot Country Songs number-one singles of the year ",
