    "text": "\"A Jury of Her Peers\", written in 1917, is a short story by Susan Glaspell, loosely based on the 1900 murder of John Hossack (not the famed abolitionist), which Glaspell covered while working as a journalist for the Des Moines Daily News. It is seen as an example of early feminist literature because two female characters are able to solve a mystery that the male characters cannot. They are aided by their knowledge of women's psychology. Glaspell originally wrote the story as a one-act play entitled Trifles for the Provincetown Players in 1916.\"A Jury of Her Peers\" Study Guide at What So Proudly We Hail Curriculum . Retrieved 15 February 2012. The story was adapted into an episode of the 1950s TV series Alfred Hitchcock Presents. It was also adapted into a 30-minute film by Sally Heckel in 1980. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. ==Plot summary== \"A Jury of Her Peers\" is about the discovery of and subsequent investigation of John Wright's murder. The story begins on a cold, windy day in fictional Dickson County (representing Dickinson County, Iowa) with Martha Hale's being abruptly called to ride to a crime scene. In the buggy is Lewis Hale, her husband, Sheriff Peters, the county sheriff, and Mrs. Peters, the sheriff's wife. She rushes out to join them in the buggy, and the group sets off. They arrive at the crime scene: the Wrights' lonesome-looking house. Immediately Mrs. Hale exhibits a feeling of guilt for not visiting her friend Minnie Foster since she married and became Mrs. Wright (the dead man's wife) twenty years prior. Once the whole group is safely inside the house, Mr. Hale is asked to describe to the county attorney what he had seen and experienced the day prior. Despite the serious circumstances, he delivers his story in a long-winded and poorly thought-out manner, tendencies he struggles to avoid throughout. The story begins with Mr. Hale's venturing to Mr. Wright's house to convince Wright to get a telephone. Upon entering the house, he finds Mrs. Wright in a delirious state and comes to learn that Mr. Wright has allegedly been strangled. The women's curious natures and very peculiar attention to minute details allow them to find evidence of Mrs. Wright's guilt and of her provocations and motives. Meanwhile, the men are unable to procure any evidence. The women find the one usable piece of evidence: the dead bird in the box. It's stated that Minnie used to love to sing and her husband took that away from her. But now finding her bird is dead, with a broken neck (with the implication that the husband killed it), it is evident Mrs. Wright killed her husband. Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters use their knowledge and experience as two \"midwestern rural women\" to understand Mrs. Wright's suffering when the only living thing around her has died. The women find justification in Mrs. Wright\u2019s actions and go about hiding what they find from the men. In the end, their obstruction of evidence will seemingly prevent a conviction. The story ends here, and does not move into the occurrences after they leave the house. == Themes == Scholars have stated that themes covered in Susan Glaspell's A Jury of Her Peers explore the concepts of good and bad, law vs justice, and the world of men vs the world of women. Scholar Leonard Mustazza has stated that in the story Glaspell explores the concept of good and bad in her writing by making the detectives out to be typical heroes of justice via their stating that they wouldn't rest until they find the murderer of John Wright. J. Madison Davis has commented on the same concept, noting that while the women's actions were not conventionally good, the cruelty inflicted by John Wright and the sheriff's choice to ignore this cruelty justify their actions and silence. Mustazza has commented on the topic of law versus justice, noting that the male characters were focused on following the law while the female characters were trying to pursue justice. He further wrote that the men's behaviors showed the differences between the characters, as they didn't acknowledge the abuse the wife suffered and instead criticized her housekeeping skills. ==References== ==External links== * *Audio dramatization *EDSITEment lesson Jury of Her Peers *\"A Jury of Her Peers\" Article in Every Week *John Hossack Murder Case Category:1927 short stories Category:American short stories Category:Works based on plays Category:Short stories adapted into films Category:Feminist short stories ",
