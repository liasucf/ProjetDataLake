Despite not being designed with indoor sport in mind, the theatre was utilised by the league due to a lack of stadium availability elsewhere in the city. The venue is unlikely to host netball again, as both clubs will move into a permanent multi-purpose facility at the Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre in 2020. ==See also== *Architecture of Sydney ==References== ==External links== * Category:2016 establishments in Australia Category:Ballrooms in Australia Category:Buildings and structures in Sydney Category:Convention centres in Australia Category:Event venues established in 2016 Category:Tourist attractions in Sydney Category:Darling Harbour Category:Boxing venues in Australia Category:Netball venues in New South Wales Category:Giants Netball Category:Modernist architecture in Australia ",
