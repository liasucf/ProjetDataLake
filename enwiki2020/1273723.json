    "text": "SAIPA () is an automaker headquartered in Tehran, Iran. The SAIPAC (an acronym for the French Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme iranienne de production des automobiles Citro\u00ebn) was established in 1965 as with 75% Iranian ownership, to assemble Citro\u00ebns under license for the Iranian market. It changed its name into SAIPA (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme iranienne de production automobile) in 1975 when the Iranian state withdrew from the company. Its products in recent years were mostly under-licensed Korean cars and its own engine and range of cars. The chief executive (president or managing director) of SAIPA is Javad Solaimani, predecessor of whom was Mohammadreza Soroush.http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=106329&sectionid;=351020102 The main subsidiaries of SAIPA Group are Saipa Diesel, Pars Khodro and Zamyad Co. SAIPA Groups' Subsidiaries SAIPA signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Malaysia's Proton to jointly develop a new compact sedan to replace the SAIPA Pride. ==Historical models== Saipa began by assembling Citro\u00ebn's two-cylinder mini car, the Dyane, in 1968. It went under the name Jyane (or Jian) in Iran. There was also a glazed panel van version of the Jyane, as well as the Baby- Brousse, a rustic little buggy in the style of a Citro\u00ebn M\u00e9hari but with a metal body. Later, a pickup version of the Jyane also appeared. The Baby- Brousse was built from 1970 until 1979. In 1975 Saipa began manufacturing licensed versions of the original Renault 5 and later the Renault 21. Production of Citro\u00ebns ended in 1980. From 1986-1998 Saipa built the Z24 pickup, a license built version of the 1970-1980 Nissan Junior with a 2.4-litre engine. In 1998 Saipa took over the Zamyad company, which then undertook the production of the Z24. Since 2003, this truck has been sold under the Zamyad brand. Renault 5 production ended in 1994 (Pars Khodro took over the production lines) and the 21 was discontinued in 1997. In 1993 a relationship with KIA began, and production of the Kia Pride commenced. Saipa's Pride is marketed under the names Saba (saloon) and Nasim (hatchback). At the 2001 Tehran Motor Show the liftback Saipa 141 was added to the lineup. This is a five-door version based on the Saba and is somewhat longer than the Nasim. The Pride series cars carry 97% local content. From 2001 to late 2010,http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/119651 Saipa produced the Citro\u00ebn Xantia under licence. Sedan models of the previous generation Kia Rio were assembled using parts imported from Korea from May 2005 to late 2012, when Saipa lost its license to produce them. In 2000, Saipa purchased 51% of Pars Khodro. It also manufactures the Citro\u00ebn C5. Other products include the Renault Tondar 90, a Renault Logan assembled by Saipa and its subsidiary Pars Khodro in a joint venture (Renault Pars), producing over 100,000 orders within a week of it going on sale in March 2007.https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070311/wl_mideast_afp/iraneconomyautofrance_070311150403 Production was launched in Venezuela in 2006 and in Syria in 2007. == Models == ===Current=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Name !Image !Introduction |- |Ario |frameless |2007 |- |Saba, Pride 111, 132, 151 |framelessPride, |alt=|center|frameless |2008 |- |Tiba |Tiba|alt=|center|frameless |2009 |- |Tiba 2 |frameless |2009 |- |Saina |Sainia|frameless |2016 |- |Quick |Quick|alt=|center|frameless |2017 |- |Shahin |Shahin|frameless |2019 |} *Changan CS35 *Kia Cerato *Pars Khodro H230 *Pars Khodro H220 *Pars Tondar and Tondar 90 *Renault Sandero *Pars Khodro H330 *Pars Khodro H320 *Renault Sandero Stepway *Pars Khodro H330 Cross *Jinbei Haise *Zamyad Z24 *Dongfeng Rich *Zamyad Padra *Iveco Azar Minibus thumb thumb thumb thumb thumb thumb thumb ===Upcoming=== *Saipa SP100 (????) *Saipa Hirkani (????) ===Former=== * Saipa 141 * Changan Eado * Pars Khodro V5 * Kia Rio * Renault Megane * Nissan New Murano * Nissan Teana * Dongfeng Rich * Nissan Roniz * Zamyad Shooka * Citro\u00ebn Xantia * Kia Pride * Pars Khodro Sepand * Citro\u00ebn Dyane * Nissan Patrol * Pars Khodro New Sepand *Sherkat Sakami Jeep CJ *Aria and Shahin *Sherkat Sakami Jeep Ahoo and Simorgh *Opel Commodore *Chevrolet Iran *Chevrolet Nova *Buick Iran *Sherkat Sakami Jeep Gladiator *Cadillac Iran *Saipa Caravan *Jeep Sahra Sepand PK1 Sepand New PK1 Aria and Shahin Jeep Ahoo and Simorugh Cadilac Iran (Seville) Nissan Patrol Renault Megane Buick Iran (Skylark) Chevrolet Nova == History == In 2000, SAIPA launched its own design, the 701 Caravan minivan, face-lifted in 2003.

Production over the succeeding three years was to reach 200,000 per year by a new subsidiary, Kashan SAIPA. The Tiba is expected to replace the Kia Pride. The share of Tiba/Miniator in SAIPA's exports will be about 20 percent by 2011. The model was originally named Miniator but was later changed to Tiba (gazelle). In 2012, a pick-up version of the SAIPA Pride was introduced as the 151. Its engine outputs roughly 68 hp and is capable of carrying 460 kg (380 kg with the LPG engine).
