This was the first time Colombia has hosted Worlds, and the first time Worlds have been in South America since 1998, when Cochabamba, Bolivia hosted the event. American Rocky Carson and Mexican Paola Longoria are the incumbent champions in men's and women's singles, respectively. Longoria was also the incumbent champion in women's doubles with Samantha Salas and they also successfully defended their title. Colombians Sebastian Franco and Alejandro Herrera will be trying to defend the Men's Doubles title that they won in Canada two years ago. ==Tournament format== The 2016 World Championships used a two-stage format to determine the World Champions. Initially, players competed in separate groups over three days. The results were used to seed players for an elimination round. Thus, there was no team competition. Team standings were based on points earned from the singles and doubles competitions. ==Events== ===Men's singles=== ===Women's singles=== ===Men's doubles=== ===Women's doubles=== ==Medal table== ==Team results== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=left style=\"background:#dfdfdf;\" |colspan=4 align=\"center\" |Final Team Standings |- ! width=30| ! width= |Men's Teamhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/iwxe9csqywg1fz0/AAAFhc3vQPcU_tmljEerFq8sa/Puntajes%20por%20Pais%20-%20Masculino.pdf?dl=0 ! width=|Women's Teamhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/iwxe9csqywg1fz0/AAB- MFh6QRd7tC-k12P_CYfHa/Puntajes%20por%20Pais%20-%20Femenino.pdf?dl=0 ! width=|Overall/Combinedhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/iwxe9csqywg1fz0/AAD396AwImXb2Mv7kbaoSKBka/Puntajes%20por%20Pais%20-%20Combinado.pdf?dl=0 |- | align=\"centre\" | 1 | USA | Mexico | Mexico |- | align=\"centre\" | 2 | Mexico | USA | USA |- | align=\"centre\" | 3 | Bolivia | Guatemala | Bolivia |- | align=\"centre\" | 4 | Canada | Canada | Canada |- | align=\"centre\" | 5 | Ecuador | Bolivia | Ecuador |- | align=\"centre\" | 6 | Colombia | Argentina | Guatemala |- | align=\"centre\" | 7 | Costa Rica, Japan | Ecuador | Argentina |- | align=\"centre\" | 8 | Bolivia | Dominican Republic | Colombia |- | align=\"centre\" | 9 | Dominican Republic | Colombia | Japan |- | align=\"centre\" | 10 | Argentina | South Korea | Dominican Republic |- | align=\"centre\" | 11 | Venezuela | Venezuela | Venezuela |- | align=\"centre\" | 12 | Guatemala | Japan | South Korea |- | align=\"centre\" | 13 | South Korea | Chile | Costa Rica |- | align=\"centre\" | 14 | Puerto Rico | Ireland | Chile |- | align=\"centre\" | 15 | India | Honduras | Honduras |- | align=\"centre\" | 16 | Honduras | Costa Rica | Ireland |- | align=\"centre\" | 17 | Chile, England | Costa Rica | Puerto Rico |- | align=\"centre\" | 18 | | | India |- | align=\"centre\" | 19 | Indonesia | | England |- | align=\"centre\" | 20 | | | Indonesia |- |} ==References== ==External links== *IRF website Category:2016 in Colombian sport Category:2016 in racquetball Category:Racquetball World Championships Category:Sport in Cali Category:International sports competitions hosted by Colombia Category:July 2016 sports events in South America ",
