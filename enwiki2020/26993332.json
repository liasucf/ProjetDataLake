    "text": "The 2006 Aprilia RX/SX 50 is a street/off-road motorcycle widely produced by Aprilia. It is powered by a six-speed, carburetor-fuelled, nikasil-lined and cast iron single-cylinder two-stroke engine manufactured by Derbi/Piaggio. == Styling and concept == The 2006 Aprilia RX/SX 50s are the renovated successors of the Aprilia RX 50 first produced in 1992; the panels and layout are based closely on the bigger displacement Aprilia RXV/SXVs. == Engine == The engine in the Aprilia SX 50 is sourced from Derbi/Piaggio (D50B0/D50B1). This engine is used in the Derbi Senda DRD/X-Race/X-Treme supermotos and crossers, as well as the 2006 onwards Derbi GPR 50 and Aprilia RS 50 road bikes. Engine parts from the crossers and supermotos can be directly swapped with one another; there are some small differences between the road bike and supermoto engine and frame which may require modification to transfer some external engine parts (exhaust, airbox etc.) == Specifications == === SX50 === 50 cc single cylinder, four-petal reed valve case induction and two-stroke injection (automix) carburetor fueled. :Engine displacement \u2013 49.76 cc :Bore/stroke \u2013 39,88\u00d740 mm :Compression ratio \u2013 11.5:1 :Clutch \u2013 Wet, multiple plate :Starting \u2013 Kickstart :Exhaust = Catalytic converter :Rotor Ignition/Generator = 85w/120w :Cooling system \u2013 Liquid-cooled :Fuel tank size = 7 litres :Fuel system \u2013 Carburetor Dell'Orto PVHA 17.5 mm ::Main jet = 102 ::Needle Jet = A13, notch #2 ::Idle jet = 30 :Transmission ::1st = 1st 11/34 ::2nd = 2nd 15/30 ::3rd = 3rd 18/27 ::4th = 4th 20/24 ::5th = 5th 22/23 ::6th = 6th 23/22 ::Primary drive = 21/78 :Sprockets ::Front = 14 Teeth ::Rear = 52 Teeth ::Overall Final Drive ratio = 14/52 :Spark plug = DENSO W27ESR-U/IW27 NGK BR9ES/BR9EG/BR9EIX ::Gap = .6-7 mm :Wheelbase = :Length = :Width = :Height = :Tires = Front: 100/80 - 17 inch; Rear: 130/70 - 17-inch === RX50 === 50 cc single cylinder, four petal reed valve case induction and two-stroke injection (automix) carburetor fueled :Engine displacement = 49.76 cc :Bore/stroke = 39,88\u00d740 mm :Compression ratio = 11.5:1 :Clutch = Wet, multiple plate :Starting = Kickstart :Exhaust = Catalytic converter :Rotor Ignition/Generator = 85w/120w :Cooling System = Liquid-cooled :Fuel Tank Size = 7 litres :Fuel System = Carburetor Dell'Orto PVHA 17.5 mm ::Main Jet = 102 ::Needle Jet = A13, notch #2 ::Idle Jet = 30 :Transmission ::1st = 1st 11/34 ::2nd = 2nd 15/30 ::3rd = 3rd 18/27 ::4th = 4th 20/24 ::5th = 5th 22/23 ::6th = 6th 23/22 ::Primary Drive = 21/78 :Sprockets ::Front = 14 Teeth ::Rear = 53 Teeth ::Overall Final Drive ratio = 14/53 :Spark Plug = DENSO W27ESR-U/IW27 NGK BR9ES/BR9EG/BR9EIX ::Gap = .6-7 mm :Wheelbase = :Length = :Width = :Height = :Tires = Front: 90/90 - 21 inch; Rear: 110/80 - 18-inch === Restriction === Restriction varies depending on the country and dealer, person, or company the bike is purchased from.
