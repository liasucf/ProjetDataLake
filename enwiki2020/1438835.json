    "text": "Sport-Club Freiburg e.V., commonly known as SC Freiburg (), is a German football club, based in the city of Freiburg im Breisgau, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. It plays in the Bundesliga, having been promoted as champions from the 2. Bundesliga in 2016. Freiburg has traditionally bounced between the first and second tier of the German football league system, leading to the fan chant, \"We go down, we go up, we go into the UEFA Cup!\" during the 1990s. Since 1954, the club's stadium has been the Schwarzwald-Stadion. Volker Finke, who was the club's manager between 1991 and 2007, was the longest-serving manager in the history of professional football in Germany. Joachim L\u00f6w, current manager of the Germany national team, is the club's second highest all-time leading goal scorer with 81 goals in 252 games during his three spells at the club, behind Nils Petersen. ==History== The club traces its origins to a pair of clubs founded in 1904: Freiburger Fu\u00dfballverein 04 was organised in March of that year; FC Schwalbe Freiburg just two months later. Both clubs underwent name changes, with Schwalbe becoming FC Mars in 1905, Mars becoming Union Freiburg in 1906, and FV 04 Freiburg becoming Sportverein Freiburg 04 in 1909. Three years later, SV and Union formed Sportclub Freiburg, at the same time incorporating the griffin head. In 1918, after the devastation of World War I, SC Freiburg entered a temporary arrangement with Freiburger FC to be able to field a full side called KSG Freiburg. The next year, SC Freiburg associated themselves with FT 1844 Freiburg as that club's football department, until 1928 when they left to enter into a stadium-sharing arrangement with PSV (Polizeisportvereins) Freiburg 1924 that lasted until 1930 and the failure of PSV. SC Freiburg then picked up again with FT 1844 Freiburg in 1938. The club played on the highest level from 1928, first in the Bezirksliga Baden, then in the Gauliga Baden, from which they were relegated in 1934. At the end of World War II, Allied occupation authorities disbanded most existing organizations in Germany, including football and sports clubs. The clubs were permitted to reconstitute themselves after about a year, but were required to take on new names in an attempt to disassociate them from the so-recent Nazi past. SC Freiburg was therefore briefly known as VfL Freiburg. By 1950, French- occupation authorities had let up enough to allow the clubs to reclaim their old identities. Finally, in 1952, SC Freiburg left FT Freiburg behind again. Historical chart of Freiburg league performance after WWII To this point, the history of the club had been characterised by only modest success. Through the 1930s, SC Freiburg played in the Bezirkliga (II), with the occasional turn in the Gauliga Baden (I), and captured a handful of local titles. After World War II, they picked up where they left off, playing in the Amateurliga S\u00fcdbaden (III). While only a small club, SC Freiburg became known for the fight and team spirit in their play. This led them to the 2. Bundesliga in 1978\u201379, which they would compete in for a decade-and-a-half before making the breakthrough to the top-flight Bundesliga in 1993\u201394 under the management of Volker Finke. In their first Bundesliga season, Freiburg narrowly avoided relegation. They made an exciting run in their second season at the top level, finishing third, just three points behind champions Borussia Dortmund. It was at this time that they were first nicknamed Breisgau-Brasilianer (literally Breisgau-Brazilians) due to their attractive style of play. SC Freiburg against Borussia Dortmund in 2012 The club's greatest success was reaching the UEFA Cup in 1995 and 2001. Freiburg's first Bundesliga relegation was in 1997 after they finished in 17th position. While they have been relegated four times since first making the Bundesliga, they have thrice won immediate promotion back to the top league, only failing to do so in 2005\u201306. It was the first time since 1992 that Freiburg played in the 2. Bundesliga for two consecutive seasons. Freiburg finished the 2006\u201307 season in fourth place in the 2. Bundesliga, missing out on the third automatic-promotion spot on goal difference to MSV Duisburg, although they won 12 of their last 16 league games. They were knocked out of the DFB-Pokal in the second round by VfL Wolfsburg on 24 October 2006. On 20 May 2007, Volker Finke resigned as the club's coach after 16 years in the job. He was succeeded by Robin Dutt, who himself left the club for Bayer Leverkusen in 2011. On 10 May 2009, Freiburg secured promotion into the Bundesliga once again, beating TuS Koblenz in an away game 5\u20132. In the 2011\u201312 season, Freiburg appeared to be unable to avoid another relegation for the most part of the season but a coaching change turned the sides fortunes around and the club eventually finished 12th and survived. Under Christian Streich, the 2012\u201313 Bundesliga season saw the club finish in fifth place, their best league standing since 1994\u201395. The fifth- place finish secured a position in the 2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League, an accomplishment that the club had not achieved since the 2001\u201302 edition of the tournament. Had Freiburg defeated Schalke 04 on the final matchday of the season, Freiburg would have leapfrogged Schalke and qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in club history. The 1\u20132 defeat to Schalke, however, saw Schalke secure fourth place in the league and qualify for the tournament instead. During the 2012\u201313 season, Freiburg also advanced to the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal for the first time in the club's history but lost to local rivals VfB Stuttgart 1\u20132 and missed the chance to play Bayern Munich in the final. In the 2014\u201315 season, after six years in the top flight, Freiburg was relegated to the 2. Bundesliga by a single point after a final-day defeat at Hannover 96. This was despite beating Bayern Munich in the second-last game. In the following season, however, the club earned its fifth promotion to the Bundesliga as league champions, with two matches to spare. The first season back in the Bundesliga saw them end 7th. This saw Freiburg qualify for the Europa League, as German cupwinners Borussia Dortmund were already qualified for the Champions League. The side were eliminated in the third qualification round against NK Dom\u017eale from Slovenia. Mostly thanks to 15 season goals by Nils Petersen, Freiburg stayed in the Bundesliga l, finishing 15th. ===Reserve team=== The club's reserve team, formerly the SC Freiburg Amateure, now SC Freiburg II, has, for the most part of its history played in the lower amateur leagues. It made a three-season appearance in the tier four Verbandsliga S\u00fcdbaden from 1983 to 1986, but then took until 1994 to return to this league. In 1998 the team won promotion to the Oberliga Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg after a league championship in the Verbandsliga. Freiburg II spent the next ten seasons at this level as an upper table side before another league championship took the team to the Regionalliga S\u00fcd. After four seasons at this league the team became part of the new Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest in 2012. After a seventh place in its first season in the league the team finished runner-up in 2013\u201314. A South Baden Cup win in 2001 qualified it for the first round of the 2001\u201302 DFB-Pokal, the German Cup, where it lost to Schalke 04. ==Stadium== Stadium interior in 2011 SC Freiburg plays its home games at the Dreisamstadion, named after the Dreisam River which flows through Freiburg. Because of sponsorship agreements, the stadium is currently known as the Schwarzwald-Stadion. The stadium has an approximate capacity of 24,000 spectators and was built in 1953. Forty years later, then manager Volker Finke began an initiative to transform the Dreisamstadion into Germany's first solar powered football stadium. There are solar modules on the north, south, and main tribunes. These panels generate 250,000 kWh of energy per year. The brand new SC-Stadion with a capacity of 34,700, located in the west of the city, is currently under construction. It is expected to be finished in 2021. ==In Europe== ===Matches=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Season ! Competition ! Round ! Club ! Home ! Away !
