Wrighte was returned as a Tory Member of Parliament for Leicester on the corporation interest at the 1727 British general election. He voted consistently against the Administration. He was returned as MP again in a contest at the 1734 British general election. His only recorded speech was made on 5 May 1738 in a debate on the Spanish depredations in America, when he exonerated the Spanish government from responsibility and deprecated measures likely to provoke Spain into war. On the motion for the dismissal of Walpole in February 1741, he was one of the Tories who withdrew. He was returned unopposed for Leicester in 1741 and 1747.
