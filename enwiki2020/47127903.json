In 1912, Sloane was a Republican Party delegate to the national convention in Chicago, Illinois, pledged to support Theodore Roosevelt for President of the United States. Sloane held the trial court office for four years, thereafter returning to the practice of the law in association with A. A. Sweet and Lewis R. Kirby. In 1898, Sloane formed a partnership with Judge Moses A. Luce, with whom he worked until 1911, when Governor Hiram Johnson appointed Sloane to the Superior Court of San Diego County. Sloane was re-elected to that office, which he held until January 1, 1919, when Governor William Stephens appointed him to the newly created Second Division of the California Court of Appeal, Second District. In April 1920, Sloane resigned from the appellate court effective May 3, 1920, to accept an appointment to the California Supreme Court, filling a vacancy caused by the death of Associate Justice Henry A.
