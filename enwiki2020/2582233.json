    "text": "The Kingdom of Croatia (, ), or Croatian Kingdom (), was a medieval kingdom in Central Europe comprising most of what is today Croatia (without western Istria and some Dalmatian coastal cities), as well as most of the modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Croatian Kingdom was ruled for part of its existence by ethnic dynasties, and the Kingdom existed as a sovereign state for nearly two centuries. Its existence was characterized by various conflicts and periods of peace or alliance with the Bulgarians, Byzantines, Hungarians, and competition with Venice for control over the eastern Adriatic coast. The goal of promoting the Croatian language in the religious service was initially introduced by the 10th century bishop Gregory of Nin, which resulted in a conflict with the Pope, later to be put down by him. In the second half of the 11th century Croatia managed to secure most coastal cities of Dalmatia with the collapse of Byzantine control over them. During this time the kingdom reached its peak under the rule of kings Peter Kre\u0161imir IV (1058\u20131074) and Demetrius Zvonimir (1075\u20131089). The state was ruled mostly by the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty until 1091. At that point the realm experienced a succession crisis and after a decade of conflicts for the throne and the aftermath of the Battle of Gvozd Mountain, the crown passed to the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty with the coronation of King Coloman of Hungary as \"King of Croatia and Dalmatia\" in Biograd in 1102, uniting the two kingdoms under one crown.Larousse online encyclopedia, Histoire de la Croatie: \"Li\u00e9e d\u00e9sormais \u00e0 la Hongrie par une union personnelle, la Croatie, pendant huit si\u00e8cles, formera sous la couronne de saint \u00c9tienne un royaume particulier ayant son ban et sa di\u00e8te.\" Clifford J. Rogers: The Oxford Encyclopedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology, Volume 1, Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 293Krist\u00f3 Gyula: A magyar\u2013horv\u00e1t perszon\u00e1luni\u00f3 kialakul\u00e1sa [The formation of Croatian-Hungarian personal union] (in Hungarian) The precise terms of the relationship between the two realms became a matter of dispute in the 19th century. The nature of the relationship varied through time, with Croatia retaining a large degree of internal autonomy overall, while the real power rested in the hands of the local nobility.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 288 Modern Croatian and Hungarian historiographies mostly view the relations between Kingdom of Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary from 1102 as a form of unequal personal union of two internally autonomous kingdoms united by a common Hungarian king.Barna Mezey: Magyar alkotm\u00e1nyt\u00f6rt\u00e9net, Budapest, 1995, p. 66 == Name == The first official name of the country was \"Kingdom of the Croats\" (; ),Ferdo \u0160i\u0161i\u0107: Povijest Hrvata u vrijeme narodnih vladara, p. 651 but over the course of time the name \"Kingdom of Croatia\" (Regnum Croatiae;Monumenta spectantia historiam Slavorum meridionalium, Edidit Academia Scienciarum et Artium Slavorum Meridionalium vol VIII, Zagreb, 1877, p. 199 Kraljevina Hrvatska) prevailed. From 1060, when Peter Kre\u0161imir IV gained control over the coastal cities of the Theme of Dalmatia, formerly under the Byzantine Empire, the official and diplomatic name of the kingdom was \"Kingdom of Croatia and Dalmatia\" (Regnum Croatiae et Dalmatiae; Kraljevina Hrvatska i Dalmacija). This form of the name lasted until the death of King Stephen II in 1091.Lujo Margeti\u0107: Hrvatska i Crkva u srednjem vijeku, Pravnopovijesne i povijesne studije, Rijeka, 2000, p. 88-92Lujo Margeti\u0107: Regnum Croatiae et Dalmatiae u doba Stjepana II., p. 19 == Background == The Slavs arrived in southeastern Europe in the early 7th century and established several states, including the Duchy of Croatia. The Christianization of the Croats began soon after their arrival and was completed by the beginning of the 9th century. The rule over the duchy alternated between the rival Domagojevi\u0107 and Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasties. The duchy was rivaled by the neighbouring Republic of Venice, fought and allied with the First Bulgarian Empire, and went through periods of vassalage to the Carolingian Empire and the Byzantine Empire. In 879, Pope John VIII recognized Duke Branimir as an independent ruler. == Kingdom == === Establishment === Croatia was elevated to the status of kingdom somewhere around 925. Tomislav was the first Croatian ruler whom the papal chancellery honoured with the title \"king\".Neven Budak - Prva stolje\u0107a Hrvatske, Zagreb, 1994., p. 22 It is generally said that Tomislav was crowned in 925, however, this is not certain. It is not known when or by whom he was crowned, or, indeed, if he was crowned at all. Tomislav is mentioned as a king in two preserved documents published in the Historia Salonitana. First in a note preceding the text of the conclusions of the Council of Split in 925, where it is written that Tomislav is the \"king\" ruling \"in the province of the Croats and in the Dalmatian regions\" (in prouintia Croatorum et Dalmatiarum finibus Tamisclao rege),Ivo Goldstein: Hrvatski rani srednji vijek, Zagreb, 1995, p. 274-275Florin Curta: Southeastern Europe in the Middle Ages, 500-1250, Cambridge University Press. 2006, p. 196Codex Diplomaticus Regni Croati\u00e6, Dalamati\u00e6 et Slavoni\u00e6, Vol I, p. 32 while in the 12th canon of the Council conclusions the ruler of the Croats is called \"king\" (rex et proceres Chroatorum). In a letter sent by Pope John X, Tomislav is named \"King of the Croats\" (Tamisclao, regi Crouatorum).Codex Diplomaticus Regni Croati\u00e6, Dalamati\u00e6 et Slavoni\u00e6, Vol I, p. 34 The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja titled Tomislav as a king and specified his rule at 13 years. Although there are no inscriptions of Tomislav to confirm the title, later inscriptions and charters confirm that his 10th century successors called themselves \"kings\". Under his rule, Croatia became one of the most powerful kingdoms in the Balkans. Map of the Kingdom of Croatia during the reign of King Tomislav according to Ivo Goldstein Map of Europe c. 1000 AD wattle (pleter) with the inscription of Stephen Dr\u017eislav, 10th century Croatian ruler, originates from the 11th century. Ba\u0161ka tablet, 1100 AD Tomislav, a descendant of Trpimir I, is considered one of the most prominent members of the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty. Sometime between 923 and 928, Tomislav succeeded in uniting the Croats of Pannonia and Dalmatia, each of which had been ruled separately by dukes. Although the exact geographical extent of Tomislav's kingdom is not fully known, Croatia probably covered most of Dalmatia, Pannonia, and northern and western Bosnia.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 262 Croatia at the time was administered as a group of eleven counties (\u017eupanije) and one banate (Banovina). Each of these regions had a fortified royal town. Croatia soon came into conflict with the Bulgarian Empire under Simeon I (called Simeon the Great in Bulgaria), who was already in a war with the Byzantines. Tomislav made a pact with the Byzantine Empire, for which he may have been rewarded by the Byzantine Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos with some form of control over the coastal cities of the Byzantine Theme of Dalmatia and with a share of the tribute collected from them. After Simeon conquered the Principality of Serbia in 924, Croatia received and protected the expelled Serbs with their leader Zaharija.De Administrando Imperio: XXXII. Of the Serbs and of the country they now dwell in In 926, Simeon tried to break the Croatian-Byzantine pact and afterwards conquer the weakly defended Byzantine Theme of Dalmatia,Ivo Goldstein: Hrvatski rani srednji vijek, Zagreb, 1995, p. 289-291 sending Duke Alogobotur with a formidable army against Tomislav, but Simeon's army was defeated in the Battle of the Bosnian Highlands. After Simeon's death in 927 peace was restored between Croatia and Bulgaria with the mediation of the legates of Pope John X.Clifford J. Rogers: The Oxford Encyclopedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology, p. 162 According to the contemporary De Administrando Imperio, Croatian army and navy at the time could have consisted of approximately 100,000 infantry units, 60,000 cavaliers, and 80 larger (sagina) and 100 smaller warships (called condura),De Administrando Imperio: 31. Of the Croats and of the country they now dwell in. \"Baptized Croatia musters as many as 60 thousand horse and 100 thousand foot, and galleys up to 80 and cutters up to 100.\" but these numbers are generally taken as a considerable exaggeration. According to the palaeographic analysis of the original manuscript of De Administrando Imperio, the population of medieval Croatia was estimated at between 440,000 and 880,000 people, while the military force was most probably composed of 20,000\u2013100,000 infantrymen and 3,000\u201324,000 horsemen organized into 60 allagions. === 10th century === Croatian society underwent major changes in the 10th century. Local leaders, the \u017eupani, were replaced by the retainers of the king, who took land from the previous landowners, essentially creating a feudal system. The previously free peasants became serfs and ceased being soldiers, causing the military power of Croatia to fade. Tomislav was succeeded by Trpimir II () and Kre\u0161imir I (), who each managed to maintain their power and keep good relations with both the Byzantine Empire and the Pope. This period, on the whole, however, is obscure. The rule of Kre\u0161imir's son Miroslav was marked by a gradual weakening of Croatia.Ivo Goldstein: Hrvatski rani srednji vijek, Zagreb, 1995, p. 302 Various peripheral territories took advantage of unsettled conditions to secede.John Van Antwerp Fine: The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century, 1991, p. 265 Miroslav ruled for 4 years when he was killed by his ban, Pribina, during an internal power struggle. Pribina secured the throne to Michael Kre\u0161imir II (949\u2013969), who restored order throughout most of the state. He kept particularly good relations with the Dalmatian coastal cities, he and his wife Helen donating land and churches to Zadar and Solin. Michael Kre\u0161imir's wife Helen built the Church of Saint Mary in Solin that served as the tomb of Croatian rulers. Helen died on 8 October 976 and was buried in that church, where a royal inscription on her sarcophagus was found that called her \"Mother of the Kingdom\".Ivo Goldstein: Hrvatski rani srednji vijek, Zagreb, 1995, p. 314-315Neven Budak \u2013 Prva stolje\u0107a Hrvatske, Zagreb, 1994., p. 24-25 Michael Kre\u0161imir II was succeeded by his son Stephen Dr\u017eislav (969\u2013997), who established better relations with the Byzantine Empire and their Theme of Dalmatia. According to Historia Salonitana, Dr\u017eislav received royal insignia from the Byzantines, together with the title of eparch and patricius. Also, according to this work, from the time of D\u017eislav's reign his successors called themselves \"kings of Croatia and Dalmatia\". Stone panels from the altar of a 10th-century church in Knin with the inscription of Dr\u017eislav, possibly when he was the heir to the throne, show that there was a precisely defined hierarchy regulating the matters of succession to the throne. === 11th century === As soon as Stjepan Dr\u017eislav had died in 997, his three sons, Svetoslav (997\u20131000), Kre\u0161imir III (1000\u20131030), and Gojslav (1000\u20131020), opened a violent contest for the throne, weakening the state and allowing the Venetians under Pietro II Orseolo and the Bulgarians under Samuil to encroach on the Croatian possessions along the Adriatic. In 1000, Orseolo led the Venetian fleet into the eastern Adriatic and gradually took control of the whole of it, first the islands of the Gulf of Kvarner and Zadar, then Trogir and Split, followed by a successful naval battle with the Narentines upon which he took control of Kor\u010dula and Lastovo, and claimed the title dux Dalmati\u00e6. Kre\u0161imir III tried to restore the Dalmatian cities and had some success until 1018, when he was defeated by Venice allied with the Lombards. The same year his kingdom briefly became a vassal of the Byzantine Empire until 1025 and the death of Basil II. His son, Stjepan I (1030\u20131058), only went so far as to get the Narentine duke to become his vassal in 1050. During the reign of Kre\u0161imir IV (1058\u20131074), the medieval Croatian kingdom reached its territorial peak. Kre\u0161imir managed to get the Byzantine Empire to confirm him as the supreme ruler of the Dalmatian cities, i.e., over the Theme of Dalmatia, excluding the theme of Ragusa and the Duchy of Durazzo. He also allowed the Roman curia to become more involved in the religious affairs of Croatia, which consolidated his power but disrupted his rule over the Glagolitic clergy in parts of Istria after 1060. Croatia under Kre\u0161imir IV was composed of twelve counties and was slightly larger than in Tomislav's time. It included the closest southern Dalmatian duchy of Pagania, and its influence extended over Zahumlje, Travunia, and Duklja. The \u017eupans (heads of counties) had their own private armies. The names of court titles in their vernacular form appear for the first time during his reign, such as vratar (\"door- keeper\") Jurina, postelnik (\"chamberlain\") and so on.Curta, Florin pp. 261 Croatia on a map of southeastern Europe in 1045 However, in 1072, Kre\u0161imir assisted the Bulgarian and Serb uprising against their Byzantine masters. The Byzantines retaliated in 1074 by sending the Norman count Amico of Giovinazzo to besiege Rab. They failed to capture the island, but did manage to capture the king himself, and the Croatians were then forced to settle and give away Split, Trogir, Zadar, Biograd, and Nin to the Normans. In 1075, Venice expelled the Normans and secured the cities for itself. The end of Kre\u0161imir IV in 1074 also marked the de facto end of the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty, which had ruled the Croatian lands for over two centuries. Kre\u0161imir was succeeded by Demetrius Zvonimir (1075\u20131089) of the Svetoslavi\u0107 branch of the House of Trpimirovi\u0107. He was previously a ban in Slavonia in the service of Peter Kre\u0161imir IV and later the Duke of Croatia. He gained the title of king with the support of Pope Gregory VII and was crowned as King of Croatia in Solin on 8 October 1076. Zvonimir aided the Normans under Robert Guiscard in their struggle against the Byzantine Empire and Venice between 1081 and 1085. Zvonimir helped to transport their troops through the Strait of Otranto and to occupy the city of Dyrrhachion. His troops assisted the Normans in many battles along the Albanian and Greek coast. Due to this, in 1085, the Byzantines transferred their rights in Dalmatia to Venice. Zvonimir's kinghood is carved in stone on the Ba\u0161ka Tablet, preserved to this day as one of the oldest written Croatian texts, kept in the arch\u00e6ological museum in Zagreb. Zvonimir's reign is remembered as a peaceful and prosperous time, during which the connection of Croats with the Holy See was further affirmed, so much so that Catholicism would remain among Croats until the present day. In this time the noble titles in Croatia were made analogous to those used in other parts of Europe at the time, with comes and baron used for the \u017eupani and the royal court nobles, and vlastelin for the noblemen. The Croatian state was edging closer to western Europe and further from the east. Croatia on a map of the southeastern Europe around 1090 Demetrius Zvonimir married Helen of Hungary in 1063. Queen Helen was a Hungarian princess, the daughter of King B\u00e9la I of the Hungarian \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, and was the sister of the future Hungarian King Ladislaus I. Zvonimir and Helen had a son, Radovan, who died in his late teens or early twenties. King Demetrius Zvonimir died in 1089. The exact circumstances of his death are unknown. According to a later, likely unsubstantiated legend, King Zvonimir was killed during a revolt in 1089. There was no permanent state capital, as the royal residence varied from one ruler to another; five cities in total reportedly obtained the title of a royal seat: Nin (Kre\u0161imir IV), Biograd (Stephen Dr\u017eislav, Kre\u0161imir IV), Knin (Zvonimir, Petar Sva\u010di\u0107), \u0160ibenik (Kre\u0161imir IV), and Solin (Kre\u0161imir II).Ferdo \u0160i\u0161i\u0107, Povijest Hrvata; pregled povijesti hrvatskog naroda 600. - 1918., Zagreb == Succession crisis == Stephen II (reigned 1089\u20131091) of the main Trpimirovi\u0107 line came to the throne at an old age. Stephen II was to be the last king of the House of Trpimirovi\u0107. His rule was relatively ineffectual and lasted less than two years. He spent most of this time in the tranquility of the Monastery of St. Stephen beneath the Pines near Split. He died at the beginning of 1091, without leaving an heir. Since there was no living male member of the House of Trpimirovi\u0107, civil war and unrest broke out shortly afterward.Neven Budak - Prva stolje\u0107a Hrvatske, Zagreb, 1994., page 77 The widow of late King Zvonimir, Helen, tried to keep her power in Croatia during the succession crisis.Neven Budak - Prva stolje\u0107a Hrvatske, Zagreb, 1994., page 80 (in Croatian) Some Croatian nobles around Helen, possibly the Gusi\u0107 familyNada Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata u ranom srednjem vijeku, II Izdanje, Zagreb 1975., page 492 (in Croatian) and/or Viniha from Lap\u010dan family, contesting the succession after the death of Zvonimir, asked King Ladislaus I to help Helen and offered him the Croatian throne, which was seen as rightfully his by inheritance rights. According to some sources, several Dalmatian cities also asked King Ladislaus for assistance, and Petar Gusi\u0107 with Petar de genere Cacautonem presented themselves as \"White Croats\" (Creates Albi), on his court. Thus the campaign launched by Ladislaus was not purely a foreign aggressionB\u00e1r\u00e1ny, Attila (2012). \"The Expansion of the Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages (1000\u20131490)\". In Berend, N\u00f3ra. The Expansion of Central Europe in the Middle Ages. Ashgate Variorum. page 344-345 nor did he appear on the Croatian throne as a conqueror, but rather as a successor by hereditary rights.M\u00e1rta Font - Ugarsko Kraljevstvo i Hrvatska u srednjem vijeku (Hungarian Kingdom and Croatia in the Middlea Ages), p. 8-9 In 1091 Ladislaus crossed the Drava river and conquered the entire province of Slavonia without encountering opposition, but his campaign was halted near the Forest Mountain (Mount Gvozd).Archdeacon Thomas of Split: History of the Bishops of Salona and Split (ch. 17.), p. 93. Since the Croatian nobles were divided, Ladislaus had success in his campaign, yet he wasn't able to establish his control over the entirety of Croatia, although the exact extent of his conquest is not known. At this time the Kingdom of Hungary was attacked by the Cumans, who were likely sent by Byzantium, so Ladislaus was forced to retreat from his campaign in Croatia. Ladislaus appointed his nephew Prince \u00c1lmos to administer the controlled area of Croatia, established the Diocese of Zagreb as a symbol of his new authority and went back to Hungary. In the midst of the war, Petar Sva\u010di\u0107 was elected king by Croatian feudal lords in 1093. Petar's seat of power was based in Knin. His rule was marked by a struggle for control of the country with \u00c1lmos, who wasn't able to establish his rule and was forced to withdraw to Hungary in 1095.Nada Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata u ranom srednjem vijeku, II Izdanje, Zagreb 1975., page 508-509 (in Croatian) Ladislaus died in 1095, leaving his nephew Coloman to continue the campaign. Coloman, as well as Ladislaus before him, wasn't seen as a conqueror but rather as a pretender to the Croatian throne. Coloman assembled a large army to press his claim on the throne and in 1097 defeated King Petar's troops in the Battle of Gvozd Mountain, where the latter was killed. Since the Croatians didn't have a leader any more and Dalmatia had numerous fortified towns that would be difficult to defeat, negotiations started between Coloman and the Croatian feudal lords. It took several more years before the Croatian nobility recognised Coloman as the king. Coloman was crowned in Biograd in 1102 and the title now claimed by Coloman was \"King of Hungary, Dalmatia, and Croatia\". Some of the terms of his coronation are summarized in Pacta Conventa by which the Croatian nobles agreed to recognise Coloman as king. In return, the 12 Croatian nobles that signed the agreement retained their lands and properties and were granted exemption from tax or tributes. The nobles were to send at least ten armed horsemen each beyond the Drava River at the king's expense if his borders were attacked.Trpimir Macan: Povijest hrvatskog naroda, 1971, p. 71 (full text of Pacta conventa in Croatian)Ferdo \u0160i\u0161i\u0107: Priru\u010dnik izvora hrvatske historije, Dio 1, \u010dest 1, do god. 1107., Zagreb 1914., p. 527-528 (full text of Pacta conventa in Latin) Despite that Pacta Conventa is not an authentic document from 1102, there was almost certainly some kind of contract or agreement between the Croatian nobles and Coloman which regulated the relations in the same way.Neven Budak - Prva stolje\u0107a Hrvatske, Zagreb, 1994., page 39 (in Croatian) === Unification === A 14th-century transcript of the Pacta conventa, preserved in the Hungarian National Museum. Most historians consider it a forgery, but that the contents of it corresponds to the reality of rule in Croatia. In 1102, after a succession crisis, the crown passed into the hands of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, with the crowning of King Coloman of Hungary as \"King of Croatia and Dalmatia\" in Biograd. The precise terms of the union between the two realms became a matter of dispute in the 19th century. The two kingdoms were united under the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty either by the choice of the Croatian nobility or by Hungarian force. Croatian historians hold that the union was a personal one in the form of a shared king, a view also accepted by a number of Hungarian historians,M\u00e1rta Font - Ugarsko Kraljevstvo i Hrvatska u srednjem vijeku [Hungarian Kingdom and Croatia in the Middlea Ages] \"Medieval Hungary and Croatia were, in terms of public international law, allied by means of personal union created in the late 11th century.\"Luk\u00e1cs Istv\u00e1n - A horv\u00e1t irodalom t\u00f6rt\u00e9nete, Budapest, Nemzeti Tank\u00f6nyvkiad\u00f3, 1996.[The history of Croatian literature] (in Hungarian) while Serbian and Hungarian nationalist historians preferred to see it as a form of annexation. The claim of a Hungarian occupation was made in the 19th century during the Hungarian national reawakening. Thus in older Hungarian historiography Coloman's coronation in Biograd was a subject of dispute and their stance was that Croatia was conquered. Although these kinds of claims can also be found today, since the Croatian-Hungarian tensions are gone, it has generally been accepted that Coloman was crowned in Biograd as king. Today, Hungarian legal historians hold that the relationship of Hungary with the area of Croatia and Dalmatia in the period till 1526 and the death of Louis II was most similar to a personal union, resembling the relationship of Scotland to England.Banai Mikl\u00f3s, Luk\u00e1cs B\u00e9la: Attempts for closing up by long range regulators in the Carpathian Basin According to the Worldmark Encyclopedia of Nations and the Grand Larousse encyclop\u00e9dique, Croatia entered a personal union with Hungary in 1102, which remained the basis of the Hungarian-Croatian relationship until 1918, while Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica specified the union as a dynastic one. According to the research of the Library of Congress, Coloman crushed opposition after the death of Ladislaus I and won the crown of Dalmatia and Croatia in 1102, thus forging a link between the Croatian and Hungarian crowns that lasted until the end of World War I. Hungarian culture permeated northern Croatia, the Croatian-Hungarian border shifted often, and at times Hungary treated Croatia as a vassal state. Croatia had its own local governor, or Ban; a privileged landowning nobility; and an assembly of nobles, the Sabor. According to some historians, Croatia became part of Hungary in the late 11th and early 12th century, yet the actual nature of the relationship is difficult to define. Sometimes Croatia acted as an independent agent and at other times as a vassal of Hungary. However, Croatia retained a large degree of internal independence. The degree of Croatian autonomy fluctuated throughout the centuries as did its borders. The alleged agreement called Pacta conventa () or Qualiter (first word of the text) is today viewed as a 14th-century forgery by most modern Croatian historians. According to the document King Coloman and the twelve heads of the Croatian nobles made an agreement, in which Coloman recognised their autonomy and specific privileges. Although it is not an authentic document from 1102, nonetheless there was at least a non-written agreement that regulated the relations between Hungary and Croatia in approximately the same way, while the content of the alleged agreement is concordant with the reality of rule in Croatia in more than one respect.P\u00e1l Engel: Realm of St. Stephen: A History of Medieval Hungary, 2005, p. 35-36 The official entering of Croatia into a personal union with Hungary, later becoming part of the Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen,Desetlje\u0107e od godine 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela., Mladen An\u010di\u0107, Povij, pril., 17, Zagreb 1998, pp. 255 had several important consequences. Institutions of separate Croatian statehood were maintained with the Sabor (parliament) and the ban (viceroy) in the name of the king. A single ban governed all Croatian provinces until 1225, when the authority was split between one ban of the whole of Slavonia and one ban of Croatia and Dalmatia. The positions were intermittently held by the same person after 1345, and officially merged back into one by 1476. == Union with Hungary == In the union with Hungary, the crown was held by the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty, and after its extinction, under the Anjou dynasty. Institutions of separate Croatian statehood were maintained through the Parliament () and the ban (viceroy) responsible to the King of Hungary and Croatia. In addition, the Croatian nobles retained their lands and titles. Coloman retained the institution of the Sabor and relieved the Croatians of taxes on their land. Coloman's successors continued to crown themselves as Kings of Croatia separately in Biograd na Moru until the time of B\u00e9la IV.Curta, Stephenson, p. 267 In the 14th century a new term arose to describe the collection of de jure independent states under the rule of the Hungarian King: Archiregnum Hungaricum (Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen). Croatia remained a distinct crown attached to that of Hungary until the abolition of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918. == See also == * Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg) * Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia * History of Croatia * Pacta conventa (Croatia) * Crown of Zvonimir * Bans of Croatia * Timeline of Croatian history * List of rulers of Croatia == References == == Further reading == * Neven Budak - Prva stolje\u0107a Hrvatske, Zagreb, 1994. * * * * Category:10th century in Croatia Category:11th century in Croatia Category:12th century in Croatia Category:Former Slavic countries Category:Former countries in Europe Category:Former countries in the Balkans cs:Chorvatsk\u00e9 kr\u00e1lovstv\u00ed ",
