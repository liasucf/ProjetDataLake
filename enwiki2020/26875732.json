Born in Glasgow, Scotland he came to Chicago in 1908 where he studied at the School of the Art Institute. He joined the design department of the Ludlow Typograph Company in 1923 and served as director of the department of typeface design from 1933\u201371. In 1944 he began operating a private press, The Cherryburn Press. He died in Chicago.Friedl, Ott, and Stein, p. 382. ==Typefaces== All of these foundry types (except Andromaque) were cast by Ludlow TypographMacGrew, Mac, American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century, Oak Knoll Books, New Castle Delaware, 1993, . While cited as America's second most prolific (metal type era) type designer after Morris Fuller Benton, many of Middleton's fonts have never been digitised. This may be because many were display or script designs which dated after their time of greatest popularity. ==References== *Rollins, Carl Purlington American Type Designers and Their Work. in Print, V. 4, #1. *Jaspert, W.
