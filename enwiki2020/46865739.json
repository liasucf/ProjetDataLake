    "text": "Pierre Louis Napoleon Cavagnari with the Sirdars by John Burke, late 1870s Warburton with Nauroz Khan of Lalpura Mohmands John Burke (circa 1843 - 1900) was a photographer, best known for his photographs of the Second Anglo-Afghan War between 1878\u20131880. Burke was born in Ireland, around 1843, where he was a tradesman. He applied for a job in the British Army as an official photographer but travelled to Afghanistan at his own expense using heavy cameras that would have needed transporting on pack animals through mountainous regions. He died in 1900. Burke's photographs have been grouped in albums with those of Benjamin Simpson and other photographers, so definitive attribution is not possible for some of his works. ==Gallery== ==See also== * Samuel Bourne * Frederick Fiebig * Linnaeus Tripe ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Irish photographers Category:War photographers Category:Photography in India ",
