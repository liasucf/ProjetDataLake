    "text": "Broaden Your Mind (1968\u20131969) was a British television comedy series starring Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden, joined by Bill Oddie for the second series. Guest cast members included Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Jo Kendall, Roland MacLeod and Nicholas McArdle. It was one of BBC2's earliest programmes to be completely broadcast in colour, which had been introduced by the network a year earlier. Directed by Jim Franklin, the series was a precursor to the television comedy series The Goodies (of which early titles under consideration included \"Narrow Your Mind\"). Writers for the series included Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, Bill Oddie, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Roland MacLeod, Marty Feldman, Barry Cryer, Barry Took, Jim Franklin, Simon Brett and Chris Stuart- Clark. Broaden Your Mind was subtitled 'an encyclopaedia of the air' and consisted largely of short sketches. All of the programmes were wiped by the BBC after their first broadcast in 1968, and only a handful of brief filmed sequences survive, including the Peelers sketch, Turgonitis, and \"Ordinary Royal Family\". These are all from the 5th episode of the 2nd series, and were included, digitally restored, on Network DVDs 2003 release, The Goodies at Last. All of the programmes, however, survive as off-air audio recordings made by a fan at the time of original transmission. ==References== ==External links== * Comedy Guide * *Broaden Your Mind at Comedy Zone Category:BBC television comedy Category:BBC television sketch shows Category:Lost BBC episodes Category:1960s British television sketch shows Category:1968 British television series debuts Category:1969 British television series endings ",
