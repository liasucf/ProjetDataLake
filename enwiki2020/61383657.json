He decides to spend the last month of his life with dignity and like a good man. The hero starts doing things he was afraid to do his entire life: putting rude people back into their place, protecting people from injustice and self-righteous or abusive people, defending all he can with no second thoughts or regrets. He has no fear now, he is not afraid to be left alone or be laughed at. In the end, as it turns out, the deadly prognosis (which he actually came to know because he was eavesdropping) , was about an actual hare (a play of words: His surname is Zaychik. Zaychik is also a word for \"little hare\", hence the name of movie). But by that time he has become a different man: decisive, courageous and knowing his worth.\u0417\u0430\u0439\u0447\u0438\u043a == Cast == * Leonid Bykov as Lev Zaychik * Olga Krasina\u041a\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430 \u00ab\u041f\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0434\u0430\u043c\u0430\u00bb \u0438 \u00ab\u0417\u0430\u0439\u0447\u0438\u043a\u00bb: \u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0431\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0438 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0439 as Natasha * Igor Gorbachyov as Shabashnikov * Sergey Filippov as Theater Director * Georgy Vitsin as Assistant Director * Aleksei Smirnov as Sound Effects Man * Igor Dmitriev as Count Nulin * Lev Stepanov as Patronchikov * Glikeriya Bogdanova-Chesnokova as Glikeriya Vasilievna\u0417\u0430\u0439\u0447\u0438\u043a (1965) Full Cast & Crew == Release == One of the leaders of the Soviet box office in 1965: 16th place among domestic films (23rd place in the general list) with 25.1 million viewers. == References == == External links == * Category:1964 films Category:Russian-language films Category:Soviet romantic comedy films Category:Soviet films Category:1964 romantic comedy films Category:Lenfilm films Category:1964 comedy films ",
