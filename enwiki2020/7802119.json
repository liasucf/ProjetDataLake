    "text": "The Semnani languages are a group of Northwestern Iranian languages,Ethnologue lising for Semnani languages spoken in Semnan province of Iran that share many linguistic features and structures with Caspian languages. These languages are also called \"dialects\" in some sources.Lecoq, pg. 297 There are six Semnani languages named in the literature. Some may be dialects, but there is little published work on their relationships.C.F. & F.M. Voegelin, Classification and Index of the World's Languages (1977) lists them as dialects of Persian (pg. 185). Lecoq, pg. 297 lists them as \"dialects\" as well. Ethnologue lists Semnani, Sorkhei, Lasgerdi, and Sangsari as languages with Biyabunaki as a possible dialect of Semnani and Aftari as a dialect of Sorkhei. Linguasphere lists them together in an outer language called Semnani+Sangisari [58-AAC-f] with Semnani and Sangisari listed as inner languages. Merritt Ruhlen, A Guide to the World's Languages, Volume 1: Classification (1991) lists Semnani and Sangisari as languages in the Semnani subgroup. *Semnani *Biyabunaki *Sangsari *Sorkhei *Aftari *Lasgerdi Glottolog changed the designation of this language family from \"Semnanic\"https://glottolog.org/files/glottolog-2.7/semn1240.html to \"Komisenian\".https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/komi1276 This designation has been also adopted by Wiktionary.https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Komisenian_languages ==Cognate setsLecoq, pg. 310.== {|class=\"wikitable\" !English !Sorkhei !Lasgerdi !Sangsari !Aftari !Biyabunaki |- | dog | esb\u0101 | esbe | esbe | espa | esba |- | girl | dukkey | dot | d\u00f6t | dut | dut |- | blood | x\u00fcn | | | | x\u00fcn |- | large | mas\u012bn | mas\u012bn | mas/yale | mas\u012bn | |- | nose | ven | vin\u012b | xun\u012b | vin\u012b | v\u0113n\u012b |- | snow | v\u0101r | var | varf | | var |- | serpent | | | mohur | | mahar |- | moon | | | m\u016bng | | m\u0101ye |- | woman | \u017eiki | \u017eaki | \u017eekeyn | d\u017eek | d\u017einak\u0101 |- |} ==Notes== ==Bibliography== *Pierre Lecoq. 1989. \"Les dialectes caspiens et les dialectes du nord-ouest de l'Iran,\" Compendium Linguarum Iranicarum.
