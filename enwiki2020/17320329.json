At the 2010 Winter Olympics, he was going to compete in the men's 50km cross-country race, however Canada's coach decided to replace him with a skier who did well at an earlier event at the 2010 games and thus he did not become the first athlete in the world to compete in the Winter Paralympics and Winter Olympics in the same year.Associated Press, \"Canada's McKeever to ski at Olympics, Paralympics\", Rachel Cohen, 17 February 2010 (accessed 21 February 2010) At the 2010 Paralympics McKeever won three gold medals for cross-country skiing.
