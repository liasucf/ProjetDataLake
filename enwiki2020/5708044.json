She had a successful career on Broadway and was critically acclaimed as Edith Frank in the 1956 production of The Diary of Anne Frank. ==Early life and career== Huber was born in Wiener Neustadt, Austria in 1914. She received training as an actress from :de:Rudolph Beer, who later arranged her stage debut in Zurich. She had her first film role in 1935 in Tanzmusik, followed by Savoy-Hotel 217 (1936). One year later she achieved her career breakthrough in the film adaptation of Unentschuldigte Stunde. Her better-known films include ' (1937), Land of Love (1937), Kleiner Mann \u2013 ganz gross! (1938), Eine Frau f\u00fcr Drei (1939), and Jenny und der Herr im Frack (1941), after which she worked for four years at the Viennese Burgtheater and elsewhere onstage. After the end of World War II, Huber moved to the United States. She acted only occasionally thereafter, most notably appearing on Broadway three times, in Flight into Egypt, as Margot Wendice in Dial M for Murder and a performance The Diary of Anne Frank. ==Links to Nazism== Around 1946, Huber moved to the United States with her second husband, Joseph Besch, an officer in the U.S. Army. Besch boasted that his wife was \"the first Austrian actress to be cleared by the American military government\". Her last film role was Das Tagebuch der Anne Frank (The Diary of Anne Frank; 1959), in which she reprised the role of Anne Frank's mother, Edith, which caused controversy in some circles as Huber was rumored to have been too close to the Nazis, but Garson Kanin reportedly stood by the casting. American Heritage magazine wrote of Huber's attempts to distance herself from her wartime past: > In Vienna before the war she [Huber] had refused to work with a Jewish actor > and director, and in Germany during the war she had continued to make movies > under the Third Reich...At the very same time Anne was murdered in Bergen- > Belsen, Gusti was busy shooting a screen comedy...But Huber was a Broadway > star and [the charges against her] never...gained traction.Profile of Gusti > Huber, americanheritage.com; accessed November 3, 2015. ==Family== Huber married Austrian Gotfrid K\u00f6chert in 1939. The couple had two daughters, Christiana Barbara (1939) and actress Bibiana \"Bibi\" Maria (1942), while K\u00f6chert served with Nazi Germany's Wehrmacht during World War II. The marriage ended in divorce in 1944. In 1946, Huber married Joseph Besch, an officer in the U.S. Army. The family immediately moved to the United States and Besch adopted Christina and Bibi, who took his surname. The couple had two more children together, Drea and Andrew. Huber's grandchildren include actress Samantha Mathis, Bibi's daughter. ==Selected filmography== * Dance Music (1935) * Savoy Hotel 217 (1936) * The Cabbie's Song (1936) * Land of Love (1937) * Between the Parents (1938) * The Girl of Last Night (1938) * Gabriele Dambrone (1943) * The Diary of Anne Frank (1959) ==References== ==External links== * * Short biography * Photographs of Gusti Huber Category:1914 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Austrian emigrants to the United States Category:Austrian film actresses Category:Austrian stage actresses Category:Disease-related deaths in New York (state) Category:20th-century Austrian actresses Category:People from Wiener Neustadt ",
