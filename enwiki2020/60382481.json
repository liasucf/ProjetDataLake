Feb 24, 2019. Web. Nov 14, 2019 The first iteration of the play came in the form of a short 10-minute presentation that Schreck performed at benefits nearly ten years after her initial idea for the show. Although the premise of the play is based on Schreck\u2019s own life, she says that she did not initially set out to write a role for her to play. Instead, Schreck\u2019s motives for writing the play include getting Americans to consider contemporary judicial issues through the lens of the Constitution itself, and to provide a grounds for conversation of those issues facing women today.McGuinness, Max. \"Falling Out of Love with the US Constitution: Playwright Heidi Schreck.\" FT.com (2019): n/a. International Newsstream. Web. When asked about the concept of victimhood in her play, Schreck notes, \u201c\u2026stories hold our cure.\u201d Although the play seems to be improvised to a certain degree, Schreck sticks heavily to the letter of her script, adapting occasionally to integrate the most relevant contemporary references. == Context == === Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh === The play\u2019s discussion of women\u2019s rights has been especially pertinent to audiences in light of recent hearings to appoint Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In an article for The New York Times, Ben Brantley writes: \u201cMs. Schreck\u2019s show\u2026never mentions Mr. Kavanaugh by name. But his invisible judiciary presence is there, affirming many of her implicit arguments, which are often indistinguishable from her deepest fears about a document with which she has had a long and complicated relationship.\u201d The content of the play is implicitly shaped by the state of the nation in which it lives; Schreck notes that the percentage of votes in favor of abolishing the constitution during the Kavanaugh hearings rose dramatically during the time of his trial. === Women's issues === What the Constitution Means to Me also covers issues including women's equality and abortion. Schreck discusses her own experience in getting an abortion when she was in her 20s, and a sexual assault she experienced during college. She also addresses the abuse of her mother by her stepfather, and of her grandmother, Bette, by Bette's husband.Holdren, Sara. \"It's Not just Rhetoric: What the Constitution Means to Me Charts a Way Forward for Politicized Theater.\" New York 51.21 (2018): 142-6. Web. In addition, the story of Schreck\u2019s great-grandmother, who was sent away from her home to wed her future husband in Washington, is included in the context of her great-grandmother's eventual admittance into a mental hospital for \u201cmelancholia\u201d and death at the age of 36.McNulty, Charles. \"Review: Unconventional \u2018What the Constitution Means to Me\u2019 supremely argues the case for women.\" 2019. Web. US Newsstream. The play notes that women's issues, including abortion, are not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution at all. === Immigration === The play addresses themes of immigration as they relate to the history of Schreck\u2019s family, including a discussion of how Schreck\u2019s grandmother came to the U.S. after being purchased from a magazine by her future husband. The idea of being a \u201cgood immigrant\u201d is also included throughout the play; critics have noted the importance of this theme in parallel to Donald Trump\u2019s anti-immigration rhetoric.McNulty, Charles. \"Review: Unconventional \u2018What the Constitution Means to Me\u2019 supremely argues the case for women.\" 2019. Web. US Newsstream. ==Critical response== In reviewing the 2018 Off-Broadway production, Thom Geier of The Wrap wrote: \"Schreck is an engaging storyteller with a delivery that seems improvised even when she is sticking to her winding but always-focused script. Again and again, she manages to imbue her exploration of the politics of constitutional rights from the lens of the personal. And of the individuals left out as Americans saw their rights expand.\"Geier, Thom. \"'What the Constitution Means to Me' Theater Review: A Timely Blend of the Political and Personal\" The Wrap, October 1, 2018 Critic Sara Holdren writes in New York Magazine that What the Constitution Means to Me is a \"...brilliantly crafted show, harrowing and funny and humane, that accesses the political through the deeply personal.\" Ben Brantley of The New York Times noted, \"More artistic choice could have been taken in the production of the play; but the whirlwind, all-in-one-breath nature of the play echoes the feeling of desperation that permeates Schreck's storylines.\" Kyle Smith in National Review provides a conservative point of view, writing, \"Schreck describes the Constitution the way a Harlequin Romance novelist might describe a night with Fabio: a 'living, warm-blooded, steamy document. ... It is hot and sweaty.' ... The language is instructive: The more you shroud and occlude the plain meaning of the document, the more you claim it to be cloaked in voodoo, the better. That way the actual, brief, lucid charter can be shunted aside in favor of a fantasy document, one that has all of those 'positive rights' liberals wish were guaranteed forever. These rights need to be established by the Constitution because otherwise liberals might have to win them through the ballot box, and that would mean persuading their fellow Americans. It\u2019s much easier to do what this show does: gather a few hundred progressives each night in a Broadway bubble and get them whooping and cheering about everything they have won for themselves in their imaginary Constitution.\" ==Honors and awards== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" !Year !Award !Category !Nominee !Result |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"11\"|2019 |Lucille Lortel AwardsGans, Andrew. \"Nominations for 34th Annual Lucille Lortel Awards Announced; 'Carmen Jones' and 'Rags Parkland Sings the Songs of the Future' Lead the Pack\" Playbill, April 3, 2019 |colspan=\"2\"|Outstanding Play (Off-Broadway) | |- |Obie AwardClement, Olivia; McPhee, Ryan. \"Heidi Schreck's Constitution, New York Theatre Workshop Among 2019 Obie Award Winners\" Playbill, May 20, 2019 |colspan=\"2\"|Best New American Play | |- |Off- Broadway Alliance AwardsClement, Olivia, \" 'What the Constitution Means to Me' and Yiddish 'Fiddler on the Roof' Among 2019 Off-Broadway Alliance Award Winners\" Playbill, May 22, 2019 |colspan=\"2\"|Best New Play | |- | rowspan=\"2\"|Drama League AwardMcPhee, Ryan.
