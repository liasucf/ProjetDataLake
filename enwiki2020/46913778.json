In a first for a Metro station, Palam has parking space for 66 e-rickshaws where around six to seven charging points will be provided. E-rickshaws, apart from the Metro feeders, have emerged as a crucial link in the last-mile connectivity to and from metro stations in the city. The station also has unique art installations. The passage between exit gates two and three, which has already been opened for public to use as a subway to cross the road, has a rooftop installation depicting the blue sky, while the walls are decked with handmade ceramic tiles. There is also a heavy use of glass separators to divide the station area. The division at the automatic fare collection (AFC) gates will also help control crowd and facilitate faster entry and exit. ==Gallery== File:Palam metro station Construction Work 1.jpg|Palam metro station under construction ==Connections== The Janakpuri West \u2013 Botanical Garden corridor passing through Palam metro station.
