This gave the President the power to \"regulate the distribution, export, import, purchase and storage of food.\"Clean Plate Club http://www.charitywire.com/charity10/04303.html President Woodrow Wilson released Executive order 2679-A creating the U.S. Food Administration and appointed Herbert Hoover as the head, enforcing this act. This organization was given the task of making sure that the limited amount of food America had as a result of World War I didn\u2019t go to waste, and to avoid importation of food as much as possible. Hoover knew that many Americans were willing to volunteer and had a strong sense of patriotism during the war, so he used that to his advantage when he advertised the idea of the \u201cClean Plate\u201d campaign. Hoover promoted this idea to children who attended school with a pledge that read, \u201cAt table I\u2019ll not leave a scrap of food upon my plate. And I\u2019ll not eat between meals, but for supper time I\u2019ll wait.\u201d Pledge This targeted children too young to understand the value of food in the difficult economic time. Many necessities such as flour and sugar were in short supply, so Hoover used a sense of American nationalism to encourage families to take appropriate rations and save food. His goal was for people to eat less, use less essential ingredients, and to finish their entire meal. By doing this, young children developed the habit of eating everything given to them, thus \u201ccleaning their plate.\u201d == Creating the club == The U.S. Food Administration was terminated after the First World War, but in 1947 the \u201cClean Plate\u201d proposal came back and was encouraged by President Harry S. Truman, who aided in officially forming the \u201cClean Plates Club\u201d in elementary schools across the country. This club was officially created after the Great Depression and World War II, when food was once again scarce. In 1947, the U.S. created the Marshall Plan, in which President Truman encouraged Americans to consume less poultry, to conserve food for starving Europeans. As a reaction to his plan, the \u201cClean Plate Clubs\u201d were formed, and elementary school students were again taught to clean their plates. == Currently == This concept now puts Americans at risk of unhealthy life styles. Studies show that 64% of Americans are now in danger of being overweight or obese. AICR http://www.aicr.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id;=7598&news;_iv_ctrl=0&abbr;=pr_ The ideal of completely finishing a serving has now become a bad habit, as food (in America) is no longer in short supply, and finishing the remainder of your meal is not a crucial belief any more. Today, portion sizes have increased considerably, shown by the fact that a serving of french fries today is twice the size of a 1950s serving, UT Southwestern Medical Center http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/utsw/cda/dept16498/files/145991.html making \u201ccleaning your plate\u201d an unhealthy dietary action. It has been shown that parents who push their children to eat their entire meal may interfere with the self-control of their child, thus leading them to overeat, as well as creating a misunderstanding of an appropriate serving size. Some \u201cClean Plate\u201d cases may turn into psychological problems, or lead to developing eating disorders. Health experts indicate that completely finishing meals points you in a direction that moves towards obesity and continuous health problems such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. == References == Category:Political catchphrases ",
