The line is one of several true funiculars in the city, including the Zecca\u2013Righi funicular and the Quezzi funicular, although the Principe\u2013Granarolo rack railway is also sometimes erroneously described as a funicular. == History == The funicular was opened in 1891, and was initially water-driven, with water filling a ballast tank under the carriage at the top station, and emptying at the bottom. The line was converted to electric operation in 1980, and was again modernized in 1991 following a fire that destroyed the top station. == Operation == The line is currently managed by AMT Genova, and has the following parameters: {| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font-size:95%; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:5px;\" |- |Number of cars |2 |- |Number of stops |2 |- |Configuration |Single track with passing loop |- |Track length | |- |Track gauge | |- |Rise | |- |Gradient |15.33% (average); 17% (maximum) |- |Capacity |30 passengers per train |- |Maximum speed | |- |} == See also == * List of funicular railways == References == == External links == * Category:Former water-powered funicular railways converted to electricity Category:Funicular railways in Italy Category:Railway lines in Liguria Category:Transport in Genoa ",
