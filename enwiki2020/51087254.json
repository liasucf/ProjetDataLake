    "text": "Don Chisciotte in Sierra Morena is a tragicomic opera in five acts composed by Francesco Bartolomeo Conti to an Italian libretto by Apostolo Zeno and Pietro Pariati. The libretto is based on the episodes set in the Sierra Morena mountains of Spain in Book I of the Miguel de Cervantes novel Don Quixote. The opera premiered on 6 February 1719 at the Hoftheater in Vienna and proved to be one of Conti's most successful ones. It has had several revivals in modern times beginning in 1987 at the Buxton Festival. ==Background and performance history== The opera's librettists, Apostolo Zeno and Pietro Pariati, had written the librettos for many of Conti's Vienna operas, either individually or jointly. On this occasion they remained quite faithful to the text and basic story recounted Book I of Don Quixote where he travels to the Sierra Morena mountains and has a series of encounters with the wily inhabitants and two pairs of unhappy lovers. Described in the libretto as a tragicomedia per musica (tragicomedy in music), it is essentially a parody of the opera seria genre and its heroic arias.Grout, Donald and Williams, Hermine Weigel (2003). A Short History of Opera, 4th edition, p. 234. Columbia University Press. Don Chisciotte in Sierra Morena premiered at 6 February 1719 at the court theatre of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. The title role was sung by Francesco Borosini, who created the leading tenor and baritone roles in many of Conti's operas. Although generally described as a tenor, Borosini had an extraordinarily wide vocal range spanning bass to tenor. Conti's wife, Maria Landini, sang the lead soprano role of Lucinda. The staging was designed by Giuseppe Galli Bibiena. The production also included two comic intermedi following Acts 2 and 4 and three ballets with music by Nicola Matteis, the Younger\u2014Dance of the Peasants (at the end of Act 1), Dance of the Puppeteers (at the end of Act 3), and Dance of the Servants (at the end of Act 5).Pietropaolo, Domenico and Parker, Mary Ann (2011). The Baroque Libretto: Italian Operas and Oratorios in the Thomas Fisher Library at the University of Toronto, pp. 177\u2013178. University of Toronto Press. The opera was an immediate success and was performed 25 times in Vienna between its premiere and 1737. It also had performances in Braunschweig in 1720, 1721, and 1738 and in Hamburg in 1720 and 1722.Morier, Denis (2015). Don Chisciotte in Sierra Morena. Philharmonie de Paris. Retrieved 16 July 2016 A shortened form of the libretto was used for a set of intermedi performed in Spain in 1728 and an anonymous libretto published in Germany in 1739 as Amor medico, o sia Don Chisciotte draws heavily on Zeno and Pariati's work. It is not known if the latter was ever performed.Mancing, Howard (2004). The Cervantes Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, p. 24. Greenwood Publishing Group. The opera's first performance in modern times was at the Buxton Festival in 1987, where it was sung in English translation with Neill Archer in the title role. It was staged again at the 1992 Innsbruck Festival of Early Music with Ren\u00e9 Jacobs conducting and Nicolas Rivenq in the title role. On that occasion it was performed in the original Italian but like the Buxton production it was heavily cut. It has had several revivals since then, both staged and in concert version, including a fully staged production at the Caramoor Festival in 2004.Fallows, David (October 1987). \"Buxton\".
