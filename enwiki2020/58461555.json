It was one of the sources of water supply in Timi\u0219oara at the beginning of the 20th century. Turnurile de ap\u0103, timisoara-info.ro, access date: 30 March 2017 It is classified as a National Heritage Site () with LMI code TM-II-m-A-06122. == History == The first reference to a well dug inside the Huniade Castle dates back to 1551. Nevertheless, as Evliya \u00c7elebi described, for a long time Timi\u0219oara has been supplied with water from the Bega River. The matter was also confirmed by Henrik Ottendorf, who visited Timi\u0219oara in 1660 and later in 1663.Vlaicu, Ha\u021began, pp. 19\u201321 After Timi\u0219oara had been conquered by the Habsburgs in 1729, an aqueduct began to be built. It was supposed to bring water from Giarmata, but the plan was abandoned. In 1732, a pumping station designed to pump water from Bega and filter it through several layers of sawdust was built on the place where today we can find the marketplace Bishop Alexandru Sterca-\u0218ulu\u021biu. In 1774, engineer Alexander Steinlein designed and built there a water tower to supply the city with water. It was destroyed during the 1849 siege; therefore the town was then supplied with water only from wells.Vlaicu, Ha\u021began, pp. 22\u201324 In 1891, after the demolition of Timi\u0219oara Fortress, the idea of a water supply system and drainage resembling those in other European cities was set in motion and many projects were initiated, some of them, between 1904 and 1907, by .
