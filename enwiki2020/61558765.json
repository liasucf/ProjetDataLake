    "text": "No Way To Prevent This,' Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens\" is the title of a series of articles from The Onion that satirize the frequency of mass shootings in the United States and the lack of action taken in the aftermath of those shootings. Each article is about 200 words long, detailing the location of the shooting and the number of victims. A fictitious resident of a state in which the shooting did not take place is quoted as saying that the shooting was \"a terrible tragedy\", but \"there's nothing anyone can do to stop them\". The article ends by pointing out that the United States is the \"only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past eight years\" and that Americans view themselves and the situation as \"helpless\". == Background == The article was first published on May 27, 2014, following the Isla Vista shooting. Since then, The Onion has republished the same article several times nearly verbatim, with only minor changes to reflect the specifics of each shooting. After The Onion republished the article on February 14, 2018, following the Parkland shooting, Jason Roeder, the writer of the original 2014 article, tweeted that he \"had no idea it would be applied to the high school a mile from [his] house\". \\- The article was again reposted on June 1, 2019, after the 2019 Virginia Beach shooting. == Reception == The New York Times wrote that \"each time The Onion publishes this particular headline, it seems to rocket around the internet with more force\" and that the headline \"with each use, seemed to turn from cheeky political commentary on gun control into a reverberation of despair.\" Mashable wrote that \"[n]othing captures that feeling of frustration and powerlessness\" following major mass shootings as well as these Onion articles, adding that \"[t]here's no shortage of brilliant Onion pieces, but none have resonated\u2014or been as tragically prescient\u2014like the 'No Way' post.\" The Washington Post wrote that, with these articles, The Onion \"appears to capture the frustration and futility felt by so many people\" following mass shootings, noting the increased Internet traffic the articles draw and how popular they are on social media. The Huffington Post cites these articles as \"some of the most resonant commentary on the nation's total lack of action on gun violence\". It goes on to say that they have become \"a staple of the social media response to mass shootings\", citing how widely-shared they are on Facebook and Twitter. The Daily Beast mentioned the articles in a piece titled \"How 'The Onion' Became One of the Strongest Voices for Gun Control\". Similarly, Wired mentioned it in an article discussing the power of The Onion satire in the face of gun violence, titled \"Only The Onion Can Save Us Now\". In 2017, managing editor for The Onion Marnie Shure stated: \"By re-running the same commentary it strengthens the original commentary tenfold each time. ... In the wake of these really terrible things, we have this comment that really holds up.\" == List of articles == As of February 2020, The Onion has published the satirical article 15 times. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Versions of 'No Way To Prevent This,' Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens |- !scope=\"col\"| # !scope=\"col\"| Publication date !scope=\"col\"| Shooting |- !scope=\"row\"| 1 | May 27, 2014, 3:14pm CDT ||Isla Vista, California |- !scope=\"row\"| 2 | June 17, 2015, 5:44pm CDT ||Charleston, South Carolina |- !scope=\"row\"| 3 | October 1, 2015, 5:45pm CDT ||Roseburg, Oregon |- !scope=\"row\"| 4 | December 3, 2015, 8:44pm CDT ||San Bernardino, California |- !scope=\"row\"| 5 | October 2, 2017, 8:46am CDT ||Las Vegas, Nevada |- !scope=\"row\"| 6 | November 5, 2017, 4:38pm CDT ||Sutherland Springs, Texas |- !scope=\"row\"| 7 | February 14, 2018, 5:32pm CDT ||Parkland, Florida |- !scope=\"row\"| 8 | May 18, 2018, 11:48am CDT ||Santa Fe, Texas |- !scope=\"row\"| 9 | September 13, 2018, 12:12pm CDT ||Bakersfield, California |- !scope=\"row\"| 10 | October 29, 2018, 11:39am CDT ||Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |- !scope=\"row\"| 11 | November 8, 2018, 9:44am CDT ||Thousand Oaks, California |- !scope=\"row\"| 12 | June 1, 2019, 10:51am CDT ||Virginia Beach, Virginia |- !scope=\"row\"| 13 | August 4, 2019, 9:33am CDT || El Paso, Texas |- !scope=\"row\"| 14 | August 4, 2019, 9:42am CDT || Dayton, Ohio |- !scope=\"row\"| 15 | February 26, 2020, 5:36pm CDT || Milwaukee, Wisconsin |} == References == Category:The Onion Category:Gun violence in the United States Category:Headlines Category:2014 in internet culture Category:2014 works Category:Recurring events established in 2014 ",
