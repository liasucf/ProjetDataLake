    "text": "Andrew Thomas Lee (born 24 May 1981) is an Australian comedian, musician and children's writer. He is known for working alongside Hamish Blake as part of the comedy duo Hamish & Andy. ==Personal life== Andy Lee is the middle child of Michael and Margaret Lee. Lee has a younger sister, Alex Miles, who writes pantomimes and stars in the comedy show Porky Pies. He also has an older brother, Cameron, with whom Lee started the band Zoophyte. Lee attended Balwyn Primary School and Camberwell Grammar School. He was also a member of the Scouting Movement, performing in Camberwell Showtime and Melbourne Gang Show. He then went on to study Commerce at the University of Melbourne, where he met comedic partner Hamish Blake in 2001. In 2006, Lee was announced as Cleo's Bachelor of the Year. Lee previously dated Megan Gale. They ended their relationship in 2010. In January 2015, it was announced that Lee was dating model and PR Graduate, Rebecca Harding. Their break-up was confirmed by Lee in July 2016. They were reported to have reconciled a few months later. ==Career== ===Hamish & Andy=== Lee (left) and Blake (right) at the 2009 ARIA Awards Lee and Blake teamed with Ryan Shelton and several others to create a show called Radio Karate for RMIT University's student television company RMITV, on community-access television station Channel 31. They also trained with, and appeared on, RMIT's student radio station SYN, and subsequently had a few spot projects on FOX FM. Lee and Blake then hosted a comedy programme on Australia's Seven Network, The Hamish and Andy Show, which was shortly cancelled after bad ratings. Critics acknowledged their talent, but panned the show as poorly executed. Since this show, Lee and Blake have almost always performed together. They are now consistently referred to as Hamish & Andy. Blake and Lee hosted the national (Hit Network) drive-time program Hamish & Andy (radio show) that ran between 4 pm and 6 pm, Monday to Friday. In 2011, the program was cut back to a weekly Friday show due to wanting to pursue other opportunities. The radio show is considered successful, scoring top positions in the radio ratings in the crucial Sydney and Melbourne markets, as well as Perth. Their audience share is around 20%, which is the highest ever recorded for a national FM show in Australia. Lee won the first series of Joker Poker, a celebrity poker show in which contestants win money for charity. He appeared on the Network Ten program Australia's Brainiest Comedian. He was selected as one of the entrants to the Who's Who in Australia 2011 edition. On 10 May 2010, Andy and Hamish appeared on the TV show Good News Week. In 2011 the duo made a deal with Channel Nine, since they have created a ten-part series called Gap Year: New York. In 2012, the comedy duo created a second Gap Year season, titled Hamish and Andy's: Euro Gap Year, in which the two travelled throughout Europe leading up to the 2012 London Olympic Games. In 2013, they continued the Gap Year series, creating a third season titled, Hamish and Andy's: Asia Gap Year. ===Solo work=== Lee was a founding member of Melbourne band Zoophyte, along with his brother Cameron. In 2007, Lee had retired from the band due to other commitments, but occasionally appears as a guest at gigs. In 2015, Lee formed Coolboys and the Frontman with comedic partner Hamish Blake and producer Jack Post. Lee released an educational times table CD in 2003, The Sing Along Times Table CD Book. The CD was re-discovered in 2005/2006 after an \"alert listener\" informed Blake, and teased Lee about it on their radio show. Ahead of the 2020 AFL season, Seven Network's The Front Bar announced that Lee would join original hosts Andy Maher, Mick Molloy and Sam Pang as a regular cast member.The Front Bar \"selects\" Andy Lee in the TV Show Draft The Front Bar on Twitter == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
