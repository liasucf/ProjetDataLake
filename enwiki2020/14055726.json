    "text": "Witold \"Vitek\" Kie\u0142tyka (24 January 1984 - 2 November 2007) was a Polish musician, best known as the drummer and percussionist for the technical death metal band Decapitated, and younger brother of the musician Wac\u0142aw \"Vogg\" Kie\u0142tyka. He had been with the band since its inception in 1996, when he was only twelve years old. He also worked with the death metal bands Dies Irae and Panzer X. He used Pearl drums, Remo drumheads and Alchemy cymbals. ==Death== On October 29, 2007, while traveling to a show in Gomel, Belarus, the bus carrying Decapitated and Crionics was involved in an accident. The tour bus collided with a truck carrying wood, causing serious head injuries to both Kie\u0142tyka and Adrian Kowanek. The two were taken to a hospital in Novozybkov, Russia. While Kie\u0142tyka's family released a statement on November 1, 2007, saying that his condition had improved, he underwent trepanation and was due to be transported to a hospital in Krak\u00f3w, Poland, for further treatment. However, Kie\u0142tyka died on November 2, 2007, at the age of 23. The Norwegian symphonic black metal band Dimmu Borgir played a tribute concert to him on November 2, 2007 at Oulu, Finland. The Polish band Virgin Snatch composed the song \"It's Time\" dedicated to the drummer.Dimmu Borgir Dedicate Show To Decapitated Drummer ==Discography== * (1997) Decapitated - Cemeteral Gardens (Demo) * (1998) Decapitated - The Eye of Horus (Demo) * (2000) Decapitated - Winds of Creation (Wicked World/Earache Records) * (2000) Decapitated - The First Damned (Metal Mind Productions) * (2002) Decapitated - Nihility (Earache Records) * (2004) Decapitated - The Negation (Earache Records) * (2006) Panzer X - Steel Fist (Metal Mind Productions) * (2006) Decapitated - Organic Hallucinosis (Earache Records) ;Posthumous releases * (2008) Decapitated - Human's Dust (DVD) * (2009) Dies Irae - The Art of an Endless Creation (DVD) ==References== * [ Decapitated] at Allmusic ==External links== * Decapitated official site Category:1984 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Decapitated (band) members Category:Polish heavy metal drummers Category:Male drummers Category:Death metal musicians Category:Polish musicians Category:Road incident deaths in Belarus Category:People from Krosno ",
