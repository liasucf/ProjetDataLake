He witnessed the establishment of the Republic of China and Sun Yat-sen and other revolutionary held meetings at his father's home. Liao's family played an instrumental role in the modernisation of education in China. He was appointed to Director of the Department of Sericulture under the Kuomintang (KMT), achieving a great improvement of agriculture through Guangdong province.The Rise and Fall of Guangdong Silk Industry: http://news.dayoo.com/history/201008/24/88669_13685663.htm Liao Chongzhen and the silk industry: http://www.gzzxws.gov.cn/gzws/gzws/ml/39/200809/t20080917_8868.htm Many dams. bridges and irrigation canals in Guangdong province were named by him.

He was the fourth of ten children. His grandfather Liao Xin Tiang \u5ed6\u8398\u7530 and his elder brother were orphans in the mid 19th century. They roamed the streets of Guangzhou, where some Christian proselytizers had set up feeding stations for the hordes of suffering humanity displaced by war and misrule of the Manchus. At age 14, he converted to Christianity. He was self-educated. He became a doctor of Chinese medicine, a Baptist minister fluent in English, and an admirer of democracy. He had one son, Liao Deshan \u5ed6\u5fb7\u5c71.

Sun Yat-sen Xinhai revolution 100th anniversary edition.South China morning post. Birth of Sun heralds dawn of revolutionary era for China. 11 November 1999. Sun Yat-sen played an instrumental role in the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and was appointed to serve as Provisional President of the Republic of China, when it was founded in 1912. When Liao Deshan and Sun Yat-sen returned to Guangzhou, Liao\u2019s home became a meeting place for the revolutionaries and Liao became one of the founders of Kuomintang.Blog about Liao Fengen: http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_48c39e9b010142dz.html Liao Deshan believed in universal suffrage, advocated the equality of the sexes, education of women, unbinding women's feet, and abolishing polygamy. He, along with Sun and others, went into exile in Japan in 1908, when the Manchus came after them. In 1890 he found the Pui Ching Middle Schools \u57f9\u6b63\u4e2d\u5b78 which is still a thriving institution in Hong Kong and Macau, which insisted on excellence in both Chinese and Math, way ahead of his time. Two Nobel Prize winners in physics were students there. He, unusual in his time, or any time, actually practiced what he preached. When he was a young doctor during the 1880s and 1890s, he went from village to village, offering medical care. When the peasants couldn't pay him, they often asked what they could do for him. He asked if they would allow him to unbind their daughters' feet. Quite often, the peasants allowed him; even though it was dangerous to go against age-old customs, because he had saved lives and spared them pain. When his eldest daughter asked why he was so adamant in unbinding women's feet, he replied: \"Because women pass their pains onto their children.\" Liao Deshan originated the slogan: \u2018Save China through education\u2019. He had one wife, and 10 children. Three sons and seven daughters, none of the girls had bound feet, which was rare during the last days of the Qing dynasty. He was employed at Lingnan University \u5dba\u5357\u5927\u5b78 as a doctor and physiology professor. in exchange for his services he asked his children to be studying there for free. Then, through his connection with the churches in New England, he managed to have almost all his children (his last daughter reached maturity after the passing of her father so was not able to do further studies) to be university educated. Liao Deshan and family ==A family dedicated to education== All Liao Chongzhen's sisters were outstanding people who dedicated their lives to \u2018Change through education\u2019 and all studied at Lingnan University \u5dba\u5357\u5927\u5b78(Guangzhou \u5ee3\u5dde), (the number in parenthesis after their name indicates the order of birth):Rich by three generation, private blog: http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_a331f5dc0102v3we.html Liao Chongzhen and family \u5ed6\u5949\u737b (Liao Fengxian) (1) was educated at the College of Wooster and at Wellesley College got a Master in education at Columbia University and was one of the earliest women who went to graduate school.Memories of Principal Zhong Ron: http://www.gzzxws.gov.cn/gzws/gzws/ml/24/200809/t20080912_7388.htm She was instrumental in opening up Chinese universities to women.

You have certainly given a new impetus to my religious life. I have found in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings that something which I have hitherto sought for in vain. I find that it satisfied both the requirements of the intellect and the longings of the heart. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed movement appeals to me in that it is a movement for the doing away of all kinds of prejudice, which is so detrimental to all kinds of thinking both spiritually and intellectually and for the ushering in of the new era of universal brotherhood through the spirit of good will.\" \u5ed6\u5949\u57fa (Liao Fengji) (3) after studying at Lingnan University and UK she moved to study her master at Bryn Mawr College in 1918.

In 1931, on her way back to China she stopped in Yokohama, Japan, where she met Agnes Alexander, Keith Ransom-Kehler and some Japanese friends. Agnes Alexander recalls: \u201cWhile her steamer was in port in Yokohama, Miss Liu came to Tokyo and spent a night with us.

Such teachings at their lowest estimate could not harm any nation and at their highest they could do great good in China and in every country. No nation is more fitted to receive these Teachings than China.\u201d Liao's family also arranged for her lectures over the Canton radio and lecture at Sun Yatsen University and secondary schools. Three of her translated radio broadcast lectures 'New Universal Language', 'Esperanto As a Universal Language' and 'What is the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Movement?' were published in a special two-page-spread supplement of the Canton Municipal Daily News on 23 September 1930.

His article, \"A Chinese view of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Cause\", appeared in Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World 1932\u20131934. In 1933 Liao Chongzhen will start a correspondence with Shoghi Effendi (the Guardian of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith) asking how he can best serve the Faith. The Guardian asks him to concentrate his efforts in the translation of the Writings into Chinese. In few years he will manage to translate \u2018Tablets of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h\u2019 (finished translation in 1938),Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World, Vol. 7: http://bahai.works/Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed_World/Volume_VII/Part_IV \u2018The Hidden Words\u2019 \u5927\u540c\u6559\u96b1\u8a00\u7d93 (published in Canton in 1937), 'The Hidden Words', by Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h,Printed Canton 1937 of which he printed 2000 copies and \u2018Prayers and meditations\u2019 (Unpublished). In one of his letters he writes: \u201cThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith is very broad and profound, is the guide for salvation. Its value is infinite. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith emphasizes on practicing not on preaching. I truly believe that the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith is the remedy for the disputes of today's world and the basis of setting up a new world.\u201d On 30 November 1936 he writes to Martha Root about his progress in translating the Writings stating: \u201cI am looking forward to the day that I can devote all my time into the translation of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed literature into Chinese. There is much gain in translation and our country needs the Cause so much.\u201d in January, 1936, the Guardian invited the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed youth of the world to a joint celebration of Naw-R\u00faz. In demonstration of the international unity amongst Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed youth, 26 regional conferences were organized around the globe on Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Naw-R\u00faz 1936. Conferences occurred in 16 cities in North America and in London, Paris, Hamburg, Heidelberg, Alexandria, Baghdad, Karachi, Poona, Canton and Tokyo. Liao Chongzhen who, wishing to join the international celebration, announced through the newspapers a meeting at the Asia Hotel. Ten strangers were his guests and have formed the nucleus of a study group. \u2018The delegates at every conference signed a letter which read as follows: > \u201cDearly beloved Guardian: Today young Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds are celebrating in > international conferences the inauguration of another Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed year. In unity > with our fellows throughout the world we have joined in a new determination > to serve the Cause of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. The thought underlying all our efforts is > that, led by your wishes and stimulated by your prayers and trust in us, we > may rise to those heights of endeavor to which the example of your own life > so clearly directs us. May the seed of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's Word find in our hearts > soil which, prepared by service and study, enriched by tests, and > continually nourished by His blessings, may attain capacity to produce His > fruits. That our lives may bear testimony to the reality of our Faith, > becoming thus potent instruments for the shaping of His great civilization, > is our deepest hope. To you, our beloved Guardian, and to the members of the > Holy Family and friends of the household, we send our tender love and > devotion, longing to become more worthy, that we may be in truth your > coworkers in the establishment of the World Order of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h.\" To their message the Guardian cabled in reply: \u2018Overjoyed, deeply thankful. Appreciate greeting. Loving remembrance Holy Shrine.' Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World, Vol. 6: : http://bahai-library.com/pdf/bw/bahai_world_volume_6.pdf And on August 10th 1937 he writes Martha Root: \u201cThe compliment that you gave me, I am afraid I do not deserve. Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h is the hope of the world. What else can we do but turn to Him in this wartorn world. As I am quite pressed with time, I try to do a little translation each morning before going to work. My humble contribution can never be compared with what you have done for the Cause.\u201d Liao will continue to be in contact with the Guardian and he will add to one of the letter the picture of himself and his family. The Guardian hung the portrait on the wall in one of the rooms of the Mansion of Bahj\u00ed in Akk\u00e1, Palestine. ==The war years== The atmosphere in Canton was intense, due to the expected Japanese invasion. His wife and children subsequently moved to safety to stay with her parents. Liao Chongzhen initially stayed in Canton and in 1938 wrote this moving letter to the Guardian: \u201cIn the midst of bombs and bullets I have completed the translation of the books, for I believe the eventual salvation of the world lies in the realizations of the principles of Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h and I want to perform my small part in bringing these glad tidings to our people.\u201d Liao Chongzhen moved to Hong Kong in 1938, becoming the first Chinese Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed to live in the British Colony. In 1940, with the evacuation of Hong Kong, he moved back to the mainland to work for the provincial government of Guilin, which was not under Japanese control. In 1944 Liao Chongzhen returned to Canton, living in the Shamean area until 1949. In 1949 he again moved to Hong Kong with his family to stay with his sister Liao Fengjie. However, his wife, pregnant with their last child, returned to Canton along with her children. Liao Chongzhen followed her back to Canton for a few months, but later, as his life was at risk, he returned, with just few items on him, to Hong Kong. There he stayed for three years and then sailed to the United States, living there for the rest of his life. ==Final years in United States== While in the United States, Liao Chongzhen continued with his translation work as witnesses the correspondence he had with the Asian Teaching Committee. He also visited the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed temple at Wilmette and was in contact with Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in his city. In 1965 his daughter Da Wen was able to move to the United States. The father and daughter who had never met will meet for the first time in New York. All other kids and his wife will not see Liao Chongzhen from 1949 until his death. Da Wen, now 16 years old, will move to stay with her uncle Liao Chongguo in Chicago. Da Wen recalls: \"He told me that he found the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed explanation of God more humble: God is an unknowable essence, far from human comprehension. He also liked the universality of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, that is inclusive and open. He never forced me to accept the Faith. He just shared what he believed in. I was just a teen, but I remember. In one of his visits to Chicago, he accompanied me to visit the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship, which is a magnificent piece of architecture and eventually was my inspiration to become an architect.\" ==In popular culture== A film on the life of Liao Chongzhen \"Liao Chongzhen \u2013 A bright candle of the light of humanity\" has been released in April 2015. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPRjKsNILuA ==References== Category:1898 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Cornell University alumni ",
