    "text": "La Jolla Shores Beach This is a list of beaches in San Diego County, located in Southern California in the United States. The beaches are listed in order from north to south, and they are grouped (where applicable) by the community in which the beach is situated. Some beaches in the San Diego area are long continuous stretches of sandy coastline, others, like many of the beaches in the Village of La Jolla (which was built on a large rocky promontory), are small sand beaches within rocky coves or between rocky points. A number of beaches in the San Diego area have cliffs behind them, usually composed of rather soft sandstone; some other beaches front freshwater lagoons where rivers run into the coast. ==Beaches in North County== This list of beaches in San Diego's North County is arranged from north to south; the beaches are grouped by the communities in which they occur. Although in some areas there may be a continuous long stretch of sand along several miles of coastline, especially so during low tides, nonetheless there may be different beach names at different locations, according to where the beach is accessed. * San Onofre State Beachsandiego.org website, What to Do, Beaches, San Onofre Accessed 2014-5-4 ** Upper Trestles ** Trestles ** Lower Trestles, Church ** Old Man's ** Trails * Camp Pendleton a.k.a.
