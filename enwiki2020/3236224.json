    "text": "Subedar-major is the senior rank of junior commissioned officer in the Indian and Pakistani Armies, and formerly a Viceroy's commissioned officer in the British Indian Army. Although commissioned, they would be considered as senior enlisted personnel and fulfil a role similar to that of the most senior non- commissioned officers in other armies. A battalion's single subedar-major assists the commander in much the same way as a regimental sergeant major would (to the extent that this rank, known as regimental havildar major, is now almost obsolete in the Indian Army). Under British rule a subedar-major wore the crown of a full major, a tradition which has continued with slight variation after independence. India now uses Ashoka lions with a gold and red stripe below, and Pakistan a wreathed star and crescent with green and red. These stripes separate subedar-majors from full commissioned Majors. In the cavalry, the equivalent rank is Risaldar-Major. Subedar-Major or Risaldar- Major equated to a British Major and Subedar or Risaldar to Captain, although junior to all British officers. ==References== Category:Military ranks of Pakistan Category:Military ranks of India Category:Military ranks of British India ",
