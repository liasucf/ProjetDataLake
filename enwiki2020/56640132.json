Lord Melville, Thomas Arman, master, was in company with Sea Horse and Boadicea on 30 January 1816. These ships were travelling together carrying soldiers and their families to Cork at the end of the Napoleonic War when all three wrecked, two with heavy loss of life. Lord Melville failed to clear Kinsale Head and was driven onto a shoal 300 metres (330 yards) from the shore. However she did not break up. Her only losses occurred when a boat was launched containing four women, one child, and eight men; this boat foundered and only one person survived. The remainder of her crew and of the 479 passengers survived and left the ship as the gale subsided overnight.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 35, pp.403-7. ==Citations and references== Citations References * Category:1810 ships Category:Age of Sail merchant ships of England Category:Maritime incidents in 1816 ",
