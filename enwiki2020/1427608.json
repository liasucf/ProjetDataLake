    "text": "In the field of Egyptology, transliteration of Ancient Egyptian is the process of converting (or mapping) texts written in the Egyptian language to alphabetic symbols representing uniliteral hieroglyphs or their hieratic and Demotic counterparts. This process facilitates the publication of texts where the inclusion of photographs or drawings of an actual Egyptian document is impractical. Transliteration is not the same as transcription. Transcription seeks to reproduce the pronunciation of a text. For example, the name of the founder of the Twenty-second Dynasty is transliterated as \u0161\u0161nq but transcribed Shoshenq in English, in French, in Dutch, and or in German. Because exact details regarding the phonetics of Egyptian are not completely known, most transcriptions depend on Coptic for linguistic reconstruction or are theoretical in nature. Egyptologists, therefore, rely on transliteration in scientific publications. ==Standards== Important as transliteration is to the field of Egyptology, there is no one standard scheme in use for hieroglyphic and hieratic texts. Some might even argue that there are as many systems of transliteration as there are Egyptologists. However, there are a few closely related systems that can be regarded as conventional. Many non-German-speaking Egyptologists use the system described in Gardiner 1954, whereas many German- speaking scholars tend to opt for that used in the W\u00f6rterbuch der \u00e4gyptischen Sprache (Erman and Grapow 1926\u20131953), the standard dictionary of the ancient Egyptian language. However, there is a growing trend, even among English- speaking scholars, to adopt a modified version of the method used in the W\u00f6rterbuch (e.g., Allen 2000). Although these conventional approaches to transliteration have been followed since most of the second half of the nineteenth century to the present day, there have been some attempts to adopt a modified system that seeks to utilise the International Phonetic Alphabet to a certain degree. The most successful of these is that developed by Wolfgang Schenkel (1990), and it is being used fairly widely in Germany and other German-speaking countries. More recent is a proposal by Thomas Schneider (2003) that is even closer to the IPA, but its usage is not presently common. The major criticism leveled against both of these systems is that they give an impression of being much more scientifically accurate with regard to the pronunciation of Egyptian. Unfortunately this perceived accuracy is debatable. Moreover, the systems reflect only the theoretical pronunciation of Middle Egyptian and not the older and later phases of the language, which are themselves to be transliterated with the same system. ===Table of transliteration schemes=== There are 24 consonantal phonemes distinguished in Egyptian writing, following Edel (1955)E. Edel, Alt\u00e4qyptische Grammatik, Analecta Orientalia 34, 39, Rome (1955, 1964). transliterated and ordered alphabetically in the sequence: \ua723 j \ua725 w b p f m n r h \u1e25 \u1e2b \u1e96 z s \u0161 q k g t \u1e6f d \u1e0f.

However, in 1980, Demotists adopted a single, uniform, international standard based on the traditional system used for hieroglyphic, but with the addition of some extra symbols for vowels and other letters that were written in the Demotic script. The Demotic Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago (or CDD) utilises this method. As this system is likely only of interest to specialists, for details see the references below. * * * * * ==Encoding== In 1984 a standard, ASCII-based transliteration system was proposed by an international group of Egyptologists at the first Table ronde informatique et \u00e9gyptologie and published in 1988 (see Buurman, Grimal, et al., 1988). This has come to be known as the Manuel de Codage (or MdC) system, based on the title of the publication, Inventaire des signes hi\u00e9roglyphiques en vue de leur saisie informatique: Manuel de codage des textes hi\u00e9roglyphiques en vue de leur saisie sur ordinateur. It is widely used in e-mail discussion lists and internet forums catering to professional Egyptologists and the interested public. Although the Manuel de codage system allows for simple \"alphabetic\" transliterations, it also specifies a complex method for electronically encoding complete ancient Egyptian texts, indicating features such as the placement, orientation, and even size of individual hieroglyphs. This system is used (though frequently with modifications) by various software packages developed for typesetting hieroglyphic texts (such as SignWriter, WinGlyph, MacScribe, InScribe, Glyphotext, WikiHiero, and others). ===Unicode=== With the introduction of the Latin Extended Additional block to Unicode version 1.1 (1992), the addition of Egyptological alef and ayin to Unicode version 5.1 (2008) and the addition of Glottal I alias Egyptological yod to Unicode version 12.0 (2019), it is now possible to fully transliterate Egyptian texts using a Unicode typeface. The following table only lists the special characters used in various transliteration schemes (see above). {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Transcription characters in Unicode |- !

Although three Egyptological and Ugariticist letters were proposed in August 2000,Everson, Michael. Proposal to add 6 Egyptological characters to the UCS, 2000-08-27 it was not until 2008 (Unicode 5.1) two of the three letters were encoded: aleph and ayin (minor and capital). Another two proposals were made regarding the Egyptological yod,Everson, Michael and Bob Richmond, EGYPTOLOGICAL YOD and Cyrillic breathing, 2008-04-08Everson, Michael, Proposal to encode Egyptological Yod and similar characters in the UCS, 2008-08-04 the eventual result of which was to accept the use of the Cyrillic psili pneumata () as one of several possible diacritics for this purpose. The other options use the superscript comma (U+0313) and the right half ring above (U+0357). A new attempt for a sign called LETTER I WITH SPIRITUS LENIS was made in 2017.Michel Suignard, Proposal to encode Egyptological Yod and similar characters in the UCS, 2017-05-09 (cf. the later 2008 proposal). Within the Egyptological community objection were raised concerning this name.List Egyptian - Egyptian Hieroglyphs in the UCS http://evertype.com/pipermail/egyptian_evertype.com/2017-June/thread.html. The proposed name was changed to EGYPTOLOGICAL YOD before finally becoming GLOTTAL I. The sign was added in March 2019 with the release of Unicode 12.0.

There is at least one hieroglyph with a phonetic value corresponding to each of these phonemes. The table below gives a list of such \"uniliteral signs\" along with their conventional transcription and their conventional \"Egyptological pronunciation\" and probable phonetic value. Many hieroglyphs are coloured, though the paint has worn off most stone inscriptions. Colors vary, but many glyphs are predominantly one colour or another, or a particular combination (such as red on the top and blue on the bottom). In some cases, two graphically similar glyphs may be distinguished solely by colour, though in other cases it's not known if the choice of colour had any meaning. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! colspan=\"9\"|Uniliteral signs |- ! colspan=\"4\"|Sign ! colspan=\"3\"|Egyptological transliteration and pronunciation ! colspan=\"2\"|Phonetic values (IPA)Loprieno, Antonio (2001) \u201cFrom Ancient Egyptian to Coptic\u201d in Haspelmath, Martin et al.
