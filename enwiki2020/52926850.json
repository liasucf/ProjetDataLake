    "text": "Bongo Botrako is a Spanish alternative rock band formed in Tarragona, Spain in 2007 by lead vocalist and songwriter Uri Gin\u00e9. The band released their first studio album, Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol, in 2010; it featured their most notable hit, \"Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol\" (also known as \"Chipir\u00f3n\"), which peaked at #12 on the Spain Songs chart. In 2012 they released their second studio album, Revoltosa, leading to extensive tours across eleven European countries. The band's first and only live album, Punk Parranda, was released in 2014. In October 2015, Bongo Botrako announced an indefinite hiatus and a six-date farewell tour, performing their last concert on December 26, 2015. ==History== ===Early years (2007\u20132009)=== Bongo Botrako frontman Uri Gin\u00e9 joined punk rock band Extracto de L\u00fapulo as its guitarist, backing vocalist and songwriter in 2003. Some of the songs he wrote didn't fit in the genre of the band, so he kept them apart. In October 2007, Gin\u00e9 decided to create his own band with all those songs and named it Bongo Botrako. He recorded a ten- track demo at his small home studio, programming the drums and performing all the rest of instruments himself. After passing the demo around, Gin\u00e9 quickly recruited eight more musicians: Nacho Pascual on guitar, Xavi Vallverd\u00fa on keyboard, Marc Vallverd\u00fa on bass, Gorka Robert on drums, Pitus Siles on percussion, Xavi Artiol on trumpet, \u00c0lex Huguet on trombone and Merc\u00e8 Verge on backing vocals. They started rehearsing in January 2008 and they performed live for the first time on March 20, 2008 in their hometown, Tarragona. There were some line-up changes in 2008 and early 2009: Merc\u00e8 Verge left the band, Xavi Latorre replaced Pitus Siles on percussion, Xavi Barrero replaced Xavi Artiol on trumpet, Juanhito Saez replaced \u00c0lex Huguet on trombone and Oscar G\u00f3mez joined the band as saxophonist. In February and March 2009, the band recorded a self-produced seven-track demo, called La maketa, in their rehearsal space. A few days before the expected release date for the demo, Uri Gin\u00e9 wrote the song \"Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol\" while being in Granada, Spain. 500 CD copies of the demo were already being produced at that moment, so they had no time to include the new song. The demo La maketa was released on May 5, 2009 and the band sold the CD copies in their concerts. The song \"Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol\" was premiered live in Lleida, Spain on May 7, 2009 and it became an instant success in every concert of their catalan tour, despite not being included in the demo. Uri Gin\u00e9 left Extracto de L\u00fapulo on September 24, 2009 to focus entirely on Bongo Botrako. After almost two years running both bands at the same time, Bongo Botrako had become way more successful than Extracto de L\u00fapulo and many gigs started to coincide, so Gin\u00e9 felt the need to make the move. In late 2009, there were some more line-up changes that finally set the current line-up: Juanhito Saez and Xavi Latorre left the band, and David Garcia replaced Marc Vallverd\u00fa on bass. ===Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol (2010\u20132011)=== As a result of the buzz created by the song \"Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol\", the band caught the attention of Joni Sah\u00fan, an A&R; rep for the independent record label Kasba Music. They recorded their debut album Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol in La Atl\u00e1ntida Studio in Barcelona and released it on September 27, 2010 in Spain on Kasba Music. The album was later also released in France, Germany, United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Japan. The band's first headline tour started in October 2010 and took them to many sold-out indoor venues across Spain. During spring and summer of 2011, they played well-received sets at festivals in Spain and France which helped add to their growing fanbase. Bongo Botrako released the music video for the album's first single \"Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol\" on June 23, 2011. The song became very popular in Spain after the men's national basketball team, including Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol and Ricky Rubio, took the habit of singing it before every game in the EuroBasket 2011 Championship, which they eventually won. In September 2011, \"Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol\" peaked at #12 on the Spain Songs chart and #2 on the iTunes Spain Songs chart. The song accumulates more than 15 million streamings on YouTube and more than 7 million streamings on Spotify, which ultimately makes it Bongo Botrako's most popular song by far. In October 2011, after attending a live show, Germ\u00e1n Quimas\u00f3 of Sonde3 Producciones became the band's manager, a role that Uri Gin\u00e9 had played until then. ===Revoltosa (2012\u20132013)=== Uri Gin\u00e9 performing with Bongo Botrako at Vi\u00f1a Rock Festival 2012 in Spain. The band's second studio album, Revoltosa, was recorded in Garate Studios in Andoain, Spain and produced by Spanish musician Amparo S\u00e1nchez, also known as Amparanoia. It was released on November 12, 2012 in Spain, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Japan on Kasba Music. The music video for the album's first single \"Revoltosa\" was released on November 15, 2012 amid controversy surrounding the appearance of riot police officers having fun while using brutal violence against a crowd of peaceful protesters. Uri Gin\u00e9 explained that they wanted to denounce police brutality and noted that they used sarcasm, satire and humour because they thought it would attract more attention on the issue than showing realistic images, since people is overexposed to this kind of images. During 2012 and 2013, the band embarked on an extensive tour that took them to France, Italy, Netherlands, Austria, Andorra, Belgium and Switzerland. They also became a frequent act in the line-up of Spanish major festivals such as Vi\u00f1a Rock or Arenal Sound. ===Punk Parranda and hiatus announcement (2014\u20132015)=== Bongo Botrako performing their last concert before the hiatus. The band's first and only live album, Punk Parranda, was released on November 3, 2014 on Kasba Music. They recorded it performing to a crowd of more than 60,000 people at Vi\u00f1a Rock Festival on May 2, 2014 in Villarrobledo, Spain. During 2014 and 2015, the band continued touring Europe and visited France, Italy, Netherlands, Austria, Andorra, United Kingdom, Germany and Czech Republic. They reached particular success in the Netherlands, where they played a sold-out indoor tour and some major festivals such as Lowlands 2014, Parkpop 2015 and Zwarte Cross 2015. On October 13, 2015, Bongo Botrako announced an indefinite hiatus and a six-date farewell tour in a statement via their official website: > \"With this release we Bongo Botrako announce that we\u2019ve decided to stop. > It\u2019s been eight years now since we started, quite a while. Eight years of > joy, of good friends, of incredible collaborations, of exhausting travels, > of wild parties and also of some wounds. But above all it\u2019s been eight years > we wouldn\u2019t change for anything in this world. And now it\u2019s time to breathe. > Because the path enriches the heart but it\u2019s also a weight for it. And we > don\u2019t want to continue if it\u2019s not with the same enthusiasm of the first > day. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a see you later or a goodbye, time will tell.\" \u2013 > Bongo Botrako Uri Gin\u00e9 explained that he felt exhausted after eight years of non-stop touring and noted that the band had lost the enthusiasm. However, he said he would continue to write songs and he left the door open to create a new music project in the future. Bongo Botrako performed their last and 500th concert in Gin\u00e9's hometown Tarragona on December 26, 2015. ==Musical style== Gin\u00e9 has often proclaimed the band's music as \"punk parranda\", which translates as \"punk party\". He explains that it's not a very accurate label but he likes it because it comprises the punk soul, understood as social activism and fast- paced songs, and the festive tone, characterized by positive messages and danceable rhythms. Bongo Botrako has been described as alternative rock, reggae rock, ska punk, reggae and ska. Many people have also labeled their music as catalan rumba, but they have tried to distance themselves from this label claiming that they have only released three rumba-classifiable songs, all of them in their first album. The band has been known for radically transforming some of their songs when played live, often delivering fast-paced and hard-eged live versions from originally slower and quieter songs. Bongo Botrako's sound has been compared to Mano Negra, The Clash, Bob Marley and Kortatu. Indeed, current Manu Chao's Radio Bemba bassist Gambeat produced the band's live shows from 2011 to 2015. ==Activism== Bongo Botrako has spoken out against animal torture and police brutality. They support Amnesty International and performed two benefit shows for them in Barcelona, in 2012 and 2013. They also included an Amnesty International quote in the music video for their song \"Revoltosa\" in 2012. ==Members== ===Current members=== * Uri Gin\u00e9 \u2013 lead vocals, guitar (2007\u20132015) * Nacho Pascual \u2013 guitar, backing vocals (2008\u20132015) * Xavi Vallverd\u00fa \u2013 keyboard, backing vocals (2008\u20132015) * David Garcia \u2013 bass, backing vocals (2009\u20132015) * Gorka Robert \u2013 drums, backing vocals (2008\u20132015) * Xavi Barrero \u2013 trumpet, backing vocals (2008\u20132015) * Oscar G\u00f3mez \u2013 sax, backing vocals (2009\u20132015) ===Former members=== * Marc Vallverd\u00fa \u2013 bass (2008\u20132009) * Pitus Siles \u2013 percussion (2008) * Xavi Latorre \u2013 percussion (2008\u20132009) * Xavi Artiol \u2013 trumpet (2008) * \u00c0lex Huguet \u2013 trombone (2008\u20132009) * Juanhito S\u00e1ez \u2013 trombone (2008\u20132009) * Merc\u00e8 Verge \u2013 backing vocals (2008) ===Timeline=== ImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:30 PlotArea = left:85 bottom:100 top:25 right:20 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/10/2007 till:31/12/2015 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4 ScaleMajor = increment:1 start:2008 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2008 Colors = id:vocals value:red legend:Lead_vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:keys value:lightpurple legend:Keyboard id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:redorange legend:Drums id:percu value:lightorange legend:Percussion id:trumpet value:coral legend:Trumpet id:trombon value:yellowgreen legend:Trombone id:sax value:lavender legend:Sax id:backing value:yelloworange legend:Backing_vocals id:studio value:black legend:Studio_albums id:live value:gray(0.7) legend:Live_albums BarData = bar:Uri text:\"Uri Gin\u00e9\" bar:Nacho text:\"Nacho Pascual\" bar:XaviV text:\"Xavi Vallverd\u00fa\" bar:Marc text:\"Marc Vallverd\u00fa\" bar:David text:\"David Garcia\" bar:Gorka text:\"Gorka Robert\" bar:Pitus text:\"Pitus Siles\" bar:XaviL text:\"Xavi Latorre\" bar:XaviA text:\"Xavi Artiol\" bar:XaviB text:\"Xavi Barrero\" bar:Alex text:\"\u00c0lex Huguet\" bar:Juanh text:\"Juanhito S\u00e1ez\" bar:Oscar text:\"Oscar G\u00f3mez\" bar:Merce text:\"Merc\u00e8 Verge\" PlotData= width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(11,-4) bar:Uri from:01/10/2007 till:26/12/2015 color:vocals bar:Uri from:01/10/2007 till:26/12/2015 color:guitar width:3 bar:Nacho from:01/01/2008 till:26/12/2015 color:guitar bar:Nacho from:01/01/2008 till:26/12/2015 color:backing width:3 bar:XaviV from:01/01/2008 till:26/12/2015 color:keys bar:XaviV from:01/01/2008 till:26/12/2015 color:backing width:3 bar:Marc from:01/01/2008 till:14/12/2009 color:bass bar:David from:15/12/2009 till:26/12/2015 color:bass bar:David from:15/12/2009 till:26/12/2015 color:backing width:3 bar:Gorka from:01/01/2008 till:26/12/2015 color:drums bar:Gorka from:07/05/2009 till:26/12/2015 color:backing width:3 bar:Pitus from:01/01/2008 till:31/07/2008 color:percu bar:XaviL from:06/12/2008 till:23/10/2009 color:percu bar:XaviA from:01/01/2008 till:31/05/2008 color:trumpet bar:XaviB from:01/06/2008 till:26/12/2015 color:trumpet bar:XaviB from:20/02/2009 till:26/12/2015 color:backing width:3 bar:Alex from:01/01/2008 till:10/01/2009 color:trombon bar:Juanh from:03/05/2008 till:18/10/2009 color:trombon bar:Oscar from:20/02/2009 till:26/12/2015 color:sax bar:Oscar from:25/02/2011 till:26/12/2015 color:backing width:3 bar:Merce from:01/01/2008 till:19/04/2008 color:backing LineData = at:27/09/2010 color:studio layer:back at:12/11/2012 color:studio layer:back at:03/11/2014 color:live layer:back ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol (2010) * Revoltosa (2012) ===Live albums=== * Punk Parranda (2014) ==Awards== Bongo Botrako won the Catalan Bookers Association Award for \"Best Indoor Tour\" in 2013 and the Enderrock Award for \"Best Band in Foreign Language\" in 2014. ==References== ==External links== * * Bongo Botrako on Twitter Category:Spanish rock music groups Category:Spanish alternative rock groups Category:Tarragona ",
