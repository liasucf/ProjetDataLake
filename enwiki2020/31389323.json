    "text": "Helional (from heliotropin, from which is it commonly derived) is a chemical compound used as a perfume in soap and laundry detergent. Chemically it is an aldehyde with a hydrocinnamaldehyde motif; a structural element which is present in a number of other important commercial fragrances and odorants. ==Synthesis== Several synthetic routes exist but the most common is a crossed- aldol condensation between piperonal (heliotropin) and propanal followed by selective hydrogenation of the intermediate alkene. This produces a racemic product. ==See also== *Cyclamen aldehyde *Lilial *Hexyl cinnamaldehyde ==References== Category:Benzodioxoles Category:Aldehydes Category:Perfume ingredients ",
