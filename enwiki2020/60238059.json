    "text": "\"Boasty\" is a song by British rappers Wiley, Stefflon Don and Jamaican rapper Sean Paul featuring vocals from English actor and musician Idris Elba. It was originally released by Wiley featuring Mucky in August 2018, and remixed for release with contributions from Stefflon Don, Paul and Elba in January 2019. It reached number 11 on the UK Singles Chart in March 2019. A solo version of the track was released on the rapper's 14th studio album, Boasty Gang - The Album, which was released on 22 June, 2020. ==Music video== The music video, directed by Henry Scholfield, was released in March 2019, featuring Stefflon Don, Paul and Elba, with a young actor, Brooklyn Appiah, appearing in place of Wiley. Idris Elba delivers his verse in a mansion that includes a film set. Scholfield said that he wanted the video to feel like a competition between the artists \"competing for lyrical screen-space\" to give the \"vibe of bigupmanship and a visual riff on who's the boasty-iest\". As of 5 August 2020, the music video is no longer available to watch on YouTube, as Wiley Official, the channel on which it was uploaded, has been terminated. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 82 |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 2090 |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles (Official Charts Company) | 50 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Wiley (musician) songs Category:Stefflon Don songs Category:Sean Paul songs Category:Idris Elba songs Category:Songs written by Wiley (musician) Category:Songs written by Stefflon Don Category:Songs written by Sean Paul ",
