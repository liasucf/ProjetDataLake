    "text": "The Minnie Priest Dunton House was designed by John E. Tourtellotte and constructed in Boise, Idaho, United States, in 1899. The original Queen Anne design was that of a single family home, but the house was remodeled by Tourtellotte & Hummel in 1913 and became a seven-bedroom boardinghouse with Tudor Revival features. Dunton named her house \"Rosemere\" for her rose garden. It was included as a contributing property in the Fort Street Historic District on November 12, 1982. The house was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 17, 1982. Minnietta \"Minnie\" Priest Dunton was an early advocate of women's rights in Idaho, and she was appointed Idaho State Librarian in 1907. Her husband, Herbert W. Dunton, served as district attorney for Boise County, Idaho Territory, in the 1880s. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Houses completed in 1899 Category:Queen Anne architecture in Idaho Category:Houses in Boise, Idaho Category:National Register of Historic Places in Boise, Idaho Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Idaho Category:Individually listed contributing properties to historic districts on the National Register in Idaho ",
