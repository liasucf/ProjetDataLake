He is attributed to be a pupil of Giuseppe Diamantini, and possibly Gregorio Lazzarini. He appears to be influenced by Sebastiano Ricci. During 1726 and 1727 he was a member of the Venetian painter's guild (Fraglia). He painted a series of works for the Scuola Grande dei Carmini in Venice and an altarpiece of St Antony for the church of San Nicol\u00f2 dei Mendicoli.Museo del Prado, short biography. ==Paintings from the Carmini, Venice== Scuola Grande dei Carmini (Venice) - Scalone e corridoio - La Fede di Sante Piatti.jpg|Faith Scuola Grande dei Carmini (Venice) - Scalone e corridoio - La Speranza di Sante Piatti.jpg|Hope Scuola Grande dei Carmini (Venice) - Scalone e corridoio - La Carit\u00e0 di Sante Piatti.jpg|Charity ==References== Category:1687 births Category:1747 deaths Category:Italian male painters Category:18th-century Italian painters Category:Venetian painters ",
