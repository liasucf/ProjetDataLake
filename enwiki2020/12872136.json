The office at Magdalena Farm is also the home base for McPeek Racing, Magdalena Racing Partnerships, and Horse Races Now, the comprehensive horse racing APP. Currently, the farm has over 150 horses that are either racing, training, or being broken to saddle. The farm also handles mares and foals, as well as layups, thereby covering all stages of a horse's career. ==Mobile app== McPeek has developed a mobile app to provide comprehensive horse racing video and data for new fans and veteran horseplayers, called Horse Races Now. He reported that he came up with the idea for a horse racing app while watching CNBC's Planet of the Apps, a one- hour program that explored the explosion of mobile technology, specifically through phone applications. \"During the show, I Googled 'horse racing apps' and there weren't any. I kind of politicked around and checked with some people to see if this was something that was happening. Long and short, I ended up doing it on my own because I just felt like it needed to be done.\" McPeek launched Horse Races Now on March 27, 2012, and four years later, McPeek reported in a radio interview that the app had been downloaded over 500,000 times. ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Racehorse trainers Category:University of Kentucky alumni Category:Sportspeople from Fort Smith, Arkansas Category:Sportspeople from Lexington, Kentucky ",
