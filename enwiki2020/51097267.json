He was local governor at Elkab. =Biography= Sobeknakht I started his career as a King's Son and Overseer of the gs-pr. Later, he became Governor of Elkab. The overseer of the gs-pr was a royal estate manager in provinces often associated with the overseer of the sealed things (treasury), and was also connected to future governors.Juan Carlos Moreno Garc\u00eda (2013) Ancient Egyptian Administration, p. 557 =Attestation= Sobeknakht I is mainly known from two sources; the Juridical Stele and tomb inscriptions. ==Juridical Stela== The Juridical Stela documents the transfer of the Governorship of Elkab from a certain Kebsi to a relative, Sobeknakht I, in Year 01 of king Nebiriau. Kebsi had inherited this office from his father Iymeru when the latter became vizier. Iymeru had in turn inherited it from his elder brother Aya junior, who died prematurely without children. Prior to this, Aya Junior had inherited the office from their father Aya who became vizier in Year 01 of Merhotepre. ==Elkab Tomb Inscription== Sobeknakht I is known from the inscriptions in the tomb of the local governor Sobeknakht II as the father of the latter.Joseph John Tylor: Wall drawings and monuments of El Kab, The Tomb of Sebeknekht, London 1896, pl. XI Furthermore, from these inscriptions it is clear that the wife of Sobeknakht I was a woman with the title hereditary princess and the name Nofru. Only recently his tomb was identified at Elkab. The inscriptions in the tomb are only badly preserved, but the mentioning of a woman called Nofru and remains of titles typical for local governors make the identification very likely.Vivian Davies: The tomb of a Governor of Elkab of the Second Intermediate Period, in: Gianluca Miniaci, Wolfram Grajetzki (editors): The World of Middle Kingdom Egypt (2000-1550 BC), London 2016, , pp. 71-84 = References = Category:Nomarchs Category:People of the Sixteenth Dynasty of Egypt Category:Officials of the Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt ",
