    "text": "African design encompasses many forms of expression and refers to the forms of design from the continent of Africa and the African diaspora including urban design, architectural design, interior design, product design, art, and fashion design. Africa's many diverse countries are sources of vibrant design with African design influences visible in historical and contemporary art and culture around the world. The study of African design is still limited, particularly from the viewpoint of Africans, and the opportunity to expand its current definition by exploring African visual representations and introducing contemporary design applications remains immense. == Key Characteristics == Like all design forms, African design is defined by its creativity, continuously evolving, neither isolated nor static. Design is a form of story- telling and it is a medium through which those stories are told. In 2009, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie spoke on \"The Danger of a Single Story\" which has become one of the top ten most-viewed TED Talks of all time. For years African design has been stereotyped, represented by ethnic prints and earthy colors and textures. Yet with 54 countries and over 1.2 billion people estimated in Africa as of 2018 and 210 million across the African diaspora (Brazil, the Caribbean, and the United States), African design is not limited to a single aesthetic or singular history; rather it is multifaceted and influenced by the historical and present-day, local and global context in which the designer or consumer lives. African design is rooted in rich heritage, techniques, and craftsmanship. As contemporary African designers move on from externally imposed definitions of the colonial era, they acknowledge African traditional craft and craftsmanship is where they draw inspiration: preserving the past by putting a focus on their heritage and traditions while remaining open to global influences and technology. An example is the architecture of the Kenyan National Library, inspired by the Djembe drum. Across Africa, sustainable design focusing on social responsibility and the environment is important and the use of locally sourced natural materials has always been part of the African design process. As stated by Professor Mugendi K M\u2019Rithaa \u201cIt is about design for, and with, society.\u201d == History of African Design == For centuries African kingdoms generated wealth from trading natural resources with other Africans and later Arabs and Europeans. The Asante Empire\u2019s dominance over the gold trade has been documented. Similarly, rich agricultural societies of Central Africa and Southern Africa exchanged goods with the Portuguese since the 16th century. This wealth spurred local design and creativity across architecture, art, textiles, and other design forms. Examples include the 11th century Great Zimbabwe and the other 200 mortarless wall cities throughout Southern Africa as well as the Benin Bronzes created from the 13th century in the Benin Empire (present-day Nigeria). Textile weaving also flourished due to patronage by kings, chiefs, and other royals and aristocrats for ceremonial occasions such as birth, marriage, and funerals. In Nigeria, the ancient city of Kano was known for its highly developed textile industry and indigo dyeing- pits. In Central Africa, the Bamileke bought beads to decorate thrones and ceremonial clothing thereby enhancing their importance. External influences, particularly religion, also impacted design across Africa. Religion's requirements for modesty encouraged the adoption of clothing. The arrival of Islam in the 11th century in West Africa and later Christianity in the 1450s in Cape Verde which spread along the West African coast and then inland stimulated local production of stripwoven cloths as well as demand for imported fabrics. In East Africa, cotton was introduced by Arabs in Ethiopia which spurred cotton-growing and a weaving industry to turn cotton into textiles. === Textiles === Textiles by Eva Sonaike shown in her throw pillow collection; prints inspired by Yoruba embroidery and West African architectural decoration. 2009-present. Historically textiles were used as a form of money in West Africa and Central Africa. There are records of cloth being used as money since the fourteenth century. Pieces were made identical in size, efficiently carried, and exchanged in quantities based on the value of the item or trade. Across Africa, there are many distinctive local styles. Wealthy individuals and traders required different types of locally-woven and imported cloth to enhance their prestige, driving demand. The Kuba in Cameroon and Congo has one of the widest range of textile skills in Africa including weaving cloth from leaves of raphia palm as well as embroidery, appliqu\u00e9, cut- pile, and resist dyeing techniques. === Metalwork & Goldsmithing === Further information: Ghana Akan goldweights, Benin Bronzes === Art === Further information Prehistoric African Art, African Art thematic elements, history and influence, Museum of Black Civilisations === Architecture === Further information: Architecture of Africa, Moroccan Architecture === Influence on Global Design === Further information: African Art in Western Collections == Contemporary African Design == Design is playing an important role as African designers move on from externally imposed definitions of the colonial era and redefine African design on their own terms. African designers acknowledge traditional craft and craftsmanship in contemporary designs. This places a focus on their heritage and traditions while remaining open to global influences and technology, and creates contemporary designs that take into account social sustainability and environmental sustainability needs of each region. === Institutions === Below are the institutions that showcase and support the study of African design, with an increasing focus on the perspective of Africans and the African diaspora. Contemporary African art, textiles, furniture and interiors shown at The Transcend Spaces experience; designed by Beth Diana Smith and Kiyonda Powell, representing the Black Artists + Designers Guild; NY NOW 2019 show. * Dakar Biennale: Conceived as a celebration of African literature, craft, and visual arts in 1989, the Biennale has focused on contemporary African art and design since 1996.

The museum officially opened in October 2013. * Black Artists & Designers Guild (BADG): Founded in 2018 by Malene Barnett, an artist based in Brooklyn, New York, to address the lack of representation of Black talent and culture in the design industry.
