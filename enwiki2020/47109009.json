    "text": "Frontispiece of the first edition. The Revolt of the Angels () is a 1914 novel by Anatole France.Loewenberg, J. \u201cDe Angelis.\u201d The Philosophical Review, vol. 40, no. 2, 1931, pp. 124\u201315, p.129. ==Plot== Revolt retells the classic Christian story of the war in heaven between angels led by the Archangel Michael against others led by Satan. The war ends with the defeat and casting to the earth of the latter. The plot emphasises themes of protagonists fighting a ruling hierarchy, and attempting to escape it, as well as \"hiddenness, delusion, revolution, and epiphany...a literary exploration of existential choices in an apocalyptic context\".Griffin, Jared. \u201c\u2018Dancing with a Ghost\u2019: Revolution and Whiteness in F. Scott Fitzgerald's \u2018The Offshore Pirate.\u2019\u201d Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies (HJEAS), vol. 17, no. 2, 2011, pp. 323\u2013338, p.332 It is written, says Ren\u00e9 Boylesve, with a \"deft levity\".Schaffer, Aaron. \u201cRen\u00e9 Boylesve: An Unsung \u2018Immortal.\u2019\u201d The North American Review, vol. 218, no. 814, 1923, pp. 399\u2013409, p.406. Mutual antagonism between God and his angels is emphasised, which leads to disgruntlement and ultimately rebellion by the latter.Collins, J. \u201cAnatole France.\u201d The Virginia Quarterly Review, vol. 1, no. 1, 1925, pp. 94\u2013110, 107. ==Political influences== France's political leanings\u2014he was a socialist\u2014heavily influenced Revolt, leading the theme that successful revolutions must always create greater tyrannies than those they overthrew.Ross, Lloyd. \u201cA Socialist on Democracy.\u201d The Australian Quarterly, vol. 19, no. 3, 1947, pp. 69\u201382, p.70. The bitterness created by the revolt is reflected in the \"biting and harsh\" descriptions.Collins, J. \u201cAnatole France.\u201d The Virginia Quarterly Review, vol. 1, no. 1, 1925, pp. 94\u2013110, 107. Joe Loewenberg has described it as an \"imaginative narrative...the ripest expression of Anatole France's urbane genius, [being] a masterpiece of criticism at once ironic and irenic\".Loewenberg, J. \u201cDe Angelis.\u201d The Philosophical Review, vol. 40, no. 2, 1931, pp. 124\u201315, p.129. ==Literary references== Essayist David Fuchs argues that much of Ernest Hemingway's early work suggests that he was probably aware of the book, even if he had not read it.Fuchs, Daniel. \u201cErnest Hemingway, Literary Critic.\u201d American Literature, vol. 36, no. 4, 1965, pp. 431\u2013451, p.444. F. Scott Fitzgerald references Revolt of the Angels in his early story Dancing with a Ghost.Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies (HJEAS), Fall, 2011, Vol. 17, No. 2 (Fall, 2011), pp. 453-456 Fitzgerald also uses the book as a prop in his story \"The Offshore Pirate\"; the character Ardita is reading Revolt, herself looking, says Griffin, \"conically angelic...reading a book about angels \". Fitzgerald draws attention to Revolt five times in the story; he argues that France's work is the more romantic of the two.Griffin, Jared. \u201c\u2018Dancing with a Ghost\u2019: Revolution and Whiteness in F. Scott Fitzgerald's \u2018The Offshore Pirate.\u2019\u201d Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies (HJEAS), vol. 17, no. 2, 2011, pp. 323\u2013338, p.333 Revolt has been compared with the work of George Santayana in its suggestion that religion is set back by its successes.Ratner, Joseph. \u201cGeorge Santayana's Theory of Religion.\u201d The Journal of Religion, vol. 3, no. 5, 1923, pp. 458\u2013475, p.472 ==References== ",
