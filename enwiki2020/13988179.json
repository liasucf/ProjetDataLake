Route 141, along with Route 10 gained notoriety in July 2005 when it was discovered that signs had been put up at their junction in Easthampton. The road signs placed on Route 10 southbound were not done as a normal Massachusetts-style sign, but in the form of the Alabama-style sign. Unusually, these Alabama style shields were also squeezed to fit a normal Massachusetts shield design by a contractor. The signs had been posted about a week before the error had been forwarded to the Easthampton Department of Public Works by someone from the Massachusetts State Highway Department. They believed the contractor had taken out the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and chosen the Alabama shield. The signs would soon be replaced with correct Massachusetts shield. == Major intersections == ==References== == External links == 141 Category:Transportation in Hampden County, Massachusetts Category:Transportation in Hampshire County, Massachusetts ",
