    "text": "Kate & Allie is an American sitcom television series that aired on CBS from March 19, 1984 to May 22, 1989, starring Susan Saint James and Jane Curtin as two divorced women, both with children, who decide to live together in the same house. The series was created by Sherry Coben.O'Connor, John J. \"'KATE & ALLIE,' ABOUT 2 DIVORCED WOMEN, ON CBS\", The New York Times, March 19, 1984. Accessed December 1, 2007. \"Created by Sherry Coben, the series has been fortunate enough to attract some first-rate talent, in front of and behind the cameras.\" ==Overview== The show stars Susan Saint James as the free-spirited Kate McArdle and Jane Curtin as her more traditional childhood friend, Allie Lowell. The two decide to share a brownstone in New York City's Greenwich Village after their divorces, and raise their families together. The show also starred Ari Meyers as Kate's daughter Emma, and Frederick Koehler and Allison Smith as Allie's children Chip and Jennie. Both Kate and Allie dated men regularly, but were portrayed as strong, independent women, which was still a relative novelty on television at the time. Unlike other successful career women portrayed before them, Kate and Allie were shown to be wise to the games men play, but not averse to remarrying if the opportunity presented itself. Kate & Allie first aired on CBS as a midseason replacement series and only six episodes were initially commissioned, but the favorable response from critics and viewers alike (its first episode ranked #4 out of all the television shows airing that week) easily persuaded CBS to commit to a full season in the fall of 1984. The show was one of the most popular and critically acclaimed sitcoms of the 1980s, consistently ranking in the Top 20 shows until its final season. Curtin won two Emmy Awards for Best Actress in a Comedy Series, while Saint James was nominated in the same category three times. Curtin and Saint James had previously worked together in the 1980 movie How to Beat the High Cost of Living.Lague, Louise. \"Real Women Make a Tv Comeback Thanks to Susan Saint James and Jane Curtin in Kate & Allie,\" People (magazine), May 7, 1984. Retrieved November 28, 2017 At the beginning of the series, Kate worked as a travel agent, while Allie stayed home and took care of the domestic duties while also pursuing her college degree she abandoned when she married her first husband. Kate's storylines often revolved around her struggles to be taken seriously in the workplace, while Allie's often revolved around learning to be more independent and sure of herself after her years as a housewife. In the show's fifth season, Kate quit her job and teamed up with Allie to start their own catering service. In the show's second-to-last season, Allie dated Bob Barsky (Sam Freed), a television sportscaster who proposed to Allie in the season finale. Following their marriage, Allie and Bob moved into a new apartment in the show's final season. Bob, however, took a job which involved regular travel, and Kate moved into the new apartment as well. This plot development, frequently cited as one of the canonical examples of a television show jumping the shark, led viewers to lose interest,Kate and Allie from the website of the Museum of Broadcast Communications and CBS chose not to renew Kate & Allie for a seventh season. ==Episodes== ==Cast and characters== ===Main cast=== * Susan Saint James as Katherine \"Kate\" Elizabeth Ann (n\u00e9e Hanlan) McArdle. * Jane Curtin as Allison \"Allie\" Julia Charlotte (n\u00e9e Adams) Lowell. * Ari Meyers as Emma McArdle, Kate's daughter.

Roxie starred Andrea Martin as New York City TV programmer Roxie Brinkerhoff, who balanced her professional life at local UHF station WNYV with her married life. Martin had previously appeared as a similar version of the character, named Eddie Gordon, on two episodes of Kate & Allie (\"Stage Mother\", which aired December 1, 1986, and in \"The Goodbye Girl\", December 8, 1986), in which she was a friend of Allie's who worked as a producer on low-viewership public- access Channel G.Harris, Will. \"Andrea Martin on Working The Engels, SCTV, and almost being Liz Lemon\u2019s mom,\" The A.V.

Retrieved November 28, 2017 ==Production== 200pxThe test name for the script was entitled Two Mommies and was seized upon by Saint James who was able to use the show as a way to work without relocating her family from Litchfield, Connecticut. Curtin was initially not interested in doing the sitcom, but after speaking with director Bill Persky she decided to take the role. Kate & Allie was taped on soundstages constructed at the Ed Sullivan Theater (CBS Studio 50) and also at the Teletape Studios at West 81st Street and Broadway in New York City, which at the time was the production facility for Sesame Street.People.com Cold opening dialog sequences between Saint James and Curtin documenting city life were featured, shot on location in Manhattan with no laugh track. The theme song played instrumentally over the title shot of the Empire State Building (the first season's titles opened in a different outdoor location per episode). Closing credits also included vocals with indicative lyrics, \"just when you think/you're all by yourself/you're not.\" Under pressure from higher-ups at CBS to quash the suggestion that Kate and Allie were lesbians, the producers were instructed to show Kate and Allie entering separate bedrooms to sleep at the end of each episode. That pressure may have been the impetus for an episode showing Kate and Allie pretending to be lesbians when they were faced with a large increase in rent. Saint James was pregnant during the taping of the fourth season. Her pregnancy was hidden by taping her behind a desk, under a sheet in a hospital bed, or in a bubble bath. The exception was a 1960s flashback which showed both Kate and Allie pregnant. An episode broadcast in 1987, produced in cooperation with the Coalition for the Homeless, was taped almost entirely outdoors, on the streets of Manhattan. The episode was prompted by the likely absence of Saint James, who had been hospitalized due to kidney stones, and featured Allie struggling to find a way home after accidentally leaving her keys and money in a taxi.A TV Sitcom Takes to the Streets, a September 12, 1987 article from The New York Times The show's final season was affected by the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike. The lack of inclusion on CBS' 1989-90 fall schedule announced on May 19, 1989, officially ended the series' run.Carter, Bill. \"CBS to Add Nine Series in the Fall,\" The New York Times, Saturday, May 20, 1989.

Catron from the Museum of Broadcast Communications's Encyclopedia of Television, the decline in ratings for the show's last season is attributable to the fact that the show's premise had been fulfilled at the end of the previous season, when Allie accepted Bob Barsky's marriage proposal. ==Syndication== The American syndication rights are held by NBCUniversal Television Distribution; the show aired on RTN.
