    "text": "Bug Riders is a video game developed by n-Space and published by GT Interactive for the PlayStation in 1997, followed by a port to Windows in 1998 and a re-release on PlayStation Network in 2011. ==Gameplay== Bug Riders is a game which involves a bug-riding race to determine who will replace the dying emperor of the planet Entymion. To accelerate, the player strikes their bug with a crop. Careful rhythm is demanded, as using the crop too frequently will cause the bug to cry out in pain and slow down. ==Reception== Bug Riders received generally negative reviews, primarily because of the system for controlling the bugs. In particular, critics overwhelmingly detested the cropping system used to accelerate, finding it overly difficult to master. Shawn Smith argued in Electronic Gaming Monthly, \"Let's just stick with a standard 'press the button and hold it' acceleration that practically EVERY other racing game has. It's what we're used to as gamers. When something like this comes along, we don't know what to do.\" Most critics also found that the bugs having minds of their own, allowing them to fly without input from the player and sometimes resist the player's inputs, proved to be frustrating. The level designs had a more mixed response, with some praising their for their visual design and variety, while others found they did not make it obvious where the player needed to go. While there was also scattered praise for elements such as the music, critics felt the control issues overrode all the game's positive elements. GamePro, for example, opined that \"While there are some cool weapons to pick up as well as a good variety of bug steeds, because of bad control, praising these aspects is like toweling off the Titanic.\" Next Generation commented, \"The premise has some promise, offering all sorts of new gameplay ideas like riding living creatures and flying through the air. However, these same ideas, at least the execution of them, are what bring the game down.\" ==Reviews== *Official PlayStation Magazine #3 (1997 December) *Game.EXE - Jan, 1998 *PC Games - Mar, 1998 ==References== Category:1997 video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Racing video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games ",
