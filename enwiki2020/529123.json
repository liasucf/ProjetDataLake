The largest city in \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai is Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a. Prior to Vietnamese colonization, the area was dominated by the Funan, Chenla, Khmer empire and subsequent influences until 1627. ==Geography== \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai is in southeastern Vietnam and bordered by: B\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn, L\u00e2m \u0110\u1ed3ng, B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng and B\u00ecnh Ph\u01b0\u1edbc, B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, and Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon). \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai has an advanced traffic system with many backbone national roads crossing it, such as: National Route 1A, National Route 20, National Route 51 and the North\u2013South railway lines; located adjacent to the Saigon Port and Tan Son Nhat International Airport, it offers many advantages to economic activities in the area. Its location is very important for the development of the Southern economic main hub and a junction of the South Eastern and T\u00e2y Nguy\u00ean Highland. \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai is based essentially on the system of lakes, dams and rivers, of which Tr\u1ecb An Lake with an area of 323 km\u00b2 and over 60 rivers, rivulets and canals are very favorable for the development of a number of aquatic products: raft bred fish and shrimp. The seasonal tropical forests are protected in C\u00e1t Ti\u00ean National Park, located in the north of \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai and the adjacent V\u0129nh C\u1eedu Nature Reserve; the former has been recognized internationally as a significant biosphere reserve. From the mountainous area, \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai River, Vietnam's largest internal waterway, flows southeast through Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a City, Ho Chi Minh City, and villages along its way. This river plays an important role in supplying fresh water for the whole area. ===Climate=== \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai lies in the monsoon tropical zone and is affected by the north-east and south-west monsoon. It is also under the influence of the Pacific Ocean tropical atmosphere between April and October. The climate is divided into two distinct seasons: the rainy season lasts from March or April to November and the dry season from December to March or April of the following year. The average temperature is between 23.9 and 29.0 \u00b0C, much lower than the standard level of tropical regions (26-30 \u00b0C). Its annual rainfall is quite high with 1,500 - 2,700 mm. On average, the weather is sunny for 4.0-9.5 hours a day and does not exceed 11.5 hours per day, even on the hottest and sunniest days. Total rainy days within a year are between 120 and 170 days (the standard level of tropical regions is 150\u2013160 days) with a total rainfall of some 1,500 - 2,750 mm. The average humidity is around 80 - 82% and humidity in the dry season is 10-12%, lower than that of the rainy season; humidity varies considerably between areas. \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai's weather with regular sunshine, rain, and high humidity, equally found in the localities, facilitates agricultural production and development of industrial, cultural and tourist activities. ===Resources=== \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai is plentiful with resources such as forests, granite mines, construction stone, clay, kaolin, pozzolan, sand and gravel. ==Demographics== \u0110\u1ed3ng Nai is one of Vietnam's most populous provinces (ranked fifth) with a population of 2,838,600 in 2014.
