He was followed by another brother, Djedkhonsuefankh, after whose death, in the 25th year of Smendes I, Menkheperre became High Priest.K.A. Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt [TIPE] (1100\u2013650 BC) 3rd ed., Warminster: Aris & Phillips Ltd, \u015e384 With his elder half-brother ruling at Tanis as Pharaoh Psusennes I, Menkheperre's power, like that of Masaharta, must have been somewhat curtailed. Menkheperre took as his throne name the title of \"First prophet of Amun\", just as his great-grandfather Herihor had, perhaps an indication of this diminished role, though he kept the cartouche unlike his successors in the temple. Menkheperre married his niece Isetemkheb, daughter of his brother Psusennes I and wife Wiay. Their children were:Dodson & Hilton, op.cit., pp.200-201 * Smendes II, also called Nesbanebdjed II, who followed him as High Priest. * Henuttawy C, wife of Smendes II, Chantress of Amun.
