The coup took place on 17 January 1977 and included a failed invasion of the port city of Cotonou by mercenaries contracted by a group of exiled Beninese political rivals. Bob Denard was the leader of the mercenary group and although Jacques Foccart denied knowledge of the attempted coup after its failure, he did recognize that it had been backed-up by Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma (Togo), F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt- Boigny (Ivory Coast), Omar Bongo (Gabon) and Hassan II (Morocco), all allies of France.Bob Denard, chien de guerre , L'Humanit\u00e9, 4 May 1999 The coup would be one of several against K\u00e9r\u00e9kou who survived numerous attempts to oust him, including two coup attempts in 1988. == Weblinks == * War is boring: In 1977, 80 Mercenaries Nearly Took Over Benin ==References== Coup attempt Category:Military coups in Benin Benin coup d'\u00e9tat attempt Coup attempt Category:January 1977 events in Africa Category:1970s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts ",
