The NHS of the United Kingdom has warned that those undergoing active chemotherapy or radiotherapy for lung cancer and those with bone marrow cancers are vulnerable to serious illness if they become infected with COVID-19. A study from China shows that if the antitumor treatment was taken within the last 14 days, it significantly increases the risk of developing severe illness due to COVID-19. Another study from China showed that hospitalized persons with hematological cancers have similar chances of getting COVID-19 as was for healthcare workers; But they have a more severe illness and a higher case fatality rate. ==Recommendations== The European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommends that oncologists should remain ready to adjust their clinical routines in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommendations for using telemedicine services, reducing clinic visits, switching intravenous therapies to subcutaneous or oral therapies, when possible. ESMO also recommends advising patients on infection control. The NHS in England stresses that individual patient decisions have to be made by multidisciplinary teams. NHS has also established priority groups for those receiving anticancer treatments such that those with higher chances of success get prioritized for treatment over others. The European Society of Surgical Oncology advises against seeing patients with cancer who are over 70 years of age in clinic, unless it is urgent. == References == Category:Cancer Cancer ",
