At Imperial College London he gained a BSc in Physics, then obtained a PhD in Physics from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He then became Head of the Electrical Engineering Department at the University of East Anglia. ==Parliamentary career== Turner contested North West Norfolk in 1992, but failed to be elected. He was returned as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency in 1997, but lost his seat back to Henry Bellingham of the Conservatives \u2013 whom he had first defeated \u2013 in 2001. In the House of Lords on 25 April 2012 it was asserted by Turner (Col 1786), \"Lord Lexden: My Lords, would my noble friend think of reminding Mr Henry Bellingham that he has already experienced the Perceval family's taste for revenge, having been deprived of his Commons seat at the 1997 election by a direct descendant of the assassinated Prime Minister?\". ==Personal life== He married Lesley Duggan. They have two daughters, a stepson and a stepdaughter. ==References== * ==External links== * They Work For You * Ask Aristotle * Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:UK MPs 1997\u20132001 Category:People from Oundle Category:Alumni of Imperial College London Category:Alumni of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge Category:Academics of the University of East Anglia Category:English physicists ",
