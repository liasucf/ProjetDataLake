They have made, from a very local identity, a universal rap that has become popular around the whole country and has achieved rankings not normally held by hip-hop. They won Best Disc of the Year in Rolling Stone Magazine for their first work \u201c\u201dCata Cheli\u201d\u201d and Best New Group from PEMOC (Group of Musical Journalists)please cite the source information. They have known each other since childhood, and began testing the waters with the rest of their friends in \u201c\u201dAmenaza Criminal\u201d\u201d, in a totally amateur way. With time, only the actual members of the group continued in the world of hip-hop, completing the formation of La Excepci\u00f3n. They discovered they could make rap using their own gypsy slang and they continued to polish their style in small concerts. In one of these they met the ubiquitous MC and producer Frank T, who decided to speed their journey, making first their single \u201cEn tu carro paio!\u201d (2002) and then their first record, \u201c\u201dCata Cheli\u201d\u201d, as well as interpreting with them the song \"El negro, el cojo y el gitano\". In addition to the basis provided by Frank T, they relied upon the Frenchman, Super Jeff Dominguez to mix their first CD. Their success among critics and sales has led them to act in the main festivals of the country, like Vi\u00f1a Rock, the Monegros Desert Festival or the Urban Culture de Madrid. All this brought about the re-release of the disc with a DVD and two new tracks. La Excepci\u00f3n follows a responsibly policy towards alcohol (don't try it) and drug use (a \u201c\u201dtaste\u201d\u201d every once in a while). Their lyrics distil a commitment to \u201c\u201dEl Barrio\u201d\u201d (the hood), happiness, and a positive attitude towards life and its hardships. Much of their music has tones of \"el Langui\", that in \"Zapato ortop\u00e9dico\" (\"Orthopedic Shoe\"), jeers at the misfortunes that had been supposed to be his fate (to have paralysed arms and legs due to a lack of oxygen), and the Gypsy Anton, that in \"Nos late fuerte\" (\"It Barks At Us Loudly\"), and with the help of Antonio Carmona de Ketama also comments on the bad reputation of the Gypsies. In May 2006, their second disc was released, produced by Frank T and \u00d3scar \"Acci\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez\", called \u201c\u201dAguantando el Tiron\u201d\u201d (\"Withstanding The Pull\"), with collaborations like that of MC Randy. Recently they won a prize Best Spanish Group at the MTV Europe Music Awards. === Discography === *\"En tu carrino paio\" (Zona Bruta, 2002) *\"Cata cheli\" (Zona bruta, 2003) *\"Aguantando el tir\u00f3n\" (DRO/Zona bruta, 2006) *\" La verdad mas verdadera\" (2009) *\"Cata Cheli\" (2020) === Collaborations=== *\u201cTenemos que hablar\u201d, with Presuntos Implicados *\u201cEl negro el cojo y el gitano\u201d with Frank T *\u201cGorri\u00f3n Bernardino\u201d with Kultama *\u201cNos late fuerte\u201d with Antonio Carmona *\u201cAlma de molino\u201d with Las Sister Bautista *\u201cTres chaborros y un destino\u201d with Rachid Kamikaze Baggasse *\u201cHoy\u201d with Aqeel *\u201cAgustito\u201d with Ketama *\"Quijote Hip Hop\" (with Zenit, Koraz\u00f3n Crudo y Artes, musical direction by Frank T) *\u201cPirata del Estrecho\u201d, with Los Delinq\u00fcentes *\u201cHorizontes\u201d, with Rosendo (singer) *\u201cRuido\u201d, with Muchachito Bombo Infierno *\u201cRap Contra El Racismo\u201d, El Chojin and others references = https://web.archive.org/web/20130526103437/http://www.mtv.co.uk/artists/la- excepcion http://www.erreape.com/el-langui-y-el-truco-del-manco-triunfan-en- los-goya/comment-page-1/ http://www.sgae.es/recursos/pdf/comunicacion/finalistas_XI_PM.pdf http://blogs.20minutos.es/entradagratuita/2012/11/07/la-excepcion-contra- warner/ == External links == * La Excepci\u00f3n official site Category:Spanish hip hop groups Category:MTV EMA winners ",
