The type and only species is Itapeuasaurus cajapioensis. Lindoso, R.M., Medeiros, M.A.A., Carvalho, I.S., Pereira, A.A., Mendes, I.D., Iori, F.V., Sousa, E.P., Arcanjo, S.H.S., & Silva, T.C.M.

Cretaceous Research (in press). doi:10.1016/j.cretres.2019.104191 It would have been around to when fully grown. ==Discovery and naming== In November 2014, fisherman Carlos Wagner Silva discovered a fossilised humerus on the beach at Itapeua. In May 2015, paleontologist Manuel Alfredo Medeiros and his students were sent in and they secured several bones, including limb bones and vertebrae. In 2019, the species was described. ==Phylogeny== Lindoso et al., (2019) placed Itapeuasaurus in the Nigersaurinae as related to Demandasaurus and Nigersaurus. The 2015 cladogram of Fanti et al. is shown below only differing in the fact that it incorporated Itapeuasaurus, not sampled in the analysis of Fanti et al. ==See also== *A YouTube video reporting the discovery of Itapeuasaurus == References == Category:Titanosaurs Category:Cenomanian life Category:Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of South America Category:Cretaceous Brazil Category:Fossil taxa described in 2019 ",
