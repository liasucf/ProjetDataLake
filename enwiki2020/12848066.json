The Society of Medalists was the longest running art medal collector's organization in the United States and released 129 regular issues on a twice yearly basis from 1930 to 1995, as well as special issues marking the Society's 20th, 40th, and 50th anniversaries and the United States Bicentennial in 1976. Much of the inspiration for the Society came from the earlier Circle of Friends of the Medallion, which also issued medals on a semi-annual basis from 1908 to 1915. All issues of the Society were struck by the Medallic Art Company, originally located in New York City Society of Medalists Issue 2, Dionysus and Satyrs Treading Grapes, by Paul Manship. 1930 bronze. Society of Medalists Issue 4, Charles A. Lindbergh Lone Eagle Allegory, by Frederick MacMonnies. 1931 bronze with gold patina. Society of Medalists Issue 5, Whatsoever a Man Soweth That Shall He Also Reap, by Lee Lawrie. 1932 bronze Society of Medalists Issue 29, Inspiration Aspiration, by Richard Recchia. 1944 silver Society of Medalists Issue 31, Flag Raising on Iwo Jima and For Conquer We Must Society of Medalists Issue 37, John the Baptist and Salome Society of Medalists Issue 47, Fish and Dry Fish Lure Society of Medalists Issue 59, Apache Fire Dancer and Buffalo Hunt Society of Medalists Issue 80, Space Control Room and Astronaut on Moon Society of Medalists Issue 101, Unicorn and Medieval Procession, by Marcel Jovine. 1980 bronze. Society of Medalists Issue 111, Man bursting the Bounds and Back of Man, by Donald De Lue. 1985 bronze. Society of Medalists Issue 120, Man is Strength Woman is Love and Beauty, by Keiichi Uryu. 1989 bronze. Society of Medalists Issue 125, Tyrannosaurus Rex and Tyrannosaurus Rex fossil, by Don Everhart III. 1993 bronze. Many of the early contributors to the Society of Medalists were prominent American sculptors of the first half of the 20th century. Lee Lawrie was well known for modernistic art-deco works like the Statue of Atlas in New York City and the Sower atop the Nebraska State Capitol, while artists like Lorado Taft represented a more classical ethos. Others concentrated more, although not exclusively, on medallic art, such as John Flanagan (designer of the Washington quarter dollar) and Laura Gardin Fraser. The artists who created the series represented a wide variety of styles and expertise. The Society of Medalists issues covered a wide variety of themes during its sixty-five years of existence. Because the artists were allowed to select their subject matter, many of the medals are topical. Those of the 1930s frequently serve as commentary on the experiences of the first World War, and anticipate the destruction of the second. Religion often serves as a theme, with interpretations of biblical scenes prevalent throughout all decades. Art, science, and nature also provided inspiration for artists and their medals'. With two exceptions, all issues of the Society of Medalists were initially manufactured in bronze. Issues 28 and 29, created during World War II, were first produced in silver. During the 1970s the Society undertook a program to restrike its earlier issues in silver. The advent of a spike in silver prices late in the decade, coupled with a low level of demand for the new issues, led to the demise of the silver restrike program by the early 1980s. The Society of Medalist represents an interesting and accessible collecting opportunity. All of the issues are available on the secondary market, with both specialized dealers and internet auction services serving as important sources. Collectors value the medals in their original boxes, complete with the descriptive pamphlets that accompanied them. In 2010 the American Numismatic Society published the authoritative reference and history of both the Circle of Friends of the Medallion and the Society of Medalists, American Art Medals, 1909-1995 by well known numismatic scholar David Thomason Alexander. In 2018, the Medallic Art Company declared bankruptcy and its assets were liquidated. The American Numismatic Society acquired Medallic Art's archive of historic medals, including records, dies, and examples of the Society of Medalists. {| | |Issue |Year |Sculptor |Obverse |Reverse |---- |REGULAR |1 |1930 |Laura Gardin Fraser |Hunter and dog |Ruffled grouse |---- |ISSUES |2 |1930 |Paul Manship |Dionysus |Satyrs treading grapes |---- | |3 |1931 |Hermon A.
