    "text": "Honey syrup is a syrup made by combining honey and water and heating until the sugar dissolves. In the case of honey simple syrup, a 1:1 ratio is used. This is similar to the process for making simple syrup with sugar, and the honey syrup can be used in place of simple syrup in many cocktails, such as the Bee's Knees. It can also be used in mojitos, iced tea, lemonade, and other cold drinks. Different types of honey can have different flavor profiles depending, e.g., on whether the bees consumed raspberry, blackberry, buckwheat, or clover flowers; raspberry- or blackberry-flavored honeys can be used when a mellow flavor is preferred. The reason for making syrup with the honey is that otherwise it might be too thick to mix well with other ingredients, especially in an ice-filled cocktail shaker (as opposed to, say, a hot tea). An advantage of honey over sugar, for making cocktails, is that it can impart floral notes and also pair well with spirits, citrus, and other cocktail ingredients. The Gold Rush is an example of a cocktail that uses honey syrup. Other ingredients can be added to honey syrup as well, such as lemon juice and lemon zest, e.g. for honey syrup that is to be poured over gingerbread. For mojitos, mint leaves may be added; for a rosemary gimlet, rosemary sprigs; for lavender lemonade, culinary lavender; etc. ==See also== * List of syrups ==References== Category:Honey Category:Syrup ",
