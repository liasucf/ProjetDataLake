He is the son of Mar\u00eda Beltr\u00e1n Bobadilla and Jos\u00e9 Sep\u00falveda Padilla. === Artistic career === He made his debut in 1988 at the Vi\u00f1a del Mar International Song Festival, where he performed the song \"El Caballito de Metal\", based on the Chilean railway industry and the peasant world. The song, which was a guaracha, was disqualified, because at that time the competition regulations required that the songs sung be typical of Chilean folklore, a requirement that the guaracha did not fulfill. However, the song he played became iconic and allowed him to continue in the field of folk music, of which he is still a part today. Between 2012 and 2015, he was a television host on the program Revoliendo el Gallinero, on the UCV TV channel, which consisted of interviewing other singers around the country. In addition, he caused controversy by writing a song dedicated to Luc\u00eda Hiriart, Augusto Pinochet's wife, on his album \"Homenaje a un Gran General: Cuecas\". In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he has begun to record and broadcast his works digitally. He was also invited to the TV marathon Vamos Chilenos. == Discography == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Title !Type !Reference |- |1988 |A Bailar Guaracha |Album | |- |1997 |Morena Caribe\u00f1a |Album | |- |1998 |Homenaje a un Gran General: Cuecas |Album | |- |1998 |Las Cuecas Acaball\u00e1s |Album | |- |2002 |Hass presenta: M\u00fasica 100% Chilena |Album | |- |2003 |A Ponerle Pino...
