Beawar was part of India and the administrative headquarters of Merwara district. Since the ancient days, the region where Beawar lies is known as Magra-Merwaran, and it was named after a local village called \"Beawar Khas\" by the Rajasthani. This region was ruled by fierce tribes such as the Chauhan Rajput (descendants of Prithviraj Chauhan). The British tried to subdue them but were unsuccessful because the people were scattered across many small villages. Moreover, the Chauhan ruled through Shyamgarh Fort and were excellent in conducting war. The Battle of Shyamgarh was fought between the Chauhan Rajputs and the British. The British won and Chauhans abandoned the fort of Shyamgarh, but employed guerrilla tactics causing great loss to the British. Consequently, the British founded a military cantonment with fortified walls for protection and engaged in further military missions. Another factor in building the cantonment here was Beawar's location at the strategic tri-junction of the royal states of Jaipur, Jodhpur, and Udaipur and near to the royal state of Ajmer. Beawar the name of the city comes from the name \"Be Aware\" which was originally a sign given to the city by a British Emperor. Chauhan Rajput, the great warriors known for their courage, were a major problem to the British Empire, so they decided to form a cantonment and hence Beawar as Nayashahar came into existence. Beawar is the birthplace of classical mathematician Duncan Sommerville. ==Beawar city== Desert Circle Beawar ===Inner city=== The inner city of Beawar is the old historical city, also known as the \"Walled City\" (Parkota).
