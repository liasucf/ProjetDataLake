    "text": "Homogeneous Serbia is a written discourse by Stevan Moljevi\u0107. In this work, contrary to the presumptions of Ilija Gara\u0161anin who believed that the strength of the state is derived from its size and organizational principles, Moljevi\u0107 emphasized that the state drew its strength from the degree to which its population identifies itself within the state.: \"Moljevic argued, contrary to GaraSanin's presumptions, that the strength of a state came not from its principles of organization and size, but from the degree to which the population identifies with the state and is committed to it. \" Moljevi\u0107 believed that the victorious Kingdom of Serbia in 1918 made a grave mistake when it decided to establish Yugoslavia instead of clearly defining the borders of Serbia.: \"According to the Chetnik ideologue Stefan Moljevic, the fundamental mistake was made in 1918 when the borders of Serbia had not been clearly defined.\" Right after the collapse of Yugoslavia during the short April war, Moljevi\u0107 created the concept of \"homogeneous\" Serbia and trialist Yugoslavia.: \"Dr. Stevan Moljevic, immediately after the April collapse of Yugoslavia in 1941, created the projects of a \"homogeneous\" Serbia and trialist Yugoslavia. The map presented in this work awards territory of northern Dalmatia with substantial Serb population to Croatia. Moljevi\u0107 wrote another treatise titled An Opinion About Our State and Its Borders (), which he presented to Dragi\u0161a Vasi\u0107 along with Homogeneous Serbia. John R. Lampe pointed to significant details such as that the Central National Committee had secondary status while Moljevi\u0107 did not rise to prominence in this committee until 1943, undercutting the perception about Moljevi\u0107's Homogeneous Serbia being the centerpiece of a coherent set of Chetnik war objectives. There is no proof that massacres of Muslims committed by Chetniks were a direct consequence of Moljevic's tract, bearing in mind the fragmented and very weak command structure of Mihailovi\u0107 which militated against any systematic annihilation programme. == References == == Sources == * * * * * * Category:1941 documents Category:1941 in Yugoslavia Category:Serbian nationalism ",
