Giovanni Lami, who strongly opposed that Saint Luke the Evangelist was a painter, thought that the icon of Madonna di San Luca was executed by a certain Luca Santo, a Florentin painter of the 14th century.Zani 1817-28, vol.XII (1822), annotation 36, p.169-70Boskovits 1994, p.203 He alleged that Luca Santo was the son of a nominated Cancelliere and considered improbable the claim that this icon was brought from Constantinople.Lami's view is mentioned by professor Cole at Cole 1996, p.127 Although a direct genealogical connection is not possible due to lack of sources prior to the 15th century in Greece, it is recorded that following the conquest of Constantinople by the Ottomans (1453) the Cangelari family name (in Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2, \u039a\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 or \u039a\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2) is traced in the island of Corfu, where from its members migrated to Cephalonia (early 16th century), Santa Maura (late 17th century) (Ionian Islands) and other parts of mainland Greece and the diaspora.Cangelaris 2011, p.51, ftn.2 ==References== ==Sources== * Pietro Zani, Enciclopedia Metodica Critico-Ragionata delle Arte, Parma 1817-28 (in Italian) * Eleftheroudakis Encyclopedia, Athens 1929 (in Greek) * Helios Newest Encyclopedia, Athens 1977 (in Greek) * Haris Patsis New Grand Hellenic Encyclopedia, Athens 1980 (in Greek) * Mikl\u00f3s Boskovits, A Corpus of Florentine Painting - The Origins of Florentine Painting 1100-1270, Florence 1994 * Bruce Cole, Studies in the history of Italian art 1250-1550, New York 1996 * P.D.Cangelaris \"History and Genealogy of the Cangelari Family of Cephalonia (16th-20th Centuries)\", Corfu 2011 (in Greek) ==External links== * The Cangelari Family - History and Genealogy Category:Christian hagiographers Category:Cangelari family ",
