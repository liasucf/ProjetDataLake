    "text": "\"The Riddle\" is a song by the English singer-songwriter Nik Kershaw. It was released in 1984 as the lead single from the album of the same name. Kershaw described the lyrical content as being nondescript to fill as a \"guide vocal\" for the production. It reached number three on the UK Singles Chart and peaked within the top 10 in countries like Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand. An accompanying music video was made for the song and features references to Lewis Carroll's book Alice in Wonderland. The song was covered by many artists, including by Gigi D'Agostino (1999) and Jack Holiday and Mike Candys (2012). ==Lyrics== The \"riddling\" lyrics caused speculation among listeners as to their meaning; Kershaw states that there is in fact no intended meaning at all, the words simply being a \"guide vocal\" thrown together to fit the music. Kershaw has stated: \"In short, 'The Riddle' is nonsense, rubbish, bollocks, the confused ramblings of an 80s popstar.\" ==Music video== The music video to \"The Riddle\" depicts Kershaw walking through a house shaped like a question mark, making his way through certain obstacles and looking through drawers while singing. The video depicts many references to Lewis Carroll's book Alice in Wonderland with an appearance of a young girl exiting the room through a small door, two portly gentlemen who resemble Tweedledum and Tweedledee and an observation made by Kershaw to Through the Looking Glass. At the beginning of the music video Kershaw is seen trying to get through a door with a screwdriver. The video ends with the camera moving up away from Kershaw to reveal that the question mark is lying in an alleyway, at which point a man in a green costume seen earlier in the video comes and picks it up. The green man is the Riddler, a villain from the Batman comics. ==Track listing== 7\" Single (WEA NIK 6) A \"The Riddle\" - 3:52 B \"Progress\" (Live) - 3:02 12\" Single (WEA NIKT 6) A \"The Riddle\" (Extended Riddle) - 5:08 B \"Progress\" (Live) - 3:02 Cassette Single (WEA NIKC 6) A1 \"The Riddle\" - 3:52 A2 \"Interview\" A3 \"Progress\" (Live) - 3:02 B1 \"I Won't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" (Extended Mix) B2 \"Wouldn't It Be Good\" (Extended Mix) ==Credits== \"The Riddle\" Produced by Peter Collins \"Progress\" Recorded Live at Hammersmith Odeon.

The same lyrics are used as in Kershaw's song, but the order is changed and the tempo is faster. ===Music video=== The music video, which was made by Andreas Hykade, features La Linea styled animation like the \"Bla Bla Bla\" music video (both of which feature the same humanoid character), taking place entirely with white lines on a light green background and features the aforementioned character fighting a dragon on a mountainous terrain.
