    "text": "Chief Shaumonekusse (Chonmonicase, Letan, L'Letan, \"Prairie Wolf\") (ca. 1785-1837) was a leader of the Otoe Native American tribe in the early 19th century. The Otoe was a Great Plains tribe, closely related to the Ioway and Missouria. Shaumonekusse was described as a witty and sociable person, and \"a daring, active, and successful warrior. We are not aware of his having any hereditary claims to the chieftainship of his tribe, to which he has risen gradually by his own merits. He is a person of deep penetration, and is capable of acting with much duplicity on any occasion when he may consider it politic to conceal his real views.\" \"He recounted his deeds in 1819 during a dance performed before members of the Stephen Long Expedition to the Rocky Mountains. Later in life he killed his brother after a fight in which the latter bit off the end of his nose.\" Shaumonekusse traveled with an Indian delegation to Washington, DC in 1821 to meet with high-ranking officials, including President James Monroe. He had five wives, and took Eagle of Delight with him to the capital. They both had their portraits painted in Washington, DC on that trip by Charles Bird King. ==References== ==External links== * \"Shaumonekusse\", Indian Tribes of North America, Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution, 1910 Category:Native American leaders Category:19th-century Native Americans Category:1780s births Category:1837 deaths Category:Presidency of James Monroe Category:Otoe people ",
