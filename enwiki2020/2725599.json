Williams began his career in rugby league, and played as a forward over seven seasons in two spells in the National Rugby League (NRL), with the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and Sydney Roosters. He has won 12 caps for New Zealand (the Kiwis) and won the RLIF Awards for Rookie of the Year in 2004 and International Player of the Year in 2013. He first moved to rugby union in 2010 and had spells playing for Toulon in France, Canterbury, Counties Manukau, the Crusaders, Chiefs and Blues in New Zealand and Panasonic Wild Knights in Japan. He won 58 caps for New Zealand (the All Blacks), and was part of the teams that won the 2011 and 2015 World Cups. He has also played rugby sevens for New Zealand, competing in the 2015\u201316 World Rugby Sevens Series and the 2016 Olympics. Williams has boxed professionally seven times, winning all of his heavyweight bouts. He was the New Zealand Professional Boxing Association (NZPBA) Heavyweight Champion and World Boxing Association (WBA) International Heavyweight Champion, but was stripped of these titles after failing to respond to challenges. ==Early life== Williams was born on 3 August 1985, in Auckland, New Zealand, the son of a Samoan father, Ioane (\"John\") Williams and mother, Lee Williams who is half-New Zealander and half-Australian. He has an older brother, John Arthur, and younger twin sisters, Niall and Denise.Early hints of Sonny Bill's charisma, by Steve Deane, nzherald.co.nz, dated 16 March 2013.

In describing his struggling family background, Williams later said that the \"driving factor\" in his pursuit of playing professional rugby league was to \"get my mum a house.\"Sonny Bill Williams: 'All those troubles made me the man I am today', by Donald McRae, The Guardian, dated 29 October 2013. He attended Owairaka School, Wesley Intermediate and Mount Albert Grammar School.

Though his father was an accomplished rugby league player, Williams has said it was his mother who introduced him to the game. ==Rugby league== Williams was a Marist Saints junior when he was spotted playing in Auckland by Bulldogs talent scout John Ackland. In 2002 he was offered a contract and moved to Sydney (as the youngest player to ever sign with an NRL club) to play in the Bulldogs' junior grades.Sonny Bill Williams: Islam brings me happiness, by Gary Morley and Neil Curry, CNN, dated 27 November 2013.

He advanced up the ranks quickly: becoming a starting player in the forward pack for the Bulldogs' Jersey Flegg Cup side in his first year. The following year Williams cemented a starting spot in the Premier League side. He also represented NSW as a junior; however, in 2013, when the NSW team investigated whether he could represent them in State of Origin, it was found that he only met two of the five necessary qualifications. ===2004\u201308: Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs=== In 2004, when eighteen years old, Williams made his NRL debut for Canterbury-Bankstown against the Parramatta Eels at Telstra Stadium. In 2004 he was selected by New Zealand after only a handful of NRL games and on 23 April made his debut for the Kiwis as their youngest-ever Test player in the 2004 ANZAC Test against Australia. He had previously played for the Junior Kiwis. Williams played fifteen NRL matches during the season, establishing himself in the Canterbury squad. He experienced premiership success in his debut season and became the youngest person to play for Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in a grand final when playing off the bench in the Bulldogs' 16\u201313 victory over the Sydney Roosters in the 2004 NRL Grand Final. Williams capped a successful debut season by receiving the 2004 RLIF Awards' International Newcomer of the Year Award and being named in Rugby League World magazine's 2004 World XIII. As 2004 NRL premiers, Canterbury-Bankstown faced Super League IX champions, the Leeds Rhinos, in the 2005 World Club Challenge, which Canterbury lost 32\u201339. Williams's contract was due to expire in 2005, and he received several offers to lure him away from the Bulldogs. The largest offer was rumoured to be about $3 million from UK Super League club St Helens. Williams decided to stay with Canterbury-Bankstown and signed on for a further two years. St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus later said the club had not made an offer to him. Williams had a shortened 2005 season after sustaining a severe knee injury and several minor injuries. He played five games throughout the year and subsequently missed several internationals for New Zealand. Williams expressed his frustration, stating \"You've got to be pretty strong mentally when you have injuries, and I've had a few.\" Williams later adamant dismissed claims he was injury prone. Williams stayed relatively injury-free throughout the 2006 season, playing in 21 matches and scoring eight tries. The Bulldogs were beaten in the preliminary final by eventual premiers the Brisbane Broncos. However, off-season surgery forced Williams to miss the Tri- Nations for New Zealand for the second consecutive year. In the first game of the 2007 season, Williams was sent off and subsequently suspended for two weeks for a high tackle on Andrew Johns. He thus became the first player of the 21st century to be sent off in a first-round game. Speculation surrounding Williams's playing future ended when he re-signed with Canterbury on 9 March 2007 for a five-year contract worth over $2.5 million, extending through to the 2012 season. Williams was selected to play for the Kiwis as a second-row forward in the 2007 Anzac Test loss against Australia. He went on to play in 21 matches for the Bulldogs; scored fourteen tries and topped the competition, for the second successive year, for most offloads.Roosters v Rabbitohs preview, by Ben Blaschke, NRL.com, dated 5 March 2013.
