Her name was changed to Kapi\u02bbolani Campbell after her adoption. Only a few months after her adoption Kapi\u02bbolani would lose both her father and grandmother. After her grandmother's death, her widower Samuel Parker petitioned to be granted Kapi\u02bbolani's guardianship, but her mother was declared as her guardian instead. Her siblings were David Kal\u0101kaua Kaw\u0101nanakoa and Lydia Lili\u02bbuokalani Kaw\u0101nanakoa. Kapi\u02bbolani married twice: first to Andrew Anderson Lambert (Honolulu, Oahu, March 25, 1900 \u2013 Kailua, Honolulu County, Oahu, March 15, 1966) in 1922, whom she divorced, and later to Harry Montague Norman Gooding Field (died Honolulu, Oahu, May 23, 1964), educated at Punahou School, Honolulu, Oahu, and Oregon State University at Corvallis, Oregon, President of the Hawaiian Civic Club from 1952 to 1953 and Senator of the Hawaii State Senate between 1963 and 1964. She had three children by her first husband: Edward A. Kaw\u0101nanakoa, Virginia Po\u02bbomaikelani Kaw\u0101nanakoa (1926\u201398), and Esther Kapi\u02bbolani Kaw\u0101nanakoa Marignoli (born 1928). Among other things, from 1945 she was the Regent of the Hale o na Alii o Hawaii (House of Chiefs of Hawaii). On the subject of the restoration of the Hawaiian monarchy, she is quoted to have said: \"If American wanted do something to restore the monarchy that would be all right. But no Hawaiians would do anything to hurt America. We love America too much.\" She died on Maui of a stroke, on April 8, 1961. There were plans to bury her at a new burial plot at the Royal Mausoleum, but her widower Harry Field felt uncomfortable about the prospect of being buried at the Royal Mausoleum. Instead he had her buried in the Oahu Cemetery on the Kaw\u0101nanakoa family plot. ==Family tree== *Kaw\u0101nanakoa family tree ==References== Category:1903 births Category:1961 deaths Category:House of Kaw\u0101nanakoa Category:Pretenders to the Hawaiian throne Category:Hawaiian princesses Category:Burials at Oahu Cemetery ",
