    "text": "Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica is a guaran\u00e1-flavoured soft drink, originating in Brazil and manufactured and distributed by AmBev, a subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev. It was created in 1921 by Pedro Baptista de Andrade for Companhia Antarctica Paulista, now part of Anheuser-Busch InBev. The drink is produced in four countries: Portugal, Brazil, Argentina and Japan. In Brazil, it is also available as the low calorie version Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica Zero. Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica is also available in The taste is mild and slightly apple-like, with a berry after-flavour. == Ingredients == Carbonated water, sugar, (E150d) caramel colour, citric acid, (E211) sodium benzoate and (E202) potassium sorbate (preservatives), ascorbic acid (antioxidant), guaran\u00e1 extract and natural flavours. ===Nutrition=== == Advertising == One of Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica's 2006 commercials featured Argentine football player Diego Maradona finding himself wearing the yellow jersey of the Brazilian team and singing the Brazilian national anthem before waking up and proclaiming it was a nightmare, because he had drunk too much guaran\u00e1 the day before. Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica aired a controversial commercial showing the guarana berry plantations in the Amazon region while a narrator explained the basics of the process of producing Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica and introduced the audience to the guaran\u00e1 tree. By the end of the spot the narrator turns to the audience and says: \"Now ask Coca-Cola to show you the coca tree...\". This spot was a direct attack to Coca-Cola and how its flagship product initially contained cocaine. In response, Coca-Cola aired equally controversial commercials for its guaran\u00e1-based Kuat drink, such as one in which former World No. 1 Tennis Player Gustavo Kuerten asks a street vendor for a guaran\u00e1, to which the vendor responds by throwing him a can of Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica, which Kuerten throws back to the vendor. After a few exchanges, Kuerten proceeds to say: \"joga direito!\" (\"do it the right way\"), which prompts the vendor to toss him a can of Kuat. ==References== *Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica 2006 Ad ==External links== *Official site of Guaran\u00e1 Antarctica Category:Brazilian brands Category:Brazilian cuisine Antartica Category:Products introduced in 1921 ",
