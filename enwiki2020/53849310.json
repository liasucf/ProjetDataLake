    "text": "As of 2015, there were at least five Sanskrit translations available of the Tirukkural. ==History of translations== Despite its thin popularity as a spoken and colloquial language, Sanskrit is considered divine and a language of revelation by scholars. This resulted in more than five translations available of the Kural text in Sanskrit. Unlike in other languages where maiden attempts of translating the Kural text is widely made in prose, all translations in Sanskrit are made in verse in the form of typical slokas. This is because historically Sanskrit literature has been in verse, for which it has gained renown. The Kural was translated into Sanskrit for the first time in 1922 by Appa Vajapeyin. It was published by Gururajachariar under the title Suniti Kusuma Mala at Kumbakonam. The second translation was published in 1937\u20131940 by Sankara Subramanya Sastri, who published it as \"Sugati Ratnaakaraa\" in the journal Sahridaya. Another translation was published in verse by an anonymous translator. It was published in Delhi and contained prose explanation in Hindi. The translation by Sanskrit scholar S. N. Srirama Desikan was published in 1961 and in 1978. It was published in Madras by Sarasa Kala Nilayam. Besides translating Tirukkural into Sanskrit, he has translated several other Tamil classics such as Ettuthogai (Eight Anthologies), Pathup\u0101ttu (Ten Idylls), Silappadik\u0101ram, Thirupp\u0101vai, Kambar\u0101m\u0101yanam, N\u0101ladiy\u0101r etc. ==Translations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"text-align:center; width:25%;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Translation !colspan=\"2\"|Chapter 26, \u092e\u093e\u0901\u0938\u0935\u0930\u094d\u091c\u0928\u092e\u094d |- !Kural 254 (Couplet 26:4) !Kural 258 (Couplet 26:8) |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|S.
