This post is normally filled by a high-ranking military officer who retains his commission while serving in an embassy. Opportunities sometimes arise for service in the field with military forces of another sovereign state. ==History== An early example, General Edward Stopford Claremont, served as the first British military attach\u00e9 (at first described as \"military commissioner\") based in Paris for 25 years from 1856 to 1881. Though based in the embassy, he was attached to the French army command during the Crimean War of 1853-1856 and later campaigns. The functions of a military attach\u00e9 are illustrated by actions of U.S. military attach\u00e9s in Japan around the time of the Russo-Japanese war of 1904\u20131905. A series of military officers had been assigned to the American diplomatic mission in Tokyo since 1901, when the U.S. and Japan were co-operating closely in response to the Boxer Rebellion of 1899-1901 in China. The military attach\u00e9 advised the United States Ambassador to Japan on military matters, acted as a liaison between United States Army and the Imperial General Headquarters, and gathered and disseminated intelligence. The military attach\u00e9's office in Tokyo usually had two assistants and a number of \"language officers\" who were assigned specifically to learn Japanese while attached to Imperial Japanese Army regiments as observers. These \"language officers\" translated training and technical manuals and reported on conditions in Japanese military units.Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives, King's College London: US Military Intelligence Reports, Japan, Context During the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905), military attach\u00e9s from many Western military organizations served as observers with the land and naval forces of Russia and of Japan. The United States Army detailed eight officers to serve as military attach\u00e9s with opposing forces in the field; and all served from the start of hostilities in 1904 through the signing of the peace protocols in September 1905.Cullen, Glen T. (1999). \"Preparing for battle: Learning Lessons in the US Army during World War I,\" p. 16. U.S. Army Command and General Staff College. After the war, the reports of British officers attached to the Japanese forces in the field were combined and published in four volumes._____. (1907). The Russo-Japanese War, Reports from British Officers Attached to the Japanese Forces in the Field, Vol. I; (1908). Vol. II. During this conflict, some attach\u00e9s served primarily in Manchuria, and others served primarily in Tokyo. Some, like Italian naval officer Ernesto Burzagli, saw service both at sea and in Tokyo. The agreed conditions that allow military attach\u00e9s to gather information can be misunderstood with fatal results. United States military attach\u00e9 Maj. Arthur D. Nicholson was killed March 24, 1985, while photographing a military installation in East Germany northwest of Berlin. He was reportedly observing from a point not marked off- limits, though near a place that was. According to Sgt. Jessie Schatz, Nicholson's driver, there were no warning shots and the Soviets refused to give Nicholson medical attention for nearly an hour. This activity had been agreed to by the United States and the Soviet Union. Such agreements stemmed from negotiations between United States and Soviet commanders in Germany back in 1947. Soviet liaison-teams were conducting similar missions in West Germany. These tours had evolved into a legalized form of intelligence- gathering, usually accepted by both sides. The killing became a diplomatic incident. In retaliation, the United States expelled Soviet military attach\u00e9 Stanislav Gromov. Mr. Gromov was apparently selected for his effectiveness in collecting intelligence on the United States for the Soviet Union from his post in Washington. ==See also== * Air attach\u00e9 * Ambassador * Arms industry * Defense Attach\u00e9 System (US) * Military attach\u00e9s and observers in the Russo- Japanese War * Military attach\u00e9s and war correspondents in the First World War * Science attach\u00e9 * Service in Israel Medal * United Nations Military Observer ==Notes and references== ==References== * Cullen, Glen T.
