According to Google Scholar his work has been cited over 17,700 times. In 1964, Kenneth Tobin began teaching high school science and mathematics in rural Western Australia. He continued as teacher and curriculum developer for a decade, after which he became a teacher educator at Graylands Teachers College, later to become part of Edith Cowan University. In Australia, Tobin has had faculty appointments at the Western Australian Institute of Technology (now Curtin University) and has been an adjunct professor at Queensland University of Technology, and Murdoch University.

As part of his focus on different complementary modalities, Tobin also has studied Integrated Iridology with Toni Miller (Brisbane, Australia). Presently he uses both JSJ and iridology in ongoing studies of wellness, mindfulness, and more broadly, contemplative inquiry. *Tobin, Kenneth (2018).
