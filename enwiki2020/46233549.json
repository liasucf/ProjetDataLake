The developer issued a warning that the Xbox One version contained a number of bugs.http://www.gamespot.com/articles/motogp-dev-warns-of-xbox-one- performance-issues/1100-6428442/ On the PlayStation 4, the consensus was that it looked ok, but did not improve significantly on the previous game. The Official PlayStation Magazine praised the bike handling, adding that \"AI riders put up a great fight, outbraking you into hairpins and slipstreaming past you down the straights. ... overall, the racing is solid and challenging, and securing a podium finish without resorting to the rewind function is a significant achievement.\" Analog Addiction praised the customisable race options and the stable and enjoyable multiplayer component. MotoGP 15 reached number 11 in the UK PS3 sales charts, as of April 19, 2016 still not available in North America and number 16 in the PS4 charts. ==References== Category:2015 video games Category:Video games developed in Italy Category:Grand Prix motorcycle racing video games Category:Racing video games Category:Grand Prix motorcycle racing Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox One games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Split-screen multiplayer games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:Video games set in Argentina Category:Video games set in Australia Category:Video games set in the Czech Republic Category:Video games set in England Category:Video games set in France Category:Video games set in Germany Category:Video games set in Indianapolis Category:Video games set in Italy Category:Video games set in Japan Category:Video games set in Malaysia Category:Video games set in the Netherlands Category:Video games set in Qatar Category:Video games set in Spain Category:Video games set in Texas Category:Video games with downloadable content Category:Milestone srl games ",
