Description of Web of Science coverage. See the page entitled \"Tech Specs\" Scholar Rainer Enrique Hamel has criticized the Arts & Humanities Citation Index for its poor reflection of scientific production in languages other than English. Also while analyzing solely content in Spanish of 2006 Hamel found the absurd situation that in the index there were more Spanish-language publications from authors based in the United States than from any other Spanish-language country. ==History== The index was originally developed by the Institute for Scientific Information, which was later acquired by Thomson Scientific.
