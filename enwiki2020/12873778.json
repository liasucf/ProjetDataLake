She was responsible for delivering troops, goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. ==Construction== Bullock was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 2110, on 26 September 1944, at Richmond, California, by Kaiser Cargo, Inc.; launched on 2 December 1944; sponsored by Mrs. J. L. Barker; acquired by the Navy on 2 March 1945; and commissioned that same day, Lieutenant Henry N. Barkhausen in command. ==Service history== ===World War II Pacific Theatre operations=== After a brief fitting out period at Oakland, California, the new cargo ship, with its inexperienced crew, got underway on 19 March 1945 for a shakedown cruise. Trial runs, tests of operating gear, and a full scale battle problem pointed out deficiencies in both ship and crew that received intensive work during the succeeding weeks. Bullock returned to San Francisco, California, on 12 April and loaded hull and engine spares, radio and radar gear, and frozen and chilled provisions to carry to the Admiralty Islands and the Philippine Islands. Bullock departed San Francisco on 20 April and headed for Manus where she arrived 23 days later. ===Operating in \"rear areas\"=== Between 13 May and 14 December, Bullock ferried military passengers and cargo between Manus, the Philippines, the Netherlands East Indies, and New Guinea. Having entered the war late and consigned to rear areas, the cargo ship never faced an enemy air or surface attack, although, while underway, she still steered zigzag courses and held battle drills because the threat of submarine attack, remote though it was, still existed. Bullocks mission did not change with the cessation of hostilities in August. She continued to transport supplies until 14 December, when she weighed anchor at Manila Bay and headed for the United States. ===Post-war decommissioning=== Bullock transited the Panama Canal on 28 January 1946 and reported to the Atlantic Fleet for duty. She arrived in Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 February, but received orders to Baltimore, Maryland, to be decommissioned. Bullock was decommissioned and returned to the Maritime Commission on 13 March 1946, and her name was struck from the Navy list on 28 March 1946. She was purchased by Dichmann, Wright, and Pugh in January 1947 for the Turkish government, for whom she began operation in 1947 under the name Edirne. ==Turkish service== Bullock went through several name changes in 1947 and 1948. She was renamed Edirne in 1947, then Adana in 1948, and then again in 1948 she was renamed Malatya. Along with her sister ships, ex-, renamed Kars, ex-, renamed Kastamonu, and ex-, renamed Rize, she would, for the next 15 years, provide cargo service between Turkey and Northern Europe. She was finally broken up in the Turkish port of Alia\u011fa in December 1982. ==Military awards and honors== The record does not indicate any battle stars for Bullock. However, her crew was eligible for the following medals: * American Campaign Medal * Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal * World War II Victory Medal * Philippines Liberation Medal == Notes == ;Citations == Bibliography == Online resources * * * * ==External links== * Category:Alamosa-class cargo ships Category:Ships built in Richmond, California Category:1944 ships Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:United States Navy Alabama-related ships ",
