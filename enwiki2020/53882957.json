National Archives Catalog. Retrieved: April 25, 2017. Previously, Warner Bros. had produced three short documentary films, Winning Your Wings (1942) starring Jimmy Stewart, Men Of The Sky (1942) and Beyond the Line of Duty (1942). Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hollywood rushed to turn out films to help win the war. The studios produced more than features, with countless cartoons and short subjects that were intended to inform the public, boost morale, encourage support of the Red Cross and other organizations that were helping at home and overseas or in recruitment. There were also films that were shown only to members of the armed forces. These films either trained them or entertained them. Rear Gunner is one of the best examples of how Hollywood pitched in and worked to boost morale and also recruit men into military service.Manning 2005, p. 42. ==Plot== L.A. \"Pee Wee\" Williams (Burgess Meredith), a young rural enlistee in the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) is initially assigned to heavy bombers but is disappointed with his job as an air mechanic. Noticing that he has the ideal characteristics of small stature and determination, led to pilot Lt. Ames (Ronald Reagan) asking him about his interest in being an air gunner. Pee Wee describes his experience in shooting black crows back home in Kansas. Following up, Ames sends Pee Wee to a skeet range, where he scores a perfect six out of six hits. The next step is to send the young recruit to an Army Air Forces Gunnery School. He joins hundreds of other students, including Benny (Dane Clark), a recruit whose sole experience with guns is in winning Kewpie dolls at an arcade. At the gunnery school, Pee Wee begins a five-week course and 200 hours of technical instruction and practical training. Soon the trainees move from classroom to skeet ranges, BB guns and gun truck platforms with machine guns mounted on the beds of pickup trucks, firing at clay targets. The last training sessions had trainees firing from the gunner's stations in North American T-6 Texan training aircraft. Throughout the training, his great marksmanship skills make Pee Wee stand out, and when he graduates, his first assignment is as a tail gunner in a four-engine Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber. Reuniting with Lt. Ames, Pee Wee and the crew are sent to the South Pacific. On his first mission, he shoots down a Japanese Zero. Later on a July 15, 1942 bombing mission, his bomber is able to successfully attack an enemy aircraft carrier but on the return flight, is intercepted by five enemy fighters. With two engines out, Lt. Ames relies on his gunners to keep the enemy at bay, shooting down four of the attackers. When Ames is forced to land his damaged bomber, the lone Japanese fighter strafes the crew huddling on the ground until Pee Wee climbs back into the bomber and shoots down the fighter. For his heroism, the rear gunner is awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. ==Cast== * Burgess Meredith as Pvt.

Flying men, > guarding the nation's borders, we'll be there followed by more! In echelon, > we carry on, for nothing can stop the Army Air Corps!
