    "text": "Edmond Roudnitska (1905\u20131996) was a French master perfumer and author. He is known for creating perfumes such as Dior's Eau Sauvage and Diorissimo, and Rochas's Femme. Many of his creations are still in production. He was the father of perfumer Michel Roudnitska. In 1926, he started his training in perfumery in Grasse. In 1942, he met Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Delveaux, who became his wife. In 1946, he founded Art et Parfum, a private lab for creating perfumes. Diorissimo, based on lily of the valley, was a notable achievement in the field of perfumery. Unlike rose or jasmine, the smell of lily of the valley cannot be extracted from essential oil of the flower. Roudnitska circumvented the problem by using aroma chemicals like hydroxycitronellal. ==For Christian Dior== *Diorama (1948) *Diorling (1951) *Eau Fra\u00eeche (1955) *Diorissimo (1956) *Eau Sauvage (1966) *Diorella (1972) *Dior-Dior (1976) ==For Elizabeth Arden== *It's You (1939) *On Dit (1952) *Elly (1955) *Arden (1956) ==For Herm\u00e8s== *Eau d'Herm\u00e8s (1951) *Grande Eau d'Herm\u00e8s (1987) *Hermes Rogue (1988) ==For Rochas== *Femme (1944) *Mousseline (1946) *Mouche (1947) *Moustache (1949) *La Rose (1949) ==Other scents== *Le Parfum de Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (early 1950s); rights acquired from Roudnitska's wife Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (for whom it was originally created in the early 1950s) by Frederic Malle, produced from 2000.
