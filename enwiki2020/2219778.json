    "text": "\"Strawberry Wine\" is a song by the alternative rock band My Bloody Valentine. It was released as a non-album single on 9 November 1987 on Lazy Records. It was the band's second release for Lazy and the first release to feature vocalist and guitarist Bilinda Butcher, who was recruited in April 1987 following the departure of original vocalist David Conway. \"Strawberry Wine\" was released as a 12-inch single in a limited pressing of 2,500 copies. The contents of the single were later combined with My Bloody Valentine's following release, the mini album Ecstasy (1987), and reissued on the compilation album Ecstasy and Wine (1989). The compilation album was released without the band's consent and due to an error, an alternate mix of \"Strawberry Wine\" was used. Upon its release, \"Strawberry Wine\" received moderate critical acclaim and peaked at number 13 on the United Kingdom Independent Singles Chart. Critics, who compared and contrasted it to Ecstasy, referred to the single as \"certainly the better of the two releases\" and described the title track as \"still sounding in parts like the old Valentines with a strong Mamas & Papas type vocal line\". The single's B-sides were referred to as \"throwaways, except for the curiously different guitar style being heard for the first time.\" In Loveless, a book from the 33\u2153 series about the My Bloody Valentine album of the same name, Mike McGonial referred to \"Strawberry Wine\" as a \"rarified, effete and poppy approach to Byrdsian rock\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== All personnel credits adapted from \"Strawberry Wine\"s liner notes. ;My Bloody Valentine *Kevin Shields \u2013 vocals, guitar *Bilinda Butcher \u2013 vocals, guitar *Debbie Googe \u2013 bass *Colm \u00d3 C\u00edos\u00f3ig \u2013 drums ;Technical personnel *My Bloody Valentine \u2013 production *Steve Nunn \u2013 engineering ==Chart positions== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1987) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Independent Singles Chart | 13 |} ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * ==External links== * * Category:1987 songs Category:1987 singles Category:My Bloody Valentine (band) songs Category:Songs written by Kevin Shields ",
