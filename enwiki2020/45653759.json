While her younger brother is often praised for his smarts, her family & neighbors have nothing to say about Suzuko. One day at work, Suzuko's co-worker offers to become roommates with Suzoko. Suzuko jumps at that chance to move out of her parents house and they set out to find an apartment. Unfortunately, Suzuko's friend never mentions her plan to have her boyfriend Takeshi live with them \u2013 until after they sign the lease on their apartment. Making matters worse, on their big moving day Suzuko finds her co-worker a no-show but her boyfriend Takeshi (Ryusei Saito) sits glumly in the apartment. It turns out that the couple recently experienced a falling out, with the boyfriend still intending to move into the apartment without his girlfriend. Things then hit the boiling point when Takeshi throws out Suzuko's cat. Suzuko retaliates the next day by throwing away all of his belongings and then quickly moves out before Takeshi returns.

It seems Suzuko broke the law by throwing away Takeshi's belongings and because of she is fined and receives a criminal record.
