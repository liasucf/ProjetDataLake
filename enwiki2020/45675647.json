    "text": "Civilizing the Economy: A New Economics of Provision is a book on the role of the economy in social relations by Marvin Brown, published in 2010. Civilizing the Economy exposes the role of the atlantic slave trade in early capitalism. In place of Adam Smith's myth of the invisible hand, Brown focuses on the slave owner's hands that created the wealth that Smith enjoyed. He then proposes a new framework that places the economy within the context of social relations, and demonstrates how we can transform social systems into an economy that provides for all. The book has been called \u201ca must read in redefining capitalism.\u201dGeorges Enderle comment (book cover), |url=https://www.amazon.com/Civilizing-Economy-New-Economics- Provision/dp/0521152461 ==Reception and Reviews== Noted business leader in sustainability, Ray Anderson wrote of the work: > As we humans puzzle our way to an understanding of how to live sustainably > within Earth\u2019s carrying capacity, Marvin Brown has provided a crucial piece > of the puzzle.
