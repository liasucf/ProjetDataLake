The 2013 ride around India was published as a series of contributions to The Guardian's \"Backpacking\" travelogue section between June and October of that year. The column on his ride, which was planned to span India to England, ended when he suffered broken ribs and other injuries after being kicked off his bike by a heifer in the road.
