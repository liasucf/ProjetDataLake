    "text": "Rozhanitsy, narecnitsy, and sudzhenitsy are invisible spirits or deities of fate in the pre-Christian religion of the Slavs. Related to pregnancy, motherhood, marriage and female ancestors. Often quoted together with Rod. They are usually mentioned three together, but sometimes up to 9 together, of which one was a \"queen\" or singular.The Mythology of All Races (1918), Vol. III, Section \"Slavic\", Part I: The Genii, Chapter IV: Genii of Fate, pp. 249-252 They are related to Dola, but it is not known on what terms. In Poland they were worshipped as zorze (auroras). == Names and meaning == In different regions of the Slavs and languages they were named differently: * Croatian: rodjenice, rojenice, ro\u017eenice, sudice, sudjenice, sujenice * Slovene: rodjenice, rojenice, sudice, sojenice, sujenice * Bulgarian: sud\u017eenici, nar\u016d\u010dnici, orisnici, urisnici, uresici * Czech and Slovak: rodjenice, sudjenice, sudi\u010dky * Polish: rodzanice, narecznice, sudiczki * Serbian: su\u0111aje, su\u0111enice, ro\u0111enice, nare\u010dnici * Old East Slavic, Russian: ro\u017eanice, ud\u0115lnicy Terms rodzanica, rodjenica or rojenica come from word roditi (\"giving birth\") and literally mean \"woman giving birth\". Terms sudiczka, sudica, or sojenica come from word sud (\"judgment\", \"judge\", \"court\") and literally mean \"judging woman\". Terms narecznica, nerechnitsa, narucnica mean \"name giving woman\". Term udelnica mean \"granting woman\". Bulgarian terms orisnici, urisnici, uresici come from the Greek word \u03cc\u03c1\u03af\u03b6\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 (orizontes - \"establish\") and mean \"establishing woman\u201d. In the Eastern Slavs, the personification of good fortune was also known as Dolya, whose name means \"division\", \"participation\", and bad luck as Nedolya. In Serbs and Croats, on the other hand, there is Sre\u0107a - whose name means \"luck\". In some regions of Poland, the functions of rozhanitsy were fulfilled by other figures: boginki in Lesser Poland, kra\u015bniki in Pomerania. In The Catalogue Of Rudolph's Magic, written by Edward Karvot, who wrote the information collected by Brother Rudolf about the customs of pagan Western Slavs, we read that the Slavs \"make sacrifices to their three sisters, which the pagans call Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos to lend them wealth.\" Rudolph, probably not knowing the language of the Slavs, gave rozhanitsy the names of Moirai, which he knew from Greek mythology, and which perform the same functions as the rozhanitsy. The rozhanitsy after Christianization were replaced by the Mothers of God or saint women. In Russian charms of a maturing boy, Parascheva, Anastasia and Barbara are mentioned, and in Bulgarian folklore Mother of God, Parascheva and Anastasia. Angels or even Christ Himself also took over the functions of rozhanitsy. == Sources == Word of St. Gregory Theologian about how pagans bowed to idols of the 11th century is first source mentioning about rozhanitsy: Word of Chrystolubiec describes the prayers dedicated to the Rod and rozhanitsy: The cult of Rozhanitsy was still popular in the 16th century Rus, as evidenced by penance given during confession by Orthodox priests described in the penitentiaries of Saint Sabbas of Storozhi[1: Izmail Sreznevsky collected the following sources in his Materials for the Old Russian dictionary: Narecnitsy often appear in various South Slavic legends and epics, one of them is the epic of Prince Marko: {| | :Vreme bilo tokmo na polnoke, :na polnoke, vreme glua doba; :\u0161to mu do\u0161le do tri nare\u010dnici, :na deteto k\u016dsmet da nare\u010dat; :... :Vala Bogu za \u010dudo golemo, :\u0161to se reklo ot tri nare\u010dnici, :\u0161to se reklo, i se izv\u016dr\u0161ilo. | :It was exactly midnight, :at midnight, at a deaf time; :when three narecnitsy came to him, :the child's destiny was outlined; :... :Praise God for a great miracle, :what was said from the three narecnitsy, :what was said was fulfilled. |} The first to record the cult of auroras was the ethnographer Zorian Do\u0142\u0119ga Chodakowski. He wrote about it in his work About Slavdom before Christianity: Polish literature historian Stefan Vrtel- Wierczy\u0144ski in Medieval Polish secular poetry wrote a spell discovered by Br\u00fcckner: {| | :Zarze, zarzyce, trzy siestrzyce. :Posz\u0142a Matka Bo\u017ca po morzu, zbiraj\u0105c z\u0142ote pianki; :Potka\u0142 j\u0105 \u015bwi\u0119ty Jan: A gdzie idziesz matuchno? :Id\u0119 synaczka swego leczy\u0107. | :Auroras, auroras, three sisters. :Mother of God went on the see, collecting golden foams :Saint John met her: Where are you going, mother? :I'm going to heal my son. |} Polish folklorist Stanis\u0142aw Czernik in his book Trzy zorze dziewicze: w\u015br\u00f3d zamawia\u0144 i zakl\u0119\u0107 (Three virgin auroras: among orders and spells), he cites the following spell: {| | :Zorzyczki, zorzyczki, :trzy was jest :jedna porankowa, :druga po\u0142udniowa, :trzecia wieczorowa. :We\u017acie od mego dziecka p\u0142aczenie, :oddajcie mu spanie. | :Little auroras, little auroras, :there are three of you :one morning, :second midday :third evening. :Take a cry from my child, :give him sleep back. |} The Wis\u0142a geographical and ethnographic monthly gives the following spell over a baby crying at night, that is spell for three days during sunset, and a prayer for a good husband: {| | :Zorze, zorze, zorznice :Odbierzcie od naszego dziecka p\u0142acznice | :Auroras, auroras, auroras :Take away crying from our child |} {| | : Zorze, zorzecze\u0144ki! : Wszystkie\u015bta moje siostrucze\u0144ki! : Siadajta na konia wronego : I jed\u017ata po towarzysza mojego. : \u017beby on nie m\u00f3g\u0142 beze mnie : ni spa\u0107, ni je\u015b\u0107, : ni siada\u0107, ni gada\u0107. : \u017beby ja mu si\u0119 spodoba\u0142a we stanie, w robocie, w ochocie. : \u017beby ja by\u0142a wdzi\u0119czna i przyjemna Bogu i ludziom, : i temu towarzyszowi mojemu. | : Auroras, little auroras! : You all are my little sisters! : Sit on a black horse : And go for my companion. : So that he could not without me : neither sleep, nor eat, : nor sit, nor speak. : So that he likes me in stand, in work, in desire : So that I would be grateful and pleasing to God and people, : and to my companion. |} == Look == In the folklore of the Southern Slavs, rozhanitsy are described as beautiful girls or as good-natured elderly women. Sometimes also represented as three women of different ages: a girl, an adult woman and an elderly woman. Southern Slavs described them as beautiful figures with white, round cheeks. They were to be dressed in white clothes and had a white cap (mob cap) on their heads and to have silver and gold jewelry. In their hands they were to hold burning candles through which their silhouettes were to be easily visible in the moonlight. Czechs described them as white-dressed virgins or old women. They were to be tall and transparent, their cheeks were to be pale and their eyes were to spark and charm people and their hair was decorated with precious stones. Like the southern Slavs, they were to wear a white bonnet or veil. == Functions and cult == Spinner turns the thread of life at the cradle of the Mother of God. Fragment of the \"Nativity\" icon, Ukraine, 16th century. They were to look after pregnant women, and after giving birth to a child, they determined his fate for the rest of his life. The rozhanitsy appeared at midnight, three days after the birth of the child, at his cradle, then they were supposed to foretell the child good or bad fate for life. After determining the fate of the child, it was saved as an indelible mark on the forehead. The rozhanitsy opinions on the future of the child were often contradictory, and the final, oldest parent makes the final decision. The first, youngest rozhanitsa spins, the second measures and the third cuts off the thread of life - the longer the thread, the longer life will be. In southern Slavs, rozhanitsy were sometimes distinguished from sudzhenitsy, which were to appear before death and during important moments in life. Rozhanitsy were sometimes called to protect the family from illness. According to Procopius, Slavs did not believe in destiny: According to sources, a trapezoidal table with bread, honey, cheese and groat (kutia) was prepared in honor of the rozhanitsy, sometimes the meal was left in the shrines. First haircut was sacrified to the rozhanitsy - cut hair should be offered to the rozhanitsy. Slovenes and Croats used to put candles, wine, bread and salt in the room where the woman lies the day after delivery. Failure to do so threatened that rozhanitsy would determine a child's bad fortune. Slovenians living in Istria laid bread under the boulders next to the caves in which rozhanitsy were to live, and in Bulgaria suppers were prepared. In the Czech Republic, a table was prepared on which white clothes and chairs were waiting for rozhanitsy and chair, on which bread, salt and butter were laid, sometimes cheese and beer. One of Rod's and rozhanitsy holidays was to be December 26, which after Christianization was replaced by the Orthodox Church with the Feast of the Mother of God. The rozhanitsy were to live at the end of the world in the palace of the Sun, which could connect them to the solar deity. In many European religions there are three female characters telling the child the future, which indicates the Indo-European origin of the rozhanitsy: *Roman Parcae *Greek Moirai *Norse Norns *Celtic Brigid in three persons or three Matres *Baltic Laima, which sometimes appeared in three forms == Goddess Rozhanitsa == Old Russian sources also mention the rozhanitsa as a single person, usually as a pair of Rod and Rodzanica. An example of such a source is the 12th century chronicle Gesta regum Anglorum, which describes the cult of Svetovid among the Slavs of Elbe, comparing him to Roman Fortune and Greek T\u00fdch\u0113. The 13th century Russian translation of this chronicle translates Fortune as Rozhanitsa (\u0420\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430). Another example could be the Word about how pagans bowed to idols: \"Artemis and Artemisa called Rod and Roshanitsa\". In such a situation, Rozhanitsa could be the Mother Goddess - the goddess of fertility and motherhood. According to mythologists, the triple deities of fate are the hypostasis of the ancient goddess of fate. Pragermani Ur\u00f0r and early Greek Clotho were to be such goddesses. A similar process probably took place in the Slavs and in that situation Dolya could be the original goddess of fate. Boris Rybakov tied rozhanitsa with Lada, claiming that Lada was Rod's partner and also the first rozhanitsa. == In popular culture == *Percival Schuttenbach - Rodzanice (Strzyga album) == References == == Bibliography == * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Slavic mythology Category:Slavic neopaganism Category:Destiny Category:Time and fate deities ",
