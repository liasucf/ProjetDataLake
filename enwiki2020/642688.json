    "text": "Adam Clark Curry (born September 3, 1964) is a podcaster, announcer, Internet entrepreneur and media personality, known for his stint as VJ on MTV and being one of the first celebrities personally to create and administer Web sites. Also known for co-hosting the No Agenda show, in the 2000s, he first became involved in podcasting, and has been called the 'Podfather' because of his efforts. ==Early broadcast career== Adam Curry in 1984. Curry was born in Arlington, Virginia, but lived in Amstelveen, Netherlands, from 1972 to 1987. After a time working in Dutch pirate radio at Radio Picasso in Amstelveen and in Amsterdam in the early eighties under the pseudonym \"John Holden\", he got a break in broadcasting as the host of the Dutch weekly pop-music television program Countdown, and the English version of the same show, which was broadcast on pan-European music channel Music Box. He also hosted several other radio and television programs for the Dutch broadcast station Veronica. Aside Countdown, in the Netherlands Adam Curry is mostly known for his part in the Curry and Van Inkel radioshow (together with Dutch DJ Jeroen van Inkel), broadcast on Radio 3 for Veronica between 19:00 and 22:00 on Friday. In 1987, Curry became a VJ for MTV. Besides making spot appearances between music videos, he was also host of the programs Headbangers Ball and MTV Top 20 Video Countdown in which he interviewed stars like Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney. While working for MTV, he also did radio work, including drive-time host for the New York City radio station WHTZ, and host of the national program HitLine USA. Curry hosted the radio countdown show \"Adam Curry's Top 30 Hitlist\" for Entertainment Radio Networks from November 1991 to June 1994. ==Web and MTV.com== Curry registered the then-unclaimed domain name \"mtv.com\" in 1993 with the idea of being MTV's unofficial new voice on the Internet. Although this move was sanctioned by his superiors at MTV Networks at the time, when Curry left to start his own web-portal design and hosting company, OnRamp Inc, MTV subsequently sued him for the domain name. OnRamp eventually grew to 4,000 employees and was sold to Think New Ideas Inc., another company that he co-founded, becoming Chief Technology Officer of Think. In 1996, as the Internet was undergoing its \"bubble\", the company made an initial public offering on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol THNK. It subsequently grew to employ over 7400 people and with offices in seven countries, and was absorbed into Answerthink Inc., in a later merger. In 2005, Curry founded a video sharing site called PodShow, which later changed its name to Mevio, with Ron Bloom. In May 2008, Mevio claimed to have reached 9 million unique visitors. It offers advertisers \"brand safe\" content on a large scale. It raised a US$15 million third round in July 2008, bringing the total amount it has raised since its launch to over US$38 million. Mevio later rebranded as Bitesize Entertainment and ultimately BiteSizeTV, located in Los Angeles, CA. ==Enterprises in the U.S. and Europe== After selling his business in the U.S., Curry and his family moved to the Netherlands in 1999, where Curry hosted a morning talk/music show for Radio Veronica. He also landed various television assignments and his family briefly starred in the reality show Adam's Family. Curry and two business partners founded the multimedia company United Resources of Jamby in 1999. It was to act as an incubator and cultivator for new Internet-related businesses. The business was ultimately unsuccessful. Curry's participation in Kennisnet, another venture to introduce the Internet to Dutch schools, ended in a bitter argument and lawsuits. Sportus.nl, an online webshop in collaboration with Dutch athletes like Marcel Wouda, Jacco Eltingh, Ron Zwerver and Dani\u00eblle Overgaag, started in 1999, went bankrupt in 2001. Another content exchange project, Freedom Controller, was cancelled in 2002. In 2000 he and business partner Simon Cavendish, a participant in his earlier ventures, founded the RotorJet company to offer helicopter services. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2005. In the subsequent dispute, Cavendish seized the assets of the company, and in April 2005, Curry was ordered by a Dutch court to repay approximately US$3 million that he had withdrawn from RotorJet. In 2002 he produced and starred in the reality soap Adam's Family: een kijkje in het leven van de familie Curry which was aired by the Dutch SBS6 network. ==Podcasting== Curry founded PodShow, now Mevio, with his business partner Ron Bloom, in January 2005. PodShow is a podcast promotions and advertising company that encompasses the Podshow Podcast Network, the Podcast Delivery Network, and the Podsafe Music Network. Some of Podshow's top podcasts are Curry's own Daily Source Code, The Dawn and Drew Show, and GeekBrief.TV. From June 2005 to May 2007, Curry hosted a weekday evening show on Sirius Satellite Radio called 'Adam Curry's PodShow'. In late 2005 Curry was caught making anonymous edits to the Podcast Wikipedia page, deleting several sections concerning contributions made by fellow podcasting pioneers, Kevin Marks and Stephen Downes, while adding material that emphasized his own involvement with the development of the medium. Curry went on to evoke ignorance as his primary defense stating, \"I edited out the Marks part previously because I never saw a full front-to-back solution that he was credited for...Once I saw the video of the session where he does demo it, after saying he had spoken to me and I had 'challenged' him to create it, I realized I was in error.\" He also claimed to have difficulty with the Wikipedia interface, claiming he had originally planned to revise the paragraphs to include his recollections of events but instead became \"exasperated\" with the process and decided to give up. Since October 2007, he has hosted the twice-weekly podcast the No Agenda Show with John C. Dvorak, discussing recent news whilst deconstructing mainstream news media. The podcast does not accept any advertising and is solely supported by the listeners. Curry has heavily promoted his podcasting endeavors. He promoted his podcast Daily Source Code in Second Life under the name 'Adam Neumann', along with a Second Life island called Podshow Island. Curry used podcasting to endorse 2008 Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul. He also uses his show to discuss alternative takes on topics in the daily news, as well as offering up topics of discussion that are \"off the beaten path\", such as Free energy suppressionDaily Source Code Episode 781, \"Confessions of a multimedia hitman\" and the 9/11 Truth Movement. Curry is widely credited for popularizing the podcast medium. As Annalee Newitz noted in Wired, \"Every new medium needs a celebrity, and Curry is happy to fill that role.\" On March 4, 2020 Curry appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast The Joe Rogan Experience and later re-appeared on September 8, 2020. During the September show, he discussed having Tourette syndrome. ==Creative Commons licensing== In February 2006, Curry sued the Dutch tabloid Weekend for reprinting photos from his Flickr page and publishing details about his daughter. The photos were released under a version of the Creative Commons license that forbids commercial use and requires acknowledgement, but the tabloid printed a few of them without contacting Curry. The verdict did not award Curry any damages, but forbade the tabloid from reprinting the photos in the future, setting a fine of \u20ac1,000 for each subsequent violation. It was one of the first times the license was tested in court. In May 2009, Curry posted on his blog that another Dutch tabloid had published another Creative Commons-licensed photo from Curry's Flickr account. After Curry asserted Creative Commons license requirements, the publisher settled on Curry's terms. ==Personal life== Since 1999, Curry has, at one time or another, lived in Belgium, Guildford, London, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin. Curry was married to Dutch television/radio personality Patricia Paay from 1989 to 2009. They have a daughter, Christina. In July 2012, Curry married Micky Hoogendijk. On January 29, 2015, Curry announced on the No Agenda show that he and Hoogendijk had separated. Hoogendijk and Curry divorced in 2015. Curry married his girlfriend of four years, Tina Snider (dubbed \"The Keeper\" by John C. Dvorak on the No Agenda Show), on May 19, 2019 in Austin, Texas. Curry is the nephew of former CIA official and United States Ambassador to Korea, Donald Gregg, whom he calls \"Uncle Don\" in his podcast. ==See also== *Wikipedia Signpost: Curry and podcasting ==References== * Podshow Pressroom (accessed July 14, 2006) ==External links== * * Adam Curry's No Agenda Podcast * Category:American radio personalities Category:American television personalities Category:American male bloggers Category:American bloggers Category:VJs (media personalities) Category:American men podcasters Category:American podcasters Category:People from Fire Island, New York Category:People from Guildford Category:American expatriates in the Netherlands Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:People from Arlington County, Virginia ",
