The VCML's position is that Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i was the last legitimate ruler of Vietnam. B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i and his children do not support the VCML or their political aspirations. __TOC__ ==History== The VCML was established in 1993 by its first President Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac B\u1eedu Ch\u00e1nh a member of the Vietnamese royal family who fled from Vietnam for political reasons after 1975. B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i lived in Europe until his death on 30 July 1997. His son, Crown Prince B\u1ea3o Long, intentionally remained out of politics and lived quietly in Paris, France until his death on 28 July 2007. His brother, Prince B\u1ea3o Thang, did not support the VCML until his death on 15 March 2017. The position of Head of the Imperial House is now held by Prince B\u1ea3o \u00c2n. ==Politics== The VCML believes that \"only the limited monarchy of the Imperial Nguyen Dynasty can succeed in preserving the cultural independence of Vietnam\" and that \"only a government that upholds Vietnamese nationalism and personal freedom can fully succeed in restoring the nation\". The VCML has repeatedly denounced the communist government of Vietnam over alleged corruption and human rights abuses. ==External links== *The Vietnamese Constitutional Monarchist League ==References== Category:Monarchism in Vietnam Category:Anti- communism in Vietnam Category:Anti-communist organizations Category:Monarchist parties Category:Overseas Vietnamese organizations Category:Organizations established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in the United States Category:Vietnamese democracy movements ",
