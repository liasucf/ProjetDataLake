    "text": "Tommies Bathing is a 1918 watercolor painting by John Singer Sargent. It is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. == Early history and creation == Sargent painted Tommies Bathing in the summer of 1918. The British government had commissioned him for a painting that would commemorate the efforts of the Americans and British in World War I, so he traveled to the front in the valley of the Somme to find a subject. During this time, he painted some informal watercolors, including Tommies Bathing. The name \"Tommy\" comes from \"Thomas Atkins,\" which was the a fictitious name that the British Army used on official forms for private soldiers. == Later history and display == The watercolor was a gift to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1950 from Mrs. Francis Ormond, Sargent's sister. == Description and interpretation == The work depicts soldiers bathing, resting, and sleeping or napping, implying a narrative from the bathing soldier, to the soldier drying himself in the sunlight, to the partially dressed soldier. Sargent used a high, voyeuristic viewpoint and shows the men in a state of complete relaxation. He also captured the shadows cast across the bodies by blades of grass, with technical facility. == References == Category:Created via preloaddraft Category:Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:Watercolor paintings Category:Paintings by John Singer Sargent Category:Bathing in art ",
