    "text": "Markets Now, also known as Fox Business News, is a daily business programming block that is aired weekdays from 11am-3pm Eastern Time on the Fox Business Network. ==About the program== Markets Now covers the day's market action, including real-time market coverage, breaking business news, and instant analysis. On May 12, 2008, the network replaced the final two hours of the block with two new programs, which debuted on the same day, Countdown to the Closing Bell (hosted by Liz Claman) and Fox Business After the Bell (formerly Fox Business Bulls and Bears, hosted by Claman and David Asman). Following the launch of Opening Bell with Maria Bartiromo in February 2014, Markets Now was reduced from its previous four-hour slot to one hour with Cheryl Casone. It will eventually be replaced by Risk and Reward hosted by Deirdre Bolton premiering on March 31, 2014. The Show Markets Now ended after several months of agony on March 27, 2014. ==Personalities== ===Anchors=== {| |valign=top width=150| ====11am-noon ET==== * Dagen McDowell * Connell McShane |valign=top width=150| ====noon-1pm ET==== * Cheryl Casone * Dennis Kneale |valign=top width=150| |valign=top width=150| ====1-3pm ET==== * Tracy Byrnes * Ashley Webster |} ====Reporters==== {| |valign=top width=150| * Dominic Di-Natale * Jeff Flock * Charlie Gasparino * Robert Gray * Charles Payne * Louise Pennell |valign=top width=150| * Nicole Petallides * Sandra Smith |} ====Contributors==== * Scott Bleier * John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield * Gary B.
