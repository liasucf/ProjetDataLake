    "text": "The Reverse Prince Albert piercing (RPA) is a form of male genital piercing. ==Characteristics== The reverse Prince Albert piercing enters through the urethra and exits through a hole pierced in the top of the glans. Because it passes through this thicker glans tissue rather than the comparatively thinner membrane between the urethra and the underside of the penis, healing time is substantially longer than the standard Prince Albert piercing. ==See also== *Prince Albert (genital piercing) *Genital piercing ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Penis piercings ",
