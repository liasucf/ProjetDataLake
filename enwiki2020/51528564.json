She is found by Dirk, a bus driver. He is the father of Eline but this must remain a secret. That's why he is introduced as an uncle of Eline since she was born. The police starts an investigation but all tracks are a dead end. Both Sylvie and Dirk try to find the man who is responsible. Dirk and Eline meet a drunk Sinterklaas on 5 December. The man's behavior towards the children and the way Eline acts when she sees him, makes Dirk believe he is the wrongdoer. Eline tells Dirk the wrongdoer is named Robert. When Sinterklaas insinuates his name is Robert, Dirk kills him. He burns the car of the man and buries him under concrete on his farm. The police closes the investigation of Eline's case. Around Christmas a message is on national television regarding the disappeared man who is called Philippe. Eline associates this man with Sinterklaas and is happy he will not return.
