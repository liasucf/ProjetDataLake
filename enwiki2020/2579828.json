Whilst the suburb was initially developed as a medium/heavy industrial area, it has been redeveloped into a premier light industrial/commercial district with some pockets of residential dwellings. There are cafes and restaurants scattered throughout Silverwater, and these are generally small in size. Just south of Silverwater is Red Yard, which has numerous commercial and restaurant complexes. ==Transport== The M4 Western Motorway runs along the southern border of Silverwater with entry and exit ramps to Silverwater Road. Silverwater Bridge crosses the Parramatta River north into Ermington and Rydalmere.
