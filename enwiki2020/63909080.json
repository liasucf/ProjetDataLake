    "text": "Cladonia amaurocraea, commonly known as the quill lichen, is a species of fruticose lichen in the family Cladoniaceae. ==Taxonomy== The lichen was first described scientifically as Capitularia amaurocraea in 1810. It was transferred to the genus Cladonia in 1887. It is commonly known as quill lichen. ==Description== The thallus of Cladonia amaurocraea comprises tall (15\u2013100 mm high) and slender podetia that are irregularly or dichotomously branched. These podetia have a smooth, yellowish-green surface that is often mottled with patches of green and white. They either form a pointy tip, or a narrow cup that is either closed or has a narrow opening. The cortex contains usnic acid, while the medulla has barbatic acid. ==Habitat and distribution== Cladonia amaurocraea is found in boreal forests, where it typically grows on talus deposits between boulders and on rocky ground. In North America, it is widespread throughout Canada and Alaska. ==See also== *List of Cladonia species ==References== Category:Fungi described in 1810 Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi of North America amaurocraea ",
