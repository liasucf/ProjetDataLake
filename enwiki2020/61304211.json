    "text": "The Fall Creek Trail is a shared use path within the Indianapolis Parks system. It runs from the 79th Street, in the north east corner of city, to downtown Indianapolis, following the course of Fall Creek. It is nearly 7 miles and connects with the Monon Trail just south of Fall Creek Parkway - in Midtown Indianapolis. There are multiple trailheads along the trail, as well as 3 canoe slipways. The trail connects with several parks - Fort Harrison State Park, Skiles Test Nature Park, George E. Kessler Park, and Fall Creek & 30th Park. There are very few street crossings, with the primary exception at 38th Street, near Keystone Avenue. It follows the original George Kessler Boulevard Plan. == References == Category:Parks in Indianapolis ",
