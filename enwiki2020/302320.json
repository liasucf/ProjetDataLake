    "text": "The Citro\u00ebn C2 is a supermini that was produced by the French manufacturer Citro\u00ebn, with production starting August 2003. It replaced the Citro\u00ebn Saxo and was built at the Aulnay plant, on the outskirts of Paris. A different design of the C2, based on that of the Peugeot 206, is sold in China. The Citro\u00ebn C2 was discontinued in October 2009, and replaced by the Citro\u00ebn DS3 in January 2010. Along with the Citro\u00ebn C3, the C2 successfully replaced the popular, but ageing Citro\u00ebn Saxo. The two cars have relatively different designs, allowing Citro\u00ebn to grab different submarkets of the supermini class. The C2 was designed by Donato Coco. The C3 was originally designed as a larger \"family-friendly vehicle\", with its five doors, whereas the C2 was to project a \"young driver\" image with two doors and flatter styling. Unlike the Saxo, with 2 of 5 stars from Euro NCAP, the C2 achieved 4 out of 5 stars. ==Marketing and advertising issues== Unlike its sister models, the Citro\u00ebn C1 and C3, the C2 was seen as a victim of poor advertising. According to many in the motoring press, it was the most neglected model in the Citro\u00ebn lineup in terms of promotion. In comparison, the C1 and the C3, on which the C2 is based, were both well presented in the media. Despite that, the Citro\u00ebn C2 was awarded the \"Best European Hatchback of 2003\" in September 2003. ==Versions== The LX model was the \"no-frills\" version of the C2 and came with basic equipment, including black plastic bumpers and no fog lamps. The L model, produced from 2003 to 2005, came with black lower bumper and door handles, CD player, rear-seat modulation, and no fog lamps. The Design included body coloured bumpers and electric windows. The SX was the luxury spec. It featured 'bumper colour coded paint' and air conditioning, the latter of which increases the 1.1 SX's 0\u2013100 km/h time by 4.5 seconds to 17.2 seconds. The Furio, VTR and VTS are the sports models which made the C2's predecessor, the Saxo, famous as an affordable, sporty looking and very fast 'pocket rocket'. The Furio has the same sports body kit as the more expensive VTR and VTS models but lacks their alloy wheels. Earlier models of the Furio had 15\" Coyote alloys, but these were later replaced with wheel trims from the end of 2003 onwards. The VTR also has a engine, whereas the VTS, the premium sports model, has a engine capable of accelerating from 0 to in 8.0 seconds, seen as sluggish by modern hot hatch standards where the fastest contemporary hot hatch achieved 5.3 seconds (Clio V6), although this is designed to be more insurance friendly. Other additions that helped the VTS model achieve a low insurance rating (in the United Kingdom) were security-based including deadlocks and a Thatcham Category 1 alarm system which includes perimeter and volumetric detection as well as an engine immobiliser. The limited-edition model GT, introduced in September 2004, offered a sporty body kit, with bright red, blue, silver and black paintwork and unique white alloy wheels. All GTs have a numbered certificate to show their authenticity. Only 2,250 were made, exclusive to the United Kingdom. In 2006, there were a number of small revisions to the C2. Externally the car looks identical save minor changes to alloy wheels (on the VTR), half colour coded door mirrors, clear side indicator lenses, and white indicator rear lenses. Internal changes saw a new stereo with vehicle computer integration and some cosmetic changes to the driver displays and centre console. The previous models ran two integrated electrical systems. The popular CAN BUS (Controller Area Network, by Bosch) and PSA's proprietary VAN BUS (Vehicle Area Network). In 2006, PSA dumped the VAN BUS system for an all CAN-BUS system, giving it better functionality and compatibility with more component manufacturers. This required some of the electrical components to be replaced, explaining why the displays, radio/CD and some other electronic equipment were changed. The VTR Sensodrive and VTS manual were the two petrol options available for the Australian C2. ===Safety=== Euro NCAP test results for a LHD, three door hatchback variant on a registration of 2003: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |Test |Score |Points |- |Overall: | style=\"text-align:center;\"|N/A | style=\"text-align:center;\"|N/A |- |Adult occupant: | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text-align:center;\"|29 |- |Child occupant: | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"|29 |- |Pedestrian: | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"|12 |- |Safety assist: | style=\"text-align:center;\"|N/A | style=\"text-align:center;\"|N/A |- |} ===Facelift=== April 2007 saw Citro\u00ebn Europe announcing a facelift for its C2 model, which had received a minor update in November 2006. The 2009 C2 featured a larger front bumper and restyled grille with a chrome surround. The trim specifications remain in line with the range of 2008. Levels remained unchanged. ==Technology== The Citro\u00ebn C2 brings with it two key new technologies, the Stop & Start environmental system, and the SensoDrive five-speed automated manual. *The Stop & Start is a hybrid system, with the internal combustion engine being supplemented by a small electric motor. The \"Stop & Start\" system automatically disengages the engine when you bring the vehicle to a complete stop, with pressure being applied to the brake pedal. The engine quickly restarts when pressure on the brake pedal is relieved. The technology has been developed by Valeo and results in lower urban fuel consumption. The system, however, requires pressure on the brake pedal when stationary for the system to work, holding the vehicle on the handbrake (parking brake) alone will not be sufficient for the system to operate. The Stop & Start system is mounted to the SensoDrive gearbox. A Stop & Start system was previously seen in the 1980s, with the Volkswagen Polo \"Formel E\" and the Volkswagen Golf MKIII \"Ecomatic\", although this was different in operation; in the Volkswagen system the engine stopped automatically when placed in neutral. Selecting a gear by moving the stick to the left (for first or reverse) activated the starter motor. * The SensoDrive five-speed automated manual transmission is an electronically controlled manual gearbox, with the clutch and gear change functions electronically managed. As a result, the vehicle has no clutch pedal and the gear lever, which remains present, has no mechanical link with the gearbox. The SensoDrive gearbox is managed by a control unit, which controls two actuators. One actuator changes gears while the other, which is equipped with a facing wear compensation system, opens and closes the clutch. The gearbox control unit also dialogues with the engine control unit. The SensoDrive gearbox has two shifting options of either the fully automated mode, or the paddle- shifted/gear shifted manual mode. ==Engines available== *1.1 L TU1 (1124 cc) I4, 60 PS (59 hp/44 kW) *1.4 L TU3 (1360 cc) I4, 75 PS (73 hp/55 kW) *1.4 L ET3 SensoDrive Stop & Start (1360 cc) I4, 90 PS (88 hp/66 kW) *1.4 L DV4 HDi Diesel (1398 cc) I4, 68 PS (67 hp/50 kW) and 111 lb\u00b7ft (150 N\u00b7m) *1.6 L TU5 SensoDrive VTR (1587 cc) I4, 110 PS (108 hp/80 kW) *1.6 L TU5 VTS (1587cc) I4, 125 PS (123 hp/91 kW) *1.6 L DV6 HDi Diesel (1560cc) I4, 110 PS (109 hp/80 kW) and 198 lb\u00b7ft (269 N\u00b7m) ==Trim levels== ===United Kingdom trim levels=== ====2003\u20132008==== *L *Airplay *LX *Design *Cool *SX *Stop & Start *Furio *VTR *VTS *GT (Limited Edition 2004) *Loeb (Limited Edition 2007) *Code (Limited Edition 2007) ====2008\u20132009==== *Vibe 1.1i and 1.4HDi. *Rhythm 1.1i, 1.4i and 1.4HDi. *Cachet 1.1i and 1.4i. *Stop & Start 1.4i 16v SensoDrive. *VTR 1.4i, 1.6i 16v SensoDrive and 1.4HDi.

With a modified front and rear body, this is similar to the way the Citro\u00ebn LN was derived from the Peugeot 104. The car has no common features with the model sold on other markets, due to the positioning of the model in the line up of Citro\u00ebn China. It is produced in China at the Wuhan Dongfeng Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn Automobile site. It has a length of , width of , height of , with a wheelbase of , and is powered by one of the two engine options: a 1.4 L () and a 1.6 L (). Weight ranges from to . ==C2 in Motorsport== S\u00e9bastien Ogier competing in a C2 S1600 at the 2008 Rallye Deutschland. After the success of Citro\u00ebn's Xsara in the World Rally Championship (WRC), Citro\u00ebn expanded their interests to achieve success not only in the WRC but in the support championship, the Junior World Rally Championship (JWRC) in 2004. The earlier Citro\u00ebn Saxo Super 1600 JWRC car was highly successful. The car won the JWRC title with S\u00e9bastien Loeb in 2001, and brought him to the attention of Citro\u00ebn Total World Rally Team, and again with Daniel Sol\u00e0 in 2002. With the new C2 replacing the aging Saxo, Citro\u00ebn concentrated upon making their new car a winner. Using a heavily modified C2 to create the Citro\u00ebn C2 S1600, the works team and Dani Sordo succeeded in winning the championship in 2005. The C2 S1600 has continued to compete in the championship with privateer teams and remains successful despite newer machinery from Suzuki, Renault, and Fiat-work teams. In the season of 2008, S\u00e9bastien Ogier brought the Citro\u00ebn C2 its second junior title, and in 2009, the C2 was again the title-winning car, with Martin Prokop taking the championship. ==Sales and production== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\";\" |- align=\"center\" | style=\"background:#e2e2e2;\"|Year | style=\"background:#e2e2e2;\"|Worldwide Production | style=\"background:#e2e2e2;\"|Worldwide sales | style=\"background:#e2e2e2;\"|Notes |- |2009 | align=\"center\" |49,100 | align=\"center\" |52,400 | |- |2010 | align=\"center\" |8,200 | align=\"center\" |9,300 | |- |2011 | align=\"center\" |10,403 | align=\"center\" |10,468 |Total production reaches 676,004 units. |- |2012 | align=\"center\" |14,800 | align=\"center\" |14,600 |Total production reaches 690,800 units. |} ==References== ==External links== *C2 at Citro\u00ebn\u00ebt *Citro\u00ebn Crash Test C2 *Index of Citro\u00ebn C2 links *UK Citro\u00ebn C2 information website C2 Category:Subcompact cars Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Euro NCAP superminis Category:Hatchbacks Category:Cars introduced in 2003 ",
