The format will be the same as the opening season with one league consisting of the 7 teams, who will play each other twice, with the top 4 teams advancing to the end of season playoffs. The closing season commenced on 11 January 2020. On 18 April 2020 a virtual meeting was held by the Premier League of Belize, and it was unanimously agreed by club owners to cancel the remainder of the closing season due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic. The league also stated that the safety of players, officials, fans and stakeholders had to be taken into consideration. It was also agreed that Verdes would represent Belize at the 2020 CONCACAF League. According to the league, the decision to allow Verdes to represent Belize was based on the fact that the club had won the 2019\u201320 opening season, and was the aggregate point leader with a total of 51 points at the initial juncture, when the season was suspended. ===League table=== ===Results=== ===Season statistics=== ====Top scorers==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !Rank !Player !Team !Goals |- !rowspan=\"1\"|1 |align=\"left\"| Georgie Welcome |align=\"left\"| Belmopan Bandits |rowspan=\"1\"|8 |- !rowspan=\"2\"|2 |align=\"left\"| Facundo Garnier |align=\"left\"| Belmopan Bandits |rowspan=\"2\"|7 |- |align=\"left\"| Jesse Smith |align=\"left\"| San Pedro Pirates |- !rowspan=\"1\"|4 |align=\"left\"| Krisean Lopez |align=\"left\"| Verdes |rowspan=\"1\"|3 |} ====Hat-tricks==== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
