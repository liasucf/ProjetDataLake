The m\u1ea1ch currency unit was used on both copper-alloy cash coins and silver ingots, the only series of cash coins to use the character \"m\u1ea1ch\" (\u964c) in its inscription was the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao (\u55e3\u5fb7\u5bf6\u9214) cash coins, but had been previously used as a denomination (by imperial decree) for larger cash coins under the Minh M\u1ea1ng Emperor. Unlike smaller coins, cash coins denominated in m\u1ea1ch were usually strung in strings of 10 coins. == History == A large brass Minh M\u1ea1ng Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o (\u660e\u547d\u901a\u5bf6) cash coin of 1 m\u1ea1ch The Minh M\u1ea1ng emperor issued an imperial edict in 1837 stating \"it is ruled under the terms of the law that the large monies of brass bearing moral inscriptions will have the value of a M\u1ea1ch. One will make use of it in transactions and their value is thus fixed for all\". These larger cash coins with \"moral inscriptions\" (\u7f8e\u865f, m\u1ef9 hi\u1ec7u) were issued under the emperors Minh M\u1ea1ng, Thi\u1ec7u Tr\u1ecb, and T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c. These coins were established by an edit in 1837, which stated that their manufacture should be entrusted to a commission composed of four representatives from different government agencies, one from the Ministry of Revenue (\u6238\u90e8, H\u1ed9 B\u1ed9), one from the Ministry of Public Works (\u5de5\u90e8, C\u00f4ng B\u1ed9), one from the Censorate (\u90fd\u5bdf\u9662, \u0110\u00f4 s\u00e1t vi\u1ec7n), and one representative from the Imperial Guard (\u4f8d\u885b, Th\u1ecb v\u1ec7). It is also highly likely that the designs of these cash coins were selected from manuals or commentaries published by the Directorate of Education (\u570b\u5b50\u76e3, Qu\u1ed1c t\u1eed gi\u00e1m). These representatives were ordered to meet in a committee with the Director of the Mint and had to take to the Imperial Treasury some good quality metals, which included copper, tin, and zinc, they had to use these metals to make an alloy from them which was already prescribed to the proportions already set for these cash coins. The inscriptions had to be similar to those issued in previous years (these inscriptions were selected from a list \"from the sacred and venerated books\") and an annual production of 100,000 cash coins of 1 m\u1ea1ch was set. The edict stated that 23 inscriptions with 8 characters and 17 with 4 characters had to be devised annually. Examples of inscriptions used on 1 m\u1ea1ch Minh M\u1ea1ng Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o (\u660e\u547d\u901a\u5bf6) cash coins would be Trung h\u00f2a v\u1ecb d\u1ee5c (\u4e2d\u548c\u4f4d\u80b2, \"Balance and harmony, all in place, multiply\"), Qu\u1ed1c Th\u00e1i D\u00e2n An Phong \u00d0i\u1ec1u V\u0169 Thu\u1ea7n (\"Country Prospers, People Content, Wind and Rain Plentiful\"), and Nguy\u00ean hanh l\u1ee3i trinh (\u5143\u4ea8\u5229\u8c9e, \"The primordial exerts his influence, propicious and virtuous\"). Many of the inscriptions on these cash coins are Confucian poems while others are small quotes from Chinese literature. During the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c era some 1 m\u1ea1ch T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o (\u55e3\u5fb7\u901a\u5bf6) cash coins had inscriptions like Qu\u1ed1c Ph\u00fa, Binh C\u01b0\u1eddng, N\u1ed9i An.

Under the reign of the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c Emperor the ti\u1ec1n (\u9322), m\u1ea1ch, and qu\u00e1n units of account were all redefined, the m\u1ea1ch was now used to represent 60 zinc cash coins (v\u0103n) and 10 m\u1ea1ch would form a qu\u00e1n (600 v\u0103n). The reason for this reorganisation of how the Vietnamese currency worked was that the overwhelming disadvantages of carrying zinc cash coins as they were very low in value and very heavy to carry around when having large quantities of them. The solution proposed by the government was introduce currency symbols used to represent their value nominally without this being necessarily reflected in their intrinsic value. The inspiration for creating this policy might have come from the coinage cast under the Xianfeng Emperor in neighbouring China. At the time, the Qing dynasty introduced a fiat coinage with 14 different denominations ranging from 4 w\u00e9n to 1000 w\u00e9n.PENG Xin-Wei, (1958) Zhongguo Huobi Shi (Monetary History of China), second ed., Shanghai, Shanghai Renmin Chubanshe, (Peng pp. 833\u2013838). There were still some major differences between the Chinese and Vietnamese systems, as in the Vietnamese currency system the nominal value was represented either using a basic number currency symbol (v\u0103n) or in units of account (m\u1ea1ch and qu\u00e1n) using both copper and zinc with pegged values, while the Chinese coinage system used cash coins made from the same copper-alloys with their value being based on the nominal value and not the intrinsic one, while the respective value of either copper or zinc fluctuated the exchange rates of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty coinage. During this same era the Tokugawa shogunate of Japan introduced a 100 mon cash coin,XIV International Economic History Congress, Helsinki 2006 Session 106 Too Commercialised To Synchronize Currencies: Monetary Peasant Economy in Late Imperial China in Comparison with Contemporary Japan by Akinobu Kuroda (University of Tokyo) Retrieved: 11 June 2017Bank of Japan \u2013 Money Museum Early Modern Times (2) First half of the 19th century Bunsei and Tenp\u014d recoinages Retrieved: 11 June 2017. the Ryukyuans had 100 mon and half Shu cash coins,Ry\u016bky\u016b Ts\u016bh\u014d (in Japanese) Okinawa Compact Encyclopedia, \u6c96\u7e04\u30b3\u30f3\u30d1\u30af\u30c8\u4e8b\u5178, Ry\u016bky\u016b Shimp\u014d, 1 March 2003.

Despite taking inspiration from the coinage produced in Xianfeng era China and despite the fact that T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao could be translated as \"The banknotes of T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c\", the first series of these coinages weren't truly a fiat currency as the currency symbols were, though not 100%, based on a convertibility between them and the traditional zinc cash coinage, meaning that they can't be seen as a true fiat coinage. While the earlier 1 m\u1ea1ch were large coins, they were cast in brass with a diameter of about 50 millimeters and with weights varying according to the reign period: 26 to 28 grams during the Minh M\u1ea1ng era, rising to 35 to 41 grams during the Thi\u1ec7u Tr\u1ecb era, and reaching 35 to 50 grams during the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c era, but the new T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao of 60 v\u0103n (1 m\u1ea1ch) had a weight of only 12.20 grams. The main motivation of the government of \u0110\u1ea1i Nam to adopt this new system was purely to make the coin casting process more profitable, while the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o cash coins of 6 ph\u1ea7n or 9 ph\u1ea7n cost much to make, the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao cost significantly less for the same (or even higher) nominal value.ED.

By introducing the new system the government could cast brass cash coins of 50% copper and 50% zinc. If the government cast a cash coin of a nominal value of 10 v\u0103n with a weight of 1 ti\u1ec1n and 5 ph\u1ea7n, it could produce 8000 v\u0103n in T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao being worth 133 qu\u00e1n, 3 m\u1ea1ch, and 20 v\u0103n with a profit of 2 qu\u00e1n, 1 m\u1ea1ch, and 50 v\u0103n. While the same weight used to produce cash coins of 20 v\u0103n (these coins weigh 2 ti\u1ec1n) one obtains 6000 v\u0103n in T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao worth 200 qu\u00e1n with a profit of 68 qu\u00e1n, 2 m\u1ea1ch, and 35 v\u0103n. As the 60 v\u0103n T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao meant for general circulation was exactly worth 1 m\u1ea1ch it was cast in high number. Meanwhile, the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao cash coins of 10 v\u0103n, 20 v\u0103n, 30 v\u0103n, 40 v\u0103n, and 50 v\u0103n were cast at a rate of 20 smaller coins to 30 60 v\u0103n coins to serve as change. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%\" !colspan=2| Profit margins of the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao |- !

The new high-denomination cash coins would see little circulation; the only reason these high-denomination low intrinsic value saw circulation was because they were forced onto an unwilling public. The T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao series was abandoned shortly after its introduction. Afterwards a large number of T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao would still appear in the hands of private businesses such as metal founders, market stands, and antique shops selling them to Europeans, especially in Hanoi they were often displayed. The 2nd series of T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao cash coins did not have their nominal value expressed in how many zinc cash coins they were worth but in m\u1ea1ch and qu\u00e1n. Furthermore, as opposed to only using the character \"chu\u1ea9n\" (\u6e96) with the characters \"chu\u1ea9n \u0111ang\" (\u6e96\u7576) which convey the same message. This second series had the denominations of 2 m\u1ea1ch, 3 m\u1ea1ch, 8 m\u1ea1ch, 9 m\u1ea1ch, and 1 qu\u00e1n.Fran\u00e7ois Thierry de Crussol, Catalogue des monnaies Vietnamiennes, Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, 1987. (in French) While in the modern times a few of these cash coins have survived they weren't actually released into general circulation; this might have been because the government did not want to release coins whose face value would be too distinct from the traditional rate of exchange of copper-alloy cash coins which would have led to these emissions to be entirely rejected by the Vietnamese population. Fran\u00e7ois Thierry de Crussol notes how all these cash coins are made from roughly cast brass and aren't properly trimmed. Because of this he suspects that they were only test issues. After the production of the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao stopped in 1871, production of the old 1-m\u1ea1ch cash coins was continued according to a letter written by V\u00f5 \u0110\u00ecnh T\u00ecnh (\u6b66\u5ef7\u60c5), the head of the seal of\ufb01ce, under the Censorate. According to the letter the order was given to mint a new series of T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o cash coins with moral maxims, the total amounted to 36,133 pieces. During the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c era naming taboos were extended to the m\u1ea1ch cash coins, certain characters which were used on Minh M\u1ea1ng era m\u1ea1ch cash coins were discontinued. Naming taboos have been common tradition in the Chinese cultural world since ancient China, such as that during the Han dynasty the character bang (\u90a6), which could be translated as \"country\" or \"state\", was replaced with the guo (\u570b), which had a similar meaning because bang was a part of the personal name of the founding emperor Liu Bang. During the Tang dynasty the characters shi (\u4e16) and min (\u6c11), which were also modified as they were a part of Emperor Taizong of Tang's personal name, Li Shimin. A naming taboo meant that people may not use a Chinese character which was present in the personal or of official name of the Vietnamese emperor, the empress or an imperial ancestor. The Chinese character which had become a \"taboo character\" would have to be replaced with a homonym or a non-orthodox version of that character. In Southern Vietnam the surnames Ho\u00e0ng (\u9ec3) and V\u0169 (\u6b66) were read as Hu\u1ef3nh (\u9ec3) and V\u00f5 (\u6b66) because of naming taboos. Naming taboos were overseen by the Ministry of Rites (\u79ae\u90e8, L\u1ec5 B\u1ed9) and over time more Chinese characters on the m\u1ea1ch cash coins were affected by these naming taboos some of these characters included h\u00fay (\u8af1), hoa (\u83ef), and an (\u5b89). The naming taboo on the character an alone lead to the abolition of two types of 1 m\u1ea1ch cash coins due to their inclusion of this character. == See also == * Cochinchina piastre * Debasement == Notes == == References == == Sources == * Eduardo Toda y G\u00fcell (1882) ANNAM and its minor currency.
