    "text": "The 3DBenchy is a 3D computer model specifically designed for testing the accuracy and capabilities of 3D printers. The 3DBenchy is described by its creator, Creative Tools, as 'the jolly 3D printing torture-test' and was released in April 2015, with a multi-part, multi-color model released in July 2015. ==Use== The 3DBenchy is often used to test and benchmark 3D printers when they are reviewed, as the model includes a number of difficult-to-print features including: symmetry, overhanging curved surfaces, smooth surfaces, planar horizontal faces, large, small and slanted holes, low-slope-surfaces, first layer details and tiny surface details. The 3DBenchy is designed to be measured from specific points to ensure accurate printing including dimensional accuracy, warping, deviations and tolerances and it has a relatively short printing time of around 1 hour. The multi-material 3DBenchy is created for 3D printers capable of printing in multiple materials or colours, the model consists of 17 individual files which can each have different settings applied to them. The 3DBenchy is free to download and is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike license, meaning it can be shared and altered by anyone. ==Gallery== File:3D-printed 3DBenchy by Creative Tools.jpg|A 3DBenchy printed on a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer File:3DP Biggest Large Benchy.jpg|An extra-large (60cm x 31cm x 48cm) 3DBenchy printed in PLA, made on a large-format FDM printer.
