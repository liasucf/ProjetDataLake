    "text": "The Sierra de Tejeda is a mountain range in the Penibaetic System of mountains between the provinces of M\u00e1laga and Granada in Spain. Together with the Sierra de Almijara to the east and the Sierra de Alhama to the west it constitutes a limestone massif that acts as a physical border between the two provinces, separating the Axarqu\u00eda from the depression of Granada. The mountains contain the Sierras of Tejeda, Almijara and Alhama Natural Park. ==Location== Alcauc\u00edn - Canillas de Aceituno, April 2013 The Sierra de Tejeda is a small mountain range running in a northwest to southeast direction. It lies in the east of the M\u00e1laga and the southwest of the Granada. It covers an area of . The Sierre de Tejeda lies to the southeast of the Sierra de Alhama and to the northwest of the Sierra de Almijara. The Sierras of Tejida and Almijara form a single range about west of the Sierra Nevada. The mountains form part of a barrier between the coast and the interior. The name \"Tejeda'\" refers to the abundance of Taxus baccata, or tejos (yew) trees in the past.. There are a few remnants of these pines on La Maroma, including one at the Salto del Caballo near the peak. A small group is found in the upper part of the Barranco del Ca\u00f1uelo in the municipality of Alcauc\u00edn. ==Geology== The Sierra de Tejeda is in the central section of the Betic Range of Southern Spain. This part of the Betic cordilla has folds verging southwards from the Burdigalian age. The folds are cut by WSW-directed faults caused by extensional detachments in the Sierra de Tejeda anticline, and the fault surfaces are in turn cut by later NNW-directed faults from the Tortonian age. The most common rock in the Sierra Tejeda is limestone. The rocks belong to the Alpujarride complex. They include Middle and Late Miocene deposits up to thick of conglomerates, sands and bioclastic calcarenites. The bioclastic calcarenites contain marble cobbles and boulders up to in diameter. The Sierra Almijara and Sierra Tejeda form the southern margin of the western part of the depression of Granada, and contain tributaries of the Cac\u00edn River. Pliocene sediments exposed in the northwest of the Granada basin were washed down by the Cac\u00edn from the Alpujarride reliefs of the Almijara/Tejeda. The 1884 Andalusian earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 6.5. There were 745 deaths, and the villages of Arenas del Rey, Ventas de Zafarraya and Alhama de Granada were almost completely destroyed. The epicenter was on the northern side of the Sierra Tejeda near Ventas de Zefarraya, with a focus deep. The pioneering geologist Jos\u00e9 Macpherson y Hemas (1839\u20131902) explained the earthquake as having been caused by movement along the faults that bound the Tejeda / Almijara massif to the north and south. Others thought the cause might have been the collapse of underground cavities. ==Pico Tejeda== The peak of Tejeda (La Maroma) is high, and commands dramatic views of the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean coast. The Pico Tejeda, commonly called La Maroma, is also known as the \"roof of M\u00e1laga\". The name is derived from a large and deep cavity near the top. Ropes (maromas) were used to climb down into it to collect snow. The mountain can be climbed by several routes, of which the most traditional starts from the center of Canillas de Aceituno. Other routes start from the Alc\u00e1zar recreational area and from the Llanadas de Sedella in the municipality of Alcauc\u00edn. One of the simplest routes is on its north face in the territory of Alhama de Granada, starting from the El Robledal recreational area. ==Climate== The mountains have relatively high levels of rainfall, with highest rainfall in December, January and March, and lowest in July. Annual rainfall is in Alcauc\u00edn. At an altitude of the annual average precipitation is slightly more than . The Sierre de Tejeda receives a total of of rainfall in an average year. Annual average temperature at the Pantano de los Bermejales station at the foot of the Sierra is about . Higher in the mountains the temperatures range from . The flora are mostly xeric. There are many plant species common to the western Sierra Nevada and the Tejeda/Almijara range, which may have migrated between these regions via the intermediate Sierra de las Gu\u00e1jaras. ==Human presence== The early hominids in the region would have moved from caves on the coast to caves in the Sierra de Tejeda on a seasonal basis. The 40,000 year old bones of a Neanderthal man have been found in the Boquete de Zafarraya cave in Alcauc\u00edn, in a spur of the Sierra de Alhama just west of the Sierra de Tejeda. Canillas de Aceituno is at the foot of the Sierra, at an altitude of , in the region between the marbles of the Sierra de Tejeda and the schist land lower down in the slopes of the Almanchares river basin. The Fajara cave was used in the Neolithic era, and the R\u00e1bita cave shows evidence of iron ore extraction in Roman times. Three bridges on the slopes of the sierra in the towns of Sedella, Salares and Canillas de Albaida are said to have a Roman origin, although their appearance today is medieval. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * * * * * * Alhama Tejeda Category:Geography of the Province of Granada Category:Geography of the Province of M\u00e1laga ",
