    "text": "The Lapponia was an express passenger train operated by the Finnish State Railways, the predecessor of the current national rail traffic operator VR Group. The Lapponia trains operated on a direct route from Oulu via Sein\u00e4joki and Tampere to Helsinki. Southbound Lapponia trains departed from Oulu at 7:00am, arriving in Helsinki at approximately 2:00pm. The returning northbound train left Helsinki at 4:00pm, arriving in Oulu at 10:45pm. The Lapponia express train service began in 1974 as a fast and direct connection between Oulu and the nation's capital. In the beginning the trains had a maximum allowed speed of 120 kilometers per hour (74.5 miles per hour), but it was increased to 140 km/h (87.0 mph) in sections where the electrification was completed. The Lapponia trains ran under that name until 1994 when Finnish State Railways discontinued the use of train-specific naming. More or less the same time express passenger trains were superseded by intercity train service. ==Scheduled stops for Lapponia trains in 1987== The northbound Lapponia train (numbered EP 57) running on Helsinki\u2013Oulu route stopped in 1987 at following stations: * Helsinki Central (the train originated at Ilmala yard) * Tampere * Sein\u00e4joki * Kauhava * Benn\u00e4s (P\u00e4nn\u00e4inen) * Kokkola * Kannus * Ylivieska * Oulainen * Vihanti * Oulu, where the trains terminated The southbound Lapponia train (numbered EP 50) running on Oulu\u2013Helsinki route stopped also at railway stations in Parkano and H\u00e4meenlinna.Suomen kulkuneuvot 1987 ==References== Category:Named passenger trains of Finland ",
