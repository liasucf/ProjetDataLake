II, p. 704 (\"Laelia Gens\"). ==Branches and cognomina== The only family name of the Laelii was Balbus, a common cognomen, referring to one who stammers. A few of the Laelii used personal surnames, such as Sapiens (\"wise\"), by which the Laelius who was a friend of the younger Scipio Africanus was sometimes known.Chase, p. 110.The New College Latin & English Dictionary, \"sapiens\". ==Members== * Gaius Laelius, grandfather of the consul of 190 BC. * Gaius Laelius C. f., father of the consul. * Gaius Laelius C. f.
