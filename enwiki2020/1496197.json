He took power after he killed the previous High King, Eochu Apthach, whose disastrous year on the throne had been characterised by constant plague. He ruled for twenty, or twenty-two, or thirty years, depending on the source consulted, until he was killed by S\u00e9tna Innarraid, son of Bres R\u00ed.
