    "text": "The Golden State Athletic Conference (GSAC) is a college athletics conference in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). The conference commissioner is Mike Daniels. Conference leadership is shared among the member institutions. Nine of the ten members of the GSAC are Christian colleges located in California and Arizona. Conference teams have won 20 national championships. ==History== The Golden State Athletic Conference was formed in the fall of 1986, with Azusa Pacific University, California Lutheran University, Fresno Pacific University, Point Loma Nazarene University, Vanguard University and Westmont College as the charter members. California Baptist University and Concordia University joined the GSAC in the fall of the following year (1987). Cal Lutheran left the GSAC after the spring of 1989. Biola University joined the GSAC in the fall of 1994. Hope International University and San Diego Christian College joined the GSAC in the fall of 1999. The Master's College, joined the GSAC in the fall of 2001. Lewis-Clark State College of Lewiston, Idaho joined the GSAC as an affiliate member for Men's and Women's Tennis in 2016. ===Recent years=== In recent years, the conference has seen changes with members leaving the GSAC and the NAIA for the NCAA. In 2011 Cal Baptist left the GSAC to join the Pacific West Conference followed by the announcement that Azusa Pacific, Fresno Pacific and Point Loma Nazarene joined Cal Baptist in the PacWest in 2012. Concordia then left to join the PacWest in 2015, and Biola applied to make the same move in 2017. To replace these schools, the GSAC has added Arizona Christian, Menlo and William Jessup. Life Pacific joined in 2017 and Ottawa (AZ) joined in 2018 to bring the GSAC to 10 members. ==Member schools== ===Current members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Institution !Location !Founded !Type !Enrollment !Nickname !Joined |- !Arizona Christian University |Phoenix, Arizona |1960 |Private (Christian) |820 |Firestorm |2012 |- !Hope International University |Fullerton, California |1928 |Private (Christian) |987 |Royals |1999 |- !|Life Pacific College |San Dimas, California |1923 |Private (Foursquare Gospel) |686 |Warriors |2017 |- ! |Santa Clarita, California |1927 |Private (Christian) |1,348 |Mustangs |2001 |- !Menlo College |Atherton, California |1927 |Private (Nonsectarian) |750 |Oaks |2015 |- !Ottawa University |Surprise, Arizona |2015 |Private (American Baptist) |750 |Spirit |2018 |- !San Diego Christian College |Santee, California |1970 |Private (Evangelical) |916 |Hawks |1999 |- !Vanguard University |Costa Mesa, California |1920 |Private (Assemblies of God) |1,923 |Lions |1986 |- !Westmont College |Santa Barbara, California |1937 |Private (Christian) |1,308 |Warriors |1986 |- !William Jessup University |Rocklin, California |1939 |Private (Christian) |1,200 |Warriors |2014 |} ===Former members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Institution !Location !Founded !Nickname !Joined !Left !Current Conference |- !Azusa Pacific University |Azusa, California |1899 |Cougars |1986 |2012 |Pacific West (NCAA D-II) |- !Biola University |La Mirada, California |1908 |Eagles |1994 |2017 |Pacific West (NCAA D-II) |- !California Baptist University |Riverside, California |1950 |Lancers |1987 |2011 |Western Athletic (NCAA D-I) |- !California Lutheran University |Thousand Oaks, California |1959 |Kingsmen & Regals |1986 |1989 |Southern California (NCAA D-III) |- !Concordia University\u2013Irvine |Irvine, California |1976 |Eagles |1987 |2015 |Pacific West (NCAA D-II) |- !Fresno Pacific University |Fresno, California |1944 |Sunbirds |1986 |2012 |Pacific West (NCAA D-II) |- !Point Loma Nazarene University |San Diego, California |1902 |Sea Lions |1986 |2012 |Pacific West (NCAA D-II) |} ===Membership timeline=== DateFormat = yyyy ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 Period = from:1986 till:2018 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal PlotArea = right:5 left:5 bottom:50 top:5 Colors = id:line value:black id:Full value:rgb(0.7,0.9,0.8) # all sports id:FullxF value:rgb(0.9,0.8,0.7) # non-football id:AssocF value:rgb(0.9,0.7,0.8) # football-only PlotData = width:15 textcolor:darkblue shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s bar:1 color:FullxF from:1986 till:2012 text:Azusa Pacific (1986\u20132012) bar:2 color:FullxF from:1986 till:1989 text:California Lutheran (1986\u20131989) bar:3 color:FullxF from:1986 till:2012 text:Fresno Pacific (1986\u20132012) bar:4 color:FullxF from:1986 till:2012 text:Point Loma Nazarene (1986\u20132012) bar:5 color:FullxF from:1986 till:end text:Vanguard (1986\u2013present) bar:6 color:FullxF from:1986 till:end text:Westmont College (1986\u2013present) bar:7 color:FullxF from:1987 till:2011 text:California Baptist (1987\u20132011) bar:8 color:FullxF from:1987 till:2015 text:Concordia\u2013Irvine (1987\u20132015) bar:9 color:FullxF from:1994 till:2017 text:Biola (1994\u20132017) bar:10 color:FullxF from:1999 till:end text:Hope International (1999\u2013present) bar:11 color:FullxF from:1999 till:end text:San Diego Christian College (1999\u2013present) bar:12 color:FullxF from:2001 till:end text:The Master's University (2001\u2013present) bar:13 shift:(-5) color:FullxF from:2012 till:end text:Arizona Christian (2012\u2013present) bar:14 shift:(-45) color:FullxF from:2014 till:end text:William Jessup (2014\u2013present) bar:15 shift:(-65) color:FullxF from:2015 till:end text:Menlo College (2015\u2013present) bar:16 shift:(-65) color:FullxF from:2017 till:end text:Life Pacific College (2017\u2013present) ScaleMajor = gridcolor:line unit:year increment:5 start:1987 TextData = fontsize:L textcolor:black pos:(0,25) tabs:(400-center) text:^\"Golden State Athletic Conference Membership History\" #> If the chart uses more than one bar color, add a legend by selecting the appropriate fields from the following three options (use only the colors that are used in the graphic.)
