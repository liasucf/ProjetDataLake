    "text": "As the Canadian province with the largest population, Ontario has a particularly prominent role in Canadian music. The provincial capital city of Toronto, Canada's largest municipality, is home to much of the English Canadian music industry and many individual musicians, and the most popular destination for musicians from other parts of Canada, besides French-Canadian musicians, looking to advance their careers. Hamilton, Ottawa, Kingston and Guelph have also been important centres for Canadian music. In classical music, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and the National Arts Centre Orchestra are two of the most renowned orchestras in the world. Many smaller Ontario cities have orchestras of their own as well. The Canadian Opera Company, also based in Toronto, is the country's largest and most influential producer of opera productions. Other institutions in the province include the Royal Conservatory of Music, MuchMusic, and concert venues such as Roy Thomson Hall, Massey Hall and the National Arts Centre. Record labels in the province include MapleMusic, DROG Records, Duke Street, Sonic Unyon, Three Gut, Zunior, Linus Entertainment, and the Canadian divisions of most major international labels. ==Ontario music organizations== *Central Ontario Musicians' Association *Country Music Association of Ontario *Folk Music Ontario *MusicOntario *Ontario Arts Council *Ontario Music Association *Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts *Toronto Musicians' Association *Toronto Symphony Orchestra *Ontario Music Festivals Association ==Music Festivals== *Rock on the River *Boots and Hearts Music Festival *Burlington's Sound of Music Festival *Goderich Celtic Roots Festival *Hamilton Supercrawl *Havelock Country Jamboree *Mariposa Folk Festival *Northern Lights Festival Bor\u00e9al *Ottawa Bluesfest *OVO Fest *Rock the Park ==Musicians== For a list of musicians and musical groups from Ontario, please see List of Ontario musicians. ==References== ",
