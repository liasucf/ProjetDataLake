The magazine featured decorating and collecting, food and entertaining, fashion and well-being, travel and shopping. Country Home provided ideas and inspiration for readers who live a country lifestyle, or aspire to create one, in city lofts, farmhouses, suburban colonials, getaway cottages or wherever else. Country Home, which was launched in 1984, was published 10 times a year and each issue had over 8.3 million readers. LuAnn Brandsen and Carol Sheehan served as the editors-in-chief of the magazine. On January 8, 2009, Meredith Corporation announced that the magazine would cease publication effective with the March 2009 issue. The company cited a poor advertising climate and noted that the closing was part of larger set of cost- cutting actions at the company. == See also == * Farm & Fireside, which was published under the title The Country Home in the 1930s. ==References== # Country Home mission statement, 2006 # Fall 2006 Mediamark Research Inc.
