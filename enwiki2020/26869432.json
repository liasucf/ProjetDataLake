Brito was born in Covilh\u00e3, Portugal, but is a naturalized citizen of France and was a France youth international having earned caps with the under-15 and under-16 teams. Dias recently switched allegiances to his birth country Portugal after joining up with the nation's under-20 team in 2010. Dias plays as an attacking midfielder and is the son of former S.C. Covilh\u00e3 player Quim Brito, as well as the nephew of former Portuguese international C\u00e9sar Brito. He made his professional debut on 7 April 2010 in a league match against Marseille. On 2 September 2010, Dias signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal with Sochaux until June 2013. == Career == === Early career === Dias was born on 7 January 1991 in Covilh\u00e3, Portugal. At the age of six months, his family moved to France after his father, Quim Brito, a football player, signed with FC 4 Rivi\u00e8res 70, an amateur club located in Dampierre-sur-Salon in the Franche-Comt\u00e9 region. Dias began his football career playing for 4 Rivi\u00e8res at the age of five in 1996. He spent seven years at the club and, in 2003, signed youth papers with professional club Sochaux. === Sochaux === Upon his arrival to the club, Dias was inserted into the club's youth academy. He quickly rose through the ranks of the academy and established himself as one of the club's top prospects in his age group alongside fellow midfielder Serdar G\u00fcrler, striker C\u00e9dric Bakambu, and goalkeeper Pierrick Cros. In the 2008\u201309 season, Dias began appearing with the club's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur. He made his amateur debut on 29 November 2008 in a league match against Colmar appearing as a substitute. Dias finished the campaign with eight appearances; seven of them as a substitute. During the 2009\u201310 season, Dias continued to developed with the club's reserve team in the fourth division. He appeared in 15 matches scoring six goals. Also during the season, Dias was a part of the Sochaux under-19 team that reached the final of the Coupe Gambardella, the country's prestigious youth cup competition. In the lead up to the final, he scored doubles against Toulouse and Nantes in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively. In the final match against Metz at the Stade de France, Sochaux were defeated 4\u20133 on penalties. Dias converted his penalty, however, early failed attempts by G\u00fcrler and Cl\u00e9ment Giraud dashed the team's hopes. It was later reported by the media that scouts of English club Tottenham Hotspur attended the game to watch Dias. Midway through the 2009\u201310 Ligue 1 season, Dias, alongside G\u00fcrler, began integrating with the first team after manager Francis Gillot announced his desire to give the club's youth talent an opportunity. On 7 April 2010, he made his professional debut in a league match against Marseille. Dias appeared as a substitute in the match and played 16 minutes in a 3\u20130 defeat. Two weeks later, he made another league appearance, again as a substitute in another 3\u20130 defeat, this time against Boulogne. Following the season, Dias spent the summer training with Portuguese Liga club Benfica. Benfica wanted the player to remain at the club, however, due to being under contract with Sochaux, he returned to France for pre-season training. On 2 September 2010, Dias signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal with Sochaux until June 2013. He was officially promoted to the senior team and assigned the number 28 shirt. Dias, however, still remains a fixture on the club's reserve team in the CFA having scored four goals in 10 appearances. His first professional appearance of the season came on 16 October in a 2\u20130 defeat to Montpellier. In January 2014, Dias was loaned out in Ligue 2 to AC Arles-Avignon, to gain more playing time. === International === Though Dias was born in Portugal, due to living in France since he was six months old, he acquired citizenship, thus making him eligible to represent both Portugal and France at international level. At the age of 14, Dias represented France at under-15 level. The following year, he was called up to the under-16 team by coach Francis Smerecki. Dias appeared in two friendly matches against Poland in March 2007. Between 2007\u20132010, Dias was not selected by Smerecki for international duty. In 2010, Dias announced his intent to represent Portugal at international level and confirmed his decision by declining the opportunity to attend a training camp for future France national under-21 players. He was later selected by the Portugal under-20 team. On 7 October 2010, Dias made his debut with the under-20 team in a friendly match against France. The following month, he was called up to the team against to participate in training sessions with the team preparing for the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup. == Career statistics == === Club === (Correct as of 14 December 2011) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"3\"|CupIncludes Coupe de France, Coupe de la Ligue, Troph\u00e9e des Champions !colspan=\"3\"|EuropeIncludes UEFA Supercup !colspan=\"3\"|Total |- !Apps !Goals !Assists !Apps !Goals !Assists !Apps !Goals !Assists !Apps !Goals !Assists |- |rowspan=\"4\" valign=\"center\"|Sochaux |2009\u201310 |2||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=3|\u2014||2||0||0 |- |2010\u201311 |3||0||0||1||0||0||colspan=3|\u2014||4||0||0 |- |2011\u201312 |2||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0||0 |- !colspan=\"1\"|Total !7!!0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!8!!0!!0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Career total |7||0||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||8||0||0 |} == Notes == == References == == External links == * Rafa\u00ebl Dias profile at fcsochaux.fr * * * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:French footballers Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Portuguese emigrants to France Category:FC Sochaux- Montb\u00e9liard players Category:AC Arles-Avignon players Category:Ligue 1 players Category:Ligue 2 players Category:France youth international footballers Category:Portugal youth international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:People from Covilh\u00e3 ",
