Fagnani was the daughter of Italian-born painter Giuseppe Fagnani, who had emigrated to the United States in the company of Sir Henry Bulwer when he came to take up his post as British ambassador in 1849. He later became an American citizen and married, in 1851, Harriet Emma Everett Goodwin of Charlestown, Massachusetts. The couple took up residence in New York City, where Nina was born. Her artistic studies took place in Paris, where she worked with the widow of William Wyld, as well as with one Mme. Grec.
