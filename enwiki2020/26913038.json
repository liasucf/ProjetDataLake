    "text": "Sideropenic hypochromic anemia is primarily characterized by low serum iron concentration. Non-sideropenic hypochromic anemia is the ineffective utilisation of iron stores, usually from chronic infection/inflammation. It is very important to distinguish iron deficit anemia from the anemia of chronic disorders so as to ensure specific treatment. ==Basic Features== 1- Red cell indices and blood film appearances suggest iron deficiency, although peripheral blood changes are not usually as marked as in moderate or severe iron deficiency. 2- Erythropoiesis is abnormal because of ineffective iron utilisation with poor haemoglobinisation of red cell precursors and 3- Bone marrow iron stores are normal or increased and sideroblasts may be frequent and abnormal. ==Causes== 1- Secondary anemias \\- Chronic infection/inflammation \\- Malignancy 2- Thalassaemia 3- Sideroblastic anaemia ==\"Differentiation from iron deficiency\"== The serum iron and total iron- binding capacity (transferrin) are helpful but not diagnostic; it is quite possible to have co-existing ineffective iron utilisation and iron deficiency, as determined by bone marrow iron status, e.g. in rheumatoid arthritis. ==References== 1- Aids to clinical haematology (eds; Child J.A. and Cuthbert A.C..
