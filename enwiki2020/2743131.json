    "text": "The Story of a Three-Day Pass (French title La Permission) is a black-and- white film written and directed, often in a French New Wave style, by Melvin Van Peebles, based on a novel he wrote in French, La Permission. Van Peebles also collaborated on the score with Mickey Baker and sings one of the two songs written for the film, \"When My Number Gonna Hit\". The other song, \"Hard Times\", is a man-woman duet; one of the singers is Mickey Baker. In 2020, the film was one of the selections of the Cannes Classics section at the Cannes Film Festival. ==Synopsis== The film tells the story of Turner (Harry Baird), a Black U.S. army man stationed in France whose captain gives him a three-day pass just after he promotes him. As Turner gets ready to leave, his reflection in the mirror accuses him of being an Uncle Tom, but this is not the only time his reflection criticizes him or makes him doubt himself. Turner goes to Paris, where he wanders mostly aimlessly for the first day. He finds himself in a nightclub, where he meets a white French shop clerk named Miriam (Nicole Berger). The pair spends the rest of the weekend together, enjoying their romance but also struggling with the complexities of racism. Eventually their miscegenation is reported to Turner's captain (Hal Brav) and Turner is restricted to barracks, where he decides that such amorous adventures are futile. ==Cast== Harry Baird as Turner Nicole Berger as Miriam Hal Brav as Turner's captain ==Distribution== The movie is currently distributed through Xenon Pictures. ==References== == External links == * * * La Permission EP info from Blaxploitation.com Category:1967 films Category:French black-and- white films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on French novels Category:Films directed by Melvin Van Peebles Category:French independent films Category:Films about race and ethnicity Category:1960s romantic drama films Category:Films about interracial romance Category:French films Category:1967 directorial debut films Category:1967 drama films Category:1968 drama films ",
