    "text": "Dance Me This is a studio album by Frank Zappa, released posthumously in June 2015 by The Zappa Family Trust on Zappa Records and 100th overall. This is the last album Frank Zappa completed before his death in 1993. ==Overview== In the liner notes, Todd Yvega comments, \"It is remarkable that Frank was able to construct such a cohesive arc, juxtaposing and superimposing such disparate materials, some of which had been in the works for years, while others were the fruit of the previous week's happenstance. Thrown into the creative mix were the incidentals (it was FZ's bent to be open to changing course and making use of whatever happens along). Earlier that year, the Zappas were graced with a visit from a trio of throat singers from Tuva in southern Siberia who were on a US concert tour. Naturally a recording session ensued, and the Tuvans' vocals ultimately became prominent on several tracks. Dweezil had set up his guitar rig in the studio, and Frank decided to take it for a spin overdubbing on the piece we were tracking that day. As far as we know, that was the last time he played guitar.\" ==Track listing== All songs produced, composed and realized by Frank Zappa, except where noted. http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi- bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=2&ti;=1,2&Search;_Arg=PAu001959058&Search;_Code=REGS&PID;=3o0mT2gFJtFkUFlbfmcSvnn90Qfzg&CNT;=25 == Personnel == * Frank Zappa \u2013 Synclavier realization, guitar * Anatolii Kuular, Kaigl-Ool Khovalyg, Kongar-ol Ondar \u2013 vocals * Todd Yvega \u2013 algorithm and Synclavier assistance == Sources == * 1993 1630 Digital Master 44.1K 16-bit == References == Category:Frank Zappa albums Category:2015 albums Category:Albums published posthumously ",
