    "text": "Big West Conference women's volleyball is an American collegiate volleyball conference. It includes 10-12 women's teams from various colleges and universities. Before the 2017\u201318 school year, the Big West sponsored volleyball only for women, but the conference added a men's volleyball league in that school year. (NCAA women's volleyball is a fall sport, while NCAA men's volleyball is a spring sport.) In 2012, Beach Volleyball began as a recognized collegiate sport. By 2016 this conference officially began play as one of the firsts in the nation. == History == Through 2010, Big West volleyball teams had earned a combined 22 NCAA final four appearances among four teams. In 1981, pre-shuffling SDSU, two BWC stalwarts were able to make the contemporaneous representation. The San Diego State University Aztecs became the first Big West program to reach the final four. University of the Pacific also reached the post-1981 final four. University of Hawaii (UHM) was the Big West's first national champion in 1982. In 1998 California State University, Long Beach (CSULB) dominated the NCAA in a 36-0 season (the first to do so). At the turn of the 21st century, only UH and CSULB have been able to reach the final four\u2014a total of five thus-far seasons. In 2012, former WAC member UHM joined Big West play for the first time since 1995. They won the regular season in 1995 and in 2012. BWC Schools' histories by annals would show competitive edges in B1G and PAC12 head-to-head duels. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo became a perennial Beach Top 10 performer, with HC Todd Rogers. As of 2018 the BWC is the only NCAA conference to sponsor an official pairs bracket following the awarding of a Team Championship. The 2018 winners as posted in the finals bracket were: T. Van Winden/Miric (CPSU) defeated Barber/Karelov (LBSU), 2-1. In 2019, the winning and dominant pair of Crissy Jones/Miric (CPSLO) were recognized as The BWC pair.
