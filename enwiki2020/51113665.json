    "text": "Nava Nalanda Mahavihara is located in Nalanda, Bihar, India. It was established in 1951 under Rajendra Prasad to revive the ancient seat of learning in Nalanda. It became a Deemed university in 2006. Nava Nalanda Mahavihara was founded to develop as a centre of higher studies in Pali and Buddhism along the lines of ancient Nalanda Mahavihara. From the beginning, the Institute functioned as a residential institution, with a limited number of Indian and foreign students. In 2006, the Indian University Grants Commission accorded the Nava Nalanda Mahavihara the status of a \"Deemed to be University.\" The present campus of the Mahavihara is some 100 km from the metropolis of Patna, situated on the southern bank of the historical lake Indrapuskarani. Close to the northern bank lie the ruins of the ancient University of Nalanda. == Disambiguation == Nava Nalanda Mahavihara, founded in 1951, is not to be confused with Nalanda University, that opened in 2014. == References == ==External links== * Category:Universities and colleges in Bihar Category:Education in Nalanda district Category:Nalanda Category:Deemed universities in India Category:Educational institutions established in 1951 Category:1951 establishments in India Category:Buddhist universities and colleges ",
