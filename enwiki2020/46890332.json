It is an album of Boris Vian-penned songs recorded by Higelin and released on an EP in January 1966 and on an LP shared with Marie-Jos\u00e9 Casanova, also released in 1966. The nine Brigitte Fontaine songs come from her first album, 13 chansons d\u00e9cadentes et fantasmagoriques. Contrary to the first release co-billed to both artists, 1966's 12 chansons d'avant le d\u00e9luge, none of the songs are duets. The Fontaine songs were only added to fill in because the Higelin songs were not enough to make an LP. == Track listing == Category:1976 albums Category:Brigitte Fontaine albums ",
