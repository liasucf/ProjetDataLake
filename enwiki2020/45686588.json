    "text": "Paul McBeth (born July 9, 1990) is an American professional disc golfer from Huntington Beach, California. He won the PDGA World Championships four times in a row (2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015) and again in 2019 making him a five time champion. McBeth was the top ranked player of the PDGA in 2015, 2017, 2018, and again in 2019. McBeth turned pro in 2008. His career earnings are $484,105.09 (as of April 2020). He proposed to Hannah Croke in April 2017, and married her in December 2018. == Professional career == Although he played his first professional event in 2006, McBeth's professional career began in 2008, when he played in 29 professional events, netting $11,852.50 in winnings and earning the PDGA Male Rookie of the Year Award. Along with his five World titles, McBeth has received the PDGA Male Player of the year three times (2013, 2014, 2015). On October 8, 2019 McBeth held a PDGA rating of 1060 which, at the time, was the highest rating ever achieved by a professional disc golfer. This was exceeded on March 13th, 2020, when he was rated 1061. ===2015 season=== McBeth dominated the 2015 season, winning 19 of 25 events by an average of almost 6 strokes and finishing in the top 3 in every event. He won all five Major events, disc golf's first Grand Slam, including his fourth World title and his first ever win at the USDGC, making him only the third man to win both the World and US titles in the same year (after Ken Climo and Barry Schultz). McBeth also took home three NT wins and earned enough points to win the National Tour for the fourth straight year. ===2016 season=== 2016 started off looking like a continuation of McBeth's commanding 2015 season. After winning a B-Tier event in California, McBeth won the Memorial Championship (NT), followed by the La Mirada Open, the first event of the Disc Golf World Tour (DGWT). At the Nick Hyde Memorial (A-Tier), McBeth lost in a sudden death playoff with Nate Sexton and Simon Lizotte, who went on to win the event. Over the next three events, McBeth lost the Glass Blown Open (NT) by one stroke to Cam Todd, the Konopiste Open (DGWT) in a playoff to Lizotte, and the Masters Cup by one stroke to Ricky Wysocki on a 70-foot putt. Citing knee pain as the reason for his falling putting percentage, McBeth switched to a straddle stance for the European Open (DGWT), an event he hasn\u2019t lost since 2011. The switch was effective, and McBeth bested Wysocki by two strokes to win the event. Back home in the United States, however, McBeth's struggles continued. He placed 3rd in the Beaver State Fling (NT), and then tied for 12th place in the Vibram Open (NT), his lowest finish in three years. After another one stroke loss to Wysocki at the European Masters (DGWT), McBeth took another 12th-place finish at the Majestic. Wysocki continued his incredible season with his first World title, beating McBeth by 6 strokes and ending his 4-year winning streak. Feeling healthy and his form back in check, McBeth took a commanding 12 stroke win at the Ledgestone Insurance Open the next week, followed by an 11 stroke victory at the Brent Hambrick Memorial Open (NT). McBeth finished the National Tour in second place behind Wysocki, ending another 4-year streak. At the end of the inaugural Disc Golf Pro Tour, McBeth placed 4th in the Green Mountain Championship, resulting in a 5th-place finish in the points standings and an automatic berth into the Tour Championship semifinals, which he would go on to win. McBeth donated his $10,000 winnings from the Tour Championship to help pay his cousin's medical bills, who was injured in an accident. The 2016 season ended on a low note for McBeth: he finished in 20th place at the USDGC, shooting 2 over par after 3 rounds (the final round was cancelled due to Hurricane Matthew). Additionally, a scoring error in round 3 resulted in a two stroke penalty. Without the two stroke error, McBeth would have finished in 14th place, earning enough points to win the inaugural Disc Golf World Tour, but he instead took second place to Wysocki by just 75 points. ===2017 season=== McBeth entered a total of 24 tournaments https://www.pdga.com/player/27523/stats/2017 in 2017, winning 9 of them, and placing 2nd or 3rd in 12 others. His only major win of the season came at the European Open in Nokia, Finland, where he bested Gregg Barsby by only one stroke. For the second consecutive year, he finished runner-up to Ricky Wysocki in the 2017 PDGA Professional Disc Golf World Championships.https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/30813#MPO McBeth's hottest streak of the season came during the spring months of March through May, where he won 5 of the 7 tournaments he entered and placed 2nd in the other two. Notable tournaments won during this streak were the DGPT Memorial Championship,DGPT Memorial Championship the Nick Hyde Memorial,Nick Hyde Memorial the Glass Blown Open,Glass Blown Open and the Masters Cup presented by Innova Disc Golf.Masters Cup presented by Innova Disc Golf He notably had to withdraw from a significant tournament, Discraft's Green Mountain Championship,Discraft's Green Mountain Championship citing back pain. After posting a very un-McBeth-like 5-over par through only 13 holes during round 2, he decided to withdraw rather than face a prolonged injury. \u201cYeah, I hurt [my back] yesterday but didn\u2019t know how bad until today,\u201d McBeth said in a text message. \u201cCouldn\u2019t throw well so tried to play it out but it got too painful. Different spot [than my previous back injury] so I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s not too bad. If it was the final day probably would have tried to finish it. Way too much golf left to push it with USDGC next.\u201d https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/livewire/mcbeth-withdraws-green-mountain- championship/ He would end up finishing 3rd in the USDGC Championship three weeks later. For the season, he pocketed $69,411.25 in winnings, including a $10,000 payout for winning the PDGA National Tour Elite Series.https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/34054#MPO ===2018 season=== Paul McBeth's 2018 campaign was very similar to 2017, in terms of the number of tournaments he entered and won. Out of his 25 tournament appearances, McBeth notched 9 wins and finished 2nd or 3rd in 9 others. His only major win of the year was the USDGC Championship on the Winthrop University Gold Course in Rock Hill, South Carolina. It was his 2nd USDGC victory (previous win was in 2015). McBeth got off to a blistering start, jumping out to a 7-stroke lead over James Conrad after two rounds. Conrad would eventually close the gap and tie McBeth after he cooled off over the final two rounds,https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/35746#MPO but McBeth prevailed with a -34 to Conrad's -31. Relative newcomer Kevin Jones, who came within one stroke of tying McBeth on the back nine, eventually finished 3rd, four strokes back.https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/35746 This tournament was also notable for the fact that it featured live online coverage with Paul McBeth's wife Hannah providing on-course commentary. On July 7, 2018 he had a historic round when he recorded a score of 18 under par (in 18 holes) during the second round on the Toboggan Course at the Great Lakes Open (McBeth would cruise to victory in the tournament).https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/34230#MPO It was called \"Near Perfect\" and the round was featured on ESPN's SportsCenter. Disc Golf video specialists Jomez Pro commemorated the round with this video. In all, McBeth finished with $57,880.00 for the season. His other important tournament victories in 2018 included the Nick Hyde Memorial,https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/34492#MPO the inaugural San Francisco Open,https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/34183#MPO the Delaware Disc Golf Challenge,https://www.pdga.com/tour/event/33793#MPO and The Ed Headrick Disc Golf Hall of Fame Classic (National Tour Finale).https://www.pdga.com/tags/2018-ed-headrick-disc-golf-hall-fame-classic Near the end of 2018 McBeth signed a 4 year deal with Discraft. == Professional wins (111 total) == McBeth has a total of 111 wins, including 5 World Championships, 11 Majors, and 20 National Tour events. He won the PDGA National Tour in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017 and won the Disc Golf Pro Tour Championship in 2016. === PDGA Pro World Championships (5) === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Location
