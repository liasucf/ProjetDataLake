Kiraly brought Drews into Team USA's summer-long camp in Anaheim, California. When Drews joined the team, she was already behind many of the players who had been in the Team USA gym since May 1 as the Puerto Rican league playoffs went through mid-May. Drews debuted for the United States national team later that year. Used primarily as the opposite in the double- sub with just two match starts, Drews led Team USA in scoring in three (against Columbia, Mexico and Argentina) of its first five matches in its gold medal run at the 2017 Women's Pan-American Volleyball Cup in June. ===== 2017 USA Volleyball Cup ===== Drews led Team USA past fourth-ranked Brazil with a 21-point performance to open the 2017 USA Volleyball Cup in Anaheim on a Sunday evening. Drews powered down 16 kills on 38 swings against Brazil while adding four blocks and an ace over the course of the four sets, with final set a bonus set after the Americans won the first three sets 25\u201321, 25\u201314, 29\u201327. However, in the official three sets of the match, Drews was her most dominant having 14 kills on 26 attacks with just three errors to go with three blocks and an ace. And she was able to have such a break-out match on American soil with her family in the stands watching. > \u201cI think it has been awesome,\u201d Drews said immediately after the Brazil > match. \u201cThe longer I get into my career, the more moments like this will > stand out when we do get to play on American soil and have our families > here. USA has been awesome about having our families able to come to > practice and they are here tonight.\u201d =====2017 FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix===== Kiraly left Drews in Anaheim for the first rounds of the 2017 FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix. Drews took advantage of being one of only two opposites in the two- and three-hour sessions in the gym back in Orange County. > \u201cWhen you only have two (opposites), you\u2019re getting a ton, a ton of > touches,\u201d Drews said. \u201cThere are some benefits to being in the home group > when the team is traveling because you get so many reps. I think being so > new to this system I really wanted to take advantage of those reps and see > if I could get a lot better.\u201d The extra work paid off with a spot on the U.S. roster for the 2017 FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix finals round. Although the U.S. did not win either of its Finals Round matches against Serbia and Italy, Drews came off the bench in both contests to provide a huge spark.

In its win over Korea, 25\u201322, 25\u201320, 25\u201316, Drews contributed 11 points on eight kills, two blocks and an ace. She helped USA claim the bronze medal for the tournament. ==== 2018 ==== ===== 2018 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League ===== In 2018, Drews joined the U.S. team in the inaugural 2018 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League where they eventually won gold against Turkey (25-17, 22\u201325, 28\u201326, 15\u201325, 7-15). ==== 2019 ==== =====2019 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League===== Drews at the 2019 Nations League Drews returned for another round of duty for the U.S. team in the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League.

The Americans extended the advantage to three at 8\u20135 with a Drews kill, Robinson ace and Larson kill. Brazil closed to one at 10\u20139. Team USA went up 13\u201310 with kills from Drews and Haleigh Washington. Brazil saved two match points at 14\u201313. In a bold move, Coach Karch Kiraly called for a video challenge for net touch during the middle of match point and Team USA won the points as the video clearly showed Brazil touching the net antenna. After the win, Kiraly did not spare kind words for the tournament MVP Andrea Drews after the match > \u201cWow, Annie. I don\u2019t know how many points she had, but she was huge. > Everyone was huge. What a great team win, fall down 2-0 against one of the > greatest teams in the world, Brazil.
