The tour was announced on November 5, 2014, as well as The Pretty Reckless, Pop Evil, and Lifehouse as the support act for the majority of the shows in North American while Monster Truck will be the support act in Australia and Europe (2016). The second North American leg of the tour had to be canceled when lead vocalist Chad Kroeger required surgery for a cyst on his voice box. The entire leg of the European tour was postponed until Autumn 2016. ==Set list== Some songs not performed at every show #\"Million Miles an Hour\" #\"Something in Your Mouth\" #\"Photograph\" #\"Hero\" #\"What Are You Waiting For?\" or \"Gotta Be Somebody\" #\"Far Away\" #\"Edge of a Revolution\" #\"Master of Puppets\"/\"Walk\" (Metallica, Pantera covers) #\"Too Bad\" #\"Someday\" #\"Animals\" #\"Moby Dick\" (Led Zeppelin cover, drum solo) #\"She Keeps Me Up\" #\"Take It Easy\"/\"Hotel California\" (Eagles covers) #\"Summer of '69\" (Bryan Adams cover) #\"Rockstar\" #\"When We Stand Together\" #\"Figured You Out\" #\"How You Remind Me\" ;Encore # * \"Everlong\" (Foo Fighters cover) # * \"Burn It to the Ground\" Songs performed in Saskatoon *\"Blow at High Dough\" (The Tragically Hip cover) *\"Don't Stop Believin'\" (Journey cover) ==Tour dates== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Date ! style=\"width:150px;\"| City ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Country ! style=\"width:250px;\"| Venue ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Opening act(s) ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Attendance ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Gross revenue |- ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| North America |- |February 14, 2015 |Allentown |United States |PPL Center |rowspan=\"22\"|The Pretty Reckless Pop Evil Lifehouse | | |- |February 18, 2015 |Montreal |rowspan=\"3\"|Canada |Bell Centre |9,874 / 11,616 |$600,835 |- |February 21, 2015 |London |Budweiser Gardens |7,688 / 8,679 |$523,544 |- |February 22, 2015 |Toronto |Air Canada Centre |10,093 / 10,093 |$524,916 |- |February 24, 2015 |Grand Rapids |rowspan=\"6\"|United States |Van Andel Arena | | |- |February 25, 2015 |Louisville |KFC Yum!

The only production used in the show were a video screen, simple stage, restrained lighting and a set list filled with mostly ballads and covers. Begrand also felt like the covers were a cheap attempt to receive applause more than they would with their own songs. He did give praise to the performances of \"Animals\" and \"She Keeps Me Up\". ==References== Category:2015 concert tours Category:2016 concert tours Category:Nickelback concert tours ",
