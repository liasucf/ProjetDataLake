He was then elected to Humberside County Council in 1973, becoming the Leader of the Conservative Group and shadow Chairman of the Policy Committee. He also became a member of the Conservative National Advisory Committee on local Government. He subsequently became Leader of the county council, Chairman of its Policy Committee, and member of the Policy Committee of the Association of County Councils, 1977.Dod's Parliamentary Companion 1991, p.587. At the 1979 general election Townend was elected as the Conservative Party Member of Parliament for Bridlington, East Riding of Yorkshire, a seat which he held until his retirement in 2001. He served as Secretary of the Conservative Back-bench Finance Committee and was a member of the Select Committee on Treasury and Civil Service affairs and Vice-Chairman of the Back-bench Finance Committee. He was also Principle Private Secretary to Hugh Rossi, the Minister of Pensions and the Disabled. He became Chairman of the Small Businesses Committee, a Fellow of the Industry and Parliament Trust, and a member of the Executive Committee of IPU. His main interests while in Parliament were Treasury and taxation, small businesses, employment, and Southern Africa. ==Immigration controversies== Townend was renowned for his controversial and outspoken views on race and immigration, which caused some consternation. In 1984, he suggested that foreigners employed in industries should be replaced by unemployed Britons, and in 1989 he stated that \"England must be reconquered for the English. They (Muslims opposed to Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses) should go back from whence they came.\"The Guardian, 29 August 1989. In 2001, shortly before his retirement as an MP, he became engulfed in a row within the Tory Party when, referring to a statement by Robin Cook that there was no such thing as a British race, he said that his constituents in Bridlington would not agree, and asked whether Labour's Robin Cook therefore thought instead that the British were a \"mongrel race\". He was chairman of the right-wing 92 Group. ==References== == External links == * Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:People educated at Hymers College Category:Politicians from Kingston upon Hull Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983 Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992 Category:UK MPs 1992\u20131997 Category:UK MPs 1997\u20132001 Category:1934 births Category:2018 deaths ",
