    "text": "The MGM-29 Sergeant was an American short-range, solid fuel, surface-to- surface missile developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The missiles were built by Sperry Utah Company. The Sergeant was the third and last in a series of JPL rockets for the US Army whose names correspond to the progression in Army enlisted ranks, starting with Private and Corporal. ==Development== The Sergeant was originated during 1948 at JPL Due to the large workload of the Corporal program rocket motor development for the Sergeant was transferred to the Redstone Division of the Thiokol Corporation.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 11, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 Due to the failure of the Sergeant program to develop rapidly the early Sergeant was terminated in April 1951.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 15, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 Another Army missile program, the Hermes program had developed the Hermes A2 another solid fueled missile.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 14, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 The Hermes RV-A-10 (A2) was successful but not pursued with the motor serving as the inspiration for future solid rocket motors.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 15, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 JPL, cautioned against making Sergeant a \u201ccrash\u201d program as with Corporal.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 32, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 Sergeant missile development began January 1955.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 36, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 There were three basic steps planned: feasibility demonstration in 1955-1957, experimental development in 1958 and 1959, followed by final engineering in 1960 and 1961.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 97, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 The rocket motor was designed by JPL and built by Thiokol. Picatinny Arsenal was to supply the warhead and adapter.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 113-117, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 Ground Support equipment and vehicles were to be the responsibility of JPL.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 120, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 By fall 1956 it was decided to defer procurement of the Corporal III to development of the much more practical Sergeant.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 130, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 Flight tests began in early 1956 resulting in significant design changes,Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 109-111, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 By July 1961 the Sergeant weapon system had numerous deficiencies including check out, repair ease, standby readiness, reliability and low temperature storage limits. Sergeant was to be ready on time but fell miserably short of meeting the goal of being the weapon originally envisioned.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 199, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 When compared to the Corporal it was to replace the Sergeant required less than 1/3rd of the ground support equipment, could be fired within minutes rather than hours after arriving at the firing location. And it was immune to enemy countermeasures. Sergeant was relatively simple to operate and maintain.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 202, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 The Sergeant was to carry the W52 (M65) nuclear warhead.Hansen, Chuck, \u201cThe Swords of Armageddon U.S. Nuclear Weapons Development since 1945,\u201d Volume VII, p 125-126, 1995 The Sergeant had been considered for deployment with high explosive, fragmentation, biological and chemical warheads. A biological warhead, the M210 and a chemical warhead, the M212 were approved but never procured.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 234, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 ==In Service== Activated by the US Army in 1962 to replace the MGM-5 Corporal, it was deployed in Europe and South Korea by 1963, and to German units by 1964.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 216, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 The Sergeant weapon system was to be replaced by the MGM-52 Lance in the early 1970s but delays in the Lance caused it to remain in service.Cagle, Mary T., History of the Sergeant Weapon System, p 244, U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 The last US Army battalion was deactivated in 1977.Kennedy, Gregory P., The Rockets and Missiles of WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS 1945-1958, p 151, Schiffer Military History, Atglen, PA, 2009 Sergeant Missile Systems were usually assigned to the field army with the mission of \"general support to a corps\" Operation of the Sergeant was recognized to be an interim stage in the development of battlefield missiles. It avoided the Corporal's liquid-fuel-handling drawbacks, but still requiring extensive setup and checkout before launch, together with a train of semi-trailer support vehicles. More advanced missiles, such as the contemporary Blue Water and later Lance, would reduce setup time. The Sergeant had a takeoff thrust of , a takeoff weight of , a diameter of , a length of and a fin span of . The Sergeant missile had a minimum range of , and a maximum range of . Thiokol developed the Sergeant rocket motors\u2014and the Castor rocket stages derived from them\u2014at the Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville, Alabama. ===Derivatives=== Sergeant's solid fuel motor became part of multistage rocket designs, including use (as the \"Baby Sargeant\") in the second, third, and fourth stages of the Juno I launch vehicle, which was used to launch the first United States satellite, Explorer 1. The Castor rocket stage, a Sergeant derivative, was used as the second stage of the Scout satellite launcher. Clusters of Sergeant-derived rockets were used in the second and third stages of the Jupiter-C sounding rocket and used in the second, third, and fourth stages of the Juno I and Juno II launch vehicles. ==Operators== http://www.usarmygermany.com/Units/FieldArtillery/Org%20Charts_Sergeant%201.htm German Army *150th Rocket Artillery Battalion (1964\u20131976) *250th Rocket Artillery Battalion (1964\u20131976) *350th Rocket Artillery Battalion (1964\u20131976) *650th Rocket Artillery Battalion (1965\u20131976) http://www.usarmygermany.com/Units/FieldArtillery/Org%20Charts_Sergeant.htm United States Army *5th Battalion, 30th Field Artillery Regiment 1963\u20131975 \u2013 Vicenza, Italy *3rd Battalion, 38th Field Artillery Regiment (1962\u2013?) \u2013 Fort Sill *1st Battalion, 68th Field Artillery Regiment (1964\u20131970) \u2013 West Germany *5th Battalion, 73rd Field Artillery Regiment (1963\u20131975) \u2013 West Germany *5th Battalion, 77th Field Artillery Regiment (1963\u20131975) \u2013 West Germany *3rd Battalion, 80th Field Artillery Regiment (1964\u20131970) \u2013 West Germany *3rd Battalion, 81st Field Artillery Regiment (1963\u20131976)https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve12/d289 \u2013 South Korea == References == ==External links== * https://web.archive.org/web/20050209212910/http://astronautix.com/lvs/sergeant.htm * http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/app1/ssm-a-16.html * https://history.redstone.army.mil/miss-sergeant.html == References == * Cagle, Mary T., Gary, B., \u201cHistory of the Sergeant Weapon U.S. Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1972 * Hansen, Chuck, \u201cThe Swords of Armageddon U.S. Nuclear Weapons Development since 1945, Volume VII, Chukelea Publications, Sunnyvale, CA, 1995 * Kennedy, Gregory P., \u201cThe Rockets and Missiles of White Sands Proving Ground 1945-1958, Schiffer Publishing Ltd., Altglen, PA,, 2009 Category:Cold War nuclear missiles of the United States Category:Surface-to-surface missiles of the United States MGM-029 ",
