He played college football at Oregon and was drafted by the San Diego Chargers in the second round of the 2004 NFL Draft. He also played for the Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins. ==Early years== Olshansky was born in the industrial city of Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine, Soviet Union. His father Yury had played basketball for the Red Army. Shortly before the break-up of the Soviet Union, he and his family moved to San Francisco in 1989, when he was seven years old. His maternal grandfather, Abraham Rubshevsky, fought in World War II for the Red Army, and was injured 11 times. Olshansky is Jewish and he acknowledged that, \"It's who I am; my culture; my roots\". During his youth he attended the Lisa Kampner Hebrew Academy in San Francisco, headed by Rabbi Pinchos Lipner, an Orthodox Jewish day school. He then attended St. Ignatius College Preparatory on a basketball scholarship, and \u2013 already 6' 5\" in the 10th grade \u2013 played basketball for the school until his junior year, while concurrently playing basketball in the Maccabiah Games in St. Louis and Milwaukee. After two years, he also began playing football in his junior year in high school. ==College career== At the University of Oregon, where he majored in psychology, Olshansky was honorable mention academic All-Pac-10 in his freshman year, and picked for Sports Illustrateds All-Bowl Game team at the end of the season. He was honorable mention All-Pac-10 as a sophomore, second-team All-Pac-10 as a junior, and recipient of the Joe Schaffeld Trophy as the Ducks' top defensive lineman after both his sophomore and junior seasons. He was used at all defensive line positions. In his career at Oregon he had 146 tackles (89 solos), 11.5 sacks, 3 blocked kicks, and one 37-yard interception return in 38 games. Olshansky left school following his junior season, with one year of eligibility remaining. He set a team record with a 505-pound bench press, and also holds team records in the clean and jerk and squat. ==Professional career== ===2004 NFL Combine=== In early try-outs for the draft, he bench- pressed 102.1 kilograms (225 lbs) 41 times on one try, two presses short of the rookie record. He ran the 40-yard dash in 4.9 seconds and jumped 33.5 inches from a stationary position. A National Football Conference scouting director observed: \"He can play both end and tackle, he can control the point and rush the passer, he's a very good athlete.\" ===San Diego Chargers=== In the second round (35th overall) of the 2004 NFL Draft, the San Diego Chargers selected Olshansky out of the University of Oregon. In August 2004, Olshansky and the Chargers agreed on a 6-year contract, with the final year being voidable. The contract called for a $2.25 million signing bonus and had a value of $5.2 million over five years, through the 2008 NFL season. He became the NFL's first Soviet-born player. In his rookie season in 2004, he started all 16 of the team's games. Olshansky was ejected from a game against the Denver Broncos on 19 November 2006. He punched Broncos center Tom Nalen after what appeared to be Nalen trying to cut block Olshansky on a clock-stopping spike play. Olshansky had recently had knee surgery when Nalen went after Olshansky's knees. Two days later, the NFL fined Nalen $25,000 for the cut block, more than double the $10,000 fine Olshansky received for the punch.Kevin Acee, \"Olshansky-Nalen incident in back of Chargers' minds\", The San Diego Union-Tribune, 5 December 2006. With the Chargers, he had 151 tackles and 11 sacks in 75 games, starting all but 5 of them. ===Dallas Cowboys=== Olshansky signed a four-year contract with the Dallas Cowboys on 6 March 2009.
