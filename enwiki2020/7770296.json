It was their last top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, reaching #10; it peaked at #2 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. In the UK Singles Chart it fared even better, spending three weeks at the top in August 1974. There was a lovers rock version of the song issued on Trojan records in 1976, credited to the Fabulous Five Inc (aka Fab Five Inc), that scored well in Jamaica and in the United Kingdom. === Track listings === ; 7\" single # \"Love Me for a Reason\" \u2014 4:02 # \"Fever\" \u2014 3:15 === Charts and sales === ==== Weekly charts ==== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1974) !Peak position |- |Belgian Singles Chart (Flanders) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|26 |- |Canada RPM Top Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|18 |- |Canada Adult Contemporary | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |Dutch Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|19 |- |German Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|39 |- |Irish Singles ChartIrish Single Chart Irishcharts.ie (Retrieved August 25, 2008) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |UK Singles ChartUK Singles Chart Official Charts Company (Retrieved August 1, 2008) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|10 |- |US Billboard Easy ListeningBillboard [ allmusic.com] (Retrieved August 25, 2008) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|8 |} ==== Year-end charts ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1974) ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Rank |- |Canada RPM Top Singles Bac-lac.gc.ca | style=\"text- align:center;\"|134 |- |UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|12 |- |US (Joel Whitburn's Pop Annual) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|103 |} ==== Certifications ==== == Boyzone version == The song was revived by Boyzone in 1994, becoming their breakthrough single in the UK, reaching #2 on the UK singles chart in December that year.
