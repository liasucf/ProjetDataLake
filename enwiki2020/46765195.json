She begins to lose trust in all those around her, and it starts to become clear that those around her are determined to keep her from recovering her memories that she pursues.http://www.titletrakk.com/book-reviews/kiss- review-dekker.htm ==Critical reception== Belinda Elliott of The Christian Broadcasting Network describes the novel. \\- \"Kiss moves along at a steady pace. The convincing characters pull the reader in, and the plot twists keep them turning pages to see what happens next. As with most Dekker novels, the spiritual themes are subtle. Readers will find no sermons here. But the story does offer a poignant look at the purpose of suffering and pain in our lives. Is it necessary to experience one (and live with the memories of it) in order to enjoy the other? The novel allows readers to decide.\"http://www.cbn.com/entertainment/books/ElliottB_Kiss.aspx ==References== Category:2009 American novels Category:American Christian novels Category:American thriller novels Category:Novels by Ted Dekker ",
