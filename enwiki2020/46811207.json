    "text": "A nonsteroidal estrogen is an estrogen with a nonsteroidal chemical structure. The most well-known example is the stilbestrol estrogen diethylstilbestrol (DES). Although nonsteroidal estrogens formerly had an important place in medicine, they have gradually fallen out of favor following the discovery of toxicities associated with high-dose DES starting in the early 1970s, and are now almost never used. On the other hand, virtually all selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are nonsteroidal, with triphenylethylenes like tamoxifen and clomifene having been derived from DES, and these drugs remain widely used in medicine for the treatment of breast cancer among other indications. In addition to pharmaceutical drugs, many xenoestrogens, including phytoestrogens, mycoestrogens, and synthetic endocrine disruptors like bisphenol A, are nonsteroidal substances with estrogenic activity. ==Pharmacology== Nonsteroidal estrogens act as agonists of the estrogen receptors, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2. ==List of nonsteroidal estrogens== ===Synthetic=== ====Pharmaceutical==== * Stilbestrols: benzestrol, bifluranol, dienestrol, diethylstilbestrol, dimestrol, fosfestrol, furostilbestrol, hexestrol, mestilbol, methestrol, pentafluranol, phenestrol, terfluranol, stilbestrol esters * Triphenylethylenes: chlorotrianisene, desmethylchlorotrianisene, estrobin (), M2613, triphenylbromoethylene, triphenylchloroethylene, triphenyliodoethylene, triphenylmethylethylene * Secosteroids (open-ring steroids): allenestrol, allenolic acid, bisdehydrodoisynolic acid, carbestrol, doisynoestrol, doisynolic acid, fenestrel, methallenestril * Selective ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2 agonists: diarylpropionitrile, ERB-196, erteberel, FERb 033, GTx-758, prinaberel, propylpyrazoletriol, WAY-166818, WAY-214156 * Others: , paroxypropione, quadrosilan, tetrahydrochrysene SERMs like tamoxifen and raloxifene can also be considered to be nonsteroidal estrogens in some tissues. ====Environmental==== * Synthetic xenoestrogens: alkylphenols, bisphenols (e.g., bisphenol A), parabens, phthalates, polyhalogenated compounds ===Natural=== * Metalloestrogens: cadmium, others * Mycoestrogens: taleranol (\u03b2-zearalanol), \u03b1-zearalenol, \u03b2-zearalenol, zearalanone, zearalenone, zeranol (\u03b1-zearalanol) * Phytoestrogens: coumestrol, daidzein, deoxymiroestrol, equol, genistein, miroestrol, many others ==See also== * Selective estrogen receptor modulator * Nonsteroidal antiandrogen ==References== ==Further reading== * * Category:Estrogens Category:Sex hormones ",
