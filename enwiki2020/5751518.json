Following the war the ship was transferred to the Canadian Department of Marine and Fisheries and converted into a lightvessel. Re-designated Lightship No. 22, the ship remained as such until 1958. The ship was sold for commercial use and renamed Centennial and was in service until 1978. ==Design and description== The RCN's Battle-class trawlers formed part of the Canadian naval response to Admiralty warnings to Canada about the growing German U-boat threat to merchant shipping in the western Atlantic.Tucker, p. 253 Intended to augment anti-submarine patrols off Canada's east coast, these ships were modelled on contemporary British North Sea trawlers, since the standard types of Canadian fishing vessels were considered unsuitable for patrol work.Tucker, pp. 254, 257 Twelve vessels were ordered on 2 February 1917 from two shipyards, Polson Iron Works of Toronto and Canadian Vickers of Montreal.Johnston et al., p. 417 Those vessels built at Polson Iron Works displaced and were long overall with a beam of and a draught of .Macpherson and Barrie, p. 27 They were propelled by a steam-powered triple expansion engine driving one shaft creating giving the vessels a maximum speed of .Maginley and Collin, p. 67 All twelve trawlers were equipped with a QF 12-pounder 12 cwt naval gun mounted forward. This was considered to be the smallest gun that stood a chance of putting a surfaced U-boat out of action, and they also carried a small number of depth charges.Tucker, p. 257 The trawlers were named after battles of the Western Front during the First World War that Canadians had been involved in. They cost between $155,000 and $160,000 per vessel. ==Service history== Named after the Battle of St. Julien, the ship was built by Polson Iron Works at Toronto, Ontario, and was launched on 16 June 1917.Macpherson and Barrie, p. 30 Intended for use during the 1917 shipping season, the construction of the vessels was delayed by the entry of the United States into the war. With higher wages found south of the border, a shortage of skilled labour developed in the shipyards, coupled with a shortage of construction material.Johnston et al., pp. 481\u2013484 St. Julien was commissioned on 13 November 1917. St. Julien sailed to the east coast where for the 1918 shipping season, all the Battle- class trawlers were assigned to patrol and escort duties based out of Sydney, Nova Scotia. The Battle class was used for patrol and escort duties off the Atlantic coast of Canada until the end of the war.Johnston et al., pp. 543, 645 The ship remained in service with the RCN until being paid off in 1920. St. Julien was turned over to the Department of Marine and Fisheries, and like sister ships , , and was converted to a lightship.Maginley and Collin, p. 113 This involved placing an electric light at the foremast head and installing a foghorn atop a latticework tower. The ship was re-designated Lightship No. 22 and served as such until 1958.Colledge, p. 550 The lightvessel was sold in 1958 and renamed Centennial, she was still in existence as of 1978. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * * * * ==External links== * Battle-class trawlers Category:Trawlers of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Battle-class trawlers Category:World War I naval ships of Canada Category:1917 ships Category:Auxiliary ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy ",
