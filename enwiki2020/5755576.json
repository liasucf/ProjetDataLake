He attended Jun\u00edpero Serra High School and the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1987 with a B.A. in English. In a 2009 interview, Gutfeld explained that he started to experience a change in his political thinking while he was attending UC Berkeley: ==Career== After college, Gutfeld had an internship at The American Spectator, as an assistant to conservative writer R. Emmett Tyrrell. He then worked as a staff writer at Prevention magazine and in Emmaus, Pennsylvania, as an editor at various Rodale Press magazines. In 1995 he became a staff writer at Men's Health.

During his tenure, circulation increased from 750,000 to 1.2 million. In 2003, Gutfeld hired several dwarfs to attend a conference of the Magazine Publishers of America on the topic of \"buzz\", with instructions to be as loud and annoying as possible. The stunt generated publicity but led to Gutfeld being fired soon afterward; he then became head of \"brain development\" at Dennis Publishing. He edited the company's Maxim magazine in the UK from 2004 to 2006. Gutfeld's contract expired without renewal after losses in readership under his tenure.

On May 31, 2015, Gutfeld began his own late-night show on Fox News called The Greg Gutfeld Show; the show airs at 10:00 p.m. ET on Saturdays. ==Controversial remarks== ===Apology to Canadians=== In a five-minute segment broadcast on March 17, 2009, Gutfeld and his panel discussed Canadian Lieutenant General Andrew Leslie's statement that the Canadian Armed Forces may require a one-year \"synchronized break\" once Canada's mission in Afghanistan ended in 2011. \"Meaning, the Canadian military wants to take a breather to do some yoga, paint landscapes, run on the beach in gorgeous white Capri pants,\" Gutfeld said. \"I didn't even know they were in the war\", comedian panelist Doug Benson added, then continued, \"I thought that's where you go if you don't want to fight. Go chill in Canada.\" Gutfeld also said: \"Isn't this the perfect time to invade this ridiculous country? They have no army!\" The segment drew wide attention and outrage in Canada after being posted on YouTube following the reported deaths of four Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan three days earlier. Canada, at the time, had been in command of the NATO mission in the Kandahar Province, the birthplace and former capital of the Taliban, for the preceding three years. Along with the Helmand Province, the two provinces were \"home to some of the fiercest opposition to coalition forces\" and reported to \"have the highest casualty rates per province.\" Canadian Defence Minister Peter MacKay called on Fox to apologize for the satirical comments, describing the remarks as \"despicable, hurtful and ignorant.\" Gutfeld in response maintained the show is satirical and irreverent but offered the following apology: \"The March 17 episode of Red Eye included a segment discussing Canada's plan for a 'synchronized break,' which was in no way an attempt to make light of troop efforts. However, I realize that my words may have been misunderstood. It was not my intent to disrespect the brave men, women and families of the Canadian military, and for that I apologize.\" ===Ground Zero mosque=== On August 9, 2010, Gutfeld stated that he planned on constructing New York City's first Islamic-friendly gay bar next to the Park51 Islamic community center. ==Personal life== , Gutfeld resides in New York City with his Russian wife, Elena Moussa, whom he met in London, where he lived for three years.
