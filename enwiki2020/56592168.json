    "text": "Anne E. Gelb is a mathematician interested in numerical analysis, partial differential equations, and Fourier analysis of images. She is John G. Kemeny Parents Professor of Mathematics at Dartmouth College. ==Research interests== More specifically, Gelb describes her research as \"developing highly accurate and efficient data-driven numerical methods for extracting important information in applications such as medical imaging, synthetic aperture radar imaging, climatology, signal processing, and fluid dynamics\". ==Education and career== Gelb graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1989, with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. She went to Brown University for her graduate studies, completing a Ph.D. in 1996. Her dissertation, Topics in Higher Order Methods for Partial Differential Equations, was supervised by David I. Gottlieb. After postdoctoral research with Herbert Keller at the California Institute of Technology, she joined the department of mathematics and statistics at Arizona State University in 1998. In 2016 she moved from Arizona State to Dartmouth as the John G. Kemeny Parents Professor. ==References== ==External links== *Home page * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:Brown University alumni Category:Dartmouth College faculty Category:20th-century women mathematicians Category:21st-century women mathematicians ",
