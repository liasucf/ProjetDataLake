    "text": "was a stable of sumo wrestlers, one of the Nishonoseki ichimon or group of stables. As of September 2010 it had eight active wrestlers. The stable was established in 1981 by former \u014dzeki Kaiketsu Masateru, as a breakaway from Hanakago stable. Among the wrestlers who went with him was \u014cnokuni, who reached the top makuuchi division in 1983. In 1985 its parent stable folded and it took in the remaining Hanakago wrestlers, including future makuuchi Hananoumi and Hananokuni. \u014cnokuni became the 62nd yokozuna in 1987. The stable had less success in later years, and did not have a sekitori ranked wrestler after the retirement of Shunketsu in 2008. In August 2010, Hanaregoma became the head of the Japan Sumo Association, a position he held until 2012. On 7 February 2013, due to Hanaregoma\u2032s imminent mandatory retirement, the stable was absorbed into \u014cnokuni\u2032s Shibatayama stable, which had branched off from its parent in 1999. ==Owner== *1981-2013: 19th Hanaregoma (former \u014dzeki Kaiketsu Masateru) ==Notable wrestlers== *\u014cnokuni \u2013 best rank yokozuna *Hananoumi \u2013 best rank komusubi *Hananokuni \u2013 best rank maegashira 1 *Misugiiso - best rank maegashira 2 *Shunketsu \u2013 best rank maegashira 12 *Komafud\u014d - best rank maegashira 13 *Hidenohana \u2013 best rank j\u016bry\u014d *Maeta - best rank makushita ==Referees== *Tamamitsu Kimura (real name Nobuhide Ueda) - san'yaku referee *Kichijiro Kimura (Masahiro Nishino) - makushita referee ==Usher== *Katsuyuki (Katsuyuki Koyama) - san'yaku usher == See also == *Hanaregoma-oyakata *List of sumo stables ==References== Category:Defunct sumo stables ",
