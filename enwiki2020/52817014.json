    "text": "The Diocesan museum of sacred art in Arezzo (also known as MuDAS) was founded in 1963 but opened regularly to the public only in 1985, and was housed in several rooms above the sacristy of the Cathedral of San Donato. In 2011 it was relocated to the first floor of the bishop's residence. The museum exhibits works of art and liturgical items, from the 12th to the 19th centuries, that come from the cathedral and other churches in the diocesan territory, significant for their religious and cultural significance to Arezzo and the surrounding area. Highlights of the museum include several works of Giorgio Vasari and the Pace di Siena. The museum is accessible to the disabled, offers space for teaching, temporary exhibitions, and restoration. == Works == The museum occupies five rooms and offers an itinerary focusing on history, art, and devotional practices of the region, the Diocese of Arezzo- Cortona-Sansepolcro. === First room === The first room contains the oldest works among which are paintings, sculptures, illuminated manuscripts, liturgical vestments, and medieval gold and silver work, including: * Pace di Siena containing Christ on the cross with angels (front) and Our Lady of Sorrows (reverse) (early 15th century), in gold, enamels, precious stones, and pearls, from France-Flanders; contained in a reliquary of silver, bronze, and gold-plated copper, made in 1815 by the Roman Giuseppe Spagna; * Crucifix (12th-13th century), painted wood; * Series of thuribles (13th century), bronze, from Arezzo; * St. James arm-reliquary (14th-15th centuries), gold- plated copper and precious stones, from Arezzo; * Annunciation (1375-1400), tempera on wood, by Andrea di Nerio; * Madonna with child enthroned among St. James, St. Anthony the abbot, and the donor (1377) and Annunciation (1380-1385), detached frescoes, by Spinello Aretino; * Polyptych with the Madonna with child enthroned and the evangelists (1430-1440), attributed to Stefano di Antonio di Vanni; * Tabernacle with Annunciation (1434), in terracotta relief, attributed to Bernardo Rossellino. === Second room === The second room is dedicated to works made in the 15th and early 16th centuries.
