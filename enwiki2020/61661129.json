    "text": "Elena Moldovan Popoviciu (1924\u20132009) was a Romanian mathematician known for her work in functional analysis and specializing in generalizations of the concept of a convex function. She was a winner of the Simion Stoilow Prize in mathematics. ==Education and career== Elena Moldovan was born in Cluj and studied mathematics at the Babe\u0219 University of Cluj, earning a bachelor's degree there in 1947; afterwards, she became a schoolteacher. She returned to the university for doctoral study in the early 1950s, initially working with Grigore Calug\u0103re\u0103nu, but she soon came under the influence of Tiberiu Popoviciu and began working with him in functional analysis. She completed her Ph.D. in 1960. Her dissertation, Sets of Interpolating Functions And The Notion of Convex Function, was supervised by Popoviciu. She married Popoviciu in 1964, remained at the university, and became a full professor there in 1969. She served as the second editor-in-chief of the journal Revue d\u2019Analyse Num\u00e9rique et de Th\u00e9orie de l\u2019Approximation, founded in 1972 by her husband. She died in Cluj-Napoca on June 24, 2009. ==Recognition== Popoviciu won the Simion Stoilow Prize of the Romanian Academy, for her achievements in mathematics, in 1972. A conference in honor of Popoviciu's 75th birthday was held at the University of Cluj in 1999, and a second conference in her honor was held five years later. ==References== Category:Romanian mathematicians Category:Women mathematicians Category:Functional analysts Category:Babe\u0219- Bolyai University alumni Category:Babe\u0219-Bolyai University faculty Category:People from Cluj-Napoca Category:1924 births Category:2009 deaths ",
