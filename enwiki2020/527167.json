    "text": "The half crown was a denomination of British money, equivalent to two shillings and sixpence, or one-eighth of a pound. The half crown was first issued in 1549, in the reign of Edward VI. No half crowns were issued in the reign of Mary, but from the reign of Elizabeth I half crowns were issued in every reign except Edward VIII, until the coins were discontinued in 1970. The half crown was demonetised (ahead of other pre-decimal coins) on 1 January 1970, the year before the United Kingdom adopted decimal currency on Decimal Day. During the English Interregnum of 1649\u20131660, a republican half crown was issued, bearing the arms of the Commonwealth of England, despite monarchist associations of the coin's name. When Oliver Cromwell was made Lord Protector of England, half crowns were issued bearing his semi-royal portrait. The half crown did not display its value on the reverse until 1893. The half-crown was often colloquially referred to, even until it was withdrawn, as \"half a dollar\". ==History of the half crown by reign== Gold half crown of Elizabeth I, 1580/81. Newark, Nottinghamshire. *King Henry VIII 1526: the first English half crown was struck in gold. *King Edward VI 1551: issued the first half crown in silver.

At the end of the reign silver half crowns were issued. *King James I: gold half crowns were issued again.

Proof sets of \u00a3sd coins, including the halfcrown, were issued by the Royal Mint, bearing the date 1970. ==Size and weight== From 1816, in the reign of George III, half crown coins had a diameter of 32 mm and a weight of 14.14 grams (defined as troy ounce), dimensions which remained the same for the half crown until decimalisation in 1971. ==Mintages== The mintage figures below are taken from the annual UK publication COIN YEARBOOK.
