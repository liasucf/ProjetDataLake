    "text": "Groove Approved is the fourth solo studio album by the English singer- songwriter Paul Carrack, then a member of the supergroup Mike + The Mechanics. It was originally released in 1989, on the Chrysalis label. While his previous album featured members of Mike + The Mechanics, for this album Carrack worked mainly with producer T-Bone Wolk. The album's only hit was \"I Live by the Groove\", which was co-written by Carrack and Eddie Schwartz, and which peaked at #31 on the Billboard Hot 100.[ Paul Carrack USA chart history], Billboard.com. Retrieved February 27, 2018. Schwartz co-produced the track with Wolk and Carrack; the rest of the album was produced by Wolk and Carrack working as a duo. The song \"Battlefield\" was later covered by co-writer Nick Lowe under the title \"I Live On A Battlefield\". Carrack himself would use this longer title when he re-recorded the song in 2007 on his album Old, New, Borrowed And Blue, and again on his 2010 album A Different Hat (backed by The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra). ==Reception== AllMusic's William Ruhlmann calls Groove Approved \"a solid, workman-like collection\", and writes that its limited commercial success \"had less to do with the album's real commercial potential than with upheavals in the record company\". Jim Green of Trouser Press praised the album for its \"good old-fashioned R&B; grooves, often garnished with Carrack's tasty Hammond organ licks.\" However, Green also notes that \"unfortunately, the synthetic drums sometimes slicken or stiffen the rhythm too much,\" and that \"the songs aren't unforgettable, but they're mostly painless\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes. * Paul Carrack \u2013 lead and backing vocals, acoustic piano, Hammond organ, drums, programming, vibraphone, handclaps * Ed Royensdal \u2013 keyboards * T-Bone Wolk \u2013 bass guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, mandolin, accordion, synthesizer, handclaps * Mike Campbell \u2013 guitar, 12-string guitar * Robbie McIntosh \u2013 electric guitar * Vinnie Zummo \u2013 rhythm guitar * Jimmy Bralower \u2013 drum and percussion programming * Mickey Curry \u2013 drums, cymbals * Sammy Figueroa \u2013 percussion * Dick Morrissey \u2013 saxophone * Bob Loveday \u2013 violin * Bernard Fowler \u2013 backing vocals * Daryl Hall \u2013 backing vocals * Curtis King \u2013 backing vocals * Joe Lynn Turner \u2013 backing vocals * Paul Young \u2013 backing vocals === Production === * Producers \u2013 Paul Carrack and T-Bone Wolk (all tracks); Eddie Schwartz (track 2). * Engineer \u2013 Tim Leitner * Mixing \u2013 Bob Clearmountain(tracks 1, 3, 7, 8 & 9); Tom Lord-Alge (tracks 2, 4, 5, 6 & 10). ==References== ==External links== * Category:1989 albums Category:Chrysalis Records albums Category:Paul Carrack albums ",
