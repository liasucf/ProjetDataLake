    "text": "The Grosseto Baseball Club is a baseball franchise based in the city of Grosseto, Tuscany in Italy, which was founded in 1952. ==History== The Grosseto BBC was previously a franchise in Italy's top professional competition, the Italian Baseball League, but was forced to move down to Serie C after the 2011 season due to financial troubles. As a result, the franchise ended its activity for 60 years. In between, Grosseto was represented in the league by several teams with different nicknames in a span of nine seasons from 1999\u20132008. Overall, the Grosseto teams won IBL titles in 1981, 1986, 1989, 2004 and 2007, and also won Gold at the 2005 European Cup tournament. Then, in 2012 was established a new team to replace the old one, called Grosseto Baseball, that rejoined the Italian Baseball League, even though they were forced to return to Serie C in 2013 due to budget limitations. In 2014, once more, Grosseto moved up to Serie A and won the league championship. ==See also== *Grosseto Baseball Club players ==Sources== *Baseball Reference \u2013 Italian Baseball League *Baseball Reference Bullpen \u2013 Grosseto History *Grosseto Baseball Category:Baseball teams in Italy Category:1952 establishments in Italy ",
