    "text": "Johann Joseph Gassner Johann Joseph Gassner (22 August 1727 in Braz, near Bludenz, Vorarlberg \u2013 1779 Pondorf, now part of Winklarn, Bavaria) was a noted exorcist. While a Catholic priest at Kl\u00f6sterle he gained a wide celebrity by professing to \"cast out devils\" and to work cures on the sick by means simply of prayer; he was attacked as an impostor, but the bishop of Regensburg, who believed in his honesty, bestowed upon him the cure of Pondorf. Gassner's methods have been linked to a special form of hypnotic training. He has been described as a predecessor of modern hypnosis.Burkhard., Peter. (2005). Gassner's Exorcism\u2014Not Mesmer's Magnetism\u2014Is the Real Predecessor of Modern Hypnosis. International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis 53: 1-12. Henri Ellenberger, in his \"Discovery of the Unconscious\", placed the dispute between Gassner and Franz Anton Mesmer at the center of modern psychotherapy.Ellenberger Henri, \"Discovery of the Unconscious\".
