Art critic Na\u0111a Bobi\u010di\u0107 nevertheless reminds us of the struggle towards the end, at which point the reader is awarded with an ending devoid of naivete, one which is full of optimism, one which reminds us of the cycles of creation and renewal. > In the novel, Tatjana Bezjak is also concerned with the unenviable position > of independent artists, especially artists who in this country, with more or > less passion, struggle for survival.
