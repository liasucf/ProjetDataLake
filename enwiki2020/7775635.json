    "text": "Stefano Pioli (born 20 October 1965) is an Italian football manager and a former footballer who played as a defender. He is the head coach at Serie A club A.C. Milan. ==Playing career== Pioli, a native of Parma, started his own playing career for his home city team, Parma. Successively, he was signed by Juventus, with whom he made his Serie A debut in 1984, winning the league title, the European Cup, the European Super Cup and the Intercontinental Cup during his three seasons with the club. After being sold to Hellas Verona in 1987, Pioli moved to Fiorentina in 1989, where he spent six years of his career, before spending two seasons with Padova. After successive season-long spells in Serie C with Pistoiese and Fiorenzuola, he ended his career in 1999 with Colorno of Eccellenza Emilia-Romagna (the sixth-highest level of Italian football at that time; the top level of the Emilia-Romagna regional league system), playing alongside his brother Leonardo. ==Style of play== An elegant, tenacious, physical, and mobile defender, Pioli was capable of playing anywhere along the back-line, although he performed best as a man-marking centre-back, or \"stopper,\" in Italian. Considered to be a promising and consistent player in his youth, his career was affected by numerous, serious injuries, however. ==Coaching career== ===Early career=== From 1999 to 2002 Pioli coached Bologna's youth team (winning a championship with Allievi Nazionali's team), and Chievo's in 2002\u201303. In 2003\u201304, he was appointed as head coach of Serie B club Salernitana. He moved to Modena, still of Serie B, in 2004. In 2006, Pioli was named as Parma's head coach, therefore returning to his home city and marking his Serie A debut as a manager. However, he was sacked on 12 February 2007 after a 3\u20130 loss to Roma which brought Parma down to second-last place and replaced by Claudio Ranieri. On 11 September 2007, Pioli was unveiled as new head coach of Serie B club Grosseto, replacing Giorgio Roselli, who was sacked after three consecutive defeats in the first three league matches, and managed to lead the Tuscan minnows to an impressive mid-table finish in their first season in the Serie B. He then served as head coach of Piacenza for their 2008\u201309 Serie B campaign. In July 2009, he left Piacenza to join Sassuolo as new head coach of the neroverdi. ===Chievo=== On 10 June 2010, Pioli was named head coach of Serie A club Chievo on a 12-month contract. ===Palermo=== On 2 June 2011, Pioli was named head coach of Serie A club Palermo, but he was relieved of his duties just 90 days later. ===Bologna=== On 4 October 2011, Pioli was named new head coach of Bologna in Serie A, replacing the sacked Pierpaolo Bisoli. After two troublesome seasons with Bologna, both ended with the team struggling in the bottom half of the Serie A table but always escaping relegation, he was removed from his managerial duties on 8 January 2014, with Davide Ballardini appointed as his replacement. ===Lazio=== On 12 June 2014, it was confirmed Pioli's appointment as new head coach of Lazio in place of Edoardo Reja. In his first season at the club, he led Lazio to a third-place Serie A finish. On 11 June 2015, he was offered a new 2-year contract with an additional year option. On 3 April 2016, Pioli was sacked after a 4\u20131 home defeat to city rivals Roma. ===Internazionale=== On 8 November 2016, Pioli was appointed as the new head coach of Internazionale on an 18-month contract. On 20 November, Inter drew 2\u20132 against Milan in a Serie A Derby della Madonnina match, Pioli's first competitive match as head coach of the club. He was sacked on 9 May 2017. Inter had won 12 of the first 16 Serie A matches that Pioli was in charge of (draw with Milan, losses to Napoli, Juventus and Roma), but this was followed by two draws and five losses in their last seven Serie A matches prior to his sacking. ===Fiorentina=== On 6 June 2017, Pioli was named new head coach of Fiorentina. He signed for two years with another optional year. Pioli was in charge of the team when on 4 March 2018 central defender and captain Davide Astori died unexpectedly; to honor the memory of the player, Pioli got a commemorative tattoo.https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/fiorentina-coach- stefano-pioli-gets-tattoo-remember-davide-astori On 9 April 2019, Pioli resigned as manager. ===Milan=== On 9 October 2019, Pioli was appointed as the new coach of Milan, on a deal to the end of the season. On 21 July 2020, Pioli reached an agreement with Milan for a two-year deal extension of his contract as head coach that will now expire on June 2022. ==Style of management== Pioli usually uses a 4\u20132\u20133\u20131 formation, or a 3\u20135\u20132 formation, with full-backs or wing-backs who actively take part in the team's attacking plays. During his time at Lazio, he often used a 4\u20133\u20133 formation. Due to his passion for basketball, he attempted to bring strategic elements of the sport into his own tactical approach as a football manager. As a head coach of A.C. Milan, Pioli made use of an archaic WM formation, also known as 3\u20132\u20132\u20133. Although presented officially as a 4\u20133\u20133, the formation featured the left full-back, Theo Hernandez, in a more advanced position, whereas the right full-back's attacking presence was significantly limited. Another key feature of this formation was in the center, where two pairs of holding and attacking midfielders formed a square, supporting each other offensively and defensively.https://sempremilan.com/gds-piolis-tactical-revolution-sees-milan- use-3-2-2-3-formation However, with the arrival of Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 in January 2020, Pioli switched Milan's formation to his long favored 4\u20132\u20133\u20131, primarily in order to accommodate for the Swedish ageing yet prolific goalscorer, in which he would play up front without much of a defensive work other than pressing, alternating between the roles of a classical striker, a target forward, and a false 9.https://sempremilan.com/pioli-reveals-why-he- changed-milans-system-to-a-4-2-3-1-praises-impact-of-ibrahimovic The switch of formation also allowed Hakan \u00c7alhano\u011flu, an attacking midfielder in a number 10 role, to return to his preferred position as a playmaker behind the main striker, out of which he had been playing for years in various other formations.https://www.mediagol.it/milan/milan-calhanoglu-risponde-ai-tifosi- in-italia-sto-bene-svelo-il-mio-ruolo-ideale-il-gol-piu- importantehttps://www.milannews24.com/calhanoglu-pioli-mi-ha-dato-sicurezza- in-campo-ibra-un-vero-leone Ante Rebi\u0107 and Isma\u00ebl Bennacer, the two high- profile new arrivals struggling to fit into the previous coach's system, were given a few more opportunities to prove themselves; as a result, the former got to play in his favorite position as a left winger and quickly topped the club's seasonal goalscoring chart, while the latter formed an efficient double pivot with Franck Kessi\u00e9, who also significantly improved the quality of his performances.https://www.90min.com/posts/ante-rebic-has-been-the-key-to-milan- surprising-resurgencehttps://www.corriere.it/sport/20_luglio_16/franck-kessie- campione-ritrovato-nuovo-milan- pioli-7c7b6b14-c743-11ea-a0f9-db06e95bcc12.shtmlhttps://sempremilan.com/mediaset-e100m-rated- duo-attracting-interest-from-abroad-but-milans-stance-is-clear ==Career statistics== ===Player=== {| class=\"wikitable center\" style=\"text- align:center; font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"3\"|National Cup !colspan=\"3\"|Europe !colspan=\"3\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Comp !Apps !Goals !Comp !Apps !Goals !Comp !Apps !Goals !Comp !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- || 1982\u201383 || rowspan=2 | Parma || Serie C || ?
