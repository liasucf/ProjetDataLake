    "text": "Michael S\u00f8ren Madsen (born September 25, 1957) is an American actor, producer, director, writer, poet and photographer. His first major film role was in Thelma & Louise (1991), and he is best known for working with director Quentin Tarantino in the role of Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs (1992), as Budd in both segments of Kill Bill (2003 and 2004), and appearing in The Hateful Eight (2015) and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019). Known for playing \"charming, careless, terrifying bastards\", Madsen has also starred in many feature films and television series, and has done voice work for video games. ==Early life== Madsen was born September 25, 1957, in Chicago, Illinois. His mother, Elaine (born 1932), was a filmmaker and author. His father, Calvin Christian Madsen (1927\u20132015), was a World War II Navy veteran and a firefighter with the Chicago Fire Department. His parents divorced in the 1960s, and his mother left the financial world to pursue a career in the arts, encouraged by film critic Roger Ebert. His siblings are Cheryl Madsen, an entrepreneur, and Academy Award nominee Virginia Madsen. Madsen's paternal grandparents were Danish, while his mother is of English, German, Irish, Native American and Scottish ancestry. ==Career== Madsen as a senior in high school, 1975 Madsen began working at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago, where he served as an apprentice under John Malkovich and appeared in a production of Of Mice and Men. Madsen's first taste of Hollywood filmmaking came in 1991 with supporting roles in Ridley Scott\u2019s Thelma & Louise and Oliver Stone\u2019s The Doors. In Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut film Reservoir Dogs, Madsen played Mr. Blonde, a villainous mobster. He did not get the role of Mr. Pink (which went to Steve Buscemi), which he wanted because it had more scenes with Harvey Keitel. For Pulp Fiction, Madsen had to decline the role of Vincent Vega, which went to John Travolta, because he was filming Wyatt Earp. Madsen starred in Mike Newell's gangster film Donnie Brasco (1997). He once said of these films: \"Some of them I'm only in for 10 minutes, but they bought my name, and they bought my face to put on the DVD box with a gun. What people don't always understand is that I established a certain lifestyle for my family back in the days of Species and Mulholland Falls and The Getaway. I wasn't about to move my six kids into a trailer park. So when people offered me work, it wasn't always the best, but I had to buy groceries and I had to put gas in the car.\" Madsen in 2006 In Kill Bill, Madsen played assassin Budd, the brother of Bill (David Carradine) The film was released in two parts, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2. In 2004, Tarantino discussed an idea for the film to unite Madsen and Travolta, as The Vega Brothers. In 2007, Tarantino said the film (which he intended to call Double V Vega) was \"kind of unlikely now\", because of the age of the actors and the onscreen deaths of both characters. Madsen appeared in Uwe Boll's BloodRayne, a film he described as \"an abomination... It's a horrifying and preposterous movie\". He won Best Actor awards at the Boston Film Festival and New York International Independent Film and Video Festival for his performance in Strength and Honour. He played himself in the mockumentary Being Michael Madsen. Madsen co-starred in Coma, a Web series on Crackle.

In August 2014, he starred in the Kill Bill-themed music video for the song \"Black Widow\" by Iggy Azalea featuring Rita Ora. Madsen starred in the ensemble western film The Hateful Eight (2015). He was among a number of people rumored to have leaked the film's script before it was released, causing Tarantino to almost not make the film and eventually rewrite it; it was later established that Madsen was not responsible for leaking the script. In 2016, he played a dramatized role of former Texas Ranger Phil Ryan in Real Detective on the Investigation Discovery network.

His friend, Dennis Hopper, described his poetry as a throwback to the Beat Generation: \"I like him better than Kerouac: raunchier, more poignant, he's got street language, images I can relate to, blows my mind with his drifts of gut-wrenching riffs; this actor is a poet and he is cool, of course, he is Michael Madsen.\" Madsen has noted influences for his style of poetry, as being Jack Kerouac and Charles Bukowski. In 2008, Madsen was invited and appeared in Norway for the Norwegian translation and release of Burning In Paradise. In November 2010, he was the guest of honor for his poetry at the Crossing Border Festival at The Hague. Another book of poetry, American Badass, was released on September 25, 2009.
