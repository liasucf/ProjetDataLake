Diocese of Dromore. Retrieved 28 April 2010. The first building was a small wattle and daub church on the northern bank of the River Lagan. The Diocese of Dromore was established through the reorganisation of the Irish Church in the late 12th century, possibly at the synod held in Dublin in 1192 by the papal legate, M\u00fairges Ua h\u00c9nna, Archbishop of Cashel. The diocese coincided with the territory of the U\u00ed Echach Cobo, which later became the baronies of Upper and Lower Iveagh, and the lordship of Newry, County Down. ===Post-Reformation=== During the 16th century Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church lost control of the old cathedral in Dormer to the Protestant Church of Ireland, which was wholly destroyed during the rebellion of 1641 and rebuilt twenty years later. In the 19th century, the Church chose the site of a new cathedral at Newry, the largest town of County Down, and a place of significant ecclesiastical importance as the site of an ancient monastery, situated at the head of Carlingford Lough. Work for building of Newry Cathedral begun in 1823 and was completed in 1829 by Dr. Michael Blake (bishop of Dromore 1833\u20131860) who had been Vicar-General of Dublin and the restorer of the Irish College at Rome. This cathedral was enlarged and beautified by Bishop Henry O'Neill, who succeeded Bishop Thomas MacGivern in 1901. Under Dr. McGivern's predecessor, Dr. John Pius Leahy, O.P. (1860\u20131890), a Dominican priory was founded on the Armagh side of Newry, and a church erected. The Poor Clares, who went to Newry from Harold's Cross, Dublin, in 1830, were for many years the only nuns north of the River Boyne. The Sisters of Mercy founded a convent at Newry in 1855. Abbey Yard in Newry marks the site of the Cistercian abbey founded in 1144 by St. Bernard's friend, St. Malachy O'Morgair, and endowed in 1157 by Maurice O'Loughlin, High King of Ireland. It is called in the annals Monasterium de Viridi Ligno \u2014 a name given to Newry from the yew-tree, said to have been planted there by St. Patrick, the Irish name being Niubar (and sometimes Newrkintragh, \"the yew at the head of the strand\") which is Latinized Ivorium or Nevoracum, but more commonly as above Viride Lignum. ==Allegations of Sexual Abuse== In 2012 the Parish Priest of Donaghmore in the diocese, Fr Terence Rafferty, was convicted of four counts of indecently assaulting a young girl in 2001. Five other offences were left on the books. The offences had been reported to the diocese in 2011: the diocese suspended him and promptly informed the relevant authorities. On 1 March 2018 Bishop John McAreavey resigned as Bishop of Dromore with immediate effect amid controversy concerning his knowledge of, and behaviour towards Fr. Malachy Finegan. McAreavey celebrated Mass him alongside in 2000 despite knowing Finegan to be a paedophile against whom very serious criminal allegations had been made. Indeed, in 2002, John McAreavey celebrated the funeral Mass of Malachy Finegan in Warrenpoint, Co. Down, Northern Ireland. The Vatican's formal acceptance of McAreavey's resignation was announced on 26 March 2018 and Bishop Philip Boyce was appointed Apostolic Administrator. On Monday 15 April 2019, Pope Francis appointed the Archbishop of Armagh - Eamon Martin as Apostolic Administrator of the diocese with \"immediate effect\". In response to the appointment, the outgoing apostolic administrator Bishop Boyce said \"I am very happy to welcome Archbishop Eamon Martin as the new Apostolic Administrator of Dromore. I wish to thank the people and clergy for their prayers, goodwill, encouragement and unstinting support over the last year. While I am looking forward to my retirement, I remain available to pastorally support Archbishop Martin, and Dromore, in any way that I can\". Archbishop Eamon Martin said, \u201cThe Holy Father has asked me to take over the role of Apostolic Administrator from Bishop Boyce whilst continuing with my role as Archbishop of Armagh. I am humbled by Pope Francis\u2019 request and grateful for his confidence in me. It will be an honour for me to serve the people, priests and religious of Dromore during this transitional time for the diocese.
