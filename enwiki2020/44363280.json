    "text": "Mumbles (also reissued as Angyumaluma Bongliddleany Nannyany Awhan Yi!) is an album by trumpeter Clark Terry featuring tracks recorded in 1964 and originally released on the Mainstream label.Edwards, D., Callahan, Eyries, P., Watts, R. & Neely, T. Discography of the Mainstream Label (Preview), accessed November, 11, 2014Lord, T., Clark Terry discography, accessed November, 11, 2014 ==Reception== Allmusic's Ken Dryden awarded the album 2\u00bd stars and states \"Clark Terry launched his \"Mumbles\" routine (where he delivered semi-coherent vocals interspersed with scat) with two numbers on a studio date for Verve led by Oscar Peterson; this Mainstream LP finds him expanding the concept to album length, with mixed success. Unfortunately, the effort becomes a little too commercial, not only de-emphasizing the jazz element to focus on the vocals, but adding lackluster songs\".Dryden K., Mumbles: Allmusic Review accessed November 11, 2014 The retitled rerelease was awarded 4 stars by Richard S. Ginell who commented \"As per the weird title, the music within this LP is among the happiest and most lighthearted (perhaps even occasionally light- headed) of Clark Terry's long, happy career\".Ginell, R.
