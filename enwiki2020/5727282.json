    "text": "Bombingham is a nickname for Birmingham, Alabama during the Civil Rights Movement due to the 50 dynamite explosions that occurred in the city between 1947 and 1965.Eskew, p. 53 The bombings were initially used against African Americans attempting to move into neighborhoods with entirely white residents. Later, the bombings were used against anyone working towards racial desegregation in the city. One neighborhood within Birmingham experienced so many bombings it developed the nickname of Dynamite Hill. ==History== By the 1940s, black families were trying to purchase homes in segregated white areas of Birmingham. The local Ku Klux Klan began a terror campaign against black families attempting to move to the west side of Center Street, sometimes firing shots or bombs at houses, or lighting a home's door on fire. Center Street became known as Dynamite Hill because of these attacks. From the late 1940s to the 1960s over 40 unsolved bombings occurred in Birmingham. Klan members specifically targeted civil rights lawyer Arthur Shores who lived in Birmingham. Some families refused to leave, instead tolerating the attacks in an effort to support desegregation efforts. ==Bombings== # July 28, 1949 \u2014 Home of the Reverend Milton Curry Jr, at 1100 Center Street North.\u201cHorrific years of Bombingham\u201d, AL.com, June 26, 2016. # August 2, 1949 \u2014 Second bomb at the Curry\u2019s home.\u201cHorrific years of Bombingham\u201d, AL.com, June 26, 2016. # April 22, 1950 \u2014 Third bomb at the Curry\u2019s home.\u201cHorrific years of Bombingham\u201d, AL.com, June 26, 2016. # December 21, 1950 \u2014 Home of Monroe and Mary Means Monk at 950 North Center Street, who had challenged the city of Birmingham\u2019s zoning laws.\u201cHorrific years of Bombingham\u201d, AL.com, June 26, 2016. # 1957 \u2014 Bomb at 1216 13th Street North in Fountain Heights was reportedly the fourth home bombed in less than a year.\u201cHorrific years of Bombingham\u201d, AL.com, June 26, 2016. # August 20, 1963 \u2013 Home of civil rights lawyer Arthur Shores. # September 4, 1963 \u2014 Home of civil rights lawyer Arthur Shores. # September 15, 1963 \u2014 16th Street Baptist Church bombing killed four young girls: Addie May Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, and Cynthia Wesley. ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==Further reading== * Category:African-American history in Birmingham, Alabama Category:Attacks on churches Category:Civil rights movement Category:History of Alabama Category:History of Birmingham, Alabama Category:Building bombings in the United States Category:Ku Klux Klan crimes in Alabama Category:Racially motivated violence against African Americans Category:Terrorist incidents in the United States ",
