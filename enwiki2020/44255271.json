    "text": "\"Coalmine'\" is a song written by Roxie Dean, Ron Harbin, and Richie McDonald and recorded by American country music artist Sara Evans. It was released in April 2006 as the third single from Evans\u2019 2005 album Real Fine Place. ==Content== \"Coalmine\" is an uptempo fiddle-driven song about a woman who loves her man, a coal miner, and wants him to love her until he returns to work again. Despite Evans coming off two Top 10 hits on the country charts, \"Coalmine\" met resistance with country radio due to the timing of its release following a deadly explosion at Sago Mine, West Virginia a few months earlier. As a result, it was only a minor Top 40 hit, peaking at number 37.http://wbkr.com/shoulda-been-a-hit-sara-evans-coalmine-video/ ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2006) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |} ==References== ==External links== Category:2006 singles Category:Sara Evans songs Category:RCA Records Nashville singles Category:Song recordings produced by Mark Bright (record producer) Category:2005 songs Category:Songs written by Roxie Dean Category:Songs written by Ron Harbin Category:Songs written by Richie McDonald ",
