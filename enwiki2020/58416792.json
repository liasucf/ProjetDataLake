    "text": "Aspergillus steynii is a species of fungus in the genus Aspergillus. It is from the Circumdati section. The species was first described in 2004. It has been shown to produce Ochratoxin A. The genome of A. steynii was sequenced as a part of the Aspergillus whole-genome sequencing project - a project dedicated to performing whole-genome sequencing of all members of the genus Aspergillus.Kjaerbolling I, Vesth TC, Frisvad JC, Nybo JL, Theobald S, Kuo A, Bowyer P, Matsuda Y, Mondo S, Lyhne EK, Kogle ME, Clum A, Lipzen A, Salamov A, Ngan CY, Daum C, Chiniquy J, Barry K, LaButti K, Haridas S, Simmons BA, Magnuson JK, Mortensen UH, Larsen TO, Grigoriev IV, Baker SE, Andersen MR Linking secondary metabolites to gene clusters through genome sequencing of six diverse Aspergillus species.
