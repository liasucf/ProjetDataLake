    "text": "Alexander David \"Alex\" Revell (born 7 July 1983) is an English manager and former footballer. He is currently manager of Stevenage. ==Career== ===Cambridge United=== Revell is a graduate of the Cambridge United youth set- up, where he struggled to establish himself during his stint at the Abbey Stadium. ====Kettering Town (loan)==== Discovering his first team opportunities at Cambridge were limited, Revell spent a loan spell at then Conference National club Kettering Town. ===Braintree Town=== Soon afterwards, Revell left Cambridge in 2004 where he made the decision to drop out of the Football League by joining Braintree Town. During his time at Braintree, Revell managed to find the net 35 times for the club, where he managed to help them gain promotion to the Conference South during the 2005\u201306 season. ===Brighton & Hove Albion=== Revell was signed by Brighton & Hove Albion from Braintree for \u00a38,000 during the close season of 2005\u201306. On 1 January 2008, Revell scored his first professional hat-trick as Brighton defeated Bournemouth 3\u20132 at the Withdean. ===Southend=== On 30 January 2008, Revell made his move from Brighton to Southend on a two-and-a-half-year contract for \u00a3150,000. Steve Tilson had been a long admirer of Revell and tried to sign him in August 2007 transfer window. On 16 August 2008, Revell scored his first league goal for Southend in a 1\u20131 draw with Millwall at The New Den. Revell scored his first home league goal for the Shrimpers in a 2\u20131 win over Swindon Town at Roots Hall on 18 October 2008. After several excellent hard working performances without reward, Revell scored his third goal for Southend after 10 minutes in the 2\u20132 draw away at Tranmere on 15 November 2008, getting ahead of Craig Duncan to meet Kevin Betsy's cross. Revell suffered a broken leg against Leyton Orient on 20 January 2009 after landing awkwardly, which ruled him out for the rest of the season. Revell made his comeback appearance from the injury on 10 July 2009 against Great Wakering in a pre season friendly. He made five appearances for Southend at the start of the 2009\u20132010 season, the last of which came against Swindon Town as Southend went down to a 2\u20131 defeat. Revell returned to Southend at the end of his loan spell having made 12 appearances and scoring two goals. On 12 January 2010, Southend and Revell parted company by mutual consent. ====Swindon Town (loan)==== On 1 September 2009, just three days after playing against them, he signed for Swindon Town on loan from Southend United until 3 January 2010, with the club having the option of making the move permanent if his spell was successful. Revell made his debut for The Robins in a 1\u20131 draw against his parent clubs rivals Colchester United. His first goals for Swindon came on 3 October 2009 against Brentford as he bagged a brace in a 3\u20132 victory. Revell fell down the pecking order at Swindon and with the fine form of Billy Paynter and Charlie Austin up front, Revell found his chances limited and was often an unused substitute. Swindon opted not to make the move permanent and Revell returned to Essex. ====Wycombe Wanderers (loan)==== Wycombe Wanderers thought they had signed Revell on 12 January 2010 on a free transfer but that deal fell through, on the rule that prevents players representing three clubs in one season. Revell was a Southend United player at the start of the season and played five times before going on a standard loan to Swindon Town, meaning that he had officially represented two clubs and subsequently could not sign for Wycombe. If Revell had gone on an emergency loan to Swindon Town he would have been able to sign for Wycombe Wanderers without any problems. On 22 January 2010, Revell was given permission to sign for Wycombe Wanderers on a three-month emergency loan. Revell remained a Southend United player as the club still held his registration. He remained on loan at Adams Park until late April 2010 before becoming a free agent. His first goal for Wycombe came on his debut, against Bristol Rovers from the penalty spot. After failing to score again for the next two months, Revell scored five goals in three games against Tranmere Rovers, Milton Keynes Dons and Swindon Town to help keep Wycombe in contention to avoid relegation. After the final game of his loan deal, he signed a contract at Wycombe, starting on 3 May until the end of June. However, this did not allow him to play in the final game of the season because the rule that prevents players representing three clubs in one season would only allow him to play while his emergency loan was valid. ===Leyton Orient=== Revell was offered an extended contract by Wycombe but turned it down, instead choosing to join Leyton Orient on a two-year contract starting on 1 July 2010. He scored on his league debut for Orient on 7 August, and followed it up three days later with the winning goal in the League Cup victory over his former club Swindon Town. On 13 November, Revell scored twice to help Orient register their first away win of the season with a 3\u20130 victory over Bristol Rovers. ===Rotherham United=== Revell signed for Rotherham United on the final day of the summer 2011 transfer window for an undisclosed fee.\"Rotherham sign orient striker Alex Revell\" BBC Sport. 31 August 2011.

He made his debut in a 1\u20130 win over Fulham the following day and went on to score his first goal against Norwich City, the next game. He went on to finish the season with 2 goals in 17 games for his new club and 6 in total for the season.
