    "text": "Drag pageantry is a developed form of pageantry for female impersonators, drag queens and trans women, styled after traditional beauty pageants or contests for cisgender women. It has also evolved into a pageantry for male impersonators, drag kings and trans men. == National pageants in the United States == National drag pageants became enmeshed within the gay community during the 1960s with a national circuit of pageants organized by Flawless Sabrina and have become increasingly prevalent since. Drag pageants were held in individual gay bars, and discoth\u00e8ques during the post Stonewall era. Drag pageants evolved independently, in the decade subsequent to the first gay Mardi Gras coronations. === Miss Gay America === Mirroring the format of the Miss America contest, the first national gay pageant Miss Gay America (MGA) was held in 1972 at the Watch Your Hat & Coat Saloon in Nashville, Tennessee, Nashville's first gay dance and show bar. Jerry Peek opened this bar in 1971, and it was an instant sensation, not only with gay patrons, but also with the straight crowd. Norma Kristie, state representative of Arkansas, was crowned as the winner of the 1973 Miss Gay America Pageant, and in 1975 Norman \"Norma Kristie\" Jones took ownership of the pageant from Jerry Peek, who founded the Miss Gay America Pageant. Norman Jones would form Norma Kristie, Inc. and operate the pageant and its network of preliminaries for the next 30 years. Since its inception, MGA has prided itself as a showcase for pure female impersonation: Contestants must be men who live as men, achieving a convincing feminine illusion solely through their own ingenuity, creativity, and resourcefulness. Bodily feminization via female hormones, breast implants, and/or injectable fillers such as liquid silicone is strictly forbidden (plastic surgery and fillers above the neck are permitted, however). An interview in male attire is a key component of the pageant; contestants are judged not only for their poise and articulateness but for their overall masculine presentation\u2014points may be deducted for feminine aspects such as overly plucked eyebrows or long fingernails. In February 2005, the Miss Gay America pageantry system was purchased by Larry Tyger and Terry Eason of L & T Entertainment. Currently, contestants are judged in 5 categories: Male Interview, Solo Talent, Evening Gown, Stage Question & Answer, and Production Talent. On February 4, 2016, Michael Dutzer and Rob Mansman of Mad Angel Entertainment purchased the Miss Gay America pageant From L & T Entertainment. ==== Former titleholders ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year!!Titleholder!!Given name!!First alternate!!Second alternate!!Third alternate!!Fourth alternate!!Crowning venue!!Notes |- |1973||Norma Kristie, Miss Gay Arkansas||Norman Jones||Charlie Brown, Miss Gay Georgia||Genie Dee, Miss Gay ?||No record||No record||Watch Your Hat & Coat Saloon, Nashville, TN||Retired |- |1974||Lady Baronessa, Miss Gay Illinois||Carmel Santiago||Roski Fernandez, Miss Gay Florida, Alt.||Billie Boots, Miss Gay Florida||No record||No record||Glass Menagerie Nightclub, Nashville, TN||Deceased, 1992 -

The title was offered to the 1976 First Alternate, Michael Andrews, who passed it up because he wanted to win the title. The title was then passed to the 1976 Second Alternate, Dani Daletto. Dani Daletto was crowned in a special ceremony at the 1976 Miss Gay South Pageant held at Vapors Nightclub in Hot Springs, AR. * *3 Ramona LeGer' died 5 months into his reign. 1995 First Alternate, Patti Le Plae Safe, requested not to be crowned or wear the crown during the pageant year in Ramona's memory. Patti La Plae Safe served as the official Miss Gay America Representative, until the night of the 1996 Miss Gay America Pageant, at which he was finally crowned the official 1995 Miss Gay America in a special ceremony. * *4 Alyssa had his title revoked due to scheduling conflicts with previous engagements and his Miss Gay America duties. The title was passed to the 2010 First Alternate, Coco Montrese, who was crowned in a special ceremony at The Grey Fox Nightclub in St. Louis, MO. * *5 Coti Collins is the longest competing Miss Gay America winner. His first appearance at Miss Gay America was in 1988 as the First Alternate from the Miss Gay West Virginia America franchise. ===Miss Continental=== As Miss Gay America grew in popularity and prestige, many professional female impersonators who lived full-time as women found they were unable to compete in the pageant due to its longstanding rule barring transgender contestants. Aside from the prestige of holding a national title, MGA afforded its winner guaranteed show bookings at every state preliminary held during the title year; thus, the MGA crown turned what was often local, part-time work into a full-time job. Because many trans women also use drag shows as a source of income, it was only natural that a pageantry system would evolve to meet their needs. In 1980, Chicago nightclub promoter Jim Flint, owner of the Baton Show Lounge, filled this void with the creation of the Miss Continental U.S.A. Pageant. Contestants were scored in interview, swim wear, talent, and evening gown; for the finalists, an on stage question. A number of notable winners either were \"boy queens\" at the time that they won or have never pursued gender transition\u2014including Chilli Pepper, the first Miss Continental, Michelle Dupree, Miss Continental 1998, Naysha Lopez, Miss Continental, 2013 and Brooke Lynn Hytes, Miss Continental 2014-15\u2014but over time the Continental Pageantry System became renowned for its \"titty girls,\" or pre-/non-operative transsexual contestants. On January 7, 2019 Jim Flint released a statement that Continental would be the second pageant out of the top 5 to allow post-operative contestant to compete in its pageants, the only other National System that allowed that until this time was All American Goddess. Today, Miss Continental has preliminaries representing various U.S. states as well as Canada and Europe. (All winners were crowned in Chicago, Illinois) {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ List of Former Miss Continental Titleholders |- !Year!!Titleholder!!First alternate!!Second alternate!!Third alternate!!Fourth alternate!!

On a preliminary level, the first MI crowned into the EOY system was Joey Paige, who captured the title of Kentucky EOY King at the preliminary pageant in Louisville on July 3, 2011. This was the only EOY MI prelim contest held that year. Michigan EOY also sent a representative to Nationals that year, Spacee Kadett, though Spacee was appointed the title in the state. The remaining contestants for the first EOY King contest entered as open competitors, and such open entry into EOY King competition continues to this day. In July 2011, after national competition, EOY crowned Spacee Kadett as the first national king in its system. Spacee's victory and reign of outrageous drag helped push drag kinging to a more daring and theatrical level across the US, and set a standard for kings in the EOY system. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year!!Titleholder!!First alternate!!Second alternates!!Notes |- |2011||Spacee Kadett||Richard Cranium|||| |- |2012||Mystikal||Spikey Van Dykey ||Tanner Taylor|| |- |2013||Owen McCord||Michael Christian||Bruno Diaz|| |- |2014||Chase McGroin||Gunner Daimon Gatlyn|||| |- |2015||Chaos||Bruno Diaz|||| |- |2016||Preston Dickerson||Jordan Reign ||Leo Scott|| |- |2017||Romeo White||Rocky Valentino |||| |- |2018||Liam Scott||Scrappy||Christian Gaye|| |} =====Femme Entertainer of the Year===== In 2015, EOY promoters and owners expanded the contest to include the Femme counterparts with the first National Pageant held at the Connection Complex theatre. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year!!Titleholder!!First alternate!!Second alternate!!Notes |- |2015||Tymisha Harris||Nova Loza ||Taylor Rene|| |- |2016||Bella Nicole Harlow||Ivy Les Vixens ||Nevaeh Sweetness|| |- |2017||Cass Marie Domino||Miranda Casada ||Qtip Chanel|| |- |2018||Olivia Jane||Miranda Casada ||Venus Envy|| |} NEOY Pageantry / http://www.eoy.netClick Click Expose Gay Entertainment Media / http://www.clickclickexpose.com ===Miss Gay USofA=== Houston, Texas based MGA promoter Jerry Bird purchased the bankrupt Miss Gay USA pageant from former MGA Jimi Dee in 1985. Within a few years he took the pageant from a small twelve contestant affair to a national showcase with over eighty participants. In 1986, the first Miss Gay USA Naomi Sims crowned Michael Andrews. In the mid-1990s the pageant was renamed Miss Gay USofA after complaints and legal threats from the owner of Miss USA, Donald Trump, who placed a cease and desist order until verbiage could be agreed upon that allowed for both competitions to continue without confusion or discrimination. There have been a wide range of contestants in the Miss USofA System, and many USofA titleholders also count the Miss Gay America crown as accomplishments in female impersonation. These include: Naomi Sims, Miss Gay USA 1979 (Miss Gay America 1985); Michael Andrews, Miss Gay USA 1986 (Miss Gay America 1977); Jacquelyn DeVaroe, Miss Gay USofA 1997 (Miss Gay America 1994); Lauren Taylor, Miss Gay USofA 1998 (Miss Gay America 1997); Alyssa Edwards, Miss Gay USofA 2006 (Miss Gay America 2010, though Edwards was stripped of the title a few short months after winning the crown); Dominique Sanchez, Miss Gay USofA 2010 (Miss Gay America 2003); Luscious, Miss Gay USofA 2011 (Miss Gay America 2007), and, Asia O'Hara, Miss Gay USofA 2007 (Miss Gay America 2016). The following is the list of the winners of the Miss Gay U.S.A. Pageant \u2014 then a complete change of ownership \u2014 Miss Gay USA winners 1986 through 1994 and Miss Gay USofA winners from 1995 through present: ====Miss Gay USofA==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year!!Titleholder!!First alternate!!Second alternate!!Third alternate!!Fourth alternate!!Location!!Notes |- |1979||Naomi Sims||Michael Andrews||Dina Jacobs||X||X||Crowned in Houston, TX||Deceased |- |1980||Jahnau Reis (Jahna Steele)||Dina Jacobs||Roski Fernandez||X||X||Crowned in Houston, TX||Deceased |- |1981||Dina Jacobs||X||X||X||X||X||No Contest Held Dina carried over from the previous year |- |1982||Eartha Kitt||Odessa Brown||Vonda DeLayne||X||X||Crowned in Austin, TX||Deceased |- |1983||Lady Nova Bernard||?||?||X||X||Crowned in Houston, TX||Deceased |- |1984||Lisa King||?||?||X||X||Crowned in Atlanta, GA||Deceased |- |1985||No Contest||X||X||X||X||X||Jerry Bird purchased the Miss Gay USA Pageant & became its promoter. |- |1986||Michael Andrews||Tandi Andrews||Tommie Ross||Jerry Harper||Lauren Brach||Crowned in Houston, TX||Deceased |- |1987||Diana Hutton||Tiffany Arieagus||Tommie Ross||Erica Adams||Dina Jacobs||Crowned in Columbia, SC||Deceased |- |1988||Tommie Ross||Netasha Edwards||Candi Stratton||Rita Ross||Tina DeVore||Crowned in Indianapolis, IN||Active |- |1989||Netasha Edwards||Candi Stratton||Eddie Dee||Monica Munro||Carmella Marcella Garcia||Crowned in St. Louis, MO||Deceased |- |1990||C\u2019ezanne Blincoe||Rita Ross||Bianca Paige||Farrah McCray||Jamie Monroe||Crowned in Louisville, KY||Active |- |1991||Sable Chanel||Tandi Andrews||Mahogany||Rita Ross||Amber Richards||Crowned in Atlanta, GA||Retired |- |1992||Tandi Andrews||Mahogany||Bianca Paige||Denise Darcell||Sweet Savage||Crowned in San Antonio, TX||Deceased |- |1993||Sweet Savage||Nicole DuBois||Jamie Hunter||Coco||Victoria West||Crowned in San Antonio, TX||Deceased |- |1994||Coco||Victoria West||Amber Richards||Natasha Richards||Terryl Lynn Fox||Crowned in St. Louis, MO||Deceased - Due to copyright threats from Donald Trump who was then co-owner of Miss USA/Miss Universe, the pageant was renamed Miss Gay USofA.

New competitions with new requirements brought a wider variety of performers to drag pageantry. Contests for plus-sized, mature and African American female impersonators became popular. ===All American Goddess=== This pageant system was created by Scott Gonyaw. Unlike the \"Big Four\" of drag pageantry, AAG welcomes postoperative trans women as contestants. *2007 - Latoya Bacall *2008 - India Ferrah *2009 - Candi Stratton *2010 - Alyssa Edwards *2011 - Alana Steele *2012 - Asia O'Hara *2013 - Brittany Moore *2014 - Sunny Dee-Lite *2015 - Dena Cass *2016 - Alexis Mateo *2017 - Antwanette Chanel Roberts *2018 - Nikki Vixxen *2019 - Tiffany T.

Though technically a state pageant, Miss Florida FI held prestige comparable to that of a national pageant for many years, with entertainers from around the U.S. vying for the crown, and guests and judges who included international celebrities. Before Miss Continental and Miss Gay USA (now Miss Gay USofA) were created, Miss Florida was the only major female- impersonation pageant that permitted trans women to compete. (Jim Flint, owner and founder of the Continental Pageantry System, has acknowledged Miss Florida as his inspiration for creating Miss Continental.) *1972 - Tricia Marie *1973 - Emor\u00e9 DuBois *1974 - Roxanne Russell *1975 - Noly Greer *1976 - Hot Chocolate *1977 - Dana Manchester *1978 - Tiffany Arieagus *1979 - Rachaell Santoni *1980 - Tiffani Middlesexx *1981 - Nikki Adams *1982 - Dana Douglas *1983 - Victoria Lawrence *1984 - Chena Black *1985 - Amber Richards *1986 - Mahogany *1987 - Sandy Laurent *1988 - Lakesha Lucky *1989 - Shant\u00e9 (Alexandra Billings) (see note below) *1990 - Chena Kelly *1991 - Bobbie Lake *1992 - Stephanie Shippae/Monica Munro (see note below) *1993 - Esmeralda Russell *1994 - Gloria Klein *1995 - Heather Fontaine *1996 - Jasmine Bon\u00e9t *1997 - Electra *1998 - Erika Norell *1999 - Danielle Hunter *2000 - Amy DeMilo *2001 - Valentina *2002 - Tasha Long *2003 - C\u00e9zanne *2004 - Angelique Ali (dethroned) *2004 - Gina DiAngelo *2005 - Champagne Bordeaux *2006 - No contest *2007 - Victoria Michaels *2008\u20132013 - Inactive *2014 - Brittany Moore *2015 - Chasity Ross Boen *2016 - Shantell D'Marco *2017 - Kalah Mendoza *2018 - Jazell Barbie Royale *2019 - Kylee Hunter ====Miss Florida FI at Large==== *1988 - Angel Sheridan *1989 - Joey Brooks *1990 - Andrea Lovelace *1991 - Robin Knight (dethroned), Lola Lush *1992 - Luna *1993 - Alicia Brooks *1994 - Sierrah Foxx (Deceased) *1995 - Lorrie Del Mar *1996\u20131999 - Inactive *2000 - Carmella Marcella Garcia (Deceased) *2001 - Nicolette Ashton *2002 - Jasmine Skiies *2003 - No contest *2004 - Jocelyn Summers *2005 - Sasha Sommers *2006 - No contest *2007 - TP Lords *2008\u20132016 - Inactive *2017 - Nicole T.

An alternative pageant called Miss Florida State was held that year; Shant\u00e9 (Alexandra Billings) was crowned the winner but is not officially recognized as a former Miss Florida FI. In 1992, ownership of the pageant again fell into dispute after the death of its second owner, Ren\u00e9 Rodriguez. This time, two competing pageants were held: Miss Florida FI, won by Stephanie Shippae \u0301, and National Miss Florida, won by Monica Munro. Monica is also unrecognized as an official former, but she walked in the Parade of Miss Floridas that opened the 2001 pageant at the invitation of the owners. ===Miss National, Miss National At Large, Mr. National=== This pageant was a huge part of the \"Big 5\" National pageant systems in the 1990s and early 2000s. It was created by Kevin Scott in 1994. The first winner was Tandi Andrews, but she was decrowned because she requested to run for another national pageant during her National reign. Her request was denied, she ran for that pageant regardless and was then decrowned. Tommie Ross assumed the crown. The last winners were Natasha Richards in 2003 for Miss National, Chelsea Pearl in 2002 for Miss National at Large, and Monte St. James in 2002 for Mr. National. In 2009, two people from Alabama attempted to purchase the contest and appointed Mokha Montrese as Miss National 2009. That sale fell through and was never completed. The system is now owned by Josh Maywalt. In 2018, ShaeShae LaReese won the title of Miss National 2018. All three divisions will return to the stage in 2021. *1994 - Tandi Andrews (DeCrowned) & (Deceased) *1994 - Tommie Ross *1995 - Tasha Long *1996 - Tamisha Iman *1997 - C'ezanne *1998 - Ashley Kruiz (Deceased) *1999 - Shawnna Brooks *2000 - Terri Vanessa Coleman *2001 - Nicole DuBois *2002 - Martina Diamante *2003 - Natasha Richards (Deceased) *2004 - 2008 - Inactive *2009 - Mokha Montrese *2010 - 2017 - Inactive *2018 - ShaeShae LaReese *2019 - No Contest *2020 - No pageant due to COVID-19 ====Miss National at Large==== *1996 - Sierrah Foxx (Deceased) *1997 - Niesha Dupree *1998 - Clarissa Cavalier (Deceased) *1999 - Darcel Stevens *2000 - Latoya Bacall *2001 - Monica Van Pelt *2002 - Chelsea Pearl *2003 - 2018 - Inactive *2019 - No Contest *2020 - No pageant due to COVID-19 *2021 - Dena Cass ====Mr. National==== *2000 - Carl Harris *2001 - Calvin St. Claire *2002 - Monte St. James *2003 - 2018 - Inactive *2019 - No Contest *2020 - No pageant due to COVID-19 *2021 - Mykul J.

This system is open to individuals of all genders with the only requirement to compete being they must perform regularly as a bearded performer (Real or Prosthetic). Prelims started in 2017 with the first National Competition held in May 2018. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year !Winner !First Alt !Second Alt !Location |- |2018 |Joey Gallagher |JerFay |KC Starr |Cash Inn, Phoenix AZ |- |2019 |Dion Dior Black |Bearonce Bear |Kiara Chimera |Play, Louisville KY |} ==See also== * Drag (clothing) * Drag queens * Drag kings * Faux queen * List of transgender- related topics * List of drag queens * RuPaul's Drag Race, a reality show with a similar premise ==References== * Category:Cross-dressing culture ",
