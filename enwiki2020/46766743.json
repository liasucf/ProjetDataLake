    "text": "Independence Act of Panama, 1821 The Declaration of Independence of Panama (Acta de Independencia de Panam\u00e1) is the document through which Panama declared its independence from the Spanish Empire on November 28, 1821. It was proclaimed in the Cathedral Plaza of Panama City after a council of leaders had met and drafted twelve points calling for severing Panama's relationship with the Spanish Crown and joining with the newly formed Republic of Gran Colombia. ==Background== After rebels in the small provincial town of Villa de los Santos issued the \"Primer Grito de Independencia de la Villa de Los Santos\" (Shout for Independence), on 10 November 1821, rebels throughout the Panamanian countryside began demanding independence. Using bribes to quell resistance from the Spanish troops and garner their desertion, the rebels gained control of Panama City without bloodshed. An open meeting was held with merchants, landowners, and elites, who fearing retaliation from Spain and interruption of trade decided to join the Republic of Gran Colombia and drafted the Independence Act of Panama. ==The \"Declaration\"== The Declaration of Independence was drafted on 28 November 1821 by the educator and diplomat Manuel Jos\u00e9 Hurtado and consisted of twelve articles. The text is as follows: :\"In a general meeting of all civilian, military and ecclesiastical corporations held today 28 November 1821 at the invitation of the City Council, after more arrested discussions before a large village meeting and under the highest order and harmony were agreed and decreed by common agreement the following items: #Panama, spontaneously and under the general vote of the people of understanding, is declared free and independent of the Spanish government. #The territory of the provinces of the Isthmus belongs to the Republic of Gran Colombia, to whose Congress our deputy will promptly go to represent us. #Individuals of the troops garrisoned in this place have the absolute freedom to make the choice that suits them, and if they want to return to Spain, they will be provided all the necessary aid for transport to the island of Cuba; in keeping with the honors of war, those that will remain at the ports of Chagres or Portobelo, then shall make the garrisons the possessions of the new government; putting under obligation all the officers, sergeants and soldiers, under due oath, to remain calm, to not accept any bribes, nor to take up weapons against the independent states of America during the present war. #Spanish patients who are in hospital will be assisted by the government, and once they return to health will presented with the necessary assistance in accordance with Article 3. #The Head of State of the Isthmus is stated to be Don Jos\u00e9 de F\u00e1brega, who was colonel with the Spanish armies; all corporations and authorities, civil and ecclesiastical shall be on the same footing that they are currently. #The Head of State shall take all economic measures that may be necessary for the preservation of the public peace. #The authorities will give at once the oath of independence, distinguishing next Sunday for its publication with the due solemnity. #The Head of State, together with the commanders of the troops, will notify the fortress of Chagres and detachment of Portobelo so that the official who presents the orders delivers these points in military style. #The Isthmus, by means of its representatives, will form the suitable economic regulations for its internal government; and in the meantime they will govern according to the current laws in those parts that do not contradict the current state. #For necessary expenses, the political Head of State will create a loan to be recognized as part of the public debt. #The public debt is recognized by the Treasury and shall be paid under the covenants set forth in its principle. #The preceding chapters will be printed and circulated to all the peoples of the Isthmus to cease the disagreements agitating them; sending the help that this capital needs to carry out this glorious undertaking, as they have offered. ::Signed by: Jos\u00e9 de F\u00e1brega; Jos\u00e9 Hijinio, bishop of Panama; Juan Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez (dean of the cathedral chapter); Dr. Carlos Icaza; Manuel Jos\u00e9 Calvo; Mariano de Arosemena; Luis Lasso de la Vega; Jos\u00e9 Antonio Cerda; Juan Herrera y Torres; Juan Jos\u00e9 Calvo; Narciso de Urriola; Remigio Lasso de la Vega; Manuel de Arce; Jos\u00e9 de Alba; Gregorio G\u00f3mez; Luis Salvador Dur\u00e1n; Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Herrera; Manuel Mar\u00eda de Ayala; V\u00edctor Beltr\u00e1n; Antonio Bermejo; Antonio Plana; Juan P\u00edo Victoria; Dr. Manuel de Urriola; Jos\u00e9 Vallarino; Manuel Jos\u00e9 Hurtado, Manuel Garc\u00eda de Paredes; Dr. Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Arce; Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Calvo; Antonio Escovar; Gaspar Arosemena Jos\u00e9 de los Santos Correoso, public scribe.
