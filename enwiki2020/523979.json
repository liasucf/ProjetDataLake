    "text": "The Hunt Museum () is a museum in the city of Limerick, Ireland. The Hunt Museum holds a personal collection donated by the Hunt family, it was originally situated in the University of Limerick, before being moved to its present location in the Georgian Custom House in 1997. The Custom House is situated on Rutland Street on the banks of the River Shannon at its confluence with the Abbey River. Among the museum's collection are works by notable artists and designers such as Pablo Picasso, Jack B. Yeats, and Sybil Connolly as well as distinctive historical items such as the O'Dea Mitre and Crozier. ==History== As antique dealers and advisors to collectors, John and Gertrude Hunt built a thriving business and also began to acquire pieces that reflected their own interests and curiosity rather than for commercial purposes. During the latter stages of John's life, they became increasingly aware of the scale of their collection and wished that it would remain intact, so they began to search for a permanent home for it. Fortunately they met Professor Patrick Doran of the National Institute of Higher Education (now University of Limerick) and Dr Edward Walsh, the Institute's President, who agreed to house a substantial part of the collection on a temporary basis. The Hunt Museum opened there in 1978 in an exhibition room with the display designed by architect Arthur Gibney. During this period the Irish Government had declined the offer of the Hunt's collection, so the requirement to find a suitable home and owner to take responsibility for the artifacts became more urgent. The Hunt Museums Trust was established in 1974 to hold the Collection and the property at Craggaunowen (a 16th-century four-storey tower house, typical of late medieval Ireland, purchased and restored by John and Gertrude Hunt) in trust on behalf of the people of Ireland. The trust established The Hunt Museum Ltd., the sole purpose of which was the establishment of a permanent home for the museum. Under the chairmanship of Dr Tony Ryan, this company provided the necessary energy to create the museum as we see it today. A public private partnership involving the University of Limerick, Shannon Development, Limerick Corporation and the Department of Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht and the Islands, linked with local business interests secured the historic 18th-century former Customs House in Limerick city together with the funds to restore and renovate the building to international museum standards. The museum was officially opened by the Taoiseach John Bruton on 14 February 1997. It was a moment of great celebration for all concerned but, unfortunately, neither John nor Gertrude Hunt had lived to realise their dream. The museum stands as a monument to their enthusiasm, curiosity and generosity. ==Custom House== Nigh time view of the front of the Custom House from Clancy's Strand. The Custom House is regarded as the most distinguished eighteenth century building in Limerick and it is also rather unusual in comparison to other Georgian buildings in the city in that the exterior of the building is limestone rather than red brick. It is an elegant Palladian-style building designed by the Italian architect, Davis Ducart, in 1765. Both the 'Captain's Room' and 'Red Staircase' are elegant examples of Georgian architecture within the building and are testament to the optimism that the city experienced during the period of development and expansion in the late 18th century. Ducart also designed several other Palladian-style buildings in Ireland including Castletown Cox in Co. Kilkenny and Florence Court in Co. Fermanagh. The Limerick Custom House was the administrative centre for the Revenue Commissioners (including Customs and Excise) in Limerick and it was also the home of the Customs Collector in the eighteenth century. In the 1840s with the introduction of a new postal system a Penny Post Office was opened in the Custom House. The Office of Public Works (OPW) undertook the major restoration and refurbishment of the building completing it in 1996. The Custom House opened as The Hunt Museum on 14 February 1997. The anniversary of the opening of The Hunt Museum is celebrated annually as 'Open Day' with free admission, talks, tours, workshops and other activities. ==Collection== The Hunt Museum holds about 2,500 different artifacts, both from Ireland and abroad. The oldest pieces are from Stone-Age Ireland and ancient Egypt. The collection includes the Antrim Cross (an early 9th-century cast bronze and enamel cross), dresses by Irish designer Sybil Connolly, drawings by Picasso and a bronze horse once thought to be a design by Leonardo da Vinci for a large monument. The bronze horse is similar to the Budapest horse, but its provenance was disproven in 2009. Some of the Hunt collection is also on display at the nearby Craggaunowen in County Clare, which was also greatly contributed to by John and Gertrude Hunt. ===Religious Artifacts=== John Hunt was extremely interested in early Christian art and artifacts and he collected them widely, so the museum collection held many religious items from rosary beads to statues of varying sizes, from not just Ireland but from around Europe. The Museums 'Treasury Room' houses a great number of these items and among the artifacts in this room are the beautiful Arthur Cross and Arthur Chalice. Also found in the collection were significant medieval Christian pieces such as the Antrim Cross, the Cashel Bell, and the Hohenzollern Crucifix. === Sybil Connolly === Heiress dress 1957 by Sybil Connolly - Full Length Front The Sybil Connolly collection at The Hunt Museum is formed by different documents, sketches, letters, photographs, ceramic and textile items. The textile collection is made up for 45 pieces designed by Sybil Connolly during her career. The collection holds iconic dresses like \"Heiress Dress\u201d or \u201cPink Ice Dress\u201d. Gertrude Hunt kindly donated most of the Sybil Connolly collection to the museum. ===Temporary Exhibition Gallery=== Included in the plan to house the Hunt collection in the custom house was also an idea for a purpose built modern gallery space. It was completed as a part of the renovation of the Custom House and is regularly used for temporary exhibitions that accompany the permanent collection. ===Horse Outside=== 'Horse Outside' art installation In 2011 a lifesize model of a horse, painted by young people aged 10\u201318 was placed outside the front of the building. This was joined by a second one in 2012. The models are made of fibreglass, and are taken inside at night. The art installation was inspired by the song Horse Outside by the group The Rubberbandits.Limerick Leader 5 Jul 2012 Limerick\u2019s \u2018Horse Outside\u2019 continues to inspire ==Controversy== In December 2003, the Simon Wiesenthal Center alleged in a letter to President Mary McAleese that the museum's collection contained items looted by the Nazis during the Second World War, although the letter did not refer to any specific items in the collection.Simon Wiesenthal Center allegations.Team probing \u2018Nazi loot\u2019 in museum quits, The Sunday Times, 13 February 2005.Museum launches inquiry over Nazi loot allegations, The Sunday Times, 9 October 2005. The museum denied the claims.Hunt Museum Exonerated; Wiesenthal Center \"Unprofessional\", AP, 28 September 2007. An inquiry led by former Supreme Court judge Donal Barrington was set up by the museum, but its members resigned in February 2005, saying that the museum's funding made an independent inquiry impossible, and requesting that a more appropriate inquiry be created. The Department of Arts then provided \u20ac150,000 in funding for a second inquiry led by former civil servant Se\u00e1n Cromien, under the auspices of the Royal Irish Academy (RIA). The second inquiry was due to submit an interim report to the Royal Irish Academy in November 2005 and did so in February 2006. Meantime, in October 2005, the museum published a catalogue of its exhibits on the internet, providing full details of all the items in its collection. In June 2006, the inquiry submitted the final report, which was published on the RIA's website. Also in June 2006, a one-day conference took place on the theme of Contested Cultural Property and Museums: The Case of the Hunt Museum. At this conference, a message was conveyed from Shimon Samuels, who had sent the original letter to Mary McAleese, questioning why he had not been invited to the seminar. Later, the terms of reference of the Hunt Museum Evaluation Group were questioned, the Simon Wiesenthal Center believing that more emphasis should have been placed on investigating the purported Nazi links of the Hunt family and the Hunt Museum Evaluation Group believing that this lay beyond their terms of reference, which were to do with provenance research. The Royal Irish Academy issued a press release responding to the statement of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. ;Resolution A 2007 reportLynn Nicholas, , Royal Irish Academy, 2007. from American expert Lynn Nicholas, published by the Royal Irish Academy following three years of investigation, called the Wiesenthal Center's allegations \"unprofessional in the extreme.\" Nicholas found that the Wiesenthal Center had misidentified names in the letters. \"The name used, four times in one letter, is Buhl, not Buhrle, and the individual described, an unreliable dealer who sells forgeries, certainly bears no resemblance to the extremely rich collector and armaments manufacturer Emil Buhrle,\" the report said. ==See also== * Limerick City Gallery of Art * Limerick City Museum * List of museums in the Republic of Ireland ==References== ==External links== * *Hunt Museum Evaluation Group final report \u2014 June, 2006 Category:Art museums established in 1978 Category:Art museums and galleries in the Republic of Ireland Category:Museums in County Limerick Category:Egyptological collections in the Republic of Ireland Category:Buildings and structures in Limerick (city) Category:Education in Limerick (city) Category:1978 establishments in Ireland Category:Former private collections ",
