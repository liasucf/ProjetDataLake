The award is decided by a jury composed of Spanish journalists and Italian news correspondents located in Spain. The name of the prize comes from the Italian painter, Lorenzo Tiepolo, who spent much of his life in Madrid, where he completed several frescoes for the Royal Palace and died in 1770. The first edition of the Premio Tiepolo was celebrated in 1996 at the Italian Embassy in Madrid. On that occasion the winners were Cesare Romiti, President of the Fiat Group and Isidoro \u00c1lvarez, President of El Corte Ingles. thumb The Premio Tiepolo award ceremony is organized by CCIS, located in Madrid, and since the year 2000 by the Spanish Confederation of Business Organisations (CEOE) of Madrid as well. ==Prizewinners== Source: C\u00e1mara de Comercio Italiano * 1996 - Cesare Romiti, President of Fiat Group and Isidoro \u00c1lvarez, President of El Corte Ingl\u00e9s * 1997 - Giorgio Fossa, President of Confindustria and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cuevas, President of CEOE * 1998 - Antonio Fazio, Governor of Bank of Italy and Luis \u00c1ngel Rojo, Governor of Bank of Spain. * 1999 - Giovanni Agnelli, Honorary President of Fiat Group and Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez Asia\u00edn, President of BBV Foundation. * 2000 - Luciano Benetton, President of Benetton Group and Luis Alberto Salazar Simpson, President of Amena * 2001 - Marco Tronchetti Provera, President of Pirelli Group and Rodolfo Mart\u00edn Villa, President of Endesa Spain. * 2002 - Pier Luigi Fabrizi, President of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena and Gabriele Burgio, President of NH Hotel Group and Jos\u00e9 Vilarasau Salat, President of La Caixa. * 2003 - Vittorio Mincato, Chief Executive Officer of ENI Group and Alfonso Cortina, President of Repsol YPF * 2004 - Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, President of Ferrari and Florentino P\u00e9rez, President of Real Madrid F.C.. * 2005 - Mario Monti, Dean of Bocconi University of Milan and Rodrigo Rato, Chief Executive Officer of the International Monetary Fund. * 2006 - Francesco Morelli, President of the European Design Institute and Jes\u00fas Salazar Bello, President of SOS Group * 2007 - Antoine Bernheim, President of Generali and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Mart\u00ednez, President of Mapfre * 2008 - Paolo Vasile, Chief Executive Officer of Gestevisi\u00f3n Telecinco and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Lara Bosch, President of Planeta Group * 2009 - Fulvio Conti, Director General of Enel and C\u00e9sar Alierta Izuel, Executive President of Telef\u00f3nica S.A. * 2010 - Massimo Moratti, President of Inter Milan F.C. and Enrique Cerezo, President of Football club Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid S.A.D. * 2011 - Gilberto Benetton, President of Autogrill - Antonio V\u00e1zquez, President of Iberia * 2012 \u2013 Alberto Bombassei, President of Brembo and Borja Prado, President of Endesa. * 2013 - Pietro Salini, President of Salini Impregilo and Juan-Miguel Villar Mir, President of OHL. * 2014 - S.M. el Rey Don Juan Carlos * 2015 - Alfredo Altavilla, COO EMEA of the FCA group and Joan Rosell, President of CEOE * 2016 - Francesco Monti, President of Esprinet and Francisco Reyn\u00e9s, Vice-president and CEO of Abertis and President of Cellnex Telecom * 2017 - Urbano Cairo, President and CEO of RCS MediaGroup and Antonio Huertas, President of Mapfre * 2018 - Luigi Lana, President of Reale Group and Antonio Hern\u00e1ndez Callejas, President of Ebro Foods * 2019 - Marco Alver\u00e0, CEO of Snam and Antonio Llard\u00e9n, President of Enag\u00e1s ==See also== * List of economics awards ==References== Category:Spanish awards Category:Italian awards Category:Economics awards ",
