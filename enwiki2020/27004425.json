    "text": "Nassarius globosus, common name the globose nassa, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Nassariidae, the Nassa mud snails or dog whelks. ==Description== The length of the shell varies between 9 mm and 28 mm. The small shell is ovate, thick and slightly gibbous. The spire is short and pointed. It is composed of six slightly convex whorls, covered with longitudinal folds and very approximate transverse striae, which form flattened granulations. The body whorl is very large. The ovate aperture is emarginated at the upper part, at its union with the outer lip, which is rather thin, and striated internally. The columella is arcuated, covered by the inner lip, which is enlarged into a whitish, wide, and thick callosity, upon the body of the lbody whorl. The color of this shell is of a reddish brown, with one or two transverse bands upon the middle of the body whorl.Kiener (1840).
