October 18, 1982. Vol. 18, No. 16. Rick Jason, co-star of Combat!, wrote in his memoirs that Morrow \"had an absolute dislike of firearms. He used a Thompson submachine gun in our series, but that was work. In any other respect he'd have nothing to do with them.\" ==Death== In 1982, Morrow was cast in a feature role in Twilight Zone: The Movie, in a segment directed by John Landis. Morrow was playing the role of Bill Connor, a racist who is taken back in time and placed in various situations where he would be a persecuted victim: as a Jewish man in Vichy France, a black man about to be lynched by the Ku Klux Klan, and a Vietnamese man about to be killed by U.S. soldiers. In the early morning hours of July 23, 1982, Morrow and two child actors, seven-year-old Myca Dinh Le and six- year-old Renee Shin-Yi Chen, were filming on location in California, in an area that was known as Indian Dunes, near Santa Clarita. They were performing in a scene for the Vietnam sequence, in which their characters attempt to escape out of a deserted Vietnamese village from a pursuing U.S. Army helicopter. The helicopter was hovering at approximately above them when the heat from special effect pyrotechnic explosions reportedly delaminated the rotor blades and caused the helicopter to plummet and crash on top of them, killing all three instantly. Morrow and Le were decapitated and mutilated by the helicopter rotor blades, while Chen was crushed by a helicopter skid. Landis and four other defendants, including the helicopter pilot Dorsey Wingo, were ultimately acquitted of involuntary manslaughter after a nearly nine- month trial. The parents of Le and Chen sued and settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Both of Morrow's daughters also sued and settled for an undisclosed amount. Morrow is interred in Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.Calisphere ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" background: #f9f9f9; |- align=\"center\" ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Notes |- |rowspan=2|1955 | Blackboard Jungle | Artie West | |- | It's a Dog's Life | Wildfire the dog | Voice, Uncredited |- |rowspan=3|1956 | Tribute to a Bad Man | Lars Peterson | |- | The Millionaire | Joey Diamond | Episode: \"The Joey Diamond Story\" |- | Climax! | Ted | Episode: \"Strange Hostage\" |- |rowspan=2|1957 | Men in War | Corporal James Zwickley | |- | Alfred Hitchcock Presents | Benny Mungo | Episode \"A Little Sleep\" |- |rowspan=4|1958 | Richard Diamond, Private Detective | Joe Rovi | Episode: \"The Ed Church Case\" |- | Hell's Five Hours | Burt Nash | |- | King Creole | Shark | |- | God's Little Acre | Shaw Walden | |- | 1958-1959 | The Rifleman | Johnny Cotton | ABC-TV, 2 episodes |- |rowspan=2|1959 | Naked City | David Greco | ABC-TV, Episode: \"The Shield\" |- | Johnny Ringo | Bill Stoner | CBS-TV, Episode: \"Kid With a Gun\" |- |rowspan=3|1960 | The Brothers Brannagan | Locke | Syndicated TV, series premiere, Episode: \"Tune in for Murder\" |- | The Barbara Stanwyck Show | Leroy Benson | NBC-TV, Episode: \"The Key to the Killer\" |- | Cimarron | Wes Jennings | |- | 1960-1961 | Bonanza | Lassiter / Ab Brock | 2 episodes |- | 1960-1962 | The Untouchables | Vince Shirer / Collier | 2 episodes |- |rowspan=4|1961 | Posse from Hell | Crip | |- | The Law and Mr. Jones | Dr. Bigelow | ABC-TV, Episode: \"A Very Special Citizen\" |- | Portrait of a Mobster | Dutch Schultz | |- | The Tall Man | Skip Farrell | NBC-TV, Episode: \"Time of Foreshadowing\" |- | 1962 | The New Breed | Belman | ABC-TV, Episode: \"To Sell Another Human Being\" |- | 1962\u20131967 | Combat! | Sergeant Chip Saunders | ABC-TV, 152 episodes |- | 1969 | Target: Harry | Harry Black | Alternative titles: What's In it For Harry?, How to Make It |- |rowspan=3|1970 | A Man Called Sledge | Gold Guard Scout | Uncredited |- | The Immortal | Sheriff Dan W.
