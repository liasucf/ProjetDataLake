    "text": "Foetus is a solo musical project of Australian musician JG Thirlwell. The project has had many similar names, each including the word \"foetus\". The \"members\" of the project are aliases of Thirlwell; they include Frank Want, Phillip Toss, and Clint Ruin. Thirlwell occasionally collaborates with other artists, but does not consider them members of Foetus. In 1981 after the breakup of PragVEC, Thirlwell started his own solo music project under the name of \"Foetus Under Glass.\" After the album \"Thaw\" Thirlwell stopped changing the name and kept it as Foetus. In November 1983, Foetus undertook a tour with Marc Almond, Nick Cave and Lydia Lunch in the quickly dissolved 'partnership' known as The Immaculate Consumptive. He has also appeared on albums recorded by The The, Einsturzende Neubauten, Nurse With Wound and Anne Hogan. Gash was issued in 1995, which led to acknowledgment from music journalists of Foetus's role in the development of industrial music. ==Discography== *Deaf \u2013 1981 \u2013 You've Got Foetus on Your Breath *Ache \u2013 1982 \u2013 You've Got Foetus on Your Breath *Hole \u2013 1984 \u2013 Scraping Foetus Off the Wheel *Nail \u2013 1985 \u2013 Scraping Foetus off the Wheel *Thaw \u2013 1988 \u2013 Foetus Interruptus *Gash \u2013 1995 \u2013 Foetus *Flow \u2013 2001 \u2013 Foetus *Love \u2013 2005 \u2013 Foetus *Vein \u2013 2007 \u2013 Foetus *Hide \u2013 2010 \u2013 Foetus *Soak \u2013 2013 \u2013 Foetus ==Conceptual themes== All full-length Foetus album titles are four-letter, one-syllable words, often with multiple connotations. The artwork of Foetus releases shows a deliberate progression of colour: the earliest releases are black and white, with the addition of red on the Deaf album, and further addition of yellow on Nail. Full-colour art was introduced on Gash. Beginning with Flow, the artwork of primary albums reverted to black/white/red, although other releases continue in full colour. ==References== ==Notes== ==External links== * Official Home Page * 1995 Interview with J.
