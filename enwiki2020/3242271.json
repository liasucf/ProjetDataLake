Two extrasolar planet candidates have been detected in orbit around this star. == Planetary system == In 2002, the discovery of the planet HD 128311 b was announced by Paul Butler. In 2005, the discovery of a second planet HD 128311 c was announced by Steve Vogt. Most likely, the system has been formed in a very turbulent disc. The authors were able to show with both analytic and numerical models that certain libration modes are readily excited by turbulence. It was initially thought that the system could have been resulted from planet planet scattering, but this is rather unlikely. Time evolution of orbital elements in the system HD128311. This left panel in this plot shows the most likely formation scenario for the planetary system. The right panel shows the observed orbital configuration. == See also == *List of extrasolar planets ==References== * ==External links== * GJ 3860 * Extrasolar Planet Interactions by Rory Barnes & Richard Greenberg, Lunar and Planetary Lab, University of Arizona * Image HD 128311 Category:Bo\u00f6tes Category:K-type main-sequence stars 128311 071395 Category:Planetary systems with two confirmed planets Bo\u00f6tis, HN Category:BY Draconis variables Category:Durchmusterung objects Category:Gliese and GJ objects ",
