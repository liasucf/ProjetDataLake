    "text": "James Wheals is a British auto racing driver. In 1993 he competed in one round of the British Touring Car Championship Official 1993 BTCC standings at Snetterton with a Ford Sierra Sapphire. His race lasted just two laps, when he retired due to engine failure. The car was sold on to Bob Berridge, who drove the car for the rest of that season. He runs his own Lynnspeed racing team based in King's Lynn, which has helped the racing career of his son Jay, who has also competed in the BTCC. ==Complete BTCC results== (key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%\" !
