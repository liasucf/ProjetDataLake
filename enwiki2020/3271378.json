    "text": "Notre Dame de Namur University (NDNU) is a private Catholic university in Belmont, California. It is the third oldest college in California and the first college in the state authorized to grant the baccalaureate degree to women. The university has begun winding down operations and may close after the 2021 spring semester. The university is organized into three schools: the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Business and Management, and the School of Education and Leadership. Notre Dame de Namur University offers 15 undergraduate degrees, 10 graduate degrees and four credentials. In addition to traditional undergraduate and graduate programs, the university offers an evening bachelor's degree completion program for working adults as well as online degree programs. ==History== Notre Dame de Namur University was founded by the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur as the Academy of Notre Dame in 1851 on 10 acres in San Jose, California. The school was chartered in 1868 as the College of Notre Dame, the first college in the state of California authorized to grant the baccalaureate degree to women. In 1922, the Sisters purchased Ralston Hall, the country estate of William Chapman Ralston, founder of the Bank of California. The college opened its doors in Belmont in 1923. In 1953 the College of Notre Dame became a four-year college with 23 Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur involved in the school. The college introduced evening classes in 1955, and in 1965, started the teaching credential programs. Originally a women's institution, College of Notre Dame became coeducational in 1969; three men graduated as part of the class of 1970. The college expanded its offerings to include master's degrees in 1972 and added evening undergraduate programs in 1987. In 2001, the college established a structure dividing the university into schools. The name of the institution was changed to Notre Dame de Namur University that same year. In 2009, the university began offering partnerships with local community colleges to provide greater access to higher education, and that same year it became a Hispanic-Serving Institution, meaning at least 25% of its undergraduate population is Hispanic, that same year. The online degree program was established in 2012, and in 2013, the university introduced one of the first PhD programs in art therapy in the nation. The university established a new campus in Tracy, California in 2015, offering evening undergraduate and graduate degree programs in business administration. Launched in 2013, Notre Dame de Namur University was one of the first universities in the United States to offer a Ph.D. in Art Therapy. The Art Therapy Ph.D. is also the first doctoral program offered at the university. In 2016 the faculty, both full-time and adjunct, unionized with SEIU 1021. This was a historic move since tenure-line professors at Catholic universities have had trouble unionizing since the Yeshiva ruling (1980). In December 2017, BINA48 (a Hanson Robotics robot) successfully participated as a guest student in a full semester college course on philosophy and love created and taught by Professor William J. Barry at Notre Dame de Namur University. The robot used an algorithm framework called TQ Theory created by Professor Barry to interact with rapport with students. In March 2020, the university announced major changes as a result of on-going financial issues, declining enrollment, and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Board of Trustees made the decision to prioritize current students completing degrees by the end of the 2020\u201321 academic year while assisting other students in transfer options due to uncertainty of operations beyond the spring 2021 semester. As part of the plan, Notre Dame suspended new student admissions for summer and fall 2020 sessions. The university also disbanded the athletics department at the conclusion of the 2019\u201320 academic year. ==Campus== Notre Dame de Namur University is located in Belmont, California on the San Francisco Bay Area Peninsula and near the Pacific Ocean. The campus is less than 30 miles from downtown San Francisco and downtown San Jose. ===Residence halls=== Notre Dame de Namur University offers traditional dorm living in Julie Billiart Hall and St. Joseph's Hall, which are named for the co-foundresses of the Sisters of Notre Dame, Sister Julie Billiart and Sister St. Joseph Blin de Bourdon. The Carroll, Kane, and Wilkie Apartments are available for upperclassmen. Students also have the option of suite living in New Hall, where suites feature four rooms joined by a common area and sharing a bathroom. Residence hall floors are co-ed.Named Buildings. Notre Dame de Namur University, 2011. Saint Joseph's hall has now been transformed into faculty offices and also contains a lounge and the Housing Office. ===Academic buildings=== Cuvilly Hall, named for Sr. Julie Billiart's birthplace, is one of the main instructional buildings and houses the School of Business and Management. St. Mary's Hall is the largest instructional building and includes classrooms; science labs; two computer labs; public safety; and the financial aid, registrar, and business offices. Gavin Hall is the smallest of the three main instructional buildings and houses the Art Therapy program. The theater of Notre Dame de Namur University is located below the main campus on Ralston Avenue. ===Ralston Hall Mansion=== Ralston Hall The Notre Dame de Namur University campus developed around Ralston Hall Mansion. William Chapman Ralston built Ralston Hall shortly after purchasing the property in 1864.\"Ralston Hall Mansion | A Celebrated History.\" Ralston Hall Mansion | A Celebrated History. Ralston Hall Mansion, 2013. Web. 27 Sept. 2013 William Ralston was a pivotal figure in the gold and silver bonanzas, which helped Ralston amass wealth. Ralston Hall was built with a steamboat gothic design on the interior, which is rumored to have been influenced by Ralston's love of boating from a young age.\"Ralston Hall Mansion | A Celebrated History.\" Ralston Hall Mansion | A Celebrated History. Ralston Hall Mansion, 2013. Web. 27 Sept. 2013. The interior of Ralston Hall is strikingly shaped like the inside of a boat. Ralston Hall was built as an entertainment destination. After William Ralston died, his business partner, William Sharon, came to control the mansion. Sharon was a United States Senator representing Nevada from 1875 to 1881. Ralston Hall has been used for a variety of jobs throughout its history; Ralston Hall held one of the largest American weddings when William Sharon's daughter Flora married Sir Thomas Fermor-Hesketh of England. Notre Dame De Namur was chartered by the State of California in 1868 but was not affiliated with Ralston Hall until 1922. The mansion was a finishing school for young women until 1898.\"Historic Architecture Campus Project.\" Historic Colleges. N.p., Jan. 2013. Web. 16 Sept. 2013. Since 1923 Ralston Hall has been affiliated with Notre Dame de Namur University. Until April 2012, the mansion housed admissions, administrative and faculty offices, and its first floor rooms, including a ballroom modeled after the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, were rented for events. However, in late 2011, a preliminary assessment of the structural integrity of Ralston Hall suggested that occupants may not be safe in the event of an earthquake. The building is unoccupied indefinitely, until funds can be raised to complete a replacement or retrofit of the masonry foundation, in addition to extensive seismic work on the upper floors. The renovation is estimated to cost more than $20 million ===Satellite programs=== Notre Dame de Namur University offers some bachelor's degree programs in partnership with local community college campuses. Adult students who have completed enough units to enter Notre Dame de Namur University's evening bachelor's program can take the remaining classes for their bachelor's degree on the community college campus and receive a degree from NDNU. The university established a partnership with Mission College in Santa Clara, California in 2008 and offers a human services and a business degree on the community college campus. A human services program was established with Ca\u00f1ada College in Redwood City, California in 2009. In 2010, evening business and psychology degrees were added to the partnership with Ca\u00f1ada College. In 2015, the university launched a satellite campus in Tracy, California. The NDNU Tracy campus offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs in business administration, a bachelor's in human services, as well as teaching credentials. The classes are held in the evening in an accelerated format. ==Organization and administration== Notre Dame de Namur University is a nonprofit organization governed by a Board of Trustees.
