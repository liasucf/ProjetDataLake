Managed by City of Boroondara council, the park consists of a popular playground, walking & cycling tracks, and two ovals for teams playing Archery, Cricket, and Soccer. The park is also sometimes referred to as 'Kilby Park' due to its proximity to Kilby Road, and 'Glass Creek' due to the creek of the same name that passes through.http://kewhistoricalsociety.org.au/khs/wp- content/uploads/newsletters/KHS%E2%80%8B_Ne%E2%80%8Bwsl%E2%80%8Bett%E2%80%8Ber_%E2%80%8B201%E2%80%8B5_2.pdf ==Sport== Old Xaverians SC (left) and Plenty Valley Lions FC (right) observing a minute silence before a Victorian State League Division 4 Reserves match at Hays Paddock, 27 April 2019 ==History== The creek of Glass Creek passes through the parkland, entering from the south-east corner of the park and exiting through the central west-end underneath the Eastern Freeway.
