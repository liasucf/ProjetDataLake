    "text": "The Palacette of Viscounts of Balsem\u00e3o () is a former-residence in the civil parish of Cedofeita, Santo Ildefonso, S\u00e9, Miragaia, S\u00e3o Nicolau e Vit\u00f3ria, in the northern Portuguese city of Porto. ==History== The coat-of-arms of the Viscount of Trindade The residenace of the Viscounts of Balsem\u00e3o and Trindade along the 'Pra\u00e7a Carlos Alberto'' In the second-half of the 18th century, the residence was constructed by nobleman Jos\u00e9 Alvo Brand\u00e3o, along the then- designated Largo dos Ferradores. Following the 1800 wedding of D. Maria Rosa Alvo and her cousin/step-brother, Lu\u00eds M\u00e1ximo Alfredo Pinto de Sousa Coutinho (later the second Viscount of Balsem\u00e3o) the house passed into the hands of the Balsem\u00e3o family. Between 1834 and 1837, following the death of the second Viscount, the spaces were used provisionally to house the Academia Polit\u00e9cnica do Porto (Poly-technic Academy of Porto), while the old Academy was occupied by the military hospital, during the Liberal Wars. In 1840, Ant\u00f3nio Bernardino Pexe (or Peixe) rented the building, and transferred to the site, his lodging from Rua do Bonjardim. In April 1849, Charles Albert of Sardinia, King of Sardinia, took refuge in Portugal during this time, following his defeat at the Battle of Novara. While his home was being prepared, the former-king installed his residence at the Palacette. In 1852, the square began to be re- designated Pra\u00e7a Carlos Alberto for the former monarch. Two years later it was acquired by the 1st Viscount of Trindade, Jos\u00e9 Ant\u00f3nio de Sousa Basto, a great property-owner and capitalist, he complete a complete renovation of the building. Between 1885 and 1886, painter Francisco Jos\u00e9 Resende executed four paintings for the Viscount (portraits of D. Lu\u00eds I, Queen D. Maria Pia, Prince D. Carlos and the Infante D. Afonso) ordered by counsel Jos\u00e9 Guilherme Pacheco, that later found their way to various municipal buildings. In 1862, the King D. Lu\u00eds I and Queen D. Maria Pia, went to the palacette to visit King Carlos Alberto, grandfather of D. Maria Pia. Throughout the 20th century, the building was expanded, renovated and modernized to support the activities on the site. Following the Republican revolution, in 1907 the Gas Company of Lisbon began operating from the site, eventually assuming the role of the municipal services of Porto by 1920, responsible for gas and electricity. It was only in 1959 that the municipal council of Porto bought the building from the descendants of the Viscount of Trindade. In 1989, its descendant, EDP (the national energy/electricity producer), moved out of the building. The municipal council installed the Culture Directorate (Dire\u00e7\u00e3o de Cultura) in the building in 1996. In 2004, the Resende portraits were re-united, restored and placed on exhibition in the palacette once more. ==Architecture== An oblique view of the residence A view from the atrium with lateral staircase The former-residence is implanted in the northeast corner of Pra\u00e7a Carlos Alberto, delimited laterally by the Travessa das Oliveiras and encircled by buildings dating from the 18th and 19th century.
