    "text": "Wesley Pionteck Souza (born 14 April 1996), simply known as Wesley, is a Brazilian footballer who plays for Botafogo-SP. Mainly a winger, he can also play as a wing back. ==Club career== Born in Orl\u00e2ndia, S\u00e3o Paulo, Wesley graduated with Botafogo-SP's youth setup, after being a sprinter when young. He made his senior debuts in 2014, appearing in that year's Copa Paulista. After being one of the Botafogo's best performers in the 2015 Copa S\u00e3o Paulo de Futebol J\u00fanior (in which the club finished second), Wesley made his professional debut on 31 January, starting and assisting Rodrigo Andrade in a 1\u20130 away win against Rio Claro for the Campeonato Paulista championship. He scored his first goal on 8 February, netting his team's only in a 1\u20131 home draw against Ponte Preta. Wesley finished the tournament with 14 appearances and one goal, and was linked to Flamengo, Palmeiras and Lille OSC. On 27 May, however, it was confirmed that Botafogo-SP had sold the majority of his rights to an investment group, BMG, who placed him with Santos in their Under 23 team. During the 2017 season, Wesley had a secondary loan spell at his former club Botafogo-SP. He was the top goalscorer for the side during the 2017 S\u00e9rie C. As a result he signed a further loan agreement for the 2018 season with the club. In December he agreed a contract with Bragantino for the 2019 season. He became part of the Red Bull Bragantino squad when CA Bragantino merged with Red Bull Brasil in April 2019. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|State League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Botafogo-SP |2014 |Paulista |colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1All appearance(s) in Copa Paulista||0||1||0 |- |2015 |S\u00e9rie D |0||0||14||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||14||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!14!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!1!!0!!15!!1 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Santos |2015 |rowspan=\"2\"|S\u00e9rie A |0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- |2016 |0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||13||0||13||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!13!!0!!13!!0 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Botafogo-SP |2017 |rowspan=\"2\"|S\u00e9rie C |12||6||9||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||21||8 |- |2018 |0||0||5||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !12!!6!!14!!2!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!26!!8 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Red Bull Bragantino |2019 |S\u00e9rie B |32||5||13||4||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||45||9 |- |2020 |S\u00e9rie A |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !32!!5!!13!!4!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!45!!9 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !44!!12!!41!!7!!0!!0!!0!!0!!14!!0!!99!!19 |} == Honours == ;Bragantino *Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B: 2019 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:People from Orl\u00e2ndia Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B players Category:Botafogo Futebol Clube (SP) players Category:Santos FC players Category:Clube Atl\u00e9tico Bragantino players Category:Red Bull Bragantino players ",
