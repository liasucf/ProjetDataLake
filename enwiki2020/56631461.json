    "text": "On February 18, 2018, a 22-year-old man local to the Russia\u2019s southern republic of Dagestan carrying a knife and a double-barreled shotgun opened fire on a crowd at an Orthodox church in Kizlyar, killing five women and injuring several other people, including two police and three others. He was shot and killed by police on duty nearby. The attack occurred as churchgoers celebrated the Sunday of Forgiveness, the last day of Cheesefare week, a Christian holiday marking the last day before Lent according to the eastern Orthodox calendar. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) named the man Khalil al-Dagestani, one of its soldiers. Police named him Khalil Khalilov. Pro-ISIL social media later shared a video of a masked man with a shotgun and knife, said to be the killer, pledging his allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. ==References== Category:2018 mass shootings in Europe Category:21st-century mass murder in Russia Category:Anti-Christian sentiment in Europe Category:February 2018 crimes in Europe Category:February 2018 events in Russia Category:History of Dagestan Category:Insurgency in the North Caucasus Category:ISIL terrorist incidents Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2018 Category:Islamist attacks on churches Category:Mass murder in 2018 Category:Mass murder in Russia Category:Mass shootings in Russia Category:Terrorism in Europe Category:Islamic terrorism in Europe Category:Persecution of Christians by Muslims Category:Terrorist incidents in Russia in 2018 ",
