    "text": "The 2019\u201320 Eredivisie Vrouwen is the tenth season of the Netherlands women's professional football league. The season takes place from 23 August 2019 to 22 May 2020 with eight teams. Twente started the season as defending champions. ==COVID-19 pandemic== On 12 March 2020, all football leagues were suspended until 31 March as the Dutch government forbade events due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. On 15 March this period was extended until 6 April. Due to the decision of the Dutch government to forbid all gatherings and events until 1 June 2020, this period was even further extended. The Dutch government announced on 21 April that all events subject to authorization, would remain forbidden at least until 1 September 2020. As a result, the KNVB announced the same day, the intention not to continue all remaining suspended competitions. A final decision would be taken after consultation with the UEFA and next the consequences would be discussed with the clubs involved. On 24 April 2020 the season was cancelled. == Format == At the regular season, the eight teams play each other twice (once at home and once away), for a total of 14 matches each. After that the top four teams qualify for a championship play-off and the bottom four teams play a placement play-off. In each play- off, teams played each other twice for a total of 6 matches each. Points accumulated at the regular season are halved and added to the points of the play-off stage rounds. There is no relegation nor promotion in the league and the champion and runner-up qualify for the 2020\u201321 UEFA Women's Champions League. == Teams == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team !
