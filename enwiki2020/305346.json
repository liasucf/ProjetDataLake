In addition, Bowen Island is within the jurisdiction of the Islands Trust. Located in Howe Sound, Bowen Island is approximately wide by long, with the island at its closest point about west of the mainland. There is regular ferry service from Horseshoe Bay, as well as semi-regular water taxi services. The population of 3,680Bowen Island population - 2016 Census is supplemented in the summer by roughly 1,500 visitors, as Bowen Island is a popular vacation home location for British Columbians. Approximately 500 workers and over 200 students commute to offices and schools on the mainland each day. The island has a land area of 49.94 km2 (19.28 sq mi). ==History== ===Indigenous peoples=== The name for Bowen Island is Nex\u0331wl\u00e9lex\u0331m in the Squamish language of the Squamish people.Squamish Nation \"Skwxwu7mesh Snichim-Xweliten Snichim Skexwts / Squamish-English Dictionary\", Published 2011. pg.235. The Squamish peoples used and occupied the area around Howe Sound including Bowen Island.Squamish Nation \"Skwxwu7mesh Snichim-Xweliten Snichim Skexwts / Squamish-English Dictionary\", Published 2011. pg.x. Areas such as Snug Cove and a few other parts of the island were used as campsites for hunting and gathering trips. Historically they would use the warmer spring and summer months to travel to resource gathering sites and move from their permanent winter villages. Bowen Island has a traditional name in the Squamish language, Xwl\u00edl\u2019xhwm, translating to \"Fast Drumming Ground\",A short history of Bowen Island although some authors attribute the name to the sound made by the ocean as it passes through the tiny pass between the Island\u2019s northern point and Finisterre Island. The tide rushing in and out is reminiscent of the sound of drums beating quickly. The name \"Kw\u00e9m\u0313shem\" is used for Hood Point. Bowen is still used by people from Squamish and Musqueam for deer hunting. Into the 20th century Bowen Island was actively used by Squamish people for deer and duck hunting, fishing and, later, wage jobs. In conversations with Vancouver archivist Major Matthews in the 1950s, August Jack Khatsahlano recalled knowing several Squamish who worked for whalers on the island at the turn of the 20th century. In a conversation with City of Vancouver archivist JA Matthews, Khatsahlano recalled deer hunting on Bowen, saying that at one time he took the biggest deer in British Columbia from the island, weighing in at . ===Post-colonization=== When Spanish explorers arrived on the west coast of Canada, they named many of the features of what is now the Strait of Georgia. Bowen Island was called Isla de Apodaca (after the Mexican town of Apodaca, in northeast Nuevo Le\u00f3n state \u2013 itself named after a benevolent bishop, Salvador de Apodaca y Loreto) by the Spanish Captain Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Narv\u00e1ez in July, 1791. In 1860 Cpt. George Henry Richards renamed the island after Rear Admiral James Bowen master of HMS Queen Charlotte. In 1871 homesteaders began to build houses and started a brickworks, which supplied bricks to the expanding city of Vancouver. Over the years, local industry has included an explosives factory, logging, mining, and milling, although there is no heavy industry on the island at present. The island was named by Captain Richards for Rear- Admiral James Bowen who was the master of HMS Queen Charlotte. ===20th century=== In the first half of the 20th century, life on Bowen was dominated by a resort operated by the Terminal Steamship Company (1900 - 1920) and the Union Steamship Company (1920 - 1962). These companies provided steamer service to Vancouver, and the Horseshoe Bay - Bowen Island Ferry began in 1921. When the Union Steamship resort closed in the 1960s the island returned to a quiet period of slow growth. In the 1940s and 1950s, the artists' colony called Lieben was a retreat for many famous Canadian authors, artists, and intellectuals including Earle Birney, Alice Munro, Dorothy Livesay, Margaret Laurence, A.J.M. Smith, Jack Shadbolt, Eric Nicol and Malcolm Lowry, who finished his last book, October Ferry to Gabriola, there. In the 1980s, real estate pressures in Vancouver accelerated growth on Bowen and currently the local economy is largely dependent on commuters who work on the mainland in Greater Vancouver. Prior to becoming a municipality, Bowen Island was part of the Sunshine Coast Regional District, made up of small communities and municipalities. However, in the 1980s the island transferred to the Greater Vancouver Regional District after a campaign organized by developers and realtors. A campaign to make the island an autonomous municipality was successful after two referendum attempts. In 1999 the Bowen Island Municipality was incorporated, becoming the second \"island municipality\" in BC. The first was Saltspring Island which was incorporated in 1873 and dissolved by the BC legislature 10 years later. ==Commerce== Bowen Island is served by a number of small businesses including marinas, cafes, gift shops, grocery stores, a post office, pharmacy, restaurants, garden and flower shops, and a building supply yard.
