It operates scheduled and charter passenger flights mainly from its base at St. Gallen-Altenrhein Airport in Switzerland. ==History== Founded as People's Viennaline in 2010, the first revenue flight of the company took place on 27 March 2011. For several years, People's only operated a single scheduled route between its homebase and Vienna. However, the route network has since been expanded with some seasonal and charter services. In November 2016, People's inaugurated the world's shortest international jet route (and, after St. Maarten-Anguilla, second shortest international route overall). The flight from St. Gallen-Altenrhein Airport, Switzerland to Friedrichshafen Airport, Germany took only eight minutes of flight over Lake Constance and could\u2018ve been booked individually. The airline faced severe criticism for this service from politicians and environmental organisations. This leg was part of its then new St.Gallen/Altenrhein-Friedrichshafen-Cologne/Bonn service.http://www.aero.de/news-25346/Peoples-Ritt-ueber-den-Bodensee.html However, this entire route has been terminated entirely by the mid of April 2017 due to low passenger numbers.austrianwings.info - \"People's Viennaline gives up Friedrichshafen and Cologne/Bonn\" (German) 31 March 2017 Shortly after, the airline announced plans to terminate its last remaining route from Friedrichshafen (to Vienna) as well.airliners.de - \"People's Viennaline pulls out of Friedrichshafen\" (German) 3 April 2017 In May 2018, People's Viennaline announced a rebrand to the shortened People's in order to reflect their widened route network.ch-aviation.com - Austria's People's Viennaline rebrands as People's 18 May 2018 In October 2019, the airline announced major restructuring measures mainly consisting of the phase-out of one of their two aircraft and the closure of all charter operations outside of their St. Gallen/Althenrhein base.aerotelegraph.com - \"People's shrinks to one aircraft\" (German) 22 October 2019 ==Destinations== People's previous branding as People's Viennaline Check-in area of People's at their home base St. Gallen\u2013Altenrhein Airport People's Embraer 170 ===Current destinations=== As of October 2019, People's operates one year-round scheduled route and some seasonal scheduled and charter services:peoples.ch - Timetable retrieved 22 October 2018 ;Austria *Vienna - Vienna International Airport ;Croatia *Pula - Pula Airport, seasonal ;Greece *Cephalonia - Cephalonia International Airport, seasonal *Preveza - Aktion National Airport, seasonal ;Italy *Cagliari - Cagliari Elmas Airport, seasonal charter *Olbia - Costa Smeralda Airport, seasonal charter *Naples - Naples International Airport, seasonal ;Spain *Palma de Mallorca - Palma de Mallorca Airport, seasonal *Ibiza - Ibiza Airport, seasonal *Menorca - Menorca Airport, seasonal ;Switzerland *St. Gallen - St. Gallen-Altenrhein Airport, base ===Terminated destinations=== *Bern - Bern Airport, seasonal charter *Corsica - Calvi \u2013 Sainte-Catherine Airport, seasonal charter *Memmingen - Memmingen Airport, seasonal charter *Salzburg - Salzburg Airport, seasonal charterhttp://www.austrianaviation.net/detail/peoples-fliegt-charterfluege-ab- salzburg/ *Zurich - Zurich Airport, seasonal charterhttps://peoples.ch/destinationen/menorca ==Fleet== As of August 2019, People's operates the following aircraft: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border- collapse:collapse;text-align:center\" |+ People's fleet |- !Aircraft !In service !Orders !Passengers !Notes |- |Embraer 170 |2 | |76peoples.ch - Flotte (German) retrieved 3 April 2017 |1 to be phased out |- |- !Total !2 ! ! !colspan=\"4\"| |} ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Airlines of Austria Category:Airlines established in 2010 ",
