    "text": "\"Later\" is the twelfth and final episode of the first season of the American animated television series BoJack Horseman. It was written by Raphael Bob- Waksberg and directed by Martin Cendreda. The episode was released in the United States, along with the rest of season one, via Netflix on August 22, 2014. John Krasinski provides his voice in a guest appearance in the episode. ==Plot== In 1973, BoJack sends a personal question to his idol celebrity Secretariat on what to do when he's sad. Secretariat responds to the question on a talk show by telling BoJack to always look forward in life, and forget about the past. One month later, Secretariat commits suicide by jumping off the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge after he was caught betting on his own horse races. In the present, months after BoJack's memoir has been released, BoJack receives the Golden Globe for \"Best Comedy or Musical,\" despite his book not being a film nor show. Due to the success of his book and his new fame, BoJack decides to star in a film about Secretariat and manages to convince Lenny Turteltaub to produce the film, but he loses the part to Andrew Garfield. Meanwhile, Diane has to choose whether to travel to a foreign country to write a book about philanthropist Sebastian St. Clair or to be the character consultant for the Secretariat film. She decides the latter. After Garfield suffers an accident and breaks \"every bone in his body,\" BoJack is contacted by director Kelsey Jannings and is told he can play Secretariat in the film. BoJack visits the Griffith Park Observatory, where he is told by a fan that he's his \"hero.\" ==Reception== The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Les Chappell, writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode a B+. He praised the development of BoJack's character, from the beginning of the series all the way to the finale, stating that \"[BoJack] began the series incapable of trying anything, and now he\u2019s willing to do the work: asking for help, learning lines, putting himself out there for rejection. Even if it\u2019s sidestepping the major issue, it\u2019s still a step forward.\" ==References== ==External links== * \"Later\" on Netflix * * Category:BoJack Horseman episodes Category:2014 American television episodes Category:Netflix original television series episodes ",
