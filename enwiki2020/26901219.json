    "text": "The Best of DMX is the third compilation and greatest hits album released on January 26, 2010 by Ruff Ryders Entertainment and Def Jam Recordings. Due to DMX's departure from Def Jam Recordings, only songs that were released during his time there are included on this album. Most of the songs on the album were initially released as singles from his 5 studio albums released by Ruff Ryders Entertainment and Def Jam Recordings or singles from movie soundtracks he contributed to. It consists of songs deemed to be DMX's best by Def Jam Recordings. Unlike previous albums and compilations, this album features the unedited version of \"Where The Hood At\" (with the words \"reload\" and \"slugs\" which had been cut out on the \"Grand Champ\" version). == Track listing == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|# ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Title ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Producer(s) ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Featured guest(s) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Length ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|On Original Album |- |1 |\"Where the Hood At?\" |Tuneheadz | |4:46 |Grand Champ |- |2 |\"It's All Good\" |Swizz Beatz | |4:17 |Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood |- |3 |\"What These Bitches Want\" |Nokio |Sisqo |4:13 |...And Then There Was X |- |4 |\"Get at Me Dog\" |Dame Grease PK (co-produced) |Sheek Louch |4:03 |It's Dark and Hell Is Hot |- |5 |\"Ruff Ryders' Anthem\" |Swizz Beatz | |3:34 |It's Dark and Hell Is Hot |- |6 |\"What's My Name?\" |Self & Irv Gotti | |3:52 |...And Then There Was X |- |7 |\"Party Up (Up In Here)\" |Swizz Beatz | |4:28 |...And Then There Was X |- |8 |\"X Gon' Give It to Ya\" |Shatek | |3:38 |Cradle 2 the Grave / Grand Champ |- |9 |\"We Right Here\" |Black Key | |4:27 |The Great Depression |- |10 |\"How's It Goin' Down\" |PK | |4:42 |It's Dark and Hell Is Hot |- |11 |\"The Rain\" |DJ Scratch | |3:27 |Grand Champ |- |12 |\"One More Road to Cross\" |Swizz Beatz | |4:20 |...And Then There Was X |- |13 |\"Slippin'\" |DJ Shok | |5:05 |Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood |- |14 |\"Get It On The Floor\" |Swizz Beatz | |4:24 |Grand Champ |- |15 |\"Here We Go Again\" |DJ Shok | |3:52 |...And Then There Was X |- |16 |\"Damien\" |Dame Grease | |3:42 |It's Dark and Hell Is Hot |- |17 |\"Stop Being Greedy\" |PK Dame Grease (co-produced) | |3:37 |It's Dark and Hell Is Hot |- |18 |\"Who We Be\" |Black Key | |4:47 |The Great Depression |- |19 |\"Grand Finale\" |Irv Gotti, Lil' Rob |Method Man, Nas and Ja Rule |4:38 |Belly (soundtrack) |- |20 |\"No Love 4 Me\" |Swizz Beatz |Drag-On and Swizz Beatz |4:01 |Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood |- |21 |\"Blackout\" |Swizz Beatz |Jay-Z and The Lox |4:56 |Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood |} Notes * Tracks 20 and 21 are only on the digital releases and not the physical. == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2010/2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albumshttp://www.billboard.com/charts/2010-07-24/r-b-hip-hop- albums?order=gainer | 67 |} == Sources == * https://www.amazon.com/Best- Dmx/dp/B003102JEG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=music&qid;=1270628686&sr;=8-1 * * * == References == Category:DMX (rapper) albums Category:2010 greatest hits albums Category:Albums produced by Irv Gotti Category:Albums produced by Swizz Beatz Category:Def Jam Recordings compilation albums Category:Ruff Ryders Entertainment albums Category:Gangsta rap compilation albums ",
