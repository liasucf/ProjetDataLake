This area was also known in Hebrew as achurei Beth HaKaporeth (\"behind the Holy of Holies\").The Torah anthology Jacob Culi, Isaac ben Moses Magriso, Zvi Faier - 1987 \"This last location was known as Achurei Beth HaKaporeth (\"behind the Holy of Holies\"). \" Generally, the authority of the original Beth din shel Kohanim superseded that of the Sanhedrin in areas of interest relating to the Temple and to those related to the priesthood. Some scholars are of the opinion that the 23 member body of the Beth din shel Kohanim also served in the Sanhedrin as a third of the 71 members serving therein.\"beit hillel\" (Rabbi Y. Greenweild) p. 94a ==Hebrew Bible== The first recording of creation of the Beth din shel Kohanim is traditionally ascribed by Sifri to the verse: Though the Beth din of the priests is not explicitly mentioned in this verse, nor elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible. The phrase \"court of the priests\" appears in the Mishnah in Ketuboth 5 where it is recorded that: ==Midrash and Talmud== Midrashic and Talmudic sources record that in both the first and Second Temples the Beth din shel Kohanim served their duties of temple operation and oversight of the priesthood. The Sifri exegesis details that \"from here it is said; there was an area behind the parochet wherein the investigation of Kohanic lineage would be performed\".Sifri to Numbers 18:7. See Meir Leibush ben Yehiel Michal commentary thereof and Zera Avraham (in Hebrew) ] on same verse ===Secondary investigating of priestly lineage=== Model of Second Temple Behind the tall structure (the hekhal) is the place where the Beit Din Shel Kohanim would function. The investigating properties of the Beth din shel Kohanim is described by scholars as being in addition, and secondary, to the investigating of Kohanic lineage performed by the Sanhedrin. Similarly, it is presumed that the Sanhedrin would perform a one-time investigation elevating the investigated Kohen from \"status quo\" status to kohen meyuchas status (\"Kohen-lineage verified by Beth-din\") whereas the Beth din shel Kohanim would continuously monitor the status of duty-active Kohanim in terms of their keeping to the numerous Torah and Rabbinic law that accompanies the duties and privileges of priesthood. ===Authority of priests to instruct=== The status of priests as teachers of the Law is portrayed in multiple instances in the Hebrew Bible. Generally, the Law endows the priests with authority to instruct proper Mitzvah performance of commandments as written in the Law and explained by the Sanhedrin elders. Torah verses generally describe the instruction of the priest as both final-word and reliable (Deuteronomy 21:5), with the absence of a Kohen with Torah instructive abilities described as a national misfortune (2 Chronicles 15:3). Torah commentators discount the notion that the Kohen is qualified to instruct by right of his Kohanic lineage alone. But state that is both his Kohanic lineage along with thorough knowledge of Torah law that qualifies the Kohen for Torah instructionKli Yakar to Exodus 19:4. Yalkut Shimoni to Leviticus p. 513 (hamaor edition) ==Popular functions== Based on rabbinic literature, the Beth din shel Kohanim consisted solely of Kohanim of verified patrilineal descent (\"Kohanim meyuchashim\") from Ahron HaKohen, as opposed to the Sanhedrin which was composed of members of all twelve tribes of Israel. Mishna text confirms that the Beth din shel Kohanim was authorized to levy the death penalty (\"dinei nefashot\"). Rabbeinu Chananel was of the opinion that the Beth din shel Kohanim also oversaw the appointing and rotation of the 24 priestly divisions.Rabbeinu Chananel to Taanith 17a Similarly, the Beth din ran the daily temple operations and possibly controlled the initiation ceremonies of inaugurating new vessels (\"Kli sharet\") to be used in the temple.based on various rabbinic interpretation of Tosefta to Menachot 9:1 Another item of interest to the Beth din shel Kohanim is quoted in tractate Ketuboth, where the Beth din would ascertain that the ketubah of a Bat-Kohen bride would list a base rate of four hundred zuz (as opposed the common two hundred zuz) (Mishnah Ketuboth 1:5 and 10:2). ==Jewish holidays== Mishnaic sources imply that the Beth din shel Kohanim played an active role in designating the monthly Rosh Chodesh holiday. As per the mishna in tractate Rosh HaShanah quoting an instance where . Rabbi Menachem Schneerson, in his Igrot Kodesh work explains the involvement of the Beth din shel Kohanim as the primary initiating body of the Rosh Chodesh festival due to the unique Korban that is to be brought due to the Rosh Chodesh holiday -over which the Beth din shel Kohanim would preside.Menachem Schneerson, Igrot Kodesh vol. 18 p. 549 ===Yom Kippur=== Apparently, the Beth din shel Kohanim played an active role in the Yom Kippur temple service; which included the appointing of a Kohen to escort the scapegoat sacrifice to the desert.Talmud Bavli to Rosh HaShana p. 27, Rashi thereof Mishnah commentators point out that it is also likely that the Beth din shel Kohanim was dutifully meticulous that the Kohen Gadol would carry out his duties as required.Mishna, beginning of tractate Yoma ==References== Category:Priesthood (Judaism) ",
