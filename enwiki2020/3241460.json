    "text": "The Surinam horned frog (Ceratophrys cornuta), also known as Amazonian horned frog, is a bulky frog measuring up to found in the northern part of South America. It has an exceptionally wide mouth, and has horn-like projections above its eyes. Females lay up to 1,000 eggs at a time, and wrap them around aquatic plants. The frog eats other frogs, lizards, and mice. Tadpoles of the Surinam horned frog attack each other (and tadpoles from other species) soon after being hatched. This species was once considered the same species as Ceratophrys ornata. This dispute was later settled because the Surinam Horned frog inhabits a different habitat than its smaller cousin and does not interbreed with it in the wild (but will do so in captivity). This species has been known to prey upon the other species of horned frog, especially the northern race of Ceratophrys ornata. ==Gallery== Image:Ceratophrys cornuta - 3.jpg|Ceratophrys cornuta Suriname Image:Ceratophrys cornuta - frog - 4.jpg|Ceratophrys cornuta Suriname File:Ceratophrys cornuta 01.jpg|Burying behaviour File:Cornuta_side_view_web.jpg|Ceratophrys cornuta skeleton File:Ceratophrys_cornuta_skeleton_front.jpg|Ceratophrys cornuta skeleton ==References== * Database entry includes a range map and justification for why this species is of least concern * Animal, Smithsonian Institution, 2005, pg. 445 *Ditmar's Reptiles of the World: 1937 ==External links== Category:Ceratophrys Category:Amphibians described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Amphibians of Brazil Category:Amphibians of Colombia Category:Amphibians of Ecuador Category:Amphibians of French Guiana Category:Amphibians of Guyana Category:Amphibians of Peru Category:Amphibians of Suriname ",
