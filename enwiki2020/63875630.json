    "text": "The Shepherd's Calendar (1829) is a collection by James Hogg of 21 articles, most of which had appeared in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine since 1819. They are set in, or deal with aspects of, the Scottish Borders, in particular Hogg's native Ettrick Forest. ==Background== On 1 September 1825 Hogg proposed to William Blackwood that the 'Shepherd's Calendar' articles which had been appearing in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine should be brought together in book form.The Letters of James Hogg: Volume 2 1820\u20121831, ed. Gillian Hughes (Edinburgh, 2006), 236. In June the following year Blackwood suggested that Hogg's nephew Robert might correct (basically, formalise) and alter (basically, censor) the contents, but in the autumn he put off publication blaming the stagnation of the market.Douglas S. Mack, 'Hogg, Blackwood and The Shepherd's Calendar, Papers Given at the Second James Hogg Society Conference (Edinburgh 1985), ed. Gillian Hughes (Aberdeen, 1988), 24\u201231 (25\u201226). To Hogg's frustration, it was another three years before the two-volume set, wholly edited by Robert, saw the light of day.James Hogg, The Shepherd's Calendar, ed. Douglas S. Mack (Edinburgh, 1995), xv\u2012xvi. ==Editions== The Shepherd's Calendar. By James Hogg, Author of \"The Queen's Wake,\" &c.; &c.; In two volumes was published by William Blackwood, Edinburgh, and T[homas] Cadell, London in 1829. A critical edition edited by Douglas Mack appeared in 1995 as the first volume in The Stirling/South Carolina Research Edition of The Collected Works of James Hogg, published by Edinburgh University Press. This omits five items deemed not intended by Hogg to be included: 'Nancy Chisholm', 'The Prodigal Son', 'The School of Misfortune', 'The Marvellous Doctor', and 'A Strange Secret'. The items included are based on the texts originally published in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, except for 'Storms' which takes the surviving manuscript as copy text. ==Contents (1829)== (revised by Robert Hogg) Volume One I.
