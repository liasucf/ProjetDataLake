    "text": "John Fernstr\u00f6m (6 December 1897 \u2013 19 October 1961) was a Swedish composer. Fernstr\u00f6m was born in Yichang, China, where he also spent most part of the first ten years of his life at the mission his father directed, except for a couple of years in Sweden. He resided permanently in the Swedish province of Sk\u00e5ne from 1907 and started to study the violin at the conservatory in Malm\u00f6. He was with the symphony orchestra of Helsingborg from 1916 until 1932, with some interruptions for studies; first as a violinist, later as one of its leading conductors. From 1941 he conducted the Lund Women's Student Choir at Lund University and took part in restructuring it, in 1948, into a mixed ensemble named Lund Academic Choir (Lunds akademiska k\u00f6r). Later the same year Fernstr\u00f6m left the choir when he was appointed director of the municipal music school in the city of Lund. In 1951 he founded the Nordic Youth Orchestra, which still today is an almost compulsory step for all young Scandinavian musicians on their way to become professional musicians. In 1953 he was elected member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. Fernstr\u00f6m died in Lund. He had written twelve symphonies, eight string quartets, many other chamber music pieces, concertos (among which two violin concertos, a bassoon concerto and a clarinet concerto), two operas, and a large number of songs and choral pieces. ==External links== * Home page for John Fernstr\u00f6m Category:Swedish classical composers Category:1897 births Category:1961 deaths Category:20th- century classical composers Category:Swedish male classical composers Category:People from Yichang Category:Musicians from Sk\u00e5ne County Category:20th-century Swedish male musicians ",
