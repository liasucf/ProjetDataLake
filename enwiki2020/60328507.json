Developed by the Spetssudoproect JSC, it is the first replenishmet oiler commissioned with the Russian Navy since the end of the Cold War. The ship is named after the Hero of the Russian Federation Valentin Pashin. ==History== The construction of Academic Pashin was carried out under a state contract for the Russian Defence Ministry, signed in November 2013. The ship was laid down on 26 May 2014, during a keel lying ceremony at the Nevsky Shipyard in Saint Petersburg. It was first scheduled for delivery by late 2016. On 18 March 2016, the ship's hull was rolled out of the construction hall, to start pre-finishing works before its launching on the water. It was launched on 26 May 2016. On 17 May 2018, it has started first stage of its sea trials in the Ladoga Lake. In September 2018, the ship arrived in Kronstadt, where it was to join the Russian Navy by the year end. In early 2019, the trials continued in the Baltic Sea, where the ship's interaction with deck helicopters was worked out. The Ka-27PS helicopters were delivering various cargoes onto the ship and back to shore. Academic Pashin successfully completed the trials in late June 2019, and was commissioned on 21 January 2020. In April 2020, Academic Pashin is spotted in the Channel off Cherbourg during the Suffren first sea trial. ==References== Category:Auxiliary replenishment ship classes Category:Auxiliary ships of the Russian Navy Category:Oilers Category:2016 ships ",
