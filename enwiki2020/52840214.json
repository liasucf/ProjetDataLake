Facilities include a restaurant, bar, wellness area and a casino. The Danish national football team stays at the hotel in connection with home matches and training sessions. ==History== Marienlyst Spa Hotel in 1860, illustration from Illustreret Tidende In the second half of the 19th century, the \u00d8resund coast became a popular summer destination for wealthy citizens from Copenhagen. J. S. Nathanson, a broker from Helsing\u00f8r, rented Marienlyst House from Helsing\u00f8r Municipality with the intention of opening a spa hotel. His inspiration came from visits to spa towns in Germany. As a publicity stunt, to profit from nearby Kronborg Castle's reputation as the home of Hamlet, he renamed a natural spring in the cliff behind the house Ophelia's Spring and constructed Hamlet's Grave nearby. Marienlyst Spa (Marienlyst Kur- og S\u00f8badeanstalt) opened on 1 June 1858. Nathansen also charged the architect Niels Peder Christian Hols\u00f8e with the design of a new hotel building but went bankrupt before it had been completed and the project was there taken over by Helsing\u00f8r Municipality. The new hotel building was inaugurated on 22 June 1861 with J. W. Briggs as operator. When Sarah Benhard was in Copenhagen in the summer of 1880 to perform in Adrienne Lecouvreur at the Royal Theatre, she vusuted Hotel Marienlyst to see the Tomb of Hamlet and Ophelia's Spring.
