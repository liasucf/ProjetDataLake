    "text": "\"Watching the Wheels\" is a single by John Lennon released posthumously in 1981, after his murder. The B-side features Yoko Ono's \"Yes, I'm Your Angel.\" It was the third and final single released from Lennon and Ono's album Double Fantasy, and reached No. 10 in the US on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 7 on Cashbox Magazine's Top 100. It peaked at number 30 in the UK. ==Writing and recording== In \"Watching the Wheels\" Lennon addresses those who were confounded by his \"househusband\" years, 1975\u20131980, during which he retired from the music industry to concentrate on raising his son Sean with Ono. The acoustic demo of \"Watching the Wheels\" is featured in the ending credits to the 2009 film Funny People. The song features a hammered dulcimer accompanying the lead piano. ==Artwork== The photograph on the cover was taken by Paul Goresh, a fan of Lennon who also took the infamous photo of Lennon signing a copy of Double Fantasy for his murderer. Both photos were taken at the same place, in front of the Dakota building, which was the site of his 1980 shooting. The line \"People say I'm crazy\" from the song was later sampled for use by the band EMF in the track \"Lies\" from their 1991 album Schubert Dip, however upon immediate protests by Yoko Ono the sampling was removed on subsequent pressings. ==Personnel== *John Lennon \u2013 vocals, piano, keyboards *Earl Slick, Hugh McCracken \u2013 lead guitar *Tony Levin \u2013 bass guitar *George Small \u2013 keyboards, piano, Fender Rhodes *Eric Troyer \u2013 Prophet-5 *Andy Newmark \u2013 drums * Matthew Cunningham \u2013 hammer dulcimer *Arthur Jenkins \u2013 percussion * Michelle Simpson, Cassandra Wooten, Cheryl Mason Jacks, Eric Troyer \u2013 backing vocals ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1981) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australia KMR | style=\"text-align:center;\"|45 |- |align=\"left\"|Austria | style=\"text-align:center;\"|12 |- |align=\"left\"|Canada RPM | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|Germany | style=\"text- align:center;\"|46 |- | |- |align=\"left\"|Switzerland | style=\"text- align:center;\"|6 |- |align=\"left\"|UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|30 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100 Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990 \u2013 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|10 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary | style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- |U.S. Cash Box Top 100 Cash Box magazine | style=\"text-align:center;\"|7 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1981) ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Rank |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|26 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|86 |- |U.S. Cash Box | style=\"text-align:center;\"|62 |} ==Cover versions== The song has been covered by Gwen Guthrie (1992), The Samples (1997); Paraguayan rock band Deliverans released a Spanish version on the compilation album Lennon Vive: Un tributo del Rock paraguayo (2000)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w7kl-gjxjU, Matisyahu for the benefit album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur (2007), and Charly Garc\u00eda under the name \"Mirando las ruedas\" for his album Kill Gil (2010).
