    "text": "Former railway near Seend Seend railway station was near the village of Seend in Wiltshire, England. The station was a stop on the Devizes Branch Line, between Semington and Bromham & Rowde. Its position northwest of the village was chosen to serve the iron ore mine and iron works at Seend Cleeve. After the completion of the Devizes line, the junction at Holt allowed the fastest route from London to the West Country. However the line lost to competition and reverted to a branch line in 1900. The station suffered from reduced traffic after the completion of the Stert and Westbury Railway between Patney and Chirton railway station and Westbury, which by-passed the Devizes Branch Line to reduce the London to Plymouth journey by 5 miles. Seend station and the entire Devizes Branch Line were closed under the Beeching cuts. Both were destroyed in 1970. == See also == * Devizes Branch Line * Devizes railway station == References == == External links == * * Category:Disused railway stations in Wiltshire Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1857 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1966 Category:Beeching closures in England Category:1857 establishments in England ",
