    "text": "\"Bella senz'anima\" is an Italian ballad song written by Marco Luberti, Paolo Casella and Riccardo Cocciante, arranged by Franco Pisano and performed by Riccardo Cocciante. It was the first single from the Cocciante's 1974 album Anima. The song was launched by Cocciante during a tour (\"Racconto\") he made in 1973 together with Antonello Venditti and Francesco De Gregori. The single peaked at the first place on the Italian singles chart, and it was the seventh most sold single of the year in Italy. The lyrics, and particularly the verse \"E adesso spogliati come sai fare tu\" (i.e. \"And now strip as you know\") led to harsh criticism from several feminist organizations and to television censorship. In 2006, Cocciante performed the song out of competition at the Sanremo Music Festival. ==Track listing== *7-inch single \u2013 AN 4155 :A. \"Bella senz'anima\" (Marco Luberti, Paolo Casella, Riccardo Cocciante) :B. \"Qui\" (Marco Luberti, Paolo Casella, Riccardo Cocciante) ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Italy |align=\"center\"|1 |} ==References== Category:1974 singles Category:1974 songs Category:Number-one singles in Italy Category:Riccardo Cocciante songs Category:Songs written by Riccardo Cocciante Category:Songs written by Marco Luberti ",
