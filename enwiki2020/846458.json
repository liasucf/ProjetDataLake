She rose to fame as the dancer of Polish pop group Ich Troje, and the partner of its leader, Micha\u0142 Wi\u015bniewski. She embarked on a singing career in 2004, covering Whitesnake's \"Here I Go Again\", which became a hit in Poland. Her first two albums, Mandaryna.com and Mandarynkowy sen, released in 2004 and 2005, respectively, were met with commercial success. In 2005, Mandaryna sparked a major controversy during her performance at Sopot Festival, which exposed her alleged lack of vocal talent. Nonetheless, the performed song \"Ev'ry Night\" became a massive hit and remains arguably her best-known song to date. The song was written and produced by her longtime producers/writers Harald Reitinger and Uli Fischer who are responsible for 90% of her musical career. ==Career== Throughout her teenage years, Marta Wi\u015bniewska took extensive dancing lessons and was part of several dancing groups. In 2000, she became the dancer and choreographer of Ich Troje, then highly popular Polish pop group. She would become the partner of its lead singer, Micha\u0142 Wi\u015bniewski, and the couple took part in controversial reality show Jestem, jaki jestem, which became a television hit. During the show in 2003 she recorded two songs for Micha\u0142 and began to prepare her musical career with professionals. She chose the artistic nickname \"Mandaryna\" deriving from her birth name. In 2004, Mandaryna debuted as a singer and had a hit with the song \"Here I Go Again\", a cover version of a Whitesnake song, produced by Groove Coverage. Later in the summer, her debut album Mandaryna.com was released, going on to sell well and achieving gold certification in Poland. It was then released in Germany and Austria. In 2005, Mandaryna took part in Sopot Festival, performing live her new song \"Ev'ry Night\". The performance, which proved her lacking singing abilities, caused nationwide controversy and Mandaryna became the object of a backlash. Nonetheless, \"Ev'ry Night\" became a massive hit in Poland and the follow-up second album, Mandarynkowy sen, reached number 1 spot in the albums chart in Poland. The album also featured a cover of Bon Jovi's \"You Give Love a Bad Name\", which was released as the next single to considerable success. In 2006, Mandaryna released the single \"Stay Together\" and started recording her third studio album. She also filmed her own short-lived, yet successful TV show Let's Dance, czyli zrobi\u0119 dla was wszystko. In 2007, she recorded a new song, \"Heaven\", which again caused a stir, after it was proclaimed a rip-off of Madonna's \"Jump\". In the same year, she opened her first Mandaryna Dance Studio, which has since evolved into a chain of successful dance schools, and regularly appeared on Rozmowy w toku, a popular talk show. The release of her third studio album, Third Time: Mandaryna4You, was scheduled to January 2008, but due to a serious conflict between Mandaryna, her manager Katarzyna Kanclerz and music producer Marek So\u015bnicki, its release was pulled and it now remains unreleased. She founded a short-lived band, 2be3, and recorded a cover of New Kids on the Block's \"Step by Step\" with them. In 2009, she made a comeback with the album AOK. Although the album failed to chart, its only single \"Good Dog Bad Dog\", an electropop song with elements of rap, earned considerable popularity. \"Good Dog Bad Dog was written and produced by Ali Alien and Marek \u015aledziewski, then remixed by Josh Harris, an American producer. The videoclip for the song was shot within six days in Poland. It premiered on 12 October 2009 on Polish division of VIVA. The song was performed on Polish breakfast TV show Dzie\u0144 Dobry TVN. The song and the video met with positive response but received little airplay on Polish mainstream radio stations and television, apart from VIVA. In 2010, she appeared as a member of the judging panel on popular TV show Hot or Not on VIVA Poland. She also announced working on her next studio album, due in early 2011 and initially called Sugar Sugar. The album was not released, but in 2012 Mandaryna came back with a new single, \"Bring the Beat\". In 2013, Marta Wi\u015bniewska announced she has ended her musical career and instead is going to focus on developing her dance school business. In 2018 she announced her musical comeback with performances in some clubs in Poland. ==Private life== Mandaryna was married to Micha\u0142 Wi\u015bniewski, the lead singer of the Polish pop group Ich Troje. She has two children with Wi\u015bniewski, Xavier Micha\u0142 (born 24 June 2002) and Fabienne Marta (born 21 August 2003), both born in Warsaw. She has been in a long-term relationship with Wojtek B\u0105kiewicz, a Polish photographer for Playboy and CKM magazines. She's a diabetic. ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions, and certifications ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Certifications |- !PL |- ! scope=\"row\" | Mandaryna.com | *Released: August 2004 *Label: Magic * Formats: CD, digital download | 8 | * PL: Gold |- ! scope=\"row\" | Mandarynkowy sen | *Released: August 2005 *Label: Universal * Formats: CD, digital download | 1 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | AOK | *Released: 8 August 2009 *Label: Fonografika *Formats: CD | \u2014 | |- |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of singles as lead artist, with album name ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Album |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Here I Go Again\" | rowspan=\"2\" | 2004 | rowspan=\"2\" | Mandaryna.com |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"L'\u00c9t\u00e9 indien\" |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Ev'ry Night\" | rowspan=\"3\" | 2005 | rowspan=\"3\" | Mandarynkowy sen |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"You Give Love a Bad Name\" |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"A Spaceman Came Travelling\" |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Stay Together\" | 2006 | rowspan=\"2\" |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Heaven\" | 2007 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Good Dog Bad Dog\" | 2009 | AOK |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Bring the Beat\" | 2012 | rowspan=\"2\" |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Not Perfect\" | 2018 |} ==Acting== * 1999: Cisza \u2013 film * 2002: Gwiazdor \u2013 film * 2003-2004: Na Wsp\u00f3lnej \u2013 soap opera * 2006-2007: Pierwsza mi\u0142o\u015b\u0107 \u2013 soap opera * 2007: Kryminalni \u2013 crime drama ==References== ==External links== * Mandaryna on Facebook * Mandaryna on YouTube Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Category:Polish actresses Category:Polish female dancers Category:Polish female singers Category:Polish pop singers Category:Polish fraudsters Category:English-language singers from Poland Category:Musical hoaxes ",
