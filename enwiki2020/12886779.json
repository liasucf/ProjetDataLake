Most species are commonly known as threadtails, while others are commonly known as bambootails. ==Characteristics== These are usually small-sized damselflies and their wings are narrow and mostly transparent, with simple venation. The males tend to be colourful and many have a red, orange, yellow or blue thorax and a black abdomen. Others have a black thorax and brightly coloured abdomen and others are entirely dark. Their usual habitats are the verges of rivers and streams and the margins of large lakes. ==Update== Now Pseudostigmatidae and New World Protoneuridae are sunk in Coenagrionidae and Old World Protoneuridae in Platycnemididae.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261947984_The_classification_and_diversity_of_dragonflies_and_damselflies_Odonata ==Genera== The family contains the following genera : *Amazoneura Machado, 2004 *Arabineura Schneider and Dumont, 1995 *Caconeura Kirby, 1890 *Chlorocnemis Selys, 1863 *Drepanoneura von Ellenrieder & Garrison, 2008 *Disparoneura Selys, 1860 *Elattoneura Cowley, 1935 *Epipleoneura Williamson, 1915 *Epipotoneura Williamson, 1915 *Esme Fraser, 1922 *Forcepsioneura Lencioni, 1999 *Idioneura Selys, 1860 *Isomecocnemis Cowley, 1936 *Lamproneura De Marmels, 2003 *Melanoneura Fraser, 1922 *Microneura Hagen in Selys, 1886 *Neoneura Selys, 1860 *Nososticta Selys, 1860 *Peristicta Hagen in Selys, 1860 *Phasmoneura Williamson, 1916 *Phylloneura Fraser, 1922 *Prodasineura Cowley, 1934 *Proneura Selys, 1889 *Protoneura Selys in Sagra, 1857 *Psaironeura Williamson, 1915 *Roppaneura Santos, 1966 ==References== ==See also== * List of damselflies of the world (Protoneuridae) Category:Taxa named by Robert John Tillyard Category:Odonata families ",
