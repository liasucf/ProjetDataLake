    "text": "The Atlantic mixed forests is a terrestrial ecoregion in western Europe. It extends along the western edge of continental Europe, from southwestern France through northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, northwestern Germany, and western Denmark. Most of the region's forests and dunes have been converted to fields, pastures, and forest plantations, and its once-extensive wetlands have mostly been drained and filled. ==Geography== The ecoregion covers and area of 380,246 km\u00b2. The terrain is generally flat or gently rolling, except in Brittany where the terrain is hilly and the coast is rocky. In several places, notably the Landes forest in southwestern France, dunes extended inland for miles from the shore. ==Climate== The climate is temperate and maritime. ==Flora== Mixed oak forests are typical, with Quercus robur and Betula pendula prevalent on acidic soils, and Q. robur and Fagus sylvatica on other soils. In the southern portion of the ecoregion Quercus petraea and Q. pubescens are also present. Pinus pinaster grows naturally on sandy soils, and has been planted extensively to stabilize dunes, along with Pinus sylvestris. Heathlands occur in coastal areas subject to wind and salt spray. ==Protected areas== 59,657 km\u00b2, or 16%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Another 19% of the ecoregion's area is forested but unprotected.Eric Dinerstein, David Olson, et al. (2017). An Ecoregion-Based Approach to Protecting Half the Terrestrial Realm, BioScience, Volume 67, Issue 6, June 2017, Pages 534\u2013545; Supplemental material 2 table S1b. In France, the system of regional nature parks preserves biodiversity and sustainable agriculture. Regional nature parks include farms and villages as well as forests, heathlands and wetlands. Regional nature parks in the Atlantic mixed forests include Armorique, Brenne, Boucles de la Seine normande, Caps et Marais d'Opale, Causses du Quercy, G\u00e2tinais fran\u00e7ais, Haute Vall\u00e9e de Chevreuse, Landes de Gascogne, Loire-Anjou- Touraine, Marais Du Cotentin Et Du Bessin, Marais poitevin, Montagne de Reims, Oise-Pays de France, Perche, Vall\u00e9e de la Scarpe et de l'Escaut avesnois, and Vexin fran\u00e7ais. L\u00fcneburg Heath (L\u00fcneburger Heide) in northern Germany includes area of heathland, bog, and downy oak forest, as well as coppiced woodlands and pine plantations. ==Ecoregion delineation== The European Environment Agency's Digital Map of European Ecological Regions (DMEER) designates two Atlantic forest ecoregions \u2013 the Northern Temperate Atlantic and Southern Temperate Atlantic.\"DMEER: Digital Map of European Ecological Regions\". European Environment Agency, 12 November 2009. Accessed 29 April 2020. The WWF's system combines them into one Atlantic mixed forests ecoregion, with the same external boundary. ==External links== * ==References== Category:Ecoregions of Denmark Category:Ecoregions of France Category:Ecoregions of Germany Category:Flora of Belgium Category:Flora of Denmark Category:Flora of the Netherlands Category:Palearctic ecoregions Category:Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests ",
