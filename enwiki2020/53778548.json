    "text": "The following is a list of churches in Eden District. The following parishes have no active churches: Colby, Crackenthorpe, Hartley, Helbeck, Hoff, Hunsonby, Kaber, Newby, Shap Rural, Sockbridge and Tirril, Thrimby, Waitby, Wharton and Yanwath and Eamont Bridge. The district has an estimated 121 active churches for 53,000 people, a ratio of one church to every 438 inhabitants. This is the lowest ratio in England outside of the sui generis City of London. ==Map of medieval parish churches== For the purposes of this map medieval is taken to be pre-1485. It is of note that Cumbria, unlike most parts of England, saw a sustained programme of church building during the 16th and 17th centuries as the more remote parts of the district were settled. ==List== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! scope=\"col\" |Name !Civil parish (settlement) !Dedication !Web ! scope=\"col\" |Founded ! scope=\"col\" |Denomination !Benefice !Notes |- |St Michael & All Angels, Ainstable |Ainstable |Michael & Angels | |Medieval |Church of England |Inglewood Group |Rebuilt 1872 |- |Ainstable Methodist Church |Ainstable | | |1861 |Methodist |Kirkoswald & Alston Moor MC | |- |St Augustine of Canterbury, Alston |Alston Moor (Alston) |Augustine of C'bury | |Medieval |Church of England |Alston Moor Parish |Rebuilt 1869.
