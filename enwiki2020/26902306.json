    "text": "The Canossians are a family of two religious institutes and three affiliated organizations that trace their origin to Magdalen of Canossa (1774\u20131835) who was declared a saint by the Roman Catholic Church in 1988. ==Canossian Family== ===Canossian Daughters of Charity, Servants of the Poor (FDCC)=== The Canossian Daughters of Charity (Canossian Sisters), is a Catholic religious institute founded by Magdalen of Canossa in Verona, Italy, in 1808. On February 27, 1860, six Canossian Sisters from Venice and Padua began their journey to Hong Kong arriving there on April 12, 1860. From there the sisters went to Macau and then to Southeast Asia. Today they count eighteen provinces with approximately 2,700 Sisters in more than 336 communities and in 32 countries around the world. Their primary works of charity include education, catechesis, and care of the sick. The General House is in Rome. (FDCC is the Italian abbreviation of \"Figlie Della Carit\u00e0 Canossiane\"). ENCA or Enlace Canossiano America (Canossian Network in America) is the union of the three Canossian Provinces in America: Brazil, Argentina and North America. It includes all the Canossian Sisters residing in America. Since 1988 the sisters help with pastoral work, teaching and hospital visitation the Chinese Community and the new Chinese immigrants at St. Francis Xavier Church in Richmond in the Archdiocese of Vancouver, British Columbia. In the United States the Canossian Daughters of Charity run a retreat center, the Canossian Spirituality Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Sisters in Macau spread out to other countries in Southeast Asia towards the end of the 19th century. In 1894 mainly Italian and Portuguese-speaking Sisters arrived at the Portuguese Mission at St. Joseph's Church in Singapore (then part of the Straits Settlements) and expanded to Malaya, both of which were part of the British Empire. As of 2008 the Sisters are the largest religious orders in the Archdiocese of Singapore and operate 3 mainstream schools - St Anthony's Canossian Primary & Secondary School & Canossa Catholic Primary School; 2 pre- schools/kindergartens, 1 special school for the deaf and 2 homes for the Aged Sick providing palliative care. In addition, the Sisters offer retreats and spiritual direction. In the Philippines, Mother Anna Bautista led a group of sisters and founded the first mission and school in the country in 1954. ===Canossian Sons of Charity (FdCC)=== The Canossian Sons of Charity, (Canossian Fathers), were founded in Venice in 1831. They count today about 200 brothers and priests dedicated to the education of children and young people through cathechesis in schools, orphanages, youth centers (oratories) and other works of charity towards the poor and the least. They are present in Italy, Brazil, Kenya, Tanzania, India and the Philippines. (FdCC means \"Figli della Carit\u00e0 Canossiani\"). In 1986 upon the invitation of the late Jaime Cardinal Sin, Archbishop of Manila, the Canossian Fathers in Italy sent two priests to start a mission and to open a seminary. ===Affiliates=== * Association of Lay Canossians (ALC) (Canossian Tertiaries or Collaborators) are married and unmarried lay men and women of diverse nationalities who feel called to live the charism and the spirituality of the Canossian Family in their personal, family and social life. They received their \"Plan for the Tertiaries\" in 1835 and today serve in Asia, Europe, Oceania, Africa and the Americas. They are counting about 2,150 members.

They are presently sharing in Canossian missionary projects in Togo, Congo, Uganda, Albania, Indonesia, Angola, Paraguay and Brasil. (VOICA is the abbreviation of \"Volontariato Internazionale CAnossiano\"). * Canossian Foundation (ONLUS), established in 2004 in Rome, is a legal non-profit entity for human development, to promote, coordinate and sustain initiatives that favour the poorest and the most excluded in the world and also to raise funds for the Canossian Missions in Brazil, the Philippines, India, and Africa.
