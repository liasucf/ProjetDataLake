    "text": "William Strang, 1882, Potato Lifting, published in The Portfolio. The Portfolio was a British monthly art magazine published in London from 1870 to 1893. It was founded by Philip Gilbert Hamerton and promoted contemporary printmaking, especially etching, and was important in the British Etching Revival. Early contributors included Joseph Beavington Atkinson (1822-1886), Francis Turner Palgrave (1824-1897) and Sidney Colvin (1845-1927). ==History== The mid-nineteenth century in France and Britain saw a rise in the interest in etching. Hamerton had spent the 1860s in France with his French wife, Eug\u00e9nie. The impetus for the launch of The Portfolio came in the wake of the foundation in Paris of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des aquafortistes in 1862, and to a lesser extent from the longer established Etching Club from 1838. Etchings by many French etchers such as Paul Rajon (1843-1888) and Benjamin Damman (1835-1921) were a marked feature of the publication. The New York Times lavished praise on the publication when, in 1875, it remarked that it could not \"eulogize too highly the merits of this periodical in all its departments. It is, without question, the most beautiful in regard to illustration which emanates from the press.\"'New Publications', The New York Times, 23 March 1875, p.10. The late nineteenth-century British author George Gissing wrote in his diary for December 1895 (sic.) that he took the magazine for his son, because of its good pictures.Coustillas, Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist (Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978), p.396. In a survey of the etching revival in 1878 the Magazine of Art highlighted the centrality of Hamerton and his monthly magazine which had \"so ably and unceasingly pleaded the cause of etching\" in Britain.Marcus Bourne Huish, 'Etching in England: I', Magazine of Art, 1878, pp.146-48 (148). ==References== Category:1870 establishments in England Category:Publications established in 1870 Category:Publications disestablished in 1893 Category:Visual arts magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Monthly magazines published in the United Kingdom ",
