    "text": "Vyacheslav Ivanovich Lebedev () (January 27, 1930 \u2013 March 22, 2010) was a Soviet and Russian mathematician, known for his work on numerical analysis. == Career == Lebedev was a Ph.D. student of Sobolev. He worked at the Kurchatov Institute and Soviet/Russian Academy of Sciences, and taught students at the Moscow State University and Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. He authored over a hundred papers and several books, most noticeably \"Numerical methods in the theory of neutron transport\" jointly with Gury Marchuk and \"Functional Analysis in Computational Mathematics,\" based on his lectures. He graduated over 15 Ph.D.'s. Lebedev quadrature has become one of the popular methods of integration on a sphere. === Areas of expertise === He worked in many areas of computational and applied mathematics, ranging from software development for nuclear reactors modeling to approximation by polynomials, from quadrature on a sphere to numerical solution of stiff for which he developed explicit Chebyshev methods called DUMKA, systems of PDEs, from domain decomposition and Poincar\u00e9\u2013Steklov operators to Finite difference methods, from iterative solvers to parallel computing. He even contributed to finding the roots of a cubic equation. == Awards == He was a recipient of the Soviet State Award for developing mathematical methods of particle transport theory in 1987 and Chebyshev Gold medal () in 2002\u201303. ==Notes== * http://www.netlib.org/na-digest-html/10/v10n13.html#1 Vyacheslav Ivanovich Lebedev, January 27, 1930 \u2013 March 22, 2010 ==References== * * * ==External links== * * Vyacheslav Lebedev \u2014 scientific works on the website Math-Net.Ru *from RAS.RU (In Russian) *from KIAE.RU (In Russian) Category:Russian mathematicians Category:Soviet mathematicians Category:Numerical analysts Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:1930 births Category:2010 deaths ",
