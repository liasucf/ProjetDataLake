In 2005 the Portuguese government signed a deal worth 364 million euros to acquire 260 Pandur II armoured vehicle, with an option for further 33 worth 140 million euros, to equip the Portuguese Intervention Brigade of the Portuguese Army and the marines of the Portuguese Navy. Portugal was the first country to buy Pandur II.\u00a8Portugal was the first country to select the Pandur II 8x8, awarding Steyr-Daimler-Puch a EUR344.3 million (USD455.1 million) contract (plus a spares contract worth another EUR20.7 million) for the supply of 260 vehicles in February 2005 ... Second in line was the Czech Army, which it was announced in June 2006 had placed an EUR821 million order for 199 vehicles (plus 35 options) in 18 versions, all of which will be amphibious, including 63 infantry combat vehicles (ICVs)\u00a8 Pandur II in profile: Steyr's 8x8 digitized warfare platform is gathering speed by Rupert Pengelley, in Jane\u00b4s Defence Industry, 17 January 2007.

Pandur II is supposed to replace the Chaimite ==Armour== The Pandur II for the Portuguese Army is fitted with Steyr add-on armour that provides Level 4 protection according to STANAG 4569. The vehicles for the marines are equipped with Level 3 armour. However, Portuguese army did not accept the quality of the Pandur II and keep only 120 Pandurs in Portugal a t\u00edtulo provis\u00f3rio, that means that either Pandur II are not technically suitable or some other part of the contract with General Dynamics was not fulfilled, or both.\u00a8 O Ex\u00e9rcito informou tamb\u00e9m que 59 das 120 Pandur recebidas desde finais de 2007 \"encontram-se no Dep\u00f3sito-Geral de Material do Ex\u00e9rcito\" (Alcochete), para serem reparadas.\u00a8 ==Offset issues== World operators of Patria AMV It is worthy to return to the surprising and preemptive exclusion of Patria. It could not have been on technical problems, since Patria AMV was a vehicle more tested than Pandur. Before Portugal's purchase there were only few prototypes of Pandur II. On the other hand, Patria sold AMV to many countries: Finland,62 AMV Poland,692 AMV Croatia,84 AMV Sweden,113 AMV United Arab Emirates, South Africa,264 AMV Slovenia.See Patria case The exclusion of Patria AMV put Portugal in the awkward condition to have to negotiate with one supplier only. Portugal moved from a situation of monopsony (only one buyer and many sellers -typical of arms procurement) to a situation of monopoly (only one seller). It has been stated that Patria proposed the only vehicle that did not show the requested operational capabilities. The fact that the company gave its price offer after the deadline, knowing that this might have disqualified Patria from the tender, was also interpreted as a desire to avoid the final tests with the Portuguese Military, since the results could have harmed Patria's international image. However. this interpretation of Patria's intentions is not consistent with Patria's successive actions, especially with Patria's public legal appeal against the decision of the Ministry of Defense. If a company wants to go unnoticed, it does not make such a public statement against the Portuguese real motivations for the elimination of Patria.See Patria case on the European commercial war between General Dynamics and Patria. Romanian Piranha (GD) After the elimination of Patria in 2004, Portugal was effectively left with one competitor, that is, General Dynamics Pandur vs. General Dynamics Piranha, GD vs. GD.\"Patria had won some of these competitions, including a large 690-vehicle contract in Poland, plus 84 AMV orders from Finland so far that include 24 breech-loading 120mm AMOS twin-mortar variants. It has also lost competitions in Belgium (242 LAV III Piranhas for $850 million) The Czech Republic (199 Pandur IIs for $1 billion), and Portugal (260 Pandur IIs for $482 million).\" Defense Industry Daily, 28/03/2011 At this point, the only factor that had actual weight for the Ministry of Defense was the offset proposal. Most of the serious problems on Pandur procurement pertain to the offset package offered by General Dynamics. Patria had claimed it was unrealistic, and time has shown that Patria was right. They claimed also that General Dynamics offset package was intentionally misleading, and this was an understatement.\"A empresa austr\u00edaca que vendeu os blindados Pandur a Portugal ainda n\u00e3o cumpriu nem um c\u00eantimo dos 516 milh\u00f5es de euros de contrapartidas devidas \u00e0 economia nacional. A informa\u00e7\u00e3o consta de um relat\u00f3rio a que a SIC teve acesso. O Governo garante agora que perante este incumprimento vai utilizar a garantia banc\u00e1ria de 130 milh\u00f5es de euros prestada pelo fornecedor na assinatura do contrato.\" SIC Noticias, 19.12.2012, Fabrequipa, direct offset, is the most known case. General Dynamics transferred the Pandur production to Czech Republic, blaming the global economic crisis for their breach of the Pandur offset contract.Empresa austr\u00edaca quer transferir fabrico de blindados Pandur de Portugal para a Rep\u00fablica Checa. Poder\u00e3o estar em causa 200 empregos no Barreiro, Publico, March 14, 2009 The case of Tecnia Lda of Torres Vedras is connected to an indirect offset,Foreign Direct Investment and Marketing Assistance offset that General Dynamics based in a LGT branch in Luxembourg.\u00a8Governo contacta Berlim para obter lista de clientes de bancos no Liechtenstein\u00a8. See: 2008 Liechtenstein tax affair It was supposed to support Portuguese environmental and water technologies sales in Saudi Arabia and it is the most embarrassing of all Portuguese contractual violations related to the offset program. The destruction of Tecnia to justify the issuing offset certificates exposes the ways General Dynamics conceives offset contracts and offset fulfillment in Europe. The problem of the weight of offset in the procurement decisions is not exclusively Portuguese.\u00a8Defense Minister's directive on Contrapartidas (offsets) has been issued in 2002. Decree-Law 153/2006 and 154/2006 regulates Portuguese Contrapartidas. The Permanent Commission on Offsets (CPC) is a government agency, which depends on the Ministries of Defense and of Economy, and it is in charge of negotiating and supervising offsets. The threshold is 10 million Euro, and the minimum offset request is 100 %. Multipliers have been set in 2006 between 1 and 5. There is no preference with regard to direct or indirect offsets\u00a8 Portugal offset agreement. See also Portugal - Epicos National Offset Report (E.N.O.R. 19) - November 2007. Portugal is an offset important theater: G.O.C.A Global Offset and Countertrade Association and DMA Defence Manufacturers Association are the two main offset fulfillers organizations, and in 2004 they decided to hold their first joint meeting on offset in 2004 in Sintra. It is a European plague.The EDA has stated that offsets can distort the defence procurement market and obstruct the creation of a unified European industrial base. While the European Defence Agency (EDA) has recognised the benefits of some offset agreements, it has also said that \"offset should ideally be phased out eventually and that it is \"generally difficult to justify any type of offset on the basis of Article 296 (now Article 386 of the Treaty on European Union) by Kery Smith, in Jane's Defence Industry December 01, 2007 In the European horizon one can understand what happened in the Pandur procurement between 2003 and 2005 by looking at the Slovenian case, that is one of the many battles in the commercial war between Patria and General Dynamics European Land Systems. In 2008 Jorma Wiitakorpi (Patria CEO) was arrested in Finland and charged with bribery and industrial espionage.Jorma Wiitacorpi is the same person who decided to appeal the Ministry of Defense decisions in 2005. See Patria case and Portuguese Pandur offset agreement demonstrates the urgency of a European reform to enforce Lisbon Treaty article 346, and the European convention against corruption involving officials.. \u00a8O Governo portugu\u00eas decidiu fazer dos ve\u00edculos Pandur um caso exemplar, deixando um ultimato \u00e0 fabricante austr\u00edaca Steyr: ou as prometidas contrapartidas de 384 milh\u00f5es aparecem ou o contrato com o Estado portugu\u00eas \u00e9 simplesmente denunciado.
