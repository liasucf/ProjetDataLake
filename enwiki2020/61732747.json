    "text": "The Gebo Barn, in Carbon County, Montana near Fromberg, Montana, was built during 1907 to 1909. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. It is a poured concrete gambrel-roofed barn built for Samuel W. (Sam) Gebo, a wealthy coal mine developer, on his ranch: > The barn was built on a grand scale to house his purebred Belgian horses, > general livestock, and farm equipment. At the time, the ranch consisted of > 335 acres and was valued at $45,170.2 It was the largest ranch in Carbon > County at the time and was described by a reporter as \"one of the finest > farms in Montana, equipped from the woven wire fence right into the > fireplace with all the modern implements and accessories.\" / Following his > arrival in eastern Montana in the mid-1890s, Sam Gebo had made a fortune in > coal mine developments in the Mountain West and had become one of the > wealthier citizens in Carbon County. His Gebo Mine, near present day > Fromberg, attracted the Northern Pacific Railroad to build a branch line > into the Clarks Fork Valley in 1898, further opening the fertile area to > mining and agricultural development. / Between 1903 and 1904, he bought > 300-plus acres of ranch land just south of Fromberg.5 It is not clear > exactly when construction on Gebo's brick home and barn were completed, but > in 1907 Gebo secured a $60,000 mortgage on the Fromberg land. Part of this > money was likely used to build the large poured concrete barn. Though the > architect and/or builder of the barn are unknown, it is likely that Gebo > chose concrete as the primary building material for the barn given the ready > availability of concrete from the newly opened Gibson Concrete Works in > Fromberg. The barn was completed in 1909 and christened with a large party > and dance in the cavernous loft. Reports say the lavish event included > refreshments and a full orchestra, and that nearly 300 people from around > the state attended the celebration despite bad weather and treacherous > roads. Soon after, Gebo took out an advertisement for several consecutive > weeks in the Bridger Times announcing that his Registered American Stud, > \"Monico,\" would be \"standing\" at the Fromberg ranch and other locations all > summer. The stud fee was $20. With It is located 2.5 miles south of Fromberg on River Rd. ==References== Category:Barns in Montana Category:Ranches in Montana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Carbon County, Montana Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1909 ",
