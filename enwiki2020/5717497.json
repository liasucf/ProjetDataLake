    "text": "Gallirallus is a genus of rails that live in the Australasian-Pacific region. The genus is characterised by an ability to colonise relatively small and isolated islands and thereafter to evolve flightless forms, many of which became extinct following Polynesian settlement. ==Description== Many of the rails, including the well-known weka of New Zealand, are flightless or nearly so. Many of the resultant flightless island endemics became extinct after the arrival of humans, which hunted these birds for food, introduced novel predators like rats, dogs or pigs, and upset the local ecosystems. A common Polynesian name of these rails, mainly relatives of G. philippensis, is veka/weka (in English, this name is generally limited to Gallirallus australis). On the other hand, Gallirallus species are (with the exception of the weka) notoriously retiring and shy birds with often drab coloration. ==Living species== In the online list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), the genus contains two species: *Weka, Gallirallus australis *Calayan rail, Gallirallus calayanensis These species are placed by BirdLife International and IUCN in the separate genus Hypotaenidia but are still considered part of Gallirallus by The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World/eBird: *Okinawa rail, Gallirallus okinawae *Barred rail, Gallirallus torquatus *Pink-legged rail, Gallirallus insignis *Roviana rail, Gallirallus rovianae *Guam rail, Gallirallus owstoni - extinct in the wild (late 1980s) *Lord Howe woodhen, Gallirallus sylvestris *Buff-banded rail, Gallirallus philippensis *Dieffenbach's rail, Gallirallus dieffenbachii - extinct (mid-19th century) *Wake Island rail, Gallirallus wakensis - extinct (1945) *Tahiti rail, Gallirallus pacificus - extinct (late 18th - 19th century) ==Species extinct before A.D. 1500== Illustration of an unidentified extinct species (possibly G. vekamatolu) from Vava'u, 1739 * Nuku Hiva rail, Gallirallus epulare * New Ireland rail, Gallirallus ernstmayri * Ua Huka rail, Gallirallus gracilitibia(subscription required) * Niue rail, Gallirallus huiatua (subscription required) * Tinian rail, Gallirallus pendiculentus * Aguiguan rail, Gallirallus pisonii * Mangaia rail, Gallirallus ripleyi * Tahuata rail, Gallirallus roletti * Tubuai rail, Gallirallus steadmani(subscription required) * Huahine rail, Gallirallus storrsolsoni * Rota rail, Gallirallus temptatus * \u2018Eua rail, Gallirallus vekamatolu - possibly survived to the early 19th centuryA similar bird was found to live on nearby Vava\u2018u in 1793. Given that G. vekamatolu was flightless, this may just as well represent a related species. * Hiva Oa rail, ?Gallirallus sp. * Vava'u Rail, Gallirallus [Hypotaenidia] vavauensis Worthy & Burley 2020. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * BirdLife International Globally Threatened Forums (2008).
