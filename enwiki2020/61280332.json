    "text": "Blood Quantum is a 2019 Canadian horror film written and directed by Jeff Barnaby and starring Michael Greyeyes, Elle-M\u00e1ij\u00e1 Tailfeathers, Forrest Goodluck, Kiowa Gordon, Brandon Oakes, Olivia Scriven, Kawenn\u00e1here Devery Jacobs, and Gary Farmer. The film depicts the effects of a zombie uprising on a First Nations reserve whose residents are immune to contracting the plague because of their indigenous heritage, but must still cope with the consequences of its effects on the world around them, including white refugees seeking shelter on the reserve. Blood Quantum premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, where it was named second runner-up for the People's Choice Award: Midnight Madness. The film was made available for streaming on Shudder in the United States, the United Kingdom and Ireland on April 28, 2020, and has received generally positive reviews from critics. ==Plot== In 1981, on the Red Crow Indian Reservation in Quebec, Canada, fisherman Gisigu catches a number of salmon, and observes that they continue to move after being gutted. Elsewhere that morning, Gisigu's son, indigenous sheriff Traylor, responds to a call about a dying dog that belongs to his ex- wife, nurse Joss. Traylor euthanizes the dog by gunshot. He goes to visit Joss, and learns that their son Joseph has been arrested for vandalism in a nearby town and is in jail with his half-brother Lysol. Traylor then visits Gisigu, who shows him the gutted yet moving salmon. Joss's dead dog reanimates in the trunk of Traylor's police car, and Traylor shoots it. Gisigu and Traylor set the dog and the fish on fire. Traylor and Joss head into town to free Joseph from jail. Traylor, Joseph, Lysol, and police officer Shamu encounter an ill, violent man in the jail who bites Joseph on the arm. Joseph goes to a hospital, where his white, pregnant girlfriend Charlie is waiting. That night, Traylor responds to a call from a indigenous man named Shooker. Traylor enters Shooker's house and is attacked and bitten by Shooker's white girlfriend, whom Traylor beats with the butt of a shotgun. Traylor and Shooker head to a bridge where Joss, Joseph and Charlie have found themselves after having escaped the hospital in an ambulance. Six months later, the outbreak of flesh-eating \"zeds\" has become widespread, and the Red Crow Reservation has been turned into a fortified compound. Its residents have learned that indigenous people cannot be infected by the \"zed\" plague, though white people can. Lysol has become increasingly aggressive towards Joseph and others' tendency to bring outsiders\u2014such as a man and his young daughter, the latter of whom was bitten by an infected person, as well as a girl named Lilith, who hides the fact that she has also been infected\u2014to the compound. That night, at Lysol's shelter away from the compound, Joseph finds a now-zombified Lilith chewing on the severed penis of Lysol. Joseph and Lysol drive back to the compound with Lilith in restraints. Lysol stabs Joseph with a knife, and lets Lilith loose inside the compound. Traylor and Gisigu, who went on a mission to eliminate zombies at a gas station with fellow tribesman Bumper, return to the compound to find it overrun with zombies. They learn that Joss, Joseph, Charlie, and eight other survivors are trapped in the basement of the compound. In the process of rescuing them, Traylor is eaten alive by zombies. Joss, Joseph and Charlie escape with Gisigu and Bumper. While Gisigu and Joseph enter a church to stop two associates of Lysol from murdering a group of survivors, Lysol finds Joss, Charlie and Bumper. Lysol kills Bumper and Joss shoots Lysol, but not before Lysol is able to unleash a zombie from the trunk of a car. The zombie bites Charlie, and Joseph arrives and kills the zombie. Joseph and Gisigu lead a wounded Lysol away from the scene, and Joseph stabs Lysol. Gisigu lets off a gunshot into the air, alerting zombies to the location where Lysol is; the zombies proceed to eat Lysol alive. Joseph, Charlie and Joss set out into a large body of water on a boat. Gisigu, armed with a sword, stays behind on land to fight off the zombies. On the boat, Charlie gives birth to a baby girl. Charlie, succumbing to her bite wound, asks Joseph to kill her before she transforms into a zombie, and he mournfully shoots her in the head. ==Cast== * Michael Greyeyes as Traylor * Elle-M\u00e1ij\u00e1 Tailfeathers as Joss * Forrest Goodluck as Joseph * Kiowa Gordon as Lysol * Olivia Scriven as Charlie * Stonehorse Lone Goeman as Gisigu * Brandon Oakes as Bumper * William Belleau as Shooker * Kawenn\u00e1here Devery Jacobs as James * Gary Farmer as Moon * Kent McQuaid as Shamu * Natalie Liconti as Lilith * Felicia Shulman as Doris ==Production== Blood Quantum was filmed in 2018, primarily at the Kahnawake and Listuguj reserves in Quebec and the city of Campbellton, New Brunswick.

Barnaby has described the film as offering commentary on colonialism. ==Release== Blood Quantum was brought to the Cannes Film Market in May 2019 as part of \"Fantastic 7\", a program of genre films sponsored by various international film festivals, where it was sponsored by the Toronto International Film Festival. Its public world premiere took place at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, where it was named second runner-up for the People's Choice Award: Midnight Madness. The film was acquired for international distribution on the Shudder streaming service in 2019, with Canadian streaming rights to be held by Crave.

The website's critics consensus reads: \"Blood Quantum blends bloody horror with sociopolitical subtext, taking a fresh bite out of the crowded zombie genre in the bargain.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 63 out of 100 based on 11 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Elisabeth Vincentelli of The New York Times gave the film a mostly positive review, writing that its \"central premise is inspired: When dead people come back to ersatz life, it turns out that Indigenous folks are immune \u2014 a sardonic twist on their ancestors succumbing to diseases imported by the European settlers.\" Matthew Monagle of The Austin Chronicle gave the film a score of three-and-a-half stars out of five, and wrote that it \"rejects the default white gaze of so many horror films, choosing to tell a story through an unapologetically Indigenous lens.\" Joe Lipsett of Bloody Disgusting wrote that \"Blood Quantum serves both as a reasonably entertaining zombie film, but more importantly, as a vital socio-political critique of real historical events in Canada.\" The Guardians Benjamin Lee gave the film three out of five stars, writing that it is \"best taken as a violent slab of late-night exploitation, made notable by a powerful conceit and some evocative visuals. It's just a shame that the execution can't quite catch up with the premise.\" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars, commending its action and social commentary but criticizing its \"poor performances and awkward dialogue\". David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a grade of \"C+\", writing: \"The filmmaking in Blood Quantum is seldom as compelling as its premise, and it's frustrating to watch such a fresh take on the zombie genre be mired in several of its most rotten tropes. [...] But when it works it works\". ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2019 films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian zombie films Category:Films directed by Jeff Barnaby Category:Films shot in Quebec Category:Films shot in New Brunswick Category:2019 horror films ",
