    "text": "Emma Bardac (n\u00e9e Moyse; 10 July 1862 \u2013 20 August 1934) was a French singer and the mutual love interest of both Gabriel Faur\u00e9 and Claude Debussy. Of Jewish descent, Emma married, aged 17, Parisian banker Sigismond Bardac, by whom she had two children: Raoul, and R\u00e9gina-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (later Madame Gaston de Tinan (1892\u20131985)). Emma was an accomplished singer and brilliant conversationalist. Faur\u00e9 wrote his Dolly Suite in the 1890s for Regina-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and La bonne chanson for Emma herself. Bardac's last home, now 23 Square Avenue Foch, Paris The Debussys' grave at Passy Cemetery After her affair with Faur\u00e9, Emma was introduced to Debussy in late 1903 by her son Raoul, one of his students.Nichols, The Life of Debussy, 111. In the summer of 1904, after a secret vacation with Emma in Jersey, Debussy wrote to his wife Rosalie (\"Lilly\") Texier announcing the end of their marriage. Distraught, Texier attempted suicide with a revolver in the Place de la Concorde. The ensuing scandal alienated Bardac and Debussy from friends and family, and in the spring of 1905 they fled to England, where they finalized their divorces, Emma from Sigismond on 4 May, Debussy from Rosalie on 2 August. They returned to Paris in time for the birth, on 30 October, of their daughter Claude-Emma, nicknamed \"Chouchou\", and dedicatee of his Children's Corner Suite composed in 1909.Diane Enget Moore (2005).

The couple bought a large house in a courtyard development off the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne (now Avenue Foch), where Debussy would reside for the rest of his life. Bardac eventually married Debussy in 1908, their troubled union enduring until Debussy's death 10 years later. Claude-Emma died while recovering from diphtheria in 1919 when the doctor gave her the wrong treatment, the year after her father's death. Emma Bardac died in 1934 and, like Claude-Emma, was laid to rest in Debussy's grave in the Cimeti\u00e8re de Passy in Paris. ==Media== In a documentary film called The Loves of Emma Bardac directed by Thomas Mowrey, the duo-pianists Katia and Marielle Lab\u00e8que perform a selection of pieces by composers Bizet, Faur\u00e9 and Debussy.
