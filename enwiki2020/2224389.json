    "text": "TeenStreet is an annual international week-long congress for Christian teenagers between 13 and 17 years old. It is presented by Operation Mobilisation. The first TeenStreet, held in Offenburg, Germany in 1993, hosted about 50 people. It was part of the Love Europe Congress. Today, over 4,500 teenagers and volunteers attend the German TeenStreet congress each summer. In recent years, TeenStreet events have also been launched and held annually in Uruguay, Brazil, India, South Africa, Malaysia, Australia and Faroe Islands. Each event is coordinated locally by Operation Mobilisation's home offices. Program direction is coordinated internationally, led by Dan & Suzie Potter and Josh & Debs Walker. The Director of TeenStreet International is Peter Magnusson. In the summer of 2007, Josh & Debs Walker assumed the responsibility of program leadership for TeenStreet in Germany. The leadership team for the biggest TeenStreet event in Germany consists of Ger van Veen (Fr), Steffen Zoege (D), Rene Zaensler (D), Janet & Henrik Weber (UK) and Christian Pilz (ES). TeenStreet was named by Dan & Suzie Potter also known as DUZIE. The name was created in November 1992 in Poland. It came as the result of needing a name that would be understood internationally. The \"Teen\" part was who it was for, and the \"Street\" part was about having a why to go. The purpose from the beginning was to motivate and equip Christian teens to have a real friendship with Jesus and reflecting Jesus in their world. As of August 2010 there have been 46 international TeenStreet congresses. ==German themes and locations== * 1993: Offenburg \u2013 You Can Change Your World * 1994: Friedrichshafen \u2013 Living in an Upside Down World * 1995: Wolfsburg \u2013 Another Day in Paradise * 1996: Mosbach \u2013 Original Copy * 1997: Offenburg \u2013 Theatre of Life * 1998: Wolfsburg \u2013 Dare To Dream * 1999: Offenburg \u2013 Inside Out Revolution * 2000: Mosbach \u2013 The Image * 2001: Offenburg \u2013 Kingdom Come * 2002: Oldenburg \u2013 Secrets Revealed * 2003: Offenburg \u2013 re:Discovering Jesus * 2004: Oldenburg \u2013 Driving At The Speed Of Life * 2005: M\u00fcnster \u2013 Time Machine: Remember The Future * 2006: Offenburg \u2013 Metamorphosis: The Heart of Change * 2007: Oldenburg \u2013 Contagious: Infect Your Sphere * 2008: Oldenburg \u2013 Blindsight * 2009: Offenburg \u2013 Impossible * 2010: Oldenburg \u2013 PS XXIII * 2011: Offenburg \u2013 \"REAL\" * 2012: Oldenburg \u2013 \"NewSong 40\" * 2013: Offenburg \u2013 \">>MORE\" * 2014: M\u00fcnster \u2013 \"OPEN\" * 2015: Offenburg \u2013 \"Home\" * 2016: Oldenburg \u2013 \"Life\" * 2017: Offenburg \u2013 \"Unshakeable\" * 2018: Oldenburg \u2013 \"CLOSER\" * 2019: Offenburg \u2013 \"Inspired\" ==Brazilian themes and locations== * 2004: Brazil: Maring\u00e1 \u2013 re:Discovering Jesus (January) * 2005: Brazil: Maring\u00e1 \u2013 Driving At The Speed Of Life (January) * 2006: Brazil: Maring\u00e1 \u2013 Time Machine: Remember the Future (22\u201327 January 2006) * 2007: Brazil: Maring\u00e1 \u2013 Metamorphosis: The Heart of Change (January) * 2008: Brazil: Maring\u00e1 Contagious (20\u201327 January 2008) * 2009: Brazil: Maring\u00e1 \u2013 Blind (26\u201331 January 2009) * 2010: Brazil: Maring\u00e1 \u2013 Impossible (25\u201331 January 2010) * 2011: Brazil: Maring\u00e1 \u2013 PS XXIII (17\u201323 January 2011) ==External links== *Teenstreet Website *TeenStreet Brazil *TeenStreet Germany with Live Magazine *TiM (Teens in Mission) *Operation Mobilisation *Young-Hope.net *TeenStreet Australia *Teenstreet Faroe Islands *DUZIE Category:Evangelical parachurch organizations Category:Christian missions Category:1993 establishments in Germany Category:Recurring events established in 1993 ",
