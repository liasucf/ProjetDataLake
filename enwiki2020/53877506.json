    "text": "Have A Go was a BBC Radio show that ran from 1946 to 1967. Hosted by Wilfred Pickles and co-presented with his wife Mabel (nee Myerscough), it involved the couple travelling to venues around the UK and speaking to members of the public, who were then invited to answer quiz questions in the hope of winning a small amount of money. It was the first quiz show in Britain to offer such a prize. Pickles' presentation style resulted in catchphrases as \"How do, how are yer?\", \"Are yer courting?\", \"What's on the table, Mabel?\" and \"Give him the money, Mabel\". The programme's popularity was such that at one time it was attracting an estimated 20 million listeners weekly. ==References== Category:BBC Radio programmes Category:British radio game shows Category:1940s British game shows Category:1950s British game shows Category:1960s British game shows Category:1946 radio programme debuts Category:1967 radio programme debuts ",
