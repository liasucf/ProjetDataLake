    "text": "Edgar Warren Hymer (February 25, 1906 - March 25, 1948) was an American actor. He was born in New York City. His father, John Bard Hymer (1875 or 1876-1953) was a playwright (with nine Broadway plays to his credit, according to the Internet Broadway Database), vaudeville writer and actor, while his mother, Eleanor Kent, was an actress. He appeared in 129 films between 1929 and 1946, as well as the 1928 Broadway play The Grey Fox. Despite his typical screen persona as an unsophisticated tough guy with a Brooklyn accent, he actually attended Yale University. In the late 1930s, Columbia Pictures head Harry Cohn had him removed from the studio after he showed up for work drunk. Hymer responded by breaking into Cohn's office and urinating on his desk. Cohn then blackballed him in the film industry, making it hard for him to find work. He died in Los Angeles, California, of a \"stomach ailment\". His remains are buried at Chapel of the Pines Crematory. ==Filmography== * Speakeasy (1929) - Cannon Delmont * The Far Call (1929) - Soup Brophy * Fox Movietone Follies of 1929 (1929) - Martin * The Cock-Eyed World (1929) - Marine Corporal Scout (uncredited) * The Girl from Havana (1929) - Spike Howard * Frozen Justice (1929) - Bartender * The Lone Star Ranger (1930) - Bowery Kid * Men Without Women (1930) - Kaufman * Born Reckless (1930) - Big Shot * Up the River (1930) - Dannemora Dan * Sinners' Holiday (1930) - Mitch * Oh, For a Man!
