    "text": "Gretchen Mol (born November 8, 1972) is an American actress and former model. She is known for her role as Gillian Darmody in the HBO series Boardwalk Empire (2010\u20132014). She also appeared in the films Rounders (1998), Celebrity (1998), The Thirteenth Floor (1999), The Notorious Bettie Page (2005), in which she played the title character, 3:10 to Yuma (2007), and Manchester by the Sea (2016). ==Early life== Mol was born in Deep River, Connecticut, where her mother, Janet (n\u00e9e Morgan), is an artist and teacher, and her father is a teacher at RHAM High School. She went to high school with Broadway actor Peter Lockyer, with whom she performed in school musicals and plays. Her brother, Jim Mol, is a director and editor in the film industry. Mol attended The American Musical and Dramatic Academy and graduated from the William Esper Studio. After summer stock in Vermont, she took a job for a while as an usher at Angelika Film Center. She was living in a Hell's Kitchen walk-up when she was noticed by a talent agent who spotted her working as a hat-check girl at Michael's Restaurant in New York. ==Stage== Mol's acting career began in summer stock theatre in Vermont where she played a variety of roles, including Godspell and 110 in the Shade. She played Jenny in Neil LaBute's The Shape of Things on stage in both London and New York in 2001, in a role she reprised in the film version, released in 2003. The New York Times critic Ben Brantley, in his review of the play (which he disliked), wrote, \"[Mol] gives by far the most persuasive performance as the unworldly Jenny, and you wind up feeling for her disproportionately, only because she seems to be entirely there, in the present tense\". In 2004, Mol spent a year singing and dancing as Roxie Hart in the Broadway production of Chicago. In 2014\u20132015, Mol played the role of Emily in the Broadway debut of Ayad Akhtar's Pulitzer-Prize-winning play Disgraced. ==Film== In 1994, Mol was spotted by photographer David William Powell.New York Photographer in Australia He photographed her in New York's Central Park and replaced her unrepresentative portfolio with professional- looking black-and-white images which landed her on the cover of W within weeks, and foreshadowed her \"It Girl\" and \"Bettie Page\" looks. Shortly afterwards, she ended her brief modeling career and entered acting full-time. While major roles have been sporadic, Mol has been in more than 30 feature films. She made her film debut in Spike Lee's 1996 film, Girl 6. She said, \"I was auditioning for Guiding Light and I was happy I got a Spike-Lee movie, which was a tiny part, but all of a sudden I had Spike Lee on my resume. I didn't audition for day player anymore\". After Girl 6, New York filmmaker Abel Ferrara took notice and cast her in two movies, The Funeral (1996) and New Rose Hotel (1998). She had a small role in Donnie Brasco (1997), but by now, she was being typecast as \"the girlfriend\", which she attempted to change by taking a role opposite Jude Law in Music from Another Room (1998), a romantic comedy. The film went virtually unnoticed by critics and audiences. In 1998, she appeared in several notable films, including Rounders, starring Matt Damon and Woody Allen's Celebrity opposite Leonardo DiCaprio. In 1998, she also came to prominence when she was featured on the cover of Vanity Fair, dubbed the \"It Girl of the Nineties\" by the magazine. For her second film with Woody Allen, 1999's Sweet and Lowdown, she played a minor role which the Greenwich Village Gazette called \"notable\". She played the female lead role in the 1999 film The Thirteenth Floor. She played the victim of a con artist in the 2003 film Heavy Put-Away, based on the Terry Southern story. In 2006, she shared the lead in a romantic comedy, Puccini for Beginners, in which her character has a lesbian affair. Mol worked with Mary Harron for two years as the director struggled to finance The Notorious Bettie Page: \"I kind of felt like I lived with it for a while; certainly not as long as Mary Harron did but I got a good chance to really feel like I knew something about Bettie so by the time the role was mine and I was on set, I was pretty confident. I felt like I really worked for it.\" The next year, 2007, was one of her busiest, with four films in production or in release, including a remake of 3:10 to Yuma starring Russell Crowe, and An American Affair, in which her character, Catherine Caswell, has an affair with John F. Kennedy. When released in February 2009, the film was harshly criticized by New York Times critic Stephen Holden, though he said that Mol's part was \"quite well acted\".Stephen Holden, \"An American Affair (2009)\", New York Times, February 27, 2009 In April 2008, she began filming Tenure in Philadelphia, working opposite Luke Wilson and Andrew Daly.
