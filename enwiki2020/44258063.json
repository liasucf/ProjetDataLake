Perry as Matthews *Jay Richardson as Daniel *Andr\u00e9 Lima as John Paul *Laura Putney as Jackie *Halder Gomes as Carlos *Odilon Camargo as Roy *Alexandre Picarelli as Mark ==Production== Working as stunt in American martial arts films, Gomes came with the idea of producing a martial art film shot in his birth city, Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1. However, Gomes prepared no script, then he went to a local film school and announced he was looking for a script writer for a martial arts film. The next step was to raise funds, which was done through gubernamental tax incentives. For the casting Gomes put an ad in the Back Stage West, and received about 3,000 subsmissions. He was worried to cast people who had already travelled to another country because he thought the recentness of September 11 attacks could affect actor's performance. The film was shot both in Cear\u00e1 and Los Angeles during a period of four weeks. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2004 martial arts films Category:2004 films Category:American films Category:American martial arts films Category:Films directed by Halder Gomes Category:Films shot in Fortaleza Category:Films shot in Los Angeles ",
