    "text": "A sister school is usually a pair of schools, usually single-sex school, one with female students and the other with male students. This relationship is seen to benefit both schools. For instance, when Harvard University was a male-only school, Radcliffe University was its sister school. The sister school concept as a single-sex school began to change as several institutions adopted coeducational environments starting in the 1970s due to the increasing awareness or consciousness about sex bias and discrimination. == Background== The term sister school (or brother school) has several alternate meanings: * a definite financial commerce between two colleges or universities * two schools that have a strong historical connection * two schools which have social activities involving students from both schools * two schools under the same management * two schools built using the same floor plan/layout * two schools in different nations that have established a collaborative international partnership. ==See also== *Seven Sisters (colleges) ==References== ==External links== *Dictionary definition *A collaborative international partnership Category:Types of university or college Category:School terminology ",
