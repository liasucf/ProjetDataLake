    "text": "Eva Y. Andrei is an American condensed matter physicist, currently a Distinguished Professor and Board of Governors Professor at Rutgers University. Her research focuses on emergent properties of matter arising from collective behavior of many particles, especially low-dimensional phenomena under low temperatures and high magnetic fields. ==Education and training== Andrei received her bachelor's degree from the Tel Aviv University and her Ph.D. from Rutgers University. She then worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Bell Labs. ==Career== Andrei began her independent career in 1987 as an assistant professor at Rutgers. One of her first major contributions was establishing the existence of a Wigner solid in a 2D electron plasma. More recently she has made major contributions to the study of graphene, including detection of ballistic transport of charge carriers and the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect in graphene. ==Awards and honors== * Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences * Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science * Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences * Fellow of the American Physical Society ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Scientists from Bucharest\u200e Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Category:Rutgers University faculty Category:Tel Aviv University alumni Category:Rutgers University alumni Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society ",
