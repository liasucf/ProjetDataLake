    "text": "Fillan is a former municipality in the old S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. The former municipality existed from 1886 until its dissolution in 1964. It is now part of the municipality of Hitra in Tr\u00f8ndelag county. The municipality included the northeastern part of the island of Hitra surrounding the Fillfjorden, plus about 100 islands, islets, and skerries--including Fjellv\u00e6rs\u00f8ya and Ulv\u00f8ya. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Fillan. Other villages in the municipality included Ansnes, Nordbotn, and Ulvan. The former municipality had a church and a chapel in it, both of which now form a parish within the present-day municipality of Hitra. The Fillan church is located in the village of Fillan and the Nordbotn chapel is located on the island of Fjellv\u00e6rs\u00f8ya. ==History== The municipality of Fillan was established on 1 January 1886 when it was separated from the municipality of Hitra to form a municipality of its own. The initial population of the new municipality was 2,241. On 1 July 1914, the southern district of Sandstad was separated from Fillan to form its own municipality, leaving 1,543 residents in Fillan. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the neighboring municipalities of Fillan, Sandstad, Kvenv\u00e6r, and Hitra were merged to re-form the old pre-1886 Hitra municipality. Prior to the merger, Fillan had 1,759 residents. ==Government== All municipalities in Norway, including Fillan, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. ===Municipal council=== The municipal council of Fillan was made up of 17 representatives that were elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows: ==Media gallery== FillanCommunityCentre.JPG|View of the village of Fillan Fillan.JPG|View of the village of Fillan Fillan krike.JPG|Fillan Church Foggy morning Knarrlagsund.jpg|Knarrlagsund village ==See also== *List of former municipalities of Norway ==References== Category:Hitra Category:Former municipalities of Norway Category:1886 establishments in Norway Category:1964 disestablishments in Norway ",
