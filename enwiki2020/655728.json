He was briefly engaged in the mid-1530s to Anne of Cleves, who in 1540 would become the fourth wife of King Henry VIII of England. Their betrothal would be used by Henry to break his marriage to Anne after six short months. On 10 July 1541, Francis married Princess Christina of Denmark in Brussels. Princess Christina was a daughter of King Christian II and Isabella of Burgundy (who had herself been a potential bride of Henry VIII). Francis died at Remiremont in 1545, leaving Christina as the Regent of Lorraine and as the guardian of their young children. ==Children== By Christina of Denmark (c.1521 \u2013 1590; married in 1541) {| border=1 style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\" |- bgcolor=cccccc !Name!!Birth!!Death!!Notes |- |Charles ||1543||1608||married Claude of Valois and had issue. |- |Renata ||1544||1602|| married William V, Duke of Bavaria and had issue. |- |Dorothea ||1545||1621||married in 1575, Eric II, Duke of Calenberg |} ==Ancestry== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * ==See also== * Dukes of Lorraine family tree * List of rulers of Lorraine Category:1517 births Category:1545 deaths Category:People from Nancy, France Category:House of Lorraine Category:Hereditary Princes of Lorraine Category:Dukes of Lorraine Category:Dukes of Bar Category:Marquesses of Pont-\u00e0-Mousson ",
