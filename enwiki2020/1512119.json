    "text": "The prime constant is the real number \\rho whose nth binary digit is 1 if n is prime and 0 if n is composite or 1. In other words, \\rho is simply the number whose binary expansion corresponds to the indicator function of the set of prime numbers. That is, : \\rho = \\sum_{p} \\frac{1}{2^p} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\chi_{\\mathbb{P}}(n)}{2^n} where p indicates a prime and \\chi_{\\mathbb{P}} is the characteristic function of the primes. The beginning of the decimal expansion of \u03c1 is: \\rho = 0.414682509851111660248109622\\ldots The beginning of the binary expansion is: \\rho = 0.011010100010100010100010000\\ldots_2 ==Irrationality== The number \\rho is easily shown to be irrational. To see why, suppose it were rational. Denote the kth digit of the binary expansion of \\rho by r_k. Then, since \\rho is assumed rational, there must exist N, k positive integers such that r_n=r_{n+ik} for all n > N and all i \\in \\mathbb{N}. Since there are an infinite number of primes, we may choose a prime p > N. By definition we see that r_p=1. As noted, we have r_p=r_{p+ik} for all i \\in \\mathbb{N}. Now consider the case i=p. We have r_{p+i \\cdot k}=r_{p+p \\cdot k}=r_{p(k+1)}=0, since p(k+1) is composite because k+1 \\geq 2. Since r_p eq r_{p(k+1)} we see that \\rho is irrational. ==External links== * Category:Irrational numbers Category:Prime numbers Category:Articles containing proofs Category:Mathematical constants ",
