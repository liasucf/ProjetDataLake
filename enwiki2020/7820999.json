    "text": "Holders of the office of Lord Chamberlain of Scotland are known from about 1124. It was ranked by King Malcolm as the third great Officer of State, called Camerarius Domini Regis, and had a salary of \u00a3200 per annum allotted to him. He anciently collected the revenues of the Crown, at least before Scotland had a Treasurer, of which office there is no vestige of until the restoration of King James I when he disbursed the money necessary for the maintenance of the King's Household. The Great Chamberlain had jurisdiction for judging of all crimes committed within burgh, and of the crime of forestalling; and was in effect Justice-General over the burghs, and held Chamberlain-ayrs every year for that purpose; the form whereof is set down in Iter Camerarii, the Chamberlain-ayr. He was a supreme judge and his Decrees could not be questioned by any inferior judicatory. His sentences were to be put into execution by the baillies of burghs. He also settled the prices of provisions within burghs, and the fees of the workmen in the Mint. The Chamberlain lost his financial functions after 1425 to the Treasurer. The position was vacant from 1558 to 1565 and again from 1569. It was occupied in 1580 for the cousin of James I, Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, whose appearance as a Great Officer of State in 1581 is attributable to his personal standing with the king rather than his office. But following the Raid of Ruthven, 24 August 1582, the Great Chamberlain lost his supervision of the royal burghs. Thereafter the office was held by successive Dukes of Lennox (heritably from 1603) until resigned to the Crown ad perpetuam remanentiam by the Duke of Richmond and Lennox in 1703, since which time no Great Chamberlain has been appointed. In 1711 a form of the office was revived in a Commission of Chamberlainry and Trade, which lapsed on the death of Queen Anne. ==Lord Chamberlains== ;David I of Scotland () * Edmund, witnessed a charter granting Annandale to Robert de Brus in 1124. * 1130-1153: Herbert ;Malcolm IV of Scotland () * 1153-1160: Herbert * 1160-1165: Nicolaus, later Lord Chancellor ;William the Lion () * 1165-1189: Walter de Berkeley of Redcastle * 1205-14: Philip de Valognes ;Alexander II of Scotland () * 1214-19: William de Valognes * Hugo de Giffard, Lord of Yester and Morham * John de Melville * 1216: Henry de Balliol (d. 1246) * 1228: David de Bernham (later Bishop of St Andrews) * 1231-41: Sir John de Maccuswel (or Maxwell) ;Alexander III of Scotland () * c.1250/1: Sir Robert de Meyners * 1252-1255: William, Earl of Mar * 1255-1257: David de Lindsay of Barnweill and Byres * 1257-60: Aylmer de Maxwell lord of Caerlaverock, Sheriff of Dumfries, son of Sir John Maxwell. * 1260: William, Earl of Mar, again * 1267: Sir Reginald Cheyne * 1269: Sir Thomas Randolph, father of Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray, * 1278: John de Lindsay ;Guardians of the Kingdom of Scotland (First Interregnum)(1286-1292) * 1287-1292: Alexander de Baliol ;John Balliol () * 1292-1296: Alexander de Baliol ;Guardians of the Kingdom of Scotland (Second Interregnum) (1296-1306) *1297-1307: John Sandale ;Robert the Bruce () * 1307: Eustace de Cotesbache * 1319: William de Lindsay * 1325: Alexander Fraser of Touchfraser and Cowie (who married Mary, the King's sister) ;David II of Scotland () * 1329: John Baptista * 1327-1329: Robert de Peebles * 1329-1333: Reginald de Mure * 1333: Sir Robert de Lawedre of The Bass (d. 1337) (also Justiciar) * 1334: William Bullock, under Edward Balliol * 1334-1340: Reginald de Mure * 1341-1342: William Bullock, again * 1343-1346: John de Roxburgh * c.1350-1357: Sir Robert de Erskine * 1357-1358: Thomas Stewart, 2nd Earl of Angus * 1358-1359: Thomas, Earl of Mar * 1359-1363: Walter Fleming of Biggar * c1363-1364: Sir Robert de Erskine, again * 1364-1371: Walter of Biggar, again ;Robert II of Scotland () * 1371-1376: Walter of Biggar, again * 1376: Michael de Monymusk, Bishop of Dunkeld * 1377-1382: Sir John Lyon * 1382: Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife ;Robert III of Scotland () ;James I of Scotland () * 1424-1448: Sir John Forrester of Corstorphine, Knt.The Scottish Nation, Edinburgh, 1867, vol.v, p.250, appointment after August 1424.The Exchequer Rolls of Scotland edited by George Burnett, Lord Lyon King of Arms, vol.v, 1437-1454, Edinburgh, 1882, pps:108, 258, and 297 - the last mention as Chancellor. ;James II of Scotland () * 1448: James Livingstone, 1st Lord LivingstonThe Exchequer Rolls of Scotland edited by George Burnett, Lord Lyon King of Arms, vol.v, 1437-1454, Edinburgh, 1882, p.312, first mention in this capacity and the year of death of Forrester, his predecessor. ;James III of Scotland () * 1467: Robert Boyd, 1st Lord Boyd * 1477: James Stewart, 1st Earl of Buchan * 1483: David Lindsay, 5th Earl of Crawford ;James IV of Scotland () * 1488: Alexander Home, 2nd Lord Home * 1509: Alexander Home, 3rd Lord Home ;James V of Scotland () * 1516: Malcolm Fleming, 3rd Lord Fleming (d. 1547 at Battle of Pinkie) ;Mary, Queen of Scots () * 1547: James Fleming, 4th Lord Fleming (d. 1558) ;James VI of Scotland () * 1565: John Fleming, 5th Lord Fleming (d. 1572)Cracrofts Peerage * 1581: Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox * 1594: Ludovick (or Louis) Stewart, Duke of Lennox (made heritable Chamberlains). ==References== * The Staggering State of the Scots' Statesmen, by Sir John Scot of Scotstarvet, Director of Chancery, Edinburgh, 1754, pps: xx - xxii, and 186-188. * The Exchequer Rolls of Scotland, edited by George Burnett, Lord Lyon King of Arms, vol.II, 1359\u20131379, Edinburgh, 1878, in the appendix to the Preface is a list of Chamberlains of Scotland.
