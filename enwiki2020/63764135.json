    "text": "Lynne Olver (1958\u20132015) was a librarian and food historian, and the sole author of the Food Timeline website. ==Personal life== Olver graduated from the University of Albany (SUNY). She was a librarian at the Morris County Library, New Jersey, and became its director in 2009. == The Food Timeline == In 1999, Olver created The Food Timeline, a culinary history website which documents food history and recipes. The website has since become a major information source for culinary history. Almost all of the website's information comes from Lynne's personal library of over 2,000 books. Unlike many other food related websites, Olver gave citations to almost every statement on her site so that readers can verify her claims. Her research has been cited in peer-reviewed journals. Following her death, the site was given to her family, who chose to remove social media accounts associated with the Food Timeline, but kept the website running in a state of dormancy. As such, the website is no longer maintained. The site's domain supposedly expires in 2025, but , the WHOIS database shows that is set to lapse in April 2022. It has been widely reported that the Olver family is searching for a person or persons to maintain and possibly grow the website. ==Audio interviews== * * * * == External links == * The Food Timeline website (archived) == References == Category:Food historians Category:1958 births Category:2015 deaths Category:University at Albany, SUNY alumni ",
