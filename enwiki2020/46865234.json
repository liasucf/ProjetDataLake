In 1970 Illiani adopted the stage name Donatello and entered the competition at the Sanremo Music Festival with the song \"Io mi fermo qui\", presented in a double performance with the band Dik Dik. The same year Donatello got his first commercial success with the song \"Malattia d'amore\" which charted tenth on the Italian hit parade. Between 1971 and 1973 he entered the main competition at the Sanremo Music Festival three more times, always being a finalist. In the same years he got two top ten hits with the songs \"Com'\u00e8 dolce la sera\" and \"Ti voglio\".
