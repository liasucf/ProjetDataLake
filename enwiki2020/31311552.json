    "text": "AvaGlide is avatar-based title, developed by British indie studio Haiku Interactive and published on the Xbox Live Indie Games channel. It was released in 2010, and praised for its visuals and gameplay. ==Gameplay== AvaGlide uses a player's Xbox avatar in a series of hang-gliding minigames. Three minigames include navigating the glider through rings to collect points and time bonuses, hitting targets with crates dropped while gliding, and a course to collect as many points as possible. Multiplayer functionality is enabled. ==Graphics rendering== AvaGlide uses the SunBurn XNA Game Engine (by Synapse Gaming) and a professional physics library, producing detailed textures and real-time shadows. The physics engine enables smooth gliding, complete with wind gusts and speed regulation that add dimension to the challenges. ==References== ==External links== * AvaGlide webpage * AvaGlide's developer, Haiku Interactive Category:2010 video games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Indie video games Category:Xbox 360 Live Indie games Category:Xbox 360-only games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ",
