    "text": "This list of impact craters on Earth contains a selection of the 190 confirmed craters given in the Earth Impact Database. To keep the lists manageable, only the largest craters within a time period are included. Alphabetical lists for different continents can be found under #Craters by continent below. ==Confirmed impact craters listed by size and age== These features were caused by the collision of meteors (consisting of large fragments of asteroids) or comets (consisting of ice, dust particles and rocky fragments) with the Earth. For eroded or buried craters, the stated diameter typically refers to the best available estimate of the original rim diameter, and may not correspond to present surface features. Time units are either in thousands (ka) or millions (Ma) of years. ===10 ka or less=== Less than ten thousand years old, and with a diameter of or more. The EID lists fewer than ten such craters, and the largest in the last 100,000 years (100 ka) is the Rio Cuarto crater in Argentina.Bland, Phil A.; de Souza Filho, C. R.; Timothy Jull, A. J.; Kelley, Simon P.; Hough, Robert Michael; Artemieva, N. A.; Pierazzo, E.; Coniglio, J.; Pinotti, Lucio; Evers, V.; Kearsley, Anton; (2002); \"A possible tektite strewn field in the Argentinian Pampa\", Science, volume 296, issue 5570, pp. 1109\u201312 However, there is some uncertainty regarding its origins and age, with some sources giving it as < 10 ka while the EID gives a broader < 100 ka. The Kaali impacts (c. 2000 BC) during the Nordic Bronze Age may have influenced Estonian and Finnish mythology, the Campo del Cielo (c. 2000 BC) could be in the legends of some Native American tribes, while Henbury (c. 2200 BC) has figured in Australian Aboriginal oral traditions.

The EID gives a size of about for Campo del Cielo, but other sources quote . ===10 ka to 1 Ma=== From between 10 thousand years to one million years ago, and with a diameter of or more. The largest in the last one million years is the Zhamanshin crater in Kazakhstan and has been described as being capable of producing a nuclear-like winter.Essay \"Impact Cratering on Earth\", based on: However, the currently unknown source of the enormous Australasian strewnfield (c. 780 ka) could be a crater about across.Povenmire, Harold; Liu, W.; Xianlin, Luo; (1999) \"Australasian tektites found in Guangxi Province, China\", in Proceedings of the 30th Annual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Houston, March 1999Glass, Billy P.; Pizzuto, James E.; (1994) \"Geographic variation in Australasian microtektite concentrations: Implications concerning the location and size of the source crater\", Journal of Geophysical Research, vol. 99, no.

If uncertainties regarding its age are resolved, then the largest in the last 10 million years would be the Karakul crater which is listed in EID with an age of less than five Ma, or the Pliocene. The large but apparently craterless Eltanin impact (2.5 Ma) into the Pacific Ocean has been suggested as contributing to the glaciations and cooling during the Pliocene. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Name !Location !Country !Diameter (km) !Age (million years) !Coordinates |- |Bosumtwi |Ashanti |Ghana | | |align=right| |- |Elgygytgyn |Chukotka Autonomous Okrug |Russia | | |align=right| |- |Bigach |Kazakhstan |Kazakhstan | | |align=right| |- |Karla |Tatarstan |Russia | | |align=right| |- |Karakul |Pamir Mountains |Tajikistan | | |align=right| |} ===10 Ma or more=== Craters with diameter or more are all older than 10 Ma, except possibly Karakul, , whose age is uncertain. There are more than forty craters of such size. The largest two within the last hundred million years have been linked to two extinction events: Chicxulub for the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene and the Popigai impact for the Eocene\u2013Oligocene extinction event.

The table below is arranged by the continent's percentage of the Earth's land area, and where Asian and Russian craters are grouped together per EID convention.

It is suggested this situation is an artifact, highlighting the importance of intensifying research in less studied areas like Antarctica, South America and elsewhere.
