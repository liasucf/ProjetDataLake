    "text": "An used for an game, a part of k\u014dd\u014d is the art of appreciating Japanese incense, and involves using incense within a structure of codified conduct. K\u014dd\u014d includes all aspects of the incense process, from the , to activities such the incense-comparing games kumik\u014d () and genjik\u014d (). K\u014dd\u014d is counted as one of the three classical Japanese arts of refinement, along with kad\u014d for flower arrangement, and chad\u014d for tea and the tea ceremony. == Etymology == Kanji characters for K\u014dd\u014d The word \u9999 k\u014d is written with the Chinese Kangxi radical 186 composed of nine strokes, which can also be expanded up to 18 strokes \u99ab. Translated it means \"fragrance\"; however in this context may also be translated as \"incense\". The word \u9053 d\u014d (written with the same character as Chinese tao/dao) means \"way\", both literally (street) and metaphorically (a stream of life experience). The suffix -\u9053 generally denotes, in the broadest sense, the totality of a movement as endeavor, tradition, practice and ethos. In the search for a suitable term, translations of such words into English sometimes focus on a narrower aspect of the original term. One common translation in context is \"ceremony\", which entails the process of preparation and smelling in general, but not a specific instance. In some instances, it functions similarly to the English suffix -ism, and as in the case of tea (chad\u014d/sad\u014d \u8336\u9053) one sees teaism in works dating from early efforts at illustrating sad\u014d in English, focusing on its philosophy and ethos. Conversely, the sense of the English phrase the way of X appears to have broadened in response to the need to translate such terms, and to have become more productive with the need to describe with a similar breadth of compass certain things in Western experience. == History == Fragrant scent played an important role at court during the Heian period (image from The Tale of Genji by Tosa Mitsuoki, 1617-91.) Incense burner (k\u014dro) with peonies, Hirado ware, circa 1800 from Edo According to legend, agarwood (aloeswood) first came to Japan when a log of incense wood drifted ashore on Awaji island in the third year of Empress Suiko's reign (595 CE). People who found the incense wood noticed that the wood smelled marvelous when they put it near a fire. Then they presented the wood to local officials. Japan was the eastern end of the Silk Road. Incense was brought from China over Korea and developed over 1000 years. The history starts in the 6th century CE when Buddhism arrived during the Asuka period. Agarwood is known to have come along with the supplies to build a temple in 538 CE. A ritual known as sonaek\u014d became established. K\u014dboku, fragrant wood combined with herbs and other aromatic substances, was burned to provide incense for religious purposes. The custom of burning incense was further developed and blossomed amongst the court nobility. Pastime of takimono, a powdered mixture of aromatic substances, developed. Fragrant scents played a vital role at court life during the Heian period, robes and even fans were perfumed and poems written about them, it also featured prominently in the epic The Tale of Genji in the 11th century. Samurai warriors would prepare for battle by purifying their minds and bodies with the incense of k\u014dboku. They also developed an appreciation for its fragrances. In the late Muromachi period in the 16th century, this aesthetic awareness would develop into the accomplishment known as k\u014dd\u014d, which is the art of enjoying the incense of smouldering k\u014dboku. The present style of k\u014dd\u014d has largely retained the structure and manner of the Muromachi period, during this time the tea ceremony and the ikebana style of flower arrangement developed as well. Expertise concerning tiny pieces of exotic aromatic woods led in the 15th and 16th centuries to the creation of various games or contests. Some depended on the memorization of scents, some involved sequences that held clues to classic poems, some merely a matter of identifying matching aromas. Incense games became a \"way\" (d\u014d), an avocation. The way of incense eventually spread from elite circles to townsmen. During the Tensh\u014d era in the late 16th century, the master craftsmen K\u014dju was employed at the Kyoto Imperial Palace and practiced incense ceremony. The third K\u014dju served under Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the fourth under Tokugawa Ieyasu. The eighth K\u014dju Takae Jyuemon was known as a particular master of incense of note. During this time the \u201cTen Virtues of K\u014d\u201d (\u9999\u306e\u5341\u5fb3, k\u014dnoj\u016btoku) were formulated, which is a traditional listing of the benefits derived from the proper and correct use of quality incense: # \u611f\u683c\u9b3c\u795e : Sharpens the senses # \u6e05\u6d44\u5fc3\u8eab : Purifies the body and the spirit # \u80fd\u6255\u6c5a\u7a62 : Eliminates pollutants # \u80fd\u899a\u7761\u7720 : Awakens the spirit # \u9759\u4e2d\u6210\u53cb : Heals loneliness # \u5875\u88cf\u6109\u9591 : Calms in turbulent times # \u591a\u800c\u4e0d\u53ad : Is not unpleasant, even in abundance # \u52df\u800c\u77e5\u8db3 : Even in small amounts is sufficient # \u4e45\u8535\u4e0d\u673d : Does not break down after a very long time # \u5e38\u7528\u7121\u969c : A common use is not harmful Even today, there is a strong relationship and holistic approach in k\u014dd\u014d between fragrant scent, the senses, the human spirit, and nature. The spirituality and refined concentration that is central to k\u014dd\u014d places it on the same level as kad\u014d and chad\u014d. == Material == In k\u014dd\u014d, a small piece of fragrant wood is heated on a small Mica plate (Gin-yo), which is heated from below by a piece of charcoal that is surrounded by ash. All this is held in a small ceramic censer that can look like a cup. It is not usual for wood or incense sticks to be burned because that would create smoke; only the essential aromatic oils should be released from the wood through the heat below it. Aloeswood, also known as agarwood (\u6c88\u9999 jink\u014d), is produced in certain parts of southeast Asia such as Vietnam. The trees secrete an aromatic resin, which over time then turns into k\u014dboku (\u9999\u6728). One particular grade of k\u014dboku with a high oil content and superior fragrance is called kyara (\u4f3d\u7f85). Another important material is sandalwood (\u767d\u6a80 byakudan), which originates primarily from India, Indonesia, southern China or other parts of southeast Asia. Sandalwood trees need around 60 years to produce their signature fragrance that can be deemed acceptable to be used for k\u014ddo. Other materials used are cinnamon bark (\u6842\u76ae keihi), chebulic myrobalan (\u8bc3\u5b50 kashi), clove (\u4e01\u5b50 choji), ginger lily (sanna), lavender, licorice (\u7518\u8349\u5c5e kanz\u014d), patchouli (\u5ee3\u85ff\u9999 kakk\u014d), spikenard (\u5319\u8449\u7518\u9b06 kansho), camomile, rhubarb (\u5927\u9ec4 daioh), safflower (\u7d05\u82b1 benibana), star anise (\u5927\u8334\u9999 dai uikyo) and other herbs. Shell fragrances (\u8c9d\u9999 kaik\u014d) and other animal-derived aromatic materials are also used. Ranjyatai, a historical kyara wood dating to the 10th century CE, kept at the Sh\u014ds\u014din treasury in Nara Raw materials such as agarwood are becoming increasingly rare due to the depletion of the wild resource. This has made prime material very expensive. For example, the cost of lower grade kyara is about 20,000 yen per gram. Top quality kyara costs over 40,000 yen per gram, or many times the equivalent weight of gold (as of late 2012). Though it can only be warmed and used once for a formal ceremony, it can be stored for hundreds of years. If the particular piece of incense wood has a history, the price can be even higher. The highest regarded wood, Ranjyatai (\u862d\u5962\u5f85), dates back to at least the 10th century and is kyara wood from Laos or Vietnam, and was used by emperors and warlords for its fragrance. It is said to contain so much resin that it can be used many times over. The wood is kept at the Sh\u014ds\u014din treasury in Nara, which is under the administration of the Imperial Household. The high costs and difficulty in obtaining acceptable raw material is one of the reasons why k\u014dd\u014d is not as widely practiced or known compared to the art of flower arrangement or the tea ceremony. One of the oldest traditional incense companies in Japan is Baieido, founded in 1657 with roots going back to the Muromachi period. Other traditional and still operating companies include Kyukyodo (1663, Kyoto) and Shoyeido, founded in 1705. Nippon Kodo is also a major supplier of incense material. ==Types of incense== Sasaki D\u014dy\u014d (1306\u20131373), who was regarded as a paragon of elegance and luxury and the quintessential military aristocrat during Nanboku-ch\u014d period, owned many incense woods and named them. Sh\u014dgun Ashikaga Yoshimasa (1436\u20131490) himself appreciated precious scented woods and collected some or inherited them from Sasaki. In order to properly organise the large collection of incense wood, he appointed the experts of that time Sanjonishi Sanetaka, who became the founder of the Oie School, and Shino Soshin, the founder of the Shino School. They established a classifying system called rikkoku gomi, which means \"six countries, five scents\". {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Name ! scope=\"col\" | Character ! scope=\"col\" | rikkoku (country) ! scope=\"col\" | gomi (scent) |- | kyara | \u4f3d\u7f85 | Vietnam | bitter |- | rakoku | \u7f85\u56fd | Thailand | sweet |- | manaka | \u771f\u90a3\u4f3d | Malacca, Malaysia | no scent |- | manaban* | \u771f\u5357\u86ee | unknown | salty |- | sasora | \u4f50\u66fd\u7f85 | India | hot |- | sumotara / sumontara | \u5bf8\u805e\u591a\u7f85 | Sumatra | sour |} * Manaban comes from the word nanban which means \"southern barbarian\", and was brought to Japan by Portuguese traders with unknown origin. ==Incense utensils== K\u014d-awase-dogu-dana cabinet for incense games (Gold lacquer, Edo period, 18th century) A set of incense utensils in a nagabon (\u9577\u76c6) tray. Top left to right: Honk\u014dban (\u672c\u9999\u76e4), takigara-ire (\u70b7\u7a7a\u5165), hid\u014dgu (\u706b\u9053\u5177). Lower left to right: shinoori (\u5fd7\u91ce\u6298), two k\u014dro (\u9999\u7089), giny\u014d-bako (\u9280\u8449\u7bb1) Incense utensils or equipment is called . A range of k\u014dd\u014dgu are available and different styles and motifs are used for different events and in different seasons. All the tools for incense ceremony are handled with exquisite care. They are scrupulously cleaned before and after each use and before storing. Much like the objects and tools used in the tea ceremony, these can be valued as high art. The following are a few of the essential components: * three- tiered container (juk\u014dbako \u91cd\u9999\u7bb1), for the incense, new mica plates, and burned out incense with its used mica plate * long tray (nagabon \u9577\u76c6) * censer (k\u014dr\u014d \u9999\u7089), also known as te-k\u014dro (\u624b\u9999\u7089 \"hand-held censer\") * Mica plates (gin-yo \u9280\u8449), where the incense wood is placed to stop it from burning if it were to be placed directly on the ash * Incense holder board (honk\u014dban \u672c\u9999\u76e4), a small, wooden tablet with a flower-shaped mother-of-pearl fittings upon which the small incense pieces on mica plates are kept on top for display after use, normally 6 or 10 in number * white ash (Trapa. Japonica), but also red ash or other precious ash can be used * Shino incense packet (shinoori \u5fd7\u91ce\u6298), folded paper packet used to keep incense wood chips (themselves in their individual packets), used by the Shino School * box (giny\u014d-bako \u9280\u8449\u7bb1), silver box for containing the mica plates * charcoal (tadon \u70ad\u5718), a special, and nearly odourless, charcoal briquette A small vase (k\u014dji-tate \u9999\u7b6f\u5efa), also known as koji-tate (\u706b\u7bb8\u7acb), keeps the fire utensils (hid\u014dgu \u706b\u9053\u5177): * metal tweezers or tongs (ginyo-basami \u9280\u8449\u633e) for handling the square mica plates * ebony chopsticks (\u9999\u7b6f), for picking up pieces of incense wood * small spatula (\u9999\u5319), for transferring incense wood onto the mica plate * metal chopsticks (koji \u706b\u7bb8), used to move the charcoal * tamper (ha i-oshi \u7070\u62bc), an object shaped rather like a closed folding-fan, used to gently tamp and smooth the ashes in the censer into a cone around the burning charcoal * feather brush (ko-hane \u5c0f\u7fbd), to clean and brush off any ashes * answer sheet holder (\u9daf), for securing the sheet of paper with answers onto the tatami mat Some other items can be included: * small incense container (k\u014dg\u014d \u9999\u5408), for keeping incense in, mainly as part of the tea ceremony, or in general * ash container (takigara-ire \u70b7\u7a7a\u5165), where fresh ash is kept Most of the utensils could be kept in a special cabinet (dogu-dana). Influential families would order elaborate and expensive cabinets made out precious woods and lacquer and goldwork. ==Monk\u014d== ja) The art of enjoying incense, with all its preparatory aspects, is called monk\u014d (\u805e\u9999), which translated means \"listening to incense\" (although the \u805e Kanji also means \"to smell\" in Chinese). The aim is to let the aroma of the material infuse the body and soul and \"listen\" to its essence in a holistic manner, as opposed to just reducing it to smelling. Monk\u014d has been depicted in Japanese art, with a well-known depiction by the artist Shinsui It\u014d (1898\u20131972). Participants sit near one another and take turns smelling incense from a censer as they pass it around the group. Participants comment on and make observations about the incense, and play games to guess the incense material. Genjik\u014d is one such game, in which participants are to determine which of five prepared censers contain different scents, and which contain the same scent. Players' determinations (and the actual answers) are recorded using symbols in k\u014d no zu(\u9999\u306e\u56f3). The k\u014d no zu for Genjik\u014d is Genjik\u014d no zu(\u6e90\u6c0f\u9999\u306e\u56f3). The geometric pattern of these are also used as mon (called as Genjik\u014d-mon(\u6e90\u6c0f\u9999\u7d0b)), for decoration in a number of other areas such as kimono, Japanese lacquerware and Japanese pottery. ==References== == Further reading == * * ==External links== * Category:D\u014d Category:Incense Category:Japanese culture ",
