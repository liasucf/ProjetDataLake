    "text": "Sixty Years a Queen is a 1913 British silent historical film directed by Bert Haldane and starring Blanche Forsythe, Louie Henri and Fred Paul. ==Outline== The film portrays the six decade-long reign of Queen Victoria, serving as a wider depiction of the Victorian era and its leading British figures. It was based on the 1897 non-fiction work of the same title by Sir Herbert Maxwell, 7th Baronet which had been written to celebrate Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.Gabriel A. Sivan, \u201cGeorge Berthold Samuelson (1889\u20131947): Britain\u2019s Jewish film pioneer\u201d in Jewish Historical Studies, vol. 44 (2012) pp. 205\u2013206 ==Production== The film was conceived in 1912 at a meeting between G. B. Samuelson and his brother Julian Wylie. Samuelson was looking for his first film project, and later brought in Will Barker as his co-producer. The picture was largely filmed at Barker\u2019s newly built Ealing Studios, where Barker gained a reputation for extravagant productions, often historical.Oakley p. 58 A great deal of money was invested in Sixty Years a Queen, and more than a thousand actors and extras were employed, on many locations. There was also much advance publicity. The picture was a great success at the box-offices, making the producers a profit of some \u00a335,000. More than twenty years later Herbert Wilcox made a similar film, Sixty Glorious Years, which was also very popular. ==Cast== * Blanche Forsythe as Queen Victoria (younger) * Louie Henri as Queen Victoria (older) * Fred Paul as Archbishop of Canterbury * Roy Travers as Prince Albert * Gilbert Esmond as Duke of Wellington * E.
