His 1946 survey of Neuroptera for The London Naturalist, was reprinted as The Neuroptera of the Home Counties. In it he identified 12 species of Neuroptera in central London. He was a fellow of the Royal Entomological Society and a member of the London Natural History Society (LNHS). ==Early life and family== Edward Pinniger was born in St Pancras, London, on 12 April 1913.Edward Bertram Pinniger England and Wales Death Registration Index 1837\u20132007.

Sunbury on Thames: Cecil and Watts. pp. 39 & 107\\. In 1952 he read a paper on \"Processing and pressing of disk recordings\" in Portsmouth. In 1971 he lectured on \"Processing of gramophone records\"Wireless World, Vol. 77 (1971), p. 496. and in 1977 contributed a chapter on disc manufacture to John Borwick's Sound Recording Practice: A handbook (Oxford University Press, c. 1977) compiled for the Association of Professional Recording Studios.The Gramophone, Vol. 54 (1976), p. 361. ==Entomology== Coenagrion scitulum A keen entomologist, Pinniger was a fellow of the Royal Entomological SocietyProceedings and Transactions of the South London Entomological and Natural History Society, 1959, p. xxi. and a member of the London Natural History Society (LNHS).\"The dragonflies of Essex\", Essex Naturalist (Essex Field Club), No. 9 (1988), p. 103. In 1946, he published a survey of Neuroptera for their journal The London Naturalist which was reprinted as The Neuroptera of the Home Counties. In it he identified 12 species of Neuroptera in central London but by 1981 five had yet to be found in Buckingham Palace garden, a reservoir of insect life in central London.\"Neuroptera from Buckingham Palace Garden, London\" by Michael A. Kirby, Proceedings and transactions of the British Entomological and Natural History Society, Vol. 14 (1981), pp. 14\u201318. A resident of Chingford, on the border of Essex, he led LNHS expeditions in the county. On 21 July 1946, with Cynthia Longfield of the Natural History Museum, he was searching dykes near Benfleet in Essex for Lestes dryas when they were the first to detect Coenagrion scitulum (the dainty damselfly) in Britain. They first captured a male and then two females three quarters of a mile away.\"The dragonflies of Essex\", p. 59.Entomologist's Gazette, Vol. 3, No. 3 (July 1952), p. 161. The species was subsequently determined by Longfield at the Natural History Museum.Museums Journal, Vol. 49 (1950), p. 207. ==Death== Pinniger died in the district of Windsor and Maidenhead, England, on 18 August 2005.Pinniger, Edward Bertram. gov.uk Retrieved 28 July 2019. ==Selected publications== ===Entomology=== * \"Notes on the Dragonflies of Epping Forest\", The London Naturalist, Vol. 12 (1933), pp. 66\u201372. * \"The Epping Forest Survey: Lepidoptera (Butterflies)\", The London Naturalist, Vol. 24 (1944), pp. 62\u201363. * \"The Neuroptera of the Home Counties\", The London Naturalist, Vol. 25 (1946), pp. 24\u201330. * The Neuroptera of the Home Counties.
