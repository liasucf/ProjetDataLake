Janaki as Seth's wife * Pattusami as Sleuth * Azhwar Kuppusami as Prosecutor * Kannan as Judge ==Production== In 1959, S. S. Vasan, the proprietor of Gemini Studios, began working on a film built around capital-labour relations. The film, which was the Tamil remake of the Hindi film Paigham, was untitled, and the creative team of Gemini could not come up with a convincing title. Vasan invited his employees to suggest a title for the under-production film, and he received an abundance of entries; one office boy submitted as many as 2500 entries. After examining one by one, Vasan chose the title Irumbu Thirai, which means \"Iron Curtain\". He also hosted a reception to honour the boy who suggested the title and rewarded him with some prize money. Besides producing, Vasan also directed the film. The female cast of Paigham \u2013 Vyjayanthimala, B. Saroja Devi and Pandari Bai \u2013 returned to star in Irumbu Thirai, while Sivaji Ganesan reprised the role originally played by Dilip Kumar. It was a \"coup of sorts\" for Vasan to cast Ganesan since the latter had earlier been rejected by the former for a role in Chandralekha (1948), an incident which created a permanent rift between them. K. A. Thangavelu, S. V. Ranga Rao and S. V. Subbaiah were cast in supporting roles. Vyjayanthimala's mother Vasundhara Devi played her screen mother as well. The final length of the film was 18396 feet. == Themes == Irumbu Thirai focuses on capital-labour relations, and the conditions of working-class people. ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack was composed by S. V. Venkatraman. The album had Kothamangalam Subbu, Papanasam Sivan and Pattukkottai Kalyanasundaram as the lyricists. The singers consist of T. M. Soundararajan, Thiruchi Loganathan, Sirkazhi Govindarajan, P. Leela, Jikki, (Radha) Jayalakshmi & K. Jamuna Rani. The song \"Nenjil Kudiyirukkum\" is set in the carnatic raga known as Shanmukhapriya, while the classical-themed \"Enna Seidhaalum\" is set in Kharaharapriya. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:100%;\" !
