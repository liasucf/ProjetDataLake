    "text": "Schloss Birkenfeld, now a castle ruin (Matth\u00e4us Merian 17th century) Birkenfeld in Oldenburg times, 1829 The \"new\" (Oldenburg) Schloss Birkenfeld is a town and the district seat of the Birkenfeld district in southwest Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It is also the seat of the like-named Verbandsgemeinde. ==Geography== ===Location=== The town lies in the Nahegebiet (Nahe area), to the north of the namesake river, on the edge of the Naturpark Saar-Hunsr\u00fcck. Birkenfeld lies roughly 13 km southwest of Idar-Oberstein and 12 km northwest of Baumholder. ===Neighbouring municipalities=== Clockwise from the north, these are Gollenberg, Elchweiler, Schmi\u00dfberg, Rimsberg, Dienstweiler, Ellweiler, Dambach, Br\u00fccken, Buhlenberg and Ellenberg. ==History== The name Birkenfeld has its origin in an old German dialect, Old Frankish. It means something rather like \u201cat the field with the birches\u201d (it is directly cognate with the English words \u201cbirch field\u201d). From the name's Frankish roots it can be inferred that today's town arose on a spot where there was quite a noticeable stand of birch trees sometime about the year AD 500, and that it was founded by Frankish-German farmers. To this day, there are a great number of birch trees in the bird conservation area at the clay quarries. The first attestation of the name is spelled Bikenuelt (about 700) or Birkinvelt at the time when it had a documentary mention from Archbishop of Trier Egbert in 981. From this document comes knowledge that Saint Leudwinus (Archbishop of Trier 695-713) had donated to the St. Paulinus' Abbey in Trier the churches at Birkenfeld and Brombach. Archaeological finds from the Iron Age, however, bear witness to quite heavy settlement even in the 8th century BC. In the 1st century BC, Roman legions overran the area, and for 400 years, it lay under Roman rule. This is known mainly from finds made in the town's immediate vicinity. The town that is now Birkenfeld lies right on a Roman road that served as a crosslink between two important military roads, namely the Metz-Mainz road to the south and the Trier-Bingen-Mainz road to the north, which was mentioned by Roman poet Ausonius in his Mosella in AD 350, and which also corresponds along some stretches with the Hunsr\u00fcckh\u00f6henstra\u00dfe (\u201cHunsr\u00fcck Heights Road\u201d, a scenic road across the Hunsr\u00fcck built originally as a military road on Hermann G\u00f6ring\u2019s orders). This crosslink, also known as the Bronzestra\u00dfe (\u201cBronze Road\u201d), linked the Glan, Nohen and the Moselle with each other. The Bronzestra\u00dfe crossed the Nahe in Nohen (villa Aldena) and ran farther on, right through the Wasserschieder Wald, a state forest that still stands today on the town's outskirts, by way of Gollenberg, by B\u00f6rfink and on towards Trier. The Frankish settlement of Birkinvelt was held in the 13th century by the Counts of Sponheim. In 1223, the county was split into the \u201cFront\u201d and \u201cRear\u201d Counties of Sponheim, and Birkenfeld passed to the latter, and was then held by the counts whose seat was at the Starkenburg (castle, now a ruin) near Trarbach. In 1293, Castle Birkenfeld had its first documentary mention. In 1332, Birkenfeld was granted town rights by Emperor Louis the Bavarian. After the last Count of Sponheim died in 1437, the \u201cRear\u201d County was inherited by the Margraves of Baden and the Counts of Veldenz. In 1584, a House of Wittelsbach sideline, in the person of Charles I, Count Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken-Birkenfeld, resided in town. In this same year, expansion work also began on the castle to turn it into a princely residence in the Renaissance style. Exactly 140 years later, the last remnants of the Princely holding of court at Schloss Birkenfeld, as it had come to be known, were swept away. During the Thirty Years' War (1618\u20131648), the town itself became in 1635 a theatre of war. Also that year, the Plague broke out in Birkenfeld and claimed 416 lives. In 1776, under Margrave Karl Friedrich, Birkenfeld became seat of the Badish Oberamt. In this time, Birkenfeld blossomed. The town experienced an economic and cultural upswing. In 1779, for instance, the first \u201cHigher School\u201d was founded. In Napoleon's time, in 1798, the Rhine\u2019s left bank was ceded to France, whereafter Birkenfeld belonged to the Department of Sarre. One night in February 1797, Johannes B\u00fcckler, known as Schinderhannes, burgled a cloth factory owned by the Brothers Stumm, who would later become coal and steel entrepreneurs on the Saar. A large part of the cloth stolen during this break-in Schinderhannes sold to a fence in Hundheim.Peter Bayerlein: Schinderhannes-Ortslexikon, S. 38, Mainz-Kostheim 2003 After the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815), the Principality of Birkenfeld was awarded to the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg in 1817 for the contribution of Peter I, then regent of Oldenburg, to the military effort against Napoleon. Under Oldenburg rule, the new palatial castle, which is now the district administration\u2019s seat, was built in 1821. Not only was this built, but so were further buildings in the Governmental Quarter (Regierungsviertel), such as the infantry barracks (until 1963, a Gymnasium building, now the local office for the regulation of expenditures caused by stationed forces), which to this day characterize the town\u2019s appearance with their Classicist style from Oldenburg times. In the time of the Third Reich, the town became on 1 April 1937 part of the Prussian district of Birkenfeld, which was formed out of the former Oldenburg holdings and the Restkreis (roughly \u201cremnant district\u201d) of the former exclave of Saxe-Coburg from 1814 to 1834, St. Wendel-Baumholder (this designation as a Restkreis had arisen from its being what had been left of the Sankt Wendel district on the Prussian side of the border once the Territory of the Saar Basin had been formed under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles). After the Second World War, Birkenfeld belonged to the French zone of occupation, and since 1946, it has been a district seat in Rhineland- Palatinate. ==Religion== In 2008, 50% of the town's inhabitants were Evangelical and 31% were Catholic.KommWis, Stand: 31. Dezember 2008 Besides these two biggest groups, there are an Evangelical Free Church congregation (Baptists), the Mennonite Brethren Church, a New Apostolic church and the Jehovah's Witnesses. ==Politics== Birkenfeld has been a district seat since 1947 and forms together with 30 other municipalities a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality, called the Verbandsgemeinde of Birkenfeld. ===Town council=== The council is made up of 22 council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 25 May 2014, and the honorary mayor as chairman. The municipal election held on 25 May 2014 yielded the following results:Der Landeswahlleiter Rheinland- Pfalz: Kommunalwahl 2014, Stadt- und Gemeinderatswahlen {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"500\" |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" align=\"center\" | || SPD || CDU || BfB || BFL || FDP || Total |- align=\"center\" | 2014 || 9 || 9 || 1 || 2 || 1 || 22 seats |- align=\"center\" | 2009 || 8 || 8 || 3 || 2 || 1 || 22 seats |- align=\"center\" | 2004 || 8 || 11 || - || 2 || 1 || 22 seats |} BFL is Birkenfelder Freie Liste (\u201cBirkenfeld Free List\u201d). BfB is B\u00fcrger f\u00fcr Birkenfeld (\u201cCitizens for Birkenfeld\u201d). ===Mayors=== Birkenfeld's mayor is Peter Nauert (CDU), and his deputies are Alois Kandels (CDU), Dr. J\u00f6rg Bruch (SPD) and Helmut Lorenz (BFL). Peter Nauert is the first mayor ever to be elected by direct vote by the people of Birkenfeld. Both his predecessors, Manfred Dreier and Erich M\u00f6rsdorf, headed both the town and the Verbandsgemeinde of Birkenfeld at once. Werner K\u00e4ufer was the last professional mayor of the town of Birkenfeld. Indeed, he was acclaimed in the office in 1968 with a great majority for another 12 years, but by 1970, he had to give up his professional office when, under administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, towns with fewer than 7,500 inhabitants were merged into Verbandsgemeinden. The following have served as mayor of Birkenfeld: * Eugen Ruppenthal from 1923 to 1933 and from 1949 to 1953 * Oswald Morenz from 1953 to 1961 * Werner K\u00e4ufer from 1961 to 1970 * Erich M\u00f6rsdorf from 1971 to 1990 * Manfred Dreier from 1990 to 2000, (SPD) * Peter Nauert from 2000 until 2014 (CDU) * Miroslaw Kowalski since 2014, (CDU) ===Coat of arms=== The town's arms might be described thus: Azure on a mount vert a birch tree with roots proper surmounted by an inescutcheon chequy gules and argent. The main charge, the birch tree, is canting for the town's name (\u201cbirch\u201d is Birke in German). The inescutcheon with the red and silver \u201cchequy\u201d pattern is the coat of arms formerly borne by the \u201cHinder\u201d County of Sponheim, thus bearing witness to that time in the town's history. This composition is based on an old court seal from 1577. The arms have been borne since 29 October 1923, when they were approved by the Ministry of the Interior at Oldenburg. ===Town partnerships=== Birkenfeld fosters partnerships with the following places: * Roerdalen, Limburg, Netherlands * Ch\u00e2teau-Salins, Moselle, France ==Culture and sightseeing== ===Lambdacism in the local dialect=== In bygone days, the local Birkenfeld dialect was marked by the peculiarity of often replacing the sounds /d/ and /t/ \u2013 and sometimes /r/ as well \u2013 with /l/, a shift known as lambdacism. For example, a Birkenfelder in those days would have said Fulerlale where Standard High German would have Futterladen (\u201cfodder shop\u201d). A full-sentence example can be seen in a remark made by the Birkenfeld sexton \u201cFuchs Karl\u201d to the church councillor and parish priest Haag: Jo, jo, Herr Kirjerot, pririje kann e jela, awa noch lang net loule!, or in Standard High German, Ja, ja, Herr Kirchenrat, predigen kann ein jeder, aber noch lange nicht l\u00e4uten! (\u201cYes, yes, Mr. Church Councillor, preaching is something anyone can do, but bellringing, not for long\u201d). Lambdacism, though, long ago vanished from the Birkenfeld dialect, having given way to the other shift that is customary in Hunsr\u00fcckisch: rhotacism. ===Museums=== The Landesmuseum des Vereins f\u00fcr Heimatkunde im Landkreis Birkenfeld (\u201cState Museum of the Association for Local History in the Rural District of Birkenfeld\u201d) offers an overview of 2,500 years of cultural history. The centrepiece is the interactively equipped Celtic experience exhibit Kelten, Kunst und Kult erleben (\u201cExperience Celts, Art and Worship\u201d). Here, through reconstructions, archaeological finds and replicas, these people's life is presented. Further exhibits deal with regional and territorial history of the Birkenfelder Land. Historical highlights among these exhibits are the High Middle Ages (13th to 15th centuries) and Oldenburg times in the Principality of Birkenfeld beginning in the early 19th century. Regularly changing exhibits deal with both historical and current themes. ===Buildings=== The following are listed buildings or sites in Rhineland- Palatinate\u2019s Directory of Cultural Monuments:Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district Castle Birkenfeld\u2019s gatehouse The Old School on Kirchplatz The former youth hostel; the building was built on the castle grounds on foundations that formerly supported a rectory * Castle Birkenfeld, Burgstra\u00dfe 17, 19, 28, 30, 32 (monumental zone) \u2013 preserved from the actual mediaeval castle a round tower stump; from the Renaissance complex the gatehouse (no. 17); former Gasthaus zum ledigen Waidsack (inn, no. 28); youth hostel, 1926, architect Wilhelm Heilig, Darmstadt (no. 19) * Evangelical parish church, Am Kirchplatz 4/6 \u2013 Baroque aisleless church, five-sided quire, 1750-1756, architects Jonas Erikson Sundahl and Johann Seiz; Romanesque Revival west tower, 1895/1896, architect Heinrich Jester, Speyer; bells from 1554, 1717, 1961; d\u00e9cor * Saint James\u2019s Catholic Parish Church (Pfarrkirche St. Jacobus), Maiwiese 8 \u2013 Gothic Revival hall church, yellow sandstone, 1888-1890, architect Reinhold Wirtz, Trier; tomb slab 1752; d\u00e9cor * Am Kirchplatz 2 \u2013 dwelling and commercial house, partly timber-frame, marked 1808, essentially older * Am Kirchplatz 5 \u2013 Evangelical and Catholic public school; nine-axis Baroque Revival building with mansard roof, 1911; characterizes square\u2019s appearance * Am Kirchplatz 11 \u2013 dwelling and (former) commercial house; Renaissance Revival, 1881, characterizes square\u2019s appearance * Am Rech 2 \u2013 so-called Backhaus (\u201cBakehouse\u201d); small house, partly timber- frame, partly slated, 18th or early 19th century * An der Oelm\u00fchle 4 \u2013 former mill; quarrystone building, 1580; oilmill beginning in the 1770s, expansion and higher roof 1922; technical equipment * Auf dem R\u00f6mer 5 \u2013 building with half-hipped roof, partly timber-frame (with wooden shingles), marked 1723 * Auf dem R\u00f6mer 6 \u2013 Baroque house, 18th century, essentially possibly older (1665?); characterizes street's and town's appearance * Auf dem R\u00f6mer 9 \u2013 so- called Ku\u00dflersches Haus; corner house, marked 1590, partly with alterations from the 19th century; characterizes town's appearance * Bahnhofstra\u00dfe 2 \u2013 Late Historicist house, hewn-stone plastered surfaces, bare timber framing, late 19th century * Bahnhofstra\u00dfe 4 \u2013 corner house, partly timber-frame (slated), wooden gallery, late 18th or early 19th century; characterizes street's appearance * Br\u00fcckener Stra\u00dfe 8 \u2013 house with saddle hipped roof, gabled dormer, 1920s/1930s * Friedrich-August-Stra\u00dfe 15 \u2013 Maler-Hugo-Zang- Haus; Neoclassical house, 1883 (see below) * Friedrich-August-Stra\u00dfe 17 \u2013 museum; in the forms of a Roman country house, 1910, architect Julius Groeschel, Munich * Across from Gollenberger Weg 3 \u2013 cast-iron fountain, late 19th century * Hauptstra\u00dfe 9 \u2013 so-called Stadthaus (\u201cTown House\u201d); lavish Historicist corner building on a terrace, about 1900 * Before Hauptstra\u00dfe 11 \u2013 so-called Apothekerbrunnen (\u201cApothecary\u2019s Fountain\u201d); great cast-iron Gothic Revival complex, last fourth of the 19th century * K\u00f6nigsgasse 11 \u2013 dwarf house with barn under one roof, stable built on later and roof made higher * Pfarrgasse 1 \u2013 Evangelical rectory; solid bungalow, biaxial dormer, 1733 * Between Rennweg 27 and 29 \u2013 warriors\u2019 memorial for students from the Gymnasium Betuletia who fell in the First World War; cube upon a pedestal, steel-helmet relief, 1927, design by Wilhelm Heilig, Darmstadt * Across from Rennweg 30 \u2013 so-called Steinernes Kreuz (\u201cStone Cross\u201d); Bildstock, tuff, 16th century, possibly Pre-Reformation * Saarstra\u00dfe 19 \u2013 stately Quereinhaus (a combination residential and commercial house divided for these two purposes down the middle, perpendicularly to the street), latter half of the 19th century * Schadtengasse 2 \u2013 house with three-part window ensemble, marked 1838 * Schlossallee 3 \u2013 five-axis wood-shingled house, 19th century; at the south gable parts of a nursery's sunken conservatory * Schlossallee 11 and 13 \u2013 Neues Schloss; Classicist group around open cour d'honneur, 1819\u20131821, architect J.

The house, built in 1883 in the bourgeois Classicist style, is where the painter Hugo Zang (1858\u20131946) once lived. In 2006, restoration work began in an effort to bring the house up to a standard worthy of monumental protection. Since 2008, the building has housed not only the Birkenfeld district folk high school but also seven gallery rooms for changing exhibitions of works by local and national artists. ==Economy and infrastructure== ===Economy=== The town's economy is characterized mainly by small and midsize businesses. Owing to Birkenfeld's history as a noble residence town and an administrative seat, no great industrial development ever took place here. The biggest employers, besides the administrative bodies, are thus a foundation and the Bundeswehr. The German Red Cross\u2019s (DRK) Elisabeth-Stiftung, a medical rehabilitation foundation, with its hospital, Berufsf\u00f6rderungswerk Birkenfeld (an institute for retraining workers whose condition precludes their return to former occupations), private vocational schools, measures for youth and senior citizens\u2019 home is with more than 600 employees the town's biggest employer. Following the Elisabeth-Stiftung is the Bundeswehr (among other units, the 2nd Luftwaffe Division) with more than 500 military and civilian personnel. The Stefan-Morsch-Stiftung, a foundation for keeping data on potential bone marrow and stem cell donors, has its seat in Birkenfeld. On the lands of the former railway station, a centre for starting up businesses (\u201cBIG-Center\u201d) was built in the 1990s. ===Transport=== ====Road==== Birkenfeld has good road links to Bundesstra\u00dfen 41 (east-west, between Mainz and Saarbr\u00fccken) and 269 (between Bernkastel-Kues and Saarlouis), as well as to Autobahn A 62, which is the most important north\u2013south link, running between Trier and Kaiserslautern. Furthermore, Bundesstra\u00dfe 269 links to the Hunsr\u00fcckh\u00f6henstra\u00dfe, and thereby to Frankfurt- Hahn Airport, which lies 50 km away by road. This journey is covered five times each day by a bus service. ====Rail==== Birkenfeld's rail link is 5 km away in nearby Neubr\u00fccke, which has a station on the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen\u2013Saarbr\u00fccken). Saarbr\u00fccken can be reached by train in 45 minutes, and Frankfurt in less than two hours. The former spur line leading to Birkenfeld has been abandoned, and is now a cycle path. ====Hiking trails==== Running outwards from Birkenfeld are five local loop trails for hiking with a total length through the region of more than 60 km. These are the Glockenweg (roughly 16 km), the Eulenweg (roughly 9 km), the Mausweg (roughly 12.5 km), the M\u00fchlenweg (roughly 12.5 km) and the Rehweg (roughly 12.5 km). The long- distance Nahe-H\u00f6henweg and the Sironaweg, which leads by many Celtic-Roman archaeological finds, likewise run by Birkenfeld. ====Cycle paths==== The roughly 120 km-long Nahe-Radweg and the Rheinland-Pfalz-Route run right through the middle of town. They are supplemented by three local cycling circuits, R1, R2 and R3, with a total length of just under 80 km. ===Public institutions=== ====Education==== Since 1996, a vocational school has been established on the grounds of a former US military hospital in the neighbouring municipality of Hoppst\u00e4dten-Weiersbach. The Environmental Campus Birkenfeld (Umwelt-Campus Birkenfeld) has, as a branch of the Trier University of Applied Sciences, made a significant contribution to the Birkenfeld region's economic development. For school-age children there is a broad array of offerings. * Primary school * Realschule plus * Gymnasium Birkenfeld * F\u00f6rderschule Schwerpunkt Lernen (special school with focus on learning) Enjoying more than local importance is the Elisabeth-Stiftung medical rehabilitation foundation, with its specific offers of qualifications to people with either physical or mental handicaps. Alumni come from all over Germany and even from neighbouring countries. Among other academic offerings is the Volkshochschule Birkenfeld, a folk high school. ====Authorities==== Birkenfeld is the location of a number of authorities: * District administration * Verbandsgemeinde administration * Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit (Federal employment agency) * Land surveying office * Police department * Forester's office ===Sport and leisure=== Birkenfeld has, among other sport and leisure facilities, a heated outdoor swimming pool, the Stadion am Berg (\u201cStadium at the Mountain\u201d), several sport halls, a zoo, two libraries, a vocational library and the youth centre. In 2000, a skatepark was built at the youth centre, which in 2005 was expanded with a funbox, a quarter pipe, a ramp and an obstacle. ==Notable residents== ===Sons and daughters of the town=== The Trauernde at the Birkenfeld graveyard.
