Although a graduate of Architecture from the Royal Pontifical University of Santo Tomas in 2000, he is known for oil and watercolor paintings of traditional Roman Catholic imagery inspired by his alma mater. He has been embellishing three-dimensional church artworks with his kind of realism, including one given to a chapel in the Czech Republic by the Philippine Charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires in 2017. Manalang is multi-awarded, receiving prizes from, among others, the Vermont Studio Center, Metrobank, and the Art Association of the Philippines. Apart from variously exhibiting in Metro Manila, he has also exhibited in New York City and at the Vermont Studio Center in Johnson, Vermont. Some of Manalang's works have been auctioned on Artnet and MutualArt, and have been represented by galleries in the Philippines including Altro Mondo. In 2019, he was chosen to be a part of diskurso.com's Apropiaci\u00f3n show. ==References== Category:Artists from Bulacan Category:Filipino artists Category:Filipino painters Category:People from Manila Category:Philippine art Category:University of Santo Tomas alumni Category:Living people Category:1980 births ",
