    "text": "Elections to Cheshire East Council took place on Thursday 2 May 2019 in all 52 wards, with each ward returning between one and three councillors to the council. The Conservative party lost overall control of the council, losing 17 seats; the Labour party gained 9 seats, independents gained 6 and the Liberal Democrats gained 2. The elections were held against a background of a number of controversies, with the council facing eight criminal investigations. Multiple Conservative Cabinet members lost their seats, with Ainsley Arnold (Planning) losing out to Independents in Macclesfield Tytherington and Paul Bates (Finance) falling to fifth place in Congleton East, whilst then-Leader of the Council Rachel Bailey came within 78 votes of losing her seat to the Liberal Democrats. The biggest shocks came in Broken Cross and Upton, with Labour's Rob Vernon and James Barber becoming the first ever Labour councillors for the area and unseating the Mayor-elect, Liz Durham, and Sandbach Ettiley Heath and Wheelock, where Laura Crane achieved a huge swing to win the seat for Labour against Conservative councillor Gail Wait. No party or grouping held a majority of the council seats, and so after a few weeks of negotiation, Labour and the Independents agreed to form a joint-Cabinet that would run the council for the following year, with a focus on changing the system of governance to abolish the Cabinet and replace it with the old committee system. ==Results by Ward== ===Alderley Edge=== ===Alsager=== ===Audlem=== ===Bollington=== ===Brereton Rural=== ===Broken Cross and Upton=== ===Bunbury=== ===Chelford=== ===Congleton East=== ===Congleton West=== ===Crewe Central=== ===Crewe East=== ===Crewe North=== ===Crewe South=== ===Crewe St. Barnabas=== ===Crewe West=== ===Dane Valley=== ===Disley=== ===Gawsworth=== ===Handforth=== ===Haslington=== ===High Legh=== ===Knutsford=== ===Leighton=== ===Macclesfield Central=== ===Macclesfield East=== ===Macclesfield Hurdsfield=== ===Macclesfield South=== ===Macclesfield Tytherington=== ===Macclesfield West and Ivy=== ===Middlewich=== ===Mobberley=== This ward's single seat was uncontested. ===Nantwich North and West=== ===Nantwich South and Stapeley=== ===Odd Rode=== ===Poynton East and Pott Shrigley=== ===Poynton West and Adlington=== ===Prestbury=== ===Sandbach Elworth=== ===Sandbach Ettiley Heath and Wheelock=== ===Sandbach Heath and East=== ===Sandbach Town=== ===Shavington=== ===Sutton=== ===Willaston and Rope=== ===Wilmslow Dean Row=== ===Wilmslow East=== ===Wilmslow Lacey Green=== ===Wilmslow West and Chorley=== ===Wistaston=== ===Wrenbury=== ===Wybunbury=== ==Notes== * Italics denote a sitting councillor for the same ward. : 1.
