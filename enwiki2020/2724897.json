During the Third Italian War of Independence, Riva del Garda was an important supply base for the Austrian navy and was the only town on the lake captured by Italian forces. In 1918, after the end of World War I, Riva del Garda, with the rest of the Trentino, became part of the Kingdom of Italy. Riva was the terminus for the long Mori\u2013Arco\u2013Riva railway line, opened in 1891. However, the railway line closed in 1936 and the railway terminus has been converted into a restaurant. == Geography == Riva del Garda is located at the north-western corner of Lake Garda, approximately above sea level. The town is located at the southern edge of the Italian Alps near the Dolomites. It is bordered by Monte Rocchetta to the west and Monte Brione, above sea level, to the east. East of Riva del Garda is the village Torbole, bordered by Monte Baldo. === Climate === Winters are chilly and quite sunny; snow isn't rare, although since the late 1980s, Riva has seen a sharp decrease of yearly amounts (like the rest of northern Italy) due to the warming trends of the winter in the past 30 years. Summers are warm but rarely hot and/or muggy, mainly thanks to the local lake breezes through the day and some scattered thunderstorms in the late afternoon. January averages are \u20131 to 6 \u00b0C (30 to 42 \u00b0F), while July 17 to 28 \u00b0C (63 to 83 \u00b0F).

The Museo Civico is located in the Rocca, a medieval fortress with quadrangular bastions, placed on the lake, bounded by a canal with drawbridge. It was the fortress of the noble family Scaligeri (1124), who became the Lords of Verona. It was rebuilt several times and it was used by the Austrians as barracks in the 18th century. It is frequently the seat of cultural activities, especially during the summer months. The medieval Torre Apponale was is a medieval tower first mentioned in 1273, but probably older.

The Porta San Michele has a small battlemented belfry for the parochial church of Maria Assunta. This church was originally a romanesque-gothic building from the 14th century (attested by a medieval relief at its southern side), but was rebuilt in baroque style in 1728. It has a single nave and nine baroque altars. The altarpieces were made by local artists, such as Ignazio Martino Oliari da Riva, Giuseppe Craffonara da Riva and Giovanni Caliari da Verona. The fresco in the dome is by the 17th century Baroque painter Giuseppe Alberti. The church Chiesa dell'Inviolata, dominating the Largo Marconi, is considered among the most beautiful baroque churches in Trentino. It is an octagonal building with the belfry next to it.
