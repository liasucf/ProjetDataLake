Ruhrpolen (, \u201cRuhr Poles\u201d) is a German umbrella term for the West Slavic peoples (including Masurians,http://www.oberschlesisches- landesmuseum.de/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=193:tagung- qspuren-der-oberschlesier-und-polen-in-nordrhein- westfalenq&catid;=76:aktuelleshttp://www.migrationsroute.nrw.de/erinnerungsort.php?erinnerungsort=Bochumhttp://www.ghs- mh.de/migration/projects/timeline/tl_ge_2.htm Kashubians,\"Nationales Denken im Katholizismus der Weimarer Republik\", Reinhard Richter, Berlin-Hamburg- M\u00fcnster, 2000, page 319 Silesians, and other Poles) who migrated to the rapidly industrializing areas of the Ruhr. ==Origins== The immigrants mainly came from what were then eastern territories of Germany (Province of Posen, East Prussia and West Prussia, Province of Silesia), which were partially acquired in the Polish partitions and which housed a significant Polish population. This migration wave, known as the Ostflucht, began in the late 19th century, with most of the Ruhrpolen arriving around the 1870s. The migrants found employment in the mining, steel and construction industries. In 1913 there were between 300,000 and 350,000 Poles and 150,000 Masurians. Of those, one-third were born in the Ruhr area.The German melting-pot: multiculturality in historical perspective, Wolfgang Zank, page 139, Palgrave Macmillan 1998 The Protestant Masurians did not accept being identified with Catholic Poles and underlined their loyalty to Prussia and the German Empire.Stefan Goch, Polen nicht deutscher Fu\u00dfballmeister.

A decree was issued that ordered all miners to speak German. Discrimination started to affect issues of basic existence.Imperial Germany... pages 107-108 The Settlement Law of 1904 made it difficult for Poles who wished to return east to purchase land. In 1908, laws discriminating against the Polish language were applied to the entire German Empire.Imperial Germany... pages 107-108 In response to harassment by Prussian authorities, the organisations of Ruhr Poles expanded what had been their purely cultural character and restored their links with Polish organisations in the east. The League of Poles in Germany, founded at Bochum in 1894, merged with the Stra\u017c Movement set up in 1905. In 1913, the combined group formed an executive committee, which worked alongside the Polish National Council.Imperial Germany... page 218 Poles also demanded Polish priests and mass services in Polish.Imperial Germany... page 108 After the outbreak of the Second World War, all remaining Polish organizations in the Ruhr faced dissolution by the Nazis. On 11 September 1939, 249 leading Polish activists from the Ruhr were placed in concentration camps. At least 60 Ruhr Poles were murdered for their activities by Nazi Germany.Weimar and Nazi Germany:Panikos Panayi, Longman 2000, page 235 ==Aftermath== It is estimated that in modern times, some 150,000 inhabitants of the Ruhr Area (out of roughly five million) are of Polish descent. ==Notable people== *Erich Kempka, Adolf Hitler\u2019s chauffeur.Kempka, Erich (2010) [1951].
