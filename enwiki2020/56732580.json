Ahead of the 2008 general election, the Election Commission redrew constituency boundaries to reflect population changes revealed by the 2001 Bangladesh census. The 2008 redistricting added a fifth seat to Gazipur District and altered the boundaries of Gazipur-4. == Members of Parliament == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member!!Party |- |style=\"background-color:\" | | 1986 | Mohammad Shahidullah | Jatiya Party |- |style=\"background-color:\" | | 1988 | Mohammad Obaid Ullah | Bangladesh Nationalist Party |- |style=\"background- color:\" | | 1991 | ASM Hannan Shah | Bangladesh Nationalist Party |- |style=\"background-color:\" | | 1996 | Afsaruddin Ahmad | Awami League |- |style=\"background-color:\" | | 2001 | Tanjim Ahmad Sohel Taj | Awami League |- |style=\"background-color:\" | | 2012 by-election | Simeen Hussain Rimi | Awami League |- |} == Elections == === Elections in the 2010s === Tanjim Ahmad Sohel Taj submitted a letter of resignation from parliament on 23 April 2012.
