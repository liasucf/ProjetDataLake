    "text": "\"Ooo Baby Baby\" is a song written by Smokey Robinson and Pete Moore. It is a classic 1965 hit single by The Miracles for the Tamla (Motown) label. The song has inspired numerous other cover versions by other artists over the years, including covers by Ella Fitzgerald, Todd Rundgren, The Escorts, The Five Stairsteps, Linda Ronstadt , and many others. The Miracles' original version of \"Ooo Baby Baby\", is listed as number 266 on Rolling Stone Magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". ==The Miracles original version== ===Background=== Written by Robinson and fellow Miracle Pete Moore and produced by Robinson, \"Ooo Baby Baby\" was a number 4 hit on the Billboard R&B; singles chart and reached number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. A slow, remorseful number, \"Ooo Baby Baby\" features Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson lamenting the fact that he cheated on his woman, and begging for her to overlook his mistakes and please forgive him. The song's highly emotional feel is supported by the Miracles' tight background vocal harmonies, arranged by Miracles member and song co-author Pete Moore, and a lush orchestral string arrangement that accents The Funk Brothers band's instrumental track. In 2004, Rolling Stone ranked the Miracles' original version of this song as #266 on their list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song is one of the Miracles' most-covered tunes. On the 2006 Motown DVD The Miracles' Definitive Performances, Pete comments on the song's creation: \"In the songs that Smokey and I wrote together, Smokey and Berry kinda left the background vocals to me. And this song \"I'm On The Outside (Looking In)\", which was one of The Imperials' bigger hits.... When I heard that song, as far as the background (harmonies) were concerned and how (they were structured), I wanted to get the same kind of feeling with Smokey's vocal. So I called Bobby, Ronnie, and Claudette over, and we did the backgrounds for it. I kinda had that particular song in mind...so I wanted to get the same kind of feeling with 'Ooo Baby Baby'.\" ===Influence=== John Lennon was a huge fan of Smokey Robinson; he borrowed the \"I'm Crying\" part in this song for The Beatles' song \"I Am the Walrus\". ===Chart performance=== ====Weekly charts==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1965) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |US Billboard Hot 100 Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990 - | style=\"text-align:center;\"|16 |- |US Billboard R&B; | style=\"text- align:center;\"|4 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 |align=\"center\"|18 |} ====Year-end charts==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1965) ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Rank |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|93 |- |} ==Personnel== ===The Miracles=== *William \"Smokey\" Robinson \u2013 writer, producer, lead vocals *Pete Moore \u2013 writer, vocal arrangements, background vocals *Claudette Rogers Robinson \u2013 background vocals *Ronnie White \u2013 background vocals *Bobby Rogers \u2013 background vocals *Marv Tarplin \u2013 guitar ===Other credits=== * Detroit Symphony Orchestra \u2013 strings * The Funk Brothers \u2013 other instruments, featuring Jack Ashford on vibraphone ==Linda Ronstadt version== ===Background=== In 1978, Linda Ronstadt recorded a cover version of \"Ooh Baby Baby\" and included it on her double-platinum album Living in the USA.
