    "text": "Pascal Cygan (born 29 April 1974) is a French retired footballer. His favoured position was central defender, but he could also play as a left back. After starting out at Lille in his country, he would play four years in the Premier League with Arsenal and three in La Liga with Villarreal, in a 17-year professional career. ==Club career== ===Lille=== Born in Lens, Pas-de-Calais, Cygan started his senior career in the ranks of lowly ES Wasquehal before going professional with Lille OSC in 1995, making his Division 1 debut that year but also going on to also spend three seasons in Division 2. In 1999\u20132000 he was an instrumental defensive element for the champions and, in the subsequent top-flight campaign, helped them achieve a third-place finish, with qualification to the UEFA Champions League. In this time, Cygan was also promoted to captaincy, seen as a role model to help develop the younger players. He was also winner of the Etoile d'Or in his last year in France. ===Arsenal=== Cygan joined Arsenal in July 2002 for \u00a32 million, making his debut in a 1\u20131 draw with Chelsea on 1 September after coming on as a late substitute for Nwankwo Kanu. While he featured notably in some of the team's more important fixtures, he was mostly considered only a fringe player; he missed the 2003 FA Cup Final through injury, but did pick up a Premier League winners' medal in 2004 after contributing with 18 appearances. Cygan scored three goals for Arsenal in league action, including an unlikely brace in his first game of 2005\u201306 against Fulham (4\u20131 home win). Until then he had only netted once, against Everton in March 2003. Also that season, following injuries to both Ashley Cole and Ga\u00ebl Clichy, Cygan was drafted in as an emergency left back, and was even named in the Opta team of the week on 9 January 2006. Overall, his side won 12 of the 20 matches he played in and kept 11 clean sheets in the process. He suffered a hamstring injury in January against Middlesbrough and was unable to play again that season as he was fourth choice behind Sol Campbell, Philippe Senderos and Kolo Tour\u00e9, with young Johan Djourou also competing for a place. Cygan played 98 competitive games during his spell at Highbury, including 20 in the Champions League. ===Spain=== In August 2006, Cygan completed a transfer to Villarreal CF for a \u00a32 million transfer fee, joining former Arsenal teammate and compatriot Robert Pires at the club. On 6 June 2008, after having been fairly used in his first two years, mainly due to consecutive serious injuries to Gonzalo Rodr\u00edguez, he signed a new one-year deal. However, following a lack of first-team opportunities in 2008\u201309, and with Villarreal unwilling to extend his contract for a further campaign, he left in July 2009; his La Liga goals came on 5 November 2006 against Real Betis (3\u20132 home win), and against Levante UD on 31 October 2007 (3\u20130, also at El Madrigal). On 10 August 2009, Cygan joined FC Cartagena, recently promoted to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, on a one-year deal. Aged 37, he was released by the Murcians and retired from professional football. ==Honours== Lille *Ligue 2: 1999\u20132000 Arsenal *Premier League: 2003\u201304 *FA Community Shield: 2002, 2004 Individual *Etoile d'Or: 2001\u201302 ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:People from Lens, Pas-de-Calais Category:Sportspeople from Pas-de- Calais Category:French footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Ligue 1 players Category:Ligue 2 players Category:Lille OSC players Category:Premier League players Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Villarreal CF players Category:FC Cartagena footballers Category:French expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:French expatriate sportspeople in England Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Spain ",
