Mediation was a process of understanding between the parties of the government and the bourgeois opposition with a view to neutralizing the revolutionary action of the people of Cuba. On July 1, 1933, the official conversations began between the government of Gerardo Machado and the opposition groups that supported the Mediation. Two daily sessions were held at the headquarters of the United States embassy in Cuba. The government delegation was made up of General Alberto Herrera Franchi, Secretary of War and Navy; Octavio Averhoff, secretary of the Treasury and Mario Ruiz Mesa, of Public Instruction and Fine Arts. And the opposition was represented by Colonel Cosme de la Torriente, from the Nationalist Union; Joaqu\u00edn Mart\u00ednez S\u00e1enz, for ABC; Nicasio Silveira, for the Revolutionary Radical Cellular Organization; and Manuel Dorta Duque, led the delegation of the University of Havana; along with Gustavo Arag\u00f3n and D\u00edaz Balart. == Life in politics == He was the Secretary of the Treasury of Cuba from October 1936 to December 1936. In 1939 he was elected to the Constitutional Assembly by the Republican Action Party. During the 1940 Constitutional Assembly, Dorta-Duque contributed his legal and agrarian knowledge in the discussions and preparation of the Constitution, and was a Constitutional Signatory. In 1944 he was elected Representative to the Chamber in Havana by the Republican Action Party. In the House of Representatives he was president of the Finance Commission.

Dorta-Duque was known for his \"Moral Integrity.\" When the Party of the Cuban People (Orthodox) was created in 1948, Dorta-Duque entered its ranks. And in 1948, the Liberal-Democratic candidate for President , Ricardo Nunez Portuondo - a member of the political opposition to Dorta- Duque's Orthodox party, included Dorta-Duque's words in his political advertisements - mentioning Dorta-Duque as a paragon of integrity. He was reelected to the House of Representatives in 1950. During this second legislative period, in 1951, he proposed the Moral Rehabilitation Law of Miguel Mariano G\u00f3mez Arias, thus annulling the sentence that dismissed him as President of the Republic. Although G\u00f3mez Arias died months before the approval of this law, his dignity was restored to the Cuban people. Perhaps the most important political influence of Dorta-Duque was in 1947, when he authored the Cuban Code on Agrarian Reform in the Congress of the Republic of Cuba. This law was so important, that it was brought back into the Free Agrarian debate some 50 years later. In 1997, when faced with food shortages and hunger, the country returned to the principles set forth in his Cuban Code: \"the land for those who work it\" and the \"property for the peasant and free market for the product of the land\" After the coup d'\u00e9tat of General Fulgencio Batista Zald\u00edvar in 1959, Dorta-Duque ceased to serve as Representative. However, he remained active against the new government, fighting from his private law firm and before the Emergency Courts. == References == Category:Finance ministers of Cuba Category:Members of the Cuban House of Representatives Category:Cuban politicians Category:1896 births Category:1964 deaths ",
