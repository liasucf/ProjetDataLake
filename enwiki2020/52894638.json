    "text": "Clock is a mobile app included with iPhone since iPhone OS 1, and with iPad since iOS 6. == Features == The app has world clock, alarms, stopwatch, and timer tabs. In iOS 10, a Bedtime tab was added. === World Clock === The World Clock section allows the user to access the temperature, time, and pressure of major cities of their choice. The user can add new cities by tapping a plus icon at the top of the screen and typing in the name of the city the user wants to add. The user can also remove cities by swiping left and clicking the delete button. === Alarms === The alarms section allows the user to view all of their alarms on in a week view, create new alarms, and turn off and on existing alarms. === Stopwatch === The stopwatch section allows the user the ability to time events and see how long they take. The app also allows the user to pause, reset, or use the stopwatch's lap feature. === Timer === The timer section allows the user to set a timer to count down to a specific time. When the timer reaches zero, an alarm will be sounded. === Bedtime === In iOS 10 and later versions, there is a Bedtime feature which allows the user to get better sleep. This is done by determining when the user would like to wake up, how many days the alarm should go off, how many hours of sleep the user would like, and whether the user would want a bedtime notification. This feature also integrates with the Health application to track sleep data. This feature was removed (from iPads) in iPadOS 14. === Other features === Since iOS 7, the app icon shows the user the current time. Since iOS 10, the interface sports a dark theme and a new stopwatch face accessed by swiping to the left. == References == Category:IOS Category:IOS software ",
