The city of Montsoreau relied on a local network of antique dealers to define the periodicity (once a month, the second Sunday), and the identity of the event. The market organization relies still today on the antique dealers and elected of the village, one of its characteristics is to summon the second-hand dealers and antique dealers at 5.30 am the morning of the event, and to draw lots available locations on the vieux port docks. == France-Europe Antiques Quality Label == The Montsoreau flea market has received in 2006 the France-Europe Antiques Quality Label, and is one of the 52 events labeled in Europe.

In 2011, attendance stabilizes between 6,000 and 10,000 visitors per event, to today regularly exceed 10,000 visitors. == Le plus des puces == Twenty arts and crafts professionals gathered to offer their services during the Montsoreau flea market.
