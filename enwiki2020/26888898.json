He sacrificed his own life for the sake of the planet in 2012. He is voiced by actor Nolan North. ==== Alta\u00efr Ibn-La\u02bcAhad ==== Alta\u00efr Ibn-La\u02bcAhad (1165\u20131257) was a Syrian-born member of the Levantine Brotherhood of Assassins who served as their Mentor from 1191 until his death in 1257. During his tenure as Mentor and its brief interregnum, Alta\u00efr made several discoveries and inventions that greatly helped the Order's progression. Under his leadership the Levantine Assassins' spread their influence across the Old World, setting up many Guilds in cities like Constantinople. With the Apple in hand, Alta\u00efr changed the way members of his Order lived their lives, writing the details in his fabled Codex for later generations of the Order to read. Throughout his travels, Alta\u00efr strengthened his Order, stopping various Templar plots over the years as well as halting the inexorable march of Genghis Khan. In 1257 Alta\u00efr died sitting quietly in his chair in his secret library in Masyaf, later to be found by Ezio Auditore da Firenze in Assassin's Creed: Revelations. Alta\u00efr is an ancestor to Desmond Miles, through the maternal line. He is voiced by Philip Shahbaz in Assassin's Creed and by Cas Anvar in Assassin's Creed Revelations. ==== Dr. Warren Vidic ==== Dr. Warren Vidic (voiced by Philip Proctor) (died 2012) was the head of the Abstergo's Animus project and a member of the inner sanctum of the Templar Order. In Assassin's Creed: Bloodstone, he was introduced to Abstergo Industries by William King Harvey, a CIA director and double agent for the Templar Order. He inherited the Bluebird project by colonel Boris Pash which is the precursor of the Animus project. As the head of research for Abstergo, Vidic was put in charge of the genetic memory research and the Animus project. As the one responsible for finding new subjects for the Animus, Warren would have them explore their genetic memories, which he would then analyse to gain information on both the Assassins and the Pieces of Eden. As a high-ranking employee of Abstergo Industries, Warren was one of the few members of the Inner Sanctum, a group of Templars with full awareness of the Orders' plans for their New World. He played an important role in those plans, being tasked with finding a Piece of Eden to power Eye-Abstergo, a satellite which uses the Piece of Eden's power to control humanity. He was killed by Desmond Miles in Assassin's Creed III. In Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, an e-mail sent by Abstergo Entertainment COO Olivier Garneau reveals that Vidic has volunteered as Subject 2 for his Animus Project, where he relived the life of an ancestor in 18th century Hungary and of one of Joan of Arc's executioners in 1431. ==== Lucy Stillman ==== Lucy Stillman (voiced by and modelled on Kristen Bell) (1988\u20132012) was a member of the Assassin Order and a genetic memory researcher for Abstergo Industries' Animus Project. During her infiltration of Abstergo, she reported information on the company's recent activities to the Assassins. However, Lucy's lengthy separation from the Assassin Order and her distrust for William Miles led to her secret defection to the Templar cause prior to 2011. When Desmond Miles was brought into Abstergo for testing, Warren Vidic instructed Lucy to earn Desmond's trust, so that the Templars could ultimately find the Piece of Eden located within his memories, and use it for their Eye-Abstergo satellite. As Desmond's condition began to worsen, however, Warren and Lucy turned to more drastic measures, and formulated Project Siren. Lucy was ordered to take Desmond somewhere he would feel safe, and the two Templars orchestrated Desmond's and her escape from Abstergo. Lucy carried out her orders, and relocated Desmond to a hideout to join his fellow Assassins Shaun Hastings and Rebecca Crane. After a month, and another relocation to the ruined Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni, the Assassin team discovered the location of an Apple of Eden, which was inside the Colosseum Vault. When Desmond's hand made contact with the Apple, his body was possessed by Juno, a member of the First Civilization. With her knowledge of Lucy's true allegiance, Juno forced Desmond to stab and kill Lucy with his Hidden Blade. ==== Abbas Sofian ==== Abbas Sofian (voiced by Nolan North in Assassin's Creed and by Yerman Gur in Assassin's Creed: Revelations) (1166\u20131247) was a Syrian Assassin during the Middle Ages, and the Mentor of the Levantine Assassins from 1227 until his death. His leadership over the Levantine Brotherhood showed a period of corruption and disregard for the Order's Creed, resulting in the decline of their castle in Masyaf and its villagers fearing and secretly loathing the Assassins. Raised as an Assassin from birth alongside Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad, the two became best friends during their childhood. However, after Alta\u00efr revealed to Abbas that his father, Ahmad Sofian, had killed himself instead of leaving the Order as Abbas had believed, he labelled Alta\u00efr a liar, and developed an intense hatred for him that would span a lifetime. After Alta\u00efr killed their former Mentor, Rashid ad-Din Sinan (Al Mualim), Abbas stood against Alta\u00efr, who desired to become the Order's new leader. However, he eventually repented, and kept a low profile during Alta\u00efr's time as Mentor. When Alta\u00efr and his family left for Mongolia to deal with the threat presented by Genghis Khan, Abbas staged a secret coup d'\u00e9tat against the Order, killing Alta\u00efr's younger son, Sef Ibn-La'Ahad, and framing Alta\u00efr's best friend and right-hand man, Malik Al-Sayf, who was thrown into prison. With Sef and Malik out of the way, Abbas held the most power over the Order and so he implemented a council into the Brotherhood, with himself as its head. Eventually, he also disbanded the council, usurping the title of Mentor and becoming the sole leader of the Levantine Assassins. Under Abbas' leadership, the Order declined and became corrupted. Additionally, Abbas spent the majority of his time hiding in Masyaf's fortress, fearing for his life. Eventually, after Alta\u00efr returned from his exile, the Assassins joined him once again, and Abbas was killed by one of Alta\u00efr's newest weapons. ==== Abu'l Nuqoud ==== Abu'l Nuqoud (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) was Damascus' Saracen merchant king. Invited many citizens living in Damascus to a grand party, where attendants received goblets they used to get wine from a wine fountain he set up in the partying area. ==== Malik Al-Sayf ==== Malik Al-Sayf (1165\u20131228) was a member of the Assassin Order in Syria during the High Middle Ages. Trained from an early age in the ways of the Brotherhood, he managed to attain a high rank by the year 1191. Raised to be an Assassin, Malik learned the fighting arts that struck fear into the hearts of their enemies. He was an excellent swordsman and a devoted acolyte to the Creed, as well as a caring adult figure for his brother, Kadar. He was once a rival of Alta\u00efr, whom he often berated for disobeying the tenets of the Assassin's Creed. In 1191 Alta\u00efr, Malik and Kadar went to the Solomon's Temple to get back a relic. His jealousy turned to hatred when Alta\u00efr ignored the tenets of the Creed, endangered his companions' lives during the events of Solomon's Temple, and subsequently botched a mission, resulting in the death of Malik's brother (Kadar Al-Sayf) as well as the injury and subsequent amputation of Malik's arm. Malik retrieved the Templar treasure that Alta\u00efr had failed to find, and delivered it to Al Mualim. No longer able to operate as an Assassin, Malik was made the bureau leader of the Jerusalem Assassins. At first he was bitter towards Alta\u00efr, but over time he comes to forgive him and acknowledges his own fault in his brother's death. When Alta\u00efr returned to confront Al Mualim, Malik supported him, distracting the indoctrinated Assassins while Alta\u00efr faced Al Mualim. After Al Mualim's death, Malik rushed to Alta\u00efr's side as the piece of Eden became activated. Alta\u00efr made Malik his close second-in-command after becoming the Mentor. As such, Malik was eventually appointed as a temporary leader in Alta\u00efr's absence. Sometime after this, a hated rival of Alta\u00efr's, Abbas Sofian, imprisoned Malik in Masyaf's dungeons for close to two years with false charges of murder, and had him beheaded when Alta\u00efr returned from his quest across the Middle East. In 1217 Sef ibn La'Ahad and Malik left Masyaf to fight against Genghis Khan. Malik died in 1228. He is not seen again for the rest of the series, but he is written off in Assassin's Creed II. Alta\u00efr makes mention of his death at the hands of Abbas in Assassin's Creed: Revelations. Malik is voiced by Haaz Sleiman. ==== Kadar Al-Sayf ==== Kadar Al-Sayf is the brother of Malik Al-Sayf. ==== ==== Maria Thorpe (voiced by Eleanor Noble) (1160\u20131227) was an English noblewoman who became a Templar steward, and later the wife of Alta\u00efr. As a child, Maria rejected the gender norms of her time, ultimately being disowned by her parents after annulling her arranged marriage. Seeking to fight in the Third Crusade, she disguised herself as a man and attempted to join the Templar order. The Templar master, Robert De ckly saw through her ruse, but was impressed by her deterimination and hired her as his steward. Eventually, Robert deduced that Alta\u00efr would be coming for him, so he had Maria serve as a decoy to buy him time. Though she expected Alta\u00efr to kill her, he instead spared her, but warned her not to follow him. After Robert was assassinated, Maria became obsessed with revenge. She tracked Alta\u00efr to Acre, but he bested her again, and this time took her prisoner. She escaped in an attempt to join the Templar's new leader, Armand Bouchart, but because of her failure to kill Alta\u00efr, and her \"miraculous\" escape from him, Bouchart perceived her to be either incompetent, or worse, a traitor to the Order. He placed a bounty on the heads of both her and Alta\u00efr, forcing them to work together. They fell in love after Bouchart's defeat. Maria renounced the Templars and became Alta\u00efr's wife, bearing them two sons, Darim and Sef. Maria joined Alta\u00efr and Darim in a mission to Mongolia in a bid to halt the advance of Genghis Khan. While they were away, Abbas murdered Sef. Maria and Alta\u00efr confronted Abbas, and Maria was killed in the ensuing fight. Her last words to her husband were \"Strength, Alta\u00efr...\" ==== Garnier de Nablus ==== Garnier de Nablus Garnier de Nablus (voiced by Hubert Fielden) was a French noblemen, tenth Grand Master of the Knights Hospitalier in Acre. He experimented and tortured innocent people and lunatics he picked up off the streets of Acre, claiming they were his children and that he was helping them. He transformed Acre Fortress into a hospital and he was killed by Alta\u00efr inside it. ==== Ibn Jubayr ==== Ibn Jubayr (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) was a chief scholar of the Saracens in Damascus and leader of \"The Illuminated\". He intended to have all texts in Damascus burned, claiming that these texts led people astray. He was killed by Alta\u00efr during one of his public purges. ==== Al Mualim ==== Engraving of Rashid ad-Din Sinan Rashid ad-Din Sinan, commonly known as Al Mualim (Arabic: \"The Teacher\") (voiced by Peter Renaday) or The Old Man of the Mountain, is based on the real-life Rashid ad-Din Sinan, the Iraqi-born Hashshashin leader in the Syrian town of Masyaf. He appears in Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed: The Secret Crusade. He was the Assassin Mentor who secretly led a double life as a Templar; he was a wizened old man whom Alta\u00efr saw as a father figure. After Alta\u00efr broke all three tenets of the Assassin's Creed in one mission, Al Mualim reduced Alta\u00efr to the rank of an initiate, and gave him a list of nine men to kill in order for Alta\u00efr to redeem himself and bring an end to the Crusade. In fact, Alta\u00efr was killing \"rival\" members of the Templar Order so that Al Mualim could keep the Piece of Eden for himself. Alta\u00efr eventually assassinated the ninth target, Robert de Sabl\u00e9, but with his dying breath, de Sabl\u00e9 told Alta\u00efr of Al Mualim's true plans. Alta\u00efr returned to Masyaf to find that the citizens were being controlled by the Apple, wielded by Al Mualim. Al Mualim himself had broken all three tenets of the Creed, leading to a fight between himself and Alta\u00efr, and after a lengthy battle Al Mualim was killed by his student and Alta\u00efr took possession of The Apple. Al Mualim is back in Assassin's Creed: Revelations in one of the memories of Alta\u00efr. In the memory, Alta\u00efr burns Al Mualim's body on a pyre, ensuring that he can never return. This is a move that unnerves many of the other Assassins, but eventually Alta\u00efr is forgiven and accepted as the new master. ==== Richard the Lionheart ==== 19th-century portrait of Richard the Lionheart by Merry-Joseph Blondel Richard I of England (voiced by Marcel Jeannin) (1157\u20131199), commonly known as Richard the Lionheart, was the King of England from 1189 until his death in 1199. He was the second monarch of the House of Plantagenet, being also the commander of the Crusader army during the Third Crusade, and was considered a great military leader and warrior. Upon his death, he was succeeded as King of England by his younger brother, John. Under Richard, the Crusaders eventually reached Arsuf, where they engaged Saladin's army. Here they were approached by Alta\u00efr. Alta\u00efr then claimed that Robert de Sabl\u00e9, Grand Master of the Knights Templar and one of the generals working alongside Richard, intended to betray the king. However, Robert insisted that Alta\u00efr's story was merely a ruse to keep Richard from interfering in the Assassin's mission. Unsure on whom to believe, Richard left the decision in the hands of God, declaring that Robert and his Templars were to fight Alta\u00efr in a trial by combat. Alta\u00efr proved the victor, and so Richard accepted the Assassin's version of events. ==== Robert de Sabl\u00e9 ==== Robert de Sabl\u00e9 (voiced by Jean-Philippe Dandenaud) appears in Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed: The Secret Crusade. De Sabl\u00e9 was a French lieutenant under Richard the Lionheart, and Grand Master of the Knights Templar during the Third Crusade. Born into a powerful family, Robert de Sabl\u00e9 was immersed from birth into nobility, though events during de Sabl\u00e9's life are difficult to pin down; at some point he became lord and ruler of Briollay, France. Subsequently, de Sabl\u00e9 entered into the order of Knights Templar and reigned as their Grand Master from 1191 to 1193. During the Third Crusade, de Sabl\u00e9 and the Knights Templar laid siege to the city of Acre, which soon fell; throughout August 1191, they also recaptured many fortresses and cities along the Palestinian coast, which had been lost previously. De Sabl\u00e9 followed a goal similar to the Assassins (in that he was attempting to end the war in the Holy Land). Al Mualim had no objections against him ending the Crusade, but was more against the way de Sabl\u00e9 attempted to do so\u2014the Assassins would have people find peace themselves, but the Templars would force their \"peace\" onto others and attempt to control them. ==== Sibrand ==== Sibrand (voiced by Arthur Holden) was a German Crusader and the first Grand Master of the Teutonic Order in Acre. He intended to have all ships submitted to him for him to use in a blockade against King Richard, but he was killed on his personal ship by Alta\u00efr. ==== William of Montferrat ==== William V, Marquess of Montferrat (voiced by Harry Standjofski), also known as Guglielmo V del Monferrato in Italy, was an Italian Crusader and Richard the Lionheart's regent in Acre. He planned to kill Richard and give Acre to his son Conrad of Montferrat, making his plans inside Acre's Citadel. === Characters of Assassin's Creed: Lineage, II and II: Discovery === ==== Ezio Auditore da Firenze ==== Ezio Auditore da Firenze (1459\u20131524) was a Florentine nobleman during the Renaissance and unbeknownst to most historians and philosophers, the Mentor of the Italian Brotherhood of Assassins, a title which he held from 1503 to 1513. He died in 1524 while sitting on a bench in a market. Moments before his death a mysterious man had sat with him and had told him to stay strong. To this day no one knows who that man was. He is also an ancestor to William and Desmond Miles, as well as Clay Kaczmarek. Ezio appears in Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, and Assassin's Creed: Revelations. He is the main character of the short Assassin's Creed: Embers. He is voiced by actor Roger Craig Smith. ==== Federico Auditore ==== Federico Auditore was a noble born in 1456. He is the older brother of the Auditore family. In 1475 he entered the Medici bank as a clerk, but in 1476 he was removed from the bank's payroll (on 17 September 1475 a bag of gold florins went missing). He fought with Ezio against Vieri de Pazzi, then they visited a doctor to treated his wound, they raced to the top of Santa Trinita and finally Ezio visited Cristina Vespucci before they returned to home. His father Giovanni and his brother Petruccio were captured and hanged at the Palazzo della Signoria in 1476 by Uberto Alberti and Rodrigo Borgia. Federico Auditore was created for the game, he and the rest of his family did not exist in real life. He is voiced by Elias Toufexis. He is played by Jesse Rath in Assassin's Creed: Lineage (2009), directed by Yves Simoneau and co-written by William Reymond. ==== Vieri de' Pazzi ==== Vieri de' Pazzi (1459-14 April 1478) was a noble and the youngest member of the Pazzi family. He burned right through his father's money, spending scores involving weaponry, exotic animals and clothes. Fiercely competitive, he hosted running races, boating and horseback riding, but all of them were rigged, so when he lost, he would invite the winner's entire family over for a victory poisoned dinner. He was trained by his father, Francesco, and in 1474 he worked with him to take over Florence. On 14 April 1478 he was killed by Ezio. ==== Cristina Vespucci ==== Cristina Vespucci (voiced by Amber Goldfarb) (1459\u20131498) was a well-known Florentine beauty, and a favorite of painters; most notably Sandro Botticelli, who used her as a model for several of his paintings. She was introduced in Assassin's Creed II, though most of her story is told during the \"Repressed Memory Sequences\" from Brotherhood. She was the cousin of the Italian explorer, financier, navigator and cartographer Amerigo Vespucci. She was a first love interest of Ezio Auditore da Firenze. When Ezio had to leave for Monteriggioni, he asked Cristina to come with him. She refused though, as she didn't want to leave her family behind. Accepting her decision, Ezio gave her a pendant to remember him. In 1478, Cristina married Manfredo Soderini, but more because of her father's will than her own. Just one day before their wedding, Ezio returned to Florence and visited Cristina, unaware of the direction her life had taken. Cristina told Ezio she didn't expect him to return and reveals her engagement. Even though he is heartbroken, it is Ezio who appeals to Manfredo's conscience, telling him to stop gambling and start being a good husband. After Lorenzo de' Medici's death in 1494, Girolamo Savonarola takes control of Florence and starts the Fal\u00f2 delle vanit\u00e0 (Bonfire of the Vanities). Because of their rich fineries, the home of Cristina and Manfredo was attacked by the fanatics following Savonarola. Ezio came to her aid, but she was already mortally wounded. Cristina showed him the pendant he had given her twenty-two years ago, and said she wished for another chance with him. She died in his arms. Cristina Vespucci is based on real life historical figure Simonetta Vespucci. ==== Giovanni Auditore ==== Giovanni Auditore (3 May 1436-29 December 1476) was a banker, advisor, and nobleman, and a pivotal figure in Florentine banking. The father of Ezio, Giovanni oversaw the Medici bank branches across Italy, and when Lorenzo was busy, he runed the bank (he became his closest advisor, so as a reward, Lorenzo paid for his palazzo). He extended his reach out into the international operation and he noticed the problems with the Lyon bank, so Francesco Sassetti saved the branch. In 1471 he secured the negotiations between the Pope and the Medici bank. This character is based on Giovanni Villani. ==== Claudia Auditore ==== Claudia Auditore (voiced by Angela Galuppo) (1461-unknown) was a Florentine noblewoman during the Renaissance, and a member of the Assassin Order. She was the sister of Ezio Auditore, who became the Mentor of the Italian Assassins. In 1476, Claudia became the financial accountant of the town of Monteriggioni, which was under the leadership of her uncle Mario Auditore. The town flourished with Claudia's organization and the money made from Monteriggioni's shops and organizations, which had been opened once more. In January 1500, Monteriggioni was besieged and largely destroyed by the Borgia army, under command of Cesare Borgia, leaving the Auditore homeless. Against her brother's desire for Claudia and her mother Maria to go to their hometown of Florence, Claudia and Maria followed Ezio to Rome, where Claudia became the Madame of the Rosa in Fiore, the city's most popular brothel. Eventually, after proving herself to be a worthy fighter to her brother, Ezio inducted Claudia into the Order of Assassins. The following year, Claudia was captured by Borgia die-hards, and subsequently saved by Ezio and Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli. During this time, she stepped down as the Madame of the Rosa in Fiore, and stayed in Florence with her friend Paola, in order to recover until 1507. Claudia was given temporary control of the Italian Assassins in 1510, when her brother left on a journey to the Middle East to find the library of the legendary Alta\u00efr Ibn-La\u02bcAhad, which was said to be in Masyaf. She held this position until her brother returned in late 1512, after which Ezio resigned from the Order and assigned a successor. ==== Maria Auditore ==== Maria Auditore (1432-1504) was a writer and noble. She was born into the Mozzi, a powerful banking family. She is one of the most famous historical sources of the time period due to her multi-volume diary (she wrote on it until 1476), which has been translated by several notable scholars and is on display in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. With funding from her parents, she opened up a bakery in the courtyard of her family palazzo, which she transformed into an artistic gathering place. There, in 1448, she met Giovanni Auditore, and were married in 1450. ==== Petruccio Auditore ==== Petruccio Auditore (1463-29 December 1476) was a student and noble, youngest of the Auditore family. In 1475 he was pulled from school due to illness (he had a weak constitution) and was confined to bed. It is probable that he eventually succumbed to the illness. ==== Annetta ==== Annetta (1457-1511) was the Auditore family's live-in servant. ==== Lorenzo de' Medici ==== Portrait of Lorenzo by Rubens (17th century) Lorenzo de' Medici (1449\u20131492) was an Italian statesman and de facto ruler of the Florentine Republic during the Italian Renaissance. Known as il Magnifico (the Magnificent) by contemporary Florentines, he was a diplomat, politician and patron of scholars, artists, and poets. His life coincided with the high point of the early Italian Renaissance; his death marked the end of the Golden Age of Florence. The fragile peace he helped maintain between the various Italian states collapsed with his death. Lorenzo de' Medici is buried next to his brother Giuliano in the Medici Chapel in Florence. Secretly, Lorenzo de' Medici was an ally of the Assassins, particularly the House of Auditore. Lorenzo worked closely with Giovanni Auditore da Firenze, a close friend and ally, against the corrupted Borgia. After Giovanni's death, Lorenzo was saved by his son Ezio during the Pazzi conspiracy. This caused a long-term relationship between them, with Ezio carrying out several assassination contracts in cities such as Forl\u00ec and Venice for Lorenzo. ==== Mario Auditore ==== Mario Auditore (19 March 1434-2 January 1500) was an important condottiero and nobleman who stayed at Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni and patrolled the Tuscan countryside. In 1440 he began his militar career when he played a significant role in the Battle of Anghiari (conflict between Florentines and Milaneses): on an expedition to Monterchi with his father, he alerted Micheletto Attendolo to the surprise advance by Milanese troops, so the attack was foiled and the Florentines won the battle. Then he defended the interests of Monteriggioni, derailing Florentine attempts to seize Tuscan territory. After Giovanni's death, he brought his children to the Villa and taught Ezio about the conflict between Assassins and Templars. ==== Paola ==== Paola (b. 1438-after 1512) was the madame of La Rosa Colta. In 1446 she was orphaned when her parents were killed at sea, so she began his life of prostitution on the streets until 1454. In 1458 she was arrested for murdering a city guard, and Giovanni represented her in court, winning the case on a self-defence plea. She released from prison and went on to start her own brothel to protect other unfortunate women of the street. ==== Uberto Alberti ==== A friend of Auditore family, he was a self taught lawyer who arrested Giovanni, Federico and Petruccio Auditore and sentenced them and Ezio Auditore to death. After the arrest, Ezio Auditore was sent by his father to find documents to giving it to Alberti in order to prove his innocence, but he betrayed them. He is assassinated by Ezio Auditore at Santa Croce, Florence, in 1476. After his assassination, Ezio escaped with his mother Maria and his sister Claudia to Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni, who was owned by his uncle Mario. The complot was organised by him, Rodrigo Borgia and the Pazzi. His death is considered one of the most satisfying deaths in videogames. He is played by Michel Perron in Assassin's Creed: Lineage (2009). ==== Shaun Hastings ==== Shaun Hastings (voiced by and modelled on Danny Wallace) (b. 1985) is a cynical, condescending and pessimistic member of the Assassin's team, specializing in research and information handling. Through conversations in Assassin's Creed II, Desmond learns that Shaun was interested in conspiracies from an early age, and developed a love of history. Though he was unaware of the existence of modern-day Templars and Assassins, he realized that there was some power-struggle going on. Shaun attempted to tell others about his findings, not realizing that the Templars would try to silence him. Fortunately, Rebecca Crane apparently \"rescued\" Shaun and recruited him into the Order. This is mentioned as being unconventional, as most Assassins were usually born into the Order, not recruited. In 2013, Shaun infiltrated Abstergo by working as a coffee vendor at their Entertainment subsidiary in Montreal, in order to find out what happened to Desmond's body. A year later, under the alias \"Deacon\", Shaun and Bishop enlisted the help of a Helix player in order to locate the remains of a Sage during the French Revolution. ==== Rebecca Crane ==== Rebecca Crane (voiced by and modelled on Eliza Schneider) (b. 1984) is a member of the Assassin Order and the creator of the Animus 2.0, which she affectionately referred to as \"Baby\". She was a member of Lucy Stillman's team, which concentrated on acquiring an Apple of Eden before Abstergo Industries, as well as training Desmond Miles through the use of the Bleeding Effect. She provided technical support for the other members of the Assassin Order alongside her fellow Assassin, Shaun Hastings. After Desmond's death, Rebecca worked with Shaun to infiltrate Abstergo Entertainment as a courier. In 2015, Rebecca and Shaun headed to London with fellow Assassin Galina Voronina in order to locate and extract the Shroud of Eden. Despite this, their efforts fail, and Rebecca is wounded when she takes a shot meant for Shaun. Nevertheless, the trio manages to escape after Galina dispatches most of the Abstergo agents surrounding them. ==== Caterina Sforza ==== La dama dei gelsomini, by Lorenzo di Credi, presumed portrait of Caterina Sforza Caterina Sforza (1463\u20131509) was the Countess of Forl\u00ec and Imola, and the daughter of Galeazzo Maria Sforza, the Duke of Milan. She was engaged to Pope Sixtus IV's nephew, Girolamo Riario, at only 10 years of age, and consummated the marriage at 14. As countess of Forl\u00ec, she became a strong ally of the Assassin Order, meeting the Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze after her husband Girolamo had her trapped on a small island in Romagna. Eight years later, Caterina had her husband killed by the Orsi brothers after finding out that he was working for the Templars, along with being a poor husband. Offering to keep the ancient artifact, the \"Apple of Eden\", safe in Forl\u00ec, Caterina and the Assassins Ezio and Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli found the city taken by the Orsi brothers, who were hired by the Templars. Retaking the city, Ezio saved Caterina's children from the Orsi and killed the two brothers, though the Apple was eventually taken from him by a mysterious monk. Caterina later traveled to the Italian Assassins' headquarters in Monteriggioni, requesting for aid against Cesare Borgia's army. Unexpectedly, Monteriggioni was besieged by Cesare the next day, causing the town to be destroyed and Caterina to be captured. The next year, Caterina was transported to the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome to be jailed. However, her imprisonment lasted not even a day, as Ezio Auditore infiltrated the Castel, with the primary aim of killing Cesare and Rodrigo Borgia. With the two away from the Castel, however, Ezio decided to free Caterina with a key taken from Lucrezia Borgia, and a few weeks later, Caterina returned to Florence to await the restoration of her lands. ==== Leonardo da Vinci ==== Portrait of Leonardo by Francesco Melzi Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (voiced by Carlos Ferro) (1452\u20131519), better known as Leonardo da Vinci or simply Leonardo, was an Italian Renaissance polymath. His genius, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. His lifelong friendship with Ezio Auditore begins when Ezio's mother, Maria, has her son help Leonardo move some paintings from his new workshop. Leonardo comments that his current work lacks purpose, but Maria is confident that he will go on to do great things. After Ezio's father and brothers are murdered by Rodrigo Borgia's men, Ezio brings to Leonardo two objects from his father's study: a broken hidden blade, and a page from the mysterious Codex written by Alta\u00efr. Leonardo repairs the blade and deciphers the codex, fascinated by the technological secrets it alludes to. As Ezio continues his Assassin training, Leonardo makes several upgrades to Ezio's weapons and armor, including a poison blade, a gun, and a poison dart launcher. Some time after Ezio foils the Pazzi conspiracy, Leonardo receives a commission from a Venetian noble, prompting him to set up a new workshop in Venice. As Ezio had his own business in the city, he accompanied him. He developed an interest in flight, and invented an experimental flying machine, which Ezio used on one of his missions. After seeing the Apple of Eden, Leonardo marveled at the futuristic visions it showed him. He then developed an interest in the findings of Pythagoras, and was eventually able to create a map leading to a temple built by his followers. Eventually, Leonardo was blackmailed by Cesare Borgia into designing Templar war machines. He continued to support Ezio, in secret, until he was kidnapped by a third party, the Cult of Hermes, who wanted him to lead them to the Temple of Pythagoras. He is eventually rescued by Ezio, and despite his injuries, explores the Temple, fascinated by the numeric codes found within. Although Leonardo does not appear in Assassin's Creed: Revelations, the novelization describes him dying peacefully at his home in Amboise, with his friends (including Ezio, who is now retired from the Assassins) at his side. In Assassin's Creed III, the Darvenport Homestead's residential carpenter obtained some of Leonardo's blueprints and, at Connor's request, build a prototype replica of the original flying machine. ==== Alvise da Vilandino ==== Alvise da Vilandino (1441-1550s) was a Venetian baggage handler who enlisted in the navy. In 1500 he was tasked with defending the fortress of Modon from the Turks. After a heavy night of drinking, he awoke to Turkish cannon fire bombarding the town. Panicking while running across the deck, he tripped, hit his head and drowned. For that reason he was accused of negligence by the ship's captain and erased from the logs of the navy. ==== Antonio de Magianis ==== Antonio de Magianis (b. 1443) was the leader of the Gilda dei Ladri di Venezia. He was born at the very bottom of Venetian society, son of a cobbler, while his mother was a live-in maid for the Bellini family. Between the apprenticeship sessions with his father, he taught himself to read and write. Then he appiled to the University of Padua but was denied due to his low social rank, applying to other schools around Italy as well, and denying at all of them. In 1469 he robbed a noble Venetian estate owned by the rector of the University of Padua, he was incarcerated, and he mysteriously escaped from prison. ==== Rosa ==== Rosa (b. 1460) was a thief. Child of an unknown Venetian nobleman and a prostitute, she grew up on her own in the streets of Venice. In 1475 she attempted to pickpocket the leader of the Venetian Thieves Guild, was caught, but Antonio took her on as a pupil. ==== Teodora Contanto ==== Teodora Contanto (b. 1450-after 1516) was the madame of La Rosa della Virt\u00f9. Her parents owned a jewellery store, and she was apprenticed to her mother as a shop girl. On 26 November 1467 she engaged in adultery with a married man, and his wife alerted the Venetian courts, so her parents reacted by sending her to a nunnery to live the rest of her life in prayer and silence. In 1467 she entered Santa Maria degli Angeli, determined to do penance for her crime, but in 1473 she deserted the Church. For that reason she abandoned her family name. In the same year she opened La Rosa della Virt\u00f9, frequented by Pietro Bembo. ==== Alexander VI ==== Portrait of Pope Alexander VI Pope Alexander VI (voiced by Manuel Tadros) appears in Assassin's Creed: Lineage, Assassin's Creed II, and Assassin's Creed: Renaissance. Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia (Italianized name) (January 1, 1431 \u2013 August 18, 1503), born Roderic Llan\u00e7ol, later Roderic de Borja i Borja, was the leader of the Knights Templar during the Renaissance in Italy. He was elected Pope from 1492 to 1503 as Alexander VI. His enemies called him \"The Spaniard\" (due to his Spanish origins) while his Templar followers called him \"Maestro\" (\"Master\" in Italian and \"teacher\" in Spanish). He was one of the most controversial of the Renaissance popes, and his surname (Italianized as Borgia) became a byword for the debased standards of the papacy of that era. Borgia was elected Pope in 1492 and established his power in Rome; his true intent, however, was to gain access to the vault that lies under the Vatican, where, according to Borgia, God Himself rested. Borgia appeared as a minor character in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, which takes place in 1503, the last year of his papacy. He is killed after he is murdered by Cesare, who is poisoned by Rodrigo only seconds before. ==== Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli ==== Portrait of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli by Santi di Tito Niccol\u00f2 di Bernardo dei Machiavelli (voiced by Shawn Baichoo) (1469\u20131527) or simply Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, is a supporting character of Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. He was an Italian philosopher and writer, and a member of the Assassin Order. With the Assassin Order, Niccol\u00f2 primarily worked with his ally Ezio Auditore da Firenze, and helped him with driving the Orsi brothers from Forl\u00ec and with removing the monk Girolamo Savonarola from power in Florence to obtain the \"Apple of Eden\" from him. Two years later, Machiavelli took up the position of leader of the Italian Assassins. Once again joined by Ezio, they fought against the corrupted Borgia family, which ruled over Rome. ==== Girolamo Savonarola ==== Girolamo Savonarola by Fra Bartolomeo, , Museo di San Marco, Florence Girolamo Savonarola (1452\u20131498) was a Dominican friar and the leader of Florence from 1494 to 1498. Despite having great ambitions, most men found him lacking the ability to be a great leader. In 1488, Savonarola managed to obtain an Apple of Eden. Recognizing its powers, he used it to instigate the Bonfire of the Vanities in Florence; hoping to cleanse the city of everything he regarded as evil, such as art and wealth. ==== Orsi Brothers ==== Checco (1458-7 July 1488) and Ludovico Orsi (1455-7 July 1488) decided to start a successful money lending business mostly because they killed anyone who didn't pay them back. Caterina Sforza hired them to murder Girolamo Riario, her Templar husband, so they rode up to his palace, waltzed into the dining room, stabbed him in the chest, ransacked the estate and left his naked body in the center of town. Rodrigo Borgia offered to pay them for the recapture of the Piece of Eden and Caterina's head, and they got the idea to kidnap her children. === Characters of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Revelations === ==== Angelina Ceresa ==== Angelina Ceresa (d. 2 January 1500) was an acquaintance of Claudia Auditore, who lived in Monteriggioni. On 1 January 1500 she helped in the preparations for Claudia Auditore's birthday party in the Villa Auditore, and Ezio came to her aid. The following day Cesare Borgia's forces besieged Monteriggioni, Ezio saw Angelina crying outside the remains of her destroyed home, later she was killed and her head was stuck upon the pike of a Borgia soldier's halberd. ==== Margherita dei Campi ==== Margherita dei Campi was a countess of Rome. She tended to Ezio's injuries after Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli took him to Margherita's house in the northern Campagna District. ==== Jacopo de Grassi ==== Jacopo de Grassi was a high ranking Borgia guard in Rome and Captain of one of the five Borgia towers that ruled over the Centro District. In January 1500 he was killed by Ezio by throwing him into a scaffolding. ==== Followers of Romulus ==== Followers of Romulus () were a pagan cult operating in several abandoned locations underneath Rome. They worshipped Romulus and they believed that he was part wolf and part man, which explains their wardrobe. The leaders of the cult were hired by the Borgia to influence the Followers into doing their bidding, which often ended in \"sermons\" and evocations of their god. They mainly used to cause fear amongst civilians, and later they were instructed to focus on the Assassins. ==== Fabio Orsini ==== Fabio Orsini (1476 or 1477-29 December 1504) was a condottiero from the Orsini family. In 1494 he entered Montepulciano to help the Sienese. In 1498 he partnered with Bartolomeo d'Alviano against the Savelli, and seemed to help his new in-laws when married Jeronima Borgia, a cousin of Lucrezia, but in 1499, while Cesare was in Romagna, he freed a friend imprisoned in the Tor di Nona, and his father Paolo was killed by Cesare. Then he attacked Micheletto's army and lost, becoming an outlaw raiding the countryside, putting him on a list of bandits published by the Pope. He continued to wage war until dying of a head wound after the battle of Garigliano in 1504. ==== Il Carnefice ==== Il Carnefice (1473-January 1500) was an executioner allied to the Borgia. He fancied himself as some sort of twisted artist. ==== Malfatto ==== Malfatto (died 1502) was a masked doctor who ravaged the poor district of Rome to preys on those unfortunates. In 1502 he was seen lurking outside the Rosa in Fiore. ==== Octavian de Valois ==== Octavian de Valois (1448-August 1503) was a French general and Baron of Valois. In 1498 he was propelled by the crowning of Louis XII, his cousin, to the front of the ranks in his Italian campaign, but he had only formal training and no field experience. Cesare and Juan Borgia arrived to France to court Cesare's future wife Charlotte d'Albret, where Octavian encountered them, and one month later he left for Italy. In 1500 he marched into Rome with his men, being attacked by Bartolomeo d'Alviano. ==== Gaspar de la Croix ==== Gaspar de la Croix (1466-August 1503) was a master weapons engineer and an expert marksman, that is, something of a sniper pioneer. Cesare made use of his skill with a firearm, to take down easy targets. ==== Lanz ==== Lanz (1480-August 1503) was a Roman thief connected to a variety of domestic disturbances. He ran with the Cento Occhi gang. ==== Cesare Borgia ==== Portrait of a man traditionally said to be Cesare Borgia Cesare Borgia (voiced by Andreas Apergis) appears in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. Cesare Borgia (c. 1475\u20131507) was the son of Rodrigo Borgia. He was naturally ambitious and aggressive; at age 18, when he sought his brother Juan Borgia the Younger's position as Captain General of the Papal Army (Cesare was a Cardinal at the time), he had his brother assassinated. After leading the army to many victories throughout Italy, Cesare developed extreme sadism and a lust for conquest, having the primary goal to unify all of Italy and conquer all of Spain. In effect, he and his father were continually at odds. Near the end of his life, he was imprisoned before escaping and raising an army for a last stand before being thrown off a wall by Ezio, ending his life. ==== Lucrezia Borgia ==== Possible portrait of Lucrezia Borgia, Bartolomeo Veneziano () Lucrezia Borgia (voiced by Liane Balaban) (April 18, 1480 \u2013 June 24, 1519) appears in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood. She is the daughter of Rodrigo Borgia and the sister of Cesare Borgia. She is first seen in a portrait in Assassin's Creed II as a little girl with brown hair. She appears in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood as a woman, her hair now blonde. She is shown to have incestuous affairs with both her father and her brother, the latter of whom tells her that she will be his queen. She has secured a political advantage for her family by marrying many powerful nobles and then having them disgraced or killed soon thereafter. She grows tired of Cesare's womanizing ways, however, and plans to leave the Vatican. Despite this, she still warns her brother of the poisoned apple he received from Rodrigo. In turn, Cesare beat her until she revealed the Piece of Eden's location. Disillusioned by his actions, she helped Ezio find said Piece of Eden and left the Vatican behind. Her in-game portrait reveals that she and her husband fled Rome and relocated to Ferrara where she encountered Ezio again in 1506 while he was looking for the first da Vinci painting, Annunciation. ==== Clay Kaczmarek (Subject 16) ==== Clay Kaczmarek (voiced by Cam Clarke in Assassin's Creed II and Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and by Graham Cuthbertson in Assassin's Creed: Revelations) (1982\u20132012) also known as Subject 16 of the Animus Project, was a member of the Assassin Order during the early 21st century. Born into a family of engineers, Clay faced psychological problems due to developmental disorders and his father's neglectful attitude. Because of this, Clay ran into the Assassins while looking for acceptance. As a member of the Assassin Brotherhood, Clay's most important mission was to infiltrate Abstergo Industries as a subject of the Animus Project, in order to obtain more information on the Animus. Labeled Subject 16, Clay was forced to relive the memories of his ancestors via his genetic memory. When Clay found out that his teammate, Lucy Stillman\u2014who infiltrated Abstergo years before and was tasked with getting Clay out of Abstergo safely\u2014had abandoned their cause to join their enemies, the Templars, Clay had to spend days and hours of sessions inside the Animus. Since it left his mind incapable of separating his own personality from those of his ancestors', Clay became mentally unstable to the point that he ultimately committed suicide. After his alleged suicide, Clay continued to exist as an AI recreation of his personality within the Animus. As such, he was able to manipulate much of the Animus' programming from within to help his successor in the Animus Project, Desmond Miles. ==== Sofia Sartor ==== Sofia Sartor (voiced by Anna Tuveri) (1476\u2013unknown) as a Venetian-Ottoman bookshop owner, and a literary enthusiast. Though born in the city of Constantinople, Sofia was forced to leave for Venice in 1499, when the Ottoman-Venetian war began. Sofia eventually returned to her birthplace in 1507, in order to run a bookstore at the old Polo trading post. In 1511, she met the Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the man who would eventually become her husband, and the father of their two children. In this regard, she is an ancestor to Desmond Miles through the paternal line. A polylingual, multicultural, and intelligent woman mature beyond her years, Sofia had a passion for literature, which fueled her decision to run her bookstore, in the hopes of sharing the democratizing effect she felt in books with others. ==== Tarik Barleti ==== Tarik Barleti (voiced by JB Blanc) (1470\u20131511) is the captain of the Janissaries, the personal guard of the Ottoman Sultan. Tarik was born to a Christian Albanian family, and he was taken at a young age to be trained to fight. He is a close friend of Prince Selim I. Ezio thought that Tarik to be a Templar because of his behavior, and he was selling weapons to Manuel Palaiologos, a known Templar. Ezio decided to act on his theory, and he struck Tarik down. In his final moments, Tarik revealed that he planned to attack Manuel's Byzantine Templars in Cappadocia. He made a final request to Ezio to stop the Templars. Ezio honored it. Tarik is one of the few assassination targets that is unaffiliated with the Templars or Assassins. ==== Vali cel Tradat ==== Vali cel Tradat (unknown\u20131511) was a Wallachian noble, former Assassin and member of the Templar Order. Having served the Assassin Order for around a decade, Vali left the Assassins after they made a truce with the Ottomans; the same people who had humiliated his people, conquered Wallachia, and murdered his secret idol Vlad Tepes. Feeling betrayed, he joined the Templars, striving for vengeance against the Assassins and Ottomans. ==== Yusuf Tazim ==== Yusuf Tazim (voiced by Chris Parson) is a character in Assassin's Creed: Revelations. He is an easygoing Master Assassin, and leader of the Ottoman Assassin Brotherhood, rising to the post sometime before 1511 AD. That year, he met Ezio Auditore, and he introduced Ezio to Constantinople and the Ottoman hookblade. Ezio describes Yusuf as \"affable\". Yusuf often talks with humor, poking fun at Ezio or at Italians in general. Furthermore, he is an expert at crafting bombs and at combat. When Ezio returns from Cappadocia, he finds Sofia Sartor's shop in ruins and Yusuf murdered at the hands of Ahmet, a note knifed to his back. The message on the note is never revealed. Tazim is voiced by Chris Parson in Revelations, and is portrayed by Matias Varela in the 2016 Assassin's Creed film. ==== Manuel Palaiologos ==== Manuel Palaiologos (voiced by Vlasta Vr\u00e1na) (1454\u20131512) is the heir to the lost Byzantine Empire throne. Manuel is a major Templar Leader and appears in Assassin's Creed: Revelations. He is conspiring in taking back Constantinople with the help of Ahmet, heir to Sultan Bayezid II of the Ottoman Empire. He is assassinated by Ezio in the Byzantine-controlled city of Cappadocia. ==== Piri Reis ==== Statue of Piri Reis Ahmed Muhiddin Piri (c. 1467 \u2013 c. 1554), better known as Piri Reis, was a famed admiral and cartographer. He was also a member of the Assassin Order and served the Assassins as a technician and intelligence gatherer, primarily providing them with materials and methods for crafting bombs. He was a trusted friend of the Turkish Assassin leader Yusuf Tazim, and also later befriended Ezio Auditore. ==== Ahmet ==== \u015eehzade Ahmet (voiced by Tamer Hassan) appears in Assassin's Creed: Revelations. Ahmet (1465\u20131512) was the eldest living son of Bayezid II and brother to Selim I. Sharing many characteristics with his father, he was believed to be the perfect candidate for the sultan's heir, even more so when he served as governor of Amasya. However, many of the Ottoman Empire (The Janissaries in particular) deem him to be an unfit ruler in times of war and times of peace. Furthermore, they do not see him as a traditional Sultan and thus do not support him. He sets up the unsuccessful ambush and capture of Prince Suleiman by Byzantine Templars, intending to have him rescued, subsequently making Ahmet appear to be a brave hero. His plans fail, but while Ezio is away in Cappadocia, Ahmet takes Sofia Sartor hostage and demands Ezio exchanges the Masyaf key for her. After the exchange, Ahmet flees the city and Ezio follows him with Sofia. After Ezio catches up with him, Ahmet's brother Selim arrives. Selim proclaims his authority as the new Sultan and kills his own brother by strangling him and then tossing him off a cliff. (Sehzade is the Turkish form of the title \"Prince\" and refers to a son or male-line descendant of an Ottoman Sultan). ==== Suleiman ==== Suleiman in a portrait attributed to Titian Suleiman I (1494\u20131566), was the tenth Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1520 until his death. He was the son of Selim I. Suleiman I was considered one of the Empire's greatest rulers, and was known in the West as Suleiman the Magnificent, as his reign engineered the Golden Age of Constantinople. He was also known by his fellow Turks as Kanuni or the Law Giver. Suleiman became embroiled in the struggle between the Templars and Assassins during 1511. After a failed kidnap attempt by Byzantine Templars working for Manuel Palaiologos, Suleiman befriended the Italian Assassin and Mentor, Ezio Auditore, who encouraged Suleiman's progressive attitude for peace in the Ottoman Empire. === Characters of Assassin's Creed: Embers === ==== Flavia Auditore ==== Flavia Auditore (voiced by Angela Galuppo) is a character in the short-film Assassin's Creed: Embers. She was the daughter of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, and the next ancestor to Desmond Miles through that bloodline. She was present with her mother in Florence, when her father died of a heart attack. ==== Marcello Auditore ==== Marcello Auditore (October 1514-unknown) was the son of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, and his wife, Sofia Sartor. === Characters of Assassin's Creed III and III: Liberation === ==== Haytham Kenway ==== Haytham E. Kenway (1725\u20131781) was a British Templar and eventual first Grand Master of the Templar Order's Colonial Rite, reigning from 1754 until his death. He is the son of Edward Kenway and the father of Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton, and an ancestor to Desmond Miles, all of whom were members of the Assassin Order. He is the playable character in the first three sequences of Assassin's Creed III and an antagonist of the second half of the story. He also is a key character in Assassin's Creed Rogue. He was born on 4 December 1725 in London, England, son of Edward Kenway, a rich and inscrutable man, and Tessa Stephenson-Oakley, who came from a good family. He had an older half- sister, Jenny, who was Edward's daughter from a previous union. In 1733, he spoke to Tom Barrett, a neighbour boy, about his family (he was looked after in every way and no contact with other children). In 12 April he moved with his family to White's Chocolate House, where he met Reginal Birch, the property manager, who made a show of courting his half-sister Jenny. They were accosted by beggars to threaten to end the business associations, they lunged at Tessa and Edward defended her, pulling a knife on them. Then he received a sword from his father, who began to instruct him. He was sent to the American colonies by Grand Master Reginald Birch in 1754 to establish his own Templar group to rival the colonial Assassins and to search for clues about artifacts related to the First Civilization. He didn't find the artifacts but he recruit a small, dedicated band of Templars. He also attempted to forge a relationship with the Kanien\u2019keh\u00e1:ka in the frontier and with Kanieht\u00ed:io, her briefly lover. They ended up raising their son Connor. He was assassinated by his son in 1781 while trying to save his Templar friend Charles Lee. He is voiced by actor Adrian Hough. ==== Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton ==== Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton (; alias: Connor; 1756 \u2013 unknown) was an Anglo-Kanien\u02bckeh\u00e1\ua789ka Assassin who struggled to protect the Haudenosaunee as he fought for the Patriots during the American Revolutionary War. Trained by Achilles in the mid eighteenth century. He mastered the tomahawk, a short axe, and rope darts. Known for assassinating William Johnson, Benjamin Church, John Pitcairn, Thomas Hickey, Charles Lee, Kanen\u02bct\u00f3\ua789kon and Haytham Kenway (his own father). He developed and maintained a strong working relationship with General Washington, even after learning Washington's responsibility for his mother's death. He is an ancestor of Desmond Miles through the paternal line. Connor is also the son of Haytham Kenway and the grandson of Edward Kenway. He appears in Assassin's Creed III and Assassin's Creed III: Liberation. He is voiced by Noah Watts. ==== Io\ua789nhi\u00f2te ==== Io\ua789nhi\u00f2te was the daughter of the Assassin Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton, granddaughter of the Templar Haytham Kenway, and great-granddaughter of the pirate Assassin Edward Kenway. The youngest of Connor's three children, she possessed the rare ability of Eagle Vision. ==== Daniel Cross ==== Daniel Cross (1974\u20132012) was a member of the Templar Order and a sleeper agent tasked with the infiltration of the Assassin Brotherhood, in order to assassinate its Mentor. Daniel was the grandson of Innokenti Orelov and the great-grandson of Nikolai Orelov, a prominent member of the Russian Assassin Brotherhood. He was also the main responsible behind the Great Purge of 2000 which killed almost the entire Assassin Brotherhood. Daniel was killed by Desmond Miles in Assassin's Creed III. He is voiced by Danny Blanco-Hall. ==== William Miles ==== William Miles (voiced by and modelled on John de Lancie) (b. 1948) is the father of Desmond Miles and de facto leader of the entire Assassin Order during the events of the games, having risen to the position following the death of the Mentor in 2000. He raised Desmond in the ways of the Assassins, teaching him about the order and what they fought for, his training often scared Desmond which ultimately led him to run away from his parents. William's first appearance is in 'Revelations' where he talks with Rebecca and Shaun when Desmond is in the Animus Black room explaining Desmond's importance to the Assassin's on his ability to wield the Apple properly. He questions Rebecca and Shaun if Desmond and Lucy were close and he felt sad about Lucy's death claiming that she was 'a remarkable woman'. He is the first person to greet Desmond after recovering from his coma. In Assassins Creed III, William and his team arrive at the Grand Temple. William is captured by Abstergo agents in Egypt when attempting to retrieve a power cell needed to activate the Vault within the Grand Temple and is taken to their facility in Italy. Desmond eventually infiltrates the facility, rescues William and retrieves the power cell. ==== Achilles Davenport ==== Achilles Davenport: (voiced by Roger Aaron Brown) (1710\u20131781) was a Master Assassin and a mentor for a span of time during the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. He appears in Assassin's Creed III and Assassin's Creed: Rogue. Achilles, born in the Caribbean, was the last recruit in the mid-1730s of Mayan Grand Master Ah Tabai. He was the Mentor of the Colonial Brotherhood of Assassins from 1746 until 1763. A man of Caribbean and British descent, Achilles' tenure as leader of the Colonial Assassins saw the Brotherhood strengthen greatly until 1763 when the Brotherhood collapsed and ultimately disbanded as a result of his mismanagement that very nearly destroyed the world. In Rogue, Haytham Kenway shot Achilles in the leg as punishment for endangering innocents after his former student Shay Cormac convinced the latter to spare his life. Living in exile in his manor, Achilles abandoned the Assassin ideology until his meeting with the young Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton, Haytham's son, whom he started to train on the boy's behest. Achilles spent his final years guiding Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton, and this tutelage led to his apprentice's important role in the American Revolution and the extermination of the colonial Templars. In 1781 Achilles died quietly in his sleep. When Connor discovered his body, he also uncovered a note addressed to him in Achilles' handwriting. Written within, Achilles apologized for never being able to say goodbye to Connor properly, and also thanked him, expressing pride and gratitude in Connor for the community he had raised at the Homestead. A funeral service was held on the hill, behind his manor overlooking the sea, next to the gravestones of his wife and son; this event was attended by all of the inhabitants of the Homestead that Connor had brought together. While others laid roses on his coffin, wrapped in the Davenport Homestead flag, Connor placed a feather on the casket, symbolizing the bond they shared as Assassins. ==== Kanen\u02bct\u00f3\ua789kon ==== Kanen\u02bct\u00f3\ua789kon (voiced by Akwirat\u00e9kha Martin) (1756\u20131778) was a member of the Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka nation of the Mohawk Valley (where the Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka were also members of the Iroquois Confederacy) and a close childhood friend of Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton. Though he initially advocated for the Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka to remain neutral in the American Revolutionary War, he and several other of his village's warriors later began to believe that they could protect their people by siding with the British. In this regard, he was manipulated by Charles Lee into believing that Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton had joined George Washington in a campaign against the Mohawk people, prompting him to attack his former friend when he tried to intervene in a Mohawk ambush on colonial soldiers. Pinned to the ground and vulnerable to a lethal blow, Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton was forced to stab Kanen\u02bct\u00f3\ua789kon in the neck with his Hidden Blade, killing him. ==== Kanieht\u00ed\ua789io ==== Kanieht\u00ed\ua789io (; \"Gah- yet-ZEE-oh\", shortened to Ziio/\"Zee-oh\", voiced by Kaniehtiio Horn) (1731\u20131760), or Ziio (informally), was a Kanien'keha:ka (Mohawk) clan woman and the mother of Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton, and an ancestor to Desmond Miles. Kanieht\u00ed\ua789io (1731\u20131760), colloquially known as Ziio, was a Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka warrior from the village of Kanatahs\u00e9ton. Unlike her fellow villagers, who preferred to stay neutral to protect their sacred sanctuary, she sought to fight the British encroaching on her people's lands. She gained an ally in the Templar Haytham Kenway, who sought access to the sanctuary. The two shared a brief relationship, which resulted in the conception and birth of a son whom she named Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton. When her son was four, she died during an attack on the village ordered by George Washington; Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton grew up believing Haytham's subordinate Charles Lee was responsible, setting him on the path to join the Assassins. ==== Oi\u00e1\ua789ner ==== Oi\u00e1\ua789ner was the Clan Mother of the Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka village of Kanatahs\u00e9ton. She and the other Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka in the village served as protectors of the sacred ground on which both their village and the Grand Temple stood. Oi\u00e1\ua789ner was also the keeper of the tribe's \"Crystal Ball\" (Piece of Eden). In 1769, Oi\u00e1\ua789ner showed their Crystal Ball to Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton upon his return from a hunt and allowed him to interact with it. The Crystal Ball forced him into the Nexus, where he communicated with Juno and learned of his destiny with the Assassins. Many years later, the Clan Mother met with an adult Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton and told him of the whereabouts of Kanen\u02bct\u00f3\ua789kon and other Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka men, who were attempting to attack the Continental soldiers. Sometime following Kanen\u02bct\u00f3\ua789kon's death, Oi\u00e1\ua789ner spoke with Ratonhnak\u00e9:ton once more, where she revealed to him that she planned to move their people west to avoid the American Revolutionary War, like many of the other nations had been doing. After his unpleasant reaction, she told him that she would do what was best for her people, to which Ratonhnak\u00e9:ton left the village. On his return some years later, he found the village deserted save for an old vagabond, who told him that his people had already gone. ==== Reginald Birch ==== Reginald Birch (voiced by Gideon Emery) (1705\u20131757) was the Grand Master of the British Rite of the Templar Order, and a successful English businessman. He began his dealings at a young age, and by the time he had reached his mid-twenties, Birch owned several merchant ships; mainly involved with the dealing of tea to the British American colonies. Later on in his life, Birch would progress to own several businesses around London. Birch met Haytham Kenway, the son of Birch's employer\u2014the Assassin Edward Kenway\u2014at a young age. He recruited Haytham into the Templars after the death of Edward Kenway, personally involving himself with the boy's training. In 1754, after Haytham had retrieved the key to the undisclosed Grand Temple, Birch secured passage to Boston for Haytham to find the First Civilization storehouse and establish a permanent Templar presence in British America. Once Haytham had discovered the truth of Birch's involvement in the kidnapping of his half- sister, Jennifer Scott, and the murder of his father, the Templar stormed Birch's chateau with Jim Logan and Jennifer. Following this, Birch was killed by Jennifer, via a sword that Haytham had embedded into Birch's bedroom door (killing the guard on the other side) prior to a struggle between Reginald and the woman. ==== Samuel Smythe ==== Samuel Smythe captained the Providence during Haytham's journey across the Atlantic Ocean. ==== Robert Faulkner ==== Robert Faulkner (voiced by Kevin McNally) (1715\u2013unknown) was an elderly sailor, and Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton's first mate aboard the Aquila. Although he was the fourth generation in his family to become a sailor, he was first to be recruited into the Assassin Order. Born in 1715, Robert Faulkner is probably the most storied members of the Assassin's navy\u2014though he was never formally named to a position above First Mate. Robert Faulkner was the fourth generation of his family to be a seaman\u2014but the first in his family to be recruited to work for the Assassins. He started off in the Royal Navy, but finding his career stalled (partly due to his inability to purchase commissions), he left to work for the United Company of Merchants. In 1753, Faulkner disappears from the historical record, presumed dead\u2014but that's because he joined the Assassins, as first mate of the flagship, the Aquila. Faulkner was much sought after as a mariner\u2014recruiting him was quite a coup for the Brotherhood. He had a reputation for having a disciplined crew and an almost uncanny knack for avoiding trouble\u2014not to mention predicting the weather. Whether through years of experience, or some other more mysterious ability Faulkner would know when a storm patch of sea was coming in, and could use it to his advantage. Imagine that! A natural weatherman who could accurately predict the weather! The world would never see his like again. Faulkner served on board the Aquila until it was nearly destroyed in 1768, always deferring when asked to become the captain\u2014he never gave his reasons why. However, his love for the ship was quite touching\u2014he had it towed to its location near Boston, despite doubts that it would ever be seaworthy again. Faulkner could have gone back to the sea aboard another ship, but didn't\u2014he stayed close to the ever-deteriorating Aquila and took to drinking, which is where Connor found him. ==== Silas Thatcher ==== Silas Thatcher (1720\u20131754) was a high-ranking officer of the British Army, and was a prolific slave trader. Silas was responsible for the ransacking of Benjamin Church's house, and his subsequent interrogation, alongside a man called \"Cutter\". However, shortly after he left, Haytham Kenway and Charles Lee freed their associate, through infiltrating the location Church was kept \u2013 after they determined his whereabouts through eavesdropping \u2013 and the silent assassination of Cutter and two guards. Later, while posted at Southgate Fort in Boston, he would receive deliveries of prisoners from Mohawk people, including Kanieht\u00ed:io. In 1754, one such convoy, full of Mohawk tribespeople, was commandeered by Haytham and his men as a means to enter the fortification. Shortly after, on discovering the ruse, Silas ordered his men to fire on the Templars, but he was cornered by Haytham and executed by Church, as a means of payback for the latter's previous maltreatment. ==== Kahionhat\u00e9nion ==== Kahionhat\u00e9nion was a Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka, born and raised in the village of Kanatahs\u00e9ton, as a warrior and a hunter during the American Revolutionary War. He was also the brother of Teiow\u00ed:sonte. Kahionhat\u00e9nion helped to defend Kanatahs\u00e9ton from an attack by Washington's troops. After the attack, Kahionhat\u00e9nion and his brother, Teiow\u00ed:sonte, recovered Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton from the village, using the powers granted them by the Red Willow. When Teiow\u00ed:sonte was captured by the Bluecoats while trying to free enslaved people from the Frontier, Kahionhat\u00e9nion asked Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton to help him find and save his brother. Despite this, Kahionhat\u00e9nion and his brother were killed in battle when Bluecoats followed Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton's tracks back to the cave that the clan were hiding in. ==== Teiow\u00ed:sonte ==== Teiow\u00ed:sonte (voiced by Andreas Apergis) was a Kanien'keh\u00e1:ka warrior during the American Revolutionary War. He was also the brother of Kahionhat\u00e9nion. Teiow\u00ed:sonte was born and raised in the village of Kanatahs\u00e9ton as a warrior and a hunter. ==== Benjamin Franklin ==== Benjamin Franklin by Joseph Duplessis, 1778 Benjamin Franklin (voiced by Jim Ward) (17 January 1706 \u2013 17 April 1790) was a Freemason, a noted polymath, and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Benjamin wandered around Boston near his store, and was surprised to find Haytham Kenway offer a lending hand, as those living in Boston usually refused to be of any help, and correctly assumed that Kenway was new to Boston. Franklin then charged Kenway with the task of finding stolen pages of his Almanac. Haytham interacted with Franklin, where he proposed his idea of having an older woman as a lover would benefit lives, much to Haytham's amusement. In The Tyranny of King Washington, after gaining control over the area, King Washington put Franklin in charge of running Boston. While under Washington's control, Franklin was still hesitant of the King's decisions, claiming one such order to behead random civilians to be \"rather harsh.\" After being freed from Washington's control by Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton, Franklin sought to help the rebellion take down King Washington. ==== Charles Lee ==== Charles Lee Esq, Americanischer general- major Charles Lee (voiced by Neil Napier) (1732\u20131782) appears in Assassin's Creed III. Charles Lee was a British soldier, and later, a general of the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War who allied himself with the Templar Order and its Grand Master, Haytham Kenway. It is implied that Lee sets fire to Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton's village, killing his mother in the process where the then young Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton' vowed to kill him. Many years later, during a meeting with George Washington, they meet again but failed to recognize him until after he gets falsely arrested for counterfeiting along with a Templar called Thomas Hickey. Sarcastically congratulating him for tracking him down, he frames him for a Templar plot to kill George Washington, but the plan is foiled when Washington is saved by Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton'. Years later, residing in Fort George for his \"own protection\", he is ordered to leave for Boston by Haytham, shortly before the latter's death. Succeeding him as the next Grand Master, he vows to make his tormentor suffer, only to end up being chased by him into a half constructed ferry that's set alight, being saved at the last minute when part of the ship collapses on the Assassin, wounding him in the hip. Using the opportunity to ask him why he continues to, \"fight after all his allies have abandoned him\", he is told that, \"because no one else will\", before being shot in the side by him. Fleeing, he's finally tracked down by his pursuer to a tavern in Monmouth County, where they both share a bottle of whiskey, before being fatally stabbed in the chest by the vengeful Assassin. The medallion (the key meant for Desmond) is taken from his body and, shortly afterwards, is buried in the grave of Connor Davenport, Achilles' son and the namesake of Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton. ==== George Washington ==== Portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart George Washington (voiced by Robin Atkin Downes in Assassin's Creed III and by Tod Fennell in Assassin's Creed Rogue) (1732\u20131799) was the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War from 1775 to 1783, and served as the first President of the United States from 30 April 1789 to 4 March 1797. Born in the colony of Virginia in the British colonies of America, Washington joined the Virginian militia during his youth and participated in the French and Indian War with the British Army, fighting against the French and their indigenous allies. During the war, he ordered the burning of the neutral village of Kanatahs\u00e9ton. Due to the lack of progress of his military career in the British Army, Washington instead turned to politics. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Washington supported the Patriots. Following the creation of the Continental Army, the Continental Congress of 1775 appointed Washington as its Commander-in-Chief. The Assassin Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton, better known as Connor, subsequently protected Washington from the Templar Charles Lee, who was angered that he had been passed over for the position. Though the Continental Army suffered many losses under Washington's command, the aid of Connor and his apprentices managed to gain the army small victories. However, Washington fell out with Connor when the Assassin discovered he was responsible for the attack on his village, Kanatahs\u00e9ton, and signed for a second burning after Lee manipulated Connor's people into siding with the Loyalists. However, the Assassins continued to aid Washington when necessary, such as the investigation of the conspiracy at West Point. After the Continental Army emerged victorious against the British Army in 1781, Washington obtained an Apple of Eden. It gave him a nightmarish vision of what would happen if he were crowned king of the United States with its power in his possession, and so he passed the Apple to Connor for it to be disposed of. This experience strengthened his belief in the Republican Constitution of the United States. ==== John Pitcairn ==== Major John Pitcairn John Pitcairn (voiced by Robert Lawrenson) (1722\u20131775) was a Scottish-born member of the Royal Marine Corps and the Templar Order. He was rescued by Haytham Kenway and Charles Lee while he was being harassed by General Braddock also known as \"The Bulldog\" who was later killed by Haytham Kenway during a horse chase. Assassinated by Connor during a battle between the Patriots and \"Redcoats\". ==== Marquis de Lafayette ==== Portrait of Gilbert Motier, Marquis de La Fayette, as a Lieutenant General, in 1791 by Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Court Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette (voiced by Vince Corazza) (1757\u20131834) often known as simply Lafayette, was a French aristocrat and military officer born in south central France. During the American Revolutionary War, Lafayette served as a Major-General in the Continental Army under George Washington. Blocked by British spies who learned of his support for the Patriots, Lafayette disguised himself as a woman to board a ship to America in 1777. He later recounted this to the Assassin Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton' while camping in Valley Forge that winter. On June 28, 1778, Lafayette led a battalion during the battle of Monmouth, when he was given strange orders by Charles Lee to advance into enemy lines without sufficient numbers. Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton' deduced Lee was trying to make Washington appear incompetent. In 1781, Lafayette visited the Davenport Homestead to help Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton' gather a fleet to breach Fort George in New York. After Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton' gained the French Navy's support, Lafayette met with him and Stephane Chapheau underground and showed them a tunnel into the military district, so Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton' could assassinate Lee in the midst of the bombardment. After the war, Lafayette returned to France and took part in the French Revolution, bringing democracy and radical national reform to France. However, he went into exile because he advocated a constitutional monarchy, instead of the empire that had emerged from the chaos in France. ==== Samuel Adams ==== Portrait of Samuel Adams by John Singleton Copley Samuel Adams (voiced by Mark Lindsay Chapman) (1722\u20131803) was an American statesman, political philosopher, a Sons of Liberty Patriot and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. As a politician in colonial Massachusetts, Samuel was a leader of the movement that became the American Revolution. He was also one of the architects of the principles of American republicanism, which shaped the political culture of the United States. During the American Revolutionary War, Samuel met and became a trusted associate of the Assassin Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton', after Achilles Davenport told Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton' to find him on his first trip to Boston.

During the fight against King Washington's tyranny, Thomas Jefferson was the leader of the New York rebellion. When Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton crashed the Aquila into another ship off the shore of New York City, Washington traveled to the docks to investigate the disturbance. Jefferson seized this opportunity and infiltrated Washington's fortress. He was later quickly overwhelmed and required Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton's assistance in order to retreat. Shaun Hasting claims Jefferson advocated the castration of homosexuals; Jefferson was actually liberalizing the law in Virginia, which previously punished anyone convicted of sodomy with death. ==== Edward Braddock ==== General Edward Braddock Edward Braddock (1695\u20131755), nicknamed the Bulldog by his soldiers, was a member of the Templar Order and a general in the British Army. He appears in Haytham's story in Assassin's Creed III, having participated in the plot to kill his father Edward and then acted as a friend and a mentor in the Dutch Campaign. During the French and Indian War, Braddock was the commander- in-chief for the thirteen colonies of British America. He had several soldiers under his command, including John Pitcairn and Charles Lee, whom he rarely saw due to their allegiance to the Templar cause. Over the course of the war, Braddock turned away from the Templar ideals and impeded the Order's goals in the colonies, much to the chagrin of the other members. This disobedience came to a head when Braddock was confronted by Haytham Kenway, Braddock's former friend and fellow Templar, when Haytham attempted to recruit John Pitcairn for the expedition to find a First Civilization storehouse. Braddock was eventually killed by Haytham, in order to gain the trust of Kanieht\u00ed\ua789io, a Kanien\u02bckeh\u00e1\ua789ka woman who promised to show Haytham the location of the storehouse, in exchange for eliminating Braddock.

During a meeting with several clan leaders, Johnson was assassinated by the Assassin Ratonhnhak\u00e9\ua789ton. ==== Aveline de Grandpr\u00e9 ==== Aveline de Grandpr\u00e9 (1747 \u2013 unknown) was a French- African Assassin who lived in the area of New Orleans, where she battled at the French and Indian War during the Spanish occupation in Louisiana during the middle of the 18th century. She also participated in the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War. She was recruited by the assassins in 1759 in order to defend the slaves, fight for freedom and eradicate templars in New Orleans. She is an ancestor to \"Subject 1\". She appears in Assassin's Creed III: Liberation, Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin's Creed: Initiates. She is voiced by actress Amber Goldfarb. She was the first female protagonist of the franchise. ==== Antonio de Ulloa ==== Almirante Antonio de Ulloa Antonio de Ulloa (1716\u20131795) was a Spanish general, explorer, author, astronomer, colonial administrator and the first Spanish governor of Louisiana. A Templar, he was pursued by the Assassin Aveline de Grandpr\u00e9 during the Louisiana Rebellion, but was spared by Grandpr\u00e9 under the promise to go into exile. ==== Agat\u00e9 ==== Agat\u00e9 (unknown\u20131777) was a former slave who, following his escape from jail, became Mentor of the New France Assassin Order in the colonial French Louisiana. He appears in Assassin's Creed III: Liberation. He was the Mentor of the Assassin Brotherhood in Louisiana, operating from his hideout in the Louisiana Bayou. Enslaved from a young age, Agat\u00e9 came into contact with revolutionary disruptor Fran\u00e7ois Mackandal, who taught him the ways of the Assassins. Following the death of his Mentor in 1758, Agat\u00e9 traveled to Louisiana, a marked man, and hid in the bayou. Agat\u00e9 subsequently established the local Assassin guild, recruiting Aveline de Grandpr\u00e9 and G\u00e9rald Blanc, whom he trained to be his agents in New Orleans. After the Templars' presence in the bayou notably increased in 1766, Agat\u00e9 went further into hiding, constructing a hidout deep within the swamp. Although Agat\u00e9 cared for his students, he was quite secretive in his dealings with them. Due to Aveline's natural impulsiveness and disinclination to follow orders, Agat\u00e9 clashed with her frequently and eventually began to doubt her loyalty to the cause. Over the years, their mutual distrust of each another caused the two to grow apart. When Aveline returned to Agat\u00e9 in 1777 to tell him that Louisiana's head Templar had been her own stepmother all along, Agat\u00e9 attacked Aveline, believing her to have betrayed the Assassins. His student managed to prove victorious, however, causing Agat\u00e9, who was overwhelmed with humiliation, to leap to his death from the top of his treehouse. ==== Baptiste ==== Baptiste was a former Assassin and voodoo leader, who posed as the deceased Fran\u00e7ois Mackandal and operated in the Bayou surrounding New Orleans.

He was also a personal enemy of the Mentor of the Louisianan Assassins, Agat\u00e9. Sometime in 1765, \"Mackandal\" had amassed a small following, though he sent a letter to one of his acolytes stating that he was \"in want of nothing but more men to join his ranks\" of his cult for a \"sacred ceremony\" on the Eve of Saint John. However, this letter was intercepted by the Assassin Aveline de Grandpr\u00e9, shortly after she had assassinated the troops at one of his bases, a wrecked ship in the marshlands, with the smuggler \u00c9lise Lafleur providing her with the information and transport to get there. Aveline and \u00c9lise then located Baptiste after she had cleared the man's second base, and spied on his conversation with de Ferrer. There, she learned of his aspirations to poison the nobles of New Orleans, before Aveline faced off against Baptiste in a showdown, proving victorious despite having been afflicted by a hallucinogenic drug by the voodoo leader; she had ingested an antidote beforehand in preparation to face him. He is portrayed by Michael K. Williams in the Assassin's Creed film. ==== G\u00e9rald Blanc ==== G\u00e9rald Blanc was an accountant living in New Orleans during the end of the French and Indian War. At some point in his life, he became an associate of the Assassin Aveline de Grandpr\u00e9. Later, he came to consider himself as an Assassin even if he lacked the physical training, referring to the Brotherhood as \"our Order\" when talking with Aveline. ==== George Davidson ==== George Davidson (1752\u20131777) was a slave, whom the Assassin Aveline de Grandpr\u00e9 helped to escape from New Orleans and confined into the care of the American patriots as asked by her step-mother. Later, when Aveline was sent to New York to meet Connor in order to take down the British Officer of the loyalist Ethiopian regiment of Lord North, who had information on the identity of the \"Company Man\", Aveline shockingly discovered George's allegiance to the Templar Order. George was killed by Aveline, and in his dying breath, he told her that \"the answer has been in her own backyard all along\", prompting the Assassin to understand that the Company Man was her own step-mother, Madeleine de L'Isle. ==== Madeleine de L'Isle ==== Madeleine de L'Isle (1732\u20131777) was the wife of Philippe Olivier de Grandpr\u00e9, the stepmother of Aveline de Grandpr\u00e9. She appears in Assassin's Creed III: Liberation. Under the alias of the \"Company Man\", she was also secretly the supervisor of the Templar activities in the French Louisiana territories. ==== Rafael Joaqu\u00edn de Ferrer ==== Rafael Joaqu\u00edn de Ferrer (1730s\u20131769) was a Spanish Templar working for the \"Company Man\", who ran a camp of seemingly escaped slaves in Chichen Itza, where he was conducting archaeological research in order to find an artifact of the First Civilization, the Prophecy Disk. In 1769, de Ferrer was killed by the Assassin Aveline de Grandpr\u00e9 who had infiltrated his labor camp and found the Piece of Eden he was looking for, which he attempted to take from her. ==== Diego V\u00e1squez ==== Diego V\u00e1squez was the name of a Templar who was assumed to be the Order's \"Company Man\" in the French colonies of North America. He was later killed at a soir\u00e9e by the Assassin Aveline de Grandpr\u00e9, after having been charmed by her in her Lady attire, as part of her search to uncover the true identity of the Company Man. On his death, however, V\u00e1squez revealed to Aveline that she had been misguided, and disclosed that the Company Man which the Assassin sought was a female in reality. This mystery woman was eventually discovered to be Madeleine de L'Isle, though V\u00e1squez perished before he could give out her name. == Helix Player saga == === Characters of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag === ==== Helix Player ==== The research analyst known as the \"Helix Player\" who serves as the modern-day protagonist of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, Assassin's Creed Rogue, Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed Syndicate, also known as \"Noob\", \"Initiate\" and \"Unity\", has remained officially unnamed by Ubisoft since the character's inception, the reasoning by the series' developers being that the Helix Player is intended to be the embodiment of the player themselves in the Assassin's Creed universe, and thus their identity is left ambiguous.IGN \u2014 The Dawn of Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag ==== Edward James Kenway ==== Edward James Kenway (1693\u20131735) was a Welsh-born British privateer-turned-pirate and eventual Master Assassin.

The daughter of a rebel, Jing Lang grew up fighting. As a young woman, she developed a talent for negotiation and a knack for languages, as well as a taste for discovery. She broke ties with her family to marry the son of a Qing dynasty general her father opposed, and served as their military adviser. Ultimately for performing so well, she was granted a diplomatic post. Over the next decade she traveled the world, developing a reputation for brutality that preceded her in most conflicts. Using piracy as a cover for her political activities, she banded with any who might serve her ultimate desire for negotiated order. In the West Indies of 1717, she fell under the interest of a rumored cache of treasure, and feigned a romantic relationship with one-time Assassin, Vance Travers, to gain access to it. Under the suspicion of Jing being a Templar, Vance's brother, Upton, ordered Edward Kenway to have them both killed. Edward shortly assassinated her to collect a Templar key. ==== Josiah Burgess ==== Josiah Burgess (1689\u20131719) was an English pirate based in Nassau.

Eighteenth-century portrait by Sir James Thornhill William Kidd (c. 1645\u201323 May 1701) was a Scottish sailor who was tried and executed for piracy after returning from a voyage to the Indian Ocean. Modern historians deem his piratical reputation unjust, as there is evidence that Kidd acted only as a privateer. Kidd's fame springs largely from the sensational circumstances of his questioning before the English Parliament and the ensuing trial. His actual depredations on the high seas, whether piratical or not, were both less destructive and less lucrative than those of many other contemporary pirates and privateers. In Assassin's Creed III, his treasure maps are a part of side missions: Connor finds a map locating his treasure inside Fort Wolcott. ==== Charles Vane ==== Early-18th-century engraving of Charles Vane Charles Vane was a British pirate captain who sailed with Anne Bonny and Jack Rackham.

Initially a young barmaid at the Old Avery tavern in Nassau, Anne quickly became acquainted with individuals such as \"Calico\" Jack Rackham and Mary Read, the latter initially posing as James Kidd. Launching her own career as a pirate, she, along with Mary and Rackham, raised a small crew and escaped the island in August 1720, intending to execute a series of swift robberies before retiring with enough gold to live off. However, the entire crew was arrested by the British authorities a few months later; Anne and Mary resisted fiercely, but were unable to beat back the guards by themselves. Taken to Kingston for trial, the two women were able to stay their execution by revealing they were pregnant. Anne would eventually escape prison with the help of Edward and Ah Tabai, but Mary perished, her health having deteriorated after giving birth. Following a depression brought on by the death of her own child, Anne joined Edward's crew as his quartermaster aboard the Jackdaw.

She was also one of the founders of the Pirate Republic of Nassau. In order to facilitate her career as a pirate, she posed as James Kidd, an illegitimate son of the late William Kidd. ==== Blackbeard ==== Engraving of Edward Thatch Edward Thatch (voiced by Mark Bonnar) (1680\u20131718) infamously known as Blackbeard, was a pirate captain who sailed the West Indies and the American colonies during the early 18th century, on a ship named the Queen Anne's Revenge.

After her father's death she partially blames Arno as he had not delivered the anonymous warning of the assassination, parting ways on bitter terms. After Arno became an Assassin he found out that the Templar who ordered \u00c9lise's father's murder wanted her dead, too. From that point on Arno tried protecting \u00c9lise the moment they met again. He later continued helping her find Germain, the Templar Sage who wanted to rebuild the Templar Order. During the final confrontation between Arno, \u00c9lise and Germain, \u00c9lise was killed, devastating Arno and leaving a big impact on him for the rest of his life. ==== Fran\u00e7ois de la Serre ==== Fran\u00e7ois de la Serre (1733\u20131789) was the Grand Master of the Parisian Rite of the Templar Order during the late 18th century. He was the father of \u00c9lise de la Serre and adoptive father of Arno Dorian. A supporter of the absolutist monarchy of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, he expelled his lieutenant, Fran\u00e7ois-Thomas Germain, from the Order for his radical ideas of unseating the aristocracy from power and instead giving it to the rising middle class. Germain came to see de la Serre as a complacent Grand Master who had forgotten the Templars' true goals, and had him killed in 1789 as part of a coup within the Order. ==== Pierre Bellec ==== Pierre Bellec (Voiced by Anthony Lemke) (c. 1740\u20131791) was a French-Canadian Master Assassin, and a former colonial soldier, veteran of the Seven Years' War, who was active during the French Revolution. At some point before the French Revolution, Bellec took a seat on the Assassin Council of the French Brotherhood. Arno Victor Dorian was his student. ==== Victor and Hugo ==== Victor and his brother Hugo were two blacksmiths living in Versailles during the late 18th century. The names of Victor and Hugo are a reference to the French poet and novelist Victor Hugo. Hugo mentioned to Arno the reason for his and Victor's imprisonment was stealing a loaf of bread. This is a reference to the main character of Victor Hugo's novel Les Mis\u00e9rables, Jean Valjean, who was imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread ==== Le Roi des Thunes ==== Le Roi des Thunes or The King of Beggars was the self-claimed \"king\" of the Cour des Miracles district. He forced the beggars of the district to pay him tributes, and to do so they had to pretend to be sick so the rich people would pity them. He tried to join the templars under the command of Francois de la Serre, but De la Serre rejected him and le Roi vowed to kill him. He was approached by Charles Gabriel Sivert, and joined the radical faction of the Templar order led by Fran\u00e7ois Germain. He was the one to murder De la Serre during the 1789 coup, and was assassinated by Arno Dorian two years later. ==== Aloys de la Touche ==== Aloys la Touche was the right-hand man and enforcer of Le Roi des Thunes, tasked with collecting the tributes from the beggars and punishing the ones who couldn't pay. He was also a templar under the command of Fran\u00e7ois-Thomas Germain, and after le Roi des Thunes was assassinated by Arno Dorian, la Touche was tasked by the templar Maximilien de Robespierre with leading his Reign of Terror in Versailles. He was assassinated by Arno during an execution mass in 1793. ==== Marie L\u00e9vesque ==== Marie L\u00e9vesque was a wealthy noble and one of Paris' main grain merchants. She was a templar and a supporter of Germain, aiding him in the coup against De la Serre. After Germain took over, she was tasked by him to make the people starve, to make the revolution more violent and brutal. Her plans were discovered by Arno Dorian, who assassinated her during a lavish party in 1792. ==== Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rouille ==== Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rouille was a captain of the Paris military and a templar supporter of Germain. He was a leading figure in the Tenth of August and in the September Massacres, where he was assassinated by Arno Dorian. ==== Olivier ==== Olivier was the butler of Fran\u00e7ois de la Serre, and expressed sincere disdain for De la Serre's adoptive son, Arno Dorian. ==== Jean Lessard ==== Jean Lessard (?\u20131794) was a Sans- culottes leader in Paris who was rejected by Marie Tussaud, and held disgust for her after this. During the revolution, Lessard was bloodthirsty and hungry for revenge against Tussaud, and sent his men to slay her. Tussaud escaped, however, and sent Arno Dorian to eliminate Lessard, and the Assassin successfully carried out the task. ==== Denis Molinier ==== Denis Molinier was a French alchemist and member of the French Templars, tasked with finding Nicolas Flamel's laboratory. Arno Dorian collaborated to find the lab before Molinier, and stole one of the mechanisms which opened Flamel's lab from Molinier. It is unknown what happened to him afterwards, either slain in the Revolution, killed by his superiors for his failure or survived safely. He is based on the real life Denis Molinier, who lived from 1711\u20131777. ==== Marquis de Sade ==== Donatien Alphonse Fran\u00e7ois, Marquis de Sade (Voice by Alex Ivanovici) (2 June 1740 \u2013 2 December 1814), commonly known as the Marquis de Sade, was a French aristocrat, revolutionary politician, philosopher and author famous for his libertine sexuality. He also became the new Roi des Thunes, after the former bearer of the title was assassinated by Arno Dorian in 1791. He had been held prisoner in the Bastille for several years, but was transferred to another prison shortly before angry Parisians stormed the stronghold. Three years later, as Arno and \u00c9lise de la Serre hunted Louis- Michel le Peletier, the pair enlisted de Sade's knowledge of the Parisian politics to track le Peletier's whereabouts. ==== Fran\u00e7ois-Thomais Germain ==== Francois-Thomas Germain (voiced by Julian Casey) (1726\u20131794) was a French silversmith, Sage and Grand Master of the Parisian Rite of the Templar Order during the French Revolution. He appears in Assassin's Creed Unity. After experiencing visions of the First Civilization and reading the Codex Pater Intellectus, he took it upon himself to reform the Order, which he believed had grown corrupt after aligning itself with the aristocracy for centuries. Inspired by Grand Master Jacques de Molay, Germain sought to carry out the \"Great Work\" and create a capitalist society in which the Templars could more easily control the populace. Grand Master Fran\u00e7ois de la Serre regarded his ideas as being too radical, and exiled him from the Order. Germain eventually began turning de la Serre's advisors to his cause, forming a radical faction within the Templar Order. In 1789, he had de la Serre assassinated in the Palace of Versailles, leaving most of the Order under his control. As the French Revolution broke out, Germain and his followers exploited discontent with the monarchy and sought to create as much chaos as possible. In this way, the aristocracy and clergy would be crushed and the populace would fear the idea of rising against the establishment again. The Templars hoarded food and framed the royal family, eventually leading to the execution of King Louis XVI in 1793. Under the Templar Maximilien de Robespierre, the Reign of Terror began, bringing the revolution to a violent and chaotic climax. Along the way, \u00c9lise de la Serre, the daughter of the deceased Grand Master, opposed Germain. She and her lover, the Assassin Arno Dorian, eventually eliminated Germain's followers and tracked him down to the Temple in 1794. After the Grand Master killed \u00c9lise with a Sword of Eden, he himself was killed by Arno. In his final moments, Germain triggered a vision, telling the Assassin that his goals of reforming society and the Templar Order had already succeeded, even if he would not live to see the changes ==== Honore Gabriel Riqueti ==== Portrait of Honor\u00e9-Gabriel Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau, by Joseph Boze (1789) Honore Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau (voiced by Harry Standjofski) (1749\u20131791) better known as simply Mirabeau, was a French statesman, author, the Mentor of the Assassin Council of the French Brotherhood and a leader of the French Revolution during its early stages. A gifted orator, he criticized France's arbitrary justice system and favored a constitutional monarchy built on the model of Great Britain, being a voice of moderation in the National Constituent Assembly. As Mentor of the Council and Brotherhood, Mirabeau sought to establish peace with the Parisian Rite of the Templar Order and its Grand Master, Fran\u00e7ois de la Serre and inducted Arno Dorian into the Brotherhood. After a coup within the Templar Order, he was forced to give up on the truce, until the Grand Master's daughter, \u00c9lise de la Serre, offered to work with the Assassins in 1791. Unlike most of the Council, he was eager to accept this offer. Regarding Mirabeau as a traitor to the Brotherhood, the Assassin Pierre Bellec poisoned him. After his death, it was discovered that Mirabeau had served King Louis XVI as an advisor in exchange for having his debts paid off. Public opinion turned against him, leading to his remains being moved away from the Panth\u00e9on. History views him as a complex man who is not easily understood. Historians disagree on whether he was a great leader who might have prevented the Reign of Terror had he lived longer, a demagogue lacking values or a traitor serving enemies of the revolution. Bellec's decision to murder Mirabeau has also led subsequent Assassins to debate whether or not his attempts to reconcile with the Templars conflicted with the ideals of the Brotherhood. ==== Louis XVI of France ==== Portrait by Antoine- Fran\u00e7ois Callet Louis XVI of France (born Louis Auguste de France, also known as Louis Capet) (1754\u20131793) was King of France and Navarre from 1774 until 1791, after which he was subsequently King of the French from 1791 to 1792, before his deposition and execution during the French Revolution. ==== Maximilien de Robespierre ==== Portrait of Robespierre Maximilien Fran\u00e7ois Marie Isidore de Robespierre (voiced by Bruce Dunmore) (1758\u20131794), often known as simply Maximilien Robespierre or Robespierre, was a French lawyer, politician and member of the Templar Order.

After some of Starrick's lieutenants were killed, Roth proposed a partnership with Jacob's gang, betraying Starrick and helping Jacob's gangsters in freeing the city. The partnership ended shortly after due to Roth's psychopathic behavior, and after he intentionally burned the Alhambra Music Hall during his final act, Jacob stabbed him with his blade. In his final moments, Roth told Jacob that he had carried out the atrocities simply because he wanted and chose to do so. ==== Pearl Attaway ==== Pearl Attaway was the owner of Attaway transport and, like her cousin, Grand Master Crawford Starrick, a member of the British Templars. Attaway was business rivals with Malcolm Millner, another Templar. Starrick initially choose Millner as the man controlling the bus transport, due to tensions with Attaway, but after Attaway collaborated with Jacob Frye, who didn't know that she was a Templar, Starrick gave the reins to Attaway and they both orchestrated Millner's elimination.

By all accounts, he was not very interested in studying, preferring instead to spend his time riding, shooting, and collecting beetles. His time at Christ's College only intensified his obsessive passion for the natural sciences. Darwin's detailed journal of his voyage aboard made him famous in scientific circles. Upon his return, his father helped Darwin invest so that he could function as a self- funded gentleman scientist. Darwin's many successes came at a cost, though, as the man was plagued by various illnesses caused by overwork. Darwin's On the Origin of Species was published in 1859. By the 1870s, the scientific community and much of the general public had accepted evolution as a fact. Darwin was in international celebrity, who is remembered for providing a unified theory of the life sciences that explains the wide diversity of life on this planet. He was honoured with a burial in Westminster Abbey. At some point, he met the Assassins Jacob and Evie Frye. ==== Charles Dickens ==== Charles Dickens between 1867 and 1868 Charles Dickens (1812\u20131870) was an English writer and social critic.

On March 15, 44 BCE, also known as the Ides of March, the Senators planned their strike. A group of Roman Senators, who were also Assassins, led by Brutus and Cassius, stabbed Caesar twenty-three times in the Roman Senate.

Detractors, however, mocked him as \"The Father of Lies\" owing to his penchant for embellishment. Herodotos was born on the island of Samos, off the coast of Anatolia. During the Peloponnesian War, Herodotos accompanied Kassandra on her adventures, documenting her ordeals, but this record would eventually become lost to humanity until 2018, when Layla Hassan found it. ==== King Leonidas ==== Leonidas I (c. 540 BCE \u2013 480 BCE) was a warrior king of the Greek city- state of Sparta, best known for his involvement in the Battle of Thermopylae against the Persian Empire in 480 BCE. Leonidas wielded an Isu spear, which was later passed down to his daughter, and then his granddaughter, the misthios Kassandra. A direct descendant of the Isu, Leonidas possessed a proportionally-higher level of Isu genes than usual; consequently, so did his descendants. ==== Myrrine ==== Myrrine, also known as the Phoenix while in exile, was the wife of Nikolaos, the mother of Kassandra and Alexios, and the daughter of King Leonidas of Sparta. She gave to her eldest child the broken Spear of Leonidas, an Isu artifact and the family heirloom which she had inherited after Leonidas' death. ==== Nikolaos ==== Nikolaos of Sparta, also known as the Wolf of Sparta, was a Spartan general who lived during the 5th century BCE. With Myrrine, the daughter of King Leonidas, he was the father of Alexios and step-father of Kassandra. He was also the adoptive father of Stentor. Because his step-daughter was descended from Leonidas, Nikolaos had high hopes for her to live up to their grandfather's fame and valor. However, a catastrophe befell the family one fateful day when an Oracle prophesied the destruction of Sparta at the hands of Myrrine's children. Following the apparent death of an Elder as a result of Kassandra's actions, she was sentenced to death. Nikolaos reluctantly stood by this sentence and personally attempted to carry it out, only for Kassandra to survive, and, in exile, grew up to become a legendary mercenary. ==== Cult of Kosmos ==== The Cult of Kosmos is a secretive cabal operating throughout and controlling Ancient Greece and the surrounding regions. The Cult also operates in branches compromising several Adepts, with each brand led by an individual dubbed as the Sage. Much like their Egyptian counterparts, the Order of the Ancients, and their future incarnations, the Templar Order, the Cult of Kosmos were not at all polytheistic and had a deistic belief system. They manipulated the Greek world to maintain their power and wealth. According to Aspasia, the Cult's leader, the nations in Greece were already chaotic and the Cult wanted to use a controlled war so as to create a clean state on which to establish an orderly and unified Greek Nation under their rule. Aspasia was born into the Cult and saw the corruption that had taken hold. She rose through its ranks and accelerated the Cult's plans in such a way that it became more visible; this, in turn, meant that the misthios would learn of its existence and destroy it. With the Cult gone, the Greek world could unite as one nation, one where there would be no more violence and the people could move towards a more rational and developing society, which would be built by the people for the people. The misthios may kill or spare Aspasia when she admits her role in the Cult. Some members of the Cult did however idolize and worship the people within the Bloodline, truly believing them to be actual demigods, such as Deimos. The members of the Cult had soon grown chaotic and greedy and used the Chaos to earn massive amounts of profit and political power. === Characters of Assassin's Creed Valhalla === ==== Eivor ==== Eivor (voiced by Magnus Bruun as a male character and by Cecilie Stenspil as a female) is a Viking raider living in Norway in 873 AD. They lead a group of Vikings to settle in England where they come into conflict with the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Over the course of their journey, they meet the Hidden Ones and join the fight against the Order of Ancients. == Other media == === Characters of Assassin's Creed (film) === Following the cancellation of the sequel to Assassin's Creed, its narrative strands were continued in Assassin's Creed: Origins and the Layla Hassan saga as a whole, with the inclusion of Marion Cotillard as Dr. Sofia Rikkin, a character originating from the film, the film itself having continued the story arcs of Arno Victor Dorian and Baptiste of Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed III: Liberation respectively. ==== Callum Lynch ==== Callum Lynch (portrayed by Michael Fassbender) (b. 1979) is a descendant of Aguilar de Nerha, a Spanish Assassin. After being rescued from his own execution by Abstergo, he is placed in the Animus to relive the memories of his ancestor Aguilar de Nerha and find the Apple of Eden. After reconciling with his father, who murdered his mother to keep her out of Templar hands, he joins the Assassin Order, retrieves the Apple, and kills Alan Rikkin. ==== Aguilar de Nerha ==== Aguilar de Nerha (portrayed by Michael Fassbender) was a Spanish Assassin and ancestor to Callum Lynch. During the Spanish Inquisition, he attempted to protect the son of Sultan Muhammad XII of Granada, an ally of the Assassins who possessed an Apple of Eden. He eventually managed to escape with the Apple and passed it on to Christopher Columbus for protection. ==== Alan Rikkin ==== Alan Rikkin (1951\u20132016) was the CEO of Abstergo. He had sent several e-mails to Warren Vidic, one of which that details several Pieces of Eden that they believe to be nothing more than mythical tales, including the Holy Grail. Rikkin is possibly one of the three men standing in the conference room right after Desmond Miles finished the Alta\u00efr project. He appears in the Assassin's Creed film, where he seeks the Apple of Eden through the memories of Aguilar de Nerha. He eventually discovers the Apple in the tomb of Christopher Columbus and attempts to perform a ritual to remove human free will, but he is assassinated by de Nerha's descendant Callum Lynch, who recovers the Apple. Alan Rikkin is portrayed by Jeremy Irons. ==== Sofia Rikkin ==== Sofia Rikkin (portrayed by Marion Cotillard) (1980\u2013unknown) is a scientist and the head of the Abstergo Foundation Rehabilitation Center in Madrid. She is also the daughter of Alan Rikkin, the former CEO of Abstergo Industries and part of the Templar Order's Inner Sanctum, with whom she had a difficult relationship. In October 2016, Sofia came into contact with Callum Lynch, a criminal whose Assassin ancestry was of interest to the company. During their time together the pair formed a connection but when Lynch's escape from the Foundation led to the death of Alan Rikkin at his hand, Sofia dedicated herself to chasing down her father's killer. ==== Maria ==== Maria (portrayed by Ariane Labed) (unknown\u20131492) was a member of the Spanish Brotherhood of Assassins during the 15th century, as well as a close ally of Master Assassin Aguilar de Nerha. In 1492, she and her fellow Assassins sought to prevent Prince Ahmed of Granada from being captured by the Templars, fearing that his father, Sultan Muhammad XII of Granada, would relinquish the Apple of Eden in his possession in exchange for his son's safety. Alicia Vikander was originally considered for the role of Maria, but scheduling conflicts with Jason Bourne eventually caused the actress to drop out, with Ariane Labed being cast instead. ==== Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada ==== Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada (1420\u20131498) was a Spanish Dominican friar, the first Inquisitor General of Spain, confessor to Isabella I of Castile, and a Master Templar of the Spanish Rite of the Templar Order. Under influence of Rodrigo Borgia, Grand Master of the Italian Templars and Papal candidate, Torquemada opposed the Spanish Assassin Brotherhood, persecuting them as part of the Spanish Inquisition. Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada is portrayed by Javier Guti\u00e9rrez. ==Fictional characters in the Assassin's Creed series== ===Postclassical History (500\u20131500)=== ====Mongolia, Mongol Empire==== *Qulan Gal was a member of the Mongolian Assassin Brotherhood, operating mainly in Mongolia. He was a renowned bowman, a skill which he was later hailed for by the Order. During the early 13th century, the conqueror Genghis Khan caused turmoil in Mongolia, quickly overtaking land, suspected with the usage of a Piece of Eden. As a result of Genghis Khan's tyranny, Qulan Gal swore to stand against him. Qulan Gal was one of the Order's most renowned Assassins due to his vital role in the assassination of Genghis Khan alongside Darim Ibn-La\u02bcAhad, the eldest son of Alta\u00efr Ibn-La\u02bcAhad. At some point during 1217 and 1227, Qulan Gal came into contact with the Mentor of the Levantine Assassins, Alta\u00efr Ibn-La\u02bcAhad, his wife Maria Thorpe and his son Darim Ibn-La\u02bcAhad. In 1227, the four of them devised a plan to assassinate Genghis Khan in his camp near Xing-ging in Xu Province. While Qulan Gal and Alta\u00efr went into the camp together, Darim covered them from a distance with his bow. However, Alta\u00efr allowed himself to be seen and was attacked by a Mongol soldier, though Qulan Gal killed the Mongol before he could raise the alarm. Qulan Gal safely escorted Alta\u00efr out of the camp and proceeded to make another plan with Darim. Qulan Gal and Darim then devised a plan to flush Khan out of his tent, and the latter did so after realizing the danger. Qulan Gal acted quickly and shot Khan's horse, causing him to fall off, killing him on impact. Darim shot the conqueror with his crossbow for assurance. Qulan Gal's role in the assassination of Genghis Khan, allowing the Assassin Order to spread its influence, earned Qulan Gal great praise, and a statue of Qulan Gal was built in the sanctuary underneath the Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni, Italy. By the time of the Renaissance, Qulan Gal's sarcophagus was moved to the Rocca di Ravaldino in Forl\u00ec, Italy. ===Ancient History (3600 BC \u2013 500 AD)=== ====Persia, Achaemenid Empire==== *Darius, born Artabanus, was a member of the Persian elite within the Achaemenid Empire and an antecedent to the Assassin Brotherhood. In the 5th century BCE, the Order of the Ancients, and antecedent to the Templars, supported the reigns and conquests of the Achaemenid kings Darius I and his son Xerxes I. Using a newly created weapon, named the hidden blade, which would later become the Assassins' iconic signature weapon, Darius personally assassinated King Xerxes I. This was the first known usage of the hidden blade. By the Renaissance, Darius' remains were transferred to the Santa Maria Novella in Florence, Italy, where his body lay with an Assassin Seal needed to get access to the armor of Alta\u00efr Ibn-La\u02bcAhad hidden inside the sanctuary in Monteriggioni. In 1478, his tomb was explored and sarcophagus was opened by Ezio Auditore da Firenze, who took the Seal and later obtained the armor of Alta\u00efr Ibn-La\u02bcAhad. In Assassin's Creed Odyssey's DLC, Legacy of the First Blade, Darius makes his first appearance. Darius becomes a grandfather, when his son, Natakas, and central protagonist Kassandra, have Elpidios. ====Babylon, Argead dynasty==== *Iltani was a female member of the Babylonian Order of Assassins during the Argead dynasty. During her lifetime, Alexander III of Macedon conquered most of South-West Asia by using a Piece of Eden. Some time prior to 10 or 11 June 323 BC, Iltani had poisoned Alexander the Great, who died as a result on 10 or 11 June 323 BC. By the time of the Renaissance, Iltani's sarcophagus was moved to Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence. Fellow Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze explored her tomb and took the seal from her sarcophagus, which helped him to acquire the armor of Alta\u00efr Ibn-La\u02bcAhad. In the year 2000, a statue of Iltani stood in the office of the Assassin Order's Mentor in Dubai. ====China, Q\u00edn Dynasty==== *Wei Yu was a member of the Chinese Order of Assassins during the imperial Q\u00edn Dynasty of China, which was ruled by Emperor Qin Shi Huang, a Templar-backed tyrant who oppressed the people of China. In order to protect the people, the Assassins resolved that the land had to be freed from the Emperor's oppressive control. On September 10, 210 BC, during one of the Emperor's Eastern China tours, Wei Yu struck the Emperor with his spear, killing him. By the time of the Renaissance, W\u00e9i Y\u00f9's sarcophagus was moved to San Gimignano, Italy, on the top floor of the Torre Grossa. Fellow Assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze would later explore his tomb and take the hidden seal from inside the sarcophagus, which would help him to obtain Alta\u00efr Ibn-La\u02bcAhad's armor. ====Roman Empire, Julio-Claudian dynasty==== *Leonius was a male member of the Roman Empire Order of Assassins during Italy's Julio-Claudian dynasty. The Assassins considered the Emperor, Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus's, commonly referred to as Caligula, a tyrant and the land had to be freed of him. On 24 January, 41 A.D. Leonius stabbed Caligula, killing him. Between the time of his death and the Renaissance, Leonius' sarcophagus was moved to Venice, Italy, beneath Santa Maria della Visitazione, Venice. *Aquilus (unknown-259) was a Gallo-Roman member of the Assassin Brotherhood in Lugdunum, France, and a distant ancestor to Desmond Miles. He appears in the French comic, Assassin's Creed. In 259, Aquilus was tasked with the assassination of several high-ranked individuals within the Roman Empire. Having failed to assassinate his third target, General Gracchus, Aquilus met up with his cousin Accipiter\u2014an Aleman and a fellow Assassin\u2014from whom he obtained an ancient artifact known as the \"Ankh\", formerly held by the Egyptian goddess Isis. After his father was murdered and the Ankh was stolen by the Roman Senator Ca\u00efus Fulvus Vultur, Aquilus traveled from Lugdunum to the Empire's capital of Rome, seeking vengeance. Successful in his objective, he returned home with the artifact, discovering more of its abilities. Eventually, Aquilus was executed by Roman soldiers. ===Pre-Recorded History=== ====Isu==== *Minerva (voiced by Margaret Easley), also known as both Merva and Mera, is a member of the Isu, otherwise known as the \"First Civilization\", introduced in Assassin's Creed II. She was a member of the First Civilization's ruling body, the Capitoline Triad, along with Tinia and Juno. Minerva appears to Ezio, and by extension, Desmond, in the Vatican Vault. Knowing that Desmond will eventually relive Ezio's memories, Minerva essentially uses him as a conduit. She explains that her kind are not gods, but a more advanced civilization whose technology was mistaken for magic. They engineered humans as slaves, but they rebelled. Minerva describes how war with humanity, combined with a devastating cataclysmic event, led to the downfall of their civilization and the extinction of their race. Correctly predicting that a second cataclysmic event would eventually occur, the Triad hid away the tools humanity would need to survive in several vaults throughout the world, and devised a system by which they could communicate across time before they eventually died. She instructs Desmond to find the vaults, then disappears, leaving a confused Ezio in her wake. In Assassin's Creed III, she projects herself through the past one last time and finds Desmond in the Vault. Once there, she warns him about Juno's power-hungry ambitions, hoping that he will decide not to save the world and keep Juno imprisoned. Juno turns the tables and forces Minerva to reveal Desmond's destiny and how his legacy will be manipulated if he allows the cataclysm to happen. During the conversation, Minerva displays a respect of human free will, not unlike the Assassins themselves. *Juno (voiced by Nadia Verrucci), alternately known as Uni, was a member of the Capitoline Triad. She is introduced in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, reiterating Minerva's warning to Desmond, but is more hostile and contemptuous of humanity (displaying a mindset similar to that of the Templars) than the other two members of the Triad. After Desmond recovers an Apple of Eden hidden by Ezio in the Roman Colosseum, Juno takes control of Desmond, forcing him to kill Lucy, and instructs him to find \"the one who would accompany you through the gate.\" In Assassins Creed III, after the player kills Warren Vidic and Daniel Cross, she takes the place of the modern-day main antagonist. It is revealed at the end of Assassin's Creed III that Juno sought to conquer the rejuvenating world. When she tried to use Minerva's technology for her own ends, she was found and imprisoned in the Vault, with the other two members of the Triad hoping that she would fade away in time for the devices there to be activated safely. But she endured and confronted Desmond along with Minerva when the time came to use the device. Juno spurs Minerva into showing the inevitable future if Desmond does not activate the device: humanity will start out well, but will simply sink back into their old ways and repeat the cycle all over again. Desmond decides to use the device, preventing the apocalypse, even though this would release Juno and cost him his life. Juno is released, and thanks Desmond's body before leaving her prison. She reappears later in Assassin's Creed Syndicate, where she has created a rogue faction of Templars who are loyal to her and are trying to find a way to restore her physical form, even if it means directly undermining their own organization. Juno was finally killed by Charlotte de la Cruz after having a physical form. *Jupiter (voiced by Peter Renaday), also known as Tinia, was a member of the Capitoline Triad. He appears to Desmond in Assassin's Creed: Revelations, during the Nexus of Time. He elaborates more on the creation of the vaults, and shows the location of the central vault that contains all their accumulated knowledge. Although the humans tend to use his Roman name, Minerva consistently refers to him by his Etruscan name, Tinia. *Aita was Juno's husband, who volunteered to be a test subject for one of the Capitoline Triad's attempts to preserve the First Civilization. The experiment that he took part in is left vague, but Juno suggests that it preserved his body at the cost of his mind. Juno euthanized him when his mind \"became brittle\", and it may be this event that caused her to turn on Minerva and Jupiter. Via his reincarnations, Bartholomew Roberts and John, he appears in Black Flag. Roberts is killed by Edward while John commits suicide by forcing Abstergo security to shoot him, his body is then taken by Abstergo to use in the mysterious Phoenix Project. Aita is subsequently reborn as the Sage in the form of Jacques de Molay and Fran\u00e7ois- Thomas Germain in Assassin's Creed Unity and an unnamed German spymaster working in London during the events of Assassin's Creed Syndicate. As Germain, he attempts to purge the Templar Order of complacency and restore its original purpose; as the German spymaster, his objectives are unknown, but as he is assassinated by Lydia Frye relatively quickly, it is noted that he was a particularly ineffective Sage. In the role of the Sage, Aita is closely tied to the Instruments of the First Will, a cult worshipping Juno that believes humanity should be subservient to the Precursor race. Aita is the Etruscan name for Hades and Pluto. *Aletheia was a sympathizer to the humans. She criticized her fellow Isu for their treatment of their \"useful apes\". She also revealed her disdain for their artifacts made to control the human populace. Trying to convince other Isu to join her cause, she praised the humans' achievements, among which includes the development of democracy and diplomacy. She implored the others to stop cowering and then renounced her position, not wanting to \"be part of [their] exploitation\" anymore. Before her death, she digitised her consciousness into the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus, wielded by the Isu known as Hermes, so that she could one day commune with Layla Hassan in the present. ==References== == Bibliography == * * * * Assassins Creed Assassins Creed Assassin's Creed ",
