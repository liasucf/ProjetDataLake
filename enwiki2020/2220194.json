    "text": "The following is a list of terms used to describe disabilities or people with disabilities which are considered negative or offensive by people with or without disabilities. Some folks consider it best to use person-first language, for example \"a person with a disability\" rather than \"a disabled person.\" However identity-first language, as in \"autistic person\" or \"Deaf person\", is preferred by many people and organizations. There is disagreement as to what causes harm.Views vary with geography and culture, over time, and among individuals. Many terms that some people view as harmful are not viewed as hurtful by others, and even where some people are hurt by certain terms, others may be hurt by the replacement of such terms with what they consider to be euphemisms (e.g., \"differently abled\" or \"special needs\"). Some people believe that terms should be avoided if they might hurt people; others hold the listener responsible for misinterpreting terms used with non-intended to be harmful intent. For some terms, the grammar structure of their use determine if they are harmful. The person-first stance advocates for saying \"people with disabilities\" instead of \"the disabled\" or \"a person who is deaf\" instead of \"a deaf person\". However, some advocate against this, saying it reflects a medical model of disability whereas \"disabled person\" is more appropriate and reflects the social model of disability. On the other hand, there is also a grammar structure called identity-first language that construes disability as a function of social and political experiences occurring within a world designed largely for nondisabled people. ==A== *Able- bodied, there is an implied value judgement comparing a person with a disability verses one without *Abnormal *Addict, use person with a drug problem or person with a substance use disorder instead *Afflicted *Attention- seeking, commonly used to label someone who is suffering emotionally *Autism or autistic, when used as an insult. ==B== *Batty *Birth defect *Blind, especially when used metaphorically (e.g., \"blind to criticism\") or preceded by \"the\".
