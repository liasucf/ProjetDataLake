    "text": "The 24 solar terms A solar term is any of twenty-four (24) periods in traditional East Asian lunisolar calendars that matches a particular astronomical event or signifies some natural phenomenon. The points are spaced 15\u00b0 apart along the eclipticUntil 1644(Chinese Empire and its tributary states) or 1844(Japan) a period of time of the solar year itself had been equally divided instead of the spatial zodiac. and are used by lunisolar calendars to stay synchronized with the seasons, which is crucial for agrarian societies. The solar terms are also used to calculate intercalary months in East Asian calendars;When a lunar month's end does not reach a midpoint of the solar terms, it is regarded as the last month's intercalary one instead of the true \"next\" month. It is called \u6b72\u4e2d\u958f\u6708\u6cd5 lit.\"midpoint intercalating system\". which month is repeated depends on the position of the sun at the time. According to the Book of Documents, the first determined term was the Winter Solstice, also named Dongzhi by Zhou Gong, while he was trying to locate the geological center of his kingdom, by measuring the length of the sun's shadow on an ancient timekeeper instrument named Tu Gui (\u571f\u572d). Then four terms of seasons were set, which were soon evolved as eight terms; until 104 B. C. in the book Taichu Calendar, the entire twenty-four (24) solar terms were officially included in the Chinese calendar. Because the Sun's speed along the ecliptic varies depending on the Earth-Sun distance, the number of days that it takes the Sun to travel between each pair of solar terms varies slightly throughout the year. Each solar term is divided into three (\u5019 h\u00f2u) (ja), so there are 72 pentads in a year. Each pentad consists of five, rarely six, days, and are mostly named after phenological (biological or botanical) phenomena corresponding to the pentad. Solar terms originated in China, then spread to Korea, Vietnam, and Japan, countries in the East Asian cultural sphere. Although each term was named based on the seasonal changes of climate in North China Plain, peoples living in the different climates still use it with no changes.\u306a\u305c\u305a\u308c\u308b\uff1f \u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u7bc0\u6c17\u3068\u5b63\u7bc0\u611f (Why off-point? -solar terms and our real feeling of the seasons) An example in Japan. It compares the climate of Taiyuan with that of Tokyo and Kyoto. In maritime Japanese islands difference of the seasonal gap length is the main problem. In subtropical or tropical regions including southern China climate difference is more serious. This is exhibited by the fact that traditional Chinese, Hanja, and Kanji characters for most of the solar terms are identical. On December 1, 2016, the Solar Terms were listed as UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage. == List of solar terms == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! style=\"width: 80px;\" | Sun's ecliptic longitude ! style=\"width: 100px;\" | Chinese nameSimplified Chinese characters are shown in parentheses if they differ from the Traditional Chinese characters. ! style=\"width: 100px;\" | Korean nameHangul are shown in parentheses.
