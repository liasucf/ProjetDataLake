To earn money for the battles, David and Elgin deliver for a drug lord named Emerald. They are challenged by Wade, a rich kid from Orange County, for $5,000; after winning another battle, Wade and his best friend Max goad Elgin into setting their battle for that night. Elgin borrows money from his grandmother for the battle. Due to the amount of money on the line, Mr. Rad announces there will be no fighting during the battle and hires a bodyguard. Nevertheless, a fight breaks out after David and Elgin realize their opponent has stolen their dance set, as their crew member Sonny betrayed them to join Wade's team, and are furious to lose for the first time. Crowing over his success, Wade delivers the titular line, \"You're just mad... 'cause tonight you suckaz got served!\" Wade's crew takes over Mr. Rad's club as David and Elgin's crew depart. David and Liyah, Elgin's sister, are falling in love. Vick joins David and Elgin after his crew leaves him, and Elgin gets a call from Emerald for a delivery of drugs. Elgin tries to call David, but Liyah turns off David's phone. Left on his own, Elgin is ambushed by local thugs who take Emerald's money, leaving Elgin hospitalized, in trouble with Emerald, and furious at David. The friends split up and form their own crews, but neither is as good as they were together. Elgin forbids Liyah to see David, ignoring her and David's desire to help him. Rico tells David and Elgin about the \"Big Bounce,\" a $50,000 dance competition purportedly sponsored by MTV, which will provide the winning crew the opportunity to perform in a Lil' Kim video. Elgin sees this as a way to pay back Emerald and his grandmother. Attempts to bring Elgin and David together, particularly by Liyah, are fruitless, as they nearly come to blows. Emerald gives Elgin only a couple of weeks to pay him back, warning that Elgin not to cross him or he \"will never walk, let alone dance again.\" Many crews impress the judges in the Big Bounce qualifying rounds, including Wade's crew. Liyah talks with Mr. Rad about David and Elgin's problems, and he reveals that he has taken care of the situation with Emerald. David's crew are eliminated after two slip-ups, while Elgin's crew makes it to the finals.

The next day, Rico tells Elgin that they should reunite the crew in honor of Lil' Saint. David arrives, asked by Liyah to try to end the feud, but explains that by the rules of the competition, they must complete with their initial crews. David and Elgin still refuse to forgive each other. Elgin's crew, renamed \"The Lil' Saints\", compete at the Big Bounce finals, hosted by Wade Robson and Lil' Kim. The winner is announced, revealing a tie between \"The Lil' Saints\" and \"Wade's Crew\". Both crews refuse a tie, and Lil' Kim is advised by Mr. Rad, who declares a battle competition, \"straight hood\" with no rules, allowing other people to join the battling crews.
