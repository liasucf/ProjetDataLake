    "text": "The Torry Hill Railway is a private miniature railway with the unusual gauge of 9 inches () at Torry Hill near Frinsted in the Borough of Maidstone in Kent, England. It operates only occasionally. == History == The Torry Hill Railway was built in the 1930, as many British narrow gauge estate railways. It is maintained and occasionally operated by a group of volunteers. There is still a turntable, a 100 ft (30 m) long tunnel and a viaduct that has been built from realistically scaled miniature bricks. It is owned by the heirs of Sir Robert Leigh-Pemberton, Baron Kingsdown.Tom Moran: Torry Hill Railway: A Narrow-Gauge Relic of the Past. Published on 21 December 2015. Downloaded on 12 April 2017.
