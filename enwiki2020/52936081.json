Influenced by the European modern movement led by Le Corbusier and other architects, Greek architects tried to adapt these principles into Greek practice. However, conservatism was often a hindering factor and usually both classically inspired as well as modernist buildings were built during the same periods. ==Prelude== ===The polykatoik\u00eda (condominium)=== The apartment building built between 1918\u20131919 by Alexandros Metaxas for Petros Giannaros. The term \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03b1 (polykatoikia, literally \"multiresidence\") is used in Greek to denote every apartment building. One of the first, if not the first, apartment buildings in Athens was built in 1918\u20131919 by architect Alexandros Metaxas in an eclectic style for Petros Giannaros on Philellinon and Othonos Streets, adjacently to Syntagma Square. Thanks to the fact that this building was one of the first ones to be built with reinforced concrete, it was unexpectedly, as well as asymmetrically higher than the adjacent ones. This caused a fury and led to two royal decrees, one in 1919 and another one in 1922 that in the end set the height for buildings according to the width of the street they lay on, with a maximum height of 26 metres for wide streets.Sarigiannis 2012\u039c\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 at the Contemporary Momuments Database (\u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u039d\u03b5\u03c9\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u039c\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd).

The changes that took place in Greek society after the defeat of Greece during the Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922, and the ensuing population exchange between Greece and Turkey created different housing needs for the population, revealed how important the construction sector could be for the Greek economy, and influenced, as a result, the legal framework of the polykatoikia. In 1929, two important laws concerning apartment buildings took effect. The law about \"horizontal property\" (\u03bf\u03c1\u03b9\u03b6\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1) made it possible that many different owners own one apartment building, each by owning one or more apartment units. Theoretically, each apartment corresponds to a percentage of the original plot. The most important effect of this law was the practice of \"\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c7\u03ae\" (antiparoch\u00ec, literally \"a supply in exchange\"). With antiparoch\u00ec, the owner of a plot, who can't afford to build an apartment building by himself, makes a contract with a construction company so that the latter will build the apartment building but keep the ownership of as many apartments as the contract states. Although during the interwar period the practice of antiparoch\u00ec was limited, as the construction of most apartment buildings was financed solely by the original owners of the plot, antiparoch\u00ec became the most common method for financing the construction of condominiums (polykatoik\u00eces) from the 1950s onwards.Giacumacatos 2009, pp. 65\u201367. Later in 1929 came into effect the first General Building Regulation. Most importantly, not only did it regulate the height and surface area of the buildings, but it also introduced innovations that their use came to characterize the modern style of the buildings of the era, such as the bay windows, or erkers (\u03ad\u03c1\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1), as they are known in Greek after the German term.\u03a6\u0395\u039a \u0391 155/22.04.1929. ===Conservatism between 1900\u20131930=== Papaleonardou's apartment building, designed in 1925 by Kostas Kitsikis, incorporates Art Deco elements creating thus an eclectic style.

During the first two decades of the 20th century, Greek architecture failed to follow international trends, especially Art Nouveau and, to a lesser extent, Art Deco, or to produce an architectural style with consistent features that could act as a successor to Greek Neoclassicism.Giacumacatos 2009, pp. 11\u201313 As a result, buildings in Athens that can be characterized as 'Art Nouveau' are scarce. The tumultuous changes and poor economic state of the Greek society must be taken into account when studying this period.Giacumacatos 2009, pp. 15\u201317 Most architects of that period that built in Athens were conservative and late in adopting other non-classical European styles, often altering them and mingling them with classical motifs, creating thus an eclectic style.Giacumacatos 2009, pp. 13\u201315 The building of Bank of Greece, designed in 1933 in a conservative simplified classical style. During the last part of this period and under the influence of Anastasios Metaxas's work (1862\u20131937), most public buildings were built in a so-called \"simplified classical\" style (\u03b1\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2), similar to \"stripped classicism\". Such buildings include classical ornamentation albeit in a much lesser degree;Giacumacatos 2009, p. 19 Art Deco ornamentation also becomes much more common. Such buildings, with their imposing fa\u00e7ades, usually emit grandeur and austerity. The most important building of this style is the Bank of Greece on Panepistimiou Street built between 1933\u20131938 by a team of architects led by Nikolaos Zoumpoulidis, Kimon Laskaris, and Konstantinos Papadakis. Although it is relatively lightly decorated, every ornament is classical in style and its fa\u00e7ade is even reminiscent of the Greek parliament, designed in 1834.\u03a4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 at the Contemporary Momuments Database (\u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u039d\u03b5\u03c9\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u039c\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd).

See a photograph of how they used to be when completed. Despite the initial conservatism, modern architecture became much more prominent during the end of the 1920s. Recent graduates of the School of Architecture of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) which was founded in 1917, as well as graduates from other European architectural schools managed to make Modernism much more popular. A very ambitious plan was the construction of many public schools, not only in Athens but in all of Greece, by the Ministry of Education of the 1928\u20131932 Venizelos government. The program was led by architect Nikos Mitsakis (1899\u20131941), a graduate of the NTUA, who, in 1930, was appointed director of the office for the construction of the new schools. The designs of the new schools are based on Le Corbusier's principles, are completely unadorned with large horizontal windows, and are built with abundant and cheap materials such as stonemasonry and reinforced concrete.Giacumacatos 2009, pp. 41\u201343 Some of the most important examples of modern school architecture are Dimitris Pikionis's school under Mount Lycabettus designed in 1931, Kyriakos Panagiotakos's school in Pangrati designed in 1933, and many others. During the fourth congress of CIAM that took place in Athens in 1933, the public schools were much discussed.Giacumacatos 2009, p. 45 During his visit in Athens for the congress, Le Corbusier visited a school designed by Panagiotakos on Liosion Street and wrote \"Compliments de Le Corbusier\" on its wall.Fessas-Emmanouil 2009, p. 215 The cityscape of Athens in the 1930s was formed, though, by the great number of modern private apartment buildings that were built during that decade. Many neighbourhoods of Athens saw a construction spree fuelled by a more powerful middle and upper-middle class that were friendly to modernism and wanted to invest in property, as well as by the increase of population. Such neighbourhoods include Kolonaki, Exarcheia, Kypseli, the area around Amerikis Square, and other central areas. Influenced by Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and Erich Mendelsohn,Giacumacatos 2009, p. 57 as well as more conservative architects such as Michel Roux-Spitz,Filippa Dimitriadi citing Eva Manidaki and Thanasis Demiris in \"\u039f\u03b9 \u00ab\u03c8\u03b7\u03c6\u03b9\u03b4\u03c9\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2\u00bb \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd\", Popaganda.gr, 18 April 2016.

These buildings are characterized by the bay windows which can protrude up to 1.4 metres under the 1929 General Building Regulation, the non- existent or subtle ornamentation such as occasional Art Deco motifs, especially on ironwork, and spacious entry halls. They often have permanent decorative pergolas on the terraces of the top floors. The use of bay windows produces a plasticity effect to the fa\u00e7ades. An example of an apartment building with completely unadorned fa\u00e7ades and many bay windows is the famous Ble Polykatoikia near Exarcheia Square designed in 1932 by Kyriakos Panagiotakos.\"K.

Public buildings were still built according to simplified classicism.Giacumacatos 2009, p. 59 For example, the Municipal Market of Kypseli, which was inaugurated in 1937 by the dictator and was designed by architect Alexandros Metaxas (the two are unrelated), includes a classical cornice and small ionic capitals, despite the fact that it is a special-purpose building.Fessas-Emmanouil 2009, p. 230 Something that also changed significantly the appearance of Athenian buildings was the reduction of the maximum possible protrusion of the bay windows from 1.4 metres to 40 centimetres in 1937. Architect and professor at the NTUA Kostas Kitsikis had lobbied extensively for this change because he thought that builders and owners abused long bay windows in order to build as much surface area as they could, turning Athens into \"a bad copy of German and Dutch cities.\"Frantziskakis 1965, p. 48 Two apartment buildings on Aigyptou Square, near Pedion Areos.

It was designed by Andreas Ploumistos and completed in 1958.Fessas-Emmanouil 2009, p. 143 Despite its conservatism it has nuances of modernism such as its fa\u00e7ade grid. The simplified classicism of the 1930s remained dominant and only slightly changed well into the 1950s. Again, public and other important buildings but this time also apartment buildings were decorated with classically orientated ornaments. Main entrance doors, railings, and lighting sconces were made of richly decorated ironwork. Often, balustrades were used instead of railings. White marble was used extensively, especially in entry halls which were often very spacious and white was the preferred colour of the fa\u00e7ades. However, in contrast with pre- war simplified classicism, the fa\u00e7ades of the newer buildings often included a grid which was formed by balconies and thin vertical columns. Many apartment buildings that were built during that era in Kolonaki and other central upscale neighbourhoods of Athens were designed by architects preferred by the upper-middle class such as Emmanouil Vourekas and Konstantinos Kapsampelis.Giacumacatos 2009, p. 69 ==The modernism of the 1960s== The Air Force Assistance Fund building designed in 1947 by Thoukydidis Valentis. ===The \"rediscovery\" of Modernism=== Fix brewery and was originally twice as long as it is now. Already since 1949, the completion of the Greek Air Force Assistance Fund building on Akadimias Street, which was designed in 1947 by Thoukydidis Valentis, showed the course that most office buildings in central Athens would follow. The building is completely undecorated with a subtly visible concrete frame in the form of a grid, and has many Corbusian principles such as the ground floor pilotis. Valentis had a consistent ideology behind the design principles of office buildings concerning practicality and aesthetics which he later in 1960 wrote down in Architektoniki [Architecture] review.Valentis 1960 Some years later, two young architects, Nikos Valsamakis (born in 1924) and Takis Zenetos (1926\u20131977) also exerted much influence in revitalizing Greek modernism. Their buildings, notably one of Valsamakis's first apartment buildings on Semitelou Street (1951) and Zenetos's Fix brewery on Syngrou Avenue (1957, now partly demolished and renovated houses the National Museum of Contemporary Art), are radically different from their contemporary counterparts. Valsamakis's apartment building on Semitelou Street is devoid of any ornament and has a fa\u00e7ade grid formed by balconies and columns. Moreover, its design is inspired by traditional architecture only in matters of materials, such as the stonemasonry of the ground floor and wooden elements elsewhere, and colouring, such as the contrast between white and bright red.\"Louros apartment building\" at Discovering contemporary architecture in Paris and the Ile-de-France region, London and Athens .

It was designed in 1961 by Dimitris Papazisis and its interior by Takis Zenetos. It has a curtain wall made of I-beams, marble, and glass. Gradually, apart from Le Corbusier's principles such as pilotis and horizontal windows, also post-war International Style came to influence most buildings in Athens. Also, the grid on fa\u00e7ades, especially those of office buildings, became one of the most important fields in design innovation. Departing from Valentis's Corbusian proto-Brutalist accentuated grid made of permanent masonry, glass and aluminium curtain walls started to take over. Valsamakis's office building on Kapnikareas Square (1958) and Dimitris Papazisis's office building on Syntagma Square (1961) were the first buildings in Athens where a full blown curtain wall similar in fashion to those of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was implemented.\u039a\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u0395\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u039a\u03b1\u03c0\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 9 at Domesindex.com database of contemporary Greek architecture.
