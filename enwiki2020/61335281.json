    "text": "is a Japanese professional sumo wrestler from Hy\u014dgo Prefecture. He made his debut in March 2010, and wrestles for Isegahama stable. He reached the top makuuchi division in March 2019 and has a special prize for Fighting Spirit. His highest rank has been Maegashira 3. ==Early life and sumo experience== Shoki was born on the same day and just 15 hours after the Great Hanshin earthquake which hit his local Hy\u014dgo Prefecture. Because of this fact he was often called \"earthquake boy\" as a child by fellow schoolmates. Having been born on such a day he always felt he needed to do something great and unique with his life. In first grade of elementary school he would take up judo. In his third year of grade school his parents would get a divorce and it was decided that he would retain his father surname of Fukuoka, instead of taking his mother's maiden name of Kikui. Because of the divorce he was often closer to his grandfather, who was an avid sumo fan, and passed this on to Shoki. In his fourth year he would attend a local sumo tournament taking second. This would see him join the local sumo club to train. By the time he was in Junior High School he had placed in the best sixteen at the national championship. Shoki was not a very good student and had great attendance issues, skipping over thirty days of school one year even though he would still regularly attend his sumo club practices. With his dislike of school and his club coach having a connection to Isegahama Oyakata he would decide to join Isegahama stable right after junior high at fifteen years old. ==Career== He would make his debut in March 2010 along with the likes of Kagayaki and Takanosho. He initially failed his physical exam as he was merely 167cm tall and weighed 89kg, but would pass after taking the secondary physical exam. He was given the ring name Terutsuyoshi meaning \"a strong light\" by his stablemaster, wishing for him to be a bright light of hope to the survivors of the Kobe earthquake. Despite his small size he would make quick work of the two lowest jonokuchi and jonidan divisions. He would hit his first snag in the sandanme division posting his first make-koshi or losing record. He would spend a year here going back and forth with winning and losing records before making his makushita debut in March 2012. He initially struggled and bounced between sandanme and makushita for a year before becoming a third division mainstay. He would remain this way for three years from January 2013 until November 2016, when a 7-0 y\u016bsh\u014d or tournament championship at makushita 9 earned him automatic promotion to the j\u016bry\u014d division and sekitori status. Making his j\u016bry\u014d debut in January 2017, he would initially struggle, managing just two winning records after a year in j\u016bry\u014d, before a disastrous 4-11 record at j\u016bry\u014d 9 would send him back down to makushita. In January 2018 at makushita 1 he would score 4-3 and manage immediate repromotion back up to j\u016bry\u014d. His second stint in j\u016bry\u014d was far better than his first. After just one make- koshi, on the back of four straight winning records he would get a 8-7 score at J\u016bry\u014d 1 gaining him promotion the top makuuchi division. Like with his other division debuts Terutsuyoshi would struggle, getting two back to back 6-9 records. He was somewhat fortunate to remain in the top division for the July 2019 tournament, but at the bottom maegashira 16 spot in July 2019 he would produce his first top division winning record. He would start out with five straight wins before losing on day six to veteran Sadanoumi. He would then go on another winning streak from day nine to day thirteen. On Day fourteen being a part of the leading group he was given a bout against maegashira 1 Hokutofuji, the only opponent he would face above maegashira 7, which he would lose giving him his third loss. On the final day he would face fellow 11-3 record holder Tomokaze who he would then beat by oshidashi giving him a final record of 12-3. After yokozuna Hakuh\u014d's loss to tournament winner Kakury\u016b, Terutsuyoshi shared runner-up honours with Hakuh\u014d. He was also awarded the Fighting Spirit prize. Speaking to reporters after his final match he said, \"\"I wasn't really thinking about winning the championship, I just thought I should put everything into my sumo.\" Terutsuyoshi has a habit during the pre-match rituals (but only on the final throw) of grabbing a huge handful of purifying salt and flinging it high into the air, reminiscent of former sekiwake Mitoizumi. ==Fighting style== Despite his small size, Terutsuyoshi prefers a direct attacking style, moving forward rather than attempting to sidestep or pull down his opponents. Terutsuyoshi is unusual in that he prefers a maemitsu grip on his opponent's mawashi or belt \u2013 grabbing the front part directly below the stomach area. He is also fond of nage (throwing) techniques and has been known to pull off seldom seen techniques such as nekodamashi. However, most of his wins are by frontal push out or force out. His most common winning kimarite is oshidashi closely followed by yorikiri and shitatenage. ==Career record== ==See also== *List of sumo tournament top division runners-up *Glossary of sumo terms *List of active sumo wrestlers ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Hy\u014dgo Prefecture ",
