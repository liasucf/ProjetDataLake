    "text": "Roxy by Proxy is a live album by Frank Zappa, recorded in December 1973 at The Roxy Theatre in Hollywood, California and released posthumously in March 2014 by The Zappa Family Trust on Zappa Records. ==History== In september 1974, parts of the three shows on December 8, 9 & 10, 1973 at The Roxy Theatre in Hollywood, California were released on the double-LP set Roxy & Elsewhere, along with music recorded a few months later (on May 8, 1974 at the Edinboro State College, Edinboro, Pennsylvania and on May 11, 1974 at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago, Illinois), all of that material being overdubbed and remixed. Roxy by Proxy consists of unreleased material recorded live from the two shows held on December 9 & 10, 1973 at The Roxy Theatre, Hollywood, California. Thereby, Roxy by Proxy presents a material as the audiences in attendance heard it live, a material different from any of that used on the late 1974 release. ==Track listing== All songs produced, composed and realized by Frank Zappa. ==Personnel== ===Musicians=== * Frank Zappa \u2013 lead guitar, vocals, producer * George Duke \u2013 keyboards, synthesizer, vocals * Bruce Fowler \u2013 trombone, dancer * Napoleon Murphy Brock \u2013 flute, tenor saxophone, vocals * Tom Fowler \u2013 bass guitar * Ralph Humphrey \u2013 drums * Chester Thompson \u2013 drums * Ruth Underwood \u2013 percussion == Mixing == * 1987 Digital Re-Mix Engineer - Bob Stone, UMRK March/April * Source: 44.1K 16B 1630 Digital Masters == References == Category:Frank Zappa albums Category:2015 albums Category:Albums published posthumously ",
