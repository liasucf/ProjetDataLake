    "text": "The Art Deco style, which originated in France just before World War I, had an important impact on architecture and design in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s. The most famous examples were the skyscrapers of New York, including the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, and Rockefeller Center in New York City. It combined modern aesthetics, fine craftsmanship and expensive materials, and became the symbol of luxury and modernity. While rarely used in residences, it was frequently used for office buildings, government buildings, train stations, movie theaters, diners and department stores. It also was frequently used in furniture, and in the design of automobiles, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as toasters and radio sets. In the late 1930s, during the Great Depression, it featured prominently in the architecture of the immense public works projects sponsored by the Works Progress Administration and the Public Works Administration, such as the Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam. The style competed throughout the period with the modernist architecture, and came to an abrupt end in 1939 with the beginning of World War II. The style was rediscovered in the 1960s, and many of the original buildings have been restored and are now historical landmarks. ==Architecture== ===Skyscrapers=== File:New York City Chrysler Building 02.jpg|Radiator ornament decoration on the Chrysler Building, New York City (1928) File:Empire State Building by David Shankbone.jpg|The Empire State Building, New York City (1931) File:570 Lexington Avenue2.JPG|Crown of the RCA Victor Building (now the General Electric Building), New York City (1930\u201331) File:Fisherbldgentrancesculpture crop.jpg|Entrance of the Fisher Building, Detroit, Michigan (1928) File:Fisher Building Lobby (4634810509).jpg|Lobby of the Fisher Building, Detroit, Michigan, (1928) File:Cbot-close- night.jpg|Chicago Board of Trade Building, Chicago, Illinois (1930) File:Bryant Park Hotel in NYC IMG 1242.JPG|The American Radiator Building, New York City by Raymond Hood (1924) File:Buffalo City Hall, Buffalo, NY - IMG 3740.JPG|Buffalo City Hall, Buffalo, New York, Dietel, Wade & Jones, 1931 File:Plummer From 14Floor of Gonda BLDG.jpg|Plummer Building, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota (1928) File:LeVeque Tower, Columbus, OH, US crop.jpg|LeVeque Tower, Columbus, Ohio (1924) File:Los Angeles City Hall (color) edit1.jpg|City Hall of Los Angeles, California (1928) The Art Deco style had been born in Paris, but no buildings were permitted in that city which were higher than Notre Dame Cathedral (with the sole exception of the Eiffel Tower). As a result, the United States soon took the lead in building tall buildings. The first skyscrapers had been built in Chicago in the 1880s in the Beaux-Arts or neoclassical style. In the 1920s New York architects used the new Art Deco style to build the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. The Empire State building was the tallest building in the world for forty years. The decoration of the interior and exterior of the skyscrapers was classic Art Deco, with geometric shapes and zigzag patterns. The Chrysler Building, by William Van Alen (1928\u201330), updated the traditional gargoyles on Gothic Cathedrals with sculptures on the building corners in the shape of Chrysler radiator ornaments. Another major landmark of the style was the RCA Victor Building (now the General Electric Building), by John Walter Cross. It was covered from top to bottom with zig-zags and geometric patterns, and had a highly ornamental crown with geometric spires and lightning bolts of stone. The exterior featured bas-relief sculptures by Leo Friedlander and Lee Lawrie, and a mosaic by Barry Faulkner that required more than a million pieces of enamel and glass. While the skyscraper Art Deco style was mostly used for corporate office buildings, it also became popular for government buildings, since all city offices could be contained in one building on a minimal amount of land. The city halls of Los Angeles, California and Buffalo, New York were built in the style, as well as the new capital building of the State of Louisiana. ===Movie theaters=== Following the lead of the skyscrapers of New York City, smaller in scale but no less ambitious in design, Art Deco office buildings and department stores appeared in cities across the United States. They were rarely built by banks, which wanted to appear conservative, but were often built by retail chains, public utilities, automobile companies and technology companies, which wanted to express modernity and progress. Syracuse, New York is home to the Niagara Mohawk Building, in Syracuse, New York, completed in 1932. was originally the home of the nation's largest electricity supplier. The facade, by the firm of Bley and Lyman, was designed to express the power and modernity of electricity; it features a statue called \"The Spirit of Light\" 8.5 meters high, made of stainless steel, as the central element of the facade. The Guardian Building, originally the Union Trust Building, is a rare example of a bank or financial institution using Art Deco. Its interior decoration was so elaborate that it became known as the \"Cathedral of Commerce\". The San Francisco architect Timothy L. Pflueger best known for the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California, was another proponent of lavish Art Deco interiors and facades on office buildings. The interior of his downtown San Francisco office building, 450 Sutter Street, opened in 1929, was entirely covered with hieroglyphic-like designs and ornament, resembling a giant tapestry. ==The Streamline style== ===Hotels, Resorts, and the Miami Beach Style=== File:U-Drop Inn.jpg|The U-Drop Inn, a roadside gas station and diner on U.S. Highway 66 in Shamrock, Texas (1936) File:Modern diner.jpg|The Modern Diner in Pawtucket, Rhode Island (1940) is modeled after streamlined railroad car. Because of its high cost of construction, Art Deco was usually used only in large office buildings, government buildings and theaters, but it was sometimes used in smaller structures, such as diners and gas stations, particularly along highways. A notable example is the U-Drop Inn in Shamrock, Texas, located along U.S. Highway 66. It was built in 1936, and is now owned by the City of Shamrock, and is an historical landmark. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, a number of diners modeled after the cars of streamlined trains were produced, and appeared in different cities in the United States. In a few cases, real railroad cars were transformed into diners. A few survive, including the Modern Diner in Pawtucket, Rhode Island which is a registered landmark. ==Fine Art== ===Murals=== File:The Tragic Prelude John Brown.jpg|Mural \"Tragic Prelude\" depicting abolitionist John Brown in the Kansas State Capitol building, by John Steuart Curry (1930) File:Diego Rivera - Detroit Industry Murals.jpg|Part of \"Detroit Industry\"' mural by Diego Rivera in the Detroit Institute of Arts (1932\u201333) File:Paul Kelpe History of Southern Illinois.jpg|A portion of a mural depicting the History of Southern Illinois, commissioned by the Federal Art Project for the lLibrary of the University of Southern Illinois (1935) File:Coit Mural Agriculture.jpg|A portion of California by Maxine Albro, on the interior of Coit Tower in San Francisco (1934) File:Mural-Ariel-Rios-Marsh-1.jpg|Workers sorting the mail, a mural in the U.S. Customs House in New York by Reginald Marsh (1936) File:Mural-Ariel-Rios-Rockwell-Kent-1.jpg|Mural Art in the Tropics by Rockwell Kent in the William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building (1938) There was no specific Art Deco style of painting in the United States, though paintings were often used as decoration, especially in government buildings and office buildings. In the 1932 the Public Works of Art Project was created to give work to artists unemployed because the Great Depression. In a year, it commissioned more than fifteen thousand works of art. It was succeeded in 1935 by the Federal Arts Project of the Works Progress Administration, or WPA. prominent American artists were commissioned by the Federal Art Project to paint murals in government buildings, hospitals, airports, schools and universities. Some the America's most famous artists, including Grant Wood, Reginald Marsh, Georgia O'Keeffe and Maxine Albro took part in the program. The celebrated Mexican painter Diego Rivera also took part in the program, painting a mural. The paintings were in a variety of styles, including regionalism, social realism, and American scenic painting. A few murals were also commissioned for Art Deco skyscrapers, notably Rockefeller Center in New York. Two murals were commissioned for the lobby, one by John Steuart Curry and another by Diego Rivera. The owners of the building, the Rockefeller family, discovered that Rivera, a Communist, had slipped an image of Lenin into a crowd in the painting, and had it destroyed. The mural was replaced with another by the Spanish artist Jos\u00e9 Maria Sert. ===Sculpture=== The Art Deco style appeared early in the graphic arts, in the years just before World War I. It appeared in Paris in the posters and the costume designs of L\u00e9on Bakst for the Ballets Russes, and in the catalogs of the fashion designers Paul Poiret. The illustrations of Georges Barbier, and Georges Lepape and the images in the fashion magazine La Gazette du bon ton perfectly captured the elegance and sensuality of the style. In the 1920s, the look changed; the fashions stressed were more casual, sportive and daring, with the woman models usually smoking cigarettes. American fashion magazines such as Vogue, Vanity Fair and Harper's Bazaar quickly picked up the new style and popularized it in the United States. It also influenced the work of American book illustrators such as Rockwell Kent. In the 1930s a new genre of posters appeared in the United States during the Great Depression. The Federal Art Project hired American artists to create posters to promote tourism and cultural events. ==See also== * List of Art Deco architecture * List of Art Deco architecture in the United States * Art Deco architecture of New York City ==References== ===Notes and citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * Category:American architectural styles ",
