    "text": "The 1891 Kentucky State College Blue and Yellow football team represented Kentucky State College during the 1891 college football season. The team lost a single match to Centre, the first instance of this rivalry. The 1891 team's colors were blue and light yellow, decided before the Centre\u2013Kentucky game on December 19. A student asked \"What color blue?\" and varsity letterman Richard C. Stoll pulled off his necktie, and held it up. This is still held as the origin of Kentucky's shade of blue. The next year light yellow was dropped and changed to white. ==References== Kentucky State College Category:Kentucky Wildcats football seasons Kentucky State College Blue and Yellow football ",
