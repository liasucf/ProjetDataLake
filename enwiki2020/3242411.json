    "text": "Ray Barbee (born October 5, 1971) is an American skateboarder, photographer, and musician from San Jose, California. He was one of the first skateboarders to bring freestyle/flatland tricks to street, technical ollie combinations and numerous no comply variations. He is best known for his no complys and fluid style. Barbee appeared in the Powell Peralta videos Public Domain and Ban This. Barbee also appears in the video games Skate 2 and Skate 3 as a playable skater. In 1991, Barbee left Powell Peralta for The Firm Skateboards (now defunct), headed by another Powell veteran, Lance Mountain. Barbee has a signature shoe with Vans. His other sponsors are Independent Truck Company, and WeSC. Ray Barbee is also known as a photographer and takes pictures with analog cameras such as a Leica M6. ==Music== A music writer and multi- instrumentalist, Barbee released his debut EP on Galaxia records in 2003, Triumphant Procession, a collection of jazz-influenced instrumental tracks which Barbee produced and engineered in his home studio. His 2005 release, In Full View, also on Galaxia, featured guests appearances by drummers Doug Scharin (of HiM and June of 44) and Carlos de la Garza (formerly of Reel Big Fish) as well as saxophone player Glen Darcey. Barbee plays guitar, bass guitar, drums, harp and xylophone. In March 2007, Barbee recorded in Japan with the Mattson 2. That recording became Ray Barbee Meets The Mattson 2, a collaboration melding the guitar/drums of the Mattson 2 with Ray Barbee playing additional guitar. When playing live together, Ray sometimes assumes a dual bass line/lead role (both on his guitar) during the set. Barbee is also known for his live performance solo work using looping delay pedals and drum machines. His music has been featured on NPR and has been used in a number of surf videos. He is sponsored by Fender Guitars. ==References== ===Sources=== *OP Classic ==External links== *Video: Ray Barbee, Propaganda *Video: Ray Barbee, Ban This *[ Ray Barbee] at Allmusic *SkateboardManiaks, All about Barbee in the Dutch language. *Galaxia Records - Ray Barbee Category:American skateboarders Category:Sportspeople from San Jose, California Category:Living people Category:1971 births Category:African-American skateboarders Category:African-American photographers Category:African-American musicians Category:Skate photographers ",
