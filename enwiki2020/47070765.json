    "text": "The 29th Indian Brigade was an infantry brigade of the British Indian Army that saw active service with the Indian Army during the First World War. Formed in October 1914, it raided Sheik Saiad en route to Egypt, defended the Suez Canal in early 1915, before taking part in the Gallipoli Campaign (April to December 1915). On returning to Egypt it acted as an independent formation being broken up in June 1917. ==History== ;Formation The 29th Indian Brigade was formed in October 1914 as part of Indian Expeditionary Force F (along with the 28th and 30th Indian Brigades) and sent to Egypt. En route to Egypt it raided Sheik Saiad (10\u201311 November). The Ottoman Empire maintained a small fort at Sheik Saiad guarding the entrance to the Red Sea. Having destroyed the Ottoman fortifications, the brigade re-embarked and continued on to Suez. ;10th Indian Division After arriving in Egypt, it joined the 10th Indian Division when it was formed on 24 December. It served on the Suez Canal Defences, notably taking part in the Actions on the Suez Canal on 3\u20134 February 1915. After the defeat of the Turkish attempts to cross the canal, the division was dispersed and the brigade was sent to Gallipoli in April 1915. ;Gallipoli The brigade formed Indian Expeditionary Force G for service in Gallipoli, the only Indian Army formation to serve on the peninsula. From 1 May to 7 July 1915 it was attached to the British 29th Division at Cape Helles. While with the division, it was in reserve for the Second Battle of Krithia (6\u20138 May), but played a more major role at Gurkha Bluff (12 May), the Third Battle of Krithia (4 June) and the Battle of Gully Ravine (28 June\u20132 July). The brigade was switched to ANZAC Cove where it was attached to the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, with which it took part in the Battle of Sari Bair (6\u201321 August 1915). 1st Battalion, 6th Gurkha Rifles was the only unit to reach the top of the ridge and see the Dardanelles; shelled by the Royal Navy, a Turkish counter-attack drove them off. The brigade's involvement at Gallipoli came at a high price: the 14th Sikhs, alone, suffered 264 killed and 840 wounded while serving at Gallipoli. ;Independent On 7 January 1916, the 10th Indian Division was reformed as part of the Suez Canal District, and the brigade joined it. The need to return depleted units that had served in France to India meant that this was short-lived. The division was broken up on 7 March and the brigade became an independent formation. It continued to serve on the Suez Canal Defences. In March 1917, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force started forming the British 75th Division, originally to be made up of Territorial Force battalions arriving from India. In May 1917, to speed up the formation of the division, it was decided to incorporate Indian battalions. To this end, the 29th Indian Brigade was broken up in June 1917 and its battalions posted to 75th Division. ==Orders of battle== {| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:transparent;\" !With 10th Division in Egypt |- |The brigade had the following composition from formation and while assigned to 10th Indian Division in Egypt: * 14th King George's Own Ferozepore Sikhs (joined from 1st (Peshawar) Brigade, 1st (Peshawar) Division) * 69th Punjabis (joined from 5th (Jhelum) Brigade, 2nd (Rawalpindi) Division) * 89th Punjabis (joined from Presidency Brigade, 8th (Lucknow) Division) * 1st Battalion, 6th Gurkha Rifles (joined from 3rd (Abbottabad) Brigade, 2nd (Rawalpindi) Division) |} {| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:transparent;\" !Gallipoli |- |The brigade commanded the following units during the Gallipoli Campaign: * 14th King George's Own Ferozepore Sikhs * 69th Punjabis (transferred in May 1915 to 21st (Bareilly) Brigade, 7th (Meerut) Division) * 89th Punjabis (transferred in May 1915 to 7th (Ferozepore) Brigade, 3rd (Lahore) Division) * 1st Battalion, 6th Gurkha Rifles * 1st Battalion, 5th Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force) (joined in June 1915 from 28th Indian Brigade, 10th Indian Division) * 2nd Battalion, 10th Gurkha Rifles (joined in June 1915 from 22nd (Lucknow) Brigade, 11th Indian Division) * 1st Battalion, 4th Gurkha Rifles (joined in October 1915 from 9th (Sirhind) Brigade, 3rd (Lahore) Division) The 69th and 89th Punjabis served briefly at Gallipoli before departing for the Western Front.
