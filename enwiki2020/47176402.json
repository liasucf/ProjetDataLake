Thomas (6 June 1929 \u2013 27 April 2016), also known as Toms, was a cartoonist from Kerala, India who created the cartoon characters Boban and Molly. ==Early life and career== Toms was born to Vaadakkal Thoppil Kunjuthomman Kunjithomman and Sicily Thomas on 6 June 1929 in Kuttanad of Alappuzha district. He completed his graduation from SB College, Changanassery. Later he joined the army as an electrician and left the job soon. He then devoted his career completely to drawing cartoons. His elder brother Peter Thomas was his inspiration behind drawings. Peter was a cartoonist in Shankar's Weekly at that time. Toms started his career in 1950 through Sathyadeepam, a Catholic weekly and Kerala Kaumudi.

However, on an appeal, the High Court of Kerala ruled that pursuant to the Indian Copyright Act, 1957, while the ownership of the strips drawn during Toms\u2019 employment with Manorama would continue to be with the publication, Toms was free to own the characters Boban and Molly and could continue to create cartoon strips featuring them and publish them at his will. ==Other characters created by Toms== Toms also created other characters which appeared along with Boban and Molly, which all represented various personalities and life style of Keralites. * Vakkeel Pothen * Appy Hippy * Ittunnan * Unnikkuttan * Kunchukuruppu ==Film adaptation== A film Bobanum Moliyum based on the characters was released in 1971 directed by J.
