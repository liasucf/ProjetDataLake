    "text": "Tabitha Bonita Brown (born February 4, 1979) is an American social media personality and actress. In 2020, she gained immense internet popularity with her online video content which often incorporates veganism, humor and motivational speaking. Brown has amassed over four million followers on TikTok and over three million followers on Instagram . She has been described by HuffPost as \"America's Mom\" and her content has been deemed by critics as \"comforting\" and \"calming\". ==Early life and career== === 1979\u20132007: Early years and career beginnings === Brown was born in Eden, North Carolina. She was raised in Stoneville, but grew up and did schooling in Eden. She started studying fashion design at Miami International University of Art & Design, but dropped out at age 19 and moved to Laguna Niguel, California. After struggling financially, she returned to North Carolina, this time moving to Greensboro, where she lived for five years. In Greensboro, she gave birth to her daughter Choyce, her firstborn. In 2002, Brown got a job as the co-host of a local late-night show, where she interviewed celebrities who performed at Greensboro Coliseum Complex. In 2004 she moved with her husband to Los Angeles where she tried out stand-up comedy. After failing to land as a TV actress, Brown spent five years working at a Macy's in Century City. After six months of being settled in, Brown began bouncing between North Carolina and Los Angeles to care for her mother who had developed ALS. === 2008\u20132016: Acting and performance hiatus === Brown had spent three years taking care of her mother. Following her mother's death in 2007, Brown began her career acting small roles in several indie films and direct-to-video films. She gave birth to her son, Queston, in 2012. Brown consequently developed chronic pain and fatigue and could not work for a year. Brown was introduced to veganism after her daughter had suggested adopting it to help with her recovery. === 2017\u2013present: Social media breakthrough === In late 2017, Brown was running out of disability insurance funds, which led to her becoming an Uber driver in October 2017, in order to make ends meet as a \"struggling\" part-time actress. Her video review from December 2017 of a Whole Foods Market vegan BLT sandwich went viral, after which the company hired her as a brand ambassador to travel the country. In early March 2020, she created a TikTok account on which began sharing vegan recipes, cooking tips, family moments, and encouraging advice, amassing 2 million followers in the space of five weeks. Brown had also been broadcasting live cooking shows and product reviews on Facebook live since early 2018. In late April 2020, Brown was signed to Creative Artists Agency. In late June 2020, she was also given her own show, All Love, on Ellen Digital Network, a network operated as subsidiary of Ellen Digital Ventures, a collaborative venture between Ellen DeGeneres and Warner Bros\u2019 Digital Networks. ===Artistry=== Brown told USA Today about why she believes she failed as an actress in her early career: == Personal life == Brown is marriedto Chance Brown, with whom she co-hosts \"Fridays with Tab & Chance\" on IGTV. == Selected filmography == Adapted from IMDb: === Film === As Writer {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
