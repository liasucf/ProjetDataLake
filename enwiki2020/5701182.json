    "text": "Moronic acid (3-oxoolean-18-en-28-oic acid) is a natural triterpene. Moronic acid can be extracted from Rhus javanica, a sumac plant traditionally believed to hold medicinal applications. The molecule has also been extracted from mistletoe (Phoradendron reichenbachianum). Bevirimat, a derivative of the related triterpenoid betulinic acid, is under development as an anti-HIV drug; however, moronic acid has shown better antiviral profiles in vitro than bevirimat. A particular moronic acid derivative showed potent anti-HIV activity with EC50 values of 0.0085 \u03bcM against NL4-3, 0.021 \u03bcM against PI-R (a multiple protease inhibitor resistant strain), and 0.13 \u03bcM against FHR-2 (an HIV strain resistant to (bevirimat). This derivative has become a new lead for clinical trials and is also active against herpes simplex virus 1. ==References== ==External links== * CTD's Moronic acid page from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database * NLM/NIH Medical Subject Heading * KEGG Terpenoid Synthesis Pathway * Molecules with silly names Category:Triterpenes Category:Keto acids ",
