Those marked with * were Area Seventies prior to call as General Authorities. * Current assignments. ===Emeritus=== Emeritus General Authorities are General Authorities who have been released from their positions in the hierarchy. They remain General Authorities until their deaths. All current emeritus General Authorities are former members of the First and Second Quorums of the Seventies or of the Presiding Bishopric. When the first General Authorities were given emeritus status, N. Eldon Tanner of the First Presidency provided the following explanation: > \"The very rapid growth of the Church across the world, with the attendant > increase in travel and responsibility, has made it necessary to consider a > change in the status for some of the Brethren of the General Authorities. > Some of our associates have served for many years with complete and > unselfish dedication, and they deserve every honor and recognition for such > devoted service. It is felt advisable at this time to reduce somewhat the > load of responsibility that they carry. > \"After a long period of prayerful consideration and counsel, extending, > indeed, over several years, we announce a new and specific status to be > given from time to time to Brethren of our associates in the General > Authorities. We announce that some Brethren have been designated as emeritus > members of the First Quorum of the Seventy. These Brethren are not being > released but will be excused from active service. It is out of consideration > for the personal well-being of the individuals, and with deep appreciation > for their devoted service, that this designation will be given from time to > time to designated members of the General Authorities.\"N. Eldon Tanner, > \"Revelation on Priesthood Accepted, Church Officers Sustained\", Ensign, > November 1978, p. 16. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Name ! Called ! Emeritus ! Age !
