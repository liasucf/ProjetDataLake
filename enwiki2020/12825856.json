They have been displaced from these workings by Thalys electric multiple units and were all retired from service by 1999. They were derived from the French SNCF CC 40100 express passenger locomotives. Their multi-voltage capabilities allowed them to work beyond Belgium's borders, mainly Paris - Brussels/Li\u00e8ge and Oostende - Cologne. The locomotives had an aluminum body with dark blue accents. == Status == The dispositions of locomotives in this class are as follows: * 1801 Scrapped in February 2008 at Salzinnes works * 1802 Scrapped in July 2009 at Courcelles-Motte * 1803 Stored at Raeren, moved to Sokolov, Czech Republic in October 2011, scrapped in February 2012 * 1804 Scrapped in July 2009 at Courcelles-Motte * 1805 Preserved by PFT * 1806 Stored at Raeren, moved to Sokolov, Czech Republic in October 2011, scrapped in February 2012 == References == * Locomotives de la s\u00e9rie 18 * The Railfaneurope.net Picture Gallery - Directory: /pix/be/electric/historic/18 * SNCB s\u00e9rie 18 Category:National Railway Company of Belgium locomotives Category:Alstom locomotives Category:1500 V DC locomotives Category:3000 V DC locomotives Category:15 kV AC locomotives Category:25 kV AC locomotives Category:C\u2032C\u2032 locomotives Category:Electric locomotives of Belgium Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1973 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Belgium ",
