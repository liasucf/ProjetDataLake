The railway, known as the South Tynedale Railway, is a 2-foot (0.61 m) gauge line and runs from Alston to a station at Kirkhaugh, and includes a viaduct over the River South Tyne. Efforts are being made to extend the line north to Slaggyford. == Religious sites == The church, rebuilt in 1869, is thought to be the only English church dedicated to the Holy Paraclete (that is, the Holy Spirit).
