Neue Jury. Neuer Style. === Original airdate: This was the casting episode. The top 50 girls were narrowed down to the top 30 after meeting the judges for the first time. The top 30 contestants then had their first live runway show. After the runway concluded, 24 contestants were chosen to advance into the competition. The contestants were divided into two teams of twelve. Half of them would be in Team Michael and the other half in Team Thomas. ===Episode 2: Zwei Teams, zwei Inseln=== Original airdate: Team Michael and team Thomas were divided to two islands - Lanzarote and Fuerteventura. After arriving at their new accommodation, they soon noticed all luxury and glamour was gone. Team Michael did a photo shoot in the dunes, where Fred struggled to deliver. Meanwhile, team Thomas had a group shoot challenge with Toni Garrn. After finishing the photo shoot in the dunes, the girls in team Michael faced a runway challenge featuring Toni. Team Thomas continued on the beach for their first shoot. While the whole group received praise for their results, Heidi called out Saskia and Lara-Kristin as the weakest of the group. At elimination, the unsafe contestants were Fred, Lara-Kristin, Saskia, Sophie and Laura Penelope, who was originally safe from elimination but landed in the bottom for refusing to have her dreadlocks cut, and was given the choice of staying in the competition on the condition that she allow her dreadlocks to be cut, or going home. Out of the unsafe girls from team Michael (Fred and Sophie), Fred was eliminated, and out of those from team Thomas (Lara-Kristin and Saskia), Saskia was sent home, while Laura Penelope decided against her makeover and was also out of the competition. After the airing of the episode, it was revealed by ProSieben that Luisa from team Michael withdrew from the competition for personal reasons before the other members of team Michael travelled to Fuerteventura. Her withdrawal was not shown during the episode.http://www.gala.de/lifestyle/entertainment/tv/germany-s-next-topmodel- diese-kandidatin-ist-heimlich-ausgestiegen_1393812_225783.html *Quit: Luisa Bolghiran *Challenge winner: Shirin Kelly *Bottom five: Fred Riss, Lara- Kristin Bayer, Laura Penelope Baumg\u00e4rtner, Saskia B\u00f6hlcke & Sophie Schweer *Quit: Laura Penelope Baumg\u00e4rtner *Eliminated: Fred Riss & Saskia B\u00f6hlcke *Featured photographer: Matt McCabe *Special guests: Toni Garrn ===Episode 3: Das Sirupshooting === Original airdate: 18 February 2016 After castings in Madrid and Milan, the teams reunited in Los Angeles. *Booked for job: Julia Wulf, Lara Helmer,http://www.gntm-blog.de/gntm-2016/gntm-folge-3-ein-kleiner- tv-skandal/ Shirin Kellyhttp://www.mittelbayerische.de/region/regensburg- land/gemeinden/neutraubling/gntm-aus-fuer-shirin-aus- neutraubling-21395-art1343683.html & Yusra Babekr-Ali *Eliminated: Shirin Kelly & Sophie Schweer *Featured photographer: Blake Little ===Episode 4: Das gro\u00dfe Umstyling === Original airdate: 25 February 2016 The makeovers took place this week, with some girls receiving more drastic changes than others.
