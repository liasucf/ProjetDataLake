    "text": "{| |} The Aircraft Research XBT-11 was to have been a basic trainer constructed by the Aircraft Research Corporation (formerly the Vidal Research Corporation) of Bendix, New Jersey, by molding \"Weldwood\", a \"plastic\" plywood composite material made of heat and pressure-processed phenol phenol- formaldehyde resins and wood similar to the Duramold process. The Duramold and Haskelite processes were first developed in 1937, followed by Eugene L. Vidal's Weldwood in 1938. A production contract, proposed in 1940, was cancelled before any were built.Fahey, James C. US Army Aircraft 1908-1946, 1946. Ships and Aircraft.
