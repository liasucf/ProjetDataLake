    "text": "Head Balloki barrage Head Balloki or Balloki Headworks is a barrage on the Ravi River in the Punjab, Pakistan. It was first built around in 1915 in British India as part of the 'Triple Canals Project' to feed the Lower Bari Doab Canal. The canal turned in a profit of 24% within ten years (in 1928\u201329). The original weir has now been rebuilt as a full barrage. == History == The districts of Punjab prior to partition of India The Triple Canals Project was the second irrigation project that was implemented in Punjab, the first being the Upper Bari Doab Canal (UBDC). The project began in 1905. It constructed three canals: * the Upper Jhelum Canal (UJC) from Mangla * the Upper Chenab Canal (UCC) from Marala * the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) from Balloki. The Upper Chenab Canal was linked to the LBDC because it brought water from Chenab to Ravi, in addition to irrigating lands along the way. This was necessary because, after the extraction for the UBDC, the remaining waters in Ravi were insufficient for the LBDC. Where the Upper Chenab joined the Ravi river from the right, a few miles west of the village of Balloki, the Balloki Barrage was constructed. It was the largest barrage of its kind in India at that time. It had a 1,647-foot-long weir with thirty-five 12-metre-wide steel gates for regulating the water of Ravi. The Lower Bari Doab Canal branched off on the left of the barrage. It was opened in 1912 and completed in 1917. It irrigated 877,000 acres of land in the Montgomery and Multan districts. Its total cost was Rs. 22 million and became profitable within 10 years. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * Category:Kasur District Category:Dams in Punjab, Pakistan Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Pakistan Category:British Indian history Category:Dams on the Ravi River ",
