    "text": "Manga (also stylized as maNga) is a Turkish rock band whose music is mainly a fusion of Anatolian melodies with electronic elements. In 2009, they won both the Best Turkish Act award from MTV Turkey and consequently the Best European Act award from MTV Networks Europe in MTV Europe Music Awards 2009. They represented Turkey at the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 with the song \"We Could Be the Same\" and took second place. ==History== Manga was formed in the year 2001, being named after Japanese comics when the group guitarist Ya\u011fmur Sar\u0131g\u00fcl came up with it. Initially, they were mostly underground, playing covers of other rock and metal bands. The band made the music for A\u015f\u0131k Veysel's poem Kara Toprak, and later used a completely different poem by G\u00f6ksel for the song which became known as Dursun Zaman (by the title of G\u00f6ksel's poem \"Dursun Zaman\"). They came into the public spotlight after finishing runner-up at the Sing your song' music contest. This caught the attention of artist manager Hadi Elazzi (GRGDN), who immediately promoted the band to Sony Music, which resulted in their first, self-titled album being published in 2004, becoming a mass hit. Following this, they performed at various music festivals and have worked with such famous Turkish singers as Koray Candemir (of Kargo fame), Vega and G\u00f6ksel. On 13 August 2006, maNga became the first Turkish rock band to take stage at the Sziget Festival, Budapest, Hungary. In 2006 they also had concerts in the Netherlands and Germany. Most of their songs are written by the group members. The genre of their music was described by Ya\u011fmur, the author of most of the songs, as having a touch on nu metal, hip hop and mixing these all in a \"pot\" with melodies of Anatolia. Manga's duet with G\u00f6ksel is included in one of the most successful (with almost a million viewersTolga AKYILDIZ: Iyi filmin iyi \u015fark\u0131lar\u0131 (Goods songs for a good film) - H\u00fcrriyet Newspaper) Turkish films, S\u0131nav (featuring Jean-Claude Van Damme).Sony Music T\u00fcrkiye: Sinav Orijinal Soundtrack Their song Bir kad\u0131n \u00e7izeceksin was featured among the music of the FIFA 06 game. The band is considered a headliner for several Turkish music festivals, including Sakl\u0131fest, Patl\u0131can, RokofestRokofest and Rock'n Coke. The band was to take stage in the Wembley Stadium in London, together with Tarkan, but Manga did not perform due to technical difficulties on 13 April 2008. They also played in London's O2 Academy Islington on 4 December 2009. On 12 January 2010 the Turkish broadcaster TRT announced that maNga would be the Turkish representative at the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. They came second with 170 points, behind Germany. ==Members== Manga on stage at Sziget Festival, Hungary; 13 August 2006. ===Current members=== * Ferman Akg\u00fcl - vocals (2001\u2013present), keyboards (2013-present) * Ya\u011fmur Sar\u0131g\u00fcl - guitar (2001\u2013present) * Cem Bahtiyar - bass guitar (2001\u2013present) * \u00d6zg\u00fcr Can \u00d6ney - drums (2001\u2013present) ===Former members=== * Or\u00e7un \u015eekerusta - bass guitar (2001) *Efe Y\u0131lmaz - DJ, electronics (2001\u20132013) ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:11em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Details ! scope=\"col\"| Sales ! scope=\"col\"| Certifications |- ! scope=\"row\"| maNga | * Released: December 14, 2004 * Label: Sony Music, GRGDN * Format: Digital download, CD | * 100,000+ | * Gold |- ! scope=\"row\"| \u015eehr-i H\u00fcz\u00fcn | * Released: April 14, 2009 * Label: Sony Music, GRGDN Music * Format: Digital download, CD | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| e-akustik | * Released: March 20, 2012 * Label: PASAJ, GRGDN * Format: Digital download, CD | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| I\u015f\u0131klar\u0131 S\u00f6nd\u00fcrseler Bile | * Released: April 14, 2014 * Label: Poll Production * Format: Digital download, CD | | |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:11em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| X | * Released: April 27, 2018 * Label: Poll Production * Format: Digital download |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"5\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| TUR Rock Billboard Turkish Rock Top 20 Chart ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:85%;\"| SWE ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| SWI ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| RUS ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| UK |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"D\u00fcnyan\u0131n Sonuna Do\u011fmu\u015fum\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 2009 | 1 || \u2014 || \u2014 || 335 || \u2014 | rowspan=\"3\"| \u015eehr-i H\u00fcz\u00fcn |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Beni Benimle B\u0131rak\" | 1 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Cevaps\u0131z Sorular\" | 2 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"We Could Be the Same\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2010 | 1 || 29 || 56 || \u2014 || 129 | rowspan=\"2\"| E-akustik |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Fly to Stay Alive\" | 2 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Fazla A\u015fk\u0131 Olan Var M\u0131?\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2014 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | rowspan=\"4\"| I\u015f\u0131klar\u0131 S\u00f6nd\u00fcrseler Bile |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Parti\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Hint Kuma\u015f\u0131\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 2015 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"I\u015f\u0131klar\u0131 S\u00f6nd\u00fcrseler Bile\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Kendi Yolundan \u015ea\u015fma | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Yad Eller\" | 2018 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | X |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"S\u00fcper G\u00fc\u00e7lerimiz Var\" | 2019 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | rowspan=\"2\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Zor\" | 2020 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- | colspan=\"14\" style=\"font-size:85%\"| \"\u2014\" denotes a single that did not chart or was not released. |} ===Other appearances=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Album(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Artist |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Raptiye Rap Rap\" | 2005 | Mutlaka Yavrum | Cem Karaca |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Dursun Zaman\" | 2006 | S\u0131nav Soundtrack | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Beni Unutma\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 2011 | \u0130yilik&G;\u00fczellik Spor | Feridun D\u00fcza\u011fa\u00e7 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Fly To Stay Alive\" | rowspan=\"2\"| Anadolu Kartallar\u0131 Soundtrack | rowspan=\"2\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Tek Y\u00f6n Se\u00e7ti\u011fin T\u00fcm Yollar\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Yine Yeni Yeniden Sev\" | 2015 | Hadi \u0130n\u015fallah Soundtrack | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Hayk\u0131racak Nefesim Kalmasa Bile\" | rowspan=\"1\"| 2019 | Fikret \u015eene\u015f \u015eark\u0131lar\u0131 | Fikret \u015eene\u015f |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Para Parra Parrra\" | rowspan=\"1\"| 2020 | Baba Paras\u0131 Soundtrack | |} ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
