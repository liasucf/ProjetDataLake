    "text": "Achill GFC is a Gaelic football club which represents Achill Island and the Currane Peninsula. The club was founded in 1941. Although the area was not new to Gaelic games, there never existed a club as such to bring together the footballers of the numerous villages to play as one team and represent the parish itself. The Junior footballers contested their first ever West Mayo Championship in 1942 and not only did they win that, they also proceeded to capture the County title.http://achill.gaa.ie/club-history ==History== ==Achievements== * Mayo Junior Football Championship: (6) ** 1942, 1965, 1983, 1991, 1995, 2007 * West Mayo Junior Football Championship: (9) ** 1942, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1958, 1965, 1983, 1991, 1995 * Mayo Juvenile Football Championship: (1) ** 1964 ==References== ==External sources== *Achill GAA website Category:Achill Island Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Mayo ",
