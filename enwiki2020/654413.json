    "text": "Aguada (; ) (originally from San Francisco de As\u00eds de la Aguada) is a municipality of Puerto Rico, located in the western coastal valley region bordering the Atlantic Ocean, east of Rinc\u00f3n, west of Aguadilla and Moca; and north of A\u00f1asco and Mayag\u00fcez. It is part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti\u00e1n Metropolitan Statistical Area. Aguada's population is spread over 17 barrios and Aguada Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). ==History== A Ta\u00edno settlement called Aymam\u00f3n was located close to the Culebrinas River.Caciques y Yucayeques de Puerto Rico on Proyecto Salon Hogar Some sources believe that Christopher Columbus entered the island of Puerto Rico through Aguada on his second voyage in November 1493.Aguada tambi\u00e9n quiere la estatua de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n on Primera Hora; Vargas, Maelo (July 26, 2010) In July 1510, Crist\u00f3bal de Sotomayor received control of the area from Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n and renamed the town Villa de Sotomayor. However, in 1511 the settlement was attacked and burned by the local Ta\u00ednos. That same year, the King ordered a monastery established in the island, and the Ermita de Espinar was founded. The name of the region was then changed to San Francisco de As\u00eds de la Aguada, since the friars were Franciscan. The monastery was finished in 1516. In 1526, King Charles I of Spain officially founded the Aguada settlement. However, in 1529, Ta\u00ednos attacked the monastery killing the friars and burning the settlement.Aguada, la Villa del Sotomayor on Proyecto Salon Hogar Still, Aguada resurfaced and became a stopover point for ships on their way to Spain from South America. On September 17, 1662, King Charles II of Spain emitted a Royal Decree declaring Aguada as a \"village\", and assigning Juan L\u00f3pez de Segura as First Lieutenant. In 1737, Philip V, King of Spain, declared that all mail en route to Venezuela and other South American countries from Puerto Rico must exit from Aguada's ports, leading to the area's economic growth. Also, an increase in population has been attributed to possible desertions from foreign merchant ships. The United States acquired Puerto Rico from Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish- American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898. In 1899, the US conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Aguada was 10,581. In the early years of the 20th Century, two disasters affected the town of Aguada. First, a huge fire in 1912 destroyed most of the town buildings, including the old city hall, which contained all the city archives. On October 11, 1918 at an earthquake known as the San Ferm\u00edn earthquake destroyed the church and other structures.Aguada: Fundaci\u00f3n e historia on Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico At Rio Culebrinas, 1000 kg blocks of limestone from the wrecked Columbus monument were carried inland to distances of by waves high.Tsunamis in the Caribbean Sea - NOAA ===Folklore=== Cross marking spot where Christopher Columbus is said to have disembarked in Aguada (the killer of sharks) is folklore that comes out of Aguada and was written around 1640. A young man who was accustomed to fighting sharks, was without his religious, good luck charms, when he was asked to demonstrate his shark- fighting capabilities to dignitaries who were visiting the island, from Spain. All day and night he pondered whether he would or would not fight a shark because he had never fought a shark without his religious lucky charm. The Spanish had increased their offer to 3 bars of Spanish gold. In the morning, as the shark came into the bay, the spectators who were gathered on the beach screamed and yelled in anticipation. Encouraged and unable to stop himself he jumped into the sea pursuing the shark and fought the shark with his bare hands, as he had done so many times before. Only this time he was nearly killed when the shark hit him with his tail. He received his prize of gold, he healed, but never again fought a shark in the open sea. ==Geography== Aguada is located in the west coast of the island of Puerto Rico.
