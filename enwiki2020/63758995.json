They are ancestrally derived from pleopodal gills, and they facilitate gas exchange on land. They perform a similar function as spiracles do in insects. Pleopodal lungs are identifiable on woodlice as white patches on the lower 5 segments (the pleon) on the ventral side (underside). The number of pleopodal lungs vary by species \u2013 they may have up to five pairs, or only two pairs as in Porcellio laevis; a minority of species lack pleopodal lungs entirely. ==References== Category:Arthropod anatomy ",
