    "text": "Blarf (stylized in all caps) is a musical side project of American comedian Eric Andre. Blarf was originally a band composed of Andre and other unnamed bandmates, but it quickly disbanded. In 2019, Andre revived the name of the band as a solo act, yet still acting as a band, and released the album Cease & Desist through Stones Throw Records. ==History== After Eric Andre enrolled at the Berklee School of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, he formed the band Blarf. The band's goal was to mimic the styles of Frank Zappa and the Beastie Boys. The band was short-lived because the band's drummer \"got married at 18 to an extremely pro-life woman,\" and Andre had made a song called \"I Love Abortions\". On December 25, 2014, Andre independently released a collaborative EP with Canadian record producer The First Seed, titled BLARF. On June 6, 2019, it was revealed that a new artist was signed to Stones Throw Records named Blarf and that his debut studio album Cease & Desist would be released on June 26. Blarf was soon rumored to be an alias of Andre, however Blarf denies it. Andre as himself even insists they are not the same person, writing on Twitter \"People are confusing this guy BLARF on @stonesthrow for me!\". For Blarf's very rare public appearances, he is usually seen wearing a Ronald McDonald costume. The lead single to the album, \"Badass Bullshit Benjamin Buttons Butthole Assassin\", was released on June 18 with an accompanying music video. Cease & Desist was then released as scheduled on June 26, 2019, through Stones Throw. The album is heavily sample-based and contains elements of plunderphonics and noise music. Music videos for tracks \"Banana\" and \"Boom Ba\" were released on July 31 and August 12, 2019, respectively. Andre performed live as Blarf for the first time on July 6, 2019, in Los Angeles with fellow experimental musicians Thundercat, DOMi and JD Beck. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *Cease & Desist (2019) ===Extended plays=== * BLARF (2014) ===Singles=== * \"Badass Bullshit Benjamin Buttons Butthole Assassin\" (2019) * \"Banana\" (2019) * \"Boom Ba\" (2019) ==References== Category:American music ",
