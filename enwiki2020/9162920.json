It was taken to the United States by Eurasian immigrants, who used it as a food source while travelling west. In some areas of the United States it is considered an invasive species. == Description == It is a perennial shrub or small tree up to tall. Typically, it has a moderate to fast growth rate, being able to grow one to three feet during the first year after trimming. The leaves vary from light green to dark green, and are alternate and compound with many small leaflets. Fragrant yellow flowers bloom in May or June. The fruits are legumes which contain many seeds, and ripen in July. As the seed pods dry they have a tendency to twist and pop open, releasing the seeds.Kansas Forest Service: Caragana arborescens == Uses == Caragana arborescens can be grown as an ornamental plant and bonsai.
