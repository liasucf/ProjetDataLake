Elizabeth II was Queen of Guyana; however, she did not reside in or visit Guyana during her reign as Queen of Guyana. The monarch's constitutional roles were mostly delegated to the Governor-General of Guyana. Forbes Burnham held office as prime minister (and head of government) of Guyana during this period. The Republic of Guyana was formed on 23 February 1970 when Guyana became a republic in the Commonwealth.
