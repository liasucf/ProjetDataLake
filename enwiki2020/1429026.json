The offices were used for production, graphics editing and wardrobe/props and among the many things lost, the fire destroyed pieces that were to be used for the 2004 ARIA Music Awards ceremony. The company also lost its costume department, valuable editing equipment, computers and irreplaceable video tapes and digital footage. ==References== ==External links== * Roving Enterprises official website * The Project official website state=expanded ",
