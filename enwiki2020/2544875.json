    "text": "\"Be My Love\" is a popular song with lyrics by Sammy Cahn and music by Nicholas Brodszky. Published in 1950, it was written for Mario Lanza who sang it with Kathryn Grayson in the 1950 movie The Toast of New Orleans. The song was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1950 but lost out to \u201cMona Lisa\u201d. Lanza's 1950 recording of the song (released by RCA Victor Records as catalog number 10-1561) was his first million-seller, eventually selling over two million copies. It was on the Billboard charts for 34 weeks, going all the way to number one. It was the theme song for Lanza's radio program, The Mario Lanza Show (1951\u201352). It eventually became so firmly linked to him that he wearied of it and resorted to spoofing it in private. ==Other versions== *Ray Anthony's rendition of \"Be My Love\" (Capitol F1352) also charted in 1951, peaking at #13. *Connie Francis recorded \"Be My Love\" in 1964 for her motion picture Looking For Love and for the subsequent soundtrack album. *Andy Williams released a version of the song on his 1964 album, The Academy Award-Winning \"Call Me Irresponsible\" and Other Hit Songs from the Movies. *Mel Carter released a version in 1967 which reached #23 in the Adult Contemporary category. *Sammy Davis Jr. released a version of the song on his 1974 album, That's Entertainment. *Spanish tenor Luis Mariano released a French rendition, \"Pour t'aimer\". *Italian Tenor Andrea Bocelli released a version of the song as part of his award-winning album Cinema in 2015. *Mexican tenor Mauro Calder\u00f3n released a Mexican rendition in his 2019 album, \"Por amor\".
