The name derives from komora (in the sense of royal or aristocratic property, rent or income), referring to the land on which the villagers dwelt. Other records indicate that the land (or parts of it) was owned by Wenceslas II (until 1304), the Scholastic Dobe\u0161 (until 1332), the Zbraslav monastery (until 1436), George of Pod\u011bbrady until 1470)) and V\u00e1clav \u0160turm of Hyr\u0161feldu (who added the title seat to the village, after 1589). In 1638 it became the property of the Zbraslav monastery. In 1785, however, the Zbraslav monastery was closed, and Komo\u0159any devolved to the secular trust, which sold the Komo\u0159any chateau, grounds and sheepfold to the Prince of Oettingen-Wallerstein 40 years later. In 1866, it was sold to an Albertan knight. In the meantime, the Komo\u0159any cadastral municipality was created, and in the 19th century, they formed a shared political community with To\u010dn\u00e1. For that reason, in Mal\u00fd Otto's dictionary of 1904, Komo\u0159any is listed simply as a chateau near the village of To\u010dn\u00e1. Komo\u0159any became an independent community on May 20, 1957,.Pra\u017esk\u00fd dopravn\u00ed zem\u011bpis II, 15th section, Mod\u0159any 1st part, DP Kontakt 7/2000 , Dopravn\u00ed podnik hl. m. Prahy, r. 5, \u010dervenec 2000, str. 14 On June 14, 1964, the villages of Komo\u0159any and Mod\u0159any were amalgamated as a town,Anton\u00edn Vl\u010dek: Kronika m\u011bsta Mod\u0159any, okres Praha-z\u00e1pad, za l\u00e9ta 1945\u20131964, 1. \u010d\u00e1st, 6. 3. 1968 which was subsequently annexed to Prague 4 on January 1, 1968. At that time, Komo\u0159any had 1,107 residents and 133 residences. In the 1990 administrative reform of Prague's districts, Komo\u0159any became part of the district of Prague-Mod\u0159any, which was renamed Prague 12 in 1994. ==Geography== View of Komorany from Chuchle The main thoroughfare through Komo\u0159any is Komo\u0159ansk\u00e1 street. The unnamed square formed by Kysl\u00edkov\u00e1, Komo\u0159ansk\u00e1 and Revoluce streets forms Komo\u0159any's natural center. However, that square, the Sigma Mod\u0159any industrial park, and the northeastern part of the Komo\u0159any housing estate all technically fall within Mod\u0159any's cadastral subdivision, despite being separated from Mod\u0159any by a wooded creek valley. The territory of Komo\u0159any is bounded on the west by the Vltava river's right bank. The Komo\u0159ansk\u00e1 stream bisects the municipality, flowing into the Vltava. To the south, the unnamed creek which flows from To\u010dn\u00e1 separates Komo\u0159any from Z\u00e1vist. This area has many cottages and garden plots, as does the area on the edge of the Mod\u0159any Gully park. The headquarters of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute is located in the south-eastern part of Komo\u0159any, next to the chateau and the \u0160abatka estate. In 2000, the estate was renovated into an equestrian center, which is now the home of the Epona Praha equestrian club.Jan Z\u00e1gler: Na \u0160abatce v Praze, maj\u00ed se kon\u011b blaze, J\u00e1 m\u00e1m kon\u011b, srpen 2006 Railway line 210 passes through Komo\u0159any on the right bank of the Vltava, connecting Prague with Vran\u00e9 nad Vltavou. The Praha-Komo\u0159any railway station opened in 1997, replacing the nearby Prague-Mod\u0159any station, which had been closed to passenger traffic in 1991. A spur line to the Sigma Mod\u0159any industrial park carried passenger traffic during a brief period in 1995 while Komo\u0159ansk\u00e1 street was under reconstruction. Komo\u0159any is served by bus lines 165 and 139, with some 165 buses continuing on to Z\u00e1vist and Zbraslav. The southern part of Komo\u0159any is bisected by Prague's Outer Ring Road. The ring road crosses the Vltava river valley above grade - a structure known as the Radot\u00ednsk\u00fd Bridge. The east of the bridge lands in Komo\u0159any, where an unfinished intersection awaits the completion of the Komo\u0159any bypass, before continuing on into the east portal of the Komo\u0159any tunnel. There was a dispute over the partial construction of the intersection, fueled by controversy over construction of the bypass itself and irregularities in the building permits.http://www.prahamhd.vhd.cz/Draha/komorany.htm Pra\u017esk\u00e9 \u017eelezni\u010dn\u00ed stanice a zast\u00e1vky \u2013 Praha-Komo\u0159any, Spole\u010dnost pro ve\u0159ejnou dopravu, prahamhd.vhd.czJakub D\u017eurn\u00fd: Pr\u016fmyslov\u00e1 historie Komo\u0159an, web Pos\u00e1zavsk\u00fd pacifik, aktualizace 9. 1. 2010 ==Photo gallery== File:Okru\u017en\u00ed str, Prague Komo\u0159any.jpg|Villas on Okru\u017en\u00ed street File:Na \u0160abatce str, Prague Komo\u0159any.jpg|Czech Hydrometeorological Institute File:Do Kout\u016f str, Prague Komo\u0159any.jpg|Abandoned shopping centre (reconstructed in 2008) File:U Vle\u010dky str2, Prague Komo\u0159any.jpg|U Vle\u010dky housing estate == References == *This article was initially translated from the Czech Wikipedia.
