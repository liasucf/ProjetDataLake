    "text": "The Degoodi or Degodia (, ) is a Somali clan. Members of the clan primarily inhabit Kenya, but also large part of southern Ethiopia and places in southern Somalia. Like many Somalis, Degoodi members trace their paternal ancestry to Samaale, through their Gardhere ancestor. They are genealogically related to the other Samaale, but in particular to the Garjante, Gaalje'el, Masare, Isa (Saransor) and 'Owrmale, with which they share the same ancestor Gardhere Samaale. == History == When Arthur Donaldson Smith traveled through what is now Bare woreda in 1895, he found that the Degodia were neighbors of the Afgab clan (whom they were at endless war with), their territory stretching east to the Weyib and Dawa Rivers.Donaldson-Smith, Through Unknown African Countries: the first expedition from Somaliland to Lake Rudolph (London, 1897), p. 143 The Degodia are said to have originated around the rivers Dawa, Parma and Ganale Daria in southeastern Ethiopia and from Eel Ali in Somalia, where clansmen are still present today. The Degodia community across the world are united under one leader called Wabar. The current Wabar (King) is Wabar Abdille Wabar Abdi. The Degodia nation has a unique traditional system of leadership/authority. Supreme authority is vested in the Wabar and exercised through a consultative process that brings together community representatives (guurti) and council of elders. The Wabar has got 15 advisors and over 100 council of elders. The Degodia nation across the world is united under one leadership of the Wabar. Therefore his traditional jurisdiction transcends space. Succession in the Wabar system of leadership is determined by descent. The crown is inherited through family lineage. Pedigree plays a critical role in determining who is crowned as the next Wabar. So far there are 12 Wabars who served the community: 1\\. Wabar Cuudow 2\\. Wabar Amiin 3\\. Wabar Ali 4\\. Wabar Omar 5\\. Wabar Caalin 6\\. Wabar Abdi 7\\. Wabar Omar 8\\. Wabar Ali 9\\. Wabar Hassan 10\\. Wabar Osman 11\\. Wabar Abdi 12\\.
