One of his victims is the young Crenaeus, son of Pan and the nymph Ismenis. The latter, upon discovering her son's dead body, implores her father, the river god Ismenus, to avenge the youth's death. Ismenus raises the waters of his river and nearly drowns Hippomedon, but he prays that he may not die a death like that, and Hera persuades Zeus to make Ismenus spare him. However, Hippomedon gets out of the water unarmored and is met with a storm of the enemy's missiles, which kill him. Hypseus then takes his helmet as trophy and announces his death to the allies, shortly before getting killed by Capaneus.Statius, Thebaid, 9. 90 - 569 == References == Category:Characters in Seven against Thebes ",
