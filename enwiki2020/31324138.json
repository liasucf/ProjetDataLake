    "text": "Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez Fern\u00e1ndez (born 8 June 1966) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a striker. He is H\u00e9rcules league's all-time top scorer and played professionally for 13 years, in representation of five clubs. ==Club career== Born in Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda, C\u00e1diz, Andalusia, Rodr\u00edguez arrived at Real Betis at the age of 17. During his eight-year link with the club he would only appear in seven La Liga games \u2013 six coming in the 1988\u201389 season under the guidance of Eusebio R\u00edos, who was sacked after the 13th round \u2013 also being loaned twice, successively to Recreativo de Huelva and CD Badajoz, helping the latter win the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B championship, albeit without promotion. Rodr\u00edguez signed for H\u00e9rcules CF in the 1991 summer, being instrumental as the team returned to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n in his second year, with 32 goals scored. After netting four times in as many games into 1993\u201394, he returned to the top level with Rayo Vallecano, signing for \u20ac300.000; he only managed to score once during the campaign, and the Madrid outskirts side suffered relegation. After helping Rayo immediately regain its lost status, Rodr\u00edguez returned to H\u00e9rcules and achieved the same feat, scoring 14 goals from 30 appearances as the Alicante team returned to the top flight. He only added one, however, one in the following season \u2013 in a 3\u20132 away win against FC Barcelona on 13 January 1997 \u2013 in an eventual relegation. Rodr\u00edguez retired from football in June 1998 at the age of 32. After briefly working with main club H\u00e9rcules in directorial capacities, he lost all connection to the football world, remaining in Alicante. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Badajoz *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B: 1990\u201391 ;H\u00e9rcules *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n: 1995\u201396 ===Individual=== *Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B: Top Scorer 1992\u201393 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda Category:Spanish footballers Category:Andalusian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Betis Deportivo Balompi\u00e9 footballers Category:Real Betis players Category:Recreativo de Huelva players Category:CD Badajoz players Category:H\u00e9rcules CF players Category:Rayo Vallecano players ",
