The lower slopes are mostly cultivated. Dry miombo woodland can be found on the middle slopes, and in the valley between the east and west peaks. The highest peaks are mostly bare granite, with pockets of montane heathland. The mountain has no year-round streams, but several intermittent streams run during the wet season.Conradie W, Bittencourt-Silva GB, Engelbrecht HM, Loader SP, Menegon M, Nanvonamuquitxo C, Scott M, Tolley KA (2016) \"Exploration into the hidden world of Mozambique\u2019s sky island forests: new discoveries of reptiles and amphibians.\" Zoosystematics and Evolution 92(2): 163-180. ==References== Rib\u00e1u\u00e8 Rib\u00e1u\u00e8 Rib\u00e1u\u00e8 Rib\u00e1u\u00e8 Rib\u00e1u\u00e8 ",
