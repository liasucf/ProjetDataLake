In July 2005 Luis started a hip-hop side-project called Lyricle Miracle with fellow Suburban Legends band member Derek Lee Rock and Jack Bartlett. He is American born and is of both Salvadoran and Guatemalan ancestry. As of April 2009 Luis had quit Suburban Legends, saying \"...it was just time to move on.\" He's now doing studio work, on tracks with such acts as MC Lars, Patent Pending, and Dusty Rhodes and The River Band. == External links == * Luis' page on SuburbanLegends.com Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Suburban Legends members Category:American trumpeters Category:American male trumpeters Category:American punk rock musicians Category:American people of Guatemalan descent Category:21st-century trumpeters Category:21st-century American male musicians ",
