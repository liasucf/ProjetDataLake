    "text": "Botryoidal Spring is a fountain-type geyser in the Lower Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Botryoidal Spring is part of the White Creek Group, which includes A-0 Geyser and Spindle Geyser. As the name indicates, Botryoidal Spring was originally known as a hot spring. The term botryoidal refers to the subspherical, grape-like geyserite structures around the vent. In 1996, seismic activity resulted in the sparkling spring changing to an active geyser. It erupts for about one minute. Intervals (= eruption start to eruption start) are 3 to 5 minutes. The fountain reaches a height of 10 feet (3 m). Immediately after an eruption, the pool is quiet. With no warning, eruptions start with a broad, moderately noisy burst. Smaller bursting continues for less than a minute. Eruptions may start with a blue bubble, caused by a large steam bubble rising from below the water surface. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Geysers of Wyoming Category:Geothermal features of Teton County, Wyoming Category:Geothermal features of Yellowstone National Park Category:Geysers of Teton County, Wyoming ",
