    "text": "Exterior of Union Park in 1895. Union Park is a former baseball ground located in Baltimore, Maryland. The ground was home to the Baltimore Orioles during their first \"glory years\" in the 1890s. It was located in area bounded by East 25th Street to the north, 24th Street to the south Hunter Street to the west and Barclay Street to the east. The Orioles opened this park during the 1891 season, abandoning Oriole Park. Their first game there was on May 11, 1891, an 8\u20134 victory over the St. Louis Browns in front of over 10,000 fans (https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rJFDAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=grkMAAAAIBAJ&pg;=7081%2C3981859). At that time they were playing in the then-major American Association. After that season, the Association folded, and four of its teams were absorbed into the National League, including the Orioles. The Orioles became a perennial contender during that time. Despite that success, they were dropped when the National League contracted after the 1899 season. The legacy of those Orioles lived on through the later achievements of their many Hall of Fame players, such as John McGraw, Wilbert Robinson, Hughie Jennings and Willie Keeler. There was a destructive fire on January 14, 1895, which destroyed the grandstand and a clubhouse. The structure was rebuilt and the Orioles were able to continue to use ballpark for their remaining seasons. Today the site is a residential area of Barclay with 321 East 25th Street once located next to the grandstand.https://www.deadballbaseball.com/?p=1343 That and other buildings visible in the background of the 1890s photo of the ballpark's exterior still stand today. ==Sources== * ==References== Category:Sports venues in Baltimore Category:Defunct baseball venues in the United States Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Baltimore Category:Defunct sports venues in Maryland Category:Baltimore Orioles (1882\u20131899) Category:Baseball venues in Maryland Category:Sports venues completed in 1891 Category:1891 establishments in Maryland ",
