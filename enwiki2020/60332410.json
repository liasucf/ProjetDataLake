    "text": "One Day, Forever is an album by saxophonist/composer Benny Golson that was recorded between 1996 and 2000 and released by the Arkadia Jazz label in 2001.Arkadia Jazz discography: album details accessed March 25, 2019Benny Golson website: discography accessed March 25, 2019Jazzdisco: Benny Golson catalog accessed March 25, 2019 ==Reception== The AllMusic review by Ken Dryden said \"Benny Golson has made many excellent recordings over the decades, but One Day, Forever is in a class by itself\". All About Jazz stated \"The result is a CD in three mentalities, all of which are contained by Golson\u2019s imagination: the famous sextet sound that produced numbers like \u201cKiller Joe,\u201d a string orchestra backing Shirley Horn as she sings the words to Golson\u2019s new music, and a piano piece introducing Golson\u2019s first classical composition. While not consistent in theme, One Day, Forever does reveal in startling contrast the creative curiosity of Benny Golson ... Certainly, one could say that One Day, Forever contains something for everyone\".All About Jazz Review accessed March 25, 2019 JazzTimes' Harvey Siders observed \"One Day Forever is a tour de force for Benny Golson. This is an elaborate sampler of his talents as composer-arranger, lyricist and tenor saxophonist ... So many facets of Benny Golson are on display here\".Siders, H., JazzTimes Review, accessed March 25, 2019 == Track listing == All compositions by Benny Golson # \"One Day, Forever (I Remember Miles)\" \u2013 5:08 # \"Blue Walk\" \u2013 6:18 # \"Killer Joe\" \u2013 7:54 # \"Are You Real?\" \u2013 6:59 # \"Sad to Say\" \u2013 4:46 # \"Out of the Past\" \u2013 9:18 # \"Blues Alley\" \u2013 4:13 # \"Along Came Betty\" \u2013 7:36 # \"On Gossamer Wings\" \u2013 10:20 == Personnel == Tracks 2-4 & 6-8: *Benny Golson \u2013 tenor saxophone *Art Farmer \u2013 trumpet *Curtis Fuller \u2013 trombone *Geoff Keezer \u2013 piano *Dwayne Burno - bass *Joe Farnsworth \u2013 drums Tracks 1 & 5: *Benny Golson \u2013 tenor saxophone, arranger, conductor *Robert Carlisle, John Clark \u2013 French horn *Elizabeth Mann \u2013 flute *Gerard Reuter \u2013 oboe *Mulgrew Miller \u2013 piano *Bill Mays \u2013 keyboards *Ron Carter \u2013 bass *Carl Allen \u2013 drums *Shirley Horn \u2013 vocals *Clay Ruede, David Heiss, Diane Barere, Eliana Mendoza, Erik Friedlander, Eugene Moye, Frederick Zlotkin, Jeanne Leblanc, Joseph Kimura, Lanny Paykin, Maxine Neuman, Richard Locker \u2013 cello Track 9: *Lara Downes \u2013 piano ===Production=== *Bob Karcy \u2013 producer *Dennis Wall \u2013 engineer == References == Category:Benny Golson albums Category:2001 albums Category:Arkadia Jazz albums ",
