She joined the project in November 1990, while an undergraduate maths student enrolled in a sandwich course at Leicester Polytechnic (now De Montfort University). Pellow recalled having little experience with programming languages, \"... apart from using a bit of Pascal and FORTRAN as part of my degree course.\" Almost immediately after Berners-Lee completed the WorldWideWeb web browser for the NeXT platform,A screenshot from TBL's first web browser Pellow was tasked with creating a browser, after a quick lesson in C programming. She wrote the generic Line Mode BrowserA view from Nicola Pellow's line mode browser that could run on non-NeXT systems. The WWW team began to improve on her work, creating several experimental versions. Pellow was involved in porting the browser to different types of computers.
