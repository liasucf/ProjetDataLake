Its population was 379 as of the 2010 census. The community's main roads are East Hwy 72, which connects from US 119, and travels to an end at Old RB Mines, however, 72 runs to Harlan via gravel road,and Ky 2005 an old gravel road that leads to Smith/Brownies Creek, south of Harlan, Kentucky. ==Overview== The community used to rely heavily on coal mining. But many coal mines now have been shut down causing a reduction in the production of coal. The recent recession in the coal market brought about by over regulation of the E.P.A., and the cheaper cost of natural gas, has caused high unemployment rates in this small community as well as Harlan County, Kentucky and throughout the United States. A small community park, known as Coal Miner's Memorial Park, was created to honor the community's ties to coal mining. There are four churches in the community: Insull Holiness, Pathfork Holiness Church, Pathfork Baptist and Blackstar Pentecostal Church. ==References== Category:Census-designated places in Kentucky Category:Census-designated places in Harlan County, Kentucky Category:Unincorporated communities in Kentucky Category:Unincorporated communities in Harlan County, Kentucky Category:Coal towns in Kentucky ",
