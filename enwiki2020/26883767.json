While, according to the Chicago Tribune, \"Captive Heart\" was destined for urban-contemporary radio. Leonard Charles of Miami Today, commented on \"Captive Heart\"s lack of impact on the Hot 100, stating that the song would have been stronger if EMI Records had promoted the single extensively. Charles also commented that he believes that the record company didn't put in much effort on the song but believed that EMI had only put in effort on singles \"Dreaming of You\" and \"I Could Fall in Love\". Benson Ramos of The Gaston Gazette believed \"Captive Heart\" wasn't \"crossover potential\". Steven Washington of Aurora Sentinel praised the song's \"electronic feels\" and \"Latin flavors\" that it brings to the song. Sabrina Moore of Corsicana Daily Sun, disliked the song because it felt \"unoriginal\" but commented that Selena could have done better in another Latin flavored ballad. The Daily Vault believed Selena made a mistake with \"Captive Heart\", stating that \"the song was a surprising and painful flaw, because it showcases a mistake of exerting too much throat, which many popular singers currently do\". The Daily Vault instated that it was a one-way ticket to voice destruction. Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News stated while reviewing \"I'm Getting Used To You\" that the songs \"are a bit more uptempo, bordering on that New Jill Swing sound popularized by Mary J. Blige and Jade\". == Track listing == *U.S. Promo Single (1995) # \"Captive Heart\" \u2013 4:23-4;18 *U.S. Cassette Single (1995)EMI Telvisia (1995) Selena \u2013 Captive Heart \u2013 Cassette Single \u2013 (Liner Notes) EMI Records # \"Captive Heart\" \u2013 4:23 == Credits and personnel == All credits were taken from the album's liner notes. *Selena \u2013 vocals, backing vocals *Donna De Lory \u2013 back-up singer *Mark Goldenberg \u2013 writer *Kit Hain \u2013 writer *Juan Figueroa, Arnold Hain \u2013 synthesizers *Jos\u00e9 Behar \u2013 co-producer *Guy Roche \u2013 producer *Nathaniel \"Mick\" Guzuaski \u2013 audio mixer *Mario Lucy \u2013 engineer *Brain \"Red\" Moore \u2013 engineer *Mona Suchard \u2013 engineer and assistant engineer == See also == *List of Selena songs *Selena singles discography == References == Category:1995 singles Category:Selena songs Category:Synth-pop songs Category:Songs released posthumously Category:1995 songs Category:Songs written by Mark Goldenberg Category:EMI Records singles ",
