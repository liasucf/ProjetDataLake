On October 1, 2004 all the former towns and villages of Minamiuwa (J\u014dhen, Mish\u014d, Nishiumi, Uchiumi, and Ipponmatsu) merged to form a larger town, Ainan. Ainan is known for its fishing and agriculture industries which produce a variety of products, including bonito, red snapper, yellowtail, oysters, noble scallops, and citrus fruits mikan. The main citrus fruit is Ainan Gold Grapefruit. In addition, Kanjizaiji is located in Ainan. Kanjizaiji is a Shingon Buddhist temple and the 40th of the 88 temples on the Shikoku Pilgrimage. ==Geography and climate== A view of the Sozu River in AinanAinan is located between the mountains of southern Ehime and the Pacific Ocean, on the border with K\u014dchi Prefecture. As a result, winters in Ainan are relatively mild. It's rare to see snow in most parts of the town, though flurries may be seen several times a year. The rainy season runs from June to July. The summer is hot and humid, with infrequent rain showers. Ainan offers a variety of activities. The Sozu river runs through Ainan. There is a walking path along the river. Swimming can be enjoyed upstream in the mountains. There are three hot springs with lodging; Yurari Uchiumi, next to the sea in the north, Yamaidashi Onsen, along the Sozu River in the mountains to the east and Ipponmatsu Onsen Akebono So to the south. Sasayama Mountain is the highest mountain in Ainan (1,064.4 m) which has a rare variety of azaleas blooming on its peak, best seen in late April, early May. The peninsula stretching to the west is famous for fishing and has Uwakai Underwater National Park. In the area there is a glass bottom boat and a ferry to transport tourists to Kashima Island. On the island visitors can sunbathe on the beach or swim or snorkel in the water. There is also a special guided underwater experience called Sea Walker. There is a museum which houses Shidenkai, a Japanese military aircraft that was restored after being found in the nearby sea and raised from the seabed. Near the museum there is a revolving tower stretching 107 meters into the sky. Visitors can ride to the top and see the entire area of Ainan for a small fee. Ainan's location, bordering on the inland sea, close to where it meets the Pacific Ocean, allows for local restaurants and people to get some of the freshest fish in Japan. Ainan prides itself on the delicious fresh fish and also has a special word in the dialect for its special freshness, \"Biya-Biya.\" ==Festivals== Men carry a mikoshi during the fall festivalA variety of festivals are celebrated in Ainan, including Ainan Tairyo Matsuri in May, Natsu Matsuri (Summer festival), Obon, and Aki Matsuri. During the Obon festival, Japan's equivalent of All Souls' Day, family members from all over Japan return to their family homes in Ainan to remember the souls of the dead. The festival is celebrated all over town, from the larger parts of Misho to the smallest villages in Nishiumi. In the evening, torches and lanterns can be seen along the seashore where the towns are gathering. Aki Matsuri (fall festival) is a major event for the local people. People gather in many places to watch children perform the Five Deer Dance, or the Karashishi dance. Adults also carry Omikoshi (large hand-carried floats) and Ushi Oni (a large cow demon float) around town. ==Travel== A train line does not pass through Ainan, although there are frequent buses through Uwajima Jidosha Bus Company which connect from Uwajima and Matsuyama. The nearest trains lines are to the north, in Uwajima, or to the south, in Sukumo. For travel to further destinations, Johen bus center offers overnight buses to Osaka and Tokyo. In addition, Ainan can be reached by route 56, which runs around the island of Shikoku and through the cities of Matsuyama and K\u014dchi. Travel by car has been greatly improved with the high-speed highway which has been extended further south. The newest extension is underway to pass through town and connect to Sukumo City in Kochi Prefecture to the southeast. == Sister city == * Molinaseca, Spain == References == ==External links== * *Ainan official website Category:Towns in Ehime Prefecture ",
