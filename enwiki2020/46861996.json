It was the ninth round of the 2014\u201315 Formula E season. ==Background== On 3 February 2015, it was announced that the newly founded Formula E, a class of auto racing for one-make, single-seater, electrically powered racing cars, was set to race in Moscow on a street circuit near the Kremlin, on the north bank of the Moskva River. Coming into the race from Berlin a fortnight earlier, Nelson Piquet, Jr. was leading the championship on 103, with S\u00e9bastien Buemi second 2 points behind. They had both jumped Lucas di Grassi, who was disqualified from the Berlin race for having an illegal front wing. Di Grassi sits third on 93 points. The win was inherited by J\u00e9r\u00f4me d'Ambrosio, who sits in fifth on 77 points, one point behind Nicolas Prost. ==Report== ===Sessions=== All sessions took place on Saturday, 6 June 2015. ===Fan Boost=== Nelson Piquet Jr., S\u00e9bastien Buemi and Lucas di Grassi won the Fan Boost. It was Piquet's fourth boost in a row, second in a row for Buemi, and second overall for di Grassi. It was the first for di Grassi since the season opener, and the first time the top 3 in the championship took the Fan Boost advantage. ==Results== ===Qualifying=== {| class=wikitable style=\"font- size:95%\" ! ! !
