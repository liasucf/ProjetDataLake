Parents John and Mary. International Genealogical Index batch C030651; source call no. 0425482; Printout call no. 6911781 and was later a pupil at King Edward's School, Birmingham. He was the inventor of a series of food products, most notably egg-free custard and baking powder.\"Alfred Bird: Egg-free custard inventor and chemist\". Birmingham Mail. Retrieved 25 February 2018 His father was a lecturer in astronomy at Eton College. His son Alfred Frederick Bird continued to develop the business after his father's death. ==Career == Alfred Bird registered as a pharmacist in Birmingham in 1842, having served an apprenticeship to Phillip Harris of that city. He was a qualified chemist and druggist and went on to open an experimental chemist's shop in Bull Street. Alfred Bird's first major invention was egg-free custard in 1837. Alfred Bird used cornflour instead of egg to create an imitation of egg custard. It was originally intended only for his wife Elizabeth who had both egg and yeast allergies. The Birds used genuine custard when entertaining guests, but on one occasion the egg-free custard was (either by accident or design) fed to dinner guests. It was well received, and Alfred Bird realised that his invention had a wider use. Soon afterwards Alfred Bird founded 'Alfred Bird and Sons Ltd', which would go on to become the famous Bird's Custard company and brand. Bird was not content to revolutionise custard but went on to invent a baking powder in 1843 so he could make yeast-free bread for his wife. This formula for baking powder is essentially the same as used in modern baking powders. ==Death == Alfred Bird's Memorial at Key Hill Cemetery Alfred Bird died on 15 December 1878 in Kings Norton, Worcestershire and is buried at Key Hill Cemetery in Birmingham. Famously his obituary in the journal of the Chemical Society (of which he was a fellow) discussed at length his skills and research but did not mention his other activity \u2013 the by then famous Bird's Custard and Bird's Jelly. It read: ==Personal life == His son, Alfred Frederick Bird, continued the work of his father. Bird junior went on to invent egg substitute powder in 1890, blancmange powder and jelly powder. \"The Custard Factory\" in Digbeth, Birmingham, is now a centre providing space to artists. == See also == * Henry Jones, a Bristol baker who patented self-raising flour in 1845, as a means of providing fresh bread on ships. * August Oetker, German populariser of baking powder in 1891 ==References== ==External links== *Alfred Bird Category:1811 births Category:1878 deaths Category:English inventors Category:English chemists Category:People from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:People educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham Category:Burials at Key Hill Cemetery ",
