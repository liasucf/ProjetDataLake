Organizational Research Methods, 19(4), 651\u2013682. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428116656239 a single-administration test score reliability (i.e., the reliability of persons over items holding occasion fixed[2]) coefficient, commonly referred to as composite reliability, construct reliability, and coefficient omega. \\rho_C is a structural equation model(SEM)-based reliability coefficients and is obtained from on a unidimensional model. \\rho_C is the second most commonly used reliability factor after tau-equivalent reliability(\\rho_T), and is often recommended as its alternative. == Formula and calculation == === Systematic and conventional formula === Congeneric measurement model Let X_i denote the observed score of item i and X(=X_1 + X_2 + \\cdots + X_k) denote the sum of all items in a test consisting of k items. It is assumed that each item's (observation) score consists of the item's (unobserved) true score and the item's error (i.e., X_i=T_i+e_i). The congeneric model assumes that each item's true score is a linear combination of a common factor (F) (i.e., T_i=\\mu_i+\\lambda_i F). \\lambda_i is often referred to as a factor loading of item i. \\sigma^2_X is the sum of all the elements of the fitted/implied covariance matrix of X obtained from estimates of \\lambda_i 's and \\sigma_{e_i}'s. \\rho_C's \"systematic formula\" is: : \\rho_C = \\frac{\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i \\right)^2}{\\sigma^2_X} Its conventional (i.e., more often used) formula is: : \\rho_C = \\frac{ \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i \\right)^2 }{ \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i \\right)^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma^2_{e_i} } === Example === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Fitted/implied covariance matrix |- ! ! X_1 ! X_2 ! X_3 ! X_4 |- ! X_1 | 10.00 |- ! X_2 | 4.42 || 11.00 |- ! X_3 | 4.98 || 5.71 || 12.00 |- !

G. (1971). Statistical analysis of sets of congeneric tests. Psychometrika, 36(2), 109\u2013133. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02291393 Its conventional formula first appeared in Werts et al. (1974).Werts, C. E., Linn, R. L., & J\u00f6reskog, K. G. (1974). Intraclass reliability estimates: Testing structural assumptions. Educational and Psychological Measurement, 34, 25\u201333. https://doi.org/10.1177/001316447403400104 They didn't give the formula a special name and just referred to it as \"reliability.\" In other words, this formula has no official name, and this absence causes various versions of the name to be created. ==Names of congeneric reliability== {\\rho}_{C} has been referred to by various names between applied researchers and between reliability researchers. In addition, the names used by applied researchers differ from the names used by reliability researchers. This diversity and difference create confusion and inaccuracies in communication. ===Composite reliability=== ====Historical origin==== Werts et al. (1978)Werts, C. E., Rock, D. R., Linn, R. L., & J\u00f6reskog, K. G. (1978). A general method of estimating the reliability of a composite. Educational and Psychological Measurement, 38(4), 933\u2013938. https://doi.org/10.1177/001316447803800412 also called this formula \"reliability.\" However, they used the expression \"the composite reliability\" once as an abbreviation of the reliability of a composite score to distinguish the reliability of a single item. Since then, this unintended name has been used as the name of this formula. ====Logical and practical problems==== The term composite reliability is short for the 'reliability of composite scores'. Unless measured by a single item, all reliability coefficients are composite reliability. Therefore, this name is not suitable as a specific formula name. The name composite reliability gives the impression that this reliability coefficient is complex, or that it has been synthesized from other reliability coefficients. ====Frequency of use==== Applied researchers most often use this name when referring to \\rho_{C}.Google search in April 2020 found 462,000 web documents which included the term \"composite reliability\". Researchers who publish papers on reliability rarely use this name. ===Construct reliability=== ====Historical origin==== The term has been used in the books of Hair and his colleagues,Hair, J. F., Anderson, R. E., Tatham, R. L., & Black, W. C. (1995). Multivariate data analysis with readings (4th ed.). Prentice Hall.Hair, J. F., Babin, B. J., Anderson, R. E., & Black, W. C. (2018).

Prentice Hall. the world's best sellers for practical statistical analysis. ====Logical and practical problems==== Construct reliability is short for the 'reliability of a construct'. Construct is synonymous with concept.Podsakoff, P. M., MacKenzie, S. B., & Podsakoff, N. P. (2016). Recommendations for creating better concept definitions in the organizational, behavioral, and social sciences. Organizational Research Methods, 19(2), 159\u2013203. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428115624965 A construct is a theoretical and abstract entity and is embodied through measurement.Cronbach, L. J., & Meehl, P. E. (1955). Construct validity in psychological tests. Psychological Bulletin, 52(4), 281\u2013302. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0040957 We can estimate the reliability of a measurement, but not the reliability of a construct. For example, you can say the reliability of \"a measure of height,\" but not the reliability of the concept of \"height.\" Construct reliability is a term that is not logically established. Let's say that this term makes sense. All other reliability coefficients also originate from the measurement of a construct and should be called construct reliability. Construct reliability is not suitable as a term referring to a specific reliability coefficient. ====Frequency of use==== Applied researchers use the term construct reliability at a frequency of 1/3 of composite reliability.Google search in April 2020 found 149,000 web documents which included the term \"construct reliability\". Researchers who publish papers on reliability rarely use this name. ===Coefficient omegaCho, E. and Chun, S. (2018), Fixing a broken clock: A historical review of the originators of reliability coefficients including Cronbach\u2019s alpha. Survey Research, 19(2), 23\u201354.=== ====Historical origin==== The name coefficient \\omega is based on McDonald's (1985, 1999)McDonald, R. P. (1985). Factor analysis and related methods. Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.McDonald, R. P. (1999). Test theory: A unified treatment. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.claim that McDonald (1970)McDonald, R. P. (1970). Theoretical canonical foundations of principal factor analysis, canonical factor analysis, and alpha factor analysis. British Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology, 23, 1-21. doi:10.1111/j.2044-8317.1970.tb00432.x. first developed \\rho_{C}. In his paper on exploratory factor analysis (EFA), McDonald (1970) presents a reliability formula using the \\theta symbol. This formula was included in the footnote of the article without any explanation. McDonald (1985) refers to a formula algebraically equivalent to \\rho_{C} as \\omega in his book. He also says that the \\theta presented by McDonald (1970) is renamed \\omega. McDonald (1999) describes various types of reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional and multi-dimensional models) as \\omega. He explicitly declares that he first proposed \\rho_{C}. McDonald (1985, 1999)) does not cite J\u00f6reskog (1971) or Werts et al. (1974). The following objections were made. First, the formula proposed by McDonald (1970) was not new. If this formula were of high academic value at that time, it would not have been presented without explanation in the footnotes. In the context of EFA, there are studies suggesting similar reliability formulas.Bentler, P. M. (1968). Alpha-maximized factor analysis (alphamax): Its relation to alpha and canonical factor analysis. Psychometrika, 33(3), 335\u2013345. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289328Heise, D. R., & Bohrnstedt, G. W. (1970). Validity, invalidity, and reliability. Sociological Methodology, 2, 104-129. doi:10.2307/270785. Second, McDonald (1970) 's \\theta differs from \\rho_{C}. The denominator of the formula given by McDonald (1970) is observed covariances, and the denominator of \\rho_{C} is fitted covariances. Third, McDonald (1970) did not discuss how to actually obtain this coefficient. While it is easy to derive a reliability formula, the more important barrier at that time was how to obtain estimates of each parameter. J\u00f6reskog has addressed this issue across studies.J\u00f6reskog, K. G. (1969). A general approach to confirmatory maximum likelihood factor analysis. Psychometrika, 34(2), 183\u2013202. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289343 J\u00f6reskog, K. G. (1970). A general method for analysis of covariance structures. Biometrika, 57, 239-251. doi:10.1093/biomet/57.2.239. Fourth, it was J\u00f6reskog (1971) that actually influenced users. McDonald (1970) was occasionally cited in EFA literature, but rarely cited in reliability literature. The expression coefficients \\omega was rarely used before 2009. ====Logical and practical problems==== Various SEM-based reliability coefficients are referred to as \\omega, typically without a definition. Therefore, it is difficult for readers to know exactly what the name \\omega refers to. This practice reduces the accuracy of communication. If we need a generic name to refer to a variety of reliability coefficients, using \\rho rather than \\omega is more traditional. ====Frequency of use==== Applied researchers rarely use this name. Researchers who publish papers on reliability often use this name recently.Brunner, M., Nagy, G., & Wilhelm, O. (2012). A Tutorial on Hierarchically Structured Constructs.

The name congeneric reliability has been used occasionally in reliability literature since then.Graham, J. M. (2006).
