The boycott involved 14 Eastern Bloc countries and allies, led by the Soviet Union, which initiated the boycott on May 8, 1984. Boycotting countries organized another major event, called the Friendship Games, in July and August 1984. Although the boycott led by the Soviet Union affected a number of Olympic events that were normally dominated by the absent countries, 140 nations still took part in the games, which was a record at the time.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/05/09/soviets- withdraw-from-los-angeles-olympics/027363e6-4d89-4dd9-b0d7-89a05a567f11/ == Announcement of boycott == The USSR announced its intentions to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics on May 8, 1984, citing security concerns and \"chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States.\" A US official said the country had ignored suggestive comments by the Soviets in the weeks building up to the announcement and that, in spite of all the indications, the United States was \"absolutely dumbfounded\" when the official announcement arrived.East Germany withdraws from Summer Games.

Iran had earlier decided to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics because of \"United States interference in the Middle East, its support for the regime occupying Jerusalem, and the crimes being committed by the U.S.A. in Latin America, especially in El Salvador\".Iran Announces Boycott Of the 1984 Olympics. The New York Times. Published: August 2, 1983. Iran and Albania were the only countries to not attend both the 1980 Moscow and the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Libya also boycotted the Olympics after Libyan journalists were refused entry into the United States in July, after Libya announced the ban upon US exports to Libya in 1983 and a renewal of bans upon travel to Libya by holders of US passports.Ronen, Yehudit; 'Libya (Al-Jamh\u0101h\u012briyaa al-'Arabiyya al-L\u012bbiyya ash-Sha'biyya al-Ishtir\u0101kiyya)'; Middle East Contemporary Survey, Vol. 8, (1983-84); p. 595 Libya and Ethiopia were the only nations to boycott both the 1976 Montreal and 1984 Los Angeles Games. In addition, Albania did not attend any games from 1976 to 1988, although there was no official explanation for their absence at the 1976 Montreal Olympics and 1988 Seoul Olympics. Politically, Albania allied with China after the Sino-Soviet split, remaining antagonistic towards the Soviet Union; however, it also opposed China's rapprochement with the United States in the late 1970s, resulting in the Sino-Albanian split. A similar antagonism towards both superpowers existed in Iran since 1979. This resulted in Iran and Albania boycotting both the 1980 and 1984 Olympics independently without endorsing the boycott on the opposing side. == Revenge hypothesis == Jimmy Carter declared that the United States would boycott the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, with 65 other countries joining the boycott. This was the largest Olympic games boycott ever. In 1984, three months before the start of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, the Soviet Union declared it would \"not participate\" in the Games. The Soviets cited a number of reasons, namely the commercialization of the games which, in their opinion, went against the principles of the Olympic movement (indeed the XXIII Olympiad ended up being the first Olympics since 1932 to make a profit by a host country) and a claimed lack of security for their athletes. The issue of commercialization did gather some criticism from foreign delegations, who were unfamiliar with this trend in the Olympic movement. However, the IOC later declared the Games \"a model for future Olympics\" due to a surplus of US$223 million for the hosts, exclusively private funding (unlike Moscow Olympics that were state- funded), and relying on existing venues instead of building new ones. olympic.org The majority viewed the boycott as more of a retaliatory move by the Soviets. Most of the world's media interpreted the Soviet boycott as retaliation for the US boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games,Tyner, Howard A. U.S. Olympic boycott of 1980 led to Soviet decision of 1984. Chicago Tribune. May 9, 1984. D13. which had been in response to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, whereas the Soviet media repeated the government line that the boycott was a safety measure to protect their own athletes. However, no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered, and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles--Romania-- encountered no problems, and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum. Romania ended up finishing third in overall medal count at the Games. Among those subscribing to the \"revenge hypothesis\" was Peter Ueberroth, the chief organizer of the 1984 L.A. Games, who expressed his views in a press conference after the boycott was announced, on the same day that the Olympic torch relay in the United States began in New York City. U.S. President Ronald Reagan later stated his belief that the Soviets feared some of their athletes might defect. As well, President Reagan and his administration agreed to meet all of the demands of the Soviet Union in turn for the Soviet Bloc's attendance at the 1984 Olympics, marking a stark contrast in Reagan's \"hawkish\" views on Cold War foreign policy. As more countries withdrew, the IOC announced on the deadline week that it would consider extending the deadline for entry into the Olympics.Reich, Kenneth. Olympic Entry Deadline Might Be Extended. The LA Times. May 30, 1984. OC3. The three top medal winners from the 1980 Games (which was the subject of a boycott by sixty six nations) in Moscow were among the boycotters, and media analysis noted this would weaken the field of competitors in a number of sports.\u2018East Germany Joins L.A. Olympics Boycott\u2019. Sarasota Herald-Tribune \u2013 May 11, 1984. However, it was later disclosed that both the Soviet Union and East Germany boosted their performances with the help of state-run steroid programs. == Soviet doping plan == Documents obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union's plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country's decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements. The communication, directed to the Soviet Union's head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping program prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics. Filmmaker and director of 2017 movie Icarus Bryan Fogel has said that stricter doping controls might have been the main reason for the Soviet boycott. ==Boycotting countries== Listed in the chronological order of their withdrawal, not by alphabetical or any geographical order. * * Bulgaria * * Mongolia * * * Czechoslovakia * Afghanistan * Hungary * Poland * * * * Ethiopia * Angola Three other countries also boycotted the games, citing political reasons, but were not part of the Soviet-led boycott: * Albania * * Libya Further to this, Kampuchea was largely unrecognized, and in any case would not have been allowed to compete. ==Non-boycotting Marxist-Leninist countries== Seven communist and socialist countries, four from Africa, did not join the Soviet-led boycott and instead sent teams to the 1984 Summer Olympics. * Benin * was somewhat hostile towards the Soviet Union at the time, but had been experiencing a cordial relationship with the United States. In 1980, China had sent a team to the Winter Olympics in the United States, while boycotting the Summer Olympics in the Soviet Union. * Congo * Mozambique * Romania was the only member of the Warsaw Pact that did not boycott the Games. Its leader, Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu, was famous for openly opposing various policies of the Soviet Union; he was awarded the Olympic Order in 1985 for this issue. * Somalia had broken relations with the Soviet Union after the latter's support for Ethiopia in the Ethio-Somali War. * Yugoslavia was a non-aligned country that acted independently of the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia shared friendly relations with both the Soviet Union and the United States, therefore it did not participate in either of the boycotts. It had just hosted the 1984 Winter Olympics. ==Alternative events== The Soviets organized the Friendship Games, a full-scale multi-sport event, for boycotting countries. The Games were contested in 22 Olympic disciplines (all except association football and synchronized swimming), and in non-Olympic table tennis, tennis, and sambo wrestling. The Soviet Union dominated the medal table, winning 126 gold and 282 total medals. ==See also== *1986 Asian Games ==References== Boycott, 1984 Summer Olympics Category:History of sport in East Germany Category:Olympic Games controversies Category:Soviet Union\u2013United States relations Summer Olympics boycott Summer Olympics Boycott, 1984 Category:Eastern Bloc Category:1984 in Soviet sport Category:International sports boycotts ",
