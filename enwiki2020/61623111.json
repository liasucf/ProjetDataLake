The season began on 20 September 2019. Tre Penne were the defending champions after defeating La Fiorita in the previous season's final. The competition was abandoned due to the COVID-19 pandemic in San Marino. Based on league position at the time of abandonment, Tre Fiori were declared champions and selected to play in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Champions League. Folgore and Tre Penne were selected to play in the 2020\u201321 UEFA Europa League. In July, UEFA informed the FSGC that Folgore was ineligible to compete during the 2020\u201321 season.
