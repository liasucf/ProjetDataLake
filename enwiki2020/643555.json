    "text": "The Audi A5 is a series of compact executive coupe cars produced by the German automobile manufacturer Audi since March 2007. The A5 range additionally comprises the coupe, cabriolet, and \"Sportback\" (a five-door liftback with a fastback roofline) version of the Audi A4 saloon and estate models. Under Audi's internal platform numbering convention, the A5 is a member of the B-platform series of vehicles, sharing its platform designation with the A4 saloon and Avant. The first generation A5 (Type 8T) is therefore a member of the B8 family, whilst the second generation model (Type 8W6) is based on the B9. Both are derived from the Volkswagen MLB (Modular Longitudinal Matrix) architecture. ==First generation (2007\u20132016)== ===Initial release=== The A5 marked Audi's return to the compact executive coup\u00e9 market since the (B3/B4) Audi 80 based coup\u00e9 model ended production in 1996. On May 10, 2006, Audi confirmed that the A5 would go into production. The B6/B7 A4 spawned a convertible variant but not a coup\u00e9. For the fourth-generation A4 (B8), Audi decided to spin off the cabriolet, along with a new coup\u00e9 and 4-door fastback sedan, into a nameplate of its own as the A5. The A5 was the first of the B8 family of vehicles to be released (the others being the A4 and the Q5 crossover SUV), all based on the Audi MLP platform (Modular Longitudinal Platform) which underpin the next generation A6 and A8. The A5 is the third coup\u00e9 in Audi's line up, following the second generation TT and the R8. The A5 adopted design elements of the Nuvolari quattro concept car. The A5 debuted with the 3.2 litre FSI V6 engine delivering . ====Coup\u00e9 (8T3)==== The design was based on the Nuvolari quattro concept car. The A5 and the S5 Coup\u00e9 were unveiled simultaneously at the Salon International de l'Auto (Geneva) and Melbourne International Motor Shows on March 6, 2007. Ordering of the A5 and S5 began on March 6, 2007 and the first deliveries were made in June 2007. Launch models included 3.2 FSI V6 engine multitronic and 3.0 TDI quattro 6-speed, with 1.8 TFSI available in autumn 2007. Early U.S. models included the A5 3.2 FSI Quattro and the S5 coup\u00e9 4.2 FSI Quattro. Both included either a six-speed manual or six-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. The S5 model went on sale in November 2007, equipped only with a manual transmission, while the A5 and the Tiptronic went on sale beginning of spring 2008. The A5 went on sale in Canada in 2008, which included A5 3.2 FSI with choice of six speed manual or six speed Tiptronic transmission. Since 2011, only the 2.0 L Turbo engines are available for the A5 in Canada. In 2013 Audi introduced the new A5 Black Edition. ====Cabriolet (8F) (2009\u2013)==== Both the Audi A5 and the S5 Cabriolet (convertible/cabriolet) production began in the beginning of 2009. The A5 Cabriolet included a fabric roof as opposed to a retractable hardtop as on the Volkswagen Eos. The engine ranges are same as contemporary A5 coup\u00e9 models, but S5 Cabriolet came with a 3.0 TFSI V6 supercharged engine. The A5 Cabriolet replaced the A4 Cabriolet. Delivery of A5 Cabriolet began in the second quarter of 2009. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 New York Auto Show. The U.S. versions of A5 and S5 Cabriolet went on sale in September 2009 as a 2010 model. Early models included A5 2.0 I4 TFSI Multitronic, A5 2.0 Quattro Tiptronic, S5 Quattro S-Tronic. ====Sportback (8T8)==== The A5 Sportback has four frameless doors and a long, tapering fastback like roofline, giving it a \"four door coup\u00e9 like\" appearance. While it shares many exterior cues with the A5 coup\u00e9, the Sportback's interior is similar to the A4 saloon; although all A5 models have same platform as the A4, the Sportback is closer in design to the A4 than the rest of the A5 family. The Sportback has been described as \"a saloon with the front end (including an identical S-line look) and taillights of the A5 coup\u00e9 but the wheelbase of the A4\", with the Sportback positioned more as the \"designer's car\" compared to the more conventional A4 saloon. The Sportback model is available in Europe, Japan, South Korea, China, Australia, New Zealand, Middle East, Mexico, Argentina, and South Africa. Although not originally sold in the United States and Canada., the A5 Sportback entered the North American market as a 2018 model in the beginning of 2017. Early production models included 2.0 TFSI quattro , 3.2 FSI quattro, 2.0 TDI with six speed manual gearbox and start/stop system, 2.7 TDI, 3.0 TDI quattro. Production versions went on sale in September 2009. The A5 Sportback is available with two petrol engines and three diesel engines. ====S5 (2007\u2013)==== Audi S5 Coup\u00e9 (8T3, Germany) Audi S5 Cabriolet (8F7, Australia) The Audi S5 was released in coup\u00e9 form to the public at the same time as the A5.

In many markets, the S5 includes as standard, 19-inch alloy wheels with a five parallel spoke design, bigger brakes, heated leather sport seats, and other convenience features, some of which are available only as an option on the A5. Changes for the 2010 model year include LED tail lamps, the introduction of Premium Plus and Prestige trim levels, and new optional equipment such as Leather/Alcantara seats. Despite sharing the same nameplate, the powertrains were different between the coup\u00e9 and the Cabriolet/Sportback for the 2010\u201312 model years. The 2010\u201312 Audi S5 coup\u00e9 had a 4.2 litre fuel stratified injection (FSI) V8 engine that produces , while the S5 Cabriolet and Sportback have a supercharged 3.0 litre TFSI V6 engine producing which is shared with the 2010 Audi S4 3.0 TFSI quattro sedan and avant. The coup\u00e9 had a choice of either a six speed manual or six speed Tiptronic automatic, while the Cabriolet/Sportback has the seven speed S-tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. ====Aluminium A5 Coup\u00e9 (2009)==== The Aluminium A5 Coup\u00e9 is a prototype vehicle demonstrating the aluminum Audi Space Frame (ASF) concept. It is based on Audi A5 Coup\u00e9 2.0 TFSI with engine, but it uses the aluminum Audi Space Frame, aluminum and carbon fiber-reinforced plastics body. Punch riveting, bonding or laser-MIG hybrid welding replaced spot welding. The vehicle is lighter than the equivalent steel-bodied production model. The vehicle was built by Audi's Aluminium and Lightweight Design Centre in Neckarsulm. ====RS5 (2010\u20132015)==== Audi RS5 coupe Audi RS5 coupe Available in coup\u00e9 body, the RS5 features a 4.2 FSI engine rated at at 8250 rpm and at 4000-6000 rpm, coupled with a seven-speed S-Tronic transmission and quattro permanent all-wheel-drive with crown-gear centre differential and electronic torque vectoring. It has 19 inch alloy wheels in an exclusive five arm structure design with 275/35 tires (optional 19 inch winter wheels), diameter ventilated aluminum front brake discs (optional diameter carbon ceramic front brake discs), aluminum 8 piston brake calipers with RS logos in high-gloss black, electronic stabilization program with integrated sport mode, speed dependent servotronic steering, Audi drive select with three (4 with MMI navigation system) modes of operation (comfort, auto, and dynamic, optional custom), and optional dynamic steering. Aesthetically, the RS5 features a single-frame grille with a shiny charcoal gray rhombus pattern grid, Xenon plus headlights with a sweeping strip of LED daytime running lights, redesigned bumper tapers downward into a splitter, flared fenders inspired by Audi Quattro, side sills with angular caps, trim strips with aluminum look on the single-frame grille and near the side windows and the outside mirrors; a choice of 8 body colours, two oval exhaust pipes integrated within the bumper, spoiler in the tailgate automatically extends at and retracts at , extensively clad underbody integrating air vents for the seven-speed S-Tronic and the front brakes.

The RS5 weighs , with 56.3 percent at the front and 43.7 in the rear which makes it prone to understeer, however, Audi has added two electro-mechanical systems to counter its nose-heaviness. The stability-control system attempts to stop front-end plow before it happens by squeezing the brakes on the inside wheels which effectively drag those tires enough to pull the car into the corner. The RS5 also has an active rear differential that can apportion power between the rear wheels to create a similar effect or even oversteer; in normal conditions, Quattro all-wheel- drive delivers 60% of the engine\u2019s torque rearward and rising to as much as 85 percent depending on conditions. According to Quattro GmbH chief Stephan Reil, the 4.2 FSI engine is based upon Audi's 5.2 FSI V10 engine (found in the D3 Audi S8 and Audi R8) with two cylinders removed.
