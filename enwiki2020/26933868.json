The station is owned by Quincy Media. ==History== The station signed on August 1, 1947 as WQDI. It was Quincy Newspapers' first broadcasting station, signing on five months before WGEM; it was also the first FM station in the market. The WQDI callsign was retained until 1953, when the station became WGEM-FM to match the AM station and WGEM- TV. For much of its early history, WGEM-FM was a simulcast of WGEM. This ended by 1976, when the station implemented a country music format; \"Gem Country\" lasted until 2002, when it gave way to the current news/talk format. ==Programming== WGEM-FM's schedule includes the two-hour morning show WGEM News Talk Live!, several news-oriented local programs, as well as simulcasts of WGEM-TV's newscasts and NBC Nightly News. The station also carries some syndicated talk shows, including The Dave Ramsey Show, The Clark Howard Show,The Kim Komando Show, and The O'Reilly Update. WGEM-FM also carries St. Louis Cardinals baseball. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Quincy Media GEM-FM Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1947 Category:1947 establishments in Illinois ",
