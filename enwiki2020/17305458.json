    "text": "Children's Discovery Museum is a museum in Bangkok, Thailand. The museum, which is targeted at children, opened in 2001 on the northern edge of the Chatuchak Weekend Market. The museum has eight different sections in three buildings, providing hands on experience into science, nature, culture and society. In the first building \"Tortawan Building\", there is the Body and Mind Gallery which provides children with the knowledge about their own physiology and mechanics of the human brain and body. At the Culture and Society Gallery, there are realistic displays of traditional drums, languages and folk music from Thailand and other parts of the world. There is a small music room for practice. The Technology Gallery demonstrates technology such as electricity and appliances, auto engines, and radio and television production. In the second building \"Sairoong\", is the big backyard, creative library and auditorium. In the third building \"Chakkravan\", the Nature and Environment gallery which teaches children about living species and biodiversity. On Sunday, 19 Sept, 2010, the Museum was closed, due to financial and operational management issues. Extensive redevelopment and modernisation has been recommended by a working committee set up by the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration with a target of reopening parts of the Museum in late 2012/early 2013. ==References== Category:Museums in Bangkok Category:Children's museums Category:Museums established in 2001 Category:2001 establishments in Thailand Category:Defunct museums Category:Child-related organizations in Thailand ",
