    "text": "Callum Smith (born 13 November 1999) is a Scottish footballer who plays as a forward for Hamilton Academical, Smith has previously played for Alloa Athletic, Arbroath, Airdrieonians and Dunfermline Athletic. ==Career== Smith was educated at Beath High School and began his career with Cowdenbeath's youth squad, before moving to Dunfermline Athletic, nicknamed the Pars, to join the Under 15s side. Smith then continued his development with the Fife Elite Football Academy, after the amalgamation of Fife's football clubs' youth sides into one academy. In 2016, Smith returned to the Pars, signing a one- year contract with the club to play for the side's development squad. His first appearance for the first-team came in the Scottish League Cup, where he came on as a 78th-minute substitute for Michael Moffat in the 5\u20131 loss to Inverness Caledonian Thistle at East End Park. Smith impressed with his performances for the youth side, becoming the club's top scorer in the SPFL Development League, which resulted in him making his first league appearance against Greenock Morton. Smith replaced Nicky Clark in the 82nd minute, and made an immediate impact, setting up Rhys McCabe, assisting in Dunfermline's third goal. With the club deciding not to participate in the 2017\u201318 SPFL Development League, Smith was promoted to the first team for the 2017\u201318 season. He played in all four Scottish League Cup group stage matches, scoring his first goal for the Pars in a 6\u20130 win against Elgin City. His full debut came in the final match of the group stage against Hearts at Tynecastle. With main striker Nicky Clark injured, Smith started alongside Declan McManus, who he provided an assist for to put the Pars 2\u20131 ahead. Smith joined Scottish League One club Alloa Athletic on loan at the end of January 2018, helping the side to a third place finish and victory in the Championship play-offs over Dumbarton. In August 2018, Smith joined League One club Arbroath on a season long loan; despite being sidelined for two months with an injury, he made nine appearances before his loan was cut short in January 2019. At the beginning of the 2019\u201320 season, Smith moved on a season-long loan to Airdrieonians as part of a deal that saw Josh Edwards sign for Dunfermline. Smith left Dunfermline after the curtailed 2019\u201320 season, and signed a two-year contract with Hamilton Academical in June 2020. ==Personal life== Smith's brother, Connor, is also a footballer. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Dunfermline Athletic |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"4\"|Scottish Championship |2||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||3||0 |- |2017\u201318 |13||2||0||0||4||1||2Appearances in the Scottish Challenge Cup||0||19||3 |- |2018\u201319 |3||0||0||0||0||0||1||1||4||1 |- |2019\u201320 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !18!!2!!0!!0!!5!!1!!3!!1!!26!!4 |- |Alloa Athletic (loan) |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"3\"|Scottish League One |14||1||0||0||0||0||4Appearances in the Scottish Championship play-offs||0||18||1 |- |Arbroath (loan) |2018\u201319 |9||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||9||0 |- |Airdrieonians (loan) |2019\u201320 |27||4||0||0||3||1||3||1||30||6 |- |Hamilton Academical |2020\u201321 |Scottish Premiership |7||0||0||0||2||0||0||0||9||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !75!!7!!0!!0!!10!!2!!10!!2!!92!!11 |} ==References== ==External links== *UEFA profile at UEFA Category:1999 births Category:Living people Category:People from Cowdenbeath Category:People educated at Beath High School Category:Scottish footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Dunfermline Athletic F.C. players Category:Alloa Athletic F.C. players Category:Arbroath F.C. players Category:Airdrieonians F.C. players Category:Hamilton Academical F.C. players Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:Scotland youth international footballers ",
