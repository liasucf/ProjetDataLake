GBR Athletics. Retrieved 2019-07-14. The event was first held in 1920, two years after the foundation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and events for women were added to the schedule in 1923. The championships continued with the post-war Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia state. Participation diminished as various regions broke away from the country and set up their own national championships. From 1992 onwards, only Serbian and Montenegrin athletes took part. The Yugoslavian Championships ceased in 2003 with the renaming of the remnant constituents of the Yugoslavia as Serbia and Montenegro that year. Separate annual championship events were held for cross country running, road running and racewalking events.
