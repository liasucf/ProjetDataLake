    "text": "The Chatsbury/Bungonia bushfires of 1965 was a series of bushfires that burned from 5 to 14 March 1965 in the Southern Highlands region of New South Wales, Australia. The fires destroyed the villages of Tallong, Wingello, and most of the surrounding orchards. The fire is thought to be ignited by a spark from a Chatsbury Station angle grinder. It quickly spread and covered and destroyed the areas' livestock. It is thought to be the greatest disaster in the area. Three people were killed. 28 homes were destroyed in Tallong, 31 in Wingello. The fire was eventually stopped (or burnt out) near Nowra on the NSW South Coast. ==References== Category:Bushfires in New South Wales Category:1965 fires Category:1965 in Australia Category:1960s wildfires Category:1965 natural disasters Category:1960s in New South Wales Category:March 1965 events Category:1960s disasters in Australia ",
