John Andrews, D.D. In 1787, the school received its charter from the General Assembly of Pennsylvania and was incorporated as the York County Academy.York College of Pennsylvania. By Carol McCleary Innerst. 2008. P.30. The Academy held a close connection with St. John's Church in York from that time until 1799. Thaddeus Stevens taught at the academy in 1815\u20131816, prior to establishing his law practice and serving as a U.S. congressman. York College also traces its roots to a second institution, the York Collegiate Institute (YCI), which was founded around 1872. The building that housed the Institute, located on the corner of College Avenue and Duke Street, was destroyed by fire in December 1885. A new four- story building designed by architects John A. Dempwolf and Reinhardt Dempwolf was completed at the same location in late 1886. The building was demolished in 1969 after being sold. In 1929, the York County Academy and YCI entered into a teaching agreement, then in 1941 merged to become York Junior College. Under its new charter, the combined institution shifted its focus from elementary and secondary education to post-secondary education. At this point, the school began to outgrow its campus, forcing a move outside of downtown York. In 1965, the current campus, located in Spring Garden Township, was dedicated. The former occupier of these lands was the Outdoor Country Club and golf course, which moved north of the City after selling its property. The campus is located about 100 miles west of Philadelphia and 52 miles north of Baltimore. By 1968, York College established an accredited four-year bachelor's degree program, and officially became York College of Pennsylvania. In 1975, York College absorbed York Country Day School (YCDS), thereby expanding its mission to again encompass K-12 education. YCDS was founded in 1953 by former YCI faculty after YCI phased out the elementary and secondary programs. Today the College sits near the historic center of York City, with some of its residence halls located in the city, which is known as the first national capital of the United States of America and the birthplace of Articles of Confederation. ==Campus== York College is currently located on three adjacent campuses with the majority of its academic buildings on the Main Campus, a few on its more recently built West Campus and several facilities on its North Campus. Despite the College's extensive history, all the buildings on campus are less than 50 years of age, with the majority being built during the 1960s. The buildings utilize a standard red brickwork style, enhanced with white marble on some buildings. Some buildings on campus were financed with the College's cash savings in order to avoid debt as part of an overall focus on maintaining low tuition rates. ===Main campus=== Students walking to class on a fall day The focal point of York College's 190-acre park-like campus is the mall, a grassy quad around which many of the College's academic buildings are located. The Evelyn and Earle Wolf Hall is the center for artistic activity on campus. It includes three art studios, a photography facility, rehearsal and practice rooms, multi-track recording studio and mixing control room, music library, edit suites, studios, two video production facilities coordinated by a computer assisted control room, and DeMeester Recital Hall, a venue that hosts various speakers as well as performances by many of the College's musical ensembles. Also located in Wolf Hall are the York College Galleries. Comprising two adjacent galleries, the Cora Miller Gallery and the Brossman Gallery, this exhibition space serve the College, the City of York, and the communities of southcentral Pennsylvania and northern Maryland. The Galleries feature a varied program of nationally touring exhibitions and invitational shows, as well as faculty and juried student shows, artist and curator lectures, workshops, book signings, and other events. Located adjacent to Wolf is Campbell Hall, home to the Student Success Division, which includes the Academic Advising Center, Academic Support Center, Career Development Center, Community Scholarship Program, Student Accessibility Services, Study Abroad Center, Undeclared Student Advising, and the Writing Center. Campbell also includes chemistry instrumentation to support majors in Chemistry, Forensic Chemistry and Pre-Med.leftNext to Campbell is the Appell Life Sciences Building, which features modern laboratory spaces, multiple specialty spaces (tissue culture suite, microscopy lab, walk-in cold room), research and preparation spaces, and student and faculty conference rooms for the departments of Biological Sciences, Behavioral Sciences and Education.

Schmidt Library, located to the right of Willman on the mall, houses print and online collections, as well as the College's Archives. Schmidt Library loans out wireless laptops for use in the building, digital cameras, camcorders, and media projection materials. The building also provides quiet study floors, technology-enhanced group study rooms, comfortable lounge areas, and wireless network connections including the outdoor courtyard. The Library underwent extensive interior renovations in 2004, adding 17 group study areas along with infrastructure and equipment to facilitate an increased focus on digital media. The Waldner Performing Arts Center (WPAC) and Humanities Center occupy the space between the Schmidt Library and the Iosue Student Union. The Waldner Performing Arts Center, which opened in Fall 2008, features the 705-seat York Collegiate Theatre and the 125-seat Perko Playpen Theatre, an experimental black box-type theatre.

He himself worked weekends and took no vacations for eight years. The Student Senate is the executive and administrative agency for York College students and embodies a unique system of government.

These are one of the more popular clothing items sold by the York College Bookstore. ==References== ==External links== * * York College of Pennsylvania official athletics website Category:Buildings and structures in York, Pennsylvania Category:1787 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Eastern Pennsylvania Rugby Union Category:Educational institutions established in 1787 Category:Universities and colleges in York County, Pennsylvania Category:Private universities and colleges in Pennsylvania ",
