It's a common dish found in many regions and cultures, within West Asia including Iran, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. ==Etymology== The spelling of the name of this dish varies in English and can include ashe doogh and ash-e dugh. There are some alternative terms for this soup, including ayran ashi and ash-e mast. ==Ingredients== Ash-e doogh is a soup usually made with yogurt or doogh, as well as different kind of herbs (such as coriander, leek, tarragon, mint, and parsley), vegetables (such as spinach, purslane, chickpeas, peas, onion and garlic), lamb meatballs, eggs, rice, salt and several types of spices. Fried mint with oil (and sometime garlic) is used as a topping for the soup. This soup can be made vegetarian. ==Variations== Some people prefer to make this soup with yogurt whereas others prefer doogh, a savory soda yogurt. The soup is made with sweet yogurt, while the soda yogurt is sour. There is a very similar Assyrian dish called bushala, which is similar soup to ash-e-doogh in that it also contains yogurt and green vegetables. Bushala is consumed by Assyrian people of Iran and Iraq, though it may feature some different ingredients. == See also == * List of soups * List of yogurt-based dishes and beverages * \u0100sh, a genre of soup dishes from Iran * Ash reshteh, Iranian noodle soup * Dovga, a similar Azerbaijani yogurt soup * Tarator, a similar Balkans dish * Toyga soup, a similar Turkish ==References== Category:Iranian soups Category:Assyrian cuisine ",
