It is a Grade II* listed building. ==History== Gerald of Wales records that a church at Bryngywn was built by Aeddan Gwaethfoed, the Lord of Clytha in 1180. The current building dates mainly from the 15th century. The church was restored in 1871 by John Prichard. Throughout that time, the rector was the Reverend William Crawley, who served from 1834 to 1896, a period of 62 years. Near to the church is a well, also dedicated to St Peter, which was for many years the only water supply for the church and village. ==Architecture and description== The church is constructed of sandstone rubble in a Perpendicular style. ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== Bryngwyn Category:History of Monmouthshire Bryngwyn Bryngwyn ",
