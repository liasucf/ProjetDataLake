    "text": "Sophie Ballantine Hawkins (born November 1, 1964) is an American singer- songwriter, musician and painter. Born in New York City, she attended the Manhattan School of Music for a year as a percussionist before leaving to pursue a music career. She achieved critical and commercial success with her first two albums, producing a string of single hits including \"Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover\", \"Right Beside You\", and \"As I Lay Me Down\". However, a dispute with her record label Sony Music over her third album, Timbre, caused her to establish her own independent label, Trumpet Swan Productions, which has published her subsequent recordings. Hawkins is a vegan and a long-time supporter of animal rights and environmental causes. She is also a well-known social and political activist, supporting events promoting women in music and LGBT rights. In 2008, she endorsed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. ==Career== Hawkins's debut album, Tongues and Tails, was released in 1992. It achieved both worldwide commercial success and critical acclaim, earning her a Grammy Award nomination for Best New Artist in 1993. The single \"Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover\" went to #5 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in the USA and was also a Top 20 hit in the UK. Hawkins was asked to perform Bob Dylan's \"I Want You,\" which she covered on Tongues and Tails, for the 1992 Madison Square Garden concert honoring Dylan's 30th anniversary as a musician; this was later released as The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration. Whaler, her second album, was released in 1994. Produced by Stephen Lipson, it also contained a US top 10 hit, \"As I Lay Me Down,\" and was certified gold. Three singles from the album made the UK Top 40, including \"Right Beside You,\" which peaked at #13. The same year, Hawkins posed nude for Interview.Interview, February 1994, volume 24 n2, p. 122 As she explained to Ed Rampell when he interviewed her for Q magazine, she met the photographer, Bruce Weber, and was asked if she would do a photoshoot with him. While she had provided her own clothes, Weber deliberately had her wear an unflattering dress as part of his plan to convince Hawkins to disrobe during the shoot. A 1998 documentary by Gigi Gaston, titled The Cream Will Rise, followed Hawkins during one of her tours and captured her struggle to deal with past troubles with her family, including her mother and brother. Music by Hawkins was included throughout the film. Also in 1998, Hawkins's record company, Sony Music, delayed the release of her third album. Its executives were unhappy with the finished product and wanted Hawkins to rework some of the material. In particular, they insisted that Hawkins remove a banjo track from one of the songs. Hawkins refused to accommodate them, citing artistic integrity as her main reason. After a lengthy battle between Hawkins and the company, the album, Timbre, was eventually released in 1999, though Sony declined to promote it. Hawkins subsequently left the label and founded her own label, Trumpet Swan Productions. In 2001, Timbre was re-released on Hawkins's label, now as a two- disc set that contained new songs, demos, remixes, and videos. Her first independently recorded and released album, Wilderness, was released in 2004. In 2012, Hawkins starred as Janis Joplin in the play, Room 105, which was written and directed by her longtime girlfriend and manager, Gigi Gaston. After another long hiatus, she released her fifth album of all-new material in 2012, titled The Crossing. On April 4, 2013, Hawkins appeared on the TV series Community as herself, performing \"Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover\" and \"As I Lay Me Down\" during the community college's \"Sophie B. Hawkins Dance,\" so named because they confused the singer with Susan B. Anthony. Hawkins appeared at the German TV show Night Grooves, in 2019, singing several songs, discussing her past, and showing off her drumming talent. ==Personal life== Hawkins has two children, Dashiell (b. 2008) and Esther Ballantine (b. 2015). Esther was conceived using an embryo she had frozen 20 years earlier. In an interview with Rock Cellar Magazine in 2012, Hawkins said that she identified as omnisexual.Rampell, Ed.

Hawkins is a vegan and a long-time supporter of animal rights. In February 2008, Hawkins re-recorded her hit \"Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover\" as \"Damn, We Wish You Were President\" in support of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Hawkins also wrote in her blog, \"Hillary Clinton's achievements come from her heart. She has initiated so much positive change for families, children, victims of crime and the environment in her struggle for the forward movement of America and the working people of this nation.\" In May 2010, Hawkins began supporting Waterkeeper Alliance, an organization of on-the-water advocates who patrol and protect more than 100,000 miles of rivers, streams and coastlines in North and South America, Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa. She donated 100% of the proceeds of her single \"The Land, the Sea, and the Sky\" to the organization.
