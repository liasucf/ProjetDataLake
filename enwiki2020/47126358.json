    "text": "The Ameripolitan Music Awards, spearheaded by internationally acclaimed Texas Troubador, Dale Watson, were established as an annual celebration devoted to acknowledging and honoring the Ameripolitan music genre. Ameripolitan music is defined as original music with prominent roots influence, encompassing four subgenres of music (honky-tonk, western swing, rockabilly, and outlaw) that did not previously fit into any celebrated categories within the mainstream pop country music industry. The awards are funded predominantly by fan supported donations and include 16 different award categories, with special honorary awards also presented. The Vintage Industrial Bar was home to the 2014 Ameripolitan Festival (Europe) on December 13, 2014 in Zagreb, Croatia. ==2016 Ameripolitan Award Winners== The third annual Ameripolitan Music Awards Ceremony was held at The Paramount and Stateside Theatres on February 16, 2016 in Austin, Tex..http://365thingsaustin.com/event/the-third-annual- ameripolitan-music-awards/ * Master Award: Charley Pride * Founder of the Sound: Red Simpson * Founder of the Sound: Wanda Jackson * Honky Tonk Female: Margo Price * Honky Tonk Male: Charlie Thompson * Honky Tonk Group: Jeff Woolsey and the Dancehall Kings * Outlaw Female: Bonnie Montgomery * Outlaw Male: Whitey Morgan * Outlaw Group: Jason Boland & The Stragglers * Western Swing Female: Carolyn Martin * Western Swing Male: Jason Roberts * Western Swing Group: Billy Mata and the Texas Tradition * Rockabilly Female: Marti Brom * Rockabilly Male: Wayne Hancock * Rockabilly Group: The Bellfuries * Ameripolitan Musician: Jason Roberts * Ameripolitan Venue: The White Horse, Austin, Tex. * Ameripolitan DJ: Ted Branson, (KOOP Radio) * Ameripolitan Festival: San Angelo Cowboy Gathering, San Angelo, Tex.http://kokefm.com/who- won-at-the-ameripolitan-awards/ ==2015 Ameripolitan Award Winners== The second annual Ameripolitan Music Awards Ceremony was held at The Paramount and Stateside Theatres on February 17, 2015 in Austin, Tex.. * Founder of the Sound: James Burton * Founder of the Sound: Billy Joe Shaver * Keeper of the Key: High Noon * The Mooney Award: Kenny Sears - Fiddle * Western Swing Group: Hot Club of Cowtown * Western Swing Female: Elana James * Western Swing Male: Bobby Flores * Honky-tonk Group: The Derailers * Honky-tonk Female: Amber Digby * Honky-tonk Male: James Hand * Rockabilly Group: Big Sandy & His Fly- Rite Boys * Rockabilly Female: Kim Lenz * Rockabilly Male: James Intveld * Outlaw Group: The Freightshakers * Outlaw Female: Sarah Gayle Meech * Outlaw Male: Jesse Dayton * Venue: The Continental Club, Austin, Tex. * Festival: Legends of Western Swing Music Festival, Wichita Falls, Tex. * DJ: Mojo Nixon, Sirius XM Outlaw == 2014 Ameripolitan Awards Winners == The inaugural Ameripolitan Music Awards Ceremony was held on Tuesday, February 18, 2014 at the Wyndham Garden Hotel in Austin, Tex.. * Master Award: Ray Price * Founder of the Sound: Johnny Bush * Founder of the Sound: W.S. \u201cFluke\u201d Holland * The Mooney Award: Cindy Cashdollar * Person of the Year: David Letterman * Western Swing Group: Asleep at the Wheel * Western Swing Female: Dawn Sears * Western Swing Male: Ray Benson * Honky-tonk Group: Heybale * Honky-tonk Female: Rosie Flores * Honky-tonk Male: Wayne \"the Train\" Hancock * Rockabilly Group: The Reverend Horton Heat * Rockabilly Female: Rosie Flores * Rockabilly Male: Big Sandy * Outlaw Group: Whitey Morgan and the 78's * Outlaw Female: Elizabeth Cook * Outlaw Male: Unknown Hinson * Venue: The Broken Spoke * Festival: Muddy Roots * DJ: Dallas Wayne, SIRIUS Satellite Radio ==References== Category:American music awards Category:2014 establishments in the United States ",
