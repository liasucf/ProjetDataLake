    "text": "Ang Chan ( ; 1791 \u2013 7 January 1835) was king of Cambodia from 1806 to his death in 1835. He reigned under the name of Outey Reachea III (). Ang Chan II was the eldest son of Ang Eng. Ang Eng died in 1796 when Ang Chan II was only five years old. Prince Talaha Pok (, ) was appointed the regent of Cambodia. Ang Chan II was not allowed to go to Cambodia until Pok died in 1806. In 1806, Ang Chan II was crowned king by Siamese. His two brothers, Ang Em and Ang Snguon, were pro-Siamese. In order to gain power from the two brothers, Ang Chan got closer to the Vietnamese. In the next year, he started to pay tribute to Vietnam. Two Vietnamese officials, Ng\u00f4 Nh\u00e2n T\u1ecbnh and Tr\u1ea7n C\u00f4ng \u0110\u00e0n, came to Longvek and granted him the title Cao Mi\u00ean qu\u1ed1c v\u01b0\u01a1ng (\"king of Cambodia\"). Siamese demanded Ang Chan to appoint Ang Snguon and Ang Em as the uprayorach and ouparach respectively but Ang Chan refused. In 1811, with the help of Siamese, Ang Snguon overthrew him. Ang Chan fled to Saigon. His two brothers were appointed the regent by Siamese. In 1813, a Vietnamese army under L\u00ea V\u0103n Duy\u1ec7t invaded Cambodia and captured Oudong. Ang Chan returned with the Vietnamese army. Ang Em and Ang Snguon fled to Bangkok. After the rebellion, Cambodia was put under protection of Vietnam. Vietnamese built two castles, Nam Vang (Phnom Penh) and La Y\u00eam (Lvea Aem), to station their forces. 1000 men under Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Tho\u1ea1i were sent to Phnom Penh to \"protect\" him. He was ordered to collect Cambodian Royal Chronicles in 1818. In 1819, Ang Chan sent 5,000 Khmer labours to reconstruct the Vietnamese V\u0129nh T\u1ebf Canal. An anti- Vietnamese rebellion broke out in the next year, but was put down by Vietnamese army. Ang Chan died in 1834, his second daughter Ang Mey was installed the queen. ==Sources== * Achille Dauphin-Meunier Histoire du Cambodge Que sais-je ?
