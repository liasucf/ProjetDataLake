    "text": "\u011e (g with breve) is a Latin letter found in the Turkish and Azerbaijani alphabets as well as the Latin alphabets of Laz, Crimean Tatar and Tatar. It traditionally represented the voiced velar fricative or (in case of Tatar) the similar voiced uvular fricative in all those languages. However, in Turkish, the phoneme has in most cases been reduced to a silent letter, serving as a vowel-lengthener. == Turkish use == === Current use === In Turkish, the (sometimes represented with for convenience) is known as yumu\u015fak ge (; 'soft g') and is the ninth letter of the Turkish alphabet. It always follows a vowel, and can be compared to the bl\u00f8dt g ('soft g') in Danish. The letter serves as a transition between two vowels, since they do not occur consecutively in native Turkish words (in loanwords they may sometimes be separated by a glottal stop, e.g. cemaat or cema\u00e2t, meaning 'community', from Arabic, which may be pronounced as either or ). It generally has no sound of its own, with its effect varying depending on its location in a word and the surrounding vowels: {| class=\"wikitable floatright\" ! colspan=\"2\"| |- ! a\u011f | |- ! e\u011f | |- ! i\u011f | |- ! \u0131\u011f | |- ! o\u011f | |- ! u\u011f | |- ! \u00f6\u011f | |- ! \u00fc\u011f | |- ! colspan=\"2\"| |- ! a\u011fa | |- ! \u0131\u011f\u0131 | |- ! u\u011fu | |- ! colspan=\"2\"| |- ! e\u011fe | |- ! i\u011fi | |- ! \u00fc\u011f\u00fc | |- ! colspan=\"2\"| |- ! a\u011fu | |- ! o\u011fa | |- ! o\u011fu | |- ! u\u011fa | |- ! \u00f6\u011fe | |- ! \u00f6\u011f\u00fc | |- ! \u00fc\u011fe | |- ! colspan=\"2\"| |- ! a\u011f\u0131 | |- ! \u0131\u011fa | |- ! e\u011fi | |- ! i\u011fe | |} * in word-final and syllable-final positions it lengthens the preceding vowel, for example: da\u011f(lar) (\"mountain(s)\") , s\u0131\u011f (\"shallow\") ; when following a front vowel (e, i), it may sound instead: de\u011fnek (\"cane\") ; * between identical back vowels (a, \u0131, u) it is silent: s\u0131\u011f\u0131nak (\"shelter\") , u\u011fur (\"good luck\") ; * between identical front vowels (e, i, \u00fc) it is either silent: sevdi\u011fim (\"that I love\") , or pronounced : d\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn (\"wedding\") ; * between different rounded vowels (o, u, \u00f6, \u00fc), or between rounded (o, u, \u00f6, \u00fc) and unrounded (a, e) vowels it is mostly silent, but may be a bilabial glide: so\u011fuk (\"cold\") or , so\u011fan (\"onion\") or ; * a\u011f\u0131 may sound as two vowels or as long a: a\u011f\u0131r (\"heavy\") or ; * \u0131\u011fa is always two vowels: s\u0131\u011fan (\"which fits\") ; * in e\u011fi and i\u011fe it is either silent or pronounced as if written y: de\u011fil (\"not\") , di\u011fer (\"other\") ; in colloquial speech e\u011fi is long i: de\u011fil (\"not\") ; * e\u011fi and a\u011f\u0131 in the future suffix -(y)AcAK- are formally / or colloquially /: sevece\u011fim (\"I will love\") or ; yazaca\u011f\u0131m (\"I will write\") or .

The sound change is not yet complete in some Turkish dialects. The previous consonantal nature of the sound is evinced by earlier English loanwords from Turkish, such as yogurt/yoghurt (modern Turkish yo\u011furt) and agha (modern Turkish a\u011fa), and the corresponding velar fricative found in cognate words in the closely related Azerbaijani language and the Turkish-influenced Crimean Tatar language. In Old Turkic (as well as earlier during Proto-Turkic times), this voiced velar fricative originated as an allophone of , the voiced velar stop, when it occurred intervocalically. The expected process of lenition (weakening and eventual loss of the intervocalic Proto-Turkic consonant *) is thus complete in Turkish and underway in many other Common Turkic languages. ==Azerbaijani and Crimean Tatar use== In Azerbaijani and Crimean Tatar, represents , the voiced velar fricative. == Laz use == Laz is written using two alphabets: the Georgian script and an extended Turkish Latin alphabet. In the Latin alphabet, represents , the voiced velar fricative, and corresponds to the Georgian letter ghani. == Tatar use == The Tatar language is mainly written in Cyrillic, but a Latin-based alphabet is also in use. In the Latin alphabet, \u011f represents , the voiced uvular fricative. == Kazakh use == It's scheduled by Tokayev in 2020 to, instead of \u01f4, to use this alphabet to replace the Cyrillic \u0492, and to represent the IPA //. ==Character encoding== ==See also== * \u01e6 (g with caron) * \u0120ayn (Arabic) * Ghayn (Cyrillic) ==References== Category:Latin letters with diacritics Category:Turkish language ",
