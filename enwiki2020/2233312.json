    "text": "Saint Clement (J\u00e8rriais: Saint Cli\u00e9ment) is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey in the Channel Islands. It is in the south east of the Island, and contains some of the suburbs of Saint Helier. It is the smallest parish by surface area, but the second most densely populated. St. Clement stretches west to east from Le Dicq to within a quarter mile of La Rocque harbour (at the end of Rue de la Lourderie). Its surface area is around . The parish is subdivided into three vingtaines, and is administered at local level by the Conn\u00e9table. ==History== The round tower at Le Hocq is a prominent coastal landmark Much of the parish lies below equinoctial high-tide level and was frequently flooded before Le Dicq was built to try to hold back the sea somewhat. There are remains of a submerged forest underneath the sand at Gr\u00e8ve d'Azette that show how the parish has reduced in size as the sea has advanced. Large floods in 1688, 1796 and 1812 led to the coast road at Le Hocq being swept away by the sea and necessitated the coast road being rebuilt further inland. In pre-Norman times, the area now known as St. Clement was known as Petravilla or Pierreville. In 1172 it was recorded that a chapel existed in the parish, and there was a priory on the site of the old Priory Inn (now houses). In the 16th and 17th centuries the parish was believed to be the centre of a witch movement. According to beliefs, the rock at Rocque Berg (known as the Witches' Rock) was the focus for witchcraft in Jersey and witches would assemble there for their sabbats on Friday nights. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, many French Protestants settled in the parish \u2013 as recorded on the church register. In the mid 19th century, the town began to spread east from St. Helier into the west of the parish. Today there is relatively little open green space (with the exception of the golf and football fields) west of Samar\u00e8s Lane into St. Helier. The famous French writer Victor Hugo lived in Marina Terrace, St. Clement for some time, and it was here that he wrote his collection of poems entitled Les Ch\u00e2timents. It was the Conn\u00e9table of St. Clement at the time who escorted Hugo onto a steamer bound for Guernsey when he had insulted the British Royal Family in some of his letters.Balleine, 1970 ==Vingtaines== The parish is divided into vingtaines for administrative purposes as follows: *La Grande Vingtaine *La Vingtaine du Rocquier *La Vingtaine de Samar\u00e8s The parish forms one electoral district and elects two Deputies. ==Demographics== View of housing in the parish in 2012 The population of St. Clement, according to the 2011 census is 9,221.2011 census results ==Politics== Aside from the two deputies who sit in the States of Jersey and represent the parish, St. Clement also has its own local administration. This, like each of the other eleven parishes, is made up of a Conn\u00e9table, who is elected for a three-year term and has a seat in the States Chamber, and on the Comit\u00e9 des Conn\u00e9tables; two Procureurs du Bien Public, who are also elected and oversee the finances of the parish; a Recteur (or Rector), responsible for the parish church; members of the parish Honorary Police (made up of Centeniers, Vingteniers and Constable's Officers); and other officers such as churchwardens, roads inspectors, rates assessors and a registrar. The current Conn\u00e9table of St. Clement is Mr. Len Norman. The seat of the parish administration is the Salle Paroissiale, or Parish Hall, which is pictured above and located at Le Hocq. This is the newest parish hall in the island; the previous parish hall in St. Clement was located at Caldwell Hall, on La Grande Route de St Cl\u00e9ment (St. Clement's Inner Road). ==Education== Le Rocquier School in 2013. St. Clement has two primary schools and one secondary school within its borders. Le Rocquier School is a secondary school, on La Grande Route de St Clement. The original school buildings were replaced with a new building in 2006. The parish school of St. Clement is located on Rue de la Chapelle, a short distance from Le Rocquier School. The original buildings dates back to 1901, and was replaced in 2006 with a brand new building on the opposite side of the road. Samar\u00e8s School (formerly Le Squez School) is the other primary school, which is located further east in School Road.Samares Primary School ==Churches== The Samar\u00e8s Methodist Church building in 2012. The parish church of St. ClementSt. Clement's Church is an ancient place of Anglican worship located on La Grande Route de St Cl\u00e9ment (St. Clement's inner road). St. Nicholas is a smaller, sister church, located on La Grande Route de la C\u00f4te (the coast road). It was opened in 1927 after being planned, financed and largely built by the Reverend L.B. Lee. The St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church is located on La Grande Route de St Cl\u00e9ment at Samar\u00e8s. The Samar\u00e8s Methodist ChurchSamares Methodist Church is located on La Grande Route de la C\u00f4te, and is the southernmost church in the British Isles. However, as of February 2012, there are no longer any religious services at the church, but the church remains open for use as a community centre. ==Significant sites== La Motte is a tidal island and archaeological site The dolmen at Mont Ub\u00e9 (off La Blinerie) is believed to have been left there by a pre-Celtic race called the Iberians, in around 3,000 B.C. Remains of a cemetery on La Motte (Green Island) are believed to be from later settlers. A Neolithic cairn and middens on La Motte have also been investigated. Samar\u00e8s Manor (J\u00e8rriais: Mangni d'Sanmath\u00e8s) is a manor house with medieval origins in the Vingtaine de Samar\u00e8s, and is the traditional home of the Seigneur de Samar\u00e8s. The name Samar\u00e8s is an old French word meaning salt-marsh, and much of the low lying surrounding areas are or were coastal marshes. Le Hocq Tower was built in 1778 as a coastal defence against the French when they sided with the American colonies against the British. The whole rocky inter-tidal zone that stretches along St. Clement's coast from St. Saviour to Grouville is part of a Ramsar site of special significance. Seymour Tower sits two miles offshore on one of the largest inter-tidal reefs in the world. Built as part of Jersey\u2019s coastal defences, this square tower dates from the 18th century.Jersey Heritage - Seymour Tower ==Notable residents== * Philip Dumaresq * Louisa Journeaux * Cecil Stanley Harrison ==References== * Balleine, G.R., 1970.
