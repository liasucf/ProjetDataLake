    "text": "\"'\" (Alone to God in the Highest be glory) is an early Lutheran hymn, with text and melody attributed to Nikolaus Decius. It was intended as a German version of the Gloria part of the Latin mass. Decius wrote three stanzas, probably in 1523, while a fourth was added probably by Joachim Sl\u00fcter. \"\" is included in many German hymnals, including the current Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch and (three stanzas) in the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob. Catherine Winkworth translated the hymn to \"All glory be to God on high\". == History == From the Easter mass \"\" is a paraphrase of the Latin Gloria from the mass liturgy. The oldest prints of the hymn do not mention an author, but it is believed that it was written in Low German by Nikolaus Decius in 1523, which makes it one of the earliest songs of the Reformation. The melody, Zahn No. 4457, is adapted from the Gloria of the mass for Easter in Gregorian chant, Lux et origo (GL 114). === Early publications === \"Aleyne God yn der H\u00f6ge sy eere\" is the first Low German version of the later \"\" published in 's Geystlyke leder (Rostock, 1531). The first print in High German appeared in a hymnal by Valentin Schumann in Leipzig in 1539. Text and melody of the hymn were published together for the first time in 's Kirchengesenge Deudtsch (Magdeburg 1545), although a slightly different version had already appeared a few years earlier in a Strasbourg hymnal. === Authorship === In 17th-century Leipzig hymnals the German text of \"\" was attributed to Nikolaus Selnecker.Johann Hermann Schein.

Historical commission of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. refers to a Latin document from 1600, which named Decius as the author of text and melody of both \"\" and \"\". The creation of hymns by Decius is dated 1522/23, before the first publications of hymns by Martin Luther (1524): thus these hymns belong to the earliest of the Reformation. == Text and translation == The following text is taken from the Protestant hymnal Evangelisches Gesangbuch, where the hymn is EG 179. The Catholic hymnal Gotteslob (GL 170) has only the first three stanzas, and a slight change in the rhythm of one tone. Both hymnals note 1523 as the year of writing. Catherine Winkworth translated the hymn to \"All glory be to God on high, who hath our race befriended\", which appears in 95 hymnals. == Hymn tune == The hymn tune of \"\" is also used for \"\" for Ascension, and \"\", a paraphrase of Psalm 23 by Wolfgang Meuslin, printed in 1530. << << ew Staff { \\clef treble \\time 4/4 \\partial 4 \\key g \\major \\set Staff.midiInstrument = \"church organ\" \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \\override Score.BarNumber #'transparent = ##t \\relative c \\repeat unfold 2 { << { g8 a | b4 c d c | b a b\\fermata b | b a8 b c b a4 | g8 e fis4 g\\fermata \\bar \"||\" \\break } \\\\\\ { d4 | g g fis e8 fis | g fis8 e4 dis e | d!8 e fis4 g4. fis8 | g4 d d } >> } \\relative c'' << { g4 | a b c b | a8. b16 b4\\trill a\\fermata a | b c d c | b a b\\fermata g | a b c8 b a4 | g8 e fis4 g\\fermata \\bar\"|.\" } \\\\\\ { d8 e | fis4 gis a8[ a,] d e | a, a'4 gis8 e4 d | d g! fis8 gis a4 | g!8 fis e4 dis b8 cis | d! e fis4 e4. d16 c! | g'4 d d } >> } ew Lyrics \\lyricmode { Al4 -- lein Gott in der H\u00f6h sei Ehr und Dank f\u00fcr sei -- ne Gna2 -- de4 da4 -- rum, dass nun und nim -- mer -- mehr uns r\u00fch -- ren kann kein Scha2 -- de.4 Ein4 Wohl -- ge -- falln Gott an uns hat, nun ist gross Fried ohn Un -- ter -- lass, all Fehd hat nun ein En2 -- de } ew Staff { \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\set Staff.midiInstrument = \"church organ\" \\relative c' \\repeat unfold 2 { << { b8 c | d4 e8[ g,] a[ b] c[ d] | e b c4 fis, g8 a | b c d4 e4. d16 c | d8 c16 b a4 b } \\\\\\ { g,4 | g'8 fis e4 d a | e'8 d c4 b e8 fis | g4 fis e8[ d] c[ a] | b c d4 g, } >> } \\relative c' << { b4 | a d e8[ f] f e | e16[ d e8] f e16 d c4 a | g g8 a b4 e, | e'8 b c4 fis, g | fis b8 a g4. fis8 | d'8 c16 b a4 b } \\\\\\ { g4 | d8[ d'] c b a4 g | f8[ c] d e a,4 fis'4 | g8 fis e4 b c8 d | e d c4 b e | d dis e8[ d] c a | b c d4 g, } >> } >> >> \\layout { indent = #0 } \\midi { \\tempo 4 = 90 } == Musical settings == As a hymn usually sung every Sunday, it was often the basis for chorale preludes. Among those by Johann Sebastian Bach there are three in Clavier-\u00dcbung III (BWV 675, BWV 676 and BWV 677), and three others in the Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes (BWV 667, BWV 668 and BWV 669). He also set the hymn as a four-part chorale (BWV 260, transcribed below).Luke Dahn (2017). BWV 260 at In his extant cantatas the melody appears in association with \"Auf Christi Himmelfahrt allein\" (BWV 128), a text for the Ascension, or \"Der Herr ist mein getreuer Hirt\" (BWV 85, 104 and 112), a paraphrase of Psalm 23. Other composers from the 18th century, or earlier, setting the hymn tune for organ include Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, Georg B\u00f6hm, Christian Geist, Johann Peter Kellner, Melchior Schildt. Felix Mendelssohn included a setting of the hymn in his oratorio Paulus, as No. 3, the first chorale after the overture and a chorus. Max Reger composed two chorale preludes, the first of his 52 chorale preludes, Op. 67 in 1902, and No. 2 of his 30 small chorale preludes, Op. 135a, in 1914. Charles Tomlinson Griffes wrote an organ piece in 1910. Sigfrid Karg-Elert included a setting as No. 23 of his 66 Chorale improvisations for organ, published in 1909. Ernst Pepping used it for the Gloria of his Deutsche Choralmesse, a six-part setting of 1928. Contemporary organ settings were written by Aivars Kal\u0113js, among others. ==References== === Cited sources === * * * * * * * * * == Further reading == * Ludger St\u00fchlmeyer: Die Kirchenlieder des Hofers Nicolaus Decius.
