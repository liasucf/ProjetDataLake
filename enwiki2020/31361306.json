It serves the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee academic community as well as the general public. == Preservation == In May 2010 the UWM Libraries Digital Collections began working in conjunction with the American Geographical Society Library on a preservation project funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. The project, entitled Saving and Sharing the AGS Library's Historic Nitrate Negative Images, encompasses \"the digitization and rehousing of 56,000 nitrate photographic negatives that document landscapes, streetscapes, and human cultures around the world.\" == Collection development == A project proposal for a new collection is submitted to the Digitization Unit and then reviewed by the UWM Libraries Digitization Oversight Committee. Materials for approved projects are carefully selected by collection curators and subject specialists in the libraries and departments housing the source collections. UWM Libraries Digitization Unit is responsible for digitizing the selected materials according to established digitization standards and best practices. The digitized resources are researched and described to provide additional access points and to facilitate their discovery and use. CONTENTdm digital media management software is used to build online collections. Digital master files are stored at UWM Libraries digital repository to ensure their accessibility in the future. High resolution digital images can be ordered. == Current collections == The UWM Libraries Digital Collections contain over 50,000 digital objects including photographic images, maps, and books drawn from the holdings of the American Geographical Society Library, the Archives, Special Collections, and the Curriculum Library. === List of digital collections === ==== Holdings of the American Geographical Society Library ==== * AGSL Digital Photo Archive \u2013 Asia and the Middle East. * AGSL Digital Photo Archive \u2013 Africa. * AGSL Digital Photo Archive \u2013 North and Central America * AGSL Digital Photo Archive \u2013 South America * AGSL Digital Map Collection * Afghanistan: Images from the Harrison Forman Collection * Cities Around the World * Images of Russia and Caucasus Region 1929\u20131933 * Nazi Invasion of Poland in 1939 * Tibet \u2013 From the Collections of the AGS * Transportation Around the World: 1911\u20131993 * Digital Sanborn Maps of Milwaukee 1894 and 1910 ==== Holdings of the Archives ==== * The March on Milwaukee Civil Rights History Project * Architectural Drawings of Willis and Lillian Leenhouts * Greetings from Milwaukee * Milwaukee Neighborhoods Photos and Maps 1885\u20131992 * The Milwaukee Repertory Theater Photographic History * Picturing Golda Meir * UWM Photos Collection * UWM Yearbook Collection ==== Holdings of the Special Collections ==== * The Tse-Tsung Chow Collection of Chinese Scrolls and Fan Paintings / \u5468\u7b56\u7e31\u66f8\u756b\u5377\u8ef8\u8207\u6247\u9762\u6536\u85cf\u96c6 * Aviation History: Selections from the George Hardie Collection * UWM Book Arts Collection ==== Holdings of the Curriculum Library ==== * Selections from the Curriculum Library's Historical Collection == Copyright and permissions == All UWM Libraries Digital Collections are published by the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee Libraries.
