    "text": "Jennifer A. Homans (born 1948) is an American historian, author, and dance critic. Her novel Apollo's Angels: A History of Ballet was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in 2010. ==Early life and education== Homans was raised in Chicago, Illinois, where she trained as a ballerina since the age of eight. By the time she was a teenager, Homans had enrolled in dance classes at the University of Chicago and eventually left the state for more serious training at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts and School of American Ballet. Although she had pursued professional training in ballet, by the age of 26 Homans decided to enroll in Columbia University following an injury. After earning her Bachelor of Arts degree in French literature, she enrolled in New York University (NYU) for her PhD in Modern European History. In 1986, she was cast as the Maiden Aunt/Waltz of the Flowers Dancer/Snowflake in the film Nutcracker: The Motion Picture. ==Career== Following her PhD, Homans accepted a position as a Distinguished Scholar in Residence at NYU where she wrote her first novel Apollo\u2019s Angels: A History of Ballet. Apollo\u2019s Angels traced back the origins of ballet from the Renaissance to modern times and decried that ballet was dying. The novel was described by The New York Times as \"the only truly definitive history of ballet\" and it was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. However, her claim that ballet was a dying art form received much criticism for being over generalized and unsubstantiated. Art critic Claudia La Rocco rebuffed Homans claims and critiqued the novel for its lack of detail to post- George Balanchine developments to ballet, including William Forsythe. From 2012 to 2013, Homans was granted a Guggenheim Fellowship as she began writing her second novel, George Balanchine: A History. The following year, she established the Center for Ballet and the Arts at NYU with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to help \"establish ballet as a serious subject of academic inquiry.\" In its inaugural opening, the institute accepted seven fellows; John Carrafa, Gregory Mosher, J. David Velleman, Heather Watts, Frederick Wiseman, Christopher d'Amboise, and John Michael Schert. In 2016, Homans was selected as a New York Public Library's Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers Fellow. In 2019, Homans' Center for Ballet and the Arts received a three-year $2 million grant. She was also named The New Yorker's dance critic, replacing Joan Acocella. ==Personal life== Homans married Tony Judt and together they had two children before his death. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1948 births Category:American ballerinas Category:Historians from Illinois Category:American women historians Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:New York University alumni Category:School of American Ballet alumni Category:University of North Carolina School of the Arts alumni Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Writers from Chicago ",
