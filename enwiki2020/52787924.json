Hooper, proprietor of the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco, CA, and his wife, Eleanor. The family was part of high society in San Francisco, and Rose Hooper was a debutante in the 1895-1896 season. Hooper married Charles Albert Plotner on October 25, 1903, in Philadelphia, PA. The couple had a son, Selden Hooper Plotner, but divorced in 1910. Hooper's second husband was William C. Lyons. She studied at the San Francisco Art League under William Keith and Emil Carlsen. Further instruction in New York followed, under Amalia K\u00fcssner Coudert. In Dresden she studied with Otto Eckhardt and in Paris with Gabrielle Debillemont-Chardon. In 1903 she returned to her native city, where she remained until 1926, when she moved to New York. There she remained until 1939. She later returned to California, living in Coronado from 1946 until 1958 and thereafter in San Francisco until her death.
