    "text": "Jagdwurst from Tyrol Jagdwurst (which means hunting sausage) is a German cooked sausage made of lean beef and pork, as well as belly of pork, salt, pepper, garlic, mustard seed, capsicum, mace, cardamom and water, which makes the sausage juicy. Part of the meat is very finely minced, but another part retains its structure. Jagdwurst contains about 20 percent fat. In the regions of the former GDR (eastern Germany), a common dish is sliced Jagdwurst coated in breadcrumbs (normally mixed with egg) and fried, often in butter. Jagdwurst in this form is called J\u00e4gerschnitzel (Hunter's schnitzel) and should not be confused with Schnitzel J\u00e4ger-Art, veal schnitzel served with dark mushroom sauce. Jagdwurst can also be served on fresh buttered bread or breakfast rolls with a hint of mustard. Construction workers in Germany would carry a pocket knife with their lunch box, which contained a small roll of Jagdwurst, buttered bread slices and German mustard and perhaps even beer. Jagdwurst can also be cubed and cooked with onions and mushrooms and served over mashed potatoes, with cheese on top. Category:German sausages Category:Cooked sausages ",
