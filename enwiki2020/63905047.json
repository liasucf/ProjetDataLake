    "text": "The Girl from the Main refers an unidentified murder victim found in the Main River, in Nied, Germany. The decedent, aged 15\u201316 at the time of her death, had been physically abused and finally murdered before being dumped into the river, when she was found on July 31, 2001. == Case summary == On July 31, 2001, around 2:50 PM, passers-by found the approximately tall and only body of a 15-to-16-year-old girl. The body had a number of injuries all over which indicated serious abuse suffered over a period of years, none of which had been treated by a doctor. Among other things, her arms were malformed as a result of healed fractures, there were numerous longer scars in the area of the legs, trunk and forehead, burn scars from cigarettes, and a cauliflower ear caused by injury were found during the autopsy. It is believed that the girl looked about two years younger than her actual age and that she had dark brown hair, about long. Her teeth were in poor condition, and there were no wisdom teeth. Her eye color was no longer ascertainable. The victim had probably been in the water for 12\u201314 hours. Death occurred as a result of two bluntly fractured ribs that injured the lungs and spleen, no more than three days before the discovery of the body. The body was tied up and weighed down with a parasol stand and thrown into the Main. Investigations revealed that the girl most likely was thrown into the water between the Griesheim barrage and the W\u00f6rthspitze. Among other things, due to a scarf-like object she had on her, it is assumed that the girl originated from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area, but was living in the Frankfurt Rhine-Main area, perhaps as a servant. However, on-site investigation revealed no clues about her identity or that of her killer(s). It cannot be excluded that the girl entered through diplomatic circles, in which investigations are difficult due to political immunity. The body, financed by donations from the investigators, was buried in the Heiligenstock cemetery. The case receives substantial attention even after more than ten years. ==See also== *List of unsolved murders == References == == External links == * Case on the website of the Federal Criminal Police Office (accessed on October 8, 201^6) * The girl from the Main from Taunus Zeitung (Frankfurter Neue Presse), dated July 30, 2011 (accessed June 30, 2016) * First report on \"Aktenzeichen XY \u2026 ungel\u00f6st\", dated September 7, 2001 (accessed August 1, 2018) * Second report, from 2:50 of \"Aktenzeichen XY \u2026 ungel\u00f6st\", dated June 24, 2009 (accessed August 1, 2018) Category:1980s births Category:2001 crimes Category:2001 deaths Category:Deaths by person in Germany Category:Female murder victims Category:People from Frankfurt Category:Unidentified murder victims Category:Unsolved murders in Germany ",
