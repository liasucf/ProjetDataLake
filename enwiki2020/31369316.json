    "text": "The 1972 U.S. Women's Open was the 27th U.S. Women's Open, held June 29 to July 2 at the East Course of Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, New York. Susie Berning won the second of her three U.S. Women's Open titles, a stroke ahead of runners-up Kathy Ahern, Pam Barnett, and Judy Rankin. Berning opened with a 79 (+7) and started the final round at 228 (+12), four strokes behind 54-hole leader Barnett. Berning carded a one-under 71 for the third of her four major wins. Defending champion JoAnne Carner finished at 312 (+24), thirteen strokes back. With a winner's share of $6,000, the 1972 edition was the first to exceed that of the inaugural championship in 1946, the only one conducted as a match play event. The course conditions at Winged Foot were soft, affected by the recent heavy rains of tropical storm Agnes, originally a hurricane. Two-time champion Louise Suggs made the cut at age 48. The championship was previously held at the East Course in 1957; the adjacent West Course has hosted many major championships. ==Past champions in the field== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Player || Country || Year(s) won || R1 || R2 || R3 || R4 || Total || To par || Finish |- | align=left|Susie Berning || align=left| || 1968 || 79 || 73 || 76 || 71 || 299 || +11 || 1 |- | align=left|Mickey Wright || align=left| || 1958, 1959, 1961, 1964|| 77 || 80 || 76 || 71 || 304 || +16 || T6 |- | align=left|Carol Mann || align=left| || 1965 || 79 || 77 || 78 || 71 || 305 || +17 || T9 |- | align=left|Kathy Cornelius || align=left| || 1956 || 74 || 80 || 75 || 79 || 308 || +20 || T19 |- | align=left|Betsy Rawls || align=left| || 1951, 1953, 1957, 1960 || 77 || 76 || 74 || 81 || 308 || +20 || T19 |- | align=left|Donna Caponi Young || align=left| || 1969, 1970 || 80 || 75 || 75 || 79 || 309 || +21 || T25 |- |align=left|JoAnne Carner || align=left| || 1971 || 79 || 79 || 75 || 79 || 312 || +24 || T29 |- |align=left|Mary Mills || align=left| || 1963 || 80 || 78 || 78 || 76 || 312 || +24 || T29 |- | align=left|Murle Breer || align=left| || 1962 || 83 || 76 || 82 || 74 || 315 || +27 || T34 |- | align=left|Louise Suggs || align=left| || 1949, 1952 || 78 || 80 || 82 || 76 || 316 || +28 || 39 |} Source: ==Final leaderboard== Sunday, July 2, 1972 {| class=\"wikitable\" !
