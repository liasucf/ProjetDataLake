As the name dong (hangul: \ub3d9; hanja: \u51ac; literally \"winter\") and chimi (hangul: \uce58\ubbf8, an ancient term for kimchi), suggests, this kimchi is traditionally consumed during the winter season.Dongchimi (Radish Liquid Kimchi) Dongchimi is fermented like other varieties of kimchi, but its maturing period is relatively short (2\u20133 days). Although it can be made at any time of the year, it is usually made during the gimjang season. The northern regions consisting of Hamgyeong-do and Pyeongan-do in North Korea are particularly famous for their dongchimi. \uc8fc\ub9d0 \ub9e4\uac70\uc9c4: \uae40\uce58, 8\u9053 8\u5473 originally from Chosun Ilbo 2003-10-09 10:50 The clear and clean taste of the watery dongchimi is used as a soup for making dongchimi guksu (\ub3d9\uce58\ubbf8\uad6d\uc218 cold noodle soup made with dongchimi) and naengmyeon, or served with tteok or steamed sweet potatoes to balance out the rich flavors. Ibuk cuisine (\uc774\ubd81\uc74c\uc2dd) from \uc804\ud1b5\ud56d\ud1a0\uc74c\uc2dd\ubb38\ud654\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0 ==Ingredients== Radish is the most important ingredient in dongchimi. Whole green or red peppers can be added as decoration but are not required. Leaf mustard, garlic, ginger and leeks, as well as other salted ingredients may be included. (Kor) ==Types== *Baechu dongchimi (Cabbage dongchimi, \ubc30\ucd94\ub3d9\uce58\ubbf8) Radish and napa cabbage stuffed with ingredients such as julienned radish, Korean chives, red peppers, garlic, and ginger is pickled in brine. Kelp stock is added for deep flavor before fermentation. *Daenamu dongchimi (Bamboo dongchimi, \ub300\ub098\ubb34\ub3d9\uce58\ubbf8) Bamboo leaves are used as a main ingredient, giving the dongchimi a crisp and clean taste while adding texture. The fermentation process takes longer than other varieties of dongchimi due to its lower sodium content but it can also be stored much longer. It is a local specialty of South Jeolla province. * Gungjung dongchimi (Royal dongchimi, \uad81\uc911 \ub3d9\uce58\ubbf8) Made from small radish, yuja, pomegranate, and Korean pears are added for a fragrant version.
