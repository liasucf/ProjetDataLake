Penguin Books. p. 426 ==History== It was founded as a daughter church of Holy Trinity Church, Sutton Coldfield. It was built to the designs of the architect Daniel Rollinson Hill and consecrated on 14 December 1835. An unfortunate incident happened on Good Friday in 1850 when the congregation were overcome by fumes from the stoves used for warming the church. The church became a parish in its own right in 1853 when land was assigned from Holy Trinity Church, Sutton Coldfield. Part of the parish was taken to form a new parish of All Saints' Church, Four Oaks in 1890. In 1908 the chancel had been replaced with a new one by the architect Charles Edward Bateman, who also provided transepts, an organ loft and new vestries. The intention was to rebuild the rest of the church to match, but the scheme was never brought to conclusion. ==Organ== The church contained an organ by Forster and Andrews. The opening recital was given on 7 June 1853. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. ==References== Category:Church of England church buildings in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Churches completed in 1835 Category:19th-century Church of England church buildings Category:Grade II listed churches in the West Midlands (county) ",
