    "text": "In Canada's parliamentary system of responsible government, minority governments occur when no party has a majority of seats in the legislature. Typically, but not necessarily, the party with a plurality of seats forms the government. In a minority situation, governments must rely on the support of other parties to stay in power, providing less stability than a majority government. In Canada, political parties rarely form official coalition governments to form a majority. Canada's plurality voting system means that minority governments are relatively rare in comparison with countries that have a proportional representation voting system. There have, however, been several minority governments at the federal level and in nine of Canada's 10 provinces at various times. ==Federal level== Canada has had 14 minority governments, experiencing its longest period of minority government with three successive minority governments elected in 2004, 2006 and 2008. * Alexander Mackenzie (1873\u20131874, Liberal) * William Lyon Mackenzie King (1921\u201325, 1925\u201326, Liberal) * Arthur Meighen (1926, Conservative) * John Diefenbaker (1957\u201358, 1962\u201363, Progressive Conservative) * Lester Pearson (1963\u201365, 1965\u201368, Liberal) * Pierre Trudeau (1972\u201374, Liberal) * Joe Clark (1979\u201380, Progressive Conservative) * Paul Martin (2004\u201306, Liberal) * Stephen Harper (2006\u201308, 2008\u201311, Conservative) * Justin Trudeau (2019\u2013present, Liberal) ==Provincial and territorial level== Of Canada's 10 provinces, only Alberta has never had a minority government. The territories of Northwest Territories and Nunavut do not have political parties and are instead governed under the consensus government system. * British Columbia (1924\u201328, 1952\u201353, 2017\u2013present) * Manitoba (1936\u201341, 1958\u201359, 1969\u201373, 1988\u201390) * New Brunswick (1920\u201325, 2018\u20132020) * Newfoundland and Labrador (1971\u201372, 2019\u2013present) * Nova Scotia (1970\u201374, 1998\u201399, 2003\u201306, 2006\u201309) * Ontario (1867\u201371, 1943\u201345, 1975\u201377, 1977\u201381, 1985\u201387, 2011\u201314) * Quebec (1878\u201379, 2007\u201308, 2012\u201314) * Prince Edward Island (1873\u201376, 1876\u201379, 1890\u201393, 2019\u2013present) * Saskatchewan (1929\u201334, 1999\u20132003) * Yukon (1985\u201389, 1992\u201396) ==References== * Minority Government, by D.
