Administratively it belongs to the Northeast Greenland National Park. ==History== The fjord was named in 1899 by Swedish Arctic explorer and geologist A.G. Nathorst during the expedition he led to Greenland in search of survivors of S. A. Andr\u00e9e's Arctic balloon expedition of 1897. The name was chosen owing to the spectacularly colored strata and rock formations in the shores of the fjord. ==Geography== The Geologfjord is part of the Kaiser Franz Joseph Fjord complex.Prostar Sailing Directions 2005 Greenland and Iceland Enroute, p. 120 It is a narrow and winding fjord located between mountains rising up to on both sides, with cliffs displaying beautifully colored strata. It runs roughly in a NW /SE direction with Andr\u00e9e Land to the west and Strindberg Land to the east. The Nunatak Glacier has its terminus at its head. The smaller Endel\u00f8s and Dukke Glacier flow into the fjord from the west. Bjorne Island, a rocky islet, rises close to the mouth of the fjord, north of Cape Weber, the easternmost end of Andr\u00e9e Land. To the south the fjord opens into the northern shore of the Kaiser Franz Joseph Fjord and Cape Ovibos is the headland at the eastern side of the entrance. {| |- valign=\"top\" |Map of Northeastern Greenland. |View of Bjorne Island. |} ==See also== *List of fjords of Greenland ==Bibliography== * Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008 ==References== ==External links== * *Den gr\u00f8nlandske Lods - Sejladsanvisninger \u00d8stgr\u00f8nland *Glacitectonic deformations in East Greenland Category:Fjords of Greenland ",
