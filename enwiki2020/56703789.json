A grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King Charles II of England to aforesaid Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet which included, inter alia, the lands of Renmoor. By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the said lands of Renmoor were included in the creation of a new Manor of Beresford.
