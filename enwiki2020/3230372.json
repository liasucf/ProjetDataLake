    "text": "Athletes from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. 109 competitors, 92 men and 17 women, took part in 50 events in 14 sports. These would be the last Summer Games in which athletes from Montenegro and Serbia participated under the name of Yugoslavia. They would compete as Serbia and Montenegro at the 2004 Summer Olympics. The final days of the Olympics were overshadowed by the protests of its president Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. ==Medalists== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font- size:95%\" |- ! Medal !
