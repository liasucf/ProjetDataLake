    "text": "{| |} The Jurca MJ-51 Sperocco (Special Sirocco) is a plans-built two-seat tandem aerobatic aircraft derived from the Jurca MJ-5 Sirocco. ==Design and development== Encouraged by friends and previous customers, Marcel Jurca developed the MJ-51 in 1969 as an improved, higher power Sirocco. It has a longer, more rounded, stronger fuselage capable of engines up to , the wings of the MJ-7 Gnatsum without dihedral and a longer canopy. Other changes include a raised rear seat and a smaller tail.. Jurca said that it was his favourite two-seat design. There are two variants - the MJ-51B for engines of , and the MJ-51C for engines from up to . Three examples have been started, each varying from the basic design in collaboration with Jurca himself. Construction of the first prototype started in France in around 1981. It was to be powered by a Lycoming AEIO-360. The builder died in 2004 and the project remains incomplete. The second example was started in the USA in 1991. It has a Lycoming IO-540 engine, uprated to and made its first flight on 6 June 2019. The third aircraft was started in France in 1999 with a plan to install a Potez engine. Transferred to a different builder, the design has been changed and strengthened to accommodate a Lycoming AEIO-540 Other modifications will include a two-door canopy, a larger and more accessible rear seat, additional fuel tanks, advanced avionics and uprated brakes. The aircraft has yet to fly (October 2019). ==Specifications (MJ-51) == ==References== ==External links== * Avions Marcel Jurca website Category:Homebuilt aircraft Category:Jurca aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft ",
