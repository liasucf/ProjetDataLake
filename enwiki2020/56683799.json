The episode aired on April 24, 2017 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. The title of the episode is a reference to sunk costs. ==Plot== After following his planted tracking device's signal to an empty stretch of highway, Mike finds it left in the middle of the road along with a ringing cell phone. He answers, agrees to the caller's request that no guns be displayed, and is told to wait for two cars to approach from opposite directions. The cars soon arrive, Gus exits one, and his men stand guard so Gus and Mike can discuss the Hector situation. They agree that Gus will no longer track Mike, and Mike will no longer try to kill Hector. Gus is amenable to Mike's continued disruption of Hector's drug business, and Mike suggests a way to draw police attention to Hector without killing him. Mike acquires cocaine from Barry Goodman, stows it in the toe of a sneaker, ties the sneaker to its mate, and throws them over a power line that spans part of the road in Mexico that he knows Hector's drug delivery trucks use. When the next truck comes, the drivers stop to stash their weapons prior to being searched at the border crossing. Mike, using a sniper rifle, fires a few rounds into the air to give them the false impression that there is a hunter or target shooter in the vicinity. The drivers finish hiding their guns, get back in the truck and pull away. Mike fires at the sneaker holding the cocaine, which causes the powder to spill onto the back of the truck. At the border crossing, drug-sniffing dogs discover the cocaine, and the drivers are taken into custody. Jimmy is arrested for breaking into Chuck's house. Following a few harsh but hesitant words with Chuck, Jimmy goes against Kim's advice and represents himself, pleads not guilty, and posts bail. Jimmy later explains to Kim the details of the break-in and tells her she should work on Mesa Verde business while he takes care of his own legal battle, to which she flatly agrees. Kyra Hay, the prosecutor in Jimmy's case, meets with Chuck and tells him she doesn't plan to let Jimmy off easy. Chuck describes his wish to see a \"better solution for everyone.\" Jimmy talks with Kim outside the Wexler-McGill office and informs her he can avoid jail time if he confesses to the break-in and submits his confession to the New Mexico Bar Association, which will likely result in disbarment. Kim changes her mind about helping Jimmy and persuades him to let her help fight Chuck's plan. ==Reception== ===Ratings=== Upon airing, the episode received 1.52 million American viewers, and an 18\u201349 rating of 0.5. ===Critical reception=== The episode received critical acclaim, on Rotten Tomatoes, the episode holds a 100% rating with an average score of 8.09/10, based on 13 reviews.
