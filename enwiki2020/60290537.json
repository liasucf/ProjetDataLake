    "text": "\"Better Man\" is a song by Irish pop vocal band Westlife. It was released on by Virgin EMI Records on 29 March 2019 as the second single from the band's eleventh studio album, Spectrum. It is their second single released under Universal Music Group and Virgin EMI Records. The song was written by Ed Sheeran, Fred Gibson, Steve Mac and Wayne Hector. This is the most successful and highest charting song and single co-written by Gibson for a pop and male band. This is their second number-one hit in the UK Singles Physical Chart and number-two in UK Singles Sales Chart and Scottish Singles Chart in 2019 and in 2010s decade. The single is their 29th Top 10 hit in Ireland and 28th Top 40, and 29th Top 75 hit in the United Kingdom. ==Background, development, and release== Since they announced their breakup in 2011 and their last appearance together in 2012, several rumors about them reuniting and making new musics have appeared. On 23 September 2018, several Irish news outlets started reporting that the group has been signed to Universal Music Group and Virgin EMI Records for a new music record deal. On 3 October 2018, the group announced that there would be new music coming soon. This song is set in the key of B major, in a moderate 4/4 time signature. The vocal range of this piece ranges from F#3 to B4 (Feehily's harmony). ==Music video== The music video was directed by Lochlainn \"Locky\" McKenna and was filmed in Dublin, Ireland in two locations. The band were shot in the historic Windmill Lane Studios. The music video depicts a teenage romance blossoming in 1993, and they become estranged after the boy ignores her after a school performance, but they soon get back together. That same girl is shown in the recording studio where the band is singing the song, all grown up. And she is married to that same boy, and they have a kid together. ==Tours performed at== *The Twenty Tour (2019) ==Formats and track listings== *Digital download #\"Better Man\" \u2013 3:17 *Digital download #\"Better Man\" \u2013 3:23 *CD single / streaming #\"Better Man\" \u2013 3:17 #\"Better Man\" \u2013 3:23 *Digital download / streaming #\"Better Man\" \u2013 3:13 ==Credits and personnel== * Westlife (Kian Egan, Mark Feehily, Nicky Byrne, Shane Filan) \u2013 vocals, associated performer * Ed Sheeran \u2013 songwriting * Steve Mac \u2013 production, songwriting, keyboards, piano * Fred Gibson \u2013 songwriting * Wayne Hector \u2013 songwriting * Chris Laws \u2013 drums, engineering, mixing * Dann Pursey \u2013 engineering * John Parricelli \u2013 guitar * Dave Arch \u2013 strings, arranger * Steve Pearce \u2013 bass * Dick Beetham \u2013 mastering * Duncan Fuller \u2013 engineering * Mike Horner \\- engineering ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| China Airplay/FL (Billboard) | 44 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Denmark Digital Songs (Billboard) |10 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\" | New Zealand Digital Songs (Billboard) | 9 |- ! scope=\"row\" | New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) | 26 |- |- ! scope=\"row\" | Sweden Digital Songs (Billboard) | 5 |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Version ! scope=\"col\"| Label |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Various | 29 March 2019 | Airplay, CD, digital download, streaming | Orchestral, original | rowspan=\"2\"| Universal Music Group, Virgin EMI |- | 26 April 2019 | Digital download, streaming | Acoustic |} ==References== Category:Westlife songs Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Virgin EMI Records singles Category:Universal Music Group singles Category:Song recordings produced by Steve Mac Category:Songs written by Steve Mac Category:Songs written by Ed Sheeran Category:Songs written by Wayne Hector Category:Pop ballads Category:Songs written by Fred Again ",
