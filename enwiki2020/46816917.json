She was commanded by captain Gabriel Pellegrin.Eccles 1972, p.123 In 1757 she crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 38 days. This was one of the fastest crossings from Brest to Petite ferme on the La C\u00f4te-de-Beaupr\u00e9 with pilot Pellegrin, port captain of Quebec, who was on his forty-second crossing. Captured by the Royal Navy in 1757, she was renamed HMS Aurora and saw active service in the latter half of the Seven Years' War. She was broken up for timber at Plymouth Dockyard in 1763. ==French Navy career 1756\u20131757== Ab\u00e9naquise or Abenakise was built in Quebec and launched in 1756.Winfield 2007, p. 200 ==Royal Navy career 1757\u20131763== In 1757 she was captured by and brought into Portsmouth Harbour as a prize ship. On Admiralty's order she was purchased by the Royal Navy on 8 January 1758, for a sum of \u00a36,103.11s for the hull and \u00a3425.4s for the masts and internal fittings. She was renamed HMS Aurora on 22 June, and commissioned into the Royal Navy in October 1758 under Captain Samuel Scott. Her 250-man crew comprised four commissioned officers a captain and three lieutenants overseeing 49 warrant and petty officers, 117 naval ratings, 44 Marines and 36 servants and other ranks.Rodger 1986, pp. 348351 Among these other ranks were five positions reserved for widow's men fictitious crew members whose pay was intended to be reallocated to the families of sailors who died at sea. Auroras first Royal Navy duties were as a troop transport, ferrying British soldiers from England to Gibraltar ahead of an expected French or Spanish assault. Thereafter, she was sailed for Havre de Grace, Maryland in search of French privateers. However there were concerns about her seaworthiness and she was returned to England in 1760 to undergo two successive naval surveys. No repairs were carried out, and instead Aurora was paid off in 1761 and her crew dispersed to other ships. The vessel was recommissioned in 1762 under Captain Raby Vane and assigned to coastal patrols and cruising in English home waters and off the coast of France. She was again the subject of a naval survey, in December 1762, and was removed from active service in the same month. At the conclusion of the Seven Years' War in 1763, she was disassembled at Plymouth Dockyard and her timbers sold for \u00a3152.5s. ==Notes== ==References== ===Bibliography=== * W.J.
