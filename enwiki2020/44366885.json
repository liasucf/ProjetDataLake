These incidents came shortly after two separate attacks by lone wolf terrorists sympathetic to the group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The attacks, the 2014 Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu ramming attack and the 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa, led to the deaths of two Canadian Armed Forces personnel. ==Response== On November 12, 2014, Quebec Liberal Party Immigration Minister Kathleen Weil stated, \"It's important for us as a government to condemn these acts...I had the opportunity to say to some international news reporters that it really doesn't reflect Quebec society. It reflects terribly on us from the outside. We are a tolerant society, inclusive and open to diversity.\"Montreal Gazette: Immigration Minister Kathleen Weil condemns vandalism of Quebec mosques ==See also== * Bloc identitaire - Original chapter of Identitaire. * G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Identitaire - France chapter of Identitaire. * Counterjihad * Criticism of Islam * Islamophobia in Canada * Persecution of Muslims * Quebec nationalism * Religious intolerance * Religious persecution ==References== Category:2014 in Quebec Category:Canadian far-right political movements Category:Opposition to Islam in Canada Category:Organizations based in Quebec Category:Opposition to Islam in Quebec Category:Quebec nationalism Category:Violence against Muslims Category:White nationalism in Canada Category:Racism in Quebec ",
