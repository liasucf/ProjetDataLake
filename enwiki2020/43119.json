    "text": "Breakbeat hardcore (also referred to as hardcore rave) is a music genre of the very early 1990s that spawned from the UK rave scene. It combines four-on-the- floor rhythms with breakbeats usually sampled from hip hop. In addition to the inclusion of breakbeats, the genre also features shuffled drum machine patterns, hoover and other noises originating from new beat, acid house squelches and bleeps, and often upbeat house piano rolls and vocals. == Origins == Fantazia Summertime rave, May 1992 The rave scene expanded rapidly in the very early 1990s, both at clubs up and down the country including Labrynth, Shelley's Laserdome, The Eclipse, and Sanctuary Music Arena, and large raves in warehouses and in the open air attracting 20\u201350,000 whether put on legally from promoters such as Fantazia and Raindance, or unlicensed by free party sound systems such as Spiral Tribe.
