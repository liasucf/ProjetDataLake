    "text": "Ceranemota semifasciata is a moth in the family Drepanidae. It was described by Foster Hendrickson Benjamin in 1938. It is found in North America, where it has been recorded from northern California. The wingspan is about 35 mm. The forewings are gray with a pale greenish dusting along the costa. The base is white with a small black spot near the center, beyond this a small black spot, and obliquely toward the inner margin, a small tuft of black and white scales. The transverse anterior and posterior lines are broad rufous, the former preceded by a broad, more or less indistinct, fuscous shade, the latter followed by a narrower band of the same color. Four small fuscous spots are found on costa, beyond the transverse posterior line, the two outer ones better defined than the two inner ones. There is a well defined triangular whitish patch at the apex, which narrows to form a distinct whitish subterminal line. The hindwings are light yellowish fuscous, lighter basally. ==References== Category:Moths described in 1938 Category:Thyatirinae ",
