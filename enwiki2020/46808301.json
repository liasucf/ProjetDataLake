According to Atlantic Records producer Herb Abramson, Lance wrote \"Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean\" with his friend Johnny Wallace (the brother of boxer Coley Wallace), after the pair had heard a blues singer on the street in Atlanta, Georgia, singing a mournful song that included the title line. Although singer Ruth Brown initially disliked the song, she was persuaded by Lance and Wallace to record it, and did so in December 1952 after Abramson had speeded up its tempo. Chip Deffaa, Blue Rhythms: Six Lives in Rhythm and Blues, University of Illinois Press, 1996, p.35 \"Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean\" became Brown's third #1 hit on the R&B; chart, in 1953, and her first pop chart hit. In some later versions, the song's authorship was also co-credited to Charles Singleton, with whom Lance wrote a number of other less commercially successful songs in the 1950s.
