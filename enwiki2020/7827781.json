    "text": "Tonite Only is an electronic music group formed late 2005 in Sydney, Australia, which disbanded late 2006, only to reform a few years later. Its two members are Sam Littlemore (Sam La More) and Simon Lewicki (Groove Terminator), leading proponents in the Australian electronic music scene. In 2006, the duo released \"Danger (The Bomb)\" and \"Where the Party's At\" and soon after announced that they would separate and focus on their respective solo careers. In 2008, the pair reunited to remix (Ministry of Sound label-mate) Hook n Sling's \"The Best Thing\", a cover of the 1980s Boom Crash Opera song. In 2011 they resumed production together and released the single, \"We Run the Nite\" which peaked at number 42 in the Australian pop charts. ==Discography== ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+List of singles as lead artist ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| AUS |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Danger (The Bomb)\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2006 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Where the Party's At\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"We Run the Night\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2011 | 42 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Haters Gonna Hate\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Go\" | 2012 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Experience\" feat.
