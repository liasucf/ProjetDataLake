    "text": "Potton & Burton, formerly Craig Potton Publishing, is a book publishing company based in Nelson, New Zealand, and is one of the largest independent book publishers in New Zealand. ==History== Potton & Burton was first established in 1987 as Craig Potton Publishing by conservationist Craig Potton, who initially founded it to publish books of his photography. It publishes a diverse range of non-fiction books focused on New Zealand, as well as a range of photographic calendars. Potton (born 1952) is a photographer and prominent environmentalist. The company changed its name to Potton & Burton in March 2015, to more accurately reflect the role of Robbie Burton, who has been the publisher since 1990, and who has been a co-owner for many years. In 2019 the company out-sourced its sales and distribution to Bateman Books in Auckland, but continues to publish new books and calendars from its Nelson office, while also maintaining a strong backlist of New Zealand books. ==References== ==External links== * * Robbie Burton Publisher *Craig Potton Publishing on Open Library Category:Book publishing companies of New Zealand Category:Publishing companies established in 1987 Category:Mass media in Nelson, New Zealand ",
