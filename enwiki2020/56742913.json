The game story takes place fifteen years ago after a portal, known as the void, started bringing demons into the world. Fifteen years later, children that were once lost to the void were transported back to their world. Armed with supernatural powers, these children were to be known as SoulWorkers. SoulWorker was first released in Japan on April 6, 2016 with Hangame publishing the game. The Korean version was published by Smilegate on January 18, 2017, while the English version entered Open Beta on February 26, 2018 with Gameforge as its publisher. Players can download the English version through Steam or through the official Gameforge website. ==Characters== SoulWorker features six playable characters that have their own unique weapons and skills. Character skills can further be improved by leveling through quests and dungeons. Additionally, players also gain access to more skills as they increase in level. ===Haru Estia=== : Haru is a 17 years old girl falling under the Soulum class. Despite her shy and timid exterior, inside her burns a flame fueled by revenge.

As a Gun Jazz user, he can utilize his twin pistol to perform devastating skill attacks such as Sky High and Soulcaster. Formerly known as a TV star, his supreme confidence is mostly overshadowed by his extreme curiosity; often facing danger with an overconfident grin. ===Lily Bloommerchen=== : During the descending of the demons from the void fifteen years ago, Lilly's sibling was murdered. This resulted to the letting loose of Lilly's madness; with her soul manifesting as the Mist Scythe. Lilly's fighting style can be described as something brutal; utilizing skills such as Carnage and Guillotine to end the lives of her enemies. ===Stella Unibell=== : Despite her vulnerable and cute appearance, Stella shouldn't be underestimated. Her soul screams through her Howling Guitar, capable of dealing a wide range of damage. Inside her weapon rests a demon known as, 'Fuu-chan' capable of performing earth shattering attacks to defend Stella at any cost. ===Jin Seipatsu=== : Jin is a 17 year old male specializing in the use of Spirit Arms. As a trained defensive- fighter, Jin is capable of bringing a wide range of brawl-style skills into the battlefield. ===Iris Yuma=== : Iris is the youngest daughter of the traditional and well-established Yuma family.
