    "text": "Zafar Iqbal (; born 27 September 1932 or 1933) is an Urdu poet based in Okara, Punjab, Pakistan. ==Early life and career== Zafar Iqbal was born in Bahawalnagar, Punjab where his maternal grandparents lived. Then he received his basic early education in Okara, Punjab which is his hometown and later moved to Lahore for his college education. His poetry is mainly in the genre of ghazal. The diction of his ghazal is entirely different from traditional Urdu poetry. He is a lawyer by profession, and regularly contributes articles to some Urdu newspapers. In contrast to classical Poets, Zafar's poetry portrays love as scientific and physical rather than supernatural. Dr Tabassam Kaashmiri called him Literature's renegade of the 20th century. Former Chief Minister of Punjab (Pakistan), Hanif Ramay who was also a writer and a well- known literary critic called him a poet of a new tone and new concepts. Besides being a poet, he has been a newspaper columnist for different newspapers for over 35 years. Considering that he also has been a professional lawyer for most of his adult life, those are not small accomplishments. He practised as an attorney, first in Okara and then in Lahore until 2003, when he had a heart bypass surgery and quit practicing law. Zafar Iqbal has a son named Aftab Iqbal who is a newspaper columnist and a well-known TV anchor in Pakistan.Zafar Iqbal an Urdu poet and columnist urduadab4u.com website, Retrieved 26 February 2018 ==Poetry collections== *Tamjid *Taqweem *Tashkeel *Tajawaz *Tawarid *Tasahil *Hay Hanuman *Ab Tak *gul aftaab ==Books== *Aab-i- Rawan *Gulaftab *Ratb-o-Yabis *Ghubaaralood simtaun ka suragh *Sar-i-aam *Aib- o-hunar *Vehm-o-gumaan ==Awards and recognition== *Hilal-i-Imtiaz Award (Crescent of Excellence Award) by the President of Pakistan in 2014.Honouring the distinguished: President approves national civil awards The Express Tribune (newspaper), Published 14 August 2013, Retrieved 27 February 2018 *Pride of Performance Award by the President of Pakistan in 1999. ==References== ==External links== Category:1932 births Category:Urdu poets Category:Pakistani male journalists Category:Urdu poets from Pakistan Category:Pakistani lawyers Category:Recipients of the Pride of Performance Category:Living people ",
