From 1986 to 1993, he attended Vinters Boys School, described as \"a living hell\", and Chatham Grammar School for Boys. 1993-97, attended Canterbury College of Art for Foundation and BA in Fine Art, but was forced to leave by the Department of Social Security. From 1997 to 1998, resumed a part-time BA, but was expelled for condemning \"conceptual shit\" and also threatened with arrest. Since then, No\u00eb has worked in their father's garage, Medway Citroen. During this time they returned to studies at Canterbury Christ Church College, and obtained a Master in Fine Arts degree in 2011. In 1996, No\u00eb's work was first publicly exhibited in Indo Gothic, in Chatham, Kent.

In 2001 founded the Maidstone Stuckists group and was exhibited in the Vote Stuckist show that year. There were staged fourteen shows of the Maidstone Stuckists works in various venues, including pubs, libraries and the Maidstone Music School, as well as arranging expeditions of the group for \"painting, inspiration and getting drunk\".

Norse and Anglo-Saxon mythology are recurring themes in paintings, as are historical sites and the countryside in Kent. The use of sacred geometry and their own form of aesthetic geometry are features in the work.
