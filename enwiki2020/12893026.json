    "text": "Leucadendron strobilinum, commonly called the peninsula conebush, is a plant species in the genus Leucadendron\u2014forming part of the family Proteaceae. Confined to the Cape Peninsula, it reaches a height of up to growing in southern, damp rocky slopes at an elevation of 500 to 1100m. Its conservation status is Near Threatened\u2014a result of inappropriate fire management, fire- break clearing and alien plant invasions. ==Appearance== A large, single- stemmed shrub reaching a height of up to 2.6m. It branches near the base and has dark-green elliptical leaves. ==Ecology== As with all leucadendron, the peninsula conebush is dioecious. Flowering takes place between September and October, with flowers described as yeast scented. Seeds are stored on the (female) plant, an adaptation known as serotiny, to be released upon a fire occurring; the seeds are winged allowing for wind dispersal. == External links == * World Flora Online detailed plant description ==References== strobilinum Category:Endemic flora of South Africa Category:Flora of the Cape Provinces Category:Fynbos Category:Vulnerable flora of Africa Category:Conservation dependent plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
