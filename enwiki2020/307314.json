    "text": "Henequen (Agave fourcroydes Lem.) is an agave, a plant species native to southern Mexico and Guatemala. It is reportedly naturalized in Italy, the Canary Islands, Costa Rica, Cuba, Hispaniola, the Cayman Islands and the Lesser Antilles. ==Overview== The leaves of Agave fourcroydes yield a fiber also called henequen, which is suitable for rope and twine but not of as high a quality as sisal. It is the major plantation fiber agave of eastern Mexico, being grown extensively in Yucat\u00e1n, Veracruz, and Tamaulipas. It is also used to make licor del henequ\u00e9n, a traditional Mexican alcoholic drink. The plant appears as a rosette of sword-shaped leaves 1.2 to 1.8 meters long, growing out of a thick stem that may reach 1.7 meters (5 ft). The leaves have regularly spaced teeth 3\u20136 mm long and a terminal spine 2\u20133 cm long. Like sisal, A. fourcroydes is a sterile hybrid; the ovaries never produce seeds. The plant does produce bulbils that may be planted, but commercial growers prefer to use the frequent suckers, which develop more quickly. The first person of Spanish descent to document the plant and its usefulness for ropes and other naval utensils was Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Lanz, a Mexican-born engineer in service of the Spanish Navy, who studied henequen in Yucat\u00e1n in 1783. ==In Mezcal== Henequen, like other species of agave, is used in the production of mezcal. Erstwhile Mezcal of Brooklyn, NY is the first brand to launch a Henequ\u00e9n mezcal in the United States market. ==Gallery== Image:Henequen.jpg|Henequen farm in Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula.
