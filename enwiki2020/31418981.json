    "text": "The fixture between Bristol Rovers and Swindon Town is a local football rivalry, sometimes referred to as a West Country derby or M4 Derby. The distance between Bristol to Swindon is just under 35 miles, and both clubs are situated in the South West region of England. ==History== The first meeting between the clubs was in a friendly match held in Swindon on 24 October 1891. Swindon beat Rovers (known at the time as Eastville Rovers) 5\u20132, and just under two months later they met for a second time, drawing 2\u20132.Byrne & Jay (2003), p34 Having been in the same division in only two seasons out of 13 between 1993 and 2006, the clubs would then be in the same division for the next six seasons in a row, even being promoted (League Two in 2007) and relegated (League One in 2011) at the same time. However, following Swindon's promotion back to League One the two sides are not set to meet for the first time since 2005. ==Head-to-head record== ===All-time record=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Competition !Played !Bristol Rovers wins !Draws !Swindon Town wins |- |Western League |4||1||0||3 |- |Southern League |34||18||3||13 |- |Football League |90||35||16||39 |- !League total!!128!!54!!19!!55 |- |FA Cup |5||3||0||2 |- |Division 3 (South) Cup |1||1||0||0 |- |Football League Trophy |2||1||0||1 |- !Totals !136!!59!!19!!58 |} ===Last meeting=== ==Derby double== When one team beats another in both their league meetings in a single season, this is known as a league double. It is considered to be a sign of superiority of the winning team over the losing team and seen as an impressive achievement, particularly if the losing team is generally thought of as being a strong side. Swindon Town have completed the league double over Bristol Rovers a total of twelve times: once in the Western League, once in the Southern League and ten times in the English Football League (EFL). Rovers meanwhile have recorded double victories over Swindon ten times: four times in the Southern League and six in the EFL. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:85%;\" !rowspan=\"2\"|Season!!rowspan=\"2\"|Division!!rowspan=\"2\"|Winner!!colspan=\"2\"|Results |- !Home!!Away |- |1897\u20131898||style=\"text-align:left;\"|Western League Professional Section||style=\"text-align:left; background:#DD0000; color:white;\"|Swindon Town||3\u20130||1\u20130 |- |1900\u20131901||style=\"text- align:left;\"|Southern League Division One||style=\"text-align:left; background:#2B60DE; color:white;\"|Bristol Rovers||1\u20130||1\u20130 |- |1901\u20131902||style=\"text-align:left;\"|Southern League Division One||style=\"text-align:left; background:#2B60DE; color:white;\"|Bristol Rovers||1\u20130||1\u20130 |- |1902\u20131903||style=\"text-align:left;\"|Southern League Division One||style=\"text-align:left; background:#DD0000; color:white;\"|Swindon Town||2\u20131||3\u20132 |- |1903\u20131904||style=\"text- align:left;\"|Southern League Division One||style=\"text-align:left; background:#2B60DE; color:white;\"|Bristol Rovers||2\u20130||2\u20130 |- |1905\u20131906||style=\"text-align:left;\"|Southern League Division One||style=\"text-align:left; background:#2B60DE; color:white;\"|Bristol Rovers||2\u20131||2\u20131 |- |1924\u20131925||style=\"text-align:left;\"|Football League Division Three (South)||style=\"text-align:left; background:#DD0000; color:white;\"|Swindon Town||3\u20130||1\u20130 |- |1925\u20131926||style=\"text- align:left;\"|Football League Division Three (South)||style=\"text-align:left; background:#DD0000; color:white;\"|Swindon Town||4\u20132||2\u20131 |- |1926\u20131927||style=\"text-align:left;\"|Football League Division Three (South)||style=\"text-align:left; background:#2B60DE; color:white;\"|Bristol Rovers||3\u20131||5\u20133 |- |1928\u20131929||style=\"text-align:left;\"|Football League Division Three (South)||style=\"text-align:left; background:#DD0000; color:white;\"|Swindon Town||2\u20131||4\u20131 |- |1931\u20131932||style=\"text- align:left;\"|Football League Division Three (South)||style=\"text-align:left; background:#DD0000; color:white;\"|Swindon Town||2\u20131||2\u20130 |- |1937\u20131938||style=\"text-align:left;\"|Football League Division Three (South)||style=\"text-align:left; background:#DD0000; color:white;\"|Swindon Town||2\u20131||2\u20131 |- |1950\u20131951||style=\"text-align:left;\"|Football League Division Three (South)||style=\"text-align:left; background:#2B60DE; color:white;\"|Bristol Rovers||1\u20130||2\u20131 |- |1965\u20131966||style=\"text- align:left;\"|Football League Division Three||style=\"text-align:left; background:#DD0000; color:white;\"|Swindon Town||4\u20133||1\u20130 |- |1966\u20131967||style=\"text-align:left;\"|Football League Division Three||style=\"text-align:left; background:#2B60DE; color:white;\"|Bristol Rovers||3\u20130||1\u20130 |- |1967\u20131968||style=\"text-align:left;\"|Football League Division Three||style=\"text-align:left; background:#DD0000; color:white;\"|Swindon Town||4\u20131||2\u20131 |- |1981\u20131982||style=\"text- align:left;\"|Football League Division Three||style=\"text-align:left; background:#DD0000; color:white;\"|Swindon Town||5\u20132||4\u20131 |- |1990\u20131991||style=\"text-align:left;\"|Football League Division Two||style=\"text-align:left; background:#2B60DE; color:white;\"|Bristol Rovers||2\u20131||2\u20130 |- |1995\u20131996||style=\"text-align:left;\"|Football League Division Two||style=\"text-align:left; background:#DD0000; color:white;\"|Swindon Town||2\u20131||4\u20131 |- |2007\u20132008||style=\"text- align:left;\"|Football League One||style=\"text-align:left; background:#DD0000; color:white;\"|Swindon Town||1\u20130||1\u20130 |- |2009\u20132010||style=\"text- align:left;\"|Football League One||style=\"text-align:left; background:#2B60DE; color:white;\"|Bristol Rovers||3\u20130||4\u20130 |- |2016\u20132017||style=\"text- align:left;\"|EFL League One||style=\"text-align:left; background:#2B60DE; color:white;\"|Bristol Rovers||1\u20130||2\u20131 |} ==Records== *Highest aggregate score: 9 **Bristol Rovers 7\u20132 Swindon Town, Southern League Division One, 11 November 1899 *Highest Bristol Rovers score: 7 **Bristol Rovers 7\u20132 Swindon Town, Southern League Division One, 11 November 1899 *Highest Swindon Town score: 5 **Swindon Town 5\u20130 Bristol Rovers, Southern League Division One, 26 December 1913 **Swindon Town 5\u20132 Bristol Rovers, Football League Division Three, 6 March 1982 *Biggest margin of victory: 5 **Bristol Rovers 7\u20132 Swindon Town, Southern League Division One, 11 November 1899 **Swindon Town 5\u20130 Bristol Rovers, Southern League Division One, 26 December 1913 ==Crossing the divide== ===Players=== Numerous players have represented both Bristol Rovers and Swindon Town in their careers during the since both clubs have been in existence.
