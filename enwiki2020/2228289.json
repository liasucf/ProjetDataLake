He would play under the names Lost Child and Harmony Bandits before Ours formed officially in 1992. Gnecco's first album, Sour (1994), was a demo compilation with which he was dissatisfied. In 2005 he said, \"In 1994, I was only 20 years old, and labels with offering record deals to me, but I knew I was too young, that's not where I was going yet. So, I made one demo record with that Ours line-up and then left it; I didn't want to be known as the ex-singer from those Sour recordings. The band on Sour is not Ours- we were just a bunch of young kids, just messing around. I wasn't allowed to be insane, like I wanted, and I had no patience, and wondered why we felt we had to put it out.\" In 1997, he signed to DreamWorks Records and released two records under the label before its disbandment. Ours released their fourth record 'Ballet the Boxer I' on their own label Cage Recording Co.
