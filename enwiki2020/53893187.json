    "text": "This is a list of the mammal species recorded in Zanzibar. These are the mammal species in Zanzibar and Pemba islands of eastern coast of Tanzania Archipelago. The first detailed work on mammalian diversity of these two islands was done from 1942 to 1983. Out of 53 mammals found in Zanzibar, 17 species are found only in Zanzibar islands, whereas 6 species are restricted to Pemba Island and 17 others found in both islands. Seven introduced species such as mongooses, pigs and rat species are also abundant. The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\" |- | EX ||Extinct|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died. |- | EW ||Extinct in the wild|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized population well outside its historic range. |- | CR ||Critically endangered|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild. |- | EN ||Endangered|| The species is facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild. |- | VU ||Vulnerable|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. |- | NT ||Near threatened|| The species does not currently qualify as being at high risk of extinction but it is likely to do so in the future. |- | LC ||Least concern|| The species is not currently at risk of extinction in the wild. |- | DD ||Data deficient|| There is inadequate information to assess the risk of extinction for this species. |} Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of near threatened and least concern categories: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\" |- | LR/cd || Lower risk/conservation dependent || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued. |- | LR/nt || Lower risk/near threatened || Species which are close to being classified as vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes. |- | LR/lc || Lower risk/least concern || Species for which there are no identifiable risks. |} The mammals restricted only to Pemba Island are highlighted by P. ==Subclass: Theria== ===Infraclass: Eutheria=== ====Order: Eulipotyphla (shrews)==== The order Eulipotyphla contains the shrews of southern Africa and the shrew moles, comprising four living families of small mammals that were traditionally part of the order Insectivora. *Family: Soricidae (musk shrews) **Subfamily: Crocidurinae ***Genus: Crocidura **** Greater red musk shrew, Crocidura flavescens ssp. nyansae LC **** Bicolored musk shrew, Crocidura fuscomurina ssp. sansibarica LC **** Savanna path shrew, Crocidura viaria ssp. suahelae LC ***Genus: Suncus **** Asian house shrew, Suncus murinus LC ====Order: Macroscelidea (elephant shrews)==== \\---- Often called elephant shrews or jumping shrews are native to southern Africa. *Family: Macroscelididae (elephant-shrews) **Genus: Petrodromus *** Four-toed elephant shrew, Petrodromus tetradactylus ssp. zanzibaricus LC **Genus: Rhynchocyon *** Black and rufous elephant shrew, Rhynchocyon petersi ssp. adersi VU ====Order: Chiroptera (bats)==== \\---- Bats are the only true fliers in mammalian stock.
