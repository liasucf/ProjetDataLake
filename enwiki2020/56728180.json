    "text": "Free schools listed on this page all have formal local authority representation on the board of trustees. The list is not exhaustive. It is possible for a local authority to sponsor a free school in partnership with other organisations, provided they have no more than a 19.9% representation on the board. In some cases the local authority sponsoring the trust is different to the local authority in which the school resides, so in those cases the partnering local authority has also been listed. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Local Authority!!Free School!!Academy Trust!!Partnering Local Authority |- |Hertfordshire||Alban City School||Alban City Free School Ltd||N/A |- |- |Hertfordshire||Ascot Road Community Free School||West Herts Community Free School Trust||N/A |- |- |London Borough of Hackney||City of London Academy, Shoreditch Park||City of London Academies Trust||City of London Corporation |- |- |London Borough of Islington||City of London Academy, Highgate Hill||City of London Academies Trust||City of London Corporation |- |- |London Borough of Islington||City of London Primary Academy||City of London Academies Trust||City of London Corporation |- |- |London Borough of Kingston||The Kingston Academy||Kingston Educational Trust||N/A |- |- |London Borough of Redbridge||Beacon Business Innovation Hub||Beacon Multi-Academy Trust Limited||N/A |- |- |London Borough of Richmond upon Thames||Richmond upon Thames School||The Richmond Upon Thames School Trust||N/A |- |- |London Borough of Southwark||Galleywall Primary Academy||City of London Academies Trust||City of London Corporation |- |- |Sunderland||Beacon of Light School||Beacon of Light School||N/A |- |- |Worcestershire||ContinU Plus Academy||ContinU Plus Academy Trust||N/A |- |} ==References== Category:Free schools in England Category:Free Schools with a Local Authority Sponsor Category:Lists of organisations based in England ",
