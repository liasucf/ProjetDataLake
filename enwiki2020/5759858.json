    "text": "Middle Park is a former railway station on the former St Kilda railway line, located in the Melbourne suburb of Middle Park. The station is located on the corner of Canterbury Road and Armstrong Street. A pair of low level side platforms now serve route 96 trams on a light rail line. Other nearby light rail stops are the Fraser Street stop and the Wright Street stop. These and other stops were added after the line was converted to a light rail tram line. ==History== Middle Park station opened in 1883, long after the line through it was opened in 1857. The St Kilda line was closed in 1987 and converted to light rail, with the route 96 tram now running through the former station. The last train service ran on 31 July 1987 with the light rail officially commissioned on 21 November the same year. The high level platforms used by trains were demolished for the construction of lower level platforms, leaving the station building at the original level. The building was redeveloped as a cafe in 2006 called Mart 130, but it was gutted by fire on 19 February 2018, and later demolished. It is due to be reconstructed in 2019 ==References== Category:Disused railway stations in Melbourne Category:Railway stations in Australia opened in 1883 Category:Railway stations closed in 1987 Category:1987 disestablishments in Australia ",
