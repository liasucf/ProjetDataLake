A 2011 Esquire article described his close friendship with a former member of Saddam's police force whom Clemente trained in Iraq in 2004 to be a terrorist hunter and became, in the view of U.S. experts, \"the best terrorist hunter alive.\" The article depicted the two men's activities in Iraq, hunting down and \"turning\" terrorists. ===Military=== After leaving the FBI, Clemente returned to Iraq in 2007 to serve as an adviser to the U.S. military. He spent eight months in Iraq working as an embedded Counter Improvised Explosive Device Investigator with the U.S. Army 3rd Corps.

Clemente's claim, that the government maintained records of private phone calls, attracted considerable media attention and commentary. ===Comments on Muslim influx into U.S.=== In a July 2015 interview, Clemente said that it was impossible for the FBI to cope with the influx into the U.S. of people from the Muslim world who may be terrorists or potential terrorists.
