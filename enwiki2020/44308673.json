In 1796, it was transformed to Tver Governorate. The area of the viceroyalty is currently split between Tver and Moscow Oblasts. Minor parts of Tver Viceroyalty also currently belong to Yaroslavl and Novgorod Oblasts. == History == In the 18th century, the areas which were later occupied by Tver Governorate were split between Moscow and Novgorod Governorates. On November 25, 1775 Tver Viceroyalty was established with the administrative center in Tver. It included Tver Province and Vyshnevolotsky Uyezd of Novgorod Governorage, as well as Uglich Province and some minor areas, including Vesyegonsk, of Moscow Governorate.
