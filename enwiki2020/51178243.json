Members of this tribe include: Canina: The wolf-like canines (genus Canis, Cuon, and Lycaon) include the domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), gray wolf (Canis lupus), red wolf (Canis rufus), eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), coyote (Canis latrans), Eurasian golden jackal (Canis aureus), African golden wolf (Canis anthus), Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus), dhole (Cuon alpinus), and African wild dog (Lycaon pictus). Cerdocyonina: The South American canines include the bush dog (Speothos venaticus), hoary fox (Lycalopex uetulus), crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), and maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus). Members of the subtribe Canina produce canid hybrids due to their shared karyotype of 78 chromosomes arranged in 39 pairs. The cladogram below is based on the phylogeny of Lindblad-Toh et al. (2005), modified to incorporate recent findings on Canis species, Lycalopex species, and Dusicyon. ==References== ==External links== Category:Mammal tribes Category:Canines ",
