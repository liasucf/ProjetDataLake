    "text": "\"Requiem\" is a song by English post-punk band Killing Joke. It was released in September 1980 by E.G. Records as the second single from their eponymous debut studio album. ==Release== \"Requiem\" was released on 26 September 1980 on 7\" vinyl by E.G. Records and Malicious Damage as the second single from the band's debut self-titled studio album, backed by the B-side \"Change\". A 12\" version of the single was also released, featuring \"Change\" and a demo of \"Requiem\" as the B-sides. The single did not chart in the UK, but it reached number 43 on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart. ==Cover versions== The song was covered in 1997 by American rock band Foo Fighters as one of the B-sides to their song \"Everlong\", and was included in the 2007 re-release of their album The Colour and the Shape. British industrial metal band Godflesh performed \"Requiem\" live on their 2001 tour in support of the album Hymns. For that tour, the group was accompanied by Killing Joke bassist Paul Raven and, in one instance, by Killing Joke singer Jaz Coleman. Requiem was covered by the British post-punk band Eagulls in 2013 as the B-side to their \"Nerve Endings\" single, which received a limited release on 7\" vinyl. The French band LANE (Love and Noise Experiment), created by ex-members of the Thugs and Daria, 2 bands from Angers, covered it live during its 2018 tour, and then recorded a studio version in 2019 that can be found on Spotify. ==Track listing== ===7\" vinyl=== * E.G. / Malicious Damage \u2014 EGMD 1.0 ===12\" vinyl=== * E.G. / Malicious Damage \u2014 EGMDX 1.0 ==Personnel== * Jaz Coleman \u2013 lead vocals, synthesizer, lyrics, production * Geordie Walker \u2013 guitar, production * Youth \u2013 bass guitar, production * Paul Ferguson \u2013 drums, backing vocals, production ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Charts (1980) !Peak position |- | US Hot Dance Club Songs (Billboard)[ \"Killing Joke > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles\"].
