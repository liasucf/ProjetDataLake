    "text": "This list of historical markers installed by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) in Negros is an annotated list of people, places, or events in the region that have been commemorated by cast-iron plaques issued by the said commission. The plaques themselves are permanent signs installed in publicly visible locations on buildings, monuments, or in special locations. While many Cultural Properties have historical markers installed, not all places marked with historical markers are designated into one of the particular categories of Cultural Properties. ==Negros Occidental== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:90%; text-align:center;\" |- !
