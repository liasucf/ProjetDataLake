    "text": "Kieran Neil Wallace (born 26 January 1995) is an English footballer who plays as a defender for Burton Albion. ==Career== === Nottingham Forest === Wallace started his career with Nottingham Forest before joining Ilkeston in summer 2014 on a non - contract basis. === Sheffield United === On 28 November 2014, Sheffield United completed the signing of Wallace on a deal until the end of the season. He made his debut on 13 December 2014 away at Fleetwood Town in a 1\u20131 draw. On 26 March 2015, Wallace joined Lincoln City on loan until the end of the season. At the end of the 2014\u20132015 season \"The Blades\" opted to extend their right to a further year on the contract for Wallace. During the pre- season, new manager Nigel Adkins played Wallace primarily at centre half, as opposed to his more customary midfield role. Adkins commented on how well Wallace was impressing in the new role and indeed Wallace has appeared regularly at the beginning of the season, again in a new defensive position, this time at left back. After spending the majority of the 2016\u201317 season on loan at Fleetwood Town, his contract with the Blades was terminated by mutual consent on 16 August 2017. ===Matlock Town=== Kieran joined Matlock Town F.C. on 7 October 2017 and made his debut on that day starting at left back against Stalybridge Celtic F.C. ===Burton Albion=== He joined Burton Albion in 2019. ===International career=== Wallace has represented England Under-17s at international level. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Ilkeston |2014\u201315 ||NPL Premier Division |17||1||3||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||1||0||21||1 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Sheffield United |2014\u201315 ||League One |4||0||0||0||2||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||6||0 |- |2015\u201316 |League One |11 |0 |1 |0 |2 |0 |3 |0 |17 |0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !15 !0 !1 !0 !4 !0 !3 !0 !23 !0 |- |Lincoln City (loan) |2014\u201315 |Conference Premier |6||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||6||0 |- | rowspan=\"1\" |Fleetwood Town (loan) |2016\u201317 ||League One |0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0||2||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !38!!1!!4!!0!!4!!0!!6!!0!!52!!1 |} ==References== ==External links== * *England profile at the FA Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Nottingham Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Ilkeston F.C. players Category:Sheffield United F.C. players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:Fleetwood Town F.C. players Category:Matlock Town F.C. players Category:Burton Albion F.C. players Category:Northern Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players ",
