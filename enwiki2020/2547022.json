This airport is operated by the Town of Provincetown on land leased from the U.S. National Park Service., retrieved 2007-03-15 The airport is used for general aviation and by one commercial airline, Cape Air, which operates non-stop flights of 25 minutes duration to Boston's Logan International Airport. During the off- season, Cape Air operates three daily flights each way. On summer weekends, flights are scheduled approximately every 45 minutes in both directions. The airport recently added complimentary high-speed internet access for all passengers and crew members utilizing the facility. A limited amount of free parking is available for vehicles used by general and commercial aviation passengers. Aircraft parking is available from Cape Air, the fixed-base operator (FBO). ==History== The airport was constructed in the 1940s and the runway was first paved in 1948. The original transitions to the taxiways were curved, or jug-handle-shaped to support tail-draggers like the DC-3 that operated at the airport in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1949, Provincetown-Boston Airlines started scheduled air service between Provincetown and Boston using Cessna Bobcats. Through a series of mergers, PBA was eventually acquired by People's Express and which later merged with Continental Airlines and in 1988, Continental cancelled the Provincetown - Boston route. Cape Air began operations that same year and continues to serve Provincetown today. The present terminal building is a single-story wooden structure and was constructed in 1998. The terminal provides Cape Air check-in and a waiting area, TSA screening areas, and a conference room. ==Facilities and aircraft== Provincetown Municipal Airport covers an area of . {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"3\" |Runway information |- |Dimensions | colspan=\"2\" |3502 x 100 ft. / 1067 x 30m |- |Surface | colspan=\"2\" | Asphalt, in good condition |- |Weight bearing capacity | colspan=\"2\" |Single wheel: 25.0 |- |Runway edge lights | colspan=\"2\" |High intensity |- ! !Runway 7 !Runway 25 |- |Latitude |42-04.189783N |42-04.484083N |- |Longitude |070-13.576812W |070-12.911400W |- |Elevation (MSL) |7.6 ft |7.8 ft |- |Traffic pattern |Left |Right |- |Runway heading |075 magnetic 059 true |255 magnetic 239 true |- |Markings |Precision, in good condition |Precision, in good condition |- |Visual slope indicator |4-light PAPI on right (3.00 degrees glide path) |4-light PAPI on right (3.00 degrees glide path) VGSI and descent angle not coincident |- |Approach lights | MALSF: 1,400 foot medium intensity approach lighting system with sequenced flashers | None |- |Runway end identifier lights |Yes |Yes |- |Touchdown point |Yes, no lights |Yes, no lights |- |Instrument approach | ILS/DME, RNAV (GPS) | NDB, RNAV (GPS) |- |Obstructions |12 ft. brush, 800 ft. from runway, 125 ft. left of centerline |12 ft. trees, 610 ft. from runway, 125 ft. left of centerline, 34:1 slope to clear |} For the 12-month period ending September 1, 2016, the airport averaged 136 operations per day: 85% transient general aviation, 8% commercial, 2% air taxi, 4% local general aviation and <1% military.
