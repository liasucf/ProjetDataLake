    "text": "The Corionototae were a group of Ancient Britons apparently inhabiting what is now Northern England about whom very little is known. They were recorded in one Roman votary inscription (now lost) from Corbridge, of uncertain date, which commemorated the victory of a prefect of cavalry, Quintus Calpurnius Concessinius, over them.Roman Inscriptions of Britain: RIB 1142. Altar dedicated by Quintus Calpurnius Concessinius Historians tend to categorise them either as a tribe or a sub-tribe of the Brigantes in the absence of any information.David Shotter, Roman Britain, Routledge (2012)Barry Cunliffe, Iron Age Communities in Britain Routledge (2006) p. 189 The name Corionototae appears to contain the Celtic roots *korio- meaning an army (Irish cuire) and *towta- meaning members of a tribe or people, thus it would appear to mean \"tribal army\" or \"people's army\" which might suggest rather a military or political formation opposed to Rome; T.M. Charles-Edwards suggests a tribal name based on a proposed deity *Corionos instead.Charles-Edwards,Native Political Organisation in Roman Britain and the Origin of Middle Welsh Brenhin in Antiquitates Indogermanicae, M Mayrhofer (ed.) (1994) On the basis of the similarity of the names, writers such as Waldman and MasonEncyclopedia of European Peoples, Infobase (2006) have suggested a link with the Irish Coriondi while other earlier writers, erroneously linking the name to the Gaelic Cruthin, thought it could refer to the Picts.David Mattingly, An Imperial Possession: Britain in the Roman Empire, Penguin (2007) ==References== Category:Celtic Britons Category:History of Northumberland Category:Iron Age Europe Category:Historical Celtic peoples ",
