    "text": "The Shabak Militia is an armed group that formed in 2014, with around 1,500 militiamen, to regain control of the Nineveh region from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Based on photographs of the group, Quwwat Sahl Ninawa was formed with the assistance of the Badr Organization. Further goals, beyond regaining control of the region, were to protect against and oppose ISIS. The Iraq Parliament Representative of the Shabak Community, Salim Juma, obtained a verbal approval to form this militia for the purposes stated. Juma informed news sources of this move in September 2014, the group officially formed as the Quwat Sahl N\u012bnaw\u0101 (QSN) on November 23, 2014. Videos later released by the group, however, appear to only show 500 fighters at most, though accurate estimates can not be drawn from said videos. ==References== Category:Anti-ISIL factions in Iraq Category:Paramilitary forces of Iraq Category:Popular Mobilization Forces Category:Shabak people Category:Shia Islamist groups Category:2014 establishments in Iraq Category:Military units and formations established in 2014 ",
