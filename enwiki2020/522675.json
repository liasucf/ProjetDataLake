    "text": "Lyle David Mays (November 27, 1953 - February 10, 2020) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and member of the Pat Metheny Group. Metheny and Mays composed and arranged nearly all of the group's music, for which Mays won eleven Grammy Awards. ==Biography== While growing up, Mays had four main interests: chess, mathematics, architecture, and music. His mother Doris played piano and organ and his father Cecil, a truck driver, taught himself to play guitar. His teacher allowed him to practice improvisation after the structured elements of the lesson were completed. At age nine he played organ at a family member's wedding, and at age fourteen he began to play in church. In summer camp he was introduced to jazz pianist Marian McPartland. Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival and Filles de Kilimanjaro by Miles Davis (both recorded in 1968) were important influences. He graduated from the University of North Texas after attending the University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire. He composed and arranged for the One O'Clock Lab Band and was the composer and arranger for the Grammy Award-nominated album Lab 75. After leaving North Texas, Mays toured with Woody Herman's group for approximately eight months. In 1975 he met Pat Metheny and later founded the Pat Metheny Group. Mays won ten Grammy awards and was nominated twenty-three times. In an interview with JAZZIZ magazine in 2016 Mays said he had been working as a music software manager because of changes in the music industry. ==Work== Mays composed and arranged as a member of the Pat Metheny Group, playing piano, organ, keyboards, synthesizer, and occasionally trumpet, accordion, agog\u00f4 bells, autoharp, toy xylophone, and electric guitar. He composed and recorded children's audio books, such as East of the Sun, West of the Moon, Moses the Lawgiver, The Lion and the Lamb, The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher, and Tale of Peter Rabbit with text read by Meryl Streep. Metheny's and Mays' compositions were performed by the Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago in a production of Orphans by Lyle Kessler. He composed classical music, such as \"Twelve Days in the Shadow of a Miracle\", a piece for harp, flute, viola, and synthesizer recorded in 1996 by the Debussy Trio. Apart from the Metheny group, he performed in a trio with Marc Johnson and Peter Erskine and formed the Lyle Mays Quartet with Eric Hochberg, Mark Walker, and Bob Sheppard. An amateur architect, he designed his sister Joan's house and was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright. ==Death== Mays died in Los Angeles, at the age of 66, on February 10, 2020 \"after a long battle with a recurring illness\". ==Discography== ===As leader=== * As Falls Wichita, So Falls Wichita Falls with Pat Metheny (ECM, 1981) * Lyle Mays (Geffen, 1986) * Street Dreams (Geffen, 1988) * Fictionary (Geffen, 1993) * Solo: Improvisations for Expanded Piano (Warner Bros., 2000) * The Ludwigsburg Concert (Jazzhaus, 2015) With the Pat Metheny Group * Pat Metheny Group (ECM, 1978) * American Garage (ECM, 1979) * Offramp (ECM, 1982) * Travels (ECM, 1983) * First Circle (ECM, 1984) * The Falcon and the Snowman (EMI, 1985) * Still Life (Talking) (Geffen, 1987) * Letter from Home (Geffen, 1989) * The Road to You (Geffen, 1993) * We Live Here (Geffen, 1995) * Quartet (Geffen, 1996) * Imaginary Day (Warner Bros, 1997) * Speaking of Now (Warner Bros., 2002) * The Way Up (Nonesuch, 2005) ===As sideman=== * Pedro Aznar, Contemplacion (Interdisc, 1985) * Betty Buckley, Betty Buckley (Rizzoli, 1986) * Igor Butman, Falling Out (Impromptu, 1993) * Woody Herman, Live in Warsaw (Storyville 1991) * Mark Isham, Film Music (Windham Hill, 1985) * Rickie Lee Jones, Girl at Her Volcano (Warner Bros., 1983) * Nando Lauria, Points of View (Narada, 1994) * Paul McCandless, Premonition (Windham Hill, 1992) * Bobby McFerrin, Medicine Music (EMI, 1990) * Pat Metheny, Watercolors (ECM, 1977) * Pat Metheny, Secret Story (Geffen, 1992) * Joni Mitchell, Shadows and Light (Asylum, 1980) * Bob Moses, When Elephants Dream of Music (Gramavision, 1983) * Bob Moses, The Story of Moses (Gramavision, 1987) * Noa, Noa (Geffen, 1994) * Steve Swallow, Home (ECM, 1980) * Toots Thielemans, East Coast West Coast (Private Music 1994) * Eberhard Weber, Later That Evening (ECM, 1982) * Phil Wilson & Rich Matteson, The Sound of the Wasp (1975) ==References== ==External links== * At Jazziz magazine * Podcast Category:American jazz pianists Category:American male pianists Category:1953 births Category:2020 deaths Category:People from Marinette County, Wisconsin Category:University of North Texas College of Music alumni Category:Musicians from Wisconsin Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire alumni Category:Pat Metheny Group members Category:20th- century American pianists Category:21st-century American pianists Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:American male jazz musicians ",
