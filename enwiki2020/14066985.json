    "text": "KKOY-FM (105.5 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a CHR format, with a very heavy Rhythmic-lean. Licensed to Chanute, Kansas, United States, the station serves the Southeast Kansas area. The station is currently owned by MyTown Media, LLC. ==History== 105.5 signed on in the late 1990s, broadcasting ABC Radio Network's Today's Best Hits satellite-fed Hot AC service with the name \"Y105\". The station was owned by Southeast Kansas Broadcasting, Inc. at the time. In 2004, the station cut the satellite feed and provided local programming and changed monikers to \"Sunny 105.5\". The ownership changed to MyTown Media, LLC in September 2008. In January 2009, the station evolved towards a Rhythmic-leaning CHR format and re-branded as \"Hot 105\", being one of only 2 Top 40 stations heard in Southeast Kansas with a good signal (the other being Joplin, Missouri's KSYN). In September 2009, the station started dayparting with Hot AC material played throughout the day and retaining the Rhythmic-leaning CHR format after 9 pm. This would end in March 2011, when the station returned to a more balanced CHR format throughout the day. The station is noted for having a more diverse playlist by playing \"non-charting\" songs that other Top 40 stations may be late on or never play. The station carries St. Paul High School Football and Basketball. ==Trivia== On April 1, 2011, the station was temporarily replaced with a 90s Hits format dubbed \"105.5 The Edge\". The regular format would return later in the day; however, the success of the stunt on the station's Facebook page would result in the creation of \"The 90s Rewind Show\", aired weekend mornings and hosted by former afternoon DJ Paul Myers. ==Current Jocks== *Lindzey - Mornings *Rick Dees - Saturday/Sunday mornings *Romeo - Saturday Night Online - Saturday evenings ==Former Jocks== *\"Uncle\" Dave Lee-Afternoons (January 2009-August 2009) (Currently Operations Manager for Eagle Communications - North Platte, NE)Heard via Voicetracking on KFIX, KHMY, KSJQ and KELN. *Cody-Mornings *Panama Jack-Mornings (syndicated through other MyTown Media stations) *Paul Myers-Afternoons *Big J-Nights ==External links== *Hot 105 Website *MyTown Media, LLC.
