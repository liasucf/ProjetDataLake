    "text": "Zenas Hovey Gurley Sr. (May 29, 1801 \u2013 August 28, 1871) was a leader in the history of the Latter Day Saint movement. He was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on April 1, 1838, and became an elder soon thereafter. By the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, Gurley had been ordained a seventy. Beginning in 1849, Gurley led a branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) in Yellowstone, Wisconsin, in the early years after the succession crisis. In 1852, Gurley broke with James Strang over the issue of plural marriage and was eventually excommunicated from Strang's church. Along with Jason W. Briggs, Gurley became an important early leader of the \"New Organization\" of the church that developed in the Midwest in the 1850s. In 1853, he was called as an apostle in the New Organization, which is today known as the Community of Christ. Along with William Marks, Gurley ordained Joseph Smith III as President of the Church in 1860. Gurley's son Zenas H. Gurley Jr. was called as an RLDS Church apostle in 1873. ==References== *Inez Smith Davis, The Story of the Church: A History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and of Its Legal Successor, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, 12th edition, Herald House: 1981. ==External links== * Category:1801 births Category:1871 deaths Category:American leaders of the Community of Christ Category:Apostles of the Community of Christ Category:Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) members Category:Community of Christ missionaries Category:Converts to Mormonism Category:People excommunicated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) Category:Religious leaders from Wisconsin Category:American Latter Day Saint missionaries Category:Latter Day Saint missionaries in the United States ",
