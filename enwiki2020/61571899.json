Instead, the march is played immediately after their respective service song is played at official ceremonies.https://www.nationalguard.mil/About-the-Guard/NGB- Official-Song/Full-Band/https://www.nationalguard.mil/About-the-Guard/NGB- Official-March/https://www.nationalguard.mil/About-the-Guard/Musical- Archives/NGB-Official-Song/ ==Lyrics== {| |- | :Full Texthttp://www.nationalguard.mil/Portals/31/Documents/About/MusicalAForces/Lyrics.pdf&ved;=2ahUKEwj6gMWa0pLkAhVKUK0KHU5QDekQFjARegQICBAB&usg;=AOvVaw3gtG3xMXgEm4PuLiYC4Z28https://www.scribd.com/document/365098079/Always- Ready-1st-Clarinet :We are the Guard :Soldiers and Airmen all prepared :We are the National Guard :We serve on land and in theair :We go where duty calls :Around the world and here at home :Stand tall in the National Guard :Always Ready, Always There! : :We represent our nation's best :Men and women serving true :In times of strife or nature's wrath :The Guard will always see usthrough! :We rise across the U.S.A. :From sea to sea our lands of air. :We're proud of the National Guard :Always Ready, Always There! : :We serve the call around the world :Nation to nation we support :As friends we work in partnership :To train or fight as duty calls :While here at home, from state to state :Community service we prepare :We serve in the National Guard :Always Ready, Always There! |} == Videos == * Always Ready, Always There on YouTube == References == Category:2016 songs Category:American music Category:American military marches Category:National Guard of the United States Category:United States Army National Guard Category:United States Air National Guard ",
