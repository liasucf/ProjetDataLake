The car was the predecessor to the Dome S102, and the Strakka-Dome S103. The car had its racing debut at the 2001 Barcelona 2 Hours and 30 minutes, the opening round of the 2001 FIA Sportscar Championship, with the Den Bl\u00e5 Avis racing team. == Development == === Dome S101hb === In March 2005, the car was shown to be early in its testing cycle, with the car having been shown testing, in photos released by Dome Co, ahead of the Le Mans Series Prologue at the Circuit Paul Ricard. === Dome S101.5 === Due to new regulations in LMP1 for the upcoming 2007 racing season, which meant that \"Hybrid\" rules LMP1 cars were to be barred from competing in any ACO Sanctioned event, Dome was forced to create a new variant of the car. In a bid to save costs, the lower half of the S101hb monocoque was retained, while a new double roll hoop assembly was attached, in place of the previously used single roll hoop, and air intake. == Competition History == === 2001 === The car had its racing debut at the 2001 Barcelona 2 Hours and 30 minutes, the opening round of the 2001 FIA Sportscar Championship, with the Den Bl\u00e5 Avis racing team. The car was joined by a second car in the championship, entered by Racing for Holland. The car had its inaugural win at the Mistrovstv\u00ed FIA Sportnovn\u00edch Vozu, held at the Brno Circuit, in the Czech Republic. ==== FIA Sportscar Championship- SR1 Teams Championship ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" !Team !Car !Engine !
