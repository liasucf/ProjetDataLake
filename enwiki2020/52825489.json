Harry says that the bishop has never felt the way he does; in response, the bishop finds a box of mementos (a handkerchief and dried violets) from an affair of long ago, and starts to tell Harry a story. The following scenes are a representation of the story. ===Act 1=== Scene from Romance. Maxine Elliott Theatre, 1913 About 1867, there is an evening reception at the house of Cornelius van Tuyl, a wealthy banker. The guests include Madame Margherita Cavallini, an Italian opera star. Tom, the rector of St Giles (the bishop in younger days) is a friend of van Tuyl, who supports his church work. Van Tuyl expects Tom to say he wants to marry his niece Susan; instead, Tom says he disapproves of his association with Mme Cavallini, who has a bad reputation. When Mme Cavallini (Rita) enters with her admirers, she and Tom immediately notice each other. Tom awkwardly introduces himself to her, and she is interested in him. She says their moment together is like her bouquet of violets, to enjoy before they die. He wants to see her again, and she asks him to come to her hotel apartment. All this time he does not know who she is; as she leaves, she asks van Tuyl to tell him. ===Act 2=== The scene is the study of St Giles' rectory, on the afternoon of New Year's Eve, a few weeks later. Miss Armstrong, Tom's aunt, is anxious about Tom's affair with Rita, and asks van Tuyl to \"save him from that dreadful woman\". When Rita arrives, van Tuyl tells her she is amusing herself at Tom's expense. Tom arrives and the others go to tea; he talks to Rita. He says that love is finding the woman you want to live with all your life; she says it is like a little light in all the darkness. He asks her to marry him, but she says there is a reason she cannot. He tells her it will be all right if she repents of her sinful past. He is alarmed when he learns she had a relationship with van Tuyl, but she says it was not serious. Tom announces to van Tuyl that they are engaged, and he congratulates them. But Rita says she was van Tuyl's mistress until she met Tom. Tom is appalled, and Rita leaves. ===Act 3=== In her apartment later that evening, Rita is triumphant after her performance, and speaks from her balcony to the crowd below. Van Tuyl congratulates her. He tries to get her to eat the meal that has been prepared, but she is not hungry. She is going away the next day; he suggests that he goes away with her. She has a pistol, saying she will kill herself: that in the last weeks she has found something good in the world, but now cannot change. Van Tuyl leaves by a back way as Tom arrives. Tom, seeing van Tuyl's card and two glasses, thinks they have had a passionate meeting. Tom passionately says he wants to save Rita from her sinful life, but then declares his love. Rita says she will kill herself if he touches her. Finally he hears the chimes of midnight and the church procession which he has organized; his manner changes and he leaves to join them. ===Epilogue=== The scene is as for the prologue; the bishop has finished his story. Harry, misunderstanding that the bishop's purpose was to sympathize with youthful impetuousness rather than encourage it, says he has been an ass to hesitate, and will marry Lucille. Harry's sister Suzette comes in; she sees in the paper an obituary of Mme Cavallini, and unaware of the connection with her grandfather, she reads it out; the opera singer never married. ==Critical reception== The critic Walter Prichard Eaton wrote about the original production:\"What bishops do in their youth\". Walter Prichard Eaton, Plays and Players: Leaves from a Critic's Scrapbook (1916), page 66. > This drama... achieves... a consistent and unfailing atmosphere, or perhaps > it would be better to say mood. It is keyed to a certain emotional note, and > it does not slump at any time into the merely sensational. To be sure, some > of the players, and more particularly one player, Mr. William Courteney, do > their best to make it sensational, to drop it to quite another level.... Mr. > Sheldon has here, it seems to us, come nearer to consistent, plausible, and > really human characterization than in any work he has so far written.... > They are real people, humanly felt, in \"Romance\", and they behave according > to their natures.... Certainly the main story has coherence, charm, force > and a real touch of romantic glamour, and it provides a very fine acting > part for Miss Doris Keane....Cavallini is wayward, capricious, alternate > smiles and moodiness....

In striking contrast to Mr. Courtenay's undisciplined exhibition is > the acting of A. E. Anson as Van Tuyl, a gem of a performance.... Mr. > Anson's complete command of the resources of his art is a treat to all > lovers of acting, and his suave ease upon the stage a thing to be copied by > many a player. ==Adaptations== * Romance (1913), a novel by Acton Davies (1870\u20131916).Romance: a novel by Acton Davies National Library of Australia, accessed January 10, 2017.
