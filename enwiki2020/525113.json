    "text": "Tombstone is a 1993 American Western film directed by George P. Cosmatos, written by Kevin Jarre (who was also the original director, but was replaced early in production), and starring Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer, with Sam Elliott, Bill Paxton, Powers Boothe, Michael Biehn, and Dana Delany in supporting roles, as well as narration by Robert Mitchum. The film is loosely based on events in Tombstone, Arizona, including the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and the Earp Vendetta Ride, during the 1880s. It depicts a number of Western outlaws and lawmen, such as Wyatt Earp, William Brocius, Johnny Ringo, and Doc Holliday. Tombstone was released by Hollywood Pictures in theatrical wide release in the United States on December 25, 1993, grossing $56.5 million in domestic ticket sales. The film was a financial success, and for the Western genre, it ranks number 16 in the list of highest-grossing films since 1979. Critical reception was generally positive, with Kilmer's performance receiving critical acclaim. The film has become a cult classic since its release. The Making of Tombstone, a book about the film, was published in 2018.The Making of Tombstone: Behind the Scenes of the Classic Modern Western (2018), by John Farkis, ==Plot== In 1879, members of an outlaw gang known to wear red sashes called the Cowboys, led by \"Curly Bill\" Brocius, ride into a Mexican town and interrupt a local police officer's wedding. They then proceed to massacre the assembled policemen in retribution for killing two of their fellow gang members. Shortly before being shot, a local priest warns them that their acts of murder and savagery will be avenged, referencing the biblical fourth horseman. Wyatt Earp, a retired peace officer with a notable reputation, reunites with his brothers Virgil and Morgan in Tucson, Arizona, where they venture on toward Tombstone to settle down. There they encounter Wyatt's long-time friend Doc Holliday, who is seeking relief in the dry climate from his worsening tuberculosis. Josephine Marcus and Mr. Fabian are also newly arrived with a traveling theater troupe. Meanwhile, Wyatt's common- law wife, Mattie Blaylock, is becoming dependent on laudanum. Wyatt and his brothers begin to profit from a stake in a gambling emporium and saloon when they have their first encounter with the Cowboys. As tensions rise, Wyatt is pressured to help rid the town of the Cowboys, though he is no longer a lawman. Curly Bill begins shooting at the sky after a visit to an opium den and is told by Marshal Fred White to relinquish his firearms. Curly Bill instead shoots the marshal dead, and is forcibly taken into custody by Wyatt. The arrest infuriates Ike Clanton and the other Cowboys. Curly Bill stands trial, but is found not guilty due to a lack of witnesses. Virgil, unable to tolerate lawlessness, becomes the new marshal and imposes a weapons ban within the city limits. This leads to a gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in which Billy Clanton and the McLaury brothers are killed. Virgil and Morgan are wounded, and the allegiance of county sheriff Johnny Behan with the Cowboys is made clear. As retribution for the Cowboy deaths, Wyatt's brothers are ambushed; Morgan is killed, while Virgil is left handicapped. A despondent Wyatt and his family leave Tombstone and board a train, with Ike Clanton and Frank Stilwell close behind, preparing to ambush them. Wyatt sees that his family leaves safely, and then surprises the assassins. He kills Stilwell, but lets Clanton live to send a message: Wyatt announces that he is a U.S. marshal, and that he intends to kill any man he sees wearing a red sash. Wyatt, Doc, a reformed Cowboy named Sherman McMasters, Texas Jack Vermillion, and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson, form a posse to seek revenge. Wyatt and his posse are ambushed in a riverside forest by the Cowboys. Wyatt walks into the creek, miraculously surviving the enemy fire, and kills Curly Bill along with many of his men. Curly Bill's second-in-command, Johnny Ringo, becomes the new head of the Cowboys. When Doc's health worsens, the group is accommodated by Henry Hooker at his ranch. Ringo lures McMasters into the Cowboys' clutches under the pretense of parley and then sends a messenger (dragging McMasters' corpse) to tell Wyatt that he wants a showdown to end the hostilities; Wyatt agrees. Wyatt sets off for the showdown, not knowing that Doc has already arrived at the scene. Doc confronts a surprised Ringo, who was expecting Wyatt, and challenges him to a duel to finish their \u201cgame,\u201d which Ringo accepts (Doc and Ringo have already had a couple of stand offs in Tombstone that were ultimately broken up). Wyatt runs when he hears a gunshot, only to encounter Doc, who has killed Ringo. They then press on to complete their task of eliminating the Cowboys, although Clanton escapes their vengeance by renouncing his red sash. Doc is sent to a sanatorium in Colorado, where he dies of his illness. At Doc's urging, Wyatt pursues Josephine to begin a new life. ==Cast== * Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp * Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday * Sam Elliott as Virgil Earp * Bill Paxton as Morgan Earp * Powers Boothe as \"Curly Bill\" Brocius * Michael Biehn as Johnny Ringo * Charlton Heston as Henry Hooker * Jason Priestley as Billy Breakenridge * Jon Tenney as Sheriff Johnny Behan * Stephen Lang as Ike Clanton * Thomas Haden Church as Billy Clanton * Dana Delany as Josephine Marcus * Paula Malcomson as Allie Earp * Lisa Collins as Louisa Earp * John Philbin as Tom McLaury * Dana Wheeler-Nicholson as Mattie Blaylock * Joanna Pacu\u0142a as Big Nose Kate * Michael Rooker as Sherman McMasters * Harry Carey, Jr. as Marshal Fred White * Billy Bob Thornton as Johnny Tyler * Tomas Arana as Frank Stilwell * Paul Ben-Victor as \"Indian Charlie\" Cruz * Robert John Burke as Frank McLaury * Billy Zane as Mr. Fabian * John Corbett as Johnny Barnes * Buck Taylor as \"Turkey Creek\" Jack Johnson * Terry O'Quinn as Mayor John Clum * Peter Sherayko as John \"Texas Jack\" Vermillion * Wyatt Earp III as Billy Claiborne * Robert Mitchum as Narrator ==Production== The film was shot primarily on location in Arizona. Shooting began in May 1993. The film was supposed to be screenwriter Kevin Jarre's first job as director, but he was quickly overwhelmed by the job\u2013failing to get needed shots and falling behind the shooting schedule. A month into filming, he was fired by producer Andrew Vajna and replaced with George P. Cosmatos. Michael Biehn, a close friend of Jarre, considered quitting. Biehn recalled feeling (director) Cosmatos \"...had no understanding or appreciation of the screenplay.\" By the time of Cosmatos' arrival, though, all actors stayed on board.Jason Priestley (May 6, 2014). Jason Priestley: A Memoir. HarperOne. . Retrieved November 7, 2015. The new director brought a demanding, hard-nosed sensibility to the set, which led to conflicts with some of the crew members (most famously with cinematographer William Fraker). Meanwhile, Kurt Russell worked quickly with producer James Jacks to pare down Jarre's sprawling script, deleting subplots and emphasizing the relationship between Wyatt and Doc. Russell has stated that it was he, and not Cosmatos, who actually directed the film, as Jarre's departure led to the studio's request. Russell stated that Cosmatos was brought in as a \"ghost director\" as a front man because Russell did not want it to be known that he was directing. Co-star Val Kilmer has supported Russell's statements about working heavily behind the scenes and stating that Russell \"essentially\" directed the film, but stopped short of saying that Russell did the actual directing. Cosmatos was highly focused on accurate historical detail, including the costumes, props, customs, and scenery, to give them authenticity. All the mustaches in the movie were real. Val Kilmer practiced for a long time on his quick-draw speed, and gave his character a Southern Aristocrat accent. Two locations were used to make the town of Tombstone look bigger. The scene in which Wyatt throws an abusive card dealer (Billy Bob Thornton) out of a saloon was to show that Wyatt was a man who used psychology to intimidate. Thornton's lines in the scene were ad- libbed, as he was only told to \"be a bully\". ==Music== ===Soundtrack=== The original motion picture soundtrack for Tombstone was originally released by Intrada Records on December 25, 1993. On March 16, 2006, an expanded two-disc version of the film score was also released by Intrada Records. The score was composed and produced by Bruce Broughton, and performed by the Sinfonia of London. David Snell conducted most of the score (although Broughton normally conducts his own scores, union problems mandated another conductor here), while Patricia Carlin edited the film's music. The score contains strong echoes of Max Steiner's music for John Ford's The Searchers (1956) with variations on the 'Indian Traders' theme used midway through the Ford movie. The album begins with the Cinergi logo, composed by Jerry Goldsmith and conducted by Broughton. ==Release== ===Box office=== Tombstone premiered in movie theaters six months before Costner and Kasdan's version, Wyatt Earp, on December 24, 1993, in wide release throughout the United States. During its opening weekend, the film opened in third place, grossing $6,454,752 in business showing at 1,504 locations. The film's revenue increased by 35% in its second week of release, earning $8,720,255. For that particular weekend, the film stayed in third place, screening in 1,955 theaters. The film went on to earn $56,505,065 in total ticket sales in the North American market. It ranks 20th out of all films released in 1993. ===Critical response=== Rotten Tomatoes reported that 74% of 46 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 6.26 out of 10. The site's critical consensus describes it as \"a stylish modern western with a solid story and a well-chosen ensemble cast\".Tombstone (1993). Rotten Tomatoes. IGN Entertainment.

Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert of Siskel & Ebert originally thought they would have to miss reviewing the film, as they could not get a screening, but as Ebert explained, \"... a strange thing started to happen. People started telling me they really liked Val Kilmer's performance in Tombstone, and I heard this everywhere I went. When you hear this once or twice, it's interesting, when you hear it a couple of dozen times, it's a trend. And when you read that Bill Clinton loved the performance, you figured you better catch up with the movie.\" Ultimately, Ebert recommended the movie while Siskel did not. Ebert was later to refer to Tombstone in future reviews, comparing it favorably to Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp (\"It forced the comparison upon me.\") and, in his review of Wild Bill, singling out Val Kilmer's portrayal as \"the definitive saloon cowboy of our time.\" In his review of Kurt Russell's Dark Blue, he stated, \"Every time I see Russell or Val Kilmer in a role, I'm reminded of their Tombstone, which got lost in the year-end holiday shuffle and never got the recognition it deserved.\" {|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#FFFFE0; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 20%;\" cellspacing=\"5\" |style=\"text-align: left;\"|Grafted onto this traditional framework, the film's meditative aspects are generally too self-conscious to fit comfortably.

Emanuel Levy of the Variety staff believed the film was a \"tough-talking but soft-hearted tale\" which was \"entertaining in a sprawling, old-fashioned manner.\" Regarding screenwriter Jarre's dialogue, he noted, \"Despite the lack of emotional center and narrative focus, his script contains enough subplots and colorful characters to enliven the film and ultimately make it a fun, if not totally engaging, experience.\" He also singled out Val Kilmer as the standout performance.Levy, Emanuel (December 22, 1993). Tombstone. Variety. Retrieved 2011-03-17. The film, however, was not without its detractors. James Berardinelli writing for ReelViews offered a mixed-to-negative review, recalling how he thought, \"The first half of Tombstone isn't an example of great filmmaking, but it is engaging. There's a sense of growing inevitability as events build to the shoot-out at the OK Corral. The melodramatic \"serious\" moments are kept to a minimum, and the various gunfights are choreographed with style and tension. Then, at the one-hour ten-minute mark, the Clanton gang and the Earps square off. From there, things get progressively worse. Not only is the last hour anti-climactic, but it's dull. Too many scenes feature lengthy segments of poorly-scripted dialogue, and, in some cases, character motivation becomes unclear. The gunplay is more repetitious than exciting. The result\u2014a cobbled- together morass of silly lines and shoot- outs\u2014doesn't work well.\"Berardinelli, James (December 25, 1993). Tombstone. ReelViews. Retrieved 2011-03-17. Stephen Holden writing in The New York Times saw the film as being a \"capacious Western with many modern touches, the Arizona boom town and site of the legendary O.K. Corral has a seedy, vaudevillian grandeur that makes it a direct forerunner of Las Vegas.\" He expressed his satisfaction with the supporting acting, saying, \"[the] most modern psychological touch is its depiction of Josephine (Dana Delany), the itinerant actress with whom Wyatt falls in love at first sight, as the most casually and comfortably liberated woman ever to set foot in 1880s Arizona.\" Critic Louis Black, writing for The Austin Chronicle, viewed Tombstone as a \"mess\" and that there were \"two or three pre-climaxes but no climax. Its values are capitalist rather than renegade, which is okay if it's metaphoric rather than literal. Worse, as much as these actors heroically struggle to focus the film, the director more successfully hacks it apart.\"Black, Louis (December 31, 1993). Tombstone. The Austin Chronicle. Retrieved 2011-03-17. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C\u2013 rating, calling it \"preposterously inflated\" at \"135 minutes long\". He observed the film as being a \"three-hour rough cut that's been trimmed down to a slightly shorter rough cut\" with \"all that holds the film together is Kurt Russell's droll machismo.\"Gleiberman, Owen (January 14, 1994).

Tombstone. Time Out. Retrieved 2011-03-17. Richard Harrington of The Washington Post highlighted the film's shortcomings by declaring, \"too much of Tombstone rings hollow. In retrospect, not much happens and little that does seems warranted. There are so many unrealized relationships you almost hope for redemption in a longer video version. This one is unsatisfying and unfulfilling.\"Harrington, Richard (December 25, 1993). Tombstone (R). The Washington Post. Retrieved 2011-03-17. Alternately though, columnist Bob Bloom of the Journal & Courier openly remarked that the film \"May not be historically accurate, but offers a lot of punch for the buck.\" He concluded by saying it was \"A tough, guilty-pleasure Western.\"Bloom, Bob (September 20, 2003).
