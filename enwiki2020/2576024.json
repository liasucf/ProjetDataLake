(December 11, 2006). \"In Web Traffic Tallies, Intruders Can Say You Visited Them .\" The New York Times. The company has been involved in many lawsuits regarding its trademark on the word entrepreneur, suing a wide variety of entities for using the word.Bryan Wassel (October 30, 2007). \"Entrepreneur Media Tangles again with Scott Smith--Another Chapter in a Long Relationship \". MIN online. The trademark has generally attracted criticism for being on a commonly used word for which there is no substitute, and the aggressiveness with which it is applied has been noted as somewhat ironic; Business Week asked \"why would the publisher of Entrepreneur magazine be bullying entrepreneurs?\"Barrett, P. M. (May 19, 2011). \"Entrepreneur, the magazine that sues entrepreneurs .\" Business Week. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Business magazines published in the United States Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:Mass media in Orange County, California Category:Magazines established in 1977 Category:Magazines published in California ",
