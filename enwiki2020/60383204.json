    "text": "The 1979 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade In the United States there are a number of observed holidays where employees receive paid time off. The labor force in the United States comprises about 62% (as of 2014) of the general population. In the United States, 97% of the private sector businesses determine what days this sector of the population gets paid time off, according to a study by the Society for Human Resource Management. The following holidays are observed by the majority of US businesses with paid time off: New Year's Day, New Year's Eve, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, the day after, Christmas Eve and Christmas. There are also numerous holidays on the state and local level that are observed to varying degrees. ==Holiday listing as paid time off== A barrel-shaped barbecue on a trailer at a block party in Kansas City. Pans on the top shelf hold hamburgers and hot dogs that were grilled earlier when the coals were hot. The lower grill is now being used to cook pork ribs and \"drunken chicken\" slowly, typical on a worker's paid holiday \u2013 see Barbecue in the United States. This list of holidays is based on the official list of federal holidays by year from the US Government. The holidays however are at the discretion of employers whose statistics are measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Another list from the Society for Human Resource Management shows actual percentages of employers offering paid time off for each holiday. The term \"major holiday\" (bolded) coincides for those holidays that 90% or more of employers offered paid time off. In 2020, Nike is the first company to mark Juneteenth as a paid holiday. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! Date !! *Official name !!

Festivities include counting down to 12:00 midnight on the preceding night, New Year's Eve, often with fireworks display and party.

Some cities and municipalities hold parades; and more recently, the 1994 King Holiday and Service Act, which was passed to encourage Americans to transform the King Holiday into a day of citizen action volunteer service, has gained in popularity (sometimes referred to as a National Day of Service). |- | January 20 or 21 || Inauguration Day || N/A || 0% || Celebrates the United States presidential inauguration, every 4 years. While this is a federal holiday, this is not a \"public holiday\". Only Washington, DC observes this day besides the federal government. |- | February 15\u201321 (floating Monday) || Washington's Birthday || 52%|| 34\u201335%|| Washington's Birthday was first declared a federal holiday by an 1879 act of Congress. The Uniform Holidays Act, 1968, shifted the date of the commemoration of Washington's Birthday from February 22 to the third Monday in February (between February 15 and 21, meaning the observed holiday never falls on Washington's actual birthday). Because of this, combined with the fact that President Lincoln's birthday falls on February 12, many people now refer to this holiday as \"Presidents' Day\" and consider it a day honoring all American presidents. However, neither the Uniform Holidays Act nor any subsequent law changed the name of the holiday from Washington's Birthday to Presidents' Day. |- | May 25\u201331 (floating Monday) || Memorial Day || 21%|| 95%|| Honors the nation's war dead from the Civil War onwards; marks the unofficial beginning of the summer season (traditionally May 30, shifted by the Uniform Holidays Act 1968). |- | July 4 (fixed)|| Independence Day || 79% || 97% || Celebrates the signing of the Declaration of Independence from British rule, also called the Fourth of July or simply \"The Fourth\".

In a growing number of locations this day is observed as Indigenous Peoples' Day, in honor of the Native Americans who lived in the Americas long before Columbus \"discovered\" the area. |- | November 11 (fixed)|| Veterans Day || 43% || 16\u201321%|| Honors all veterans of the United States armed forces. It is observed on November 11 to recall the end of World War I on that date in 1918 (major hostilities of World War I were formally ended at the 11th hour (GMT +1) of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918 when the Armistice with Germany went into effect). |- | November 22\u201328 (floating Thursday)|| Thanksgiving Day || 87% || 97% || Traditionally celebrates the giving of thanks for the autumn harvest.

Panama City Beach, Florida is also another destination for spring breakers. An academic year typically spans from early fall to early summer, with two or three months of summer vacation marking the end of the year. K-12 public schools generally observe local, state, and federal holidays, plus additional days off around Thanksgiving, the period from before Christmas until after New Year's Day, a spring break (usually a week in April) and sometimes a winter break (a week in February or March). Two or three days per year are sometimes devoted to professional development for teachers and students have the day off. Most colleges and universities divide the school year into two semesters. The fall semester often begins the day after Labor Day in early September and runs until mid-December. The spring semester typically starts in the middle or end of January and runs until May. Winter and summer classes might be offered in January and May\u2013August. Major federal, state, and local holidays are often observed, including the day after and usually before Thanksgiving. Spring break is usually a week in March or early April, and in elementary and secondary school and college party culture traditionally involves a warm- weather trip. Unscheduled weather-related cancellations and emergency cancellations can also affect school calendars. When taking summer school or summer camp schedules into account, the Independence Day holiday on July4 is usually a scheduled holiday observance for which the summer program closes. ==Government sector holidays: federal, state, and local government== The federal government sector labor force consisted of about 2,729,000 (as of 2014) of the total labor force of 150,539,900, which is about 2% of the total labor force or about 1% of the total population. In addition, state and local governments consist of another 19,134,000 bringing the total government sector employees to about 15% of the total labor force. This sector of the population is entitled to paid time off designated as federal holidays by Congress in Title V of the United States Code (). Both federal and state government employees generally observe the same federal holidays. ===Federally regulated agencies: banks and financial institutions=== US banks generally observe the federal holidays because of their reliance on the U.S. Federal Reserve for certain activities such as wire transfers and ACH transactions. For example, JP Morgan Chase observes all federal holidays except Columbus Day, while U.S. Bank observes all of them. The New York Stock Exchange also closely follows the federal holidays except for Columbus Day. However, the agency also has extra holidays on the day before Independence Day and Good Friday. ===Legal holidays by states and political divisions of the United States === :Not to be confused with tax holidays In general, most state governments observe the same holidays that the federal government observes. However, while that is true for most states, every state includes and omits holidays to fit the culture relevant to its population. In 2020, {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" !
