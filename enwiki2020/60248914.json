    "text": "Lychnis Mountain is a mountain summit located in Banff National Park, in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta, Canada. It is part of the Sawback Range. Its nearest higher peak is Mount St. Bride, to the north. The mountain is situated east of Tilted Mountain in an area of exposed Skoki Formation limestone which is known for fossils such as brachiopods, gastropods, conodonts, cephalopods, trilobites, and echinoderm fragments. ==History== Lychnis Mountain was named in 1911 by James F. Porter for the alpine flower Lychnis. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1956 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1969 by A.J. Kauffmann, W.L. Putnam, L. Putnam, and L.R. Wallace.. ==Geology== Like other mountains in Banff Park, Lychnis Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Lychnis Mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below \u221230 \u00b0C. ==References== ==See also== *Geography of Alberta *Geology of Alberta ==Gallery== File:Lychnis Mountain.jpg|Lychnis Mountain with Tilted Mountain down in front File:Baker Lake - Skoki Valley - Banff.jpg|Lychnis Mountain reflected in Baker Lake ==External links== * Lychnis Mountain weather forecast * Parks Canada web site: Banff National Park Category:Mountains of Alberta Category:Mountains of Banff National Park Category:Alberta's Rockies ",
