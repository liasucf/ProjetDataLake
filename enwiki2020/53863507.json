    "text": "Ren\u00e9 Malo, CQ (born 7 March 1942) is a French Canadian film producer. Born in Joliette, Quebec, Malo produced youth-oriented shows at Expo 67. He later became a member of the first crew assigned to manage Radio-Quebec. As director Denys Arcand worked on the screenplay that became the 1986 film The Decline of the American Empire for producer Roger Frappier, Frappier saw the story as promising and lobbied Malo to co-produce, for a bigger budget. Frappier and Malo raised $1.8 million, allowing for more settings to be depicted in the film. Malo and Frappier eventually won the Genie Award for Best Motion Picture for the film. Among the other 25 films Malo produced were Sonatine (1984) and The Revolving Doors (1988). He later led the Ren\u00e9 Malo Foundation, which in 2006 awarded a $500,000 grant to the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al for the establishment of the Chaire Ren\u00e9-Malo. The Chaire Ren\u00e9-Malo, led by Professor Paul Tana, was created with a mandate to guide young filmmakers. In 2013, Malo was appointed a Knight of the National Order of Quebec. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1942 births Category:Canadian film producers Category:Knights of the National Order of Quebec Category:Living people Category:People from Joliette Category:French Quebecers Category:Expo 67 ",
