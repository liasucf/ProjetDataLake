    "text": "The Mount School is a Quaker independent day and boarding school in York, England, for girls aged 2 \u201318. It was founded in 1785. ==History== The school under the name Trinity Lane (or York) Quaker Girls' School was founded by Yorkshire Quaker, Esther Tuke wife of William Tuke in 1785. This school closed in 1812. In 1831 Esther and William's grandson Samuel Tuke along with William Alexander, Thomas Backhouse and Joseph Rowntree reopened the school at Castlegate House with Hannah Brady as superintendent (1831-42. She was followed by Elizabeth Brady (1842-47), Eliza Stringer (1847-1853), and Rachel Tregelles (1853-1862). Lydia Rous returned from helping in the American Civil War to become head. During her time as Supertendinent informal singing was allowed but music and dancing lessons were not. This restriction allowed for more academic subjects and the school gave greater emphasis to algebra, geometry, Latin and logic than the average girl's school at the time. Rous retired in 1879. In 1856 it moved to its present premises, The Mount. From 1890 to 1902 the Headmistress was Lucy Harrison. ==Present day== The Mount School The current headmistress is Adrienne Richmond. The school motto is Fidelis in Parvo, meaning \"faithfulness in small things\". The school is a member of the Girls' Schools Association, the Independent Schools Council. ==Boarding== The Mount offers full boarding, weekly and Flexi boarding. Girls are able to stay for one night a week up to every night of the term. There are many boarding activities and traditions upheld by the boarding department including the Christmas 'Carols on the Stairs' and 'Tea Party with the Elderly'. ==Traditions== The Mount School has many long standing traditions throughout the school year. These range from 'Games in the Dark' at Bonfire Night, where Year 11 girls arrange a treasure hunt style challenge for the younger girls, and some older, to take part in whilst parents arrive at the school for fireworks later in the evening. College girls present three events to the school, one at the end of each term. Firstly the College I Pantomime, then the College II Talent Show and finally the Leavers' Play. The Leavers' Play is presented to the school at Leavers' Supper, usually the final Thursday of the year. The new head girls present the old head girls with flowers and College II present the school with a gift, previous years including an award in memory of a teacher and a digital photo frame to show pictures of student trips. The school holds an end of term meeting both at Christmas and in the summer. Between these meetings is Family Day. This a usually during mid May and is the main fund-raising event of the year. The school body selects two charities to support each year, one based in the UK and one overseas. The students, sometimes staff, speak about potential charities during Morning Meeting before all students vote for which to support. Family Day is an opportunity for every year to run a stall to raise money, whilst music and drama group offer entertainment. Other activity groups run stalls to raise awareness for the work of organisations such as Amnesty International and Eco- Schools Eco Committee, which in 2011 won the Green Flag award for the school. This represents the highest achievement for an eco-friendly school. The Foundation Meeting, or Speech Day, summarises the year and introduces the new head girl team. Awards and Scholarships are presented to students from every year group, including Grade 8 Music and Drama awards. Each leaver in College II writes a few sentences about their time at the Mount and their future plans, these are read out as they receive a necklace of the Mount Rose as a leaving gift. ==Academics== The Mount School has for many years been acknowledged as one of the top independent girls' schools in the United Kingdom.
