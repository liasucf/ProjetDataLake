    "text": "Canal+ was a Spanish commercial television channel launched in September 1990 on terrestrial television frequencies. The channel was operated by Telef\u00f3nica and was available on the digital satellite television and IPTV platform Movistar+. In 1997, new channels using the Canal+ brand were launched in Spain. Just as on the other markets where Canal+ was present, the channels were named after colours: Canal+ Rojo (Canal+ Red) and Canal+ Azul (Canal+ Blue). A special channel broadcasting content in 16:9 aspect ratio was launched later, but it was replaced by a time-shift channel in 2001. In 2003, the colour channels were replaced with the second channel called Canal+ 2 and three movies and sports channels. In 2005, the Spanish government agreed to a change in the license terms for the channel. The permission to change the channel from a mostly encrypted channel to a 24-hour free-to-air channel was officially given by the council of ministers on 29 July 2005. From November 2005, its analogue terrestrial frequencies were given to Sogecable's new channel named Cuatro (\"Four\"). A High-definition version of Canal+ (Canal+ HD) was on air. In 2010, it became the first Spanish channel to offer 3D TV through Canal+ 3D. On 8 July 2015, cable providers stopped carrying the channel. From 1 February 2016, it was replaced by a new channel, #0 (Cero).Telefonica to replace Canal Plus with new channel called #0.
