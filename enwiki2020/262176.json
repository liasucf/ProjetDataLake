After his early education in Tlemcen, al-Maqqari travelled to Fes in Morocco and then to Marrakech, following the court of Ahmad al-Mansur. On al-Mansur's death in 1603, al- Maqqari established himself in Fes, where he was appointed both as mufti and as the imam of the Qarawiyyin mosque by al-Mansour's successor, Zidan Abu Maali. In 1617, he left for the East, possibly following a quarrel with the local ruler, and took up residence in Cairo, where he composed his best known work, Naf\u1e25 al-\u1e6d\u012bb. In 1620 he visited Jerusalem and Damascus, and made five pilgrimages over six years. At Mecca and Medina he gave popular lectures on \u1e25ad\u012bth. In 1628 he was again in Damascus, where he continued his lectures on Muhammad al-Bukhari's collection of \u1e24ad\u012bth ('Traditions'), and spoke much of the glories of Muslim Iberia, and received the impulse to write his work on this subject later. That year he returned to Cairo and spent a year in writing his history of Spain from material he had mainly collected at the Sa'dian library in Marrakesh surviving MSS are now held in part at El Escorial, Madrid. He died in 1632 during preparations to settle in Damascus. == Works == * Rawdat al-As al-'Aatirat al-Anfaas fi Dhikar men Laqaituhu min Aa'alaam Marrakesh wa Fes () - 'The Garden of Myrtle of Aromatic Scents and the Memories of The Scholars (ulema) Whom I Met in the Two Metropolises: Marrakesh and Fes' : Al-Maqqar\u012b dedicated this to his patron Ahmad al-Mansur. *Naf\u1e25 al- \u1e6d\u012bb min Ghusni il-Andalus ar-Ratiib wa Dhikar Waziiriha Lisaan Id-Diin Ibn il- Khatteeb) () - 'The Breath of Perfume from the Branch of Flourishing Al- Andalus and Memories of its Vizier Lisan ud-Din ibn ul-Khattib': His greatest work in two-parts; i) a history of Muslim Iberia compiled from descriptions by many authors; published by William Wright, Christoph Krehl, Reinhart Dozy and Gustave Dugat as Analectes sur l'histoire et la litt\u00e9rature des Arabes d'Espagne (1855\u20131861), and in an abridged English translation by Pascual de Gayangos (1840\u20131843) titled The history of the Muhammadan dynasties in Spain.; ii) a biography of Ibn al-Khatib.
