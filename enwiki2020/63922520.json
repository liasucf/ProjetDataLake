Several rooms of the building have been converted into a museum to Vincent van Gogh, who stayed there in 1889\u20131890. ==History== The monastery was built in the 11th century. Franciscan monks established a psychiatric asylum there in 1605. ==Van Gogh== Vincent van Gogh's room in Saint-Paul de Mausole In the aftermath of the 23 December 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self-mutilation of his left ear, Vincent van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum on 8 May 1889. Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived, allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio. ==See also== * Th\u00e9ophile Peyron ==References== ;Citations ;Sources * * * Category:Monuments historiques of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne Category:Vincent van Gogh Category:Historic house museums in Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur Category:Saint- R\u00e9my-de-Provence ",
