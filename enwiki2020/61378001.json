He developed Synte 2 the first portable microprocessor-based text-to- speech synthesizer in the world. He was the head of Acoustics Laboratory at the Helsinki University of Technology from 1980 to 2006. He is speech synthesis, speech analysis, speech technology, audio signal processing and psychoacoustics pioneer in Finland. He became an associate professor 1980 and a full professor 1986. He was the supervisor of 24 doctoral theses and over 100 master's theses. His laboratory is now part of the Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics of the Aalto University. == Awards and honors == * Audio Engineering Society Fellow (1999), for significant contribution to the areas of audio signal processing and education in audio * Audio Engineering Society Silver Medal (2006), in recognition of outstanding scientific contributions to the audio industry in acoustics, auralization, and digital signal processing and synthesis * IEEE Fellow (2009) == Education == Karjalainen studied at the Tampere University of Technology, where he obtained a M.Sc. (Dipl.Eng.) in 1970, a Lic.Tech. in 1974, and a Dr.Tech.
