    "text": "Sodium hydride is the chemical compound with the empirical formula NaH. This alkali metal hydride is primarily used as a strong yet combustible base in organic synthesis. NaH is representative of the saline hydrides, meaning it is a salt-like hydride, composed of Na+ and H\u2212 ions, in contrast to the more molecular hydrides such as borane, methane, ammonia and water. It is an ionic material that is insoluble in organic solvents (although soluble in molten Na), consistent with the fact that H\u2212 remains an unknown anion in solution. Because of the insolubility of NaH, all reactions involving NaH occur at the surface of the solid. ==Basic properties and structure== NaH is produced by the direct reaction of hydrogen and liquid sodium.Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. \"Inorganic Chemistry\" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. . Pure NaH is colorless, although samples generally appear grey. NaH is ca. 40% denser than Na (0.968 g/cm3). NaH, like LiH, KH, RbH, and CsH, adopts the NaCl crystal structure. In this motif, each Na+ ion is surrounded by six H\u2212 centers in an octahedral geometry. The ionic radii of H\u2212 (146 pm in NaH) and F\u2212 (133 pm) are comparable, as judged by the Na\u2212H and Na\u2212F distances.Wells, A.F. (1984). Structural Inorganic Chemistry, Oxford: Clarendon Press === \"Inverse sodium hydride\" === A very unusual situation occurs in a compound dubbed \"inverse sodium hydride\", which contains Na\u2212 and H+ ions. Na\u2212 is an alkalide, and this compound differs from ordinary sodium hydride in having a much higher energy content due to the net displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium. A derivative of this \"inverse sodium hydride\" arises in the presence of the base adamanzane. This molecule irreversibly encapsulates the H+ and shields it from interaction with the alkalide Na\u2212. Theoretical work has suggested that even an unprotected protonated tertiary amine complexed with the sodium alkalide might be metastable under certain solvent conditions, though the barrier to reaction would be small and finding a suitable solvent might be difficult. ==Applications in organic synthesis== ===As a strong base=== NaH is a base of wide scope and utility in organic chemistry.Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis (Ed: L. Paquette) 2004, J. Wiley & Sons, New York. . As a superbase, it is capable of deprotonating a range of even weak Br\u00f8nsted acids to give the corresponding sodium derivatives. Typical \"easy\" substrates contain O-H, N-H, S-H bonds, including alcohols, phenols, pyrazoles, and thiols. NaH notably deprotonates carbon acids (i.e., C-H bonds) such as 1,3-dicarbonyls such as malonic esters. The resulting sodium derivatives can be alkylated. NaH is widely used to promote condensation reactions of carbonyl compounds via the Dieckmann condensation, Stobbe condensation, Darzens condensation, and Claisen condensation. Other carbon acids susceptible to deprotonation by NaH include sulfonium salts and DMSO. NaH is used to make sulfur ylides, which in turn are used to convert ketones into epoxides, as in the Johnson\u2013Corey\u2013Chaykovsky reaction. ===As a reducing agent=== NaH reduces certain main group compounds, but analogous reactivity is very rare in organic chemistry (see below). Notably boron trifluoride reacts to give diborane and sodium fluoride: :6 NaH + 2 BF3 \u2192 B2H6 \\+ 6 NaF Si-Si and S-S bonds in disilanes and disulfides are also reduced. A series of reduction reactions, including the hydrodecyanation of tertiary nitriles, reduction of imines to amines, and amides to aldehydes, can be effected by a composite reagent composed of sodium hydride and an alkali metal iodide (NaH:MI, M = Li, Na). ===Hydrogen storage=== Although not commercially significant sodium hydride has been proposed for hydrogen storage for use in fuel cell vehicles. In one experimental implementation, plastic pellets containing NaH are crushed in the presence of water to release the hydrogen. One challenge with this technology is the regeneration of NaH from the NaOH. ==Practical considerations== Sodium hydride is sold as a mixture of 60% sodium hydride (w/w) in mineral oil. Such a dispersion is safer to handle and weigh than pure NaH. The compound is often used in this form but the pure grey solid can be prepared by rinsing the commercial product with pentane or THF, with care being taken because the waste solvent will contain traces of NaH and can ignite in air. Reactions involving NaH require air-free techniques. Typically NaH is used as a suspension in THF, a solvent that resists attack by strong bases but can solvate many reactive sodium compounds. ==Safety== NaH can ignite in air, especially upon contact with water to release hydrogen, which is also flammable. Hydrolysis converts NaH into sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a caustic base. In practice, most sodium hydride is dispensed as a dispersion in oil, which can be safely handled in air. ==References== ==Cited sources== * Category:Metal hydrides Category:Sodium compounds Category:Reagents for organic chemistry Category:Bases (chemistry) Category:Group I semiconductors ",
