    "text": "The Philidor Defence is a chess opening characterised by the moves: :1. e4 e5 :2. Nf3 d6 The opening is named after the famous 18th-century player Fran\u00e7ois- Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor, who advocated it as an alternative to the common 2...Nc6. His original idea was to challenge White's centre by the pawn thrust ...f7\u2013f5. Today, the Philidor is known as a solid but passive choice for Black, and is seldom seen in top-level play except as an alternative to the heavily analysed openings that can ensue after the normal 2...Nc6. It is considered a good opening for amateur players who seek a defensive strategy that is simpler and easier to understand than the complex positions that result from an opening such as the French Defence. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings code for Philidor Defence is C41. ==Use== The Philidor occurred in one of the most famous games ever played, \"The Opera Game\" played in 1858 between the American chess master Paul Morphy and two strong amateurs, the German noble Duke Karl of Brunswick and the French aristocrat Count Isouard. The game continued 3.d4 Bg4, a deviation from modern standard lines. The Philidor Defence declined in popularity as became more developed, and it had almost completely vanished from top-tier chess by World War I. , there are no top players who employ the Philidor with any regularity, although \u00c9tienne Bacrot and Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu have occasionally experimented with it. Its popularity in master play has increased slightly over the last 20 years, however.The Philidor at Chessgames.com ==Main line: 3.d4 == With 3.d4 White immediately challenges Black in the . Black has several options. ===3...exd4=== The most common Black response is 3...exd4 which relieves the central tension, although it gives up the centre. After 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3, Black normally continues ...Be7 and ...0-0 (the Antoshin Variation) and achieves a strong defensive position. A sample line is: 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 Be7 6. Bc4 0-0 7. 0-0 c5, and the position is equal. In this line Black can also fianchetto his bishop to g7, although this is uncommon. Bent Larsen tried this in a few games, including a draw against Mikhail Tal in 1969. Instead of 4. Nxd4, White can play 4. Qxd4, as Paul Morphy favoured, intending 4... Nc6 5. Bb5 Bd7 6. Bxc6 Bxc6 7. Nc3 Nf6 8. Bg5 followed by 0-0-0. This line was played in many 19th-century games. ===Hanham Variation=== The other main option for Black is to maintain the central tension and adopt a setup with ...Nd7, ...Be7, and ...c6. This plan is named the Hanham Variation' (after the American chess master James Moore Hanham) and was favoured by Aron Nimzowitsch. A common line is: 3... Nf6 4. Nc3 Nbd7 5. Bc4 Be7 6. 0-0 (6.Ng5 is an interesting alternative: after 6...0-0 7.Bxf7+ Rxf7 8.Ne6 Qe8 9.Nxc7 Qd8 10.Nxa8, White is up, but Black can develop a strong initiative after, for example, 10...b5 11.Nxb5 Qa5+) 6... 0-0 7. a4 (to prevent ...b5) ' (see diagram). Grandmaster Larry Kaufman notes that the Hanham Variation aims to maintain Black's pawn on e5, analogously to closed lines of the Ruy Lopez, and opines that \"it would be quite popular and on a par with the major defences to 1.e4, except for the annoying detail that Black can't actually reach the Hanham position by force.\"Kaufman 2004, p. 65. As an alternative to 4.Nc3 in response to Black's 3...Nf6, according to both Kaufman and Grandmaster Christian Bauer, White retains some advantage with: 4. dxe5! Nxe4 5. Qd5! (the Rellstab Variation;Hooper & Whyld 1996, p. 334. Rellstab Variation. 5.Nbd2 is the Sokolsky VariationHooper & Whyld 1996, p. 378. Sokolsky Variation.) 5... Nc5 6. Bg5 Be7 Qxd6 8. Nc3.Kaufman 2004, p. 69.Bauer 2006, p. 32. ====Alternative move order==== Black sometimes tries 3... Nd7 intending 4.Nc3 Ngf6, reaching the Hanham Variation. But then 4. Bc4! is awkward for Black to meet, since 4...Ngf6 loses to 5.Ng5, and 4...Be7 loses a pawn to 5.dxe5 Nxe5 (5...dxe5 6.Qd5! wins) 6.Nxe5 dxe5 7.Qh5!Bauer 2006, p. 16. So 4... c6 is best for Black, but leaves White with the advantage of the bishop pair after 5. 0-0 Be7 6. dxe5 dxe5 (6...Nxe5 loses a pawn to 7.Nxe5 dxe5 8.Qh5) 7. Ng5! Bxg5 8. Qh5! Qe7 and now 9.Bxg5 or 9.Qxg5.Bauer 2006, pp. 17\u201322. ====Black experiments to reach the Hanham Variation==== In recent years, Black has experimented with other move orders in an attempt to reach the Hanham Variation while avoiding 3...Nf6 4.dxe5! and 3...Nd7 4.Bc4! * One such line is 1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 Nbd7 intending 4.Nf3 e5. White can deviate, however, with 4.f4!?Bauer 2006, p. 179.Kaufman 2004, p. 199. or even 4.g4!?Bauer 2006, pp. 197\u2013206. * Another try is 1. e4 d6 2. d4 Nf6 3. Nc3 e5 which transposes to the Hanham after 4.Nf3 Nbd7, but White can instead try to gain a small advantage with 4. dxe5 (Kaufman opines that 4.Nge2 is \"also promising\") 4... dxe5 5. Qxd8+ Kxd8 6. Bc4. After 4.dxe5, Bauer concludes that \"White stands a trifle better\" but that \"provided he plays accurately, Black doesn't have much to fear following 6.Bc4, by choosing any of the three valid replies, 6...Ke8, 6...Bb4, or 6...Be6. Then 7.Bxe6 fxe6 his position remains a hard nut to crack.\"Bauer 2006, p. 174. ===Philidor Countergambit: 3...f5 === A more aggressive approach for Black after 3.d4 is 3...f5 (see diagram), Philidor's original intention and recommendation. In the 19th century, 3...f5 was also played by Paul Morphy. The move can lead to more than the other lines, but is often considered dubious.Kaufman 2004, p. 22.Bauer 2006, pp. 22\u201332. Others maintain that 3...f5 is a valid idea. Grandmaster Tony Kosten considers the move respectable in his monograph on the opening.Tony Kosten, Winning with the Philidor, Batsford Chess, 1992. The move was also played by David Bronstein and by Teimour Radjabov. After 3...f5 White has several ways to proceed: * 4. Nc3 (the Zukertort VariationHooper & Whyld 1996, p. 460. Zukertort Variation.) and White obtains a clear advantage: ** 4...fxe4 5.Nxe4 d5 (if 5...Nf6 6.Nxf6 gxf6 7.dxe5 fxe5 8.Bc4 Qf6 9.Ng5 PolugaevskyMatanovi\u0107 1981 (Vol C), p. 196, n. 21.) 6.Nxe5 dxe4 7.Qh5+ g6 8.Nxg6 Nf6 (if 8...hxg6 9.Qxh8 Be6 10.Qe5 +/\u2212 Larsen) 9.Qe5+ Kf7 (if 9...Be7 10.Nxh8 Nc6 11.Bb5 Qd5 12.Bg5 +/\u2212 ZukertortMatanovi\u0107 1981 (Vol C), p. 197, n. 24.) 10.Bc4+ Kg7 11.Bh6+ Kxh6 12.Nxh8 Bb4+ 13.c3 Qxh8 14.cxb4 +/\u2212 (Keres).Matanovi\u0107 1997 (Vol C), p. 214, n. 6. ** 4...exd4 5.Qxd4 fxe4 (if 5...Nf6 6.e5!) 6.Bg5 Nf6 7.Nxe4 Be7 8.Bc4 Nc6 9.Qe3 +/\u2212 (Sozin).Matanovi\u0107 1997 (Vol C), p. 214, n. 3. ** 4...Nf6 5.dxe5 Nxe4 6.Nxe4 fxe4 7.Ng5 d5 8.e6 Bc5 9.Nxe4! +/\u2212 (Sozin, Sokolsky). * 4.

Bc4 giving White the advantage of the in an open position as well as a large advantage.

Bc4 is an alternative approach for White, delaying d2\u2013d4, or forgoing it entirely, playing d2\u2013d3 instead. The move 3.Bc4 is also White's route to a possible L\u00e9gal Trap.
