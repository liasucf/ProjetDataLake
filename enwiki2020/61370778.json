    "text": "Giotto di Bondone, Legend of St Joachim, Meeting at the Golden Gate, 1305, in the Scrovegni Chapel, is an early Western depiction of the scene. Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate is a narrative of the parents of the Virgin Mary, Joachim and Anne meeting at the Golden Gate of Jerusalem, upon learning that she will bear a child. It is not in the New Testament, but is in the Protoevangelium of James and other apocryphal accounts; however it was tolerated by the Church. It featured in Voragine's Golden Legend (c.1260) and other popular accounts. The story was a popular subject in cycles of the Life of the Virgin in art. ==Story== Benedictus Chelidonius' work describes the story of the married couple Joachim and Anne, who, though they were devoted to each other, were deeply unhappy as they were childless, which they took as a sign that they must have been rejected by God. An angel informs Anne of her conception, while at the same time asking her to meet her husband at the city gate in Jerusalem. On meeting, the couple entwine in joy. According to Chelidonius: \"Overjoyed Anne threw herself into the arms of her husband; together they rejoiced about the honour that was to be granted them in the form of a child. For they knew from the heavenly messenger that the child would be a Queen, powerful on heaven and on earth\".Nurnberg (1983), Ilus. 59. In traditional depictions of the occasion, the pair embrace, but don't kiss.Lubbock, Tom. \"The Meeting at the Golden Gate (1305)\". The Independent (UK), 16 February 2007. Retrieved on 14 October 2007. ==Theological implications== The church had developed the doctrine that the Virgin Mary was, uniquely, conceived without original sin; this is known as the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception (which refers to the conception of Mary, not that of Jesus). In the Middle Ages the doctrine remained controversial, opposed by St Thomas Aquinas and his Dominican Order, but supported by Duns Scotus and his Franciscan Order. It was formally established as dogma in 1854, by Pope Pius IX.Hall, 326 This scene represented the conception of Mary, and was an early scene in the many cycles of the Life of the Virgin, the counterpart of the Annunciation showing the conception of Jesus. To some medieval viewers, the kiss was a literal representation of the moment of Mary's conception, while for others it was a symbolic representation. The main figures may be accompanied, usually Anne with women and Joachim with shepherds. The Archangel Gabriel, always shown in Annunciations, may appear here also.Hall, 170-171 Sometimes other saints are included. The 14th and 15th centuries were the heyday of depictions. Gradually more allegorical depictions of the Immaculate Conception, featuring an adult Mary, replaced this scene in representing the doctrine.Hall, 171 File:Znamenie oborot.jpg|Russian icon, perhaps before 1169 File:Master of the Golden Gate - The Meeting of Anna and Joachim at the Golden Gate - Google Art Project.jpg|Master of the Golden Gate, late 14th century Accademia - Incontro di Gioacchino e Anna con san Luigi IX e santa Libera - Carpaccio.jpg|Carpaccio, with Saint Louis IX and Saint Liberata.
