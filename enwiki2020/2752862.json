It was located at in the city of Butare and was established in 1963 by the government in cooperation with the Congregation of the Dominicans from the Province of Quebec, Canada. Its founder and first rector was Father Georges- Henri L\u00e9vesque. In 2013, along with all public higher education institutions in Rwanda, it was merged into the newly created University of Rwanda. When it was established, the NUR had three divisions (Faculties of Medicine and Social Sciences, and a Teacher Training College), 51 students and 16 lecturers. The university suffered badly during the genocide and had to close in 1994, reopening in April 1995. At that time English was introduced as a medium of instruction alongside French. As of 2005 it focused on Science and Technology and Humanities, with French and English as the medium of instruction. ==History== When it started in 1963 NUR was composed of three academic units: the Faculty of Medicine, the Faculty of Social Sciences and the Teacher Training College (ENS). At that time, it had 51 students and 16 lecturers. By 2005, the university had 8221 students and 425 lecturers.

They were victims of their ideology or ethnic identity. The University suffered a great loss: laboratory equipment, the computer equipment and academic infrastructure were destroyed or taken away. NUR was closed because of the prevailing war in the country, those who were not killed had to hide themselves, and others fled in exile. *January 1995: The campus of Ruhengeri and the Kigali Faculty of Law shifted and become part of the campus of Butare. *April 1995: Reopening of NUR.
