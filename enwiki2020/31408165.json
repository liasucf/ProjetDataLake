    "text": "The North Queen Anne Drive Bridge is a deck arch bridge that spans Seattle's Wolf Creek. The long steel and concrete structure was built in 1936 to replace the previous wood-constructed crossing. It serves as a connection between the Queen Anne neighborhood and the George Washington Memorial Bridge that carries State Route 99. The arch is unusually high and uses a minimal amount of supporting members. It was designated a city landmark on December 28, 1981, because of its unique engineering style. An expansion joint suffered cracking and spalling during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake. The bridge has been retrofitted to make it more earthquake-resistant. ==References== Category:Bridges in Seattle Category:Bridges completed in 1936 Category:Landmarks in Seattle Category:Road bridges in Washington (state) Category:Queen Anne, Seattle Category:1936 establishments in Washington (state) Category:Steel bridges in the United States ",
