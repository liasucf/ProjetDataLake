It is the 27th countdown of the most popular songs of the year, as chosen by listeners of Australian radio station Triple J. A record-breaking number of votes (3.21 million) were cast by listeners choosing their top ten songs of 2019. This was the first Hottest 100 countdown to reach 3 million votes. American singer- songwriter Billie Eilish was voted into first place with her single \"Bad Guy\". In doing so, she became the first female solo artist, and the youngest act (at 18 years old) to top a Hottest 100. Eilish also achieved the most entries in the countdown, at five. Australian artists G Flip and Lime Cordiale achieved four entires each. A number of Hottest 100 records were also broken. Denzel Curry's cover of \"Bulls on Parade\" became the highest ranking Like a Version in any Hottest 100. Slipknot's single \"Unsainted\" broke the record for the longest absence between countdowns, having last appeared 19 years prior with \"Wait and Bleed\" in the 2000 countdown. ==Background== Triple J's Hottest 100 allows members of the public to vote online for their top ten songs of the year, which are then used to calculate the year's 100 most popular songs. Any song initially released between 1 December 2018 and 30 November 2019 will be eligible for 2019's Hottest 100. Voting opened on 16 December 2019. Many artists and presenters made their votes public\u2014out of 23 Triple J presenters, the artists they voted for most often were Julia Jacklin, Sampa the Great, and Thelma Plum. ===Projections=== Prior to the countdown, three favourites had emerged by a significant margin. Bookmaker Beteasy and social media analysis project 100 Warm Tunas placed \"Dance Monkey\" by Australian musician Tones and I, \"Bad Guy\" by American singer-songwriter Billie Eilish, and American rapper Denzel Curry's cover of \"Bulls on Parade\" for Like a Version as the three songs most likely to take out first place. == Full list == {| | style=\"width: 15px; height: 15px; color: black; background: #ccffcc; border: 1px solid #000000;\" | |Note: Australian artists |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:0.95em;line-height:1.5em;\" !# !Song !Artist !Country of origin |- | 1 || Bad Guy || Billie Eilish || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 2 || Rushing Back || Flume featuring Vera Blue || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 3 || Charlie || Mallrat || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 4 || Dance Monkey || Tones and I || |- | 5 || Bulls on Parade (Like a Version) || Denzel Curry || |- style=\"background- color: #ccffcc\" | 6 || Drink Too Much || G Flip || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 7 || Robbery || Lime Cordiale || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 8 || Heavy Hearted || The Jungle Giants || |- style=\"background- color: #ccffcc\" | 9 || Better in Blak || Thelma Plum || |- style=\"background- color: #ccffcc\" | 10 || Exit Sign || Hilltop Hoods featuring Illy and Ecca Vandal || |- | 11 || Circles || Post Malone || |- | 12 || By Myself || Fidlar || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 13 || Inappropriate Behaviour || Lime Cordiale || |- | 14 || Purple Hat || Sofi Tukker || / |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 15 || Never Seen the Rain || Tones and I || |- | 16 || Everything I Wanted || Billie Eilish || |- style=\"background- color: #ccffcc\" | 17 || I Touch Myself (Like a Version) || Lime Cordiale || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 18 || Borderline || Tame Impala || |- | 19 || Glitter || Benee || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 20 || Silver || DMA's || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 21 || Pub Feed || The Chats || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 22 || Painkiller || Ruel || |- | 23 || Earfquake || Tyler, the Creator || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 24 || Infinity || Ocean Alley || |- | 25 || Find an Island || Benee || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 26 || Johnny Run Away || Tones and I || |- | 27 || Vossi Bop || Stormzy || |- | 28 || Juice || Lizzo || |- | 29 || Piece of Your Heart || Meduza featuring Goodboys || / |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 30 || Friends || Flume featuring Reo Cragun || / |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 31 || Save It for the Weekend || Skegss || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 32 || Money || Lime Cordiale || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 33 || San Frandisco || Dom Dolla || |- | 34 || Tokyo Drifting || Glass Animals featuring Denzel Curry || / |- | 35 || Bury a Friend || Billie Eilish || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 36 || Solid Gold || Pnau featuring Kira Divine and Marques Toliver || / |- | 37 || Red Light Green Light || Duke Dumont featuring Shaun Ross || / |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 38 || Face to Face || Ruel || |- | 39 || Longshot || Catfish and the Bottlemen || |- | 40 || Graveyard || Halsey || |- | 41 || Highest in the Room || Travis Scott || |- | 42 || Robbery || Juice Wrld || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 43 || It Might Be Time || Tame Impala || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcd\" | 44 || Cool as Hell || Baker Boy || |- | 45 || Ricky || Denzel Curry || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 46 || 7 Minutes || Dean Lewis || |- | 47 || Sugar || Brockhampton || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 48 || Intentions (22) || Ziggy Alberts || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 49 || Free Time || Ruel || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 50 || Teach Me About Dying || Holy Holy || |- | 51 || Evil Spider || Benee || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 52 || Patience || Tame Impala || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 53 || You Little Beauty || Fisher || |- style=\"background-color: #ccffcc\" | 54 || Stained Glass || Ocean Alley || |- | 55 || Talk || Khalid featuring Disclosure || / |- | 56 || Middle Child || J.
