GPS uses compilers from the GNU Compiler Collection, taking its name from GNAT, the GNU compiler for the Ada programming language. GPS is cross- platform, running on Linux, FreeBSD, Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Solaris. GPS uses GTK+ as the widget toolkit for its graphical user interface. Released under the GNU General Public License, GPS is free software. ==Features== GPS supports a variety of programming languages other than Ada, including C, JavaScript, Pascal and Python.
