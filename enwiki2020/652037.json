    "text": "The Wind River is the name applied to the upper reaches of the Bighorn River in Wyoming in the United States. The Wind River is long. The two rivers are sometimes referred to as the Wind/Bighorn. ==Course== Wind River as part of the Boysen Reservoir near Thermopolis, Wyoming Its headwaters are at Wind River Lake in the Rocky Mountains, near the summit of Togwotee Pass (pronounced toe-go-tee) and gathers water from several forks along the northeast side of the Wind River Range in west central Wyoming. It flows southeastward, across the Wind River Basin and the Wind River Indian Reservation and joins the Little Wind River near Riverton. Up stream from this confluence, it is known locally as the Big Wind River. It flows northward, through a gap in the Owl Creek Mountains, where the name of the river becomes the Bighorn River. In the Owl Creek Mountains, it is dammed to form Boysen Reservoir. The Wind River officially becomes the Bighorn River at the Wedding of the Waters, on the north side of the Wind River Canyon. ==See also== *List of rivers of Wyoming *List of tributaries of the Missouri River ==References== ==External links== *Wyoming State Water Plan: Wind/Bighorn Rivers *U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: Wind/Bighorn River Drainage *Wind River History *Wind River Info * Category:Rivers of Wyoming Category:Tributaries of the Yellowstone River Category:Rivers of Teton County, Wyoming Category:Bodies of water of Hot Springs County, Wyoming ",
