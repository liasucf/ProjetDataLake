Self-described by the genre \"edu-core\", the group played short songs with lyrics consisting of biographical and bibliographical information, observations, and abstractions of science fiction, fantasy, and seminal horror authors. ==History== Bl\u00f6\u00f6dHag was formed in 1996 as a 2-piece, 4-track recording project with Dr. J.M. McNulty on guitar and Professor Jake Stratton singing but soon added Sir Zachary Orgel on bass and a drum machine dubbed \"Philthy 'The Drum Machine' Taylor\". After playing local Seattle clubs for 2 years, Bl\u00f6\u00f6dHag added live drummer Rodd Karp who was subsequently replaced by Ambassador Brent Carpenter. Bl\u00f6\u00f6dHag was accredited by the King County Library System as fitting the criteria for a literacy program. Bl\u00f6\u00f6dHag has embarked on several tours of libraries in the Pacific Northwest, as well as playing in traditional music venues. Bl\u00f6\u00f6dHag has since toured libraries all around the country including Chicago, Boston, New York City (Queens), Athens, Austin, Oklahoma City, Las Vegas, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Oakland, and New Orleans. The band played at the 2004 Nebula Awards in Seattle, Washington. In 2006, the band was signed to the Alternative Tentacles label who released their full- length CD and record entitled Hell Bent For Letters. Members of the band have subsequently had some of their short fiction published in the compendium, Mecca|Mettle, a collaboration with Thomas M. Disch and Hugo-winning artist Tim Kirk. Mecca|Mettle is published by Payseur & Schmidt. From 2009-2010, Bl\u00f6\u00f6dHag stopped touring and slowed their schedule of live performances. Their last show was held on April 9, 2010, at the Seattle club, The Funhouse, alongside the groups Captured! by Robots from San Francisco and Stovokor from Portland. ==Media== The documentary, Bl\u00f6\u00f6dHag: The Faster You Go Deaf\u2026The More Time You Have To Read, premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival in 2001.
