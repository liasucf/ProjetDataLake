    "text": "El jard\u00edn de los presentes (pronounced ); Spanish for \"the garden of the present ones\" or \"the garden of presents\") is the third and final album by the Argentine rock band Invisible, released on 29 September 1976 on CBS Records. The recording sessions and release of the album took place during a grim moment in Argentine history: a coup d'\u00e9tat in March 1976 installed a military dictatorship known as the National Reorganization Process in the country, inaugurating an era of state terrorism. Invisible, which would disband in 1977, was one of the bands headed by musician Luis Alberto Spinetta. El jard\u00edn de los presentes marked a stylistic change in the band's sound, incorporating elements of jazz and tango. This shift is associated with the musical trends in Buenos Aires at that time, with musicians such as Astor Piazzolla, Dino Saluzzi, Jorge Pinchevsky and Daniel Binelli expanding the notions of the genre in their compositions, and rock musicians like Sui Generis and Litto Nebbia experimenting with tango sounds. The inclusion of the 18-year-old guitarist Tom\u00e1s Gubitsch, trained in jazz music, was also vital in this artistic progression; however, it created tensions in the group, causing their eventual separation.Berti, 1988, p. 55 The album also features bandoneonists Rodolfo Mederos and Juan Jos\u00e9 Mosalini, and composer Gustavo Moretto. The album was presented with two multitudinous concerts at the Estadio Luna Park in August and September 1976, with an amount of attendants unusual at that time, indicating a peak in commercial success for the bandBerti, 1988, p. 54 El jard\u00edn de los presentes is considered one of the highest creative apexes in Spinetta's career. In 2007, the Argentine edition of Rolling Stone ranked it 28 on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Albums of National Rock\". The song \"Ruido de magia\" is prominently sampled in \"Dis Generation\" by A Tribe Called Quest, off their final album We Got It from Here...
