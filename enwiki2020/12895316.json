    "text": "Jason Couch (born November 8, 1969) is a ten-pin bowler on the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour, and a member of the PBA and USBC Halls of Fame. A left-handed cranker, he currently resides in Clermont, Florida. ==PBA career== Since joining the PBA Tour in 1991, Couch has racked up 16 titles, including four major championships. Jason's first title came at the 1993 Tums Classic, defeating Brian Voss in the final match. Later that year he won his first major title at the 1993 Touring Players Championship. He then pulled off an historic \"three-peat\" in the Tournament of Champions, winning consecutive events in 1999, 2000 and 2002. (The event was not contested in 2001 because the PBA switched from a calendar year to a fall-spring seasonal format.) Couch is currently 10th on the PBA's all-time money list with over $1.7 million in career earnings. He had season-ending knee surgery in 2007 and had to defer his 2007\u201308 exemption to 2008\u201309. He was ranked #24 on the PBA's 2008\u20132009 list of \"50 Greatest Players of the Last 50 Years.\" Through the end of the 2010\u201311 season, Jason had recorded 41 perfect 300 games in PBA events. In February, 2012, he was elected to the PBA Hall of Fame. Also in 2012, Couch announced his retirement from full-time competitive bowling on the PBA Tour, although he will continue to have a role on the tour as a ball representative for Ebonite. Couch graduated from Clermont High School in Clermont, Florida. ==Awards and recognition== * 1992 PBA Rookie of the Year * Won at least one PBA title in six straight seasons (1998 through 2003-04) * One of only three three-time winners in the Tournament of Champions.
