    "text": "III is the third studio album by American indie folk band The Lumineers. The album was released on September 13, 2019. ==Composition== As well as being the Lumineers' third album, the album title also references that the album is presented in three chapters, each focusing on a different main character of the fictional Sparks family. Lumineers co-founder Jeremiah Fraites said \"This collection of songs worked out in a beautiful way, and I feel with this album we've really hit our stride.\" In an interview with NPR, Fraites and Schultz both explained how their lives have been impacted by addiction, and that this album was intended to chronicle the effects of addiction on family members and loved ones. \"Schultz says he had a childhood friend in New Jersey who slowly came apart as a teenager because of drug addiction. Both band members experienced this because Schultz's friend, Josh Fraites, was the brother of his future bandmate, Jeremiah.\" As of September 19, 2019, the Lumineers have released 10 music videos from the first 10 tracks of the album, chronicling the main characters and their journey living alongside addiction. ==Commercial performance== III debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 with 86,000 album-equivalent units, including 73,000 pure album sales. It is the Lumineers' third top-two album in the US. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Studio musicians * Wesley Schultz \u2212 vocals, guitar * Jeremiah Fraites \u2212 piano, drums, tambourine, guitar, backing vocals, synths, vibraphone, cymbal scrapes * Byron Isaacs \u2212 bass, backing vocals * Lauren Jacobson \u2212 violin, backing vocals * Simone Felice \u2212 maraca, backing vocals * David Baron \u2212 synths, keyboards, harmonium * Anneke Schaul-Yoder \u2212 cello ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 23 |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| French Albums (SNEP) | 122 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italian Albums (FIMI) | 63 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Lithuanian Albums (AGATA) | 44 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) | 38 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 2 |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Folk Albums (Billboard) | 17 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Rock Albums (Billboard) | 46 |} ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:The Lumineers albums Category:Dualtone Records albums ",
