Football Federation Australia hoped to build on the success of the previous two seasons and on the interest generated by Sydney FC and Adelaide United playing in the 2007 AFC Champions League, and the Socceroos competing in the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. Based on their A-League 2006-07 season performances Adelaide United and Melbourne Victory competed in the 2008 AFC Champions League, making it two consecutive seasons in the competition for Adelaide United. Based on the 2007\u201308 season of the A-League, the Central Coast Mariners and Newcastle Jets qualified for the 2009 AFC Champions League, as the competition's Premiers and Champions respectively. Changes included: *The New Zealand Knights, who folded at the conclusion of the 2006\u201307 season, were replaced by Wellington Phoenix. *An increase of the squad size, from 20 to 23 players, increasing the salary cap from A$1.6 million to A$1.8 million. == Clubs == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
