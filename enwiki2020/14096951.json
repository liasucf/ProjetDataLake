She was the second Canadian naval unit to bear this name. Following the vessel's decommissioning, the ship was used as a source for spare parts for the other surviving members of her class. In 1991, Chaudi\u00e8re was sold for use as an artificial reef and sunk off the coast of British Columbia. ==Design and description== Based on the preceding design, the Restigouches had the same hull and propulsion, but different weaponry.Gardiner and Chumbley, p. 45 Initially the St. Laurent class had been planned to be 14 ships. However the order was halved, and the following seven were redesigned to take into improvements made on the St. Laurents. As time passed, their design diverged further from that of the St. Laurents.Milner, p. 248 The ships had a displacement of , at deep load. They were designed to be long with a beam of and a draught of . The Restigouches had a complement of 214.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 251 The Restigouches were by powered by two English Electric geared steam turbines, each driving a propellor shaft, using steam provided by two Babcock & Wilcox boilers. They generated giving the vessels a maximum speed of . The Restigouches were equipped with SPS-10, SPS-12, Sperry Mk 2 and SPG-48 radar along with SQS-501 and SQS-503 sonar.Gardiner and Chumbly, p. 46 ===Armament=== The Restigouches diverged from the St. Laurents in their weaponry. The Restigouches were equipped with two twin mounts of Vickers /70 calibre Mk 6 dual-purpose guns forward and maintained a single twin mount of 3-inch/50 calibre Mk 22 guns aft used in the preceding class.Calibre denotes the length of the barrel. In this case, 50 calibre means that the gun barrel is 50 times as long as it is in diameter A Mk 69 fire control director was added to control the new guns.Boutiller, p. 323 They were also armed with two Limbo Mk 10 mortars and two single Bofors 40 mm guns. However the 40 mm guns were dropped in the final design. The destroyers were also equipped beginning in 1958 with Mk 43 homing torpedoes in an effort to increase the distance between the ships and their targets. The Mk 43 torpedo had a range of at . They were pitched over the side by a modified depth charge thrower.Milner, p. 225 ==Service history== Chaudi\u00e8re was laid down on 30 July 1953 by Halifax Shipyards at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Named for a river in Quebec, she was the last of her class. The ship was launched on 13 November 1957. While under construction the escort suffered a fire which caused $200,000 in damage in September 1958. On 4 October 1958, a visiting engineer died after falling.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 38 The ship commissioned on 14 November 1959 at Halifax with the classification DDE 235. Prime Minister John Diefenbaker was a guest of honour at the ceremony. Upon commissioning, the ship was assigned to the Fifth Canadian Escort Squadron. In March 1961, the destroyer escort was among the ships that took part in a combined naval exercise with the United States Navy off Nova Scotia. Chaudi\u00e8re underwent shock testing off Florida in 1962. In February 1964, the ship took part in the NATO naval exercise \"Magic Lantern\" off Gibraltar. Following the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces, and the change from the Royal Canadian Navy to Maritime Command, Chaudi\u00e8re was transferred to the west coast to join the Second Canadian Escort Squadron. On 2 October 1967, she left Halifax to travel to Esquimalt. Initially all seven Restigouche-class ships were intended to be upgraded to the IRE refit, however due to financial reasons, Chaudi\u00e8res conversion was cut and by 1970, the ship was reduced to a training ship.Milner, p. 265 On 23 May 1974, Chaudi\u00e8re was paid off and used as a source for parts for the other members of the class. In 1989, Chaudi\u00e8res sister ship collided with a merchant vessel and her bow was severely damaged. To repair the damage, Kootenays damaged bow was removed and Chaudi\u00e8res was installed in place. In September 1991, the Canadian government sold the former destroyer escort to the Artificial Reef Society of British Columbia for $1 for use as an artificial reef.Orrick, p. 49 The project to use the ship was saved mainly by donations from the community after government funding was cut.Orrick, pp. 50\u201351 The ship was sunk in Sechelt Inlet, British Columbia on 5 December 1992. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * * * * * ==External links== *Canadian Navy of Yesterday & Today: Restigouche- class destroyer escort Category:Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Restigouche-class destroyers Category:Shipwrecks of the British Columbia coast Category:1957 ships Category:Ships built in Nova Scotia Category:Cold War destroyers of Canada ",
