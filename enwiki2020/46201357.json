This canon replaced the traditional understanding of marriage: a covenant between a man and a woman. That marriage is reserved for a man and a woman is the understanding of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer.http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/marriage.pdf ==References== Category:1940 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America Category:Place of birth missing Category:Canadian expatriates in the United States ",
