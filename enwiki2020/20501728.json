    "text": "Grave of Maja Berezowska Maja Berezowska (13 April 1893 or 1898, in Baranowicze \u2013 31 May 1978, in Warsaw) was a Polish painter. Berezowska was born in Baranowicze, in the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire (present- day Belarus), to Polish parents Edmund Berezowski, who was an engineer and general, and Janina Berezowska nee Przec\u0142awska. She studied in Saint Petersburg, Krak\u00f3w and Munich. From 1933 to 1936 she lived in Paris and worked with magazines such as \"Le Figaro\", \"Le Rire\" and \"Ici Paris\". She made a few caricature cartoons of Adolf Hitler which resulted in the official protest of the German Embassy in Paris, which sued Berezowska. She appeared in court but escaped having to pay any fine. However, Nazi Germans remembered her \"outrage\". After her return to Poland and the outbreak of World War II she was imprisoned at Pawiak, and later - with the death sentence - sent and imprisoned in the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp. After the liberation of the Ravensbr\u00fcck camp by the Soviet forces she left, with a group of other Polish women, first for Stockholm and a year later, in 1946, returned to her native Poland and settled in Warsaw. ==External links== * Caricature Museum, Warsaw * Maja Berezowska 1956 Category:1893 births Category:1978 deaths Category:People from Baranavichy Category:People from Novogrudsky Uyezd Category:20th-century Polish painters Category:Polish women artists Category:20th-century Polish women artists Category:Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp survivors ",
