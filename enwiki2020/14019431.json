    "text": "National Cycle Route 11 is a bikeway in England on the UK's National Cycle Network, connecting Harlow in Essex to King's Lynn in Norfolk. ==Route== ===Harlow to Cambridge=== NCR 11 near Great Shelford, showing a double helix and a small part of the BRCA2 gene. Harlow | Bishop Stortford | Hinxton | Sawston | Cambridge Intersects with National Cycle Route 51 in Cambridge. A section of path, about long, from Great Shelford to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, is decorated with 10,257 lines of four colours representing the nucleotide sequence of the BRCA2 gene. This gene, implicated in early-onset breast cancer, was discovered in 1994; the discoverers included scientists from nearby Addenbrooke's Hospital and the Sanger Institute, Hinxton. This section of path also includes and commemorates the 10,000th mile of the National Cycle Network. It is fondly referred to by regular users as \"The DNA path\". It offers a fine view of White Hill and Clarke's Hill, which are the northernmost peaks of the Gog Magog Hills. ===Cambridge to King's Lynn=== Cambridge | Burwell | Wicken | Ely | Downham Market | Watlington | King's Lynn Intersects with National Cycle Route 1 near King's Lynn ==Proposed development== ===Wicken Fen Vision Spine Route=== Route 11 between Cambridge and Ely had a gap in the route, due to the difficulties of crossing the many waterways of the Cambridgeshire Fens. In 2011, the new bridge over Swaffham Bulbeck Lode, and surfacing of several sections of cycle path enables complete use of the route. This section of route 11 had been called the Wicken Fen Vision Spine Route, but in 2011 was named the Lodes Way. The project involves the construction of 18 km of cycleway and of a number of bridges over the man- made waterways known as lodes. The Lodes Way still has a foot bridge over Burwell Lode with restricted use. A new bridge is scheduled for completion in 2013. The project has received funding of \u00a3600,000 from the Sustrans Connect2 scheme. ==References== Category:Transport in Essex Category:Transport in Cambridgeshire Category:National Cycle Routes ",
