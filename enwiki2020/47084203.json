    "text": "On 26 June 2015, a mass shooting occurred at the tourist resort at Port El Kantaoui, about 10 kilometres north of the city of Sousse, Tunisia. Thirty- eight people, 30 of whom were British, were killed when a gunman, Seifeddine Rezgui, attacked a hotel. It was the deadliest non-state attack in the history of modern Tunisia, with more fatalities than the 22 killed in the Bardo National Museum attack three months before. The attack received widespread condemnation around the world. The Tunisian government later \"acknowledged fault\" for slow police response to the attack. == Background == In October 2013, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a botched attack on a Sousse beach while security forces foiled another planned attack nearby.timesofisrael.com: \"Tunisia to shut illegal mosques as IS claims deadly hotel attack\", 27 June 2015 The post-Tunisian revolution led to the 2014 parliamentary election in which the principal secularist party gained a plurality but was unable to govern alone, and ultimately formed a national unity government. Secularist Beji Caid Essebsi was elected president in the 2014 Tunisian presidential election. Since the overthrow of Tunisian president Ben Ali, terrorism increased, leading to 60 victims among security and military troops. Other attacks targeted civilians and tourists. Despite this, Tunisia was considered to be a secure country. On 18 March 2015, the Bardo National Museum in Tunis was attacked by three terrorists, leading to the deaths of twenty-two people, including twenty foreigners visiting the museum. Two of the gunmen, Tunisian citizens Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaoui, were killed by police, while the third attacker is currently at large. Police treated the event as a terrorist attack. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack, and threatened to commit further attacks. However, the Tunisian government blamed a local splinter group of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, called the Okba Ibn Nafaa Brigade, for the attack. A police raid killed nine members on 28 March. After the Bardo attack, the government announced new security measures and declared the country safe again. ==Attack== On 26 June 2015 the Spanish-owned five-star Riu Imperial Marhaba Hotel at Port El Kantaoui, a tourist complex situated on the coast about ten kilometres north of Sousse, Tunisia, was hosting 565 guests, mainly from Western Europe, 77% of its capacity. Tourists from the hotel as well as from the Soviva Hotel located nearby went to the beach to swim and sunbathe. At around noon, Seifeddine Rezgui Yacoubi, disguised as a tourist, socialised with others, and then took out a Kalashnikov assault rifle concealed in a beach umbrella and fired at the tourists on the beach. He entered the hotel, shooting at people he came across. He was killed by security forces during an exchange of fire. All bullets were found to have been fired from the one weapon; the attacker had four magazines of ammunition.Kalashnikov magazines typically hold 30 rounds, though capacities from 5 to 100 rounds are available The attacker had spoken to his father on a mobile telephone which he then threw into the sea during the attack; it was retrieved. An Interior Ministry spokesman said that they were sure that others helped but did not participate directly, providing the Kalashnikov and helping Rezgui to the scene. ===Victims=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable floatright\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:left; margin:0 0 1.5em 1.5em;\" !Nationality!!Deaths!!Wounded!!Total!!Ref. |- | align=left | United Kingdom ||align=center|30 || style=\"text-align:center;\"|26 || align=center|56|| |- | Republic of Ireland || align=center|3 ||style=\"text-align:center;\"|0 ||align=center|3 || |- | text-align:left | Germany ||align=center| 2 || align=center|1 ||align=center|3 || |- | align=left | Belgium || align=center|1 || align=center|3 || align=center|4|| |- | Russia || align=center|1 || align=center|1 || align=center|2 ||The Latest: Germany Says 1 Citizen Killed in Tunisia Attack |- | Portugal || align=center|1 ||style=\"text- align:center;\"|0 ||align=center|1 || |- | Tunisia ||align=center|0 || align=center|7 || align=center|7 || |- | Ukraine ||align=center|0 || align=center|1 || align=center|1 ||Ukrainian woman injured in attack on Tunisia resort, life not in danger \u2013 Foreign Ministry |- !

He did not have the typical traits of an Islamic extremist: he had a girlfriend, drank alcohol and was a local break- dancing star. He was also believed to be high on cocaine during his rampage. He is believed to have been radicalized over such issues as the Libyan Civil War and Western inaction against the savagery of the Assad government during the Syrian Civil War. Rezgui is thought to have been recruited by Ajnad al- Khilafah,telegraph.co.uk: \"Tunisia attack: gunman's links to Britain\", 30 June 2015 an outgrowth of the Tunisian branch of Ansar al-Sharia, which was founded by Saifallah Ben Hassine, who had lived in the UK in the 1990s and whose mentor during that time was Abu Qatada.telegraph.co.uk: \"'Why weren\u2019t we told of Sousse suicide bomber?\u2019\", 4 July 2015 High Court papers relating to a control order placed on a British-based suspect state that Ben Hassine \"aimed to recruit new members and send them to Afghanistan for training\". The control order documents add that: \"Abu Qatada appears as a watermark running through the whole of this case as being the mastermind.\" Ben Hassine is reported to have been killed by the USAF near Adjabiya in eastern Libya on 14 June 2015. The strike was designed to kill Mokhtar Belmokhtar in an Ansar meeting. After the overthrow of Tunisia's President Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali in 2011, Ben Hassine was released from jail in March 2011 under an amnesty, and later founded Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia, which resisted proscription until 2013 arguing it was carrying out humanitarian work, even though Ben Hassine personally had led the storming of the US Embassy in Tunis on 14 September 2012, three days after Ansar's Libyan counterparts killed US ambassador J. Christopher Stevens in Benghazi, Libya. When Ansar was finally outlawed in August 2013, after the murders of two secular leftist MPs, he was listed as a proscribed terrorist by the United States, and he fled to Libya.telegraph.co.uk: \"Senior Tunisian jihadist and Osama bin Laden associate 'killed by US strike in Libya'\", 3 July 2015telegraph.co.uk: \"How Britain and the EU allowed jihadists to wage war on their own tourists\", 4 July 2015 Qatada wrote in a letter published online in January 2014 that Ben Hassine \"is among the best of those I have known in intellect\" and \"the most knowledgeable of people of my intentions ... for he was the closest of people to me\". In January 2017, documents obtained by Panorama identified Chamseddine al-Sandi as the mastermind behind the attack. He is named in confessions from suspects who were arrested in connection with the shootings. Rezgui was killed at the scene, but the documents obtained by Panorama say that he was recruited and directed by al-Sandi. The confessions say al-Sandi ran a militant cell responsible for both the Sousse shootings and the attack three months earlier at the Bardo National Museum in which 22 people died. Both attacks were claimed by the Islamic State.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38557946 ==Aftermath== Immediately after the attack, the flight JAF5017, on its way to Enfidha-Hammamet International Airport, was redirected to Brussels. German tour operator TUI offered German tourists the opportunity to fly back to Germany and to cancel or adjust their bookings in Tunisia. British tour operator Thomson announced that flights to Tunisia will be cancelled until at least 9 July 2015, with ten flights departing on the evening of the attacks to bring 2,500 customers in the resort back to the United Kingdom. EasyJet and Thomas Cook announced that customers planning to visit Tunisia would be able to change their travel plans free of charge. Hotels were targeted in attacks to undermine tourism and because they were considered \"brothels\" by ISIS. Both tourism and the related industries accounted for up to 14.9% of the Tunisian economy in 2014. The United Kingdom's Home Secretary Theresa May and Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood visited the site of the shooting on 29 June 2015. It was also announced that a Royal Air Force aircraft would be sent in order to repatriate bodies and evacuate the injured back to the UK. On 29 June an RAF Boeing C-17 Globemaster III flew from RAF Brize Norton to Tunisia to recover four British victims, with the C17 returning via Birmingham Airport to unload one patient, and returning to Brize Norton with the other three. Football scarves and shirts were laid as a tribute outside Bescot Stadium, home of Walsall F.C., the team which three of the British victims supported. On 29 June, the House of Commons chamber observed a minute of silence shortly before the Prime Minister David Cameron announced that a national minute of silence would be held on 3 July 2015 at 12:00 local time to remember the victims, exactly one week on from the attacks. Cameron later led several COBRA meetings. The Foreign Office sent a team to the hotel to support British survivors and know more about the British victims. The Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner announced an heightened police presence and security for Armed Forces Day and Pride London events taking place in London over the weekend. On 28 June 2015, Her Majesty The Queen said she and the Duke of Edinburgh were shocked by the attack and also offered their deepest sympathy to the injured. Sixteen British counter-terrorism police were deployed to Tunisia in the direct aftermath of the attacks, and almost 400 officers were sent to British airports to identify potential witnesses to the attack who had returned home. On 1 July, the bodies of eight British nationals who were killed in the attacks were flown from Tunisia to RAF Brize Norton. On 2 July, the bodies of a further nine British nationals who were killed in the attacks were flown to RAF Brize Norton and the Prime Minister David Cameron and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon began making calls for airstrikes in Syria, believing the Sousse attacks to have been coordinated from there. On 3 July, the UK held a nationwide minute's silence at 12:00 local time to remember the victims of the attacks as government buildings and Buckingham Palace flew the Union Jack at half-mast. A further eight bodies of British victims were repatriated back to RAF Brize Norton. On 4 July, the final five bodies of the British victims were repatriated back to the United Kingdom. An inquest to the attack was initially scheduled to start in November 2016 but was pushed back to 2017. On 16 January 2017, the first hearing of the inquest was held in the Royal Courts of Justice. The inquest found that the police response to the Tunisia Beach Attacks was \"at best shambolic and at worst cowardly\" after officers in the vicinity were found to be hiding or running in the opposite direction to the attacker. A security team close by to the attack and armed with assault rifles and wearing protective vests, retreated to wait for reinforcements for a half an hour, during which time the lone gunman killed the 38 victims. By March 2017, at least six police officers were referred to trial for criminal negligence for failing to help the victims, and 27 others were referred on similar charges, according to the Tunisian Justice Ministry. A coroner at the inquest ruled that the victims of the attacks were \"unlawfully killed\" prompting the relatives of British victims to take legal action against tour operator TUI. Allen Pembroke and Paul Short were awarded the Queen's Commendation for bravery for their actions in the 2017 Queen's Birthday Honours. ==Reactions== Tunisian president Beji Caid Essebsi called for a global strategy against terrorism and visited Sousse with Prime Minister Habib Essid, who promised to close 80 mosques within the week.yahoo.com: \"Tunisia government says to close 80 mosques for inciting violence, after hotel attack\", 26 June 2015 The government also plans to crack down on financing for certain associations as a countermeasure against another attack.dw.com: \"Tunisia to close 80 mosques following terror attack\", 27 June 2015 Essid announced new anti-terrorism measures, including the deployment of reserve troops to reinforce security at \"sensitive sites ... and places that could be targets of terrorist attacks.\" The \"exceptional plan to better secure tourist and archaeological sites\" will include \"deploying armed tourist security officers all along the coast and inside hotels from 1 July,\" and that: Beji Caid Essebsi also denounced the \"cowardly\" attacks, promising \"painful but necessary\" measures to fight extremism in the country. He called for a firm response: \"No country is safe from terrorism, and we need a global strategy of all democratic countries,\" On 4 July, Essebsi removed from his post the provincial Governor of Sousse and at least five senior police officers. Among the policemen dismissed were three from Sousse, one from Gaafour (the home city of Rezgui) and one from Kairouan, where Rezgui was studying.telegraph.co.uk: \"Tunisia sacks governor and police over terror attacks\", 4 July 2015 On 22 July, Tunisian MPs began a three-day debate on new counter-terrorism legislation. The legislation would allow the courts to impose death sentences to those convicted of terrorism-related offences. The legislation would also make public support of terrorism a jailable offence. If passed, the bill would allow law enforcement and security services to tap phone calls of individuals suspected of terrorism.\"Tunisia seeking to confront extremist threat with new anti-terrorism bill\", 22 July 2015 On 8 July, the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office changed the advised status of Tunisia to \"Advise against all but essential travel\", resulting from 9 July in the planned return home of the estimated 3,000 British nationals in Tunisia at that time. ABTA and travel organisations First Choice, TUI and Thomson have stated that they plan to send no further British tourists to Tunisia until after 31 October 2015. == Memorials == On 4 March 2019, a memorial to the British victims, and a victim of the Bardo attack, called Infinite Wave, was unveiled in Cannon Hill Park, Birmingham, England, by Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex. ==Other Islamist attacks== Four other Islamist attacks took place on the same day in France, Kuwait, Syria and Somalia. The attacks followed an audio message released three days earlier by ISIL senior leader Abu Mohammad al-Adnani encouraging militants everywhere to attack during the month of Ramadan. No definitive link between the attacks has yet been established. One attack, at a French factory, resulted in the beheading of one person; another bombing at a Shia mosque in Kuwait City killed at least 27; and the other attack on an African Union base in Somalia undertaken by Al-Shabaab, killed at least 70. ==See also== * List of rampage killers (religious, political, or ethnic crimes) * List of Islamist terrorist attacks * List of terrorist incidents in 2015 * List of terrorist incidents in Tunisia ==References== ==External links== *Tunisia's Security Concerns Category:2010s mass shootings in Africa Category:2010s murders in Tunisia Category:Arab Winter in Tunisia Category:Attacks in 2015 Category:Attacks on hotels in Africa Category:Attacks on tourists Category:British terrorism victims Category:Deaths by firearm in Tunisia Category:ISIL terrorist incidents in Tunisia Category:Islamic terrorist incidents in 2015 Category:June 2015 crimes Category:June 2015 events in Africa Category:Mass murder in 2015 Category:Mass murder in Tunisia Category:Terrorist incidents in Tunisia in 2015 Category:2015 mass shootings ",
