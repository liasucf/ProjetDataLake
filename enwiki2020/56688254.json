    "text": "Carlos Eduardo Taddeo (born August 24, 1975), better known as Eduardo, is a rapper, songwriter, activist, educator, and Brazilian writer. He is one of the founders and leaders of the Fac\u00e7\u00e3o Central group, in which he was a vocalist and composer of all lyrics. He left the group on March 18, 2013. Eduardo influenced his musical career by his brother-in-law known as Equipado, who was his sister's boyfriend. Eduardo lectures throughout Brazil and periodically visits the Casa Foundation. Despite not having completed his elementary school, he encourages young people from the periphery to study in interviews, shows and lectures, saying that \"having a diploma and being well informed is more audacious than carrying machine guns.\" In 2012, he launched A Guerra n\u00e3o Declarada na Vis\u00e3o de um Favelado, his first book. Eduardo (composer and performer) and Dum-Dum (performer) were born and grew up in favelas of S\u00e3o Paulo in an environment where social violence, criminality, drug trafficking and drug addiction were rampant. This violent past became a source of inspiration to Eduardo's political lyrics. Still in 1989, he founded rap group Fac\u00e7\u00e3o Central together with Nego (currently known as Rapper Mag) and Jurandir, the last two members left the group, while Garga and Dum-Dum joined Eduardo and started the group's activities. He remained as leader and main composer of the group's lyrics until March 18, 2013, when Eduard officially communicated in a video that was posted on Youtube announcing his departure from the group due to some personal disagreements and ideological differences. Recently released a new single; \"Conzpirasom\" that was composed by rappers Kask\u00e3o (Trilha Sonora do Gueto) and by the writer Ferr\u00e9z, in partnership with the designer and illustrator Alexandre De Maio. On December 20, 2014 he announces his pre-release album A Fant\u00e1stica F\u00e1brica de Cad\u00e1ver with the participation of artists such as Yzal\u00fa, A286, Dexter and Trilha Sonora do Gueto. ==Discography== === Studio album === *A Fant\u00e1stica F\u00e1brica de Cad\u00e1ver (2014) ===With Fac\u00e7\u00e3o Central group=== *Juventude de Atitude (1994) *Estamos de Luto (1998) *Versos Sangrentos (1999) *A Marcha F\u00fanebre Prossegue (2000) *Direto do Campo de Exterm\u00ednio (2003) *O Espet\u00e1culo do Circo dos Horrores (2005) == Author's works == ===Books=== * A Guerra n\u00e3o Declarada na Vis\u00e3o de um Favelado(2008\u20132016) == References == == External links == * * Carlos Eduardo Taddeo at Discogs * Eduardo Discography at Discogs * Eduardo on Dicion\u00e1rio Cravo Albin da M\u00fasica Popular Brasileira Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian rappers Category:Brazilian male composers Category:21st-century composers Category:Horrorcore artists Category:Hip hop activists Category:21st-century male musicians ",
