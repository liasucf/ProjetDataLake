    "text": "Joseph Will Oldham (born January 15, 1970), is an American singer-songwriter and actor. From 1993 to 1997, he performed and recorded in collaboration with dozens of other musicians under variations of Palace (Palace, Palace Flophouse, Palace Brothers, Palace Songs, and Palace Music). After briefly publishing music under his own name, in 1998 he adopted Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy as the name for most of his work. ==Biography== Oldham was born on January 15, 1970, in Louisville, Kentucky.Alan Licht (Ed.) (2012), Will Oldham on Bonnie \"Prince\" Billy. Faber and Faber Ltd., London, pp. viii. . He lived in Louisville until he graduated from the J. Graham Brown School in 1988, then briefly attended Brown University amidst his career in music and film. He is married to the fabric artist Elsa Hansen Oldham. They had a child together in 2018. ==Music== Oldham is known for his \"do-it-yourself punk aesthetic and blunt honesty,\" and his music has been likened to Americana, folk, roots, country, punk, and indie rock. He has been called an \"Appalachian post-punk solipsist\", with a voice that has been described as \"a fragile sort-of warble frittering around haunted melodies in the American folk or country tradition.\" Oldham first performed and recorded under various permutations of the Palace name, including Palace Brothers, Palace Songs, Palace Music, and simply Palace. Regarding the name changes during this period (1993\u20131997), Oldham said: Will stated in a 1995 interview with KCRW that the name Palace Flophouse was inspired by reading John Steinbeck's Cannery Row. Beginning in 1998, Oldham has primarily used the moniker Bonnie 'Prince' Billy, which draws inspiration from several sources: He has explained that \"the primary purpose of the pseudonym is to allow both the audience and the performer to have a relationship with the performer that is valid and unbreakable.\" ===Discography=== ====Studio albums==== * There Is No-One What Will Take Care of You \u2013 Palace Brothers (1993)Knott, Alex.
