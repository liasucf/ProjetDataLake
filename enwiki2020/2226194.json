While the five-pointed star is the symbol of the religion, being used to represent the human body and Messengers of God, more common symbols include the nine-pointed star, the Greatest Name, and the Ringstone symbol, representing perfection, and the Messengers of God. ==Five-pointed star== An unidentified tablet in the B\u00e1b's handwriting.An unidentified tablet in the B\u00e1b's handwriting. The five- pointed star, or haykal () is the symbol of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith as mentioned by Shoghi Effendi, head of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in the first half of the 20th century: \"Strictly speaking the 5-pointed star is the symbol of our Faith, as used by the B\u00e1b and explained by Him.\" The five-pointed star has been used as the outline of special letters or tablets by both the B\u00e1bMoojan Momen (2019). The Star Tablet of the Bab. British Library Blog. and Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h.Bayat, Mohamad Ghasem (2001). An Introduction to the S\u00faratu'l-Haykal (Discourse of The Temple) in Lights of Irfan, Book 2. Haykal is a loan word from the Hebrew word h\u0113y\u1e35\u0101l, which means temple and specifically Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. In Arabic, the word also means the body or form of something, particularly the human body. In the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed tradition, the haykal was established by the B\u00e1b -- who told of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's coming -- who represented the haykal as a five-pointed star representing the human body as a head, two hands, and two feet. The B\u00e1b wrote many letters, tablets, prayers and more in the shape of a five-pointed star, including some that included many derivatives of the word Bah\u00e1\u02bc (see below). In Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's writings, specifically the S\u00fariy-i-Haykal (Tablet of the Temple), while the meaning of temple remains present, the haykal is used mainly to mean the human body, but particularly the body of the Manifestation of God -- a messenger from God -- and the person of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h himself. In the Tablet, the haykal is also used to refer to the word of God, which is revealed by the Manifestations of God. He also says in the same Tablet: > \"O Living Temple! We have, in very truth,...ordained Thee to be the emblem > of My Cause betwixt the heavens and the earth...\" ==The Greatest Name== The word Bah\u00e1\u02bc In Islamic belief God has 99 names, and in some Islamic traditions it is believed that there is a special hidden 100th name, which is the greatest. In Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed belief the Greatest Name is Bah\u00e1\u02bc (), translated as \"glory\" or \"splendour\". Many symbols of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith derive their significance from the word Bah\u00e1\u02bc, and it is the root word used in many other names and phrases including Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed (a follower of Bah\u00e1\u02bc), Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h (Glory of God), \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 (Servant of Glory), Y\u00e1 Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'l-Abh\u00e1 (O Thou Glory of the Most Glorious), and All\u00e1h-u-Abh\u00e1 (God is Most Glorious). Calligraphy of the Greatest Name Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h often referred to Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in his writings as \"the people of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\", and in addition, the B\u00e1b sent a tablet to Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h with 360 derivatives of the word Bah\u00e1\u02bc. Along with daily prayers, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds are encouraged to recite the phrase \"All\u00e1h-u-Abh\u00e1\" 95 times in a form of meditation. Arabic letters in the Greatest Name The symbol known as Greatest Name is an Arabic calligraphic rendering of \"Y\u00e1 Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'l-Abh\u00e1\" ( usually translated as \"O Thou the Glory of the Most Glorious!\"). This rendering was originally drawn by the early Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed calligrapher Mishk\u00edn Qalam, and later adopted by Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds everywhere. Since the symbol refers more directly to the Name of God and of the Messenger of God, than any other symbol in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, it is not generally used in a casual manner or to adorn the personal artifacts that are put to common use. The symbol can usually be seen in Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed homes and rings that are produced on a limited scale. ==Nine-pointed star== right According to the Abjad system of Isopsephy, the word Bah\u00e1\u02bc has a numerical equivalence of 9, and thus there is frequent use of the number 9 in Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed symbols. The most commonly used symbol connected to the number 9 is the nine-pointed star; there is no particular design of the nine-pointed star that is used more often than others. While the star is not a part of the teachings of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, it is commonly used as an emblem representing \"9\", because of the association of number 9 with perfection, unity and Bah\u00e1\u02bc. The number 9 also comes up several times in Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed history and teachings. On the significance of the number 9, Shoghi Effendi wrote: > \"Concerning the number nine: the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds reverence this for two reasons, > first because it is considered by those interested in numbers as the sign of > perfection. The second consideration, which is the more important one, is > that it is the numerical value of the word \"Bah\u00e1\u02bc\"\u2026 > \"Besides these two significances the number nine has no other meaning. It > is, however, enough to make the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds use it when an arbitrary number is > to be chosen.\"On behalf of Shoghi Effendi, published in Its use on gravestone markers was approved by Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, in 1944. ==Ringstone symbol== An artistic representation of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Ringstone Symbol Ringstone symbol on jewelry The ringstone symbol was designed by \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, and, as its name implies, is the most common symbol found on rings worn by Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, but it is also used on necklaces, book covers, and paintings. It consists of two stars (haykal) interspersed with a stylized Bah\u00e1\u02bc. The lower line is said to represent humanity and the world of creation, the upper line the world of God, and the middle line represents the special station of Manifestation of God and the world of revelation; the vertical line is the Primal Will or Holy Spirit proceeding from God through the Manifestations to humanity. The position of Manifestation of God in this symbol is said to be the linking point to God. The two stars or haykals represent Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and the B\u00e1b.\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, published in ==Symbolic language== Nightingale, symbolizing Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, by calligrapher Mishk\u00edn- Qalam. The writings of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h contain many allegories and symbolic language, often taken from nature (e.g., the sun, clouds, trees, rivers, oceans, valleys, mountains, gardens, birds, etc.), referring to spiritual principles. Christopher Buck analyses a selection of six key scenarios (the Promised One, the Covenant, illumination, lover and the beloved, the Maid of Heaven, the crimson ark and the Holy Mariner) and six root metaphors (physician, wine/water of life, mirror/gems, the journey, lote-tree/Sinai, paradise). Other analysis has been done by Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed scholars John Hatcher, William Collins, and Ruhiyyih Khanum.Rabbani, Ruhiyyih (1984). The Desire of the World: Materials for the Contemplation of God and His Manifestation for This Day. George Ronald, Oxford, UK. Includes a list of names of God and titles of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed writings. A true understanding of the multiple meanings in the sacred texts can only be reached by a purification of the heart, together with the guidance of the Manifestations of God and their appointed interpreters. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds are free to hold to their own understanding of the texts, as long as they do not force it on others, realize that their understanding is limited, and that they all follow the binding authority of the appointed interpreters. ==See also== * Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed cosmology * Talismans in the B\u00e1b\u00ed and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faiths ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * ==External links== *The Art of the Greatest Name *The Nine-Pointed Star, History and Symbolism - by the Universal House of Justice, 1999 *Story of the Ringstone Symbol - www.spiritual-education.org *Greatest Name Song and Poem Site used with permission, a public site Category:Symbols of Abrahamic religions Symbols ",
