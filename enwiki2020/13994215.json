[Quote:] > \"Erd\u00f6s came to my twins' bar mitzvah, notebook in hand,\" said Peter Winkler, > a colleague of Graham's at AT&T.; \"He also brought gifts for my children--he > loved kids--and behaved himself very well. But my mother-in-law tried to > throw him out. She thought he was some guy who wandered in off the street, > in a rumpled suit, carrying a pad under his arm. It is entirely possible > that he proved a theorem or two during the ceremony.\" == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century mathematicians Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:Dartmouth College faculty Category:Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt faculty ",
