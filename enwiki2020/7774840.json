    "text": "David Needham (born 21 May 1949) is an English former professional footballer who played in the Football League for Notts County, Queens Park Rangers and Nottingham Forest, and in the North American Soccer League for the Toronto Blizzard, in the 1970s and 1980s. ==Playing career== ===Notts County=== Needham started his career at Notts County in 1966. He spent eleven years at the Magpies. ===Queens Park Rangers=== He was signed by Queens Park Rangers in the close season of 1977 for \u00a390,000. He was signed to replace the recently retired Frank McLintock in the centre of QPR's defence. He only spent six months at the West London club. ===Nottingham Forest=== Newly promoted Nottingham Forest signed him in December 1977 for \u00a3140,000. At the end of the 1977\u201378 season he had picked up a winners medal as Forest won the First Division, but was ineligible for the League Cup which they won as he had played for QPR earlier in the competition. He did win a League Cup winners medal the following season when Forest retained the trophy, and was in the team which lost the 1980 final, when a mix-up between Needham and Peter Shilton led to the winning goal for Andy Gray. He was an unused substitute in both of Forest's European Cup final wins in 1979 and 1980. ===Toronto Blizzard=== He left Forest in 1982 to play in Canada. He signed for Toronto Blizzard in the North American Soccer League. ===International=== Needham was capped six times for England 'B', scoring twice. ==References== Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:England B international footballers Category:English expatriate footballers Category:English expatriate sportspeople in Canada Category:English footballers Category:Expatriate soccer players in Canada Category:North American Soccer League (1968\u20131984) players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Notts County F.C. players Category:People educated at City of Leicester Boys' Grammar School Category:Sportspeople from Leicester Category:Queens Park Rangers F.C. players Category:Toronto Blizzard (1971\u20131984) players Category:Kettering Town F.C. players Category:Association football defenders Category:UEFA Champions League winning players ",
