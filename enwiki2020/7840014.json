Snowboy \u2013 with his band the Latin Section, comprising the cream of the UK's Latin Jazz musicians \u2013 carries the torch with their authentic Latin jazz style. Together they create a sound which whilst encompassing the influences from the masters of the genre (in particular Eddie Palmieri and Tito Puente), is also highly capable of intense swing and verve. Snowboy and the Latin Section have developed a unique and often identifiable sound in Latin dance music, something that is hard to do in this day and age, especially in the Latin jazz arena. Percussively explosive uptempo original compositions, at times tinged with folklore that continues their quest to keep the music exciting and to keep the dancers dancing.Snowboy \u2013 The UK's Ambassador of Afro-Cuban Jazz \u2013 Official Webpage Snowboy is currently still touring with his own band and Lisa Stansfield and is involved in production with Lisa, DB Cohen and Chloe Marriot.
