While Rafsanjani favored foreign investment and market reforms, Karroubi and others \"sought to promote mass political participation and maintain state control of the economy\".

Karroubi is a critic of the Guardian Council and on numerous occasions wrote letters to the council expressing his concerns. He criticized the nature of the Guardian Council's supervision over the elections, saying in 2009 \"I have opposed the notion of 'approbation supervision' power since it was introduced 20 years ago \u2026 But, today the problem goes beyond 'approbation supervision'. What goes on today is not 'supervision' at all. Guardian Council inspectors hold absolute authority and control over the elections\". ===Foreign policies=== Karroubi and the National Trust Party support the idea of dialogue with the United States aiming at resolving long standing conflicts. Early after the election of Barack Obama as US president, Karroubi stated that the changes from the United States have been positive. \"An important step has been taken\u2026.

As neither gathered a majority of the vote, a run-off election was held on 24 June 2005, and won by Ahmadinejad. After the announcement of the election results, Karroubi alleged that a network of mosques, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Basij militia forces had been illegally used to generate and mobilize support for Ahmadinejad. He then explicitly alleged that Mojtaba Khamenei, a son of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, was among the conspirators. Ayatollah Khamenei wrote to Karroubi, characterizing these allegations as \"below his dignity\" and warning that they would \"result in a crisis\" in Iran, which he would not allow.

During the last months before the election, he refused a call for him to withdraw in the support of Mohammad Khatami or later Mir-Hossein Mousavi. After Khatami withdrew from the race in March, Karroubi said \"I have neither signed contracts with anyone nor have been promised anything. Khatami withdrew his candidacy by virtue of his personal decision. In my meeting with Mousavi I persuaded him to join the fray.\" Later, both Mousavi and Karroubi stated that a union among reformists would only help Ahamadinejad's reelection, claiming that reformists needed a massive turn out in order to win and that more candidates would advance their interests. Karroubi publicized his policies by publishing four electoral declarations. According to a paper handed to his supporters during the campaign his main policies are: # Returning to the planned-based system of governing and using the elite and experts in decision making process # Organizing financial policies and increasing the effect of national budget # Protecting human rights and people's privacy # Improving women's social status # Nationalizing oil profits # Supporting NGOs # Supporting the right of religious or tribal minorities # Supporting the domination of law and opposing and criticizing illegal behavior # Supporting the press and free access to the information and internet In a 2009 interview with the AFP, Karroubi also promised to expand women's rights if elected president of Iran.

Former Tehran mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi was among the first to endorse him, and was Karroubi's campaign manager. Karroubi has promised to appoint him vice president if elected.
