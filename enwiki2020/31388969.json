    "text": "The 1884\u201385 season was the first season in which Leicester Fosse competed in a senior football competition, though they would not play competitive football until 1887 and did not join the Football League until 1892, so only friendly matches were played. ==Results== ===Friendly Matches=== *Note: A cumulative record shows 2 untraced games of 1884-85 finishing in a 0-0 draw and a 0-2 defeat. With games at Victoria Park, it is impossible to know whether Leicester are considered the \"Home\" or \"Away\" team as several other local teams, including several in these fixtures, played at the same venue. *Leicester City scores given first {| class= border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- !Date !Opponents !Venue !Result |- bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |align=left|1 November 1884 |align=left|Syston Fosse |Fosse Road |5\u20130 |- bgcolor=\"#ffffdd\" |align=left|8 November 1884 |align=left|Wyggestone Boys School |Victoria Park |1\u20131 |- bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\" |align=left|15 November 1884 |align=left|Mill Hill House |Victoria Park |1\u20132 |- bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |align=left|22 November 1884 |align=left|Syston St. Peters |Away |2\u20131 |- bgcolor=\"#ffffdd\" |align=left|29 November 1884 |align=left|Mill Hill House |Victoria Park |0\u20130 |- bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |align=left|3 January 1885 |align=left|Melbourne Hall |Victoria Park |2\u20130 |- bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |align=left|10 January 1885 |align=left|Syston Fosse |Victoria Park |1\u20130 |- bgcolor=\"#ffffdd\" |align=left|31 January 1885 |align=left|Mill Hill House |Victoria Park |1\u20131 |- bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |align=left|7 February 1885 |align=left|Syston St. Peters |Victoria Park |2\u20130 |- bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\" |align=left|7 March 1885 |align=left|Wyggeston Boys School |Victoria Park |0\u20131 |- bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |align=left|14 March 1885 |align=left|Mill Hill House |Victoria Park |2\u20130 |- bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |align=left|21 March 1885 |align=left|St. Mary's |Victoria Park |1\u20130 |} ==Notes== A. 12 a-side match.
