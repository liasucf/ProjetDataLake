They met in New York City, they had three children and moved to Bergenfield, New Jersey to make room for their growing family. Eventually they moved to Englewood, where Rosendahl was born as child number six. His parents would have two more children, for a total of eight. While attending St. Cecilia\u2019s Catholic School, he was elected president of the junior class and president of the student government. Rosendahl saw this as evidence that he had natural leadership capabilities. He was openly gay during the majority of his adulthood, but struggled with the idea of being gay in his youth. At the age of 29 he took eighteen months off from work and toured around the world, coming to the conclusion that he was gay. At first he was upset about this realization, due to the struggles he would likely endure. Rosendahl had first suspect that he was gay during early puberty in the Boy Scouts. He noticed that he had an attraction to boys instead of girls. He later checked out a book on homosexuality from a local library and learned about the significance of Fire Island and Christopher Street to gay people. Rosendahl would come to the realization later in his life that homosexuality was simply \"another expression of nature,\" and no reason to be ashamed. Rosendahl stated in an interview with the Lavender Effect that he was the victim of a gay bashing while in graduate school. He was walking from a gay bar to campus when five men ran up to him screaming obscenities and slurs, and then began beating him. He fought back but received injuries. He filed a police report about the incident. Rosendahl endured discrimination while working at Westinghouse Broadcasting and Cable, where his boss removed his staff and placed him in a windowless office because they expected he was gay. At the age of 32, at his mother's funeral, he came out to his family. He later came out to his boss, the chairman of the board of Century Cable, and found his boss to be accepting. Christopher Blauman and Rosendahl were romantic partners for fourteen years. Blauman died from AIDS in January 1995. Later in life, he and Hedi el Kholti were partners for nearly two decades, until Rosendahl's death. Rosendahl had an affinity for nature, and believed that having a connection to the environment was key to preserving the mental health and vitality of gay people. He kept a garden regularly and considered it key to his survival. In 2012 Rosendahl was diagnosed with stage four cancer. He was told by doctors that he would likely be dead before the upcoming November elections. This pushed him to fight harder for the causes he believed in. Rosendahl received a large amount of support from the public. Visitors from many cultures and religious groups visited him during his illness. He believed this outpouring of support from the public gave him the strength to fight the disease well beyond its expected prognosis. Rosendahl died at his home in Mar Vista, Los Angeles of ureteral cancer on March 30, 2016 at the age of 70.Beloved Westside Councilmember Dill Rosendahl Dies At 70 , laist.com, March 30, 2016. ==See also== * Los Angeles City Council * Los Angeles City Council District 11 ==References== Category:1945 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Gay politicians Category:LGBT city councillors from the United States Category:LGBT people from California Category:Los Angeles City Council members Category:California Democrats Category:Television anchors from Los Angeles Category:Television personalities from California Category:Saint Vincent College alumni Category:University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work alumni ",
