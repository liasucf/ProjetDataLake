    "text": "Scarecrow and Mrs. King is an American television series that aired from October 3, 1983, to May 28, 1987 on CBS. The show starred Kate Jackson and Bruce Boxleitner, as divorced housewife Amanda King and top-level \"Agency\" operative Lee Stetson, who begin an unusual partnership and eventual romance after encountering one another in a train station. ==Plot== Amanda King is a divorced housewife who lives with her mother, Dotty, and her young sons, Philip and Jamie. One morning, Agency operative Lee Stetson, code-named \"Scarecrow\", hands her a package while he is being pursued. He instructs her to \"give it to the man in the red hat\", but she is unable to complete the assignment, as there are many men in fezzes in the train car at the time. Scarecrow later has to track her down to recover the package, inadvertently getting her involved with his case. When Stetson is captured by his pursuers and marked for elimination, King ends up solving the secret behind the package, finding and rescuing Stetson, and even taking down their opponents, thereby getting introduced to the Agency. Inquisitive, King seeks to learn more about the organization and ends up working for them, first in an office role and later receiving training to become a full agent, while keeping her new job a secret from her family. She works under Stetson's boss, Billy Melrose, and with dismissive fellow agent Francine Desmond. Stetson and King work together even though he is initially reluctant to work with the \"rookie\" but eventually they become a good team. The pair travel to places like Germany and England and help each other as they pose as other people, sometimes posing as husband and wife. Escapades involving cruise ships and getting \"married\" are some of their assignments, and the KGB or other enemies of the United States are always involved. Amanda's ex-husband, Joe King, is still friendly with Amanda and is later suspected of murder. Stetson and King develop a friendship that turns into a romantic relationship. While many suitors for King and Stetson appear, in the end they stay with each other. Stetson professes his love for King before going into hiding from the Agency, and he then proposes after her kidnapping. However, because of concerns for the safety of King's family, they must keep the marriage secret from their employer, friends, and families. ==Cast== ===Main cast=== * Kate Jackson as Amanda King * Bruce Boxleitner as Lee Stetson (\"Scarecrow\") * Beverly Garland as Dotty West (Amanda's mother) * Paul Stout as Philip King (Amanda's son) * Greg Morton as Jamie King (Amanda's son) * Mel Stewart as Billy Melrose * Martha Smith as Francine Desmond * Sam Melville as Joe King (Amanda's ex- husband) ===Guest cast=== *Hildegard Knef, Russian princess targeted by assassins, 1.21, \"Waiting for Godorsky\" (credited as Hildegard Neff) *Jean Stapleton, British spy Lady Emily Farnsworth, two episodes, 2.4, \"The Legend of Das Geisterschloss\", and 2.11, \"The Three Faces of Emily\" *Raleigh Bond, information man T.P.
