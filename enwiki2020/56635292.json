As a poet, Droog performed on stages inside and outside the Netherlands, notably with De Dichters uit Epibreren, a group consisting of the poets Droog and Tjitse Hofman and the musician Jan Klug, which he co-founded. De Dichters uit Epibreren existed from 1994 to 2011; in 2003 they were awarded the Johnny van Doorn Prize for Spoken Literature. Droog took stage in Iran, Armenia, South Africa and many European countries. In 2002, the city council of Groningen appointed Droog as the first stadsdichter (city poet), for a three year period.Philip Hoorne, 'Modern Minstrels. City Poets in the Low Countries', Literature from the Low Countries Yearbook, 2008. In that period he developed the concept of 'De eenzame uitvaart' (The Lonely Funeral): the city poet writes a poem for the deceased without relatives and reads the poem at the funeral. Poets in other cities in the Netherlands and Flanders adopted this idea.Christine Ro, 'The Dutch City Poets Who Memorialize the Lonely Dead', Ploughshares, December 24th 2016. Droog was, from 2008 to 2010, also the city poet of his town of birth. He established the Stichting Nederlandse Po\u00ebzie Encyclopedie (Foundation Dutch Poetry Encyclopedia), of which the main goals are to spread Dutch poetry and the knowledge of Dutch language poetry, including through the online Poetry Encyclopedia, the Nederlandse Po\u00ebzie Encyclopedie.Nederlandse Po\u00ebzie Encyclopedie, Colofon From 2013 onwards, Droog also works as an investigative journalist.
