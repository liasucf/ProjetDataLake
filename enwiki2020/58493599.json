Indiaglitz stated, \"Kannan has an idea and has pursued it without any compromise. That in itself deserves credit, and he has also made a good job of it. It is by no means a perfect film\" and added that \"Navya Nair is the scene-stealer\". P. V. Sathish Kumar of nowrunning.com rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote, \"Be it the cast or the storyline or the direction everything is different and Kannan has shown his deftness in all these elements of filmmaking. He must be lauded for making a sincere attempt with an absorbing story\". A reviewer of The Hindu said, \"Kannan brings in the commercial element through duets and dream songs. His profound, thought- provoking dialogue in 'Vedam Pudhidhu' and now in 'Amirtham' will remain unforgettable for long. As a dialogue writer Kannan shines. But his story is bogged down by too many issues\". ==References== Category:2006 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:2000s Tamil- language films Category:Indian drama films Category:Films about the Indian caste system Category:2006 directorial debut films Category:2006 drama films ",
