Much of its historic core was built to house estate workers in the late 18th century. Glamis houses the Angus Folk Museum run by the National Trust for Scotland. This is a museum of days past, recreating scenes of rural life such as a minister's parlour; a schoolroom; a laundry; and an agricultural area, along with displays of tools, everyday artifacts, and old crafts. It is housed in an adapted row of single storey stone cottages, originally built in 1793. The parish church of Glamis, dedicated to Saint Fergus, was founded in the early medieval period (probably 8th century AD). The present building is 18th- century with an interior recast in the 1930s, but retains a vaulted 15th- century aisle from the medieval church which preceded it. The aisle is the burial place (photo) of the Bowes-Lyon family, owners of Glamis Castle. One of its park gates is situated near the parish church. The castle hosts various events throughout the year, notably the Proms evening when thousands of people traditionally turn out with picnics ranging from the small to the elaborate. ==In Shakespeare== In the tragedy of Macbeth by William Shakespeare, Macbeth is the Thane of Glamis. He later becomes the Thane of Cawdor and the king of Scotland, in fulfillment of the witches' prophecy. Even though Glamis is only a small village, several cities in Britain have streets named after it. This is due to the popularity of naming streets after Shakespearean characters and locations during the Victorian Era. ==See also== *Ark Hill *Castleton *Charleston *Eassie Stone *Glamis Castle *Lord of Glamis *Monster of Glamis *Wester Denoon ==References== Category:Villages in Angus ",
