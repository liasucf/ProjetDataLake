    "text": "The York Regional Police (YRP) are a law enforcement organization that serves over 1.1 million residents in the York Region of Ontario, Canada, located north of Toronto. YRP was formed in 1971 from the police forces maintained by the nine municipalities which amalgamated into York Region at the time. While YRP provides marine policing in the waters on Lake Simcoe, policing for Georgina Island (as well as Fox and Snake islands) is provided by the Georgina Island Police with assistance from the Ontario Provincial Police. The islands have had separate policing under Ontario First Nation policing since 1978. ==History== York Regional Police at a Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada fundraising event The York Regional Police were formed in 1971, when the province forced the creation of a regional upper-tier municipal government that included the lower-tier municipalities of York County. Prior to 1971, there were several police forces serving individual communities: * County of York Constabulary * King Township Police; * Vaughan Township Police - dates back to the establishment of Vaughan Township Municipal Police Department in 1924 * Whitchurch Township Police * Markham Township Police - responsible for policing in the villages of Markham, Thornhill and Unionville * North Gwillimbury Township Police; * Georgina Township Police; * East Gwillimbury Township Police; * Town of Richmond Hill Police; * Town of Newmarket Police; * Town of Aurora Police; * Village of Stouffville Police; * Village of Sutton Police; * Village of Woodbridge Police The YRP's motto, \"Deeds Speak\", is derived from the motto of the 3rd York Militia Regiment, many of whom also served as local constables in the Home District. The YRP crest is based on the crest from the former County of York government. ==Command== The YRP's senior command consists of a chief of police and two deputy chiefs. The head of the police service is Chief Jim MacSween who was sworn in as chief on May 1, 2020. He replaced retired Chief Eric Jolliffe, after he served almost 10 years in the position.

The ERU is a group of specialized operators. The unit's primary mandate is to deal with high-risk situations beyond the safe operating limits of police officers with their normal equipment and training. The ERU provides assistance during any high risk situations by performing the following; *Containment *Apprehension of armed and/or barricaded persons *Hostage rescue *Explosive forced entry *Explosive disposal *High risk search warrants *High risk vehicles/trains/aircraft assaults In 1988 demand for the ERU was on the rise. Various operational obligations including the fatal shooting of an armed suspect by the ERU during a hostage rescue in Richmond Hill highlighted the need for additional members. In 1989 the ERU increased to 11 members. In 2001 the York Regional Police established a shared service agreement with the Durham Regional Police Service, which allows for reciprocal tactical support in the event of large scale or long duration deployments. The York Regional Police provide tactical team and hostage rescue team support to the South Simcoe Police Service upon their request. Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City, increased awareness of terrorist threats provided the greatest single incentive for growth and investment of tactical teams in Ontario since the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, Quebec. The ERU's roster was expanded in 2002 to an undisclosed number. The roster includes both snipers and explosives technicians. The ERU has full explosive forced entry capabilities, which are mainly used in its hostage rescue and armed/barricaded operations. The ERU is regularly involved in high-risk search warrant services within the York Region and the Greater Toronto Area as well as a number of high-profile joint forces operations within Ontario. The York Regional Police ERU conduct their own strenuous selection process, with the applicants mainly being from the departments' uniformed divisions. The unit also trains its own candidates in most required disciplines and is one of the founding members of the Ontario Tactical Advisory Body (OTAB). Members of the ERU currently hold positions within the OTAB and Canadian Explosive Technicians Association (CETA) as well as membership in the National Tactical Officers Association (NTOA) and International Association of Bomb Technicians and Investigators (IABTI). ==Traffic bureau== The traffic bureau was formed in 1989. At that time, the traffic bureau worked out of offices located at 200 Industrial Parkway South in the Town of Aurora. The traffic bureau was made up of officers whose primary function was to enforce traffic related laws. The unit was made up of six officers who drove motorcycles and marked police cruisers. As time went on the unit began to specialize in the reconstruction of motor vehicle collisions. The unit expanded to approximately 20 officers working on four different platoons. The platoons followed the regular uniform officer shifts. ===Collision reconstruction unit=== On January 1, 2002, the traffic bureau was split into two separate entities, a traffic enforcement unit and a technical collision investigation unit (TCIU). The TCIU was made up of six officers on two separate shifts supervised by one supervisor. In 2004, the technical collision investigation unit was renamed the \"collision reconstruction unit\". The unit had eight members made up of investigators and collision reconstructionists. The unit was still working with two shifts and each shift had a supervisor. At present the collision reconstruction unit is made up of 10 officers. Two teams of four investigators and collision reconstructionists and a supervisor. The team members specialize in investigative techniques and collision reconstruction. On December 15, 2003, York Regional Police's collision reconstruction unit investigated a collision on Rutherford Road west of Pine Valley Drive in the City of Vaughan that killed former NHL Chicago Black Hawks player Keith Magnusson. Rob Ramage, another former NHL player, was arrested and charged with impaired operation causing death and bodily harm, dangerous operation causing death and bodily harm, as well as over 80mgs. At the trial in the fall of 2007, Ramage was convicted of all the counts except the over 80mgs. In January 2008, Ramage was sentenced to four years in prison. He appealed his conviction and sentence. On July 12, 2010, the Ontario Court of Appeal upheld the conviction and sentence. The members of the unit have received training in collision reconstruction, marine reconstruction and other related fields in Ontario as well as in the US ===Enforcement unit=== The enforcement unit is responsible for enforcement of all traffic laws. Officers from the enforcement unit perform breath tests and test drivers for sobriety utilizing standardized field sobriety testing and drug recognition experts. The York Regional Police's traffic bureau has trained over 100 frontline officers in the SFST battery and 15 officers trained as DREs Officers from the enforcement unit utilize various speed measuring devices from hand-held radars and lasers to moving radar units in their police vehicles. Speed enforcement is conducted throughout the region. Special computerized ticket writing units are utilized in police vehicles to ensure there are no human errors. The enforcement unit also instituted a prohibited driver program where officers investigate persons convicted of criminal driving offences whereby their driving privileges are revoked. Members use unmarked vehicles and conduct surveillance on suspects' home and court to catch violators. ==Emergency services== The York Regional Police are part of the York Region's emergency services and works with: *York Region Paramedic Services *Fire Services in York Region *YRT/Viva Special Constable Services ==Community services== Bobby the Bear, Morris the Moose and Bucky the Beaver are the force's mascots and appear at various community events. The York Regional Police also operates a variety of musical ensembles by permission of the chief. The York Regional Police Pipes and Drums, the Community Chorus, and Youth Band all represent the police force at parades, community functions and ceremonies. === York Regional Police Pipes and Drums === The York Regional Police Pipes and Drums is a pipe band affiliated with the police service.
