    "text": "Judith and Her Maidservant is a painting by the Italian baroque artist Artemisia Gentileschi. Executed sometime between 1645 and 1650, it hangs in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples. The story comes from the deuterocanonical Book of Judith, in which Judith seduces and then assassinates the general Holofernes, who had besieged Judith's town. The exact moment depicted takes place after the murder when her maidservant places the severed head in a bag, while Judith checks around her. It is the third of three paintings that Gentileschi painted of the same moment, using a similar design. One was painted much earlier (and hangs in the Detroit Institute of Arts), while the other was painted in the early 1640s and now hangs in the Musee de la Castre, Cannes. == References == category:1640s paintings Category:Paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi ",
