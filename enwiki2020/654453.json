It stands out subtly between furrows and space, symbolizing the union of two races by means of the inalienable bond of the Christian faith. The cross also symbolizes the western Christian culture. The woman represents - Mrs. Juana D\u00edaz, the towns namesake - with her hands the woman strews thirteen grains of corn into thirteen furrows, symbolizing the seeds that germinated and were the base for the foundation and growth of our town. The woman dresses as those of her time. The sun symbolizes a new horizon, hope in the formation of a town. The sun within the coat of arms has thirteen rays, each represents one of the barrios of Juana D\u00edaz. Thirteen knolls stand out in the coat of arms symbolizing each of the thirteen barrios or barrios of Juana D\u00edaz.

The shackle and the whip represent Juana D\u00edaz as the martyr of 1887 because the most heinous, repressive institution known at the time was enforced in our town, \"El Componte\". It was in Juana D\u00edaz where liberal politicians and dedicated patriots were martyred because they fought against the tyranny imposed by Spanish General Romualdo Palacios. Palacios was the most tyrannical and cruel of all the governors of our nation. \"El Componte\", a military tribunal, was used to quiet the rebel voices of those who loved law and order. The harp represents the music, the quill pen dipped in the ink well represents the verse, the poetry. Juana D\u00edaz has generously given distinguished poets to Puerto Rican literature.
