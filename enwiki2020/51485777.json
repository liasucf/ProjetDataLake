    "text": "Sophie's Misfortunes () is a children's book written by the Countess of S\u00e9gur. The book was published in 1858 by the publisher Hachette. The illustrations were by Horace Castelli, a French artist. This is the first book of a trilogy; its sequels are Good Little Girls (1858) and The Holidays (1859). ==Plot== The story is set in a castle in the French countryside, during the Second French Empire. Sophie is a naughty little girl who lives with her parents, Monsieur and Madame de R\u00e9an. She is very curious and adventurous and keeps making blunders, though she is often reined in by the critical affection of Paul, her cousin, a good-hearted boy, always trying to show her the right track. Sophie's friends are Camille and Madeleine de Fleurville, \"really good\" little girls, whom Sophie does her best to imitate. ==Legacy == The success of Sophie's Misfortunes has been constant through the years and still goes on today; the book has been republished many times. Overseas, as well, it has been very successful. Vladimir Nabokov alluded to it in his novel Ada (1969), making up a novel called Sophie's Sophisms [Les Sophismes de Sophie] by a so- called \"Miss Stopchin\", as well Les Malheurs de Swann, a title which combines Countess of S\u00e9gur and Marcel Proust. In United Kingdom, the book was used as reference material to teach young girls French translation (boys would be trained using L'Histoire d'un conscrit de 1813, written by Erckmann-Chatrian). ==Main characters== * Sophie de R\u00e9an * Monsieur and Madame de R\u00e9an, Sophie's parents * Paul d'Auber, Sophie's cousin * Camille and Madeleine de Fleurville, Sophie's friends ==Adaptations== ===Cinema and television=== The book has inspired numerous film and television adaptations, including: * Sophie's Misfortunes (1946), by Jacqueline Audry. * Sophie's Misfortunes (1979), by Jean-Claude Brialy. * Sophie's Misfortunes (2016), by Christophe Honor\u00e9. === Music === * In 1935, French composer Jean Fran\u00e7aix wrote a ballet called Les Malheurs de Sophie (32 minutes, published by Schott). * Les Bonheurs de Sophie, piano sheet music by Chantal Auber, La Pl\u00e9iade, Pr\u00e9paratoire 1. * \"Les Malheurs de Sophie\", sung by Chantal Goya, a song from the movie made by Jean- Claude Brialy. * Les Malheurs de Sophie (2011), a musical by Virginie Aguzzoli. ===Animation=== * Sophie's Misfortunes ==Notes and references== * Les Nouveaux Malheurs de Sophie, a novel by Val\u00e9rie Dayre * Les Malheurs de Sophie, audio version (in French) Category:1858 French novels Category:1850s children's books Category:French novels adapted into films Category:French children's novels Category:Novels adapted into television shows Category:Novels adapted into ballets ",
