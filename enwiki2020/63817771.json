    "text": "Abdela\u00e2li Hadi (born 1962), known as The Butcher of Taroudant, is a Moroccan serial killer responsible for killing nine children, aged 11-16, between 2001 and 2004. He was later sentenced to death for his crimes. == Background == In August 2004, some locals came across human skeletons and skulls in the Taroudant valley, and quickly contacted police about the matter. Through the initial investigation, officers concluded that the total number of victims was 8 based on the located skulls, and due to the small bone size, all were determined to be small children. The news spread with lightning speed around the country, due to the heavy coverage by the national media. As for the investigators, they worked intensely to hunt down the perpetrator, searching for any and all clues that could lead to the killer. Using DNA collected from soil samples, a match was made with the parents of three of the murdered children. Each of the parents informed that their child had worked at the road station in Taroudant, and now armed with this knowledge, police started heavily monitoring the area around the station in order to catch the killer. == Capture == While reviewing their evidence, investigators come across a piece of paper next to the skulls with the name 'Hadi' written on it. Abandoning the surveillance of the road station, they examined all possible leads concerning this 'Hadi', which led them to Naguib Hadi, an employee at the road station. When questioned if he was the only one in the family who worked nearby and had the same surname, Naguib revealed that he had a brother, Abdela\u00e2li, who also worked at the job and lived in Mahatta neighborhood of Taroudant. Accompanied by Naguib, police officers went to Abdela\u00e2li's house and knocked on the door. Much to their surprise, he opened the door and met them with the following statement: \"I have been waiting for you to save me from my torture.\" == Death == On December 11, 2005, after a year-long trial, during which Hadi revealed that he had a 9th victim, the Agadir Court of Appeals issued him a death sentence. He remains on death row. == References == Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century Moroccan criminals Category:Male serial killers Category:Moroccan serial killers Category:Moroccan people convicted of murder Category:Murderers of children Category:People convicted of child sexual abuse Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by Morocco Category:Prisoners and detainees of Morocco Category:Child sexual abuse in Morocco Category:Murder in Morocco Category:2000s in Morocco Category:Taroudant Province ",
