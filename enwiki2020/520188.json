    "text": "Kurt Werner Friedrich Reidemeister (13 October 1893 \u2013 8 July 1971) was a mathematician born in Braunschweig (Brunswick), Germany. ==Life== He was a brother of Marie Neurath. Beginning in 1912, he studied in Freiburg, Munich, Marburg, and G\u00f6ttingen. In 1920, he got the staatsexamen (master's degree) in mathematics, philosophy, physics, chemistry, and geology. He received his doctorate in 1921 with a thesis in algebraic number theory at the University of Hamburg under the supervision of Erich Hecke. He became interested in differential geometry; he edited Wilhelm Blaschke's 2nd volume about that issue,Wilhelm Blaschke, Vorlesungen \u00fcber Differentialgeometrie, Springer, Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften, 1921-1929, vol. 2: Affine Differentialgeometrie and both made an acclaimed contribution to the Jena DMV conference in Sep 1921.Jahresversammlung in Jena vom 18.--25\\. September 1921, Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung, vol.30, p.27-28, 1921 In October 1922 (or 1923) he was appointed assistant professor at the University of Vienna. While there he became familiar with the work of Wilhelm Wirtinger on knot theory, and became closely connected to Hans Hahn and the Vienna Circle. Its manifesto (1929) lists one of Reidemeister's publications in a bibliography of closely related authors. In 1925 he became full professor at University of K\u00f6nigsberg; he stayed until 1933, when he was regarded politically unsound by the Nazis, and dismissed from his chair. Blaschke managed to get a promise about Reidemeister's reappointment, and in autumn 1934 he got the chair of Kurt Hensel in Marburg. He stayed there, except for a visit to the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study in 1948-1950, until he got appointed to G\u00f6ttingen University in 1955, where he stayed until his emeritation. ==Works== Reidemeister's interests were mainly in combinatorial group theory, combinatorial topology, geometric group theory, and the foundations of geometry. His books include Knoten und Gruppen (1926), Einf\u00fchrung in die kombinatorische Topologie (1932), and Knotentheorie (1932). He co-edited the journal Mathematische Annalen from 1947 until 1963.Title page of vol.274 (1986) ==See also== *Reidemeister moves *Reidemeister\u2013Singer theorem *Reidemeister torsion ==References== ==External links== * Category:1893 births Category:1971 deaths Category:20th-century German mathematicians Category:People from Braunschweig Category:Topologists Category:University of Hamburg alumni Category:University of Vienna faculty Category:University of K\u00f6nigsberg faculty Category:Vienna Circle ",
