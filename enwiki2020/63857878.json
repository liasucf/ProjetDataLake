Developed by XADO-Holding Ltd. company (Kharkiv, Ukraine). ==Design== The Snipex \u041c rifle is available in two versions. Snipex \u041c75 has a barrel length of 750 mm, and Snipex \u041c100 \u2014 a barrel length of 1,000 mm. Both versions are designed taking into account all the requirements for weapons for high-precision shooting. The rifles have the bullpup design. The barrel is fully open, has eight right grooves with a 15-inch twist as well as cannelures. Equipped with a muzzle brake. Barrel locking is achieved through a rotating bolt. Thirteen bolt lugs are disposed in three rows and can rotate by 60 degrees, which ensures rigid locking of the barrel. Empty cases are ejected automatically when pulling the bolt back. The case ejection process is slightly delayed, which allows the bullet to leave the barrel with the bolt still fully closed. During this time, the maximum amount of energy is transferred to the bullet. The rifle is equipped with a special grip safety, which is located directly above the pistol grip on both sides of the weapon. The rifle features a number of special design solutions with regard to the reduction of recoil and the increase of shooting accuracy. Recoil reduction is achieved due to the inertia recoil system, which includes spring-loaded assemblies and hydraulic or spring shock absorbers. The shock absorbers are built into the upper receiver, which allows shooting with the upper receiver set against any surface. Recoil energy is partially reduced due to the muzzle brake. The rifle is equipped with an original easily foldable bipod designed in such a way that the center of gravity of the rifle is below the bipod mounting point. During shooting, this provides additional stability and precision. The additional rear support allows for quick adjustment to the shooter's needs. The rifle has a Picatinny rail with 35 MOA gradient, on which various sighting devices can be mounted. ==Specifications== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !! Snipex M75!!
