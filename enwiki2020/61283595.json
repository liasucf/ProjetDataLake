    "text": "The American animated television series Victor and Valentino features a cast created by Diego Molano. The series focuses on half brothers Victor (voiced by Molano) and Valentino (voiced by Sean-Ryan Petersen) who navigate the town of Monte Macabre in search of adventure and get caught in a series of bizarre encounters. They live with their grandmother Chata (voiced by Laura Patalano) while occasionally many of the other residents get involved for one reason or another. ==Main== ===Victor=== Victor Guadalupe Morena Laguna Calaca Calavera is the younger of the two brothers. He wears a blue poncho over a white shirt and has a noticeable gap between his teeth. He is feisty, arrogant, and obnoxious when it comes to taking part in adventures. He would rather slack off and not do anything instead of work, but if possible, he tries to look for an easy way out of doing things. This would often lead to him finding some supernatural object or getting dragged in a paranormal adventure. He is shown to be a very active kid that just wants to have fun while also taking advantage of certain things. Between him and Val, he is the one that typically learns his lesson the most. Deep down, he is afraid of confronting his own flaws and usually needs some coaxing from those around him to acknowledge and accept them. He is also constantly making malapropisms such as referring to himself as \"Victor the Contagious\" when he really means \"Courageous\". This also extends to his writing, where he is shown to be slightly illiterate. He is capable of whistling, but only when Val tickles him. Despite his flaws, Victor has a very strong connection with his family. While he and Val argue over their differences often, he does care for his well being and has come to his rescue every now and then, though not as often as the other way around. Vic has wished a couple of times that he were an only child, only to realize that he would rather have Val around as he is the only one who understands him. He also cares a great deal for his grandma Chata and tries to get her out of harm's way. He has, on occasion, taken advantage of her, though he does not mean any real harm to her and still loves her a great deal. Outside of his family, he is close friends with Miguelito, possibly because of their similar interests. Besides him, Vic's relationship with the other kids shifts between mutual to sometimes antagonistic. The only kids he truly despises are Charlene and Pineapple and is apparently oblivious to the former's crush on him. When things are not too crazy, he does tend to get along with the other children. The only other adult he interacts with is Don Jalape\u00f1o, who he makes fun of. ===Valentino=== Valentino is the older of the two brothers. He is slightly taller than Vic and is somewhat rotund in appearance. He wears a red-orange poncho that covers his entire top half. He is calm, well-disciplined, kind and tends to be the more responsible of the two. While he occasionally is the reason for some of the supernatural occurrences, more often than not, he gets dragged into adventures by Vic. Despite being overweight, he is shown to be physical when he needs to be. He collects things as a hobby and has a habit of trying to keep things clean and organized, implying that he might have OCD. He can be overly confident and sometimes displays a superiority complex, but will become humbled after each strange encounter and will realize when he has gone too far. Val tends to be the more emotional of the brothers and is quick to fall in love or display an attraction towards girls. He is also more artistic than Vic and more appreciative of the simpler things in life. Val is more mature than Vic, but he just wants to have the same enjoyment most kids have. Val cares deeply for his family, despite the issues he might have. While Vic picks on his soft nature, he gets back at him by poking fun at his uncoordinated behavior. He sometimes wishes he were an only child, but at the end of the day, finds himself rescuing his younger brother from the dangers they bring upon themselves. He also adores his grandma Chata and does everything he can to appease her while also trying to refrain from disappointing her in any way. Unlike Vic, Val gets along well with the other kids in Monte Macabre. He mostly hangs out with Isabella, Rosita, Cacao, Guillermo, Reynaldo and Reynalda, all of whom share most of his interests and take part in the various activities that he sets up. He takes his rivalry with Charlene and Pineapple very seriously to the point that he considers it desperate when he chooses to hang out with them. It is implied at one point that he might have a slight crush on Xochi Jalape\u00f1o. He is much more respectful to her father, Don Jalape\u00f1o, but just like his brother, he will mock and prank him just to see him get angry. ===Grandma Chata=== Grandma Chata is Victor and Valentino's partially blind grandmother. She wears a traditional native white dress and has big glasses, despite still not being able to see, and carries a walking cane with her at all times. She is soft- spoken, wise, and keeps the boys in check. She appears to be aware of the things the brothers do around her which she refers to as her \"abuela senses\". However, Chata can be very fierce and harsh at times. Whenever the boys act out of line, Chata will remind them that she is in charge which is comically shown with her opening her eyes and producing fangs in intense anger. She is also shown to be very competitive and aggressive, such as when she wasted no time going to the movies without Vic and Val. She is also shown to be slightly conceited, claiming herself to be beautiful and also having a Quincea\u00f1era every fifteen years just to appease herself. Despite all this, she is shown to be a very caring grandmother who prepares for the well being of her grandsons. The pilot presented her as a spirit that can take human form, while the show only implies her supernatural connections. Chata loves her grandsons equally, though she has shown to favor Val's decisions over Vic as even she sees that Val has more restraint than him. She can be unusually harsh with them, but this is usually so that she can teach them a lesson. Chata mostly interacts with Don Jalape\u00f1o, whom she affectionately calls Julio. She usually ends up \"dating\" him whenever they go out. While it is clear that Don Jalape\u00f1o has a crush on her, it is unknown if it is requited or if she is just being polite with him. Chata despises Maria Teresa, whom she views as her rival and does everything she can to top her. Chata appears to get along well with many of the residents and hardly shows any prejudice. She has convinced Vic and Val to attend Guillermo's party despite his odd behavior and let Sal stay with them even though he was an unruly house guest. Overall, she tends to expect the best out of everyone, except for Maria Teresa. ==Supporting== ===Charlene=== Charlene (voiced by Cristina Milizia) is a strange little girl who lives in Monte Macabre. She is adorned in black, resembling a goth doll, has a large gap between her teeth and unusually large eyeballs that extend past her face. Charlene is a very dark and macabre girl who displays a happy disposition all the time. She hangs out with her brother Pineapple and are both considered Victor and Valentino's rivals. She openly mocks the two, yet is shown to hang out and play with them on occasion. Charlene also has a hidden crush on Vic as she was quick to take part in things he is involved in and blushed heavily when he asked to go to her place and when he called her creepy, which she considers a compliment. She also keeps a personal doll that looks like him. Charlene has connections to the supernatural which she likes to use on the brothers. ===Pineapple=== Pineapple (voiced by Molano) is a large lumbering monosyllabic boy and brother to Charlene. He is bigger than most of the kids in Monte Macabre and has a mohawk. He tends to act as more of a bodyguard or a servant to Charlene and only makes groaning noises and other sounds when necessary. On the side, he takes dance classes and is an expert in wrestling due to his immense size. He also owns a cat caf\u00e9. ===Maria Teresa=== Maria Teresa (voiced by Frankie Qui\u00f1ones) is Charlene and Pineapple's grandmother. Much like how her grandchildren oppose Victor and Valentino, Maria Teresa opposes Grandma Chata and it is implied that the two have had a long heated rivalry throughout most of their lives. Maria Teresa tries to retain her looks and possesses shoulder length black hair, big gaudy glasses and a tight pink dress that mesh with her skinny, grey appearance. She is mean spirited and likes to use her own magical relics for her own selfish uses. She sometimes treats Charlene and Pineapple like her own servants, but other times it is shown that she genuinely cares for them and vice versa. She has allowed them to lay around her extravagant home as she considers them delicate. ===Don Jalape\u00f1o=== Don Julio Jalape\u00f1o (voiced by Jason Hightower) is the owner of the mini-mart in Monte Macabre. He is an overweight man with a big mustache, a red vest and small sombrero. He is always tense about something, especially when it comes to Victor and Valentino who are always the center of strange happenings in town. He keeps a codex full of information on Mexican and Mesoamerican culture and cryptids which he allows the boys to use. He also keeps extensive files of all the inhabitants of Monte Macabre which he refuses to share with anyone. He has a huge crush on Chata, and gets nervous and sweaty around her. He sometimes stress eats while he is talking. ===Xochi Jalape\u00f1o=== Xochi Jalape\u00f1o (voiced by Cristina Vee) is the teenage daughter of Don Jalape\u00f1o. She is a typical, moody teen who does not care much about the going-ons around her. She tends to the mystical plants in the back of her father's store. Despite having a slightly intense relationship with Victor and Valentino, she respects them because she likes seeing them making her father angry. Xochi has a personal life that she does not talk about often. She takes salsa classes and is physically fit as she is able to perform complicated acrobatic maneuvers. Xochi also performs in a band. ==Recurring== ===Monte Macabre=== * Huitzi (voiced by Milizia): A feisty Hummingbird who is Chata's pet.
