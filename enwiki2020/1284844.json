It is the world's longest bridge to have one pylon and one cable-stayed plane. Nov\u00fd most is an asymmetrical cable- stayed bridge with a main span length of , a total length of , a width of , and a weight of . Its steel construction is suspended from steel cables, connected on the Petr\u017ealka side to two pillars. There are four lanes for motor traffic on the upper level and lanes for bicycles and pedestrians on the lower level. ==History== Since its construction in 1972 the bridge was called Most SNP (\"Bridge of the Slovak National Uprising\"), although locally it was called New Bridge. In 1993, its name was changed by the Bratislava City Council to Nov\u00fd Most (\"New Bridge\") to unify its official name with that actually used by the people, as it was the second bridge to be built over Danube river in the city. However, another three bridges have been constructed since its opening, and on 29 March 2012 members of the Bratislava City Council voted in favor of an initiative by the Mayor of Old Town T\u00e1\u0148a Rosov\u00e1 (SDK\u00da-DS) to change the bridge's name back to Most SNP, effective 29 August 2012, the day of 68th anniversary of Slovak National Uprising. The bridge was built between 1967 and 1972 under a project managed by A. Tes\u00e1r, J. Lacko, and I. Slame\u0148.http://slovakia.travel/en/bratislava-ufo-classed-one-of-the-craziest- places It officially opened on August 26, 1972, as the second bridge over the Danube in Bratislava. A significant section of the Old Town below Bratislava Castle, which included nearly all of the Jewish quarter, was demolished to create the roadway that led to it;http://spectator.sme.sk/articles/view/53370/8/the_changing_face_of_bratislava.html on the other hand, the bridge improved access between Petr\u017ealka and the rest of the city. Parts of the historical city walls were unearthed during construction. == Restaurant and observation deck == A special attraction is the flying saucer-shaped structure atop the bridge's pylon, housing an observation deck and a restaurant, which since 2005 has been called UFO (previously, Bystrica). The restaurant serves both traditional Slovak and international cuisine, describing its cuisine as \"Mediterasian\".Savitie, Ilona: Suomalainen matkaopas: Slovakia, p. 64. It received the Restaurant of the Year award in 2011.UFO fact sheet Both the restaurant and the observation deck offer panoramic views of Bratislava. They are reached using lifts located in the east pillar, accessed from the walking and cycling paths on either side of the bridge. Access to the lifts normally costs \u20ac7.40 as of November 2017, but this fee is deducted from the bill for restaurant guests. The west pillar of the bridge tower houses an emergency staircase with 430 stairs. == Gallery == File:Bridge_Nov\u00fd_most_-_Bratislava.jpg|View of the pylon and \"UFO\" File:Most SNP v BRATISLAVE - panoramio.jpg|Close-up of the bridge's pylon and the \"flying saucer\" from below File:Bratislava Panorama R01.jpg|Bratislava Castle and St. Martin's Cathedral, as seen from Most SNP File:Restaurace, Nov\u00fd most, Bratislava.JPG|A daytime view of the restaurant's interior File:Interior of restaurant UFO, Bratislava, Slovakia.jpg|The interior of the restaurant at night File:Bratislava - Most SNP - panoramio.jpg|Panoramic view of the bridge at night == See also == * List of crossings of the Danube River * List of Towers * History of Bratislava ==References== ==External links== *UFO Restaurant * *New Bridge *Panoramic view of Novy Most bridge & River Danube Category:Bridges over the Danube Category:Buildings and structures in Bratislava Category:Cable-stayed bridges in Slovakia Category:20th-century architecture in Slovakia Category:Bridges completed in 1972 Category:Observation towers in Slovakia Category:Transport in Bratislava Category:Inclined towers Category:Restaurant towers Category:Restaurants in Slovakia ",
