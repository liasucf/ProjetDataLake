    "text": "Between 1997 and 1999 the international Cape Roberts Project (CRP) has recovered up to long drill cores in the Ross Sea, Antarctica to reconstruct the glaciation history of Antarctica. Scientists from various institutes in seven countries have participated: Australia, Germany, United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Italy, New Zealand, and USA. After a seismic pre-site survey the area off Cape Roberts in the Ross Sea at the margin of the Transantarctic Mountains (77\u00b0S 163\u00b043'E) was found to be suitable. Drilling was performed using a conventional core wireline system with a drill derrick, protected by a cover against the rough climate. Sea ice was thick with a water depth of below. Four overlapping drill cores at three sites reflect in excellent quality the geological history and glaciation of the Antarctic during the last 34 million years. As a logistic and scientific basis the American McMurdo Station and Scott Base of New Zealand were used. Supply of the drill site was performed with motor sledges and snow mobiles, exchange of personal with helicopters. The costs for the logistics were around four Million US dollar. ==See also== * List of Antarctic field camps ==Gallery== Image:CRP_barrett_hg.jpg|Peter Barrett, chief scientist Image:CRP_derrick_hg.jpg|CRP drill derrick on sea ice Image:CRP_logo_hg.jpg|CRP Logo ==References== * Peter J.
