    "text": "Eleny-Nicoleta Ionel is a Romanian mathematician whose research concerns symplectic geometry, including the study of the Gromov\u2013Witten invariants and Gopakumar\u2013Vafa invariant. Among her most significant results are the construction of relative Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic manifolds, and the proof of the vanishing in codimension at least g of the tautological ring of the moduli space of genus-g curves. She is a professor of mathematics at Stanford University, where she is chair of the mathematics department. ==Education and career== Ionel is from Ia\u0219i. She is the daughter of Adrian Ionel, a professor at the Ion Ionescu de la Brad University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Ia\u0219i. She attended the Costache Negruzzi National College, graduating in 1987. She earned a bachelor's degree from Alexandru Ioan Cuza University in 1991, and completed her Ph.D. in 1996 from Michigan State University. Her dissertation, Genus One Enumerative Invariants in \\mathbf{P}^n, was supervised by Thomas H. Parker. After postdoctoral research at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California and a position as C. L. E. Moore instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she joined the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison faculty in 1998, and moved to Stanford in 2004. ==Recognition== Ionel is a Sloan Research Fellow and a Simons Fellow. She was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2002. She was selected as a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in the 2020 Class, for \"contributions to symplectic geometry and the geometric analysis approach to Gromov\u2013Witten Theory\". ==Selected publications== * * * * ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:20th-century Romanian mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:Alexandru Ioan Cuza University alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison faculty Category:Stanford University faculty Category:Michigan State University alumni Category:20th-century women mathematicians Category:21st-century women mathematicians Category:21st- century Romanian mathematicians Category:Sloan Research Fellows Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:People from Ia\u0219i Category:Costache Negruzzi National College alumni ",
