    "text": "JJ Appleton, born Jon Jason Appleton, is an American musician and singer- songwriter based in New York City who has toured throughout the United States extensively in support of his own records and also with other bands including Jamie Cullum, Newton Faulkner, Pete Yorn, Edwin McCain, Sister Hazel, Joan Osborne, Keb Mo, Hootie and the Blowfish. Appleton has been described by the Washington Post as a songwriter with a \"pop-rock sound but with considerably more edgy energy, adding figurative lightning to the stormy night.\" Previously a member of the popular New York band The Grasshoppers, Appleton released his first solo album 500 Moments in 2003 which led to appearances on the NBC television show Last Call with Carson Daly, a feature on E!'s Wild On, and a national affiliation with Budweiser's True Music Live program and Gibson Guitars. Appleton released his album Uphill to Purgatory in the United States in 2005 which was then re-released in the United Kingdom in 2006 as Someone Else's Problem and included three songs from the 500 Moments EP. Based on the recognition he was receiving in England, Appleton decided to move to London in 2006 where he became a regularly featured performer at popular venues such as Ronnie Scott's, The Borderline, and The Regal Room. In the meantime, the single \"Walk Into The Room\" and its accompanying video became a favorite on English radio and MTV Two. In 2015, Appleton released an acoustic blues album entitled \"Dirty Memory\" with harmonicist Jason Ricci. == Early life == Appleton was born in Norwich, Vermont, on April 4, 1967, the son of Georganna Towne and Jon H. Appleton, a composer and professor of electro-acoustic music at Dartmouth College. Professor Appleton was also one of the co-inventors of the Synclavier digital music synthesizer and recording system, which JJ would later use as a producer in New York City to record his own and other artists' music. In his capacity as a performer and a teacher, Jon Appleton was able to bring his family with him around the world where they would sometimes live for extended periods of time.\"Wherever the Appletons went, Jon had a musical agenda, which afforded JJ the rare opportunity to immerse himself in the indigenous music of such exotic places as Tonga, Sweden, Israel and Turkey.\" Of his Mother's support for his developing interest in music, JJ has said, \"She definitely encouraged my musical pursuits. She would tape record me singing twenty minute songs about Viking battles and spaghetti when I was 6\". == Early career == While attending Berklee College of Music in Boston, Appleton met and played in several bands including a stint with the power funk outfit Hamhorta and the band Electric Jellyfish. Appleton's primary instrument was guitar and as a developing guitarist, Appleton was a fan of Albert King, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Johnny Winter. During this time, he wrote and recorded a considerable amount of original material that reflected his respect for and developing mastery of the blues guitar and singing styles of these artists. Upon moving to New York City in the early 1990s, Appleton worked at producer Mike Thorne's Synclavier-based recording studio as an engineer and Synclavier programmer where he continued to develop his skills on records by Betty, Information Society, and Peter Murphy. == Work as songwriter, composer, music consultant and producer == Appleton has co-written, produced and performed on songs for a wide range of performers, including Jimmy Sommerville, China Crisis, Stephen Schwartz, Farrad, Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas, Luan Parle, Ke$ha, Darius Rucker, Ben Adams/A1, Pebe Sebert, Marc Copely, Ashford & Simpson, Stephen Lironi, Erin Bowman, and David Wolfert. He has composed and performed music for numerous television programs and films, including Jungle Junction, Ten Days That Unexpectedly Changed America, PBS's P.O.V., The Wire, The Sopranos, The Oprah Winfrey Show, Real World Cancun, Real World Washington DC, The Regis and Kathie Lee Show, and Lizzie McGuire. He may be best known to Millennials for singing the Pokemon: Advanced Generation series\u2019 theme song. As a music consultant, Appleton has been featured at music industry meetups, teaching advertising, TV, and film composition. Appleton's career as a jingle writer has spanned over 15 years, and his compositions can be heard in television commercials for Diet Coke, Burger King, McDonald's, Time Warner Cable, BMW, Singulair, Levitra, IBM, Clairol, Maybelline Cosmetics, Budweiser, 7-up, American Express, Procter and Gamble, and Campbell's Soup. == Collaboration with Jason Ricci == In 2014/2015, Appleton teamed up with Grammy Award-winning harmonica player and singer Jason Ricci to record an Acoustic blues album entitled \"Dirty Memory,\" which Appleton also produced. Hailed as \"keeping the tradition of Piedmont blues alive\" and \"a killer, wild man of a set that almost sounds like early Holy Modal Rounders played straight,\" the album spent 10 weeks on the Roots Music Report's Top 50 Acoustic Blues Albums chart. Six of the tracks from \"Dirty Memory\" dominated the Top 10 Acoustic Blues Singles chart in the autumn of 2015, and in November 2015 \"Dirty Memory\" was given the 2015 Jimi Award for \"best new artist debut\" by Blues 411. == Tours and notable appearances == Appleton has toured the United States and UK extensively and has worked as a session musician/band leader with members of Gov't Mule, Tedeschi Trucks, Black Crowes, Lenny Kravitz, The Spin Doctors, and John Scofield bands.
