Doukas Gaitatzis () also known under the nom de guerre as Captain Zervas was a significant Greek chieftain of the Macedonian Struggle. == Biography == Doukas Gaitatzis Doukas was born in 1879 in Serres, to one of the richest families of the area. In 1900, he joined the Macedonian Defense and collaborated with the Greek Consul of Serres, Ioannis Stournaras. He became an agent and informant of the National Center of Serres, trying to limit the early terrorist activity of the Bulgarian komitadjis. After a failed attempt to exterminate the Bulgarian agent Stoyan in Rahovitsa (now Marmaras), he was forced to flee to Athens, where he met with Georgios Tsontos. He arrived in Western Macedonia in 1904 as a deputy in the armed group of Georgios Katechakis (Captain Rouvas) along with Dimitrios Dalipis and Simos Ioannidis. He soon assumed command of guerrilla forces operating throughout Western Macedonia and in the Giannitsa area. In 1905, head of an armed group of 20 people, he moved his area of activity to Eastern Macedonia. There he managed to confront the Bulgarian komitadjis and participated in various battles in the areas of Amphipolis, Nea Zichni, Nevrokop (now Gotse Delchev, Sintice and Pangaion Hills.
