He left the music industry to write full-time in 2002 and published Music from Big Pink, a book about The Band\u2019s album of the same name, in 2005 (Continuum Press). The book was optioned for the screen by CC Films with a script has been written by English playwright Jez Butterworth. Niven's breakthrough novel Kill Your Friends is a satire of the music business, based on his brief career in A&R;, during which he passed up the chance to sign Coldplay and Muse. The novel was published by William Heinemann in 2008 to much acclaim, with Word magazine describing it as \"possibly the best British Novel since Trainspotting\". It has been translated into seven languages and was a bestseller in Britain and Germany. Niven has since published The Amateurs (2009), The Second Coming (2011), Cold Hands (2012), Straight White Male (2013), The Sunshine Cruise Company (2015) and Kill 'em All (2018). He also writes original screenplays with writing partner Nick Ball, the younger brother of British TV presenter Zo\u00eb Ball. His journalistic contributions to newspapers and magazines include a monthly column for Q magazine, entitled \"London Kills Me\". In 2009 Niven wrote a controversial article for The Independent newspaper where he attacked the media's largely complacent coverage of Michael Jackson's death. In 2005 he co-wrote the lyrics of two songs on James Dean Bradfield's album The Great Western. Niven co-wrote the screenplay How to Build a Girl, opposite Caitlin Moran, based upon her novel of the same name, which will be directed by Coky Giedroyc. An atheist and a republican, Niven refuses to sing God Save the Queen on ideological grounds. ==Bibliography== * Music from Big Pink: A Novella (33 1/3) (2005) * 'Kill Your Friends' (2008) * The Amateurs (2009) * The Second Coming (2011) * Cold Hands (2012) * Straight White Male (2013) * The Sunshine Cruise Company (2015) * No Good Deed (2017, ) * Kill 'Em All \u2014 sequel to Kill Your Friends (2018, * The F*ck-it List (2020, ) Amazon Link to his 2020 book https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dad-Impaler-John-Niven/dp/0434023264 . ==Filmography== * How to Build a Girl - Screenwriter * Superviszed (2018) - Screenwriter * Kill Your Friends (2015) - Screenwriter * Cat Run (2011) - Screenwriter == References == == External links == *Author page on Penguin * https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/kill-your- friends-by-john-niven-780982.html * https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jan/31/kill-your-friends-review *Interview in Shotsmag Ezine July 2012 Category:1968 births Category:Scottish writers Category:Living people Category:21st-century Scottish novelists Category:Scottish screenwriters Category:Scottish male novelists Category:Alumni of the University of Glasgow Category:21st-century British male writers Category:Scottish atheists Category:21st-century British screenwriters ",
