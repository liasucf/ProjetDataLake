    "text": "Endless Wire is the Canadian singer Gordon Lightfoot's thirteenth original album, released in 1978 on Warner Bros. Records (#3149). Although the album continued in the musical and writing style of Summertime Dream (1976), it marked the beginning of the end of Lightfoot's commercial success as a recording artist, although he remained both a prolific songwriter and popular as a live act. The closing track, The Circle is Small, was a re-recording of a song from Lightfoot's fourth album, Back Here on Earth (1968). In the USA, Endless Wire peaked at #22 on the Billboard pop chart and #14 on the country chart. \"The Circle is Small\" peaked at #3 on the adult contemporary chart, #33 on the pop chart and #92 on the country chart. It reached #1 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart. \"Dreamland\" peaked at #100 on the country chart. \"Daylight Katy\" reached #16 on the adult contemporary chart and also charted in the UK at #41. ==Track listing== All songs written and composed by Gordon Lightfoot. #\"Daylight Katy\" \u2013 4:18 #\"Sweet Guinevere\" \u2013 3:16 #\"Hangdog Hotel Room\" \u2013 2:35 #\"If There's a Reason\" \u2013 4:52 #\"Endless Wire\" \u2013 4:07 #\"Dreamland\" \u2013 2:53 #\"Songs the Minstrel Sang\" \u2013 2:49 #\"Sometimes I Don't Mind\" \u2013 2:53 #\"If Children Had Wings\" \u2013 3:50 #\"The Circle Is Small (I Can See It in Your Eyes)\" \u2013 4:03 ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
