He has had several one-man shows in London, and has exhibited at the Singer and Friedlander Exhibition several times, and also at the Discerning Eye Competition at the Mall Galleries, winning the main \u00a33,000 ING Purchase Prize in 2002. In 1997, an exhibition of Wolstenholme's work was shown in New York City at the \"Works on Paper\" fair. Wolstenholme is known for his amazingly detailed works deriving from a love of old books and of the paraphernalia associated with a bygone age whose hallmarks were finely skilled labour and exquisite craftsmanship in the production of all manner of objects. In 2017, his work has sold at Christie's auction house, as part of The Astor Collection from Tillypronie, Aberdeenshire, which The Daily Telegraph described as \"the best collection\" of sporting art \"that will ever come on to the market\". ==Illustrated works== *An Old Fashioned Christmas by Iris Grender (Hutchinson, 1979) *The Diary of Samuel Pepys (Haffmann, 2011) *Alice in Wonderland (Haffmann, 2012) *Grimms Fairy Tales ==Personal life== Wolstenholme is married, with two children, and lives in London. ==References== ==External links== *Personal website *Portal Gallery Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from London Category:British illustrators Category:Alumni of Croydon College ",
