After graduating from Texas Tech University in 1970 with a BFA in painting, he received an MFA from the University of Utah in 1972. There, his interest in painting waned in favor of ceramics. In 1988, he settled in San Antonio, Texas, and his interests shifted to bronze animal masks. Little later shifted to steel sculpture, animal forms constructed from discarded shoes and human forms decoupaged with American paper money. Fury, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art is an example of this stage in the artist's work.
