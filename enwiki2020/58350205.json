    "text": "Robert Ignatius Letellier (born 1953, in Durban, South Africa) is a cultural historian and a writer on the history of music, Romantic literature and the Bible. He received a doctorate in English Romanticism from the University of Salzburg and has published more than one hundred articles and books on subjects including the Bible, eighteenth and nineteenth century novels, especially the works of Sir Walter Scott, and 19th-century music. Letellier is particularly noted for scholarship on the life and works of the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer. Letellier's four-volume translation of the composer's diaries has been cited as \"the most important work on the composer to be published in English to date\". He has also published several studies of the composer's operas and other works which have played an important part in the revaluation of Meyerbeer, the most popular composer of the 19th century, whose works fell into almost complete neglect in the 20th but are now being rediscovered. ==Select bibliography== As editor and translator: * As author: * The English Novel, 1660-1700: An Annotated Bibliography, Greenwood Publishing Group 1997. *The Operas of Giacomo Meyerbeer, Madison, New Jersey: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press 2006. . *The Ballets of Ludwig Minkus, Cambridge Scholars Publishing 2008. . *An Introduction to the Dramatic Works of Giacomo Meyerbeer: Operas, Ballets, Cantatas, Plays, Routledge 2008. *Opera-Comique: A Sourcebook, Cambridge Scholars Publishing 2010. . *Daniel-Fran\u00e7ois-Esprit Auber: The Man and His Music, Cambridge Scholars Publishing 2010. . * Meyerbeer's Les Huguenots: An Evangel of Religion and Love, Cambridge Scholars Publishing 2014.. *Operetta: A Sourcebook I and II, Cambridge Scholars Publishing 2015. . *The Bible in Music, Cambridge Scholars Publishing 2017. . *Giacomo Meyerbeer: A Critical Life and Iconography, Cambridge Scholars Publishing 2018. . == References == Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:People from Durban Category:Music historians Category:South African literary critics Category:South African historians Category:20th- century historians Category:20th-century South African male writers Category:21st-century historians Category:21st-century South African male writers Category:University of Salzburg alumni ",
