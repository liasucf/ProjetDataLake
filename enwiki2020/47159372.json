The greater part of her youth was spent in Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b and Napajedla, where in 1896 she married a railway clerk named Josef Bene\u0161. In 1908 she and her husband moved to Prague. ==Life== Bene\u0161ov\u00e1 and her husband divorced in 1912 but continued living together until his death in 1933. Her friendship with the writer R\u016f\u017eena Svobodov\u00e1, whom she met in 1902 in Fren\u0161t\u00e1t pod Radho\u0161t\u011bm, had a tremendous influence on her life. Svobodov\u00e1 helped Bene\u0161ov\u00e1 to overcome a resigned melancholia after the wedding and supported her as a writer. The friends corresponded prolifically, Svobodov\u00e1 visited Bene\u0161ov\u00e1 in Moravia, and they traveled together to Italy (e.g., in 1903 and in 1907). Their friendship lasted until Svobodov\u00e1's death in 1920. Svobodov\u00e1 had had the effect of a disciplinarian on Bene\u0161ov\u00e1 (as she had earlier had on actress/writer Hana Kvapilov\u00e1), overseeing that she read and write daily and compelling her to finish her manuscripts. Svobodov\u00e1 introduced Bene\u0161ov\u00e1 to Franti\u0161ek Xaver \u0160alda, a Francophilic Czech literary critic who would have profound national influence during the interwar period and who is now viewed as the founder of modern Czech criticism. According to Marcel Cornis-Pope and John Neubauer, \"The novelist Marie Pujmanov\u00e1, who was a fairly close friend of Bene\u0161ov\u00e1's after the Great War, relates that young Bene\u0161ov\u00e1 had enthusiastically read Dostoyevsky and Maupassant, but that, under the guidance of F. X. \u0160alda, she came to admire Flaubert even more.\"Cornis-Pope, M., & Neubauer, J., History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and Disjunctures in the 19th and 20th Centuries (Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2004), p. 354. On their second trip to Italy, in 1907, they were accompanied by the renowned Czech poet, essayist, leader of the Realist movement and master of colloquial Czech Josef Svatopluk Machar. In 1907 and 1908 Benesova edited the supplement \"Woman in Arts\" in the newspaper Female Revue (\"a resource for women's issues, ethnicity, culture and society\"). This experience opened doors to future collaborations with other magazines, e.g., Masaryk's New Era. At this point in 1908 the family resolved to move from Moravia to Prague. During the war years, 1914\u201318, Bene\u0161ov\u00e1 completed two books of short stories, Mice and Cruel Youth, and set to work on her largest literary work, the two-part novel A Human Being. In 1926 she commenced work as a secretary and librarian at the German YWCA where she eventually headed a summer camp, the starting point of her financial security. Bene\u0161ov\u00e1 was very popular with the young women at YWCA, who formed an inner group called the \"Bo\u017eena Bene\u0161ov\u00e1 girls.\" (A decade later, when she was gravely ill, it was to these same Bo\u017eena Bene\u0161ov\u00e1 girls that she dictated the final chapter of her final work Don Pablo, Don Pedro and V\u011bra Luk\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1.) From 1932 onward Bene\u0161ov\u00e1 was a regular member of the Czech Academy of Arts and Sciences.Members of the Czech Academy of Arts and Sciences, 1890\u20131952, p. 39. She died on April 8, 1936 in her Prague-Bubene\u010d home and is interred beside her companion / erstwhile husband Josef Bene\u0161 at the neighborhood cemetery H\u0159bitovn\u00ed spr\u00e1va Bubene\u010d. During the remainder of the 1930s the feverishly inventive polymath Emil Franti\u0161ek Burian, a well-known exponent of the Dev\u011btsil (or Svaz modern\u00ed kultury Dev\u011btsil) Czech avant-garde association in the 1920s, produced and directed a film adaptation of Bene\u0161ov\u00e1's swansong novel, which premiered as Vera Luk\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1 in 1939, starring Ji\u0159ina Str\u00e1nsk\u00e1 in the title role.Reittererova, V., \"E. F. Burian: Sweep the Stage!\", Czech Music, No. 4, October 2004. A 1962 edition of the same novel, Don Pablo, Don Pedro and V\u011bra Luk\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1\u2014and other stories, included the posthumous short story \"Pov\u00eddka s dobr\u00fdm koncem\" (A Story with a Happy Ending), which in 1986 was adapted as a TV movie for \u010cesk\u00e1 televize featuring Ivana Ch\u00fdlkov\u00e1, Vlasta Fialov\u00e1, Radovan Lukavsk\u00fd, Old\u0159ich Navr\u00e1til, Jaroslav Du\u0161ek and Stanislav Zindulka.Pov\u00eddka s dobr\u00fdm koncem, \u010cesk\u00e1 televize. ==Work== Don Pablo, Don Pedro and V\u011bra Luk\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1 (1936) By and large, Bene\u0161ov\u00e1's characters are young people from small towns who experience an inner struggle with loneliness and selfishness. Following in Bene\u0161ov\u00e1's footsteps were a bevy of younger writers such as Marie Majerov\u00e1 and Marie Pujmanov\u00e1. After Bene\u0161ov\u00e1's death, the literary critic Paul Buzkov\u00e1 became the first editor of her work.Cornis-Pope & Neubauer, ibid., pp. 637-38. ===Poetry collections=== * Verse True and Untrue (1909) * Verse (1938) ===Novels=== * A Human Being (1919\u201320), a novel in two parts * The Blow (1926), Pt. 1 of the \u00dader trilogy * Underground Flames (1929), Pt. 2 of the \u00dader trilogy * Rainbow of Tragedy (1933), Pt. 3 of the \u00dader trilogy * Don Pablo, Don Pedro and V\u011bra Luk\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1 (1936) ===Short story collections=== * Three Tales (1914) * Mice: Tales from 1909-13 (1916) * Cruel Youth (1917) * Silent Girls (1922) * The Beguiled: A Book of Stories (1923) * Boys: Stories about Children (1927) ===Plays=== * Dramas (1937), including \"Bitter Drink,\" \"Clairvoyant\" and \"Golden Sheep\" ==Film and television adaptations== * Vera Luk\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1 (1939), dir.
