There has been indisputable evidence that the UN is the proximate cause for bringing cholera to Haiti. Peacekeepers sent to Haiti from Nepal were carrying asymptomatic cholera and they did not treat their waste properly before dumping it into Haiti's water stream. When asked if Haitian cholera victims should be compensated, Ms. Pusic initially indicated that they should be, but then said the question should be studied further by expert panels; \"it has been studied for years, and the United Nations has claimed immunity from prosecution.\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/world/un-secretary-general- candidates-ban-ki-moon.html?_r=1 Another issue that has been brought up is the sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers. This gross problem was brought to light after Anders Kompass exposed the sexual assault of children by peacekeepers in the Central African Republic. She was asked about her stance on peacekeepers' accountability during the UN Secretary General informal dialogues. Palestine, the United Kingdom, and the United States all asked about how she would tackle the issue of sexual abuse by peacekeepers. Pusi\u0107 repeatedly referred to the three reports that have addressed peacekeeping SEA, citing that she would follow and implement much of the same principles.http://webtv.un.org/search/vesna-pusi%C4%87-croatia-informal- dialogue-for-the-position-of-the-next-un-secretary- general/4844480656001?term=informal%20dialogue&languages;=&sort;=date For one, she stated that peacekeepers who have committed atrocities against their people should not be allowed to serve as peacekeepers within a certain number of years. She also emphasized a strong command structure and a faster reporting and processing of cases. Pusi\u0107 participated in the UN debate that was held on 12 July 2016. On the question of the Hungarian ambassador to the UN concerning which way of leadership is needed by the UN and the world, Pusi\u0107 replied that standards have dropped in the past 20 years, stating that \"phrases and lack of accountability are currently very popular. I believe that we do not want leadership that is based on platitudes and speaking only what people want to hear.\", adding that today's leaders need vision, persistence and courage. She stated that she wanted to be Secretary-General because the UN topics of peace, human rights and development have taken center stage throughout her life. When commenting on the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), she stated that the court wasn't perfect, but that it would have been much worse without it, adding that it sent an important message; \"If you commit a war crime, you will be caught.\" Pusi\u0107 expressed her concern about the wave of cynicism in current national and international politics. In addition, she stated that being a female candidate was important, and noted that the UN had been dominated for 50 years by men. After receiving 11 'discourage' votes on a first informal closed-door straw poll of the 15-member UN Security Council that was held on 21 July 2016, Pusi\u0107 decided on 4 August 2016 to withdraw from the race and focus on the 2016 extraordinary parliamentary elections.http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/vesna-pusic-odustala-od- kandidature-za-seficu-una-moje-sanse-za-izbor-nisu- realne/910645.aspxWithdrawal of candidature of Vesna Pusi\u0107, 4 August 2016 ==Activism== Vesna Pusi\u0107 is very popular in the Croatian LGBT community.
