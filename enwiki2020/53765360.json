    "text": "The Tata Tigor is a subcompact sedan manufactured by Tata Motors in India based on the Tata Tiago hatchback. It was launched in India in March 2017. ==History== The Tata Tigor was born directly from the same project that originated the Tata Tiago (internally called Kite 5) as it represents the four-door sedan version with a third rear volume. The Kite project was born in 2013 with the aim of developing two new compact cars, modern and inexpensive to offer on the Indian market in place of the Tata Zest and Bolt models that did not have the desired success as they were nothing but the profound restyling of the previous Indica Vista and Indigo Manza. In particular, Tigor replaces the Tata Zest. Compared to the Zest the Tata Tigor is slightly shorter than a few millimeters, and even the pace measures only two millimeters less, the overall length is 3.994 meters as in India the cars that fall within the 4 meters limit enjoy tax breaks. The defects that manifested the old Zest were the rather small trunk with a capacity of only 370 liters and limited opening due to the rear lamps too intrusive. The Tigor instead offers a 419 liters trunk and the size of the rear lights have been reduced as well as being divided into two elements (on the Zest the headlight was in one piece). This large boot has been made possible, due to the presence of hinghes, near the boot opening. Moreover, the Tigor has a fastback\u2013like styling and as a result, the boot opening has been made much larger. The official presentation of Tigor takes place at Auto Expo 2016 in pre-production version with still the design name Kite 5, while only in 2017 is the official Tigor name announced for the model and consequently the official production starts with sales instead of start in March of the same year on the Indian market. Like the Tata Tiago, also Tigor uses the Tata X1 platform, re- engineered respect to the old platform version used by Indica and later by Bolt. The wheelbase compared to the Tiago is stretched by 5 centimeters to increase the rear habitability. The Tigor is front-wheel drive, the suspension uses a very classic scheme: MacPherson front end with stabilizer bar, wheeled rear axle with twist bridge. Front disc and rear drum brakes. The engine range consists of the petrol 1.2-liter Revotron three-cylinder 12V that delivers 85 horsepower and 114 Nm of maximum torque with a 5-speed manual transmission or 5-speed automatic and a diesel 1.1-liter Revotorq three-cylinder common rail 70 horsepower 12V delivering 140 Nm of maximum torque, combined with a 5-speed manual transmission. Like Tiago, Tigor is produced only with right-hand drive and is not expected to be imported into Europe. === JTP version === In October 2018, Tata launched a sporty Tigor JTP along with Tata Tiago JTP. The 1.2 liter turbocharged Revotron petrol engine is tuned to deliver 112 horsepower and 150 Nm of peak torque. Tata has a claimed 0-100 km/h in 10 seconds. == Facelift == In October 2018, Tata Motors launched the facelifted version of Tigor. The major changes concern in the front headlights and the grille as well as new chrome, new colours for the seats and alloy wheels. Internally, it equips a new 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay compatibility. == Tigor EV== In October 2019, Tata Motors has launched the Tigor EV for private owners. It has an extended the range from 142 km to 213 km on a single charge according to ARAI certification. It is reported that the Tigor EV will be the cheapest electric car available for commercial buyers. ==References== 9\\. www.ardwheels.com ^\"Tata Tigor Global NCAP ratings\".Retrieved at 6th April 2020. ==External links== *Official Tata Tigor Website Category:Cars introduced in 2017 Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Sedans Category:Subcompact cars Tigor ",
