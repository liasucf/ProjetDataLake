But, a fire following a testing crash for Wiegand made Lappi the champion by default.http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/116617 Lappi, pleased to have been crowned the newest European Rally Champion before the event had even begun, was hoping to add to his tally of wins. It was not to be, though, as the Finn crashed on Stage 6, ending his rally. Ex-Formula 1 driver St\u00e9phane Sarrazin led the majority of the rally, having won most of the stages to take a dominating win, ahead of his compatriot Bryan Bouffier. This was the second time this year a Formula One driver had won in the ERC as Robert Kubica had won the season-opening Internationale J\u00e4nner Rallye. Vitaliy Pushkar was crowned ERC Production Cup champion after the withdrawals of his nearest rivals Keith Cronin and Martin Hudec. Andrea Crugnola won the Junior class but this wasn't enough to stop St\u00e9phane Lefebvre from clinching the title, while Zolt\u00e1n Bessenyey retained the 2WD title. Eric Camilli also received the McRae Flat Out Award for the first time. ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\" ! Pos ! No ! Driver ! Co-driver ! Entrant ! Car ! Time/Retired !
