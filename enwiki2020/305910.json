    "text": "Eduardo Hughes Galeano (; 3 September 1940 \u2013 13 April 2015) was a Uruguayan journalist, writer and novelist considered, among other things, \"global soccer's pre-eminent man of letters\" and \"a literary giant of the Latin American left\". Galeano's best-known works are Las venas abiertas de Am\u00e9rica Latina (Open Veins of Latin America, 1971) and Memoria del fuego (Memory of Fire Trilogy, 19826). \"I'm a writer,\" the author once said of himself, \"obsessed with remembering, with remembering the past of America and above all that of Latin America, intimate land condemned to amnesia.\" Author Isabel Allende, who said her copy of Galeano's book was one of the few items with which she fled Chile in 1973 after the military coup of Augusto Pinochet, called Open Veins of Latin America, \"a mixture of meticulous detail, political conviction, poetic flair, and good storytelling.\" ==Life== Eduardo Germ\u00e1n Mar\u00eda Hughes Galeano was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, on Sept. 3, 1940. His two family names were inherited from Welsh and Italian (from Genoa) great- grandfathers; the other two were from Germany and Spain.. Galeano wrote under his maternal family name; as young man, he briefly wrote for a Uruguayan socialist publication, El Sol, signing articles as \"Gius,\" \"a pseudonym approximating the pronunciation in Spanish of his paternal surname Hughes.\"Simon Romero, \"Eduardo Galenao, Uruguayan Voice of Anti-Capitalism, Is Dead at 74,\" New York Times, 14 April 2015, A17. Galeano's family belonged to the fallen Uruguayan aristocracy; Galeano himself went to work at fourteen, having completed just two years of secondary school. He started his career as a journalist in the early 1960s as editor of Marcha, an influential weekly journal which had such contributors as Mario Vargas Llosa, Mario Benedetti, Manuel Maldonado Denis and Roberto Fern\u00e1ndez Retamar. For two years he edited the daily \u00c9poca and worked as editor-in-chief of the University Press. In 1959 he married his first wife, Silvia Brando, and in 1962, having divorced, he remarried to Graciela Berro.. In 1973, a military coup took power in Uruguay; Galeano was imprisoned and later was forced to flee, going into exile in Argentina where he founded the magazine Crisis.Romero, \"Eduardo Galeano,\" His book Open Veins of Latin America was banned by the right-wing military government, not only in Uruguay, but also in Chile and Argentina.Fresh Off Worldwide Attention for Joining Obama\u2019s Book Collection, Uruguayan Author Eduardo Galeano Returns with \"Mirrors: Stories of Almost Everyone\". In 1976 he married for the third time to Helena Villagra; however, in the same year, the Videla regime took power in Argentina in a bloody military coup and his name was added to the list of those condemned by the death squads. He fled again, this time to Spain, where he wrote his famous trilogy, Memoria del fuego (Memory of Fire), described as \"the most powerful literary indictment of colonialism in the Americas.\". Galeano in 1984 At the beginning of 1985 Galeano returned to Montevideo when democratization occurred. Following the victory of Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez and the Broad Front alliance in the 2004 Uruguayan elections marking the first left-wing government in Uruguayan history Galeano wrote a piece for The Progressive titled \"Where the People Voted Against Fear\" in which Galeano showed support for the new government and concluded that the Uruguayan populace used \"common sense\" and were \"tired of being cheated\" by the traditional Colorado and Blanco parties.Eduardo Galeano, \"Where the People Voted Against Fear\" January 2005 The Progressive Following the creation of TeleSUR, a Latin American television station based in Caracas, Venezuela, in 2005 Galeano along with other left-wing intellectuals such as Tariq Ali and Adolfo P\u00e9rez Esquivel joined the network's 36 member advisory committee.Alfonso Daniels, \"'Chavez TV' beams into South America\",The Guardian, 26 July 2005. On February 10, 2007, Galeano underwent a successful operation to treat lung cancer.Eduardo Galeano se recupera de operaci\u00f3n El Universal, 11 February 2007 During an interview with journalist Amy Goodman following Barack Obama's election as President of the United States in November 2008, Galeano said, \"The White House will be Barack Obama's house in the time coming, but this White House was built by black slaves. And I\u2019d like, I hope, that he never, never forgets this\".Interview with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now!, 5 November 2008 (video, audio, and print transcript) At the 17 April 2009 opening session of the 5th Summit of the Americas held in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez gave a Spanish- language copy of Galeano's Open Veins of Latin America to U.S. President Barack Obama, who was making his first diplomatic visit to the region.The Washington Times In a May 2009 interview he spoke about his past and recent works, some of which deal with the relationships between freedom and slavery, and democracies and dictatorships: \"not only the United States, also some European countries, have spread military dictatorships all over the world. And they feel as if they are able to teach democracy\". He also talked about how and why he has changed his writing style, and his recent rise in popularity.Audio and transcript of interview, May 2009 In April 2014 Galeano gave an interview at the II Bienal Brasil do Livro e da Leitura in which he regretted some aspects of the writing style in Las Venas Abiertas de Am\u00e9rica Latina, saying > \"Time has passed, I've begun to try other things, to bring myself closer to > human reality in general and to political economy specifically. 'The Open > Veins' tried to be a political economy book, but I simply didn't have the > necessary education. I do not regret writing it, but it is a stage that I > have since passed.\"Sounds and Colours This interview was picked up by many critics of Galeano's work in which they used the statement to reinforce their own criticisms. However, in an interview with Jorge Majfud he said, > \"The book, written ages ago, is still alive and kicking. I am simply honest > enough to admit that at this point in my life the old writing style seems > rather stodgy, and that it's hard for me to recognize myself in it since I > now prefer to be increasingly brief and untrammeled. [The] voices that have > been raised against me and against The Open Veins of Latin America are > seriously ill with bad faith.\" The Open Veins of Eduardo Galeano, Monthly > Review, 11.06.14 ==Works== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !

An English-language translation by Cedric Belfrage gained some popularity in the English-speaking world after Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez gave it as a gift to U.S. President Barack Obama in 2009. Galeano was also an avid fan of football, writing most notably about it in Football in Sun and Shadow (El f\u00fatbol a sol y sombra). In a retrospective for SB Nation after Galeano's death, football writer Andi Thomas described the work\u2014a history of the sport, as well as an outlet for the author's own experiences with the sport and his political polemics\u2014as \"one of the greatest books about football ever written\". ==Death== Galeano died on 13 April 2015 in Montevideo\"Eduardo Galeano, Uruguayan Voice of Anti-Capitalism, is Dead at 74.\" New York Times, Tuesday, 14 April 2015, A17. from lung cancer at the age of 74, survived by third wife Helena Villagra and three children. ==Awards and honors== * 2006: International Human Rights Award by Global Exchange * 2010: Stig Dagerman Prize ==See also== * Culture of Uruguay * List of Uruguayan writers * Z Communications ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography : : : ==External links== *Interview with Eduardo Galeano *Sandra Cisneros reads \"Los Nadies/The Nobodies\" by Eduardo Galeano from Book of Embraces, El libro de los abrazos (1989) \"\". *\"Writer Without Borders\"\u2014interview by Scott Widmer on In These Times *\"Author of the Month,\" Escritores.org *The Guardian: Ch\u00e1vez creates overnight bestseller with book gift to Obama *Eduardo Galeano Interviewed by Jonah Raskin by Monthly Review, October 2009 *Haiti Occupied Country * * * \"Democracy Now\" Interview with Eduardo Galeano 2013 http://www.democracynow.org/2013/5/8/eduardo_galeano_chronicler_of_latin_americas Category:1940 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Anti-globalization writers Category:People from Montevideo Category:Uruguayan exiles Category:Uruguayan expatriates in Argentina Category:Uruguayan expatriates in Spain Category:Uruguayan journalists Category:Uruguayan novelists Category:Uruguayan people of Italian descent Category:Uruguayan people of Spanish descent Category:Uruguayan people of British descent Category:Uruguayan people of German descent Category:Uruguayan socialists Category:Writers on Latin America Category:Male novelists Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Uruguay Category:20th-century novelists Category:American Book Award winners Category:20th-century Uruguayan male writers ",
