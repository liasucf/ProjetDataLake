    "text": "Yasunori Nomura (born 1974) is a theoretical physicist working on particle physics, quantum gravity, and cosmology. He is a professor of physics at University of California, Berkeley, a senior faculty scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and a principal investigator at Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe. Since 2015, he has been the director of the Berkeley Center for Theoretical Physics.http://bctp.berkeley.edu/index.html ==Career== Nomura received his Ph.D. from University of Tokyo (supervisor Tsutomu Yanagida) in 2000 and became a Miller Research Fellow at University of California, Berkeley. In 2002-03 he was an associate scientist at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. In July 2003 he joined the Department of Physics at University of California, Berkeley. In 2017, Nomura was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society \"for pioneering contributions to a variety of areas of particle theory, including gauge unification in extra dimensions, electroweak symmetry breaking, supersymmetric models, dark matter, the multiverse, foundations of quantum mechanics, and black holes.\"APS Fellows 2017Yasunori Nomura named new American Physical Society Fellow ==Work== Nomura works on particle physics, quantum gravity, and cosmology. He developed theories of grand unification in higher dimensional spacetime and constructed the so- called holographic Higgs model, the first realistic model in which a composite Higgs particle arises as a pseudo-Nambu\u2013Goldstone boson. He also proposed that the eternally inflating multiverse is the same thing as quantum many worlds. http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/cosmicvariance/2011/05/26/are-many-worlds- and-the-multiverse-the-same-idea/#.VWtNSB29Dak ==References== ==External links== * Yasunori Nomura's home page at University of California, Berkeley * List of publications on INSPIRE Category:Theoretical physicists Category:Japanese physicists Category:String theorists Category:Living people Category:1974 births ",
