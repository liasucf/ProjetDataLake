There are two prevalent theories regarding the origin of this name. The first theory states that its inhabitants used to keep large reserves of food, money and weapons. Another theory alleges that the town was named by a group of sailors who had lost their bearings. After finding and docking at Al Thakhira, they set out to look for food, taking with them their weapons and ammunition. Alternative forms of the name include Ad Dhakh\u012brah, Adh Dhukhayr, and Al Zakhira. ==Geography== Mangrove forest in Al Thakhira Together with Al Khor City, roughly 1,392 hectares of mangroves are found just off the coast, making the coastline between Al Thakhira and Al Khor City the most densely populated mangrove habitat in Qatar.
