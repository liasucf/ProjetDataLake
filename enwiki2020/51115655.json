As part of this arrangement the league would be restructured and membership of the 2007 Premier Division and 2007 First Division would be decided by an Independent Assessment Group chaired by a former FAI honorary secretary, Des Casey. Clubs would be assessed on their past five season record in the league. Crucially though, clubs would also be graded on off-field criteria, including attendance, infrastructure, governance, strategic planning, finance, youth development and marketing. This decision would have a considerable impact on the 2006 First Division which began on March 10 and finished on November 18. The season developed into three-way battle between Shamrock Rovers, Dundalk and Galway United. Shamrock Rovers eventually emerged as champions while Dundalk finished second and went on to defeat Waterford United in a promotion/relegation play-off. However it was subsequently announced that Dundalk had failed to meet the Independent Assessment Group criteria and they would not be promoted to the Premier Division and that third placed Galway United would be promoted instead. The decision proved to be controversial and Dundalk were particularly aggrieved. On 13 December, Mark Kavanagh, a Dundalk fan protesting the decision entered the FAI's headquarters in Merrion Square and allegedly threatened to set himself on fire after pouring petrol on his head and on furniture in the offices and reception area. He gave up the protest after obtaining a meeting with Dundalk manager John Gill. Dundalk eventually accepted the FAI decision and remained in the First Division. ==Final table== ==Promotion/Relegation Play-off== Dundalk who finished second played off against Waterford United who finished eleventh in the Premier Division. ;1st Leg ;2nd Leg Dundalk won 3\u20132 on aggregate but did not meet the criteria set out by the FAI's Independent Assessment Group and were not promoted. ==IAG table== ===Notes=== ==Top scorers== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- align=center style=\"background:#efefef;\" !Player !Club !Goals |- align=left | Philip Hughes | Dundalk | align=\"center\" |19 |- align=left | Conor Gethins | Finn Harps/Galway United | align=\"center\" |16 |- align=left | Tadhg Purcell | Shamrock Rovers | align=\"center\" |12 |- align=left | Barry Moran | Galway United | align=\"center\" |11 |} ==Gallery== File:Football league of ireland season 06.png|The clubs that competed in the 2006 League of Ireland. ==See also== * 2006 League of Ireland Premier Division * 2006 League of Ireland Cup ==References== Category:League of Ireland First Division seasons Category:2006 League of Ireland Category:2006 in Republic of Ireland association football leagues Ireland Ireland ",
