    "text": "In enzymology, a Delta12-fatty acid dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :linoleate + 2AH + O2 \\rightleftharpoons crepenynate + 2A + H2O where AH is either NADH or NADPH. The 3 substrates of this enzyme are linoleate, 2AH, and O2, whereas its 3 products are crepenynate, 2A, and H2O. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous. This enzyme participates in linoleic acid metabolism. == Nomenclature == The systematic name of this enzyme class is linoleate, hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (Delta12-unsaturating). Other names in common use include * crepenynate synthase and * linoleate Delta12-fatty acid acetylenase (desaturase). ==References== == Further reading == * * Category:EC 1.14.99 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
