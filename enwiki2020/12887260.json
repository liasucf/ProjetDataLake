    "text": "256px This is a list of video game franchises by Sega or a subsidiary of the company. All series spanning multiple games are listed here. Games that were developed and published by third parties but released on Sega consoles are not listed here. Almost all of these titles and series have been published by Sega with the exception of a couple of franchises in which Sega was the developer. In the case of a franchise in which there are multiple games but no series article exists, the first game in the series is the main article and is linked to this list. Among the franchises listed here are franchises now owned by 2K Sports, as those franchises were originally published by Sega until Sega sold the rights to the franchises in 2005. In the case of these games, the latest release date given for the franchise shall be that of the last game in which Sega was involved in its publishing. Also included in the franchise list is Total War. While this series did not begin with Sega as either a developer or a publisher, Sega did publish later games in the series. In 2016, Sega acquired the intellectual properties of Technosoft. ==Franchises== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"auto\" |- ! Franchise ! Main developer ! Genre ! First release !
