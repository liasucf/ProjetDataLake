Marv Wolfman later acknowledged that he recycled the idea of different people posing as a single villain from his earlier characters the Brothers Grimm. ==Fictional character biography== ===Trident Trio=== In the story, the three alter-egos of Trident were operatives of the H.I.V.E. who later splintered from the group. \"Prof\" was a weapons design specialist. Sammy Jaye was an enforcer. The third one was an unidentified black man that used to fight in the Golden Gloves. Eventually, they decide to team up and strike out on their own. Each adopts the costume and code-name of Trident, and each is armed with a powerful trident. The trident's right tine shoots fire, the left tine shoots ice, and the center tine releases a blast of devastating force. Trident operates in New York City, each criminal taking turns at committing several large robberies, leading the public to believe them to be a single person. Eventually, the Sammy Jaye Trident tries to cheat his two partners out of their share of loot. The other two kill Sammy and his costumed body is discovered by the Teen Titans and the police. Starfire eventually figures out that there is more than one Trident. After tracking down the other two Tridents, the Teen Titans defeated the Tridents and they were handed over to the police.New Teen Titans #33 Some time after the two surviving Tridents are imprisoned, Wildebeest springs the unnamed Trident, Gizmo, Puppeteer, and Disruptor from jail.

This version of Trident is depicted as an extremely arrogant fish-man and is an enemy of the Atlanteans. He intended to overthrow Atlantis and take over the surface world by making an army of clones of himself using toxic chemicals. He was attacked by the Teen Titans in their T-Sub, accompanied by the Atlantian superhero Aqualad. His own ego, however, thwarted his plans when Beast Boy and Aqualad enticed his entire clone army to turn on each other, and they were soon afterwards buried in an undersea cave by the Titans. Trident later reappeared as a member of the Brotherhood of Evil. He takes down Aqualad with help from Plasmus in \"Calling All Titans.\" In \"Titans Together,\" Trident is defeated in with the rest of the Brotherhood of Evil. ==References== Category:Fictional African-American people Category:DC Comics Atlanteans Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:Fictional clones Category:DC Comics martial artists Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves Category:Comics characters introduced in 1983 Category:Characters created by Marv Wolfman Category:Characters created by George P\u00e9rez ",
