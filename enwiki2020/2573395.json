Grant, the widow of Mayor Hugh J. Grant. She stipulated that her gift be used to build a Jesuit high school providing a free education for Catholic boys with special consideration given to those who could not otherwise afford a Catholic education. The school continues that policy and does not charge tuition. The Grants' former home is the residence of the Vatican Observer to the United Nations, where the pope stays when he visits New York City. Following the death of her husband in 1910, Julia Grant met with Father David W. Hearn, S.J. and, with a stipulation of strict anonymity, gave him an envelope with the money needed to start a school to educate Catholic boys. After Mrs. Grant died, her children took over the funding of the school. The last surviving member of the family, Lucie Mackey Grant, a daughter-in-law of Julia Grant, died in 2007. Since the 1960s, Regis has relied primarily on the Grant endowments and alumni donations to keep the school tuition free. Following Lucie Mackey Grant's death, at an auction of her estate, Regis bid successfully for the original golden chalice used during Mass when the school was founded in 1914. The identity of the school's founding benefactor was officially kept secret for decades, though the large portrait in the school's first floor conference room titled \"Julia Grant\" contradicted the official policy. The online announcement, of an auction that included items related to the school's founding, did so as well. Finally, on October 26, 2009, a documentary film revealed her identity and detailed the circumstances of her gift. The school building was designed by Maginnis & Walsh. On Saturday, May 14, 2011, a two-alarm fire destroyed the school's principal gymnasium and caused some peripheral damage. The school re-opened the following Tuesday.NBC New York: \"Fire Tears Through Regis High School,\" May 16, 2011, accessed May 17, 2011 ==Extracurricular activities== The Owl, the school's newspaper, interviewed CIA leak case prosecutor and alumnus Patrick J.
