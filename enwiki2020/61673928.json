    "text": "The Act is the seventh studio album by American metalcore band The Devil Wears Prada. It was released on October 11, 2019 through Solid State Records. The album was produced by the band's keyboardist/ programmer Jonathan Gering. ==Writing== Vocalist Mike Hranica mentioned the band scrapped 60 songs they had developed before settling with the 12 that make up the album. Hranica stated \"We wanted to do something that actually tests the boundaries, You don't see that in rock, and there's so little invention in rock these days.\" The band was heavily inspired by the album Hiss Spun by Chelsea Wolfe when writing the album. == Track listing == == Personnel == All credits by AllMusic.
