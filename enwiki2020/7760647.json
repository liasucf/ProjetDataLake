    "text": "The Franc\u0153ur Motion, introduced in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec in 1918 by Liberal MLA Joseph-Napol\u00e9on Franc\u0153ur, declared that Quebec would be prepared to leave the Canadian federation if English Canadians felt the presence of Quebec was \"an obstacle to the union, progress and development of Canada\". > Que cette Chambre est d\u2019avis que la Province de Qu\u00e9bec serait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 > accepter la rupture du pacte conf\u00e9d\u00e9ratif, si dans les autres provinces, on > croit qu\u2019elle est un obstacle \u00e0 l\u2019union, au progr\u00e8s et au d\u00e9veloppement du > Canada. > (That this House is of the opinion that the Province of Quebec would be > prepared to accept the break-up of the Confederation Pact if, in the other > provinces, it is believed to be an obstacle to the union, progress and > development of Canada.) Franc\u0153ur's motion was a response to the harsh reaction in English Canada to Quebec's strong anti-conscription feelings during the Conscription Crisis of 1917 of the First World War. Many Quebecers opposed conscription because of anti-imperialist sentiments. The motion attracted widespread attention in the press and was notably approved by the newspaper Le Canada. Premier of Quebec Lomer Gouin finally convinced Franc\u0153ur not to present it to the Legislative Assembly because he did not wish to see a vote taken on it. == See also == *Quebec independence movement *Politics of Quebec *History of Quebec ==References== *\"14e l\u00e9gislature, 2e session: Analyse des journaux et des sources\" at the National Assembly of Quebec Category:Quebec sovereignty movement Category:1918 in Canada ",
