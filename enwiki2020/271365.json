It had an estimated population of 115,015 in 2013.Institut National de la Statistique, Antananarivo. ==History== The bay and city originally used the name Diego- Suarez, named after Diogo Soares, a Portuguese navigator who visited the bay in 1543\u201344.Pierre Van Den Boogaerde, Shipwrecks of Madagascar, p.40 In the 1880s, the bay was coveted by France, which desired it as a coaling station for steamships. After the first Franco-Hova War, Queen Ranavalona III signed a treaty on December 17, 1885, granting France a protectorate over the bay and surrounding territory, as well as the islands of Nosy-Be and Ste. Marie de Madagascar. The colony's administration was subsumed into that of Madagascar in 1896. The Second Pacific Squadron of Imperial Russia anchored and was resupplied at Diego-Suarez on its way to the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. French had surrendered on 13 May 1942. In 1942, Diego-Su\u00e1rez was the primary objective of Operation Ironclad, the starting point of the Allied invasion and capture of Madagascar. The Allies were concerned that Japan would pressure Vichy France into granting use of Madagascar, as they had with French Indo- China during the previous year, and determined that the island should not be made a base for the interception of Allied shipping. Diego-Suarez, with its superb harbour and a concentration of government officials, was selected as the initial invasion point. The Japanese responded with an attack by midget submarines on the British naval forces in the harbour, damaging the battleship and sinking the oil tanker British Loyalty.Wilson, Michael; (2000), A Submariners War; Stroud, Tempus. France continued to operate a military base in the city following Malagasy independence in 1960. Between 1973 and 1975, French forces were withdrawn. == Geography == === Climate === ==Transport== Container ship in Antsiranana harbour Antsiranana is situated on Antsiranana Bay, one of the largest deep-water harbours in the Indian Ocean, but the remote location, and, until recently, a bad road to the south, rendered it unimportant for freight traffic.
