    "text": "Stater issued by verica Verica (early 1st century AD) was a British client king of the Roman Empire in the years preceding the Claudian invasion of 43 AD. From his coinage, he appears to have been king of the, probably Belgic, Atrebates tribe and a son of Commius. He succeeded his elder brother Eppillus as kinghttps://www.britannica.com/place/United-Kingdom/Roman-Britain#ref482473 in about 15 AD, reigning at Calleva Atrebatum, today called Silchester. He was recognised as rex by Rome and appears to have had friendly trade and diplomatic links with the empire. His territory was pressed from the east by the Catuvellauni, led by Epaticcus, brother of Cunobelinus, who conquered Calleva in about 25 AD. After Epaticcus's death ca. 35 AD Verica regained some territory, but Cunobelinus's son Caratacus took over and conquered the entire kingdom some time after 40 AD. Dio Cassius records that \"Bericus\" (almost certainly Verica) was expelled from Britain around this time during a revolt.Dio Cassius, Roman History 60:19 Suetonius refers to demands by the Britons that Rome return \"certain deserters\".Suetonius, Claudius 17 As rex, Verica was nominally an ally of Rome, so his exile gave Claudius an excuse to begin his invasion. Verica's relationship with Rome has been used to argue for the site of the Roman invasion of Britain as being along the south coast to assist him, rather than being at the traditional spot at Richborough in Kent. After the invasion, Verica may have been restored as king, but this is not attested in the historical or archaeological record. In any case a new ruler for the region, Cogidubnus, soon appeared. Cogidubnus may have been an heir of Verica who by this time would have been very elderly indeed. ==References== ==External links== *Atrebates at Roman-Britain.org *Atrebates at Romans in Britain *Coinage of Verica at The Celtic Coin Index Category:Briton rulers Category:Celtic warriors Category:1st-century monarchs in Europe ",
