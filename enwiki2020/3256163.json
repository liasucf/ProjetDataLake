    "text": "Hepacivirus is a genus of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses in the family Flaviviridae. The hepatitis C virus (HCV), the species Hepacivirus C, infects humans as its only known natural host, and is associated with hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. ==Taxonomy== The viruses belonging this genus have been classified into 14 species - Hepacivirus A-N. * The species Hepacivirus A includes the virus canine hepacivirus/non-primate hepacivirus/equine hepacivirus * The species Hepacivirus B includes the virus GBV-B * The species Hepacivirus C includes the virus Hepatitis C virus (previously included in the species Hepatitis C virus) * The species Hepacivirus D includes the virus Guereza hepacivirus * The species Hepacivirus E includes the virus rodent hepacivirus-339 * The species Hepacivirus F includes the virus rodent hepacivirus-NLR07-oct70 * The species Hepacivirus G includes the virus Norway rat hepacivirus 1 * The species Hepacivirus H includes the virus Norway rat hepacivirus 2 * The species Hepacivirus I includes the virus rodent hepacivirus-SAR-3/RSA/2008 * The species Hepacivirus J includes the virus rodent hepacivirus-RMU10-3382/GER/2010 * The species Hepacivirus K includes the virus bat hepacivirus-PDB-829 * The species Hepacivirus L includes the virus bat hepacivirus-PDB-112 * The species Hepacivirus M includes the virus bat hepacivirus-PDB-491.1 * The species Hepacivirus N includes the virus bovine hepacivirus * The species Hepacivirus P infects the long-tailed ground squirrel (Spermophilus undulatus)Li LL, Liu MM, Shen S, Zhang YJ, Xu YL, Deng HY, Deng F, Duan ZJ (2019) Detection and characterization of a novel hepacivirus in long-tailed ground squirrels (Spermophilus undulatus) in China. Arch Virol A virus species newly isolated from the bamboo rat (Rhizomys pruinosus) belongs to this genus but appears not to have been previously described. Another unclassified virus in this taxon is duck hepacivirus-like virus.Chu L, Jin M, Feng C, Wang X, Zhang D (2019) A highly divergent hepacivirus-like flavivirus in domestic ducks. J Gen Virol A virus in this genus has been isolated from bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) Goldberg TL, Sibley SD, Pinkerton ME, Dunn CD, Long LJ, White LC, Strom SM (2019) Multidecade mortality and a homolog of Hepatitis C Virus in bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), the national bird of the USA. Sci Rep 9(1):14953 Another virus - Jogalong virus - has been described that appears to belong to another species in this genus.Williams SH, Levy A, Yates RA, Somaweera N, Neville PJ, Nicholson J, Lindsay MDA, Mackenzie JS, Jain K, Imrie A, Smith DW, Lipkin WI (2020) Discovery of Jogalong virus, a novel hepacivirus identified in a Culex annulirostris (Skuse) mosquito from the Kimberley region of Western Australia. PLoS One 15(1):e0227114 ==Structure== Viruses in the genus Hepacivirus are enveloped, with spherical geometries. The diameter is around 50 nm. Genomes are linear and non-segmented, around 10kb in length. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Genus !! Structure || Symmetry !! Capsid !! Genomic arrangement !! Genomic segmentation |- |Hepacivirus||Icosahedral-like||Pseudo T=3||Enveloped||Linear||Monopartite |} ==Life cycle== Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral envelope protein E to host receptors, which mediates clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded rna virus transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by viral initiation. Human serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are sexual, blood, and contact. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Genus !! Host details !! Tissue tropism !!

Seven genotypes (1-7) and eighty six subtypes (1a, 1b etc.) of hepatitis C virus have been named. GBV-B virus (also known as GB virus B) discovered in 1995 is capable of infecting New World monkeys, in particular tamarins. Like HCV it is transmitted by the blood-borne route and similar to HCV it is associated with the viral hepatitis. However GBV-B has never been identified in wild animals and its natural host is not known. ==Additional Information== Additional hepaciviruses have been described from bats, rodents including bank voles, horses and dogs. Cattle also appear to be a host for viruses of the species Hepacivirus N. Rodent hepacivirus is found in the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). A virus related to hepaciviruses has been isolated from the graceful catshark (Proscyllium habereri). There are at least two subtypes of equine hepacivirus. The viruses most closely related to Hepacivirus C are the equine hepaciviruses of the species Hepacivirus A . Hepacivirus A infecting horses has also been found in donkeys.Walter S, Rasche A, Moreira-Soto A, Pfaender S, Bletsa M, Corman VM, Aguilar-Setien A, Garc\u00eda- Lacy F, Hans A, Todt D, Schuler G, Shnaiderman-Torban A, Steinman A, Roncoroni C, Veneziano V, Rusenova N12, Sandev N12, Rusenov A, Zapryanova D, Garc\u00eda- Bocanegra I, Jores J, Carluccio A, Veronesi MC, Cavalleri JMV, Drosten C, Lemey P, Steinmann E, Drexler JF (2016) Differential infection patterns and recent evolutionary origins of Equine Hepaciviruses in donkeys.
