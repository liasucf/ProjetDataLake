    "text": "Example of Kautz graph on 3 characters with string length 2 (on the left) and 3 (on the right); the edges on the left correspond to the vertices on the right. The Kautz graph K_M^{N + 1} is a directed graph of degree M and dimension N+ 1, which has (M +1)M^{N} vertices labeled by all possible strings s_0 \\cdots s_N of length N + 1 which are composed of characters s_i chosen from an alphabet A containing M + 1 distinct symbols, subject to the condition that adjacent characters in the string cannot be equal (s_i eq s_{i+ 1}). The Kautz graph K_M^{N + 1} has (M + 1)M^{N \\+ 1} edges \\\\{(s_0 s_1 \\cdots s_N,s_1 s_2 \\cdots s_N s_{N + 1})| \\; s_i \\in A \\; s_i eq s_{i + 1} \\\\} \\, It is natural to label each such edge of K_M^{N + 1} as s_0s_1 \\cdots s_{N + 1}, giving a one-to-one correspondence between edges of the Kautz graph K_M^{N + 1} and vertices of the Kautz graph K_M^{N + 2}. Kautz graphs are closely related to De Bruijn graphs. == Properties == * For a fixed degree M and number of vertices V = (M + 1) M^N, the Kautz graph has the smallest diameter of any possible directed graph with V vertices and degree M. * All Kautz graphs have Eulerian cycles. (An Eulerian cycle is one which visits each edge exactly once\u2014This result follows because Kautz graphs have in-degree equal to out-degree for each node) * All Kautz graphs have a Hamiltonian cycle (This result follows from the correspondence described above between edges of the Kautz graph K_M^{N} and vertices of the Kautz graph K_M^{N + 1}; a Hamiltonian cycle on K_M^{N + 1} is given by an Eulerian cycle on K_M^{N}) * A degree-k Kautz graph has k disjoint paths from any node x to any other node y. == In computing == The Kautz graph has been used as a network topology for connecting processors in high-performance computing and fault-tolerant computing applications: such a network is known as a Kautz network. == Notes == Category:Parametric families of graphs Category:Directed graphs ",
