    "text": "In two dimensions, there are 4 orthants (called quadrants) In geometry, an orthant or hyperoctant is the analogue in n-dimensional Euclidean space of a quadrant in the plane or an octant in three dimensions. In general an orthant in n-dimensions can be considered the intersection of n mutually orthogonal half-spaces. By independent selections of half-space signs, there are 2n orthants in n-dimensional space. More specifically, a closed orthant in Rn is a subset defined by constraining each Cartesian coordinate to be nonnegative or nonpositive. Such a subset is defined by a system of inequalities: :\u03b51x1 \u2265 0 \u03b52x2 \u2265 0 * * * \u03b5nxn \u2265 0, where each \u03b5i is +1 or \u22121\\. Similarly, an open orthant in Rn is a subset defined by a system of strict inequalities :\u03b51x1 > 0 \u03b52x2 > 0 * * * \u03b5nxn > 0, where each \u03b5i is +1 or \u22121. By dimension: *In one dimension, an orthant is a ray. *In two dimensions, an orthant is a quadrant. *In three dimensions, an orthant is an octant. John Conway defined the term n-orthoplex from orthant complex as a regular polytope in n-dimensions with 2n simplex facets, one per orthant. The nonnegative orthant is the generalization of the first quadrant to n-dimensions and is important in many constrained optimization problems. ==See also== * Cross polytope (or orthoplex) - a family of regular polytopes in n-dimensions which can be constructed with one simplex facets in each orthant space. * Measure polytope (or hypercube) - a family of regular polytopes in n-dimensions which can be constructed with one vertex in each orthant space. * Orthotope - Generalization of a rectangle in n-dimensions, with one vertex in each orthant. ==Notes== * The facts on file: Geometry handbook, Catherine A.
