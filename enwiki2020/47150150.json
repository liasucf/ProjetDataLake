It was directed by Yves All\u00e9gret. ==Partial cast== * Daniel G\u00e9lin \u2013 Pierre * Hildegarde Neff \u2013 Maria * Jean Lefebvre \u2013 Georges ==Plot== == Censorship == When the film was first released in Italy in 1960 (Italian title: La Ragazza Di Amburgo) the Committee for the Theatrical Review of the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities rated the film not suitable for children under 16. The reason for the age restriction, cited in the official documents, is the presence of several scenes considered to be inappropriate to the sensitivity of a minor. For the film to be screened publicly, the Committee recommended the removal of the scene in which Pierre and Maria are in bed and he is sensually kissing her on the neck. The committee considered this scene offensive to decency and morality. The official document number is: 31890, it was signed on 6 May 1960 by Minister Domenico Magr\u00ec. == External links == * Category:1958 films Category:French- language films Category:Films directed by Yves All\u00e9gret Category:French drama films Category:French films Category:Films set in Hamburg ",
