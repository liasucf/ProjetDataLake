It is an Orthodox monastery dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It was founded in 990, but the current building dates back to 1731. It is built at an altitude of 1,500m (4566 feet) and the closest village is Platres. The Holy Monastery of Trooditissa is estimated to have been founded after the period of iconoclasm. The earlier buildings, which were of the middle Byzantine period (12th century) are not saved. The main church and the other surrounding buildings were built in the 18th-20th centuries. The most important relic of the monastery is the thaumaturgist icon of Virgin Mary, originally from Asia Minor and is known for its wonders to childless married couples who wish to have a child. The church celebrates on 15 August, during the feast of the Assumption. ==References== Category:Cypriot Orthodox monasteries Category:Churches completed in 1731 Category:Christian monasteries established in the 18th century Category:Greek Orthodox monasteries ",
