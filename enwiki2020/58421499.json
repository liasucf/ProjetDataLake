She was 14 years his junior. ==Life== ===Family background=== Imperial Noble Consort Quehui's personal name was not recorded in history. Her family originally belonged to the Han Chinese Plain Blue Banner. * Father: Guowei (; d. 1719), served as a first rank military official (), and held the title of a first class duke () ** Paternal grandfather: Tulai (; 1606\u20131658), served as a first rank military official (), and held the title of a first class duke () ** Paternal grandmother: Lady Gioro ** Paternal aunt: Empress Xiaokangzhang (1638\u20131663), the mother of the Kangxi Emperor (1654\u20131722) * Mother: Lady He\u0161eri * Six brothers ** First brother: Yekeshu (\u53f6\u514b\u4e66), father of Shun'anyan ** Second brother: Dekesi (\u5fb7\u514b\u65b0), served as third class imperial guard ** Third brother: Longkodo (d. 1728) ** Fourth brother: Hongshan (\u6d2a\u5584) ** Fifth brother: Qingyuan (\u5e86\u5143) ** Sixth brother: Qingfu (\u5e86\u5fa9; d. 1747), served as first rank military official (\u90fd\u7d71/\u90fd\u7edf, pinyin: dutong) from 1727-1733, Viceroy of Liangjiang, Viceroy of Yunnan, Viceroy of Liangguang in 1741, a Grand Secretary of Wenhua hall (\u6587\u534e\u6bbf\u5927\u5b66\u58eb) * Elder sister: Empress Xiaoyiren (d. 1689) === Kangxi era === Imperial Noble Consort Quehui was born in 1668. It is not known when did lady Tunggiya enter the Forbidden City; historical records state that she was present on the funeral of Consort Xuan in 1697 as a consort. By that year, Empress Xiaoyiren, Noble Consort Wenxi and Imperial Noble Consort Jingmin had died, leaving imperial harem without de iure head. Kangxi Emperor didn't instate a new empress, instead granted lady Tunggiya a title \"Noble Consort\" in January 1701. As she was an only noble consort, she didn't receive any honorifical name. In 1706, Noble Consort received 150 lard fishes, while Empress Dowager Renxian received 50 sesame oil fishes. From 1711, Lady Tong and Consort He were tasked with raising Hongli, a son of Prince Yong of the First Rank, Yinzhen. === Yongzheng era === After the coronation of the Yongzheng Emperor in 1722, lady Tong was promoted to Imperial Noble Consort, but the promotion ceremony was delayed until July 1724 due to national mourning. === Qianlong era === In 1736, she was given a title \"Dowager Imperial Noble Consort Shouqi\" (\u5bff\u797a\u7687\u8d35\u5983; \"shouqi\" meaning \"long-living and auspicious\"). Imperial Noble Consort Shouqi resided in Palace of Tranquil Longevity together with four grand dowager consorts. While choosing suitable titles to be given to dowager consorts, the emperor said: > There are four dowager consorts: that is Dowager Consort Tong, another is > Dowager Consort He. Original version: \u6b64\u56db\u4f4d\u5185\uff0c\u90a3\u4f4d\u7cfb\u4f5f\u592a\u5983\uff0c\u90a3\u4f4d\u7cfb\u548c\u592a\u5983. These words justified emperor's decision to distinguish her as a person who had taken care after him in his childhood, although the decree was inspired by minister's suggestion. Imperial Noble Consort Shouqi died on 24 April 1743 in her residence. She was granted posthumous title \"Imperial Noble Consort Quehui\" (\u60ab\u60e0\u7687\u8d35\u5983, \"quehui\" meaning \"honest and kind\"). == Ancestry == ==Titles== * During the reign of the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661\u20131722): ** Lady Tong (from September/October 1668) ** Noble Consort (; from January/February 1701\u5eb7\u7199\u4e09\u5341\u4e5d\u5e74 \u5341\u4e8c\u6708), third rank consort * During the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722\u20131735): ** Imperial Noble Consort (; from July/August 1724\u96cd\u6b63\u4e8c\u5e74 \u516d\u6708), second rank consort * During the reign of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735\u20131796): ** Imperial Noble Consort Shouqi (; from December 1736\u4e7e\u9686\u5143\u5e74 \u5341\u4e00\u6708) ** Imperial Noble Consort Quehui (; from June/July 1743\u4e7e\u9686\u516b\u5e74 \u4e94\u6708) ==See also== * Ranks of imperial consorts in China#Qing * Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1668 births Category:1743 deaths Category:17th-century Chinese women Category:18th-century Chinese women Category:Qing dynasty imperial consorts Category:Kangxi Emperor ",
