Retrieved 5 December 2008. ==Gameplay== To play Yoake no Mariko, players must provide voice acting to correspond with a movie scene that unfolds before them. There are six levels (or scenes) in the game which include such genres as the western drama, the horror flick, and the Kung Fu action flick. As the background film clip plays, on-screen cues inform players when to deliver their lines and how to modulate their vocal intonations in a manner similar to karaoke games. The spoken lines are then graded by an in-game algorithm and the players are scored on their performance. Specifically considered are the players' timings, volumes, and tones. ==References== Category:2001 video games Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation 2-only games Category:Simulation video games Category:Sp\u00fcmc\u00f8 Category:Video games developed in Japan ",
