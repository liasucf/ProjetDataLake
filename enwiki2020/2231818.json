It is currently a subsidiary of the Chang'an Automobile Group. ==History== Hafei centre in Chile Hafei was formerly owned by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, but in 2009 the Chang'an Automobile Group purchased most Hafei-related assets prompted by a Chinese State policy aimed at consolidating the domestic automobile manufacturing industry. The earliest Hafei products were Suzuki Carry-based microvans and trucks sold under the Songhuajiang brand, named after the Songhua River, but since 2002 they have been sold directly as Hafeis. Their vehicles have always carried the \"HFJ\" identity code, no matter the brand. As of 2009, the company had exported products to a total of 40 nations including Russia. These exports may have been in the form of knock-down kits and were likely on a minuscule scale. ==Production bases== Hafei has production facilities in Northern China. ==Models== Hafei has produced small cars and MPVs in addition to small trucks and commercial vans. These so-called mini vehicles make up the majority of the Hafei model line.
