The cathedral is the seat of the Bishop of Ch\u00e2lons and was consecrated in 1147 October 26, by Pope Eugene III. Jean-Jacques Arveuf-Fransquin designed the neo-Flamboyant organ case of Ch\u00e2lons Cathedral. The case was created by the cabinetmaker Etienne Gabriel Ventadour, and housed the instrument made by John Abbey, who delivered the instrument in 1849. The cathedral is also noted for its stained glass windows.
