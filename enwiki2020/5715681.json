    "text": "Paul Robert Tisdale (born 14 January 1973) is an English professional football manager and former player who played as a midfielder. Tisdale represented Southampton, Bristol City, FinnPa, Panionios and Yeovil Town during a career which began in 1991 and concluded in 2000. During his time at Exeter City, he remained registered as a player between 2007 and 2016, making his debut as a late substitute in a 2\u20131 victory at Sheffield Wednesday at the end of the 2010\u201311 season and naming himself as a substitute in the EFL Trophy match at Oxford Utd on 30 August 2016. Tisdale previously managed Team Bath. Having managed Exeter City from June 2006 until June 2018, he was, for 19 days, the longest-serving manager at one club in the English Football League. ==Playing career== ===Southampton=== A former England schools international, Tisdale came through the youth system at Southampton. He signed as a professional in June 1991. He was loaned out to Northampton Town in February and March 1993, where he made five league appearances. He eventually made his Southampton debut in a League Cup game against Huddersfield Town on 5 October 1994. Unfortunately, at this time Southampton were enduring frequent changes of manager and, as a result, Tisdale never had a settled run in the first team. Having played his last senior game for Southampton on 27 April 1996, he again went out on loan in the 1996\u201397 season, this time to Huddersfield Town, where he made only two appearances. In his time at Southampton he made a total of 18 first team appearances, scoring once, against Manchester City on 16 March 1996, when he took one touch and delicately lifted the ball over goalkeeper Eike Immel. Following the departure of mentor David Merrington, Tisdale moved to Bristol City in August 1997. ===Bristol City and abroad=== At Bristol City his appearances were limited. It was while at Bristol City that Tisdale got his first taste of life at Exeter City, with a three-month loan at the club during the 1997\u201398 season. He left Ashton Gate after just one year, and played abroad for both Finnish club FinnPa and Greek club Panionios before returning to England to spend a year with Yeovil Town. ==Coaching and management== ===Team Bath=== Injury forced him to end his career early, and he took a coaching role with non-league club Team Bath in 2000. Tisdale entered the University of Bath side into the 2002\u201303 FA Cup, becoming the first university team to enter the competition since Gonville & Caius in 1881. Team Bath entered in the preliminary round and advanced through four qualifying rounds to the first round proper, before losing to Mansfield Town. At Team Bath, Tisdale led the club through four promotions in non-league football. ===Exeter City=== During the summer of 2006, Tisdale left Team Bath to take up the vacant manager's position at then Conference National side Exeter City. In his first season he led the club to their first playoff finish, just missing out on promotion after losing the final 2\u20131 to Morecambe at Wembley Stadium on 20 May 2007. However the following season success would soon follow, with Tisdale eventually leading the club to yet another playoff finish and ultimately promotion to the Football League following a 1\u20130 final victory over Cambridge United on 18 May 2008. Following promotion, Tisdale signed a new two-year rolling contract with the club in October 2008. Under his guidance the club continued their impressive form with Tisdale eventually leading the club to a second-place finish and promotion to League One, becoming the first Exeter City manager in their history to lead the club to back-to-back promotions. The following 2009\u201310 season proved more of a challenge however, with the club surviving relegation from the third tier with an 18th-placed finish on the final day of the season following a 2\u20131 win over Huddersfield Town. Exeter City's second season in League One under Tisdale proved to be far more successful, with the club finishing in eighth place at the conclusion of the 2010\u201311 season \u2013 equalling the club's highest ever league finish. During the final day of the season, Tisdale \u2013 also a registered player at the club \u2013 came on as a 90th-minute substitute in a 2\u20131 away win over Sheffield Wednesday. The 2011\u201312 season however, concluded Exeter City's short stay in League One under Tisdale, with the club eventually relegated to League Two following a 23rd- place finish. Over the following four seasons under Tisdale's management, Exeter maintained their League Two status with consecutive top half finishes. At the end of the 2016\u201317 season \u2013 Tisdale's eleventh season as manager of the club \u2013 Exeter City finished in fifth place, achieving another playoff finish. After defeating Carlisle United across a two-legged semi-final, Tisdale led Exeter to Wembley once again. The final would end in disappointment however, with Blackpool defeating Exeter 2\u20131 on 28 May 2017. The 2017\u201318 season was to be Tisdale's final season as manager of Exeter City. Once again he led the club to the playoffs after achieving a fourth-place league finish. Following victory over promotion rivals Lincoln City across two legs, Tisdale led Exeter City to a Wembley playoff final for a fourth time. Once again, the day was to end with disappointment for Tisdale and Exeter City, with Coventry City winning the tie 3\u20131 on 28 May 2018. On 1 June 2018, following a failure to agree a new contract, Tisdale left Exeter City after twelve years at the club. At the time of his departure, Tisdale was the longest serving manager in English football's top four divisions. ===Milton Keynes Dons=== Tisdale was appointed manager of newly relegated League Two club Milton Keynes Dons on 6 June 2018 ahead of the 2018\u201319 season. After a near-perfect month which saw the club gain 16 points from a possible 18, he was named League Two Manager of the Month for October 2018 by the EFL for only the second time in his career. Tisdale went on to lead Milton Keynes Dons to automatic promotion back to League One at the first attempt, achieving a third-place finish. Following a poor start to the 2019\u201320 season in which Milton Keynes Dons achieved only one point from a possible 27 - the worst run of results in the club's short history - Tisdale's contract with the club was mutually terminated on 2 November 2019 following a 1\u20133 home defeat to Tranmere Rovers. ==Personal life== He went to school in Bath, where he was childhood friends with actor Andrew Lincoln. In 2017, Lincoln said \"One of my oldest and dearest friends happens to be Paul Tisdale. So I've been watching him very avidly throughout his whole career and I've been very proud of him.\" Tisdale's uncle is Game of Thrones actor James Faulkner who played Randyll Tarly in the show. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|From !rowspan=2|To !colspan=5|Record |- !!!!!!!!! |- |align=left|Exeter City |align=left|26 June 2006 |align=left|1 June 2018 |- |align=left|Milton Keynes Dons |align=left|6 June 2018 |align=left|2 November 2019 |- !colspan=3|Total |} ==Honours== ===As a manager=== Team Bath *Western Football League First Division: 2000\u201301 *Western Football League Premier Division: 2002\u201303 Exeter City *Conference Premier play-offs: 2008 *Football League Two runners-up: 2008\u201309 Milton Keynes Dons *EFL League Two third-place promotion: 2018\u201319 Individual *LMA Manager of the Year: 2008\u201309 League Two *EFL League Two Manager of the Month: August 2017, October 2018 ==References== ==External links== * * www.paultisdale.co.uk Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:People from Valletta Category:English footballers Category:England schools international footballers Category:Maltese footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:Northampton Town F.C. players Category:Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players Category:Bristol City F.C. players Category:Exeter City F.C. players Category:FinnPa players Category:Panionios F.C. players Category:Yeovil Town F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:Veikkausliiga players Category:Super League Greece players Category:English expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Finland Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:English football managers Category:Maltese football managers Category:Exeter City F.C. managers Category:Milton Keynes Dons F.C. managers Category:National League (English football) managers Category:English Football League managers Category:People educated at Beechen Cliff School Category:Association football coaches ",
