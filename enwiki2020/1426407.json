    "text": "The Cahuenga Pass (; from the indigenous Tongva language), elevation , is a low mountain pass through the eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains in the Hollywood Hills district of the City of Los Angeles, California. The Cahuenga Pass connects the Los Angeles Basin to the San Fernando Valley via U.S. Route 101 (Hollywood Freeway) and Cahuenga Boulevard. It is the lowest pass through the mountains. It was the site of two major battles: the Battle of Cahuenga Pass in 1831 (a fight between local settlers and the Mexican-appointed governor and his men; two deaths), and the Battle of Providencia or Second Battle of Cahuenga Pass in 1845 (between locals over whether to secede from Mexico; one horse and one mule killed). Both were on the San Fernando Valley side near present-day Studio City, and cannonballs are still occasionally found during excavations in the area. Along the route of the historic El Camino Real, the historic significance of the pass is also marked by a marker along Cahuenga Blvd. which names the area Paseo de Cahuenga. ==See also== *Campo de Cahuenga *Rancho Cahuenga *Cahuenga, California; Tongva settlement. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Neighborhoods in Los Angeles Category:Mountain passes of California Category:U.S. Route 101 Category:San Fernando Valley Category:Transportation in the San Fernando Valley Category:Santa Monica Mountains Category:El Camino Viejo Category:Hollywood Hills Category:Landforms of Los Angeles County, California ",
