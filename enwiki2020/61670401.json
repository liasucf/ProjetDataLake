    "text": "Supertank printers are a type of continuous ink system (CISS) inkjet printer. Supertank printers differ from traditional inkjet printers in that the printhead is connected via a tube system that draws ink from high-capacity ink tanks, which are filled and refilled via high-capacity ink bottles, eliminating the need for ink cartridges. Cost-per-page (CPP) can be significantly lower than traditional cartridges, as replacement ink bottles contain enough ink to print thousands of pages, and typically cost under $20. == Supertank printhead types == Supertank printers come in two different configurations: fixed (permanent) printheads and disposable printheads. Each configuration has its own advantages and disadvantages. === Fixed printheads === Fixed printheads are a permanent printhead that is designed to last for the life of the printer. Because it does not need to be replaced every time it exhausts its ink supply, ink costs can be lower and the printhead itself can be more precise than a disposable one, typically requiring no calibration. On the other hand, if a fixed printhead is damaged, obtaining a replacement can become expensive, and removal and replacement of the head is not always possible. If the printhead cannot be removed, the printer itself would need to be replaced. Fixed-printhead consumer supertank printers are manufactured primarily by Epson. === Disposable printheads === Disposable printheads use a printhead that is part of a replaceable ink cartridge. Every time a cartridge is exhausted, the entire cartridge and printhead are replaced. This adds to the cost of consumables and makes it more difficult to manufacture a high- precision head at a reasonable cost, but also means that a damaged or clogged printhead is only a minor problem: the user can simply buy a new cartridge. Canon now uses (in most models) replaceable printheads which are designed to last the life of the printer, but can be replaced by the user should they become clogged. == Advantages == *Printing costs are lower with the use of low-cost replacement ink bottles vs. ink cartridges. *The convenience of printing thousands of pages with fewer interruptions to replenish ink. *As an inkjet printer, it dispenses ink droplets at a very high speed, which allows for a relatively long distance between the printhead and the substrate, and a high drop-ejection frequency, allowing for high-speed printing. *The reduction of waste due to the elimination of used cartridges and their packaging. == Disadvantages == *The initial cost to purchase is generally higher than cartridge printers, which often follow the razor and blades model of selling the printers at or below cost to generate later sales of proprietary cartridges. == Examples == EcoTank by Epson and MegaTank by Canon are examples of supertank printers. Epson\u2019s EcoTank printers first came to the U.S. market in 2015, while Canon released the Megatank in 2017. == References == Category:Inkjet printers ",
