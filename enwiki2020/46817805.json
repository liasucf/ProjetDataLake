With his brother, he bought a ranch near San Bernardino in 1872 and studied the flora of southern California. His collection of plants of this region led him to undertake a collaboration with Charles Christopher Parry and C. G. Pringle. His herbarium was sold to Stanford University in 1917. ==References== * Parish, S. B.
