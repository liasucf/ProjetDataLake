Joseph Smith taught that the text contains the writings of the ancient biblical patriarch Joseph. From the same papyri collection, Smith produced the first part of the Book of Abraham, but was killed before any known part of the Book of Joseph was translated.Barney, Quinten The Joseph Smith Papyri and the Writings of Joseph of Egypt, Journal of Mormon History, Vol. 42, No. 2 (April 2016), pp. 95-109. Found at: https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/jmormhist.42.2.0095 The scroll associated with the Book of Joseph has been translated by Egyptologists to be a Book of the Dead, a common funerary document, and is unrelated to the biblical patriarch Joseph.Wilson, John A. The Joseph Smith Egyptian Papyri, Translations and Interpretaions; Dialogue Journal 1968. https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp- content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V03N02_69.pdf ==Background== Eleven mummies and several papyri were discovered near the ancient Egyptian city of Thebes by Antonio Lebolo between 1818 and 1822. Following Lebolo's death in 1830, the mummies and assorted objects were sent to New York with instructions that they should be sold in order to benefit the heirs of Lebolo.. Michael H. Chandler served as an agent for an investment group in Philadelphia, touring with the mummies and artifacts.. Over the next two years Chandler toured the eastern United States, displaying and selling some of the mummies as he traveled... On June 30, 1835, Chandler exhibited his collection in Kirtland, Ohio. A promotional flyer created by Chandler states that the mummies \"may have lived in the days of Jacob, Moses, or David\".. At the time, Kirtland was the home of the Latter Day Saints, led by Joseph Smith. Smithwho said he had translated the Book of Mormon from golden plates that had been inscribed with \"reformed Egyptian\" texttook an immediate interest in the papyri and soon offered Chandler a preliminary translation of the scrolls.. Smith took an immediate interest in the papyri and purchased four mummies and at least five papyrus documents.Jensen, Robin Scott, and Brian M. Hauglid, eds.

According to Smith, the scrolls contained the writings of Abraham and Joseph, as well as the history of an Egyptian princess named \"Katumin\".. Oliver Cowdery wrote, > \"...in connection with two of the bodies, were something rolled up with the > same kind of linnen, saturated with the same bitumen, which, when examined, > proved to be two rolls of papyrus, previously mentioned. I may add that two > or three other small pieces of papyrus, with astronomical calculations, > epitaphs, etc were found with others of the Mummies.\" According to Cowdery, these two scrolls contained \"...the writings of Abraham and Joseph\".Oliver Cowdery, Kirtland, OH, to William Frye, Lebanon, IL, 22 Dec. 1835 http://thebookofabraham.blogspot.com/2011/01/messenger-and-advocate- december-1835.html. John Whitmer wrote in his history about the papyri: > \"Joseph the Seer saw these records and by the revelation of Jesus Christ > could translate these records which gave an account of our forefathers, much > of which was written by Joseph of Egypt who was sold by his brethren, which > when all translated will be a pleasing history and of great value to the > Saints.\"John Whitmer, History, 1831\u2013circa 1847, in Karen Lynn Davidson, > Richard L.

Salt Lake City: Church Historian\u2019s Press, 2018. Books of the Dead were used from around 1550 BCE to around 50 BCE.Taylor, John H. (Editor), Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead: Journey through the afterlife. British Museum Press, London, 2010 Ancient Egyptians believed that the Book of the Dead assisted the deceased in navigating the afterlife. Prospective deceased would pick and choose which spells (sometimes referred to as chapters) they wanted in their book to assist them in the afterlife. As such, there is a wide variance between different versions across its long history of use. While modern scholars have cataloged the spells, and given them numbers, these numbers are artificial and would have no meaning to ancient Egyptians. The spell arrangement and textual variants are very similar to that of other early Ptolemaic era papyrus, including the Ryerson Papyrus.Wilson, John A. The Joseph Smith Egyptian Papyri, Translations and Interpretaions; Dialogue Journal 1968. https://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp- content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V03N02_69.pdf The surviving portion of the Book of the Dead for Ta-sherit-Min includes all or portions of spells 1-7, 10-14, 16, 53-54, 57, 59(?), 63, 65, 67, 70, 72, 74-77, 83, 86-89, 91, 100-101, 103-106, 110 and 125.Ritner, Robert Kriech.

Portions of the text are only known because characters were copied down. ===Relationship with Book of the Dead for Nefer-ir-nebu=== Vignette from Book of the Dead for Nefer-ir-nebu Also part of the Joseph Smith Papyri collection is a fragment of a Book of the Dead scroll for a woman named Nefer-ir-nebu. The fragment contains a vignette that matches the description given by Oliver Cowdery of a final judgement scene he said came from the Book of Joseph. > The inner end of the same roll, (Joseph's record,) presents a representation > of the judgement: At one view you behold the Savior seated upon his throne, > crowned, and holding the sceptres of righteousness and power, before whom > also, are assembled the twelve tribes of Israel, the nations, languages and > tongues of the earth, the kingdoms of the world over which satan is > represented as reigning. Michael the archangel, holding the key of the > bottomless pit, and at the same time the devil as being chained and shut up > in the bottomless pit.\"Oliver Cowdery letter to William Frye as published in > Messenger and Advocate 2/3 (December 1835):233-237 > http://thebookofabraham.blogspot.com/2011/01/messenger-and-advocate- > december-1835.html As this came from a different scroll than the TaSheritMin scroll, various explanations have been posited: * Oliver Cowdery believed the Nefer-ir-nebu vignette was part of the TaSheritMin scroll. Cowdery did not know Egyptian, and would not have been able to read the owners names' on the scrolls, so it is not unreasonable to think he could have conflated the two scrolls. * There was a similar vignette in the TaSheritMin scroll that is no longer extant. A judgement scene vignette is very common to Books of the Dead, and it is not unlikely that one was included in the TaSheritMin scroll.https://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums- static/digitalegypt/literature/religious/bd125a.htmlRitner, R.

In an 1842 sermon, Smith taught: > \"the learning of the Egyptians, and their knowledge of astronomy was no > doubt taught them by Abraham and Joseph, as their records testify, who > received it from the Lord.\"HC 2:321 Other eye-witnesses left clues as to what was on the papyrus scrolls. William W. Phelps, Joseph Smith's scribe, wrote that the Book of Joseph was written in Pharaoh's court. In a July 1835 letter to his wife he noted: > \"Last evening we received your first letter after an absence of twelve weeks > and twelve hours.... Brother Joseph [Smith] remarked that it was as easy to > shed tears while reading that letter as it was when reading the History of > Joseph in Egypt. ... The last of June four Egyptian mummies were brought > here; there were two papyrus rolls, besides some other ancient Egyptian > writings with them. As no one could translate these writings, they were > presented to President Smith. He soon knew what they were and said they, the > 'rolls of papyrus,' contained the sacred record kept of Joseph in Pharaoh's > Court in Egypt, and the teachings of Father Abraham.\"William W.

The Smith Pettit Foundation, 2013. Page 221 Oliver was a scribe to Joseph, with several translation related documents in his handwriting, and would have been intimately familiar with Joseph Smith's thoughts on the interpretation of these vignettes. As LDS Scholar Quinten Barney states, \"There is no grounds for assuming that Oliver\u2019s interpretations of the vignettes need be products of his own mind. To the contrary, Oliver\u2019s proximity to both the Prophet and the papyri strongly suggest that his interpretations of the vignettes were based on Joseph Smith\u2019s interpretations.\"Barney, Quinten The Joseph Smith Papyri and the Writings of Joseph of Egypt, Journal of Mormon History, Vol. 42, No. 2 (April 2016), pg. 104.

Donl Peterson wrote \"Oliver Cowdery's explanation of the contents of the book of Joseph, seem to have relevance with regard to the temple ceremony. ... The writings of Abraham and Joseph were purchased by the Church in July 1835 and the partial endowment was introduced to the brethren by the Prophet Joseph Smith in January 1836. Is this merely coincidental?\"Peterson, H. Donl. The Story of the Book of Abraham: Mummies, Manuscripts, and Mormonism. CFI, 2008. page 125 Bruce R.
