    "text": "Historically in Quebec, Canada, there were a number of political parties that were part of the Canadian social credit movement. There were various parties at different times with different names at the provincial level, all broadly following the social credit philosophy; at various times they had varying degrees of affiliation with the Social Credit Party of Canada at the federal level. The greatest success achieved by a provincial social credit party in Quebec was the Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste du Qu\u00e9bec, which won 12 seats in the 1970 Quebec provincial election. ==Union des \u00e9lecteurs== The Union des \u00e9lecteurs (UE) (in English: \"Union of Electors\") was founded in 1939 by Louis Even and Gilberte C\u00f4t\u00e9-Mercier. It was the first cr\u00e9ditiste political movement to be active in Quebec. It ran two candidates, Even and Armand Turpin in the 1940 federal election as part of the Canada-wide New Democracy movement. Even won 17% of the vote and placed third in the riding of Lake St-John\u2014Roberval. Turpin placed second with over 31.8% of the vote in Hull. Even and the Union attended the founding convention of the Social Credit Association of Canada in 1944 and opposed the bid of the western Canadian based Social Credit federal caucus to establish a central party under the leadership of Solon Low. While Even's group ran candidates in the 1945 federal election under the national Social Credit banner and again in subsequent by-elections, by 1949 the Quebec cr\u00e9ditistes were again running candidates under the Union des \u00e9lecteurs banner as they were also doing in the Quebec provincial elections. The Union was accused of anti-Semitism and of distributing the Protocols of the Elders of Zion in Quebec.Social Discredit: Anti-Semitism, Social Credit and the Jewish Response by Janine Stingel, page 132 The Canadian Jewish Congress referred to it as \"fast becoming the rallying point of the numerous Jew-haters in French Canada\". The Union des \u00e9lecteurs electoral philosophy was that it was not a partisan political party but an organization which marshals voters to enforce their wishes on their elected representatives.\"Shades of Mr. Aberhart\", Toronto Daily Star, July 8, 1948 Even's belief, like that of social credit originator C.H. Douglas, was that parties were corrupt and that the party system should be replaced by a \"union of electors\" who would compel elected officials to follow the popular will. Even and the Union broke with the national Social Credit organization in 1947 due to Ernest Manning's increasingly hostile attitude towards them and his purge of anti-Semites from the movement. The Union influenced some Social Crediters outside of Quebec, including the Social Credit Association of Ontario which stood its candidates in the 1948 Ontario elections under the name \"Union of Electors\". In British Columbia, there was a \"Union of Electors\" party which ran as a rival to the British Columbia Social Credit League in the 1949 provincial election. With R\u00e9al Caouette and then P. Ernest Gr\u00e9goire as leader, the Quebec provincial party contested seats in the 1944 provincial election but won no seats and the 1948 provincial election when it managed to get 9.25% of the popular vote, but again won no seats. It also ran candidates federally: Caouette was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a 1946 by-election under the Social Credit banner. He failed to win re-election in the 1949 federal election as a Union des \u00e9lecteurs candidate, when the party ran a total of 56 candidates. None were successful. The Union des \u00e9lecteurs faded away as a political party after 1949. In the 1950s, Caouette contested seats in various by-elections against the wishes of Even and C\u00f4t\u00e9-Mercier. In 1958, Caouette broke with Even and C\u00f4t\u00e9-Mercier and founded the Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes, which ran candidates in federal elections in the 1950s and 1960s and was, at times, the Quebec branch of the Social Credit Party of Canada. In 1970, the federal Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes founded a distinct provincial branch, the Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste du Qu\u00e9bec. In 1939, Even and C\u00f4t\u00e9 also founded a lay Catholic group called the \"Pilgrims of Saint Michael\", based in Rougemont, Quebec, that continues to promote social credit monetary policy coupled with conservative Catholicism. The Pilgrims publish The Michael Journal in English and Vers Demain in French. The group was founded in 1939 and is nicknamed \"the White Berets\" for the headgear worn by members. ===Federal general election results=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The 1962 candidate, J.-Edouard Pharon, received 1,800 votes \u2013 500 more than the Social Credit candidate. ==Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes du Canada== R\u00e9al Caouette had been a social credit stalwart since the joining the movement in 1939, running as a candidate for the Union des \u00e9lecteurs. He won a seat in the House of Commons in a by-election, but lost it in the next general election. He was a true believer in social credit theory and a charismatic, almost evangelical speaker. In 1958, he broke with Union des \u00e9lecteurs founders Louis Even and Gilberte C\u00f4t\u00e9-Mercier, and formed the Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes du Canada as the Quebec wing of the Social Credit Party of Canada on May 4, 1958. Caouette was named leader of the new organization. His party political broadcasts on Quebec television developed a great following. Caouette ran for the leadership of the Social Credit Party of Canada in 1961, but was defeated by Robert N. Thompson. Driven by Caouette's fiery oratory, the Social Credit Party achieved a breakthrough in the 1962 federal election, winning 26 seats in Quebec. Only four Social Credit MPs were elected in the rest of Canada. Thompson insisted on remaining national party leader after 1962, even though the Social Credit caucus was overwhelmingly from Quebec and regarded Caouette as its leader. Thompson accepted Caouette as his deputy leader. This tension led to a split: in 1963, the Quebec wing became independent from the party in the rest of country as the Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes, or Social Credit Rally in English. Of the 20 Social Credit MPs elected in Quebec in the 1963 federal election, 13 followed Caouette into the Ralliement, five ran in the next election as independents and two joined the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. The Ralliement ran as a separate party in the 1965 federal election. In 1968, Thompson joined the Progressive Conservative Party. ===General election results - Ralliement des cr\u00e9ditistes=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

In the 1968 federal election, the Social Credit Party won no seats in the House of Commons, while Caouette's Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste returned 14 MPs. In 1969, the federal Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste entered provincial politics by running candidates in four Quebec by-elections. The candidates appeared on the ballot without party designation, as the party did not run candidates in the last general election. All were defeated. A dissident group opposed to Caouette's leadership founded the Parti cr\u00e9dit social uni in this period.Ronald Lebel, \"Creditistes' entry into politics likely to be swamped by UN win,\" Globe and Mail, 25 September 1969, p. 10. The Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste du Qu\u00e9bec was created in January 1970 and fielded candidates in the 1970 and 1973 provincial elections. In 1971, Caouette and the Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste rejoined the Social Credit Party of Canada, and Caouette was elected national leader. ===General election results - Ralliement cr\u00e9ditiste=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
