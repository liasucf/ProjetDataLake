    "text": "\"Tip of My Tongue\" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Kenny Chesney. It was released in July 2019 as the first single from his 2020 album Here and Now. Chesney wrote this song with songwriter Ross Copperman and English singer Ed Sheeran, and produced it with longtime producer Buddy Cannon. ==History and content== Chesney announced the song's release in July 2019, as the lead single to an upcoming nineteenth studio album. He wrote the song with Ross Copperman and Ed Sheeran. Of the co-writing process, he told the blog Nash Country Daily that \"You start talking, and words fall out, and anything can happen. When you go in and write on any given day, the chemistry is what it is. When the idea fell out, we all just laughed and went, \u2018Well, what can we do with that?\u2019\" ==Critical reception== Taste of Country writer Billy Dukes said that the song is a \"mid-tempo, progressive- sounding track [that] places Chesney's familiar voice in a progressive new setting, creating a very contemporary track that has strong pop influences.\" Jon Freeman of Rolling Stone Country said described the song as \"a celebration of sensuality\" and said, \"Over a dreamy, percussion-free bed of guitar and synthesizer, Chesney sings of his appreciation for the little details \u2014 like the dimples in someone\u2019s back \u2014 that make him fall a little more in love with someone.\" ==Commercial performance== The song has sold 85,000 copies in the United States as of December 2019. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !
