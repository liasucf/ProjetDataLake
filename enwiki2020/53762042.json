    "text": "The gens Papinia was a plebeian family at Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned toward the end of the Republic. In imperial times, the family achieved some prominence, with Sextus Papinius Alienus holding the consulship in AD 36. The nomen Papinius is sometimes confused with the more common Papirius and Pomponius. ==Origin== Papinius appears to belong to a class of nomina derived from other names using the gentile-forming suffix -inius.Chase, pp. 125, 126. In this instance, the name seems to be derived from the Oscan nomen Papius, or its root, the cognomen Papus, indicating that the Papinii were probably of Sabine or Samnite extraction.Chase, pp. 114, 128. ==Members== * Lucius Papinius, a wealthy eques, whose property was taken by Verres.Cicero, In Verrem, iv. 21. * Papinius, the author of an epigram about Publius Servilius Casca, quoted by Varro and Priscian.Varro, De Lingua Latina, vii. 28 (ed. M\u00fcller).Priscian, p. 602 (ed. Putschius). * Papinius, a military tribune in the time of Caligula.Josephus, Antiquitates Juda\u00efcae, xix. 1. 6.PIR, vol. III, p. 10. * Sextus Papinius Q. f. Alienus, consul in AD 36, had a distinguished public career, serving as quaestor, tribune of the plebs, praetor peregrinus in AD 27, governor of one of the imperial provinces, and one of the quindecimviri sacris faciundis. Pliny reports that he introduced the jujube and another exotic fruit to Italy.Pliny the Elder, xv. 14 (also numbered xv. 47). * Sextus Papinius Sex. f. Q. n., a young man who squandered his fortune, encouraged by his mother, who raised him for many years after her divorce. When his situation became desperate, he threw himself from a window and ended his life. His mother was banished for a period of ten years, so that her younger son would be raised without her influence.Seneca the Younger, De Ira, iii. 18. * Sextus Papinius, arrested by Caligula, who tortured him in order to make him implicate others in a plot against the emperor, and then put him to death. He is sometimes supposed to be the son of the consul Papinius, although Tacitus places his death in the reign of Tiberius.Tacitus, Annales, vi. 49.Cassius Dio, lix. 25. * Publius Papinius Statius, a grammarian who received a number of prizes in literary competitions, opened a school at Neapolis circa AD 39. He was the tutor of Domitian. His wife was Agellina, and they were the parents of the poet Statius.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 902, 903 (\"Publius Papinius Statius\"). * Publius Papinius P. f. Statius, a celebrated poet who lived in the latter part of the first century. He lived at Neapolis, and benefited from the patronage of Domitian, whom he praises in his works. ==Footnotes== ==See also== * List of Roman gentes ==References== ==Bibliography== * Marcus Terentius Varro, De Lingua Latina (On the Latin Language). * Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Seneca the Younger), De Ira (On Anger). * Gaius Plinius Secundus (Pliny the Elder), Naturalis Historia (Natural History). * Flavius Josephus, Antiquitates Juda\u00efcae (Antiquities of the Jews). * Publius Cornelius Tacitus, Annales. * Lucius Cassius Dio Cocceianus (Cassius Dio), Roman History. * Priscianus Caesariensis (Priscian), Institutiones Grammaticae (Institutes of Grammar). * Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, ed., Little, Brown and Company, Boston (1849). * George Davis Chase, \"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\", in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, vol.
