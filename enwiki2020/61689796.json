The cabinet is supported by the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S) and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), along with the leftist parliamentary group Free and Equal (LeU) and, since 17 September, the centrist party Italia Viva (IV), which splintered from the PD on that day. The government has been referred to as the \"yellow-red government\" (), based on the customary colours of the main supporting parties. The Conte II Cabinet is the one with the lowest average age of its members in the history of the Italian Republic. == Supporting parties == ===Beginning of term=== At the time of the government formation, its ministers and other members were part of the following three parties. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" |- !colspan=2|Party !Position !Main ideology !Leader |- |bgcolor=\"\" | |Five Star Movement (M5S) |Big tent |Populism |Luigi Di Maio |- |bgcolor=\"\"| |Democratic Party (PD) |Centre-left |Social democracy |Nicola Zingaretti |- |bgcolor=\"\"| |Free and Equal (LeU) |Left-wing |Democratic socialism |Several leaders |} The government also obtained the support of the Associative Movement Italians Abroad (MAIE), and one of its senators, Ricardo Merlo, was appointed as undersecretary in the cabinet.Riccardo Merlo (MAIE) confermato sottosegretario agli steri The government received also the external support of the following minor parties: Popular Civic List (CP), the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), Italy in Common (IiC), the South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP) and the Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party (PATT).La Camera vota la fiducia con 343 s\u00ec, il premier replica alla Camera fra le proteste.

In August 2019, Matteo Salvini, Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the League, announced a motion of no confidence against the government, after growing tensions within the majority. Salvini's move came right after a vote in the Senate regarding the progress of the Turin\u2013Lyon high-speed railway, in which the League, along with the largest opposition parties, voted against an attempt of the M5S to block the construction works.https://www.corriere.it/politica/19_agosto_07/voto-tav-giorno-mozioni- senato-lega-vota-quella-pd-5d7ba448-b8e6-11e9-8028-c32e9be56d04.shtml Many political analysts believe the no confidence motion was an attempt to force early elections to improve his party's standing in Parliament, due to its increasing support in opinion polls, ensuring Salvini could become the next Prime Minister. On 20 August, following the parliamentary debate in which Conte harshly accused Salvini of being a political opportunist who \"had triggered the political crisis only to serve his personal interest\", the Prime Minister tendered his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella. ===Government formation=== On 21 August, Mattarella started consultations with parliamentary groups. On the same day, the national board of the Democratic Party (PD) officially and unanimously opened to the prospect of a cabinet with the M5S, based on pro-Europeanism, green economy, sustainable development, fight against economic inequality and a new immigration policy. However, the talks resulted in a unclear outcome, the President announced a second round of consultations starting on 27 August. Negotiations between PD and M5S started, while Free and Equal (LeU), a left-wing parliamentary group, announced its support too. On 28 August, PD's leader Nicola Zingaretti announced at the Quirinal Palace his favourable position on forming a new government with the Five Stars with Conte at its head. On same day, Mattarella summoned Conte to the Quirinal Palace for 29 August to give him the task of forming a new cabinet. On 3 September, M5S members voted through the so-called \"Rousseau Platform\" in favor of an agreement with the PD, with Conte Prime Minister, with more than 79% of the vote out of nearly 80,000 voters. The government at the Quirinal Palace for the oath On 4 September Conte announced the ministers of this new cabinet, which was sworn in on the following day. At its start, the government was composed of 21 ministers, 14 men and 7 women, a majority of whom are from Southern Italy. === Investiture votes === On 9 September 2019 the Chamber of Deputies approved the government with 343 votes in favour, 263 against and 3 abstentions. On the following day the Senate followed suit, with 169 in favour, 133 against and 5 abstentions. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:85%;\" |- !colspan=\"4\"|9\u201310 September 2019 Investiture votes for Conte II Cabinet |- !width=\"120\"|House of Parliament !width=\"60\"|Vote !width=\"300\"|Parties !width=\"80\" align=\"center\"|Votes |- !rowspan=\"3\" |Chamber of Deputies | Yes || || |- | No || || |- |Abstention || || |- !rowspan=\"3\"|Senate of the Republic | Yes || || |- | No || || |- |Abstention || || |} ===Italia Viva and M5S crises=== In September 2019 former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi lead a split from the PD, and formed a party called Italia Viva. The new party had two ministers (Teresa Bellanova and Elena Bonetti) and one undersecretary, and kept its support for the Conte II government. In December 2019 the Minister of Education and Research, Lorenzo Fioramonti, resigned after disagreements with the rest of the cabinet regarding the recently approved 2020 budget bill. Fioramonti considered the share of funds dedicated to education and research to be insufficient. For the designation of the new Minister, Prime Minister Conte decided to split the Ministry of Education, University and Research into two. The Ministry of Public Education went to the former undersecretary Lucia Azzolina (M5S), whereas the Ministry of University and Research went to the dean of the University of Naples Federico II, Gaetano Manfredi (Ind). In January 2020, the Five Star Movement suffered multiple parliamentary defections and a sizeable decrease in popularity with respect to the 2018 elections. Luigi Di Maio resigned from his position as M5S political leader, retaining his position as foreign minister. ===Coronavirus outbreak=== In February 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was confirmed to have spread to northern Italian regions. In a few weeks, it spread to the rest of the country, with major concentration of cases in the regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and Veneto. The government faced the subsequent health crisis by imposing gradually stricter measures of social distancing and quarantine, until finally on 9 March established a nationwide lockdown, restricting the movement of people except for reasons of necessity, health, or work. == Party breakdown == === Beginning of term === ==== Ministers ==== {| |- | * Five Star Movement | 9 |- | * Democratic Party | 9 |- | * Free and Equal | 1 |- | * Independents | 3 |} ==== Ministers and other members ==== * Five Star Movement (M5S): 9 ministers, 6 deputy ministers, 16 undersecretaries * Democratic Party (PD): 9 ministers, 4 deputy ministers, 14 undersecretaries * Free and Equal (LeU): 1 ministers, 2 undersecretaries ** Article One (Art.1): 1 minister, 1 undersecretary ** Italian Left (SI): 1 undersecretary * Associative Movement Italians Abroad (MAIE): 1 undersecretary * Independents: Prime minister, 2 ministers === Current === ==== Ministers ==== {| |- | * Five Star Movement | 9 |- | * Democratic Party | 7 |- | * Italia Viva | 2 |- | * Free and Equal | 1 |- | * Independents | 4 |} ==== Ministers and other members ==== * Five Star Movement (M5S): 9 ministers, 6 deputy ministers, 15 undersecretaries * Democratic Party (PD): 7 ministers, 4 deputy ministers, 13 undersecretaries * Italia Viva (IV): 2 ministers, 1 undersecretary * Free and Equal (LeU): 1 ministers, 2 undersecretaries ** Article One (Art.1): 1 minister, 1 undersecretary ** Italian Left (SI): 1 undersecretary * Associative Movement Italians Abroad (MAIE): 1 undersecretary * Independents: Prime minister, 3 ministers == Geographical breakdown == === Beginning of term === A choropleth map showing the number of ministers from each region. *Northern Italy: 8 ministers **Emilia-Romagna: 2 ministers **Friuli-Venezia Giulia: 1 minister **Lombardy: 2 ministers **Piedmont: 2 ministers **Veneto: 1 minister *Central Italy: 2 ministers **Lazio: 2 ministers *Southern and Insular Italy: 12 ministers (including Conte) **Apulia: 3 ministers (including Conte) **Basilicata: 2 ministers **Campania: 4 ministers **Sicily: 3 ministers === Current === *Northern Italy: 8 ministers **Emilia-Romagna: 2 ministers **Friuli-Venezia Giulia: 1 minister **Lombardy: 2 ministers **Piedmont: 2 ministers **Veneto: 1 minister *Central Italy: 1 minister **Lazio: 1 minister *Southern and Insular Italy: 14 ministers (including Conte) **Apulia: 3 ministers (including Conte) **Basilicata: 2 ministers **Campania: 5 ministers **Sicily: 4 ministers == Council of Ministers == The Council of Ministers is composed of the following members: {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" |- !Office !Name !colspan=2|Party !Term |- |colspan=\"5\"| |- !Prime Minister |Giuseppe Conte |bgcolor=\"\" | |Independent | |- |colspan=\"5\"| |- !|Minister of Foreign Affairs |{{nowrap|Luigi Di Maio |bgcolor=\"\"| |Five Star Movement | |- !Minister of the Interior |Luciana Lamorgese |bgcolor=\"\"| |Independent | |- !Minister of Justice |Alfonso Bonafede |bgcolor=\"\"| |Five Star Movement | |- !Minister of Defence |Lorenzo Guerini |bgcolor=\"\"| |Democratic Party | |- !Minister of Economy and Finance |Roberto Gualtieri |bgcolor=\"\"| |Democratic Party | |- !Minister of Economic Development |Stefano Patuanelli |bgcolor=\"\" | |Five Star Movement | |- !Minister of Agriculture |Teresa Bellanova |bgcolor=\"\"| |Democratic Party / Italia Viva | |- !Minister of the Environment |Sergio Costa |bgcolor=\"\"| |Independent | |- !Minister of Infrastructure and Transport |Paola De Micheli |bgcolor=\"\"| |Democratic Party | |- !Minister of Labour and Social Policies |Nunzia Catalfo |bgcolor=\"\"| |Five Star Movement | |- !
