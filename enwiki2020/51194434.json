He arrived in the R\u00edo de la Plata from C\u00e1diz in 1670, aboard the ship \"San Hermenegildo\". Riglos was one of the richest men in the R\u00edo de la Plata to early 18th century. Installed in Buenos Aires he dedicated himself to the trade and import of leather, being in charge of the business of cimarron cattle of Buenos Aires Province. He had among his possessions a luxurious carriage with golden studs, and a stained glass window inside. He also built a luxurious house known as the \"Altos de Riglos\", the first house on two floors of Buenos Aires, located at the current corner Bolivar and Avenida Rivadavia, neighborhood Monserrat. Riglos also owned a sumptuous residence (la Mes\u00f3n del Retiro) in the Retiro area. This residence was rented in 1703 to the Compagnie Royale de Guin\u00e9e, a French \"company\" that had operated in Buenos Aires until 1712. Years later in 1718 Riglos sold his property to Thomas Dover, president of the South Sea Company in Buenos Aires. \"La Casa del Retiro\" was located in the current Plaza San Mart\u00edn, and his first owner was the Governor of Buenos Aires Don Agust\u00edn de Robles Lorenzana, who had sold it to Miguel de Riglos around 1700. In addition to having served as commander of the Fort of Buenos Aires, he held honorary offices in the city of Buenos Aires, serving as regidor and mayor of second vote in 1682 and 1708. Miguel de Riglos was the ancestor of Mar\u00eda de los Remedios de Escalada, the wife of General don Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn. His grandson Miguel Ferm\u00edn de Riglos was a knight of the Order of Santiago. == References == == External links == *familysearch.org *www.euskonews.com *www.genealogiafamiliar.net Category:1649 births Category:1719 deaths Category:Navarrese people Category:17th-century Spanish businesspeople Category:18th-century Argentine people Category:Spanish colonial governors and administrators Category:Mayors of Buenos Aires Category:18th-century Spanish businesspeople ",
