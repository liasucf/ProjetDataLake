With the title, he jumped to the 235th place in the world ranking, and became the third best tennis player in Brazil at the moment, behind only Thiago Monteiro and Jo\u00e3o Menezes. ===2020: Wildcards and first ATP 250 title=== In February 2020, he received wildcard to participate in the ATP 500 in Rio de Janeiro, where he defeated the Spaniard top 100 Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in three sets (5\u20137, 7\u20136 (7\u20133) and 7\u20135) in the first round, in the longest match in the history of the tournament (3 hours and 49 minutes). In the next round, he faced world number 32 Borna \u0106ori\u0107, losing in the third set tiebreak. With this result, he entered the world top 200 for the first time on February 24, moving to 182nd position in the ranking. In the following week, invited as a wildcard to the ATP 250 in Santiago, the Wild had his best campaign: he defeated Facundo Bagnis, Juan Ignacio Londero (world No. 63) and in the quarterfinals, the top seed of the tournament, and champion of the Rio Open, the Chilean Cristian Gar\u00edn, ranking No. 18, who retired after losing the first set in a tiebreak. In the semifinals he defeated Renzo Olivo in straight sets becoming the youngest Brazilian to reach a final at this level, surpassing the achievements of former world number 1 Gustavo Kuerten, then aged 20, and of Jaime Oncins and Thomaz Bellucci, at 21 years old. He also became the first Brazilian to compete in an ATP level final since Bellucci was runner-up in Houston in April 2017. In the final, he defeated Norwegian Casper Ruud (ranked No. 38 and champion of the Argentina Open two weeks before), in three sets, becoming champion at 19 years old, surpassing Kuerten, who won his first ATP title at the age of 20. Wild is also the youngest tennis player to win a title in the Latin American clay court since Rafael Nadal won Acapulco in 2005, at the age of 18.
