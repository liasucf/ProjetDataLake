    "text": "Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (published in America as Smilla's Sense of Snow) (Danish: Fr\u00f8ken Smillas fornemmelse for sne) is a 1992 novel by Danish author Peter H\u00f8eg. It was translated into English by Tiina Nunnally (credited as \"F. David\" in the British edition). ==Title== During her Greenland childhood, Smilla developed an almost intuitive understanding of all types of snow and their characteristics. As an adult, she worked for a time as a scientist whose speciality was snow and ice. Her certainty about the manner of a child\u2019s death is due to this visceral \"feeling for snow\". ==Background== The novel is ostensibly a work of detection and a thriller, although beneath the surface of the novel, H\u00f8eg is concerned with rather deeper cultural issues, particularly Denmark's curious post-colonial history, and also the nature of relationships that exist between individuals and the societies in which they are obliged to operate. The protagonist Smilla Qaaviqaaq Jaspersen is a sympathetic and useful vehicle in this respect, her deceased mother being Greenlandic Inuit and her father a rich Danish doctor. Having been brought in childhood from the poverty and freedom of Greenland to the affluent and highly ordered society of Denmark, Smilla's relationship with Denmark and Danish society is strained and ambivalent. Smilla investigates the death of a neighbour\u2019s child whom she had befriended\u2014a fellow Greenlander, with an alcoholic, neglectful mother and a mysteriously deceased father. The story begins in Copenhagen, where the child has fallen to his death from the snowy rooftop of an old warehouse. The police refuse to consider it anything but an accident\u2014there is only one set of footprints (the child's) in the snow leading to the edge of the roof\u2014but Smilla believes there is something about the footprints that shows that the boy was chased off the roof. Her investigations lead her to decades-old conspiracies in Copenhagen, and then to a voyage on an icebreaker ship to a remote island off the Greenlandic coast, where the truth is finally discovered. But the book ends unresolved, with no firm conclusion. == Plot == Smilla Qaaviqaaq Jaspersen, 37-year-old product of the stormy union of a female Inuit hunter and a rich urban Danish physician, is a loner who struggles to live with her fractured heritage. Living alone in a dreary apartment complex in Christianshavn, Copenhagen, she befriends Isaiah, the neglected son of her alcoholic neighbour, because he too is Greenlandic and not truly at home in Denmark. Smilla's friendship with Isaiah, recounted in the novel in flashback, gives some meaning to her otherwise lonely life. Isaiah\u2019s sudden death is explained officially as a fall from the roof whilst playing, but Smilla\u2019s understanding of the tracks the child left on the snowy roof convinces her that this is untrue. She complains to the police and quickly encounters obstruction and hostility from the authorities and other sources. Working with Peter, a mechanic neighbour who had also known and liked Isaiah, and with whom she begins an affair despite her fear of dependency, Smilla discovers that there is a conspiracy centred on Gela Alta (a possible reference to the Latin verb gelo, \"to freeze\", and the places called Alta in North Norway or Alta Lake in Canada or the feminine Latin adjective alta, \"high, deep\"), an isolated glaciated island off Greenland. Previous expeditions have found something there (Isaiah\u2019s father was a diver who died on one of them, allegedly in an accident) and now plans are afoot to return for it. Isaiah\u2019s death is linked to this conspiracy in some way. After a long journey of discovery in Copenhagen, during which she learns that the mechanic is not who he says he is, Smilla braves intimidation and threats and eventually gets on board the ship chartered for the mysterious expedition to Gela Alta, ostensibly as a stewardess. The final action takes place on the ship and the island. Smilla is held in deep suspicion by the ship's crew\u2014who turn out to be all in some way compromised and in the pay of the mysterious T\u00f8rk Hviid, who is the expedition's real leader. Despite repeated attempts on her life by crew members, who assume she is from the authorities, Smilla doggedly pursues the truth, even when she discovers that Peter has deceived and betrayed her. The secret of the island is revealed to be a meteorite embedded in the glacier, certainly uniquely valuable\u2014perhaps even alive in some way. However, the water surrounding it is infested with a lethal parasite related to the Guinea worm, which is what really killed Isaiah\u2019s father. Isaiah was forced off the roof because he had accompanied his father on the previous expedition and had evidence of the meteorite\u2019s location\u2014and the parasite itself was actually dormant in his body. When Smilla learns that T\u00f8rk Hviid had chased Isaiah off the roof to his death, she pursues him out onto the frozen sea. He tries to reach the ship and force it to sail away, but Smilla chases him, using her intuitive ice-sense to head him off, out into isolation and danger. Here the novel ends. ==Film adaptation== The film, Smilla's Sense of Snow was released in the United Kingdom under the original novel title in 1997, starring Julia Ormond, Jim Broadbent, Gabriel Byrne, Richard Harris, J\u00fcrgen Vogel, Mario Adorf and Tom Wilkinson, directed by Bille August. There were some changes to the plot, especially having a more conclusive end in which the villain T\u00f8rk Hviid gets killed, instead of the book's deliberately ambiguous ending. ==Awards and nominations== * Winner of the Crime Writers' Association Silver Dagger Award in 1994. * Shortlisted for an Edgar Award in 1994. == See also == * ALH84001 - a meteorite which shows structures that some scientists think could be fossilised bacteria-like life forms when observed through an electron microscope. * Greenlandic people in Denmark * Scandinavian noir ==References== ==External links== * Miss Smilla's Feeling for Snow (UK translation - ) * Smilla's Sense of Snow (US translation - ) by Peter Hoeg * * \"A Tale of Two Smillas\" (Google doc) Kirsten Malmkj\u00e6r, Centre for Research in Translation, Middlesex University * Poddar, Prem and Cheralyn Mealor (1999) 'Danish Imperial Fantasies: Smilla's Feeling for Snow' in Translating Nations, Aarhus University Press.
