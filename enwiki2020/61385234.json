    "text": "Gene-environment interplay, also known as nature-nurture interplay, is a term encompassing multiple ways that genes and environments work together to produce phenotypic traits. Processes classified as examples of gene- environment interplay include gene-environment interaction, gene-environment correlation, epigenetics, and modifications of the heritability of traits by environmental factors. It is often studied with behavioral genetic research designs like twin, family, and adoption studies. ==References== Category:Genetics terms ",
