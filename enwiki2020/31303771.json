When the investigation of a high-profile studio president is going nowhere, the case is handed over to two experienced detectives, Al Mackey (Garner) and Marty Welborn (Lithgow). For this case, however, they need help, which they receive from a pair of vice cops called the Ferret and the Weasel and a pair of street cops commonly referred to as the Street Monsters, due to their fondness for violence. ==Cast== *James Garner ...
