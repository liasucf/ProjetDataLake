    "text": "A.M. is the debut studio album by the American alternative rock band Wilco, released on March 28, 1995, by Sire Records and Reprise Records. The album was released only months after the breakup of Uncle Tupelo, an alternative country band that was the predecessor of Wilco. Prior to its release, there was debate about whether the album would be better than the debut album of Son Volt, the new band of former Uncle Tupelo lead singer Jay Farrar. Although A.M. was released before Son Volt's Trace, critical reviews were modest and initial sales were low. The album was later regarded as a \"failure\" by band members, as Trace was a greater success. It was the band's last album to be recorded in a purely alternative country style, as following the record the band began to expand their sound across multiple genres. It is also the only Wilco album to feature Brian Henneman of The Bottle Rockets as a lead guitarist. ==Background and recording== Uncle Tupelo's final album, Anodyne, featured a new lineup for the band\u2014a five-piece outfit with drummer Ken Coomer, bassist John Stirratt, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston.Kot 2004. p. 73\u201375 Tensions mounted between singers Jay Farrar and Jeff Tweedy, and Uncle Tupelo played its last concert on May 1, 1994, at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis, Missouri. Last accessed June 8, 2007.Kot 2004. p. 77 Only days after the breakup, Tweedy decided to form a new group. He was able to retain the lineup of Uncle Tupelo sans Farrar, and rechristened the band Wilco. In mid-May, the band began to rehearse songs in the office of band manager Tony Margherita, and hired producer Brian Paulson, who produced Anodyne. Wilco first recorded demo tracks for the album at Easley studio in Memphis, Tennessee, in June.Kot 2004. p. 89 Stirratt recommended the studio based on previous experience as a member of The Hilltops, and Tweedy had heard of the studio through a Jon Spencer Blues Explosion recording. Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, signed Jeff Tweedy after hearing the tapes, and recording for the album continued through August.Kot 2004. p. 91Only Jeff Tweedy was signed to the label, gaining exclusive rights to publishing royalties. However, Tweedy did split a portion of these royalties with the band. See Kot 2004 p. 92. Jeff Tweedy was preoccupied with trying to establish Wilco as a viable band on the Reprise label and decided to add another guitarist to the band. Brian Henneman, the lead singer for The Bottle Rockets, was brought into the recording sessions as a lead guitarist.Kot 2004. p. 92 Steel guitarist Lloyd Maines and bassist Daniel Corrigan also contributed to the album. Corrigan also photographed the band for the liner booklet. Howie Weinberg mastered the album, while Barbara Longo provided graphic design.A.M. album notes, March 28, 1995. Reprise Records. Brian Henneman had to leave the band shortly after recording the album, and was replaced by former Titanic Love Affair guitarist Jay Bennett.Kot 2004. p. 94\u20135 Tweedy also attempted to create a more collaborative environment than Uncle Tupelo, requesting songwriting contributions from other members. John Stirratt submitted three songs, hoping to become a secondary songwriter for Wilco. However, although the songs were recorded as demos, only one (\"It's Just That Simple\") was selected to appear on the album, and was the only Stirratt song, and the only song by Wilco not to have lyrics written by Tweedy, to appear on any Wilco album. The album's title is intended to reference Top 40 radio stations, and the tracks reflect a straightforward country-rock sound. The band members felt that they needed to establish themselves outside of the Tupelo fanbase. However, Tweedy later stated that in actuality, they were \"trying to tread some water with a perceived audience.\" Tweedy wrote a song about the Uncle Tupelo breakup, but decided that he didn't want any material on that subject matter to appear on the album. (It can be argued, however, that first single \"Box Full of Letters\", as well as \"Too Far Apart\" allude to the dissolution of Farrar and Tweedy's friendship and working relationship.) Critic and author Greg Kot wrote in Wilco: Learning How to Die that \"Tweedy's voice and personality are as modest as the arrangements; there's little sense of drama, and virtually no hint of risk. Tweedy attributes some of the straightforwardness of the album to his abuse of marijuana at the time. Shortly after the album, Tweedy stopped smoking pot, to which he credits the introspectiveness of further albums.Kot 2004. p. 96 While Wilco was recording tracks, Jay Farrar formed a band of his own, Son Volt.The band was briefly known as Grain before Trace was completed. Son Volt signed to Warner Bros. Records and began recording their first album (also produced by Paulson), Trace, in November 1994. The fact that both Wilco and Son Volt began working on album almost immediately after the Uncle Tupelo breakup caused debate among critics, fans, and Warner Brothers about which would be the better band.Kot 2004. p. 90 Joe McEwen, who originally signed Uncle Tupelo to a Warner subsidiary, felt that Wilco was taking a step backwards from the material on Anodyne. McEwen urged Richard Dodd, who had recently mixed Tom Petty's Wildflowers, to remix the album. Dodd emphasized Tweedy's vocals to increase the chances of success on radio.Kot 2004. p. 93 Wilco began touring before the album was released. Their live debut was on November 27, 1994, at Cicero's Basement Bar in St. Louis, a venue where Uncle Tupelo had first received significant media attention. The band was billed for that concert as Black Shampoo, a reference to a 1970s B-movie, and the show sold out. Wilco continued to tour for two hundred shows, culminating in show at the South by Southwest Music Conference in Austin, Texas, in March 1995. A.M. was released on Reprise Records on March 28, 1995. ==Commercial and critical reception== A.M. received modest reviews from critics. Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone called the album \"one hell of a country-guts debut\", praising the influence of Gram Parsons and Neil Young on the music. However, the album still received a moderate three-and-a-half star rating. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a three-star honorable mention, but called it \"realist defiance grinding sadly down into realist bathos.\" The Village Voice placed the album at position 34 on the 1995 Pazz & Jop critics poll. Last accessed July 9, 2007. The band was disappointed by the critical reception, since Trace was met with better reviews.Kot 2004. p. 97 According to Henneman: A.M. only hit number 27 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart, whereas Trace peaked at number 116 on the Billboard 200; by 1997, Trace had outsold A.M. two-to- one. Wilco released \"Box Full of Letters\" as a single, but it received little airplay. For the only time in Wilco's career, ticket sales failed to meet expectations. As of 2003, the album had sold about 150,000 copies.Kot 2004. p. 125 ==Track listing== All songs written by Jeff Tweedy unless otherwise noted. #\"I Must Be High\" \u2013 2:59 #\"Casino Queen\" \u2013 2:45 #\"Box Full of Letters\" \u2013 3:05 #\"Shouldn't Be Ashamed\" \u2013 3:28 #\"Pick Up the Change\" \u2013 2:56 #\"I Thought I Held You\" \u2013 3:49 #\"That's Not the Issue\" \u2013 3:19 #\"It's Just That Simple\" (John Stirratt) \u2013 3:45 #\"Should've Been in Love\" \u2013 3:36 #\"Passenger Side\" \u2013 3:33 #\"Dash 7\" \u2013 3:29 #\"Blue Eyed Soul\" \u2013 4:05 #\"Too Far Apart\" \u2013 3:44 ==Personnel== *Jeff Tweedy \u2013 lead vocals (1\u20137, 9\u201313), rhythm guitar (1, 3, 13), acoustic guitar (2, 4\u20137, 9\u201312), bass guitar (8) *John Stirratt \u2013 bass guitar (1\u20137, 9, 10, 12, 13), piano (6), organ (13), backing vocals (2, 3, 6), lead vocals/acoustic guitar (8) *Ken Coomer \u2013 drums (1\u20136, 8\u201310, 12, 13), backing vocals/cowbell (2), a snare drum played with a brush (7) *Max Johnston \u2013 dobro (1, 3, 9, 13), fiddle (2, 10), mandolin (4, 8, 10, 12), banjo (5\u20137), backing vocals (2) *Brian Henneman \u2013 lead guitar (1\u20139, 12, 13), small stoned guitar (10), backing vocals (2) *Daniel Corrigan \u2013 backing vocals (2) *Lloyd Maines \u2013 pedal steel guitar (1, 6, 8, 11, 12) *Wilco, Brian Henneman and Daniel Corrigan \u2013 handclaps, crowd noise, glass cheers (2) ===Production=== *Daniel Corrigan \u2013 photography *James SK W\u0101n - wardrobe *Richard Dodd \u2013 mixing *Barbara Longo \u2013 design *Brian Paulson \u2013 producer, engineer, mixing *Howie Weinberg \u2013 mastering *Wilco \u2013 producer, engineer *Bob Andrews \u2013 Production Coordinator ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1995 debut albums Category:Wilco albums Category:Albums produced by Brian Paulson Category:Reprise Records albums Category:Sire Records albums Category:Albums produced by Jeff Tweedy ",
