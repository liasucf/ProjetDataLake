However, he had previously converted the home into an SCI, a private, limited company to be used for rental purposes. The 30 percent allowance does not apply to SCI holdings. Once this was revealed, Carrez declared, \"if the tax authorities think that I should pay the wealth tax, I won't argue.\" At the time, Carrez was one of more than 60 French parliamentarians battling with the tax offices over 'dodgy' asset declarations. ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:HEC Paris alumni Category:\u00c9cole nationale d'administration alumni Category:Politicians from Paris Category:Rally for the Republic politicians Category:Union for a Popular Movement politicians Category:The Republicans (France) politicians Category:Mayors of places in \u00cele-de-France Category:Deputies of the 12th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 13th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 14th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 15th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic ",
