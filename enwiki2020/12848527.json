    "text": "Dual Plover is a pioneering independent Australian record label, founded in Sydney in 1996, notable for discovering some of the most enigmatic artists in experimental music. Founded by Lucas Abela and Swerve Harris, Dual Plover are concerned with releasing audio works by people whose work is outside of current trends, be it pop trends or the so-called avant-garde music trends. Dual Plover's first release 'a kombi - music to drive-by' consisted of recordings from a Volkswagen Kombi van originally recorded at picturesque Waverley Cemetery in September 1994. From 1996 onwards they have also been manufacturing CDs and DVDs as well as touring artists such as Kevin Blechdom, Al Duval and many others, both in their native Australia as well as internationally. == Notable artists from past and present == * Al Duval * Alternahunk * Bradbury * Deerhoof * Deano Merino * Justice Yeldham And The Dynamic Ribbon Device * Mascara Sue * Merzbow * Naked On The Vague * New Waver * Noise Ramones * Peeled Hearts Paste * Singing Sadie * Sister Gwen McKay * Sweden (artist) * Suicidal Rap Orgy * Spazmodics * Toxic Lipstick * Volvox (band) * Winner (band) == See also == * List of record labels * List of experimental music record labels * :Category:Australian record labels * Dual Plover albums * Experimental music == References == *http://www.realtimearts.net/article/issue74/8194 *https://web.archive.org/web/20110614152413/http://www.cyclicdefrost.com/review.php?review=15 == External links == * Dual Plover \u2013 Official site * pLOVER Downloads Free Music Archive Curators Page * pLOVER Myspace \u2013 Official Myspace * channel at YouTube * Dual Plover at Discogs.com Category:Experimental music record labels Category:Australian independent record labels Category:Record labels established in 1996 ",
