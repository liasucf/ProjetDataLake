The Hancock County wind energy center in Iowa The great majority of wind turbines around the world belong to individuals or corporations who use them to generate electric power or to perform mechanical work. As such, wind turbines are primarily designed to be working devices. However, the large size and height above surroundings of modern industrial wind turbines, combined with their moving rotors, often makes them among the most conspicuous objects in their areas. A few localities have exploited the attention-getting nature of wind turbines by placing them on public display, either with visitor centers on their bases, or with viewing areas farther away. The wind turbines themselves are generally of conventional horizontal-axis, three-bladed design, and generate power to feed electrical grids, but they also serve the unconventional roles of technology demonstration, public relations, and education. ==Notable wind turbines on public display== * Australia ** Blayney Wind Farm, New South Wales has a viewing area and interpretive centre ** Wattle Point Wind Farm, South Australia has an information centre * Canada **OPG 7 commemorative turbine is a Vestas V80-1.8MW wind turbine on the site of the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station ** Toronto Hydro - WindShare features a Lagerwey Wind model LW 52 wind turbine at Exhibition Place * China ** Inner Mongolia's Huitengxile Wind Farm has 14 visitor centers to accommodate wind power tourists to the remote region * Hong Kong ** Lamma Winds in Hong Kong has a single Nordex N50/800 kW model with a rotor diameter of 50m and a nameplate capacity of 800 kW * New Zealand ** Brooklyn, Wellington, New Zealand has a 230 kW wind turbine * United Kingdom ** Green Britain Centre, Swaffham, Norfolk - the only wind turbine in the UK that is open for the public to climb.
