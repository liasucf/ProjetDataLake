    "text": "Lebu Group is stratigraphic unit of Arauco Basin in south-central Chile. The group consists of a sequence of four formations, of both marine and nonmarine origin, deposited between the Early Paleocene and Middle Eocene. == Description == The group is made up of four formations, from youngest to oldest these are: Millongue Formation, Trihueco Formation, Boca Lebu Formation and Curanilahue Formation. The Eocene Millongue Formation is composed of shale and siltstone of both marine and continental origin. Its top is marked by an unconformity, the so-called \u201cmain unconformity\u201d of Arauco Basin, which is thought to have formed by erosion during a period of tectonic inversion. == Notes == == References == Category:Geologic groups of South America Category:Geologic formations of Chile Category:Paleocene Series of South America Category:Eocene Series of South America Category:Paleogene Chile Category:Danian Stage Category:Selandian Stage Category:Thanetian Stage Category:Ypresian Stage Category:Lutetian Stage Category:Bartonian Stage Category:Shale formations Category:Sandstone formations Category:Siltstone formations Category:Mudstone formations Category:Coal formations Category:Geology of Biob\u00edo Region ",
