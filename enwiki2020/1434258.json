    "text": "Orleans is an American drama television series created by Toni Graphia and John Sacret Young, that aired on CBS from January 7 through April 10, 1997. It ran for 8 episodes. The series was said to be inspired by the experiences of creator/producer Toni Graphia, who was the daughter of a Louisiana judge. ==Synopsis== The show was centered on the character of Judge Luther Charbonnet, portrayed by Larry Hagman. He was a judge seated in New Orleans and had a family that consisted of some wildly different characters. One of the sons was an assistant district attorney, another son was a police officer, and a daughter who ran a casino. An overall backstory to the series was that Judge Luther had another daughter who was missing or had been dead for years, and he had a search going on for information on her. Several \"taboo\" subjects were touched on this series, including interracial relationships (Judge Luther had a black girlfriend) and incest (the daughter had a relationship with her cousin). The show was promoted heavily before it had aired in early 1997 However, the ratings were not great, and it was quickly moved to Friday nights in the same slot Hagman's previous series Dallas dominated for CBS. Sadly, this would not be the case with Orleans and the series was cancelled at the end of its 1st season. ==Cast== *Larry Hagman.....Judge Luther Charbonnet *Michael Reilly Burke.....Jesse Charbonnet *Vanessa Bell Calloway.....Rosalee Clark *Brett Cullen.....Clade Charbonnet *Colleen Flynn.....Paulette Charbonnet *Lynette Walden.....Rene Doucette *O'Neal Compton.....Curtis Manzant *Charles Durning.....Frank Vitelli *Richard Fancy.....Vincent Carraze *Jerry Hardin.....Leon Gillenwater *Melora Hardin.....Gina Vitelli *Cotter Smith.....Bill Brennecke ==Episode list== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"background:#fff;\" |- ! style=\"background:#;\"| No. ! style=\"background:#;\"| Title ! style=\"background:#;\"| Directed by ! style=\"background:#;\"| Written by ! style=\"background:#;\"| Original air date |} ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background- color: #BCBCBC\" | Year ! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\" | Award ! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\" | Result ! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\" | Category ! style=\"background-color: #BCBCBC\" | Recipient |- | 1997 || Emmy Award || Nominated || Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore) || David Langley Hamilton (For pilot episode) |- | 1998 || NAACP Image Awards || Nominated || Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series || Vanessa Bell Calloway |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Page on Larry Hagman's Site Category:1990s American drama television series Category:1997 American television series debuts Category:1997 American television series endings Category:1990s American legal television series Category:English- language television shows Category:CBS original programming Category:Television shows set in New Orleans Category:Fictional portrayals of the New Orleans Police Department ",
