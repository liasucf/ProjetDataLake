As a manager, he led the 1950 Philadelphia Phillies \u2014 the \"Whiz Kids\", as the youthful club was known \u2014 to the second National League championship in team history. ==A scholar-athlete== Born in Westerly, Rhode Island, Sawyer was a minor league outfielder in his playing days who batted and threw right-handed; he was listed as tall and . A rarity among baseball people of his era, Sawyer held an advanced degree from an Ivy League university: a master's degree in biology and physiology from Cornell.Roberts, Robin, and C. Paul Rogers III (1996). The Whiz Kids and the 1950 Pennant. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. p. 122. He had earned an undergraduate degree from Ithaca College, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and later taught biology in the off-season.Silary, Ted (September 23, 1997). \"Manager of Whiz Kids Dies at 87\". Philadelphia Daily News. Sawyer signed a contract to play in the New York Yankees' deep farm system in 1934. He reached the highest minor-league level in 1937 with the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, but soon turned to managing in the Bronx Bombers' system.Honig, Daniel (1990). The Man in the Dugout: Fifteen Big League Managers Speak Their Minds. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press. p. 59. In 1939, his first year as a player-manager with the Amsterdam Rugmakers in the Class C Canadian\u2013American League, Sawyer led the Rugmakers to a first-place finish and batted .369 with 103 runs batted in.Pietrusza, David (1990).

Concurrently, the Phillies were being transfused with young blood, bringing to the majors many of the players who would become the Whiz Kids: Robin Roberts, Richie Ashburn, Del Ennis, Granny Hamner, Willie Jones, Curt Simmons, Bubba Church and others. Sawyer, a patient man accustomed to working with young players, was an ideal choice to mold the Phillies into a cohesive outfit.Roberts and Rogers 1996, pp. 273-74. He masterfully blended the youngsters with veterans such as Jim Konstanty, Dick Sisler, Andy Seminick and Eddie Waitkus.

Sawyer had designed it after concluding that \u201cthe old uniforms were terrible looking.\u201dRoberts and Rogers 1996, pp. 217-18. The NL pennant was up for grabs that season. The 1949 champion Brooklyn Dodgers suffered from pitching troubles and the outbreak of the Korean War had disrupted Major League rosters. The Phillies charged into the league lead and, despite a late- September tailspin, partially caused by the loss of Simmons to military service, they held off Brooklyn in the season's final game as Sisler's tenth- inning home run sealed a 4-1 victory.

The 1951 Phillies lost 18 games from their previous year's standard and fell to fifth.Roberts and Rogers 1996, p. 345. In 1952, with the team in sixth place and seven games below .500, Sawyer was replaced as skipper on June 27 by Steve O'Neill.Webster, Gary (2014). When in Doubt, Fire the Skipper: Midseason Managerial Changes in Major League Baseball. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. p. 89. ==An unsuccessful encore== He was out of baseball until the middle of the 1958 season. On July 22, with the team in seventh place, the Phillies fired Mayo Smith and brought Sawyer back to manage.Webster 2014, p. 99.
