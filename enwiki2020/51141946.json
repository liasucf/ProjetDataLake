    "text": "San Giovanni Nuovo (also known as San Zan Novo or San Zaninovo) is a Roman Catholic church in the campo of the same name, in the sestiere of Castello. ==History== A church at the site was present by the 10th century, but the fa\u00e7ade, which remains mostly incomplete, was rebuilt in 1762 using designs by Matteo Lucchesi. The interior has a nave defined by corinthian columns. There are two lateral chapels. The main altar has a canvas depicting St John Evangelist Martyred by boiling in cauldron of oil by Francesco Maggiotto. It is flanked by two smaller paintings, a Sacrifice of Abraham and of Melchisedech, painted by Fabio Canal. In the second lateral chapel is a 14th- century polychrome wood crucifix. The bell-tower dates from the earlier church. ==Bibliography== * Giulio Lorenzetti, Venezia e il suo estuario, ristampa 1974, Edizioni Lint Trieste, pag. 320. *Derived from Italian Wikipedia entry.
