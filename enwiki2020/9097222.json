    "text": "Saint Elisabeth of Hungary is sometimes reputed to have ordered the first modern perfume in Europe, called 'Hungary water'. Hungary water (sometimes called \"the Queen of Hungary's Water\", Eau de la Reine de Hongary, or \"spirits of rosemary\") was one of the first alcohol-based perfumes in Europe, primarily made with rosemary. The oldest surviving recipes call for distilling fresh rosemary and thyme with brandy, while later formulations contain wine, lavender, mint, sage, marjoram, costus, orange blossom and lemon. == Origins == The exact date of the invention of Hungary water is lost to history, though some sources say it dates to 1370 or the late 14th century.

According to legend, it was formulated at the command of the Queen Elizabeth of Hungary, sometimes identified as Queen Isabella of HungaryHistorically, the name Isabella was a variant of Elisabeth, and in the period in question the two were sometimes interchangeable. or in one document \"Saint Elisabeth, Queen of Hungary\".This may be a conflation of multiple individuals. Some sources say that a hermit or monk-recluse first gave it to the Queen of Hungary, though most likely it was made by a court alchemist or a monk-alchemist.

The only plausible Queen Isabella (late 13th century) likewise seems to be too early to be a strong candidate, as the invention of this water is most probably related to the Black Death epidemic that ravaged Europe between 1346 and 1350 caused by a bacterial infection. This could potentially be due to the antibacterial effects found in the wine or brandy and rosemary that was used to make the water. == Spread through Europe == According to legends, Hungary water first appeared outside of Hungary in 1370 when Charles V of France, who was famous for his love of fragrances, received some. Its use was popular across Europe for many centuries, and until Eau de Cologne appeared in the 18th century, it was the most popular fragrance and remedy applied. === French Hungary water === By the 18th century, French Hungary water from Montpellier was being touted over other variations of Hungary water, because of the quality of the rosemary used in the distillation. Advertisements in newspapers even warned against counterfeit versions of French Hungary water, explaining to potential buyers how to detect the difference in quality. == Medicinal Use == Hungary water was used during the late 17th century as a form of medicine. It was believed to have many uses such as helping to relieve a headache, toothache, or ringing ears.
