After the 2008 season, Gonzalez was named the Sporting News Manager of the Year.

It was a 6\u20133 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2012 National League Wild Card Game at Turner Field. Gonz\u00e1lez put this game under protest after the infield fly rule was called by umpire Sam Holbrook on a ball that fell in shallow left field in the bottom of the eighth inning. Gonz\u00e1lez earned his first major league postseason win on October 4, 2013, in a 4\u20133 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers at Turner Field in Game 2 of the National League Division Series.
