Wanamaker appears briefly during Cassandra's second appearance, seen in footage from a party when she was still in her full body. The Ninth Doctor first encountered Cassandra, an extensively modified human who had been reduced to little more than a sentient sheet of skin held taut on a life support frame, in the episode \"The End of the World\" (2005). She returned in \"New Earth\" (2006), which took place 23 years after \"The End of the World\". ===Celestial Toymaker=== ===Mavic Chen=== Mavic Chen is the Guardian of the Solar System in the year 4000 AD and a collaborator with the Daleks. ===George Cranleigh=== ==D== ===Davros=== ==E== ===Eldrad=== Eldrad (Stephen Thorne) is a silicon-based lifeform from the planet Kastria. ==G== ===Winifred Gillyflower=== Mrs Winifred Gillyflower is a award winning mechanical engineer and prize winning chemist portrayed by Diana Rigg.

The BBC Eighth Doctor Adventures novel The Taking of Planet 5 features a senior-ranking Time Lord called The War King. The War King returns in the Faction Paradox book The Book of the War, where it is revealed that he is one and the same as the War Chief, the Master, and the Magistrate from The Infinity Doctors. ===Weng-Chiang=== Weng-Chiang, whose real name is Magnus Greel, is the former Minister of Justice of the 51st century Supreme Alliance, responsible for the deaths of 100,000 enemies of the state, earning him the epithet \"the Butcher of Brisbane\". He appears in the 1977 serial The Talons of Weng-Chiang. Greel fled to 19th century China by means of time cabinet, taking The Peking Homunculus with him. Consequences of Greel's time travel are explored in the spin-off Virgin Missing Adventures novel The Shadow of Weng- Chiang by David A. McIntee. Greel is also mentioned in Simon A.

He is fondly recalled by Doctor Who fans as one of the most over-the-top villains in the entire history of the show. Particularly well remembered is his cry of \"Nothing in the world can stop me now!\", which (due to actor Joseph Furst's Austrian accent) was pronounced as \"Nuzzing in Ze vurld can ztop me now!\" Only two of the four episodes from this story survive, but the surviving material includes that infamous line. ==See also== * List of Doctor Who supporting characters * List of Doctor Who henchmen * List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens * List of Doctor Who robots * List of Torchwood characters * List of The Sarah Jane Adventures minor characters ==References== ==External links== * The Bumper Book of Doctor Who Monsters, Villains & Alien Species Villains Doctor Who Doctor Who villains Villains ",
