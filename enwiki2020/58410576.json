    "text": "World War I, also known as the First World War or the Great War, had a major impact on global society and culture. Religion was also impacted. Christianity in both Europe and the United States served to unite fellow soldiers of the same denomination and motivated them to fight. Some European countries shared unity across denominations while others did not. In Germany, Catholic and Protestant differences caused tension while Austria-Hungary did not unify Catholic services. == Christian Institutions in Jerusalem == The Greek Orthodox Church received much of its income from pilgrimage. The First World War stopped pilgrimage and a heavy tax was required of those who didn't want to fight in the war. The factors caused the Greek Orthodox Church to borrow large amounts of money that left the Church defective during the duration of the war. As Christian establishments dealt with the effects of the First World War, some were able to maintain themselves and prosper while others experienced great loss. The war changed the relationship between Christians and Muslims in Jerusalem and united them over a common attitude of opposition towards Jewish immigration. The war also caused the formations of new religious groups such as The Palestinian Association of Egypt. The war increased religious focus on custody of the Holy Land and local issues. == Unity Among Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish American Soldiers == When the United States entered the First World War, the most prominent religious groups were Catholics, Protestants, and Jews. The conflict served to unite these religions despite their differences and dissolve the idea the Jews and Catholics were inferior to Protestants. The loyalty to the same God and same country helped soldiers put aside their religious differences for the good of the war. Tense conditions still existed between these three religious but efforts were made to provide equal opportunities to each group. A committee called the Committee of Six represented the three faiths in the formation of new policy in the United States. == Spiritualism == World War I also brought a focus on the afterlife and developed Spiritualism into a religion. Spirituality was enticing to those dealing with death and loss of faith after the First World War because of their beliefs in speaking with the dead and explaining mysteries about death, things that some felt Christianity couldn't satisfy. Stobart, a British woman in charge of a hospital during the Second World War, became a spiritualist leader following the end of the war. She was enticed by Spiritualism because it offered more opportunities for her as a woman than other traditional religions did. == The Church of England == For national churches such as The Church of England, war was heavily supported. They felt that it was their duty to pray for soldiers because they needed the grace of God. They believed that soldiers would pass through purgatory because violence was opposed to the church's belief in peace. Despite these conflicting beliefs, church leaders supported the war. Bishop Gore, a bishop of the Church of England, was one that fantasized and downplayed the realities of war in his attempt to support it.Indian bicycle troops Somme 1916 IWM Q 3983 == Sikhism == Known for their bravery, Sikhs were more prominently found in the Indian army. Although the army also consisted of individuals from other religions, many people belonging to faiths, such as Hinduism were rarely found in combat. Regiments were even formed strictly with members of the Sikh religion. The Indian Army formed an allegiance with the British Empire and participated in a few battles during World War I, including the Battle of Gallipoli.Stanley, Peter. Die in Battle, Do Not Despair: the Indians on Gallipoli,1915. Primus Books, 2017. == The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints == The participation of members from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in World War I provided an opportunity for members of the LDS Church to clearly define themselves to the world. In a time where many negative commentaries about church were circulating, the War served to help in efforts to accurately portray the church. During this time, \u201cMormons\u201d were accused of being disloyal to the United States of America. In 1886, a district attorney for the state of Utah was quoted to have said \u201cWe wish to say that the so-called Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is steeped in disloyalty to the Government of the United States...We say, more than that, that the purpose of this Church here, one of its particular purposes, is to overthrow the American home and overturn the family altar in this country.\"1 \u201cIn a Nut Shell: A Strong Indictment Presented by the U. S. Attorney,\u201d The Salt Lake Daily Tribune, vol. The Latter-day Saint soldier's active duty in the war fought against the idea that members of the LDS Church were not loyal to their country. In fact, many LDS men enlisted in the military for the sole purpose of trying to prove such accusations as false. Such soldiers also left notable impacts on their fellow comrades throughout their active participation in military service.\u201d The LDS Church is known for its missionary work, and the case was not any different during the early years of the church. During World War I, however, missionary work was negatively affected. Many of those who would otherwise serve missions for the church, enrolled in military service, limiting the number of men available to become LDS missionaries. Areas where LDS missionaries previously proselyted, became too dangerous for such activity and as a result all LDS missionaries were taken out of Europe. == Women of Faith in the War == World War I made women into more influential figures in society, due to their symbolic necessity in representing their faith. It was women of faith that actively engaged in provided aid, emotionally, physically, and spiritually, to Soldiers in need during the violence of the War. Additionally, women assisted in actual religious pursuits and activities. They held and supported positions that would not have been previously available to them. Catholic women were remembered helping Priests who were overloaded with the amount of spiritual and physical aid they felt needed to be administered. They worked under such responsibilities to help people come back to their faith in Jesus Christ. Women in the Protestant faith participated in similar ways, including providing care packages for Soldiers. They even took over parishes when the pastors of such parishes were busy in other endeavors during the war. It was during this time that women were symbols during the war of religious faith and devotion to supporting their countries. == Judaism == alt=Jews served in the war for several different reasons. They desired to unite with their fellow citizens and join with them in combat. The war also allowed for Jewish people to define themselves to the world. A huge driving factor for many Jews was the desire to engage in conflict against Russia, a nation that was known for being oppressive to Jews. Many felt the need to help their fellow Jewish comrades in dire circumstances. Due to the destruction of Habsburg Monarchy and the Russian Empire, new nations were formed that developed different relations with the Jewish people than before World War I. The Jews became more recognizable and distinctive in the new states established thus creating greater Jewish influence.Rozenblit, Marsha L., and Jonathan Karp. World War I and the Jews Conflict and Transformations in Europe, the Middle East, and America. Berghahn Books, 2017. == Islam == During World War I, the Ottoman Empire was under an immense amount of pressure to engage in the conflict. Leaders of the empire attempted to maintain neutrality for a time, but the pressure for inclusion only increased. The official religion of the Ottoman Empire during this time, was Islam, making joining the war was a topic of controversy in the Islamic state, as Muslim law includes strict guidelines in regards to involvement in wars. In October 1914, the Ottoman Empire faced enough pressure from Germany to agree to commence an attack on the Russian Navy stationed in the Black Sea. The Ottoman Empire deceptively claimed that they were attacked by Russia, hiding the fact that their presence in the Black Sea was to deliberately cause conflict with Russia. This event ultimately led to Russia's involvement in World War I. Many argue that the Ottoman Empire's involvement was strictly due to benefits they desired for the Islamic state. Muslim scholars have argued that their participation was really an attempt to enlarge the Islamic state and grow in power and influence.Z\u00fcrcher Erik Jan. Jihad and Islam in World War I: Studies on the Ottoman Jihad on the Centenary of Snouck Hurgronje's \"Holy War Made in Germany\". Leiden University Press, 2016. During the war, 2.5 million Muslims fought for the Allies, and the majority were having problems on how to pray during the intense battles of trench warfare. ==References== ==External Links== * Jonathan H.
