Hindwings grey.Meyrick, E., 1895 A Handbook of British Lepidoptera MacMillan, London pdf Keys and description The larvae feed on Castanea sativa, Quercus frainetto, Quercus macranthera, Quercus petraea, Quercus pubescens, Quercus pyrenaica, Quercus robur and Quercus rubra. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a narrow corridor, filled with frass, running along a vein (usually the midrib, but sometimes a lateral vein and then running in the direction of the midrib). The corridor widens into a blotch. The larva makes a slit in the lower epidermis of the blotch, by which part of the frass is ejected. Pupation takes place outside of the mine. ==References== ==External links== *bladmineerders.nl *Ectoedemia subbimaculella images at Consortium for the Barcode of Life *Nepticulidae from the Volga and Ural region *UKmoths *Swedish moths Category:Nepticulidae Category:Moths of Europe Category:Moths of Asia ",
