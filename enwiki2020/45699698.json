    "text": "Harry Thornber (9 November 1851 - 28 July 1913) was an English cricketer. Born at Manchester, Lancashire, he was a right-handed batsman who made one appearance in first-class cricket. Thornber played his club cricket for Manchester and Sale, before making his appearance in first-class cricket for Lancashire in 1874 against Kent at Maidstone. He opened the batting alongside Dick Barlow in Lancashire's first-innings, but was dismissed for a duck by James Fellowes, while in their second-innings he batted lower in the order, but was again dismissed for a duck, this time run out. He was described as a steady middle order batsman with a sound defence. Outside of playing cricket, Thornber was a merchant, trading with the East Indies. He died at St Pancras, London on 28 July 1913. ==References== ==External links== *Harry Thornber at ESPNcricinfo *Harry Thornber at CricketArchive Category:1851 births Category:1913 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Manchester Category:English cricketers Category:Lancashire cricketers Category:English merchants ",
