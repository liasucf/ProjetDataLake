    "text": "Michael Boris Green (born 22 May 1946) is a British physicist and one of the pioneers of string theory. Currently a Professor of Theoretical Physics in the School of Physics and Astronomy at Queen Mary University of London, and emeritus professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and a Fellow in Clare Hall, Cambridge in England, he was Lucasian Professor of Mathematics from 2009 to 2015. ==Education and background== Green was born the son of Genia Green and Absalom Green. He attended William Ellis School in London and Churchill College, Cambridge where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with first class honours in theoretical physics (1967) and a PhD in elementary particle theory (1970). ==Career== Following his PhD, Green did postdoctoral research at Princeton University (1970\u201372), Cambridge and the University of Oxford. Between 1978 and 1993 he was a Lecturer and Professor at Queen Mary College, University of London, and in July 1993 he was appointed John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge. On 19 October 2009 he was confirmed as the next Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, to succeed Stephen Hawking on 1 November 2009. In 2015 was succeeded in that chair by Michael Cates, a specialist in colloids, gels, and particulate materials. ==Research== After many years in collaboration with John Henry Schwarz, he co-discovered the anomaly cancellation in type I string theory in 1984. This insight, named the Green\u2013Schwarz mechanism, initiated the First Superstring Revolution. Green has also worked on Dirichlet boundary conditions in string theory which have led to the postulation of D-branes and instantons. ==Awards and honours== Green has been awarded the Dirac and Maxwell Medals of the Institute of Physics, UK, the Dirac Medal of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (Trieste) and the Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics of the American Physical Society. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1989. Green has co-authored more than 150 research papers. His nomination for the Royal Society reads On 12 December 2013, Michael Green shared the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics with John Henry Schwarz \"for opening new perspectives on quantum gravity and the unification of forces.\" ==Selected publications== * Green, M., John H.
