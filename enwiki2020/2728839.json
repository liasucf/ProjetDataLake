He first became well known in Azerbaijan for successful restoration of law and order, gaining widespread recognition and popularity there. He was then appointed governor of Tehran by Reza Shah, replaced in Azerbaijan by Mohammad Hosein Airom. In 1925, he became Minister of War. In 1928, while en route to Lurestan to visit a road construction site with some engineers, his group was ambushed by unknown assailants near Borujerd. He died shortly after due to bullet wounds in a hospital in Borujerd. Reza Shah attended his funeral to pay his respects. ==References== * 'Al\u00ed Riz\u0101 Awsat\u00ed (\u0639\u0644\u064a\u0631\u0636\u0627 \u0627\u0648\u0633\u0637\u0649), Iran in the Past Three Centuries (Ir\u0101n dar Se Qarn-e Goz\u0332ashteh - \u0627\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0633\u0647 \u0642\u0631\u0646 \u06af\u0630\u0634\u062a\u0647), Volumes 1 and 2 (Pakt\u0101b Publishing - \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u0627\u062a \u067e\u0627\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628, Tehran, Iran, 2003).
