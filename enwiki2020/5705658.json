    "text": "{| |} The Wright R-1300 Cyclone 7 is an American air-cooled seven-cylinder supercharged radial aircraft engine produced by Curtiss-Wright. == Design and development == The R-1300 is basically a single row Wright R-2600. The engine was mass-produced but not widely used. Engineering began in 1942 but the first flight of an R-1300 did not take place until 1949. The engine was produced under license by Kaiser-Frazer and later by AVCO Lycoming.USAF Technical Manuals, Parts Breakdown, Overhaul Instructions 1951-1971 T.O. 2R-1300-14 The engine was used in combat -- the R-1300-1A and -1B in the A model North American T-28 Trojan and the R-1300-3, -3A, -3C and -3D in the Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw. The R-1300-1B was used to power the Ayres Thrush. The R-1300-4 and -4A were used in the N class blimp; 50 of these variants were produced by AVCO. Early-production engines had vibration problems, an improved lateral dampener in the crank brought about most of the model changes. ==Variants== ;R-1300-1A : ;R-1300-2 :A direct drive version of the R-1300-1. It had a 0.5625:1 reduction drive. Both used the PD9F1 carburetor. ;R-1300-2A : ;R-1300-3 :Derated to 690.3 hp (515 kW), uses forced-air cooling fan and uses a PD9G1 carburetor. ;R-1300-4 :Similar to the R-1300-1, uses some different accessory components. ;R-1300-CB7A1 :With reduction gear for use on fixed wing aircraft. ==Applications== * N class blimp * North American T-28 Trojan * Rockwell Thrush Commander * Sikorsky H-19 * Westland Whirlwind ==Specifications (R-1300-1A)== ==See also== ==References== ==External links== *Video of an R-1300 engine run on a North American T-28A Category:1940s aircraft piston engines Category:Aircraft air-cooled radial piston engines R-1300 ",
