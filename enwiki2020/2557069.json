    "text": "Nicholas \"Little Nick\" Corozzo (born March 17, 1940) is an American New York mobster who was the reputed acting boss of the Gambino crime family. ==Biography== Nicholas Corozzo was born on Pitkin Avenue in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn. Nicholas Corozzo's first headquarters was located in a small candy store on the corner of Eastern Pkwy & Atlantic Ave. in the Ocean Hill section of Brooklyn, known as \"The Hill\" to his crew members. He later opened a social club next to the candy store which became his new headquarters. Corozzo later moved his headquarters to the Canarsie section of Brooklyn. Nicholas is the older brother of alleged reputed Gambino consigliere Joseph \"Jo Jo\" Corozzo as well as twin brothers Blaise Corozzo, a Gambino soldier, and Anthony Corozzo who is an associated of the Gambino crime family. Anthony Corozzo is a longtime parishioner of Our Lady of Loreto Church located at the corner of Pacific St. & Sackman St. in Brownsville, Brooklyn where he attended regular Sunday mass. Anthony Corozzo along with his lifelong friend and Gambino crime family associate Dominick Mondelli AKA Donny Mondelli, were well known for organizing neighborhood reunions and charitable events for the church for decades. Nicholas Corozzo is the uncle of Joseph Corozzo Jr, a high-profile New York defense attorney. Nicholas' daughter, Bernadette, is married to Gambino associate Vincent Dragonetti. Prior to Corozzo's incarceration, he lived in Bellmore, Long Island. He stands at 5\u20325\" tall and weighs approximately 170 pounds. ==Rise to family boss== During the early 1980s, Nicholas Corozzo was a bitter rival of Gambino capo John Gotti. When Gotti became boss in 1985, he declined to promote Corozzo to capo. However, since Corozzo was such a good earner for the family, Gotti did not want to get rid of him. In turn, Corozzo professed loyalty to Gotti.\"Nicholas Corozzo: Gambino Capo Escapes Dragnet\" AMV Case Files Fugitives It was only after Gotti went to prison in 1992 that Corozzo was finally promoted to Caporegime, along with Gambino soldier Leonard \"Lenny\" DiMaria. With Gotti in prison, Corozzo, DiMaria, and Nicholas' brother Joseph, now the alleged consigliere, formed a ruling panel that unofficially ran the Gambino family. In the mid 1990s, Corozzo was elevated to acting boss of the family.\"John Gotti - The Last Mafia Icon\" Crime Library on truTV.com In 1996, Corozzo allegedly ordered the murder of Lucchese crime family associate Robert Arena. Arena had allegedly murdered Anthony Placido, a member of Corozzo's crew, and had failed to return some stolen marijuana to a drug dealer.Gambino Capo Nicholas Corozzo Sentenced Friend of Ours April 18, 2009 On June 26, 1996, the Gambino gunmen found Arena driving with Thomas Maranga, an Arena childhood acquaintance with no criminal connections, in the Mill Basin section of Brooklyn. After forcing Arena to stop the car, the gunmen shot and killed both men. However, till this day there is no concrete evidence that Corozzo ordered the murder of Robert Arena. ==Florida arrest== In December, 1996, Corozzo was indicted in Miami, Florida on 20 racketeering charges that included attempted murder, arson, and loansharking. Corozzo was accused of running a loansharking business in Deerfield Beach, Florida that charged 260% yearly interest on loans.\"Attorney for Corozzo Denies his Client has Ties to the Mob\" Sarasota Herald-Tribute, December 20, 1996 Federal agents arrested Corozzo as he emerged from the surf at a beach in Key Biscayne, Florida.Reputed New Gambino Boss is Arrested\" New York Times December 19, 1996 In August 1997, Corozzo pleaded guilty to racketeering charges in Florida and was sentenced to five to ten years in prison. Later that year, Corrozo again pleaded guilty in Brooklyn to racketeering and bribing a jail guard. While in federal prison, Corozzo shared a cell with Gambino associate Joseph Vollaro, who was serving a drug conviction. After his release, Vollaro started paying tribute to Corozzo's crew on a trucking company he started. However, facing another drug conviction in 2004, Vollaro agreed to become a government informant and record his conversations with Corozzo.\"Accused Gambino Leaders Indicted in Sweep\" New York Times February 8, 2008 After Corozzo's release from prison on June 10, 2004, Corozzo was again expected to take over Gambino crime family. However, due to increased law enforcement attention, he initially kept a low profile. The Gambinos were reportedly led by Jackie D'Amico until 2005. Corozzo kept his position as a Caporegime, despite health concerns and tight parole restrictions. In 2006, a new report stated that Nicholas Corozzo and D'Amico were the new bosses of the Gambino family, with Arnold \"Zeke\" Squitieri as underboss and Joseph Corozzo as consigliere. ==Indictment and prison== In February 2008, Corozzo was indicted twice, one for the federal Operation Old Bridge and the other for the state Operation Touchback. The federal indictment was for the 1996 Arena and Maranga murders and other racketeering charges, with Vollaro as their main witness.
