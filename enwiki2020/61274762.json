    "text": "The Spanish Trotter, , is the national breed of trotting horse of Spain. It is reared almost exclusively in the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean, predominantly in the island of Mallorca, but also in Menorca and Ibiza. == History == Trotting races were held in the Balearic Islands from the latter part of the nineteenth century. Trotting horses were bred by putting local Mallorqu\u00edn and Menorqu\u00edn mares to imported stallions, usually of French Trotter or Orlov Trotter origin. Some Anglo-Norman mares and stallions were imported from France in about 1920. Breeding is now usually by artificial insemination with semen from French Trotter or American Standardbred stallions. A breeders' association, the , was formed in 1970. A stud-book was started in 1980, and an official breed standard was approved in 2011. In 2005 there were approximately 15,500 horses recorded in the stud-book. About 85% of all Spanish Trotters are in the island of Mallorca. Genetic study has found little recent influence of the Mallorqu\u00edn and Menorqu\u00edn on the Spanish Trotter,.despite their contribution to its early development. == Use == The Spanish Trotter is bred for performance in trotting races. There are three hippodromes in the islands. Races are almost invariably in harness to a sulky, with the horse performing an ordinary diagonal trot; occasionally the horses may instead be raced under saddle. The fastest time for the breed over 1 kilometre is 69.15 seconds. The horses are obedient and manageable, and are also suitable for recreational riding. ==References== Category:Balearic culture Category:Horse breeds Category:Horse breeds originating in Spain ",
