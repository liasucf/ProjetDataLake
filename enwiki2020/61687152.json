    "text": "Camera Owner (1964-1968) was a bi-monthly British hobbyist photography magazine founded in 1964. In 1968 it evolved into Creative Camera, a monthly magazine of fine art and documentary photography, which in turn, in 2000, became DPICT before its publication ceased in 2001. == History == When Camera Owner was launched in 1964 from 27 Whitfield Street, London,Writers' and artists' year-book, Volume 59 A. and C. Black, 1966 edited by Alec Fry ARPS previously of Amateur Photographer magazine, it offered pictorial 'how-to' articles for an audience ranging from the keen amateur to the dabbler with no interest in technical jargon; it was subtitled \u2018The Teach-Yourself Photo Monthly\u2019. From Issue #8 of February 1965 South African photographer J\u00fcrgen Schadeberg, picture editor of the influential Drum magazine in the 1950s, took over as picture editor, exercising a stronger design and a bolder use of pictures. By Issue #10, in April 1965, Fry moved on to establish Polysales Progress mail order firm, and Schadeberg took on the editorship.David Allan Mellor, \"A Contextual Chronology\", p.150.

In Creative Camera No.321, April\u2013May 1993 had contributed two articles to the magazine and by December of the same year he took over as Editor. His aim was to promote British photography as a serious art form to rival the U.S. Aperture and Norman Hall's Photography, and the Swiss Romeo Martinez' Camera.Bill Jay, \"What Happened Here?: Photography in Britain since 1968. \" Conference at the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, Bradford, England, 14 October 2004. He instituted book reviews in 1966 (for example, of John Szarkowski's The Photographer's Eye, July 1967) and interviews (including with Aaron Siskind and David Douglas Duncan). Magazine content emphasised the aesthetics of photography over technique, and Jay encouraged his readers to initiate 'postal circles' by circulating a boxed print by mail to a group for feedback. Colin Osman, himself a keen photographer, historian and collector of photography, and owner of Coo Press, a publishing house with a long and lucrative history of racing pigeon publications, bought the failing Camera Owner from the publishers Davpet Ltd. for \u00a31 in 1966.Colin Ford.

In The PhotoHistorian No. 139, Journal of the Historical Group of the Royal Photographic Society, September 2002, Twickenham, UK Jay remained as editor and continued to change the style of the magazine,Warren, Lynne; Warren, Lynn (2005), Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Photography, 3-Volume Set, Taylor and Francis, so that it attracted more serious readers and contributors, amongst them young British photographers like David Hurn and Tony Ray-Jones. === Reformation === Jay gradually transformed the \u2018hobbyist\u2019 Camera Owner during 1967, wth the word \u2018Creative\u2019, in a smaller font, being placed above the title \u2018Camera Owner\u2019, and \u2018Owner\u2019 reduced, by December, to a smaller font so that \u2018Creative Camera\u2019 dominated the masthead. With the reorientation of content that Jay had introduced, the journal finally became Creative Camera alone in February 1968, continuing with that title through more than 30 years of publication.Brittain, David (1999).
