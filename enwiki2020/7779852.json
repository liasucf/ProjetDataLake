    "text": "Theodore Vetoyanis (, February 27, 1908 \u2013 May 22, 1984)\"Pueblo County Biographies\". www.kmitch.com. was an American professional wrestler and sports promoter, known by his ring name George Zaharias, popularly known as \"The Crying Greek from Cripple Creek\" or \"The Greek Hyena\" during the 1930s. Often cast as a villain or sore loser, one of his most celebrated bouts was a 1932 match with Jim Londos at a sold-out Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, which Londos won. The audience of 14,500 was the highest attendance for any North American wrestling match that year. ==Background== In 1938, Zaharias met Babe Didrikson, a talented female athlete best known as a golfer, at a charity golf event; the promoter had matched the wrestler, the golfer, and a minister in a threesome as a gag. Zaharias and Didrikson married later that year, and Zaharias quit wrestling in order to manage his wife's career. He promoted wrestlers and ran a cigar store in Denver. As Babe's career soared, he managed a tailoring shop, a women's sports clothier in Beverly Hills, California, and a golf course in Florida, where the couple retired. In 1975, Alex Karras portrayed George Zaharias in the TV movie Babe, (opposite his future wife, actress Susan Clark), which told the story of Didrikson, who won two gold medals in track and field at the 1932 Olympics and returned to become a champion golfer, her battles to be accepted as a woman in a man's sports world, and her fight against cancer. Zaharias also did some part-time acting. The Zahariases had no children and were rebuffed by authorities when they sought to adopt. He died in Tampa, Florida, having outlived Babe by 28 years. He married actress Betty Burgess in January 1960 in Las Vegas.:File:George Zaharias and Betty Burgess 1960.jpg He married one of Babe's nurses several years before his death.Babe Zaharias fact sheet, Babe Zaharias Memorial, Beaumont, Texas ==Championships & Accomplishments== *Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum **Class of 2020 ==References== ==External links== *New York Times: George Zaharias, Husband Of Babe Didrikson, Is Dead *Special Collections and Lamar University Archives: Husband of athlete Babe Zaharias dies *Article on marriage to actress Betty Burgess *Babe, a 1975 TV movie biography, at The Internet Movie Database Category:1908 births Category:1984 deaths Category:20th-century American male actors Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:American people of Greek descent Category:People from Cripple Creek, Colorado Category:People from Pueblo, Colorado Category:Professional wrestlers from Colorado Category:Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum Category:Sportspeople from Pueblo, Colorado ",
