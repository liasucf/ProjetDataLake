Leszczynski and at the Noblemen's Institute. In 1858 he left for Paris to study at the Ecole centrale Paris but was persuaded by Juliusz Kossak to abandon engineering in favor of painting. He studied as a painter in Munich under Franz Adam and Karl Piloty and then opened his own studio. His paintings mostly study 17th-century military life, though he has also made some studies of Polish peasant life. In 1893, Brandt was awarded the Order of Isabella the Catholic, and in 1898, he became the recipient of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art. ==Centre of Polish Sculpture== Brandt's 19th century manor house in Oro\u0144sko together with surrounding park serves today as the Centre of Polish Sculpture. ==Gallery== File:Bitwa pod Wiedniem Brandt.jpg|\"Battle of Vienna\", oil on canvas 1873 File:J\u00f3zef Brandt, Bitwa pod Chocimiem.jpg|\"Jan Karol Chodkiewicz during the battle of Khotyn\", oil on canvas 1865 File:Husarz, J\u00f3zef Brandt, 1890.jpg|\"Polish Hussar\", oil on canvas 1890 File:J\u00f3zef Brandt - Wesele kozackie.jpg|\"Cossacks' Wedding\", oil on canvas 1893 File:Brandt Zaporizhian Camp.jpg|\"Zaporozhians' camp\", oil on canvas 1880 File:J\u00f3zef Brandt, Czarniecki pod Koldyng\u0105.jpg|\"Stefan Czarniecki during the Battle of S\u00f8nderborg\", commonly known as \"Stefan Czarniecki during the Battle of Kolding\", oil on canvas 1870 File:Walka o sztandar turecki.jpg|\"Battle over the Turkish Banner\", oil on canvas 1905 File:Brandt J\u00f3zef Pospolite ruszenie u brodu.jpg|\"Militia at the Ford\", oil on canvas 1880 File:Brandt-Lisowczycy, Strzelanie z \u0142uku.jpg|\"Lisowczycy (Archery)\", oil on canvas 1885 File:Brandt Powrot Kozakow.jpg|\"Return of the Cossacks\", Oil on canvas 1894 File:Brandt Skladanie sztandarow.jpg|\"Inspection of the Trophy Banners\", oil on canvas 1905 File:Bogurodzica.jpg|\"Bogurodzica\", oil on canvas 1909 File:J\u00f3zef Brandt - Potyczka Kozak\u00f3w z Tatarami.jpg|Skirmish Between Cossacks and Tatars, ca. 1890 ==See also== *List of Polish painters ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:1841 births Category:1915 deaths Category:People from Szczebrzeszyn Category:People from Lublin Governorate Category:19th-century Polish painters Category:19th-century male artists Category:20th-century Polish painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Polish war artists Category:Military art Category:19th-century war artists Category:19th-century painters of historical subjects Category:equine artists Category:Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art Category:Polish male painters ",
