    "text": "Boi (plural: bois) is slang within LGBT and butch and femme communities for a person's sexual or gender identities. In some lesbian communities, there is an increasing acceptance of variant gender expression, as well as allowing people to identify as a boi. The term has also been used as an alternate spelling for boy. ==Usage== ===In the LGBT community=== The term boi may be used to denote a number of other sexual orientations and possibilities that are not mutually exclusive: *A boyish lesbian. *A submissive butch in the BDSM community. *A young trans man, or a trans man who is in the earlier stages of transitioning. *A younger bisexual or gay person who may have effeminate characteristics. The term can also be used by anyone who wishes to distinguish from heterosexual or heteronormative identities. Boi may also refer to someone assigned female at birth, who generally does not identify as, or only partially identifies as feminine, female, a girl, or a woman. Some bois are trans or intersex people. Some bois identify as one or more of these, but they almost always identify as lesbians, dykes, or queer. Many trans bois are also genderqueer/nonbinary (in itself a trans/transgender group), or might identify as cis persons or trans men, and yet practice genderfuck in which they do not fit in either masculine or feminine binary gender presentation. Bois may prefer a range of pronouns, including \"he\", \"she\", or nonbinary and gender-neutral pronouns such as \"they\". Published October 1, 2005. === Usage in popular culture and meme culture === One of the earliest usages of the term boi was with the rapper Big Boi. In the early 2000s the term came into usage within skateboarding culture. The term came into popular culture again with the song Sk8er Boi by Avril Lavigne. The term came into meme culture with the Dat Boi meme: an animation of a frog on a unicycle usually accompanied by the caption \"Here come dat boi. (O shit waddup!)\" == See also == * Dat Boi ==References== ==External links== * Category:Butch and femme Category:Trans men's culture Category:LGBT slang Category:Androgyny Category:Slang Category:Gender roles in the LGBT community Category:Memes ",
