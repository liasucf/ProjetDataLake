He was a Serb-CatholicNikola Tolja, Dubrovacki Srbi katolici - istine i zablude, Dubrovnik 2012 of Croatian origin. Budmani was one of the first persons to have used the combined term Croatian and Serbian into \"Serbo-Croat (Illyrian)\". It was first used by the German Jacob Grimm in 1824 and the Austrian-Slovenian Slavist Jernej Kopitar in 1836.Okuka, M. 1998. Eine Sprache - viele Erben. Sprachpolitik als Nationalisierungsinstrument in Ex- Jugoslawien. Klagenfurt: Wieser Verlag, S. 16. He wrote a seminal book in Italian called Grammatica della lingua serbo-croata (illyrica) that described the Serbo-Croatian grammar, published in Vienna in 1867. Because it was written primarily as a manual for use in the gymnasia in Dalmatia, it was restricted in scope and space, but it soon received high praise from \u0110uro Dani\u010di\u0107 in Rad JAZU #2 in 1868. Budmani's description of the limited use of aorist and imperfect and the subtleties of perfect was consistent with Croatian vernacular at the time. Between 1868 and 1882, he taught in the Gymnasium (high school) of his hometown. In 1883 he reached Zagreb where he edited the Rije\u010dnik (Dictionary) of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts, based in Zagreb, Croatia, then part of Austria-Hungary. He was also a corresponding member of both the Serbian Learned Society (inducted: January 24, 1871) and the Serbian Royal Academy (from January 23, 1888). Pero Budmani was one of the prominent members of the Serb Catholic movement in Dubrovnik. He is credited for the emergence of the movement together with another professors of the secondary school in Dubrovnik, Stjepo Castrapelli. He was a member the Municipal Council of Dubrovnik. In their March 9, 1880 session, the Council adopted the proposition of the Dubrovnik Youth to raise a monument that would commemorate the 300th anniversary of the birth of Ivan Gunduli\u0107. Budmani was named in the committee that would oversee the construction of the monument, together with Medo Puci\u0107, Antun Fabris, Nik\u0161a Gradi, Ivo Kazna\u010di\u0107, Natko Nodilo, Mato Vodopi\u0107 and Luko Zore. The unveiling of the Gunduli\u0107 monument in Dubrovnik took place on May 20, 1893, and it turned out to be a major political event that confronted the Croat and Serb political parties in Dubrovnik. In 1907 he returned to Italy to Castelferretti and lived there until 1913 years when he returned to his native Dubrovnik. But already the following year, seriously ill and embittered for the persecution suffered at the hands of the Austrian police (who considered him a dangerous subversive), Pero Budmani fled from home, reached Ancona and died there on December 27, 1914. Budmani spoke most of the European languages, including Old Slavonic, Greek, Latin, and several Asiatic languages. Robert D Greenberg, Associate Professor Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures, describes him as a Croat linguist. ==Selected works== * Grammatica della lingua serbo-croata (illirica) Pietro Budmani ==See also== * Ignjat Job * Ivan Stojanovi\u0107 * Milan Re\u0161etar * Lujo Vojnovi\u0107 * Marko Murat * Antun Fabris * Luko Zore ==References== Category:1835 births Category:1914 deaths Category:People from Dubrovnik Category:People from the Kingdom of Dalmatia Category:Book and manuscript collectors Category:Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Category:Members of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts Category:Kingdom of Dalmatia Category:Serbian Roman Catholics ",
