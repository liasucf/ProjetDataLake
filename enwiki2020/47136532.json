Thirty-three All-Star Games have been held since the Carolina Hurricanes entered the NHL as the Hartford Whalers in 1979, with at least one player chosen to represent the franchise in each year except 1998, 2004 and 2012. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, and 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games. The franchise has hosted two of the games. Hartford hosted the 38th at the XL Center, then known as the Hartford Civic Center, and Carolina hosted the 58th at PNC Arena, then known as the RBC Center. * Selected by fan vote * All-Star Game Most Valuable Player2014\u201315 NHL Official Guide & Record Book, p. 234 {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Carolina Hurricanes franchise players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game |- !scope=\"col\" | Game !scope=\"col\" | Year !scope=\"col\" | Name !scope=\"col\" | Position !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References |- ! scope=\"row\" | 32nd |1980 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 33rd |rowspan=\"2\" |1981 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 34th |1982 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 35th |1983 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 36th |1984 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 37th |1985 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 38th |rowspan=\"2\" |1986 | (Did not play) | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 39th |1988 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 40th |1989 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 41st |1990 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 42nd |1991 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 43rd |1992 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 44th |1993 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 45th |1994 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 46th |1996 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 47th |1997 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 48th |1998 |No Hurricanes selected |\u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 49th |rowspan=\"2\" | 1999 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 50th |2000 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 51st |2001 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 52nd |2002 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 53rd |2003 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 54th |2004 |No Hurricanes selected |\u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 55th |rowspan=\"2\" |2007 | | |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 56th |2008 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 57th |2009 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 58th |rowspan=\"3\" |2011 | | |rowspan=\"3\" | |- | | |- | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 59th |2012 |No Hurricanes selected |\u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 60th |2015 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 61st |2016 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 62nd |2017 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 63rd |2018 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 64th |2019 | | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 65th | rowspan=\"2\" |2020 | (Did not play) | | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | (Replaced Hamilton) | |} ===All-Star Game replacement events=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Hartford Whalers players and coaches selected to All- Star Game replacement events |- !scope=\"col\" | Event !scope=\"col\" | Year !scope=\"col\" | Name !scope=\"col\" | Position !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| |rowspan=\"2\"|1987 | | |rowspan=\"2\"| |- | | |} ==Career achievements== ===Hockey Hall of Fame=== The following is a list of Carolina Hurricanes who have been enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Carolina Hurricanes franchise players and personnel inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame ! scope=\"col\" |Individual ! scope=\"col\" |Category ! scope=\"col\" |Year inducted ! scope=\"col\" |Years with Hurricanes franchise in category ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |References |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2004 |1996, 1998\u20132000 |, retrieved July 2, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Builder |1982 |1983\u20131993 |, retrieved July 4, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2007 |1981\u20131991, 1998\u20132004 |, retrieved July 2, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |1972 |1977\u20131980 |, retrieved July 4, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2011 |1977\u20131982 |, retrieved July 4, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |1983 |1980 |, retrieved July 4, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Builder |2015 |1994\u2013present |, retrieved November 10, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |1986 |1977\u20131982 |, retrieved July 4, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2015 |1993\u20131995 |, retrieved November 10, 2015 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2017 |2006 |, retrieved November 16, 2017 |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Builder |2019 |1994\u20132014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | |Player |2013 |1995\u20131996 |, retrieved July 4, 2015 |} ===Foster Hewitt Memorial Award=== Two members of the Carolina Hurricanes organization has been honored with the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award.

Numbers 2 and 19 were returned to circulation when the franchise moved to Carolina, but the number 9 remains unofficially retired for Howe. The number 3 was removed from circulation following Steve Chiasson's death in 1999. Also out of circulation is the number 99 which was retired league-wide for Wayne Gretzky on February 6, 2000. Gretzky did not play for the Hurricanes franchise during his 20-year NHL career and no player in franchise history had ever worn the number 99 prior to its retirement. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Carolina Hurricanes retired numbers !
