Wallach Art Gallery, Columbia University, New York, 2009, p.94 He was among the first generation of students to graduate from the new Academy of Fine Arts in 1962. He and his cohort were taught by the first generation of contemporary Iraqi artists including Hafidh al-Droubi and Jawad Saleem, who promoted the idea of integrating ancient heritage within abstract artworks. Before long, the younger artists, including Al-Jumaie rebelled against traditional art styles and wanted to explore the use of new materials and media such as collage, aluminum and mono-type.Pocock, C., \"The Reason for the Project Art in Iraq Today\", in: Azzawi, D. (ed.), Art in Iraq Today, Abu Dhabi, Skira and Meem, 2011, p. 101 In 1965, shortly after graduating, al-Jumai'e co-founded the artists' group known as the 'Innovationists'.Pocock, C., \"The Reason for the Project: Art in Iraq Today\", in: Azzawi, D. (ed.), Art in Iraq Today, Abu Dhabi, Skira and Meem, 2011, pp 94-101 This group, which was short-lived, lasting just four years, consisted of a younger artists including: Salim al- Dabbagh, Faik Husein and Ali Talib, who along with Al-Jumaie began using new media in highly experimental ways.Pocock, C., \"The Reason for the Project Art in Iraq Today\", in: Azzawi, D.

His interest in exploring new media and materials was maintained throughout his career. The art critic, Jabra Ibrahim Jabra wrote of the artist's capacity to combine ancient and modern as well as abstract and figurative styles: The idea of tracks left by tradition is a theme that Jumaie takes up in much of his work. For example, Pages from Old Books is a series of mixed media artworks that creates an illusion of surfaces on which fragments of script have been written.Collier, C., \"Contemporary Arab Art: Modern Painters of the Arab World\", Sheraton Magazine, vol 2, no. 5, p. 24 http://artiraq.org/maia/archive/files/sheraton-magazine- vol-2-no-5_69476ba92c.pdf The notion of traces is particularly evident in one of his best-known works, Bullet Trace (1967); a powerful work that deals with the shock of the six day war.Hann, F., Dabrowska, K. and Townsend-Greaves, R., Iraq: The ancient Sites and Iraqi Kurdistan, Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 31 Examples of his work can be found in the National Gallery of Jordan permanent collection;Wi\u01e7d\u0101n \u02bbAl\u012b, Jordan National Gallery of Fine Arts, al- Mat\u1e25af al- Wa\u1e6dan\u012b al-Urdunn\u012b lil-Fun\u016bn al-\u01e6am\u012bla (\u02bbAmm\u0101n), 2005, p. 225 and p. 286 the Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad; The Municipality of Olsq; The Arab Monetary Fund, Abu Dhabi and The International Labor Organization, Geneva.
