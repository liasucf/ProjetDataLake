The Dodgers remained competitive, finishing the season in second place, 14\u00bd games behind the NL Champion Cincinnati Reds in the National League West. == Regular season == === Season standings === === Record vs. opponents === === Opening Day lineup === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:left\" |+ ! colspan=\"2\" |Opening Day starters |- !Name !!Position |- |Maury Wills || Shortstop |- |Bill Buckner || Left fielder |- |Willie Davis || Center fielder |- |Willie Crawford || Right fielder |- |Wes Parker || First baseman |- |Steve Garvey || Third baseman |- |Tom Haller || Catcher |- |Ted Sizemore || Second baseman |- |Claude Osteen ||Starting pitcher |- |} === Notable transactions === * August 21, 1970: Jerry Royster was signed as an amateur free agent by the Dodgers.Jerry Royster page at Baseball Reference * August 24, 1970: Sergio Ferrer was signed as an amateur free agent by the Dodgers.Sergio Ferrer page at Baseball Reference * September 28, 1970: Fred Norman was purchased from the Dodgers by the St. Louis Cardinals.Fred Norman page at Baseball Reference === Roster === {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font- size: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: #083c6b; color: white; text-align: center;\" | 1970 Los Angeles Dodgers |- | colspan=\"10\" style=\"background-color: black; color: white; text-align: center;\" | Roster |- | valign=\"top\" | Pitchers | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Catchers Infielders | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Outfielders | width=\"25px\" | | valign=\"top\" | Manager Coaches |} ===First major league foul ball injury death=== On May 16, the Dodgers were playing a home game against the Giants when, during the third inning, Mota fouled off a Gaylord Perry pitch into the stands near first base. It struck Alan Fish, 14, attending the game with other boys from his nearby recreational baseball team and their coach. Fish was unconscious for a minute, and spoke incoherently when he reawakened and, while his speech had recovered, needed assistance walking to the Dodger Stadium's first-aid center. There, he seemed to have recovered completely. The stadium doctor did not ask whether he had lost consciousness or check his blood pressure, and released him after giving him two aspirin for the lingering pain. He returned to his seat and watched the rest of the game normally, even trying to get autographs from the Dodgers afterwards. However, on his return home he began experiencing dizziness, shaking and crying, and his parents decided to take him to a hospital. Two hospitals were unable to take the boy immediately, even as his condition deteriorated, and he was not admitted until early the next morning. His condition at first improved, but then became even worse, and a neurosurgeon discovered a large mass at the site of the injury. Before he could operate, however, Fish suffered a convulsion that left him brain dead, and three days later he died after being taken off life support. The autopsy found that Fish had died due to an intracerebral hemorrhage after the hairline fracture caused by the foul ball had pushed a piece of his skull into his brain. Had he been required to rest and hospitalized immediately afterward, the neurosurgeon believed he could have recovered completely. The Fishes sued the Dodgers, the stadium physician and the two hospitals that had not been able to treat their son for negligence and medical malpractice; at trial, after dropping the other hospitals, the jury found for the team and doctor. However, an appeals court reversed that verdict three years later due to a jury instruction that should have been given but was not. == Player stats == === Batting === ==== Starters by position ==== Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
