    "text": "Muriel Catherine Canning Chapman (1894 - 1988) was a British Chemist, one of the first female chemists at the University of Oxford. She matriculated there in 1920, the first year that women were permitted to do so, and was awarded a B. Sc. in 1923. She had already been awarded a B. Sc. from Royal Holloway College in 1916. Her research was in chemical kinetics, and was carried out in conjunction with her husband, David Chapman. She was the daughter of Samuel Holmes, a sometime theology lecturer at Jesus College, Oxford. She was educated at the Oxford High School for Girls before going to Royal Holloway. She then returned to Oxford and worked at the Leoline Jenkins Laboratory at Jesus College. In 1917 she became a member of the Society of Oxford Home- Students, which later became St. Anne's College. After about 1927, she became active in the League for the Prohibition of Cruel Sports, and was secretary of the Oxford branch throughout its existence. ==References== Category:Alumni of Royal Holloway, University of London Category:Alumni of St Anne's College, Oxford Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Animal welfare workers Category:British chemists Category:British women scientists ",
