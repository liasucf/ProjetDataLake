The habitation is situated on the A71, between Caldermill and Priestland in East Ayrshire at a height of 196.7m and about 5 miles west of Strathaven. == History == The original Battle of Drumclog memorial stone Drumclog is best known as the site of the 1679 Battle of Drumclog that took place on Drumclog Moss in which the Covenanters defeated the King's Dragoons who were under the command of Claverhouse. The Lochgoin Covenanters Museum on Whitelee Moor in Fenwick Parish has displays and artifacts from the battle.Lochgoin Covenanters Museum A monument is located on the site of the battle.Canmore : Battle of Drumclog Thomas Carlyle visited the battlefield in April 1820 and wrote a description of the \"flat wilderness of broken bog, a quagmire not to be trusted\". Originally the village was a group of small farms however the opening of the railway in 1905 and the building of a substantial stone church in 1912 created a focus upon the area around Snabe and the habitation then formally achieved the status of a named village. The post office has closed however the church remains in regular use (datum 2019). ===Etymology=== Drumclog may have Brittonic origins. The first part of the name may be the very common element *drum, indicating a place with \"a back, a ridge\", and the second element *clog, \"a rock, a crag, a steep cliff\" (Welsh drum-clog), in place names meaning a standing stone or other stones of perceived significance. The second part of the name could also be the cognate Gaelic element clach. ==Drumclog Memorial Kirk== This church was opened in 1912 and replaced a corrugated-iron church that had been built in 1901 to serve this remote location in Avendale and Drumclog Parish. It was designed by J McLellan Fairley in a Gothic-style with a square tower crowned with an octagonal copper covered spire. The title \"Drumclog Memorial Kirk\" was given in remembrance of the Battle of Drumclog that was fought nearby in 1679 when the Covenanters defeated Government troops. The original remembrance stone for this battle, damaged by a lightning strike, stands on the west side of the kirk.Avondale and Drumclog Parish Church The stone's inscription reads \"In commemoration of the victory obtained on this battlefield, on Sabbath the 11th June 1679, by our Covenanted forefathers over Graham of Claverhouse and his dragoons.\"Groome, Vol. II. Page 372 A stained glass window of the battle is a further commemoration together with a replica of the Covenanter's Flag. ==Drumclog Memorial School== The old Drumclog Memorial School The Old Memorial School was located away from the centre of the village in a location that was most convenient for the farms and their children. The plaque on the wall reads \"On the battlefield of Drumclog, this Seminary of Education was erected, in memory of those Christian Heroes, who on Sabath the 1st of June 1679 nobly fought, in defence of Civil and Religious Liberty\". The nearest primary school is now at Gilmourton. ==Drumclog railway station== Located at NS 63889 38645 next to the A71 this was a railway station on the Darvel and Strathaven Railway opened 4 July 1905 by the Caledonian Railway serving a rural area that included the village and farms in the rural area around Drumclog. The line had been intended as a through route between Lanarkshire and Ayrshire, however there was very little traffic along the route as the population in the area was very low. The station was closed from September until November 1909 and then again from January 1917 until December 1922. The last train ran on 10 September 1939, however the official closing date was two weeks later.Stansfield, Page 32 Loudounhill railway station stood to the west and Ryeland railway station to the east.
