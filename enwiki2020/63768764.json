    "text": "The gens Secundinia was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. No members of this gens are mentioned by ancient writers, but a number are known from inscriptions, dating entirely or almost entirely from imperial times, and concentrated in Gaul, Germania, Noricum, and adjacent areas. ==Origin== The nomen Secundinius belongs to a class of gentilicia formed from other names using the suffix ', indicating that it was derived either from the cognomen Secundinus, or from the nomen Secundius.Chase, pp. 125, 126. Both of these in turn derive from Secundus, a name originally given to a second son or second child; Secundinus is a diminutive form. Secundus may originally have been a praenomen, like similar names such as Quintus, Sextus, and Decimus, but in the time of the Republic the masculine form is only encountered as a surname.Chase, pp. 150, 151. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Secundinii were Gaius and Lucius, two of the most common names at every period of Roman history. Only a few examples of other praenomina are found in the inscriptions of this gens, many of which lack praenomina. Also found are Marcus and Sextus, which were common, and Postumus, which was relatively scarce as a praenomen, although common as a surname under the Empire. ==Members== * Secundinia Nepotilla, the wife of Valerius Victor, and the mother of Gaia Valeria Candidida, buried at Cemenelum in Alpes Maritimae in the late first century, with a monument dedicated by her parents.. * Sextus Secundinius, together with his wife, Junia Firmis, built a sepulchre at Virunum in Noricum, dating to the first century, or the first half of the second, for themselves and their children, Mogetius, aged nine, and Sextianus, aged seven.. * Lucius Secundinius Surianus, buried at Flavia Solva in Noricum, aged fifty-one, during the first century, or the first half of the second.. * Postumus Secundinius Maximus, the heir of Tiberius Julius Ingenuus of Virunum, a soldier from the twelfth urban cohort at Rome, in the century of Naevius, who was buried at Rome in the late first or early second century, aged twenty- four years, having served for six years. * Secundinia Severina, the wife of Gaius Sacretius Spectatinus, one of the duumviri jure dicundo at Flavia Solva, who built a sepulchre for himself and his wife at the present site of Grafendorf bei Hartburg, then part of Noricum, dating to the first half of the second century.. * Lucius Secundinius, an officer in the second cohort of an uncertain military unit in AD 135.. * Secundinius Justinus, made an offering to Jupiter Dolichenus, according to an inscription found at the present site of Zeillern, formerly part of Noricum, between the first and third centuries.AEA, 2008, 45. * Secundinius Mercator, buried at Noreia in Noricum between the first and third centuries.. * Secundinius Vibianus, made an offering to the tutelary deity of Noricum at Virunum between the first and third centuries.. * Secundinius Verullus, a centurion in the Legio II Augusta, stationed along Hadrian's Wall in Britain during the middle of the second century..e. * Gaius Secundinius Eutyches, buried at Alba Julia in Dacia during the second century, with a monument dedicated by his wife, Vibia Annia.IDR, iii. 5. 2, 572. * Secundinia Paterna, buried at Rome, aged thirty years, five months, in a second-century tomb built by her husband, Valerius Secularis.. * Gaius Secundinius Sabinianus, made a second-century offering to Silvanus Domesticus at Aquincum in Pannonia Inferior.. * Gaius Secundinius Secundus, one of the aediles at Celeiensium, built a second-century tomb at Ivenna in Noricum for himself and his wife, Materna, the daughter of Vibenus.. * Lucius Secundinius Victor, built a second-century tomb at Fanum Fortunae in Umbria for Clearchus, the slave of Lucius Titius Felix.. * Gaius Secundinius Legitimus, a member of the college of Jupiter Cernenius at Alburnus Major in Dacia, according to an inscription from AD 167.IDR, i. 31. * Secundinius Ursinus, built a tomb at Virunum, dating to the middle or late second century, for himself, his wife, Betautunis, and their granddaughter, Lasciva, aged one year and five months.. * Secundinius Divixtus, one of a number of persons who made offerings to Fortuna at Civitas Alisinensium in Germania Inferior, according to an inscription dating to the second century, or the first half of the third.. * Secundinia Festiva, buried in a tomb byult by Acceptus Senilis at Celeia in Noricum, dating to the second or third century.AIJ, 33. * Secundinius Verus, a soldier stationed at Alexandria in AD 199.. * Secundinius Amantius, a cornicularius, or hornblower, in the Legio XXII Primigenia, who, with the permission of his father, Primulus, made offerings to Sol Invictus, Mithras, and Mars at Mogontiacum in Germania Superior, in the latter half of the second century, or the early part of the third.. * Marcus Secundinius Silvanus, a negotiator, or merchant, dealing in chalk from Britain, who made offerings to Nehalennia at Ganventa in Gallia Belgica, in the latter half of the second century, or the first half of the third., . * Secundinius Serotinus, buried at Abodiacum in Raetia, aged ninety-five years, fifteen days, in the late second century, or first half of the third.. * Gaius Secundinius Dignus, made offerings to Jupiter Optimus Maximus and Juno Regina at the present site of Osterburken, formerly part of Germania Superior, in the late second or early third century.. * Marcus Secundinius Vitalis, a decurion in the Ala I Thracum, along with his wife, Claudia Priscilla, and daughter, Secundinia Vitalina, made an offering to Jupiter Optimus Maximus Depulsor at Poetovio in Pannonia Superior, in the late second or early third century.ILJug, i. 339. * Secundinia M. f.
