    "text": "Bubblebath is the debut extended play (EP) by American singer and YouTube personality Poppy, under the name That Poppy. It was released digitally on February 12, 2016, by Island Records as her first and only release on the label. It preceded by a year and eight months the release of Poppy's debut studio album, Poppy.Computer, on October 6, 2017 after signing to Mad Decent. ==Composition== Bubblebath carries a pop sound, while incorporating elements of ska-pop and punk. The track opens up with \"Lowlife\", a reggae song that serves as her first single. \"Money\" and \"Altar\" are described as \"retro- bangers.\" \"American Kids\" lyrically talks about millennial stereotypes. Popular TV described the song as the \"antithesis to Halsey's 'New Americana,' but \"just as anthemic.\" Poppy claims the EP's name came from the idea that the world was dirty and would benefit from a bubblebath. ==Critical reception== Tyler Peterson of UQMUSIC gave the EP a positive review, calling it a \"little collection of some major millennial masterpieces.\" He further wrote: \"Blazing full force with her Electra-Heart-meets-Princess-Peach persona, That Poppy is demonstrating some serious staying power with her committed visual and sonic aesthetics.\" ==Singles== \"Lowlife\" was released as a single on July 24, 2015. PopularTV has described the track as one that \"will make you want to break out your old checkered Vans and hang with the skater boys.\" \"Lowlife\" was later featured on the compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 58 in the United States, and a version of the track featuring rapper Travis Mills was released under Island Records in April 2016 and has received airplay on BBC Radio. A music video for the song was released in July 2015, premiering on Teen Vogue. In September 2016, \"Lowlife\" was nominated for a Tiger Beat \"19 Under 19\" Award for \"Most Influential Song\". In July 2016, Poppy released \"Money\" as a single along with a music video for the track, which kept a similar tone to her YouTube videos. \"Money\" was used in the first episode of the second season of the television series Scream, titled \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", and was also used for the video game The Sims 4, on the \"Tween Pop\" radio station for the Kids Room Stuff pack. Money became a frequent encore song for Poppy's Poppy.Computer Tour. Both singles were performed by Poppy on the Poppy.Computer Tour. ==Track listing== Credits adapted from iTunes Store. ==References== Category:2016 debut EPs Category:Island Records EPs Category:Pop EPs Category:Poppy (entertainer) albums ",
