    "text": "The Duckling Gets a Cookie!? is a 2012 picture book by Mo Willems. It is about a duckling that asks for, and receives, a cookie, a pigeon that complains about it, but is then flummoxed when the duckling passes the cookie to him. ==Reception== Booklist, reviewing The Duckling Gets A Cookie!?, wrote \"Willems has an extraordinary ability to convey immediate, deep characterization with a few deft strokes. He knows, too, how to spread the action across a picture book, carefully managing the panels and page turns to ramp up the drama. Fans will delight at another outing, and the protagonist's indelible pigeonality will welcome newcomers to the club.\" and the School Library Journal wrote \"While just plain fun to read aloud, this book is an excellent conversation starter on the topics of politeness and making reasonable requests. This meta- tale that references the gamut of the Pigeon oeuvre will please fans and newcomers alike.\" The Horn Book Magazine's review noted \"Simple speech-balloon text, animated illustrations, and a clean design continue to be a successful formula for Willems\u2019s brand of storytelling.\" The Duckling Gets a Cookie!? has also been reviewed by Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, Common Sense Media, The New York Times, and AudioFile. ==Awards== *2013 CCBC Choice, *2013 Irma Black Award - honor ==See also== *Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! *Don't Let the Pigeon Stay Up Late! *The Pigeon Wants a Puppy! ==References== Category:2012 children's books Category:American picture books Category:Fictional ducks Category:Fictional passerine birds Category:Cookies in popular culture ",
