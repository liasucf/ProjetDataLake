    "text": "Delta Hydrae, Latinized from \u03b4 Hydrae, is a double star in the equatorial constellation of Hydra. It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.146. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 20.34 mas, it is located about 160 light years from the Sun. This is a double star with an angular separation of along a position angle of , as of 2003. The brighter component is an A-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of A1 Vnn. It is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 285 km/s. This is giving the star an oblate shape with an equatorial bulge that is 20% larger than the polar radius. It has an estimated 2.88 times the mass of the Sun and 2.7 times the Sun's radius. The star is about 244 million years old and it radiates 42.7 times the solar luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 11,055 K. The companion has a visual magnitude of 11.15. X-ray emissions have been detected from this location in space, which may be coming from a companion star. ==Name and etymology== In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket, this star was designated Lisan al Shudja, which was translated into Latin as Lingua Hydri, meaning the snake's tongue. This star, along with \u03b5 Hya, \u03b6 Hya, \u03b7 Hya, \u03c1 Hya and \u03c3 Hya (Minchir), were Ulugh Beg's Min al Az\u02bdal, \"Belonging to the Uninhabited Spot\". According to the catalogue of stars in the Technical Memorandum 33-507 - A Reduced Star Catalog Containing 537 Named Stars, Min al Az\u02bdal or Minazal were the title for five stars :\u03b4 Hya as Minazal I, \u03b7 Hya as Minazal II, \u03b5 Hya as Minazal III, \u03c1 Hya as Minazal IV and \u03b6 Hya as Minazal V (exclude \u03c3 Hya) In Chinese, (), meaning Willow (asterism), refers to an asterism consisting of \u03b4 Hydrae, \u03c3 Hydrae, \u03b7 Hydrae, \u03c1 Hydrae, \u03b5 Hydrae, \u03b6 Hydrae, \u03c9 Hydrae and \u03b8 Hydrae \u4e2d\u570b\u661f\u5ea7\u795e\u8a71, written by \u9673\u4e45\u91d1.
