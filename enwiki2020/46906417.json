    "text": "Noblella is a genus of frogs in the family Craugastoridae. They are found on the eastern slopes of the Andes and in the Amazon Basin in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and western Brazil. The name refers to Gladwyn K. Noble, who described the first species. ==Taxonomy== Noblella was originally erected to accommodate Sminthillus peruvianus, but subsequently synonymized, first with Eleutherodactylus (1971) and then with Phrynopus (1975). Noblella was resurrected by De la Riva and colleagues in 2008. At the same time, they put Phyllonastes into synonymy of Noblella. However, Noblella, as currently defined, might still be polyphyletic. The AmphibiaWeb keeps Noblella in Strabomantidae, a family no longer recognized by the Amphibian Species of the World. ==Description== Noblella are small frogs measuring up to in snout\u2013vent length. Head is no wider than the body. Tympanic membrane is differentiated except in Noblella duellmani. Dorsum is pustulate or shagreen. Venter is smooth. ==Species== There are at least 16 species: AmphibiaWeb also tentatively includes \"Eleutherodactylus\" bilineatus in the genus Noblella, whereas the Amphibian Species of the World only gives it a familial placement. ==References== Category:Craugastoridae Category:Amphibians of South America Category:Amphibian genera Category:Taxa named by Thomas Barbour ",
