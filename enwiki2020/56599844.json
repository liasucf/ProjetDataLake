He began his education in Brodnica, then in 1379 he studied at the Charles University in Prague, where before 1392 he obtained the title of a bachelor in the field of decrees, however he graduated in 1393. He then went to the University of Padua, where he obtained the same field in 1405. PhD title. Already in 1392 he became a provost of W\u0142oc\u0142awek and held this office until 1414. Also in 1392 he began his diplomatic career by serving the great master of the Teutonic Knights Konrad von Wallenrode. In 1397 he became the chancellor of Queen Jadwiga, and a year later (in 1398) the W\u0142oc\u0142awek Chapter wanted to be elected a bishop, but Andrzej himself abandoned the throne supported by King Mikolaj Kurowski. Before 1402 he became a canon of P\u0142ock, and in 1405 he was the chaplain of the German King Ruprecht Wittelsbach. In 1409 he became a papal collector in Poland and also took part, together with his relatives, the Pozna\u0144 bishop Piotr Wysz, in the Council in Pisa and pilgrimage to the Holy Land. In 1411, together with Jakub \u015aledz, he sent John XXIII to the anti pope-John Paul II, complaining to him about the Teutonic Knights breaking the First Peace of Toru\u0144. His spiritual career was also developing. Already in 1413 he was the dean of Kracow Cathedral, the canon of Gniezno and Pozna\u0144. A year later (in 1414) he became a papal protector and bishop of Pozna\u0144.Hierarchia Catholica, Volume 1, Page 408 In the meantime, from 1412 to 1414 on behalf of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jagie\u0142\u0142o he appeared as a prosecutor in the trial between Poland and the Teutonic Order and then went as a member of the official Polish delegation to the Council of Constance, where he mainly participated in the work of the commission for faith and in the trials between Poland and the Teutonic Knights. He also became known there as a supporter of church reform and conciliarist. In 1419 he was in the procession of the king during his congress with the emperor in Nowy S\u0105cz, and in 1420 he was in the legation to the Diet of the Reich, which took place in Wroc\u0142aw, during which the emperor considered Polish-Teutonic disputes. In the same year he took part in a synod called by Miko\u0142aj Tr\u0105b to Wielu\u0144. In 1422, he again took part in the trial with the Teutonic Knights, appearing as a witness this time, and in 1423 he took part in the Council in Pavia. In 1424, together with Pawe\u0142 W\u0142odkowic, he sent to Rome, where they repudiated the charges against the Pope. During this stay, he also resigned from the episcopal throne, which, however, was not accepted. From the bull of Pope Martin V of 1424, we learn that he and his nephew Jan of Liche\u0144 were the founder of the new church in Gos\u0142awice. ==Memorials== In this church there is a very interesting team of 26 coats of arms placed on stone supports supporting the ribs of the church's vault.
