It was established in 1996, and hosts Caribbean films for five days. Elite Traveller wrote of the festival: \"Now an established event on the island\u2019s cultural calendar, the festival has put St. Barths on the map as a meeting place for regional filmmakers to come together to screen and discuss their work. In addition to the 35mm films screened every evening on the beach, the festival also presents an annual round-table discussion on Caribbean cinema, offering a glimpse into the unique arts and culture scene of the Caribbean basin.\" ==References== ==External links== *Official site Category:Saint Barth\u00e9lemy culture Category:Film festivals in the Caribbean Category:1996 establishments in Saint Barth\u00e9lemy Category:Recurring events established in 1996 Category:Annual events in Saint Barth\u00e9lemy ",
