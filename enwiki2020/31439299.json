    "text": "Kip Christian Moore (born April 1, 1980) is an American country music singer and songwriter signed to MCA Nashville. He has released a total of four studio albums for the label: Up All Night, Wild Ones, Slowheart, and Wild World. Moore has charted a total of twelve entries on Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay including the number-one \"Somethin' 'Bout a Truck\" and four additional top-ten hits. He has also written songs for Frankie Ballard, Thompson Square, and James Wesley. ==Biography== Kip Moore was born in Tifton, Georgia, to Bonnie (Mann) and Stan Moore. He has two brothers and three sisters. Their father died in September 2011, just months before the release of Moore's debut album. He began playing guitar while attending Wallace State Community College in Hanceville, Alabama, and made his first public performance at a Mellow Mushroom restaurant in Valdosta, Georgia. After college, he moved to a \"little hut\" in Hawaii, where he also took up backpacking and surfing. He moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 2004, where songwriter and producer Brett James helped him sign a publishing deal. ==Musical career== He spent eight years in Nashville before signing a record deal with MCA Nashville. His debut single, \"Mary Was the Marrying Kind\", peaked at number 45 on the country singles charts published by Billboard. On September 27, 2011, he released his second single, \"Somethin' 'Bout a Truck\". The song was followed by the release of his debut album Up All Night in April 2012. Moore co-wrote every song on the album, and Brett James produced it. A month later, \"Somethin' 'Bout a Truck\" hit number 1 on the Billboard country charts. \"Beer Money\" was the album's second single, followed by \"Hey Pretty Girl\". These songs also reached the country Top 5. Up All Night was the most commercially successful album for a debut country male artist in both 2012 and 2013. Moore co-wrote two tracks on Thompson Square's self-titled debut album which was released in February 2011: \"All the Way\" and \"Let's Fight\", the latter of which was their debut single. He also co-wrote James Wesley's 2012 single \"Walking Contradiction\". He also co-wrote Frankie Ballard's 2016 single \"Cigarette\". ===Wild Ones (2013\u20132016)=== In October 2013, Moore announced his fifth single, \"Young Love\". It charted at number 22 on the Country Airplay in March 2014. After it underperformed, it was followed by \"Dirt Road\", which failed to make Top 40. Moore then decided to \"scrap\" his second album and compose new material. Moore then released \"I'm to Blame\", the lead single to his 2015 album, Wild Ones. ===Slowheart (2017\u20132018)=== On February 10, 2017, Moore released \"More Girls Like You\" as the lead single from a then- unannounced forthcoming album. On June 21, 2017, Moore announced the album's title, Slowheart, and its release date of September 8, 2017. On November 16, 2018, Moore released his second EP titled Room to Spare: The Acoustic Sessions. Three singles were released in preparation for the EP: \"Tennessee Boy,\" an acoustic version of \"Plead the Fifth,\" and \"It Ain't California.\" The EP consists of seven acoustic tracks. ===Wild World (2019-present)=== In May 2019, Moore announced on social media \u201cThat\u2019s a wrap, record #4 is done\u201d. No release date had been officially announced, but on June 15 Moore announced he was checking mixes for his upcoming record, indicating the record may be released sometime in 2019. On August 9, 2019, Moore released a much- anticipated lead single to his yet to be named upcoming album. \u201cShe\u2019s Mine\u201d is a song Moore wrote over a decade ago, and finally released it in 2019. On March 27, 2020, Moore released the title track for his anticipated fourth studio album titled Wild World. Later that same day, Moore did an interview with Billboard about his new album. The album, which will consist of thirteen tracks (twelve of which are co-written by Moore), is slated for release on May 29, 2020. Another preview song, \"Southpaw\", followed on April 17, 2020. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Details ! colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\"| Sales ! rowspan=\"2\"| Certifications |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US Country ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US ! style=\"width:45px;\"| AUS ! style=\"width:45px;\"| CAN |- ! scope=\"row\"| Up All Night | * Release date: April 24, 2012 * Label: MCA Nashville | 3 || 6 || \u2014 || \u2014 | | * RIAA: Platinum |- ! scope=\"row\"| Wild Ones | * Release date: August 21, 2015 * Label: MCA Nashville | 2 || 4 || 31 || 5 | * US: 88,600 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Slowheart | * Release date: September 8, 2017 * Label: MCA Nashville | 3 || 10 || 6 || 10 | * US: 56,200 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Wild World | * Release date: May 29, 2020 * Label: MCA Nashville | 5 || 36 || 4 || 53 | | |- | colspan=\"8\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Details ! colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:8em;\"| Sales |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US Country ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US ! style=\"width:45px;\"| AUS ! style=\"width:45px;\"| CAN |- ! scope=\"row\"| Underground | * Release date: October 28, 2016 * Label: MCA Nashville | 12 | 97 | \u2014 | 77 | *US: 6,500 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Room to Spare: The Acoustic Sessions | * Release date: November 16, 2018 * Label: MCA Nashville | 20 | \u2014 | 18 | \u2014 | *US: 5,000 |- | colspan=\"8\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single ! colspan=\"5\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Certifications (sales threshold) ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US Country ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US Country Airplay ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US ! style=\"width:45px;\"| CAN Country ! style=\"width:45px;\"| CAN |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2011 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Mary Was the Marrying Kind\" | colspan=\"2\"| 45 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | | style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"4\"| Up All Night (and Deluxe Edition) |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Somethin' 'Bout a Truck\" | colspan=\"2\"| 1 | 29 | 1 | 33 | * RIAA: 2\u00d7 Platinum |- | 2012 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Beer Money\" | 7 | 3 | 51 | 1 | 58 | * RIAA: Gold |- |rowspan=2|2013 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Hey Pretty Girl\" | 8 | 2 | 41 | 6 | 62 | * RIAA: Platinum * MC: Gold |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Young Love\" | 26 | 22 | \u2014A | 43 | 83 | | rowspan=\"2\" |- | 2014 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Dirt Road\" | 35 | 44 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2015 ! scope=\"row\"| \"I'm to Blame\" | 24 | 20 | 100 | 40 | 96 | | style=\"text- align:left;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Wild Ones |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Running for You\" | 25 | 13 | \u2014B | 31 | \u2014 | |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2017 ! scope=\"row\"| \"More Girls Like You\" | 8 | 4 | 66 | 3 | \u2014 | * MC: Gold | style=\"text-align:left;\" rowspan=\"3\"| Slowheart |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Last Shot\" | 12 | 6 | 53 | 23 | \u2014 | * RIAA: Gold |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 ! scope=\"row\"| \"The Bull\" | \u2014 | 55 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"She\u2019s Mine\" | 24 | 17 | \u2014 | 41 | \u2014 | | style=\"text- align:left;\"|Wild World |- | colspan=\"9\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart |} *A \"Young Love\" did not enter the Hot 100, but peaked at number 4 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which acts as a 25-song extension of the Hot 100. *B \"Running for You\" did not enter the Hot 100, but peaked at number 11 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which acts as a 25-song extension of the Hot 100. ===Other charted songs=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single ! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US Country ! style=\"width:45px;\"| CAN |- | 2015 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Wild Ones\" | 37 | 85 | style=\"text-align:left;\" | Wild Ones |} ===Music videos=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
