Like O'Neil in 1926, O'Day became one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1928. Also in 1928, she had surgery to \"remove several pounds of flesh from her hips and legs.\" An Associated Press news story reported: \"The actress has been gaining weight steadily for the last year and although under contract to a film studio has been idle. Her excessive weight was the cause of her lack of work, Miss O'Day said, and after other flesh reducing methods failed she decided on the surgeon's knife as the final resort.\" After appearing in a few dozen films in the 1930s she retired. ==Recognition== O'Day has a star at 1708 Vine Street in the Motion Pictures category on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was dedicated February 8, 1960. ==Personal life== O'Day married actor Jack Durant in 1934 in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico. They divorced July 10, 1951, in Los Angeles, California.
