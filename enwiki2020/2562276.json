    "text": "Francis Holland School is the name of two separate independent day schools for girls in central London, England, governed by the Francis Holland (Church of England) Schools Trust. The schools are located at Clarence Gate (near Regent's Park NW1) and at Graham Terrace (near Sloane Square SW1). == History == The schools were founded in the 1870s by Canon Francis James Holland for the education of girls in London. He was born in London on 20 January 1828 and educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. The Regent's Park School is the older of the two schools but no longer has a Junior Department. Both schools have developed their facilities over the last few years. The Sloane Square School was opened with 13 pupils on 1 March 1881 at 80 Coleshill Street, Belgravia, later renamed as 28 Eaton Terrace. Within a year, the school expanded into a further property opposite but as this arrangement proved awkward, Canon Holland purchased a site on the corner of Graham Street, now Graham Terrace where a new school building was constructed ready for occupation in October 1884. Francis Holland, Regent's Park, used to accept boys as primary school pupils but they would leave as soon as the girls moved on to secondary education. ==Francis Holland, Regent's Park == There are about 500 pupils at the school, and about 120 sixth-formers. Most of their sports take place in Regent's Park and Paddington Recreational Grounds. ==Francis Holland, Sloane Square== There are over 500 pupils on roll, 160 of whom are in the Junior School aged between 4 and 11 years, and 80 sixth-formers. Most of the School's sports take place in Battersea Park. Francis Holland, Sloane Square, is also ranked highly in league tables and is noted by The Good Schools Guide as having an \"outstandingly high quality\" in its Arts, History and MFL (modern foreign languages) departments. Francis Holland Sloane Square's motto is: 'Excellence and Enjoyment in Equal Measure'. == Notable alumnae== *Amber Agar, actress *Camilla Arfwedson, actress *Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, member of the Royal family *Amanda Donohoe, actress *Eleanor Burbidge, astronomer *Jackie Collins OBE, novelist *Dame Joan Collins, actress and writer *Lady Mary Charteris, singer and model *Cara Delevingne, model *Petra Ecclestone, fashion designer *Tamara Ecclestone, TV presenter *Emilia Fox, actress *Louisa Garrett Anderson, medical pioneer *Ione Gedye, archaeological conservator and founder of the repair dept at the Institute of Archaeology *Joyce Grenfell, comedian and singer-songwriter *Helen Grimshaw, engineer *Hermione Hammond, artist *Evelyn Jamison, historian and vice principal of Lady Margaret Hall 1921 to 1937 *Elizabeth Jane Howard, novelist *Gemma Jones, actress *Jemima Khan (Jemima Goldsmith), journalist *Susan Lawrence, Labour politician *Sue Lloyd-Roberts, Special Correspondent for the BBC (formerly at ITN) *Sienna Miller, actress *Nancy Mitford, novelist and biographer *Vanessa-Mae, violinist *Elizabeth Pakenham, Countess of Longford, biographer *Matilda Ramsay, Gordon Ramsay's daughter The Daily Telegraph, 23 August 2018. *Patricia Roc, actress *Christina Scott, former Governor of Anguilla *Rose Tremain, novelistCostume dramatist, The Guardian, 10 May 2003. *Theresa Villiers, politician (formerly Secretary of State for Northern Ireland) *Jennifer von Mayrhauser, costume designer *Veronica Wadley, former editor of the Evening Standard *Daisy Waterstone, actress ==References== == External links == * FHS, Regent's Park website * FHS, Sloane Square website * FHS, Regent's Park alumni website * FHS, Sloane Square alumni website * Independent Schools Council profiles \u2013 Regent's Park & Sloane Square * Trust website * The Francis Holland (Church of England) Schools Trust \u2013 Charity Commission Category:Educational institutions established in 1878 Category:Independent girls' schools in London Category:Member schools of the Girls' Schools Association Category:Knightsbridge Category:Independent schools in the City of Westminster Category:Regent's Park Category:Church of England independent schools in the Diocese of London Category:1878 establishments in England ",
