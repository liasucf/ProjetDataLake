    "text": "Aleksije Lazovi\u0107 (; 1774\u20131837) was a painter from modern-day Montenegro. He is particularly famous for his icons. ==Biography== Aleksije Lazovi\u0107 was born in Bijelo Polje, Montenegro, to Serbian parents; the son of the painter Simeon Lazovi\u0107. Among the works painted by Aleksije Lazovi\u0107 is the iconostasis of the Church of the Dormition-of-the-Mother-of-God at the Re\u017eevi\u0107i Monastery, near Petrovac na Moru or the Uspanie Bogomatere Church in \u0160ibenik, Croatia. With his father, he painted the iconostasis of Saint Demetrius and Saint Nicholas chapels at the De\u010dani monastery in Kosovo and the iconostasis of the Savina monastery church near Herceg Novi. He is also the author of an icon of the Virgin, painted in 1806 and in imitation of a painting attributed to Saint Luke; this work is preserved in the Museum Treasury of the Patriarchate of Pe\u0107. Works by Aleksije Lazovi\u0107 are also preserved in the churches of Dobroselica, Ma\u010dkat and Bela Reka on the Zlatibor mountains, and theiconostasis he painted in the Monastery of Nikoljac in Bijelo Polje in 1837. The iconostases of De\u010dani are the most grandiose works and most beautiful of Simeon and Alexis Lazovi\u0107 who, between 1764 and 1837, executed numerous iconostasis in churches in Dalmatia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia. Being given their conceptions of pictorial art, these painters of icons were the continuators of iconography's post-Byzantine tradition, adapting models to the taste of their customers by modernizing them, that is, using the post-Baroque form practiced by engravers and painters who worked the territory subject to the spiritual authority of the Metropolitanate of Karlovci. The iconostasis of the De\u010dani Monastery, to a large extent, complements the image of the diverse activity of the painters Lazovi\u0107 and allows us to judge with more objectivity their work which translates faithfully the social and spiritual conditions in which they have lived and displayed their talents. ==Gallery== File:Aleksije Lazovi\u0107 - Saint Sava, Saint Symeon and Stefan the First-Crowned, 1819.jpg|Saint Sava, Saint Symeon and Stefan the First-Crowned, 1819 File:Aleksije Lazovi\u0107 - Christ, emperor of emperors and great archpriest, 1819.jpg|Christ, emperor of emperors and great archpriest, 1819 ==See also== * Simeon Lazovi\u0107 * List of painters from Serbia == References == Category:18th-century Serbian painters Category:19th-century Serbian painters Category:Icon painters Category:1774 births Category:1837 deaths Category:People from Bijelo Polje ",
