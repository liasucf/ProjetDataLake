    "text": "Kime () is a Japanese word. It is the noun form of the verb \"kimeru,\" which means \"to decide,\". (Random House, 1996, Japanese-English, English-Japanese Dictionary, p. 126). Kime is a commonly used Japanese martial arts term. In karate it can mean \"power\" and/or \"focus,\" describing the instantaneous tensing at the correct moment during a technique. The tension at this time is mostly focused on the dantian (\"hara\") and abdomen. In judo, the \"Kime-no- kata\" is often translated to \"Kata of Decision.\" In other bud\u014d, the term refers to attacking a pressure point. ==References== Category:Japanese martial arts terminology ",
