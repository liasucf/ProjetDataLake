She was seen by the locals as identical to Hebe and/or Ganymeda.Strabo, Geographica 8.6.24, cf. Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 2.13.3 for Ganymeda\"Only another name for Hebe, the daughter of Hera\", according to Karl Kerenyi (The Gods of the Greeks, 1951, p.159), who adds \"and indeed was probably the name for Hera herself, as 'she who belongs to Zeus' or 'the heavenly one'\u2014for this is the meaning of the word.\" *Dia, daughter of Aeolus, keeper of the winds and Telepora or Telepatra, daughter of Laestrygon. She was the sister of Androcles, Chrysippus, Iocastus, Phalacrus, Pheraemon, Xuthus, and the daughters' as Aeole, Astycrateia, Hephaestia, Iphthe and Periboea.Scholia on Homer, Odyssey 10.6 * Dia, daughter of King Porthaon of CalydonScholia on Homer, Iliad 2.212 and mother of Thersites and possibly the remaining five sons by Agrius.Tzetzes, Chiliades 7.888 * Dia, daughter of the king Lycaon (thus sister of Callisto), mother of Dryops by Apollo.Tzetzes on Lycophron 480Scholia on Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, 1.1213 She concealed her new-born infant in a hollow oak tree.Etymologicum Magnum, 288.33 (under Dryops) * Dia, second wife of the Thracian king Phineus and by him, mother of Mariandynus and Thynus.

According to Homer, after having sex with Zeus, who was disguised as a stallion, she gave birth to Pirithous; a folk etymology derived Pirithous' name from peritheein (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \"to run around\"), because that was what Zeus did to seduce Dia.Homer, Iliad 14.317Scholia on Homer, Iliad 1.268Scholia on Homer, Odyssey 11.631Eustathius on Homer \u00a7 101.3Nonnus, Dionysiaca 7.125Robert Graves, The Greek Myths 1960 \u00a763a * Dia, alternate name for Hippodamia, the wife of Pirithous (thus daughter-in-law of another Dia).Scholia on Hesiod, Shield of Heracles 178 *Dia, mother of Pittheus by Pelops.Scholia ad Pindar, Olympian Ode 1.144 She may have been identical with another Hippodamia, daughter of Oenomaus.
