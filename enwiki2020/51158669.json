    "text": "The Warsaw\u2013Kunowice railway is a Polish 475-kilometre long railway line, that connects Warsaw with Lowicz, Kutno, Pozna\u0144 and further to the Polish-German border at Frankfurt an der Oder. The line is one of the longest and most important routes in Poland and is part of the European E20 (Berlin - Moscow) route. ==Opening== The first calls for a railway between Pozna\u0144 and Frankfurt (Oder) were in 1842 when an appeal was made to landowners along the route. However, the line did not come to fruition, due to the deposition of a decision on the matter by the government of Prussia. Eventually the line was opened in stages from 1870. Between 1925 and 1930 the course of the section Chlastawa - D\u0105br\u00f3wka Zb\u0105ska changed in connection with the construction of the station in Zb\u0105szynek. The original section of the line, built in 1870, remained active until the reconstruction of the Zb\u0105szynek\u2013Gorz\u00f3w Wielkopolski railway as a temporary course of the line to Gorzow Wielkopolski. In Poznan and Wrze\u015bnia the course of the line has also been changed over the years. ==Route== The town of Wrze\u015bnia has a bypass which is used by express trains, with a number of services leaving the line to serve the station in Wrze\u015bnia and rejoin the main line again afterwards. ==Modernisation== Between 1998 and 2007 the route underwent considerable modernisation because of its importance as part of route E20. The work made it possible for passenger trains to travel at 160 km/h, freight trains at 120 km/h. This involved improving the track, catenary, stations, level crossings and signalling. ==Usage== The line sees trains of all categories (EuroCity, EuroNight, Express InterCity, Intercity, TLK and regional services). *EuroCity services from Warsaw to Berlin and Gdansk to Berlin *EuroNight services from Moscow to Paris and from Warsaw to Cologne *Express Intercity, Intercity and TLK services along the route between Warsaw and Zb\u0105szynek *Regional services **Przewozy Regionalne between \u0141owicz and Kutno, between Poznan and Zb\u0105szynek, between Zb\u0105szynek and Rzepin and between Rzepin and Frankfurt (Oder) **Koleje Mazowiekci between Warsaw and Kutno **Koleje Wielkopolskie between Kutno, Poznan and Zb\u0105szynek == See also == * Railway lines of Poland ==References== == External links == Category:Railway lines in Poland Category:Railway lines opened in 1870 ",
