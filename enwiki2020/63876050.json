    "text": "The 2016 New Hampshire Senate election was held on November 8, 2016, concurrently with the elections for the New Hampshire House of Representatives, to elect members to the 165th New Hampshire General Court. All 24 seats in the New Hampshire Senate were up for election. It resulted in Republicains maintaining control of both chambers of the New Hampshire General Court. In addition, Republican Chris Sununu won the open 2016 New Hampshire gubernatorial election giving the New Hampshire Republican Party total control of the state government for the first time since Republican Governor Craig Benson was defeated by Democrat John Lynch in the 2004 New Hampshire gubernatorial election. Furthermore, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was able to win the state in 2016 Presidential election by fewer than 3,000 votes (0.4%) and Democrat Maggie Hassan won 2016 United States Senate election by around 1,000 votes (0.2%). Primary elections were held on September 13, 2016. == Background == In the 2014 New Hampshire state elections, Republicans expanded their majority in the New Hampshire Senate to a margin of 14\u201310. Republicans also gained control of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. On the other hand, incumbent Democratic Governor Maggie Hassan was able to secure a second two-year term preventing total Republican control. == Campaign == A major issue of the campaign was the long planned extension of MBTA's Lowell Line from Lowell towards Nashua, Manchester and Concord as part of the so called Capital Corridor. Democratic candidates for the General Court were overwhelmingly in favor of the project, while most Republican candidates were opposed. One exception was Daniel Innis, Republican nominee in the 24th district, who stated that \"[The project] clearly adds value.\" The 2016 elections were seen as crucial for the project. In case the project would get political approval, the State of New Hampshire was expected at the time to pay around $72 million of $245.6 million for the construction of the line as well as between $3 Million to $5 million per year for the operation of it. ==Results== === Analysis === Despite Hillary Clinton carrying New Hampshire by a small margin in the simultaneous 2016 United States Presidential election, Democrats were not able to achieve significant gains in New Hampshire's state legislature. In total, just two seats changed hands between the parties. On the one hand, State Senate District 7, which was carried by Donald Trump by a 54-40 margin, switched from the Democrats to the Republicans. On the other hand, Democrats flipped State Senate District 16, which was carried by Hillary Clinton by a 48-47 margin. A total of four districts elected a Senator of a different party than the party of the presidential nominee that the district. State Senate Districts 1 and 18 reelected their Democratic Senators, despite being carried by President Trump. On the other hand, State Senate Districts 9 and 24 reelected their Republican Senators, despite being carried by Hillary Clinton. === Overview === {| style=\"width:60%; text-align:center;\" |+ \u2193 |- style=\"color:white;\" | style=\"background:red; width:58.3%;\" | 14 | style=\"background:blue; width:41.7%;\" | 10 |- | Republican | Democratic |} Source: Official results. {| class=wikitable ! style=\"background- color:#E9E9E9\" align=center rowspan= 2 colspan=2| Parties ! style=\"background- color:#E9E9E9\" align=center rowspan= 2| Candidates ! style=\"background- color:#E9E9E9\" align=center colspan=4| Seats ! style=\"background- color:#E9E9E9\" align=center colspan=3| Popular Vote |- ! align=center | 2014 ! align=center | 2016 ! align=center | +/- ! align=center | Strength ! align=center | Vote ! align=center | % ! align=center | Change |- | align=\"left\" |Republican | align=\"center\" | 24 | align=\"center\" | 14 | align=\"center\" | 14 | align=\"center\" | | align=\"right\" | 58.33% | align=\"right\" | 346,564 | align=\"right\" | 50.36% | align=\"right\" | 0.64% |- | align=\"left\" |Democratic | align=\"center\" | 24 | align=\"center\" | 10 | align=\"center\" | 10 | align=\"center\" | | align=\"right\" | 41.67% | align=\"right\" | 341,602 | align=\"right\" | 49.64% | align=\"right\" | 0.64% |- ! colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" |Total ! align=\"center\" | 48 ! align=\"center\" | 24 ! align=\"center\" | 24 ! align=\"center\" | 0 ! align=\"right\" | 100.00% ! align=\"right\" | 551,629 ! align=\"right\" | 100.00% ! align=\"right\" | - |} ===Detailed results=== {| id=toc class=toc summary=Contents | align=center | District 1 \u2022 District 2 \u2022 District 3 \u2022 District 4 \u2022 District 5 \u2022 District 6 \u2022 District 7 \u2022 District 8 \u2022 District 9 \u2022 District 10 \u2022 District 11 \u2022 District 12 \u2022 District 13 \u2022 District 14 \u2022 District 15 \u2022 District 16 \u2022 District 17 \u2022 District 18 \u2022 District 19 \u2022 District 20 \u2022 District 21 \u2022 District 22 \u2022 District 23 \u2022 District 24 __NOTOC__ |} ====District 1==== Incumbent Democratic State Senator Jeff Woodburn had represented the New Hampshire's 1st State Senate District since 2012.
