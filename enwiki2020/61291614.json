    "text": "The Dive Bar Tour is a promotional concert tour by American country music singer Garth Brooks. The tour, sponsored by Seagram, was in support of Brooks' and Blake Shelton's single, \"Dive Bar\", and visited seven dive bars in the United States. ==Background== On July 7, 2019, Brooks announced the Dive Bar Tour in support of his single with Blake Shelton, \"Dive Bar\", via Facebook Live. Despite already embarking on his Stadium Tour throughout North America, Brooks visited seven cities for the Dive Bar Tour, performing at various dive bars throughout the country. Tickets for each show were only available via contest through each city's country radio stations. In promotion of the tour and single, Brooks' Chicago performance of \"Dive Bar\" was aired on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. ==Critical response== Steve Johnson of the Chicago Tribune praised the tour, stating, \"Brooks fist-pumped, finger-pointed and humbly hat- doffed his way through a honky-tonk jukebox worth of old hits, one new single (twice) and some touching homages to country legends in a show that lasted a surprisingly generous 100 minutes.\" He continued, \"if you accept that the golden ratio in concert-going is size of talent to size of room, then this one was special, a night to get close and personal with a performer typically seen from, at best, binocular distance in a hockey arena.\" ==Shows== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of concerts, showing date, city, country, and venue |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Date ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\"| City ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Country ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Venue |- !colspan=\"5\" | North America |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center |July 15, 2019 |Chicago | rowspan=\"7\" | United States | Joe's on Weed Street |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center |August 15, 2019 |Bakersfield | Buck Owens Crystal Palace |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center |September 23, 2019 |New Braunfels | Gruene Hall |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center |October 16, 2019 |Sanford | The Barn |- |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text- align:center |October, 28, 2019 |Rootstown | Dusty Armadillo |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center |December, 2, 2019 |Mount Laurel | Prospector\u2019s Steakhouse |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center |February 5, 2020 |Foxborough | Six String Grill & Stage |- |} ==References== Category:2019 concert tours Category:2020 concert tours Category:Concert tours of the United States Category:Concert tours of North America Category:Garth Brooks concert tours ",
