Written and directed by Irish filmmaker Dermott Petty and produced by Mee Vaj and Lon Casler Bixby, the movie stars Pat Towne, Jonathan Mangum and Jaclyn Fjeslad. Manband recently played at the Unfringed Festival in Limerick, Ireland and was nominated for Best Production. ==Plot== ManBand! is the tale of two music promoters looking to find the next big thing in pop music for television. They inadvertently create a \"manband\", a boy band with middle-aged men. The television company follows and sabotages their progress. The band, cruelly named \u2018Parazone\u2019 (a European brand of bleach), consists of five members: *Barrelman (Michael Wallot), an opera singer; *RS Smoothskin (Tim Murphy), who has boy band looks but no talent; *Mild Bob (Kurt Scholler), a Tupperware salesman who mistakenly auditions thinking it to be a Tupperware convention; *Bosco Barret (Kevin Kearns), an \u201cIrish lunatic/Troubadour; and *Bartender (Ed Bell), a bartender/crazed heavy metal singer. Their choreographer, TT Bags, is a less than successful dancer and songwriter Lun E. Tune is a recently released mental patient who writes songs about maiming his old girlfriends. ==Background/Production== Petty stated in an interview \u201cOne day at the day job I had to watch a commercial for fast food featuring a Boys Band. Just as I was about to give up on Western Civilization a thought occurred to me What if some Joker of Promoter had the zany idea of creating a Boysband with Middle Age Men, hence a 'ManBand!'\" ManBand! is a SAG experimental movie shot on DV. Petty felt that going digital would serve the project best. He explains that \u201cit was an aesthetic and practical decision giving ManBand! a more Reality TV look \u2026besides we had no money.\u201d ManBand! was shot entirely in Orange County, California to make it appear that it was filmed in Los Angeles. Filming was done in a period of weekends to accommodate the cast and crew\u2019s hectic schedules. ==Cast and crew information== Filmmaker Dermott Petty is from Lisdoonvarna, County Clare, Ireland. His short film 'Paddy Takes A Meeting' has been shown at film festivals worldwide and was featured in \u201cThe Scene,\u201d an exhibition at the Laguna Art Museum which showcases Orange County artists working in all mediums of art.
