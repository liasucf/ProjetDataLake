    "text": "Wireless dating, Widating or Bluedating (from Bluetooth) is a form of dating which makes use of mobile phone and Bluetooth technologies. Subscribers to the service enter details about themselves and about their ideal partner, as they would for other on-line dating services. When their mobile phone comes in the vicinity of that of another subscriber (a radius of about 10 meters) the phones exchange details of the two people. If there is a match, then both users are alerted and can seek each other out and directly chat using Bluetooth (bluechat). Settings can include an option which restricts alerts to subscribers who have a friend in common. A group of researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) have developed a dating application called Bluedating running on mobile phones with Bluetooth. There is also an implementation of wireless dating called Serendipity being pioneered by MIT's Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts (Reported in New Scientist Magazine 20 March 2004.). ==See also== * Mobile dating * Piconet, Scatternet * Toothing * Face time * Lovegety * List of PAN dating software ==External links== * A Bluetooth Scatternet Formation Algorithm Ching Law and Kai-Yeung Siu, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Category:Sexuality and computing Category:Bluetooth Category:Geosocial networking ",
