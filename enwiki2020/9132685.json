    "text": "Sauce africaine is a brown sauce, flavoured with tomatoes, onions, peppers and herbs. It is derived from espagnole sauce (basic brown sauce), one of the five \"mother sauces\" of French cooking. This hearty sauce complements steak, chops, and chicken. Though not as quickly prepared as some other sauces, its basic method is the same as most other \"small\" brown sauces. The tomatoes, onion and bell pepper are cooked with herbs such as basil, thyme and bay leaf), reduced in wine, then combined with the sauce espagnole. ==See also== * List of sauces ==References== Category:Brown sauces Category:French sauces ",
