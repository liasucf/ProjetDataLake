Milutin's task was to travel between the two capitals, cross the border each time, and convey to each king a message from the other when it was too dangerous to write anything down on paper from fear of interception by enemies of the two countries. During the First Balkan War, Milutin with his two sons Mihailo and Mili\u0107 went on active missions from Pljevlja behind enemy lines in Ottoman Turkey. In 1877, carrying a message for Nicholas Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 while running, he traversed a distance from Rijeka Crnojevi\u0107a to Andrijevica, 131 kilometers in one day. Prince Nicholas, when he found out about this, gave him the name Telegraf (Telegraph). People in Vasojevi\u0107i, nicknamed him Milutin Telj. After the May Coup in 1903 and the arrival of Peter Karadjordjevi\u0107 on the Serbian throne, Milutin moved his family to Kragujevac. He entered the service of King Peter as commander of the King's Guard. But whenever the Serbian Chetnik Organization needed him in the so-called Sandjak, as the Ottomans like to call the Serbian region of Ra\u0161ka, he was always ready to avail himself and transport weapons behind enemy lines to arm Serb villagers and rebels alike against the Turks or Albanian bashi-bazouks or Kachaks. Later in life, he moved from Kragujevac to Kosovska Mitrovicawhere he died in 1932. == References == Category:Serbian military personnel Category:1858 births Category:1932 deaths ",
