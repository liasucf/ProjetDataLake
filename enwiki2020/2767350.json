    "text": "...and the youngest Norn, she who is called Skuld, ride ever to take the slain and decide fights...Faroe stamp by Anker Eli Petersen depicting the norns (2003). Skuld (the name possibly means \"debt\" and is related to the English word \"should\") is a Norn in Norse mythology. Along with Ur\u00f0r (Old Norse \"fate\"Orchard (1997:169).) and Ver\u00f0andi (possibly \"happening\" or \"present\"Orchard (1997:174).), Skuld makes up a trio of Norns that are described as deciding the fates of people. Skuld appears in at least two poems as a Valkyrie. ==Poetic Edda== Skuld is mentioned in V\u00f6lusp\u00e1, a poem collected in the 13th century Poetic Edda: {| | :S\u00e1 hon valkyrjur :v\u00edtt um komnar, :g\u00f6rvar at r\u00ed\u00f0a :til Go\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0ar. :Skuld helt skildi, :en Sk\u00f6gul \u00f6nnur, :Gunnr, Hildr, G\u00f6ndul :ok Geirsk\u00f6gul. | :She saw valkyries :come from far and wide, :ready to ride :to Go\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3\u00f0. :Skuld held a shield, :and Sk\u00f6gul was another, :Gunnr, Hildr, G\u00f6ndul :and Geirsk\u00f6gul. |} ==Prose Edda== ===Gylfaginning=== In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, Snorri informs the reader that the youngest Norn, Skuld, is in effect also a valkyrie, taking part in the selection of warriors from the slain: ::These are called Valkyrs: them Odin sends to every battle; they determine men's feyness and award victory. Gudr and R\u00f3ta and the youngest Norn, she who is called Skuld, ride ever to take the slain and decide fights.\"Gylfaginning in translation by Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur (1916), at Sacred Texts. ===Nafna\u00feulur=== In the Nafna\u00feulur addition to Snorri Sturluson's Prose Edda the following sections reference Skuld: {| | :Mank valkyrjur :Vi\u00f0ris nefna. :Hrist, Mist, Herja, :Hl\u00f6kk, Geirav\u00f6r, :G\u00f6ll, Hj\u00f6r\u00ferimul, :Gunnr, Herfj\u00f6tur, :Skuld, Geir\u00f6nul, :Sk\u00f6gul ok Randgn\u00ed\u00f0. :R\u00e1\u00f0gr\u00ed\u00f0r, G\u00f6ndul, :Svipul, Geirsk\u00f6gul, :Hildr ok Skegg\u00f6ld, :Hrund, Geirdriful, :Randgr\u00ed\u00f0r ok \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r, :Reginleif ok Svei\u00f0, :\u00de\u00f6gn, Hjalm\u00ferimul, :\u00derima ok Skalm\u00f6ld. | :I will recite the names :of the valkyries of Vi\u00f0rir (Odin). :Hrist, Mist, Herja, :Hl\u00f6kk, Geirav\u00f6r :G\u00f6ll, Hj\u00f6r\u00ferimul :Gunnr, Herfj\u00f6tur :Skuld, Geir\u00f6nul :Sk\u00f6gul and Randgn\u00ed\u00f0. :R\u00e1\u00f0gr\u00ed\u00f0r, G\u00f6ndul, :Svipul, Geirsk\u00f6gul, :Hildr and Skegg\u00f6ld, :Hrund, Geirdriful, :Randgr\u00ed\u00f0r and \u00der\u00fa\u00f0r, :Reginleif and Svei\u00f0, :\u00de\u00f6gn, Hjalm\u00ferimul, :\u00derima and Skalm\u00f6ld. |} ==See also== * Antevorta * Atropos ==Notes== ==References== * Orchard, Andy (1997).
