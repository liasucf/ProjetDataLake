    "text": "Abdullah is the primary transliteration of the Arabic given name, , built from the Arabic words \u02bfAbd and Allah. The first letter a in Allah in its native pronunciation is unstressed, and is elided following another vowel; in the case of Abdu-llah this is the -u of the Classical Arabic nominative case. It is one of many Arabic theophoric names, meaning servant of God. Gods Follower is also a meaning of this name. Humility before God is an essential value of Islam, hence Abdullah is a common name among Muslims. In particular, the name of the Islamic prophet Muhammad's father was Abdullah. It is also common among Arab Jews, especially Iraqi Jews. The name is cognate to and has the same meaning as the Hebrew Abdiel and, more commonly, Obadiah. There were two Jewish Rabbis in Medina before Islam came; they were Abdullah ibn Salam and Abdullah ibn Shuria. Abdullah ibn Saba was a Yemenite Jew during the spread of Islam. The word Allah exists in the Arabic Talmud and other Jewish scriptures. The variant used in the Russian language is \"\" (Abdulla) (cf. Fedul, which has similar origins), with \"\" (Abdul) and \"\" (Gabdulla) often used in Adyghe.Superanskaya, p. 20 The Christian Arabic Bible uses the word Allah for God. Presently in the Middle East, the name is sometimes used by Christians, as a given or family name. The continued use of this name is perhaps attributed to the passage in Matthew 25:14-30 which refers to the parable of talents and the three servants. The parable praises the good servants. ==Given name== ===Abd-Allah=== * Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy (died 631), leading inhabitant of Medina and contemporary of Muhammad * Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr * Abd Allah ibn Harun al-Rashid better known by his regnal name al-Ma'mun was the seventh Abbasid caliph, who reigned from 813 until his death in 833 CE. ===Abdala=== *Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram, Ecuadorian president 1996\u20131997 *Abdala Faye, Senegalese sculptor ===Abdalla=== *Abdalla El-Masri, Lebanese composer ===Abdallah=== * Abdallah al-Adil (1224\u20131227), Caliph of Morocco * Abdallah Aich (born 1995), Lebanese footballer *Abdallah Abdalsalam Ahmed Bekhit (b. 1983), Egyptian volleyball player * Abdallah Djaballah (born 1956), Algerian politician * Abdallah El-Yafi (1901\u20131986), former Lebanese Prime Minister * Abdallah ibn al-Mu'tazz was an Abbasid Prince, the son of the caliph al-Mu'tazz was a political figure, but is better known as a leading Arabic poet and the author of the Kitab al-Badi, an early study of Arabic forms of poetry.
