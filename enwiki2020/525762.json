Both of these hotels by Engelbert were characterized by elaborate mansards with dormers in the French Second Empire style, although the Grand Central Hotel was clearly the larger and more elaborate of the two. > THE LARGEST HOTEL IN AMERICA Few people who pass through Broadway are aware > that on that bustling thoroughfare, between Amity and Bleecker streets, > there is now in course of erection, on the site of the old Lafarge Hotel, > one of the largest and most magnificent hotels on the Western Continent, > which, when completed, will throw in the shade the largest hotels in this > country - rivalling even the \"Grand Hotel\" at Paris in magnificence.

By this time the building had deteriorated into a welfare hotel, but it housed Art Bar, a successor for a brief time as a venue for the artists and sculptors who had congregated at Max's Kansas City. On the Mercer Street side of the hotel there was the Mercer Arts Center, a complex of live theaters operated by Sy and Cynthia Kaback. The collapse occurred just hours before the theaters were due to be filled with hundreds of patrons.
