    "text": "\"Do You Like Worms?\" (sometimes erroneously referred to as \"Do You Dig Worms?\") is a song written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks in 1966 for the aborted album Smile. The original, unfinished recording of \"Do You Like Worms?\" was first published in 1993 for Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys, a box set which included some unreleased Smile material, and then again in 2011 for The Smile Sessions. In 2004, Wilson performed a live version of Smile with this song under the new title \"Roll Plymouth Rock\". The live and studio Brian Wilson Presents Smile versions are arranged in a similar manner to the original, unfinished versions. The new versions also contain additional lyrics on the verses that were written for the song in 1966 but not previously recorded. Biographer Jon Stebbins stated that the track \"epitomizes the unfinished and schizophrenic nature of Smile. Just the fact that a Beach Boys album almost appeared in 1967 with a song called 'Do You Like Worms?' is a mindblower.\" The song has since been covered by a variety of artists, including The Olivia Tremor Control, Ant-Bee, and Secret Chiefs 3. ==Title meaning== When asked in 2004, co-writer Van Dyke Parks could not remember where the title had originated from, speculating, \"I have a feeling it was maybe an engineer, or maybe Brian, maybe Mike Love. There aren't any other words in the song that relate to that title.\" That same year, Wilson rerecorded the song under the new title \"Roll Plymouth Rock\" with almost all of its original lyrics. When asked about the name change from \"Do You Like Worms?\", Wilson explained, \"Because we wanted something a little more appropriate, you know? Something that sounded more appropriate.\" In 2013, Al Jardine stated: \"I kept yelling at people over at Capitol that there\u2019s not one goddamn lyric about worms on this track. It\u2019s called 'Roll Plymouth Rock'. I defy you to find anything about worms on there. But they wanted to name it 'Do You Like Worms'. Brian added parentheses on his album to make it clear. I\u2019m sure that there was song that Brian and Van Dyke did do called 'Do You Like Worms' that they didn't even play for us. Anyhow, I think what\u2019s there on the original version of Smile is totally cool, and I do like the unfinished nature of it. (laughs) It brings back a lot of really good memories.\" ==Composition== \"Do You Like Worms?\" was imagined as a lyrical journey across the United States from coast to coast; relating mostly to Manifest Destiny and westward expansion. According to Parks, \"It's about bringing this Euro-sensibility into the taming of the American continent, from Plymouth Rock to Waikiki.\" It is seen through the eyes of a protagonist named the \"Bicycle Rider\". Several couplets were written by Parks in 1966, but only few were ever recorded.Lambert, 2007. p. 273 Some of these were later resurrected for future re-recordings by Wilson: > Waving from the ocean liners Beaded cheering Indians behind them Once upon > the Sandwich Islands The social structure steamed upon Hawaii Ribbon of > concrete / Bicycle Rider \u2014 just see what you've done, done To the church of > the American Indians \"Ribbon of concrete\" is a negative image variant to the lyric \"that ribbon of highway\" from the American folk song \"This Land Is Your Land\". The \"Bicycle Rider\" lyric has been established as a reference to the traditional standard \"See See Rider,\" and to the \"Bicycle Rider Back\" playing cards printed by the United States Playing Card Company during the 19th century. The tag's lyric \"mahala lu lei\" refers to a Hawaiian Thanksgiving prayer. One unrecorded couplet follows: > And as we returned to the East or West Indies We always got them confused The song is an extension of the composition \"Heroes and Villains\", recorded during the Smile sessions. \"Do You Like Worms?\" is in strophic form, following the pattern ABABCB' in mixes prepared by Brian Wilson during Smile assemblies. The A sections featured a short instrumental section where the melody is carried by the timpani followed by the lyrics \"rock, rock, roll, Plymouth Rock roll over\" in two-part harmony over the bass guitars. The B section is referred to on tape labels as \"Bicycle Rider\", and it consists of the repetitive \"Heroes and Villains\" motif played on harpsichord. At the end of the B' section, the harpsichord breaks down, only to start up again. The C section has Brian singing fake Hawaiian lyrics over backing vocals by the rest of the band and a sparse backing track.Lambert, Philip: Inside the Music of Brian Wilson, page 273. Continuum Publishing, 2007. ==Recording== The instrumental tracks for the A and C sections of the song were recorded on , at United Western Recorders. Brian also recorded some of his vocals at that session. The Beach Boys vocals were recorded at Columbia Studios, on December 21, 1966. The B sections of the song were recorded during sessions for \"Heroes and Villains\".Doe, Andrew G.: \"GIGS66.\" Bellagio 10452. Retrieved on 2008-12-12. After a fuzz bass was overdubbed on , \"Do You Like Worms?\" was abandoned and never worked on again by the Beach Boys. ===Personnel=== Credits according to Keith Badman.
