She praised the performances of Mathew Thomas and Anaswara Rajan while applauding Vineeth Sreenivasan for his portrayal of a different avatar he hasn't tried so far. According to Soman, \"Tales that take one back in time, especially to the formative years of school days, can almost always be a winner. But, to make it a movie-long memorable affair, it takes enough of clever, relatable fun elements and smart storytelling. Thanneermathan is a story that succeeded in presenting them all, for most parts.\" Sajin Srijith of The New Indian Express called the film a High-school drama done right. He said: \"Not many of us still have vivid memories of our school days, which surely had both pleasant and embarrassing moments that shaped our formative years. However that doesn't seem to be the case with writer-director Girish A. D. who, in his directional debut, manages to evoke with perfect clarity, a lot of situations that look strikingly familiar even if some of them may not have actually happened to you.\" S. R. Praveen of The Hindu praised the film calling it a school story which actually shows what kids do at school, which is not something that can be said about many other school films. He said that the film is School, as it is. == References == ==External links== Category:2010s Malayalam-language films Category:Indian romantic comedy films Category:Indian films Category:2019 romantic comedy films ",
