I brought in a lot of musicians and we were just vibing to a few different things, and that was one of the tracks that stood out to me in the jam session that day. So I tweaked and tweaked the track, edited it and reformatted it, and then eventually ended up with that track.\" 2008 \"The Light Of The Sun\" To Present In 2008, Hutson connected with Musiq Soulchild to produce the very successful ballad \u201cSoBeautiful\u201d.http://www.uaudio.com/blog/jr-hutson-ua-interview/ In 2010, Hutson and Jill Scott officially began production on Scott's album The Light of the Sun.
