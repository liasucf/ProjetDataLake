    "text": "Large burgh was a type of municipal structure in Scotland, which existed from 1930 to 1975. In 1930, the Scottish burghs were split into two types, large and small burghs. The councils of large burghs had more responsibilities and power than those of small burghs. All burghs in Scotland were abolished in 1975 and replaced with the uniform system of districts and regions, which is itself now defunct. (See Subdivisions of Scotland for the modern units of local government in the country.) The large burghs were: {| | *Airdrie *Arbroath *Ayr *Clydebank *Coatbridge *Dumbarton *Dumfries || *Dunfermline *East Kilbride *Falkirk *Greenock *Hamilton *Inverness *Kilmarnock || *Kirkcaldy *Motherwell and Wishaw *Paisley *Perth *Port Glasgow *Rutherglen *Stirling |} ==See also== *Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929 *Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947 ==External links== *Status detail for Large Burgh ",
