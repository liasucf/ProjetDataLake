Records, containing an additional track, \"Country One.\" ==Production== The album was recorded in Berlin. The recording took 14 days. The cover used a painting by Claus Castenskiold, the Danish-born painter. ==Release== The album did well on the independent and college charts, peaking at #3 on the UK indie and #1 on the CMJ charts. ==Critical reception== Trouser Press wrote: \"On songs like 'The Breaking Hands' ... producer Robin Guthrie of the Cocteau Twins spins a delicately layered web of sound; more straightforward numbers like the shimmying 'Thunderhead' recast the old energy in slightly more linear terms, although guest Blixa Bargeld does his best to tilt 'Yellow Eyes' on its axis.\" The Rolling Stone Album Guide called the album \"swamp music for thinking people.\" == Track listing == ===Original 1987 album=== All tracks composed by Jeffrey Lee Pierce # \"Bill Bailey\" \u2013 3:39 # \"Thunderhead\" \u2013 3:28 # \"Lupita Screams\" \u2013 3:12 # \"Yellow Eyes\" \u2013 6:30 # \"The Breaking Hands\" \u2013 4:12 # \"Araby\" \u2013 3:01 # \"Heart\" \u2013 3:59 # \"My Cousin Kim\" \u2013 2:47 # \"Port of Souls\" \u2013 4:49 ===2005 Remaster (SFTRI 765)=== All tracks composed by Jeffrey Lee Pierce # \"Bill Bailey\" # \"Thunderhead\" # \"Lupita Screams\" # \"Yellow Eyes\" # \"The Breaking Hands\" # \"Araby\" # \"Heart\" # \"My Cousin Kim\" # \"Port of Souls\" # \"Crabdance\" # \"Nobody's City\" == Personnel == ;The Gun Club * Jeffrey Lee Pierce - vocals, guitar, whistle * Kid Congo Powers - guitar * Romi Mori - bass; lead guitar on \"The Breaking Hands\" * Nick Sanderson - drums with: * Blixa Bargeld - guitar on \"Yellow Eyes\" ;Technical *Lincoln Fong - engineer *Andr\u00e9 Giere - assistant engineer *Claus Castenskiold - sleeve painting == References == Category:1987 albums Category:The Gun Club albums Category:Albums produced by Robin Guthrie ",
