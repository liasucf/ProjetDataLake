    "text": "cis-Dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) is the coordination complex with the formula RuCl2(bipy)2, where bipy is 2,2'-bipyridine. It is a dark green diamagnetic solid that is a precursor to many other complexes of ruthenium, mainly by substitution of the two chloride ligands. The compound has been crystallized as diverse hydrates. ==Synthesis and structure== The complex is prepared by heating a DMF solution of ruthenium trichloride and bipyridine. With octahedral coordination geometry, the complex exists exclusively as the chiral cis isomer. The corresponding Ru(III) salts are also known. ==References== Category:Ruthenium complexes Category:Coordination compounds ",
