    "text": "Elegy is the third studio album by Finnish metal band Amorphis. It is their first to feature a majority of clean vocals, sung by new vocalist Pasi Koskinen. The music and lyrics are inspired by the traditional Finnish ballads and poems compiled in the Kanteletar by Elias L\u00f6nnrot in 1840. The primary genre of the album is progressive metal, with strong folk influence, as well as elements of melodic death metal and heavy metal. Many of the album's tracks, e.g. \"Against Widows\", have become fan favorites and have been performed in concerts since Elegy's release. In 2004, Relapse Records reissued Elegy as a digipak, featuring four live bonus tracks. The songs \"Against Widows\", \"On Rich and Poor\", \"My Kantele\", and \"Song of the Troubled One\" were all re-recorded on Magic & Mayhem \u2013 Tales from the Early Years. \"My Kantele\" was covered on Live & Acoustic by Thurisaz. ==Track listing== ===Bonus CDs=== === Notes === # Songs recorded live at Ilosaarirock, Finland, on 12 July 1997. ==Personnel== ===Amorphis=== *Pasi Koskinen \u2013 clean/lead vocals (1\u20136, 8, 9, 11), occasional growling (2, 6) *Esa Holopainen \u2013 lead guitar *Tomi Koivusaari \u2013 rhythm guitar, co-vocal/death growl (1, 2, 4\u20139); tambourine *Olli-Pekka Laine \u2013 bass *Kim Rantala \u2013 keyboards *Pekka Kasari \u2013 drums ===Additional personnel=== * Mixed at Parr Street Studios, Liverpool, England * Engineer: Pete Coleman * Assistant engineer: Dave Buchanan * Mastered by Dave Shirk at SAE Mastering * Produced by Amorphis and Hiili Hiilesmaa. * Executive producers: William J.
