    "text": "The Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics is a peer- reviewed scientific journal published biweekly by IOP Publishing. It was established in 1968 from the division of the earlier title, Proceedings of the Physical Society. In 2006, the Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical Optics was merged with the Journal of Physics B. The editor-in-chief is Marc Vrakking (Max Born Institute for Nonlinear Optics and Short Pulse Spectroscopy). ==Scope== The journal covers research on atomic, molecular physics and optical physics which is known by researchers in the field as \"AMO physics\". Topics include atomic and molecular structure, spectra and collisions, ultracold matter, quantum optics and non linear optics, quantum information, laser physics, intense laser fields, ultrafast and x-ray physics and atomic and molecular physics in plasmas. The journal publishes research papers, Fast Track Communications (FTCs), topical reviews, tutorials and invited articles. It publishes Special Issues on developing research fields. == Abstracting and indexing == The Journal of Physics B is abstracted and indexed in: ==See also== * Journal of Physics == References == ==External links== * *Journal of Optics B: Quantum and Semiclassical Optics website Category:IOP Publishing academic journals Category:Physics journals Category:Publications established in 1968 Category:Biweekly journals Category:English-language journals Category:Hybrid open access journals ",
