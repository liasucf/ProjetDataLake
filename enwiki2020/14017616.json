The present-day parish is known as Shottle and Postern. It was annexed to the Duchy of Lancaster after the rebellion by Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby. It is thought to have passed to the Earl of Shrewsbury during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. It was sold in 1630 by Philip, Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, to Christian, the wife of William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Devonshire.Daniel and Samuel Lysons (1817) Magna Britannia: volume 5 Pages 129\u2013142 'Parishes: Doveridge \u2013 Duffield', http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=50727. Date accessed: 24 October 2007. Shottle is a rather straggling rural village spread out on the road from Shottlegate to Wirksworth via Alport Height (Chequer Lane). Its main industry was, and remains, agriculture. Shottle Hall dates from 1841 and is a pleasant building in the late Georgian style, now used mainly for weddings and events. Whilst some way out of the village itself, Shottle has its own railway station \u2013 called Shottle after Shottle Hall, which is nearby. The station, which is on the Wirksworth Branch, was closed in 1947 to passengers and the building is owned by Peak Oil Ltd. The railway line has been reopened to passengers as the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway. ==References== : ==External links== Category:Villages in Derbyshire Category:Towns and villages of the Peak District Category:Geography of Amber Valley ",
