    "text": "The Wupper is a right tributary of the Rhine in the state of North Rhine- Westphalia, Germany. Rising near Marienheide in western Sauerland it runs through the mountainous region of the Bergisches Land in Berg County and enters the Rhine at Leverkusen, south of D\u00fcsseldorf. Its upper course is called the Wipper. M\u00fcngsten Bridge between Remscheid and Solingen. On its course of about 116 km, the Wupper passes through the city of Wuppertal where the suspension railway runs for 10 kilometres above the river. It is crossed by the highest railway bridge in Germany near M\u00fcngsten, between Remscheid and Solingen. A few kilometers further down, Burg Castle is located on a hill overlooking the river. ==Hydropower== From the 15th century, the Wupper and its numerous streams gave birth to hundreds of workshops, mills and factories on their banks. Originally water was used for dying, bleaching and washing canvas and cloth, later it was used to power machines or transport waste. The Wupper thus facilitated the early industrial expansion of Wuppertal (German for \"Wupper Valley\") during the 18th, 19th and early 20th century. The Wupper Valley was one of world's first industrialized regions and empowered inter alia the Ruhrgebiet as a coal-mining region.
