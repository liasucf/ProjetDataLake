Calgary's skyline seen from the Max Bell Centre At a municipal population of as of April 1, 2018, and a metropolitan population of as of July 1, 2016, Calgary is both the largest city and largest metropolitan area in the Canadian province of Alberta. Standing at 56 stories, , the tallest building in the city is Brookfield Place. The second-tallest building in the city is The Bow, standing at 58-storeys, . The third-tallest building in the city is the 60-storey, Telus Sky, which surpassed the Suncor Energy Centre upon its completion in 2020. The Calgary Tower is included in this list for comparison purposes; however, it is not ranked since it is not considered a habitable building. Calgary's history of towers began with the Grain Exchange Building (1910), the Fairmont Palliser Hotel (1914), and the Elveden Centre. Building construction remained slow in the city until the early 1970s. From 1970 to 1990, Calgary witnessed a major expansion of skyscraper and high-rise construction. Many of the city's office towers were completed during this period, such as the First Canadian Centre and the Canterra Tower office towers. A ten-year lull in building construction came after the expansion, though Calgary experienced a larger second building expansion beginning in the late 90s and continuing into the present. Currently, the city has height restrictions that prevent any building from casting a shadow over the Bow River and the city hall, however, winter months are excluded from this limit. There is no other imposed limits elsewhere in the city, which could allow for some extremely tall buildings. The Bow Tower was originally proposed to be at least 1,000 feet tall but reduced to comply with these rules. Calgary hosts 373 buildings over complete and under construction, 82 of which are or more and are all in the downtown area. This is the second highest concentration of skyscrapers in Canada, behind Downtown Toronto. , there are 10 skyscrapers over under construction, along with another 34 skyscrapers over approved and proposed, with a further 56 high-rises over under construction, approved for construction, and proposed for construction in the City of Calgary. After this skyscraper boom, Calgary's skyline will have dramatically changed, having added at least the second tallest and fourth tallest buildings in Western Canada between 2016 and 2018, Brookfield Place East and Telus Sky respectively. ==Buildings== Brookfield Place, tallest building in Calgary. The Bow Telus Sky under construction in May 2019 This list ranks buildings in Calgary that stand at least 100 metres (328 ft) tall, based on CTBUH height measurement standards. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. Freestanding observation and/or telecommunication towers, while not habitable buildings, are included for comparison purposes; however, they are not ranked. One such tower is the Calgary Tower. {| class= \"wikitable sortable\" |+Buildings completed as of February, 2017 ! Rank ! Building ! Address ! Height ! Floors ! Completed !
