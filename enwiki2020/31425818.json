According to the twentieth chapter of the Quran, Samiri created the calf while Moses was away for 40 days on Mount Sinai, receiving the Ten Commandments.The Qur'an, Surah Ta Ha, Ayah 85 In contrast to the account given in the Hebrew Bible, the Quran does not blame Aaron for the calf\u2019s creation. ==In the Quran== In Ta-Ha, the Quran\u2019s twentieth surah, Moses is informed that Samiri has led his people astray in Moses\u2019 absence. He returns to his people to berate them, and is informed of what Samiri has done. :They said, \u2018We did not fail our tryst with you of our own accord, but we were laden with the weight of the people\u2019s ornaments, and we cast them [into the fire] and so did the Samiri throw.\u2019 Then he produced for them a calf \u2014a [lifeless] body with a low\u2014 and they said, This is your god and the god of Musa (Moses), so he forgot! Did they not see that it did not answer them, nor could it bring them any benefit or harm? Haroun (Aaron) had certainly told them earlier, \u2018O my people! You are only being tested by it. Indeed your Lord is the All-beneficent. So follow me and obey my command!\u2019 :[Moses] said, \u201cAnd what is your case, O Samiri?\u201d He said, \u201cI saw what they did not see, so I took a handful [of dust] from the track of the messenger and threw it, thus did my soul entice me.\u201d [Moses] said, \u201cThen go. And indeed, it is [decreed] for you in [this] life to say, 'No contact.\u2019 And indeed, you have an appointment [in the Hereafter] you will not fail to keep. And look at your 'god\u2019 to which you remained devoted. We will surely burn it and blow it [i.e., its ashes] into the sea with a blast. ==In Islamic tradition== The Quran\u2019s statement that Samiri\u2019s calf made a \"lowing\" sound has resulted in much speculation. A number of Islamic traditions say that the calf was made with dust trodden upon by the horse of the angel Gabriel, which had mystical properties. Some traditions say that the calf could also move, a property granted to it by the dust of the \u201chorse of life\u201d. Other traditions suggest that Samiri made the sound himself, or that it was only the wind.Rubin, Uri. \"Tradition in Transformation: the Ark of the Covenant and the Golden Calf in Biblical and Islamic Historiography,\" Oriens (Volume 36, 2001): 202. Still others say that the calf was formed by Allah himself, as a test for the Hebrew people.Albayrak, I. (2002). Isra\u2019iliyyat and Classical Exegetes\u2019 Comments on the Calf with a Hollow Sound Q.20: 83-98/ 7: 147-155 with Special Reference to Ibn \u2019Atiyya. Journal of Semitic Studies, 47(1), 39\u201365. doi:10.1093/jss/47.1.39 Later traditions expand upon the fate of those who worshiped the calf. Works by al-Tabari include a story in which Moses orders his people to drink from the water into which the calf had been flung; those guilty of worshiping it were revealed when they turned a golden hue. Moses ordered his people to kill them, resulting in thousands of casualties, but the carnage stopped after Moses begged Allah to stop the violence. Samiri's punishment has been interpreted as total social isolation by most scholars.Albayrak, I. (2002). Isra\u2019iliyyat and Classical Exegetes\u2019 Comments on the Calf with a Hollow Sound Q.20: 83-98/ 7: 147-155 with Special Reference to Ibn \u2019Atiyya. Journal of Semitic Studies, 47(1), 39\u201365. doi:10.1093/jss/47.1.39 ==Identity== Scholars of Islam have linked Samiri to various individuals mentioned in the Bible. Due to the fact that as- Samiri can mean the Samaritan,Rubin, Uri. \"Tradition in Transformation: the Ark of the Covenant and the Golden Calf in Biblical and Islamic Historiography,\" Oriens (Volume 36, 2001): 202. some believe that his character is a reference to the worship of the golden calves built by Jeroboam of Samaria, conflating the two idol-worshiping incidents into one. Samiri has also been linked to the rebel Hebrew leader Zimri on the basis of their similar names and a shared theme of rebellion against Moses\u2019 authority.Rubin, Uri. \"Tradition in Transformation: the Ark of the Covenant and the Golden Calf in Biblical and Islamic Historiography,\" Oriens (Volume 36, 2001): 202. Others link him to the Mesopotamian city of Samarra and suggest that he came from a cow-worshiping people, giving his name as Musa bin Zafar. There is no consensus among Islamic scholars on which, if any, of these identifications is correct. ==In the Baha'i Faith== The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith portrays Samiri as a magician who led people away from the \u201cknowledge and justice\u201d of Moses to ignorance. He is mentioned in the \u201cKit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n\u201d, the primary theological work of the Baha'i religion. ==See also== * Moses in Islam * Aaron * Golden calf ==References== Category:People of the Quran Category:Tribe of Simeon ",
