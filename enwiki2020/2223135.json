Kravtsov, \"Reconstruction of the Temple by Charles Chipiez and Its Application in Architecture,\" Ars Judaica, Vol. 4, 2008 The building on Herzl Street was a major Tel Aviv landmark until 1962, when the site was razed for the construction of the Shalom Meir Tower, the tallest building in Israel those days. The destruction of the building sparked widespread recognition of the importance of conserving historical landmarks. The Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites in Israel was founded in the 1980s partly in response to the fate of Herzliya Hebrew High School. ===The current building=== Located today on Jabotinsky Street, it serves as a six-year secondary school. The modern campus is entered through a gate that is a replica of the facade of the 1909 building. ==Principals== Jabotinsky street. The gate was built in 2006. Former principals include Haim Bograshov, Baruch Ben Yehuda and Carmi Yogev. In 1992, former Air Force fighter pilot and Brigadier General Ron Huldai was appointed principal.
