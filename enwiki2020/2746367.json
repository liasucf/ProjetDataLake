    "text": "Timecode is a 2000 American experimental film written and directed by Mike Figgis and featuring a large ensemble cast, including Salma Hayek, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Suzy Nakamura, Kyle MacLachlan, Saffron Burrows, Holly Hunter, Julian Sands, Xander Berkeley, Leslie Mann and M\u00eda Maestro. The film is constructed from four continuous 93-minute takes that were filmed simultaneously by four cameras; the screen is divided into quarters, and the four shots are shown simultaneously. The film depicts several groups of people in Los Angeles as they interact and conflict while preparing for the shooting of a movie in a production office. The dialogue was largely improvised, and the sound mix of the film is designed so that the most significant of the four sequences on screen dominates the soundtrack at any given moment. == Plot == The film takes place in and around a film production company office, and involves several interweaving plot threads which include a young actress named Rose (Salma Hayek) who tries to score a screen test from her secret boyfriend Alex Green (Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd), a noted but disillusioned director. Meanwhile, Rose's tryst with him is discovered by her girlfriend Lauren (Jeanne Tripplehorn), an insanely jealous businesswoman who plants a microphone in Rose's purse and spends most of the time in the back of her limousine parked outside the office building listening in on Rose's conversations. Elsewhere, Alex's wife Emma (Saffron Burrows) is seen with a therapist (Glenne Headly) debating about asking him for a divorce. In the meantime, numerous film industry types (played by Xander Berkeley, Golden Brooks, Holly Hunter and Kyle MacLachlan), pitch ideas for the next big hit film. ==Cast== split-screen technique used throughout Timecode * Xander Berkeley as Evan Wantz * Golden Brooks as Onyx Richardson * Saffron Burrows as Emma Green * Viveka Davis as Victoria Cohen * Richard Edson as Lester Moore * Aimee Graham as Sikh Nurse * Salma Hayek as Rose * Glenne Headly as Dava Adair, Therapist * Andrew Heckler as Auditioning Actor * Holly Hunter as Renee Fishbine, Executive * Danny Huston as Randy * Daphna Kastner as Auditioning Actress * Patrick Kearney as Drug House Owner * Elizabeth Low as Penny, Evan's Assistant * Kyle MacLachlan as Bunny Drysdale * M\u00eda Maestro as Ana Pauls * Leslie Mann as Cherine * Suzy Nakamura as Connie Ling * Alessandro Nivola as Joey Z * Zuleikha Robinson as Lester Moore's Assistant * Julian Sands as Quentin * Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd as Alex Green * Jeanne Tripplehorn as Lauren * Steven Weber as Darren In the first run through, Headly's role as Dava Adair was performed by Laurie Metcalf. == Production == The movie was shot with four hand-held digital cameras, in one take, on the sixteenth performance. Largely improvised, Figgis provided the actors with blank, four-staff music manuscript paper, with each octave representing a camera view at that particular moment in time, up to the 93 minutes of camera capacity. The actors themselves personally kept track of the activities occurring in other camera points of view that were relative to their performance. Rehearsals were single-take performances, filmed over fifteen days. Filmed in the mornings, with the actors fully involved, the footage was reviewed and discussed in the afternoons. Four separate monitors replayed each camera point of view simultaneously. The first rehearsal recording was included as a bonus feature on the film's 2000 DVD release. The film's action ends with closing activity in three quadrants and the following statement (no capitalization beyond film's title) in the fourth quadrant: ==See also== * List of films featuring surveillance ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:2000 films Category:2000 drama films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:American independent films Category:Camcorder films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Mike Figgis Category:American avant-garde and experimental films Category:Screen Gems films Category:Films scored by Anthony Marinelli Category:Self-reflexive films Category:Films about time Category:Hyperlink films Category:2000s avant-garde and experimental films Category:One-shot films ",
