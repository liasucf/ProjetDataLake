    "text": "John o' Groats () is a village northeast of Canisbay, Caithness, in the far north of Scotland. John o' Groats lies on Great Britain's northeastern tip, and is popular with tourists as one end of the longest distance between two inhabited British points on the mainland, with Land's End in Cornwall lying southwest. However, it is not the northernmost point of Great Britain, which is the nearby Dunnet Head. John o' Groats is from London, from Edinburgh, from the Orkney Isles and from the North Pole. It is from the uninhabited Island of Stroma. In summer, a ferry operates between John o' Groats and Burwick on South Ronaldsay in Orkney.John O'Groats ferry website ==Name== The settlement takes its name from Jan de Groot, a 15th-century Dutchman who once plied a ferry from the Scottish mainland to Orkney, which had recently been acquired from Norway by King James IV. Local legend has that the \"o' Groats\" refers to John's charge of one groat for use of his ferry, but it actually derives from the Dutch de groot, meaning \"the large\". People from John o' Groats are known as \"Groaters\". The name John o' Groats has a particular resonance because it is often used as a starting or ending point for cycles, walks and charitable events to and from Land's End (at the extreme south-western tip of the Cornish peninsula in England). The phrase Land's End to John o' Groats is frequently heard both as a literal journey (being the longest possible in Great Britain) and as a metaphor for great or all-encompassing distance, similar to the American phrase coast to coast. Also, for many years it was the northern terminal of the A9 trunk road, which now ends at Scrabster. ==Demography== In 2007, the population of John o' Groats was about 300.John o' Groats tourist information, 29 October 2007 The village is dispersed but has a linear centre with council housing, sports park and a shop which is on the main road from the nearest town of Wick.

Visitors paid a fee for a photograph of themselves next to the signpost displaying either a message or the date and distance to a location of their choice. The original site was bought in 2013 as part of the hotel redevelopment, and the signpost moved to a caravan park away. When the hotel reopened, a publicly accessible signpost was erected at the original site, without customisable text. ==Sport== John o' Groats FC plays in the Caithness Amateur Football Association. ==Book Festival== The John O'Groat Book Festival was held for the first time in 2018.
