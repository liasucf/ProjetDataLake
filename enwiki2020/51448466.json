The review opined that Nihonmatsu \"handles with considerably more skill than his prior Shochiku effort\" and that \"Genre films don't often cover as much ground stylistically or thematically as Genocide, let alone get more bleak (the film ultimately hinges on the potential detonation of a hydrogen bomb and the single mother that may have to single-handedly repopulate a country), but as the last horror film Shochiku would produce, it's suitably ambitious and apocalyptic in its finality.\" Sight & Sound described Genocide as an \"accident of a film\" that \"plays mostly as a national symptom, in a legacy of scenarios devised both to make sense of, and to reduce to pulp the memories of nuclear heat-death\". ==See also== * List of horror films of 1968 * List of Japanese films of 1968 * List of science fiction films of the 1960s == References == ===Footnotes=== ===Sources=== * * ==External links== * Category:1968 films Category:1968 horror films Category:1960s science fiction horror films Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Japanese science fiction horror films Category:Shochiku films Category:Films scored by Shunsuke Kikuchi ",
