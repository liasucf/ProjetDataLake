Bundesliga overall and first since promotion. ==Background== Darmstadt 98 played in their 117th season in the 2. Bundesliga after having been promoted after a dramatic relegation-promotion playoff against Arminia Bielefeld in which the deciding goal was scored in the 122nd minute. This was widely seen as a sensation, as Darmstadt were supposed to be relegated in the 2012\u201313 season but were spared due to their rivals having their licence revoked because of going into administration. The promotion finished a 21\u2013year run outside of the 2. Bundesiga. ==Competitions== ===2.
