    "text": "The flag of Goshen was the official flag of the short-lived South African territory of Goshen from 1883 to 1885. It is currently used in the Cenotaph Hall of the Voortrekker Monument. ==History== The state of Goshen arose from a war in Bechuanaland in 1881-82. It was established by a group of mercenaries who had fought in the war. Goshen's independence was short-lived, though, as it was occupied by British forces in March 1885, and was later incorporated into British Bechuanaland. The executive council resolved on 5 March 1883 that the flag which they had flown during the war would be the official flag of their new state. ==Description== The flag was evidently modelled on the 'vierkleur' Flag of the South African Republic. The official description was : > Green against the hoist, and across from it black, white and red below each > other. Ploeger, J. (1988).
