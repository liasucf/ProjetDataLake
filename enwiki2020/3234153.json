Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons wins the game's MVP award. To add to the All-Star Weekend festivities, 5-foot-7-inch Spud Webb of the Atlanta Hawks wins the slam-dunk competition. The first three-point shootout was also held, won by Larry Bird (his first of three consecutive). *The Kings relocate from Kansas City, Missouri to Sacramento, California. They played their home games at ARCO Arena I for three seasons while ARCO Arena II was under construction. *The Chicago Bulls are the last Eastern Conference team in NBA history to lose 50 or more games in a season and still make the playoffs. *The Boston Celtics post an impressive 40\u20131 (.976) record at home. Their only regular-season home loss occurred on December 6, 1985, to the Portland Trail Blazers, by the score of 121\u2013103. The record would be tied by the San Antonio Spurs in the 2015\u201316 season. The Celtics would also win all 10 of their home games in the postseason. *This season marks the first time the NBA hands out a Most Improved Player award at the end of a season.

In Game 2 of the Eastern Conference First Round series, Jordan scored 63 points against Boston, an NBA playoff record, but his Chicago Bulls would lose in double overtime. *All Midwest Division teams make the playoffs, the first time an entire division had done this since the 1983\u201384 season when all Atlantic Division teams made the playoffs. *The first NBA draft of the Lottery Era was conducted at the Felt Forum of Madison Square Garden in New York City.

This marked the second and last time in the 1980s a team other than the Lakers represented the West in the NBA Finals (1981, also by the Rockets). The Rockets fell in six games to the Boston Celtics, a similar result to their previous meeting five years earlier. *Detlef Schrempf became the first German player to enter the NBA.

Houston Rockets guard John Lucas was also suspended by the team for a similar violation; had he not been suspended, he would've played in the NBA Finals for the first time. * On Wednesday, October 30, 1985, forward Georgi Glouchkov arrived in the U.S. from Bulgaria to play for the Phoenix Suns.

It was the fewest points scored by a team in 13 years \u2013 since an October 21, 1972 game in which the Buffalo Braves managed only 63 against the Milwaukee Bucks. Indiana's 64 was the fourth lowest total since the NBA implemented the 24-second shot clock in 1954\u201355. *The Los Angeles Lakers started the season 19\u20132. *On Wednesday, December 25, 1985, in a matchup of one of the worst teams in the league (New York Knicks, 10-19) against one of the best (Boston Celtics, 21-7), the Knicks defeated Boston in double overtime, 113\u2013104.

The Celtics maintained the league's best record for the remainder of the season. *On Thursday, February 6, 1986, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar of the Los Angeles Lakers scored 46 points in a game against the Houston Rockets, his highest single- game total since a 48-point performance against the Portland Trail Blazers on November 26, 1975. The Lakers defeated the Rockets 117\u201395. *On Sunday, February 16, 1986, in the season's second matchup between the Celtics and Lakers, Boston won again, 105\u201399. *On Tuesday, February 18, 1986, Alvin Robertson of the San Antonio Spurs recorded the second quadruple-double in NBA history.
