    "text": "Amyloid deposition in aortic stenosis shown by DPD scan A DPD scan is a type of nuclear medicine imaging test which uses radioactive technetium-99m (99mTc) and 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD) to diagnose cardiac amyloidosis. The radiopharmaceutical is taken up only in patients with ATTR amyloidosis, making it a useful tool to differentiate from AL amyloidosis. DPD is a diphosphonate and can be used as an alternative to HDP or MDP in nuclear medicine bone scintigraphy. ==Procedure== DPD scanning typically uses a gamma camera to obtain SPECT images, with an injection followed by an initial scan after 5 minutes, and a second scan after 3 hours. Images are often scored using the \"Perugini system\" whereby: * Grade 0 \u2013 no cardiac uptake and normal bone uptake * Grade 1 \u2013 cardiac uptake which is less intense than the bone signal * Grade 2 \u2013 cardiac uptake with intensity similar or greater than bone signal * Grade 3 \u2013 cardiac uptake with much attenuated or absent bone signal ==Availability== DPD is not currently available in the United States. ==See also== *SAP scan ==References== Category:Nuclear medicine procedures Category:Amyloidosis ",
