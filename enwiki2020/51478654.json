    "text": "The Death of Caesar () is an 1867 painting by the French artist Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me. It depicts the moment after the assassination of Julius Caesar, when the jubilant conspirators are walking away from Caesar's dead body at the Theatre of Pompey, on the Ides of March (March 15), 44 BC. The painting is kept at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. > Characteristically, G\u00e9r\u00f4me has depicted not the incident itself, but its > immediate aftermath. The illusion of reality that G\u00e9r\u00f4me imparted to his > paintings with his smooth, polished technique led one critic to comment, \"If > photography had existed in Caesar's day, one could believe that the picture > was painted from a photograph taken on the spot at the very moment of the > catastrophe.\" G\u00e9r\u00f4me's depiction of the aftermath of violence can also be seen in The Execution of Marshal Ney, The Duel After the Masquerade, and Jerusalem. ==Exhibitions== The Walters indicates that the work has been included in the following exhibitions: *I, Claudius: Art in the Age of Julio-Claudians.
