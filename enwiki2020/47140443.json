    "text": "The Flag of Batangas is a horizontal triband of blue, white and red \u2014 the main colors of the Philippine flag \u2014 with the provincial seal in the center. ==Specifications== The flag has a width-to-length proportion of 1:2. In the unveiling ceremony for the flag, the sample construction sheet provides a width of 3 feet (36 inches) and a length of 6 feet (72 inches). The top (blue) and bottom (red) stripes have widths of 7 inches each, while the middle (white) stripe is given a width of 22 inches. The provincial seal is given a diameter of 20.5 inches. ==History== The current flag design was adopted in 2009, and is known as the \"Vilma Santos Administration Provincial Flag\" due to being adopted during Governor Vilma Santos' term. The previous flag of Batangas was a predominantly white flag with a narrow blue stripe at the bottom. This stripe was surmounted by the words \"BATANGAS PROVINCE\" and a gold-colored bull, courant toward the provincial seal located on the upper part of the fly. This flag was replaced due to its resemblance to the flag of the U.S. state of California. Other proposals considered in replacing the old flag involved: incorporating the image of revered Katipunan figure and Batangas native Apolinario Mabini; incorporating a chevron design; and restoring the old flag format of a plain purple flag with the updated provincial seal in the center. ==References== flag Batangas Batangas ",
