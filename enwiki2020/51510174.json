    "text": "Dromaeosauripus is an ichnogenus that has been attributed to dinosaurs. Dromaeosauripus footprints have been found at Dinosaur Ridge in the United States, Bito Island Tracksite in South Korea's Bito Island, and the Hekou Group in China. Dromaeosauripus footprints were probably made by dromaeosaurs. == Dromaeosauripus yongjingensis == In 2012, D. yongjingensis was described from tracks in the Hekou Group. D. yongjingensis shows prominent toe and heel pads. Heel pads are apparently absent in other Dromaeosauripus, probably due to behavior, preservation, and/or substrate consistency. ==See also== * List of dinosaur ichnogenera * Ichnology ==References== Category:Dinosaur trace fossils ",
