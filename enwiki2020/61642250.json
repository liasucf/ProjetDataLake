It is located in the northwestern part of the Kivist\u00f6 area, close to the border of Nurmij\u00e4rvi municipality and its largest village, Klaukkala. On the Vantaa side, the neighboring districts are Riipil\u00e4, Seutula, Kivist\u00f6, Keimola and Vestra. Luhtaanm\u00e4ki rises from the Valley of River Vantaa in a sparsely populated rural area. The beautiful profile of Luhtaanm\u00e4ki with its old buildings is drawn in the middle of a riverbed and rolling fields. There are still several buildings of cultural and historical value in Luhtaanm\u00e4ki, such as the exceptionally large military office of Grips from the 1860s. An old and handsome arched stone bridge, which is no longer used in road traffic, crosses the river called Luhtaanm\u00e4enjoki between Luhtaanm\u00e4ki and Keimola. The protected cultural landscape of the River Vantaa is partly located in the Luhtaanm\u00e4ki district, where Luhtaanm\u00e4enjoki joins the main riverbank of River Vantaa. ==References== Category:Districts of Vantaa ",
