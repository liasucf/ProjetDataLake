The term Sadan probably derives from Nishada, referring to an ethnic group of North India. ==History== Bhimbetka The Chota Nagpur plateau region has been inhabited since the Neolithic period. Several stone tools and microliths from the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods were discovered in this region. In the Bhimbetka rock shelters, a 9,000-year- old Mesolithic painting of a group dance is similar to the Sadani folk dance Jhumair. During the Neolithic period, agriculture started in South Asia. Several Neolithic settlements have been found in sites such as Jhusi, Lahuradewa, Mehergarh, Bhirrana, Rakhigarhi, and Chirand. In the Kabra-Kala mound at the confluence of the Son and North Koel rivers in Palamu district, various antiquities and art objects from the Neolithic to medieval periods have been found; the pot-sherds of redware, black and red ware, black ware, black slipped ware, and NBP ware are from the Chalcolithic to late medieval periods. There are ancient cave paintings in Isko, Hazaribagh district, from the Meso-chalcolithic period (9,000-5,000 BC). Iron slag, microliths, and potsherds from 1400 BCE, according to carbon dating, were discovered in Singhbhum district. During the late Vedic period, several janapadas emerged in northern India. Several Nishada kingdoms probably existed in Jharkhand during that time. In the 6th century BCE, the mahajanapadas emerged in several parts of the Indian subcontinent. Some parts of present-day Jharkhand were parts of the Magadha and Anga mahajanapadas. In the Mauryan period, this region was ruled by a number of states, collectively known as the Atavika (forest) states. These states accepted the suzerainty of the Maurya empire during Ashoka's reign (c. 232 BCE). During the medieval period, the Nagvanshi, Ramgarh Raj, and Chero dynasties were ruling this region. The Mughal influence reached this area during the reign of Emperor Akbar when it was invaded by Raja Mansingh in 1574. There was several invasion during Mughal rule. Influence of the British East India Company reached this region in the 18th century. Raghunath Mahato led a revolt against the East India company in the Jungle Mahals in 1769. Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo and Pandey Ganpat Rai led rebels against the East India company in the 1857 Rebellion. Tikait Umrao Singh, Sheikh Bhikhari, Nadir Ali, Jai Mangal Singh played pivotal role in Indian Rebellion of 1857. After independence this region became parts of Bihar state. In November 2000, the new state of Jharkhand separated from Bihar. == Castes and ethnic groups == Various Sadan communities include Ahir, Binjhia, Bhogta, Bhuiya, Chik Baraik, Gosain, Ghasi, Jhora, Kewat, Kharwar, Koeri, Kumhar, Rautia, Kudumi Mahato, Kurmi, Lohra, Tanti , Teli, Rajput, Bania and Lohar among others. ==Culture== Jhumair is a common folk dance of Sadan.
