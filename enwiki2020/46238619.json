    "text": "Husnes Church () is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Kvinnherad Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. It is located in the village of Husnes. It one of the three churches for the Husnes og Holmedal parish which is part of the Sunnhordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1874 using designs by the architect J. Utne. The church seats about 280 people. ==History== This church has existed since the middle ages. The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1337, but it was not new that year. The first church was located at Kaldestad, about southwest of the present site of the church. At that time, it was called Kaldestad Church. That church was likely a stave church. Some time before 1660, the old church was torn down and replaced by a timber-framed church. In 1874, the church was no longer able to fit the congregation and a new, larger church was needed. A new church was built about to the northeast in the village of Husnes, and it was renamed Husnes Church. The new church was consecrated on 11 September 1874 and the old church was torn down soon after. ==See also== *List of churches in Bj\u00f8rgvin ==References== Category:Kvinnherad Category:Churches in Vestland Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:19th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1874 Category:14th-century establishments in Norway ",
