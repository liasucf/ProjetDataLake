The group is composed of vocalist Dara Kiely, guitarist Alan Duggan, bassist Daniel Fox and drummer Adam Faulkner. == History == === Early years === The band was formed in Dublin in July 2011 by vocalist Dara Kiely, guitarist Alan Duggan, bassist Daniel Fox and drummer Adam Faulkner. Prior to Girl Band, Dara Kiely, Alan Duggan and Daniel Fox played in the indie rock band Harrows. Harrows formed when the members were in secondary school at the age of 16 and was described by Kiely and Fox as \"a shit version of the Strokes\". They did not sign to a record label whilst active and have uploaded what few songs they had recorded to YouTube and Myspace. In April 2012 they released their debut single \"In My Head\" on Any Other City Records. They self-financed a music video for the track \"Leave Again\". Kiely played drums in Harrows and it was not until after Harrows disbanded that he attempted singing. The band followed the single with the self-produced France 98 EP which was recorded live and released through Any Other City. They then recorded a cover of \"Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage?\" by techno artist Blawan, which furthered their reputation and expanded their fan base, setting them up for a handful of UK tour dates throughout April 2013. === Rough Trade === Throughout 2014 Girl Band released a number of limited 7\" singles on Any Other City records. In December 2014 they signed to Rough Trade Records. The record deal came about after the founder of the label, Geoff Travis saw them perform numerous times, and he wanted to \"facilitate what [the band was] doing [at the time] on a bigger scale\". Girl Band were given full creative control and allowed produced their own records. Girl Band released their debut album Holding Hands With Jamie on Rough Trade in September 2015. Self-produced, it was recorded at Bow Lane Studios in Dublin. ===The Talkies === In June 2019, Girl Band released \"Shoulderblades\", their first single in four years. A second single titled \"Going Norway\" followed in August 2019. These songs are the singles for the band's second album The Talkies, which was released by Rough Trade on 27 September. == Style == The band's debut album was well received by music critics. Pitchfork said that \"Dara Kiely brings heavy vibes and great songs to Girl Band's new album. Should you laugh? Holding Hands With Jamie is as discomfiting as Kiely\u2019s mental state\". The Guardian described the band as \"full of sound and fury\" and stated \"This Irish four-piece howls at you from the very start, an unbroken series of thumping, crashing songs strewn with fractured, imagistic lyrics\". Rolling Stone wrote than about Dara Kiely's vocal performance stating, \"[Dara Kiely] sure sounds convincing. But he doesn't seem too shy about it, either \u2013 less like someone cowering embarrassedly in his room than a guy who's turned his fish-belly skin and concave abs into a creepy point of pride. That kind of confrontational, matter-of-fact ugliness is what this Irish post-punk crew does so well, torturing their instruments with dead-eyed precision and diabolical resolve. The dank, relentless music sounds like it was recorded in a meat locker under a fallout shelter\". Rolling Stone also compared the band to Liars and Nick Cave's Birthday Party. === Influences === Drummer Adam Faulkner has said that \"most of the bands we get compared to we don\u2019t really listen to. For ages, for like a whole year, we got compared to Mclusky, and none of us ever listened to it. And then we all did and were just like, Nah, don\u2019t like it.\" The band mentions influences ranging from bands such as Bad Brains, James Chance and the Contortions, Neu!, and The Chemical Brothers. == Band members == * Dara Kiely \u2013 vocals * Alan Duggan \u2013 guitar * Daniel Fox \u2013 bass guitar * Adam Faulkner \u2013 drums == Discography == ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ List of studio albums, with selected information ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3.5em;font-size:90%;\"| IRE ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3.5em;font-size:90%;\"| UK |- ! scope=\"row\"| Holding Hands with Jamie | * Released: 30 September 2015 * Label: Rough Trade * Formats: CD, LP | 11 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| The Talkies | * Released: 27 September 2019 * Label: Rough Trade * Formats: CD, LP | 11 || 73 |} ===EPs=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ List of extended plays, with selected information !Title !EP details |- |France 98 | * Released: October 11, 2012 * Label: Any Other City * Formats: 12-inch, digital download |- |The Early Years | * Released: April 21, 2015 * Label: Rough Trade * Formats: 12-inch, digital download, CD |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+List of singles, with selected information !Title !Year !Album |- |\"In My Head\" |2012 | |- |\"The Cha Cha Cha\" | rowspan=\"3\" |2014 | rowspan=\"3\" |The Early Years |- |\"Lawman\" |- |\"De Bom Bom\" |- |\"Pears for Lunch\" | rowspan=\"2\" |2015 | rowspan=\"3\" |Holding Hands With Jamie |- |\"Paul\" |- |\"In Plastic\" |2016 |- |\"Shoulderblades\" | rowspan=\"3\" |2019 | rowspan=\"3\" |The Talkies |- |\"Going Norway\" |- |\"Salmon of Knowledge\" |} Music videos {| class=\"wikitable\" !Title !Year !Director(s) |- |\"Lawman\" | rowspan=\"2\" |2014 | rowspan=\"2\" |Second/Frame |- |\"De Bom Bom\" |- |\"Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage?\" | rowspan=\"4\" |2015 | rowspan=\"6\" |Bob Gallagher |- |\"Paul\" |- |\"Pears for Lunch\" |- |\"In Plastic\" |- |\"Shoulderblades\" | rowspan=\"2\" |2019 |- |\"Going Norway\" |} Other appearances {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Song !Album !Comments |- |2013 |\"Why They Hide Their Bodies Under My Garage?\" |Quompilation #3 |Cover of a 2012 Blawan song.
