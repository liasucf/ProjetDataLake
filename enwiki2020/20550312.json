Allmusic Review accessed September 17, 2011 == Applause == The Carnegie Hall Concert contains applause, audience noise and Jarrett's interactions with fans totalling approximately 20 minutes of extra-musical time between tracks. Richard Lehnert (October 2006 Keith Jarrett: Tokyo Solo & The Carnegie Hall Concert accessed May 2020 \"As on many of Jarrett's live discs, producer Manfred Eicher allows the audience's long and thunderous period of applause to overwhelm the end of many tracks\" says reviewer Will Layman at Popmatters Will Layman (October 2006) Keith Jarrett: The Carnegie Hall Concert accessed May 2020 and \"folks tend to be divided about whether this is indulgence (Jarrett's, the arrogant artist) or psychology (Eicher's manipulation -- you are there) or simply padding out the CD's length.\" Reviewer John Kelman at All About Jazz notes that \"Curious, however, is the applause between tracks\u2014in some cases nearly three minutes long, adding up to nearly nineteen minutes in total. Exciting as it may have been to be there, the lengthy audience noise does nothing but defeat the recorded program's continuity.\" John Kelman (September 2006 Keith Jarrett: The Carnegie Hall Concert accessed May 2020 Thomas Conrad at JazzTimes has his word stating that \"This is a valuable addition to a distinguished body of recorded work. One complaint: With its five encores, the second CD contains more than 17 minutes of applause and 59 minutes of music. This ratio will test the patience of even the most worshipful Jarrett fans in search of a vicarious solo concert experience.\" Thomas Conrad (October 2006 Keith Jarrett: The Carnegie Hall Concert accessed May 2020 ==Track listing== :All compositions by Keith Jarrett except as indicated. # \"Part I\" - 9:56 # \"Part II\" - 3:32 # \"Part III\" - 4:44 # \"Part IV\" - 5:19 # \"Part V\" - 9:54 # \"Part VI\" - 6:50 # \"Part VII\" - 8:35 # \"Part VIII\" - 5:19 # \"Part IX\" - 8:25 # \"Part X\" - 9:46 # Encore: \"The Good America\" - 6:47 # Encore: \"Paint My Heart Red\" - 8:30 # Encore: \"My Song\" - 8:04 # Encore: \"True Blues\" - 7:00 # Encore: \"Time on My Hands\" (Adamson, Gordon, Youmans) - 7:30 Total effective playing time: 1:30:02 (the album contains 20:21 applause approximately) ==Personnel== * Keith Jarrett \u2013 piano, Recording Producer == Technical Personnel == * Martin Pearson - Recording Engineer * Richard Termine - Photography (concert) * Sascha Kleis - Design * Manfred Eicher - Executive producer == References == Category:ECM Records albums Category:Keith Jarrett live albums Category:2006 live albums Category:Albums produced by Manfred Eicher Category:Albums recorded at Carnegie Hall Category:Instrumental albums Category:Solo piano jazz albums ",
