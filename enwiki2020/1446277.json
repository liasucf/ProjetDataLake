    "text": "In mathematics, especially functional analysis, Bessel's inequality is a statement about the coefficients of an element x in a Hilbert space with respect to an orthonormal sequence. The inequality was derived by F.W. Bessel in 1828.https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Bessel_inequality Let H be a Hilbert space, and suppose that e_1, e_2, ... is an orthonormal sequence in H. Then, for any x in H one has :\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\left\\vert\\left\\langle x,e_k\\right\\rangle \\right\\vert^2 \\le \\left\\Vert x\\right\\Vert^2, where \u27e8\u00b7,\u00b7\u27e9 denotes the inner product in the Hilbert space H. If we define the infinite sum :x' = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\left\\langle x,e_k\\right\\rangle e_k, consisting of \"infinite sum\" of vector resolute x in direction e_k, Bessel's inequality tells us that this series converges. One can think of it that there exists x' \\in H that can be described in terms of potential basis e_1, e_2, \\dots. For a complete orthonormal sequence (that is, for an orthonormal sequence that is a basis), we have Parseval's identity, which replaces the inequality with an equality (and consequently x' with x). Bessel's inequality follows from the identity :\\begin{align} 0 \\leq \\left\\| x - \\sum_{k=1}^n \\langle x, e_k \\rangle e_k\\right\\|^2 &= \\|x\\|^2 - 2 \\sum_{k=1}^n \\operatorname{Re} \\langle x, \\langle x, e_k \\rangle e_k \\rangle + \\sum_{k=1}^n | \\langle x, e_k \\rangle |^2 \\\\\\ &= \\|x\\|^2 - 2 \\sum_{k=1}^n |\\langle x, e_k \\rangle |^2 + \\sum_{k=1}^n | \\langle x, e_k \\rangle |^2 \\\\\\ &= \\|x\\|^2 - \\sum_{k=1}^n | \\langle x, e_k \\rangle |^2, \\end{align} which holds for any natural n. ==See also== * Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality * Parseval's theorem == Notes == == External links == * * Bessel's Inequality the article on Bessel's Inequality on MathWorld.
