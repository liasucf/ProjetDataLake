    "text": "In mathematics, P\u00e9pin's test is a primality test, which can be used to determine whether a Fermat number is prime. It is a variant of Proth's test. The test is named for a French mathematician, Th\u00e9ophile P\u00e9pin. ==Description of the test== Let F_n=2^{2^n}+1 be the nth Fermat number. P\u00e9pin's test states that for n > 0, :F_n is prime if and only if 3^{(F_n-1)/2}\\equiv-1\\pmod{F_n}. The expression 3^{(F_n-1)/2} can be evaluated modulo F_n by repeated squaring. This makes the test a fast polynomial-time algorithm. However, Fermat numbers grow so rapidly that only a handful of Fermat numbers can be tested in a reasonable amount of time and space. Other bases may be used in place of 3, these bases are :3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 20, 24, 27, 28, 39, 40, 41, 45, 48, 51, 54, 56, 63, 65, 75, 78, 80, 82, 85, 90, 91, 96, 102, 105, 108, 112, 119, 125, 126, 130, 147, 150, 156, 160, ... . The primes in the above sequence are called Elite primes, they are :3, 5, 7, 41, 15361, 23041, 26881, 61441, 87041, 163841, 544001, 604801, 6684673, 14172161, 159318017, 446960641, 1151139841, 3208642561, 38126223361, 108905103361, 171727482881, 318093312001, 443069456129, 912680550401, ... For integer b > 1, base b may be used if and only if only a finite number of Fermat numbers Fn satisfies that \\left(\\frac{b}{F_n}\\right)=1, where \\left(\\frac{b}{F_n}\\right) is the Jacobi symbol. In fact, P\u00e9pin's test is the same as the Euler-Jacobi test for Fermat numbers, since the Jacobi symbol \\left(\\frac{b}{F_n}\\right) is \u22121, i.e. there are no Fermat numbers which are Euler-Jacobi pseudoprimes to these bases listed above. ==Proof of correctness== Sufficiency: assume that the congruence :3^{(F_n-1)/2}\\equiv-1\\pmod{F_n} holds. Then 3^{F_n-1}\\equiv1\\pmod{F_n}, thus the multiplicative order of 3 modulo F_n divides F_n-1=2^{2^n}, which is a power of two. On the other hand, the order does not divide (F_n-1)/2, and therefore it must be equal to F_n-1. In particular, there are at least F_n-1 numbers below F_n coprime to F_n, and this can happen only if F_n is prime. Necessity: assume that F_n is prime. By Euler's criterion, :3^{(F_n-1)/2}\\equiv\\left(\\frac3{F_n}\\right)\\pmod{F_n}, where \\left(\\frac3{F_n}\\right) is the Legendre symbol. By repeated squaring, we find that 2^{2^n}\\equiv1\\pmod3, thus F_n\\equiv2\\pmod3, and \\left(\\frac{F_n}3\\right)=-1. As F_n\\equiv1\\pmod4, we conclude \\left(\\frac3{F_n}\\right)=-1 from the law of quadratic reciprocity. == Historical P\u00e9pin tests == Because of the sparsity of the Fermat numbers, the P\u00e9pin test has only been run eight times (on Fermat numbers whose primality statuses were not already known).Conjecture 4. Fermat primes are finite - Pepin tests story, according to Leonid DurmanWilfrid Keller: Fermat factoring statusR. M. Robinson (1954): Mersenne and Fermat numbers Mayer, Papadopoulos and Crandall speculate that in fact, because of the size of the still undetermined Fermat numbers, it will take considerable advances in technology before any more P\u00e9pin tests can be run in a reasonable amount of time.Richard E. Crandall, Ernst W. Mayer & Jason S. Papadopoulos, The twenty-fourth Fermat number is composite (2003) the smallest untested Fermat number with no known prime factor is F_{33} which has 2,585,827,973 digits. {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- !
