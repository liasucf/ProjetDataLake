Cottle reputedly responded by commissioning a powerful love charm, the spancel of death (). The spancel has been described as \"an unbroken hoop of skin cut with incantations from a corpse across the entire body from shoulder to footsole and wrapped in silk of the colours of the rainbow and used as a spancel to tie the legs of a person to produce certain effects of witchcraft.\"MacLochlainn, Alf, \"Father Dinneen and His Dictionary\", An Irish Quarterly Review, Vol. 91, No. 361 (Spring, 2002), page 74 According to Nally, the love charm was made by Judy Holian, an bhean feasa (a woman of knowledge and wisdom), from the corpse of Harry's illegitimate daughter by another woman. Holian, reputedly a local witch, guaranteed that Sir Harry would be spellbound for life should Cottle apply the spancel to him.McNulty, Paul B, Spellbound by Sibella, 2013, Club Lighthouse CLP, http://www.clublighthousepublishing.com/productpage.asp?bNumb=342, Edmonton, Alberta, 2013, https://www.amazon.co.uk/Spellbound-Sibella-Paul-B- McNulty/dp/1492195219/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1402997700&sr;=1-3&keywords;=paul+b+mcnulty. ==References== Category:18th-century Irish people Category:18th-century Irish women Category:People from County Mayo ",
