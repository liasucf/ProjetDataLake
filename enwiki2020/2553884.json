    "text": "Johann Kirnberger Johann Philipp Kirnberger (also Kernberg; 24 April 1721, Saalfeld \u2013 27 July 1783, Berlin) was a musician, composer (primarily of fugues), and music theorist. He was a student of Johann Sebastian Bach.Applegate, Celia, Bach and Berlin: Nation and Cullture in Mendelssohn's Revival of the St. Matthew Passion, Cornell University Press, Ithaca and London, 2005, p. 15 According to Ingeborg Allihn, Kirnberger played a significant role in the intellectual and cultural exchange between Germany and Poland in the mid-18th century (Allihn 1995, 209). Between 1741 and 1751 Kirnberger lived and worked in Poland for powerful magnates including Lubomirski, Poninski, and Rzewuski before ending up at the Benedictine Cloister in Lviv (then part of Poland). He spent much time collecting Polish national dances and compiled them in his treatise Die Charaktere der Taenze (Allihn 1995, 211). Kirnberger became a violinist at the court of Frederick II of Prussia in 1751. He was the music director to the Prussian Princess Anna Amalia from 1758 until his death. Kirnberger greatly admired Johann Sebastian Bach, deeming him \"the greatest of all composers.\" Kirnberger published Bach's Clavier\u00fcbungen mit der bachischen Applicatur in the 1760s, and seeking to secure the publication of all of Bach's chorale settings, which finally appeared after Kirnberger's death; see Kirnberger chorale preludes (BWV 690\u2013713). Many of Bach's manuscripts have been preserved in Kirnberger's library (the \"Kirnberger collection\"). Kirnberger is known today primarily for his theoretical work Die Kunst des reinen Satzes in der Musik (The Art of Strict Composition in Music, 1774, 1779). The well-tempered tuning systems known as \"Kirnberger II\" and \"Kirnberger III\" are associated with his name (see Kirnberger temperament), as is a rational version of equal temperament (see schisma). One of his most familiar compositions is Fuga in C-dur f\u00fcr Orgel (\"Fanfare\" Fugue), which was formerly attributed to Johann Sebastian Bach and then to his son Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. ==References== ==External links== * More information, including full text, of Kirnberger's Grunds\u00e4tze des Generalbasses (178?) in the University of North Texas Music Library Virtual Rare Book Room * * Larry Schou: The Kirnberger Chorales, The University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance * https://www.academia.edu/5210832/18th_Century_Quotes_on_J.S._Bach_s_Temperament Category:1721 births Category:1783 deaths Category:People from Saalfeld Category:German classical composers Category:German male classical composers Category:German male composers Category:Classical-period composers Category:German music theorists Category:Pupils of Johann Sebastian Bach Category:18th-century classical composers Category:18th-century male musicians ",
