K. Wagner and the senior Maurice Timothy Dooling, an attorney who would later become a United States federal judge, appointed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by President Woodrow Wilson.Marjorie Pierce, East of the Gabilans: The Ranches, the Towns, the People\u2014Yesterday and Today (1981), p. 91. Dooling Jr. graduated from San Benito County High School. He entered the University of Santa Clara at the age of 16, graduating in 1909 with a B.A. and named as both the class treasurer and poet.In Memoriam. 63 Cal. 2d 833 (1966). He received a second B.A. from Stanford University in 1911, and a J.D. from the Stanford Law School in 1913, where he was one of the top students. ==Legal and judicial career== The Stanford Dean recommended that San Francisco city attorney George Lull hire Dooling, who then worked at the city attorney's office into the 1920s. In 1921, he successfully represented the city before the Supreme Court of the United States in a case concerning the city's power to remove an unpermitted house built in the 1906 fire zone.Maguire v. Reardon, 255 U.S. 271 (1921)(Messrs. Maurice T. Dooling Jr. and George Lull, both of San Francisco, Cal., for defendants in error). After leaving the city attorney, he began a private practice. In 1928, Governor C. C. Young appointed Dooling as a superior court judge of San Benito County, a position his father had held. In December 1937, he upheld a union's right to picket in front of a business. In June 1940, after the outbreak of World War II, Governor Culbert Olson appointed Dooling as San Benito county chairman of recruiting for the armed forces, should America join the conflict. In 1945, Dooling was named an Associate Justice in the California Court of Appeal, First District, by Governor Earl Warren. In June 1960, Governor Pat Brown appointed Dooling as Associate Justice to the California Supreme Court, to fill the vacancy from the resignation of Homer R. Spence. Among the notable cases Dooling voted on is the pair in 1961 arising out of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California lawsuits against the Boards of Education of both the cities of Los Angeles and San Diego.American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California v. Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles (1961), 59 Cal. 2d 207 (opinion Peters, J.)American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California v.

On October 18, 1965, he died in San Francisco. ==Personal life== In 1916, he married Mary Devlin, the daughter of a family friend, who was active in Democratic politics.
