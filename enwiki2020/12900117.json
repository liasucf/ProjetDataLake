The cathedral was built in 1966 and designed by the architect Charles-Gustave Stoskopf. It is the seat of the Bishopric of Cr\u00e9teil. ==Present building== The present cathedral was formerly a parish church opened on 18 June 1976 which became the cathedral in 1987. Modest, as was the wish of the ecclesiastical authorities of the period, it is located between the district of Montaigut and the Universit\u00e9 Paris XII Val-de- Marne. Before the consecration of the present building, the cathedral of the diocese was the church of Saint Louis and Saint Nicholas at Choisy-le-Roi. ==Proposed building== On 19 and 20 June 2010 a project was announced ( the Projet Cr\u00e9teil Cath\u00e9drale+) to bring about the transformation of the present modest cathedral building into a more welcoming, more luminous and more visible symbol of the presence of the Church in Val-de-Marne. The permission of the Holy See having been obtained, the project is under way, and the estimated end of the building works is September 2013. ==Sources and external links== * * Catholic Hierarchy: Diocese of Cr\u00e9teil * Website of Projet Cr\u00e9teilCath\u00e9drale+ Category:Roman Catholic cathedrals in France Category:Churches in Val-de-Marne ",
