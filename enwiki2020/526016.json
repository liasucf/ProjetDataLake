    "text": "The University of Cincinnati (UC or Cincinnati) is a public research university in Cincinnati, Ohio. Founded in 1819 as Cincinnati College, it is the oldest institution of higher education in Cincinnati and has an annual enrollment of over 44,000 students, making it the second largest university in Ohio. It is part of the University System of Ohio, with four major campuses. Cincinnati's main campus and medical campus are located in Clifton Heights, while its branch campuses are in Blue Ash and Clermont. ==History== Second home of the University of Cincinnati, 1874 ===Early history=== In 1819, Cincinnati College and the Medical College of Ohio were founded in Cincinnati. Local benefactor Dr. Daniel Drake founded and funded the Medical College of Ohio. William Lytle of the Lytle family donated the land, funded the Cincinnati College and Law College, and served as its first president. The college survived only six years before financial difficulties forced it to close. In 1835, Daniel Drake reestablished the institution, which eventually joined with the Cincinnati Law School. In 1858, Charles McMicken died of pneumonia and in his will he allocated most of his estate to the City of Cincinnati to found a university. The University of Cincinnati was chartered by the Ohio legislature in 1870 after delays by livestock and veal lobbyists angered by the liberal arts-centered curriculum and lack of agricultural and manufacturing emphasis. The university's board of rectors changed the institution's name to the University of Cincinnati. ===Expansion=== University of Cincinnati, Ohio, ca. 1904 By 1893, the university expanded beyond its primary location on Clifton Avenue and relocated to its present location in the Heights neighborhood. As the university expanded, the rectors merged the institution with Cincinnati Law School, establishing the University of Cincinnati College of Law. In 1896, the Ohio Medical College joined Miami Medical College to form the Ohio-Miami Medical Department of the University of Cincinnati in 1909. As political movements for temperance and suffrage grew, the university established Teacher's College in 1905 and a Graduate School in the College of Arts and Sciences in 1906. The Queen City College of Pharmacy, acquired from Wilmington College (Ohio), became the present James L. Winkle College of Pharmacy. ===Public liberal arts university=== In 1962, the Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music was acquired by the university. The Ohio legislature in Columbus declared the university a \"municipally-sponsored, state-affiliated\" institution in 1968. During this time, the University of Cincinnati was the second oldest and second-largest municipal university in the United States. By an act of the legislature, the University of Cincinnati became a state institution in 1977. ===Campus Master Plan and UC21=== MainStreet, looking past the Steger Student Life Center towards the student union and McMicken Hall In 1989, President Joseph A. Steger released a Master Plan for a stronger academy. Over this time, the university invested nearly $2 billion in campus construction, renovation, and expansion ranging from the student union to a new recreation center to the medical school. It included renovation and construction of multiple buildings, a campus forest, and a university promenade. The plan also includes the Sigma Sigma Commons, which was completed in 1998 as a part of the organization's centennial. Upon her inauguration in 2005, President Nancy L. Zimpher developed the UC21 plan, designed to redefine Cincinnati as a leading urban research university. In addition, it includes putting liberal arts education at the center, increasing research funding, and expanding involvement in the city. In 2009, Gregory H. Williams was named the 27th president of the University of Cincinnati. His presidency expanded the accreditation and property of the institution to regions throughout Ohio to compete with private and specialized state institutions, such as Ohio State University. His administration focused on maintaining the integrity and holdings of the university. He focused on the academic master plan for the university, placing the academic programs of UC at the core of the strategic plan. The university invested in scholarships, funding for study abroad experiences, the university's advising program as it worked to reaffirm its history and academy for the future. Neville Pinto is the current and 30th president of the university. === 2010 student death === In 2010, Kelly Brinson died after being tased by University of Cincinnati police officers at the university's hospital.Three Other Black Men Have Died In Altercations With University Of Cincinnati Police by Salvador Hernandez; BuzzFeed. July 30, 2015. Five years later, Sam DuBose was shot and killed by University Police Officer Raymond Tensing.Recent Event: University Police Officer Shoots and Kills Non-University-Affiliated Motorist During Off-Campus Traffic Stop , 129 Harv. L. Rev. 1168 (2016). DuBose had been stopped near the intersection of Vine and Thill Street for driving without a front license plate. Body camera footage contradicted Officer Tensing's account of the incident. Officer Tensing was indicted for murder and the university reached a settlement of over $5 million with the Dubose family although Judge Leslie Ghiz declared a second mistrial on the case. ==Campuses== ===Uptown campus=== The Uptown campus includes the West, Medical, and Victory Parkway campuses. Entrance to main campus at UC ==== West Campus ==== This is the main campus and includes 62 buildings on . The university moved to this location in 1893. Most of the undergraduate colleges at the university are located on main campus. The exceptions are part of the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center on the Medical campus. In spring of 2010 the University of Cincinnati was honored by being one of only 13 colleges and universities named by Forbes as one of \"The World's Most Beautiful College Campuses\". ==== Medical Campus ==== This campus contains nineteen buildings on . It is catty corner to West campus on Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. The undergraduate colleges of Allied Health Sciences and Nursing and graduate colleges of Medicine and the James L. Winkle College of Pharmacy are located there. The hospitals located there include University of Cincinnati Medical Center, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati VA Medical Center, and the Shriners Hospital for Children. ==== Victory Parkway Campus ==== This campus was formally home to the College of Applied Science. It is roughly from main campus in the Walnut Hills neighborhood of Cincinnati and overlooks the Ohio River. When it merged with the College of Engineering to become the College of Engineering and Applied Science many of the classes were moved to main campus, however limited courses are still taught there. There is a shuttle that runs between this and main campus throughout the day. ===Regional campuses=== * Blue Ash College (UCBA) (regional campus, located in Blue Ash, Ohio). Formerly known as Raymond Walters College. * Clermont College (CLER) (regional campus, located in Batavia, Ohio); includes UC East (located in a renovated Ford plant in Batavia, OH, this facility serves as expansion space for Clermont College and select programs in the College of Nursing and the College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Services, as well as the BTAS in Applied Administration program.) === UC Online === UC Online offers over 80 graduate, undergraduate and certificate programs through an online platform. Each program is delivered 100% online and holds the same accreditation and academic excellence as the university's on campus programs. ===Off-campus facilities=== *Center Hill Research Facility *UC Reading Campus & UC Metabolic Diseases Institute *Cincinnati Center for Field Studies *Cincinnati Observatory (university owns the facility and the nonprofit Cincinnati Observatory Center operates it) *1819 Building ===Architecture=== The Tangeman University Center, designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects, houses several food courts and other student amenities. Vontz Center for Molecular Studies, designed by Frank Gehry in conjunction with BHDP Architecture, is part of the medical campus. The Engineering Research Center, designed by UC Alumnus Michael Graves, was designed to look like a 4-cylinder engine. The university has had a strategic plan for the last decade for new architecture to be built by \"signature architects.\" In recent years, the university has received attention from architects and campus planners as one of the most beautiful in the world. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Building !Architect !Year |- |Engineering Research Center |Michael Graves |1994 |- |Aronoff Center for Art and Design |Peter Eisenman |1996 |- |College-Conservatory of Music |Pei Cobb Freed and Partners (Henry Cobb) |1999 |- |Vontz Center for Molecular Studies |Frank O.

The university has received this distinction each year since. UC was the only public university in Ohio and the only university in the Southern Ohio region included on this list. Some of the programs that helped achieve this distinction include: a bike share program where UC students can rent bikes from the university, an expanded recycling program, improved and expanded campus transportation options, the addition of vehicle charging stations, fuel pellet use in place of coal, greatly decreased energy and water use throughout campus, and the addition of 6 Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified buildings since 2005. In 2007, former university president Nancy Zimpher signed the American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment, which confirms the university's dedication to reducing its environmental impact and take the necessary steps to become climate neutral. In 2010, UC opened up a privately funded athletic practice facility and women's lacrosse stadium named Sheakley Athletic Complex. As a continued effort to go green, a chilled water thermal energy storage tank was placed under the fields and at night water is chilled and then used to air-condition buildings on campus. The storage tank helps the university reach annual energy savings of about $1 million. In the fall of 2010, the university began placing \"All Recycling\" containers throughout campus. This expansion of recycling efforts and receptacles provides a greater opportunity for students, staff, and visitors to participate in recycling a broader range of materials. In 2010, UC recycled just over 4,600 tons of material, which was a 23 percent increase over the previous year. The student group Environmental Students for Activism Volunteering and Education, or E-SAVE, launched the first environmental sustainability campus campaign in 2000\u20132002. In a meeting with then President Joe Stegler, students secured a commitment to create an presidents committee environmental sustainability. ==Professional Practice Program== The University of Cincinnati is the originator of the co-operative education (Co-Op) model. The concept was invented at UC in 1906 by Herman Schneider, Dean of the College of Engineering at the time. The program generally consists of alternating semesters of coursework on campus and outside work at a host firm, giving students over one year of relevant work experience by the time they graduate. All programs in the College of Engineering and Applied Science, Architecture programs, all design programs in the College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning, and Information Technology in the College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Services, require co-operative education experience to graduate. ==Academic profile== ===Rankings=== In the 2021 U.S. News & World Report rankings, UC was listed as the 196th best global university, tied for 143rd ranked U.S. national university, and tied for 65th best public university (U.S.). ===Colleges and schools=== The university has some 14 colleges and schools: * The College of Allied Health Sciences (CAHS). The School of Social Work is within the college. * The University of Cincinnati College of Arts and Sciences (A&S;), the largest college, has 21 departments, eight co-op programs, and several interdisciplinary programs. * The Carl H. Lindner College of Business (LCB) is the university's business school. * The College-Conservatory of Music (CCM) is the university's performing arts school. * The College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning (DAAP). * College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Services (CECH) * The College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS). The College of Applied Science (CAS) and the College of Engineering merged to form this new college in 2009. Winston Koch invented the first electronic organ at the College of Engineering. The CAS was initially organized as the Ohio Mechanics Institute (OMI) in 1828; it merged with UC in 1969 and was renamed the OMI College of Applied Science in 1979. * The Graduate School, a collaborative unit of all the university's colleges responsible for providing centralized administrative services for all postgraduate programs. * The College of Law is the university's law school; it is the alma mater of William Howard Taft, who also served as the college's dean when it integrated with the University of Cincinnati in 1896. A statue of the former president stands near the campus law building. * The College of Medicine is the university's medical school; it includes a leading teaching hospital and several biomedical research laboratories. In the 1950s Albert Sabin developed the live polio vaccine at the College of Medicine. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) was developed here by George Rieveschl in 1946. UC also established the first emergency medicine residency program. In 2008, it became the first medical college in the country to implement the multiple mini interview system for its admission process. * The College of Nursing was founded in 1889. * The James L. Winkle College of Pharmacy was founded in 1850. The university has two regional campuses: Clermont College (CLER) and Blue Ash College (UCBA) in Blue Ash, Ohio. UC is also the home of the Institute for Policy Research, a multidisciplinary research organization which opened in 1971. The center performs a variety of surveys and polls on public opinion throughout Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana, primarily through telephone surveys. ===University Honors Program=== Each year UC welcomes roughly 375 students, or usually the top 5%-8% of students, to the University Honors Program. Students admitted into the Honors program typically meet the following qualifications: an ACT composite score of 32 or higher, an SAT score of 1400 or higher (critical reading and math combined), and either an unweighted high school GPA of 3.6 or a weighted high school GPA of 3.8. The program is centered around students taking part in \"experiences.\" Experiences are defined as \"fall[ing] within one of five competencies: community engagement, creativity, global studies, leadership, and research.\" Experiences could take the form of Honors Seminars, which are certain three credit-hour courses, Pre-Approved Experiences, which consist of programs the Honors Program has already deemed to meet the requirements of an experience, and Self-Designed Experiences, where students design their own experience plan to submit to the Honors Program for approval. Students are required to complete at least five experiences before graduation. ==Research== The university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\". According to the National Science Foundation, UC spent $480 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 54th in the nation. ===Ohio Centers of Excellence=== University of Cincinnati Solar Decathlon House, 2007 The Ohio Centers of Excellence were designed to recognize the extensive research at universities in Ohio and encourage the development of new technologies and techniques to help retain and create Ohio jobs. Most recently the College-Conservatory of Music was honored for its excellence in Cultural & Societal Transformation and is the only performing arts program in Ohio to earn the designation: * Advanced Energy: Sustaining the Urban Environment * Advanced Transportation and Aerospace: Intelligent Air & Space Vehicle Energy Systems * Biomedicine and Health Care: Transforming Health Care in the 21st Century * Cultural & Societal Transformation: Music and Theater Arts * Cultural & Societal Transformation: Center for Design and Innovation * Enabling Technologies: Materials and Sensors, Nanoscale Sensor Technology ===Off-campus research facilities=== *Center Hill Research Facility *UC Reading Campus & UC Metabolic Diseases Institute *Cincinnati Center for Field Studies *Cincinnati Observatory (university owns the facility and the nonprofit Cincinnati Observatory Center operates it) ===Discoveries=== Several discoveries, inventions, accomplishments, and \"firsts\" have taken place at the University of Cincinnati. {| |- |valign=\"top\"| *First co-operative education program \u2013 Herman Schneider (while Dean of the College of Engineering) *First oral polio vaccine \u2013 Albert Sabin (as a researcher at the College of Medicine, and also an alum) *First observations leading to the National Weather Service \u2013 Cleveland Abbe (as director of the Cincinnati Observatory in the 1860s) *First antihistamine (Benadryl) \u2013 George Rieveschl (as a researcher at the College of Medicine) *First electronic organ \u2013 Winston Kock (as a student in the College of Engineering as his electrical engineering undergraduate thesis) *First heart-lung machine \u2013 UC cardiologist Samuel Kaplan, chemist Leland Clark and surgery professor James Helmsworth *First use of YAG laser to remove brain tumor *First bachelor's degree program in nursing *First emergency medicine residency program *First degree program offered via satellite |} ===Libraries=== Walter C.

The center serves as a resource for all the university's undergraduate colleges and programs. This collaboration between UC colleges, academic programs, and student groups allow freshman to continue the transition from high school to college. The program is designed to help freshmen and their faculty to develop relationships that will continue and grow throughout their time at the University of Cincinnati. ===Learning communities=== Many students at the University of Cincinnati have the opportunity to participate in learning communities. These are diverse groups of students and faculty in which 20\u201325 students have at least two classes together throughout their first year on campus. Students have the opportunity to join these based on their major or area of study. There are nearly 120 learning communities to choose from. They are offered in the following colleges: College of Allied Health Sciences, College of Business, College of Education, Criminal Justice, and Human Services, College of Engineering & Applied Sciences, College of Nursing, and the College of Arts & Sciences. A few majors require freshmen to be in these learning communities. Many of these groups have specialized courses taught by their academic advisor. Students and Cincinnati residents gather for the American Cancer Society's Relay For Life event. ===Transition and Access Program=== The Transition and Access Program, which does not lead to a degree, allows certain disabled adults to take classes, interact with other students, and intern at companies.

Campus Green, which is green and activity space for students at UC. To the left is the Lindner College of Business, and to the right are residence halls. ===Fraternity and sorority life=== Fraternities and sororities have been a part of the university since 1840. There are over 2,500 students participating in fraternities and sororities, which represents approximately 11% of the undergraduate population (Uptown Campus). 52 chapters have called UC home over the years, and currently includes 39 social fraternities and sororities: 21 Interfraternity Council fraternities, nine Panhellenic Council sororities, seven National Pan-Hellenic Council (three fraternities and four sororities), and two non-affiliated (Delta Phi Lambda and Phi Sigma Rho organizations.) ===Student media=== There are several media outlets for university students. The student newspaper, The News Record, has been in production for more than 130 years, taking its current name in 1936. It is an independent, student-run newspaper and not attached to any academic program and therefore any student, regardless of program, is able to apply and work for the newspaper. A student-run radio station named Bearcast is housed in the College-Conservatory of Music on campus. The programming streams online as opposed to a traditional radio station and, like the News Record, is open to any student attending the university. There is also a television station called UCast. === Film festival === The 48-hour film festival is held each year for the general public to attend. Notable speakers and filmmakers are known to kick off the event including Fraser Kershaw, as well as guest speakers and artists from Kenyatta University in Nairobi, Kenya. Actors, directors, editors, and composers are showcased at the MainStreet Cinema for students and professionals. ===Housing=== Campus Recreation Center Housing, designed by Thom Mayne, opened in 2006. 6,500 students live on campus in ten residence halls that offer both traditional and suite style options. Students also have the option to live in themed housing, which include honors, business, and STEM-specific floors. In the fall of 2012, Campus Recreation Center Housing (CRC) was named on The Fiscal Times list of \"10 Public Colleges with Insanely Luxurious Dorms\". Nearly 80% of Uptown Campus incoming freshman students live on campus their first year. In recent years, record freshman classes and increased interest by upperclass students has led to higher demand than supply for on-campus residence halls. To meet this demand, UC Housing and Food Services has added residence halls (Morgens Hall in 2013) and purchased block leases at University Park Apartments, Campus Park Apartments (formerly Sterling Manor), University Edge Apartments, and Stetson Square Apartments near campus. This has pushed the \"on-campus\" housing student population higher. The university announced that Scioto Hall will undergo a renovation and open in the fall of 2016. There are also plans for a new residence hall and dining center where Sawyer Hall once stood. UC Housing & Food Services manages ten undergraduate residence halls: * Calhoun Hall * Campus Recreation Center Housing (CRC is only available to students who are sophomores or older) * Dabney Hall * Daniels Hall * Siddall Hall * Jefferson Complex ** Consists of Schneider Hall and Turner Hall (JCSH, JSTH). * Stratford Heights (as of summer 2009) * Morgens Hall * Scioto Hall * Marion Spencer Hall The university also offers limited housing to graduate students. Bellevue Gardens is an apartment community owned and operated by the university. It is located close to the Academic Health Center (AHC) and medical campus. Two off-campus university- affiliated (but not university-managed) housing options were introduced in 2005: Stratford Heights and University Park Apartments. All leases in the Stratford Heights housing area have been terminated, and control of the housing complex reverted to University control as a residence hall in the summer of 2009. ==Notable alumni and faculty members== == References == ==External links== * *Cincinnati Athletics website *FBI files on the University of Cincinnati, hosted at the Internet Archive: **Part 1 **Part 2 Category:American Athletic Conference schools Category:Educational institutions established in 1819 Category:Greater Cincinnati Consortium of Colleges and Universities Category:Universities and colleges in Cincinnati Category:Urban 13 universities Category:1819 establishments in Ohio ",
