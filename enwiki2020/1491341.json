    "text": "The International Patent Institute (or IIB standing for Institut International des Brevets, its French name) was an intellectual property organisation established on June 6, 1947 in The Hague, Netherlands, by a set of European countries, France, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. It was integrated into the European Patent Organisation on January 1, 1978. Its purpose was to centralize patent searching and archiving as well as the resources needed for the prior art searches for its member countries.Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD), Patents, innovation and economic performance: OECD conference proceedings, 2004, page 28. The integration of the International Patent Institute into the European Patent Organisation led in practice to the creation of the branch of the European Patent Office (EPO) at Rijswijk in The Netherlands (a suburb of The Hague). This branch still exists and is one of three locations of the EPO (along with Munich and Berlin) where European patent applications may be filed. == See also == * Intellectual property organization * Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) * Strasbourg Convention (1963) * World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) * United International Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property (BIRPI) == References == Category:European patent law Category:Intellectual property organizations Category:Organizations established in 1947 Category:Former international organizations Category:Organizations disestablished in 1978 Category:1947 establishments in the Netherlands ",
