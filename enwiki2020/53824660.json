The building of the line was supported by the European Union, who have since launched an OLAF investigation into the funding. ==Controversy== Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Prime Minister of Hungary has been accused of misusing \u20ac2M of EU money contributed to the construction of the railway. The funding request was based on 2,500 passengers using the line daily. The true ridership is one thousandth of this, and the village of Felcs\u00fat only has a population of 1,812. ==Motive Power== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Identity ! Works Number ! Type !
