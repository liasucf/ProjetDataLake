He was the first Brazilian to reach the finals in the Pipeline world bodyboarding championship. He died in a car accident in Portugal when returning to the airport for a flight back to Brazil. Six-time world champion Guilherme T\u00e2mega considers Xandinho one of the two greatest bodyboarders of all time, with legend Mike Stewart. ==External links== * Category:1968 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Bodyboarders Category:Brazilian surfers Category:Road incident deaths in Portugal ",
