    "text": "Robert Harrison (April 14, 1904 \u2013 February 17, 1978) was an American journalist and publisher, known internationally for sensational news stories. He worked for the New York Evening Graphic, the Motion Picture Herald and was publisher of Confidential magazine. ==Early life== He was born Max Harrison, FamilySearch (accessed December 9, 2014) \"Max Harrison United States Census, 1910\" FamilySearch. Max Harrison is the name given in the 1910 US Census, which lists Max Harrison, aged 6, son of Benjamin and Pauline Harrison. Daughters are Helen (age 16), Gertrude (age 12) and Ida (age 10). the youngest child and only son of Benjamin Harrison (February 1868 \u2013 1933) and Pauline Harrison (July 1870\u2013?), Lithuanian Jewish immigrants from (then the Russian Empire). Max grew up in New York City, first in lower Manhattan and later the Bronx, with three sisters, who doted on \"the baby\" of the family. As a young child Max decided to replace his birth name with \"Robert.\" Early on Robert appeared magnanimous, if only due to a tendency to quickly forget slights as he could be not bothered to focus on the negative. In school he did poorly at math but well at English. He wanted to write for a living. At the age of 12 he authored and published a travel guide to roadside inns, Harrison's Weekend Guide. After the printer refused to give Harrison his share of the profits, Harrison formed a belief that one could only trust family members, whom he would later employ in various publishing projects.Samuel Bernstein, (Walford Press, 1st edition, November 27, 2006), Mr. Confidential: The Man, His Magazine & The Movieland Massacre That Changed Hollywood Forever, pp. 21\u201322 But years later, his generous nature would lead him to make an exception at the height of his success with an ex-McCarthyite editor with deadly repercussions.Henry E. Scott (Pantheon, 1st reprint edition, January 19, 2010), Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential, \"America's Most Scandalous Scandal Magazine, pp. 134, 172\u2013173 As a teen, Harrison attended Stuyvesant High School for two years before dropping out. He would later attend night classes at Columbia University.Henry E. Scott (Pantheon, 1st reprint edition, January 19, 2010), Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential, \"America's Most Scandalous Scandal Magazine, p. 29 ==Journalist== During the 1920s Harrison began his journalistic career as a copy boyTom Wolfe (Farrar Straus & Giroux, 1st edition, September 1982), \"Purveyor of the Public Life,\" The Purple Decades: A Reader, p. 79 for Bernarr McFadden's New York Evening Graphic,Darden Asbury Pyron (University Of Chicago Press, June 1, 2001), Liberace: An American Boy, p. 216 an ancestor of the supermarket tabloids that would emerge in the 1960s. Called the \"Pornographic\" by detractors for its emphasis on sex,Neal Gabler (April 2003), \"The Scandalmonger: Confidential's Reign of Terror,\" Vanity Fair (New York City, New York), p. 194 crime and violence, it would provide many of the themes that Harrison would use as a publisher. Among his coworkers were a sportswriter, Ed Sullivan, and a crime reporter, Samuel Fuller. Harrison also met his future hero and mentor, Walter Winchell. At the Graphic Harrison worked his way up to advertising space salesman. But before the paper failed in 1932, Harrison worked eight months as a reporter. One of his first stories was about a Ziegfeld Follies showgirl clad only in balloons. After the Graphic shutdown, Harrison sold song lyrics and returned to writing travel guides (for Cook's). His father, Benjamin Harrison, was a working-class coppersmith who scoffed at what he called \"air business\"\u2014advertising and journalism\u2014he wanted his son to become a carpenter. But Robert persisted after his father's death in 1933. In 1935 Harrison joined the editorial staff of the Motion Picture Herald,Henry E.

Quigley would himself author the decency guidelines with Jesuit Daniel A. Lord that became known as the \"Hays Code.\"Henry E. Scott (Pantheon, 1st reprint edition, January 19, 2010), Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential, \"America's Most Scandalous Scandal Magazine, pp. 13\u201315 In 1935 Quigley in sent Harrison to the Hollywood offices of Quigley Publishing. There Harrison collected publicity photos of would-be actresses sent by agents. While in Hollywood, the idea of a magazine began to form.Samuel Bernstein, (Walford Press, 1st edition, November 27, 2006), Mr. Confidential: The Man, His Magazine & The Movieland Massacre That Changed Hollywood Forever, pp. 25\u201326 ==Publisher== ===Cheesecake=== Harrison returned to New York City. Having learned from Quigley what he could get away with legally, Harrison struck out on his own with a series of non-pornographic \"cheesecake\" magazines.Anthony Slide (University Press of Mississippi, February 26, 2010), Inside the Hollywood Fan Magazine: A History of Star Makers, Fabricators, and Gossip Mongers, p. 180 His first was Beauty Parade (1941\u20131956), started in October 1941. It contained, as its subtitle suggests (\"The World's Loveliest Girls\"), pictures of attractive models who had the \"girl-next-door\" look. Beauty Parade also began the photo-story format that would be repeated by other Harrison publications. Using the facilities of Quigley Publishing surreptitiously at night, Harrison used the photos from his Hollywood visit to paste together his galleries. When he was caught and fired on Christmas Eve, 1941, his sisters Edith and Helen rallied around him and raised several thousand dollars in capital, $400 of it from his favorite niece, Marjorie, who would later become a central figure in his most famous enterprise.Henry E. Scott (Pantheon, 1st reprint edition, January 19, 2010), Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential, \"America's Most Scandalous Scandal Magazine, pp. 14\u201315Samuel Bernstein, (Walford Press, 1st edition, November 27, 2006), Mr. Confidential: The Man, His Magazine & The Movieland Massacre That Changed Hollywood Forever, pp. 28\u201329 Harrison's next magazine, Eyeful (1942\u20131955), was similar to Beauty Parade. The depicted women were still fully, or partially, clothed but were placed in more intimate positions. The models still had the girl-next-door look (\"Glorifying the American Girl\") and would feature a Wall Street secretary, Bettie Page, then supplementing her income for acting lessons.Bunny Yeager (St. Martin's Griffin, 1st edition, July 15, 1994), Betty Page Confidential, p. 26. Harrison would later introduce Page to Irving Klaw. During this period Harrison hired Edythe Farrell from the National Police Gazette. Farrell, a psychology major from Hunter College, \"introduced her new boss to Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis and the idea that whips and chains and spike heels would sell.\"Henry E. Scott (Pantheon, 1st reprint edition, January 19, 2010), Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential, \"America's Most Scandalous Scandal Magazine, pp. 15\u201316 Titter (1943\u20131955), which focused on sadomasochist themes\u2014with women in bondage, handling whips or being spanked\u2014began Harrison's move from \"wholesome\" looking models.Samuel Bernstein, (Walford Press, 1st edition, November 27, 2006), Mr. Confidential: The Man, His Magazine & The Movieland Massacre That Changed Hollywood Forever, pp. 17\u201319 Wink (1944\u20131955) also featured sadomasochist imagery, but contained a stronger element of fetishism. After World War II Harrison created Flirt (1947\u20131955), which mainly featured fetishist photo- stories. Harrison was not beyond posing himself with the models, \"playing everything from pith-helmeted white slaver to wife spanker.\"Victor Davis, (British Journalism Review, Volume 13, No. 4, 2002), \"The father of scandal,\" p. 74 To enhance sales he used three leading Petty Girl-like artists of the day to do the covers: Peter Driben, Earl Moran (AKA Steffa) and Billy De Vorss.Henry E. Scott (Pantheon, 1st reprint edition, January 19, 2010), Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential, \"America's Most Scandalous Scandal Magazine, p. 16 Whisper, May 1950 The one Harrison men's magazine that differed from the Beauty Parade format was Whisper, started in April 1946. It began as a clone of Beauty Parade, but became more explicit, violent and blatantly sexual. In 1953 Harrison was arrested for staging a Whisper photo shoot at a New Jersey golf course. It starred Page as a prisoner being tortured by models dressed in skimpy Ku Klux Klan-like costumes. But the old format of suggested nudity and sex was not working in the 1950s as it did in the '40s. During the heyday of his cheesecake magazines, Harrison moved with his sister Helen from their two-bedroom apartment into a nine-bedroom suite at the Parc Vend\u00f4me. Harrison became a fixture on the New York nightclub scene and was portrayed as a playboy in society columns. He indulged in his trademark proclivity toward all things white\u2014Cadillacs, tailored suits from Sulka, cashmere polo coats and hats.Henry E. Scott (Pantheon, 1st reprint edition, January 19, 2010), Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential, \"America's Most Scandalous Scandal Magazine, p. 15Neal Gabler (April 2003), \"The Scandalmonger: Confidential's Reign of Terror,\" Vanity Fair (New York City, New York), p. 197 He was often photographed in the company of Broadway or Hollywood starlets. But the circulation of his magazines declined in the post-war years. By early 1952Henry E. Scott (Pantheon, 1st reprint edition, January 19, 2010), Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential, \"America's Most Scandalous Scandal Magazine, p. 17 his accountant told him that he was broke.Tom Wolfe (Farrar Straus & Giroux, 1st edition, September 1982), \"Purveyor of the Public Life,\" The Purple Decades: A Reader, p. 80 In addition to rival imitators, Harrison \"could not compete with the new celebrity focused men's magazine, Playboy, whose first issue, released in 1953, featured a full color centerfold of Marilyn Monroe.\"Sarah Marie Horne (University of Missouri, Columbia, 2011), Judged by their covers: Robert Harrison's girlie magazines, 1941-1955, p.63 But Harrison had an aversion to real nudity and never went the route of Playboy. Instead, he returned to his New York Graphic roots. Thus Whisper would morph a third time in the 1950s to imitate the most audacious of Harrison's periodicals.Samuel Bernstein, (Walford Press, 1st edition, November 27, 2006), Mr. Confidential: The Man, His Magazine & The Movieland Massacre That Changed Hollywood Forever, pp. 31\u201333 ===Confidential=== ====Origins==== Back in 1947, Harrison \"mocked up a 'fact' magazine called Eyewitness,\" which was never published. Then in 1952, Harrison spent six months reworking the format of a new, similar magazine. He would later say: \"I must have ripped that thing apart three times before I published it, and it still wasn't right.\"Tom Wolfe (Farrar Straus & Giroux, 1st edition, September 1982), \"Purveyor of the Public Life,\" The Purple Decades: A Reader, p. 81 Supposedly inspired by Virginia Hill's testimony to the Kefauver Committee hearings,Samantha Barbas (University of California Press, October 24, 2005), The First Lady of Hollywood: A Biography of Louella Parsons, p. 328. Most historians doubt the Kefauver hearings being the origin of Confidential, since Harrison worked for tabloid-style publications since his early twenties. Harrison launched his tabloid-style gossip magazine: Confidential. As with the earlier New York Graphic, it concentrated on exposing the substance abuse habits, criminal records and hidden political and sexual preferences of celebrities. For example, the magazine alleged that June Allyson had extramarital affairs (\"How Long Can Dick Powell Take It?\"),Henry E. Scott (Pantheon, 1st reprint edition, January 19, 2010), Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential, \"America's Most Scandalous Scandal Magazine, pp. 127\u2013129 that Johnnie Ray was a \"drag queen\" (\"Is It True What They Say About Johnnie Ray?\")Michael S. Sherry (The University of North Carolina Press, September 10, 2007), Gay Artists in Modern American Culture: An Imagined Conspiracy, pp. 29\u201330 and that Robert Mitchum was an exhibitionist (\"Robert Mitchum...the Nude Who came to Dinner!\")Henry E. Scott (Pantheon, 1st reprint edition, January 19, 2010), Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential, \"America's Most Scandalous Scandal Magazine, pp. 120\u2013122 Apart from spreading gossip, Confidential combined the expos\u00e9s with a conservative agenda especially targeted at those who sympathized with the left wing and in identifying those engaged in \"miscegenation.\" \"The Confidential house style was laden with elaborate, pun-inflected alliteration and allowed stories to suggest, rather than state, the existence of scandal.\"Anne Helen Petersen (The University of Texas at Austin, May 2011), The Gossip Industry: Producing and Distributing Star Images, Celebrity Gossip, and Entertainment News 1910 - 2010, p. 121 But if Harrison had sworn affidavits or photographic/audio proof, the story would go beyond innuendo. Film historian Mary Desjardins described Confidentials editorial style as using \"research methods and writing techniques that recycled old stories or created 'composite' facts as the basis of new ones.\"Adrienne L. McLean, David A. Cook, editors (Rutgers University Press, January 1, 2001), Mary Desjardins, \"Systemizing Scandal: Confidential Magazine, Stardom, and the State of California,\" Headline Hollywood: A Century of Film Scandal (Communications, Media, and Culture), p. 184 Robert Harrison himself described it thus: \"Once we establish the star in the hay and that's documented, we can say anything we want and I think we make them a hell of a lot more interesting than they really are. What's a guy gonna do, sue us and admit he was in the hay with the dame, but claim he didn't do all the other things we dress the story with?\"Harold Conrad (Stein & Day Publishers, April 1982), Dear Muffo: 35 Years in the Fast Lane, p. 99 After the \"facts\" of an article were assembled, a staff of four would rewrite it several times to achieve Confidentials \"toboggan ride\" style: \"racy and free of embroidery, keeps the reader on the edge of his seat.\"J. Howard Rutledge (Wednesday, August 10, 1955), \"The Rise of the Expose Magazines,\" The Kansas City Times (Kansas City, Missouri), p. 30 The final product would be read aloud at a staff meeting for euphony.Harold Conrad (Stein & Day Publishers, April 1982), Dear Muffo: 35 Years in the Fast Lane, pp. 99\u2013100 The first Confidential issue was dated December (released November) 1952 under the caption \"The Lid Is Off!\" Its circulation was 250,000 copies. But when the breakup of Marilyn Monroe's marriage to Joe DiMaggio was reported in the August 1953 issue (\"Why Joe DiMaggio Is Striking Out with Marilyn Monroe!\"), the circulation jumped to 800,000. The quarterly magazine then became bimonthly and was the fastest growing magazine in the US at the time. Harrison would claim its circulation reached four million, and because every copy was estimated to be read by ten persons, it might have reached a fifth of the US population. When Harrison published \"Winchell Was Right About Josephine Baker!\", he came out in support of his childhood mentor at the Graphic during the Stork Club controversy. Winchell returned the favor by mentioning Confidential in his newspaper column and radio broadcasts.Henry E. Scott (Pantheon, 1st reprint edition, January 19, 2010), Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential, \"America's Most Scandalous Scandal Magazine, pp. 20\u201323 Though Harrison would publish non- show business stories involving \"racketeering, consumer scams and politicians' peccadilloes,\" like Quigley Publishing that he previously worked for, the emphasis was Hollywood, but with a twist\u2014\"expos\u00e9s of star secrets\" became Confidentials prime focus.Janet Thumin (I. B. Tauris, March 20, 2002), Small Screens, Big Ideas: Television in the 1950s, p. 122 ====Rise to fame==== Harrison would rent 4000 square feet of office space at 1697 Broadway in New York City, but never had more than 15 staff members,Tom Wolfe (Farrar Straus & Giroux, 1st edition, September 1982) The Purple Decades: A Reader, p. 83 mostly family relations of whom the most important were his sisters Edith and Helen.

According to Harrison, Barbara Payton would stop by Confidential's Hollywood office and sell a story whenever she was short of cash. However, the informants could rise to the level of prominent Hollywood columnists like Florabel MuirVal Holley (Mcfarland & Company, June 12, 2003), Mike Connolly and the Manly Art of Hollywood Gossip, p. 35. Muir was exposed as an informant during the 1957 Harrison trial. and in some cases, all the way up to a producer like Mike ToddHarold Conrad (Stein & Day Publishers, April 1982), Dear Muffo: 35 Years in the Fast Lane, pp. 95\u201396. Mike Todd wanted Harrison to publish a hit-piece on Columbia's Harry Cohn. or even a studio head like Harry Cohn.Ezra Goodman (MacFadden Books, 1962), The Fifty Year Decline and Fall of Hollywood, p. 58. Harry Cohn allegedly suppressed the Confidential story about himself in exchange for rumors regarding Columbia contractee Kim Novak. Money, publicity, revenge or blackmail was the lure. Harrison soon started making approximately half a million dollars per issue. By 1955, Confidential had reached five million copies per issue with a larger circulation than Reader's Digest, Ladies' Home Journal, Look, The Saturday Evening Post or Collier's. That year Harrison shut down all his men's magazines except Beauty Parade and Whisper. Beauty Parade would cease the next year and Whisper would continue as Confidentials sister publication, which recycled variants of Confidentials stories. ====Rushmore==== A film reviewer for the communist Daily Worker, Howard Rushmore was fired for a too favorable review of Gone With The Wind. He moved to the New York Journal-American and became a professional anticommunist. He later became director of research for Senator Joseph McCarthy's Subcommittee on Investigations in 1953. After a dispute with the subcommittee's chief counsel, Roy Cohn, Rushmore resigned. At the Journal-American, Rushmore criticized Cohn in print and was fired from the paper.

Rushmore, having earned the enmity of McCarthyite papers like those of the Hearst chain, found himself cut off from his usual employment.

Scott starred in the anti-McCarthy Western Silver Lode (1954). While his anti-communist hit pieces were bylined under his own name, he used a host of pseudonyms for Hollywood expos\u00e9s, such as \"Juan Morales\" for \"The Lavender Skeletons in TV's Closet\" and \"Hollywood\u2014Where Men Are Men, and Women, Too!\", or \"Brooks Martin\" for the Zsa Zsa Gabor story \"Don't Be Fooled by the Glamour Pusses.\"Sam Kashner, Jennifer MacNair (W.

He also recruited new ones like Mike Connolly of The Hollywood Reporter and Agnes Underwood of the Los Angeles Herald Express.Henry E.

Mosby was nationally known at the time for doing a story at a nudist camp, naked. Later she covered the \"Kitchen Debate\" between Nikita Khrushchev and Richard Nixon and was the first American journalist to interview Lee Harvey Oswald in Moscow. Despite his high salary, Rushmore was repelled by the informants and Harrison.

Harrison communicated with his West Coast network by telegram and phone. But in the rising face of legal threats from the film industry, Harrison would make his boldest move yet.Henry E.

Or more typically, either Meade or an agent would visit the subject and present a copy as a \"buy-back\" proposal, or the story be held back for in exchange for information on other celebrities. But instead of paying the magazine not to publish an article about themselves or implicating others, two actors, Lizabeth Scott and Robert Mitchum, sued. Their attorney was Jerry Giesler, who also represented heiress Doris Duke.James Robert Parish (Arlington House, 1972), The Paramount Pretties, p. 530 ====Two hoaxes==== On July 8, 1955, Rushmore appeared on The Tom Duggan Show in Chicago. He claimed on air that he was on a secret mission to uncover the communist assassins of former Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. Rushmore told the viewers that the leader of the \"Chicago Communist Party,\" whose name was given as \"Lazarovich,\" was in hiding and that Rushmore needed their help in locating him. Rushmore later disappeared from his hotel room, leading to a nationwide manhunt by the FBI.

Since the magazine was domiciled in New York State, and the plaintiffs were California residents who initiated the suits in their own state, the suits were stopped. On March 7, 1956, Los Angeles Supreme Court judge Leon T. David quashed Lizabeth Scott's suit on grounds that the magazine was not published in California. Despite this setback, in addition to Scott's suit, \"Giesler said he also would refile in New York a $2 million suit by actor Robert Mitchum against the magazine if it also is quashed here.\"UP (Thursday, March 8, 1956), \"Court Quashes Actress' Suit,\" Idaho State Journal (Pocatello, Idaho), p. 9 Though Giesler's initial attack failed, lawsuits from other actors continued to pile up\u2014they would eventually total $40 million.Tom Wolfe (Farrar Straus & Giroux, 1st edition, September 1982), \"Purveyor of the Public Life,\" The Purple Decades: A Reader, p. 77 Robert Harrison and Richard Weldy, 1956 In September 1956, Harrison generated front-page headlines around the world when he allegedly was shot in the shoulder during a safari in the Dominican Republic by Richard Weldy, a travel agency owner and former executive for Pan American Grace Airways.Michael Munn (NAL Hardcover, March 2, 2004) John Wayne: The Man Behind the Myth, p. 147 Weldy, variously described as a \"jungle trapper and guide\"AP (Thursday, September 6, 1956) \"Deep In Jungle\u2014Shooting Follows Loud Quarrel,\" The Odessa American (Odessa, Texas), p. 1 or \"a big game hunter,\"UP (Thursday, September 6, 1956) \"Shot Publisher Found In Wilds,\" Valley Morning Star (Harlingen, Texas) p. 1 purportedly harbored a grudge over a Confidential story about his ex-wife, Pilar Pallete, a Peruvian actress who was then married to John Wayne. The nonexistent Confidential article depicted Pallete as having an affair with Wayne while married to Weldy. According to newspaper accounts, Weldy fled the scene, leaving Harrison to die alone in the jungle with his blonde girlfriend; the two were eventually rescued by the Dominican Army. Weldy was later arrested by police. But Harrison refused to press charges against Weldy and the two publicly reconciled.UP (Saturday, September 8, 1956) \"Case Closed: Weldy Released By Dominicans In Shooting Fracas,\" Monroe Morning World (Monroe, Louisiana), p. 3 Later the whole story was revealed to be a hoax\u2014the shooting never took place. Photos of a wounded Harrison in a hospital were staged. Even the \"girlfriend\" was an actress that Harrison hired for the publicity stunt.Samuel Bernstein, (Walford Press, 1st edition, November 27, 2006), Mr. Confidential: The Man, His Magazine & The Movieland Massacre That Changed Hollywood Forever, pp. 201\u2013213. Bernstein is one of the few authors to note that no Confidential Pallete article was on the newsstands at the time of the \"shooting\" incident. The Confidential article that did eventually appear admitted that Pallete was already divorced from Weldy when she met Wayne. During a television interview with Mike Wallace, Harrison fooled the CBS film crew into thinking that a birthmark on his back was the bullet wound.Tom Wolfe (Farrar Straus & Giroux, 1st edition, September 1982), \"Purveyor of the Public Life,\" The Purple Decades: A Reader, pp. 85\u201386 ====1957 mistrial==== Back in New York, Rushmore used his severance pay from Confidential to buy an air ticket to California, where he contacted Giesler's office. Rushmore offered to become a witness in exchange for a job in Hollywood, but Giesler refused. Then Rushmore became a witness for California Attorney General Edmund \"Pat\" Brown. Since Confidential was ensconced in New York state, and New York refused to let Brown extradite Harrison to California, Brown instead put Hollywood Research and Harrison's niece Marjorie and her husband, Fred Meade, on trial. The Meades were actually in New York City at the time of the grand jury indictments and originally intended not to participate in the California trial\u2014libel was not an extraditable offense under New York State law. But Harrison, seeing an opportunity of a lifetime for front-page headlines, wanted to avoid a trial in absentia and encouraged the Meades to return to Los Angeles with defense attorney Arthur Crowley to pleaded their case. Crowley's strategy was simple: put subjects of Confidentials stories on the witness stand and ask them under oath if the stories were true.Tab Hunter (Algonquin Books, September 8, 2006), Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star, p. 183 Film industry executives, who previously tried to convince Edmund Brown to charge Robert Harrison with conspiracy to publish criminal libel, now tried to backpedal for fear of adverse publicity from what would be \"heralded by the press as the 'Trial of a Hundred Stars'.\"David Bret (Anova Books, September 1, 2004), Errol Flynn: Satan's Angel, p. 202 But Brown would have none of it\u2014on August 7, 1957, The People of the State of California v.

Tab Hunter noted: \"Most of my colleagues decided that the first week of August 1957 was the perfect time to take that long delayed Mexican vacation.\" Rushmore, now the state's star witness, testified that the magazine knowingly published unverified allegations, despite the magazine's reputation for double-checking facts: Douglas O. Linder (2010, accessed December 9, 2014) \"Some of the stories are true and some have nothing to back them up at all. Harrison many times overruled his libel attorneys and went ahead on something.\" According to Rushmore, Harrison told the attorneys, \"I'd go out of business if I printed the kind of stuff you guys want.\"Bob Houser, (Saturday, August 10, 1957), \"Actress 'Offered to Have Affair' to Get Hot Story: Tells Role of Cabot's Ex-Wife,\" Independent (Long Beach, California), pp. 1\u20132 Rushmore even fingered Aline Mosby, who was in the press galleries covering the trial for United Press. It was revealed that Mosby wrote upward to 24 stories for Confidential\u2014UP had to replace the disgraced Mosby with another reporter.Val Holley (Mcfarland & Company, June 12, 2003), Mike Connolly and the Manly Art of Hollywood Gossip, p. 29. James P. O'Connell (September 26, 1958, accessed December 14, 2015), \"Subject: Mosby, Aline,\" Federal Bureau of Investigation, Security Support Division. FBI memo notes that United Press fired Mosby for the Confidential leaks. During the trial, two witnesses for the defense unexpectedly died. Private detective Polly Gould was found dead in her apartment of disputed causes.Wire Services (Monday, August 19, 1957), \"Defense Identifies 'Row 35' Occupant',\" Tucson Daily Citizen (Tucson, Arizona), p. 25Lee Belser (Wednesday, August 21, 1957), \"Death Puts Clinker Into Hot Libel Trial,\" Anderson Daily Bulletin (Anderson, Indiana), p. 14. Fred Otash claimed Gould was \"a stool pigeon working both sides.\" She was a former investigator for Confidential and Whisper.Val Holley (Mcfarland & Company, June 12, 2003), Mike Connolly and the Manly Art of Hollywood Gossip, p. 33. The book repeats an allegation that Gould committed suicide after killing her lesbian lover. The previous week, Mae West's alleged love interest in Confidentials \"Mae West's Open Door Policy\", Chalky Wright, was found dead in a bathtub before he could testify that the story was factual.Anonymous (Saturday, August 17, 1957), \"'Chalky White' Found Dead In Bathtub,\" The New York Age (New York City, New York), p. 3 Harrison's attorneys tried to give witnesses (who were also plaintiffs in other lawsuits against Harrison) a face-saving exit with token out-of-court settlements, such as the May 1957, $10,000 settlement with Dorothy Dandridge.Henry E. Scott (Pantheon, 1st reprint edition, January 19, 2010), Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential, \"America's Most Scandalous Scandal Magazine, p. 167. After cashing Harrison's check, Dandridge testified for the prosecution anyway. But three of the most prominent witnesses for the prosecution\u2014Liberace, Errol Flynn and Maureen O'HaraDarden Asbury Pyron (University Of Chicago Press, June 1, 2001), Liberace: An American Boy, p. 223. Liberace, Flynn and O'Hara were only witnesses and not plaintiffs in the California trial. Liberace and Flynn were not called to testify. None of the other lawsuits\u2014from Lizabeth Scott's to O'Hara's\u2014ever went to trial.\u2014refused to settle out-of-court. But when a mistrial was declared on October 1, 1957, after two weeks of deliberations, the three witnesses would give up on their own individual lawsuits. But Edmund Brown preempted Confidentials win by calling for a retrial. Harrison was rattled. To spare his niece another ordeal\u2014and the danger of three-years' imprisonment\u2014Harrison promised the Attorney General to publish only positive stories.Henry E. Scott (Pantheon, 1st reprint edition, January 19, 2010), Shocking True Story: The Rise and Fall of Confidential, \"America's Most Scandalous Scandal Magazine, p. 187 ==Later years== Confidential, April 1958, the last issue by Harrison Harrison's publicity stunt backfired. The deal with Brown became the effective end of Confidential and Whisper, as the magazines were no longer able to publish their usual scandalous stories. The magazines' one and only trial cost Harrison over $500,000\u2014in addition to legal fees of $500,000 and a $5,000 fine for each magazine,UP (Thursday, December 19, 1957), \"Judge Fines Confidential And Whisper $5,000 Each,\" The Daily Inter Lake (Kalispell, Montana), p. 2 Maureen O'Hara settled out-of-court for an undisclosed sum on July 1, 1958;AP (Wednesday, July 2, 1958), \"Actress Drops Suit Against Confidential,\" The Oregon Statesman (Salem, Oregon), p. 4 Errol Flynn settled on July 8, 1958AP (Wednesday, July 9, 1958), \"Flynn Settles A Suit,\" The Kansas City Times (Kansas City, Missouri), p. 15 for $15,000;Errol Flynn (Cooper Square Press, 1st edition, November 4, 2002), My Wicked, Wicked Ways: The Autobiography of Errol Flynn, p. 433 and on July 16, 1958, Liberace settled for $40,000, an amount that the pianist might typically exceed with one or two performances.Darden Asbury Pyron (University Of Chicago Press, June 1, 2001), Liberace: An American Boy, p. 159\u2013161. On May 26, 1954, Liberace played in Madison Square Garden. He was paid $138,000. In addition the legal fees and settlements, Harrison gave the Meades $150,000 as a gift.Samuel Bernstein, (Walford Press, 1st edition, November 27, 2006), Mr. Confidential: The Man, His Magazine & The Movieland Massacre That Changed Hollywood Forever, p. 266 He was still a multimillionaire. But the Hollywood informant network was in shambles, mainly due to Howard Rushmore's courtroom revelations. Characteristically of Harrison, he bore no ill will toward Rushmore, who by 1957 was reduced to writing occasional articles on hunting for outdoors magazines.AP (Saturday, January 4, 1958), \"Former Editor Confidential Kills Wife\u2014Rushmore Then Shoots Himself,\" The Bee (Danville, Virginia), p. 13 In December 1957, Rushmore chased his wife Frances and teenaged step-daughter Lynn out of their Manhattan home with a shotgun. While Frances was under psychiatric care since the East River incident, Howard himself was now under psychiatric care. On January 3, 1958, at 6:15 pm, a few days before Frances was scheduled to lead a junket of editors to Brazil, the Rushmores met in a final attempt at a reconciliation. An argument broke out between the couple and Frances left the lobby of their apartment building and hailed a taxi. Simultaneously, Howard entered the cab. As the two continued arguing, the cab raced to the 23rd Precinct at Third and 104th. They were only two blocks away when Frances screamed, \"Oh my God!\" Suddenly, three gunshots fired inside the cab. Rushmore had shot his wife in the right side of the head and neck then put the pistol to his temple and shot himself.Sam Kashner, Jennifer MacNair (W. W. Norton & Company, May 17, 2003), The Bad & the Beautiful: Hollywood in the Fifties, pp. 43\u201346 Harrison himself heard about the murder-suicide when a taxicab picked him up at Idlewild Airport. The driver told Harrison that the publisher of Confidential just killed himself and his wife, momentarily confusing the unmarried Harrison.Tom Wolfe (Farrar Straus & Giroux, 1st edition, September 1982), \"Purveyor of the Public Life,\" The Purple Decades: A Reader, p. 72 Later Harrison refused to believe the suicide narrative and thought Howard Rushmore was murdered. He remained loyal to Rushmore even after the California trial and the Rushmores' scandalous deaths. The rights to Whisper and Confidential were sold off in May 1958.AP (Saturday, May 17, 1958), \"Two Expose Magazines Change Hands,\" The Oregon Statesman (Salem, Oregon), p. 2 The buyer, Hy Steirman, further toned down the content of both magazines.Samuel Bernstein, (Walford Press, 1st edition, November 27, 2006), Mr. Confidential: The Man, His Magazine & The Movieland Massacre That Changed Hollywood Forever, p. 267 But Harrison remained in publishing, if only as a pastime. In 1963 he started a much smaller magazine called Inside News (in which he authored \"Who Really Killed Howard Rushmore?\"), as well as one-shot publications like New York Confidential. Harrison continued to live in New York City during the next two decades under an assumed name, while plotting a comeback.Tom Wolfe (Farrar Straus & Giroux, 1st edition, September 1982), \"Purveyor of the Public Life,\" The Purple Decades: A Reader, pp. 72\u201374 But lacking the financial pressures that drove Harrison to create his previous magazines, he was essentially retired, living his remaining years at the Delmonico Hotel, at 59th Street and Park Avenue.\"Neal Gabler (April 2003), \"The Scandalmonger: Confidential's Reign of Terror,\" Vanity Fair (New York City, New York), p. 206 Robert Harrison died in 1978 with his long-time mistress, Regi Ruta, at his side; that same year Confidential was shut down. ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1978 deaths Category:American anti-communists Category:American investigative journalists Category:American people of Lithuanian descent Category:American publishers (people) Category:Journalists from New York City Category:20th-century American non- fiction writers Category:20th-century American businesspeople ",
