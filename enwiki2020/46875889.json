    "text": "The Lakeside EfW is located in Colnbrook, Slough, and is the largest facility of its kind in England. It incinerates residual waste, and since 2010 it has also been authorised to incinerate low-level radioactive waste. ==Ownership== The Lakeside EfW is run by Lakeside Energy from Waste Ltd, which is a joint venture between Grundon Waste Management and Viridor. The energy-from-waste facility was established at a cost of \u00a3160 million and was officially opened by the Duke of Edinburgh on 27 October 2010. ==Capacity== It is capable of processing 410,000 tonnes of residual waste annually and generating 37MW of electricity, enough to power the borough of Slough. ==Possible relocation== In 2014, expansion plans for London's Heathrow Airport suggested that the super incinerator would need to be relocated to make way for a new runway. ==Controversy== The incinerator has been the subject of controversy due to concerns about the potential influence of incinerator air pollution on infant mortality rates and life expectancies in the area. Infant mortality rates have increased in recent years, running against the national trend of gradual reduction. == References == == External links == * Category:Waste power stations in England ",
