    "text": "The 7.5 FK Brno Field Pistol is a double stack magazine single-action, tilting barrel type mechanism, with a proprietary recoil attenuating system. This is a modified design of CZ-75 and Tanfoglio pistol models. Concept and design has been registered and claimed by FK Brno. ==History== According to the manufacturer, the pistol was under development since 2011. The designers wanted a handgun that could be concealed yet could provide accurate shots out to 100 meters with a flat trajectory. The development parameters included: * Its overall length must be small enough so that it can be loaded and shot in a standard civilian size and weight double-stack magazine-fed pistol; * A barrel length of 6 inches (152 mm); there must be enough room for the powder charge to propel the bullet to its maximum potential velocity; * Recoil energy should not exceed that of a hot .45 ACP +P load. * The bullet should have enough speed to consistently hit a 100\u00d7100 mm (3.93-sq.in.) target at 100 meters. * The bullet's terminal performance at 100 meters must be enough to take down a 330-lb. living target utilizing hydrostatic shock; * The target's permanent wound cavity should measure a minimum of 35mm in diameter (roughly 1.38 inches wide) and 300mm in length (roughly 11.81 inches long) Due to these specifications, FK BRNO had to design the 7.5 FK round from scratch. FK Brno first showcased the Field Pistol at the IWA 2015 expo. ==Design details== The 7.5 FK Field Pistol is a single action, tilting barrel type mechanism, with a proprietary recoil attenuating system. Another unique feature are the \"butterfly\" sights designed by FK BRNO, designed to give the shooter a larger view of the target area and to automatically align with the front sight, and is adjustable for windage. This double stack magazine fed automatic pistol has general dimensions and weight similar to current standard issue steel military pistols. Proprietary cartridge and projectile have a proven effective range in terms of accuracy and terminal ballistics of at least 100 meters (110 yards) against targets that weight up to 150 kg (330 lbs) while maintaining low recoil and controllability. Single hand use ability. Rapid acquisition sight system that does not require adjustment within the range spectrum. The manufacturer claims that the pistol is very ergonomic and even though the magazine holds 15-35 mm long rounds, the smallest hands are able to fully wrap around the optimally angled grip of the pistol. The cartridge produces roughly 850 foot pounds (~1150 joules). In comparison, 9x19 parabellum and 45 ACP produce ~360ft/lbs (~488j), 10mm produces 700ft/lbs (960j), and 44 magnum produces 1,100ft/lbs (~1500j) ==References== Category:2011 establishments in the Czech Republic Category:2011 establishments in the United States Category:Short recoil firearms ",
