    "text": "The 1936 Quebec general election was held on August 17, 1936 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The Union Nationale, led by Maurice Duplessis, defeated the incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Ad\u00e9lard Godbout. This marked the end of slightly more than 39 consecutive years in power for the Liberals, who had governed Quebec since the 1897 election. This 1936 election had been called less than one year after the 1935 election after Liberal premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau resigned because of a scandal. He was replaced by Godbout as Liberal leader and premier. This was Duplessis's first term in office. After losing the subsequent 1939 election, he later won four more general elections in a row, and became the dominant politician of his time. It was also the Union Nationale's first election, having been formed from a merger between the Action lib\u00e9rale nationale and the Quebec Conservative Party. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"3\"|Seats !colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" |align=\"center\"|1935 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|% Change | Maurice Duplessis |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|42 !align=\"right\"|76 |align=\"right\"|+81.0% |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 56.88% |align=\"right\"|+8.5% |Ad\u00e9lard Godbout |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|47 !align=\"right\"|14 |align=\"right\"|-70.2% |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 39.41% |align=\"right\"|-7.1% |colspan=2|Other |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 3.71% |align=\"right\"|-1.4% |- |colspan=\"3\"|Total !align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|89 !align=\"right\"|90 !align=\"right\"|+1.1% !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"|100% |align=\"right\"| |- |} Note: Results change is compared to the combined totals of the Conservative and Action lib\u00e9rale nationale parties in 1935. ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * 20th Legislative Assembly of Quebec Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election ",
