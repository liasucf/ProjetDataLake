    "text": "Linpark High School is a co-educational public boarding school situated on Claude Forsyth Rd, in Boughton, a northern suburb of Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The school's curriculum has a technical bias, with courses in subjects such as motor mechanics and electronics in addition to more traditional subjects such as maths and science. Although it has boarding facilities, the majority of the school's students are day pupils, living locally. Originally an all-white school, the first black pupils were admitted in 1991. ==External links== * Photographs of Linpark High School from the mid-1970s (by Erich Dedekind) Category:Boarding schools in South Africa Category:High schools in South Africa Category:Schools in KwaZulu-Natal ",
