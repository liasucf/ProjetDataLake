    "text": "The odd number theorem is a theorem in strong gravitational lensing which comes directly from differential topology. The theorem states that the number of multiple images produced by a bounded transparent lens must be odd. == Formulation == The gravitational lensing is a thought to mapped from what's known as image plane to source plane following the formula : M: (u,v) \\mapsto (u',v'). == Argument == If we use direction cosines describing the bent light rays, we can write a vector field on (u,v) plane V:(s,w). However, only in some specific directions V_0:(s_0,w_0), will the bent light rays reach the observer, i.e., the images only form where D=\\delta V=0|_{(s_0,w_0)}. Then we can directly apply the Poincar\u00e9\u2013Hopf theorem \\chi=\\sum \\text{index}_D = \\text{constant}. The index of sources and sinks is +1, and that of saddle points is \u22121\\. So the Euler characteristic equals the difference between the number of positive indices n_{+} and the number of negative indices n_{-}. For the far field case, there is only one image, i.e., \\chi=n_{+}-n_{-}=1. So the total number of images is N=n_{+}+n_{-}=2n_{-}+1 , i.e., odd. The strict proof needs Uhlenbeck's Morse theory of null geodesics. ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * Perlick V., Gravitational lensing from a geometric viewpoint, in B.
