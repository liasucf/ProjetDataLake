    "text": "Manniella is a genus of orchids (family Orchidaceae) belonging to the subfamily Orchidoideae. It consists of two species: the type species Manniella gustavi Rchb.f. and Manniella cypripedioides, Salazar & al., both from West Africa. Because of its phylogenetic position as the sister of Neotropical subtribes Cranichidinae s.l. and Spiranthinae, its subtribal status is justified on evolutionary grounds. The genus is named after Gustav Mann == References == * Garay, L.A. Bot. Mus. Leafl. 28:333,1980 * Salazar, G.A., T. Franke, L. Zapfack and L. Beenken. 2002.
