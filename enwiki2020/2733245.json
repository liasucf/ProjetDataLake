    "text": "Alpha Sigma Tau (\u0391\u03a3\u03a4) is a national Panhellenic sorority founded on November 4, 1899, at Michigan State Normal College (now Eastern Michigan University). Alpha Sigma Tau is a member of the National Panhellenic Conference, an umbrella organization encompassing 26 national sororities or women's fraternities, which focus on service, education, scholarship programming and social activities. Once a sorority exclusively for teacher's/educational colleges, Alpha Sigma Tau became a full member in 1951, and, as a social sorority, now admits members without limits based on major. Currently, there are 85 chapters around the US. == Founding == In 1899, eight women founded Alpha Sigma Tau's first chapter at Michigan State Normal College (now Eastern Michigan University): Helene M. Rice, her sister Adriance Rice, Mayene Tracy, Eva O\u2019Keefe, May Gephart, Mabel Chase, Ruth Dutcher, and Harriet Marx. There were three other sororities on campus at the time: Pi Kappa Sigma (now inactive), Sigma Nu Phi, and Zeta Phi (now inactive). The name \"Alpha Sigma Tau\" was chosen, and emerald green and gold were chosen for the colors. It was initially founded as an educational sorority. Effie E. Polyhamus Lyman was chosen patroness. During the first year of its existence, the sorority did not display any marked activity. The charter was not received until the second year, when Edith Silk, Myrtle Oram, Zoe Waldron, Grace Townley, Marie Gedding, Louise Agrell and Mable Pitts had joined the organization and, with the organizers, were the charter members. On the suggestion of Mrs. Effie E Polyhamus Lyman, Miss Abigail Pearce and Miss Ada A. Norton were asked to be patronesses.\"Who We Are \u2013 History\", AlphaSigmaTau.org. Six years later, the Beta Chapter was founded in 1905 at Central Michigan Normal College, which is now Central Michigan University in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. Alpha Sigma Tau held its first conference in 1926, in Detroit, Michigan, and joined the Association of Education Sororities that same year, after refusing to join purely professional associations due to also having a social focus. In 1947, AES merged with the National Panhellenic Conference, and the sorority became a Panhellenic group. The merger allowed Alpha Sigma Tau and the other AES sororities to begin establishing chapters at any accredited school, though existing chapters were encouraged to have larger memberships for the next fall rush. In 1946, the sorority partnered with the Pine Mountain Settlement School and raised funds for the cause until 2016. During this time, the sorority also partnered with Habitat for Humanity. The sorority's National Headquarters were created in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1995, and moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, in 2009. == National Presidents == {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- ! Years !

Its flower is the yellow rose, its jewel is the pearl, and its symbol is the anchor. The sorority does not have an official mascot. The badge is a black, kite-like polygon with a golden \u0391\u03a3\u03a4 inscribed on the enamel, bordered by gold, sometimes inlaid with small pearls. Members with different roles may order badges with different jewels on the badge's four points. Volunteers have rubies, yellow topaz for NPC delegates, and emerald for National Council members and National Officers, while all past and current National President's badge has a double border of gold inlaid with diamonds. === Sorority crest === The crest of the sorority, which was designed by Ruth Mayers Glosser in 1922 is made of symbols important to the organization: an open book, a crown, 6 stars, and an anchor (counterclockwise starting from top right). At the top of the crest there is a candle with glowing rays, and at the bottom there is a banner with Alpha Sigma Tau written in Greek (\u0391\u03bb\u03a6\u03b1 \u03a3\u0399\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1 \u03a4\u03b1\u03c5). This crest is to be worn by initiated members only. == Programs == === National foundation === The fraternity's National Council created the Alpha Sigma Tau National Foundation in 1982as a 501 (c)(3) non-profit to manage donations in support of the sorority. The donations go towards the sorority's educational programs and scholarships, and they were used to purchase the current Alpha Sigma Tau National Headquarters office. === Philanthropy === The sorority's official philanthropy is the Women's Wellness Initiative, which is a model where the national sorority partners with national organizations focused on empowering women and girls. Individual collegiate and alumnae chapters coordinate local philanthropic fundraisers and service projects. As of 2019, Alpha Sigma Tau has partnered with Dress for Success and Girls Who Code. Incorporated in 1982, the foundation provides a variety of resources, including: over 30 scholarships, funds for a charitable project, permanent headquarters for the sorority, a place for the storage and display of Alpha Sigma Tau's historical records, and educational programming at the chapter, Regional Leadership Workshop, and National Convention levels. === Education === Aside from participating in local philanthropy, undergraduate chapters and members have educational programming. Members may join as undergraduate or graduate students. At the 2008 National Convention, the Sorority raised the minimum collegiate GPA from 2.3 to 2.5 on a 4.0 scale (at B-C average). All sisters who have joined after the fall 2008 semester are required to meet this national standard. === Publications === * THE ANCHOR is the sorority's magazine, published twice annually. Its articles pertain to Alpha Sigma Tau, Greek life, and issues affecting women today. * Alpha Signal is a monthly newsletter distributed to National Staff and to chapters, both collegiate and alumnae. This bulletin relays messages from National Council and Staff and discusses upcoming events and other items of importance to the Sorority. * The Crest is the sorority's magazine that focuses on alumni news, is published at least biannually, and is viewable online.\"The Crest\", AlphaSigmaTau.org. * The Foundation Circle is an electronic newsletter delivered monthly to supporters of the Alpha Sigma Tau Foundation. == Membership == === Active chapters and colonies === === Alumnae associations === Alpha Sigma Taus across the United States participate in alumnae associations. These associations include alumnae chapters, clubs, social teams, support teams, and hope groups. Alumnae sisters who live more than fifty miles from an active alumnae association are invited to join the Anchor Chapter or to form their own association with local alumnae. In addition to joining a local association or the Anchor Chapter, alumnae may be invited to join the Emerald Chapter.\"Emerald Chapter\", AlphaSigmaTau.org. The requirements for becoming a member of the Emerald Chapter include serving a minimum of four years as National Council or Staff or attending a minimum of three National Conventions. === National Headquarters === National Headquarters is the home of the Sorority's archives and publications. Photographs, awards, and other historical documents are on display. Additionally, Headquarters can connect people with collegiate and alumnae chapters, National Council and Staff, and the Alpha Sigma Tau National Foundation, Inc. The original location of the National Headquarters was St. Louis, Missouri, adopted in 1949 by National President Dorothy Robinson. National Headquarters was relocated to Birmingham, Alabama, in 1994 for 16 years. In 2009, Alpha Sigma Tau moved its National Headquarters to Indianapolis, Indiana, the home of over 30 other Greek organizations. === Notable alumnae === *Mildred Doran (Alpha) \u2013 aviator *Gwen Frostic (Alpha) \u2013 nature artist and environmentalist; Inducted into Michigan Women's Hall of Fame *Jessica Furrer (Upsilon) \u2013 Miss Arkansas USA 2005; Semi-finalist in Miss USA 2005 *Terri Utley (Upsilon) \u2013 Miss Arkansas USA 1982; Winner of Miss USA 1982 == See also == *List of social fraternities and sororities == References == == External links == * Alpha Sigma Tau official website Category:1899 establishments in Michigan Category:Fraternities and sororities based in Indianapolis Category:National Panhellenic Conference Category:Student organizations established in 1899 Category:Sororities ",
