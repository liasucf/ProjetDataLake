    "text": "Cornwall Hospice Care is a charity based in Cornwall established in 1980 providing palliative care. It operates Mount Edgcumbe Hospice in St Austell and St Julia's Hospice in Hayle. From 1999 until 2006 the two hospices were run as separate charities though with a single Board of Trustees and one Senior Management Team. It costs \u00a38.4 million a year to run the organisation, but only 11% of this is funded by the NHS, much less than the national funding average of 34% for hospices. The Wolfson Foundation provided a grant of \u00a388,000 towards a major refurbishment of Mount Edgcumbe Hospice in 2013. ==References== ==External links== * Cornwall Hospice Care Category:Hospices in England Category:Health in Cornwall Category:1980 establishments in England ",
