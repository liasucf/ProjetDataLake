    "text": "The Continuous Evilution of Life's ?'s (pronounced \"The Continuous Evilution of Life's Questions\") is the eleventh studio album by American hip hop duo Twiztid. It was released on January 27, 2017, through Majik Ninja Entertainment with distribution via INgrooves. Recording sessions took place at the Dojo in Michigan. Production was handled by Michael \"Seven\" Summers, Needlz, Davey Suicide, Skull Seagal and Afro Keys. It features guest appearances from Boondox, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, G-Mo Skee, Lex \"The Hex\" Master and The R.O.C. The album received mixed reviews from critics and fans alike, with criticism aimed at the album having a much more radio-friendly sound, departing from the duo's characteristic undeground and horrorcore music. ==Background== First word of the album was announced on March 24, 2016, in the VIP single, that the album would be titled The Continuous Evilution of Life's ?'s.
