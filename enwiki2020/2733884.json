    "text": "This article gives an overview of the heath communities in the British National Vegetation Classification system. ==Introduction== The heath communities of the NVC were described, along with the mire communities, in Volume 2 of British Plant Communities, first published in 1991. In total, 22 heath communities have been identified. The heath communities consist of six separate subgroups: * five lowland dry heath communities, all with distinct, largely non-overlapping distributions in England and Wales (H1, H2, H6, H8 and H9) * three localised communities, with non-overlapping ranges in southern England, which are considered transitional between the above and the wetter communities classified in the NVC as mires (H3, H4 and H5) * two maritime heath communities, found exclusively on the coasts of northern and western Britain; one (H7) is more widespread than the other (H11) * four submontane heaths from upland areas in northern and western Britain; two of these (H10 and H12) are widespread, whereas the other two (H16 and H21) are more localised (confined to Scotland, and Scotland and the Lake District, respectively) * two sub-alpine communities, considered transitional between the previous and next groupings - H18, which is widespread in northern and western Britain), and H22, which is confined to Scotland * six montane heath communities with lichens and mosses, all of which are confined either to Scotland (H13, H14, H15, H17 and H20) or to Scotland and the Lake District (H19) ==List of heath communities== The following is a list of the communities that make up this category: * H1 Calluna vulgaris - Festuca ovina heath * H2 Calluna vulgaris - Ulex minor heath * H3 Ulex minor - Agrostis curtisii heath * H4 Ulex gallii - Agrostis curtisii heath * H5 Erica vagans - Schoenus nigricans heath * H6 Erica vagans - Ulex europaeus heath * H7 Calluna vulgaris - Scilla verna heath * H8 Calluna vulgaris - Ulex gallii heath * H9 Calluna vulgaris - Deschampsia flexuosa heath * H10 Calluna vulgaris - Erica cinerea heath * H11 Calluna vulgaris - Carex arenaris heath * H12 Calluna vulgaris - Vaccinium myrtillus heath * H13 Calluna vulgaris - Cladonia arbuscula heath * H14 Calluna vulgaris - Racomitrium lanuginosum heath * H15 Calluna vulgaris - Juniperus communis ssp. nana heath * H16 Calluna vulgaris - Arctostaphylos uva-ursi heath * H17 Calluna vulgaris - Arctostaphylos alpinus heath * H18 Vaccinium myrtillus - Deschampsia flexuosa heath * H19 Vaccinium myrtillus - Cladonia arbuscula heath * H20 Vaccinium myrtillus - Racomitrium lanuginosum heath * H21 Calluna vulgaris - Vaccinium myrtillus - Sphagnum capillifolium heath * H22 Vaccinium myrtillus - Rubus chamaemorus heath ==Sources== * Rodwell, J.
