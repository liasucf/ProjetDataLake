Valedictorian of his high school, R\u00e9 went on to earn a B.Sc. in Physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1972, graduating with honors (fifth in his class).(Veronda, Winifred, 1989) R\u00e9 selected as his first medium the drawing pencil. Writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, art critic Alfred Frankenstein said, \"R\u00e9 is a virtuoso of the pencil which he uses with incredible delicacy and refinement.\" (Frankenstein, Alfred, 1974) Paul R\u00e9 has also exhibited acrylic paintings, found object constructions, sculpture, bas-reliefs, embossings, R\u00e9ograms (hybrid hand-digital prints), and sumi-e paintings. In the encyclopedia, Contemporary Graphic Artists, art historian Denis Wepman wrote, \"The singular purity of R\u00e9's simple, highly stylized designs gives them a unique place in modern art . . . The extraordinary sensitivity of their line and composition appeals to the senses with a haunting directness.\" (Wepman, Dennis, 1988) R\u00e9 started exhibiting in California and New Mexico during the 1970s. Since then, he has had 22 solo exhibits in 13 states, including at the UNM Jonson Gallery, Albuquerque Museum, Triangle Gallery, Wichita Museum, Sumter Gallery, J. B. Speed Museum, the Colorado Springs Museum and the Karpeles Museum.https://www.amazon.com/Art-Peace-Transcendence-R\u00e9ograms- Elevate/dp/0826355153 In 1979, R\u00e9 began creating the embossed works which gave a tactile form to his visual creations and the resulting exhibition \u201cTOUCHABLE ART: An Exhibit for the Blind and the Sighted\u201d travelled in the United States and into Canada from 1981 to 1994.

Music is another facet of R\u00e9's creativity. His 50-minute recording Compositions for Classical guitar included an introduction to his traveling exhibit. It was reviewed in the Summer 1986 issue of THE LOG OF THE BRIDGETENDER of the American Council of the Blind by Editor Sue Tullos. (Tullos, Sue, 1986) Paul's work has been highly regarded by scientists and Nobel Laureates Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Richard Feynman and Roger Sperry; artists Georgia O'Keeffe, Raymond Jonson, and Ed Garman; Caltech President Emeritus Tom Everhart and many others.https://muse.jhu.edu/book/42603 ==R\u00e9 Peace Prize== Extending Paul R\u00e9's work of promoting \"harmony in the world\", the bi-annual Paul Bartlett R\u00e9 Peace Prize has been established at the University of New Mexico.
