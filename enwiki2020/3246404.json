    "text": "Arcomage is a computerized card game produced by The 3DO Company. It originated as a minigame in Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor and Might and Magic VIII: Day of the Destroyer, in which it was used to gamble for in- game money or to complete a quest to win games in every tavern. 3DO later released it as a stand-alone game in 2000. In the stand-alone version a single player can play against a computer opponent or two players can play via a LAN or TCP/IP connection. Arcomage uses the fantasy themes of the game in which it is set. Arcomage was developed by Stickman Games. The game was sold to 3DO. ==Gameplay== Arcomage takes the form of a tabletop game, in which there are two players, each with a deck of cards, a \"tower\" and a \"wall\", as well as several other variables that determine whether they win or lose, and what cards they can play. As Might and Magic is a single-player game, one would always play against an AI opponent - making the game relatively easy to win. Players take it in turns to: *Draw the appropriate number of cards to complete their 6-part deck (one or more cards would have been played or discarded during their previous turn) *Either play or discard a card, depending on their options - in some cases discard will be the only option available, as the player might not have the appropriate number of \"gems\", \"bricks\" or \"recruits\". *If their chosen card allows it, play again and/or choose a card to discard. Every tavern has its different victory conditions, so players must adapt their styles for different situations. A game could end in one of the following ways: *A player's tower has been reduced to 0 *A player's tower has achieved a \"height\" of X (value depends on Tavern) *A player accumulates X amount of resources (value depends on Tavern) As well as having a \"Tower\", \"Wall\" and Deck of Cards, each player also has: *\"Quarry\" - controls how many \"bricks\" are gained each turn *\"Bricks\" - spent on brick cards *\"Magic\" - controls how many \"gems\" are gained each turn *\"Gems\" - spent on gem cards *\"Dungeon\" - controls how many \"recruits\" are gained each turn *\"Recruits\" - spent on recruit cards Arcomage employs a wide range of cards, each with their own name, effects and picture. Several cards were added to the original deck in Might and Magic VIII. Examples include: *Faerie (recruit card): 2 damage (to enemy tower/wall); play Again. Cost: 1 recruit. *Portcullis (brick card): +5 wall; +1 dungeon. Cost: 9 bricks. *Sanctuary (gem card): + 10 tower; +5 wall; gain 5 recruits. Cost: 15 gems. ==References== Category:1999 video games Category:2000 video games Category:Card games introduced in 1999 Category:Card battle video games Category:The 3DO Company games Category:New World Computing games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Freeware games Category:Might and Magic spin-off games ",
