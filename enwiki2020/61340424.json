    "text": "Carlson Kamaka K\u016bkona, III (born 1978), otherwise simply known as Kamaka K\u016bkona, is a Hawaiian musician, vocalist, songwriter, record producer, kumu hula (hula teacher), and educator from Maui, Hawaii. In 2013, after years of recording, K\u016bkona, released his debut album, Hanu \u02bbA\u02bbala. The album later went on to earn the Male Vocalist of the Year and the Most Promising Artist awards at the 2014 N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards. K\u016bkona is one of only six Hawaiian musicians to be awarded both awards on a debut music album. The success of Hanu \u02bbA\u02bbala earned a nomination in the 57th Annual Grammy Awards for the Best Regional Roots Music Album. At the time, K\u016bkona was the only Hawaiian music artist nominated for the category. Due to the merger of multiple regional roots music categories into the Best Regional Roots Music Award in 2011, Hanu \u02bbA\u02bbala faced increasing odds in the category historically dominated by Louisiana Cajun music. The album ultimately did not win the Grammy Award. In 2017, K\u016bkona released his second album, \u02bbAla Anuhea, featuring a wonderful array of newly composed mele. The album was mixed and recorded by Dave Tucciarone of Seventh Wave Studio. Again, K\u016bkona was awarded the Male Vocalist of the Year award at the 2018 N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards. ==Early life== Kamaka was five when his mother signed him up for hula lessons, and it quickly became evident that he had a knack for it. It wasn\u2019t long before he caught the eye of hula master Mae Kam\u0101malu Klein, who invited Kamaka to start the \u2018uniki (graduation) process at nineteen \u2014 something of a rarity in hula. == H\u0101lau O Ka Hanu Lehua == In 2003, after a successful \u02bbuniki process, K\u016bkona opened his own hula h\u0101lau, H\u0101lau O Ka Hanu Lehua in Waikapu, Maui. The h\u0101lau accepts members of all ages. H\u0101lau O ka Hanu Lehua have made several appearances at hula festivals across Hawai\u02bbi and Japan. As early as 2007, H\u0101lau o Ka Hanu Lehua have been making regular appearances at the Merrie Monarch Festival in Hilo,Hawaii. ===Awards=== ====Merrie Monarch Festival==== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"75%\" |- ! width=\"5%\"| Year ! width=\"10%\"| Group ! width=\"10%\"| Category ! width=\"20%\"| Result ! width=\"5%\"| Ref |- | align=\"center\"| 2007 | align=\"center\" | K\u0101ne | align=\"center\" | Kahiko | align=\"center\" | 4th Place (534 pts) | align=\"center\"| |- |} == Discography == === Solo Albums === * 2013: Hanu \u02bbA\u02bbala * 2017: \u02bbAla Anuhea == Music Awards == === N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards === The N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano Awards, also known as the \"H\u014dk\u016b Awards\", are Hawaii's equivalent to the Grammy Awards.
