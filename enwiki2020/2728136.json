The building departed from the neo-gothic norms of town halls in the region, having presented with a more modern 1960's design. It was demolished in 2012. Civic facilities were relocated, with full council and other larger political meetings taking place at Inspire 2 Learn, formerly Eston's City Learning Centre, also in Teesville, on Normanby Road.The Northern Echo: Redcar News \u2013 Earlier town hall closure to save cash The leader and deputy leader's office, together with offices for political groups, were temporarily moved there until new facilities become available within the \u00a331 million Redcar Leisure & Community Heart scheme. In addition, the mayor's office was temporarily relocated to Kirkleatham Museum, before also switching to Redcar in 2013.Middlesbrough Evening Gazette: Redcar and Cleveland council leader hits out at party's 'hypocrisy' The town hall closure also provides an environmental boost, as it was the authority's worst-performing building for carbon dioxide emissions.Town Hall move to save council millions ==Schools== Hillsview Academy is a secondary school on the same site as the civic centre. The school was formed from a merger of rwo secondary schools on the same site - Gillbrook Academy (which opened in 1955 as Eston Grammar School, but moved into a new building in 2008 which is where the school is now) and Eston Park Academy. Teesville Infant School is a thriving little school, unusual in the area for being a separate Infant School, catering for children aged 4 \u2013 7, rather than the usual Primary School for 4 \u2013 11-year olds. In 2007 it was declared an outstanding school by Ofsted.Teesville Infant School \u2013 Ofsted report Consultations were initiated in 2011 on a proposal by Redcar and Cleveland Council to expand Teesville Infant School to include Ravensworth Junior School, turning it into a school for the full primary age range.Teesville Infant School and Ravensworth Junior School Consultation Under the plan \u00a32.1m will be spent providing additional accommodation on the Ravensworth site for a 300-place primary school.

It shows a triangular design with a long sloping roof almost to the ground on one side. It forms half of the team parish of two Anglican churches \u2013 the other being the much more traditionally designed Christ Church, in Eston. ==Nearby places== A small brick building next to the Eston Sports Academy has a history unknown to most locals. It was originally the North Riding of Yorkshire's Grangetown Area Control, a communications centre during the Cold War and opened in 1954. The control was closed in 1968 after the Civil Defence Corps was disbanded. In the 1980s the building was not re-used; a room in the Redcar and Cleveland (then Langbaurgh) Town Hall was used instead.Site Name: Eston \u2013 Grangetown Area Control ==Photos of Teesville== File:Eston Hotel Public House.jpg|The Eston Hotel is the only pub in Teesville.
