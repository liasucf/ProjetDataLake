    "text": "Pernis is a genus of birds in the raptor subfamily Perninae. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek pernes \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2, a term used by Aristotle for a bird of prey. It consists of four medium-sized, broad-winged species. * European honey buzzard, Pernis apivorus * Crested honey buzzard, Pernis ptilorhynchus * Barred honey buzzard, Pernis celebensis * Philippine honey buzzard, Pernis steerei They breed in temperate and warmer climates of the Old World, and are specialist feeders on wasp larvae. The two temperate species, the European and crested honey buzzards, are migratory. They breed in woodland, and are often inconspicuous except when displaying. The members of this genus have plumage which mimics that of juvenile common buzzards or of Spizaetus hawk-eagles. It has been suggested that the similarity has arisen as a partial protection against predation by larger raptors such as goshawks, which may be wary about attacking what appears to be a better-protected species with stronger bill and talons than the honey buzzards actually possess. ==Species and subspecies== * European honey buzzard, Pernis apivorus (also called Eurasian honey buzzard) \u2013 migratory: breeding Europe and western Asia, wintering Africa * Crested honey buzzard, Pernis ptilorhynchus (also called eastern or oriental honey-buzzard) ** P. p. orientalis \u2013 migratory: north Asia in winter, India to Indonesia and Philippines in summer ** P. p. ruficollis \u2013 India to Indo-China ** P. p. torquatus \u2013 Indo-Malaya, Sumatra, Borneo ** P. p. ptilorhynchus \u2013 Java ** P. p. palawanensis \u2013 Palawan ** P. p. philippensis \u2013 Philippines * Barred honey buzzard, Pernis celebensis ** P. c. celebensis \u2013 Sulawesi (formerly Celebes) * Philippine honey buzzard, Pernis steerei ** P. s. winkleri \u2013 Luzon island (in The Philippines) ** P. s. steerei \u2013 southern Philippines Comparing sequences from a short subsection of the mitochondrial cytb gene, Gamulf and Haring found five clades: apivorus, steerei\u2013winkleri, celebensis, philippensis\u2013orientalis\u2013ruficollis, and torquatus\u2013ptilorhynchus\u2013palawanensis. They proposed splitting the steerei\u2013winkleri group from P. celebensis into a new species Pernis steerei, but felt that splitting Pernis ptilorhynchus would be \"premature\" given the lack of morphological differences. PDF Despite the name \"crested honey buzzard\", the subspecies P. p. orientalis, P. p. philippensis, and P. p. palawanensis all lack crests. ==References== *British Birds, volume 99, March 2006 *Ferguson-Lees, Christie, Franklin, Mead and Burton Raptors of the World *Gensb\u00f8l, Benny (1989).
