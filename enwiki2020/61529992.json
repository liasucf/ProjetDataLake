The plant communities on the mountain include woodlands, generally below 1000 meters elevation, riverine forests in stream valleys, mid-altitude moist forests between 1000 and 1600 meters elevation, and upland grasslands and rocky shrublands above 1500 meters elevation. Much of the mid-altitude moist forest and riverine forest has been cleared for cultivation, leaving the remaining forests fragmented.Bayliss, J., Monteiro, J., Fishpool, L., Congdon, C., Bampton, I., Bruessow, C., Matimele, H., Banze, A. & Timberlake, J.R.
