While the majority of the tracks tend to sound a little bit generic, the entire album is very singable and congregation-friendly. The artistry and collective effort behind this project are wonderfully manifested throughout the album. Above all, Rain represents the heartbeat and cry of a generation longing for more of God.\" ==Track listing== ==Singles== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=2| Year ! rowspan=2| Single ! colspan=1| Peak chart positions |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! width=48| US Christian Airplay |- | 2019 | align=\"left\"| \"Only Way\" | 48 |} ==References== Category:2019 live albums Category:Planetshakers albums ",
