(2014) Coates is an accomplished church bell change ringer and member of the Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers (ANZAB). He rang his first full peal in 2008, has rung approximately 241 quarter peals and conducted 53. ==Personal== Alan and his twin brother Roger were born on 27 June 1943 at St George's Hospital in Kew, Victoria to parents Thomas and Joan (n\u00e9e Courtney-Pratt) Coates, who had been married the previous year. Younger brother Gordon was born three years later on Boxing Day in the same hospital. On 2 January 1967, Alan married Marylon Slade Bodkin, who was born in Canberra 31 August 1943. They have three children. Also a bellringer and statistician, Marylon Coates is the author of many statistical studies on the incidence and mortality rates from cancer in Australia. In 2015 Coates survived a serious heart attack while at bellringing practice in St Mary's Cathedral and had to be winched down on a stretcher by abseiling rescuers through a trapdoor in the floor of the tower. It was impossible to take him down via the normal route of 120 steps in a narrow circular stairwell. The persistence and skill of his ringing companions, St Mary's Tower Captain Murray-Luke Peard and bellringer Mark Ferguson, were credited with saving his life by immediately administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR. In recognition of this, ANZAB now provides for first-aid and CPR training for two members in each belltower. Coates had suffered a heart attack 15 years previously, when in full academic dress at Sydney University, preparing to participate in a graduation ceremony for medical students. == References == ==External links== * International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG) * St. Gallen Oncology Conferences Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Australian oncologists Category:Melbourne Medical School alumni Category:Bell ringing Category:University of Sydney faculty Category:Members of the Order of Australia Category:People from Melbourne Category:Articles containing video clips ",
