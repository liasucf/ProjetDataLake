    "text": "The Atheist's Wager, popularised by the philosopher Michael Martin and published in his 1990 book Atheism: A Philosophical Justification, is an atheistic response to Pascal's Wager regarding the existence of God. One version of the Atheist's Wager suggests that since a kind and loving god would reward good deeds \u2013 and that if no gods exist, good deeds would still leave a positive legacy \u2013 one should live a good life without religion. Another formulation suggests that a god may reward honest disbelief and punish a dishonest belief in the divine. ==Explanation== The Wager states that if one were to analyze their options in regard to how to live their life, he or she would arrive at the following possibilities: *You may live a good life and believe in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case you go to heaven: your gain is infinite. *You may live a good life without believing in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case you go to heaven: your gain is infinite. *You may live a good life and believe in a god, but no benevolent god exists, in which case you leave a positive legacy to the world; your gain is finite. *You may live a good life without believing in a god, and no benevolent god exists, in which case you leave a positive legacy to the world; your gain is finite. *You may live an evil life and believe in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case you go to hell: your loss is infinite. *You may live an evil life without believing in a god, and a benevolent god exists, in which case you go to hell: your loss is infinite. *You may live an evil life and believe in a god, but no benevolent god exists, in which case you leave a negative legacy to the world; your loss is finite. *You may live an evil life without believing in a god, and no benevolent god exists, in which case you leave a negative legacy to the world; your loss is finite. The following table shows the values assigned to each possible outcome: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto\" !rowspan=2| !colspan=2| A benevolent god exists !colspan=2| No benevolent god exists |- ! Belief in god (B) ! No belief in god (\u00acB) ! Belief in god (B) ! No belief in god (\u00acB) |- ! Good life (L) | +\u221e (heaven) | +\u221e (heaven) | +X (positive legacy) | +X (positive legacy) |- ! Evil life (\u00acL) | \u2212\u221e (hell) | \u2212\u221e (hell) | \u2212X (negative legacy) | \u2212X (negative legacy) |} Given these values, Martin argues that the option to live a good life clearly dominates the option of living an evil life, regardless of belief in a god. ==References== Category:Atheism Category:Philosophical arguments Category:Arguments against the existence of God Category:Philosophy of religion Category:Moral realism ",
