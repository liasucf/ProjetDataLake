As a youngster, Booth\u2019s preferred sports were rugby and football. However, an early indication of his running ability was his performance at the Cumbria Marathon from Cockermouth in 1982 when he was the first junior to finish at the age of fourteen and beat his father Bill Booth. Injuries ended Simon\u2019s focus on rugby and after finishing second in the Borrowdale Fell Race in 1989, his attention turned to fell running.Pete Bland Sports: Simon Booth; Pictorial History of Keswick AC.
