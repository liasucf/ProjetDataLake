Nameplate capacity is the number registered with authorities for classifying the power output of a power station usually expressed in megawatts (MW).Certificate of Nameplate Capacity Ohio Department of Development. Retrieved: 23 September 2010. Power plants with an output consistently near their nameplate capacity have a high capacity factor. ==Dispatchable power== For dispatchable power, this capacity depends on the internal technical capability of the plant to maintain output for a reasonable amount of time (for example, a day), neither momentarily nor permanently, and without considering external events such as lack of fuel or internal events such as maintenance. Actual output can be different from nameplate capacity for a number of reasons depending on equipment and circumstances.Kleiser, Thomas. Response to CDM page 2-4 by T\u00dcV, 4 March 2009. Retrieved: 23 September 2010.Swain, Bibb. Designed to go above Nameplate Capacity Ethanol Producer, November 2006. Retrieved: 23 September 2010. == Non-dispatchable power == For non-dispatchable power, particularly renewable energy, nameplate capacity refers to generation under ideal conditions. Output is generally limited by weather conditions, hydroelectric dam water levels, tidal variations and other outside forces. Equipment failures and maintenance usually contribute less to capacity factor reduction than the innate variation of the power source. In photovoltaics, capacity is rated under Standard Test Conditions usually expressed as watt-peak (Wp). In addition, a PV system's nameplate capacity is sometimes denoted by a subindex, for example, MWDC or MWAC, to identify the raw DC power or converted AC power output. ==Generator capacity== turbo- electric COGES power-plant, with power-consuming pump The term is connected with nameplates on electrical generators as these plates describing the model name and manufacturer usually also contain the rated output,Reitze, Arnold W. Air pollution control law: compliance and enforcement page 260 George Washington University Law School, 2001. , Retrieved: 23 September 2010. but the rated output of a power station to the electrical grid is invariably less than the generator nameplate capacity, because the components connecting the actual generator to the \"grid\" also use power. Thus there is a distinction between component capacity and facility capacity. ==See also== *Availability factor *Declared net capacity (power plants) *Electricity generation *Intermittent power source#Terminology *List of energy storage projects ==References== Category:Power station technology Category:Electric power Category:Electrical generators Category:Energy conversion ",
