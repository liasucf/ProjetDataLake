As one of the leaders of a group of Japanese officers determined to prevent the acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration and therefore the surrender of Japan, Hatanaka attempted a coup d'\u00e9tat on 14\u201315 August 1945. Failing to obtain the support of the War Minister, General Korechika Anami,Toland, 1970, pp. 1023\u20131024 Hatanaka organised a number of other officers and succeeded in occupying the Imperial Palace and Imperial Household Ministry. Still needing high-level support for his cause, he tried to enlist Lieutenant General Takeshi Mori, commander of the 1st Imperial Guard Division. Mori was non-committal and a frustrated Hatanaka shot and killed him.Toland, 1970, pp. 1043 Hatanaka and his men then spent several hours searching for the recording that had been made of the Emperor's speech announcing the surrender of Japan, and which was meant for public broadcast. When he failed to locate the recordings, he occupied the NHK Building in an attempt to prevent the speech from being broadcast. However, still without high level support and the recordings, Hatanaka abandoned his coup after receiving direct orders to do so from Eastern District Army Headquarters.Toland, 1970, pp. 1051 Following the failure of the coup, Hatanaka traveled to the plaza fronting the Imperial Palace. Along with his fellow conspirator, Lieutenant Colonel Jir\u014d Shiizaki, he shot himself. In Hatanaka's pocket was found his death poem:Toland, 1970, p. 1052 {|align=center cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"border:1px solid black; background-color:#e7e8ff;\" |- align=center bgcolor=#d7a8ff |- !Japanese text||Romanized Japanese||English translation |- valign=top | :\u4eca\u306f\u305f\u3060 :\u601d\u3072\u6b98\u3059\u3053\u3068 :\u306a\u304b\u308a\u3051\u308a :\u6697\u96f2\u53bb\u308a\u3057 :\u5fa1\u4e16\u3068\u306a\u308a\u306a\u3070 | :ima wa tada :omoinokosu koto :nakarikeri :an'un sarishi :mi-yo to narinaba | :I have nothing to regret now that the dark clouds have disappeared from the reign of the Emperor. |- |} == See also == * Surrender of Japan == Notes == == References == * Hoyt, Edwin P.
