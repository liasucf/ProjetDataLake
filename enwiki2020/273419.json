    "text": "The Wile Carding Mill is a defunct but still operational carding mill, in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, Canada. The mill is now owned by the Province of Nova Scotia and operated as a museum by the DesBrisay Museum. This water- powered mill was owned and operated by the Wile family from 1860 to 1968. The Wiles ran the mill but employed a number of workers, usually unmarried women, to operate the machinery. The mill was powered by a 7-horsepower (5 kW) overshot waterwheel using the water of Shady Brook, a tributary of the Lahave River. It became a Registered Heritage Property in Bridgewater in 2013. ==See also== *Bridgewater, Nova Scotia *Nova Scotia Museum ==References== Category:Defunct textile companies of Canada Category:Museums in Lunenburg County, Nova Scotia Category:Watermills in Canada Category:Textile museums Category:Technology museums Category:History museums in Nova Scotia Category:Bridgewater, Nova Scotia Category:Nova Scotia Museum ",
