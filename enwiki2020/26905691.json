    "text": "Ng Joo Pong (born 19 June 1946) is a Malaysian cyclist who represented Malaysia at the 1964 and 1968 Summer Olympics and the 1966 Asian Games. His greatest success at a major international was when he was 19 and was chosen to represent Malaysia at the 1966 Asian Games in Bangkok. He won the individual gold medal in the long-distance cycling competition. It was a surprise for the Asian cycling community as virtually no one expected Malaysia to win any medals given Japan's long term domination of the sport in Asia. Even the Malaysian contingent was surprised because they did not expect any medals to come from cycling. As it turned out, cycling was a highlight for Malaysia at the 1966 Asian Games. In addition to Ng's gold, his brother also won a gold medal, and so did another cyclist, Daud Ibrahim, who won a gold medal in the 1,600m cycling event. ==References== Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Malaysian male cyclists Category:Olympic cyclists of Malaysia Category:Cyclists at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 1968 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Kuala Lumpur Category:Asian Games medalists in cycling Category:Cyclists at the 1966 Asian Games Category:Cyclists at the 1970 Asian Games Category:Medalists at the 1970 Asian Games Category:Asian Games bronze medalists for Malaysia ",
