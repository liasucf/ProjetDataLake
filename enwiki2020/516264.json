    "text": "Adios is the eleventh studio album released by German industrial band KMFDM. The album was originally conceived as the group's parting shot to its longtime record label, Wax Trax! Records, but it ended up also signaling the break-up of KMFDM itself until the band reformed in 2002. Recorded in Seattle, Washington, this was the last album to feature En Esch and G\u00fcnter Schulz, who both went on to form Slick Idiot. Following the break-up, founding member Sascha Konietzko created the band MDFMK, before reforming KMFDM in 2002 without Esch or Schulz. The album was released on April 20, 1999, on the same date the Columbine High School massacre took place. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the two perpetrators of the massacre, were both avid KMFDM fans. Eric Harris noted the coincidence of the album's title and release date in his journal.\"heh, get this. KMFDM's new album is entitled \"Adios\" and its release date is in April. how fuckin appropriate, a subliminal final \"Adios\" tribute to Reb and Vodka. thanks KMFDM... I ripped the hell outa the system\" -Eric Harris A Columbine Site Retrieved September 17, 2010 A digitally remastered reissue of Adios was released on May 8, 2007, along with Symbols. ==Background== The 1990s core of KMFDM (Sascha Konietzko, En Esch, and G\u00fcnter Schulz) had reunited for the previous album, Symbols, and toured together along with fellow German industrial metal band Rammstein in 1997. The core line-up was joined on tour by John DeSalvo, Nivek Ogre, and Tim Sk\u00f6ld. Adios was written almost entirely by Konietzko and Sk\u00f6ld, who became an official member for the band's final release with Wax Trax! Records. Schulz, who had done significant writing for the previous five albums, acted only as a studio musician, while Esch helped write only a pair of songs. ==Release date controversy== Adios was released on April 20, 1999, which coincided with the Columbine High School massacre and Adolf Hitler's birthday. Although Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were big fans of the group, KMFDM released an official statement denouncing the violence, sympathizing with the victims and their families, and explaining that the band had no Nazi affiliations whatsoever. ==Reception== Adios received positive reviews. Gina Boldman of Allmusic said of the album: \"KMFDM sound smoother yet maintain their emotive mayhem in all its glory.\" The staff of PopMatters called Adios a \"superb mix of the anarchaic fueled fury of the 80\u2019s and a full awareness of what their genre has become.\" Remarking on the band's then-disbandment, they further stated that KMFDM \"left us with something to remember them by.\" Amy Sciarretto of CMJ New Music Report said that Adios \"continues in the group's grand tradition of techno-informed, industrial-fueled beat manipulation\". She said the beats, guitars, and female vocals formed \"an electrifying chemistry\", concluding, \"Adios is a satisfying sendoff for KMFDM and its legion of fans.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Sascha Konietzko \u2013 vocals (1\u20133, 6\u201310), programming (1\u201310), guitar (10) * Tim Skold \u2013 vocals (1\u20134, 6\u201310), programming (1\u201310), bass (9) * G\u00fcnter Schulz \u2013 guitar (1\u20133, 7, 9, 10) * Cheryl Wilson \u2013 vocals (2, 4, 7\u20139) * En Esch \u2013 hi-hat & cymbals (2), vocals (3, 7, 10), add. programming (7) * Frank Chotai \u2013 add. programming (4) * Paul de Carli \u2013 digital editing (4) * Nina Hagen \u2013 vocals (5, 10) * Nivek Ogre \u2013 vocals (7, 8) * William Rieflin \u2013 programming (8) ==References== ==External links== * KMFDM D\u00d8TK\u00d8M Adios lyrics at the official KMFDM website Category:1999 albums Category:1999 controversies Category:KMFDM albums Category:TVT Records albums Category:Metropolis Records albums Category:Columbine High School massacre Category:Albums produced by Sascha Konietzko ",
