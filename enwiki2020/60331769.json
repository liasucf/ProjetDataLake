    "text": "The Federal Women's Film Program (FWFP) was created in 1980 by the Canadian government as a partnership of federal ministries and agencies to create and distribute films about the status of women. It was administered by Studio D and was in both French and English. Its creation was an attempt to address the \u201cswelling demand for women-centered films and filmmaking opportunities\u201d, as many female freelancers were becoming increasingly frustrated with the dozen staff members employed by Studio D who had the privilege of permanent positions. In 1987, the program was revived by executive producer Rina Fraticelli and was charged with \u201cproducing shorter, basic information films dealing with issues of immediate concern to Canadian women, including domestic violence, reproductive choice, career choice, health care, and aging\u201d. A goal of the program was to direct more of Studio D's funds towards creative endeavours instead of being limited by distribution and other logistical details. The FWFP was associated with Studio D, but not part of its formal budgetary structure. Studio D provided leadership and personnel in developing FWFP, as well as sharing its physical space with the program. The NFB matched funds provided by other federal departments to produce films related to women's issues. Some were internal training films, while others were related to important messages of each department's own goals.:The Federal Women\u2019s Film Program. (1993).

Other FWFP films have discussed nontraditional employment for women, employment for Indigenous women, and employment for disabled women. In 1986, the FWFP funded a film training project through Studio D, extending its mandate to provide training for women filmmakers. == Themes == Themes covered by the FWFP productions are vast and varied, though the program's mandate was to ensure the production of timely films that reflected women's perspectives on current issues facing women and society. Some of the films focussed on issues faced by young people as they assumed increasingly adult responsibilities. Issues explored included representation of women in the fields of math and science, the effects of violence in media on young consumers, and the challenges of unemployment. These documentaries were recommended for secondary school students and were accompanied by interactive guides for classroom participation. Other themes of FWFP productions included domestic abuse and services available to victims and tributes to Indigenous women. == Filmography== === Stand-alone films === *Attention: Women at Work!, 1983.
