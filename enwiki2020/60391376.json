It was held on October 22, 1922, in Est\u00e1dio das Laranjeiras of Rio de Janeiro. At the end of the tournament, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay were tied on points, and playoff matches were planned for the three teams. Nevertheless, Uruguay withdrew after informing the organisers their players had to return home; some noted Uruguay were also dissatisfied with a suspicious performance of the Brazilian referee in their game against Paraguay, which they lost. As a result, only one playoff match was played between Brazil and Paraguay to determine the champion.1922: Un siglo en peque\u00f1as historias by Mart\u00edn Est\u00e9vez on El Gr\u00e1fico, 20151922: Un triple empate que cambi\u00f3 todo on Goal.com Brazil won the match against Paraguay 3\u20130.
