    "text": "Prakash Uttamrao Dahake was a member of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, representing Karanja. He belongs to the Nationalist Congress Party. He defeated the incumbent MLA, Rajendra Patni, by 30,000 votes in the 2009 elections. In the 2014 elections, Rajendra Patni defeated him again for the second time after the 2004 assembly elections. Prakash Dahake could not even get the NCP party ticket despite being the incumbent MLA. He therefore slipped to third place in the 2014 elections. Prakash Dahake lost 4 of the 5 assembly elections he contested and could win only once. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Maharashtra MLAs 2009\u20132014 Category:People from Washim district Category:Nationalist Congress Party politicians from Maharashtra Category:Marathi politicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
