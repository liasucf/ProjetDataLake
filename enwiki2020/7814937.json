    "text": "Henry Ransom Cecil McBay (1914\u20131995) was an American chemist and teacher. ==Family background== McBay was born \"Henry Ransom McBay\" (named from his maternal grandfather, Henry Ransom) on May 29, 1914 in Mexia, Texas. His father, William Cecil McBay, was a barber who eventually became a funeral director; his mother, Roberta Ransom (McBay), was a seamstress. ==Early education and employment== McBay was able to receive a good education because of his proficiency in math. He was able to gain admission to Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, and paid for his education by working in the college's dining-hall and post office. Inspired by his math and chemistry professors, McBay studied organic chemistry and earned his B.S. degree in 1934. His Wiley professors helped him acquire a scholarship to Atlanta to work on his next degree. With only $1.65 in his pocket, McBay immediately took a job in the Atlanta University dining hall so he could eat. After only a few days on campus, his faculty advisor, Professor K. A. Huggins, arranged for him to work in the chemistry laboratory. McBay began to help Huggins study new types of plastics that had properties similar to natural rubber. Soon, McBay was performing his own analysis of the plastics. When the project was finished, he received his master's degree from Atlanta University and Huggins received his doctorate from the University of Chicago. This indirect connection to the University of Chicago would later be important to his career. After earning his master's degree, he returned to Wiley College so he could help his younger brother and sister pay for college. However, going \"home\" proved to be a disappointment. Some faculty members still thought of him as their student and never accepted McBay as an academic peer. Because of his devotion to his siblings, however, he remained at Wiley until his brother received his college degree and his parents were able to pay for his sister's education. But then he died Back in 1938 McBay took a better-paying teaching job at a Quindaro, Kansas junior college. At the end of the first year, he enrolled in the University of Chicago summer school program, where he received good grades for that term. When he returned to Quindaro, he found that the new junior college principal had, for political reasons, hired an instructor in his place. McBay then moved to a high school mathematics teaching position in Huntsville, Texas, where he stayed for three semesters. He then joined a newly formed research team at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama assigned the task of finding a suitable substitute for jute fiber. Indian shipments of jute, which was used for rope and fabrics for sacks, had ended due to World War I. The Tuskegee team hoped to prove that okra stems would be an effective substitute, but McBay proved that by the time an okra plant had matured, the stems were too brittle. Okra could be harvested for food or for fiber, but not for both. Ironically, McBay had worked himself out of a job. He died in 1995. ==Later education== McBay then accepted a teaching assistant's position at the University of Chicago and resumed his doctoral studies. This move also kept him out of the U.S. military: the government needed large numbers of chemistry graduates and was not drafting people in those positions. He demonstrated his love of teaching by designing a chemistry course for first-year college students. In 1944, McBay chose Professor Morris Kharasch as his research advisor. He began to learn very specialized techniques in handling dangerous compounds. McBay began to create highly explosive materials that offered great value as chemical building blocks. He subsequently developed new methods of producing a dangerous compound from hydrogen peroxide. Discoveries by McBay (and Kharasch) allowed chemists around the world to create inexpensive peroxide compounds which are extremely useful as building blocks in many chemical reactions. As a result of that research, McBay received the Elizabeth Norton prize for excellence in chemical research in 1944 and 1945. His dissertation focused on his hydrogen peroxide project, and in 1945 he received his doctoral degree from the University of Chicago. McBay then returned to Atlanta as an assistant professor at Morehouse College in Atlanta. In 1956, he was appointed chairman of the chemistry department. In 1982 he transferred to his old school, Atlanta University, and became the Fuller E. Callaway Professor of Chemistry there. McBay would eventually teach for 41 years in the Atlanta University system (Morehouse, Spelman, and Atlanta). ==Teaching== One of McBay's main goals was to pass along his love for chemistry to his students. He regularly demonstrated how two materials could be combined to produce something with completely different properties. One of his frequent demonstrations combined a metallic poison, sodium, with a gaseous poison, chlorine, to produce table salt. He wanted his students to share his fascination with such processes, which he believed to be minor miracles. In 1951, he developed a chemistry education program in Liberia on behalf of the United Nations Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). ==Honors/Awards== *Norton Prize (for Excellence at Research in Chemistry) at University of Chicago, in 1944. *Norton Prize (for Excellence at Research in Chemistry) at University of Chicago, in 1945. *-- \"E.A.Jones (Edward A.

The main character, \"Moose O'Malley,\" is based on Henry McBay; the town of \"Knox Plains, TX\" is based on Mexia, TX; and \"Rio Vista State College\" is based on Wiley College. Most of the incidents in the book are based on actual events that either happened to Henry directly or he about from others during the time he grew up in Mexia and attended Wiley.)
