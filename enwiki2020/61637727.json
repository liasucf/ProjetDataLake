She made her international debut for Wales at the age of 15 in 2019. ==Early life== Jones was born on 4 September 2003 in Wales to Andrew and Joyce Jones. She grew up in Newtown, Powys and has an older sister, Maia, and a younger brother, Ioan. She attended Newtown High School. == Club career == ===Youth career=== Jones began playing football as a child at her grandmother's farm in Powys with her cousins and spent the majority of her youth career playing in local boys' teams. She joined her first youth side, Newtown White Stars, at the age of seven. She was forced to leave the club after a rule was introduced prohibiting girls from playing in a boys' team until they were 12 years old. This rule was eventually rescinded and Jones resumed playing in boys' sides. She later played for Berriew Junior Boys. ===Cardiff City Ladies=== Jones joined FA Women's National League South team Cardiff City Ladies for the 2019\u201320 season. She made 9 league appearances for the team, scoring three goals. ===Manchester United=== In June 2020, it was announced Jones would be moving to Manchester United to join the club's full-time U21 FA WSL Academy team. == International career == Having previously captained Wales at under-16 and under-17 levels, On 29 August 2019, Jones made her debut for the senior Wales national team as an 83rd minute substitute in place of Emma Jones during a 6\u20130 victory against Faroe Islands in the UEFA Women's Euro 2021 qualifying at the age of 15 years and 359 days. At under 16 years of age, she was noted for making her senior international debut before she was eligible to play in a senior competitive match for her club. Jones had been called up to the senior squad the previous year as an experience building exercise but was ineligible to be selected due to her age. ==Style of play== Following Jones' international debut, former Wales player Gwennan Harries described Jones as \"So composed, got two great feet, but most importantly for me, her work ethic is outstanding, a real team player.\" == Career statistics == === Club === . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |Club ! rowspan=\"2\" |Season ! colspan=\"3\" |League ! colspan=\"2\" |FA Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |League Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Cardiff City Ladies |2019\u201320 |WNL South |9||3||1||0||0||0||10||3 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !9!!3!!1!!0!!0!!0!!10!!3 |} ===International=== :Statistics accurate as of match played 12 November 2019. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" ! colspan=3|Wales |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2019||1||0 |- |2020||0||0 |- !Total||1||0 |} == References == == External links == * Category:2003 births Category:Living people Category:Wales women's international footballers Category:Women's association football midfielders Category:Welsh women's footballers Category:FA Women's National League players Category:Cardiff City Ladies F.C. players ",
