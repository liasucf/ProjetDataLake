    "text": "The Pont Julien (French for Julian Bridge) is a Roman stone arch bridge over the Calavon river, in the south-east of France, dating from 3 BC. The supporting columns are notable for openings to allow floodwater to pass through. It is located in the territory of the commune of Bonnieux, north of the village of the same name, and 8 km west of Apt. Originally, it was built on the Via Domitia, an important Roman road which connected Italy to the Roman territories in France. It was used for car traffic until 2005, when a replacement bridge was built to preserve it from wear and tear. This amounts to approximately 2000 years of uninterrupted use. == Gallery == File:Pont Julien, Provence.jpg|View of the Pont Julien File:Pont Julien, a 3 BC Roman arch bridge over the Calavon river, built on the Via Domitia, France (14715047351).jpg|View of the underside of one of the arches Pont Julien - new road bridge.jpg|The modern bridge crossing the Cavalon upriver of the bridge Bonnieux Pont Julien.jpg|View of the bridge on an old postcard File:Pont Julien, a 3 BC Roman arch bridge over the Calavon river, built on the Via Domitia, France (14531782037).jpg|The dry riverbed of the Calavon and the main arch of the bridge File:Pont Julien in March.jpg|Pont Julien in March ==See also== *List of Roman bridges *Roman architecture *Roman engineering ==References== * * == External links == * * Traianus \u2013 Technical investigation of Roman public works Category:Roman bridges in France Category:Deck arch bridges Category:Stone bridges in France Category:Bridges completed in the 1st century BC Category:Buildings and structures in Vaucluse Category:Transport in Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur Category:Tourist attractions in Vaucluse ",
