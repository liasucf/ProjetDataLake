Additionally, Tartakovsky was a pivotal crew member of The Powerpuff Girls and worked on other series such as 2 Stupid Dogs and Batman: The Animated Series. ==Early life== Tartakovsky was born Gennady Tartakovsky () on 17 January 1970, in Moscow, to Jewish parents. His father worked as a dentist for government officials and the Soviet Union national ice hockey team.Alec Wilkinson, \"MOODY TOONS; The king of the Cartoon Network.\" The New Yorker. ANNALS OF POPULAR CULTURE; p. 76. 27 May 2002. Genndy felt that his father was a very strict and old-fashioned man, but they had a close relationship. His mother, Miriam, was an assistant principal at a school. He has a brother, Alexander, who is two years older and a computer consultant in Chicago. Before coming to the United States, his family moved to Italy. There, Tartakovsky was first drawn to art, inspired by a neighbor's daughter. Tartakovsky later commented, \"I remember, I was horrible at it. For the life of me, I couldn't draw a circle\". Tartakovsky's family moved to the United States when he was sevenSAMURAI JACK.

The family originally settled in Columbus, OhioTim Feran, Samurai Jack Puts Art Back Into Animation. Columbus Dispatch (Ohio).

Tartakovsky began attending Chicago's Eugene Field Elementary School in the third grade. School was difficult because he was seen as a foreigner. He went on to attend Chicago's prestigious Lane Technical College Prep High School and says he did not fit in until his sophomore year. When he was 16, his father died of a heart attack. Afterwards, Genndy and his family moved to government-funded housing, and he began working while still attending high school. To satisfy his ambitious family, which was encouraging him to be a businessman, Tartakovsky tried to take an advertising class, but signed up late and thereby had little choice over his classes. He was assigned to take an animation class and this led to his study of film at Columbia College Chicago before moving to Los Angeles to study animation at the California Institute of the Arts with his friend Rob Renzetti. There he met Craig McCracken. At CalArts, Tartakovsky directed and animated two student films, one of which became the basis for Dexter's Laboratory. After two years at CalArts, Tartakovsky got a job at Lapiz Azul Productions in Spain on Batman: The Animated Series. There, \"he learned the trials of TV animation, labor intensive and cranking it out\". While he was in Spain, his mother died of cancer. ==Career== Craig McCracken acquired an art director job at Hanna- Barbera for the show 2 Stupid Dogs and recommended hiring Rob Renzetti and Tartakovsky as well. This was a major turning point in Tartakovsky's career. Hanna-Barbera let Tartakovsky, McCracken, Renzetti and Paul Rudish work in a trailer in the parking lot of the studio, and there Tartakovsky started creating his best-known works. Dexter's Laboratory grew out of a student film with the same title that he produced while at the California Institute of the Arts. Tartakovsky co-wrote and pencilled the 25th issue of the Dexter's Laboratory comic book series, titled \"Stubble Trouble\", as well as several stories which are collected in the Dexter's Laboratory Classics trade paperback. Additionally, he helped produce The Powerpuff Girls, co-directed several episodes and served as the animation director and a cinematographer for The Powerpuff Girls Movie; he co-wrote one of the franchise's comics. Both Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls were nominated repeatedly for Emmy Awards. Tartakovsky created the action-adventures series Samurai Jack, which premiered in 2001; he also wrote comics for the franchise. The series won him an Emmy in the category of \"Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)\" in 2004. Star Wars creator George Lucas hired Tartakovsky to direct Star Wars: Clone Wars (2003\u20132005), an animated series taking place between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. The series won three Emmy awards: two for \"Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming One Hour or More)\" in 2004 and 2005, and another for \"Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation\" (for background designer Justin Thompson in 2005). Tartakovsky was not involved in the 2008 follow-up series. In 2005, Tartakovsky was appointed creative president of Orphanage Animation Studios.

In 2010, Tartakovsky created storyboards for Jon Favreau's Iron Man 2. He created a new series for Cartoon Network, Sym-Bionic Titan, between 2010 and 2011. He had hoped to expand on the initial season, but it was not renewed. On 7 April 2011, an animated prologue by Tartakovsky for the horror film Priest premiered online.
