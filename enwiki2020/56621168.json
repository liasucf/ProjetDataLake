    "text": "Kevin Alejandro Ceceri (born 2 February 1996) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a left back for Bolivian club Club San Jos\u00e9. ==Career== Ceceri started his Gimnasia y Esgrima senior career in 2016, making his professional debut in the Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n on 10 April during a defeat to Belgrano. That was one of four appearances for Ceceri with Gimnasia y Esgrima in 2016, prior to two more during 2016\u201317. On 4 July 2018, Ceceri completed a move to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B side Linense of Spain. Despite regularly featuring in pre-season friendlies, notably against the likes of C\u00e1diz, C\u00f3rdoba and Mallorca, the defender didn't appear in competitive action; he was an unused substitute for a fixture with UCAM Murcia on 26 August, but his contract was terminated soon after. In June 2019, after a number of months without a club, Ceceri returned to Argentine football with Guillermo Brown of Primera B Nacional. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Gimnasia y Esgrima |2016 |rowspan=\"3|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |4||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||5||0 |- |2016\u201317 |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- |2017\u201318 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !6!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!0!!0!!7!!0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Linense |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1|Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Guillermo Brown |2019\u201310 |rowspan=\"1|Primera B Nacional |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !6!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!7!!0 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Buenos Aires Province Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Bolivian Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata footballers Category:Real Balomp\u00e9dica Linense footballers Category:Guillermo Brown footballers Category:Club San Jos\u00e9 players Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in Bolivia Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Bolivia ",
