    "text": "The Government of Ogun State consists of elected representatives and appointed officials responsible for the government of Ogun State, Nigeria. Ogun State has a population of about 2 million people, and is one of the 36 states that make up the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The state government is composed of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, whose powers are vested by the Constitution in the Governor, the House of Assembly, and the High Court. The judiciary operates independently of the executive and the legislature. At the local level, elected officials are in charge of local government areas. ==Executive== The executive branch is headed by the Governor, assisted by the Deputy Governor, both of whom are elected. The Governor appoints the heads of parastatals, state-owned bodies, judicial officers, permanent secretaries and members of the Executive Council with the exception of the Deputy Governor. The Civil Service is administered by the head of service, a career civil servant, with each ministry managed by a permanent secretary. The commissioner is responsible for policy, while the permanent secretary provides continuity and is responsible for operations. ===Governor=== As the highest ranking official in the executive, the Governor of Ogun State wields significant influence in matters relating to the governance of the state. As in most presidential systems, the Governor is both the head of government and head of state. He or she is empowered by the Constitution to preside over the Executive Council, as well as to appoint, dismiss or reappoint its members\u2013excluding the Deputy Governor\u2013at will. In addition, the Governor may sign legislation passed by the House into law or may veto it; however, if he or she does not make a decision to sign or veto a bill, it automatically becomes law after 30 days. A vote by a two-thirds majority in the House can overrule the governor. The same vote is required to initiate an impeachment process of the Governor or Deputy Governor. If the Governor is unable to discharge his or her duties, the Deputy Governor assumes the office of Acting Governor until the Governor resumes duty, or until election of a new one. ===Deputy Governor=== The position of Deputy Governor of Ogun State constitutes the vice-head of state and government. The position created when the federation returned to civilian authority under the Second Republic. Whoever holds the post is considered the second highest official in the executive branch. He or she is also the first official in line to succeed the Governor, should that office be vacated. The deputy governor is elected concurrently on a ticket with the governor for a term of four years, renewable once. Noimot Salako-Oyedele, an engineer, is the current deputy governor. He was chosen by the governor Dapo Abiodun to be his running mate in the 2019 election. ===Executive Council=== The Executive Council is currently made up of: {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"1\" |Office ! colspan=\"1\" |Incumbent |- |Governor |Dapo Abiodun |- |Deputy Governor |Noimot Salako-Oyedele |- |Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice |Mr. Gbolahan Adeniran |- |Commissioner for Agriculture |Dr. Adeola Odedina |- |Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning |Mr. Olaolu Olabimtan |- |Commissioner for Commerce and Industry |Mrs Kikelomo Longe |- |Commissioner for Community Development and Cooperatives |Hon.
