    "text": "Victoria Codona Adolph (1891\u20131983) was a fourth generation circus performer from the Codonas family. Agents of the Barnum & Bailey Circus came to Mexico in 1909 to recruit her and her younger brothers, Alfredo Codona and Abelardo Codona to perform with them. She worked for Barnum & Bailey until 1918 and also performed in Australia with the Brothers Circus. She was known as Princess Victoria and was a wire-walker. She retired from performing when she was pregnant with her first child with William K. Adolph, a race car driver, and they retired to Palm Springs where she died in 1983 at the age of 92. In 2014, the U.S. Postal Service created a stamp of her as part of an eight stamp collection paying tribute to circus legends of the past. ==References== Category:1891 births Category:1983 deaths Category:Acrobats Category:American circus performers Category:Mexican emigrants to the United States Category:Burials at Inglewood Park Cemetery ",
