It was originally scheduled to take place between 2 and 19 September 2021, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent postponement of the 2020 Summer Olympics to 2021, it has been postponed to 1 to 18 September 2022. Like the previous two editions, the tournament will be co-hosted by four countries. Games in the group stage will be held in Germany, Czech Republic, Georgia and Italy. The knock-out phase will be played in Berlin, Germany. ==Host selection== For EuroBasket 2015 and 2017, FIBA Europe opened three bidding options for hosting: to host a preliminary group, to host the final round, or to host the entire tournament.
