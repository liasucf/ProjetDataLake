    "text": "Sylviornithidae is an extinct family of flightless birds. Traditionally assumed to be within Galliformes, recent phylogenetic studies showcase that they rest outside of the galliform crown-group, making them the most recently lived non-galliform Pangalliformes.Worthy, T., Mitri, M., Handley, W., Lee, M., Anderson, A., Sand, C. 2016. Osteology supports a steam-galliform affinity for the giant extinct flightless birds Sylviornis neocaledoniae (Sylviornithidae, Galloanseres). PLOS ONE. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0150871 For many years it was considered a monotypic family consisting of Sylviornis alone, but recent studies show that Megavitiornis was part of this clade as well. ==References== Category:Extinct flightless birds Category:Late Quaternary prehistoric birds Category:New Caledonia Holocene fauna Category:Holocene extinctions Category:Bird families Category:Galloanserae Category:Taxa named by C\u00e9cile Mourer-Chauvir\u00e9 Category:Taxa named by Jean- Christophe Balouet ",
