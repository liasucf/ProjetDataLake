    "text": "There have been twenty-two United States presidential visits to South Asia by eight United States presidents. The first presidential trip to South Asia (also known as the Indian subcontinent), made by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959, occurred as the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union deepened. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama made multiple trips to the region while in office. To date, eight visits have been made to Afghanistan and India, five have been made to Pakistan, and one to Bangladesh. No incumbent president has yet visited Bhutan (which has no formal diplomatic relations with the U.S.), the Maldives, Nepal, or Sri Lanka.
