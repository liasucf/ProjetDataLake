    "text": "The Medium is an upcoming psychological horror video game developed by Bloober Team, scheduled to be released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox Series X/S on 10 December 2020. ==Gameplay== A puzzle is solved between realities, unveiling a spirit well. The Medium is a psychological horror game played in third-person as Marianne, a medium who can travel into the spirit realm. Being able to inhabit both worlds aids puzzle solving. Her psychic abilities may also be used against hostile forces and are recharged by interacting with energy spots called spirit wells. ==Development and release== The Medium is developed by Bloober Team, who came up with the idea in 2012. Bloober meant to enhance the immersion by changing their traditional perspective from first- to third- person and taking advantage of Xbox Series X/S's background streaming. They modelled the supernatural setting after Zdzis\u0142aw Beksi\u0144ski's dystopian surrealist artwork. Lead designer Wojciech Piejko said The Medium imparts the message that \"there is no universal truth\". Composers Arkadiusz Reikowski and Akira Yamaoka were tasked with scoring the physical and spiritual plane, respectively. Using synthesiser and analogue sounds, Reikowski likened his approach to that of Stranger Things and Chernobyl. Yamaoka worked on the Silent Hill franchise, which inspired the game, including its fixed camera angles. He was persuaded to take on the music when Piejko gave him a gameplay demonstration. Singer Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, also of Silent Hill fame, will contribute vocals. Troy Baker voices the primary antagonist, known as the Maw, for whom another actor performed the motion capture on stilts. The Medium was originally announced for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii U in 2012, but for want of better technology, reappeared in May 2020 as a Microsoft Windows and Xbox Series X/S title, scheduled to be released on 10 December 2020. ==Awards== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
