    "text": "London Belongs to Me (also known as Dulcimer Street) is a British film released in 1948, directed by Sidney Gilliat, and starring Richard Attenborough and Alastair Sim. It was based on the novel London Belongs to Me by Norman Collins, which was also the basis for a seven-part series made by Thames Television and shown in 1977. ==Plot== The film concerns the residents of a large terraced house in London between Christmas 1938 and September 1939. Among them are the landlady, Mrs Vizzard (played by Joyce Carey), who is a widow and a believer in spiritualism; Mrs Josser (Fay Compton), Mr Josser (Wylie Watson) and their teenage daughter (Susan Shaw); the eccentric spiritualist medium Mr Squales (Sim); the colourful Connie Coke (Ivy St. Helier), the young motor mechanic Percy Boon (Attenborough) and his mother (Gladys Henson). Percy is in love with the Jossers' daughter and turns to crime to raise money to impress her with, but he bungles a car theft and finds himself accused of murder. Mr Josser digs into his retirement fund to hire the boy a lawyer. Mr Squales testifies against Percy, but in the process exposes to his fianc\u00e9e Mrs Vizzard the falsity of his claims to be able to contact the dead and to predict the future. Percy is found guilty, but his neighbours rally to his defence. With the assistance of Mr Josser's staunchly socialist Uncle Henry (Stephen Murray), they gather thousands of signatures on a petition to win him a reprieve. At the end of the film, Percy's supporters march through the rain to Parliament, only to discover just before their arrival that clemency has already been granted. ==Cast== * Richard Attenborough as Percy Boon * Alastair Sim as Mr Squales * Fay Compton as Mrs Josser * Stephen Murray as Uncle Henry * Wylie Watson as Mr Josser * Susan Shaw as Doris Josser * Joyce Carey as Mrs Kitty Vizzard * Ivy St. Helier as Connie Coke * Andrew Crawford as Bill * Hugh Griffith as Headlam Fynne * Eleanor Summerfield as Myrna Watson * Gladys Henson as Mrs Boon * Maurice Denham as Jack Rufus * Ivor Barnard as Mr Justice Plymme * Cecil Trouncer as Mr Henry Wassall * Arthur Howard as Mr Chinkwell * John Salew as Mr Barks * Cyril Chamberlain as Detective Sergeant Wilson * Aubrey Dexter as Mr Battlebury * Jack McNaughton as Jimmy * Henry Hewitt as Verriter * Fabia Drake as Mrs Jan Byl * Sydney Tafler as Nightclub Receptionist * Henry Edwards as Police Superintendent * George Cross (English actor)|George Cross as Inspector Cartwright * Edward Evans as Detective Sergeant Taylor * Russell Waters as Clerk of the Court * Kenneth Downey as Mr Veezey Blaize, KC * Basil Cunard as Foreman of the Jury * Wensley Pithey as First Warden * Manville Tarrant as Second Warden * Leo Genn as narrator ==Production== Filming started 6 November.
