He was interested in conditions of prisons in Georgian jails, but it was difficult to make a film into the prison. \"The only way to get permission to film inside was through the churches in the jails, and Gogita was one of the guys coming to the church in the jail.\" Levan did a pouse and made his second fiction feature - Blind Dates. After its success he continued working on this documentary. \"I became part of their relationship\", said the director about his closeness to the film's protagonists - Gogita and Maka. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2016 films Category:2016 documentary films Category:Films from Georgia (country) Category:Documentary films from Georgia (country) Category:Georgian-language films Category:2010s documentary film stubs ",
