    "text": "RS-102221 is a drug developed by Hoffmann\u2013La Roche, which was one of the first compounds discovered that acts as a potent and selective antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor, with around 100x selectivity over the closely related 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors. It has anxiolytic effects in animal studies, increases the effectiveness of SSRI antidepressants, and shows a complex interaction with cocaine, increasing some effects but decreasing others, reflecting a role for the 5-HT2C receptor in regulation of the dopamine signalling system in the brain. == See also == * CEPC * SB-242084 *Hydantoin == References == Category:5-HT2C antagonists Category:Imides Category:Ureas Category:Lactams Category:Nitrogen heterocycles Category:Aromatic ketones Category:Phenol ethers Category:Trifluoromethyl compounds Category:Spiro compounds Category:Sulfonamides Category:Hydantoins ",
