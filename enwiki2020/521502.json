In 1904, the government's leaf monopoly was extended to a complete takeover of all tobacco business operations in the nation, including all manufactured tobacco products such as cigarettes. The ostensible reason for the expansion of control was to help fund the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese War, but because all foreign tobacco interests in Japan at the time were forcibly evicted under the monopolization scheme, this also protected the domestic tobacco business for over eighty years.Levin, Mark, Smoke Around the Rising Sun: An American Look at Tobacco Regulation in Japan.

Poster gallery ==Environmental record== In 2008, Japan Tobacco had health issues involving their company: Contaminated gyoza dumplings made by a Chinese company's factory in China, which sold its products to JT, poisoned ten people, including a five-year-old girl. Thousands of other Japanese people were going to the hospital because of stomach issues as well. A number of dumplings were found containing dichlorvos and methamidophos from pesticide. The health minister of Japan said the contamination at the Chinese factory was possibly intentional, and the police are investigating for an attempted homicide. The dumplings were from China, but Japan Tobacco has said it does not plan to cease its manufacturing in China. Frozen food sales went down by 60% for the business since this health scare. Japan Tobacco's stock price fell 7.1% after they were forced to recall their products, and the company also lost a $500 million merger deal with Nissin Foods because of this incident. == Anti-Illicit Trade Compliance == Japan Tobacco Inc, through its international operating divisions JT International S.A. and JT International Holding BV, signed a Cooperation Agreement with the European Commission in 2007 to combat the illicit trade in cigarettes under Article 9 of which the company agreed to \"pro-actively disclose\" to the European Commission\u2019s Anti-Fraud Office (Office Europeen de Lutte Antifraude \u2013 OLAF) \"\u2026all material information coming into (its) possession after the Execution Date relating to potentially Illegal Product.\" The Agreement defines \"Illegal Product\" as Contraband or Counterfeit Cigarettes. Both Japan Tobacco Inc and JT International S.A. claim to adhere to a \"zero-tolerance approach\" to illicit trade. JT International S.A. and several of its distributors, including Megapolis in Russia and IBCS Trading in Cyprus, however, have been implicated as recently as 2011 in widespread smuggling to include selling cigarettes to a buyer in Syria subject to EU, Swiss, and US Sanctions and diverting cigarettes from Russia into the European Union and smuggling Winston and other popular cigarette brands into Iran. A JT International S.A. executive told the Wall Street Journal in August 2012 that the firm had continued to ship cigarettes to Syria until as recently as February 2012, almost a full year after the imposition of EU and US sanctions. The Journal cited Syrian dissident sources who claimed that the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad uses cigarettes as payment for the irregular military forces and militias, known as the shabeeha, who have had a central role in its violent crackdown. Company documents show that in 2010 the head of the JT International SA security office \u2013 who performed a similar function at the former Gallaher Group PLC \u2013 sought to destroy evidence linking up to 13 company officers to smugglers in the Balkans region; a parallel effort was then being run by company management to hack into the emails of company anti- smuggling investigators, competitors, and law enforcement. The firm also announced in 2011 that it had purchased the largest cigarette producer in Sudan and South Sudan as part of an effort to expand sales in the war-torn region, which has emerged as an entrepot for cigarette smuggling. ==Sponsorships== * Galan Slim Loud & Vote Back To 80's * Galan Slim Rock Your City * Golf Nippon Series JT Cup (1998 \u2013 present) * Mild Seven Tennis WTA Championships * Mild Seven Outdoor Quest * Mild Seven Millennium Countdown (31 December 1999 \u2013 1 January 2000) * Mild Seven(2012-2013 March) Benson & Hedges (2013 \u2013 present) a Pobol y Cwm Welsh Language Drama * Wismilak Diplomat Success Challenge IDR 500.000.000 (2010, 2011, and 2012-2017 not together again Wismilak in Japan Tobacco since 2011-2016). * Wismilak International Tennis WTA Championships * Wismilak Slim Bolaria * Gudang Garam Intersport Worldstage (2015\u2013present) * Suryanation Motorland (2015\u2013present) ==See also== *Tobacco industry *Japan Tobacco International *JT Marvelous *Smoking in Japan *Onshino Tabako ==References== ==External links== *Japan Tobacco official website *Japan Tobacco official website *The Tobacco and Salt Museum * Tobacco and Salt Museum at Google Cultural Institute Category:Manufacturing companies based in Tokyo Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1985 Category:Companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Category:Companies listed on the Osaka Exchange Category:Multinational companies headquartered in Japan Category:Tobacco companies of Japan Category:Japanese companies established in 1985 ",
