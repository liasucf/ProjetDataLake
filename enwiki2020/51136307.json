    "text": "Oscillatoria willei is a species of bacteria that is able to photosynthesize to make food, similarly to plants. ==Anatomy== Bacteria of the genus Oscillatoria occur in rows of cells of similar size. They form filaments called trichomes. Many trichomes are enveloped in a firm casing, but in this genus the casing is almost non-existent. This gives the filaments easier mobility in all directions. ==Nitrogen fixing ability== This species of Oscillatoria is able to fix nitrogen, but unlike other bacteria, it is uncertain whether or not it has cells specialized for that particular purpose. ==Hormogonia== Fragments of filaments of Oscillatoria willei are called hormogonia. They consist of dozens of cells, which sometimes break off to reproduce by establishing new colonies. ==Danger to Humans== Like all species of Oscillatoria, this species can cause skin irritation in humans who come in close contact with them in the tropics.Ocean, American Museum of Natural History, 2015 ==References== Category:Oscillatoriales ",
