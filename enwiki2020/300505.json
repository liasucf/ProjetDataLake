    "text": "Scaramuccia in 1860 Scaramouche or Scaramouch (from Italian scaramuccia, literally \"little skirmisher\") is a stock clown character of the 16th-century commedia dell'arte (comic theatrical arts of Italian literature). The role combined characteristics of the Zanni (servant) and the Capitano (masked henchman), with some assortment of villainous traits. Usually attired in black Spanish dress and burlesquing a Don, he was often beaten by Harlequin for his boasting and cowardice. ==History== Although Tiberio Fiorillo (1608\u20131694) was not the first to play the role, he greatly developed and popularized it. He removed the mask, used white powder on his face, and employed grimaces. He had a small beard, long mustache, and wore a predominantly black costume with a white ruff. In France he became known as scaramouche.Hartnoll 1983, pp. 282 (\"Fiorillo, Tiberio\"), 735 (\"Scaramuccia\"). Portrait of Tiberio Fiorilli as Scaramouche by Pietro Paolini In the 19th century the English actor Joseph Grimaldi and his son J. S. Grimaldi made numerous appearances as Scaramouche. ==Character== Scaramouche entertains the audience by his \"grimaces and affected language\". Salvator Rosa says that Coviello (like Scaramouche) is \"sly, adroit, supple, and conceited\". In Moli\u00e8re's The Bourgeois Gentleman, Coviello disguises his master as a Turk and pretends to speak Turkish. Both Scaramouche and Coviello can be clever or stupid\u2014as the actor sees fit to portray him. In Blaise Pascal's Pens\u00e8es Section 1 Article 12, Scaramouche is described as a person \"who only thinks of one thing. The doctor, who speaks for a quarter of an hour after he has said everything, so full is he of the desire of talking.\" ==In puppetry== Scaramouche is one of the great characters in the Punch and Judy puppet shows (a performative art with roots in commedia dell'arte). In some scenarios, he is the owner of The Dog, another stock character. During performances, Punch frequently strikes Scaramouche, causing his head to come off his shoulders. Because of this, the term scaramouche has become associated with a class of puppets with extendable necks. ==Scaramouche in popular culture== J. S.
