    "text": "In art, symbolic language refers to the use of characters or images to represent concepts. Symbolic language in art uses imagery to communicate meaning by displaying an accessible concept, the signifier, to represent a signified concept. Symbolic language in art may be used figuratively, to reference ideas and \"convey concepts in terms of images\", as when images and positioning of objects such as flowers or animals are used to signify cultural concepts. . Symbolic language in art may be used more literally, as in floriography, where arrangements of flowers are decoded with the help of special dictionaries, enabling communication of secret, unspoken information as a form of cryptography. Similarly, in religious iconography, symbolic languages may be developed to communicate between believers in a hostile environment, with progressive teachings providing increasing access to hidden meanings in the images. ==See also== *Icon *Ineffability *Petroglyph *Saint symbolism *Semiotics *Symbolic language (other) *Symbolism (arts) *Yerkish lexigrams ==References== ==External links== *Bach's Symbolic Language - JSTOR *Beyond Words: The Symbolic Logic of Plants - Delaware Art Museum *In Defense of Symbolic Aesthetics - JSTOR *The Language of Flowers - Philadelphia Museum of Art *Saints, Signs, and Symbols: The Symbolic Language of Christian Art *The Symbolical Language of Ancient Art and Mythology: An Inquiry - Cornell University Category:Iconography Category:Language Category:Visual arts ",
