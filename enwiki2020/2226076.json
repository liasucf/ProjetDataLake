Ballarat Health Services employs approximately 4000 staff at the Base Hospital, the Queen Elizabeth Centre 1 km to the south-west, and 13 off-site facilities in the surrounding area. ==History== During the gold rush of the 1850s, the Government Camp provided medical support but mainly for officers and not for miners and the general community. Those wounded at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 received varying attention and the need for a hospital became apparent. A year later building of a hospital commenced. The five storey Henry Bolte wing, designed by architects Bates Smart was completed in 1994. In 1997, the Ballarat Base Hospital merged with the Queen Elizabeth Centre and the Grampians Psychiatric Service to form Ballarat Health Services. ==Specialties== *Cardiology *Emergency medicine *Gastroenterology *Infectious disease medicine *Lower gastrointestinal surgery *Nephrology *Otorhinolaryngology *Upper gastrointestinal surgery *Vascular surgery *Oncology *Pediatrics ==See also== *List of hospitals in Australia ==Notes== == Further reading == *Hyslop, Anthea, Sovereign Remedies: A History of Ballarat Base Hospital, 1850s-1980s, Allen & Unwin, Sydney, 1989 *Menadue, H.
