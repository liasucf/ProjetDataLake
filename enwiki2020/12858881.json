Duke William of Normandy demanded the release of the earl, and Count Guy delivered Harold Godwinson up after being paid a ransom for him. ==Population== ==Views== The countryside at Beaurainville ==See also== * Communes of the Pas-de-Calais department ==References== * INSEE commune file Category:Communes of Pas-de- Calais ",
