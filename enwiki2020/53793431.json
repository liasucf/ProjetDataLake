In addition to its naval role it was also deployed as coastal artillery. ==History== The Canon de 100 mm Mod\u00e8le 1891 was French naval gun designed by the French designer Gustave Canet and produced at Schneider et Cie of Le Creusot in 1889. Five models of varying length were produced: Mod\u00e8le 1891, Mod\u00e8le 1892, Mod\u00e8le 1893, Mod\u00e8le 1895 and Mod\u00e8le 1897. At some point in the guns development there was a switch from Separate loading QF ammunition to Fixed QF ammunition. However the dimensions of the guns and their performance stayed largely the same. ==Construction== The Mod\u00e8le 1891 was constructed of an A tube, with a Canet screw breech which screwed onto the A tube. There was also a jacket and three layers of reinforcing hoops which all screwed into the breech. ==Coastal Artillery== In addition to their naval role this family of guns was also used as coastal artillery by France and Poland. In French service there were two main models the Canon de 100 mm Mod\u00e8le 1889 T97 and Canon de 100 mm Mod\u00e8le 1897 T97. Poland also had two Mod\u00e8le 1891 guns in service as coastal artillery under the designation Canet 100 mm wz. 1891. The two Polish guns were purchased in March 1924 with a French loan to rearm the Polish army. They were intended to arm two ex-Russian Filin-class gunboats purchased from Finland the ORP General Haller and ORP Komendant Pilsudski. However it was found that the guns were too heavy for the ships and two Russian made Canet 75mm 50 caliber Pattern 1892 were fitted instead. In 1932 the two guns formed the 13th coastal artillery battery was created at Oksywie to defend the approaches to the Port of Gdynia. In September 1939 the captain of the battery was Capt. Art. Antoni Ratajczyk and his deputy was Mar. Stanislaw Brychcy. One of the guns was knocked out of action on the first day of fighting, while second gun fired over a hundred rounds before being captured. ==Naval Use== Canon de 100 mm Mod\u00e8le 1891 guns armed a variety of ships such as armored cruisers, coastal defense ships, destroyers, gunboats, minesweepers, pre-dreadnought battleships, protected cruisers and seaplane tenders of the French, Bulgarian, Haitian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian and Turkish navies.
