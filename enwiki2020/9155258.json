With Brooke Castile, he is the 2008 Four Continents bronze medalist, 2007 Nebelhorn Trophy champion, and 2007 U.S. national champion. == Personal life == Benjamin Okolski was born in Tucson, Arizona. He initially studied engineering at Washtenaw Community College. After obtaining a master's degree in accounting from the University of Michigan, he became an auditor at Deloitte. == Career == Okolski began skating at age eight and began pairs at twelve with his sister, Colleen. He teamed up with Brooke Castile after the 2002 U.S. Championships. They won two bronze medals on the ISU Junior Grand Prix series. They placed 7th at their first Four Continents in 2005. Following the 2006 U.S. Championships, Castile and Okolski changed coaches to Johnny Johns and Marina Zueva at the Arctic Figure Skating Club in Canton, Michigan. They won the 2007 U.S. Championships, earning them the right to compete at 2007 Four Continents, where they were 5th, and then to make their World debut, where they finished 12th. In the 2007\u201308 season, Castile and Okolski were assigned to 2007 Nebelhorn Trophy, 2007 Skate America, and 2007 Troph\u00e9e Eric Bompard, but withdrew from all three due to injury. They won bronze at the 2008 U.S. Championships and went on to win a bronze medal in their third Four Continents appearance. They finished 11th at their second World Championships. In 2008\u201309, they also withdrew from their Grand Prix assignments, 2008 Cup of China and 2008 Cup of Russia, due to injury. They finished 5th at the 2009 U.S. Championships. In the 2009\u201310 season, Castile and Okolski were 6th at 2009 Skate America. Their 4th-place finish at the 2010 U.S. Championships meant they did not make the U.S. team to the 2010 Winter Olympics. They announced their retirement from competitive skating in May 2010. == Programs == (with Castile) {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Season ! Short program !
