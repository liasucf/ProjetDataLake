    "text": "Granollers () is a city in central Catalonia, about 30 kilometers northeast of Barcelona. It is the capital and most densely populated city of the comarca of Vall\u00e8s Oriental. Granollers is now a bustling business centre, having grown from a town dominated by Catalonia's textile industry that was so prominent during the 19th Century. However, in the southern portion of the municipality, the Palou area retains the agricultural characteristics of the past. Granollers forms a conurbation with Canovelles, Les Franqueses del Vall\u00e8s and the neighbourhood of La Torreta in La Roca del Vall\u00e8s. The city is crossed by the Congost river, a tributary of the Bes\u00f2s river. It is considered to be situated in the second crown of the Barcelona metropolitan area. It is around 25 km north-east of the centre of Barcelona. ==Notable landmarks== La Porxada, a Renaissance building which served as a grain storehouse, is an emblematic building. On Corr\u00f3 street, there is the ancient hospital of Sant Dom\u00e8nec, now the Francesc Tarafa theatre, a good example of restored Gothic architecture. The church of Sant Esteve in the city centre, also contains Gothic elements from the 15th Century along with an octagonal tower. ==Notable natives and residents== * King Peter V of Aragon died in Granollers * Gerard L\u00f3pez, football player for Barcelona and Spain, born in Granollers * Jordi L\u00f3pez, footballer, born in Granollers * Marc Valiente, footballer, born in Granollers * Aleix Espargar\u00f3, motorcycle racer, born in Granollers * Pol Espargar\u00f3, motorcycle racer, born in Granollers * Abraham Minero, footballer * Jordi Benito, artist, born in Granollers * Dani Mateo, TV host, journalist and comedian, born in Granollers. ==References== * Panareda Clop\u00e9s, Josep Maria; Rios Calvet, Jaume; Rabella Vives, Josep Maria (1989).
