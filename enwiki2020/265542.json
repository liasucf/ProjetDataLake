The first specimen of Turkish coal was brought from Ere\u011fli to Istanbul in 1822, but nothing was done for exploration and exploitation of this coal. However, in 1829, another specimen of coal was brought to Istanbul by Uzun (Long) Mehmet, a sailor and native of the village of Kestaneci, near Ere\u011fli. This time attention was given to the discovery and the sailor received a reward of a life pension, but before he could benefit from this reward he was murdered. The first miners requested and delivered from the Austrian Government are the Austrian Croats known to have been employed in the Ere\u011fli Coal Mines. The correspondence between Istanbul and the embassy in Vienna show that coal production in the Ere\u011fli Basin predates the March 1837 request by 18 months and that production started around September 1835.History Of Zonguldak (tr) An investigation of Hazine-i Hassa (Ottoman Imperial Treasury Department) records in the Ottoman archives shows that regular mining activities in the Ere\u011fli Basin started in February 1841. This is confirmed by a newspaper article published in the 14 February 1841 issue of Ceride-i Havadis. Ere\u011fli Coal Company, chartered by six partners (Ahmed Fethi Pasha, R\u0131za Pasha, Safveti Pasha, Tahir Bey Efendi, Izzet Pasha and Mustafa Efendi), excavated the coal in the Ere\u011fli Coal Basin, initially under the auspices of Darphane-i Amire and later transferred to Hazine-i Hassa when the latter was established in 1849.Zonguldak Province (tr) ===Timeline of the administration of the Ere\u011fli coal mines after 1845=== *1848-1854 Administration by Hazine-i Hassa *1849-1854 English (and Galata goldsmiths) Coal Company\u2019s Management *1854-1856 Temporary administration by the English during the Crimean war *1856-1861 Administration by Hazine-i Hassa *1856-1859 Operated by Trust Administration *1859-1860 Operated by Zafiropulos *1860-1861 Operated by the English Coal Company *1861-1865 Administration by Hazine-i Hassa *1865-1908 Administered by the Ministry of Navy *1865-1882 Operated by Shipbuilding Administration *1882-1940 Operated by local and foreign capital companies *1908-1909 Administered by Nafia Nezareti (Ministry of Public Works) *1909-1920 Administered by the Ministry of Forestry, Agriculture and Mineral Trade *1914-1922 Period of World War I and the National Liberation War *1920-1940 Administered by the Ministry of Economics *1926-1940 Operated by T\u00fcrkiye \u0130\u015f Bankas\u0131 (Ankara) *1937-1940 Operated by ETIBANK (Ankara) and EKI *1940-1957 Administered by ETIBANK and EKI (Ere\u011fli Komurleri Isletmesi - Zonguldak) *1957-1984 Administered by TKI (Ankara) *1984\u2013present Administered by TTK (Turkiye Ta\u015fkomuru Kurumu - Zonguldak) In 1851, the Company\u2019s production fields are mentioned in the accounting records as \"coal mines administered by the Company under the irade-i seniyye in Ere\u011fli, Amasra and various places\". \"Various places\" mentioned in the records are not known for sure. Records of the period after the Sultan\u2019s participation in the firm mention \"coal mines administered by the Company in Bezekli, Amasra, Karaburun areas and various places\". (The name Zonguldak did not yet exist in 1851.) After 1865, one of these \"various places\" is named as Zone-Goul-Dagh or Zon- Goul-Dak, with mixed Turkish-French pronunciation.
