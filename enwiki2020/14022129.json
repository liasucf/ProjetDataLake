    "text": "A contemporary imagining of Tylwyth Teg ' (Middle Welsh for \"Fair Family\"; ) is the most usual term in Wales for the mythological creatures corresponding to the fairy folk of English and Continental folklore and the Irish . Other names for them include ' (\"Blessing of the Mothers\"), ' and '. ==Origins== The term is first attested in a poem attributed to the 14th-century , in which the principal character gets perilously but comically lost while going to visit his girlfriend: \"\" (\"(The) weak enchantment (now) flees, / (the) long burden of the Tylwyth Teg (departs) into the mist\"). ==Attributes== In later sources the are described as fair-haired and covet golden-haired human children whom they kidnap, leaving changelings (or , ) in their place. They dance and make fairy rings and they live underground or under the water. They bestow riches on those they favour but these gifts vanish if they are spoken of, and fairy maidens may become the wives of human men. These fairy wives are however still bound by traditional taboos. They must be careful to avoid touching iron or they will vanish back to their realm never to be seen by their husbands again. As the they are sometimes described as stunted and ugly. They ride horses in fairy rades (processions) and visit houses where bowls of milk are customarily put out for them. A changeling story tells of a woman whose three-year-old son was stolen by the fairies and she was given a threefold instruction by a \"cunning man\" (magician) on how to get him back. She removed the top from a raw egg and began stirring the contents, and as the changeling watched her do this certain comments he made established his otherworldly identity. She then went to a crossroads at midnight during the full moon and observed a fairy rade in order to confirm that her son was with them. Lastly she obtained a black hen and without plucking it she roasted it over a wood fire until every feather dropped off. The changeling then disappeared and her son was returned to her. According to the folklorist Wirt Sikes the may be divided into five general types: the (elves), the (fairies of the mines), the (household fairies similar to brownies), the (female fairies of the lakes and streams) and the (mountain fairies more akin to hags). The (singular ) inhabit groves and valleys and are similar to English elves. Their food consists of toadstools and fairy butter (a type of fungus) and they wear digitalis bell flowers as gloves. They are ruled by Queen Mab and bring prosperity to those they favour. == In popular culture == A human man brought before the Fairy King.
