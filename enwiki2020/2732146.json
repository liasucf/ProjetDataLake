The series was officially launched in 1999, with the models 2.0 GSI, and choices of gasoline, diesel or LPG power, followed by the limited edition SE 2.7 V6, in 2001. Sales began in South Korea in April 1999, and the vehicle arrived to Europe in March 2000. The premiere for the United Kingdom was at the London Motorfair, in October 1999. ==Overview== Hyundai Trajet (rear) 2007 Hyundai Trajet 2007 Hyundai Trajet (rear) The models of the Trajet have three rows of seats. A variety of seating configurations allows for extra luggage space, and the seats can be removed to accommodate larger items. The front seats can rotate through 180 degrees to face the passengers at the back when the car is stationary, and the back seats can also be turned into tables, making a virtual office space, or picnic area. Hyundai stated that Hyundai Starex is not the Trajet's successor, because the Grand Starex is not a minivan. The Kia based Entourage is the closest thing to direct successor, but it is only available in limited number of markets. The Trajet competed in the same market segment as the Kia Carnival and Toyota Sienna. Standard equipment for the 2.0 GSI and 2.0 CRTD GSI (diesel version) included driver, passenger and side airbags, ABS with EBD, power steering, seat belt pre tensioners, front and rear air conditioning, electric front and rear windows, stereo RDS radio/CD unit, double folding second and third row seats (the second and third row seats are removable), and sliding outer seats on second row. The price range for the Trajet, for the market in the United Kingdom, started at \u00a315,495 for the manual 2.0 GSI, rising to \u00a318,345 for the 2.0 CRTD SE Automatic. With around \u00a32,400 worth of extra equipment, for only \u00a31,000 more than the cost of the 2.0 GSI, however, the Trajet SE came with its own DVD player, privacy glass, SmartNav satellite navigation, and reversing sensors as standard. It was available with gasoline or diesel engines, and manual or automatic transmissions, with prices starting at \u00a316,495. With the launch of the SE 2.7 V6, all previous models, of the Trajet, were upgraded. The gasoline 2.0 GSI benefited from the engine CVVT, which was previously seen in the Coupe, increasing power from 133 to 139 bhp (99 to 104 kW), while CO2 emissions fell from 223 g/km to 208 g/km. Fuel consumption was also improved \u2014 the combined figure (average consumption on town and highway driving) rose from 30.4 mpg to 32.5 mpg, imperial gallons (9.3 to 8.7 L/100 km). All Trajets from this point forward featured a third three point seat belt in the rear, which meant all passengers had the protection of a full seat belt. Additionally, the car came with a full five year unlimited mileage warranty, which was transferable between owners. Production ended in the beginning of 2008. == See also == * Kia Carnival * Hyundai Entourage * Kia Carens == References == == External links == * http://www.testdriven.co.uk/news.cfm/hyundai_trajet_now_with_more_kit * https://web.archive.org/web/20041113114104/http://www.parkers.co.uk/choosing/carreviews/printview.aspx?model_id=368 * http://www.hyundai-car.co.uk/choose/trajet/technical/ Trajet Category:Minivans Category:Euro NCAP large MPVs Category:Cars introduced in 1999 Category:2000s cars ",
