    "text": "\"My Side of Town\" is a 1997 song recorded by American singer Lutricia McNeal from her album of the same name. The song was released as the follow-up single to her 1996 international hit \"Ain't That Just the Way\". Although not as successful as her previous hit, \"My Side of Town\" managed to chart within the top 40 on the charts of Iceland, the Netherlands and Sweden, and it reached number one in New Zealand in 1999. ==Critical reception== AllMusic editor Jaime Sunao Ikeda picked \"My Side of Town\" as one of two standout tracks on the album. ==Chart performance== \"My Side of Town\" did not match the chart success of \"Ain't That Just the Way\" in Europe, but it managed to reach number 17 in the Netherlands, number 30 in Sweden, number 31 in Iceland, and number 73 in Germany. It did not chart in the United Kingdom, where \"Ain't That Just the Way\" peaked at number four, but her success in the UK would continue with \"Stranded\". In 1998, McNeal's music began to gain popularity in New Zealand, with two hits, \"Ain't That Just the Way\" and \"Stranded\", reaching the top three. \"My Side of Town\" followed these hits and proved to be just as successful. It first appeared on the Recorded Music NZ (then RIANZ) chart at number 43 on January 24, 1999, then reached number 7 three weeks later. It dropped out of the top 10 for the next three weeks, then rose 12 places to the number-one position on March 14. \"My Side of Town\" dropped to number 19 the next week, then spent three more weeks in the top 50 before leaving the chart, its last appearance at number 29 on April 11. Despite its success, this song was McNeal's last substantial hit in that country. ==Music video== Two different music videos were made for the song. One of them was directed by Stuart Gosling. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1997\u20131999) !Peak position |- |- |- |Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |align=\"center\"|31 |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1997) !Position |- |Romania (Romanian Top 100) |align=\"center\"|92 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 singles Category:1997 songs Category:Dance-pop songs Category:Number-one singles in New Zealand ",
