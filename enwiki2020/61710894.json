Opacic attended Bournemouth University, studying geography. In 2006, at the age of 18, and having already won the Junior Championship, she was unable to represent her league team when they had a match against Netley Central social club, as women were not allowed to play there. Eight months later, the Club overturned its ban on women playing. Opacic took a break of four years from competition, mainly due to studying for a Master's degree, but also from disillusionment with the reduced number of tournaments and players. She returned to competitive snooker in 2015. With her playing partner Laura Evans, Opacic was a runner-up in the Women's Pairs Championship in both 2017 and 2018. Opacic's main career is as a town planner in Heathrow Airport's Expansion team, working on obtaining planning approvals for the proposed new runway and related developments. ==Titles and achievements== *2006 World Ladies Junior Championship winner *2006 UK Women's Championship semi-finalist *2007 UK Women's Championship semi-finalist *2007 Ladies British Open semi- finalist *2009 Ladies British Open semi-finalist *2016 Connie Gough Trophy semi-finalist *2017 LITEtask World Women's 10-Red Championship semi-finalist *2017 Women's Pairs Championship runner-up (with Laura Evans) *2018 Eden Women's Masters semi-finalist *2018 Women's Pairs Championship runner-up (with Laura Evans) ==References== ==External links== *EPSB \u2013 Your Cue To Play with Suzie Opacic Nine-second video *Suzie Opacic vs Jaique Ip 2018 World Women's Snooker Championship Category:Living people Category:1988 births Category:English snooker players Category:Female snooker players Category:People from Eastleigh Category:Alumni of Bournemouth University ",
