Amid growing international concern over violence against the independence movement in Indonesian-occupied East Timor, Blair was ordered to meet with General Wiranto, the commander of the Indonesian military, and to tell him to shut down the pro-Indonesia militia. According to Nairn, two days after the Liqui\u00e7\u00e1 Church Massacre, Blair failed to deliver this message, instead presenting Wiranto with an offer of military assistance and a personal invitation to be Blair's guest in Hawaii.Alan Nairn. \"US Complicity in Timor\".

January 22, 2009 During his confirmation hearing as Director of National Intelligence, Blair denied the accusations: \"In our conversations with leaders of Indonesia, both military and civilian, we decried and said that the torture and killing that was being conducted by paramilitary groups and some military groups in East Timor had to stop\"; \"those who say that I was somehow carrying out my own policy or saying things that were not in accordance with American policy are just flat wrong\".Sen. Dianne Feinstein Holds A Hearing On The Nomination Of Dennis Blair To Be Director Of National Intelligence. January 22, 2009. Excerpts from Transcript of Confirmation Hearing.

In a 2006 report, the Project on Government Oversight publicized the results of this study and exposed Blair's conflict of interest. Blair told the Washington Post, \"My review was not affected at all by my association with EDO Corp., and the report was a good one\". He originally chose not to recuse himself because he claimed his link to EDO was not of sufficient \"scale\" to require it, but he subsequently resigned from the EDO board to avoid any misperceptions. On December 20 2006, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General's investigation into the affair found Blair had violated IDA's Conflict of Interest rules but did not influence the result of IDA's study. Blair observed, \"with all due respect to the Inspector General, I find it hard to understand how I could be criticized for violating conflict of interest standards when I didn't have any influence on the study\". ===Decorations and notability=== US Navy Admiral Dennis C.

Blair became the third Director of National Intelligence (DNI) on January 29, 2009, after being nominated by newly inaugurated President Barack Obama.ODNI, Biography , January 30, 2009 The East Timor and Indonesia Action Network opposed Blair's nomination for Director of National Intelligence, saying \"His actions demonstrate the failure of engagement to temper the Indonesian military\u2019s behavior and his actions helped to reinforce impunity for senior Indonesian officials that continues to this day\". During his confirmation, Director Blair indicated he did not support a domestic intelligence agency separate from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He also promised to end special interrogation regimes, believing the Intelligence Community must conduct analysis on opportunities as well as threats.New York Times, Statement of Dennis C. Blair before The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, United States Senate, January 22, 2009 (see , 00:30-01:08)Washington Post, DNI Nominee Blair Talks of Opportunities for Statecraft, January 26, 2009ODNI, DNI Workforce Message , January 30, 2009ODNI, Media Roundtable with Mr. Dennis Blair , pg. 5, 21, March 26, 2009 ===Appointment of Intelligence Community representatives=== In May 2009, Blair attempted to assert the DNI's role as the head of the Intelligence Community with a memo claiming authority to appoint CIA chiefs of station abroad. This was vehemently opposed by CIA Director Leon Panetta, who issued a memo of his own.David Ignatius, Intelligence Turf Has to be Ended, June 14, 2009 Blair's two predecessors, Mike McConnell and John Negroponte, were both unable to bring this role under the auspices of the DNI, the authority to appoint chiefs of station having been the province of the CIA since 1947. According to news reports, President Bush issued an executive order to give Blair his congressionally-mandated powers to force the CIA and other intelligence agencies to cooperate with his office. A number of government executives agreed that the DNI should not have to go to the President each time the DNI wants to implement guidance.HSToday, DNI, CIA Turf War Highlights Recurring Issue of DNI's Authority, May 28, 2009 In late July 2009, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence backed Director Blair, asking the CIA to give \"prompt adherence\" to Blair's decision. However, on November 10, 2009, the White House decided in the CIA's favor, agreeing that the authority to appoint station chiefs overseas should remain with the CIA. Some intelligence experts believed this significantly weakened the DNI's authority, comparing the DNI to a DCI without an agency.AFCEA, INTELLIGENCE AND THE AFGHAN SURGE , December 2009 Senator Susan Collins of Maine expressed concerns during hearings over the botched 2009 Christmas terrorist attack that the White House had undermined the power of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence by siding with the CIA in turf disputes, specifically citing this disagreement over intelligence community appointees.The Hill, 9/11 Commission head presses Obama on anti-terrorism efforts, January 26, 2010Financial Times, by Daniel Dombey, US intelligence: Tribal warfare, March 10, 2010The Atlantic, Intel Director Defends His Job, and the Job, 6 April 2010 In a January 2010 statement to lawmakers by Thomas Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, who led the 9-11 Commission Report, Kean and Hamilton urged Obama to be clear who was in charge and urged a strong DNI.Washington Post, Rift raises questions on Obama intel czar's future, March 26, 2010 According to The Washington Post, a former Clinton administration official suggested scrapping the DNI position if Blair were removed.Washington Post, Rift raises questions on Obama intel czar's future, March 26, 2010 ===Testimony on use of assassination on United States citizens=== On February 3, 2010, as Director of National Intelligence, Dennis Blair testified before Congress, \"If that direct action--we think that direct action will involve killing an American, we get specific permission to do that...I would rather go into details in closed session, Mr. Chairman, but we don't target people for free speech. We target them for taking action that threatens Americans or has resulted in it.\"Annual Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community. February 3, 2010. Blair also said: \"Being a U.S. citizen will not spare an American from getting assassinated by military or intelligence operatives overseas if the individual is working with terrorists and planning to attack fellow Americans.\"\"Obama Administration: US Forces Can Assassinate Americans Believed to Be Involved in Terrorist Activity,\" Democracy Now!, February 9, 2010. This remark does not appear in the official transcript. ===Dismissal=== On May 20, 2010, President Obama asked for Blair's resignation, from his role as Director of National Intelligence which was tendered that day effective May 28. There are conflicting reports as to why Blair was asked to resign. ====U.S.\u2013France intelligence project linked to Blair's dismissal==== On May 22, 2010, two days after the resignation was announced, U.S. officials leaked information to The New York Times stating that Blair's dismissal had been related to his continual pushing of a U.S.\u2013French intelligence-sharing project \"with other countries\". Blair and Bernard Bajolet, intelligence advisor to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, had commenced negotiations between October and December 2009 on the pact. The treaty was to have been a legally binding reciprocal no-spying arrangement between France and the United States, whereby each country would take over operations for the other in their home-territory. Under the proposed treaty, U.S. operations in France would be run by French intelligence. This was to be a signed treaty arrangement, a more formal version than the UK\u2013USA Security Agreement. In the month before the treaty failure, President Sarkozy made a number of U.S. visits, the first visit was on March 31, 2010. During the visit, Sarkozy was the first head of state invited by Obama to dine in the White House's private dining quarters. Press releases from both governments made mention of the close relationship between the two heads of state. Mr. Sarkozy was also in Washington for the 2010 Nuclear Security Summit from April 12\u201314, immediately prior to President Obama's rejection of the treaty produced by eight months of negotiations by Blair. US officials claimed that the U.S.\u2013France intelligence-sharing treaty had been rejected by President Obama, adding that DNI Blair's \"continued pushing\" for the pact after presidential rejection were grounds for his dismissal. It was further claimed that President Sarkozy had been upset at the late-stage U.S. drawback in the deal. U.S. sources claimed that the treaty had been signed, despite U.S. claims that the treaty had been rejected by President Obama. In an unusual response, the Palais de l'Elysee confirmed that such a treaty had been negotiated, adding that \"we weren't the askers\" in the deal, denying any French disappointment. French officials further specified that part of the U.S. offer to France comprised access to a \"secure intelligence data and retrieval exchange system\", this being an in-progress U.S. acquisition under the auspices of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. French officials characterized the treaty as minor, stating, \"nothing has changed in our relationship\" in relation to the treaty failure and Blair's dismissal. Officially, France denies conducting operations on U.S. soil. ====Possible DNI\u2013CIA political issues related to dismissal==== Matthew Aid, an espionage historian, offered a different rationale for Blair's dismissal. According to Aid, the White House's rejection of Blair's attempt to bring the appointment of station chiefs under the DNI's authority soured Blair's relationships with Panetta, despite a long personal friendship between the two, and Obama's Homeland Security Advisor, John Brennan, who had sided with Panetta in the dispute (Brennan later succeeded Panetta as Director of the CIA). When it was discovered that the November 2009 Fort Hood shooting and the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 a month later could have been prevented with better inter-agency intelligence sharing, Brennan and Panetta allegedly blamed Blair (which, according to Aid, was not justified), resulting in Obama's decision to replace him.Aid, Matthew M.
