    "text": "Miroslav Kalousek (born 17 December 1960) is a Czech politician, former leader of KDU-\u010cSL and TOP 09, and has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies (MP) since 1998. He served twice as Finance Minister in the cabinets of Mirek Topol\u00e1nek and then again from 2010 to 2013 in the government of Petr Ne\u010das. ==Early life== He studied chemistry at the Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague and then worked at the Ministry of Defense where he was responsible for the budget and acquisitions from 1993 to 1998. ==Political career== In 1998, Kalousek was elected as MP on the ticket of the Christian Democrats, the party he led from 2003 until his departure in 2006. The 2006 parliamentary election resulted in a situation where no party or coalition of parties was able to form a viable government. Over a period of many months a number of alternatives were negotiated with no result. On 24 August 2006 Kalousek unexpectedly accepted an offer from Ji\u0159\u00ed Paroubek to start negotiations on a minority government of KDU-\u010cSL and the Social Democratic Party (\u010cSSD) which would be supported by the Communists. The presidium of the party expressed no objections.\"Veden\u00ed KDU-\u010cSL za Kalouskem nest\u00e1lo, ale ne\u0159eklo to \", novinky.cz, 28 August 2006, accessed 30 August 2006 Such negotiations were in conflict with the pre-election promises and the vocal anti-communist stance of the party and its electorate.Lidovci v kraj\u00edch \u017e\u00e1daj\u00ed rezignaci veden\u00ed strany, \u010cesk\u00e9Noviny.cz, \u010cTK, 25 August 2006, accessed 30 August 2006KDU-\u010cSL ukon\u010dila jedn\u00e1n\u00ed s \u010cSSD, Kalousek rezignuje, \u010cesk\u00e9Noviny.cz, \u010cTK, 25 August 2006, accessed 30 August 2006 On 25 August 2006 mass protests by KDU-\u010cSL members, regional organisations and members of parliament went public. The party group in Brno (the biggest regional organisation) rejected the negotiated solution and asked for the resignation of Kalousek and of the whole presidium of KDU- \u010cSL. Other organisations made similar demands. Some members of parliament declared that they would refuse to support such a government. On the evening of the same day the country-wide committee of KDU-\u010cSL refused the proposal by an overwhelming majority and Kalousek resigned. He has claimed his negotiation with Ji\u0159\u00ed Paroubek was part of a plan to prevent a government coalition of \u010cSSD and the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), which otherwise seemed to be the most likely scenario. That goal in fact came to pass when ODS refused to participate in a \"grand coalition\" and created its own government with minority support in the Parliament. In 2007, Kalousek was appointed as a Finance Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Mirek Topol\u00e1nek, a position he held until 2009 when Topol\u00e1nek's cabinet lost a vote of no-confidence. In 2009, Kalousek and Karel Schwarzenberg co-founded a pro-European, center-right and conservative political party, TOP 09, that found success in the 2010 legislative election and the party formed a coalition government with the Civic Democrats (ODS) and Public Affairs (VV), a move that secured the Ministry of Finance for Kalousek for the second time. Kalousek was re-elected as MP in the 2013 legislative election but lost the post of Finance Minister. In 2015, he was elected as Leader of TOP 09, succeeding Karel Schwarzenberg. ==References== ==External links== * Official biography * 2001 conflict between party leadership and Kalousek Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:People from T\u00e1bor Category:TOP 09 MPs Category:Leaders of KDU-\u010cSL Category:Government ministers of the Czech Republic Category:Finance ministers of the Czech Republic Category:KDU-\u010cSL MPs Category:Leaders of TOP 09 Category:KDU-\u010cSL Government ministers Category:TOP 09 Government ministers ",
