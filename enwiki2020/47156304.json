Haque resigned from RJD in 2010, after the party denied him a ticket for the 2010 Assembly elections. He then became the state president of the little-known Samras Samaj Party. He unsuccessfully contested the 2010 elections from the Narkatiya constituency, as an independent candidate. In July 2015, an 18-year-old man Raghvendra Singh stabbed Haque at the latter's apartment in Patna. Singh then fled with Haque's SUV and his licensed revolver. Haque was admitted to hospital with multiple stab wounds, after his neighbours alerted the police. Haque told the police that three robbers had barged into his apartment, and fled away with his SUV, 30,000 in cash and his revolver after stabbing him. The police traced Singh's cellphone to Arrah, and arrested him. During questioning, he claimed that he was employed as a data entry operator by Haque four days prior to the incident. He insisted that he attacked Haque in self- defense, after Haque tried to sexually assault him. He also stated that he didn't steal any cash or the revolver; the revolver was present in the SUV which he used to escape. The police checked the CCTV footage of Haque's apartment building, and did not find any evidence of three men being involved in the incident, as claimed by Haque. == References == Category:Living people Category:People from Siwan, Bihar Category:Indian Muslims Category:Rashtriya Janata Dal politicians Category:Bihar MLAs 2000\u20132004 Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
