The project also planned an estimated journey time of 30 minutes and a frequency of one service per hour. The train only would run during the day because tracks were used by freight services (currently operated by Trenes Argentinos Cargas y Log\u00edstica) by night. Due to the Government of Argentina did not approve the original project, the provincial government had to change it to a shorter path running on tracks not used by freight concessionaires. That was the main condition required by the Nation to allow passenger trains running in the city. Therefore, the route was set from former Molino Franchino (a former flour mill, currently an exhibition centre named \"El Molino F\u00e1brica Cultural\") in the corner of Pedro Vittori and Boulevard G\u00e1lvez, where a bus stop already existed, remodeling it to make connections with train and cycling transport. Initial costs of the works were estimated at A$ 8 million. Departing from Molino Franchino, the train will run to the north, crossing Parque Federal, Puente Negro and finishing in Esquina Encendida (with a new station named \"Don Bosco\"), on the corner of Zeballos and Zuvir\u00eda streets. Works also included the construction of the intermediate stops, segregated cycle facilities along the way, the installation of traffic lights in all the level crossings. and the reconditioning of the existing tracks. The total costs of the works increased to over A$25 million. (Archive) By July 2015, all the electronic warning devices had been installed in the 22 level crossings of the line. The service was put into operation on January 11, 2016,\"Se puso en marcha el Tren Urbano con 20 viajes diarios\", El Litoral, 12 Jan 2016 but it only run for three days because of a motor breakdown.
