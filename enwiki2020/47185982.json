The other core product groups were gradually built in the following years. In 1966 the plant in M\u00f6nchweiler/Black Forest was acquired - now housing the blades and L-keys production. In 1985 a subsidiary was founded in the USA (today's Willi Hahn Corp.) Over the years further branches were established in France, Spain, England, Denmark, Poland, China and Vietnam.
