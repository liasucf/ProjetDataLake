    "text": "Ramalina menziesii, the lace lichen, is a pale yellowish-green to grayish- green foliose lichen that grows up to a meter long, hanging from bark and twigs in a distinctive net-like or lace-like pattern that is unlike any other lichen in North America.Field Guide to California Lichens, Stephen Sharnoff, Yale University Press, 2014, It becomes a deeper green when wet. Apothecia are lecanorine. it is an important food source for deer in the Coast Range of California, and a source of nest material for birds. It is highly variable in its growth form, with branches sometimes so slender as to appear like strands, sometimes tiny, and sometimes large with broadly flattened branches. Lichen spot tests on the cortex are K-, C-, P- and KC+ dark yellow. After years of effort, the California Lichen Society was able to honor this lichen as the state lichen of California, and the first ever state lichen.http://californialichens.org/state-lichen/ ==References== Category:Lichens menziesii ",
