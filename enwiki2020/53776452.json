    "text": "Patti Page Sings for Romance is a 1954 Patti Page LP issued by Mercury Records as catalog number MG-25185. It was released as an EP with four songs, as well. Billboard reviewed the album on October 30, 1954 saying, inter alia,: \u201cPatti Page Sings for Romance \u2013 Patti Page Song Souvenir \u2013 Mercury 25185, 25187 ... Both of these new LPs should appeal to her large teen-age following and to the older crowd as well. For both sets contain tunes of the 1934-\u201937 period, and Patti sings them all with warmth, feeling and style for which she has become known\u2026Dealers should be able to move many of these sets between now and Christmas.\u201d ==Track listing== == References == Category:Patti Page albums Category:Mercury Records albums Category:1954 albums ",
