    "text": "Rosalind Ann Archer is a New Zealand academic. She is currently a full professor at the University of Auckland, and held the Mercury / Mighty River Power Chair in Geothermal Reservoir Engineering from 2013 to 2018. ==Academic career== After a 2000 PhD titled 'Computing flow and pressure transients in heterogeneous media using boundary element methods' at Stanford University, Archer moved to Texas A&M; University and then to the University of Auckland in 2002, rising to full professor in 2013. In 2013 she also became head of the University of Auckland's Department of Engineering Science. She won the Society of Petroleum Engineers Regional Distinguished Achievement Award for Petroleum Engineering Faculty (Asia Pacific Region) in 2011, and was the first New Zealand-based engineer to be awarded the position of \"distinguished member\" of the Society of Petroleum Engineers in 2015. In 2016, she won the Deloitte Energy Engineer of the Year award. She is a Fellow of Engineering NZ was elected Deputy President of that organisation in 2020. == Selected works == * O\u2019Sullivan, J. P., R. A. Archer, and R. G. J.
