Logosophy is an ethical-philosophical doctrine developed by the Argentine humanist and thinker Carlos Bernardo Gonz\u00e1lez Pecotche, which offers teachings of conceptual order and practices that lead oneself to self-cognition and self-improvement through a process of conscious evolution.\"Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa\". Brazil: Departamento de Imprensa Nacional, 1966, Volume 3 (J-P).\"Dicion\u00e1rio Contempor\u00e2neo da L\u00edngua Portuguesa\". Brazil: Editora Delta S.A., 2nd Brazilian Edition, Volumes III and IV. Logosophy argues that the thoughts can be autonomous and independent of one's individual will, and that they are born and fulfill their function under the influence of the moral or psychic states of their owner or someone else. Its purpose is to free the mental faculties of suggestive influences, allowing the human being to think freely and understand the true objectives of life. Logosophy presents itself as a new and conclusive science, which reveals a method and a set of disciplines of its own, with the purpose of leading man to the knowledge of his own self, of the Universe, and its eternal laws. It also presents itself as a new way of feeling and conceiving life, since it presents a new conception of humanity, human psychic and mental organization, and the human life in its broadest possibilities and proportions.Gonz\u00e1lez Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. \u201cLogosophy, Science and Method\u201d. Brazil: Editora Logos\u00f3fica, 1980, Lesion I. Its name is the combination of the Greek word \"logos\" and \"sophia\", which the author has adopted as meaning Creative Word or Manifestation of the Supreme Knowledge, and Original Science or Wisdom, respectively, to denote \"a new line of cognitions, a doctrine, a method and a technique which are eminently its own\". Logosophy was created in 1930, with the creation of the first Logosophical Foundation in the city of C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina.Logosophy \u2013 International Portal ==The author== Carlos Bernardo Gonz\u00e1lez Pecotche, also known as Raumsol, was born on August 11, 1901 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. He was a son of Jorge N. Gonz\u00e1lez and Maria Pecotche de Gonz\u00e1lez. He married Paulina Eugenia Puntel on October 8, 1924 and had a son, Carlos Federico Gonz\u00e1lez Puntel, born on July 10, 1925. He died in Buenos Aires on April 4, 1963. ==The method== The logosophical method, as its author claims, is unique in its essence and has the quality of adapting itself to each and every mind, giving it the share of knowledge that it is capable of absorbing.Gonz\u00e1lez Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. \u201cLogosophy, Science and Method\u201d. Brazil: Editora Logos\u00f3fica, 1980, Lesion VIII. The examination of the aptitudes and the conditions of assimilation are factors to which the method gives special consideration. Its main artery, which makes the teaching live and breathe in the soul of the student, is the one which requires him, as the main function of the cognition which it bestows, to become intimately familiarized with the teaching to the point of identifying himself with it by associating it to his life. The logosophical method intends to guide the human being to a more thorough knowledge of his mind considered in the entirety of its complex operation. Logosophy invites man to carry out a complete study of his own psychology \u2013 his character, his tendencies, his thoughts, his qualities, his deficiencies, and whatever relates directly or indirectly to the movements of his mental faculties and contemplates his spiritual state. ==Objectives== The main objectives of the logosophical cognitions are:Gonz\u00e1lez Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. \u201cInitiation Course Into Logosophy\u201d. Brazil: Editora Logos\u00f3fica, 1981, Page 16. *Man\u2019s conscious evolution, achieved through the organization of his mental, sensitive and instinctive systems. *The knowledge of one\u2019s self, which implies full mastery of the elements which constitute the secret of each individual\u2019s existence. *The integration of one\u2019s spirit, so that the individual may put to use the values that are his own, for they have their origin in his self inheritance. *The knowledge of the universal laws, which is indispensable for the human being to adjust his life to their wise principles. *The knowledge of the mental, transcendent or metaphysical world, where all the ideas and thoughts that fecund human life originate. *The creation of a new life and a better destiny, by surpassing to a maximum one\u2019s ordinary prerogatives. *The development and mastery of the functions of studying, learning, teaching, thinking and accomplishing, all of which are transubstantiated through the Logosophical method into individual aptitudes of an invaluable significance for the future of the education of mankind. ==Logosophy and Philosophy== According to Gonz\u00e1lez Pecotche, the logosophical knowledge does not have common points of reference with any of the usually studied branches of knowledge, be it Science, Philosophy, Psychology, etc.Gonz\u00e1lez Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. \u201cInitiation Course Into Logosophy\u201d. Brazil: Editora Logos\u00f3fica, 1981, Page 33. Regarding the relationship between Logosophy and Philosophy, Gonz\u00e1lez Pecotche stated: \u201cIn this regard, Logosophy includes two powerful forces which, when they unite and bond, lead man to accomplish the two aims of this existence: to evolve toward perfection and to constitute himself as a real contributor to humanity. One of these factors is the cognition that it offers to the human mind; the other is the affection that teaches how to fulfill human hearts. The common science lacks this affection, this force; it is cold and rigid, and sometimes speculative and intemperate, as in the case of philosophy; conversely, Logosophy is conciliatory. Herein lies the great difference and which also explains why it is capable of realizing great accomplishments in the human soul and which seem inconceivable to those who remain extraneous to such possibilities.\u201dGonz\u00e1lez Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. \u201cAn Introduction to Logosophical Cognition\u201d. Brazil: Editora Logos\u00f3fica, 1998, Page 93. ==Logosophy as Humanism== Amongst the multiple views that Gonz\u00e1lez Pecotche provides of Logosophy, he also mentions that it is a new kind of Humanism. However he differentiates his original contributions from the works of other Humanists: \u201cDiffering therefore from the generalized concept of humanism, our humanism starts from one's own sensitive and thinking being who seeks to accomplish within himself the evolutionary process that all humanity must follow. One's accomplishment in this respect will inevitably constitute later a true example of what each participant within the great human family can achieve.\u201dGonz\u00e1lez Pecotche, Carlos Bernardo. \u201cThe Mechanism of Conscious Life\u201d. Brazil: Editora Logos\u00f3fica, 1986, Chapter 12. ==Logosophical Institutions== Currently, there are logosophical institutions on the following countries: *Argentina *Brazil *Israel *Mexico *Spain *Venezuela *United States *Uruguay According to logosophy.info, there are also students and centers of study in formation in countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. ==References== ==External links== *Logosophy \u2013 International Portal *Logosophical Foundation in the United States Category:Humanism ",
