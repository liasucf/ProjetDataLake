The Faculty of Engineering was one of the first to be created.

The School of Medicine was established in January 2014 being Dr. Marcelo Navarrete Signorile its founding director. ==Curriculum innovation and the Bologna process== In 2004 the ALFA Tuning Latin America Project aimed to 'fine tune' the educational structures that exist in Latin America, initiating a debate whose aim were to identify and improve co-operation between higher education institutions, so as to develop excellence, effectiveness, and transparency. This was an independent project, promoted and coordinated by universities in many different countries, both Latin American and European. Since 2008 to date, the university started a process of curriculum redesign to focus on competences, skills development and learning outcomes. During the redesign process the university ascribed to the Credit Transfer and Accumulation System for its graduate and postgraduate courses. As to 2015 80% of the courses are redesigned and denominated in credits. ==References== ==External links== * Universidad de Magallanes \u2014 official homepage (Spanish) * Consorcio de Universidades Estatales Category:Buildings and structures in Punta Arenas Category:Education in Magallanes Region Category:Buildings and structures in Magallanes Region ",
