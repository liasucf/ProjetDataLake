On June 11th, 1955 the hospital's cornerstone was placed. Before being officially inaugurated, patients with cancer were treated since 1970 when Paulo Pimentel, governor of Paran\u00e1 State, donated a cobalt pump, that allowed 47 sessions of radiotherapy per day. The local community and volunteers gathered resources to finalize and effectively inaugurate the Erasto Gaertner Hospital, on December 8th, 1972. In the beginning, the hospital offered basic clinical and surgical care, attending few patients in an operating room, with a radiotherapy device and the cobalt pump. Nowadays, the hospital is considered the largest cancer treatment center in South Brazil. == References == Category:Hospitals in Curitiba ",
