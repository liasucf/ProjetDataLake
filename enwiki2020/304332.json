He sought to model the newsweekly on the early-20th-century socialist newspaper the Appeal to Reason. For some time, its tagline was 'The Socialist Newsweekly'. \"We intend to speak to corporate capitalism as the great issue of our time, and to socialism as the popular movement that will meet it\" he told the Chicago Sun Times on the eve of the first issue's release.Chicago Sun Times. November 15, 1976. While Weinstein himself was involved with both the New American Movement and the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, he wanted the journal to be independent of any one political party or faction. Thus, over the years it has published a wide variety of contributorsfrom anarchists, to union members, to centrists.
