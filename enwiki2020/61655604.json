She is also the first ever Chinese World Champion in mixed martial arts history. == Background == In pursuit of her lifelong dreams of becoming a professional athlete, ONE Women's Strawweight World Champion Xiong Jingnan originally trained to embark on a weightlifting career, but discovered boxing instead. Falling in love with martial arts, she first began her journey at the age of 18 as a member of the Shandong women\u2019s boxing team and soon went on to represent China internationally. Encouraged by her father to focus on martial arts, she flourished. After all, she was inspired by Chinese martial arts movies from an early age and has always lived by the heroic values she saw on screen. Of particular note, she loved 'The Swordsman.' Besides standing up for the weak and bullied whenever she could, Xiong made many sacrifices to be the best in her field, moving away from home and foregoing many typical teenage activities to focus on training for competition. After adding BJJ to her arsenal, she proved to be talented in all areas, even winning a China Open BJJ championship. She then set her sights on competing in mixed martial arts and threw herself into it completely, training several times a day from morning to night. After a stellar run competing in her native China, she made a successful debut on the global stage of ONE Championship with an impressive knockout of April Osenio. That led her to a shot at the inaugural ONE Women\u2019s Strawweight World Championship against Tiffany Teo, which she seized with yet another knockout to make history as China\u2019s first-ever mixed martial arts World Champion. She has since defended the belt several times in definitive fashion, including handing ONE Women's Atomweight World Champion Angela Lee her first-ever loss. Xiong will challenge Lee for the ONE Women's Atomweight World Title on October 13th at ONE: CENTURY. It will be the main event of ONE: CENTURY Part I on TNT. She has a nephew named Xiong Sheng Ze, who is one of her biggest inspirations. == Mixed martial arts career == === Early career === Xiong made her professional MMA debut in 2014.
