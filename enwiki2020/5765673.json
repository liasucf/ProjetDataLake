    "text": "Sergio \u00c1ngel Berti (born 17 September 1969) is a retired Argentine professional football player, nicknamed La Bruja, who played as a midfielder. ==Club career== Born in Villa Constituci\u00f3n, Santa Fe, Berti began his career in 1988 with popular club Boca Juniors. In 1990, he found his way out of la Bombonera in a transfer to fierce rival River Plate. The red stripe was indeed the club he spent most of his career with, not to mention short spells in between for Parma F.C. and Real Zaragoza. At River, Berti lived the golden era winning 5 titles including 3 domestic tournaments, the Copa Libertadores 1996 and the 1997 Supercopa Sudamericana. In 1999, Mexican club Am\u00e9rica acquired total ownership of his rights. In the Copa Libertadores 2000, when Am\u00e9rica came to visit his former club Boca Juniors for the first leg match of the semifinals, just minutes before the start of the game Sergio Berti withdraw from playing, arguing being scared for the safety of his family and himself based on the chants of the Barra of Boca Juniors. America lost that game 4\u20131 and Sergio Berti never played again with America. In 2001 Berti returned to Argentina and signed for recently promoted team Hurac\u00e1n. The following year, he had a brief stint at Barcelona SC of Ecuador. His career came to an abrupt end in 2002 at the Scottish Premier League side Livingston after spitting at teammate Richard Brittain, during a pre-season friendly. ==International career== Berti was capped in 22 matches and scored one goal for Argentina, including two appearances during the 1998 FIFA World Cup and converting his penalty in the shoot-out against England in the Second Round. He was also a member of the national team that participated in Copa Am\u00e9rica 1995 and Copa Am\u00e9rica 1997. ==References== ==External links== * Argentine Primera statistics at F\u00fatbol XXI * * Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:People from Constituci\u00f3n Department Category:Association football midfielders Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:Argentine footballers Category:Boca Juniors footballers Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Ecuador Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate footballers Category:Serie A players Category:Parma Calcio 1913 players Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:La Liga players Category:Real Zaragoza players Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Liga MX players Category:Club Am\u00e9rica footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Mexico Category:Al Ain FC players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n footballers Category:Barcelona S.C. footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Ecuador Category:Livingston F.C. players Category:UAE Pro League players Category:1998 FIFA World Cup players Category:1995 Copa Am\u00e9rica players Category:1997 Copa Am\u00e9rica players Category:Argentina international footballers Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Italy Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Mexico Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Spain ",
