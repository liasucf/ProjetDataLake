The income tax PAN and its linked card are issued under Section 139A of the Income Tax Act. It is issued by the Indian Income Tax Department under the supervision of the Central Board for Direct Taxes (CBDT) and it also serves as an important proof of identification.

The PAN' structure is as follows: Fourth character [P \u2014 Individual or Person ] Example: AAAPZ1234C * The first five characters are letters (in uppercase by default), followed by four numerals, and the last (tenth) character is a letter. * The first three characters of the code are three letters forming a sequence of alphabets letters from AAA to ZZZ * The fourth character identifies the type of holder of the card.
