All are surprised during a performance of The Great Gambini when the magician predicts Ann and Danby will never be wed. His prediction comes true when Danby's dead body is found. Sgt. Kirby questions all of Ann's family and Grant, and a piece of evidence points them to a man who was using a disguise. Grant believes the detective has the wrong man and discovers it's been Gambini himself all along. Gambini confesses on stage, but remains confident because Kirby's handcuffs might not be able to hold him. ==Cast== *Akim Tamiroff as The Great Gambini *Marian Marsh as Ann Randall *John Trent as Grant Naylor *Genevieve Tobin as Nancy Randall *Reginald Denny as William Randall *Roland Drew as Stephen Danby *William Demarest as Sergeant Kirby *Edward Brophy as Butch *Alan Birmingham as Lamb *Lya Lys as Luba *Ralph Peters as Bartender == References == == External links == * Category:1937 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American mystery films Category:1937 mystery films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:Films directed by Charles Vidor Category:Films produced by B.
