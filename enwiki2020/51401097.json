Claridge Druce became a friend and frequent visitor with whom Davy explored the countryside around her home, contributing numerous finds to records of Sussex flora. In 1899 she joined the Wild Flower Society which increased her interest and contacts with other plant enthusiasts. She lived in Pyrford from 1909 before moving to West Byfleet in 1922 where she kept \"open house\" for botanists of different ages and levels of experience. She was a regular contributor to records of Surrey flora.Surrey Botanical Society: Surrey Floras She travelled across the British Isles on plant-hunting expeditions in groups which she sometimes led. On a trip to Scotland with Gertrude Bacon, they discovered Carex microglochin, never before found growing in the UK. Some of her plant specimens are now in the J. E. Lousley herbarium at Reading University, and others at Oxford University and Kew Gardens. The Natural History Museum, London has 48 watercolours of orchids by Davy in their collection. == References == == External links == *Records of Davy\u2019s herbarium specimens Category:1865 births Category:1955 deaths Category:English botanists Category:Women botanists Category:Botanical illustrators ",
