    "text": "Secom Rugguts is a Japanese rugby union team founded in 1985 by SECOM. Its name is a portmanteau of \"Rugger\" and \"Guts\". The club was in the Top League for the first season of the league but was demoted at the end of the season. As the top team of the Top East league and by then coming second after Fukuoka Sanix Bombs in the three-way Top League Challenge Series, Secom got back into the Top League for the 2005-6 season but was relegated again in 2006-7. On February 10, 2008 Secom's 3-10 loss to World Fighting Bull in the Top Challenge Two series ended its challenge to return to the Top League for the 2008-9 season.
