On November 7, 2006, the Republican incumbent Arnold Schwarzenegger defeated Democratic state treasurer Phil Angelides in the California gubernatorial election to win a second term as Governor of California. Now in his new term, Schwarzenegger pledged to be a centrist politician and cooperate with the Democrats to resolve statewide political issues. Only days into the term, the governor proposed universal health insurance in the state and called for new bonds for schools, prisons, and other infrastructure. In May 2007, Schwarzenegger met with two of his counterparts in Canada, Dalton McGuinty and Gordon Campbell, in order to address climate change and advocate for stem cell research. An oil spill occurred in November when the Cosco Busan struck the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge. In 2008, Schwarzenegger proposed a balanced budget amendment to the state constitution. The governor also proposed an austere fiscal policy in response to the Great Recession. In the United States presidential election, Schwarzenegger endorsed John McCain. Continuing his efforts to address environmental issues, the governor signed a memorandum of understanding with Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n and signed legislation pertaining to global warming. However, by October, Schwarzenegger vetoed 35 percent of the bills that the California State Legislature passed, which was the highest the rate had ever been since the statistic was first tracked when Ronald Reagan was governor of the state. In the election, voters approved Proposition 11, which shifted redistricting powers away from the legislature and created the California Citizens Redistricting Commission. In the midst of the Great Recession in 2009, Schwarzenegger called upon the legislature to pass deep budget cuts and warned that the state was facing insolvency. At the same time, the governor approved of President Barack Obama's federal stimulus bill. Schwarzenegger appointed Laura Chick as inspector general to oversee California's share of the stimulus bill. In May, the governor voiced his support for marijuana legalization and a special election resulted in all but one of the state's propositions being rejected. == Election == In February 2006, Steve Schmidt and Matthew Dowd were respectively named the campaign manager and chief strategist for Schwarzenegger's reelection campaign.

On June 6, Schwarzenegger won nearly 90 percent of the vote in the Republican gubernatorial primary election without serious opposition. On September 13, Angelides admitted to leaking a controversial tape of Schwarzenegger to the media. Katie Levinson, the communications director for the Schwarzenegger campaign called the action \"unethical at best, criminal at worst\". On October 7, Schwarzenegger participated in a debate with Angelides. On October 12, Schwarzenegger appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, which drew criticism because Angelides was not included. While the Democratic Party gained six governorships in the 2006 elections, Schwarzenegger managed to defeat Angelides on November 7. == Second term == === 2007 === Schwarzenegger playing chess with Garry Kasparov in 2007 Schwarzenegger was inaugurated on January 5, 2007 and pledged to work as a centrist by creating an era of \"post- partisanship\" that will bring all Californians together to solve the state's problems.
