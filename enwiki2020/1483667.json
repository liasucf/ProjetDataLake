    "text": "Club Universidad de Chile () is a professional football club based in Santiago, Chile, that plays in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n. The club was founded on May 24, 1927. Universidad de Chile is one of the most successful and popular football clubs in Chile, having won the league title 18 times. In the last 10 years, the team has been crowned champion six times, including their undefeated run to the 2011 Copa Sudamericana title. The team has been throughout its history associated with the blue colour, also present on the logo, which was officially adopted in 1943. The club rivalries are with Colo- Colo and Universidad Cat\u00f3lica, with whom they regularly contest the Santiago derbies known as Cl\u00e1sicos. Despite not owning its stadium, the club usually plays its home games at the Estadio Nacional Julio Mart\u00ednez Pr\u00e1danos, in the commune of \u00d1u\u00f1oa in Santiago. Universidad de Chile was the champion of the Copa Sudamericana 2011. In this tournament, the club had an excellent performance: wasn't defeated, won all their matches in Chile and had the top scorer of the tournament's history (Eduardo Vargas). Universidad de Chile has reached semi-finals in the Copa Libertadores four times (years 1970, 1996, 2010 and 2012). ==History== The club was founded on May 24, 1927, as Club Deportivo Universitario by the merger of Club N\u00e1utico and Federaci\u00f3n Universitaria. Initially, the club was formed by students of the Universidad de Chile and was the sport brand of the university until 1980 when the university's rector and president of the club at the time (both of them appointed by the Pinochet dictatorship) decided to separate the club from the university and created the CORFUCH to manage the football team. This move was a part of the atomization of the Universidad de Chile made by the military dictatorship in order to strengthen the private universities that were founded during that time and also to reduce state power. This was seen as a major blow to the club, as it was left with nothing but a loyal fan base. From then on, the club started to decline in terms of results on the field and lack of support from various sectors of the economy when other major clubs in Chile were helped by main powers such as the government, the catholic church, and Codelco. Eventually, the team's poor performances led to a relegation to second division in 1988, and threats to dissolve the club were made by the university if the team did not manage to return to the first division within a year. In 1989, Universidad de Chile were able to earn the 2nd division's championship, thus bringing them back to the first division, where they have remained since then. ===Bankruptcy and Azul Azul=== In 2006, the club declared bankruptcy and received an imposed administration that was criticized by the supporters, as the new chairman immediately fired club symbols and tried to transform the club into a private company of public stocks, being opposed to the decision of the club members in a previous assembly. The team finished the year with the worst campaign in the club history and the almost-sure transformation into private company due to the ties between the appointed chairman and several businessmen. During 2007, the imposed administration gave the club into concession to a private group (Azul Azul). In 2008, the new university's rector agreed to enter a contract with the now private club, in which he allowed the use of the university's name and symbols in exchange for a royalty and the right to appoint two out of the eleven directors of the board. ==Colours and logo== ===Home kit and away kit=== The team's home kit from 1943 to 1958 consisted of a blue jersey, a white short and blue socks. In 1959, the home kit was changed to an all royal blue kit. In 1992 a darker tone of blue was used for the home kit and in 1996 a red stripe was added to the sleeves. The team's home kit saw its most drastic change in 2001\u201302 when red sleeves were included on the jersey; this kit retained the blue shorts and blue socks. In 2006, the team returned to the 1959 variation of its uniform and has not changed it since then. The current home kit features the classic red letter U on the front of the jersey. From 1934 until 2001\u201302, Universidad de Chile's away kit consisted of a white jersey, shorts and socks, occasionally using blue shorts during the 1990s. In 2001\u201302, for the first time in the club's history a red kit was introduced; this kit consisted of a red jersey with dark blue sleeves, red shorts and red socks. In 2005, the club introduced a new all-red away kit, thereby dropping the blue sleeves in favor of red ones. The current away kit in a similar fashion to the home kit also features the red letter U on the front of the jersey. Universidad de Chile wore a kit that featured the regular royal blue jersey, white shorts and royal blue socks for a game against Chivas during the 2010 Copa Libertadores. At the end of 2010 the historical all-white combination made a return as the club's alternate kit. ===Shirt sponsors and manufacturers=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em\" |- ! style=\"color:#FFFFFF; background:#0000FF;\"|Period ! style=\"color:#FFFFFF; background:#0000FF;\"|Kit Manufacter ! style=\"color:#FFFFFF; background:#0000FF;\"|Shirt Sponsor |- |1974-78 |New Leader |rowspan=6| \u2014 |- |1979 |Haddad |- |1980\u201385 |Adidas |- |1986 |\u00d1andu |- |1987 |Umbro |- |1988\u201389 |rowspan=2|Adidas |- |1990 |Scania |- |1991 |rowspan=2|Pony International |Fiat |- |1991 |rowspan=4|Chilectra |- |1992\u201395 |Avia |- |1996 |Diadora |- |1997\u201398 |rowspan=3|Reebok |- |1998 | \u2014 |- |1998 |rowspan=2|AdeS |- |1999\u201300 | rowspan=\"8\" |Adidas |- |2001\u201303 |LG |- |2004\u201307 |Cristal (Beer) |- |2008\u201310 |Telmexhttp://www.ferplei.com/2010/10/universidad-de-chile-dejara-de-tener-a- telmex-en-su-camiseta/ |- |2010\u201316 |Claro/Tramontinahttp://www.latercera.com/noticia/deportes/2013/11/656-551870-9-universidad- de-chile-renueva-auspicio-con-claro-por-153-mil-uf.shtml |- |2017\u20132018 |Chevrolet/Movistar/Loto |- |2019 |Petrobras/Movistar |- |2020 |Petrobras/Directv |} ===The chuncho logo=== The team's logo, a red and white chuncho (Austral pygmy owl), has its origins in the days of the Club N\u00e1utico Universitario which gave its emblem to the Club Universitario de Deportes (CUD), when was founded in 1927. The logo was taken from Germany by Pablo Ram\u00edrez Rodr\u00edguez, who turned into a Minister of Exchequer in 1945. The chuncho was chosen for its association with wisdom, mutual knowledge, harmony of the body and soul. The team's logo is not usually found on the team's uniform, being favored in turn by a red letter U with a white trim. The chuncho logo was absent from the team's jersey starting in 1979, but made a return during the 1996\u201397 season. Since 2006\u201307, a small chuncho logo could be found on the jersey along with the red U. ==Achievements== Universidad de Chile's first title was won in 1940, just 3 years after their professional debut. The team won six titles (1959, 1962, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1969) between 1959 and 1969 and the became known as the Blue Ballet in reference the beautiful style of football they played. Nine members of that squad were part of the Chilean national team that reached 3rd place in the 1962 FIFA World Cup, the best result ever achieved by Chile in a World Cup. In 1995, Universidad de Chile won the cup once more, this time at home in front of almost 78,000 people in the Estadio Nacional. The team would then win back-to- back titles in 1999 and 2000. More recently Universidad de Chile has won the Apertura in 2004, 2009, 2011 and 2014/2015, and Clausura in 2011 and 2016/2017. The 2011, the title was won at the hands of defending champions Universidad Cat\u00f3lica, by a global score of 4\u20133, having lost the first leg of the final 2\u20130 and needing to win by a 3-goal margin, the team managed to win the second leg by a 4\u20131 score. On the international stage Universidad de Chile have had a few of good runs in Copa Libertadores, reaching the semi-finals in 1970, 1996, 2010, and 2012. On December 14, 2011 they defeated Liga De Quito from Ecuador 3\u20130 (4\u20130 on aggregate) to win the Copa Sudamericana, becoming the third Chilean team to win a South American tournament, behind Colo-Colo's 1991 Copa Libertadores and Universidad Catolica's 1994 Copa Interamericana. In the tournament, the club had an excellent performance (undefeated, and winning all their matches in Chile), and was nicknamed the \"South America's FC Barcelona\". ==Records== Leonel S\u00e1nchez is still popular among the fans. *Record Primera Divisi\u00f3n victory \u2014 9\u20131 v.
