In 1802, she departed Flushing to ferry troops to Saint-Domingue, under capitaine de vaisseau Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez. She arrived as the Haitian Revolution raged. The ships Duguay-Trouin, Annibal and Swiftsure, as well as frigate Pr\u00e9cieuse, Infatigable were also in Haiti. General Pamphile Lacroix ordered the Blacks of the island to be drowned, and the ships started throwing the Blacks of the island overboard. Only Willaumez refused the order, arguing that \u201csailors of the French Navy were no executioners\u201d.www.winterludes.org On 18 May 1803, after the Treaty of Amiens was cancelled and war broke out between France and Great Britain. En route for Saint-Domingue with the 16-gun corvette Mignonne, she encountered a British convoy, was chased by HMS Hercule, and took part in the fights of the Blockade of Saint-Domingue. Largely outgunned, Poursuivante managed to manoeuvre behind Hercule and in the Action of 28 June 1803, managed to rake her, disturbing her operations enough to be able to reach harbour. Mignonne was captured by HMS Goliath. In October, Poursuivante reffited in Baltimore, from where she departed in March 1804. On 14 August 1804, Poursuivante captured in a notable single-ship action off the American coast and later burnt her. During her journey back to France, Poursuivante met and evaded another British ship. Willaumez was promoted to vice-admiral on his return. ==Fate== Poursuivante was converted to a hulk in Rochefort in June 1806. == References == == External links == * LE COMBAT DE LA POURSUIVANTE * * 16 - 30 Mai 1804 Category:Age of Sail frigates of France Category:Ships built in France Category:Romaine-class frigates Category:1796 ships ",
