    "text": "The A4 motorway () is a motorway in Serbia and it spans for . ==History== Ancient Roman road Via Militaris connecting Balkans, central and western Europe had similar route to modern-day A4 motorway. Old highway which is still in partial use was constructed during 1960s and 1970s. Soon it was found out that there are, especially during summer season, too many vehicles which made road unsafe on some parts. So in 1990s construction of modern motorway started. ===Beginning of construction=== The first section of the motorway were 3 km from Trupale interchange to Komren on entrance in Ni\u0161 which was constructed in the period 1990\u20141992. After 1992, due to the wars in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and UN sanctions towards FR Yugoslavia, construction of motorways in Serbia stopped until the wars ended. Construction of the Komren \u2014 Prosek section, which is usually referred as Ni\u0161 bypass, started in 1998, but was cancelled due to the war in Kosovo and NATO intervention. Construction of this section was completed in 2006. Soon after, project of completion of the motorway started. ===Construction of rest of the motorway=== The first two sections on which construction started in 2010 were Pirot east \u2014 Dimitrovgrad (14.3 km) and Dimitrovgrad bypass (8.6 km). Next year, construction started on Crvena Reka \u2014 \u010ciflik (12.7 km), while in 2012, construction of Prosek \u2014 Crvena Reka (22.5 km) commenced. Finally in 2013, construction started on sections \u010ciflik \u2014 Stani\u010denje (12.1 km) and Stani\u010denje \u2014 Pirot east (16.6 km). First completed section was Pirot east \u2014 Dimitrovgrad in 2016, but it could not be opened until two neighboring sections were completed. The next two completed sections were Crvena Reka \u2014 \u010ciflik and \u010ciflik\u2014Stani\u010denje which were opened in July 2017. In July 2017, section Prosek\u2014Bancarevo (9.2 km) was also completed, but it was still not opened because Bancarevo \u2014 Crvena Reka section was not completed at the time. In August 2017 first carriageway of motorway was opened of 5.1 kilometers-long part of section Stani\u010denje \u2014 Pirot east from end of bridge Ni\u0161ava 4 to Sarlah tunnel. In September of same year, for traffic were opened last 7.2 km of section Stani\u010denje \u2014 Pirot east (from exit of tunnel Sarlah to end of section), section Pirot east \u2014 Dimitrovgrad and first 6.8 km of Dimitrovgrad bypass (from beginning of section to Gradinje cut). Also, 1.2 km of half- profile motorway were opened on Dimitrovgrad bypass. In March 2018, full- profile motorway was completed on 5.1 km-long part of section Stani\u010denje \u2014 Pirot east on which first carriageway was opened in 2017. Also were opened another 0.6 km of full-profile motorway and 0.6 km of second carriageway on Dimitrovgrad bypass. In June 2018, the last 0.6 km of the second carriageway on the Dimitrovgrad bypass was opened. In June, was also opened first carriageway on 2 km from bridge Ni\u0161ava 2 to bridge Ni\u0161ava 4 on section Stani\u010denje \u2014 Pirot east, while the second carriageway on this part was opened in July 2018. ==Route== Motorway begins at Trupale interchange near Ni\u0161, at the junction with A1 motorway and runs eastward, to the Gradina border crossing with Bulgaria, near Dimitrovgrad. The motorway is part of the Pan- European corridor X and is planned to be connected with the Bulgarian Europe motorway that will run to Sofia. ==List of Exits== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Nr ! !km !Name !Route !Places !Note |- |align=\"center\"|\u2013 |25px |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"left\"|Trupale |align=\"center\"|25px 25px |align=\"left\"|Kragujevac, Belgrade, Novi Sad, Sremska Mitrovica, Leskovac, Vranje, Pri\u0161tina | |- |align=\"center\"|1 |25px |align=\"center\"|2 |align=\"left\"|Ni\u0161 north |align=\"center\"|25px |align=\"left\"|Ni\u0161, Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport | |- |align=\"center\"|2 |25px |align=\"center\"|9 |align=\"left\"|Ni\u0161 east |align=\"center\"|25px |align=\"left\"|Ni\u0161, Ni\u0161ka Banja | |- |align=\"center\"|3 |25px |align=\"center\"|17 |align=\"left\"|Mal\u010da |align=\"center\"|25px |align=\"left\"|Svrljig, Knja\u017eevac, Zaje\u010dar | |- |align=\"center\"|4 |25px |align=\"center\"|46 |align=\"left\"|Bela Palanka |align=\"center\"|25px |align=\"left\"|Bela Palanka | |- |align=\"center\"|5 |25px |align=\"center\"|70 |align=\"left\"|Pirot west |align=\"center\"|25px |align=\"left\"|Pirot | |- |align=\"center\"|6 |25px |align=\"center\"|80 |align=\"left\"|Pirot east |align=\"center\"|25px |align=\"left\"|Pirot | |- |align=\"center\"|7 |25px |align=\"center\"|96 |align=\"left\"|Dimitrovgrad |align=\"center\"|25px |align=\"left\"|Dimitrovgrad | |- |align=\"center\"|8 |25px |align=\"center\"|103 |align=\"left\"|Gradina |align=\"center\"|25px |align=\"left\"|Dimitrovgrad | |} ==References== Category:Motorways in Serbia Category:Ni\u0161ava District Category:Pirot District Category:Transport in Serbia ",
