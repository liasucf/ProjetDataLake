Frank, *Cinema Journal, Volume 55, Number 1, Fall 2015 *Black Queer Identity Matrix: Towards An Integrated Queer of Color Framework (2014) Howard focuses on the Black lesbian female identity, addressing the intersectionality of race, gender and sexual orientation, and discussing the need for a queer of color conceptual framework. The book calls for a more cohesive outline within queer studies, with a deeper perspective on the variables of ethnicity and race. In a book review in the QED: Journal in GLBTQ Worldmaking, Dominique D.

In a feature piece with the Los Angeles Times, writer Jevon Phillips noted some of the controversy around the Encyclopedia of Black Comics, stating, \"Like any encyclopedia, though, one of the first things people tend to do is point out what's not in the compilation. Dwayne McDuffie, probably the most influential African American figure in comics and cartoons over the past few decades, was not included in the book. He died in 2011, but it's a notable omission, and there are a few others: William Wilson, the first black independent publisher to list digital comics on iTunes, Percy Carey (the rapper MF Grimm), who was the first black Eisner nominee, and Michael Davis \u2014 who could claim a place in the book.\" In multiple interviews, Howard responded to these critiques reminding the public that this is only volume one and if people want more Black comic creatives to be recognized, they have to support volume one.
