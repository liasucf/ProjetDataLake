St Crewenna was possibly one of the Irish saints accompanying saints Germoe and Breaca.Ellis, P. B. (1992) The Cornish Saints. Penryn: Tor Mark Press, p. 9 Crowan church was given, by William, Earl of Gloucester to St James' Priory, Bristol, which wa a dependency of the Benedictine Abbey of Tewkesbury. The present church is of the 15th century but was substantially restored in 1872. In some 18th-century documents there is evidence that the parish was called Uni-Crowan and this may be connected to the fact that the parish was in two parts, one in Penwith and one in Kerrier hundred. The Kerrier portion was once a separate chapelry and may have had St Uny as its patron saint.Doble, G. H. (1960) The Saints of Cornwall; part 1.
