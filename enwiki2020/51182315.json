Chet Baker played the song multiple times when he was part of Mulligan's lineup and it made its way into his standard repertoire. ==Reception== The Allmusic review said \"Although Getz and Baker ended up not getting along very well personally, their cool-toned musical personalities fit together perfectly as can be heard on a brief duet version of \"Line for Lyons\". The remainder of the set finds them successfully revisiting six standards from the 1950s, making one wish it had not been 25 years since their last collaboration\". ==Track listing== # \"Just Friends\" (John Klenner, Sam M.
