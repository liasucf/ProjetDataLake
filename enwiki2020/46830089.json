    "text": "The Lady Is Willing is a 1934 British comedy film directed by Gilbert Miller and starring Leslie Howard (as Mr. Leslie Howard). The film was unsuccessful, though it received some positive feedbacks; Mordaunt Hall wrote on the New York Times: \u201cit is a farce of the Parisian variety which possesses something of the effervescent quality Ren\u00e9 Clair gives to his pictures. Although the action is stilted here and there, obviously occasionally because of censorial deletions, the film has the compensating virtues of excellent acting, scintillating lines and original, but decidedly mad, escapades\u201d. ==Plot== Set in France, private detective Albert Latour is employed by three men who aim to take revenge on the man responsible for a failed investment. Realising that the man's wife is wealthy, Latour kidnaps her in order to hold a ransom. The matter gets complicated when he finds himself falling in love with her.The Lady Is Willing at Allmovie ==Cast== * Leslie Howard as Albert Latour (as Mr. Leslie Howard) * Cedric Hardwicke as Gustav Dupont * Binnie Barnes as Helene Dupont * Nigel Playfair as Professor Menard (as Sir Nigel Playfair) * Nigel Bruce as Welton * W.
