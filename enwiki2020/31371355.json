    "text": "Sibylle of Saxony (2 May 1515 in Freiberg - 18 July 1592 in Buxtehude) was a Saxon princess of the Albertine line of House of Wettin and by marriage Duchess of Saxe-Lauenburg. == Life == Sibylle was the eldest child of the Duke Henry IV of Saxony (1473\u20131541) from his marriage to Catherine of Mecklenburg (1487\u20131561), daughter of the Duke Magnus II of Mecklenburg. She married on 8 February 1540 in Dresden Duke Francis I of Saxe-Lauenburg (1510\u20131581). This relationship turned out to be important for Sibylle's brother Maurice during the Schmalkaldic War. The marriage proved unhappy and Francis accused Sibylle of vindictive and unloving acts.Johann Samuel Ersch\" General Encyclopedia of the sciences and arts in alphabetical order, p. 60 In later years, Sibylle and Francis reconciled again. In 1552, Sibylle asked her brother Maurice to financially assist her husband, so he could redeem some goods and villages from L\u00fcbeck.Johannes Herrmann, G\u00fcnther Wartenberg, Christian Winter Political correspondence of the Duke and Elector Maurice of Saxony, Volume 5, p. 778 In 1588, the Duchess played a prominent role in the affair of her son Maurice, who lived in Buxtehude in the Abbot's House since 1585/86, with Adam von Tschammer's wife Gisela against whom she initiated a trial of witchcraft.
