The growth curve model (also known as GMANOVA) is used to analyze data such as this, where multiple observations are made on collections of individuals over time. The growth curve model in statistics is a specific multivariate linear model, also known as GMANOVA (Generalized Multivariate Analysis-Of-Variance). It generalizes MANOVA by allowing post-matrices, as seen in the definition. ==Definition== Growth curve model: Let X be a p\u00d7n random matrix corresponding to the observations, A a p\u00d7q within design matrix with q \u2264 p, B a q\u00d7k parameter matrix, C a k\u00d7n between individual design matrix with rank(C) + p \u2264 n and let \u03a3 be a positive-definite p\u00d7p matrix. Then : X=ABC+\\Sigma^{1/2}E defines the growth curve model, where A and C are known, B and \u03a3 are unknown, and E is a random matrix distributed as Np,n(0,Ip,n). This differs from standard MANOVA by the addition of C, a \"postmatrix\". ==History== Many writers have considered the growth curve analysis, among them Wishart (1938), Box (1950) and Rao (1958). Potthoff and Roy in 1964;R.F. Potthoff and S.N. Roy, \u201cA generalized multivariate analysis of variance model useful especially for growth curve problems,\u201d Biometrika, vol. 51, pp. 313\u2013326, 1964 were the first in analyzing longitudinal data applying GMANOVA models. ==Applications== GMANOVA is frequently used for the analysis of surveys, clinical trials, and agricultural data, as well as more recently in the context of Radar adaptive detection. ==Other uses== In mathematical statistics, growth curves such as those used in biology are often modeled as being continuous stochastic processes, e.g. as being sample paths that almost surely solve stochastic differential equations. Growth curves have been also applied in forecasting market development. ==Footnotes== ==References== * * * * * Category:Analysis of variance Category:Statistical forecasting Category:Multivariate time series Category:Ordinary differential equations Category:Exponentials Category:Biostatistics Category:Growth curves ",
