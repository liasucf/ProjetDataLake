    "text": "Saint Pantaenus the Philosopher (; died c. 200)\"As he was succeeded by Clement who left Alexandria about 203, the probable date of his death would be about 200. \" (Catholic Encyclopedia) was a Greek theologian and a significant figure in the Catechetical School of Alexandria from around AD 180. This school was the earliest catechetical school, and became influential in the development of Christian theology. ==Biography== Pantaenus was a Stoic philosopher teaching in Alexandria. He was a native of Sicily. He converted to the Christian faith, and sought to reconcile his new faith with Greek philosophy. His most famous student, Clement,Cf. Article \"Clement of Alexandria\" in the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Ed. George Menachery, Vol. II, 1973, p.201 who was his successor as head of the Catechetical School, described Pantaenus as \"the Sicilian bee\".Clement, Stromata, 1.1. Although no writings by Pantaenus are extant,Although Lightfoot (Apost. Fathers, 488), and Batiffol (L'\u00e9glise naissante, 3rd ed., 213ff) attribute the concluding passages of the Epistle to Diognetius to Pantaeus; see \"Pantaenus\" in The Westminster Dictionary of Christian History, ed. Jerald Brauer. his legacy is known by the influence of the Catechetical School on the development of Christian theology, in particular in the early debates on the interpretation of the Bible, the Trinity, and Christology. He was the main supporter of Serapion of Antioch for acting against the influence of Gnosticism.

Thomas in the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Vol.II, 1973, p. 177 et. sq. traveling as far as India where, according to Eusebius, he found Christian communities using the Gospel of Matthew written in \"Hebrew letters\", supposedly left them by the Apostle Bartholomew (and which might have been the Gospel of the Hebrews).Church History by Eusebius.

This may indicate that Syrian Christians, using a Syriac version of the New Testament, had already evangelized parts of India by the late 2nd century. However, some writers have suggested that having difficulty with the language of Saint Thomas Christians, Pantaenus misinterpreted their reference to Mar Thoma (the Aramaic term meaning Saint Thomas), who is currently credited with bringing Christianity to India in the 1st centuryThe Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 5 by Erwin Fahlbusch.

Ed. by Edward Balfour (1871), Second Edition. Volume 2. p. 584. Saint Jerome (c. 347 \u2013 30 September 420), apparently relying entirely on Eusebius' evidence from Historia Ecclesiastica, wrote that Pantaenus visited India, \u201cto preach Christ to the Brahmans and philosophers there.\u201dDe viris illustribus 36 It is unlikely that Jerome has any information about Pantaenus' mission to India that is independent of Eusebius. On the other hand, his claim that \"many\" of Pantaenus' Biblical commentaries were still extant is probably based on Jerome's own knowledge. His feast day is July 7. ==19th century and modern study on Pantaenus== The Universalist Church of America historian J. W. Hanson (1899) argued that Pantaenus \"must, beyond question\" have taught Universalism to Clement of Alexandria and Origen.J. W. Hanson Universalism: The Prevailing Doctrine of the Christian Church p49 \"Pant\u00e6nus was martyred AD 216. The Universalism of Clement, Origen and their successors must, beyond question, have been taught by their great predecessor, Pant\u00e6nus, and there is every reason to believe that the Alexandrine school had never known any contrary teaching from its foundation\" However, since it is now considered that Clement of Alexandria's views contained a tension between salvation and freewill,Itter, Andrew C. Esoteric teaching in the Stromateis of Clement of Alexandria 2009 p181 \"... universal salvation and hinges on the tension between an individual soul's freedom to refuse the chastisements of God, ... universal capacity to save all things.44 It is a tension between the soul's autonomy and universal salvation\" and that he and Origen did not clearly teach universal reconciliation of all immortal souls in their understanding of apokatastasis, Hanson's conclusion about Pantaenus lacks a firm basis.FW Norris, \"Apokatastasis,\" in Westminster Handbook to Origen, 59-62. 58. ==References== == External links == * \"St. Pant\u00e6nus, Father of the Church\", Butler's Lives of the Saints * Saint Bartholomew Mission in India- Mission of Pantaenus in India * Catholic Encyclopedia, s.v. \"Saint Pantaenus\" * Saint Pantaenus in For all the Saints Category:Saints from Roman Egypt Category:Egyptian theologians Category:Greek educators Category:Sicilian saints Category:216 deaths Category:Christian theologians Category:Stoic philosophers Category:2nd-century Christian saints Category:Year of birth unknown Category:2nd-century births Category:2nd-century Christian theologians ",
