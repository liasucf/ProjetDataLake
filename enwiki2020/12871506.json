    "text": "Flers is a commune in the Orne department in Normandy, France. The inhabitants are called Fl\u00e9riens. ==Geography== Cassini map Flers is bordered to the north by the communes of Saint-Georges-des-Groseillers and Aubusson, to the north-east by Ronfeugerai, to the west by La Lande-Patry and Saint-Paul, to the south-west by La Chapelle-Biche, La Chapelle-au-Moine and Messei, and to the south-east by La Selle-la-Forge. The commune is situated in the north-west of the Orne d\u00e9partement, about ten kilometres from the border of the Calvados, an hour east of Granville, and two hours by train from Paris. It depends on a prefecture located an hour north in Caen. The commune is crossed by the river V\u00e8re which ends in the river Noireau in Pont-Erembourg (commune of Saint- Denis-de-M\u00e9r\u00e9). ===Climate=== Flers is part of the region that stretches from the Bocage to the \u00c9couves forest, the wettest part of the Orne d\u00e9partement, with relatively mild temperatures thanks to its proximity to the English Channel and the effect of the sea. It benefits from an oceanic climate with mild winters and temperate summers.Climate of Orne on the site M\u00e9t\u00e9o France ==History== The first written mentions of Flers appear at the end of the twelfth century as Flers (1164\u20131179) or Flex (1188\u20131221). Some authors think that the name of the town derives from the German toponym Hlaeri, meaning wasteland or common grazing land, while others suggest an origin in the German Fliessen, from the Dutch vliet or the Latin fluere Latin Fluere, indicating a waterflow, basin or marsh. Yet another etymology links Flers to the Latin flexus, meaning the bend in a road or river. Finally, the Breton term fler or flear means bad smell, indicating the stench of stagnant water. All etymologies seem to agree however that the town is named for its topography and the water close to it.Flers, Flers promotion, 1991 p. 9 ===Middle Ages=== From the tenth century on, the de Flers family headed a barony. Tradition has it that in the 11th century, the two brothers Foulques d'Aunou and Guillaume de Gaspr\u00e9e married two sisters who were Ladies of Flers. Foulques d'Aunou received as his wedding gift Flers, seat of the barony.\u00c0 la d\u00e9couverte de Flers - Le ch\u00e2teau p84 The construction of the castle of Flers began in the 12th century as a fortified location of wood and stone surrounded by water. The chronicles of the Hundred Years War do not mention a fortified place in Flers, revealing that it didn't present a major strategic interest at the time. ===Construction of the castle=== In 1790, in the revolutionary period, Flers formed a canton in the district of Domfront, in the Orne d\u00e9partement. The countess of Flers, Jacqueline Le Gou\u00e9 de Richemont, wife of Pierre- Fran\u00e7ois de Paule de La Motte-Ango, supported the counter-revolutionary chouans. The castle of Flers became the headquarters of count Louis de Frott\u00e9, one of the leaders of the Normandic Chouannerie.\u00c0 la d\u00e9couverte de Flers - Le ch\u00e2teau p. 24-25 {| class=\"infobox\" style=\"padding: 0.5em\" |+ Owners of the Flers domain | Year || Owner |- | 1901 || The town buys the castle |- | 1820\u20131901 || Schnetz family |- | 1806\u20131820 || de Redern family |- | 1736\u20131806 || de La Motte-Ango family |- | 1547\u20131736 || de Pellev\u00e9 family |- | 1404\u20131547 || de Grosparmy family |- | 1396\u20131404 || Guillaume de Tournebu |- | 1320\u20131396 || Robert III d'Harcourt Robert IV d'Harcourt Robert V d'Harcourt |- | 1180\u20131320 || Foulques d'Aunou Thomas d'Aunou |- | 10th to 12th century || de Flers family |- |} ===Industrial Revolution=== In 1901, Julien Salles, mayor of Flers, bought the castle for the community. ===World War II=== Like other towns near the D-Day landing, Flers was one of the targets of strategic bombing of Normandy on 6 and 7 June 1944, aimed at reducing the advance of German reinforcements. 80% of the town was destroyed.
