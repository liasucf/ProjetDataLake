    "text": "Shang Commandery () was a historical commandery of China. It was located in modern-day Northern Shaanxi. The commandery was established during the reign of Marquess Wen of Wei. In 328 BC, it was annexed by the Qin state. The seat was Fushi (\u819a\u65bd), to the south of modern Yulin, Shaanxi. During the Chu\u2013Han Contention, Shang was granted to Dong Yi, a Qin general who received the title \"King of Di\" from Xiang Yu. After Dong's defeat in 205 BC, the territory became part of Han. In late Western Han dynasty, Shang included 23 counties, namely Fushi (\u819a\u65bd), Dule (\u7368\u6a02), Yangzhou (\u967d\u5468), Muhe (\u6728\u79be), Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd), Qianshui (\u6dfa\u6c34), Jingshi (\u4eac\u5ba4), Luodu (\u6d1b\u90fd), Baitu (\u767d\u571f), Xiangluo (\u8944\u6d1b), Yuandu (\u539f\u90fd), Qiyuan (\u6f06\u57a3), Sheyan (\u5962\u5ef6), Diaoyin (\u96d5\u9670), Tuixie (\u63a8\u90aa), Zhenlin (\u6968\u6797), Gaowang (\u9ad8\u671b), Diaoyindao (\u96d5\u9670\u9053), Qiuci (\u9f9c\u8332), Dingyang (\u5b9a\u967d), Gaonu (\u9ad8\u5974), Wangsong (\u671b\u677e) and Yidu (\u5b9c\u90fd). The population was 606,658, in 103,683 households in 2 AD.Book of Han, Chapter 28.
