The Lost Daughter is based on the kidnapping and murder of Italian politician and former Prime Minister Aldo Moro in 1978.\" Grindle's choice of Florence as her preferred literary locale is said to be the result of several trips she and her husband made to Florence in the first years of the 21st century.
