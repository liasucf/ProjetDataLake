    "text": "Bagley is a village in the City of Leeds metropolitan borough, West Yorkshire, England, once in the township of Farsley. The remains of the village (or hamlet) are on Bagley Lane, on the section between the A657 road in Rodley and the junction with Coalhill Lane. ==Etymology== The name of Bagley is first attested in both its current spelling and the form Baglay in 1344. The second element comes from Old English l\u0113ah ('open land in a wood'). While the etymology of the first element is uncertain, it is thought to be from a putative Old English word *bagga ('badger'). Thus the name probably once meant 'clearing characterised by badgers'.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017). ==Geography== A number of old buildings in the area have survived. A nearby stream, known as Bagley Beck, runs past the place on its way to the River Aire, crossing the Leeds and Liverpool canal at Rodley. ==References== Category:Villages in West Yorkshire ",
