The program began as a successful TV movie, The Alice, that later spun off a regular series. The series proved less popular and was cancelled by the Nine Network on 28 September 2005 after a sharp decline in its ratings. The entire series and original TV movie have since been released on DVD. ==Cast== * Jessica Napier \u2013 Jess Daily * Erik Thomson \u2013 Jack Jaffers * Caitlin McDougall \u2013 Helen Gregory * Simon Burke \u2013 Patrick * Patrick Brammall \u2013 Matt Marione * Roxane Wilson \u2013 Ellie Delaney * Brett Stiller \u2013 Toby Delaney * Andrew McFarlane \u2013 Hugh Delaney * Anne Louise Lambert \u2013 Heaven Daily * Luke Carroll \u2013 Michael Anderson * Henry Hereford \u2013 Adam Cooper ==Awards and nominations== ===APRA-AGSC Screen Music Awards=== The annual APRA-AGSC Screen Music Awards are presented by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) and Australian Guild of Screen Composers (AGSC) for television and film scores and soundtracks. |- |rowspan=\"2\"| 2005 || The Alice (David Bridie) || Best Music for a Mini-Series or Telemovie || |- | \"Pitjantjara\" (Bridie, Frank Yamma) \u2013 The Alice || Best Original Song Composed for a Feature Film, Telemovie, TV Series or Mini-Series || ==See also== * List of Australian television series ==References== ==External links== * * *The Alice at Australian Screen Online Category:APRA Award winners Category:Australian drama television series Category:Nine Network original programming Category:Television shows set in the Northern Territory Category:Television shows set in the Outback Category:2005 Australian television series debuts Category:2005 Australian television series endings Category:Television series by Endemol Australia ",
