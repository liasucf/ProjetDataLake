    "text": "The Jabez Bacon House is a historic house on Hollow Road in Woodbury, Connecticut. Built in 1760 for a prominent regional merchant, it is a well- preserved example of Georgian architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. ==Description and history== The Jabez Bacon House stands near the southern end of Woodbury's main village, on the north side of Hollow Road between Sycamore and Main Streets. It is a 2-3/4 story wood frame structure, with a dormered gambrel roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It is five bays wide, with a slightly overhanging second story. The front entry is centered, with a reproduction surround consisting of flanking pilasters and a pedimented gable above. The three roof dormers also exhibit full pediments. The interior of the house follows a typical Georgian central chimney plan, but has a wider than usual entry vestibule with staircase. The interior retains original paneled wall finishes, and many rooms have original flooring. The living room includes a period cabinet, and the chimney includes two surviving period ovens. and The house was built in 1760 by Roswell Moore, a prominent local carpenter. He built it for Jabez Bacon, a merchant and banker who operated a store next door, and sent traders as far west as present-day Ohio. It was later acquired by Daniel Curtiss, who also operated a merchant business. Curtiss notably trained as a salesman Collis Potter Huntington, who later became prominent for his role in construction of the transcontinental railway. ==See also== *Glebe House (Woodbury, Connecticut), a house museum nearby on Hollow Road *National Register of Historic Places listings in Litchfield County, Connecticut ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Litchfield County, Connecticut Category:Georgian architecture in Connecticut Category:Houses completed in 1760 Category:Houses in Litchfield County, Connecticut Category:Woodbury, Connecticut Category:Historic district contributing properties in Connecticut ",
