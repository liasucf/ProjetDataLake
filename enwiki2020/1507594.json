    "text": ":See also Special Vehicle Operations Special Vehicle Team, also known as SVT, is an arm of Ford Motor Company responsible for the development of the company's highest-performance vehicles. SVT is the successor to the SVO division. The current SVT Director is Hermann Salenbauch. SVT was previously led by Hau Thai-Tang (2004\u20132007) and John Coletti (1993-2004). ==Information== The group mainly produces specially tuned versions of Ford production vehicles such as the 2010 F-150 SVT Raptor which is based on the Ford F150. However, they do occasionally develop models independently of the rest of the company, namely the GT supercar (developed in conjunction with Saleen). SVT was founded in 1983 by John Plant of Ford Marketing, Janine Bay of Ford Mustang Program Management, and Robert Burnham of Ford Truck Program Management. Originally known as Special Vehicle Operations, SVO developed the 1984\u20131986 2.3-liter turbo-charged 4-cylinder Mustang SVO, as well as marketed performance parts through dealer networks (now known as Ford Performance Parts, or FPP). Ford SVT debuted the 2010 F-150 SVT Raptor high-performance off-road truck. The Raptor is the only high-speed off-road performance truck offered by any OEM. Using a completely re-designed suspension, with internal-bypass Fox Racing Shocks and specially developed BF Goodrich all-terrain 35\" tires, the Raptor is considered an OEM-style \"pre-runner.\" Pre-runners are reconnaissance vehicles used for high-speed testing of off-road race courses before a race. F-150 SVT Raptor also debuted the all-new 6.2-liter V8 engine as an option for the 2010 model year (likely to be standard in subsequent model years). Ford reports horsepower and torque as 411 hp (306 kW) @ 5500 rpm, 434 lb\u00b7ft (588 N\u00b7m) @ 4500 rpm in the Raptor. All Raptor models will have a 6-speed automatic transmission, selectable 4WD, and rear E-Locker that stays engaged at high- speeds. Speculation suggests that as a result of Ford's plan to globalize their vehicles, SVT and the European RS division will merge, thus aligning all American and European performance vehicle activity together. ==SVT vehicles== {| class=wikitable !Model!!colspan=2|Version!!Year!!Engine!!Power!!Torque!!Production |- align=center |rowspan=12|SVT Lightning||rowspan=4 colspan=2|9||1993||rowspan=3|5.8 L Windsor FI V8||rowspan=3|240 hp (179 kW)||rowspan=3|340 ft\u00b7lbf (461 N\u00b7m)||align=right|5,276 |- align=center |1994||align=right|4,007 |- align=center |1995||align=right|2,280 |- align=right !colspan=4|Total |11,563 |- align=center |rowspan=7 colspan=2|10||1999||rowspan=6|5.4 L supercharged Triton V8||rowspan=2|360 hp (268 kW)||rowspan=2|440 ft\u00b7lbf (597 N\u00b7m)||align=right|4,000 |- align=center |2000||align=right|4,966 |- align=center |2001||rowspan=4|380 hp (283 kW)||rowspan=4|450 ft\u00b7lbf (610 N\u00b7m)||align=right|6,381 |- align=center |2002||align=right|4,726 |- align=center |2003||align=right|4,270 |- align=center |2004||align=right|3,781 |- align=right !colspan=4|Total |28,124 |- align=right !colspan=6|Total - SVT Lightning |39,687 |- align=center |rowspan=17|SVT Cobra||rowspan=3|Fox||Base||1993||rowspan=2|5.0 L Windsor V8||rowspan=2|235 hp (175 kW)||rowspan=2|280 ft\u00b7lbf (380 N\u00b7m)||align=right|4,993 |- align=center |R||1993||align=right|107 |- align=right !colspan=5|Total |5,100 |- align=center |rowspan=7|SN-95 1 / Fox-4||rowspan=5|Base||1994||rowspan=2|5.0 L Windsor V8||rowspan=2|240 hp (179 kW)||rowspan=2|285 ft\u00b7lbf (386 N\u00b7m)||align=right|6,009 |- align=center |1995||align=right|5,008 |- align=center |1996||rowspan=3|4.6 L DOHC Modular V8||rowspan=3|305 hp (227 kW)||rowspan=3|300 ft\u00b7lbf (407 N\u00b7m)||align=right|10,002 |- align=center |1997||align=right|10,049 |- align=center |1998||align=right|8,654 |- align=center |R||1995||5.8 L Windsor V8||300 hp (224 kW)||365 ft\u00b7lbf (495 N\u00b7m)||align=right|250 |- align=right !colspan=5|Total |39,973 |- align=center |rowspan=6|SN-95 2||rowspan=4|Base||1999||rowspan=2|4.6 L DOHC Modular V8||rowspan=2|320 hp (239 kW)||rowspan=2|317 ft\u00b7lbf (430 N\u00b7m)||align=right|8,095 |- align=center |2001||align=right|7,251 |- align=center |2003||rowspan=2|4.6 L DOHC SC Modular V8||rowspan=2|390 hp (291 kW)||rowspan=2|390 ft\u00b7lbf (529 N\u00b7m)||align=right|13,476 |- align=center |2004||align=right|5,664 |- align=center |R||2000||5.4 L DOHC Modular V8||385 hp (287 kW)||385 ft\u00b7lbf (522 N\u00b7m)||align=right|300 |- align=right !colspan=5|Total |34,859 |- align=right !colspan=6|Total - SVT Cobra |79,932 |- align=center |rowspan=4|SVT Contour||rowspan=3 colspan=2|CDW27||1998||rowspan=3|2.5 L Duratec 25 SVT V6||195 hp (145 kW)||165 ft\u00b7lbf (224 N\u00b7m)||align=right|6,535 |- align=center |1999||rowspan=2|200 hp (149 kW)||rowspan=2|169 ft\u00b7lbf (229 N\u00b7m)||align=right|2,760 |- align=center |2000||align=right|2,150 |- align=right !colspan=6|Total |11,445 |- align=center |rowspan=4|SVT Focus||rowspan=3 colspan=2|CW170||2002||rowspan=3|2.0 L Zetec I4||rowspan=3|170 hp (127 kW)||rowspan=3|145 ft\u00b7lbf (197 N\u00b7m)||align=right|4,788 |- align=center |2003||align=right|6,158 |- align=center |2004||align=right|3,057 |- align=right !colspan=6|Total |14,003 |- align=right !colspan=7|Total |144,993* |} SVT is credited in the following vehicles: * 1993 SVT Cobra * 1993 SVT Cobra R * 1993-1995 Ford SVT Lightning * 1994-1995 SVT Cobra * 1995 SVT Cobra R * 1995 Ford GT90 * 1996 SVT Explorer * 1996-1998 SVT Cobra * 1998-2000 SVT Contour * 1999-2001 SVT Cobra * 2000 SVT Cobra R * 1999-2004 Ford SVT Lightning * 2003-2004 SVT Cobra * 2002-2004 SVT Focus * 2005\u20132006 Ford GT * 2010\u20132014 Ford F-150 SVT Raptor, (the 2017-present Raptor loses the SVT prefix) * 2007-2014 SVT/Shelby GT500 ==See also== * Ford TeamRS, Ford's European performance car and motorsport division * Ford Performance Vehicles (FPV), Ford Australia's performance car division ==References== ==External links== * Official Ford Racing website * Official Ford SVT collector cars * Category:Ford Motor Company Category:Official motorsports and performance division of automakers ",
