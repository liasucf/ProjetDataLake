The maidens grow attached by their head from the tree branches.Nariphon Tree at a temple in Thailand This tree grows at the Himaphan, a mythical forest where the female fruits are enjoyed by the Gandharvas who cut the fruits and take them away.Thai traditional mural painting The Nariphon is also mentioned in the Vessantara J\u0101taka in which Indra placed these trees around the grove where the Bodhisattva Vessantara meditated. ==Myths and folklore== According to Buddhist mythology, the god Indra created a pavilion (Sala) as an abode for Vessantara, his wife, and two children to live. His wife went into the forest to collect fruits: she was, however, in danger of being attacked by hermits or yogis who lived in the forest. Although they had acquired special powers from their meditation, they had not conquered lust. Therefore, Indra created twelve of these special Nariphon trees. The trees would bear fruit whenever she went out to collect food and distract the men. The fruits were all in the image of Indra's beautiful wife. The men took the fruits to their place of abode and, after making love to them, would sleep for four months and lose their powers. According to Thai folklore, since Vessantara and his family have died, the trees bear fruit daily, but the forest will disappear when the Buddha's teachings have become lost (predicted to be five thousand years after his death). When the fruits appear on the trees, they last for seven days, after which they will wither and die if they are not picked.Nariphon book They have same internal organs as humans, but no bones. These maidens also have magical powers and possess spirits which can sing and dance.\u0e21\u0e31\u0e01\u0e01\u0e30\u0e25\u0e35\u0e1c\u0e25\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e32\u0e23\u0e35\u0e1c\u0e25 \u0e19\u0e48\u0e32\u0e08\u0e30\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e43\u0e19\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e14\u0e01\u0e40\u0e17\u0e48\u0e32\u0e19\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d There are supposedly two Makaliporn pods in a Buddhist temple near Bangkok.
