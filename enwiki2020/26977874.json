GBOD was established by the 1972 United Methodist General Conference, and in March 2015, officially changed its name. Discipleship Ministries was given the primary responsibility for the support of receiving, nurturing and caring ministries of congregations in The United Methodist Church. The board provides resources in the areas of Christian education, worship, music, evangelism, new church development, stewardship, lay leadership development, age-level (children, youth, adult) and family ministries, small-group ministries, ethnic local church concerns, devotional life, spiritual formation, and other areas related to the lives of people, church leaders, and the ministries of congregations. Written and audiovisual resources produced by Discipleship Ministries staff support the ministries of clergy and lay people and congregations. Staff members also provide training, education, and skill development seminars and workshops. ==Organization== Discipleship Ministries staff includes specialists in evangelism, worship, Christian education, music, stewardship and other areas of ministry. The agency is organized in these major divisions: ===The Upper Room=== The Upper Room is a global ministry that supports the spiritual formation of Christians. From its beginnings as a daily devotional guide, Upper Room Ministries has grown to include publications, programs, prayer support and other resources to help people of all ages and denominations. The Upper Room is a daily devotional guide published in 78 languages through 41 international editions. The guide celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2010. Upper Room resources are grouped in five different areas: personal spirituality; children, youth, young adults and families; small groups; spiritual leadership, and cross-cultural and international ministries. Upper Room Ministries also publishes books and magazines for people of all ages and provides various programs and events. Upper Room Ministries also includes the Emmaus Ministries International Office, which oversees the family of Emmaus Ministries, including: Walk to Emmaus, Chrysalis, Face to Face, Journey to the Table, and Discovery Weekend. ===Leadership Ministries=== Leadership Ministries provides resources to both the laity and clergy leaders of The United Methodist Church who work in local congregations, districts and annual (regional) conferences.
