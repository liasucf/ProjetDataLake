Arouca. ==Career== In the summer of 2010, three seasons after finishing his professional career as a player, Evangelista embarked on his managerial career by taking charge of Vit\u00f3ria S.C.'s under-19 team. After two seasons there, he departed to take charge of F.C. Vizela in the third tier. Evangelista's stay with Vizela was short-lived, and in April 2013 he returned to Vit\u00f3ria to manage its reserve side in Segunda Liga until the end of the season. Despite claiming 9 points from a possible 21, he was unable to prevent relegation to the third tier. However, Evangelista's stay was prolonged and in 2013\u201314 season he led the Conquistadores to a first-place finish, and thus promotion back to the second tier. The following season, he took them to 9th. He was subsequently named manager of the first team in June 2015 after Rui Vit\u00f3ria's departure from the club. After just five league matches \u2013 a win and a loss each \u2013 and elimination from the UEFA Europa League qualifiers by Austria's SC Rheindorf Altach, Evangelista was dismissed on 21 September. In May 2016, he succeeded Nuno Capucho at Varzim S.C. in the second tier. He left on 13 October, with the team in 12th. In September 2017, Evangelista returned to the second tier at 15th-placed F.C. Penafiel for the rest of the season. He then signed on for the following campaign, in which he took the team to 8th then left to be replaced by Miguel Leal. Evangelista returned to work on 5 February 2020, at U.D. Vilafranquense, presiding over only four games as the season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and then turning down a new deal. On 15 May that year, he moved to second-tier newcomers F.C. Arouca. ==References== ==External links== * Armando Evangelista at footballzz.co.uk * * Armando Evangelista manager stats at ForaDeJogo Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:People from Guimar\u00e3es Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:LigaPro players Category:Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Naval 1\u00ba de Maio players Category:S.C.
