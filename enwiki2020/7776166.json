Following the international trend of teen pop girl groups established by the Spice Girls, the five members of Bandana \u2014 Ivonne Guzm\u00e1n, Lourdes Cecilia Fern\u00e1ndez, Valeria Gastaldi, Virginia Da Cunha and Mar\u00eda Elizabeth Vera \u2014 were selected on the TV show Popstars and were a carefully marketed product that became a phenomenon in the country, particularly among young girls. ==History== Their self-titled debut album was released in 2001 on Sony BMG Records, led by the hit single \"Guapas\", and was certified four-times platinum by the CAPIF. Despite being initially snubbed by many critics and artists, Bandana emerged as Argentina's best-selling act since 2001. At the time of their disbandment in 2004, the combined sales of Bandana's three studio albums were estimated to be 450,000 copies sold. Their career was marked by several landmarks for Argentine musicians \u2014 specially bearing in mind the 1998\u20132002 Argentine great depression: 280 thousand tickets were sold to see them perform in the Teatro Gran Rex (with a total of 86 concerts in the venue); they performed twice for a total of 90 thousand people in the Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani Stadium; and released Vivir intentando, a film starring themselves that was seen by over 1 million people. In 2016, Bandana announced a reunion concert (without Ivonne Guzm\u00e1n) at the Lola Membrives Theatre in Buenos Aires; due to the high demand for tickets, the group has added five more dates. The concerts sold out within an hour and a half. The band also released a new album, titled La Vuelta which contains new versions of some of their biggest hits. On January 16, 2017, the band released their first original song ever since 2003 entitled \"Bomb\u00f3n\". The following day, da Cunha announced her departure from the band. In March, 2017 the 3 Bandana members, Lourdes, Valeria and Lisa, flew to the US to record the music video for their first single since their comeback, \"Bomb\u00f3n\" featuring Wisin. The music video was produced and directed by Lourival Rodriguez and co- directed by Ruslan Shakirov. It was shot in a Mansion in Miami Beach, FL. Following da Cunha's departure, the band continues to release new singles, including \"No No No\" and \"Baila\" in 2018, and their latest single, \"En la Punta de la Lengua\" in February 2019. ==Members== The original group consisted of 5 girls: * Ivonne Guzm\u00e1n (2001\u201404) * Lourdes Cecilia Fern\u00e1ndez (2001\u201404, 2016\u2014present) * Valeria Gastaldi (2001\u201404, 2016\u2014present) * Virginia Da Cunha (2001\u201404, 2016\u201417) * Mar\u00eda Elizabeth Vera (2001\u201404, 2016\u2014present) All the girls hailed from Buenos Aires, apart from Guzm\u00e1n, who is a native of Colombia. Upon the band's comeback tour in 2016, Guzm\u00e1n decided not to return, being the only member who did not rejoin. Guzm\u00e1n's role was not replaced. On January 17, 2017, da Cunha revealed through her Instagram account she had left the band to focus on her solo career. The rest of the members announced subsequently that they would not replace da Cunha and instead, would continue as a 3-girl group. ==Casting== Formed in 2001 on the reality TV show Popstars, 5 girls were selected from 5,000's of contestants who had attended the casting. Their emergence coincided with a period of nationwide economic depression. As such, their success contrasted greatly with the general mood of the country, & one of the judges commented that \"this was an opportunity to shine at a very downbeat moment for Argentina\".\"El sue\u00f1o del estrellato veloz convertido en realidad\" P\u00e1gina 12 Article Juli\u00e1n Gorodischer 01-11-2001 The final line-up was unusual in the sense that the girls didn't conform to traditional ideas of beauty: Ivonne wore braces & Lourdes was known as la peti (shorty) due to her height. Judge Afo Verde noted that \"appearance didn't matter to us, what each girl conveyed was most important\". == Musical history == Their first self-titled album, Bandana, was the best-selling album of 2001 in Argentina, turning platinum soon after release and achieving 4 platinum certifications.Biography Music.com, Drago Bonacich 18-06-2004 It spawned a number of hits including C\u00f3mo Puede Ser, Guapas & Maldita Noche.
