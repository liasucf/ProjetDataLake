It was in the Baron's home in Strasbourg that Rouget de Lisle first sang the La Marseillaise. In October 1877, the school had 142 students. In 1888, the alumni association was formed. In 1929, Jean Delsuc created the 65th Paris Scouts de France at Rocroy Saint-L\u00e9on, then a college of Guy de Larigaudie. The college is immediately next door to Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Paris and its 55th. After the occupation, the school had 660 students, and its new group of teachers included Roger Vrigny, Grand prix de litt\u00e9rature de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise The primary school became mixed in 1960. The following year, the school entered into a contract of association with the state. In 2008, Rocroy Saint-L\u00e9on joined with \u00c9cole Saint-Vincent de Paul and Lyc\u00e9e Petrelle to form the group Rocroy Saint-Vincent de Paul. The new group occupies 3 sites: \\- The \u00e9cole Saint-Vincent de Paul at 6 rue de Rocroy (Kindergarted, primary, and year six) \\- The institution Rocroy Saint-L\u00e9on at 106, rue du Faubourg-Poissonni\u00e8re (from year five to year two) \\- The lyc\u00e9e P\u00e9trelle au 8, rue P\u00e9trelle (first and last year). In 2012, the establishment had 1750 students. Today, Rocroy Saint-Vincent de Paul accepts students from kindergarten to the final year, and after their studies, many continue on to classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles, especially in medical education ou de law. == Lyc\u00e9e ranking == In 2015, the lyc\u00e9e ranked 13th out of 109 at d\u00e9partemental level in teaching quality, and 132nd at national level. The ranking is based on three criteria: the level of bac results, the proportion of students who obtain the baccalaur\u00e9at having spent their last two years in the establishment, and the added value (calculated based on the social origin of the students, their age, and their national diploma results). Since 2010, the lyc\u00e9e has always achieved at least 80% of honours and 99% of baccalaur\u00e9at results. == See also == * Souvenirs De L'\u00e9cole Rocroy Saint-L\u00e9on.
