    "text": "Rimosodaphnella is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Raphitomidae. ==Description== (Original description) The diagnosis that Cossmann previously provided in support of Bellardiella does not apply - as we have seen above - to the genotype which is a typical Clathurella. It remains to name the shells which, like Pl. textilis, are not true Daphnella, because of their more twisted and shorter siphonal canal, their more elongated spire, and their narrower aperture in front. This group absolutely deviates from Clathurella because of its thin outer lip, its very deep sinus, its unpleated columella, so that there is only a distant analogy in ornamentation. Cossmann therefore takes up for this group - as a subgenus of Daphnella - the name Rimosodaphnella Cossmann, M. (1916). Essais de pal\u00e9oconchologie compar\u00e9e. Dixi\u00e8me livraison.
