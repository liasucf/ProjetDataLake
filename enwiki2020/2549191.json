    "text": "A Dynkin system, named after Eugene Dynkin, is a collection of subsets of another universal set \\Omega satisfying a set of axioms weaker than those of \u03c3-algebra. Dynkin systems are sometimes referred to as \u03bb-systems (Dynkin himself used this term) or d-system. These set families have applications in measure theory and probability. A major application of \u03bb-systems is the \u03c0-\u03bb theorem, see below. == Definitions == Let \u03a9 be a nonempty set, and let D be a collection of subsets of \u03a9 (i.e., D is a subset of the power set of \u03a9). Then D is a Dynkin system if # \u03a9 \u2208 D, # if A, B \u2208 D and A \u2286 B, then B \\ A \u2208 D, # if A1, A2, A3, ... is a sequence of subsets in D and An \u2286 An+1 for all n \u2265 1, then \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n\\in D. Equivalently, D is a Dynkin system if # \u03a9 \u2208 D, # if A \u2208 D, then Ac \u2208 D, # if A1, A2, A3, ... is a sequence of subsets in D such that Ai \u2229 Aj = \u00d8 for all i \u2260 j, then \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty A_n\\in D. The second definition is generally preferred as it usually is easier to check. An important fact is that a Dynkin system which is also a \u03c0-system (i.e., closed under finite intersections) is a \u03c3-algebra. This can be verified by noting that conditions 2 and 3 together with closure under finite intersections imply closure under countable unions. Given any collection \\mathcal{J} of subsets of \\Omega, there exists a unique Dynkin system denoted D\\\\{\\mathcal J\\\\} which is minimal with respect to containing \\mathcal J. That is, if \\tilde D is any Dynkin system containing \\mathcal J, then D\\\\{\\mathcal J\\\\}\\subseteq\\tilde D. D\\\\{\\mathcal J\\\\} is called the Dynkin system generated by \\mathcal{J}. Note D\\\\{\\emptyset\\\\}=\\\\{\\emptyset,\\Omega\\\\}. For another example, let \\Omega=\\\\{1,2,3,4\\\\} and \\mathcal J=\\\\{1\\\\}; then D\\\\{\\mathcal J\\\\}=\\\\{\\emptyset,\\\\{1\\\\},\\\\{2,3,4\\\\},\\Omega\\\\}. == Dynkin's \u03c0-\u03bb theorem == If P is a \u03c0-system and D is a Dynkin system with P\\subseteq D, then \\sigma\\\\{P\\\\}\\subseteq D. In other words, the \u03c3-algebra generated by P is contained in D. One application of Dynkin's \u03c0-\u03bb theorem is the uniqueness of a measure that evaluates the length of an interval (known as the Lebesgue measure): Let (\u03a9, B, \u03bb) be the unit interval [0,1] with the Lebesgue measure on Borel sets. Let \u03bc be another measure on \u03a9 satisfying \u03bc[(a,b)] = b \u2212 a, and let D be the family of sets S such that \u03bc[S] = \u03bb[S]. Let I = { (a,b),[a,b),(a,b],[a,b] : 0 < a \u2264 b < 1 }, and observe that I is closed under finite intersections, that I \u2282 D, and that B is the \u03c3-algebra generated by I. It may be shown that D satisfies the above conditions for a Dynkin-system. From Dynkin's \u03c0-\u03bb Theorem it follows that D in fact includes all of B, which is equivalent to showing that the Lebesgue measure is unique on B. === Application to probability distributions === == See also == * Algebra of sets * \u03b4-ring * Field of sets * \u03c0-system * Ring of sets * \u03c3-algebra * \u03c3-ring == Notes == == References == * * * Category:Set families Category:Probability theory Category:Lemmas ",
