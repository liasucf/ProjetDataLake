It is written and produced by Nomaan Khan, directed by Azfar Jafri, and stars Mikaal Zulfiqar, Hassan Niazi, Armeena Rana Khan and Sabeeka Imam. The film revolves around Pakistan Air Force. It is the 28th highest-grossing Pakistani film. Sherdil was a commercial success though it received mixed to negative reviews from critics. == Plot == The film opens during the year 1965, where two Pakistani F-86 Sabre fighters are doing a CAP (Combat Air Patrol). Squadron Leader Sikandar and his wingman spot three Indian Folland Gnat fighters flying in Pakistani airspace. The PAF (Pakistan Air Force) planes engage the IAF (Indian Air Force) fighters. Sikandar heroically gives up his life and crashes his plane into the final enemy jet. Fast forward to present day, Haris Mustafa (Mikaal Zulfiqar) who is the grandson of Sikandar Mustafa, and his best friend Fawad both dream of becoming fighter pilots. Haris's parents disapprove of his career choice. However, Haris's grandmother, widow of Sikander, is supportive of his ambitions. When Haris is accepted into the PAF academy, his father disowns him. At the academy, Haris and Fawad befriend Harijeet, a Pakistani Sikh and Irfan. During this time, Haris meets and falls in love with Sabrina (Armeena Khan). Two Indian Mirage 2000's enter the Pakistani airspace and Haris and Irfan are scrambled to intercept them in JF-17's. Haris engages in an intense dogfight with the Mirage, barely escaping with his life. Haris returns to base where he learns his grandmother passed away. Although Haris survived the air encounter, his superiors are disappointed that he almost lost the plane and his life. They reluctantly send him to the International Flight School. At the flight school, he encounters Flight Lieutenant Arun Veerani, a Mirage 2000 fighter pilot. Haris and Arun are initially very hostile to each other, but end up becoming friends. Haris returns and proposes to Sabrina. She agrees to marry him, but only if he remains with the PAF, as she realizes that she cannot let him give up his dream and passion for serving his country. Their honeymoon is cut short when political tensions once again arise between India and Pakistan, with the Indian armed forces threatening to perform surgical strikes along the Pakistan-controlled Kashmir area. Sabrina is horrified at the risk that Harris's life will be in, but he states that he must do what is required of him, to which she then gives him her full support. Haris and Irfan are sent on a CAP, when they encounter 2 Indian Mirage-2000's. During the ensuing fight, Haris comes face to face with a Mirage flown by Arun. Haris hesitates to shoot Arun due to their friendship, and then hears a distress call from his wingman Irfan who is now being shot at by another Mirage. Haris spares Arun, telling him to leave the area and flies towards Irfan, but is too late. Harris returns to Arun who tells him that this decision is \"out of his hands\" and tries to shoot Haris down. Haris comes up behind him, says \"Sorry my friend\" and shoots Arun's plane down. Upon his return, Haris is greeted by all the PAF ground personnel and his superiors and finds that Irfan has survived as well. To his surprise, his father is there to receive him too and is very proud of the way his son defended his country. == Cast == * Mikaal Zulfiqar as Harris *Hassan Niazi as Arun Verani * Armeena Khan as Sabrina * Sabeeka Imam as Sarah Francis * Samina Ahmad * Laila Zuberi * Ibrahim Alavi == Release == The film was released on 22 March 2019. === Home Media === The film had a Television Premier on Eid al-Adha, on 3 August 2020, on ARY Digital. == Reception == === Box office === Sherdil collected around 11.5 million on the first day, adding 17 million and 13 million on Saturday and Sunday, respectively, reaching up to 41.5 million by the end of opening weekend.
