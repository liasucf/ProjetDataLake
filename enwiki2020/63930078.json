Kennedy's assassination. ==Background== The soldier character, Mark, was written originally by Patrick for his Off- Broadway play in 1970 \"A Bad Place to Get Your Head\".https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/09/archives/the-odyssey-of-kennedys- children.html For the original cast, Mary Woronov was originally wanted for Carla. They begged Lily Tomlin to play Rona, and later asked Shirley MacLaine to play Carla, who after seeing the show, approached Patrick in the lobby, shook him, and said \"Why didn't you make me play Carla?\".https://www.papermag.com/gay-playwright-robert-patrick-2465836182.html Julie Newmar, who stated \"only I am Carla\", tried to pull him out of cab to convince him, but his boyfriend at the time won the tug-of-war. Patrick stated he regretted the casting of the replacement company, they hired Shelley Winters for the Chicago cast only, and she stated she didn't have to learn lines just improvise. ==Productions== Originally it premiered Off Off Broadway at the Clark Center for Performing Arts in 1973, starred Don Parker, and ran for three hours and forty minutes. With no producer, it wasn't staged fully for another year in 1974 in London's, King's Head Theatre, with Parker portraying Spranger and directed by Clive Donner.
