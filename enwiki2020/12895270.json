    "text": "Tambor\u00ed and keyed flabiol The tambori ( ) is a percussion instrument of about 10 centimetres diameter, a small shallow cylinder formed of metal or wood with a drumhead of skin. Its usual function is to accompany the playing of the flabiol in a cobla band, beating the rhythm of the sardana, the traditional dance of Catalonia. It is attached to the elbow of the left arm and struck with a little drumstick called a broqueta held by the right hand, while the flabiol can be played at the same time with the left hand. ==External links== *El testament n'Am\u00e8lia Video of a performance of this sardana (composer Joan Lamote de Grignon) by the cobla \"Comptat d'Emp\u00faries\" at the Castell\u00f3 d'Emp\u00faries. The flabiol player can be seen tapping the tambor\u00ed after playing the theme tune as an extended introduction. ==See also== *Pipe and tabor Category:Percussion instruments Category:Catalan musical instruments Category:Spanish musical instruments Category:Andorran musical instruments Category:Sardana ",
