The four puru\u1e63\u0101rthas are Dharma (righteousness, moral values), Artha (prosperity, economic values), Kama (pleasure, love, psychological values) and Moksha (liberation, spiritual values)., ; Cf. also ; M Hiriyanna (2000), Philosophy of Values, in Indian Philosophy: Theory of value (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, , pages 1\u201310 All four Purusarthas are important, but in cases of conflict, Dharma is considered more important than Artha or Kama in Hindu philosophy. Moksha is considered the ultimate ideal of human life.Alban Widgery (1930), The Principles of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, 40(2): 239\u2013240 At the same time, this is not a consensus among all Hindus, and many have different interpretations of the hierarchy, and even as to whether one should exist. Historical Indian scholars recognized and debated the inherent tension between active pursuit of wealth (Artha purusartha) and pleasure (Kama), and renunciation of all wealth and pleasure for the sake of spiritual liberation (Moksha). They proposed \"action with renunciation\" or \"craving-free, dharma-driven action\", also called Nishkam Karma as a possible solution to the tension. ==Etymology== Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha (\u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925) is a composite Sanskrit word from Purusha (\u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937) and Artha (\u0905\u0930\u094d\u0925). Purusha means \"primaeval human being as the soul and original source of the universe\".purusha Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany Artha in one context means \"purpose\", \"object of desire\" and \"meaning\".artha Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany Together, Purusartha literally means \"purpose of human being\" or \"object of human pursuit\".R Prasad (2008), A Conceptual-analytic Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, , page 125 Alf Hiltebeitel translates Purusartha as \"Goals of Man\". Prasad clarifies that \"Man\" includes both man and woman in ancient and medieval Indian texts. Olivelle translates it as the \"aims of human life\". Purusartha is also referred to as Caturvarga.Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby (2004), The Hindu World, Routledge, , page 4, Quote: \"There are four categories or life-ideals (caturvarga or purusartha) that usually are said to provide the framework for classical Hindu society\". ==Discussion== Purusartha is a key concept in Hinduism, which holds that every human has four proper goals that are necessary and sufficient for a fulfilling and happy life,See: * A.

(2013), Columbia University Press, Gale, Hindu dharma includes the religious duties, moral rights and duties of each individual, as well as behaviors that enable social order, right conduct, and those that are virtuous. Dharma, according to van Buitenen,J. A. B. van Buitenen, Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2 (Apr. - Jul., 1957), pp 33\u201340 is that which all existing beings must accept and respect to sustain harmony and order in the world. It is, states van Buitenen, the pursuit and execution of one's nature and true calling, thus playing one's role in cosmic concert. *Artha \u2013 signifies the \"means of life\", activities and resources that enables one to be in a state one wants to be in.John Koller, Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha as Human Aims, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 18, No. 4 (Oct., 1968), pp. 315\u2013319 Artha incorporates wealth, career, activity to make a living, financial security and economic prosperity.

Without prosperity and security in society or at individual level, both moral life and sensuality become difficult. Poverty breeds vice and hate, while prosperity breeds virtues and love, suggested Kautiliya. Kautilya adds that all three are mutually connected, and one should not cease enjoying life, nor virtuous behavior, nor pursuit of wealth creation. Excessive pursuit of any one aspect of life with complete rejection of other two, harms all three including the one excessively pursued.See: * Kautilya Arthashastra at 1.7.3\u20137; For English translation - Rangarajan (1987), Penguin Classics, ; * Ashok S. Chousalkar (2004), Methodology of Kautilya's Arthashastra, The Indian Journal of Political Science, Vol. 65, No. 1, pp. 55\u201376 The sastras, states Kane,P.V. Kane (1941), History of Dharmasastra, Volume 2, Part 1, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pp. 8\u20139 observe that the relative precedence of artha, kama and dharma are naturally different with age. Moksha is considered in Hinduism as the parama-puru\u1e63\u0101rtha or ultimate goal of human life. ===Tension between four goals of life=== Indian scholars recognized and have debated the inherent tension between renunciation and Moksha on one hand, and the active pursuit of Kama and Artha on the other.R. V. De Smet (1972), Early Trends in the Indian Understanding of Man, Philosophy East and West, 22(3): 259\u2013268 This has led to the concepts of Pravrtti (\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f, Pravritti) and Nivrtti (\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f, Nivritti), with the former meaning \"giving or devoting one's self to\" external action, while the latter means \"withdrawing and restraining one's self from\" external action in order to focus on one's own liberation. Artha and Kama are Pravrtti, while Moksha is Nivrtti.Stephen N Hay and William Theodore De Bary (1988), Sources of Indian Tradition, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 211 Both are considered important in Hinduism. Manusmriti, for example, describes it as, Indian scholars offered a creative resolution to the tension between \"action\"-filled life and \"renunciation\"-driven life, by suggesting the best of both worlds can be achieved by dedicating oneself to \"action with renunciation\", that is when \"action is without attachment or craving for results\". Action must be engaged in because it is Dharma, that is, it is good, virtuous, right, a duty and a moral activity, and not because of one's craving for the results or material rewards without any consideration for Dharma. This idea of \"craving-free, dharma-driven action\" has been called Nishkam Karma in Bhagavad Gita.Gerard Delanty (2012), Routledge Handbook of Cosmopolitanism Studies, Routledge, , page 465P Bilimoria (1993), Indian Ethics, in A Companion to Ethics (Editor: Peter Singer), Wiley, , page 73 Other Indian texts state the same answer to tension between \"pursue wealth and love\" versus \"renounce everything\" Purusarthas, but using different words. Isa Upanishad, for example, states \"act and enjoy with renunciation, do not covet\". ===Origins of puru\u1e63\u0101rtha theory=== The concept of mok\u1e63a appears in the Upanishads, while the preceding Samhitas, Brahmanas and Aranyakas commonly refer to k\u0101ma, artha and dharma as the \"trivarga\" or \"three categories\" of possible human pursuits. The Dharma\u015b\u0101stras and the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata are the first known sources that comprehensively present the notion that integrated living entails the pursuit of four goals or ends. Prasad (2008) states that the division between the trivarga and mok\u1e63a is intended to highlight the context between the social (trivarga) and personal (mok\u1e63a) spheres. The Sannyasa is entirely focussed on the pursuit of Moksha without violating Dharma. Baudhayana Dharmas\u016btra, completed by about 7th century BC, states the following behavioral vows for a person in Sannyasa,Max Muller (Translator), Baudhayana Dharmas\u016btra Prasna II, Adhyaya 10, Kandika 18, The Sacred Books of the East, Vol. XIV, Oxford University Press, pages 279\u2013281 Baudh\u0101yana also makes repeated references to the Sannyasa (ascetic) stage and its behavioral focus, such as in verses II.13.7 and 11.18.13. This reference, Olivelle states, is found in many early to mid 1st millennium BC texts, and is clearly from gnomic poetry about an established ascetic tradition by the time Baudhayana Dharmasutra and other texts were written. Katha Upanishad, in hymns 2.1\u20132.2 contrasts the human feeling of pleasant (preyas, \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092f\u0938\u094d) with that of bliss (sreyas, \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0947\u092f\u0938\u094d), praising the latter. The hymns of Rig Veda in Book 10 Chapter 136, mention Muni (\u092e\u0941\u0928\u093f, monks, mendicants, holy man), with characteristics that mirror those found in later concepts of renunication- practising, Moksha-motivated ascetics (Sannyasins and Sannyasinis). These Muni are said to be Kesins (\u0915\u0947\u0936\u093f\u0928\u094d, long haired) wearing Mala clothes (\u092e\u0932, dirty, soil-colored, yellow, orange, saffron) and engaged in the affairs of Mananat (mind, meditation).GS Ghurye (1952), Ascetic Origins, Sociological Bulletin, Vol. 1, No. 2, pages 162\u2013184; For Sanskrit original: Rigveda Wikisource; For English translation: Kesins Rig Veda, Hymn CXXXVI, Ralph Griffith (Translator) Scharfe states, \"there are abundant references both to the trivarga and caturvarga in Hindu literature throughout the ages\".Hartmut Scharfe (2004), Artha, in The Hindu World (Editors: Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby), Routledge, , page 251 ==Purusartha focused literature== Each of these four canonical puru\u1e63\u0101rthas was subjected to a process of study and extensive literary development in Indian history. This produced numerous treatises, with a diversity of views, in each category. Some purusartha- focused literature include, * On Dharma :These texts discuss dharma from various religious, social, duties, morals and personal ethics perspective. Each of six major schools of Hinduism has its own literature on dharma. Examples include Dharma-sutras (particularly by Gautama, Apastamba, Baudhayana and V\u0101si\u1e63\u1e6dha) and Dharma-sastras (particularly Manusm\u1e5bti, Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya Sm\u1e5bti, N\u0101radasm\u1e5bti and Vi\u1e63\u1e47usm\u1e5bti). At personal dharma level, this includes many chapters of Yogasutras. * On Artha :Artha-related texts discuss artha from individual, social and as a compendium of economic policies, politics and laws. For example, the Arthashastra of Kau\u1e6dilya, the Kamandakiya Nitisara,Kamandakiya Niti Sara MN Dutt (Translator) Brihaspati Sutra,Brihaspati Sutra - Politics and Government Sanskrit Original with English translation by FW Thomas (1921) and Sukra Niti.Sukra Niti Bk Sarkar (Translator); Chapter 1 verse 43 onwards - Rules of State and Duties of Rulers; Chapter 1 verse 424 onwards - Guidelines on infrastructure for economy; Chapter 1 verse 550 onwards - Guidelines on treasury management, law and military; Chapter 2 - Functions of state officials, etc Olivelle states that most Artha-related treatises from ancient India have been lost.Patrick Olivelle (2011), Language, Texts, and Society: Explorations in Ancient Indian Culture and Religion, Anthem Press, , page 174 * On Kama :These discuss arts, emotions, love, erotics, relationships and other sciences in the pursuit of pleasure. The Kamasutra of V\u0101tsy\u0101yana is most well known. Others texts include Ratirahasya, Jayamangala, Smaradipika, Ratimanjari, Ratiratnapradipika, Ananga Ranga among others.Alan Soble (2005), Sex from Plato to Paglia, , page 493 * On Moksha :These develop and debate the nature and process of liberation, freedom and spiritual release. Major treatises on the pursuit of moksa include the Upanishads, Vivekachudamani, Bhagavad Gita, and the sastras on Yoga. The Sanskrit Epics devote major sections on purusarthas,J. L. Brockington (1998), The Sanskrit Epics, Brill Academic, , page 2 and Introduction chapter in particular debating dharma.Daniel H. H. Ingalls (1957), Dharma and Moksa, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 7, No. 1/2, pages 41\u201348J Ganeri (2010), A Return to the Self: Indians and Greeks on Life as Art and Philosophical Therapy, Royal Institute of Philosophy supplement, 85(66), pages 119\u2013135 The ancient Tamil moral literature of the Tirukkural focuses on the first three of the purusarthas (Dharma, Artha, and Kama) without discussing Moksha, suggesting that \"the proper pursuit of the other three will inevitably lead to the fourth.\" The Nalatiyar, another work of the Sangam literature, too, follows similar philosophy as the Tirukkural. ==Ashrama== The four puru\u1e63\u0101rthas are often discussed in the context of four ashramas or stages of life (Brahmacharya \u2013 student, Grihastha \u2013 householder, Vanaprastha \u2013 retirement and Sannyasa \u2013 renunciation). Scholars have attempted to connect the four stages to the four puru\u1e63\u0101rthas, however Olivelle dismisses this, as neither ancient nor medieval texts of India state that any of the first three ashramas must devote itself predominantly to one specific goal of life.Patrick Olivelle (1993), The \u0100\u015brama System: The History and Hermeneutics of a Religious Institution, Oxford University Press, , pages 216\u2013219 The fourth stage of Sannyasa is different, and the overwhelming consensus in ancient and medieval Indian texts is that anyone accepting Sannyasa must entirely devote to Moksha aided by Dharma, with a complete renunciation of Artha and Kama. With the known exception of Kamasutra, most texts make no recommendation on the relative preference on Artha or Kama, that an individual must emphasize in what stage of life. The Kamasutra states, This text does not mention the ashramas however. ==See also== The four proper goals of a human in Hindu traditions: * Dharma * Artha * Kama * Moksha *Arishadvargas Other elements of ethical theories in Hindu traditions: * Ashrama (stage) * Yamas * Niyama * Karma Other theories on human needs: * Maslow's hierarchy of needs * Need theory * Metamotivation ==References== Cited books: * (fourth revised & enlarged edition). * * * * * ==Further reading== * Gavin Flood (1997), \"The Meaning and Context of the Puru\u1e63\u0101rthas\", In The Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101 for Our Times (Editor: Julius J.
