Little is known of his early life. He was born in London, the son of John Hall and his wife, Elizabeth.Robert L. Patten, \u2018Hall, William (1800\u20131847)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2016 accessed 27 Jan 2017 With Edward Chapman (1804-1880) he founded a bookselling and publishing business at 186 Strand, London in 1830, having bought out a small journal called Chat Of The Week. According to Robert L. Patten by 1835 they were publishing illustrated fiction and magazines issued weekly or monthly. Chapman is thought to have had the literary skills to be able to spot a saleable book while Hall had the business acumen to sell it. John Sutherland, The Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction, Routledge (2013) - Google Books In 1835 Chapman and Hall published Squib Annual of Poetry, Politics, and Personalities by the illustrator Robert Seymour. In 1836 Seymour proposed to William Hall that Chapman & Hall should publish a series of sporting illustrations by Seymour with short written sketches linking them together in some way. Further he developed the idea of a 'Nimrod Club' of sporting people having adventures as the framework for the sketches and illustrations. Chapman agreed that the work should be issued in monthly parts, with descriptive text by Charles Dickens. However, Dickens, then only 22, was not the first choice as writer. Charled Whitehead, the senior editor in the publishing house, did not have time to complete the work so recommended Dickens on the basis of his recently published and successful Sketches by Boz, also in a monthly periodical format. Eventually, this became The Pickwick Papers, and concerned the adventures of Samuel Pickwick and his friends. Following the suicide of Robert Seymour, Dickens suggested to William Hall that Hablot Knight Browne should be the new illustrator. In May of 1837 The Pickwick Papers sold over 20,000 copies and Hall sent Dickens a cheque for \u00a3500 as a bonus above the agreed payment. By the end of its monthly publications Pickwick was selling over 40,000 copies a month and Dickens received a further \u00a32,000 bonus with Chapman & Hall making about \u00a314,000 from the publication.William Hall on Sparatcus Educational Charles Dickens attended Hall's wedding in 1840, an event he fictionalized for Sketches of Young Couples which Chapman and Hall published in 1840. There Mr Chirrup (Hall) is described as having the smartness and \u2018the brisk, quick manner of a small bird\u2019.Arthur Waugh, A Hundred Years of Publishing: Being the Story of Chapman & Hall, Ltd., Chapman & Hall, Ltd, London (1930) pg 6 After Dickens spent many \"pleasant, playful evenings\" at their house in Norwood. Dickens also arranged for his friends such as Thomas Carlyle to be published by Chapman and Hall and for John Forster to become the literary advisor to the company. William Hall died suddenly at Chapman & Hall's office at 186 Strand, London in March 1847 aged 46. Charles Dickens was present at his burial at Highgate Cemetery. On Hall's death Edward Chapman's cousin Frederic Chapman began his progress through the ranks of the company, eventually becoming a partner in 1858 and sole proprietor on Edward Chapman's retirement from Chapman & Hall in 1866. ==References== Category:1800 births Category:1847 deaths Category:19th-century English businesspeople Category:19th-century publishers (people) Category:English book publishers (people) Category:English booksellers Category:Burials at Highgate Cemetery ",
