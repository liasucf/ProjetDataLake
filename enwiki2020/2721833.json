    "text": "State Route 106 (SR 106) is a Washington state highway in Mason County, extending from (US 101) in Skokomish to south of Belfair. The road was once a section of State Road 21 in 1915, which later became State Road 14 in 1923 and (PSH 14) in 1937 and in 1955. PSH 21 became SR 106 in 1964 and since, the Washington State Department of Transportation has arranged and completed minor projects to improve the roadway. ==Route description== State Route 106 (SR 106) begins at a 3-way junction with (US 101) in the census-designated place (CDP) of Skokomish, located north of Shelton. From the intersection, the road travels southeast to bridge Skobob Creek and curve north along the Skokomish River and Annas Bay to the community of Union. After passing Union, the highway continues along the southern shoreline of Hood Canal past Twanoh State Park to intersect south of Belfair. The roadway approaching the SR 3 intersection near Belfair was used by 6,100 motorists daily in 2007 based on average annual daily traffic (AADT) data collected by the Washington State Department of Transportation; AADT data from 1970 shows that 2,000 motorists used the same section of SR 106 daily. ==History== The first state-maintained highway on the current route of SR 106 was State Road 21, established in 1915 by the Washington State Legislature and Department of Highways and ran from Skokomish to Kingston. State Road 21 later became State Road 14, named the Navy Yard Highway, in a 1923 renumbering. During the creation of the Primary and secondary highways, State Road 14 became (PSH 14) in 1937. The Skokomish\u2013Gorst section of PSH 14 was later added to in 1955. The 1964 highway renumbering divided PSH 21 into SR 106, and . Recently, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has arranged and completed some minor construction projects along the SR 106 corridor. The first project replaced a culvert over Skobob Creek with a bridge; the project was completed in December 2005 and was located east of Skokomish. Later in 2007, WSDOT installed a traffic signal at the SR 106 / SR 3 intersection south of Belfair. The signal was tested on May 11 and the project concluded in July. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *Highways of Washington State 106 Category:Transportation in Mason County, Washington ",
