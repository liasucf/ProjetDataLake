The town has not been identified with certainty. Suggestions include the villages of Lefke and Capolova in northern Greece.Sophrone P\u00e9trid\u00e8s, \"Leuce\" in Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1910) The city was also mentioned by HerodotusHerodotus, Histories, \u00a77.25 and Strabo.Strabo, Geography, \u00a77.8.55 == The bishopric == Leuce had a bishop by at latest 381, when a Bishop Symeon of Leuce took part in the First Council of Constantinople. The Notitiae Episcopatuum of the 10th to the 13th centuries mention it among the suffragans of Philippopolis, the metropolitan see of Thracia, thus ruling out the identification of Leuce with today's Plovdiv in Bulgaria, although this identification has been proposed. Leuce is now listed in the Annuario Pontificio as a titular see of the Catholic Church. ==References== Category:Catholic titular sees in Europe Category:History of Thrace Category:Ancient Greek archaeological sites in Turkey Category:Archaeological sites in the Aegean Region ",
