He is a part of the record label Diynamic and founder of fryhide imprint (or in German 'Freiheit'). == Career == HOSH got into production because he wanted to know how the records he was playing were put together. HOSH says \u201cWhen it comes to producing, making music for me is like cooking \u2013 the meal / track gets better the more love you put in.\u201d Back in 2006, with his flatmate at that time Solomun & Stimming, HOSH was the first member of Diynamic, releasing successful records such as Oelckersallee EP & White Elephant. Following releases and remixes for imprints like Kindisch, Get Physical, Stil Vor Talent, Supernature, Freerange, Strictly Rhythm, Dessous, Tsuba and more. Being a vital part of the Diynamic crew, HOSH released his album in 2010 on Diynamic 'Connecting The Dots' an album made up of ten dance floor cuts which all exhibit a trademark Diynamic musicality; hint at HOSH influences up to this point and simultaneously mark out a path into the future of underground house music. HOSH broke into the music charts in 2010 with his EP Cash the Chord. Since, he's continued to remain a staple of Diynamic, playing pretty much weekly at Sankeys Ibiza for Neon Nights. Fast forwarding to 2013, HOSH presented a special consisting of 4 releases, 8 tracks on Diynamic calling it 'Forever Young' - HOSH says \"We all had our dreams when we were young. It\u2019s never too late to live them. This is basically what this special series is all about.\" Making highlights again, HOSH stepped up for the official remix of Sono's 'Keep Control' released in 2013 on Kontor Music. The release was a staple in Beatports top 100. HOSH then ended his Diynamic journey with his latest release 'Karma EP' in 2017 - becoming the #1 track in Beatport techno charts in 2017. Summer 2016, HOSH was invited by Heart Ibiza to host five exclusive dates with ROULETTE \\- boasting a unique audio and visual concept, the focus of the party was that of a futuristic roulette wheel. Inviting alongside him DJ pals, including Patrice Baumel, Matthias Meyer and many more. HOSH says \u201cHeart is a place on the island that really wants to be groundbreaking and always looks for fresh concepts\u2014I feel our ROULETTE idea has found the perfect home,\u201d he tells DJ Mag Ibiza. \u201cIf you come to one of our five events this year, you will find something that you don\u2019t find at any other party on the island!\u201d HOSH established his own imprint fryhide. Which was initiated with 'Stories From Sa Talaia' album, creating a mix which HOSH gave away as free download for his fans.
