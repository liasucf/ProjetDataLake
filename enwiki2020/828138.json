Shuri-mon, a historic site in Okinawa, is shown on the reverse. Expo 75 was conceived, in part, to commemorate the American handover of Okinawa to Japan in 1972. The theme of the exposition was the oceans, and focused on oceanographic technologies, marine life, and oceanic cultures. The motto was \u201cThe sea we would like to see\" (\u6d77\uff0d\u305d\u306e\u671b\u307e\u3057\u3044\u672a\u6765, Umi - sono nozomashii mirai). The event was located on the western end of the Motobu Peninsula, with a site area of 1,000,000 square metres (including sea areas). Thirty-seven nations participated, along with eight domestic and three international organizations. The keynote speaker on opening day was American author James A. Michener. The exposition is the given reason for the construction of the Nakagusuku Hotel. ==Expo 75 site == The site was divided into four \u201cClusters\u201d in which there were pavilions and exhibits: ===Fish Cluster === * Iran Pavilion * Sumitomo Pavilion * Aquarium * Dolphin Land * Expo Future Car (C.V.S.) ===Peoples and History Cluster === * International Pavilion No. 1 * Okinawa Pavilion * EXPO Hall * Hitachi Pavilion * Oceanic Culture Museum \u2014 Audio-visual hall, planetarium and exhibition hall displaying ships, carvings, and other cultural items from the Pacific Ocean area. * Mitsubishi Pavilion \u2014 Ride featuring underwater technologies * International Pavilion No. 2 ===Science and Technology Cluster === * World Ocean Systems (W.O.S) \u2014 Whale-shaped theater. * Mistui Children\u2019s Pavilion * Fuyo Group Pavilion \u2014 Featuring oceanic robotics and aerial garden. * U.S.A.

It was envisioned as a concept of how humans could live harmoniously on the ocean, and a prototype for marine communities. The Aquapolis was constructed at a shipyard in Hiroshima, Japan, and then towed to the Expo site. The facility was funded by the Japanese government, and cost 13 billion yen. It was thirty-two meters high, and had a one-hundred square meter deck. The Expo Transit System featured two types of automated, electric transport vehicles: The \"Expo New City Cars\" (KRT) ran on a 3.7 km track almost the whole length of the site, there were three stations. The Expo Future Cars (CVS) track was at the north end and connected the Fish Cluster with Expo Land via five stations. ==Post-Exposition == After the Expo was over, the site became Okinawa Commemorative National Government Park (\u56fd\u55b6\u6c96\u7e04\u8a18\u5ff5\u516c\u5712), also known as Ocean Expo Park. Most of the exhibits were removed, although the Aquapolis was retained as an attraction and eventually hosted four million visitors. As years passed, the number of visitors to the Aquapolis declined and it was closed in 1993. In October 2000, the Aquapolis was towed away to Shanghai to be scrapped. The Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium and Tropical & Subtropical Arboretum were later constructed on the site. == External links == *Official website of the BIE *Ocean Expo Park *Scrapping of the Aquapolis *Preparing Okinawa for Reversion to Japan: The Okinawa International Ocean Exposition of 1975, the US Military and the Construction State Category:World's fairs in Japan Category:1975 in Japan Category:History of Okinawa Prefecture ",
