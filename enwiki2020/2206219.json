    "text": "Damon Atkinson is an American drummer. He replaced Roy Ewing as the drummer of Braid in 1997 and stayed in the band until it disbanded in 1999. His playing style is often noted for being heavy on complex time signatures, sometimes going into polyrhythmic territory. After Braid parted ways he went on to be the drummer for Hey Mercedes with Todd Bell and Bob Nanna, and he briefly covered drums for labelmate Saves The Day when Bryan Newman left the band. He was the tour manager for Senses Fail until May 2007. He became tour manager for Thrice in Fall 2007. == References == Category:American drummers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
