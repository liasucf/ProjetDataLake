    "text": "The Area Festival was a music festival founded by popular electronic musician Moby, who asserted that he was \"in large part, inspired by the ethos of Lollapalooza\",https://web.archive.org/web/20040519225842/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1453647/04292002/bowie_david.jhtml and wished to create a similarly \"genuinely eclectic, interesting, alternative music festival\". Moby organized the first such festival, called Area:One in 2001, and the sequel tour Area2, in 2002. The festival is currently on indefinite hiatus. The festival featured diverse genres of music. Besides headliner Moby, the main stage mostly featured rock and pop acts. The second stage was an air-conditioned tent where electronic, dance and smaller bands performed. ==Acts== The 2001 Area:One acts included Moby, OutKast, The New Deal, Carl Cox, Nelly Furtado, Incubus, Paul Oakenfold, The Roots, The Orb and Rin\u00f4\u00e7\u00e9r\u00f4se. The 2002 Area2 acts included Moby and David Bowie in alternating headlining slots: as well as Ash, Blue Man Group, and Busta Rhymes. The festival also featured a DJ tent with a rotating list of artists. The main sponsors for the tour were Intel, KMX, and Pepsi. ==Area:One== This concert in 2001 featured: * Moby * Outkast * Kelis * The New Deal * Gwen Stefani * Nelly Furtado * Incubus * The Roots * Paul Oakenfold * The Orb * Carl Cox * Rin\u00f4\u00e7\u00e9r\u00f4se * Timo Maas * Kevin Saunderson * Derrick May * Juan Atkins Area:One Tour Dates Area:One was a three-and-a-half-week touring festival in the Summer of 2001. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Date ! style=\"width:150px;\"| City ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Country ! style=\"width:250px;\"| Venue |- | July 11, 2001 | Atlanta |rowspan=\"8\"|United States | Hi-Fi Buys Amphitheatre |- | July 13, 2001 | Columbia | Merriweather Post Pavilion |- | July 14, 2001 | Camden | Tweeter Center at the Waterfront |- | July 15, 2001 |rowspan=\"2\"|Wantagh |rowspan=\"2\"|Jones Beach |- | July 16, 2001 |- | July 18. 2001 | Mansfield | Tweeter Center |-, | July 19, 2001 | Holmdel | PNC Bank Arts Center |- | July 21, 2001 | Clarkston | DTE Energy Music Center |- | July 22, 2001 | Toronto | Canada | The Docks |- | July 24, 2001 | Clarkston |rowspan=\"5\"|United States | DTE Energy Music Center |- | July 25, 2001 | Tinley Park | Tweeter Center |- | July 26, 2001 | Saint Paul | Midway Stadium |- | July 28, 2001 | Denver | Mile High Stadium |- | July 31, 2001 | Mountain View | Shoreline Amphitheatre |- | August 2, 2001 | Vancouver | Canada | Thunderbird Stadium |- | August 3, 2001 | George |rowspan=\"2\"|United States | Gorge Amphitheatre |- | August 5, 2001 | Devore | Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion |} ==Area2== This concert in 2002 featured: Main Stage * Moby * David Bowie * Billy Talent in Toronto * Busta Rhymes Rhymes never played in Toronto - he was held up in immigration on the way in. * Blue Man Group * Ash Stage Two: * Carl Cox * John Digweed * Ti\u00ebsto * DJ Dan * The Avalanches * Dieselboy * DJ Tim Skinner ===Area2 Tour Dates=== Area was a three-week touring festival in the mid-2002. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !
