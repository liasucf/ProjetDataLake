    "text": "The Steve McQueens is a Singapore-based band formed in 2013. ==Line up== The band consists of Eugenia Yip (lead vocals), Joshua Wan (keyboards), Jase Sng (bass) and Anson Koh (drums). They have been invited to international jazz festivals and performed at the 2015 Southeast Asian Games closing ceremony. ==Origins of band name== The group relates their musical style of \"anti- establishments escapism\" to Steve McQueen's anti-hero persona. ==History== The Steve McQueens were formed in Singapore in 2013, with Yip as singer, Wan on keyboard, and Ben on bass, working at the Oriental Hotel as a jazz trio. Marcus Szeto then joined playing the guitar and Bobby Singh as percussionist. They did their first gig on April 23, 2013 at the Sultan Jazz Club. Jase (bassist) replaced Ben and Aaron (drummer) replaced Bobby, while Fabian Lim (saxophonist) joined the group. The group played regular gigs at the BluJaz Caf\u00e9, Marina Bay Sands, and other venues. They were featured on Late Night at Esplanade \u2013 Theatres on the Bay in January 2014 for their launch of Einstein Moments, their first album, and in March 2014 at The Singapore Jazz Festival. They were spotted there by veteran jazz funk producer, Jean-Paul 'Bluey' Maunick, founder and leader of the British acid jazz band Incognito. Bluey invited them to his Livingston Studio to record their second album, Seamonster. This was the first release for Bluey\u2019s record label alongside David Ranalli, Julian Fontenell and Ravi Chidambaram, Splash Blue.
