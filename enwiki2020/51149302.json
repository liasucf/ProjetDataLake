Contested over 129 laps \u2013 shortened from 200 laps due to rain on a 2-mile (3.218 km) speedway, it was the 15th race of the 2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series season. Kasey Kahne of Evernham Motorsports won the race. ==Background== Michigan International Speedway (MIS) is a moderate-banked D-shaped speedway located off U.S. Highway 12 on more than approximately south of the village of Brooklyn, in the scenic Irish Hills area of southeastern Michigan. The track is used primarily for NASCAR events. It is sometimes known as a \"sister track\" to Texas World Speedway, and was used as the basis of Auto Club Speedway. The track is owned by International Speedway Corporation (ISC). Michigan International Speedway is recognized as one of motorsports' premier facilities because of its wide racing surface and high banking (by open-wheel standards; the 18-degree banking is modest by stock car standards). == Top 10 results == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" |- !
