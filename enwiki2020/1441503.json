    "text": "Williams is the remnant of a lunar impact crater that lies to the south of the prominent crater Hercules, in the northeastern part of the Moon. The southern rim borders the Lacus Somniorum, a small lunar mare that extends to the south and west. To the southwest is the sharp-rimmed crater Grove. Little remains of the original crater, besides a low curving ridge. The rim has been nearly destroyed along the northwest face, leaving only a few ridges in the surface. The remainder forms an irregular horseshoe, with the western part attached to a series of ridges leading to the west. The interior floor has been resurfaced by basaltic lava, forming a flat, nearly featureless surface that is marked only by a pair of tiny craters near the northeast rim. == Satellite craters == By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Williams. {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Williams !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Latitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Longitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Diameter |- |align=\"center\"|F |align=\"center\"|43.5\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|38.2\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|7 km |- |align=\"center\"|M |align=\"center\"|41.2\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|38.8\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|5 km |- |align=\"center\"|N |align=\"center\"|42.1\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|36.3\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|5 km |- |align=\"center\"|R |align=\"center\"|42.5\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|38.3\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|4 km |} == References == * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
