Official Journal of the European Union. Accessed 2008-07-06 which has existed in Colombia since 1964. The ELN advocate a composite communist ideology of Marxism-Leninism and liberation theology. In 2013, it was estimated that the ELN forces consisted of between 1,380 and 3,000 guerrillas. According to former ELN national directorate member Felipe Torres, one fifth of ELN supporters have taken up arms. The ELN has been classified as a terrorist organization by the governments of Colombia, Peru, United States, Canada the European Union and Venezuela's National Assembly. ==History== The National Liberation Army of Colombia (Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, ELN) was founded in 1964, by Fabio V\u00e1squez Casta\u00f1o and other Colombian rebels trained in Cuba. Later, the ELN was headed by a series of Roman Catholic priests, exponents of Liberation Theology. Most notable was Camilo Torres Restrepo (1929\u201366), a well-known university professor (egalitarian and Marxist) who was openly critical of the what he considered grossly unequal income among the social classes of Colombia. His attraction to the radical ideas of Liberation Theology led him to join the ELN, a guerrilla army intent upon effecting the revolutionary praxis of liberation theology among the poor people of Colombia. Father Camilo was killed in his first combat as an ELN guerrilla, and so became the exemplar ELN soldier, to be emulated by ELN guerrillas and other liberation-theology priests from the lower ranks of the Roman Catholic priesthood. ELN guerrilla: Father Camilo Torres among the peasants of Colombia. \"Neither Surrender, Nor Deliverance\" reads the poster of the Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional at the National University of Colombia. In the years following its foundation, it brought together more students and young activists from cities than peasants. A social composition that distinguishes it from the FARC guerrillas, who are essentially peasants. In the 1970s, after suffering military defeat and internal crises, the ELN was commanded by the Spanish priest Father Manuel P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez (1943\u201398), alias El Cura P\u00e9rez, who shared leadership with Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez Bautista, alias \"Gabino\". El Cura P\u00e9rez presided over the National Liberation Army as one of its most recognized figures until he died of hepatitis B in 1998. He was instrumental in establishing the ideology of the ELN, a composite of Cuban revolutionary theory and liberation theology that proposes the establishment in Colombia of a Christian and communist regime to resolve the socioeconomic problems of chronic political corruption, poverty, and the exclusion of most Colombians from their country's government. The ELN guerrillas survived the heavy fighting in the Colombian Army's Operation Anor\u00ed (1973\u201374), and then reconstituted their forces, with partial assistance from the Colombian Government of President Alfonso L\u00f3pez Michelsen (1974\u201378), who allowed the ELN to break from and escape encirclement by the Colombian National Army. President L\u00f3pez Michelsen helped the ELN in the hope of initiating peace negotiations with them in order to end the civil war. After this, the National Liberation Army of Colombia resumed financing its military operations by means of kidnap for ransom and the extortion of money from Colombian and foreign petroleum companies and by taxation of the private Illegal drug trade of Colombia. The ELN did not participate in the peace negotiations conducted between the Colombian government of President Andr\u00e9s Pastrana Arango (1998\u20132002) and the FARC, yet did participate in an exploratory conference about possibly participating in peace negotiations. A Colombian government initiative towards granting the ELN a demilitarized zone in the southern region of the Bol\u00edvar Department was thwarted by right-wing political pressure from the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) whose paramilitary mercenaries conduct anti-guerrilla operations in that part of the Bol\u00edvar Department. == Activities == The U.S. State Department has listed the ELN as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, ostensibly because of its reputation for ransom kidnappings and armed attacks on Colombia's infrastructure. In April 2004, the European Union added the ELN to its list of terrorist organizations for those actions and its breaches of humanitarian law. The ELN has also occasionally operated with the FARC-EP and like FARC it has targeted civilians, according to a February 2005 report by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights: \"During 2004, the FARC-EP and the ELN carried out a series of attacks against the civilian population, including several massacres of civilians and kidnappings by the FARC-EP. There were occasional joint actions by the FARC-EP and the ELN.\"Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Colombia (word document).

Accessed 2008-07-06 In mid-2006, mutual rivalries between local FARC and ELN forces escalated into hostilities in Arauca, along the border with Venezuela. According to the BBC, \"the FARC have for some years moved to take over ELN territory near the Venezuelan border, and the smaller rebel army reacted by killing several FARC militants\". A statement posted on FARC's homepage accused the ELN of \"attacks that we only expected from the enemy\".Colombian rebels turn on allies. BBC News. Accessed 2008-07-06 The ELN's main source of income are businesses and middle class civilians in its areas of operation. To enforce these \"taxes\", they frequently take civilians captive to use as leverage. While the ELN uses the terms \"war taxes\" and \"retentions\" for these actions, critics insist they constitute \"extortion\" and \"kidnapping\".V.

Accessed 2008-07-06 According to Claudia Calle, spokesperson for Pa\u00eds Libre, a Colombian foundation for victims of abductions, the ELN is responsible for the death of 153 hostages between 2000 and 2007. According to Pa\u00eds Libre, ELN abducted over 3,000 people between 2000 and 2007 and currently still holds 240 people captive. On December 7, 2008 18 ELN guerillas surrendered to the Colombian army in the northwestern province of Choc\u00f3. ==Peace discussions: 2002\u20132017== ===Early contacts=== link=File:Marcha_20_de_julio_-_%22\u00bfY_los_secuestrados_del_ELN_qu\u00e9%3F%22.jpgPrevious contacts continued during the early days of the \u00c1lvaro Uribe V\u00e9lez government but eventually were severed, neither party being fully trusting of the other. Only in mid-2004 the ELN and the government began to make a series of moves that, with the announced mediation of the Vicente Fox government of Mexico, lead to another round of exploratory talks. On July 24, 2004 the ELN apparently abducted Misael Vacca Ram\u00edrez, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Yopal, though their reasons were not clarified. The kidnappers said that Ram\u00edrez would be released with a message, but \"Francisco Gal\u00e1n\", a senior jailed ELN commander who has often acted as an intermediary between the government and the ELN's high command, said he did not know whether the group was responsible. The Bishop was subsequently released by ELN members, in good health, on July 27, after his kidnapping had been condemned by Amnesty International and Pope John Paul II, among others. As far as is publicly known, he did not have any message to announce on behalf of the ELN. Eventually, the ELN questioned Mexico's participation in the talks, arguing that it did not have confidence in the actions of a government which voted against Fidel Castro's Cuba during a United Nations vote. This led the Mexican government to end its participation. ===Exploratory talks in Cuba=== In December 2005, the ELN and the Colombian government began a new round of exploratory talks in Havana, Cuba, with the presence of the ELN's military commander \"Antonio Garc\u00eda\", as well as \"Francisco Gal\u00e1n\" and \"Ramiro Vargas\". This was considered the direct result of three months of previous consultations with representatives of different sectors of public society through the figure of a \"House of Peace\" (\"Casa de Paz\" in Spanish). Representatives from Norway, Spain and Switzerland joined both parties at the talks as observers. The talks ended by December 22 and both parties agreed to meet again in January 2006.Colombia plans new rebel meeting. BBC News.Accessed 2008-07-06 After a series of preliminary encounters, the next round of talks was later rescheduled for early-mid February. During the February talks, which moved at a slow pace, the government decided to formally suspend capture orders for \"Antonio Garc\u00eda\" and \"Ramiro Vargas\", recognizing them as negotiators and, implicitly, as political actors. The move was also joined by the creation of what was termed an alternative and complementary mechanism that could be used to deal with difficult issues and matters that concerned both parties, outside the main negotiating table.

Both parties reiterated their respect for the content and spirit of all previous agreements, and that they would continue working towards the design of a future peace process. The Colombian government and the ELN intend to study documents previously elaborated during the \"House of Peace\" stage, as well as documents from other participants and observers.Declaraci\u00f3n tercera ronda formal exploratoria. Alto Comisionado para la Paz. Accessed 2008-07-06 Both parties expected to meet again after Colombia's May 28 presidential elections. On August 30, 2007 the ELN said that in the statement the dialogues in Havana ended without agreement because of \"two different conceptions of peace and methods to get to it\". ===Restored negotiations=== Colombian President \u00c1lvaro Uribe invited ELN Spokesman Francisco Gal\u00e1n for new talks about peace on April 3, 2008. The two spoke in the presidential palace. After the meeting Gal\u00e1n says the ELN will return to the negotiation table. The ELN released a press note shortly after that saying the rebel group \"does not share the views\" of Gal\u00e1n and dismissed him as their spokesman. The Marxist rebels did say they will continue to let Gal\u00e1n negotiate between the Colombian government and the rebels. On September 4, 2017, the ELN and President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia announced a truce to begin on October 1 and to last at least until January 12, 2018. From May 25 to May 29 the group had a ceasefire in order to allow for \"favourable conditions\" during the 2018 Colombian Presidential Election. The ELN said it hoped \"that this spirit of conciliation of the ELN is answered with a similar behaviour\" from the government. == Continued conflict: 2017\u2013present == === 2019 Bogot\u00e1 car bombing === On 17 January 2019, the ELN performed a car bombing at the General Santander National Police Academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The truck detonated and killed 21 people, including the perpetrator, and injured 68 others. It was the deadliest attack on the Colombian capital since the 2003 El Nogal Club bombing and the first attack on the capital since the 2017 Centro Andino bombing. The ELN accepted responsibility for the attack and justified it as a response to the bombings made by the Colombian government during the unilateral ceasefire. As a result of the bombing, President Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez announced on 18 January that peace dialogue between the Government of Colombia and the ELN was officially suspended. Duque also demanded that Cuba extradite the ten ELN leaders that found refuge on the island nation during peace talks and the reactivation of their Interpol Red Notices, and he criticized Venezuela for providing refuge for the ELN on the Colombia-Venezuela border. In response to the request, Cuba's Foreign Minister announced that Cuba would abide by the protocols of ongoing negotiations between both parties. === 2019 Venezuelan protests === The Redes Foundation denounced in the Colombian Public Ministry that armed groups made up of National Liberation Army members and FARC dissidents, supported by the Bolivarian National Police and FAES officials, murdered two Venezuelan protesters, Eduardo Jos\u00e9 Marrero and Luigi \u00c1ngel Guerrero, during a protest in the frontier city of San Crist\u00f3bal, on T\u00e1chira state. Other protesters were injured during the shooting. === 2020 ceasefire over coronavirus === In March 2020, the National Liberation Army (ELN) declared a unilateral ceasefire during the outbreak of coronavirus pandemic. == Relations == === FARC === On 26 May 2008 the ELN wrote a letter to the FARC secretariat, seeking cooperation with Colombia's largest rebel group to overcome \"the difficulties we are experiencing in today's Colombian insurgent movement\". The letter was published on the ELN website. On 27 June 2017, FARC ceased to be an armed group, disarming itself and handing over its weapons to the United Nations. ==== FARC dissidents ==== According to InSight Crime, the ELN and FARC dissidents allegedly met together in Venezuela to form a potential alliance in October 2018. Sources based in the Arauca department in Colombia provided the information, with reports that the groups would participate in illicit activity together. It was also alleged that former FARC commander Iv\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez participated in the talks with the ELN. === Venezuela === Since the 1990s, the ELN began to establish positions in the western border states of Venezuela. The ELN grew close to Venezuelan officials during the tenure of Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, with Ch\u00e1vez approving relationships with the group. InSight Crime also states that Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was tolerant of the ELN, explaining that \"ELN\u2019s expansion in Venezuela has been marked by the Maduro administration\u2019s inaction and even encouragement towards the group\"; according to the group, the ELN operates in at least 12 of the 23 states of Venezuela. The Venezuelan NGO Fundaci\u00f3n Redes has reported that the Venezuelan military had possibly armed ELN members. In 2019, ELN supported Maduro during the Venezuelan presidential crisis and said they \"will fight\" US troops if they invade Venezuela. ==== Tupamaros ==== The ELN has received support from the Tupamaro movement in Venezuela, a Venezuelan colectivo and political party. The Tupamaro movement supported the ELN's dialogue with the Colombian government, stating, \"The Tupamaro Revolutionary Movement, now more than ever, stands in solidarity with this sister organization in the historic struggle against the neo-Granadian oligarchy and Yankee imperialism. We strongly ratify all of our support for the guerrillas and the ELN High Command, in the process that is developed with the participation of the Colombian people in the resolution of the armed conflict and the construction of peace with social justice\". ==See also== * Terrorism in Colombia * Terrorism in Ecuador ==References== ==External links== * * ELN \u2013 Patrialibre.org * An ELN profile on BBC news * Rebel Leader's Daring Escape is Blow to Colombia's Government by Jeremy McDermott, October 2009 * UN High Commissioner for Human Rights \u2013 Colombia 2005 Report (Spanish and English) * Colombia's ELN Rebels Show New Vigour by Jeremy McDermott, BBC News, November 5, 2009 * Who are the victims? \u2013 The aftermath of violence in Colombia \u2013 (Former combatants in Colombia's internal armed conflict spent two years painting their experiences.
