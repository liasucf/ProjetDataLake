    "text": "Jad Wio is a French rock band, created in 1982 by Denis Bortek, with Christophe K-Bye joining later. Christophe K-Bye describes Jad Wio's work as \"a baroque, excentric, extravagant... universe\". During its history, the band has experimented with a variety of musical genres (batcave, rock, chanson fran\u00e7aise, electro) and themes: sado-masochism in their Contact album (1989), Blade Runner in Fleur de M\u00e9tal (1992), horror movies in Monstre moi (1995), without losing its consistency. Jad Wio's originality resides as much in its lyrics, written mostly in French by Denis Bortek, as in the inventiveness of K-Bye on the guitar and on the combination of wildness and theatricality in its live performances. == References == Category:French rock music groups Category:1982 establishments in France ",
