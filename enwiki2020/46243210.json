Hailing from the tough streets of the Riverside community in South Memphis, Durt Boi had to overcome many struggles and hardships, such as his father being incarcerated when he was only 9 years old. After suffering from the devastating blow of his father receiving a life sentence, Durt had to adapt to the instability of bouncing from home to home between his mother, grandma, and aunt. Longing for that missing void in his life from the absence of his father, Durt enlisted in the Military service after graduating high school. According to PledgeMusic, after serving a tour in Iraq, Durt was stationed at Ft. Lewis in Seattle (Tacoma), WA. Realizing he had a true talent with music, Durt and two friends started the group, \u201cThe Durty Boiz.\u201d From \u201905 \u2013 \u201809 the group released two albums, \u201cThe Connection\u201d and \u201cDurty Dolla: 1st Deposit.\u201d 2009 the group split up and Durt Boi returned home with his goal of pursuing a musical career.
