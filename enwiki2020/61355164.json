Her work is held in the collections of The Scottish Parliament Art Collection, Harvard Museum of Natural History/Herbarium, Glasmuseum Lette, Germany, The Heritage Collection, Clackmannanshire Council, UK and the Perth Museum and Art Gallery, UK. == Biography == Healy is an alumna of Edinburgh College of Art. She was part of the 2018 Edinburgh Art Festival with Biodiversity in collaboration with Glasgow artist and writer Alasdair Gray. She has had two more collaborative exhibitions with Gray including and developing the theme of biodiversity. Her work is often inspired by rare species of flora and fauna, some from the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands where Healy made a research trip to Charles Darwin Research Station in 2017. Another strand of Healy's research is highlighting obscure museum collections such as the Illuminating Letters exhibition at The Lighthouse, Glasgow Centre of Design Excellence, in which Healy highlighted the personal letters of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and combined and collaged text and imagery with personal correspondence that Healy had received from David Attenborough. For the Amazon series Outlander (TV series) she was commissioned to make specialist glassware. Healy currently works at Glasgow Sculpture Studios. == Publications == * Myth/Reality.
