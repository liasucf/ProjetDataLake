    "text": "The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade, first published in New York on April Fool's Day 1857, is the ninth book and final novel by American writer Herman Melville. The book was published on the exact day of the novel's setting. Centered around the title character, The Confidence-Man portrays a group of steamboat passengers. Their interlocking stories are told as they travel the Mississippi River toward New Orleans. The narrative structure is reminiscent of the late 1300s Canterbury Tales. Scholar Robert Milder notes: \"Long mistaken for a flawed novel, the book is now admired as a masterpiece of irony and control, although it continues to resist interpretive consensus.\"Milder (1988), 440 After the novel's publication, Melville turned from professional writing to became a lecturer, mainly addressing his worldwide travels, and later for nineteen years a federal government agent. ==Analysis== Manuscript fragment from Chapter 14 of The Confidence-Man. The novel's title refers to its central character, an ambiguous figure. He sneaks aboard a Mississippi steamboat on April Fool's Day. This stranger attempts to test the confidence of the passengers. Their varied reactions constitute the bulk of the text. Each person, including the reader, is forced to confront the placement of his trust. The novel is written as cultural satire, allegory, and metaphysical treatise, dealing with themes of sincerity, identity, morality, religiosity, economic materialism, irony, and cynicism. Many readers place The Confidence- Man alongside Melville's Moby-Dick and \"Bartleby, the Scrivener\" as a precursor to 20th-century literary pre-occupations with nihilism, existentialism, and absurdism. The work includes satires of 19th-century literary figures: Mark Winsome is based on Ralph Waldo Emerson while his \"practical disciple\" Egbert is Henry David Thoreau; Charlie Noble is based on Nathaniel Hawthorne; Edgar Allan Poe inspired a beggar in the story.Delbanco, Andrew. Melville, His World and Work. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005: 248. The Confidence-Man was probably inspired by the case of William Thompson, a con artist active in New York City in the late 1840s. ==Character list== * The Mute \u2013 A man in cream colors, a tossed look, a linty fair cheek, downy chin, flaxen hair.

After the transaction, The Cosmopolitan accosts him, and as he tries to get rid of him, defends his right to be a solitary misanthrope. Throughout the conversation, he shows broad knowledge of \"philosophy and books\" equal to his obsession with \"woodcraft and rifles\". * The Agent of the Philosophical Intelligence Office \u2013 A labor-contractor for teenagers. He tries to convince the Missourian Bachelor he should try the services of the Philosophical Intelligence Office. After the latter objects he had enough of teenagers, the agent makes an analogy between a child not having a beard but a beard will grow later, and a child who hasn't \"evinced any noble quality\" will yet \"sprout\" these qualities, \"for, have confidence, it, like the beard, is in him\". He also likens baby teeth to \"corrupt qualities\" in \"the man-child\", and \"the sound, even, beautiful permanent\" adult teeth to \"sound, even, beautiful and permanent virtues\". The baby teeth, like the corrupt qualities are \"thrust from their place by the independent undergrowth of the succeeding set\" of teeth or virtues. He also likens a teenager to a caterpillar, and an adult to \"the natural advance of all creatures\" - the butterfly. a teenager is like good wine in maturation. Saint Augustine and Ignatius of Loyola are given as examples of virtuous men, rascals in their youth. He succeeds in convincing the Missourian Bachelor to try a fifteen- year-old boy. * The Cosmopolitan, Francis \"Frank\" Goodman \u2013 A philanthropist, the Cosmopolitan tries to test the ideas of love evoked in the beginning of the book by the Mute, (the references to 1 Corinthians 13), first by arguing with the Missourian one should be warm and confiding with all members of humanity, then by testing the strength of Charlie Nobel's commitment to friendship by asking to borrow money, then by doing the same to the disciple of Mark Winsome, Egbert. The latter test leads to a long debate about whether helping friends leads to an end of their friendship, and if so, how. Finally, the Cosmopolitan convinces the barber momentarily to trust him to pay all the financial losses the barber will accrue for removing the sign \"no trust\", then does not pay for the shave. In the final chapters, he has a discussion with the Old Man about a warning in the Bible about \"an enemy\" who \"speaketh sweetly in with his lips\" but his intention is to tempt, use, and profit from you. * Charles \"Charlie\" Arnold Noble \u2013 Charlie tells the Cosmopolitan Frank he thinks the Missourian is worse than Colonel John Moredock. Then he tells the story of John Moredock. Then he invites Cosmopolitan Frank to drink together as they discuss the story. Charlie clearly tries to get Frank to drink too much. He agrees to be \"best friends\" with Frank, but turns cold after Frank reveals he would like to borrow money from him. Frank brings him back to his normal self by performing a ritual. * Colonel John Moredock \u2013 The Indian Hater. He wasted his life taking revenge on Indians for the murder of his family. He is a kind man and a good citizen outside of his revenge sprees. * Charlemont \u2013 The protagonist of the integrated fable told by the Cosmopolitan Frank. He is a young merchant of French descent with many friends. One day, he became morose and unfriendly to everyone, vanishes, and isn't heard from for many years. It appears he was bankrupt, but his strange behavior started several months ago. One day, he comes back, friendly and dressed in expensive clothes. Everybody wondered about events, then one friend asks about them several years later. Charlemont knew his ruin was coming, and didn't want to embarrass his friends into helping him, so he shunned them, and moved to Marseilles (France) so he made his fortune again, then returned, confident he wouldn't embarrass his friends. (The Cosmopolitan Frank stresses there is no moral to this story, it is merely an amusement.) * Mark Winsome, The mystic Master \u2013 a cold restrained. He accosts the Cosmopolitan Frank to warn him Charlie Noble is \"an operator\". He encourages Frank to think about what it must be like to be a rattlesnake. Then he scares an artist-beggar away with a cold stare. His disciple, Egbert, is the example of following his philosophy. * Crazy Italian beggar \u2013 A haggard seller of a rhapsodical tract. The Cosmopolitan Frank buys his tract and promises to read it. Mark Winsome, the Mystic Master regards him as a scoundrel. * Egbert \u2013 Mark Winsome's disciple. He agrees to do a theoretical exercise with the Cosmopolitan Frank: he pretends to be Frank's \"best friend\" Charlie Noble, and plays the scene of Frank asking for money. Egbert, following his master's philosophy, gives several reasons for not lending or giving money, and tells the story of China Aster as an illustration. * China Aster \u2013 The protagonist of an integrated fable. He accepts a loan from his friend Orchis with the aim of investing in his business to create more profit. But he doesn't have any business skills, so the money serves to bring about his ruin through unpaid interest on the loan. The devastation is so great, his wife loses her inheritance, his son misses school, and he dies of despair. (The moral of the story -- never accept a loan from a friend.) * Orchis \u2013 China Aster's friend. He wins the lottery, then pushes some of it in the form of a loan on his friend. * The Old Man \u2013 He sits in the middle of the Gentlemen's cabin, awake while others try to sleep, reading the Bible. He discusses the trustworthiness of the Apocrypha with Cosmopolitan Frank. He buys objects from the peddler-boy. He gets a \"Counterfeit Detector\" as a bonus for buying so much, and tries to use it to see if his banknotes are fake. The Detector is complicated. * The man talking in his sleep \u2013 A man sleeping in a berth in the Gentlemen's cabin while the Old Man and Cosmopolitan Frank have a discussion. His interjections in his sleep coincide with the subject of the discussion, attributing the quote from The Wisdom of Jesus, Son of Sirach to a description of the confidence man. * The peddler-boy \u2013 A boy dressed in rags sells items for protecting one's money from thieves on a steamer: a traveler's lock, a money belt. His sales technique involves showing the uselessness of the object just purchased to sell the next object. All his customers receive a bonus of a \"Counterfeit Detector\". ==Adaptations== The novel was turned into an opera by George Rochberg; it was premiered by the Santa Fe Opera in 1982, but was not held to be a success.\"Lost in the Desert\", New York Magazine, August 23, 1982 The 2008 movie The Brothers Bloom, starring Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Weisz, borrows some of the plot and makes numerous references to the book: One of the characters is named Melville, the steamer ship is named Fid\u00e8le, and the initial mark refers to these coincidences. ==References== == Sources == * Milder, Robert.
