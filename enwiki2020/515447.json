Janaki, for the movie Mahishasura Mardini (1959). However, he became a full-fledged singer only in 1974 when he sang in place of P. B. Sreenivas for Sampathige Savaal, who had till then sung for most songs picturised on Rajkumar, fell ill. Rajkumar sang the energetic \"Yaare Koogadali\" for the film which became widely popular during the time and is considered one of his best songs. Rajkumar has been credited for having sung across various genres and each rendition according to the mood of the scene in the film. In \"Yaaru Tiliyaru Ninna\" for Babruvahana (1977), a prosodic form of Kannada poetry that required the tone to be a combination of sarcasm and anger, he blended the twin skills of theatrics and music. For Nee Nanna Gellalare (1981), he sang two songs \u2014 \"Jeeva Hoovagide\" and \"Anuraga Enaytu\"\u2014 beginning both with the refrain \"I love you\", that is full of Carnatic gamakas. After the same tone in the refrain, they take on a life of their own with the form according to love and happiness in the former and love but a discord in the latter. He is known widely for his rendition of \"Nadamaya\" for Jeevana Chaitra (1992), a song based on the raga of Todi and with complex graces and strings other ragas as it progresses. He switches ragas with ease, and sings complex swara patterns like a professional classical artiste. For the rendition, he was awarded the National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer. His frequent collaboration with the composer duo of Rajan\u2013Nagendra gave musical hits such as Bangarada Hoovu (1967), Nyayave Devaru (1971), Swayamvara (1973), Sri Srinivasa Kalyana (1974), Nanobba Kalla (1979) and Chalisuva Modagalu (1982).

He sang a complete English song called \"If You Come Today\" (\"Tick Tick Tick\") in the movie\u2014Operation Diamond Racket in 1978. This song became an internet meme in India following Rajkumar's demise in 2006. In later years, he lent his voice to a few actors and sang background solos. For the song Deepavali Deepavali from Muddina Maava, he provided playback to S. P. Balasubrahmanyam. This was a rare occasion. \"Hrudaya Samudra Kalaki\" from Ashwamedha and \"Hey Dinakara\" from Om are the two other popular songs sung by Rajkumar for other actors.https://m.rediff.com/movies/2006/apr/17songs.htm He also sang Kalidasa shlokas such as \"Maanikya Veena\" and ghazal-based songs such as \"Sadaa Kannale\", \"Kanneera Dhaare\" and \"Yaava Kaviyu\".

It went ahead in accordance to the agreement that their fathers made following the latter's birth. Together, they had five children; sons Shiva, Raghavendra and Puneeth, and daughters Lakshmi and Poornima. Having lived a \"hand to mouth existence\" after marriage in a joint family that included 24 children in Madras, the family moved to Bengaluru in 1972, after Rajkumar began getting multiple film offers. == Abduction == On 30 July 2000, Rajkumar, his son-in-law Govindaraju and two others were abducted by Veerappan from the actor's palatial house at Gajanur . Veerappan demanded the release of his gang members who were being held in jail under a defunct anti-terrorism law. The event prompted a massive manhunt and threw the Karnataka government into crisis. The Supreme Court of India opined that it was \"unpardonable\" on the part of the government of Tamil Nadu for not providing security to Rajkumar, although they had information a year earlier that he faced a threat of being kidnapped by Veerappan. A Special Task Force (STF) set up to capture Veerapan had earlier warned Rajkumar against visiting the farmhouse, but his son Raghavendra later acknowledged that his father had not taken the threat seriously.Veerappan's prize catch. The Hindu (20 December 1998). After a total of 108 days in captivity, Rajkumar was released unharmed on 15 November 2000.

On 19 April, the government of Karnataka announced that a memorial would be made in Rajkumar's honor at Kanteerava Studios in association with the Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce at the cost 100 million. The blueprint of the memorial was cleared by a panel comprising members of Rajkumar's family, representatives of the Kannada film industry and the state government.

His fan clubs conduct blood donation and eye donation camps on the occasion of his birth and death anniversaries every year. ==Acting Versatality== It was observed that after 15 years into his career, in the mid sixties, when new young filmmakers were searching for actors who were less theatrical, Rajkumar had to undergo a transformation in his acting style and succeeded in proving that he could handle roles which were subtle, mellow and soft without the need for theatrical histrionics. He went on to be known for portraying versatile roles with elan. He was also praised for his ability to integrate the virtues of an actor with the power of a superstar without letting one erase the another by acting as a gulf between the mainstream popular movies and the artistic cinemas. It was also noted that it was his subtle acting prowess, spontaneous style and his flair to give the reel characters a real credibility which singled him out to the top and helped him to never be out of the running by withstanding the onslaught of time, age and the ever changing demands of celluloid world. Jnanapith awardee U. R. Ananthamurthy had noted that movies of Rajkumar were less melodramatic in comparison to the movies of his counterparts at that time in other languages\u2014MGR, Sivaji Ganesan and NTR.

When Rajkumar completed 200 movies in lead roles in Kannada films, P. Lankesh edited a special issue of Lankesh Patrike in 1988 titled Innooru Chitragala Raja dedicating to him. == Social Themes of movies == Rajkumar made movies against perceived social evils throughout his career - right from his first movie till the last movie. His debut movie Bedara Kannappa (1954) spoke about social discrimination.https://www.telugucinema.com/Bhakta-Kannappa-1976-Retrospective The 1957 movie Rayara Sose speaks against the evil practice of dowry. The 1958 movie Shree Krishna Gaarudi, which narrates the bickering and squabbling among the Pandavas for portfolios, allegorizes the politics in the then newly formed Mysore state.

His last movie Shabdavedhi (2000) was about drug abuse and its ill effects on the youth. == Mass Appeal & Popularity== Veteran journalist and writer Patil Puttappa had described Rajkumar as a natural strength of Kannada whose mass appeal was much more than any leader in Indian politics. He was also praised for confining himself to the Kannada cinema through a conscious decision. His movies were praised for showing consistent interest in building a Kannada society and not a Kannada nation as such. His presence was reported to have filled the void between the state and the nation which neither the litt\u00e9rateurs nor the politicians could accomplish. Some observers are of the opinion that his star appeal helped bring together the diverse regions of Karnataka. The state was carved out in 1956, bringing together different regions like Hyderabad Karnataka, which were areas ruled by the erstwhile Nizam of Hyderabad; Mumbai Karnataka, which has a strong Marathi influence; Old Mysore region ruled by the Mysore royal family and the hilly regions and coastal belt. Each region has a distinct identity within the state and Rajkumar was accepted as a Kannada icon across all regions. He spoke Kannada in a distinct way which had a universal appeal across the state. This was an important aspect since his career played out when the state's identity was still evolving. Rajkumar's movies were largely credited for creating a unified Kannada cultural space after the formation of the state. It was reported that before linguistic reorganization of the states, the default state border for the Kannada speaking population was the last point where Rajkumar films were distributed. He was considered as a strong symbol of Kannada identity. He had even refused to appear in a cameo for Amitabh Bachchan's 1983 Hindi movie Coolie. In spite of having appeared only in Kannada movies, he was reasonably popular amongst the non- Kannadigas too. His films have inspired many non-Kannadigas to learn the language. During the interview for promotions of 2.0, Rajinikanth had said that 10 MGRs were equal to 1 Rajkumar.https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v;=tFgL4FfRZ1w He has also remarked that the only autograph he has ever taken in his life is of Rajkumar. Rajinikanth had also said that Rajkumar was a combination of MGR and Sivaji Ganesan. After Rajkumar's eyes were donated as per his last wish, the eye donation in Karnataka was reported to have increased by 400%. The initial move to shift the operations of the Kannada cinema gradually from Madras to Bangalore has been credited to Rajkumar's home productions. As of April 2016, 71 books and 9 souvenirs have been published on Rajkumar. On the occasion of his 90th birthday, an audio-visual musical extravaganza fund raiser programme titled Raj Vaibhava was conducted in Greater Boston for the benefit of a retirement home in Mumbai.https://indianewengland.com/2019/03/celebrating-90-years-of-rajkumar- the-kannada-matinee-idol/ ===Politics=== Political analyst MK Bhaskar Rao had revealed that the Janata Party's J. H. Patel and George Fernandes had approached Rajkumar to contest against Indira Gandhi in the 1978 Chikkamagaluru Lok Sabha byelection but he refused saying he wanted to remain apolitical. The Hindu had reported that Rajkumar could have swept any poll effortlessly but had decided that the affection and love of the people should not be used to attain power.This 'Sarkar', hardly rules. The Hindu (8 November 2018). Retrieved 12 November 2018. It was also reported that Rajkumar declined to enter politics despite immense pressure as he didn't want to be used only as a weapon to defeat anyone and not for any positive contribution. He shunned publicity and politics all his life. He was also credited for protecting and promoting the Kannada language without opting for a political career. ==Lifestyle== Rajkumar was best regarded by Kannada audiences and the Kannada film industry for being a highly disciplined man in both his personal and professional lives. He practised Carnatic music for an hour each day in the morning and in the evening. He was referred to as Gaanagandharva. His punctuality is another noted aspect. Waking up every morning at 4 am, he performed Yoga and Pranayama, which is said to be the reason behind his physical and mental fitness. His Yoga performances can be seen in the first clips of his film Kaamana Billu.Yoga keeps Rajkumar going. The Times of India. 16 August 2000. His waist size was 32 at the time of his death. This fitness is attributed to his practice of Yoga. He shunned smoking and drinking both on screen and off. To avoid setting a precedent among his fans, he made sure that the roles he accepted did not require him to smoke or drink or utter swear words, and extended this decision to real life. His dress code always consisted of a simple white dhoti and shirt. He spent most of his vacations in his hometown, Gajanur, near the forest area where he was later abducted.Times of India \u2013 Gajanur awaits the return of the native. The Times of India. (12 November 2001).

Reminiscing his old days, Kannada director J.G.Krishna had revealed that Rajkumar was responsible for light boys being served food by the film production team after he came to know that they were not being served food on the sets and took initiative to make it mandatory for all Kannada film producers to bear the food cost of the light boys treating them on par with the employees of the production house.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Jp6wx7U6ydI&feature;=youtu.be A touching testimonial to his commitment to lead by example was that he had pledged his eyes in 1994 at the time of inauguration of Dr. Rajkumar Eye Bank and he rightly did so after his death in 2006. His act of eye donation was likened to the role in his debut movie Bedara Kannappa where he plucks his eyes in the climax to replace the bleeding eyes of the Shivalinga. ==Kannada language movement== Although Rajkumar rejected numerous offers to don the political mantle, he was able to influence the State's political fortunes without ever being officially involved in politics. However, his apolitical outlook did not prevent him from protecting and espousing the cause of Kannada and Karnataka. He had time and again advocated the cause of seeking primacy to Kannada, and hence was asked to lead a movement about making Kannada a compulsory language for primary education based on the \"Gokak report\", popularly known as Gokak Varadhi. He became actively involved in the movement and soon became the force behind the Gokak movement. He took a rally from Belagavi to Bengaluru and gave speeches about the importance of Kannada Gokak agitation. Millions of people gathered only to have a glimpse of Rajkumar and listen to his speech. The movement became such a rage that the government relented and made Kannada a compulsory language of education in Karnataka. == Filmography == ==Awards and honours== Stamp of Dr. Rajkumar in 2009 Rajkumar was awarded numerous State, National and International awards.
