Keramiek uit Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen 24 april t/m 15 augustus 2010,\" webtext at kunsthal.nl, 2010. == Reception == At the Studio Pottery website the Dutch Galery Carla Koch (2008) gave the following description of the motives in the work and motivation behind the work: :Van Leeuwen creates strikingly baroque objects, made up of many small prints of shells and fruit, which remind of the curio cabinets that were in fashion in the 17th century and admired by her. It was in vogue among the wealthy merchants of that era to collect new types of fruit and shells that were brought back by the VOC ships, in such cabinets. Van Leeuwen uses shells and fruit to make plaster press moulds, which are then used for producing large quantities of prints. From these prints she creates her objects, always using the pot or dish shape as a basis. Her objects are flawless both on the inside and outside, a ceramic tour de force. She uses dishes and pots with lids as her base shapes. In addition, she creates combinations of ceramic \"garnitures\", which were also common during the 17th century.\" == See also == * List of Dutch ceramists == References == == External links == * Official website * Leeuwen, Wietske van at capriolus.nl Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch ceramists Category:Dutch women ceramists Category:Gerrit Rietveld Academie alumni Category:Artists from Rotterdam ",
