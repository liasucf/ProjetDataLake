    "text": "Ignacio Varga is a fictional character who appears in the AMC television series Better Call Saul, a prequel spin-off of Breaking Bad. He is portrayed by Michael Mando and was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. Nacho is a quiet and intelligent member of the Salamanca drug organization. He cares deeply for the well-being of his honest, hard-working father, Manuel. He befriends Jimmy McGill after Jimmy helps clear him of kidnapping charges. When the Salamancas seek to use his father's shop as a front for the drug ring, Nacho attempts to kill Hector Salamanca, the family patriarch, by switching his medication, but this is discovered by Gus Fring, who runs the rival drug trade. Nacho is forced to be a mole for Gus within the Salamancas, which is further complicated when the cartel sends the shrewd Lalo Salamanca to oversee operations. == Concept and development == Michael Mando said that he had been approached through his agent from Better Call Saul casting directors about being in the show. After sending in an audition tape, he was flown to Los Angeles to meet with showrunners Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould and perform a screen test. For Mando, he said it was \"love at first sight\" in working with the pair in how well they provided direction and feedback, and was notified about getting the part a few weeks later. The character was first mentioned in the Breaking Bad episode \"Better Call Saul\". To prepare for Nacho, Mando spent time watching crime and criminology documentaries to understand the motivations of criminals, as well as catching up on the whole of Breaking Bad, which he had not yet watched in its entirety before. Mando considered Nacho to be \"extremely intelligent and patient\" and would be a character that would have growth over the course of the show. Mando said that the showrunners gave little direction to the character, and instead \"They wanted to see what I would bring to the character\", allowing him to develop Nacho himself. For part of that, he explored elements of Mayan and Aztec cultures to bring to the character. He also brought some of the superficial traits of his Orphan Black character Vic Schmidt into Nacho. Mando said that initially Nacho was going to have a larger role with Jimmy in the first season, being the season's \"big bad\", but as Gilligan and Gould wrote out the season, they made the character of Chuck McGill more of an antagonist for Jimmy, and so Nacho was placed on a slower path to be developed in later seasons. Mando said he felt this helped fit Nacho's character, waiting patiently for the right opportunity to make a move to get ahead. == Character biography == Michael Mando portrays Nacho Varga in Better Call Saul Little is known of Nacho's background before the events of Better Call Saul. While he spends some of his time helping his father Manuel with his upholstery business, most of Nacho's time is assisting in the Salamanca family's drug ring, which he does not speak of to his father. === Better Call Saul === ==== Season 1 ==== While attempting to represent Betsy and Craig Kettleman, a couple accused of embezzling $1.6 million, Jimmy McGill has a run-in with Tuco Salamanca. Tuco has Nacho and other associates drag Jimmy to the desert to kill him. Nacho believes Jimmy's plea that he is a lawyer and convinces Tuco that killing an attorney would result in police scrutiny of the Salamanca family's drug business, so Tuco lets Jimmy go. Nacho approaches Jimmy about stealing the money from the Kettlemans, but Jimmy refuses. He warns the Kettlemans, who disappear from their home. Nacho is the prime suspect and is arrested. He coerces Jimmy into helping clear his name and Jimmy locates the Kettlemans, which leads to Nacho's release. Nacho engages in a side deal with Daniel Wormald, who wants to sell pills stolen from the pharmaceutical company where he works. Daniel brings Mike Ehrmantraut as a bodyguard. When Nacho's payment is $20 short, Mike insists he pay the full amount. As Daniel and Mike leave, Mike explains that he knew Nacho was conducting the transaction without the Salamancas' knowledge and so had an incentive to make sure the deal went smoothly. ==== Season 2 ==== Daniel uses his drug money to buy a flashy Hummer. Mike refuses to participate in the next deal, so Daniel goes alone. Nacho takes the opportunity to learn Daniel's name and address. He later breaks into Daniel's house and steals the money back, along with a valuable collection of baseball cards. Daniel reports the collection's theft to the police, who discover an empty hiding place where Daniel hid the stolen drugs. Mike realizes his involvement will be uncovered if police continue to investigate, so he convinces Nacho to give Daniel the cards and $10,000 in exchange for the Hummer. Nacho is impressed by Mike's candor and coolness under pressure. As Tuco becomes increasingly volatile, potentially exposing the Salamanca organization, and the likelihood of his learning about Nacho's secret deals increases, Nacho decides to eliminate Tuco and tries to hire Mike to kill him. Mike instead arranges a scenario where Tuco attacks him in view of police, leading to Tuco's arrest and conviction. Hector Salamanca has Nacho take Tuco's place in the organization. Mike becomes fearful that Hector may discover his role in removing Tuco from the family's operations. He attempts to draw police attention to the Salamanca operation by hijacking one of the trucks used to smuggle drugs over the Mexican border, leaving the driver tied up at the side of the road and stealing the hidden in one of the tires. Nacho tells Mike that Hector covered up the hijacking by killing the Good Samaritan who stopped to aid the driver. ==== Season 3 ==== Mike's actions lead to Hector looking for other routes to smuggle drugs, and he considers using Manuel's upholstery shop. Nacho objects, but fails to change Hector's mind. In pleading with his father, Nacho reveals his involvement in the Salamanca organization. Manuel accepts Hector's initial payment after Nacho convinces him doing so is for his own safety. Nacho realizes Hector suffers from angina and decides to try to kill him by replacing his nitroglycerin with an ibuprofen placebo in the hopes of inducing a fatal heart attack. Mike advises Nacho that if Hector dies, Nacho should immediately take the placebos from Hector and replace them with the real medication so that the cause of Hector's death will not be obvious. Nacho succeeds in making the switch, but Hector does not die, so Nacho plans to shoot him. Before he can act, Nacho is notified to attend a meeting with Gus Fring, Juan Bolsa, and Hector. Bolsa informs Hector that cartel leader Don Eladio has decreed that since Hector's trucks are no longer viable for smuggling drugs, the cartel will make the transport of Hector's drugs via Gus's trucks a permanent arrangement. An outraged Hector has a stroke and falls to the ground unconscious. Gus performs first aid while awaiting an ambulance, and succeeds in saving Hector's life, though he remains comatose. Nacho takes the placebos from Hector and replaces them with the real medication. Gus seems to realize that something is amiss, but says nothing. ==== Season 4 ==== Bolsa tells Nacho that he and Arturo should run the Salamanca family while Hector is hospitalized. Gus pays for Hector's specialized care to the point where his mental faculties are recovered and he can move the index finger of his right hand. Gus reviews Hector's medical records and realizes there is no nitroglycerin in his system, meaning Nacho tried to kill him. When Nacho and Arturo arrive at Gus' chicken farm to pick up their next cocaine shipment, Gus springs an ambush and suffocates Arturo with a plastic bag. Gus reveals that he is aware of Nacho's attempt to kill Hector, and that if Nacho does not follow Gus's orders, Gus will inform the Salamancas. Nacho, Victor, and Tyrus fake an ambush site on a remote road, shooting bullet holes in Nacho's car, and shooting Nacho. Nacho succeeds at calling Leonel and Marco Salamanca (the Cousins) for help. They burn the car and take him to veterinarian Dr. Caldera, who succeeds in saving Nacho's life. Victor sells the drugs taken from Nacho to the Espinosas, a rival gang. Nacho falsely identifies the Espinosas to Leonel and Marco as the ones who attacked him. They attack the Espinosa compound, kill everyone inside, and recover the \"stolen\" drugs. Nacho sees that by wiping out the Espinosas, Gus has secured more drug territory for himself, but does not yet see the full scope of Gus' plan. Nacho goes to his father's house to recover, and Manuel takes him in despite being unhappy about Nacho's ties to the Salamancas. After recovering, Nacho takes on a more prominent role in the Salamanca organization, but also keeps a safe with cash and fake Canadian IDs for himself and his father. Nacho is surprised when Lalo Salamanca arrives to aid in running the business, and takes a stronger interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did. ==== Season 5 ==== Lalo's investigation into Gus's activities forces Gus to temporarily halt construction of his planned underground methamphetamine superlab. Gus threatens harm to Manuel to coerce Nacho into providing inside information on the Salamancas. Nacho tries to convince Manuel to move away, but Manuel refuses to leave. When one of the Salamanca drug houses is discovered by police and Domingo is arrested, Nacho sneaks over rooftops to recover the drug stash before police enter, which impresses Lalo, who begins to take Nacho into his confidence. Nacho then brings Jimmy to Lalo so they arrange to have Domingo released before he talks to police. Jimmy secures Domingo's release and assures his protection by making him a confidential informant for DEA agent Hank Schrader and having him reveal the location of Gus's dead drops. Lalo is pleased by their work, though Nacho warns Jimmy that when working for a drug cartel \"Once you're in, you're in\". Nacho reports Lalo's plan for Gus's dead drops to Gus, who unhappily accepts the loss of nearly $1 million to keep secret Nacho's identity as a mole within the Salamanca organization. Unaware that Nacho knows Mike, Gus directs Nacho to report to him. Lalo tries to warn Mike about Gus's ruthlessness, but Mike reminds Nacho that he warned Nacho about the risk he was taking when he tried to kill Hector. With Nacho's assistance, Mike poses as a private detective to feed the police information which ties Lalo to the murder of Fred, the money wire store clerk. Lalo is arrested under an alias and held without bail. He contacts Nacho and orders him to continue harassing Gus by destroying one of Gus's restaurants, which Nacho reports to Mike. Mike alerts Gus, who works with Nacho to destroy the restaurant, again keeping secret Nacho's role as Gus's mole. With Lalo threatening both his legitimate and illegitimate businesses, Gus plans to eliminate him. Mike provides Jimmy details on his investigation of Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, resulting in a judge granting bail, but setting it at $7 million cash. Jimmy collects the money from the Cousins at a remote desert site, but he is waylaid by gunmen as he starts his return trip. Mike was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus, and kills all but one gunman. Mike and Jimmy walk for two days, and eventually make their way back to Albuquerque. Lalo is released and Jimmy says he was alone when his car broke down, so he walked in order to avoid risking the money. Lalo says he plans to return to Mexico to avoid a trial. Mike briefs Gus about the attack and Gus realizes it was arranged by Juan Bolsa, who believed keeping Lalo in jail would be beneficial to Gus. Mike tells Gus that Nacho wants to end his role as a mole, but Gus refuses to give up a valuable asset. When Nacho drives Lalo to the same site where Jimmy picked up the money, Lalo realizes they did not pass Jimmy's car. Nacho and Lalo search for it instead of waiting for the Cousins to pick Lalo up. After finding the car where Jimmy and Mike pushed it over the edge of the road, Lalo orders Nacho to drive him back to Albuquerque. Mike calls Jimmy and tells him to hide his cell phone but leave it on so Mike can listen. Lalo arrives at Kim and Jimmy's apartment and as Mike trains a sniper rifle on him from a nearby rooftop, Lalo has Jimmy repeat the story of his desert trek. When Jimmy continues to say he was alone and his car broke down, Lalo reveals he found bullet holes in the car. Kim tells Lalo that passersby probably shot the car for fun and berates Lalo for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo leaves and orders Nacho to drive to Mexico, but not to the original pickup site. Nacho and Lalo arrive the next day at Lalo's fortified Chihuahua ranch, which Mike reports to Gus. Gus says he has sent gunmen to kill Lalo and that Nacho may be able to help. Lalo introduces Nacho to his family and friends, and Nacho receives a call instructing him to leave Lalo's back gate open at 3 a.m. Lalo takes him to meet Don Eladio, who blesses Lalo and Nacho's plan for Nacho to run the Salamanca drug business in Lalo's absence. Lalo is awake at 3 a.m., so Nacho sets a kitchen fire as a distraction. When Lalo goes to investigate, Nacho opens the back gate and flees, while the gunmen kill Lalo's guards and most of his family. After Lalo kills all but one gunman and forces him to call the middleman who arranged the killing to report that Lalo is dead, he looks around and realizes that Nacho is missing. === Breaking Bad === ==== Season 2 ==== Though Nacho never appears in Breaking Bad, Saul mentions him when Walter White and Jesse Pinkman kidnap and hold Saul at gunpoint before a newly dug grave in the desert to coerce him into representing Badger, who has been arrested for selling drugs. Believing Walt and Jesse were sent by Lalo he says in panic, \"It wasn't me, it was Ignacio! He's the one!\", but is relieved when Walt and Jesse's confusion confirms they have no connection to Lalo. The exact nature of the crime Saul pins on Nacho is not revealed. == Reception == Mando has received positive reviews for his portrayal of Nacho. David Segal, in praising Mando's performance through the fifth season for The New York Times, said \"[Nacho's] torment is all cinched down, everything roiling behind his eyes. [Mando] manages to convey Nacho\u2019s heartbreaking predicament without raising his voice, or asking for pity.\" == Notelist == == References == == External links == *Nacho Varga at AMC Category:Better Call Saul characters Category:Fictional career criminals Category:Fictional double agents Category:Fictional gangsters Category:Fictional henchmen Category:Fictional murderers Category:Television characters introduced in 2015 ",
