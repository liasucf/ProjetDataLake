A powerful anticlerical wave then agitated France. La Calotte appeared every week on 16 pages, half of which was illustrated with anti- clerical satirical drawings. The rest consisted of texts, songs, jokes, denouncing clericalism. The designers were Saint-Fourien, Asmod\u00e9e, A. Mac or Ch\u00e9rubin. In its first issue of 14 September 1906, the editorial explains: == Resumption of title after 1930 == Libertarian activist and free thinker Andr\u00e9 Lorulot took over this title in the 1930s. The designers who worked there were Armangeol (Armand Gros) who produced comic Bibles, satirical Lives of Jesus and History of the Popes illustrated with satirical drawings. During the 1939-1945 war, La Calotte changed its title to La Vague, still under the direction of Lorulot, who stigmatized the ties between the Catholic Church and fascism. La Vague denounces antisemitism. After the war La Calotte became the organ of La Libre Pensee. It was a monthly publication from November 1945 on. After the death of Andr\u00e9 Lorulot, H. Perrodo-Le Moyne became its director (May 1963). He writes articles and draws under the signature of P. Le M.. The title still exists on subscription. == La Calotte of Marseille == La Calotte (Marseille), No. 28, February 20, 1898.
