    "text": "Ethel Sargant (28 October 1863 \u2013 16 January 1918) was a British botanist who studied both the cytology and morphology of plants. She was one of the first female members of the Linnean Society and the first female in their council, as well as President of the Federation of University Women. ==Early life== Sargant was born on 28 October 1863, and was the third daughter of barrister Henry Sargant and his wife Catherine Emma Beale. She studied at North London Collegiate School under Frances Mary Buss at a time when all girls schools were considered an \"adventurous experiment\" and from 1881 to 1885 at Girton College, Cambridge. Her sister Mary Sargant Florence was a painter and feminist, while her brother Sir Charles Sargant was a senior judge. ==Career== A list of Sargant's publications is provided in an article in the Journal of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History. Sargant spent some years doing botanical work at home while she cared for her mother and sister, but she also worked for Dr. D.H. Scott at Jodrell Laboratory in Kew Gardens from 1892 to 1893. She worked with Margaret Jane Benson, head of the Department of Botany at Royal Holloway College, and travelled with her throughout Europe in 1897 to acquire equipment and knowledge to set up that school's laboratory.Joyce Harvey and Marilyn Ogilvie, The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: Pioneering Lives from Ancient Times to the Mid-Twentieth Century, Volume 1 (Google eBook), p. 116, Taylor & Francis US, 2000. To combine her caring responsibilities and academic pursuits, Sargant ran the \"Joderal Junior\" laboratory in the grounds of her mother's house in Reigate. She employed Ethel Thomas (1897-1901) and Agnes Arber (1902-3) as research assistants. For the following years she specialised in seedling anatomy, giving a course of lectures on botany at the University of London in 1907. In December 1904, Sargant was elected one of the first women to become a fellow of the Linnean Society of London, and she also became the first female on their council. After the deaths of her mother and sister, she moved to live at the Old Rectory in Girton village in 1912. She was elected an Honorary Fellow of Girton College in 1913 and was President of the Federation of University Women in 1918. She was the President of the Botanical Section at the British Association meeting at Birmingham in 1913. During World War I, she organised the register of university women qualified to do work of national importance, which was afterwards taken over by the Ministry of Labour. Ethel Sargant died in Sidmouth on 16 January 1918. ==After death== She bequeathed her botanical library and bookcases to Girton College. The Ethel Sargant Studentship for research into Natural Sciences was endowed by friends in her memory in 1919.Girton College Register 1869-1946, University Press, Cambridge, 1948 Some of the reprints and monographs she collected and bound by subject are now housed in the Plant Sciences Library, University of Cambridge. Her obituary was written by Agnes Arber. ==See also== *Timeline of women in science ==References== Category:British botanists Category:1863 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Women botanists Category:English tax resisters Category:Academics of the University of London Category:Alumni of Girton College, Cambridge Category:Graduate Women International Category:19th-century British botanists Category:19th-century British women scientists Category:People from Girton, Cambridgeshire ",
