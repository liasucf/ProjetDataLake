In 1943, he flew a mission to American troops in Italy to suggest that the Allies invade the Dalmatian coast of the Independent State of Croatia to prevent the country from falling into communist hands. He claimed the invasion would meet no resistance and that the Croatian army would establish a beachhead for them. The British subsequently held him as prisoner of war in Bari. After the war he worked for a period as an engineer in Venezuela. He was a frequent contributor to the Croatian emigrant weekly, Hrvatska revija (Croatian Review).http://161.53.245.120/WebCGI.exe?Tip=traziJ&srchfield;=7&searchdata;=700%3A000679%20or%20701%3A000679%20or%20702%3A000679%20or%20600%3A000679&Exact;=NotE&SelBase;=1&NaslovSF;=Babi\u0107,%20Ivan He secured a visa for Croatian writer Bruno Bu\u0161i\u0107 to come to Spain; Busi\u0107 was later assassinated.Profile , fokus-tjednik.hr; accessed 3 February 2019.
