Klein and his laboratory investigate clinical, genetic and cell biological aspects of rare diseases of the blood and immune system. By studying rare human diseases, his team is interested in elucidating basic mechanisms orchestrating the development and function of hematopoietic and immune cells. Furthermore, the team strives toward the development of novel cell- and gene-based therapeutic strategies. He discovered numerous diseases and conducted the first clinical gene therapy study for patients with Wiskott Aldrich syndrome. Klein co-founded the international Care-for-Rare Foundation for children with rare diseases. Care-for-Rare is a non-profit organization following the Leitmotiv \"From Discovery to Cure\". No child should be destined to suffer or die just because his or her disease is very rare, regardless of ethnic origin and the financial opportunities of his or her family. == Honors and awards == The American Society of Hematology honored Klein with a scholar award (1998) and the William-Dameshek Prize (2011).
