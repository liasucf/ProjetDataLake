It was originally licensed as the Coach and Horses, but the name was later changed to Victoria Inn. In 1903 it was acquired by W.J.Berghofer, who was responsible for building Berghofer's Pass at Mount York in 1912.How To See the Blue Mountains, Jim Smith (Second Back Row Press) 1986, p.85 Berghofer renamed the building Rosenthal, but it was eventually renamed Rosedale. It is now listed with the National Trust.Exploring the Blue Mountains, Hungerford and Donald (Kangaroo Press) 1982, p.129 Mead's Farm, about two kilometres north-west of Rosedale, dates back to a land grant of forty hectares given to Hugh Beattie in 1856. It was operated as the Kerosene Inn between 1867 and 1880, during which time it was used by the miners who worked at the shale mine in Hartley Vale. Some of its owners over the years were Louis Meads, from 1872, Captain George Stevens, and Captain Thomas Rowntree, who was an early mayor of Balmain. Like Rosedale, Meads Farm is listed with the National Trust.Exploring the Blue Mountains, p.130 ==References== Category:City of Lithgow ",
