    "text": "The vagrant darter (Sympetrum vulgatum) is a European dragonfly. The species takes its English name from its habit of occasionally appearing as a rare vagrant north of its normal range. However, it is likely to be under-recorded because it is very similar to the common darter (S. striolatum). The species is common in central and northeast Europe. It breeds in standing water. ==References== * *Fauna Europaea Category:Libellulidae Category:Dragonflies of Europe Category:Insects described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
