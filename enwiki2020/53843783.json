It contains evergreen rainforest and cloud forest at the lower levels, and p\u00e1ramos (high moors) at the highest levels. ==Location== The Tam\u00e1 is a prolongation of the Cordillera Oriental of the Colombian Andes. It is separated from the Cordillera de M\u00e9rida in the Venezuelan Andes by the T\u00e1chira depression, which more than 50 million years ago was a strait that connected Lake Maracaibo with the Orinoco basin. Elevations range from . Average annual temperature is . Average annual rainfall is . The Tam\u00e1 National Natural Park in Colombia and the El Tam\u00e1 National Park in Venezuela protect parts of the Tam\u00e1 Massif. The two parks together form a protected area of . ==Geography== The Tam\u00e1 massif is a set of folded mountain ranges with extremely steep topography. It contains the El Tam\u00e1 p\u00e1ramos (high moors) at an elevation of , Cerro El Cobre at and Cerro Jud\u00edo at . The mountains are mainly of limestone or sandstone rock, typical of the Guiana Shield. The Tam\u00e1 National Natural Park contains an waterfall one of the world's highest. The p\u00e1ramos give rise to rivers such as the Carapo, Chiquito, Quinimar\u00ed, Quite, Burguita, Burga, Nula, Nulital, Sarare, Cutuf\u00ed, Oir\u00e1, Fr\u00edo and Negro, which drain into the Orinoco basin or into Lake Maracaibo. The T\u00e1chira River, which drains into Lake Maracaibo, forms part of the border between Colombia and Venezuela. ==Environment== Tam\u00e1 has four types of natural environments: tropical rainforest, sub-Andean forest, Andean forest and p\u00e1ramo. The forests are included in the Venezuelan Andes montane forests ecoregion, which also covers the Venezuelan Andean cordillera. The vegetation between is dense evergreen rainforest of medium height with two or three arboreal strata. There is a well-developed understory and many epiphytes. Forest species include the colorful Lagenanthus princeps. In the p\u00e1ramos the plant species are of the genera Jamesonia, Oreobulus, Castilleja, Gentiana, Halenia, Pinguicula, Utricularia, Castratella and Vaccinium. Mammals include the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), tapir, lowland paca (Cuniculus paca), anteater and ocelot (Leopardus pardalis). The endemic wood sprite gracile opossum (Gracilinanus dryas) and Luis Manuel's tailless bat (Anoura luismanueli) are found in both the Andean Cordillera and the Tam\u00e1 Massif. Restricted range bird species in the Tam\u00e1 massif include T\u00e1chira antpitta (Grallaria chthonia), hooded antpitta (Grallaricula cucullata) and Venezuelan wood quail (Odontophorus columbianus). Tam\u00e1 harlequin frog and Helena's marsupial frog are endemic to the P\u00e1ramo de Tam\u00e1. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * Category:Andes Category:Mountain ranges of Venezuela Category:Mountain ranges of Colombia ",
