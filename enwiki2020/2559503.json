    "text": "Chorley railway station serves the town of Chorley in Lancashire, England. Since 2004 it has been linked with Chorley Interchange bus and coach station. It is on the Manchester\u2013Preston line. ==History of the station== The current railway station is a modern version from the 1980s that was built on top of the original station. The level of the old platforms can be seen under the existing station's two platforms which are connected by underpass. The initial station was opened on 22 December 1841 by the Bolton and Preston Railway (which later became part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway) and was subsequently served by the Lancashire Union Railway between St Helens, and from 1869. Passenger trains over this route (between Blackburn & Wigan) were however withdrawn in January 1960. Further work was done in 2016 and 2017 in connection with the electrification of the line between Euxton Junction and Manchester. A level crossing at the south end of the station has been removed. The signal box has been moved to Ribble Steam Railway at Preston . ==Current station facilities== Platform to platform connection is via a stepped subway. Wheelchair users may exit the station and use the sloped public footpath subway (Chorley FP 32) immediately to the south, this emerges at the foot of the Railway Pub, access is then via an entry off Friday Street. There are no toilets on the station and the nearest ones are in the bus station across the road. Chorley's rail services provide a link for the commuters of Lancashire to Preston, Manchester and Bolton. A chargeable railway car park is available to the south of the station. Ticket purchase & collection machines are available, one on Platform 2 (Manchester bound), and two in the ticket office. The ticket office is manned approximately 0630 - 1900. It was announced by the Department for Transport in December 2009, the line between Preston and Manchester, on which Chorley is situated, will be electrified \"Rail Electrification Gets Green Light\" The Guardian news article 9 December 2009 which should reduce journey times to Manchester by up to ten minutes. Timetabled electric services began with the May 2019 timetable, training and introductory services had been running from February 2019. ==Services== All trains provided by Northern Trains ===Northbound=== *2tph to Blackpool North *1tph to Sunday service is reduced to 2tph supplemented by occasional additional services to ===Southbound=== *1tph to Manchester Victoria (doesn't run after 19:30, but does all day Sundays) *1tph to (Monday-Saturday only) *1tph to Manchester Airport via Manchester Piccadilly From 26 July to 7 September 2008 the service provision to and from the station was limited due to major engineering work taking place to the north (to improve drainage in a cutting and remove a long-standing speed restriction). A rail replacement bus service operated to and from Preston, whilst many trains were diverted via Wigan. This period of disruption was blamed for the decline in passenger usage shown in the figures right. The direct Scottish service had been reduced at the December 2013 timetable change when most trains were diverted via Wigan to join the newly electrified line over Chat Moss.Network Rail - WCML Route Utilisation Strategy Network Rail A small number of peak services still operated via Chorley using Class 185 units thereafter, but these ceased at the December 2014 timetable change.GB eNRT December 2014 Edition, Table 82 First TransPennine Express used to run the service from Manchester Airport to Blackpool North but this was passed on to the new Northern franchise on 1 April 2016. Saturday and Sunday services were replaced by buses most weekends from May 2015 until November 2018 due to the late-running electrification work on the route.Manchester - Bolton - Preston route improvement works Northern website news article; Retrieved 2 August 2018 Weekend services resumed on Sunday 11 November 2018 after the completion of the electrification engineering work. ===Renovation and Electrification=== Chorley Railway Station 27 August 2018 undergoing electrification work Chorley Railway Station undergoing electrification work 27 August 2018 From June to October 2016, as part of the Manchester - Preston electrification scheme, the station has been renovated and the trackbed lowered slightly to accommodate the overhead wires. The subways roofs were also replaced, and both platforms have been rebuilt and extended to accommodate longer trains when the line opens to electric trains. During the rebuild, a temporary platform 1 was installed south of the former level crossing with access from the car park and no passenger trains called at weekends (services again diverted via Wigan). The badly delayed electrification work on the route (now running two years late) has seen further timetable alterations and rail replacement buses at weekends since the May 2018 timetable change. Some northbound trains now terminate at either Buckshaw Parkway or Preston instead of running through to Blackpool, whilst weekend engineering possessions saw buses replacing trains until November 2018. Electric service commenced on 11 February 2019 utilising Class 319 electric multiple units. The first electric running was a Virgin Pendolino on a test run during the night of 13 December 2018 ==Notes== ==External links== Category:Railway stations in Chorley Category:Former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1841 Category:Northern franchise railway stations Category:Buildings and structures in Chorley Category:1841 establishments in England ",
