In October 1999, the series resumed numbering with #18 and was intended to publish the \"missing\" issues, but the title was cancelled with issue #21.Quantum & Woody #32 (September 1999) at the Grand Comics Database * Unity 2000 #4\u20136 \u2013 Only three issues of this six-issue miniseries were published before its cancellation. == Alternative Comics == * Detour #2 \u2013 Publisher Alternative Comics solicited Ed Brubaker's Detour #2 in 2000, but it never appeared (the first issue had been published in 1997). In 2000, Brubaker promised that \"the stories that would have made up the next two issues are being worked on in my disappearing spare time, and hopefully the whole thing will be released as a book of about 100 or so pages in a year or two.\" Instead, Brubaker embarked in earnest on a mainstream comics writing career with Deadenders (Vertigo Comics), whose dystopic future backdrop was similar to Detour's. == Blackthorne Publishing == * Battle Beasts #5\u20136 \u2013 Based on the action figure line by Hasbro, this title was to run through at least issue #6. The final issue of the series was #4 and ended on a cliffhanger. * Nightmare on Elm Street in 3-D \u2013 An ongoing series written by Andy Mangels set to begin in August 1989.

Issue #3 contained the first part of the story, but that was the last issue of the series. == Charlton Comics == * Charlton Bullseye Special #2\u20133 \u2013 Issue #2 was to be an all-humor book set for release in February 1987, but later pushed back to June. The issue was to contain an Atomic Mouse story by Jim O'Donnelly and Mike Todd, as well as Steve Hauk's \"Emperor of da Universe\" and Bill Witz's \"Murth Man\".

Several trade paperback collections were cancelled due to the bankruptcy as well. == DC Comics == * Action Comics Annual #3 by Chris Claremont and Michael Golden \u2013 The original story for this annual was meant to be published in 1990. According to Amazing Heroes Preview Special #10 (February 1990) \"And the X-citing news is about the Action Comics Annual, due out this year. It's written by none other than Marvel Mutant Man Chris Claremont, and drawn by not-often-seen Michael Golden. Watch for it.\" An annual with this number was eventually released in 1991 as part of the Armageddon 2001 crossover event, but contained a different story and was written by Roger Stern.Action Comics Annual #3 at the Grand Comics Database * All Star Batgirl \u2013 This series was announced at the Toronto Comic Book Expo in 2006. Geoff Johns and J. G. Jones were planning to work on the first six issues, which would present a connection between Barbara Gordon and Arkham Asylum. According to Johns, the series would feature \"a mystery centering around Barbara Gordon's transformation into Batgirl,\" as in Batman: The Long Halloween. The title was described as not taking place in the continuity of All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder. * All Star Comics: \"The Will of William Wilson\" \u2013 An unpublished Justice Society of America story from the 1940s. A good amount of artwork from this story survived and has been reprinted in various publications from TwoMorrows Publishing. * All Star Wonder Woman \u2013 This series was confirmed at the San Diego Comic Con 2006, with Adam Hughes announced as writer and artist. Hughes intended to retell the character's origin story, and described his approach to the series as an \"iconic interpretation\" of the character, but explained at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International that that project was \"in the freezer\" for the time being, due to the difficulty involved in both writing and illustrating it himself. As of October 2010, a page on his website indicated that after the current Catwoman series ended with issue #82, Hughes would cease his DC cover work and focus on producing the six-issue All Star Wonder Woman series. * Ambush Bug: Year None #6 \u2013 A six-issue miniseries, it skipped issue #6 and concluded with issue #7 instead. There was an 11-month gap between #5 (January 2009) and #7 (December 2009). * Aquaman II miniseries \u2013 A miniseries by writer Neal Pozner and artist Craig Hamilton was published in 1986. A follow-up miniseries was planned, but cancelled due to Hamilton's difficulties with meeting deadlines. * Batman: Dark Detective III \u2013 In 1977, writer Steve Englehart and artists Marshall Rogers and Terry Austin collaborated on a run of Batman stories in Detective Comics #469-476. A six-issue sequel miniseries titled Batman: Dark Detective was published in 2005. Englehart and Rogers planned a third series of stories, but Rogers' death on March 25, 2007 caused DC to cancel the project. * Batman: The Art of Neal Adams \u2013 A collection of Adams' best Batman stories, including a cover gallery, was set for October 1992. Comprehensive collections of Adams' Batman work would later be released by DC beginning in the 2000s. * Batman: The Widening Gyre #7\u201312 \u2013 In 2010 Kevin Smith wrote a six-issue Batman miniseries called The Widening Gyre, drawn by Walt Flanagan. The series was initially planned as 12 issues, with a long break planned between issues #6 and #7. After issue #6 was published, Smith and Flanagan's work on their reality show, Comic Book Men, extended this planned break further than expected. It was decided in the interim to release the remaining issues as a separate miniseries to be called Batman: Bellicosity, scheduled for 2014, but as of now it remains unpublished. * Batwoman miniseries \u2013 A miniseries created and written by Dennis O'Neil was planned around the time of Batman's 50th anniversary in 1989. It involved a new Batwoman character described as having more of a motivation to fight crime than the previous Batgirl (Barbara Gordon) and possibly even Batman himself. * Before Watchmen: Epilogue \u2013 Originally solicited in 2013 as the conclusion to the Watchmen prequels, this one-shot was cancelled for unknown reasons. * Black Canary miniseries \u2013 A miniseries by writer Greg Weisman and artist Mike Sekowsky was planned in 1984. The first issue of the series was pencilled, but the project was ultimately shelved due to the character being used in writer/artist Mike Grell's high-profile Green Arrow: The Longbow Hunters series. Elements from the ill-fated project were used for Weisman's DC Showcase: Green Arrow short film. * Blue Beetle direct market series \u2013 Following the cancellation of Blue Beetle's general market series in the late 1980s, a direct market-only series was set to follow. Originally, the plan was to end the first series with issue #21. However, the planned follow-up was cancelled as well, due to the belief that there was no audience for a \"1960s-type\" character like Blue Beetle; as a result, the series ended with issue #24. * Blue Devil #32\u201336 \u2013 Blue Devil #31 was to be the beginning of a six-part storyline intended to revive the title, but it became the final issue of the series instead, presumably containing elements of the unpublished story. * Captain Atom graphic novel \u2013 A Cary Bates/Pat Broderick graphic novel was listed as \"upcoming\" in Amazing Heroes Preview Special #10, but was described as being on \"permanent hiatus\" in the following issue. * Captain Atom miniseries \u2013 A six-issue Captain Atom miniseries was planned to begin in July 1992. Following the events of Armageddon 2001 and Armageddon: The Alien Agenda, Captain Atom was to fake his own death and give up being a superhero, but still had to face the problems associated with his former life. Jonathan Peterson was to write and Michael Netzer and Art Nichols were to be the artists. * Checkmate Annual #1 \u2013 A 64-page annual was planned for 1989 featuring information about the fictional agency and its members, with a backup story involving the character Judomaster. * Comics Cavalcade Weekly \u2013 Dave Gibbons provided the cover art for an unpublished comic featuring Superman and the newly acquired Charlton Comics heroes. The series, a weekly anthology, was to appear in 1985 and also tentatively titled Blockbuster, but was presumably shelved following the launch of ongoing series for two of the featured characters, Blue Beetle and Question. * Crisis on Captive Earth/Crisis of the Soul \u2013 Originally proposed as a 12-issue follow-up to Crisis on Infinite Earths, this story involved the Corruptors as the main villains and was developed by Paul Levitz, Len Wein, and Jerry Ordway. Editorial issues led to the project's failure and it would eventually be reworked as Legends. * DC Comics Classics Library: Shazam! The Monster Society of Evil \u2013 A hardcover reprint of this Golden Age storyline was cancelled in 2009.http://captainmarvelculture.blogspot.com/2009/11/monster-society-re- print-delayed.htmlhttp://www.comiclist.com/index.php/news/orders-cancelled- for-shazam-the-monster-society-of-evil-hc * DC Comics Presents: \"In Homage\" \u2013 A Superman/Thriller story by Robert Loren Fleming and Keith Giffen that was to be produced in late fall of 1985. * DC Comics Presents Annual by Marv Wolfman, George P\u00e9rez, and Romeo Tanghal \u2013 The Teen Titans were supposed to appear in a DC Comics Presents annual planned for 1984. That year saw the release of DC Comics Presents Annual #3, but it featured Captain Marvel as Superman's co- star. The Wolfman story may have been used for 1985's New Teen Titans Annual #1 as it guest-starred Superman, although the artists were Ed Hannigan and Mike DeCarlo. * The \"DC Implosion\" \u2013 During the \"DC Implosion\", several DC Comics titles were abruptly cancelled, even though a number of the series had issues already completed and ready to be published. Eventually, DC Comics reprinted the stories in black and white to secure their copyright, under the title Cancelled Comic Cavalcade, though this was a limited print run and was not available for sale. A few of the stories were published in other DC comics titles, though some were re-edited prior to publication. * The Dead Lady of Clown Town \u2013 A Cordwainer Smith story optioned by DC for their line of classic science fiction adaptations. Elaine Lee and Michael Kaluta were the creative team slated to produce the story. * Firestorm: Corona \u2013 A graphic novel by Gerry Conway and Pat Broderick originally scheduled for Fall 1984 that was never published.

The main character is S.T.A.R. Labs technician MacKenzie Ryan, who possesses energy manipulation powers instead of superspeed. However, the book was removed from DC's schedule. A Flash series would be released the following year written by Mike Baron, starring former Kid Flash Wally West. * The Flash (vol. 3) #13 \u2013 In response to a fan question on its blog \"The Source\" 's Flashpoint Friday feature, DC announced that May 2011's The Flash #12 would be the final issue of the series. At the time, no other details were provided. * Freaks by John Byrne \u2013 Freaks appeared in a lithography plate published within the History of the DC Universe Portfolio in 1986. Byrne had originally pitched the series to DC, but the series for some reason never surfaced. With some changes, Byrne's concept fit in with his 2112 work to become the John Byrne\u2019s Next Men series published by Dark Horse Comics. *The Great Ten #10 \u2013 Although The Great Ten (by Tony Bedard and Scott McDaniel) was solicited and advertised as being a 10-issue miniseries, with each issue focusing on a different character, DC chose to end the series at #9 due to low sales. * Green Lantern: \"Emerald Twilight\" by Gerard Jones \u2013 The original storyline for \"Emerald Twilight\" (which was written by Gerard Jones and set to run in Green Lantern vol. 3 #48\u201350) involved a conflict between two separate groups of the Guardians of the Universe, and members of the Green Lantern Corps choosing sides. Though this story was advertised and even solicited, it was not considered interesting enough by editor Kevin Dooley, and was replaced with a different story (scripted by Ron Marz) that had Hal Jordan becoming Parallax and destroying the Corps. Jones' version of \"Emerald Twilight\" has not been published. * Green Lantern: \"The Image\" \u2013 During Len Wein and Dave Gibbons' run on Green Lantern in the 1980s, Wein planned to introduce a superhero called the Image whom he wanted to include in a potential spin-off. Despite being promoted in Amazing Heroes and DC's own preview comic DC Sampler, the character never appeared during their run. * Green Lantern Saga \u2013 A miniseries about the origins and history of the Green Lantern Corps, the Guardians of the Universe, and the planet Oa was planned for 1990. Science fiction authors such as Larry Niven were scheduled to write the series. Niven later wrote the 1992 one-shot Green Lantern: Ganthet's Tale. * Hellbent/King Hell \u2013 A two-issue miniseries and crossover by Rick Veitch that was planned for Summer 1989 and was going to tie into DC's mature titles at the time such as Green Arrow, Hellblazer, The Question, Sandman, and Swamp Thing. The story was to involve the aftermath of Lucifer's stepping down as a ruler of Hell, with one plot point involving the birth of Swamp Thing's daughter Tef\u00e9 Holland. A contract dispute with DC led Veitch to pull out of the crossover. * Holy Terror, Batman! \u2013 A proposed 122-page graphic novel by Frank Miller, announced in 2006, but no longer a project associated with the Batman character or DC Comics. In 2010 Miller has said that he is no longer working on the project. He stated in June 2010 that Holy Terror was in progress, but without Batman. The book was eventually released by Legendary Comics as Holy Terror. * Hybrid \u2013 An ongoing series was planned for the Teen Titans foes, the Hybrid, for 1993, with Len Wein as the writer and Art Nichols and George P\u00e9rez as the artists.http://www.titanstower.com/the-hybrid/ * Infinity, Inc.: The Generations Saga Vol. 2 \u2013 A hardcover book containing issues #5\u201318 and Annual #1 was solicited for release for July 2012,http://www.comicbookcritic.net/dc- comics-2012-graphic-novels-dc/ but was cancelled. * JLA/Avengers \u2013 In 1983, Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway were to be the co-writers of a JLA/Avengers intercompany crossover drawn by George P\u00e9rez.George P\u00e9rez interview, David Anthony Kraft's Comics Interview #6 (Fictioneer, Aug. 1983).

Plans for the book were eventually cancelled because of the problems that affected the JLA/Avengers crossover. * Metal Men miniseries \u2013 A 1984 miniseries by Robert Kanigher and Irv Novick would have involved the Metal Men starring in their own movie.

In addition, an Amazing Heroes Preview Special from 1989 contained a short blurb about a possible Shazam! series featuring Thomas' version of the character following his run in Action Comics Weekly.

Later, after cataract surgery restored his eyesight, Mayer returned to writing and drawing Sugar and Spike stories, continuing to do so until his death in 1991; these stories appeared in overseas markets and only a few have been reprinted in the United States. The American reprints appeared in the digest sized comics series The Best of DC #29, 41, 47, 58, 65 and 68. Sales on the \"Sugar and Spike\" issues of The Best of DC were strong enough that DC announced plans for a new ongoing series featuring the characters. The project was never launched for unknown reasons. * Superman 3-D \u2013 According to DC's promotional giveaway brochure DC Releases #46 (March 1988), a Superman 3-D one-shot was planned for 1988. It was to be written and pencilled by John Byrne and inked by Ty Templeton with 3-D effects by Ray Zone. A \"major new Superman foe\" named \"Tantrum\" was to have been introduced.

Following a contract dispute with DC, Veitch instead decided not to stay on the book past issue #92. Then, Veitch's story for issue #88 (where Swamp Thing meets Jesus Christ during a time travel story arc) was cancelled by DC Comics due to their fear of controversy from religious groups; this caused Veitch to quit the title altogether before finishing the storyline, which another writer (Doug Wheeler) had to take over. * Swamp Thing (vol. 2) by Neil Gaiman and Jamie Delano \u2013 Gaiman and Delano were set to take over writing the ongoing Swamp Thing series following Rick Veitch's run on the book, but bowed out after the controversy over Veitch's Swamp Thing #88.

The series imagined a dark future where various superhero clans warred for global dominance. Moore's split with DC, as well as the very dark nature of the story, meant that the series never got beyond the proposal stage, although a number of story elements that Moore had suggested were later worked into ongoing series.
