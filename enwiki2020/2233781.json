The engine, depending upon additional equipment and specific model, weighs from . It is one of GE's most successful and longest in service military jet engines, with the civilian versions having logged over 16.5 million hours of operation. The United States Air Force plans to continue using the J85 in aircraft through 2040. Civilian models, known as the CJ610, are similar but supplied without an afterburner, while the CF700 adds a rear- mounted fan for improved fuel economy. ==Design and development== The J85 was originally designed to power a large decoy missile, the McDonnell ADM-20 Quail. The Quail was designed to be released from a B-52 Stratofortress in- flight and fly for long distances in formation with the launch aircraft, multiplying the number of targets facing the SA-2 surface-to-air missile operators on the ground. This mission demanded a small engine that could nevertheless provide enough power to keep up with the jet bomber. Like the similar Armstrong Siddeley Viper being built in England, the engine on a Quail drone had no need to last for extended periods of time, so therefore could be built of low-quality materials. The fit was a success on the Quail, but again like the Viper it was later built with normal grade materials and subsequently used to power small jet aircraft, including the Northrop T-38 Talon, Northrop F-5, Canadair CT-114 Tutor, and Cessna A-37 Dragonfly light attack aircraft. More recently, J85s have powered the Scaled Composites White Knight aircraft, the carrier for the Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne spacecraft, and the Me 262 Project. The basic engine design is quite small, about in diameter, and long. It features an eight-stage axial-flow compressor powered by two turbine stages, and is capable of generating up to of dry thrust, or more with an afterburner. At full throttle at sea level, this engine, without afterburner, consumes approximately of fuel per hour. At cruise altitude and power, it consumes approximately per hour. Several variants were produced. The J85-21 variant added a stage ahead of the base 8-stage compressor for a total of 9 stages, improving thrust. More than 12,000 J85 engines had been built by the time production ended in 1988. ===Iranian reverse engineering=== The Iranian Ministry of Defense constructed a new engine based on the General Electric J85 named \"OWJ\". The engine was presented at a defense exhibition on 22 August 2016. the owj engine has a dry thrust of .https://jangaavaran.ir/%D9%85%D9%88%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%87%D9%88%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%A7-%D8%B1%D8%A7/ ==Variants== ;J85-GE-1: thrust ;J85-GE-2: thrust ;J85-GE-3: thrust ;J85-GE-4: thrust ;J85-GE-5: thrust, afterburning thrust ;J85-GE-5A: afterburning thrust ;J85-GE-7: thrust ;J85-GE-12: ;J85-GE-13:, thrust ;J85-GE-15: thrust ;J85-CAN-15:Orenda manufactured J85-GE-15 for the Canadair CF-116 thrust ;J85-GE-17A: thrust ;J85-GE-19: ;J85-GE-21: military thrust; afterburning thrust. ;J85-GE-J1A: thrust ;J85-GE-J2: military version of the CJ610, similar to the GE-7, thrust. ;J85-GE-J4: ;J85-CAN-40:Manufactured by Orenda for the Canadair CT-114 Tutor, thrust ==Applications== Scaled Composites White Knight sporting two General Electric J85 afterburning engines * Boom Technology XB-1 \"Baby Boom\" demonstrator * Canadair CL-41 Tutor * Canadair CF-5 * Cessna A-37 Dragonfly * Fairchild C-123 Provider * Fairchild AC-119K * Fiat G.91Y * Lockheed Have Blue * McDonnell ADM-20 Quail decoy missile * Ryan MQM-34D Mod II target drone * North American OV-10B(Z) Bronco * North American T-2 Buckeye * Northrop F-5 * Northrop T-38 Talon * Ryan XV-5 Vertifan * Saab 105\u00d6 * Scaled Composites White Knight * Viper Aircraft Viperjet MKII ===Other=== * American Challenge water speed record jet-powered boat - Two J85-GE-21s400 Mph On Water - Popular Mechanics ==Specifications== A J85-GE-17A engine sectioned for display ==See also== ==References== * ==External links== *GE J85 product page *J85 picture *\"G.E.'s Small Turbojet\" a 1959 Flight article J85 Category:1950s turbojet engines ",
