    "text": "Erambie Mission is an Aboriginal community located on the western banks of the Lachlan River, 2.5 kilometres (1.5 miles) from the town of Cowra, in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia. The mission is laid out along three streets in a grid of tightly packed houses, but it contains no shops or library. It became home for most of the 700 Aboriginal people in the Cowra area. Residents had to obey many rules and regulations, and as far back as the 1940s the mission had a reputation for Aboriginal protests, and for its residents standing up for their rights. == Prominent residents == *Harry Wedge *Harry Williams *Isabel Coe *Paul Coe *Jenny Munro *Elsie Heiss, mother of Anita Heiss == References == Category:Aboriginal communities in New South Wales Category:Australian Aboriginal missions Category:Wiradjuri ",
