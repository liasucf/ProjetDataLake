While Colvin has been a solo recording artist for decades, she is best known for her 1997 Grammy Award-winning song \"Sunny Came Home\". ==Early life== Colvin was born Shawna Lee Colvin in Vermillion, South Dakota, and spent her youth in Carbondale, Illinois and London, Ontario, Canada. She is the second of four children. She learned to play guitar at the age of 10 and grew up listening to her father's collection of music, which included artists such as Pete Seeger and the Kingston Trio. ==Career== Her first paid gig came just after she started college at Southern Illinois University. With a strip of bars down the main street it wasn't difficult to find a gig. \"For $30 I played four 45-minute sets.\" For the next year she was either playing somewhere or sitting in with someone else and started attracting a local following. Broadening her horizons, Colvin put a band together that featured Dennis Conroy (formerly with the popular Chicago band The Cryan\u2019 Shames), Jack O\u2019Boyle on guitar and Brian Sandstrom on bass. For six months they expanded their base throughout Illinois. But Colvin's personal demons coupled with drug and alcohol use curtailed their success. Her next shot came with the Dixie Diesels, a Carbondale country-swing outfit. They were short a girl singer and she jumped at the opportunity. The band had decided if they were going to make it, Carbondale was not the place and planned to relocate to Austin. This was Colvin's ticket out of that charmless city.Shawn Colvin autobiography Diamond in the Rough, pages 49\u201357 She then entered \"the folk circuit in and Berkeley\", CaliforniaKoster, Rick (2000) Texas Music, First St. Martin's Griffin, page 219, retrieved May 25, 2012 before straining her vocal cords and taking a sabbatical at the age of 24.
