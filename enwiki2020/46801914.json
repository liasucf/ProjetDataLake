    "text": "\u03b2-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b2-MSH) is an endogenous peptide hormone and neuropeptide. It is a melanocortin, specifically, one of the three types of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), and is produced from proopiomelanocortin (POMC). It is an agonist of the MC1, MC3, MC4, and MC5 receptors. B-melanocyte-stimulating hormone(hBMSH) is artificially generated because it does not exist in humans naturally. B-melanocyte-stimulating hormone is also known to decrease food intake in animals such as rats, chicken due to the effect of Proopiomelanocortin (POMC). Research was performed to see the effect B-MSH has on chicks, and it has been found that chicks responded with a decrease in food and water intake when treated with B-MSH. The experiment showed that B-MSH causes anorexigenic effects in chicks. ==See also== * \u03b1-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone * \u03b3-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone * Adrenocorticotropic hormone ==References== Category:Human hormones Category:Melanocortin receptor agonists Category:Peptide hormones ",
