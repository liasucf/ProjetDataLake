    "text": "The Siege of Fuenterrab\u00eda was a siege of the northern Spanish city of Fuenterrab\u00eda. Wishing to regain his kingdom from Ferdinand the Catholic, Henry II of Navarre had taken the city with French assistance in 1521 after a 12-day siege and occupied its castle. The forces of the Kingdom of Castile besieged it again in 1523 and it surrendered the following year after negotiating an amnesty from Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. ==External links== *http://www.hondarribia.org/ category:Sieges of the Italian Wars category:Battles involving Spain category:Conflicts in 1523 category:Conflicts in 1524 ",
