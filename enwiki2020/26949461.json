The company received a license from the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam on 16 October 2009 and was due to operate freight services in Vietnam and on international routes. Before getting official approval, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung agreed with the recommendation by the Ministry of Transport of Vietnam to allow Tr\u00e3i Thi\u00ean to provide air cargo transport services. Tr\u00e3i Thi\u00ean Air Cargo focused on the domestic cargo market but the company wanted to operate the services between Noi Bai International Airport in Hanoi and Northeast Asia; between Tan Son Nhat International Airport in Ho Chi Minh City and Southeast Asia. If operated as planned, it would had been the first Vietnamese private company licensed to provide air cargo transport services with 2 leased Boeing 737-300F. The company is a branch of the Tr\u00e3i Thi\u00ean Group, which was working to open an office in California to pave the way for its direct goods transport service between Vietnam and the U.S. Despite an official start in June 2010, the company delayed the first revenue flights in early September then to late November. Trai Thien\u2019s Deputy Director Le Giang Long admitted that the airline is already meeting some financial difficulties, which has led to the tardiness in paying salaries to labourers and finding new contracts. On December 5, 2011, the Ministry of Transportation withdrew the operating license of Trai Thien, with no single flight ever made. ==References== Category:Defunct airlines of Vietnam Category:Airlines established in 2009 Category:Airlines disestablished in 2011 ",
