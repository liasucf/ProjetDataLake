    "text": "Schematic map of Rome showing the seven hills and Servian wall The Viminal Hill (; ; ) is the smallest of the famous Seven Hills of Rome. A finger-shape cusp pointing toward central Rome between the Quirinal Hill to the northwest and the Esquiline Hill to the southeast, it is home to the Teatro dell'Opera and the Termini Railway Station. At the top of Viminal Hill is the Palace of Viminale that hosts the headquarters of the Ministry of the Interior; currently the term Il Viminale means the Ministry of the Interior. According to Livy, the hill first became part of the city of Rome, along with the Quirinal Hill, during the reign of Servius Tullius, Rome' sixth king, in the 6th century BC.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1.44 The name of the hill derives from Latin viminalis (\u201cpertaining to osiers\u201d), from vimen (\u201ca pliant twig, osier\u201d).https://books.google.ie/books?id=lWwUAAAYAAJ&q;=Viminal+osier&dq;=Viminal+osier&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjYvrHJmN7lAhVErHEKHfKCA0YQ6AEIUjAE == See also == == References == ==External links== *Samuel Ball Platner, A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome: Viminal Hill Category:Seven hills of Rome Category:Rome R.
