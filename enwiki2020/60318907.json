By 1801, the family had moved to Dijon. He moved at a young age to Germany to work at a commercial house, but returned to France after going bankrupt. There he worked as a peddler and bookkeeper in Saint-\u00c9tienne, while serving as head of the Jewish community of nearby Lyon. Cr\u00e9hange moved to Paris in the 1830s. A supporter of the French Revolution of 1848, he published \"La Marseillaise du travail\", in which he provided new words to La Marseillaise to celebrate the cause of the proletariat, and a pamphlet purporting to show how the Tanakh prescribes a republic as the optimal form of government. At the same time, he became the spokesman for the Parisian Orthodox community in a series of disputes with the Consistoire central, which he saw as representing the interests of the Jewish elite. In 1848 he organized the Club d\u00e9mocratique des fid\u00e8les, which promoted republicanism and civic responsibility, and started a weekly periodical, La V\u00e9rit\u00e9, in which he defended the rights of the Orthodox. He ardently lobbied for the introduction of universal male suffrance in consistorial elections. Cr\u00e9hange also advocated against the heavy taxes imposed by the Consistoire on meat sold by butchers that it authorized as kosher, the sale of seats and aliyot in the synagogue, the costly dues for burial rites and plots, and the ban on private prayer assemblies. Cr\u00e9hange was one of the ten founders of the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle, of which he served as vice-president in 1863\u20131864, and would later become secretary of the Comit\u00e9 de Bienfaisance Isra\u00e9lite and the Consistoire central. ==Publications== Cr\u00e9hange translated and edited a number of liturgical volumes during the Second Empire. In 1846, Cr\u00e9hange published in two volumes a French translation of the Tseno Ureno under the title La Semaine Isra\u00e9lite, ou le Tze\u00e9na Our\u00e9na Moderne, Entretiens de Josu\u00e9 Hadass avec sa Famille sur les Saintes E\u0107ritures. He also published a translation into French of the Hagaddah (1847); a book of prayers of the French Jews entitled Tefillat 'Adat Yeshurun (1850); Min\u1e25ah \u1e24adashah, prayers of the Sephardic Jews (1855); an illustrated translation of Tehillim (1858); festival prayers for the use of Franco-Spanish and Franco- Portuguese Jews (6 vols., 1861\u201363); and from 1850 to 1872 an almanac, Annuaire Parisien. He edited two periodicals: La paix, revue religieuse, morale et litt\u00e9raire (1846) and Annuaire parisien du culte isra\u00e9lite (1851\u201371). ==References== Category:1791 births Category:1872 deaths Category:Bookkeepers Category:French Orthodox Jews Category:Print editors Category:Translators from Hebrew Category:Translators from Yiddish ",
