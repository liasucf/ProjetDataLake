    "text": "WWE Night of Champions was an American professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event and WWE Network event produced by professional wrestling promotion WWE. The inaugural event took place on June 24, 2007 and was a crossover with Vengeance. In 2008, Vengeance was dropped in favor of Night of Champions and it took over the June pay-per-view event slot. Night of Champions moved to July in 2009 and to September in 2010. In 2016, Night of Champions was replaced on the PPV schedule by Clash of Champions. ==History== Night of Champions was a pay-per-view event consisting of a main event and undercard that feature championship matches and other various matches. The first event was produced as a pay-per-view event for the WWE. The inaugural event took place on June 24, 2007 under the name Vengeance: Night of Champions at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas and aired live on PPV. In the nine editions of the event, the WWE Championship was defended in the main event 7 times, with the World Heavyweight Championship defended once, and in 2011, the main event was a non-championship match. In 2016, Night of Champions was replaced on the PPV schedule by Clash of Champions. ==Concept== The concept of this pay-per- view is that all WWE titles are defended. Starting in 2010, non-title matches were also included on the card. In previous years, ten titles that have been defended at the pay-per-view include: * WWE Cruiserweight Championship (previous), defended in 2007 * ECW Championship, defended between 2007\u20132009 * World Tag Team Championship, defended between 2007\u20132009 * WWE Women's Championship (previous), defended between 2007\u20132010 * World Heavyweight Championship, defended between 2007\u20132013 * WWE Divas Championship, defended between 2009\u20132015 * WWE Championship, defended between 2007\u20132015 * WWE United States Championship, defended between 2007\u20132015 * WWE Intercontinental Championship, defended between 2007\u20132015 * WWE Tag Team Championship, defended between 2007\u20132015 ==Dates and venues== {| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\" width=\"100%\" !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=\"14%\"|Event !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=\"8%\"|Date !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=\"11%\"|City !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=\"11%\"|Venue !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=\"33%\"|Main Event |- |Vengeance: Night of Champions |June 24, 2007 |Houston, Texas |Toyota Center | |- |Night of Champions (2008) |June 29, 2008 |Dallas, Texas |American Airlines Center | |- |Night of Champions (2009) |July 26, 2009 |Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |Wachovia Center | |- |Night of Champions (2010) |September 19, 2010 |Rosemont, Illinois |Allstate Arena | |- |Night of Champions (2011) |September 18, 2011 |Buffalo, New York |First Niagara Center | |- |Night of Champions (2012) |September 16, 2012 |Boston, Massachusetts |TD Garden | |- |Night of Champions (2013) |September 15, 2013 |Detroit, Michigan |Joe Louis Arena | |- |Night of Champions (2014) |September 21, 2014 |Nashville, Tennessee |Bridgestone Arena | |- |Night of Champions (2015) |September 20, 2015 |Houston, Texas |Toyota Center | |- |colspan=\"10\"| |- |} == See also== * List of current champions in WWE ==References== ==External links== * Category:Recurring events established in 2007 Category:Recurring events disestablished in 2015 ",
