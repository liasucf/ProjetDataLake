A student hacked the teachers' computers to gain access to the world studies and science tests, and then shared the world studies test with other students. An investigation by the school board found that more than half of the graduating class had copies of the leaked world studies test or knew about the leak but didn't report it. The cancellation of the ceremony resulted in protests at the school which gained national media attention, and an unofficial graduation ceremony was organized by the families of the class of 2009 at Hilliar Park the day after what would have been the official graduation ceremony, of which footage was aired on local television stations. ==Ohio High School Athletic Association State Championships== * Girls Volleyball \u2013 2003 _Other School Facts_ Centerburg's academic team (quiz bowl) has been a perennial local power over the past 4 years, advancing to the regional tournament on a regular basis.
