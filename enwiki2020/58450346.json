This has resulted in three concert tours (all of them worldwide), and a lot of TV and award shows performances. He first released an extended play named My World in November 2009. The EP got promoted through 2009, through performances at several award ceremonies and television shows, including the Summer Rush and the Jingle Ball as well through his first promotional tour Urban Behavior Tour. In 2009 Bieber served as the opening act on selected dates of Taylor Swift's Fearless Tour. In March 2010 he released his first studio album My World 2.0 which included his smash hit \"Baby\". A tour in support of the album began in June 2010 and ended in October 2011 after 127 stops. It was named My World Tour. In February 2011 he released his first documentary theatre movie Never Say Never. The soundtrack to the album was released the same day as the movie. Nine months later he released Under the Mistletoe, his first Christmas album. In June 2012 he released his second studio album Believe. The album got promoted through several performances including the iHeartRadio MuchMusic Video Awards and the Summertime Ball. The tour in support of the album began in the United States in September 2012 and ended in December 2013 in Australia after 155 concerts. In January 2013 the acoustic version of the album was released. In December 2013 he released his second compilation album Journals. No tour in support of Journals was booked. No promotion was done either. After three and a half years since the release of Bieber's second studio album, he released his third, Purpose in November 2015. The album got promoted through several award show performances including the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards and the American Music Awards. The Purpose World Tour began in Seattle in March 2016. Bieber began to perform in stadiums since the Latin American leg in February 2017. The tour was set to end in Singapore in October 2017 but ended in July instead due to mental and physical exhaustion. According to Pollstar, Purpose World Tour grossed $163.3 million and sold 1,761,642 tickets in 2016 and the 29 shows in 2017 grossed $93.7 million with 1,043,839 tickets sold. Overall, the tour had a total gross of $257 million and 2,805,481 in attendance in 141 shows. In November 2017 it was reported that a 17 year old British boy planned a terror attack on a Justin Bieber concert in Cardiff, in name of the Islamic State weeks after the Manchester Arena bombing after an Ariana Grande concert. Luckily nothing fatal happened. == Concert tours == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" width=\"100%\" ! scope=\"col\" |Title ! scope=\"col\" width=\"14%\" |Dates !
