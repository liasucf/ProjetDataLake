Cornelia, daughter of famous actor Otis Skinner (Charlie Ruggles), also bemoans the fact that \"heartthrob,\" Avery Moore (James Brown), ignores her, and is about to leave on a European trip. Emily suggests they both go to Europe, and without a chaperone. On the same boat as Avery, Cornelia accepts a date from him to go to a dance on the ship, while Emily meets Tom Newhall (Bill Edwards), a handsome young doctor and bachelor. Their romantic intentions go awry when Cornelia comes down with measles, and Tom agrees to use makeup to mask the spots, but she does not want to tell Avery about her infection. When the ship reaches London, Cornelia's parents, who had traveled on another cruise ship, meet the two girls. At a tour of Hampton Court Palace in Paris, Cornelia spots Avery and the two young people reunite, but after kissing her, Avery comes down with measles. Cornelia and Emily head off for Paris to sight see on their own. After getting trapped on a balcony at Notre Dame Cathedral, the girls drop articles of clothing to try to get the attention of passersby, to no avail. When Cornelia and Emily finally return to their hotel in their slips, they encounter Mr. Skinner's friend, actor Monsieur Darnet (Georges Renavent), and his friend, Pierre Cambouille (Roland Varno). To help them, the gentlemen escort them inside, but Avery thinks the worst and hits Cambouille. A brawl erupts just as Mr. and Mrs. Skinner arrive from England, and Mr. Skinner insists that it is time for his daughter to return home. After bidding fond farewells to Avery and Tom, Cornelia and Emily board the ship home, ending their European misadventures. ==Cast== * Gail Russell as Cornelia Otis Skinner * Diana Lynn as Emily Kimbrough * Charlie Ruggles as Otis Skinner * Dorothy Gish as Mrs. Skinner * Beulah Bondi as Miss Horn * James Brown as Avery Moore * Bill Edwards as Tom Newhall * Jean Heather as Frances Smithers * Alma Kruger as Mrs. Lamberton * Helen Freeman as Mrs. Smithers (uncredited) * Joy Harington as English girl (uncredited) * Valentine Perkins as English girl (uncredited) * Georges Renavent as Monsieur Darnet (uncredited) * Roland Varno as Pierre Cambouille (uncredited) ==Production== Principal photography on Our Hearts Were Young and Gay began on August 24, 1943 and continued until October 21, 1943.

Blithely recalling the trip abroad made by those ladies when they were in their impressionable 'teens, its story is as light as a marshmallow and sometimes as cloyingly sweet. Although the picture's foreword coyly denies that it is intended as a period piece, it very often uses the devices of dated clothes and manners to garner laughs. If the film occasionally stumbles on its merry way, blame it on those arid humorless stretches when Our Hearts Were Young and Gay becomes more young than gay. Generally, however, the producers have fused the effervescence of youth with rosy-tinted nostalgia to make an amusing and satisfying entertainment.\"White, Armond (A.W.). \"Movie review: 'Our Hearts Were Young and Gay' at the Paramount.\" The New York Times, December 10, 1944. Retrieved: August 26, 2016. In 1945, although a news item in The Hollywood Reporter indicated that Skinner and Kimbrough took legal action against Paramount to prevent a sequel to Our Hearts Were Young and Gay, a judge ruled in favor of the studio. In the sequel, Our Hearts Were Growing Up (1946), Gail Russell, Diana Lynn, James Brown and Bill Edwards reprised their roles.\"Notes: 'Our Hearts Were Young and Gay'.\" Turner Classic Movies, Retrieved: August 26, 2016. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * Skinner, Cornelia Otis and Emily Kimbrough.
