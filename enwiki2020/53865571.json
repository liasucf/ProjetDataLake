    "text": "EBS1 (formerly KBS3) is a South Korean free-to-air television channel operated by the Educational Broadcasting System. The channel is available as a national network without any regional variation in schedules. Its national distribution however, is administered by KBS. == History == The channel was originally launched by the Korean Broadcasting System on 2 February 1981 as KBS3 and all the educational television programmes previously broadcast on other KBS channels were moved to a dedicated channel. In 1990, when the responsibility of broadcasting educational contents was spun off from KBS, the channel became part of the newly-formed Educational Broadcasting System. The channel was rebranded as EBS Television. In 2000, the Educational Broadcasting System itself was turned into a public corporation. Digital terrestrial transmission began on 5 November 2001 on channel 10.1. On 11 February 2015, when EBS2 was launched, EBS was rebranded as EBS1. == See also == * KBS Radio 1 * KBS Radio 2 * EBS FM * MBC FM4U * CBS Music FM * Traffic Broadcasting System * Far East Broadcasting Company == References == == External links == * Category:Television channels in South Korea ",
