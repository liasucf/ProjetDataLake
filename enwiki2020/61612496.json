It goes east to have an intersection with SR 181 (Great River Road) before crossing over the Obion River to pass through Finley, where it has an intersection with SR 182. The highway now enters Dyersburg and passes through industrial areas before having an intersection with US 51/SR 3 (Highway 51 Bypass). SR 104 then passes through neighborhoods before entering downtown along Forrest Street to have an intersection with SR 78 (Lake Road), where it becomes McGaughey Street. It then becomes concurrent with US 51 Bus./SR 211 (Troy Avenue) for a short distance as it turns south along N Main Avenue before splitting off and going east along E Court Street. The highway passes through more neighborhoods before coming to an interchange with US 412/SR 20, where SR 104 leaves Dyersburg and becomes a primary highway. SR 104 passes through RoEllen before crossing into Gibson County via a bridge over the North Fork of the Forked Deer River. The entire route of SR 104 in Dyer County is a two-lane highway. ===Gibson County=== SR 104 then passes through Eaton, where it has an intersection with SR 188, before widening to a 4-lane divided highway as it continues east through farmland to come to an intersection with SR 457, where it narrows to 2-lanes and enters Trenton. It passes through downtown along Eaton Street, where it has an intersection with SR 367, before coming to an intersection with US 45W/SR 43/SR 54/SR 77. SR 104 now becomes concurrent with SR 77, where SR 104 becomes unsigned, and they leave Trenton and cross another bridge over the North Fork of the Forked Deer River. SR 77/SR 104 pass by Gibson County Airport before entering Milan as N Main Street. They pass through neighborhoods before making a left onto Front Street to come to an intersection and become concurrent with US 45E/SR 43 (S 1st Street), where SR 77 also becomes unsigned.
