The government army carelessly besieged the fort (with no guards appointed), and the sudden sally of Lisovsky's men from the Zaraisk Kremlin scattered them with little resistance. == Aftermath == After the victory at Zaraisk, Lisovskiy swiftly captured Kolomna, where he captured many heavy guns. His army was strengthened by the remnants of former Bolotnikovites . However, the detachment of Lisovsky, heavily burdened by the convoy, was defeated by the Tsar's army at Medvezhiy Brod. == References == Category:1608 in Russia Category:17th-century military history of Russia Category:1608 in Europe Med Category:Conflicts in 1608 ",
