It was built as part of the larger M-6 highway within the Yugoslav highway network, spanning Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. It connected Nik\u0161i\u0107 with Trebinje in Bosnia and Herzegovina; Gospi\u0107, Knin and Sinj in Croatia; \u0160kofljica and Ko\u010devje in Slovenia . Since 2013 sections of the highway have been reconstructed by increasing curve radii and adding third lane on steeper sections. In 2017, 13 kilometers are reconstructed with 3.7 with added third lane. In January 2016, the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs published bylaw on categorisation of state roads. With new categorisation, M-6 highway was renamed as M-7 highway. ==Major intersections== ==References== M-7 ",
