    "text": "One of the many groynes that protect the beach from sand erosion View along the beach across the sands Aberdeen Beach and Queens Links is located in Aberdeen, Scotland. The beach itself is famous for its golden sand and its long curved length between the harbour and the River Don's mouth. The beach suffers from significant erosion of the sand so there are distinctive groyne or walls, to help keep the sand in place. The beach is popular with walkers, surfers and windsurfers. Recently in an expensive million pound operation, sand was taken by ship from further down the coast to the south of Aberdeen and sprayed on the beach to replace some of the lost sand. Rocks were then placed in a v-shape formation to try to prevent erosion, much like the groyne. The beach has an amusement area along the Beach Esplanade where there are restaurants and the city's amusement park Codonas. There is also a 9 screen Cineworld multiplex cinema located next to the restaurants and Codonas Amusement Park. The actual park area is called Queens Links and takes the form of a large grassy area parallel to the beach. It is popular with many people and often kite-boarders can be seen taking advantage of the strong sea winds. There is a public golf course, the Kings Links. There is a city council recreation site, the Beach Leisure Centre with a swimming pool, ice rink and indoor sports hall. ==References== ==See also== *Green spaces and walkways in Aberdeen ==External links== *Beach Queens Links *Queens Links Leisure Park *Beach Boulevard Retail Park Category:Parks in Aberdeen Category:Environment of Aberdeen ",
