It is believed that they descend from Chepni tribesmen who were settled in the region by the Ottoman Empire to serve against the Qizilbash. K\u00fcres\u00fcnni, from the Shafi'i madh'hab, continue to be fervent Sunnis. In the southwest of Khoy, there are Kurdicized groups of K\u00fcres\u00fcnni Turks. Following their conflict with Kurdish leader Simko Shikak in 1921, a group of K\u00fcres\u00fcnni took refuge in Van Province of Turkey.G\u00fcney Azerbaycan ve K\u00fcrt Sorunu ==See also== *Giresun *K\u00fcre Mountains ==References== ==External links== *K\u00fcres\u00fcnniler K\u00fcres\u00fcnni social web community Category:Ethnic groups in Iran Category:Ethnic groups in Turkey Category:Oghuz Turks Category:Azerbaijani tribes ",
