    "text": "Lot Fourteen is a development site in the Australian state of South Australia which accommodated the old Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) at the eastern end of North Terrace, Adelaide and which became vacant after the hospital function was moved to a new building at the western end of North Terrace in 2017. Its name was derived from the original 1837 plan for Adelaide by surveyor-general Colonel William Light. The site is in within the cultural precinct of the city, next to the Adelaide Botanic Garden and with the University of Adelaide, University of South Australia, Adelaide Botanic High School and the Art Gallery of South Australia as close neighbours. The urban planning arm of the South Australian government, Renewal SA, is responsible for the redevelopment of the site. A mixed development, incorporating cultural institutions as well as residential, hotel and office uses is planned. A centrepiece of the development, planned for completion in 2023, is a new Aboriginal cultural centre and gallery, which, among other items, would exhibit a large number of cultural artefacts currently in storage in the South Australian Museum. An entrepreneurial hub known as FIXE@LotFourteen (Future Industries Exchange for Entrepreneurship at Lot Fourteen) is being developed. The headquarters of the Australian Space Agency, a Commonwealth government department, are located at Lot Fourteen. ==Background== The old Royal Adelaide Hospital, situated at the eastern end of North Terrace, with some of its buildings dating back to the 19th century, was moved into a new complex at the western end of North Terrace in September 2017. Plans for the redevelopment of the site commenced well before the move. The name \"Lot Fourteen\" is derived from the original 1837 plan for Adelaide by surveyor-general Colonel William Light. History tours will be available to appreciate the heritage value of the site. ==Timeline== ===2017=== Before the new RAH building was complete, various ideas were mooted about uses for the site of the old buildings. In January 2017, the then South Australian Government had plans to redevelop the site which included more than 1,000 apartments and a five-star hotel. It was decided that five heritage buildings would be retained, and about a third of the site would become part of the adjoining Adelaide Botanic Garden. There were also plans to turn the helipad into a \"roof-top hotel\". ===2018=== In March 2018, there was a change of government, with Steven Marshall's Liberal Party voted into office. With the focus on its development as an \"innovation hub\", the state budget in September allocated over five years to government authority Renewal SA to help lure startups and industries associated with the Australian Space Agency, which would be located on the site. Industry and Skills minister David Pisoni said the site would host up to 650 workspaces, conference and collaboration facilities. Several of the heritage buildings would be maintained and redeveloped. By the end of 2018, over 150 people had moved into the development, in the focus areas of artificial intelligence and machine learning, data analytics, cybersecurity, defence and space technology, and creative technology. An entrepreneurial hub known as FIXE@LotFourteen (Future Industries Exchange for Entrepreneurship at Lot Fourteen) had also been established. On 12 December 2018, Prime Minister Scott Morrison officially announced that the Australian Space Agency, a department of the federal government, would be located at Lot Fourteen in 2019. ===2019=== In June 2019, Adelaide City Council raised concerns about the proposed exemption from paying rates by businesses on the site, after RenewalSA had announced plans for a proposed 250-room hotel at the site. Also in June, the state government announced an injection of federal funds, which made a total of , known as the \"Adelaide City Deal\", much of which would be used on Lot Fourteen. By that time, there were a number of space-related companies already there or signed on, and plans for the Gallery for Aboriginal Art and Cultures, an International Centre for Food, Hospitality and Tourism Studies and an Indigenous Business Hub were being consolidated. The state government would be implementing a new governance arrangement for Lot Fourteen. Canadian expert Ilse Treurnicht, formerly CEO of the MaRS Discovery District in Toronto, a not-for-profit innovation complex built on the site of an old hospital, was invited to submit recommendations to the government in September 2019, during a second visit arranged by the Don Dunstan Foundation. Commenting ahead of the September conference, after discussions between Renewal SA and the Adelaide City Council, among her recommendations was that the non-government sector should have a greater say in the management of the redevelopment. She said it was at a critical stage at that point, with many of the tenants confirmed and the machine learning centre due to in the following few months. She also recommended establishing an independent board, which could consult widely and create cross-sector collaborations between government and business groups. Tenants of the refurbished Hanson and Eleanor Harrald Buildings included Inovor Technologies (space technology) and Presagen (health technology) in June 2019, with a forecast of over a thousand people working there by the end of the summer season in 2020. Also in June, the independent not-for-profit innovation hub operator Stone & Chalk was commissioned to help start-ups at the site develop and grow and to provide advice to the government. They said that FIXE at Lot Fourteen would be launched by October. In July 2019, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) agreed to collaborate on the development of a \"Living Lab\", enabling collaboration among the public, private and research sectors to determine the best ways for South Australia to plan both economic and sustainable population growth. ===2020=== Marshall (Premier and Minister of the Arts and Aboriginal Affairs) announced that the million Aboriginal Cultural Centre would open by 2023, after long consultation with Indigenous communities. The South Australian Museum\u2019s collection of cultural artefacts, currently in storage, would form the centrepiece of the collection on public display. There was still at this point a great deal of demolition work needing to be done before construction could begin, but the original plan had been improved by thorough consultation with Aboriginal communities, especially the local Kaurna people. The project was to be funded by the state government to the tune of million, and federal government by million. The word \u201cnational\u201d had been dropped from the title of the new institution, from its title owing to competition with the Northern Territory, with both jurisdictions claiming their institutions would be firsts for Australia. The Australian Space Agency offices were officially opened on 19 February 2020. The ASA is planning to \"triple the size of the Australian space industry and create 20,000 new jobs by 2030\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:Redevelopment projects in Australia Category:Adelaide Category:Museums in Adelaide ",
