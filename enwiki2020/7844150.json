IUK serves north central Indiana and its athletics teams are known as the Cougars. ==History== In 1932, John and George Beauchamp opened the Kokomo Junior College in the downtown YMCA. The Junior College offered a basic two-year collegiate program. It maintained an average enrollment of approximately 75 students. In 1945, it moved to 508 West Taylor Street, which was Indiana University's first building in the city of Kokomo. Indiana University Kokomo was officially established in 1945 as one of several extension centers of Indiana University.(2012) Under the first director, Virgil Hunt, who later donated millions of dollars to the institution and funded the construction of Hunt Hall, students moved to a new location in 1947. In this location on West Sycamore Street, known as the Seiberling Mansion, an adjacent home, the Elliot House, and its two carriage buildings served as the IU Kokomo campus for nearly twenty years. In 1965, IUK moved to its current location, south of historic downtown Kokomo, on Washington Street. The Main Building, the first building on campus, opened with classrooms, a library, administrative offices, and a 908-seat auditorium. In 1980, the East Building - now known for its state-of-the-art Nursing Simulation Lab - was constructed. In 1989, the Kelley Student Center was completed. Six years later, the modern library was opened. Purdue advisement offices and campus offices are housed in the west wing of the building, where PU:Technology-accredited courses are held. In 2001, Hunt Hall opened, a modern building used for science and math and named after Virgil and Elizabeth Hunt. In 2010, IU Kokomo acquired an off-campus building which was once the Kokomo Post Office, and it has since been renamed the Fine Arts Building. In August 2013, the Milt and Jean Cole Family Wellness and Fitness Center opened. The 21,000 square-foot facility includes a jogging and walking track, a cardio and strength training area, two multi-purpose rooms, as well as a health studies room and lockers. The center provides the opportunity for expanding Allied Health Programs such as sports medicine and athletic training. The wellness and fitness center was officially named after the Milt and Jean Cole family in September 2013 to honor them for their generous donation of $1.25 million to the campus and to show appreciation for the dedication the Cole family has made in enhancing the quality of life in north central Indiana. With their donation, the Cole Fitness Center will be a place that IU Kokomo students, faculty, and staff will be able to improve their overall physical and mental health for years to come.
