    "text": "The Speaker of the Knesset (, Yoshev Rosh HaKnesset, literally: Chairman of the Knesset) is the presiding officer of the Knesset, the unicameral legislature of Israel. The Speaker also acts as President of Israel when the President is incapacitated. The current speaker is Yariv Levin, who was elected on 17 May 2020. To date, Ahdut HaAvoda's Nahum Nir and Blue & White's Benny Gantz are the only Speakers not to have come from the ruling party, though in two cases (Avraham Burg and Reuven Rivlin) the party of the speaker (One Israel and Likud respectively) lost power during their term. The speaker is expected to act in a non-partisan nature, but may occasionally take part in debates, and is allowed to vote. The speaker is assisted by a number of Deputy Speakers of the Knesset (currently 10). The Deputy Speakers are drawn from the breadth of parties represented in the Knesset. Together, the Speaker and the Deputy Speakers constitute the Praesidium of the Knesset. ==Knesset Speakers (1949\u2013present)== A total of sixteen people have served as Speaker of the Knesset, one of whom, Reuven Rivlin, have served two non-consecutive terms. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !colspan=\"6\"|Speaker !rowspan=\"2\"|Knesset |- ! !
