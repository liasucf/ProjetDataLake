    "text": "Sigmund Groven (born 16 March 1946 in Heddal, Telemark) is a Norwegian classical harmonica player, today considered one of the world's leading classical harmonica players. He plays with a large number of the world's leading musicians and orchestras, and he has made 23 recordings yet in his own name (compilations not counted). His repertoire ranges from popular and folk music to his own compositions, from Bach to contemporary music. ==Influences and early career== Groven grew up in a family with rich music and cultural traditions. His uncle was the folk musician and composer, Eivind Groven (1901\u201377). As a child, he heard Tommy Reilly playing harmonica on radio, and was fascinated by what he heard. From 1960, Groven studied with Reilly in London, in 1965 he performed as a solo artist for the first time, and has since often been seen and heard on TV and radio. Groven has worked as a music producer, radio presenter, programme producer for radio and as a music teacher, at Norwegian universities and at master-classes around the world. In 1971 Groven presented his first original composition; the music to Erik Bye's poem, \"S\u00e5 spiller vi harmonica\", and he continued to work with Erik Bye on a number of songs and projects. ==Collaborations, soundtracks, main works== Groven has contributed to over 250 recordings, and has written more than 350 original compositions, from children's songs and instrumental ballads to movie and TV soundtracks, and works on a larger scale. He has written music to lyrics and poems by Ove R\u00f8sbak, Halvor J. Sandsdalen, Tarjei Vesaas, Olav Kaste, Hans B\u00f8rli, Josef G.Larssen and Erik Bye. Composers who have written music especially for Groven include Hui Cheung Wai, \u00d8istein Sommerfeldt, Terje Rypdal, James Moody, Johan Kvandal, Oddvar S. Kvam, Ketil Bj\u00f8rnstad, Kristian Lindeman, Henning Sommerro, Iver Kleive, Egil Kapstad, Kenneth Sivertsen, Johan \u00d8ian, John Surman, Siegfried Steinkogler, Lars Tilling, and Fried Walter. Soundtracks include the films \"For Tors skyld\" and \"Fuglekongen\", and the TV documentary series \"Vi p\u00e5 Langedrag\". Many of Groven's recordings have become part of the Norwegian cultural heritage. Reodors ballade (by Bent Fabricius-Bjerre) from the movie \"Fl\u00e5klypa Grand Prix\", \"Svalbard theme\" by B\u00f8hren & \u00c5serud, and a version of Henning Sommero's \"V\u00e5rs\u00f8g\" are among the instrumental classics of Norwegian music, loved by several generations. Groven has recorded 23 albums ranging from original music via Beatles hits to classical works. His albums are sold worldwide and he enjoys great popularity in Asia. Groven has toured all over the world with solo recitals from New York (Carnegie Hall) to Tokyo (Casals Hall). In 2002 he became the first harmonica- player to appear as soloist with the Mozarteum Orchestra in Salzburg giving the world premiere of Siegfried Steinkogler\u2019s Harmonica Concerto, and has performed with symphony and chamber orchestras in the US, Canada, Europe and Asia, including Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, the radio orchestras of Berlin, Munich, Brussels, Stockholm and London, the Hong Kong City Chamber Orchestra and orchestras in Quebec, Dallas, Minneapolis and Anchorage.
