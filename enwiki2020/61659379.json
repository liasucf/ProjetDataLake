The Hungarian-born Canadian John Kemeny was responsible for the overall production. The original French director was Jacques Demy who was replaced by Philippe de Broca, also from France,Martin Knelman (1987), Home Movies: Tales from the Canadian film world, Toronto: Key Porter Books, assisted by Emmanuel Gust. Financing of the $13 million production included pre-sale to television as a six-hour miniseries (on HBO). Because it was also intended for international theatrical release, two different scripts were used, meaning some characters appearing in the mini-series did not appear in the film. The screenplay was by Dominique Fabre, Chuck Israel, John Melson, \u00c9tienne P\u00e9rier, based on the first two novels of Maurice Denuzi\u00e8re's six-volume Louisiane suite, \"Louisiane\" (1977) and \"Fausse-Rivi\u00e8re\" (1979). It was filmed in and around Nottoway Plantation house outside New Orleans. The production was plagued by problems, including a near hurricane which caused delays, and the Mississippi River, which overflowed and destroyed a large outdoor set. ===Production credits=== Artistic direction: Ivo Cristante, Randy Moore Sets: John McAdam Costumes: John Hay Photography: Michel Brault Poster: Yves Thos Sound: Jean-Charles Ruault Editing: Henri Lano\u00eb Music: Claude Bolling Associate production company: Gabriel Boustani Executive producers: Denis Heroux, John Kemeny Production company : *France A2 Movies *Espagne Filmax *Canada International Cinema Corporation *Italie Radio Televisione Italiana Distribution: Parafrance Original language: French and English Format: colour - 35 mm - 1.37: 1 - Mono sound Genre : historical film Duration: 187 minutes Release dates: France : January 22 , 1984 ==References== ==External Links== * * Louisiana on the Cin\u00e9-Ressources website (fr) * Louisiana on Unifrance (fr) Category:1984 films Category:Films directed by Philippe de Broca Category:Films set in Louisiana Category:Films set in the 19th century ",
