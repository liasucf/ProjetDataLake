    "text": "The Rocketdyne XRS-2200 was an experimental linear aerospike engine developed in the mid-1990s for the Lockheed Martin X-33 program. The design was based on the J-2S linear aerospike engine developed in the 1960s and therefore used the J-2's combustion cycle and propellant choice. Rocketdyne intended to develop the subscale XRS-2200 into the RS-2200 for use on the VentureStar. While the X-33 program was cancelled, two XRS-2200 engines were produced and tested. ==References== Category:Rocketdyne engines Category:Rocketdyne Category:Rocket engines ",
