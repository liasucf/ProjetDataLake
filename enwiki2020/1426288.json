    "text": "Lule River (, , Lule\u00e4lven) is a major river in Sweden, rising in northern Sweden and flowing southeast for before reaching the Gulf of Bothnia at Lule\u00e5. It is the second longest river by watershed area or length in Norrbotten County (after the Torne River and very slightly ahead of the Kalix River, which is 460.65 km long), but is the largest by average discharge. It has a watershed of 25,240.5 km\u00b2 of which 24,545.6 km\u00b2 is in Sweden and 694.9 km\u00b2 in Norway. The river is an important source of hydroelectric energy, with major hydroelectric plants at e.g. Porjus and the 977 MW Harspr\u00e5nget, commissioned in 1952 and expanded in 1983 to become Sweden's largest hydro power station.Mellgren, Erik. \"Third time counted for Harspr\u00e5nget\", Ny Teknik 28 July 2012. Retrieved: 7 August 2012. The river was used extensively for the transportation of timber, with logs floated downstream for processing at Lule\u00e5, but this stopped in the early 1980s. Several major rapids exist along the river's length, notably the Stora Falls and those at Porjus and Harspr\u00e5nget. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the river was designated as a defensive line against an invasion from Imperial Russia and subsequently the Soviet Union. Extensive fortifications exist along the entire length of the river, culminating in Bodens Fortress in and around the city of Boden. Most of these fortifications and bunkers are no longer in use today. The Greater Lule River (Big Lule River) arguably begins somewhere near S\u00e5rj\u00e5sjaure in the mountains west of G\u00e4llivare. The water flows to the Virihaure lake, which also collects water from Kerkevare (via Kettaurejokk) and Alkajaure (via Mill\u00e4tno). The Tukejokk joins the Lule as well in Virihaure. Leaving Virihaure to the north, the river reaches the Vastenjaure lake after losing 32m over 2.2 km. It then flows via the Vuojat\u00e4tno to lake Kutjaure and then Luoktanjarkajaure, collecting a lot of water from other lakes in Sarek National Park, like Salohaure, and from the Swedish-Norwegian border. There are numerous waterfalls and rapids in the river. The best known is Stora Sj\u00f6fallet at the end of the Akkajaure lake, where the water falls 39.6 m from K\u00e5rtjejaure to Langasjaure. In this lake the Vietasajokk joins the Lule. The Stora Lule tr\u00e4sk is the largest of the lakes in the river. Here it reaches the forest, and after the lake is joined by the Muddus River from Muddus National Park. At 75m, near the village of Vuollerim, the river joins with the Lesser Lule River. The Lule passes the Porsiforsen (25m over 2 km), Edefors and Hedens fors. It flows into the Baltic Sea through the B\u00e4lingefj\u00e4rden and Lulefj\u00e4rden. Other rivers in the watershed of the Lule with a length of more than 100 km are: Black River (Sweden), Flark\u00e5n, Lesser Lule River, P\u00e4rl River, Rissaj\u00e5kk\u00e5, Vietas\u00e4tno, and Bodtr\u00e4sk\u00e5n. aurora borealis. The waterfall Harspr\u00e5nget (former name: Njommelsaska) was the largest waterfall on the Swedish Lule River. Today there is the largest hydroelectric plant in Sweden Stora harspr\u00e5nget ==References== * article Lule \u00e4lf from Nordisk Familjebok (1912) Category:Norrbotten Category:Lapland (Sweden) * Category:Rivers of Norrbotten County ",
