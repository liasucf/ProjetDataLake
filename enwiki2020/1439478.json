    "text": "The Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade (RCYB) is the former youth group of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA. It was founded as the Attica Brigade, and then was renamed the Revolutionary Student Brigade. During its existence, the most famous member of the RCYB was Gregory Lee \"Joey\" Johnson. During the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas, he burned the United States flag to protest the policies of the Reagan administration. Johnson was arrested and convicted, but had his conviction overturned on appeal. The State of Texas then sought and obtained review by the Supreme Court. In Texas v. Johnson, a five-justice majority of the court held that Johnson\u2019s act of flag burning was protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. ==References== Category:Youth wings of political parties in the United States Category:Youth wings of communist parties Category:Defunct Maoist organizations in the United States Category:Revolutionary Communist Party, USA ",
