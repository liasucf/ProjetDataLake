    "text": "The Swaziland Federation of Labour (SFL) was created in 1994 as a break-away union from the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions. It has 12 affiliates covering manufacturing, retail, finance, IT, media and non-teaching staff, amongst other things. Originally 5,000 strong, the membership of the organisation has increased to 20,000. The federation has no full-time officials and relies on the full-time officers in its affiliated unions. The SFL also operates from affiliated unions' offices and has little finance of its own.http://www.dr.dk/sydafrika/da/Swaziland_fakta/fakta_befolkning.asp == References == Category:Trade unions in Eswatini Category:Trade unions established in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in Swaziland ",
