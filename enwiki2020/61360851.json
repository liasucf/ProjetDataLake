Toronto Star, June 20, 2013. The film premiered at the 2012 Cr\u00e9teil International Women's Film Festival.Shannon Webb-Campbell, \"A spoon full of Margarita\". Daily Xtra, May 2, 2012. ==Critical response== Writing for the Toronto Star, Linda Barnard called the film a predictable domestic drama, but praised Correia-Damude for her performance. For The Globe and Mail, Liam Lacey wrote that the cast \"works valiantly and the cinematography is crisp, but trite characterizations and an earnest-cutesy tone make this movie feel like too much domestic labour.\"Liam Lacey, \"Margarita: Canadian sitcom-with-a-message is a little too earnest-cutesy\". The Globe and Mail, June 21, 2013. Robert Bell of Exclaim! wrote that \"Beyond the assertion that they understand the world's woes and can appreciate the altruistic and entirely loveable lower class, there's a contrary preoccupation with job title as key signifier of a person's importance. Much like the doctors in Finn's Girl, everyone, aside from Margarita, is a doctor, dentist or law student. While appropriate, since the majority of Toronto is convinced of their own importance, Colbert and Cardona are unaware of this irony or vulgar superficiality, instead demonstrating blind adherence to an amusing status quo.\" ==Awards== The film won the Audience Award for Best Feature Film at the 2012 Inside Out Film and Video Festival.\"Margarita grabs audience award at Inside Out Festival\".
