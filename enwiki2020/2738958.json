    "text": "Meinl Percussion is a manufacturer of percussion instruments based in Gutenstetten, Germany. The company\u2019s cymbal production is one of the \"big four\" manufacturers of cymbals, along with Zildjian, Sabian, and Paiste. In addition to cymbals, Meinl manufactures a very wide range of percussion instruments including bongo drums, cajons, congas, djembes, g\u00fciros, pandeiros, and tambourines. == History == The \"Roland Meinl Musikinstrumente\" was founded in 1951 by Roland Meinl. Initially the company produced wind instruments, beginning the production of cymbals only in 1952. The first Meinl cymbals were cut out of large metal sheets, hammered, lathed and drilled by hand by Roland Meinl himself, who subsequently transported them to the Neustadt an der Aisch railstation on the luggage carrier of his bike. In the 1960s about half of the production was exported to the United States together with German-made Tromsa drumsets. The first employee, Gustav Strobel, was hired in 1964 and worked for the company for almost 40 years. At about the same time Roland Meinl began to import affordable music instruments from Japan, being one of the first Pearl importers in Europe. He later began to import Tama and Ibanez instruments.Brief company history (Version May 6, 2006 from Internet Archive) In 1974 Meinl was the first cymbal company to offer pre-pack cymbal sets. Meinl's initial cymbal production focused on low-budget cymbals, and it wasn't until 1984 with the \"Profile Series\" that Meinl started to really focus on professional-level cymbals. The first Meinl pro series was the \"King-Beat Series\", introduced in 1976. In 1990 Meinl introduced the \"Tri-Tonal Series\", their first signature series developed with Billy Cobham. The series was discontinued a year later. In 2006 Meinl began the production of the \"Mb10 Series\", made out of B10 bronze alloy (90% copper and 10% tin), making them the only company to produce cymbals out of four different bronze alloys (B8, B10, B12 and B20 bronze). On December 4, 2007 company founder Roland Meinl died at the age of 78. ==Products== ===Cymbals=== ====Current cymbal series==== * Byzance \u2013 Professional cymbals which produce more traditional sounds. They are made out of the B20 alloy and are hand hammered in Turkey. Available in eight variations: ** Byzance Traditional \u2013 These cymbals are said to be warm and versatile, with a traditional sound. They come in a traditional finish. ** Byzance Dark \u2013 These cymbals feature a dark and earthy tone with a good stick definition. The surface of these cymbals is untreated and extensively hammered. ** Byzance Brilliant \u2013 This series owes its name to its brilliant finish. The finish gives these cymbals a darker sound compared to the Byzance Traditional series, since it limits the high end. ** Byzance Jazz \u2013 The cymbals from this line have a dark and tonally complex sound. They come in a traditional finish. ** Byzance Extra Dry \u2013 As the name suggests, these cymbals are very dry, low-pitched and trashy. The cymbals of this series are deeply hand-hammered and feature an unlathed, raw top and a traditionally lathed bottom. ** Byzance Vintage \u2013 They feature a dry, low-pitched controlled sound. Most of the cymbals of this line come in a unique sandblasted finish. ** Byzance Dual \u2013 Initially part of the Byzance Extra Dry series, these cymbals feature an unlathed, raw inner bow and bell area and a brilliant outer edge, giving the cymbal two playing surfaces for riding and crashing. ** Byzance Foundry Reserve \u2013 Limited selection of high end, hand hammered B20 cymbals with a complex, dark character and a clear stick definition. These cymbals are sold with a pair of drum sticks, a pair of cotton gloves and a certificate. * Pure Alloy \u2013 Professional level cymbals made from proprietary \"Pure Alloy\" bronze. This series features pinpoint lathing and a traditional finish. ** Pure Alloy Custom \u2013 Professional level cymbals made from proprietary \"Pure Alloy\" bronze. They are thinner than the regular Pure Alloy series and they come in a \"smoked bronze\" finish. * Generation X \u2013 Meinl's line of innovative modern cymbals developed with such artists as Johnny Rabb, Benny Greb, and Thomas Lang. A number of alloys are used for this series such as the FX9 alloy (69% copper, 15% zinc, 15% manganese, 1% aluminium), MS63 brass, B12 bronze and B8 bronze. * Classics Custom \u2013 Made from B10 bronze alloy, these semi-professional level cymbals are bright and loud. They come in a brilliant finish. ** Classics Custom Dark \u2013 These cymbals are darker and more complex in tone compared to the regular Classics Customs due to their finishing, deep hammering and additional lathing. The peculiar finish gives this cymbal a unique dark look. ** Classics Custom Extreme Metal \u2013 These cymbals are deeply machine hammered and they have a bright and penetrating sound designed for heavier music. * HCS \u2013 Beginner/Entry-level cymbals made from a MS63 brass alloy (63% copper, 37% zinc). They are the least expensive cymbals by Meinl. ** HCS Bronze \u2013 Beginner/Intermediate-level cymbals made from B8 bronze alloy.
