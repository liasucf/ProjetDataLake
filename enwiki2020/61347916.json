    "text": "An apple cocktail is a cocktail made with apples. Flavorful apples like the honeycrisp, pink lady, and fuji tend to be favored. The golden delicious apple, on the other hand, would be disfavored because it lacks much flavor. Juicy apples also tend to be favored. Apples tend to mix well in lemon juice in many recipes, because it prevents the apple from browning. Apples can be juiced or run through a cider press, with the cider being added to a cocktail. Apple cider can also simply be spiked, e.g. with bourbon whiskey, whiskey, or dark rum, or apple brandy, and mixed with warming spices if the cider will be heated. Another option is to mix apple brandy with cider, lemon juice, and seltzer to make a sparkling drink. Sangria can be made with cider, lemon juice, dry white wine, and chunks of different colored apples. Making a shandy with ginger beer and a mix of either dry cider and apple brandy or sherry, or sweet hard cider and dry white wine, is another possibility. Apple mixes well with walnut, rosemary, orange, maple, mango, lychee, hazelnut, ginger, currant, cranberry, citrus, cinnamon, chestnut, cardamom, caramel, apricot, and almond. It mixes particularly well with vermouth, rum, Madeira wine, kirsch, and brandy. ==Examples== ===Trios=== *Pop!
