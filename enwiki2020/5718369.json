    "text": "was the 8th daimy\u014d of Aizu Domain in Mutsu Province, Japan (modern-day Fukushima Prefecture). His courtesy title was Sakonoe-gon-ch\u016bsh\u014d and Jij\u016b, and his Court rank was Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade. ==Biography== Matsudaira Katataka was born to Matsudaira Yoshikazu, the daimy\u014d of Takasu Domain, in Mino Province, and was the grandson of Tokugawa Harumori of Mito Domain. HIs youth name was Keizabur\u014d (\u6176\u4e09\u90ce). With the unexpected death of Matsudaira Katahiro without heir following so soon after Matsudaira Kataoki, the domain was in danger of attainder. To prevent this, the r\u014dj\u016b of the domain renamed Keizabur\u014d as \"Katataka\" and passed him off to the Shogunal authorities as a posthumous son of Matsudaira Kataoki, and thus a younger brother to Katahiro. The ruse worked, and he officially became daimy\u014d in 1822 with the courtesy title of Higo-no-kami. This was changed to Sakonoe-gon-sh\u014dsh\u014d in 1825 and to Sakonoe-gon-ch\u016bsh\u014d in 1827. He was wed to a daughter of Satake Yoshimasa of Kubota Domain, and re-wed after her death to a daughter of Maeda Narinaga of Kaga Domain, but he had only three daughters and no male heir. Though Matsudaira Katataka was praised by Ii Naosuke as a loyal servant of the Tokugawa shogunate, his fame was to be ultimately eclipsed by his adopted son Matsudaira Katamori (the son of his birth brother Matsudaira Yoshitatsu). ==See also== *Hoshina clan == References == * \"Aizu-han\" on Edo 300 HTML ) *Noguchi Shin'ichi (2005).
