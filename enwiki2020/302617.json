    "text": "Le\u00f3n (, ; ; ) is the capital of the province of Le\u00f3n, located in the northwest of Spain. Its city population of 127,817 (2015) makes it the largest municipality in the province, accounting for more than one quarter According to the Spanish National Institute of Statistics, consulted on 2016 of the province's population. Including the metropolitan area, the population is estimated at 202,793 (2015). Founded as the military encampment of the Legio VI Victrix around 29 BC, its standing as an encampment city was consolidated with the definitive settlement of the Legio VII Gemina from 74 AD. Following its partial depopulation due to the Umayyad conquest of the peninsula. 910 saw the beginning of one its most prominent historical periods, when it became the capital of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, which took active part in the Reconquista against the Moors, and came to be one of the fundamental kingdoms of medieval Spain. In 1188, the city hosted the first Parliament in European history under the reign of Alfonso IX, due to which it was named in 2010, by the professor John Keane, the King of Spain and the Junta of Castile and Le\u00f3n, as the cradle of Parliamentarism, and the Decreta of Le\u00f3n were included in the Memory of the World register by UNESCO in 2013. The city's prominence began to decline in the early Middle Ages, partly due to the loss of independence after the union of the Leonese kingdom with the Crown of Castile, consolidated in 1301. After a period of stagnation during the early modern age, it was one of the first cities to hold an uprising in the Spanish War of Independence, and some years later, in 1833 acquired the status of provincial capital. The end of the 19th and the 20th century saw a significant acceleration in the rate of urban expansion, when the city became an important communications hub of the northwest due to the rise of the coal mining industry and the arrival of the railroad. Le\u00f3n's historical and architectural heritage, as well as the numerous festivals hosted throughout the year (particularly noteworthy are the Easter processions) and its location on the French Way of the Camino de Santiago, which is ranked as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, make it a destination of both domestic and international tourism. Some of the city's most prominent historical buildings are the Cathedral, one of the finest examples of French-style classic Gothic architecture in Spain, the Basilica of San Isidoro, one of the most important Romanesque churches in Spain and resting place of Le\u00f3n's medieval monarchs, the Monastery of San Marcos, an example of plateresque and Renaissance Spanish architecture, and the Casa Botines, a Modernist creation of the architect Antoni Gaud\u00ed. An example of modern architecture is the city's Museum of Contemporary Art or MUSAC. ==History== ===Roman origins=== Le\u00f3n was founded in the 1st century BC by the Roman legion Legio VI Victrix, which served under Caesar Augustus during the Cantabrian Wars (29-19 BC), the final stage of the Roman conquest of Hispania. In the year 74 AD, the Legio VII Gemina \u2014recruited from the Hispanics by Galba in 69 AD\u2014 settled in a permanent military camp that was the origin of the city. Its modern name, Le\u00f3n, is derived from the city's Latin name Castra Legionis.Itin. Ant. p. 395; , Ptol. ii. 6. \u00a7 30 The Romans established the site of the city to protect the recently conquered territories of northwestern Hispania from the Astures and Cantabri, and to secure the transport of gold extracted in the province \u2014especially in the huge nearby mines of Las M\u00e9dulas\u2014 that was taken to Rome through Asturica Augusta (modern-day Astorga).Rabanal Alonso 1999, p. 192Dion Cass. iv. 24; Tac. Hist. ii. 11, iii. 25; Suet. Galba, 10. Tacitus calls the legion Galbiana, to distinguish it from the old Legio VII Claudia, but this appellation is not found on any inscriptions. It appears to have received the appellation of GeminaRespecting the use of which, and Gemella, see Caesar B.C. iii. 3 on account of its amalgamation by Vespasian with one of the German legions, probably the Legio I Germanica. Its full name was Legio VII Gemina Felix. After serving in Pannonia, and in the civil wars, it was settled by Vespasian in Hispania Tarraconensis, to supply the place of the Legio VI Victrix and Legio X Gemina, two of the three legions ordinarily stationed in the province, but which had been withdrawn to Germany.Tac. Hist. ii. 11, 67, 86, iii. 7, 10, 21--25, iv. 39; Inscr. ap. Gruter, p. 245, no. 2. That its regular winter quarters, under later emperors, were at Le\u00f3n, we learn from the Itinerary, Ptolemy, and the Notitiae Imperii, as well as from a few inscriptions;Muratori, p. 2037, no. 8, A.D. 130; p. 335, nos. 2, 3, A.D. 163; p. 336, no. 3, A.D. 167; Gruter, p. 260, no. 1, A.D. 216 but there are numerous inscriptions to prove that a strong detachment of it was stationed at Tarraco (modern Tarragona), the chief city of the province. Some elements of the original Roman encampment still survive in the modern city layout. Long sections of the Roman walls (built between the first century BC and the fourth century AD) are still standing. There are also archaeological exhibitions showing remains of the walls, gates, baths and an amphitheatre. Le\u00f3n Cathedral, main facade Hostal de San Marcos Gardens of Plaza de San Marcos ===Kingdom of Le\u00f3n=== The post-Roman history of the city is largely the history of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n. The station of the legion in the territory of the Astures grew into an important city, which resisted the attacks of the Visigoths until AD 586, when it was taken by Leovigild; and it was one of the few cities which the Visigoths allowed to retain their fortifications. During the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, in 715 Tariq advanced from the area of La Rioja towards Astorga and Le\u00f3n. The same fortress, which the Romans had built to protect the plain from the incursions of the mountaineers, became the advanced post which covered the mountain, as the last refuge of Cisastur Tribes. However, there is no notice of resistance whatsoever. An attempt was made by the invaders to settle the strongholds with Berbers came in a military capacity, but the scheme was abandoned when the Berbers of northern Iberia rebelled against the Arabs and gave up their positions to join the revolt around 740. Towards the year 846, a group of Mozarabs (Christians who did not flee from the Muslims and lived under the Muslim regime) tried to repopulate the city, but a Muslim attack prevented that initiative. In the year 856, under the Christian king Ordo\u00f1o I, another attempt at repopulation was made and was successful. Alfonso III of Le\u00f3n and Garc\u00eda I of Le\u00f3n made Le\u00f3n city the capital of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n and the most important of the Christian cities in Iberia. The Kingdom of Le\u00f3n started as an independent Kingdom in 910 when the seat of Asturias moved to Le\u00f3n, but there was no such thing as an official name change. Sacked by Almanzor in about 987, the city was reconstructed and repopulated by Alfonso V, whose Decree of 1017 regulated its economic life, including the functioning of its markets. Le\u00f3n was a way- station for pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago leading to Santiago de Compostela. With Alfonso V of Le\u00f3n the city had the \"Fueru de Lli\u00f3n\", an important letter of privileges. The Kingdom of Le\u00f3n conquered the Leonese Extremadura under Alfonso IX. After his death his son Fernando III, already king of Castile, joined both crowns in 1230. His son, Alfonso X divided the kingdom again in his testament, but it was not accepted by the King of Castile, who rejoined both crowns. From 1296 to 1301, Le\u00f3n was an independent kingdom again, and from then until 1833, when Spain was divided into regions and provinces, the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n kept itself as a Spanish Crown territory, whose capital city was Le\u00f3n apart from a short period, during which French troops invaded the Kingdom when it was Carracedo. ===First democratic Parliament in 1188=== In 1188, Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n joined in the city of Le\u00f3n all the three states becoming the city in the first European Parliament, developing laws that protected the people. Suburbs for traders and artisans sprang up, who, after the 13th century, began to influence the municipal government. During the early Middle Ages, the livestock industry produced a period of prosperity for the city. Former city hall ===Recent history=== In the 16th century, economic and demographic decline set in and continued until the 19th century. In July 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, Le\u00f3n joined the war against the Republicans. During the 1960s, Le\u00f3n experienced much growth due to in-migration from the rural zones of the province. In 1983 Le\u00f3n was added to the neighbouring region of Castile, to form the Autonomous Community of Castile and Le\u00f3n. A popular and local political movement was opposed to being ruled from Madrid. Consequently, Le\u00f3n is the centre of a peaceful political movement for Leonese autonomy. Some of the Leonese people support the idea of creating a Leonese autonomous community formed by the provinces of Salamanca, Le\u00f3n and Zamora, which have traditionally composed the Leonese Region. The Palacio de los Guzmanes, the provincial parliament (Diputaci\u00f3n) in the capital ==Main sights== *Rayonnant gothic Cathedral. It is one of the most relevant examples of the Gothic style in Spain, almost all of it built from 1205 to 1301. It contains one of the most extensive and best preserved collections of medieval stained glass in Europe, with at least 1,764 square meters of surface, most of it containing the original windows. *Basilica of San Isidoro, a highlight of Romanesque architecture in Spain. Built during the 11th and 12th centuries AD, the complex includes a subterranean Royal Pantheon with 12th century painted murals in an exceptional state of preservation. *Convent of San Marcos (currently a luxurious parador) built from the 16th century AD to the 18th. Its most striking feature is a highly ornamental plateresque fa\u00e7ade. *Palacio de los Guzmanes, the site of the provincial diputaci\u00f3n (parliament). It contains a patio in the plateresque style by Gil de Honta\u00f1\u00f3n.

It is a contemporary art museum which opened in 2005. Its design by the architectural studio Mansilla+Tu\u00f1\u00f3n was awarded with the 2007 European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture. One of the building's most distinctive features is its fa\u00e7ade formed out of thousands of large multicolored stained-glass panels. Close to the museum is the Le\u00f3n Auditorium, also projected by Mansilla+Tu\u00f1\u00f3n, which has an equally striking presence of crisp white cubes perforated by irregularly set windows. *Museo de Le\u00f3n, which contains a collection of prehistorical tools and art from the Roman, Medieval and Modern periods. *Museo Sierra-Pambley, a house from the Age of Enlightenment *University of Le\u00f3n. ==Folklore and customs== Leonese customs include the Semana Santa (\"Holy Week\"), featuring numerous processions through the centre of the city. One of them is the so-called \"Procession of the Meeting\", which acts out the meeting of three groups representing Saint John, the Virgin Mary and Christ, in the esplanade in front of the old council. Associated with Semana Santa is the procession called \"The Burial of Genar\u00edn\". Genar\u00edn was an alcoholic beggar who was hit by and killed by the first garbage truck in the city of Le\u00f3n in the year 1929. This is a celebration of alcohol, and the main purpose of the people who attend it is getting drunk in honor to the alcoholic beggar. The San Juan and San Pedro festivities are also remarkable, celebrated during the last week of June (between June 23 and June 29). During these days several concerts and festivals take place and the whole city is occupied by terraces and street markets where Leonese people celebrate the beginning of the summer, especially on San Juan's night (June 23) when fireworks and bonfires take place. ==Districts== The city of Le\u00f3n can be divided into more than 36 districts (barrios): *Centro or downtown *Casco Antiguo or Casco Hist\u00f3rico, the historical part of the city *\u00c1rea 17 *Armunia *Cruce de Armunia *El Crucero *El Ejido *Ensanche *Eras De Renueva *Ferral *La Asunci\u00f3n *La Chantr\u00eda *La Lastra *La Palomera *La Sal *La Torre *La Vega *La Victoria *Las Ventas *Obra Sindical Del Hogar *Oteruelo De La Valdoncina *Para\u00edso-Cantinas *Patronato Viviendas Militares *Pinilla *Puente Castro *San Andr\u00e9s del Rabanedo *San Claudio *San Esteban *San Lorenzo *San Mam\u00e9s *San Marcelo *San Marcos *San Mart\u00edn *San Pedro *Santa Ana *Santa Marina *Santa Olaja *Pol\u00edgono 10 *Trobajo Del Cerecedo *Trobajo Del Camino *Villabalter ==Climate== Le\u00f3n features a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csb).

Besides the buses, there are plans to introduce tram lines in the city. ==Leonese language== Palacio del Conde Luna ===History=== The Leonese language derives directly from Latin and developed in the Middle Ages. At this time, Leonese was the official language of the Leonese Kingdom and achieved a high codification grade in the city of Lli\u00f3n. The first written text in Leonese was Nodicia de Kesos (959 or 974); other works in the language include Fueru de Lli\u00f3n, Fueru de Salamanca, Fueru Xulgu, C\u00f3dice d'Alfonsu XI, ou Disputa d'Elena y Mar\u00eda or Llibru d'AlixandreMen\u00e9ndez Pidal, R. \"El Dialecto Leon\u00e9s\". Madrid. 1906 Leonese is considered a seriously endangered language by UNESCO. It is almost extinct, being known and spoken by only a very few elderly people who live isolated in the mountains of the northern part of the province of Le\u00f3n. However, people who wish to separate Le\u00f3n from Castile and who support Leonese autonomy are trying to revive the language. Le\u00f3n City Council and Leonese language associations like the Asociaci\u00f3n Cultural de la Llingua Ll\u00efonesa El Fueyu are promoting its knowledge and use. Leonese Language Day started in 2006 with the support of Leonese Provincial Government, and from 2008 the celebration is organised by the Le\u00f3n City Council. ===Teaching=== At the end of the 1990s, several associations unofficially promoted Leonese language courses. In 2001, the Universidad de Le\u00f3n (University of Le\u00f3n) created a course for Teachers of Leonese language, and local government developed Leonese language courses for adults. The Leonese Language Teachers and Monitors Association (Asociaci\u00f3n de Profesores y Monitores de Llingua Ll\u00efonesa) was created in 2008 and promotes Leonese language activities. Leonese lessons in schools started in 2008, and it is currently taught in sixteen schools in Le\u00f3n city in 2008\u20132009, promoted by the Leonese Local Government Department for Education. This course is for pupils in their 5th and 6th year of primary school (11- and 12-year-olds), where Leonese language is taught with Leonese culture. More than one hundred people are studying Leonese in adult classes in 2008\u20132009. There are five levels for adults in the official courses developed by the Department for Leonese Culture of the Leonese City Council.\"Cuasi douscientos alunos estudiar\u00e1n Llingua Ll\u00efonesa esti a\u00f1u\".
