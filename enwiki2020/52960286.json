The boat was built by CS Yachts in Canada, with 480 examples completed between 1975 and 1983, when production ended. ==Design== The CS 27 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has a masthead sloop rig, a transom-hung rudder and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of ballast. The boat has a draft of with the standard iron-ballasted keel and with the optional longer shoal draft lead-ballasted keel. About 90 were built with the shoal draft keel. The boat was initially fitted with a Japanese Yanmar YSE diesel engine and later a Yanmar 1GM model. In 1977 an increased area rudder with more added to the leading edge for better helm balance was introduced and this new rudder design could be retrofitted to older boats. In 1980 the mast was changed from a Proctor to an Isomat section along with small interior improvements. The boat has a PHRF racing average handicap of 207 with a high of 204 and low of 216. It has a hull speed of . ==Operational history== Notable examples include the CS 27 Sea Weasel which achieved a second place in West Vancouver Yacht Club's 2014 Southern Straits Classic. In a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, \"Boats with a length of twenty-seven feet and a displacement topping 6000 pounds will generally have more in common with 30 footers than the outboard powered boats in the 25 to 26 foot range. This is certainly true of the CS 27. It is a fast boat with real adult size room below decks, and it comes with an inboard diesel, double lifelines, two speed winches, a pressurized fresh water system, and a huge 5.8 cubic foot ice box. The CS 27 is a sleek boat that was built strong enough for some serious ocean sailing.\" ==See also== CS 27 *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Aloha 27 *Cal 27 *Cal 2-27 *Cal 3-27 *Catalina 27 *Catalina 270 *Catalina 275 Sport *C&C; 27 *Crown 28 *Edel 820 *Express 27 *Fantasia 27 *Halman Horizon *Hotfoot 27 *Hullmaster 27 *Hunter 27 *Hunter 27-2 *Hunter 27-3 *Irwin 27 *Island Packet 27 *Mirage 27 (Perry) *Mirage 27 (Schmidt) *Mirage 275 *O'Day 272 *Orion 27-2 *Watkins 27 *Watkins 27P ==References== ==External links== Category:Keelboats ",
