Mr Rutter's two deputes are Ms. Fife and Mrs. Huggan. ==History== After occupying various sites around the city, it moved to its current location, in Dalneigh, in 1937. At that time, it was renamed the Technical High School and specialised in providing vocational courses. It kept this name until 1959 when it adopted its current name.
