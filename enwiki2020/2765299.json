The southern terminus is in North Houston at Interstate 45 (I-45). The current northern terminus of the highway is east of Magnolia at the intersection of Farm to Market Road 1488 (FM 1488). ==Route description== HCTRA, while the 249 Tollway is maintained by MCTRA. SH 249 is signed only on the frontage roads. The section of SH 249 north of its junction with Beltway 8 is referred to by area residents as the Tomball Parkway because it leads to and is the main road through Tomball. Along the east-west section between I-45 and West Montgomery, it is called West Mount Houston Road. West Mount Houston Road, however, actually extends east past the intersection of SH 249 at I-45. ===Tomball Tollway section=== ====Phase I==== Phase one runs for from just north of Spring Cypress Road, the current terminus of the existing free lanes to just north of the existing Tomball bypass. The Tomball Tollway is three lanes in each direction that are used to bypass seven stoplights and will only accept electronic toll-tags (EZ Tag, TollTag and TxTag) as no cash payments will be allowed; the total cost of the toll for HCTRA's segment is $1.50 for two-axle vehicles, while the SH 249 frontage roads will remain free to all drivers. Construction of phase one began in fall 2013 and was completed on 12 April 2015. ====Phase II==== Phase two extends the tollway into Montgomery County from Business SH 249-B to Sentinel Oaks in Montgomery County north of Spring Creek. This $335 million project was overseen by the Harris and Montgomery County toll road authorities. Construction on Phase 2 commenced in fall 2016 and was opened to traffic on December 19, 2019. ===MCTRA 249 Tollway section=== From Spring Creek to FM 1774 in Pinehurst, the tolled mainlanes of SH 249 will be maintained by the Montgomery County Toll Road Authority.HCTRA System Map www.hctra.org Signed as MCTRA 249 Tollway, the first section to open was between Spring Creek and Sentinel Oaks (coinciding with Phase two of the HCTRA segment) on December 19, 2019.

The highway's importance grew after Compaq Computer Corporation (now known as Hewlett-Packard) moved its headquarters close to the intersection of SH 249 and Louetta Rd. In 2003, a portion of SH 249 in Tomball was renamed Business SH 249B from Hicks Road to Holderreith Road. This is because of bypass that bypasses Tomball on the west side of the city. In 2015, SH 249 was extended northwest 24.4 miles from FM 149 and FM 1774 to SH 105 near Stoneham. A section of SH 249 from Woodtrace Boulevard to FM 149 was renumbered as a southern extension of FM 1774 in December 2019. On August 8, 2020, the section of SH 249 from FM 1774 to FM 1488 was opened. Previously, SH 249 was designated on June 22, 1937 from then-SH 73 (now Interstate 10) near San Felipe north to the Brazos River. The route was redesignated on May 9, 1940 as Texas Spur 99. The route became part of Farm to Market Road 1458 on January 20, 1966. ==Future== Current plans call for the highway to extend to the Bryan\u2013College Station area. Continued growth in the Bryan/College Station, Conroe and NW Houston regions have congested existing roadways, including SH 105 and FM 1774. Texas A&M; University and businesses in the Bryan/College Station area would benefit from faster connections to Bush-Intercontinental Airport, the Port of Houston and the Texas Medical Center. A bypass of Magnolia, Texas is desirable because of the large traffic load every October due to the annual Renaissance fair. Decreased funding for road projects in recent years had stalled the extension of SH 249. However the rapid growth in the area has led to a renewed push in 2012 to build further segments. Plans for the middle segments (Pinehurst-Todd Mission) and north segment (Todd Mission-Navasota) were revived by the Texas Department of Transportation in early 2013. TxDOT has formed a working group with local officials and stakeholders to discuss alternatives for the SH 249 corridor. The segment from Sentinel Oaks to FM 1774 in Pinehurst (maintained by MCTRA) opened in spring 2020. From FM 1774 in Pinehurst, north up to SH 105 in Grimes County, SH 249 will be under the jurisdiction of TxDOT. The remaining portion of SH 249 in Montgomery County from FM 1488 to FM 1774 in Todd Mission is projected to be completed in spring 2021. In Grimes County, the north segment will be constructed as a non-tolled two-lane freeway.SH 249 - Todd Mission to Navasota (Schematics) Texas Department of Transportation. 2 October 2019 (Retrieved 16 August 2020) Construction in Grimes County began in late 2018 and is projected to be completed in spring 2023. ==Popular culture== The country music group Eli Young Band references \"Highway 249\" in their 2008 single \"Always the Love Songs.\" Several of the band members grew up in Tomball. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== Category:State highways in Texas Category:Toll roads in Texas Texas State Highway 249 Texas State Highway 249 Texas State Highway 249 Texas State Highway 249 ",
