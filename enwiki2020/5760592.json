    "text": "Unexpect (often stylized as uneXpect, or unexpecT, and UnexpecT) was a Canadian avant-garde extreme metal band from Montr\u00e9al, Canada, featuring a unique amalgamation of different metal subgenres like progressive, technical death, black and melodic heavy metal, and of other styles of music including classical, dark cabaret, opera, jazz, funk, electro, ambient, noise, and circus music. The band's debut album, Utopia, was independently released. The band only had word of mouth and the Internet to market the work. With unorthodox distribution and online support, the album sold successfully. They released their two following albums via The End Records, before returning to independent releases. ==History== Two of the founding members had a long tenure with the band: Artagoth and SyriaK. Unexpect recorded their first album, Utopia, in 1998, and released it in 1999 independently. The 2003 EP _We, Invaders was released in November 2003 on the Canadian label Galy Records. They then signed with New York-based The End Records and the band's second album In a Flesh Aquarium was released on August 22, 2006, in North America. Unexpect released their third album, Fables of the Sleepless Empire, on May 31, 2011. The band won the 7th annual Independent Music Awards Vox Pop vote for best Hard Rock/Metal Album with In a Flesh Aquarium. On August 22, 2015, after the band had been inactive for almost three years, and with few updates, an announcement was made on their official Facebook page stating the members had decided to disband for good and pursue their own personal musical endeavours.Unexpect disband, Sputnikmusic.com, Retrieved 2015-09-11 ==Members== Last line-up * Eryk \"Syriak\" Chapados \u2013 lead vocals, guitar (1996\u20132015) (ex-Ekinox, ex-Magister Dixit) * St\u00e9phane \"Artagoth\" English \u2013 lead vocals, guitar (1996\u20132015) * Roxanne \"Le\u00eflindel\" Hegyesy \u2013 lead vocals (2001\u20132015) * Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick \"ChaotH\" Filiatrault \u2013 bass (2001\u20132015) (Humanoid) * Landryx \u2013 drums (2004\u20132015) (ex-Decadawn, ex-Eclipse Prophecy) * Blaise Borbo\u00ebn-L\u00e9onard \u2013 violin (2007\u20132015) Session members * Nathalie Duchesne - additional violin, cello (2003\u20132015) * St\u00e9phanie Colerette - additional violin, cello (2003\u20132015) * Am\u00e9lie Blanchette - clarinet (2006\u20132015) Former members * V\u00e9ronique \"Elda\" Michaud \u2013 lead vocals (1996\u20132001) * Mathieu \"Zircon\" Phaneuf \u2013 bass (1996\u20132001) * Olivier \"Merzenya\" Genest \u2013 keyboards (1996\u20132001) * Anthony Trujillo \u2013 drums (2002) * Dasnos \u2013 drums (2003) * Charles \"Le Bateleur\" Cr\u00e9peau \u2013 violin (1996\u20132006) * St\u00e9phane \"ExoD\" Primeau \u2013 drums (1996-2002), keyboards, piano, sampling (2002-2010) ===Timeline=== ImageSize = width:900 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:60 bottom:80 top:5 right:10 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1996 till:01/01/2016 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:violin value:drabgreen legend:Violin id:guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:keyboards value:purple legend:Keyboards id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:lines1 value:black legend:Studio_release id:bars value:gray(0.95) BackgroundColors = bars:bars Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4 ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:2 start:1996 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1997 BarData = bar:Elda text:Elda bar:Le\u00eflindel text:Le\u00eflindel bar:LeBateleur text:Le Bateleur bar:Blaise text:Blaise bar:Syriak text:Syriak bar:Artagoth text:Artagoth bar:Merzenya text:Merzenya bar:Zircon text:Zircon bar:ChaotH text:ChaotH bar:ExoD text:ExoD bar:Anthony text:Anthony bar:Dasnos text:Dasnos bar:Landryx text:Landryx PlotData= width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Elda from:start till:01/01/2001 color:vocals bar:Le\u00eflindel from:01/01/2001 till:end color:vocals bar:Syriak from:start till:end color:guitar bar:Syriak from:start till:end color:vocals width:3 bar:Artagoth from:start till:end color:guitar bar:Artagoth from:start till:end color:vocals width:3 bar:Zircon from:start till:01/01/2001 color:bass bar:ChaotH from:01/01/2001 till:end color:bass bar:Merzenya from:start till:01/01/2001 color:keyboards bar:ExoD from:start till:01/01/2002 color:drums bar:ExoD from:01/01/2002 till:01/01/2011 color:keyboards bar:Anthony from:01/01/2002 till:01/01/2003 color:drums bar:Dasnos from:01/01/2003 till:01/01/2004 color:drums bar:Landryx from:01/01/2004 till:end color:drums bar:LeBateleur from:start till:01/01/2007 color:violin bar:Blaise from:01/01/2007 till:end color:violin LineData= at:01/01/1999 color:lines1 layer:back at:11/01/2003 at:08/22/2006 at:05/31/2011 ==Discography== * Utopia (1999, self-released) * _wE, Invaders EP (2003, Galy Records; distributed by The End Records) * In a Flesh Aquarium (2006, The End Records) * Fables of the Sleepless Empire (2011, self-released) ==References== ==External links== * , archived on July 28, 2015 * UneXpect at The End Records Category:Canadian progressive metal musical groups Category:Avant-garde metal musical groups Category:Musical groups from Montreal Category:Musical groups established in 1996 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2015 Category:1996 establishments in Quebec Category:2015 disestablishments in Quebec ",
