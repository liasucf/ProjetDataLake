    "text": "A samurai bond is a yen-denominated bond issued in Tokyo by non-Japanese companies, and is subject to Japanese regulations. These bonds provide the issuer with an access to Japanese capital, which can be used for local investments or for financing operations outside Japan. Foreign borrowers may want to issue in Samurai market to hedge against foreign currency exchange risk. Another intention may be simultaneously exchanging the issue into another currency, in order to take advantage of lower costs. Lower costs may result from investor preferences that differ across segmented markets or from temporary market conditions that differentially affect the swaps and bond markets. ==History== Samurai Bond Market was opened in 1970 when the Japanese Ministry of Finance authorized supranational and highly rated foreign government entities to issue Samurai bonds within certain size and maturity restrictions. The market opened due to growing Japanese foreign currency reserves during late 60\u2019s. The exchange rate of the yen at that time was fixed at 360 yen per US dollar. It was revalued to 308 yen in 1971 and moved to a floating rate system in February 1973. To discourage foreign exchange pressure, the Japanese government decided to open capital market allowing foreign entities to issue yen-denominated bonds. However, at the time the market opened, only governmental entities could issue bonds. The Blue chip corporations were allowed to issue Samurai bond later in 1978. The Asian Development Bank issued the first Samurai bond in November 1970. The issue amount was 6 billion yen with a 7-year maturity, and the bond was accepted very well in the market. At first, Asian Development Bank and other high credit supranational issuers were given an access priority to the market. To control stream of issuance, these special criteria were established. Those who were unable to meet eligibility criteria could finance yen through yen- denominated private placement bonds. They were permitted to target a restricted number of institutional investments, and terms and liquidity were under close control. In 1972 the first non-Japanese 10 billion yen bond was issued by Australia. In 1979, Sears made the first corporate Samurai bond issue for 20 billion yen. At that time, Samurai market gradually became accessible to more issuers through the alleviation of eligibility criteria, which now required minimum credit ratings, and through liberalization of new kinds of bonds. In addition, Samurai bonds provided an opportunity of issuing in two different currencies, as well as interest and principal were paid in ether of these currencies. ===Liquidation of rating requirement=== In 1984, a liberalization step was taken to reduce the required minimum credit rating from double A to single A. In 1991, the minimum rating requirement for foreign governments, central banks, and foreign government-guaranteed institutions was lowered to triple-B. In January 1996, Samurai market eliminated the minimum requirement for credit rating, increasing private sector share of the Samurai bond market. ===Required standards=== The eligibility criteria for issuing Samurai bonds were not loosened until April 1985. When examining applications from potential samurai issuers, the Ministry of Finance considered the tendency of the Japanese capital account balance and the liquidity in the country\u2019s economy. For the actual issuance of Samurai bonds, the Japanese Ministry of Finance set a quota per quarter year, and employed a queue system. Borrowers, if they agreed upon the terms of underwriting, entered the quota by rotation from the top of the queue. In 1998, the Ministry of Finance\u2019s close regulatory control was annulled. ==Deregulation of Samurai market== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year !! Deregulation measure !! Remarks !!
