Their own philosophy, \u201ccaring for the sick as if they were Christ in person,\u201d is taken from the Rule of St. Benedict by which the Sisters lived. Due to expansion, a new hospital in Washington Terrace was dedicated in 1977. The construction of the new hospital on its new campus led to the development of several medical office buildings. These buildings housed numerous hospital programs while providing convenient office space for many physicians and related health care activities. In July 1977, the Val A. Browning Radiation Therapy Center, now called the Val A. Browning Cancer Treatment Center, opened its doors to treat cancer patients from throughout Northern Utah and surrounding states. As a result, St. Benedict's helped organize the Hospice of Northern Utah for terminally ill patients and their relatives. On Mother's Day, 1992, they opened a new Women's and Children's Center, which also housed OB/GYN and pediatric physician offices. A new neonatal intensive care unit had opened previously in November 1987. The hospital has continued to grow and has invested millions of dollars in advanced equipment and facilities. Modern technologies have become a part of everyday procedures. To further strengthen its cardiology program, the cardiac catheterization lab was upgraded, allowing the hospital to implement its nationally rated open-heart surgery program. St. Benedict's has been affiliated with various organizations. Since 1995, the hospital, now called Ogden Regional Medical Center, has been part of what is now Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), the world's largest hospital company. In May 2000, Ogden Regional Medical Center joined with five other HCA-affiliated hospitals in Utah to announce a new network named MountainStar Healthcare. ==References== Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1946 Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1977 Category:Hospitals in Utah Category:Buildings and structures in Weber County, Utah Category:MountainStar Healthcare Category:Hospitals established in 1946 Category:HCA Healthcare Category:Trauma Center ",
