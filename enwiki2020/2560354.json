It starts from Knightsbridge Underground station and runs south-west through an extremely wealthy residential area until it reaches Egerton Gardens and the area to the east of South Kensington Underground station. It ends at what is popularly known as Brompton Cross, becoming Fulham Road, home of Chelsea Football Club. There are 5-star hotels and many top restaurants and shops along the road. One of the most famous department stores in the world, Harrods, is located near the eastern end. Another major landmark along the road is the Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, commonly known as the Brompton Oratory. The Embassy of Uruguay is located at no. 150. Brompton Road Underground station was halfway between Knightsbridge and South Kensington stations on the Piccadilly line, just east of the Brompton Oratory. It closed on 30 July 1934 due to a lack of traffic and following the opening of new entrances at Knightsbridge station. Brompton Road is sometimes confused with Old Brompton Road which lies further to the west in South Kensington. ==See also== * Brompton, London ==References== ==External links== Category:Streets in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Brompton Road Category:Streets in the City of Westminster Category:Knightsbridge Category:A4 road (England) ",
