    "text": "Ted Kendall is a British musical restorer and a mastering engineer. ==Biography== In the 1980s, Kendall was a recording engineer working for the British Broadcasting Corporation. He is credited with having rediscovered lost transcription recordings of several episodes of a BBC Radio science fiction programme, Journey into Space, which he carefully cleaned up and remastered. In 1988, he left and set up his own mastering studio in Wales, which has been fitted out with modern digital mastering equipment. Recently, he has been credited with having assembled a unique collection of the highest available quality source material from The Goon Show, which he once again carefully cleaned up and remastered using modern digital equipment and techniques. Pre- recorded sound effects on The Goon Show, played into each performance by 'Grams Operators', were taken from disc lacquers and shellac. The infamous 'Fred the Oyster' effect required declicking and decrackling as the source was a Columbia shellac 78. Kendall removed large and small clicks, and the crackle from all of The Goon Show sound effects, except those scratches which were part of the gag. Recently he has been responsible for the preparation of the Goon Show Compendium CD box sets, commencing in 2008 with Volume One. These include all of the Goon Shows from Series 5 onward plus bonus features, including the complete series of The Omar Khayyam Show on Volume Eleven. Nine episodes for which commercial rights were previously held by EMI appear out of sequence on Volume Twelve. Volume Thirteen contains the only surviving off-air recordings of episodes from series 2 and 3 and from the first half of series 4. Booklets included with the sets include Technical Notes by Kendall. The special \"The Starlings\", and the original version of \"The Greatest Mountain in the World\" (the only episode from Series 4 to survive in the BBC Archive) are expected to be included, together with the remaining off-air episode from that series, on Volume Fourteen (projected for 2018), although these have previously been issued on two-CD Goon Show compilations. He has used his CEDAR Series 2 rackmount units to restore a number of well-known recordings and performers such as Django Reinhardt and Harry James, and pioneering recordings of the Mahler symphonies. The Harry James album (Hep Records) was originally recorded onto 16\" coarse-grooved vinyl discs, which were extremely noisy due to the medium and its age. Kendall was able to remove unwanted noise, ranging from light ticks to large scratches, with appropriate adjustment of his equipment. Kendall has also recently restored the first LP recordings of three Mahler symphonies. The performances by Charles Adler were originally recorded in Vienna during the 1950s for the American SPA label, and the recordings have a wide dynamic range. Kendall removed unwanted clicks and crackle and, with the aid of sophisticated equipment, smoothed odd patches of distortion. ==Awards== *Kendall is the winner of the 1998 CEDAR Award for 'CD Remastering From a Vintage Recording - Pre 1950'.
