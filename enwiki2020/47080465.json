    "text": "in Japan is a ceremony where a shikomi (an aspiring geisha) becomes a maiko (an apprentice geisha) and officially begins their career. The maiko is guided around her local area to call on businesses, teachers, and other okiya by her okiya's otokoshi (male dresser) to thank her teachers and peers for their support and to let them know of her debut. Maiko are usually 17 or 18 when this ceremony takes place as post-WWII labor laws prevent maiko from beginning their employment as apprentices at an earlier age as in pre-WWII eras. Some apprentices, however, skip the maiko stage, being too old to debut as a young apprentice, and instead begin their apprenticeship appearing as a geisha. ==Attire== Because the debut is considered one of the most important moments of a geisha's career, only the most formal attire is worn. ; : Wareshinobu is a nihongami hairstyle for junior maiko. A mage (bun) is made by inserting two red kanako (padded silk) and is then decorated with a kanokodome in the center of the mage. For misedashi, they will wear formal kanzashi (traditional hair ornaments) made out of tortoise shell, silver and red miokuri, and two bira bira. ; : Oshiroi is the makeup worn by geisha and is usually applied by the wearer, but because of the importance of the misedashi ceremony, a professional will do it. ; : Kuromontsuki hikizuri (trailing black kimono with mon) is a formal black trailing kimono that has five okiya mon embroidered on the shoulders at the front, back, and center back. Hikizuri are usually 200 cm long with a padded hem to create weight so it will trail beautifully on the floor. When outside, a maiko will hold her hikizuri up with her hands or tie it in place so that it does not touch the ground. ; : The darari obi is a 6-7 meters long obi worn exclusively by maiko. At the end of the darari obi is a crest, so that every one can see which okiya the maiko belongs to. For formal occasions, the maiko will wear a gold obi. ==References== * , Category:Geisha ",
