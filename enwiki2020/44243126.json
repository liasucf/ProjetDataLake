Spirits Rejoice is proof that there was an underlying logic even to Ayler's most extreme moments, and that's why it remains a tremendously inspiring recording\".Huey, S., Allmusic Review, accessed October 29, 2014. ==Track listing== All compositions by Albert Ayler # \"Spirits Rejoice\" - 11:41 # \"Holy Family\" - 2:11 # \"D.
