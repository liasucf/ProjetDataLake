Prasanna turned music composer with this film.https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/kollywood/090817/krishna- is-an-omniphobic-in-kalari.htmlKiran had filmed the project in Vathuruthy owing to its large Tamil population and its proximity to a railway track, which features throughout the film. In regard to the title, Krishna noted the film has nothing to do with kalaripayattu, the art form. He stated that \"kalari\" in Tamil means war and the film dealt with the internal and external wars of his character in the film. The shoot of the film began in January 2017 and continued throughout the year.https://www.desimartini.com/news/tamil/vidya-pradeep-drifts-to-ktown- article43587.htmhttps://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/kollywood/270117/vidya- pradeep-goes-to-sandalwood.htmlhttp://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movies-cinema- news-17/vidya-pradeep-talks-about-her-role-in-atharvaas-othaikku-otha.html == Release== The Times of India gave the film two out of five stars and wrote that \"Kalari is let down by the dated treatment.
