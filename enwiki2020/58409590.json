He took squad number 24, and was included in the squad for the UEFA Champions League campaign, where they faced Valletta in the first qualifying round; he was an unused substitute in both legs as Kuk\u00ebsi managed to progress on away goal rule. He made his competitive debut for the club on 25 July in the first leg of second qualifying round versus Qaraba\u011f which ended in a goalless draw. Maliqi also played in the returning leg at Tofiq Bahramov Republican Stadium, which was lost 3\u20130, solidifying his position in the starting lineup. Kuk\u00ebsi then continued in the UEFA Europa League, facing Georgia's Torpedo Kutaisi in the third qualifying round. Maliqi was included in the team to travel to Georgia for the first leg, but his visa and Valon Ethemi, Reginaldo and Faton Maloku's was denied the Georgian authorities. Maliqi eventually did not play, as Kuk\u00ebsi lost 5\u20132. He returned for the second leg and played full-90 minutes, and despite Kuk\u00ebsi winning 2\u20130 win at Elbasan Arena, they were eliminated on aggregate. Maliqi made his Albanian Superliga appearance on 19 August by playing in the 1\u20131 draw versus La\u00e7i in the opening matchday. ==International career== Maliqi begun his international career in September 2012 by playing in two friendlies versus Poland; the first match was won 1\u20130 while the second was lost with the same result. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Rabotni\u010dki |2011\u201312 |rowspan=\"2\"|First League |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- |2012\u201313 |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !2!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!2||0 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Shkupi |2015\u201316 |rowspan=\"3\"|First League |9||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9||0 |- |2016\u201317 |31||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2All appearance(s) in Relegation play- off||0||34||0 |- |2017\u201318 |31||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||31||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !71!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!2!!0!!74!!0 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Kuk\u00ebsi |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1\"|Albanian Superliga |3||0||0||0||3Two appearances in UEFA Champions League, one appearance in UEFA Europa League||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !3!!0!!0!!0!!3!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!6!!0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !76!!0!!1!!0!!3!!0!!2!!0!!82!!0 |} ==References== ==External links== *FSHF profile * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Veles, North Macedonia Category:Albanians in North Macedonia Category:Association football defenders Category:Macedonian footballers Category:North Macedonia youth international footballers Category:FK Rabotni\u010dki players Category:FK Shkupi players Category:FK Kuk\u00ebsi players Category:Macedonian First Football League players Category:Albanian Superliga players Category:Macedonian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Albania Category:Macedonian expatriate sportspeople in Albania ",
