One or two individuals are recognised annually by the Prize for their work promoting sound science and evidence despite hostility. The prize was started in 2012 in commemoration of John Maddox, former editor-in-chief of Nature, who was distinguished in his advancement of science for the public interest. His daughter, Bronwen Maddox, is the current patron of the Prize. Winners receive a monetary award and an announcement is published in Nature. ==Past winners== There have been 11 John Maddox Prize winners since its inception in 2012.https://senseaboutscience.org/activities/maddox-prize-winners ===2012=== In 2012, the John Maddox Prize was awarded to British psychiatrist Simon Wessely and Chinese science writer Shi-min Fang.https://www.nature.com/news/john-maddox- prize-1.11750https://www.nature.com/news/courage-for-sound-science-wins-john- maddox-prize-1.11760 Wessely was recognised for persevering in his research of the neuropsychiatric elements of chronic fatigue syndrome despite death threats, and Fang was recognised for his work exposing pseudoscience and fraud as a popular science writer in China.
