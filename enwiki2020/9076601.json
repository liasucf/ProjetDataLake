    "text": "Vestmannaeyjar Airport () is a two-runway airport on the island of Heimaey, in Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands), a small archipelago off the south coast of Iceland. It is also known as Westman Islands Airport. The main carrier was previously Air Iceland, which flew multiple daily flights to Reykjav\u00edk Airport. However, due to unresolved dispute with local government regarding flight subsidizing, the carrier ended all scheduled activity on 3 August 2010. Currently the main carrier is Eagle Air. Vestmannaeyjar Airport has scheduled and private flights to Bakki Airport on the southern coast of Iceland, taking approximately seven minutes (depending on the weather) or by about 25-minute flight to Reykjav\u00edk Airport. ==History== During Eldfell's volcanic eruption in 1973, Vestmannaeyjar Airport served as an evacuation point for elderly and patients from the hospital who could not evacuate by boat. After the eruption was over, the tephra provided suitable materials to extend the runways. ==Airlines and scheduled destinations== ==References== ==External links== * Category:Airports in Iceland Airport ",
