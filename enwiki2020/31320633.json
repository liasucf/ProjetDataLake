    "text": "The Jersey J Cup, also known as the Chris Candido Memorial J-Cup Tournament, is an annual professional wrestling tournament held by Funkdafied Wrestling Federation (FwF), typically between April and June. Modeled after the Super J-Cup by New Japan Pro-Wrestling, it is the second-oldest tournament in United States after the East Coast Wrestling Association's Super 8 Tournament. The wrestlers in the tournament are typically junior heavyweight wrestlers from independent promotions all over North America. The tournament has been hosted by New Jersey-based Jersey Championship Wrestling (2000-2004), National Wrestling Superstars (2005-2012)and Funkdafied Wrestling Federation (2013-). These promotions have held a combined 11 J-Cup tournaments. No wrestler has ever won the tournament twice, however, a number of participants have entered the tournament multiple times. Devon Moore is the wrestler who has participated in the most J-Cups as he has wrestled in all NWS tournaments except the 2007 tournament. His participation in the 2010 tournament marked his 5th Jersey J-Cup tournament. ==History and format== The tournament was formed in 2000 by Jersey Championship Wrestling. It was originally created by JCW founder Ricky Otazu, inspired by the success of the ECWA Super 8 Tournament, as an American counterpart to New Japan Pro Wrestling's Super J-Cup to showcase the top independent wrestlers in the country. The tournament was regularly hosted by JCW until its close in 2004 whereupon it was taken over by National Wrestling Superstars. In 2005, shortly after purchasing the rights to the J-Cup Tournament, NWS promoter Joe Panzarino announced that the tournament would be renamed the Chris Candido Memorial J-Cup Tournament, and the J-Cup renamed the Chris Candido Memorial J-Cup Trophy. Subsequently, the tournament has been changed with the opening rounds consisting of three-way elimination matches to reduce the duration of the event while keeping the same number of competitors. Since 2007, it has also grown to include separate tournaments for female wrestlers and tag teams. ==Tournament winners== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Tournament !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Year !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Winner !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Total won !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Reference |- | || 2000 || Judas Young || 1 || |- | || 2001 || Low Ki || 1 || |- | || 2002 || Reckless Youth || 1 || |- | || 2003 || Jay Lethal || 1 || |- | || 2004 || Super Dragon || 1 || |- | || 2005 || Mike Kruel || 1 || |- | || 2006 || Grim Reefer || 1 || |- | || 2007 || Deranged || 1 || |- | || 2008 || Rhett Titus || 1 || |- | || 2009 || Myke Quest || 1 || |- | || 2010 || John Walters || 1 || |- | || 2011 || Nicky Oceans || 1 |- | || 2014 || Chris Dickinson || 1 |} ==2000== The 2000 JCW Jersey J-Cup was a two-block, 16-man tournament held on May 12, 2000, at Paramus High School in Paramus, New Jersey. Wrestlers from seven promotions, including Jersey Championship Wrestling, were represented at the inaugural tournament including the CyberSpace Wrestling Federation, East Coast Pro Wrestling, Jersey All Pro Wrestling, NWA New York, Outlaws of Wrestling and World Xtreme Wrestling. Judas Young won the tournament by winning four matches at the event. Over the course of the evening, he defeated Homicide in the opening round, Crazy Ivan in the quarter-finals, Low Ki in the semi-finals and Ryan Wing in the final match. Ryan Wing, hometown hero and favorite to win the tournament, made a surprise \"heel turn\" arrogantly criticizing the fans and brought out his \"mother\", Mrs. Wing, to be in his corner during his match against Judas Young. It was a failed attempt at outside interference, an ill-timed slap that accidentally hit her son, that allowed Young to pin Wing with a schoolboy rollup for the win. ===Results=== May 12, 2000 in Paramus, New Jersey (Paramus High School) {| style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: left;\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|# !style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Results !style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Stipulations !style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Times |- |- |1 |Crazy Ivan (JCW) defeated \"Sterling\" Rick Silver (NWA-NY) |rowspan=\"8\"| First Round Tournament match |n/a |- |2 |\"Smooth\" Tommy Suede (WXW) defeated Marc Reil (JAPW) |n/a |- |3 |Judas Young (JCW) defeated Homicide (JAPW) |n/a |- |4 |\"Sure Thing\" Ryan Wing (JCW) defeated Dave Delicious (CWF) |n/a |- |5 |Billy Reil (JCW) defeated \"Superstar\" Dave Grecco (JCW) |n/a |- |6 |Embassamador (ECPW) defeated Zero Gravity (WXW) |n/a |- |7 |Low Ki (JCW) defeated Grandmaster B (ECPW) |n/a |- |8 |Abunai (JCW) defeated White Lotus (OOW) |n/a |- |9 |Judas Young defeated Crazy Ivan |rowspan=\"4\"| Quarter Final Tournament Match |n/a |- |10 |Ryan Wing defeated Tommy Suede |n/a |- |11 |Low Ki defeated Billy Reil |n/a |- |12 |Abunai defeated Embassamador |n/a |- |13 |Judas Young defeated Low Ki |rowspan=\"2\"| Semi Final Tournament match |n/a |- |14 |Ryan Wing defeated Abunai |n/a |- |15 |Judas Young defeated Ryan Wing (with Mrs. Wing) |Tournament Finals match |n/a |} ===Tournament bracket=== Pin-Pinfall; Sub-Submission; CO-Countout; DCO-Double countout; DQ-Disqualification; Ref-Referee's decision ==2001== The 2001 JCW Jersey J-Cup was a two-block, 16-man tournament held on June 23, 2001, at the JCW Arena in Lodi, New Jersey.
