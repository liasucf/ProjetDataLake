Jackson School of International Studies), University of Washington Press, 2013/7/30, , p. 152. Although its official purpose was to give women a chance to serve the Empire of Japan prior to marriage, it was a means to compel women to perform labor duties. == Overview == The original meaning of the term Volunteer Corps is take the initiative to organize for the country. The term was used for the war support groups in many areas. A labor shortage continued throughout the war, and the Volunteer Corps organization was started, followed by the Women's Volunteer Corps organization consisting of female laborers. It is not clear when the Women's Volunteer Labour Corps started in Korea. Women's shipbuilding began with no legal basis. On August 23, 1944, the legal basis was carried out and the troops were officially launched. The Act was also applied to colonial Korea and Taiwan.\uad50\uacfc\uc11c\ud3ec\ub7fc, \u300a\ub300\uc548\uad50\uacfc\uc11c \ud55c\uad6d \uadfc\u00b7\ud604\ub300\uc0ac\u300b, \uae30\ud30c\ub791, 2008\ub144, p.92. Korean women without spouses aged from 12 to 40 belonged to the Troops, and they were designated to the munitions factories.

Some of them were introduced by Japanese teachers. The number of girls who worked in the factory is estimated at 400. It is testified that girls recruited from North Gyeongsang Province elsewhere were forced to work in logistics company, Fujikoshi Steel Industrial Co., Ltd. Toyama plant. They also did not receive proper wages. In 1943, Kim Kum-jin, who was a student of the (), heard the school president () deploring that \"[t]here are no students who support a labor volunteer corps. It is different from other schools\", and she applied to the Corps. Kim Kum-jin worked in Fujikoshi factory making bullets and returned home after the war. It is also pointed out that they worked in Tokyo Textile Corporation Numazu plant, Mitsubishi Nagoya Aircraft Works Doutoku factory, Nagasaki Shipyard, Sagami Navy Yard, and Yawata Steel Works. ==Difference from comfort women== Korean Women's Volunteer Labour Corps was mobilization of labor and was different from comfort women who were sexual exploited. The term \"Volunteer Corps\" was often used interchangeably with the term \"comfort women\" after the war.\u2018\uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84\uc740 \ub2ec\ub7ec\ub97c \ubc8c\uc5b4\uc8fc\ub294 \uc560\uad6d\uc790\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4\u2019 \uc99d\uc5b8 \ud1b5\ud574 \u201c\uae30\uc9c0\ucd0c\uc758 \uc228\uaca8\uc9c4 \uc9c4\uc2e4\u201d \uc18d\uc18d \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub098 2008/12/15 Because of this misunderstanding, some women who finished forced labor could not explain the fact that they worked as forced labor, because they were afraid to be confused with comfort women. ==References== * ==See also== *Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea *Mitsubishi *Nachi-Fujikoshi ==External links== * Confusion with 'volunteer corps': Insufficient research at that time led to comfort women and volunteer corps seen as the same at Asahi Shimbun Category:Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea Category:Korea under Japanese rule Category:Empire of Japan Category:Mitsubishi Category:Women's organizations based in Korea Category:Pacific theatre of World War II Category:Women in war Category:Organizations established in 1944 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1945 Category:1944 establishments in Korea Category:1945 disestablishments in Korea ",
