His most notable results was a third place in the 1953 12 Hours of Sebring, taking a class win, when he partnered Sherwood Johnston, in a Jaguar C-Type. The season before, he was seventh in the overall SCCA National Sports Car Championship standings, after winning Climb To The Clouds, at the Mount Equinox, and the Burke Mountain Hill Climb, setting hill climbing records in the process.http://www3.gendisasters.com/new- york/12205/bridgehampton-ny-aut-race-wreck-may-1953 Historically, Bob and Rowland Keith who were co-drivers on the 1950 Six Hours of Sebring endurance race, were shown as Canadians, as a result of driving a car from a Canadian dealer, despite Bob being the entrant. The pair finished 14th in their MG TC. ==Death== On 22 May 1953, the Chicago Tribune reported that Wilder was killed when his Allard J2X Le Mans went out of control during a practice session for the Bridgehampton Sports Car Races. The car struck a depression in the road after crossing a bridge at high speed and rolled over. He was strapped in with a safety belt. His head was crushed. ==Racing record== ===Career highlights=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- ! Season ! Series ! Position ! Team !
