    "text": "Cortinarius boreicyanites is a species of fungus in the large mushroom genus Cortinarius (subgenus Phlegmacium). Found in the boreal mixed forests of Europe (Sweden, Finland and Scotland), it was described as new to science in 2014. Its fruitbodies have hemispherical to convex caps measuring in diameter. Initially bluish gray, the cap colour matures to pale grayish brown. Gills on the cap underside have an emarginate attachment to the stipe. They start out greyish blue before changing to brownish violet when the spores mature. The club-shaped to bulbous stipe measures long, and up to wide at the base. The specific epithet boreicyanites refers to its close relationship to Cortinarius cyanites, and its boreal distribution. ==See also== *List of Cortinarius species ==References== ==External links== * boreicyanites Category:Fungi described in 2014 Category:Fungi of Europe ",
