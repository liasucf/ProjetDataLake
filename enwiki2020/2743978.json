The Belgian Antarctic Expedition, under Lt. Adrien de Gerlache, explored the strait in January and February 1898, naming it for the expedition ship Belgica. The name was later changed to honor the commander himself. ==Geology== Four tectonic blocks are identifiable in the Gerlache Strait area, bounded by two systems of Tertiary strike-slip faults. The longitudinal faults include the SW-NE trending Neumayer Fault that extends from Peltier Channel across Wiencke Island, and then onwards most likely as the Gerlache Fault. The SW-NE trending Fournier Fault parallels the Gerlache Fault and divides Anvers Island. The transverse faults trend E-W and SE-NW across Wiencke Island and Brabant Island, and include the Schollaert Channel faults. The Danco Coast Block extends from Cape Willems to Wilhelmina Bay. The Brabant Island Block encompasses the southern portion of that island. The Neumayer Channel Block is bound by the Neumayer Fault and the Fournier Fault. The Anvers-Melchior Islands Block includes northwest Anvers Island and its offshore islands Melchior Islands. ==Gallery== Image:Iceberg in the Gerlache, Antarctica.JPG|Iceberg in the Gerlache Image:Iceberg_in_the_Gerlache_Strait,_Antarctica_(6295918548).jpg|Iceberg Image:Gerlache_Strait_-_NOAA.jpg|Gerlache Strait Image:Humpback Whales in the Gerlache Strait, Antarctica (6295482849).jpg|Humpback whales in the strait Image:Killer Whale in the Gerlache Strait, Antarctica (6086430485).jpg|Killer whale swimming ==References== ==External links== Category:Straits of the Palmer Archipelago ",
