Its monopoly partially ended on that date under terms of which the government of Kenya began licensing other companies to compete in the field of internet telephony. Jambonet currently uses four VSAT satellites to carry the country's internet traffic. Jambonet is a subsidiary of Telkom Kenya. ==See also== *Kenya Internet Exchange == External links== *Jambonet page at Telkom Kenya *Telkom Kenya * Kenya ISP complaining about Jumbonet monopoly * A paper that extensively discusses problems facing Jumbonet *The Jambonet entry at the KIXP Category:Telecommunications companies of Kenya ",
