    "text": "View of Morro Dona Marta. Favela Santa Marta (, Saint Martha's favela) is a favela located in the Botafogo and Laranjeiras part of the Morro Dona Marta (, Dame Martha's Hill), that is also divided with the neighborhoods of Flamengo, Cosme Velho and Silvestre, in the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It has about 8000 residents, with 500 wooden houses, 2000 brick houses, 4 kindergartens, 3 bakeries, 2 sports fields, 1 block of a samba school, 3 military units and 1 small market. The favela is one of the steepest in the city. Recently, the favela has been undergoing a process of urbanization. Several popular houses were built with sewage, water piping and installation of electrical cables. One of the most important works done in recent years in Dona Marta was the construction of a cable car that facilitates the transport of residents to higher areas of the hill. Another major change in Dona Marta was the occupation of military force. On November 28, 2008 the control of Dona Marta was turned to civil police forces when Rio's first Pacifying Police Unit was established there. Between 2008 and 2015, the military operation was considered a success in combating trafficking and reducing local violence. However, the UPP project left the community without the consolidation of an independent local peace structure, and thus vilolence returned even more destructive. The vacuum of power added to the harmed military armament created a scenario of 2 shootings between gangs per week. Rio de Janeiro'S government decided to re-intervene in the community dynamics, but the pacification policing was replaced by confrontation policing, with emphasis on the use of the units of the Special Operations Shock battalions (BOPE). Trafficking settled in parts of the community defending themselves with pistols and rifles, similar to other areas in RJ. Entrepreneurs have left the community, and social projects are in decline. The change in the police brought problems to the residents, as they would repress cultural artistic movements, street events and even the local commerce and day-care centers to function normally. This is reflected in the visits of tourists to the hill. In the post- installation period of the UPP, there were 2,000 per month. Currently, they do not reach 200, according to tour guides. . Dona Marta was the setting for international events as part of the clip of \"They Don't Care About Us\" by Michael Jackson and appearances in Bike Downhill MTB of Redbull and the film Fast Five. == See also == * List of funicular railways ==References== Category:Favelas Category:Geography of Rio de Janeiro (city) ",
