In 535, Dalmatius attended the Council of Arvernum, which among its sixteen decrees, held that the granting of episcopal dignity must be according to the merits and not as a result of intrigues. In 541, he attended the Fourth Council of Orl\u00e9ans and on his return made a pilgrimage to the tomb of Martin of Tours.Jones, David Rice. \"Dalmatius (6)\", A Dictionary of Christian Biography, (William Smith, Henry Wace, eds.), London, John Murray, 1877, p. 782 Gregory of Tours reports that Dalmatius built a church, but tore it down so often for improvements, that it was left unfinished at his death. Dalmatius' testament requested from Childebert II that the bishop's successor not be a stranger to the see, or covetous, or married. His successor should be someone who spent all of his time praising God.Electronic Antiquities Volume III, Number 3 His feast day is November 13. ==Notes== Category:Frankish bishops Category:Bishops of Rodez Category:580 deaths Category:6th-century Frankish saints Category:Year of birth unknown ",
