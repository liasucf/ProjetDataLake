The parish of Sandleford is, as mentioned above, about 500 acres, most of which is an arcadian farm and woodland that lies to the west of the priory/school. This almost square block is bounded by the River Enborne to the south; on the west by a hedge line that runs two furlongs to the east of the Andover Road (A343) which runs north-south through Wash Common; Monks (Monkey) Lane and therefore Newbury to the north (though the parish boundary runs a bit south of the road); and the Newtown road, A339 (previously A34) to the east (though clearly parish boundary and the priory/school is to the east of that). Almost the only way into this park is from the west, from the A343, Andover road, past the Roman Catholic church at Warren Lodge, and down the remaining 200 yards of an ancient track flanked by field maple, oak, ash, hazel, ivy, elm, elder, hawthorn, and blackthorn.Hoopers rule, see Hedge#Hedgerow dating Around here the cavalry of Prince Rupert of the Rhine lined up before the First Battle of Newbury in September 1643, and near here are the meadows which feature in the beginning of Richard Adams' semi-factual novel Watership Down. At this point the enclosed track ends at the Newbury (Wash Common)/Sandleford parish boundary, but the public footpath or former carriage track continues. In previous centuries, in Mrs. Montagu's day, this was the main route to the priory from the west, from places like Bath, Somerset.Mrs. Montagu's letters (Climenson) and those associated with her nephew (viz. William Wilberforce) record many visitors passing via Sandleford on their way to or from Bath. Here the view quickly opens out, expansively, perspective tricks have been played with hedge and wood edge lines which add to the sense of infinity and space. 1911 Ordnance Survey map of Sandleford, Berkshire, UK.jpg|1911 Ordnance Survey map of Sandleford.

Barn copse is passed on the left or north. A hedge line connects Barn Copse to Dirty Ground Copse, and another hedge line from that forms an arrow with the northern edge of Gorse Covert. Comparison of the 1761 John Rocque map with how things now appear suggests a degree of highly clever tweeking of wood and hedge lines to maximise the effect of the landscape took place in the late eighteenth century.A Topographical Map of the County of Berks, by John Rocque, Topographer to His Majesty, 1761. In the far distance on the right, to the south, there is Sidown Hill with its brick folly Heaven's Gate, built in 1749 for Hon. Robert Sawyer Herbert (1693\u20131769), MP (for Wilton 1722\u20131768), of Highclere, second son of Thomas Herbert, 8th Earl of Pembroke, visible at about 60 feet high, and next to that Beacon Hill. As the track passes through the bottle-neck formed by this hedge and the north-east end of Gorse Covert the viewer then goes through to the next instalment, a first distant prospect of Sandleford Priory itself, and the North Downs, including Watership Down. The track continues due east passing High Wood and a distant view of Slockett's Copse and Crook's Copse beyond to the left or north. Eventually the track reaches the A339 and the main entrance to the priory/school. Through the heart of this block of 500 acres a small stream runs north south from the top of Crook's Copse, down between High Wood and Slockett's Copse and then having been joined by another smaller stream runs east parallel with the southern edge of High Wood and then turns south again towards the River Enborne. In 1749 Elizabeth Montagu wrote to her husband from Tunbridge Wells: My Dearest, ... I flatter myself the Captain will think Berkshire not inferior to Surry [sic], especially if he bestrides his Arabian steed, and surveys the prospects from Newbury Wash, Greenham &c.; When he is tired of mere cows and sheep, and would behold some of those fair creatures, Father Philip's geese,The Hermit, or Father Philip's Geese, the title of a poem by Jean de La Fontaine published in The Gentleman's Magazine, October 1733, page 544....The Letters of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, published by Matthew Montagu, Esq., her nephew & executor, volume III, page 121, London, 1813. Mrs. Montagu's views on landscape, indicating that parks and gardens should be under the care of the cherub Contemplation, are somewhat revealed in a letter to Gilbert West, dated 1753, 25th: 'I suppose you have been at Stowe, where art has exhausted all her powers,which West's uncle, Viscount Cobham, had masterminded' Equel, che il bello, o il caro accresce all' opre L'arte, che tutto fa, nulla si ScopreQuoted from Torquato Tasso describing the gardens of Armida 'Such, I am told, is its present state; when I saw the gardens they brought not so much to one's imagination the scenes of paradise, as of that garden, where the sapient king with his fair spouse held dalliance;Milton's Paradise Lost. it is rather a retreat for the proud and victorious, than the philosophic mind; like the poets, it was an Elysian only for heroes; ambition found examples there, and restless emulation fair incitements, but no quiet scenes hushed the passions into peace, and excluded the visions of this world's vanities; which, I take to be the great benefit of the retreat which should put the mind into the guardian care of the cherub Contemplation.'the cherub Contemplation', comes from John Milton's Il Penseroso.' In September 1757 Mrs Montagu wrote to Dr. Messenger Monsey (1693\u20131788), FRS, ... I assure you we have Groves too at Sandleford, where you may meet your Amante Sposa, Dame Melancholy, as often as you please....Sandleford, 8 September 1757 ===Job creation scheme=== Haytley's painting, with Sandleford haymakers, circa 1744. In July 1782 Mrs Montagu mentioned the high unemployment then found in Newbury and the works going on at Sandleford: The scene is extremely animated; 20 men at work in the wood and grove, and the fields around are full of haymakers. The persons employed on the work are poor weavers who by the decay of our manufacture at Newbury are void of employment, and not having been trained to the business of agriculture are not dexterous at the rake and pitchfork, but the plain digging and driving wheel barrows they can perform and are very glad to get their daily subsistence.Quoted in The Omnipotent Magician, by Jane Brown, Pimlico, London, 2012, p297. ===Tourist attraction=== In a letter dated Deal, 21 July 1786, Elizabeth Carter wrote to her friend Elizabeth Montagu: 'Your letter, my dear friend, ... The trouble which you receive from the curiosity of people to see your improvements at Sandleford, is one of the natural embarras des richesses. Nobody plagues me by besieging my doors in carriages, and upon pillions to see my cottage. After all, however, it is very strange how people can be so impertinent, one would think they might at least suspend their impatient curiosity till you were absent'.Letters of Elizabeth Carter to Elizabeth Montagu, Letter CCLIX, page 261, volume 3, London, 1817. A year later Elizabeth Carter, in a letter, dated Deal, 22 June 1787, pointed to the music of the groves: ' ... By this time, my dear friend, I hope you are enjoying the music of your groves at Sandleford... '.Letters of Elizabeth Carter to Elizabeth Montagu, Letter CCLXII, volume 3, London, 1817. ==Past descriptions of the house and estate== ===Elizabeth Montagu 1743=== In 1743 Mrs Montagu wrote from Sandleford to her old friend the Duchess of Portland and described her new retreat: '...I had a very pleasant journey to this place, where I am delighted to find everything that is capable of making retreat agreeable; the garden commands a fine prospect, the most cheerful I ever saw, and not of shirt distance which is only to gratify the pride of seeing, but such as falls within the humble reach of my eyes. We have a pretty village [ Newtown ] on a rising ground just before us.' Where the cottage chimney smokes, Fast between two oaks.From John Milton's 'L'allegro', 'Hard by, a cottage chimney smokes, From betwixt two aged oaks,' 'Poverty here is clad in its decent garb of low simplicity, but her tattered robes of misery do not here show want and wretchedness; you would rather imagine pomp was neglected than sufficiency wanted.' 'A silver stream [the Alder stream, aka river Enborne] washes the foot of the village; health, pleasure, and refreshment are the ingredients that qualify this spring; no debauch, or intoxication, arises from its source.' 'Nature has been very indulgent to this country, and has given it enough of wood and water; the first we have here in good plenty, and a power of having more of the latter, as improvements are undertaken.' 'Here are temptations to riding and walking. I go out every evening to take a view of the country; the villages are the neatest I ever saw; every cottage is tight; has a little garden, and is sheltered by fine trees...' The Letters of Mrs. Elizabeth Montagu, edited by her nephew Matthew Montagu, MP, London, 1809. ===Survey 1781=== A survey of the 619 acre, 2 roods and 17 perches estate made for Mrs Montagu in 1781, by John Spyers (c1720-1798) on behalf of Lancelot Brown, and used when the lease of 503 acres and 111 acres was sold to William Chatteris on 3 November 1835, shows that in 1835 111 acres were owned outright by the Lord Rokeby on the east side (mostly in the parish of Greenham), that 87 acres on the east side belonged to the Dean and Canons of Windsor (held by Lord Rokeby), and that 416 acres on the west side of the road (also leased from the Dean and Canons of Windsor by Lord Rokeby), with 5 acres belonging to Mrs Colman near the mill.Berkshire Record Office (BRO:D/ELM T19/2/13) One question regarding this 1781 survey is whether it was a depiction of what work was to be done, as conceived by Lancelot Brown, or more likely exactly how the estate was at the time? Meanwhile, the 1871 map shows the landscape as it might have been embellished by Brown, especially regarding the ponds near Broadmoor and Waterleaze woods. It is also possible that this 1871 map was based on a lost map made by Brown as a result of works undertaken after that 1781 survey. In November 1762 replying to a letter from her husband Mrs Montagu wrote:Huntingdon, MO2464You are very good in consulting me about the Trees..., which suggests that landscape works had been going on post the Rocque map of 1761 and preceding Capability Brown's involvement post 1781, more in a style as seen at Studley Royal/Fountains Abbey or as painted by people like Jacob van Ruisdael, Antonie Waterloo (1609\u20131690), or Thomas Gainsborough (1727\u20131788). 87 acres of coppices on the west side (acres, roods, perches) *Waterleaze and Broadmoor coppice: 41 2 09 *High Wood coppice: 18 3 10 *Upper Moor coppice: 2 01 10 (now Gorse covert) *Lower Moor coppice: 3 1 01 (now Gorse covert) *Dirty Ground: 5 0 17 *Orchard House coppice: 5 2 10 (now Slockett's copse) *Wilsons coppice: 4 0 06 (now Barn copse) *Parting Ground coppice: 5 2 16 (now Crook's copse) *Furze close border: 0 2 16 (near Orchard House coppice) *Hassocks above Halls mead: 0 2 12 (linear or ghost wood east of Parting Ground coppice). 60 acres of meadowland on the west side (acres, roods, perches) *Upper mill mead; *Lower mill mead; *Mill mead; *Grabbed piddle; *Pound meadow; *Over way cow leaze; *Upper peat mead; *Upper eight acres; *Four acres; *Ireland; *Halls mead. 227 and 40 acres of arable on the west side (acres, roods, perches) *Great Water leaze 12 2 19; *The Pond 0 3 24; *Middle Leaze 14 1 15; *Upper Moor 13 1 21; *Lower Moor 11 1 30; *Fulwars 16 0 33; *Picked Harts 10 3 24; *Round Harts 20 2 14; *High wood close 16 1 0; *Fatting Leaze 19 3 03; *Adams ground 20 1 6; *Parting ground 15 0 22; *High Field 23 2 28; *Gravel close 3 1 13; *Furz ground 28 3 15; and *Newberry [sic] grounds, (aka Tydehams, alias Tidlaws), comprised three fields on the brow of the slope north of Monks' Lane, looking north down towards Newbury, that totalled 40 2 00. (These 40 acres were developed into Newbury's smartest cul- de-sac from March 1923 when Dr. George Alan Simmons (died 1951) bought 42 acres from Christopher Saunders, who had acquired them in 1911 from the trustees of the estate of Alpin Macgregor, late owner of the Sandleford Priory Estate. There were 10 houses by 1928; 12 by 1931; 25 by 1941; 28 in 1963; 30 by 1982; and 39 in 2010. Major-general Llewelyn Alberic Emilius Price-Davies, VC, CB, CMG, DSO, lived briefly, 1926\u20131929, at the house variously known as Badsworth, Mary Leen and Lustleigh).At the time of the Newbury tithe award the forty acres were leased by the Dean and Canons of Windsor to Henry Churchyard, and in 1777 it was occupied by Henry Grace (info: R.B. Tubb).Newbury Road by Road, by R. B. Tubb, Thatcham, 2011. The 16 acres field known as Fulwars was no doubt named after Fulwar Craven, 4th Baron Craven (1704\u20131764), of nearby Benham Park and Hampstead Marshall, High Steward of Newbury 1739\u20131764,Walter Money, FSA, Newbury, 1887, page 555. and a founder of the Craven hunt.Fulwar Craven was ward and nephew of Sir Fulwar Skipwith, 2nd Bt., (1676\u20131728), MP (Coventry). The 1781 survey map also shows the Montagu purchases of coppices (such as Little Peckmore and Collin's coppices) and water-meadows at Peckmore and on the north side of the Auborn stream (alias river Enborne), and its layout before its severe disturbance by the new west-east running A339; re- routed along the river Enborne as a result of two of the old roads to Newbury that formerly crossed Greenham Common south-north being severed when the airport was made circa 1942. The map also shows a Rick yard; farm yard, with a very large barn;size as shown also by a photograph of circa 1906 the Green yard in front of the priory; a Wilderness walk; and a Bowling green. The map shows the stream that flows south into the river Enborne (aka Auborne stream) which also marked the border of the parishes of Greenham and Sandleford and was to provide the water that formed what is known as Brown's (extant), Woodhouse (derelict),Named after Mrs Montagu's butler Joseph Woodhouse or his poetical shoemaker brother James Woodhouse (c1735-1820), who worked as the land steward and bailiff at Sandleford from the mid-1760s onwards. and Newtown ponds (seems to have disappeared). Collin's coppice ran just east of the priory's demesne, near where the first ponds were formed. Collin's coppice still exists at the south-western corner of Greenham Common, as does Peckmoor, an arable field now a grazed part of Bunker farm. ===Mary Morgan 1791=== Photograph of Wyatt's alteration to the chapel at Sandleford Priory, 1906, by Evelyn Elizabeth Myers (c. 1872\u20131909).

Mary Morgan's husband was rector of Wisbech a mere 15 miles north of Coveney, near Ely. one of the two daughters of the Ipswich composer Joseph Gibbs (died 1788), and wife to Rev. Caesar Morgan, DD, (died 1812, aged 62), vicar of Wisbech and then Rector of St James' Church, Stretham, Cambridgeshire and (from 1804) a Prebendary of Ely,The Gentleman's Magazine, November 1818, page 473. in her A Tour to Milford Haven, in the year 1791 published in 1795, wrote (Letter V, To Miss B _ _ _ _ , Burfield [ Burghfield ], 13 July 1791):She was staying with Mrs Montagu's brother Rev. William Robinson (died 1803) who was rector of Burghfield. Robinson's son was then rector of Coveney, near Ely; a friend and neighbour of Mrs Morgan. ...I felt myself sufficiently gratified, that a great portion of genius is possessed by my sex; I was entirely devoid of dread or envy. After driving twenty miles through a very pleasant country, and through the pretty town of Newbury, we entered Mrs. Montagu's park, which seemed to have undergone some recent improvements, as the trees were many of them newly planted. The approach to the house is a fine lawn, with sheep feeding upon it. This gives you the idea of beauty blended with utility, which always produces agreeable sensations in the mind...page 33 ...In this wing is an elegant dressing-room above stairs. This too has a large bow, on the outside of which there is a very spacious balcony, surrounded by iron balustrades. The balcony commands a distant view of the Hampshire hills, and an extensive diversified country. The small village of Newton in the Valley has an humble simplicity in it, that is agreeably contrasted with the lofty hills beyond it... ...When we withdrew to go to bed, we were ushered up stairs by the major domo, with a wax light in each hand. I found the bedroom lighted up, and a female waiting in it ready to undress me. Mrs M.-- was not conducted into my room, but into a dressing-room adjoining, by a door that opened into a passage. Reflecting on this, to me unusual ceremony, I almost began to fancy myself a bride again; or else, that I was transported into some fairy region, where I was to be waited upon by spirits, that were every where attending without being called for... ...In the dressing-room there was a collection of books; amongst them I found your friend Miss Cornelia Knight's Dinarbas. Here you may amuse yourself in the morning, if you please, till dinner calls you again to society. The grounds are laid out with the same Attic taste, as the house. Through a great part of them Mrs. Montagu has trained a river, which was little more than a ditch; and means to extend it still further... she has likewise cut a winding path through her plantations. It is a carriage way and is a mile in length. It is also a very pleasant walk, and may serve; 'or for study, or for love' being perfectly secluded. At agreeable distances are benches under the shadow of a large tree, or the shelter of a close hedge interwoven with woodbines and honeysuckles.Mary Morgan, 1795, page 33. When walking in the grounds, I observed an extraordinary degree of cleanliness and decency in the men, who were at work in them. Upon enquiry I found they were all fed and cloathed by her hand. I perceived too that many of them had some great defect, occasioned by age, natural infirmity, or misfortune, being either blind, deaf, dumb, or lame; yet she so paired them, and fitted their employments to their several faculties, that the remaining senses of one served to supply the deficiencies of the other. By this stroke of benevolent ingenuity, though she does not get so much work done, as she would by stronger and abler men; she has the heart- felt satisfaction of making those useful and happy members of society, whom nobody else would employ, and who, but for her, must be dependent upon a parish for an idle and scanty substance. I hope it is not prophane to say, she has made the blind to see, the deaf to hear, the dumb to speak, and the lame to walk.Morgan, 1795, page 39 The whole of this place suggested to me the idea of a Roman villa. There is every thing for use as well as beauty. The farm and dairy are not omitted; they supply the family and table with all things necessary and delicate. In short, there is a style in every part of it, that bespeaks a superior degree of judgment. Nothing is gaudy or superfluous, yet nothing is wanting. Native genius, matured by observation upon what is simply elegant, has guided the hand of the amiable possessor of this enchanting place...

A few days later she continued: (To Miss B., Letter IX, Woodstock, 16 July 1791): Having before described Sandleford to you, I cannot help observing, that it is a striking contrast to Blenheim. But it is such a one, as when the eye, dazzled with gazing at the sun, falls on the soft green of a beautiful lawn, upon which it may rest for ever without satiety or weariness. At Sandleford the mind is gratified with everything that can render life rational and happy. At Blenheim it is fatigued with contemplating objects, that seem like a golden dream, too gay and too gaudy to be real.Mary Morgan, 1795, page 76. Morgan's list of subscribers shows that Elizabeth Montagu, aka Montagu, Mrs. Portman Square-10 copies., and her nephew (the son of Rev. William Robinson, rector of Burghfield), aka Robinson, Rev. Mr. Rector of Coveney, in the Isle of Ely-6 copies., evidently appreciated this ebullient description. ===William Cobbett 1821=== The Radical MP and journalist William Cobbett (1762\u20131835) wrote about Sandleford in his journal whilst staying with the farmer Mr. Budd at Burghclere, on 30 October 1821.William Cobbett, Rural Rides, London, 1853. Appropriately 150 years later Budd's Farm was home to the writer Roger Mortimer. This is the gist of it: :'...Came through a place called \"a park\" belonging to a Mr. Montague, who is now abroad ; :Of all the ridiculous things I ever saw in my life this place is the most ridiculous. The house looks like a sort of church, in somewhat of a gothic style of building, with crosses on the tops of different parts of the pile. There is a sort of swamp, at the foot of a wood, at no great distance from the front of the house'. :'...Here is a fountain, the basin of which is not four feet over, and the water spout not exceeding the pour from a tea-pot. Here is a bridge over a river of which a child four years old would clear the banks at a jump...' :'...In short, such fooleries I never before beheld; but what I disliked most was the apparent impiety of a part of these works of refined taste'. :'...I wonder how long this sickly, this childish, taste is to remain?' :'..At the end of this scene of mock grandeur and mock antiquity I found something more rational; namely, some hare hounds, and, in half-an-hour after, we found, and I had the first hare-hunt that I had had since I wore a smock-frock !' 'Came through a place called \"a park\" belonging to a Mr. Montague, who is now abroad ; for the purpose, I suppose, of generously assisting to compensate the French people for what they lost by the entrance of the Holy Alliance Armies into their country. Of all the ridiculous things I ever saw in my life this place is the most ridiculous. The house looks like a sort of church, in somewhat of a gothic style of building, with crosses on the tops of different parts of the pile. There is a sort of swamp, at the foot of a wood, at no great distance from the front of the house. This swamp has been dug out in the middle to show the water to the eye; so that there is a sort of river, or chain of diminutive lakes, going down a little valley, about 500 yards long, the water proceeding from the soak of the higher ground on both sides. By the sides of these lakes there are little flower gardens, laid out in the Dutch manner; that is to say, cut out into all manner of superficial geometrical figures. Here is the grand en petit, or mock magnificence, more complete than I ever beheld it before. Here is a fountain, the basin of which is not four feet over, and the water spout not exceeding the pour from a tea-pot. Here is a bridge over a river of which a child four years old would clear the banks at a jump. I could not have trusted myself on the bridge for fear of the consequences to Mr. Montague; but I very conveniently stepped over the river, in imitation of the Colossus. In another part there was a lion's mouth spouting out water into the lake, which was so much like the vomiting of a dog, that I could almost have pitied the poor Lion. In short, such fooleries I never before beheld; but what I disliked most was the apparent impiety of a part of these works of refined taste. I did not like the crosses on the dwelling house; but, in one of the gravel walks, we had to pass under a gothic arch, with a cross on the top of it, and in the point of the arch a niche for a saint or a virgin, the figure being gone through the lapse of centuries, and the pedestal only remaining as we so frequently see on the out-sides of Cathedrals and of old churches and chapels. But the good of it was, this gothic arch, disfigured by the hand of old Father Time, was composed of Scotch fir wood, as rotten as a pear; nailed together in such a way as to make the thing appear, from a distance, like the remnant of a ruin ! I wonder how long this sickly, this childish, taste is to remain? I do not know who this gentleman is. I suppose he is some honest person from the 'Change or its neighbourhood; and that these gothic arches are to denote the antiquity of his origin! Not a bad plan; and, indeed, it is one that I once took the liberty to recommend to those Fundlords who retire to be country-'squires. But I never recommended the Crucifixes ! To be sure the Roman Catholic religion may, in England, be considered as a gentleman's religion, it being the most ancient in the country; and, there-fore, it is fortunate for a Fundlord when he happens (if he ever do happen) to be of that faith. This gentleman may, for anything that I know, be a Catholic ; in which case I applaud his piety and pity his taste. At the end of this scene of mock grandeur and mock antiquity I found something more rational; namely, some hare hounds, and, in half-an-hour after, we found, and I had the first hare-hunt that I had had since I wore a smock-frock ! We killed our hare after good sport, and got to Burghclere in the evening to a nice farm-house in a dell, sheltered from every wind, and with plenty of good living; though with no gothic arches made of Scotch-fir'. ==Bibliography== *Stephen Bending, Green Retreats, women, gardens and eighteenth-century culture, Cambridge University Press, 2013. *Evelyn Elizabeth Myers (c.1872\u20131909), A History of Sandleford Priory, Newbury District Field Club, Special Publication. no. 1.
