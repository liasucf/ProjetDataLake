    "text": "Amandine du 38, or Miss Amanda, is a French amateur singer, whose rap videos went viral in January 2009. She then decided to stop uploading videos and quit studying because of the heavy harassment, but changed mind in March 2010 and tried to release a crowdfunded album under the name Miss Sing. == The buzz == In December 2008, Amandine du 38, 18 years old, uploads a rap video online called \u00c9cole au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal (school in Senegal), dealing with the poverty in Senegal. Using the artist name Miss Amanda, she wants to show what she is able to do and get tips to improve. However, her amateurish rap, slaughtering the French language, is noticed by the radio show le 6/9 from NRJ and goes viral in January 2009, under the name \"Amandine du 38\" that she never chose. She then becomes victim of harassment (teasing, insults, death threats, suicide rumors) whether at school, on the Internet or at her home. Many videos are published online to clash her, urged by French radio stations such as NRJ, Ado FM or the regional radio RMG 38. Although her school and her parents advises her to stop sharing videos, especially since her sister and brother are also being harassed at school, she keeps on uploading new songs as well as clash videos to answer her harassers. A few months later, as she's fed up of being asked to rap between classes, she finally gives up making videos for a few months and drops out of school. in 2014 she has also collaborated with SILLAZ on the single swag attitude, sillaz helped her to become less ridiculous and tried to bring back her career where she left it in 2010 == Attempt to release an album == In March 2010, Amandine du 38 comes back with new songs under the name Miss Sing. She tries to release an album in the crowdfunding record label MyMajorCompany, but fails to reach the required amount. She is still being harassed online, as many of her online accounts are hacked, but states that she doesn't really know if she regrets publishing her first video and wants to buzz again to be happy. She resumes her studies in October 2014. == Posterity == Amandine du 38 is still mentioned in 2020 as an example of ridiculous rap and quick virtual notoriety despite lacking any musical talent. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Viral videos Category:Victims of cyberbullying Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:French singers ",
