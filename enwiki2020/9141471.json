    "text": "Wolfreton School & Sixth Form College is a large state secondary school in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. It is situated to the west of Kingston upon Hull city centre, located on Well Lane, Willerby. In 2012, 88% of pupils gained 5 A-C GCSEs, similar to Cottingham High School. During Ofsted's school inspection on 23 October 2013, Wolfreton School received \"Good\" (Grade 2) ratings in all inspect sections, which has improved from the \"Requires Improvement\" rating in the previous inspection.\"Ofsted Inspection Report | Wolfreton School\" Ofsted. Retrieved 19 November 2013. ==East Riding Consortium== Wolfreton has for over 17 years been a part of the East Riding Sixth Form Consortium along with Hessle High School and Cottingham High School, providing A Level studies. South Hunsley School was also part of the Consortium until their withdrawal in 2008. ==Rushanje School== Wolfreton staff travel over to help develop Rushanje School in Mbarara, Uganda, and form The Wolfreton Rushanje Community Partnership.\"The Wolfreton Rushanje Community Partnership\", Wolfreton.co.uk (web archive). Retrieved 25 October 2013 A new Science and Humanities block built at Wolfreton's Upper School site was named 'Rushanje House' in honour of the relationship. As a reciprocal gesture, a new accommodation block at Rushanje School, funded partly with money raised at Wolfreton, was named 'Wolfreton House'. ==New School== The school was split over two sites, the Lower School in Willerby and the Upper School in Kirk Ella. In 2014, it was announced that Wolfreton was going to demolish both sites and build a new multi-million pound site on the playing field of the Lower School. The new school opened in September 2016. Both sites closed and since then, both schools were demolished. ==Wolfreton School Senate== Wolfreton School Senate is a school democratic institution, a partially elected body (around 80% - most Sixth Formers are appointed), comprising representatives from all year groups on a proportional basis. It is sometimes consulted by the school's Head Teacher and by its heads of faculties, and regularly plays a role in discussing and deciding on important issues, such as charity events and school policies. ==Notable alumni== * Caroline Bilton -- BBC Look North presenter and reporter * Robert Crampton -- Journalist for The Times * Scarlet -- Pop duo known for \"Independent Love Song\" which reached #12 in the UK charts in February 1995 * Tracey Seaward -- Award-winning film producer known for 'The Queen' and 'The Two Popes' * Annabelle Lewis -- Sprinter, won bronze for Great Britain in Women's 4x100 relay at the 2013 World Championships *Abbie Eaton -- Racing driver working on The Grand Tour *Chris Green -- Professional rugby player * Garreth Roberts -- Hull City footballer and captain, one of the club's longest serving players, 1978\u20131992 ==References== ==External links== * Wolfreton School Category:Secondary schools in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Community schools in the East Riding of Yorkshire ",
