His features on hip hop websites such as HotNewHipHop and Complex would serve as a precursor for TyY before releasing his debut mixtape, \"BEST KEPT SECRET\" in April 2016. After the release of the 19-track mixtape, TyY went on to release four more singles.- His most popular song was titled \"Trump\", a track aimed at the would-be President of the United States would draw ire from Trump supporters and praise from the President's detractors.

The goggles were inspired by Bike Life's signature look of wearing them while riding his ATV through the streets of New York City. In the Summer of 2017, TyY would launch multiple collections with a variety of brands. Most notably, during Paris Fashion Week, TyY partnered with Milan-based designer, Guntas. The line was a marquee feature of Guntas' Spring 2018 collection. ===Bike Life=== TyY is known for popularizing and leading the subculture of Bike Life, a Harlem counter-culture known for their love of ATV's, Dirt Bikes, and riding them on the streets of New York. The NYPD has expressed disapproval, as the vehicles are not street legal. The group still continues to ride to this day. ==Discography== === Mixtapes === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! style=\"width:16em;\"| Title ! style=\"width:22em;\"| Album details |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" style=\"background: transparent;\"| \"BEST KEPT SECRET\" | * Released: April 16, 2016 * Label: Self-released * Formats: digital download |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" style=\"background: transparent;\"| \"TROUBLES OF THE WORLD\" | * Released: April 19, 2018 * Label: Self-released * Formats: digital download |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" style=\"background: transparent;\"| \"PROJECT ROCKSTAR\" | * Released: March 1, 2019 * Label: Self-released * Formats: digital download |} === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! style=\"width:16em;\"| Title ! style=\"width:22em;\"| Date Released ! style=\"width:22em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text- align:center;\" style=\"background: transparent;\"| \"Chamber Lock\" feat.
