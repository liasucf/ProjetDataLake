    "text": "The Mayor of the West Midlands is a directly elected political post responsible for the metropolitan county of the West Midlands in the United Kingdom. The mayor chairs the West Midlands Combined Authority, which covers the Birmingham metropolitan area and Coventry. The first election took place on Thursday 4 May 2017. Andy Street, the inaugural Mayor, was originally due to hold office for three years, with the second election for the post taking place in May 2020. This election was delayed for a year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, so Street's first term was extended by a year, with the second term length being reduced to three years between 2021 and 2024. The Mayor's term of office will return to four years from 2024 thereafter. ==Powers and functions== ===Homes and Land=== The Mayor has devolved compulsory purchase powers, and is responsible for the West Midlands spatial framework and land commission. ===Transport=== The Mayor is responsible for franchised bus services, allowing for standardised fares and branding on all bus services in the county, similar to how London's bus network operates.
