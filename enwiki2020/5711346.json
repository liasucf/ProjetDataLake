    "text": "\"Saturday Gigs\" is a 7\" single released by Mott the Hoople. It was the last studio recording made by the group before Ian Hunter left and the group reformed as simply \"Mott\". Guitarist Ariel Bender was replaced by Mick Ronson during the production of the single, marking Ronson's only official appearance on a Mott the Hoople release. Ronson's image was used in the middle of the band's line-up on the single's cover sleeve. Another track, \"Lounge Lizard\", was recorded as a planned B-side, but was not used. The single peaked at No. 41 in the UK Singles Chart. The Mott the Hoople recording eventually turned up on the extended CD re-issue of The Hoople in 2006. This song was played live during the 1974 European tour as the set's ending but also at the Mott the Hoople Reunion concerts in 2009 with it being the closing song of the final concert. ==References== Category:Mott the Hoople songs Category:1974 singles Category:Songs written by Ian Hunter (singer) Category:1974 songs Category:Columbia Records singles ",
