It was first located at Freedom Park, Lagos Island, and is now at Dolphin Estate in Ikoyi, Lagos. VeggieVictory serves strictly Vegan Nigerian and Vegan International cuisine: including fresh, hot, spicy local and West African delicacies. VeggieVictory uses meat substitutes like VegChunks (seitan), tofu and mushrooms for their Veggie burgers, soy dogs, egusi and eforiro stews. ==LagosVegFest== The LagosVegFest is the first ever Vegan festival in Nigeria. The inaugural festival happened at the Freedom Park in Lagos Island in October (10th to 12th) 2014 and was part of the World Veg Fest 2014 in Accra (Ghana) by the International Vegetarian Union. The idea is to bring together people who dedicated their lives to a healthy, delicious and sustainable living. Around thirty booths were available for exhibitors to showcase their products and services. Since then LagosVegFest had three more editions. The next LagosVegFest is planned for November 2019. ==See also== *List of vegetarian restaurants *List of restaurants in Lagos ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Restaurants in Lagos Category:Vegetarian restaurants in Nigeria Category:Restaurants established in 2013 Category:2013 establishments in Nigeria ",
