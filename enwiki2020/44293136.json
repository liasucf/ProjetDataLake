Population: ==History== There were 360 Jews living in the city before World War II, 11% of the total population. The city was under German occupation from 1941 to 1944. Shortly after the start of the occupation, a group of Jewish men of Hnivan was shot in a military field. The rest of the Jews living in Hnivan were registered and forced to perform various kinds of hard labor. In the summer of 1942, about 90 Jews were murdered together with the Jews from neighbor villages in the same place. Today, the place of the shooting is on the grounds of a military base.http://yahadmap.org/#village/gnivan-vinnytsia-ukraine.73 ==Gallery== File:\u0412\u043e\u043a\u0437\u0430\u043b \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0456\u0457 \u0413\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0430\u043d\u044c.jpg|Railway station File:\u0417\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442 \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u041f\u0456\u0432\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u0443\u0433 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0443 \u0413\u043d\u0456\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0456.jpg|Rail bridge in Hnivan ==References== ==External links== * The murder of the Jews of Hnivan during World War II, at Yad Vashem website.
