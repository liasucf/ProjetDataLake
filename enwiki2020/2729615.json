    "text": "Netherworld\" featuring Tapanim\u00e4ki Jukka Tapanim\u00e4ki (11 August 1961 \u2013 1 May 2000) was a Finnish game programmer. Tapanim\u00e4ki wrote his games for the Commodore 64 computer, and many have been ported to other computer systems. Tapanim\u00e4ki was a reviewer for MikroBitti and \"C\" computer magazines; and a freelance writer of advanced-level computer programming articles. He also published a book called C-64 Pelintekij\u00e4n Opas (or \"C-64 Game Maker's Guide\") in 1990. ==Career choice== Tapanim\u00e4ki was originally interested in a career as a graphic designer for advertisements. After failing the entrance exams to the University of Art and Design Helsinki twice, he instead started studying literature in 1984. In summer 1985, he purchased a Commodore 64 computer. Although he had no previous experience with computers, Tapanim\u00e4ki decided to become a game programmer after a few months. He quit his studies and went on welfare to be able to concentrate on programming. Tapanim\u00e4ki spent 1986 experimenting. One of his finished programs was named Aikaetsiv\u00e4, a Finnish language text adventure in the style of Infocom, which the Tamperean retailer Triosoft bought publishing rights to but did not release. The first successfully operating game written by Tapanim\u00e4ki was Monolith, announced in the June-July 1986 issue of MikroBITTI. It was followed by Minidium, a Uridium-style shoot 'em up published in the January 1987 issue of C Magazine. The development of Minidium was extensively covered in the magazine.Tapanim\u00e4ki, Jukka: Minidium, overview, development details and full program listing. C-lehti 1/1987, pp. 52-56. Available online at . Early personal computer enthusiasts followed the development of Tapanim\u00e4ki's career through his magazine articles. ==Commercial game successes== Tapanim\u00e4ki's first commercial game was Octapolis (1987, published by English Software). Octapolis is a mix of the platform and shoot-'em-up genres. Tapanim\u00e4ki had created Octapolis completely by himself, except for the music. ===Netherworld=== The next year (1988) Tapanim\u00e4ki had his game Netherworld published. The working title of the game was Abyss Zone. In it, the player has to pilot a spaceship through a series of caves while collecting diamonds. The game was published by Hewson, which used Tapanim\u00e4ki's face as cover art (without first asking for his permission). The game's music was composed by Jori Olkkonen. ===Zamzara=== A screenshot of Zamzara That same year, Hewson published Zamzara on floppy disk for the Commodore 64. Zamzara is a single- player platform game where the player takes the role of an alien, whose mission is to escape a laboratory complex before a time bomb explodes. The bomb has a time limit of 15 minutes. Various enemies, both stationary and mobile, hinder the player's progress, requiring the player to shoot them in order to advance. The player character is armed with a gun and various additional weapons, which have a finite supply of ammunition. Many action game fans found Zamzara satisfying due to its various graphics styles. Some, however, complained about excessive difficulty. The music by Charles Deenen was generally praised. ===Moonfall=== In 1991, another game, Moonfall (inspired by Elite and Mercenary), using wireframe 3D graphics, was published. In the game the player steered a spaceship from the pilot's viewpoint. Because of agreements made with Hewson, the game could only be published two years after its completion, and was a commercial failure. The publisher was 21st Century Entertainment (Hewson's new name). ==Death== Jukka Tapanim\u00e4ki died 1 May 2000 due to heart failure caused by coronary heart disease. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1961 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Finnish computer programmers Category:Video game programmers ",
