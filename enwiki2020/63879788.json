    "text": "J\u00e1nos Barlab\u00e1ssy de Csesztve (; 1482\u20131560) was a Hungarian prelate in the first half of the 16th century. As a loyal partisan of King John Z\u00e1polya, he served as de facto the last Bishop of Csan\u00e1d between 1537 and 1552, before the Ottoman Empire conquered the southern parts of the Kingdom of Hungary, including the whole territory of the diocese. ==Early life== J\u00e1nos (IV) was born into a Transylvanian noble family in Csesztve, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Cisteiu de Mure\u0219, Romania) in 1482. His father was J\u00e1nos III, whose brother L\u00e9n\u00e1rd was an influential magnate and patron of arts in Transylvania at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries. His mother was the first unidentified wife of his father. J\u00e1nos also had several siblings, Mih\u00e1ly III, Gergely, Katalin and Zs\u00f3fia, in addition to half-siblings Ferenc I and J\u00e1nos VI (from their father's second marriage). Some of the members of his family (for instance, his grandfather J\u00e1nos II and uncle L\u00e9n\u00e1rd) financially supported that Humanist scholar circle, which centered around Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r (Alba Iulia). His deeply religious father intended his secondborn namesake son for an ecclesiastical career. His education was determined by the influence of the Humanist-Renaissance intellectual trend. According to a contemporary record, J\u00e1nos attended the University of Vienna in 1505. Here he met and befriended with Bohemian-born historian and poet Stephanus Taurinus, who later moved to Hungary due to this relationship. J\u00e1nos continued his studied at the University of Bologna by 19 October 1508. He was already a canon of the cathedral chapter of Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r during that time. Barlab\u00e1ssy was first styled as magister by a document issued in 1517. Some historians claimed he also attended the University of Krak\u00f3w in 1527, but it is plausible that data concerns to his namesake cousin (L\u00e9n\u00e1rd's son). Joining the local Humanist circle, Barlab\u00e1ssy financially supported the construction of the Lazo chapel within the St. Michael's Cathedral of Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, built by his relative J\u00e1nos L\u00e1szai. His coat-of-arms, which depicted a bison head could be found on the main ledge of the northern main facade (disappeared during later renovations). ==Ecclesiastical career== Beside his rank of canon at the cathedral chapter of Transylvania, Barlab\u00e1ssy was elevated into the church offices of archdeacon of Szentkir\u00e1ly and Gomb\u00e1s (present-day S\u00e2ncrai and G\u00e2mba\u0219, respectively) by 19 September 1518, when bought portions and a mill at Csombord (Ciumbrud). Together with his family, Barlab\u00e1ssy was a long-time partisan of Voivode John Z\u00e1polya, who governed Transylvania since 1510. Following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs, when the Ottoman Empire crushed the Hungarian royal army and King Louis II was killed, Barlab\u00e1ssy attended that diet in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, which had proclaimed Z\u00e1polya as King of Hungary on 10 November 1526. A month later, Z\u00e1polya's rival Ferdinand of Habsburg was also elected king by another diet summoned in Pressburg (Bratislava). Following the death of Giovanni Bonzagno, King John Z\u00e1polya and his spouse, Queen Isabella Jagiellon appointed J\u00e1nos Barlab\u00e1ssy as Bishop of Csan\u00e1d in 1537. The diocese laid in the frontier zone between Z\u00e1polya's realm (in historiography, also known as the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom) and the Ottoman Empire. Barlab\u00e1ssy was a protegee of Bishop George Martinuzzi, King John Z\u00e1polya's most powerful advisor. Martinuzzi reserved for himself the administration and finances (taxes) of the diocese because of the military situation, overshadowing Barlab\u00e1ssy's episcopate (as a result, earlier histroiographical works considered mistakenly that Martinuzzi, who served as Bishop of V\u00e1rad, was also Bishop of Csan\u00e1d during that time). Pope Paul III confirmed Barlab\u00e1ssy's appointment on 30 May 1539. Having regard to Barlab\u00e1ssy's \"merits and virtues\", the pope sent the deed of approval with papal legate and chamberlain Hieronymus Rorarius on 29 June 1539. Pope Paul also instructed Cardinal Girolamo Aleandro to explain the reason for the confirmations of Barlab\u00e1ssy and other pro-John bishops to Ferdinand, who resented the decision of the Roman Curia. As an atonement, Pope Paul III decided to spend procuratio (appointment fee) on maintaining the southern military frontier castle system along the border with the Ottoman Empire. John Z\u00e1polya died on 22 July 1540. George Martinuzzi and Queen Isabella secured the infant John Sigismund's inheritance, which violated the Treaty of V\u00e1rad, concluded between Ferdinand and John two years earlier. Ferdinand requested the pope to instruct the pro- Z\u00e1polya bishops \u2013 including Barlab\u00e1ssy \u2013 to acknowledge Ferdinand as the sole rightful ruler in accordance with the treaty. However, Barlab\u00e1ssy and other prelates remained partisans of the Z\u00e1polya family and Martinuzzi. In response, Ferdinand I did not recognize Barlab\u00e1ssy's legitimacy and appointed a Transdanubian clergyman Ferenc Ugody as Bishop of Csan\u00e1d on 26 August 1540. During that time, there were several dioceses in Hungary, where two rival and co-claimant bishops were appointed to their positions simultaneously. Barlab\u00e1ssy resided most of his tenure as bishop in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, his position was merely titular due to George Martinuzzi's influence over the Diocese of Csan\u00e1d. King Ferdinand sought to convince Barlab\u00e1ssy to become his confidant, in order to divide the unity of John Sigismund's party. In July 1542, his royal document styled Barlab\u00e1ssy as \"Bishop of Csan\u00e1d\" and assured him to confirm that privileges, inaugurations and donations which were made by the late John Z\u00e1polya in favor of the bishop. Barlab\u00e1ssy remained a supporter of Queen Isabella and John Sigismund. He attended the diet at Torda (Turda) on 1 August 1544. According to Martinuzzi's record from February 1550, Barlab\u00e1ssy had various lawsuits with nobleman Mikl\u00f3s Forr\u00f3. The litigation process took place in Radn\u00f3t (Iernut). Martinuzzi forced Isabella to renounce her son's realm in exchange for two Silesian duchies in 1551. John Sigismund and his mother settled in Poland. Martinuzzi was murdered in late 1551 upon the order of Ferdinand. To prevent the unification of the Kingdom of Hungary under a sole monarch, the Ottoman Empire launched a large-scale military campaign against the realm in 1552. The Turks invaded and occupied the southern parts of the kingdom, including the whole territory of the Diocese of Csan\u00e1d, which de facto ceased to exist. Ferdinand I, who was left without a rival for the throne of Hungary until 1556, deprived Barlab\u00e1ssy from his position in 1552. He appointed Ferenc Sz\u00e9kely as Bishop of Csan\u00e1d in the following year. Barlab\u00e1ssy remained in Gyulafeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in the subsequent years, but was forced to leave the town due to the spread of Calvinism in 1556. The former bishop retired to his family estates, where he died in 1560, at the age of 77 or 78. == References == == Sources == * * Category:1482 births Category:1560 deaths Category:15th-century Hungarian people Category:16th-century Hungarian people Category:16th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Bishops of Csan\u00e1d Category:University of Vienna alumni Category:University of Bologna alumni Category:People from Ocna Mure\u0219 John 04 ",
