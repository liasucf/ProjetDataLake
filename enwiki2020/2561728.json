He held various municipal offices under the Revolution and came in 1793 to Paris, where he produced his first opera, Le R\u00eave, in 1799, in collaboration with Antoine- Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gresnick. Although \u00c9tienne continued to write for the Paris theatres for twenty years from that date, he is remembered chiefly as the author of one comedy, which excited considerable controversy. Les Deux Gendres was represented at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais on 11 August 1810, and procured for its author a seat in the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise. A rumour was put in circulation that \u00c9tienne had drawn largely on a manuscript play in the imperial library, entitled Conaxa, ou les gendres dupes. His rivals were not slow to take up the charge of plagiarism, to which \u00c9tienne replied that the story was an old one (it existed in an old French fabliaus) and had already been treated by Alexis Piron in Les Fils ingrats. He was, however, driven later to make admissions which at least showed a certain lack of candour. The bitterness of the attacks made on him was no doubt in part due to his position as editor-in-chief of the official Journal de l'Empire. His next play, L'Intrigante (1812), hardly maintained the high level of Les Deux Gendres; the patriotic opera L'Oriflamme and his lyric masterpiece Joconde date from 1814. \u00c9tienne had been secretary to Hugues-Bernard Maret, Duc de Bassano, and in this capacity had accompanied Napoleon throughout his campaigns in Italy, Germany, Austria and Poland. During these journeys he produced one of his best pieces, Brueys et Palaprat (1807). During the Restoration \u00c9tienne was an active member of the opposition. He was seven times returned as deputy for the d\u00e9partement of Meuse, and was in full sympathy with the revolution of 1830, but the reforms actually carried out did not fulfil his expectations, and he gradually retired from public life. Among his other plays may be noted: Les Deux M\u00e8res, Le Pacha de Suresnes, and La Petite Ecole des pres, all produced in 1802, in collaboration with his friend Charles Gaugiran de Nanteuil (1778\u20131830). With Alphonse Dieudonn\u00e9 Martainville (1779\u20131830) he wrote an Histoire du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais (5 vols, 1802) during the revolutionary period. \u00c9tienne was a bitter opponent of the romanticists, one of whom, Alfred de Vigny, was his successor and panegyrist in the Academy. He was an Officer in the Legion of Honour, and was buried in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.http://www.appl- lachaise.net/appl/article.php3?id_article=928 In Bruis et Palaprat, \u00c9tienne penned the phrase \"On n'est jamais servi si bien que par soi-m\u00eame\", which has widely been translated as \"If you want something done right, do it yourself\", although the literal translation is \"One is never served so well as by oneself\".Bruis et Palaprat by Charles-Guillaume \u00c9tienne, published in 1807, Madame Masson (Paris)Dictionary of Quotations (French) == Works == Caricature by Honor\u00e9 Daumier Theatre *1799: Le R\u00eave, op\u00e9ra comique in 1 act and in prose, lyrics by citizen \u00c9tienne, music by citizen Gresnich, Paris, Op\u00e9ra-Comique, 8 pluvi\u00f4se an VII *1800: Rembrandt ou la Vente apr\u00e8s d\u00e9c\u00e8s, vaudeville anecdotique in 1 act, by citizens \u00c9tienne, Morel, Servi\u00e8re and Moras, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Troubadours, 26 fructidor an VIII *1800: Le Chaudronnier, Homme d'\u00c9tat, comedy in three acts and in prose, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Ambigu-Comique, 1er thermidor an VIII *1800: La Lettre sans adresse, comedy in 1 act and in prose, mingled with vaudevilles... by citizens \u00c9tienne and Moras, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Troubadours, 26 vend\u00e9miaire an IX *1800: L'Apollon du Belv\u00e9dere ou l'Oracle, folie-vaudeville impromptue in 1 act, by citizens \u00c9tienne, Moras and Gaugiran-Nanteuil, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Troubadours, 29, 30 brumaire, 1er, 2 and 3 frimaire an IX *1801: Pont-de- Veyle ou le Bonnet de docteur, com\u00e9die en vaudeville in 1 act, by citizens Gosse and \u00c9tienne, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s, 6 vend\u00e9miaire an X *1801: D\u00e9sir\u00e9e ou la Paix du village, allegory in 1 act, in vaudevilles, by citizens Gaugiran- Nanteuil, Moras and \u00c9tienne, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Favart, 5 germinal an IX *1801: Le Grand Deuil, op\u00e9ra bouffon, lyrics by citizens J.-B.
