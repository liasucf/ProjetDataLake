    "text": "\"Predictable\" is a pop rock song written by Kara DioGuardi, Delta Goodrem and Jarrad Rogers, recorded by Goodrem for her first album Innocent Eyes (2003). Released in the last quarter of 2003, the single peaked at number-one on the Australian ARIA Charts, becoming Goodrem's fifth number-one single in Australia. This achievement broke the record set by Goodrem for the most consecutive number-ones from a debut album; the original record was held by Kylie Minogue. Due to Goodrem's cancer treatment, she was unable to shoot an accompanying film clip; Sony used a live video to represent the song. The live video was shot at the headquarters for Channel V in July 2003. The song was produced by John Fields in Los Angeles. Originally, the demo version of the song was rather different from the end product; however, Goodrem desired the song to have a rock edge to it, thus asking Fields to help produce it. The song is set around the theme of a girl rejecting the advances of a man, because she can see through his facade, and knows that if she lets him enter her life, she will end up heartbroken. The song was chosen by Goodrem's record company, Sony, to be the last single to represent the album Innocent Eyes. The single was released with three different, collectable picture discs, and faced competition from international and local acts and debuted at number two, behind the first Australian Idol, Guy Sebastian. Due to her illness and treatment, the single received little promotion but two weeks after release, the song reached number one. The single remained in the top ten for eight weeks and became the seventeenth-highest-selling single in Australia for 2003. During the first season of Australian Idol in the wildcard week, contestant Cosima De Vito performed her version of \"Predictable\" to get into the top 12. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2003) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !End of year chart (2003) !Position |- |Australian Singles Chart |align=center|17 |- |} ===Decade-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2000\u20132009) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- |scope=\"row\"| Australia Singles (ARIA) |align=\"center\"|43 |- |scope=\"row\"| Australian Artist Singles (ARIA) |align=\"center\"|7 |} ==Sales== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Country !align=\"left\"|Certification !align=\"left\"|Sales |- |align=\"left\"|Australia |align=\"center\"|2\u00d7 platinum |align=\"center\"|165,829Sales in Australia Retrieved 7 September 2010. |- |} ==External links== *Song lyrics * == References == Category:2003 singles Category:Delta Goodrem songs Category:Number-one singles in Australia Category:Songs written by Kara DioGuardi Category:Songs written by Delta Goodrem Category:Pop ballads Category:Songs written by Jarrad Rogers Category:Song recordings produced by John Fields (record producer) Category:2003 songs ",
