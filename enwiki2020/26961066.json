On April 27, 2000, he was honored by being made an Officer in the OC (Order of Canada). During his 44-year career at the NFB, Daly produced and executive-produced more than 300 films.\"NFB pioneer Tom Daly dies at age 93.\" CBC News September 21, 2011. Retrieved: May 2, 2016. ==Early years== Daly learned the art of film editing from filmmaker Stuart Legg and documentary pioneer and NFB founder John Grierson, who had hired Daly in 1940 directly following his graduation from the University of Toronto. Daly was passionate about assisting in the NFB's war effort. Grierson was apparently taken with Daly\u2019s intellect and bookish manner and brought him aboard as a production assistant, joking calling him \u201cthe best butler in the business,\u201d an expression which would serve as the title for film scholar D.B. Jones\u2019s decades later book on Daly, The Best Butler in the Business: Tom Daly of the National Film Board of Canada.Brownstein, Bill. \"Looking back on the work of Tom Daly.\" Vancouver Sun, October 5, 2011. Retrieved: May 2, 2016. ==Unit B== As head of the NFB's Unit B, Daly was involved in, or responsible for, numerous milestones and achievements in both documentary and animation film art, including Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 and Direct Cinema productions.Evans 1984, p. 128. He was also heavily involved in the multi-projector cinematic presentation In the Labyrinth, which eventually led to the development of IMAX. Daly was persuaded to put aside his studio responsibilities for a year and a half to edit In the Labyrinth. Daly also produced such works as Colin Low's Corral, Wolf Koenig and Roman Kroitor\u2019s Lonely Boy, Koenig and Low\u2019s City of Gold, Kroitor and Low\u2019s Universe, Arthur Lipsett\u2019s Very Nice, Very Nice, Robin Spry's One Man, and Gerald Potterton\u2019s animated short My Financial Career. Daly also served as executive producer on Candid Eye, a 14-part cinema-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 series made between 1958 and 1961.Khouri 2007, p. 36. Daly ran a mixed-discipline studio that included many of the most talented Canadian film- makers of the time, including an animation group with luminaries such as Norman McLaren, Don Arioli, and Robert Verrall; a documentary team including Roman Kroitor and Terence Macartney-Filgate.McInnes 2004, p. 135. Both Colin Low and Wolf Koenig worked at various times in both areas. ==Retirement and death== In 1980, Daly received an honorary doctorate from Concordia University.\"Honorary Degree Citation: Tom Daly.\" Concordia University Archives.
