So, we need to appreciate the differences. If we do, maybe we can live better with one another.\u201d The music video was released on 8 August 2019, co-directed by Chris Verene and Michael Maxxis, who Green had previously collaborated with on Alexisonfire's video for Familiar Drugs. ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2019) !Peak position |- |Canada Rock |align=\"center\"|2 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:City and Colour songs Category:Songs written by Dallas Green (musician) Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs ",
