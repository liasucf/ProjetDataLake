From 1987 to 2018, Fowler led a research group at Scripps Research, serving as an Associate Dean for Graduate Studies starting in 2013 and the acting Chair of the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology from 2014-2015. In 2018, she became the Chair of the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Delaware. Fowler has served as an editorial board member at the Journal of Biological Chemistry since 2012, and an associate editor at the same journal since 2013. Fowler's research has focused on the formation and shape of red blood cells as influenced by their cytoskeleton, specifically actin and myosin. She also studies the role of actin in eye lens function. == Awards and honors== Selected awards: * National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship Award (1975-1978) * Jane Coffin Childs Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship Award (1980-1982) * NIH New Investigator Research Grant Award (1983-1984) * American Heart Association Established Investigator Award (1990-1995) == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century American biologists Category:21st-century American biologists Category:University of Delaware faculty Category:Oberlin College alumni Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Cell biologists Category:American women biologists Category:20th- century American women scientists Category:21st-century American women scientists Category:American women biochemists Category:21st-century American chemists Category:20th-century American chemists Category:Academic journal editors ",
