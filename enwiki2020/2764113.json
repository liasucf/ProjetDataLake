    "text": "\"Fire in the hole\" is a warning that an explosive detonation in a confined space is imminent. It originated with miners, who needed to warn their fellows that a charge had been set. The phrase appears in this sense in state mining regulations, in military and corporate procedures, and in various mining and military blasting-related print books and narratives, e.g., during bomb disposal or throwing grenades into a confined space. In common parlance it has become a catchphrase for a warning of the type \"Watch out!\" or \"Heads up!\". NASA has used the term to describe a means of staging a multistage rocket vehicle by igniting the upper stage simultaneously with the ejection of the lower stage, without a usual delay of several seconds. On the Apollo 5 unmanned flight test of the first Apollo Lunar Module, a \"fire in the hole test\" used this procedure to simulate a lunar landing abort. Gene Kranz describes the test in his autobiography: > The fire-in-the-hole test involved shutting down the descent rocket, blowing > the bolts that attached the ascent and descent stages, switching control and > power to the ascent stage, and igniting the ascent rocket while still > nestled to the landing stage. == References == Category:English phrases Category:Explosion protection ",
