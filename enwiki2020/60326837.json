While the Norwegian Joy, Bliss and Encore are nearly identical, the Escape has many design features carried over from the original breakaway class, and is smaller than her three younger sisters. |- | Norwegian Escape || style=\"text- align:Center;\"| 2015 || style=\"text-align:Center;\"| 2015\u2013Present || style=\"text-align:Center;\"| ||align=\"Left\" | Closer resemblance to Breakaway class|| 200px |- | Norwegian Joy || style=\"text-align:Center;\"| 2017 || style=\"text-align:Center;\"| 2017\u2013Present || style=\"text-align:Center;\"| ||align=\"Left\" | || 200px |- | Norwegian Bliss || style=\"text-align:Center;\"| 2018 || style=\"text-align:Center;\"| 2018\u2013Present || style=\"text- align:Center;\"| ||align=\"Left\" | || 200px |- | Norwegian Encore || style=\"text-align:Center;\"| 2019 || style=\"text-align:Center;\"| 2019\u2013Present || style=\"text-align:Center;\"| ||align=\"Left\" |Last ship in the Breakaway-plus Class|| 200px |} ==References== ==External links== Category:Cruise ship classes Category:Norwegian Cruise Line ",
