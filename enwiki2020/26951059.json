    "text": "Pseudobahia peirsonii is a rare species of flowering plant in the aster family known by the common names San Joaquin adobe sunburst and Tulare pseudobahia. It is endemic to California, where it is known from a few mostly small occurrences along the southeastern side of the San Joaquin Valley where it rises into the Sierra Nevada foothills. It grows in grassland and oak woodland habitat. It prefers heavy adobe clay soils.USFWS. Determination of Endangered Status for Pseudobahia bahiifolia (Hartweg's golden sunburst) and Threatened Status for Pseudobahia peirsonii (San Joaquin adobe sunburst), Two Grassland Plants From the Central Valley of California. Federal Register February 6, 1997. The plant became a federally listed threatened of the United States in 1997.California Native Plant Society Rare Plant Profile This species is an annual herb growing 20 to 70 centimeters tall. It has a thin coating of woolly hairs. The leaves are up to 6 centimeters long and are generally divided into a few leaflets which are subdivided into lobed segments. The inflorescence is a solitary flower head lined with about eight phyllaries which are fused at the base, making the involucre a rounded cup with pointed lobes. There are about 8 golden ray florets. At the center of the head are yellow disc florets. The main threat to its remaining populations is destruction of its habitat for residential development. Other threats include grazing and agriculture and maintenance of flood control structures, transmission lines, and roads. The heavy presence of competitive exotic plants in the habitat, including charlock (Sinapis arvensis), stork's bill (Erodium cicutarium), and non-native bromes, is detrimental. ==References== ==External links== * Calflora Database: Pseudobahia peirsonii (San Joaquin adobe sunburst) *Jepson Manual Treatment *USDA Plants Profile *Flora of North America *Photo gallery Category:Madieae Category:Endemic flora of California Category:Flora of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.) Category:Natural history of the California chaparral and woodlands Category:Natural history of the Central Valley (California) Category:Natural history of Fresno County, California Category:Natural history of Kern County, California Category:Natural history of Tulare County, California Category:Critically endangered flora of California Category:Plants described in 1949 ",
