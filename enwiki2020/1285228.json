It often includes intellectual, physical, social and other overestimations.Robin M. Kowalski ed., Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors (1997) p. 112 The egotist has an overwhelming sense of the centrality of the 'Me' regarding their personal qualities.William Walker Atkinson, The New Psychology (2010 [1909]) p. 30 Egotism means placing oneself at the centre of one's world with no concern for others, including those \"loved\" or considered as \"close\", in any other terms except those subjectively set by the egotist. ==Characteristics== Egotism is closely related to an egocentric love for one's imagined self or narcissism \u2013 indeed some would say \"by egotism we may envisage a kind of socialized narcissism\".Samuel D. Schmalhausen, Why We Misbehave (2004 [1928]) p. 55 Egotists have a strong tendency to talk about themselves in a self-promoting fashion, and they may well be arrogant and boastful with a grandiose sense of their own importance.Kowalski ed., p. 1114 Their inability to recognise the accomplishments of othersMark R. Leary, The Curse of the Self (OUP 2007) p. 91 leaves them profoundly self-promoting; while sensitivity to criticism may lead on the egotist's part to narcissistic rage at a sense of insult.Kowalski ed., p. 121-2 Egotism differs from both altruism \u2013 or behaviour motivated by the concern for others rather than for oneself \u2013 and from egoism, the constant pursuit of one's self-interest. Various forms of \"empirical egoism\" have been considered consistent with egotism, but do not \u2013 which is also the case with egoism in general \u2013 necessitate having an inflated sense of self.Kowalski ed., p. 113 ==Development== In developmental terms, two rather different trajectories can be distinguished with respect to egotism \u2013 the one individual, the other cultural. With respect to the developing individual, a movement takes place from egocentricity to sociality during the process of growing up.J. C. Fl\u00fcgel, Man, Morals and Society (1973) p. 242\u20133 It is normal for an infant to have an inflated \u2013 almost a majestic \u2013 sense of egotism.Sigmund Freud, On Metapsychology (PFL 11) p. 85 The over-evaluation of one's own egoOtto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 38 and p. 57 regularly appears in childish forms of love \u2013 in large part because the baby is to himself everything, omnipotent to the best of their own knowledge.Robin Skynner and John Cleese, Families and how to survive them (London 1994) p. 91 Optimal development allows a gradual reconciliation to a more realistic view of one's own place in the world \u2013 a lessening of the egotistical swollen head.Skynner & Cleese, Families p. 63 Less adequate adjustment may later lead to what has been called defensive egotism, serving to overcompensate for the fragility of the underlying concept of self.Kowalski ed., p. 224 Robin Skynner however considered that in the main growing up leads to a state where \"your ego is still there, but it's taking its proper limited place among all the other egos\".Robin Skynner and John Cleese, Life and how to survive it (London 1994) p. 241 However, alongside such a positive trajectory of diminishing individual egotism, a rather different arc of development can be noted in cultural terms, linked to what has been seen as the increasing infantilism of post-modern society.R. Bly and M. Woodman, The Maiden King (1999) p. 85\u20138 Whereas in the nineteenth century egotism was still widely regarded as a traditional vice \u2013 for Nathaniel Hawthorne egotism was a sort of diseased self-contemplationMalcolm Cowley, ed., The Portable Hawthorne (Penguin 1977) p. 177 \u2013 Romanticism had already set in motion a countervailing current, what Richard Eldridge described as a kind of \"cultural egotism, substituting the individual imagination for vanishing social tradition\".Richard Eldridge, The Persistence of Romanticism (2001) p. 118 The romantic idea of the self- creating individual \u2013 of a self-authorizing, artistic egotismScott Wilson, in Patricia Waugh, ed., Literary Theory and Criticism (2006) p. 563\u20134 \u2013 then took on broader social dimensions in the following century. Keats might still attack Wordsworth for the regressive nature of his retreat into the egotistical sublime;Henry Hart, Robert Lowell and the Sublime (1995) p. 30 but by the close of the twentieth century egotism had been naturalized much more widely by the Me generation into the Culture of Narcissism. In the 21st century, romantic egotism has been seen as feeding into techno-capitalism in two complementary ways:Wilson, p. 565-6 on the one hand, through the self- centred consumer, focused on their own self-fashioning through brand 'identity'; on the other through the equally egotistical voices of 'authentic' protest, as they rage against the machine, only to produce new commodity forms that serve to fuel the system for further consumption. ==Sex== There is a question mark over the relationship between sex and egotism. Sigmund Freud popularly made the claim that love can transform the egotist,Schmalhausen, p. 153 giving him or her a new sense of humility in relation to others.Sigmund Freud, On Metapsychology (PFL 11) p. 93 At the same time, it is very apparent that egotism can readily show itself in sexual waysSchmalhausen, p. 34 and indeed arguably one's whole sexuality may function in the service of egotistical needs.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 516-7 ==Etymology== The term egotism is derived from the Greek (\"\u03b5\u03b3\u03ce\") and subsequently its Latinised ego (ego), meaning \"self\" or \"I,\" and -ism, used to denote a system of belief. As such, the term shares early etymology with egoism. ==Cultural examples== * A. A. Milne has been praised for his clear-eyed vision of the ruthless, open, unashamed egotism of the young child.Ann Thwaite, A. A. Milne: His Life (2006) p. 123 and p. 194 * Ryan Holiday described our cultural values as dependent on validation, entitled, and ruled by our emotions, a form of egotism. ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * by George Santayana * B.
