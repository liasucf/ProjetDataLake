Until the age of 23, he alternated between the third and fourth levels of Portuguese football, representing Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal B, O Elvas C.A.D. and G.D. Ribeir\u00e3o. In the summer of 2009, Pica signed for Segunda Liga club Varzim S.C. and, on 8 August, made his professional debut in a 1\u20130 home win against C.D. F\u00e1tima in the first round of the Ta\u00e7a da Liga. In January 2011, he moved to fellow league side Moreirense FC. In June 2012, after spending one season with C.D. Tondela in division three on loan, Pica agreed to a permanent deal after helping to promotion to the second tier. In the 2014\u201315 campaign, he contributed with 19 games and one goal as his team reached the Primeira Liga for the first time in their history and, subsequently, renewed his expiring contract for a further year. Pica played his first match in the top flight on 20 December 2015, featuring the full 90 minutes in a 1\u20133 home loss against Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal. Initially fourth or fifth-choice stopper, he was an everpresent figure in the season's final stretch, scoring three goals in seven games as Tondela avoided relegation in the last matchday. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:Vit\u00f3ria F.C. players Category:O Elvas C.A.D. players Category:G.D.
