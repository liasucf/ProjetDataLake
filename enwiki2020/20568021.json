The NRDC was established in India in 1953 to help develop and promote technologies developed at various national R&D; institutions. The first commercial size hovercraft, the SR.N1, was built under a contract let by the NRDC to Saunders-Roe in 1958.Barties World In 1981, the NRDC was combined with the National Enterprise Board ('NEB') to form the British Technology Group ('BTG').Abstract of Department of Trade and Industry report \"Monitoring of British Technology Group\" ==Operations== Typically the NRDC would patent the product for commercial exploitation and earn royalties as private sector companies generated sales from those products. Examples of such products include carbon fibre, asbestos-plastic composites and developments in semi-conductor technology. The development of the hovercraft would also not have taken place without the involvement of the NRDC.Hovercraft Development Ltd, Hansard, 1966 In the 1970s, a team of Rothamsted Research scientists discovered three pyrethroids suitable for use as insecticides, namely permethrin, cypermethrin and deltamethrin. These compounds were subsequently licensed as NRDC 143, 149 and 161 respectively, to companies which then manufactured them for use worldwide. == List of chairmen == * 1950\u20131955: Percy Mills, 1st Viscount Mills * 1955\u20131957: Sir Alan Arthur Saunders * 1957\u20131969: William Black, Baron Black * 1969\u20131979: Frank Schon, Baron Schon ==See also== *National Enterprise Board *Minister of Technology *Alvey ==References== ==Further reading== * Lavington, Simon. \"NRDC and the Market.\" Moving Targets, History of Computing (2011): 147-191. * John Crawley (1993) NRDC\u2019s role in the early British computer industry.
