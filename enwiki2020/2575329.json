Daily Mail; London (UK) [London (UK)]08 Feb 2014: 40. ==Reception== According to one obituary of Sharp, \"He never quite became a household name. He had a life and a lifestyle he enjoyed and that seemed to be enough. He had a huge talent, but sometimes seemed to lack ambition, or was reluctant to commit himself or seemed afflicted with doubt about his own abilities, dismissing his work as 'pastiche'.\"Alan Sharp: Glaswegian novelist and scriptwriter who became the toast of Hollywood with his screenplays for hit films [Edition 3] Sharp, Alan. The Times 16 Feb 2013: 88. In the 1970s, six of Sharp's screenplays became high-profile Hollywood feature films, most of them dealing with quintessentially American themes and characters. Walter Chaw writes of Sharp's screenplays from this period, \"On the strength of his scripts for The Hired Hand, Ulzana's Raid, and Night Moves, Scottish novelist Alan Sharp seems well at home with the better-known, more highly regarded writers and directors of the New American Cinema. Sharp's screenplays are marked by a narrative complexity and situations gravid with implication and doom.\" Trevor Johnston has written that \"There's an argument to suggest that a certain seventysomething Scot could well be Britain's greatest living screenwriter. Much is made of pre-Star Wars '70s Hollywood as a kind of celluloid golden age, and Alan Sharp was there in the thick of it, working with the very best, generating the sort of track record few British screenwriters are likely to match.\" Trevor Johnston is a film critic for Time Out London. His article is a detailed appreciation of Sharp's adaptation of Lord Dunsany's 1936 novella, My Talks with Dean Spanley, for the film Dean Spanley (2008). David N. Meyer has incorporated an appreciation of Sharp's writing in his review of Night Moves (directed by Arthur Penn in 1975). Following a description of an important seduction scene from the film, Meyer adds: \"These delicious, poisonous moments \u2013 these cookies full of arsenic \u2013 come courtesy of Alan Sharp's venomous, entrapping, perfectly circular screenplay. It's hard not to regard him \u2013 rather than Penn \u2013 as the engine of Night Moves' enduring power. Sharp had an unbroken forty year career writing features and television.\" Quentin Curtis called the screenplay for Rob Roy \"one of the best screenplays in the last decade\". ==Selected credits== *First Night - episode \"Funny Noises with Their Mouths\" (1963) - writer - starred Michael Caine, Ian McShane *The Wednesday Play - episode \"A Knight in Tarnished Armour\" (1965) - writer *Double Image - episode \"Home and Away\" (1966) - writer *ITV Playhouse - episode \"A Sound from the Sea\" (1970) - writer *Play for Today - episode \"The Long Distance Piano Player \" (1970) - writer *The Last Run (1971) - writer *The Hired Hand (1971) - writerThe Hired Hand *Ulzana's Raid (1972) - writer, associate producer *Billy Two Hats (1974) - writer *Night Moves (1975) - writer *Damnation Alley (1977) - writer *Coming Out of the Ice (1982) - writer *The Year of Living Dangerously (1982) - writer (uncredited) *The Osterman Weekend (1983) - writer *Little Treasure (1985) - writer, director *The Edge (1989) - writer *Love and Lies (1990) - writer *Descending Angel (1990) - writer *Mission of the Shark: The Saga of the U.S.S.
