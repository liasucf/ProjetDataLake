The Pushkaram is observed for a period of 12 days from the time of entry of Jupiter into Virgo (Kanya rasi). The festival is \"theoretically\" observed throughout the twelve months that the planet remains in that sign, but the first 12 days are considered most sacred as per the beliefs of Indians. Pushkaram has been an age old practice in southern states Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. In 2016, the celebration started on 12 August and ended on 23 August.
