    "text": "Spartium junceum, the Spanish broom, rush broom or weaver's broom, is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae. It is the sole species in the genus Spartium, but is closely related to the other brooms in the genera Cytisus and Genista. There are many binomials in Spartium that are of dubious validity (see below). The Latin specific epithet junceum means \"rush-like\", referring to the shoots, which show a passing resemblance to those of the rush genus Juncus. ==Distribution and habitat== This species is native to the Mediterranean in southern Europe, southwest Asia and northwest Africa, where it is found in sunny sites, usually on dry, sandy soils. ==Description== S. junceum is a vigorous, deciduous shrub growing to tall, rarely , with main stems up to thick, rarely . It has thick, somewhat succulent grey-green rush- like shoots with very sparse small deciduous leaves 1 to 3 cm long and up to 4 mm broad. The leaves are of little importance to the plant, with much of the photosynthesis occurring in the green shoots (a water-conserving strategy in its dry climate). The leaves fall away early.Jepson Manual Treatment In late spring and summer shoots are covered in profuse fragrant yellow pea-like flowers 1 to 2 cm across. In late summer, the legumes (seed pods) mature black and reach long. They burst open, often with an audible crack, spreading seed from the parent plant. ==Invasive species== Spartium junceum has been widely introduced into other areas, and is regarded as a noxious invasive species in places with a Mediterranean climate such as California and Oregon, Hawaii, central Chile, southeastern Australia, the Western Cape in South Africa and the Canary Islands and Azores.US Forest Service Fire Ecology It was first introduced to California as an ornamental plant.Element Stewardship: S. junceum ==Uses== The plant is used as an ornamental plant in gardens and in landscape plantings. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. In Bolivia and Peru, the plant is known as retama, (not to be confused with the genus Retama) and has become very well established in some areas. It is one of the most common ornamental plants, often seen growing along sidewalks in La Paz. Retama has made its way into the ethnobotany of the indigenous Aymara and Quechua cultures. The plant is also used as a flavoring, and for its essential oil, known as genet absolute.FAO Its fibers have been used for cloth and it produces a yellow dye.botanical.com ==Gallery== Massif de gen\u00eats (Spartieum junceum).jpg Spartium junceum2.jpg|Flowers Fabaceae - Spartium junceum-003.JPG|Close-up of a flower Spartium junceum6.jpg|Mature fruit ==Nomina dubia== The status of the following species is unresolved: * Spartium acanthocladon Spreng. * Spartium acutifolium Lindl. * Spartium affine Spach * Spartium albicans Cav. * Spartium album Desf. * Spartium alpinum Host ex Steud. * Spartium ambigum Spach * Spartium americanum Meyen * Spartium amoenum Salisb. * Spartium angulosum Gilib. * Spartium aragonense Pourr. ex Willk. & Lange * Spartium arborescens Mill. * Spartium arboreum Desf. * Spartium argenteum Steud. * Spartium aspalatoides Desf. * Spartium aureum Cav. * Spartium baeticum Samp. * Spartium bourgaei (Boiss.)
