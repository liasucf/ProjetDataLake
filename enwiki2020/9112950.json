    "text": "S\u00f6dra Bankgr\u00e4nd in February 2007. S\u00f6dra Bankogr\u00e4nd (Swedish: \"Southern Bank Alley\") is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town of Stockholm, Sweden. Connecting Skeppsbron to \u00d6sterl\u00e5nggatan and J\u00e4rntorget, it forms a parallel street to Norra Bankogr\u00e4nd and Norra Dryckesgr\u00e4nd. Historically known as Banco-gr\u00e4nden (1729) and S\u00f6dra Bancogr\u00e4nd (1733), the historic cobblestones were renovated in 2001. The alley passes south of S\u00f6dra Bankohuset, the former building of the Bank of Sweden, first constructed by the architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder (1615\u20131684) during the period 1666\u20131682. The part of the building facing Skeppsbron was later rebuilt, and the bank moved to Helgeandsholmen in 1906. == See also == * List of streets and squares in Gamla stan == References == == External links == * hitta.se - Location map and virtual walk Category:Streets in Stockholm ",
