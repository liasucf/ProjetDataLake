    "text": "Mile Zero Signpost at the Railway Coastal Museum The Railway Coastal Museum is a transport museum located in St. John's, Newfoundland. It is located in the historic Newfoundland Railway terminal on Water Street and contains exhibits detailing the history of the Newfoundland Railway and the history of coastal water transportation in the province. The building was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1988 for its role in commemorating the important role played by the Newfoundland Railway in the social, economic and political history of the province. It was also designated a Heritage Railway Station in 1990. The museum opened in 2003 on a grant from the Johnson Family Foundation. The museum is also noteworthy as \"Mile Zero\" of the Trans-Canada Trail. With the closure of the Newfoundland Railway, the terminal is no longer connected to any tracks, which were all torn up and the rails put to other uses. The museum does not own or display any rolling stock as it is now surrounded by development. The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, and Virtual Museum of Canada.
