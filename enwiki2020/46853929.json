The film takes its name from the black capes worn by the students at the University of Coimbra.Creekmur p.62 The film was an enormous success at the box office in both Portugal and Brazil, despite criticism in Coimbra that depictions of the city and its musical tradition were not accurately represented. The film marked the debut of Am\u00e1lia Rodrigues, previously known as a radio star. The film's popularity led producers to rush out another film Fado: The Story of a Singer, which was loosely based on her own life story.Creekmur p.63 ==Cast== * Am\u00e1lia Rodrigues as Maria de Lisboa * Alberto Ribeiro as Jos\u00e9 Duarte * Artur Agostinho as Manecas * Vasco Morgado as Jorge * Barroso Lopes as Coca-Bichinhos * Humberto Madeira as J\u00e1-C\u00e1-Canta * Ant\u00f3nio Sacramento as Judge * Graziela Mendes * Joaquim Miranda * Fernando Silva as Cunha, the pawnbroker * Manuela Bonito * Alfonso Branco * Jo\u00e3o Calazans * Cremilda de Sousa as Dancer * Maria Em\u00edlia Vilas * Antonio Gon\u00e7alves as Dancer * Adozinda Mariano * Domingo Marques * Regina Montenegro * Passos Pereira * G\u00e9nia Silva * Tom\u00e1s de Macedo == References == ==Bibliography== * Creekmur, Corey K.
