    "text": "Jon Michael Varese (born December 17, 1971) is an American literary historian and novelist. He published his debut novel, The Spirit Photographer, in 2018; it is set in the Reconstruction era in Boston, Massachusetts and in Louisiana plantation country. == Early life and education == Varese was born in Miami, Florida. He was first introduced to literature and the work of Charles Dickens at the age of 14 through the mother of a friend. He graduated from Swarthmore College with a B.A. in English Literature, and earned his Masters and Ph.D. in Literature from the University of California, Santa Cruz. His dissertation, The Value of Storytelling, examined the development of 19th-century serial novels in Great Britain, with a focus on the early novels of Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, and George Eliot. == Career == === Fiction === Varese's debut novel, The Spirit Photographer (2018), is loosely based on the 19th-century American spirit photographer, William Mumler. Varese drew from his biography to create an independent novel about a protagonist who was a photographer in Boston after having worked with Matthew Brady during the Civil War to photograph the dead. One day he sees the face of an African-American woman he knew, who appears as a spirit in a glass-plate photograph of a couple seeking contact with their son who died young. The novel takes place during the Reconstruction era in U.S. history, exploring issues of northern and southern racism in post-Civil War America and the role of spiritualism in the widespread grief due to losses during the war. Varese has said that he was influenced in this novel by the work of civil rights activists Bryan Stevenson and Michelle Alexander, who have emphasized the connection between the slavery years and the history of the US since then. The Times Literary Supplement said there was not \"a dud word in this extraordinary debut novel,\" and compared Varese's writing to that of Wilkie Collins and Joseph Conrad.The Spirit Photographer, by Jon Michael Varese. Fiction. The Times Literary Supplement, September 14, 2018, p. 31.Booklist described the novel as \"an addicting tale.\" Chronogram Magazine wrote that it was an ambitious, sprawling debut, \"teeming with spirits, secrets, and trauma.\" PopMatters said that The Spirit Photographer was \"atmospheric, lyrical, and poignant\", and that it \"deftly interweaves strands of history and fantasy.\" The novel was praised by some academics. American Literature scholar Susan Gillman wrote that the novel unexpectedly brought \"race and Southern Gothic to the world of Boston after the Civil War,\" and that \"ghosts of a different kind\" haunted national memory in this \"groundbreaking new historical novel.\"The Spirit Photographer, book jacket blurb. American Civil War historian Bruce Levine called the novel \"stunning,\" writing that it combined \"the thrills of mystery and fantasy with the feel of historical authenticity.\"The Spirit Photographer, book jacket blurb. === Nonfiction and literary criticism === Varese\u2019s nonfiction and literary criticism have focused on the work of Charles Dickens, particularly Dickens\u2019s early novels and the publishing business that supported their development. Varese\u2019s edition of Great Expectations was published in 2012 under the Signature imprint of Barnes and Noble publishers. Similarly, Varese has published numerous public humanities articles that recast topics in Victorian literature for general audiences, including a series of pieces that he wrote for The Guardian from 2009-2010. Varese was an original contributor to the Oxford Handbook of Charles Dickens. His chapter on Nicholas Nickleby examined the role of contracts and English contract law in relation to Dickens\u2019s fiction during a time when concepts such as copyright, intellectual property, and royalty payments were being developed and debated in both professional and legal spheres. === Teaching and outreach work === Varese served as the Director of Digital Initiatives for The Dickens Project from 2010-2016. Earlier he had directed the development of the Our Mutual Friend Scholarly Pages (1998), a collaborative digital archive co-sponsored by The Dickens Project and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The collaboration produced one of the first of a few digital archiving projects to be published on the Internet. It was revised for the bi-centenary of Dickens\u2019s birth in 2012. In 2016, Varese was named Director of Public Outreach for The Dickens Project, a role he still occupies. He conducts liaison work between The Dickens Project and the University of Southern California\u2019s Neighborhood Academic Initiative (NAI), USC\u2019s primary outreach program to Title 1 schools in South Central Los Angeles.
