    "text": "Walter David Ehlers (May 7, 1921 \u2013 February 20, 2014) was a United States Army soldier and a recipient of the US armed forces' highest decoration, the Medal of Honor, for his actions in World War II. ==Early life== Ehlers was born on May 7, 1921, in Junction City, Kansas. ==Military service== Ehlers joined the Army from the city of Manhattan, Kansas in October 1940.WWII Army Enlistment Records He and his older brother Roland served in the same unit and participated in the fighting in North Africa and Sicily. By D-Day on June 6, 1944, Ehlers was a staff sergeant and squad leader in the 18th Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division. His squad, part of the invasion's second wave, waited off shore in a Landing Craft, Infantry, while the first group of soldiers landed. When the first wave became pinned down on the beach, his unit was transferred to a Higgins boat and sent forward early to assist. They fought their way off the beach and by June 9 were near the town of Goville, inland. On that day, he led his unit's attack against German forces and single-handedly defeated several enemy machine gun nests. The next day the platoon came under heavy fire. Ehlers was wounded, but managed to cover the platoon's withdrawal; this included carrying a wounded automatic rifleman to safety and running back through enemy fire to retrieve his Browning Automatic Rifle. After treatment of his wounds, Ehlers refused to be evacuated and continued to lead his squad. For his actions he was awarded the Medal of Honor five months later on 11 December 1944. He was decorated at Paris in the office of Lt. Gen. John C. H. Lee, Commanding General, Communications Zone, ETO. By this time Ehlers had received a battlefield commission to 2nd lieutenant. On July 14, more than a month after D-Day, Ehlers learned that his brother Roland had died at Omaha Beach when his landing craft was struck by a mortar shell. ==Later life== Ehlers appeared in the 1955 film The Long Gray Line, starring Tyrone Power. He went on to work for the Veterans Administration, and as a security guard at Disneyland, California. Ehlers died on February 20, 2014 of kidney failure in Long Beach, California. He was 92 years old. He was buried at Riverside National Cemetery in Riverside, California. Ehlers' Medal of Honor is on display at the National WWII Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana ==Personal life== Ehlers has a wife who passed away in 2017, 3 children, and 11 grandchildren, all of whom are still living. ==Medal of Honor citation== Staff Sergeant Ehlers' official Medal of Honor citation reads: > For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and > beyond the call of duty on 9\u201310 June 1944, near Goville, France. S/Sgt. > Ehlers, always acting as the spearhead of the attack, repeatedly led his men > against heavily defended enemy strong points exposing himself to deadly > hostile fire whenever the situation required heroic and courageous > leadership. Without waiting for an order, S/Sgt. Ehlers, far ahead of his > men, led his squad against a strongly defended enemy strong point, > personally killing 4 of an enemy patrol who attacked him en route. Then > crawling forward under withering machinegun fire, he pounced upon the > guncrew and put it out of action. Turning his attention to 2 mortars > protected by the crossfire of 2 machineguns, S/Sgt. Ehlers led his men > through this hail of bullets to kill or put to flight the enemy of the > mortar section, killing 3 men himself. After mopping up the mortar > positions, he again advanced on a machinegun, his progress effectively > covered by his squad. When he was almost on top of the gun he leaped to his > feet and, although greatly outnumbered, he knocked out the position single- > handed. The next day, having advanced deep into enemy territory, the platoon > of which S/Sgt. Ehlers was a member, finding itself in an untenable position > as the enemy brought increased mortar, machinegun, and small arms fire to > bear on it, was ordered to withdraw. S/Sgt. Ehlers, after his squad had > covered the withdrawal of the remainder of the platoon, stood up and by > continuous fire at the semicircle of enemy placements, diverted the bulk of > the heavy hostile fire on himself, thus permitting the members of his own > squad to withdraw. At this point, though wounded himself, he carried his > wounded automatic rifleman to safety and then returned fearlessly over the > shell-swept field to retrieve the automatic rifle which he was unable to > carry previously. After having his wound treated, he refused to be > evacuated, and returned to lead his squad. The intrepid leadership, > indomitable courage, and fearless aggressiveness displayed by S/Sgt. Ehlers > in the face of overwhelming enemy forces serve as an inspiration to others. ==See also== * List of Medal of Honor recipients for World War II ==References== ==External links== * * Interview at the Pritzker Military Museum & Library on December 5, 2007 * Interview at the Pritzker Military Museum & Library on July 21, 2011 * Category:1921 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Burials at Riverside National Cemetery Category:Deaths from kidney failure Category:People from Junction City, Kansas Category:United States Army soldiers Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:United States Army Medal of Honor recipients Category:World War II recipients of the Medal of Honor Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:Operation Overlord people ",
