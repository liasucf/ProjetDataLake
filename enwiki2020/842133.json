Founded by the Augustinian friars Ger\u00f3nimo Mar\u00edn and Francisco Bustos on May 16, 1584, it was the first capital of the historical military district/province of Negros in the late 18th century. The name Ilog (or Ylog, Tagalog for \"river\") was recommended by a Tagalog guide of the Spaniards because the place was entirely surrounded by the longest river on the whole Negros Island, the Hilabangan River. The first inhabitants of Ilog are mostly migrants from Panay island. ==Barangays== Ilog is politically subdivided into 15 barangays. * Andulauan * Balicotoc * Bocana * Calubang * Canlamay * Consuelo * Dancalan * Delicioso * Galicie * Manalad * Pinggot * Barangay I (Poblacion) * Barangay II (Poblacion) * Tabu * Vista Alegre ==Climate== ==Demographics== Hiligaynon is the major language of the city, with differences in tone and accent from the Hiligaynon used in Metro Bacolod. Filipino and English are widely taught. ==Tourism== The Kisi-Kisi Festival is celebrated every 25 March. \u201cKisi-kisi\u201d is a Hiligaynon term for the fast movement of crustaceans such as fish, prawns, crabs and shrimps that is abundant in the municipality. The main attraction of the festival is the Kisi- Kisi streetdancing parade competition among barangays that pays tribute to its rich marine resources. The town fiesta also honors the Se\u00f1or Santo Ni\u00f1o as their patron saint, that is why, before the dance parade a re-enactment of Sinulog is staged to show how their village was saved from the Moro pirates. Another exciting event to look forward during the opening day of the Kisi-Kisi Festival is the \"eat-all-you-can oysters\" (referred by tourists as Ilog Talaba Festival) which is open to all visitors. Freshly steamed oysters are served on a long bamboo table for those who would like to savor the seafood. Kisi-Kisi was started by Mark G. Vargas to help Ilog's tourism. ==References== ==External links== * Ilog Profile at PhilAtlas.com * [ Philippine Standard Geographic Code] *Philippine Census Information *Local Governance Performance Management System Category:Municipalities of Negros Occidental ",
