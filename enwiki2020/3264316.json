    "text": "Lanosterol is a tetracyclic triterpenoid and is the compound from which all animal and fungal steroids are derived. By contrast plant steroids are produced via cycloartenol. ==Role in biosynthesis of other steroids== Elaboration of lanosterol under enzyme catalysis leads to the core structure of steroids. 14-Demethylation of lanosterol by CYP51 eventually yields cholesterol. Simplified version of the lanosterol synthesis pathway with the intermediates isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), and squalene shown. Some intermediates are omitted. ==Biosynthesis== {| class=\"wikitable\" | Description || Illustration || Enzyme |- | Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate condense with reduction by NADPH to form squalene || 400px || squalene synthase |- | Squalene is oxidized to 2,3-oxidosqualene (squalene epoxide) || 400x400px || squalene monooxygenase |- | 2,3-Oxidosqualene is converted to a protosterol cation and finally to lanosterol || 400px || lanosterol synthase |- | (step 2) || 400px || (step 2) |} ==See also== *Cycloartenol *CYP51 ==References== * * * ==External links== Category:Sterols Category:Triterpenes Category:Lanostanes ",
