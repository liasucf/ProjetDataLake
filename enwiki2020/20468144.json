    "text": "1924\u201325 Huddersfield Town F.C. season saw Town retain their title for the second consecutive season. Under the guidance of Herbert Chapman, they won the title by 2 clear points from West Bromwich Albion. The mood suddenly changed at the end of the season when Chapman suddenly resigned. ==Squad at the start of the season== ==Review== After winning their first title, Herbert Chapman's team didn't want to give their title back in a hurry, winning their first 4 games and being unbeaten for their 10 league games. Town's defensive line were particularly impressive, only conceding 28 goals during the league season and never conceded more than 2 in any league game. They only conceded 3 goals in their FA Cup game against Bolton Wanderers. They won their 2nd title by 2 points from West Bromwich Albion. However, Town were left bewildered when Herbert Chapman left for Arsenal at the end of the season. ==Squad at the end of the season== ==Results== === Division One=== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center; font-size:smaller;\" |- style=\"background:#f0f6ff;\" !Date !Opponents !Home/ Away !Result F - A !Scorers !Attendance !Position |- bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |30 August 1924 |Newcastle United |A |3 - 1 |Brown, C.
