    "text": "Sadri, also known as Nagpuri, is an Eastern Indo-Aryan language spoken in the Indian states of Jharkhand, Bihar, Chhattisgarh Odisha and Assam. It is native language of the Sadan. In addition to native speakers, it is also used as lingua franca by many tribal groups such as Kharia, Munda and Kurukh, and a number of speakers of these tribal groups have adopted it as their first language. It is also used as a lingua franca among Tea-garden community of Assam, West Bengal and Bangladesh. According to the 2011 Census, there were approximately 5,130,000 native speakers of the Nagpuri language, including 19,100 identifying as Gawari, 4,350,000 as \"Sadan/Sadri\" and 763,000 as \"Nagpuria\". ==Etymology== The origin of Sadani/Sadri and other related terms is somewhat obscure. Probably the term \"Sadan\" derive from nisaada, referring to an ethnic group of North India. The name Nagpur is probably taken from Nagvanshi, who ruled in this part of the country.Sir John Houlton, Bihar, the Heart of India, pp. 127\u2013128, Orient Longmans, 1949. ==Classification== Nagpuri belongs to Bihari group of Indo-Aryan languages. There are different opinion among linguist about origin of Nagpuri language. Sir George Abraham Grierson had classified Nagpuri as dialect of Bhojpuri language in his Survey \"Linguistic Survey of India\". According to professor Keshri Kumar Singh, Nagpuri is descendant of Magadhi Prakrit in his book \"Nagpuri bhasa ebam Sahitya\". According to Dr. Sravan Kumar Goswami, Nagpuri had evolved from Ardhamagadhi Prakrit. It is sometimes considered a Hindi dialect. Some linguists also treat Chhattisgarhi and Sadri as dialects of Odia. ==Geographical Distribution== Nagpuri language is mainly spoken in western Chota Nagpur Plateau region of west-central Jharkhand in districts such as Chatra, Palamu, Latehar, Hazaribagh, Lohardaga, Gumla, Ranchi, Simdega, Khunti, West Singhbhum, North-east Chhattisgarh in district of Jashpur, Surguja, Balrampur, south-west Bihar in Aurangabad, Gaya district and Northern Odisha in Sundergarh district. It is also spoken by some Tea garden community in Tea garden area of Bangladesh, West Bengal and Assam who were taken as labourer to work in Tea garden during British Rule. ==Status== Historically Nagpuri was lingua-franca in the region. It was court language during reign of Nagvanshi dynasty. Nagpuri is accorded as second official language in Indian state of Jharkhand. There is demand to include Nagpuri in Eighth schedule. Some academics oppose inclusion of hindi dialects in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution as full-fledged Indian languages. According to them recogniton of hindi dialects as separate languages would deprive Hindi of millions of its speakers and eventually no hindi will be left. ==Literature== Literature in Nagpuri language started around 17th century. Nagvanshi king Raghunath Shah and King of Ramgarh, Dalel Singh were poet. Some Nagpuri peot were Hanuman Singh, Jaigovind Mishra, Barju Ram, Ghasiram Mahli, Das Mahli, Mahant Ghasi and Kanchan. \"Nagvanshavali\" written by Beniram Mehta is a historical work in Nagpuri language.
