The area was possibly settled originally by Celts, but was later taken over by the Romans, who called the town Cambodunum. Kempten is the oldest urban settlement (town) in Germany.History of Kempten == History == === Pre-Roman === The Greek geographer Strabo mentions in 50 BC a town of the Celtic Estiones named Kambodunon. This is considered the oldest written reference of any German city. So far no archaeological evidence could be found that this Celtic settlement really existed. === Roman era === In 15 BC Roman troops led by Nero Claudius Drusus and his brother Tiberius conquered and destroyed an existing Celtic settlement. Later the settlement was named Cambodunum. In the following years the city was rebuilt on a classical Roman city plan with baths, forum and temples. Initially in wood, the city was later rebuilt in stone after a devastating fire that destroyed almost the entire city in the year 69 AD. The city possibly served as provincial capital of Raetia during the first century before Augsburg took over this role. Extensive archaeological excavations at the end of the 19th century and again during the 1950s at what were then the outskirts of Kempten unearthed the extensive structural foundations. The city was again destroyed in 233 AD by the Alemanni, a Suebic tribe. The original site of Cambodunum was then abandoned and the settlement moved to a strategically safer location on the Burghalde hill overlooking the river Iller. In the middle of the 5th century the last Roman troops had left the area and the city was entirely taken over by the Alemanni. === Middle Ages === After the Romans abandoned the settlement, it was moved from the hill down to the plains located next to the river Iller. In written sources, the town appears as Cambidano. Being still predominantly Alemannic, the town once more was destroyed by the Franks in 683 as a consequence of the city's support of an uprising against the Frankish kingdom. Around 700 a monastery \u2014 Kempten Abbey \u2014 was built, the first in the Allg\u00e4u region, founded by two Benedictine monks from the Abbey of Saint Gall, Magnus von F\u00fcssen and Theodor. Audogar was the first abbot of the new Benedictine monastery. Through the financial and lobbyist support of Charlemagne\u2019s wife Hildegard, an Allemannic princess, the monastery managed to become one of the most privileged of the Frankish Empire. After several ravages by the Magyars, Ulrich of Augsburg, bishop of Augsburg and also abbot of Kempten, began the rebuilding of the monastery and the city in 941. In 1213, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II declared the abbots members of the Reichstag and granted the abbot the right to bear the title of Duke. However in 1289, King Rudolf I of Germany also granted special privileges to the urban settlement in the river valley, making it the Free Imperial City of Kempten. In 1525 the last property rights of the abbots in the Imperial City were sold in the so-called \"Great Purchase\", marking the start of the co- existence of two independent cities bearing the same name next to each other. More conflict arose after the Imperial City converted to Protestantism in direct opposition to the Catholic monastery (and Free City) in 1527. === Renaissance and Baroque to Modern Age === During the turmoil of the Thirty Years' War (1632\u201333), both cities were destroyed by the imperial forces and the Swedish troops respectively. In 16521652 \u2013 St Lorenz Basilika, Kempten, Bavaria, archiseek Roman Giel of Gielsberg, the Abbot of Kempten, commissioned the architects Michael Beer and Johann Serro from Graub\u00fcnden to build St. Lorenz Basilica as a new church to serve the parish and monastery, including a representative residence for the Duke-Abbots. This is acknowledged as the first large church built in Germany after the end of the Thirty Years' War. During the Napoleonic Wars the Duke-Abbey and Imperial City came under Bavarian rule (1802\u201303). Finally, in 1819, the two rival cities were united into a single communal entity. The city was the location of a subcamp of the Dachau concentration camp during World War II.List of subcamps of Dachau, Glosk.com Claude (Claudius) Honor\u00e9 Desir\u00e9 Dornier born in Kempten im Allg\u00e4u (May 14, 1884 - December 5, 1969) was a German aircraft engineer and founder of Dornier GmbH.
