The word became particularly famous during Soviet times because of the revolutionary poem \"Kamenyari\" (, plural of \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u0440), by Ukrainian poet Ivan Franko (1856\u20131916). In this poem, slaves bound by chains smash through rock using sledgehammers. The poem is allegorical, describing the twin ideas of liberation from an oppressive past (Polish, Russian and Austro-Hungarian rule of Ukraine) and of the laying down of a highway for future social progress by pioneers.The poem Kamenyari, translated into English as The Pioneers, The Ukrainian Weekly section in Svoboda, May 29, 1946, page 2Ivan Franko, the Poet of Western Ukraine: Selected Poems. / Translated with a biographical introduction by Percival Cundy.
