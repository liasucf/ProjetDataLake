She represented Alpes-Maritimes's 2nd constituency from 2002 to 2012 as a member of the Union for a Popular Movement. She was also a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). In this capacity she asked Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan a question about the protection of minorities in Turkey during his appearance before the PACE in April 2011 and drew a dismissing response from him. Later, she disclosed towards media that she could have Armenian origin. In a 2011 web interview, Marland-Militello declared that Philippe S\u00e9guin was her political mentor as well as Joan of Arc was her political key. On 18 February 2009, she signed a project of law in order to promote and protect the creation and diffusion of a public supply of Internet contents, in a particular way for educational purposes. On 22 July 2010, Laurent Joffrin published in Lib\u00e9ration a public political intervention of Marland-Militello, concerning the freedom and the professional deontology of the French press, as well the democratic need and the right to the media pluralism and independence. It recalled also the Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Journalists, which was signed 23\u201324 November 1971 in Munich by six Journalist's Unions of just as many EU countries.Compare the following translations: accountablejournalism.org with UK National Institute on Media and the Family ==References== Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:French people of Armenian descent Category:Criticisms of bullfighting Category:Union for a Popular Movement politicians Category:Women members of the National Assembly (France) Category:Deputies of the 12th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 13th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:21st-century French women politicians ",
