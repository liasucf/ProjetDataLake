    "text": "The Pipe Band Club is a competitive pipe band located in Sydney, Australia. The band was formed in 2008 and attended The World Pipe Band Championships in 2009 and 2010, competing in Grade 1. The band was led by Scott Nicolson until 2010 at which point Angus Roberts was elected Pipe Major. The band was the winner of the Australian Championship (Grade 1) in 2010, and has also consistently held the New South Wales state title since inauguration. In 2012 the band requested to be relegated to Grade 2 and this was approved by the Australian Pipe Band Association. The band won the 2014 Australian Championship in Grade 2, and went on to host the NSW Championships in November 2014, marking the first time the band had acted as a contest promoter. Still in Grade 2 in 2015, the band secured a win in the Queensland State Championships, then traveled to Scotland for a two-week tour ending with the World Championships in August 2015. The band took 2nd place in Grade 2 at North Berwick and 3rd place in Grade 2 at Perth. A week later, at the World Championships, the band took 2nd place in their heat before progressing and placing 9th in the final. ==References== Category:Australian marching bands ",
