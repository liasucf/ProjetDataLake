    "text": "Count was a statesman in Meiji period Japan. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the leading oligarch It\u014d Hirobumi .As cabinet secretary 1892-1898, he was a powerbroker between the oligarchy and the political powers in the Diet. He grew increasingly conservative and became a watchdog and defender of the constitution in his role as privy councillor, 1899-1934. Biographer George Akita calls him a political failure.George Akita, \"The Other It\u014d: A Political Failure.\" in Albert Craig, ed. Personality in Japanese History (1970): 335-72. ==Biography== It\u014d was born into a local samurai administrator's family in Nagasaki, Hizen Province (present-day Nagasaki Prefecture). From his early days, he showed a mastery of foreign languages. In the new Meiji government he worked as a translation official for Hy\u014dgo Prefecture specializing in English, and was later selected to accompany It\u014d Hirobumi (no relation--the Chinese characters for their names being different) to Europe in 1882 to investigate the constitutions and governmental structures of various European counties, with the aim of creating a constitution for Japan. After his return to Japan, he assisted Inoue Kowashi and Kaneko Kentar\u014d in drafting the Meiji Constitution, and was subsequently nominated to the House of Peers of the Diet of Japan. In 1892, he became Chief Cabinet Secretary in It\u014d Hirobumi's second administration, and in 1898, served as Minister of Agriculture and Commerce under the third It\u014d administration. At the same time, It\u014d Miyoji was also president of the pro-government newspaper, the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun (the predecessor to the modern Mainichi Shimbun). From 1899, It\u014d Miyoji served as a member of the Privy Council. In 1907, he was ennobled with the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system. He was further elevated to hakushaku (count) in 1922. In his later years, It\u014d was the bane of civilian government through his consistent and conservative use of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun to inflame public opinion. During the Sh\u014dwa financial crisis, he brought out the collapse of the administration of Prime Minister Wakatsuki Reijir\u014d through a virulent bad-press campaign. He also strongly criticized Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi for signing the London Naval Treaty on arms limitations as infringing on the direct prerogatives of the emperor. It\u014d died in 1934. His grave is at Tsukiji Hongan-ji in Tokyo. ==References and further reading== * Akita, George. \"The Other It\u014d: A Political Failure.\" in Albert Craig, ed.Personality in Japanese History (1970): 335-72. *Gordon, Andrew.
