Vrancea County's area is of 4,857 km\u00b2. A curvedly shaped mountainous area, known in Romanian as Carpa\u021bii de Curbur\u0103, lies in the western part of the county, at the Southern end of Eastern Carpathians, with heights over 1400 m. To the East, the heights decrease into hilly areas and the lower valley of Siret River. The main tributary of the Siret River, which crosses the county, is the Putna. The area is a seismically active one, with yearly earthquakes whose focal depths are between 80 and 160 km and therefore affect wide regions. The most notable is the 1977 Vrancea earthquake, which killed over 1500 people in Romania and Bulgaria. ===Neighbours=== *Vaslui County and Gala\u021bi County to the East. *Covasna County to the West. *Bac\u0103u County to the North. *Buz\u0103u County to the South and Br\u0103ila County to the South-East. ==Economy== Vineyards near Foc\u015fani, the seat of Vrancea County.
