    "text": "is a Japanese castle located in Maebashi, central Gunma Prefecture, Japan. At the end of the Edo period, Maebashi Castle was home to a branch of the Matsudaira clan, daimy\u014d of Maebashi Domain, although the castle was ruled by a large number of different clans over its history. The castle was also known as , after the former name of Maebashi. ==Location== Maebashi Castle is built on a steep river bank of the Tone River in the center for former K\u014dzuke Province. The location was a strategic junction of the main highway from Edo to Echigo Province and the Sea of Japan with the Nakasend\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. == History == ===Sengoku period=== A fortification called was built on banks of the Tone River near the site of the present castle in 1470 by the Nagano clan, retainers of the Uesugi clan who controlled the Kant\u014d region with the position of Kant\u014d Kanrei. However, the castle was damaged on several occasions by flooding of the Tone River. The Uesugi were defeated by the Odawara H\u014dj\u014d at the Battle of Kawagoe in 1546, around which time the Nagano clan defected to the H\u014dj\u014d side. However, the Hojo were driven out by Uesugi Kenshin in 1560, who expanded Ishikura castle into one of his seven main strongholds in the Kant\u014d area. The combined forces of the H\u014dj\u014d and Takeda clans recaptured the caste in 1562, but were unable to hold it. Kenshin gave the castle to Kitaj\u014d Takahiro, but in 1567 Kitaj\u014d defected to the H\u014dj\u014d clan, and later to the Takeda clan in 1579. When the Takeda clan was extinguished by Oda Nobunaga in 1582, the castle was awarded to Takigawa Kazumasu, who resided here for only three months until Nobunaga\u2019s assassination. The H\u014dj\u014d took the opportunity to recover the castle, but were themselves extinguished by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1590. ===Edo period=== After Tokugawa Ieyasu took control over the Kant\u014d region in 1590, he assigned Hiraiwa Chikayoshi , one of his most trusted generals, as castellan. However, in 1601, Sakai Shigetada was installed as daimy\u014d of Maebashi, initially with a kokudaka of 33,000 koku. The Sakai clan ruled over the next seven generations, completely rebuilding Maebashi Castle on higher ground with multiple baileys and a three-story tenshu. During the Sakai tenure, the revenues of the domain increased to 150,000 koku, prior to their transfer in 1749 to Himeji Domain. Maebashi was then given to a branch of the Matsudaira clan from Echizen Province, and Matsudaira Tomonori ruled from 1749 to 1767. However, erosion from the Tone River and flooding continued to plague the castle, and in 1767 Matsudaira Tomonori decided to relocate his seat from Maebashi to Kawagoe Castle, demoting Maebashi Domain to a detached territory of Kawagoe Domain. Towards the Bakumatsu period, the growing prosperity and economic importance of Maebashi due to the silk trade led to the local townspeople petitioning their lord for his return to Maebashi Castle. The Tokugawa shogunate also looked to the Maebashi area as a possible site a refuge should Edo be attacked by the western powers, and supported the move. A new Maebashi Castle was completed in 1866, and the Matsudaira clan relocated back to Maebashi in 1867. The tenshu of the new castle was located slightly further inland than before, and the outer walls were reconstructed with zigzag lines to avoid dead angles. This was the last Japanese castle to be constructed in the Edo period. ==Modern period== The Meiji Restoration commenced less than half a year after the new castle was completed. Most of its defensive structures were demolished by 1871, but the main palace was retained for use as the Gunma Prefectural Office until 1928. At present, the 33-story Gunma Prefectural Government Building is located on the site of the former tenshu. Maebashi City Hall occupies the former Second Bailey, and the Maebashi District Court occupies the Third Bailey, with much of the remaining area as a park. Only a small portion of the clay wall in the central bailey and third bailey remain in situ, and one of the original gates survives, albeit not in its original location. == Literature == * * * * ==External links== *Japancastle website Category:Castles in Gunma Prefecture Category:Maebashi Category:Historic Sites of Japan Category:Former castles in Japan ",
