    "text": "Xin Zhang is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical & Computer Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Materials Science & Engineering, and the Photonics Center at Boston University (BU). She also serves as Associate Director of the Boston University Nanotechnology Innovation Center and Director of both the National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site and the NSF Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Site in Integrated Nanomanufacturing at Boston University. She received her Ph.D. from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in Mechanical Engineering. Prior to joining BU, she was a Postdoctoral Researcher and then a Research Scientist with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Her research interests are in the broad areas of Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS or Microsystems) and Metamaterial (Acoustic, Electromagnetic, Nonlinear, Photonic, Terahertz, Tunable, etc.). Dr. Zhang is an Elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering (AIMBE), American Physical Society (APS), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), National Academy of Inventors (NAI), and The Optical Society (OSA), and Associate Fellow of American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). In 2016, she was selected as the recipient of the IEEE Sensors Council Technical Achievement Award (advanced career) for distinguished contributions to sensors and sensing technologies. In 2018, she was selected as the recipient of the Charles DeLisi Award and Distinguished Lecture, an honor recognizing faculty at Boston University who has made outstanding contributions to engineering and society. In 2018, her translational research has earned her Innovator of the Year award, bestowed annually by Boston University on a faculty member who \"translates his/her world-class research into inventions and innovations that benefit humankind.\" In 2019, she won the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) Innovation Award (Emerging Technology Design) in recognition of her work on magnetic metamaterials for improving MRI performance. \"The award celebrates the most pioneering engineering and technology innovations from energy and sustainability to transport and healthcare.\" In 2019, she has been named a 2019 Fellow of the National Academy of Inventors (NAI). \"Election to NAI Fellow status is the highest professional distinction accorded to academic inventors who have demonstrated a prolific spirit of innovation in creating or facilitating outstanding inventions that have made a tangible impact on quality of life, economic development, and the welfare of society.\" In 2019, she, along with her team, developed acoustic metamaterials that enable high-performance sound silencing and magnetic metamaterials that improve MRI performance. Both breakthroughs have drawn significant attention from the scientific community and the industry and the story has been picked up by 200+ media outlets, including AAU, All3DP, Archinect, ASME, AuntMinnie, Axis Imaging News, BBC, Boing Boing, Bold Business, BrightSurf, Built In Boston, Business Insider, CleanFuture, CN1699, CoolBusinessIdeas, Design & Development Today, Design News, Digital Trends, Discoveries News, Docwire News, DOTmed.com, Electronic Design, EurekAlert!, Fabbaloo, Fast Company, Firstpost, Future Science News, Future Tech News, Futurism, Futurity, Geek.com, Gizmodo, Healthcare-in- Europe, HealthImaging, Hearing Health Matters, Hearing Review, IMechE, Innovation Toronto, IOM3, La Opinion, Magnetics Magazine, Mashable, Materials Today, MDDI Online, Medgadget, Medical Design Briefs, Medical Design and Outsourcing, Medical Device Network, Medical Dialogues, MedicalExpo, Medical News, MedImaging.net, MedTechAsia, Microwaves & RF, Mirage News, Mother Nature Network, MPO Magazine, NanoApps Medical, Nanowerk, New Atlas, NextBigFuture, NIH, Phys.org, Physics Buzz, Physics News, Physics World, Pioneering Minds, Plastics le mag, Power Systems Design, Radiology Business, radRounds Radiology Network, ScienceAlert, Science Bulletin, Science Daily, Science News, Science Times, Science Trends, Scienmag, Science World Report, Scientific News, Scribd, Smithsonian Magazine, Tech Briefs, Tech Explorist, Tech The Lead, Tech Times, The Week Magazine, Thomas Insights, Tweakers, WBUR, WIRED, wordlessTech, 3ders.org, and 7thSpace. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:21st-century American engineers Category:Boston University faculty Category:Alumni of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Category:Fellows of the American Institute for Medical and Biological Engineering Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:Fellows of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:Fellows of the Optical Society Category:Institution of Engineering and Technology ",
