It is a classic and pioneering work on agrarian history in colonial Mexico, a point of departure for later studies of Mexican haciendas sparking a discussion on whether they were fundamentally feudal or capitalist. ==Education and career== Chevalier was a student of geography at the University of Grenoble (1933\u201336). He became a doctoral student of French historian Marc Bloch and developed interests in accord with the Annales School. During World War II, Chevalier was resident in Madrid at the Casa de Vel\u00e1zquez, with the aid of anthropologist Paul Rivet. In Spain, Chevalier began pursuing his interest in the agrarian history of Mexico using the Archivo General de Indias in Seville. Between 1946 and 1949 he was a fellow of the in Mexico City. During this period he developed his theory concerning the formation of the great landed estates (haciendas) in Mexico. This subject was developed in his doctoral dissertation, directed by Marc Bloch, which he completed in 1949. It was revised for publication in French by the in Paris (1952). Its publication was a major contribution to colonial Mexican history, but with some lacunae., Review, Hispanic American Historical Review vol. 33,, February 1953, 108-113 It was translated to Spanish and published in Mexico in 1956.A review by Woodrow Borah Hispanic American Historical Review Vol. 37, November 1957, 504-506. It was edited and translated to English by Alvin Eustin, with an introduction by Lesley Byrd Simpson and published in 1963 as Land and Society in Colonial Mexico: The Great Hacienda. One reviewer faults this English edition for its many omissions of the original French text and that the English translation is not faithful to the French original.Howard F. Cline, review Hispanic American Historical Review vol. 45, No. 3 (August 1965), pp. 480-482. Eric Van Young took Chevalier's work as a point of departure for a lengthy discussion of hacienda studies in Mexico.Eric Van Young, \"Mexican Rural History Since Chevalier: The Historiography of the Colonial Hacienda,\" Latin American Research Review, 18 (3) 1983; 5-62. Chevalier spent considerable time in Mexico. He had contacts with Mexican historians including Jos\u00e9 Miranda, , , and Moreno as well as intellectuals visiting Mexico, including Woodrow Borah, Marcel Bataillon, , and Claude Dumas. While in Mexico, Chevalier worked in the Archivo General de la Naci\u00f3n and in regional archives in Guadalajara, Zacatecas, Monterrey, and Puebla. He and his wife Josephe Chevalier frequently hosted meals and parties for friends and visitors. In a festschrift for Chevalier, an article is devoted to this aspect of his personal life.Mona Huerta and V\u00e9ronique H\u00e9bard, \u201cD\u2019une table a l\u2019autre: la sociabilit\u00e9 des Chevalier\u201d, in Sur Traces d\u2019un Mexicaniste Fran\u00e7ais.

He traveled extensively in Mexico, with some journeys on a Harley Davidson motorcycle that he rode in a suit and tie. He visited the isthmus of Tehuantepec, coast of Michoacan, and the highlands of Jalisco, as well as Veracruz, Puebla, Nayarit, and Aguascalientes. During his travels and researches, he accumulated a huge personal archive of photos and notes, which became the basis for his book Viajes y Pasiones.Fran\u00e7ois Chevalier, Viajes y pasiones, voyages et passions\u2026 Images et souvenirs du Mexique rural (with Javier P\u00e9rez Siller. Mexico: IFA- CEMCA-Fondo de Cultura 1998. He returned to France in 1962, where at the time there was little interest in Latin America. With the help of Hispanist , the Spanish literature department at the University of Bordeaux hired Chevalier. He taught courses on Mexico from the prehispanic period to the Mexican Revolution, especially emphasizing issues of land tenure. Between 1962 and 1966, he directed the Institute Fran\u00e7ais des \u00c9tudes Andines, traveling to the Andean countries frequently and he collected material for his personal archive-library.G\u00e9rard Borras, \u201cLe fonds Andin de la Bibliotheque Fran\u00e7ois Chevalier\u201d in Sur les traces d'un mexicaniste fran\u00e7ais: Constitution et analyse du fonds Fran\u00e7ois Chevalier. \u00c9ditions Karthala 2005, pp. 69-78 In 1969 he had a position at the University of Paris 1, Pantheon-Sorbonne, where he remained until his retirement in 1983. He had accumulated a huge personal library and archive of materials from Mexico and the Andes, which he donated in his 90s to the Centre de Recherche d\u2019Histoire de l\u2019Am\u00e9rique Latine et du Monde Ib\u00e9rique (CRALMI) de la Universit\u00e9 de Paris I (Panth\u00e9on- Sorbonne).V\u00e9ronique Hebrard (coord.).

He died in Paris on 6 June 2012. ==Impact of Chevalier\u2019s work== Chevalier's publication on the development of the great landed estate in colonial Mexico grew out of his doctoral dissertation under the direction of Marc Bloch. When it was published, it was recognized as a major contribution to Mexican history. Relatively few works in French at the time were translated to Spanish or English, but Chevalier's merited having a wide scholarly readership and was translated into both. Chevalier's publication built on earlier work by Mexican historians, such as Silvio Zavala, Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog, and others, but his book applied the model of the medieval landed estates in France, \u201cemphasizing the politico-institutional dimension highlighted by his own teacher, Marc Bloch.\"Eric Van Young, \u201cRural History,\u201d p. 330 fn. 9. Chevalier viewed the landed estate's development by elites was as much as anything a \u201cpsychological\u201d impetus, to show one's status whether or not the estate was profitable.Chevalier, La formation des grands domains au Mexique, p. 231. In 1983, Van Young wrote a major historiographical article taking Chevalier's work as the point of departure, saying that \u201cThirty years ago, Fran\u00e7ois Chevalier told us everything we had always wanted to hear about \"men rich and powerful\" and the classical Mexican hacienda... Chevalier, with his painstaking approach to masses of previously unexploited documentation, who brought the great hacienda down from the level of abstraction to that of historical reality.\u201dEric Van Young, \"Mexican Rural History Since Chevalier: The Historiography of the Colonial Hacienda,\" Latin American Research Review, 18 (3) 1983; 5-62. Quotation is on pp. 8-9. Chevalier\u2019s book set in motion scholarly activity investigating the hacienda in Mexico.

Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964. called for more research to test Chevalier\u2019s hypothesis that the hacienda was a basically feudal enterprise using debt peonage labor. Gibson\u2019s doctoral student William B. Taylor examined colonial Oaxaca land tenure patterns and showed that indigenous communities held significant amounts of land, a counter-example to patterns of the Catholic church and colonial elites\u2019 accumulation of land.William B.
