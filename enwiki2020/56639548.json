    "text": "The People's Alliance () is an electoral alliance in Turkey, established in February 2018 between the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the opposition Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). The alliance was formed to contest the 2018 general election, and brings together the political parties supporting the re-election of President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Its main rival is the Nation Alliance, which was originally created by four opposition parties in 2018 and was re-established in 2019. ==History== ===Background=== With the support of MHP votes in the Grand National Assembly, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan succeeded on passing the constitutional referendum in April 2017, which turn Turkey into a presidential system and would expand the executive power of the President of Turkey. Members of the MHP dissidents formed a new party, the new formed of the moderate conservative nationalist \u0130yi Party. Since the new party formed, both AKP and MHP fear to lose votes to a new nationalist party formed by former MHP members, which oppose the MHP decided to vote for support President Erdo\u011fan's constitutional amendment. As a result, the two parties agree to form a coalition. ===Formation=== The alliance has a joint presidential candidate, incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Each party is expected to nominate candidates for parliament separately. On 23 October 2018, after a series of public disagreements between the AKP and MHP, the MHP leader Devlet Bah\u00e7eli formally announced that his party would no longer seek to field joint candidates in prominent areas in the forthcoming March 2019 local elections. In response, Erdo\u011fan stressed that the two parties were fundamentally different, and must go their separate ways on issues they disagreed on. Public disagreements focussed on a general pardon for pro-MHP prisoners, as well as a court decision to annul the abolition of the Student Oath. The oath had been abolished during the Solution process by the AKP government in an attempt to appease Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) rebels, who regard its recital as racist. The court's decision to re-establish it was strongly supported by the MHP, while opposed by the AKP. However, both parties have stressed that they do not regard this as a dissolution of the alliance in the Turkish parliament and that the suspension of the electoral alliance for the local elections is only temporary. ==Composition== ===Founding members=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=3 | Name !

The parties most commonly mentioned as potential future members were the Great Unity Party (BBP) and the Felicity Party (SP). While the SP ruled out joining the alliance, the BBP entered talks to join. In early May 2018, the BBP ultimately joined the alliance on the lists of the AKP, while the Felicity Party instead aligned with the opposition Nation alliance led by the Republican People' Party. ===Supporting parties=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=3 | Name !
