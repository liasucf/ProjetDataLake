    "text": "Sunset Season is the debut extended play by American singer-songwriter and social media personality Conan Gray. It was released under Republic Records on November 16, 2018. Sunset Season was primarily produced by Dan Nigro and co- produced by Conan Gray, who also wrote and composed the five-track EP. Gray released \"Idle Town\", \"Generation Why\", and \"Crush Culture\" as singles. The album peaked at No. 2 on the US Heatseeker Albums chart, No. 116 on the Billboard 200 chart. == Background == Gray has cited Lorde's debut album, Pure Heroine, as a major inspiration for the EP because of its small-town nostalgia. In November 2019, Gray took to Twitter to celebrate the one year anniversary of the EP's release, stating \"can't even begin to explain how much these five songs changed my life, so i\u2019m not even going to try to. just. i'm happier now than i've ever been my whole entire life. so thank u.\" The tweet featured a screenshot of the EP's growth on Spotify, showing that it had gained over 145 million streams in one year. ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. * Conan Gray \u2013 vocalist , lyricist , producer , keyboard , additional vocals * Daniel Nigro \u2013 producer , bass , guitar , drum programming , mellotron , mixing *Rob Kinelski \u2013 mixing * Ryan Linvil \u2013 drum programming * Kate Brady \u2013 additional vocals * Yves Rothman \u2013 drum programming ==Track listing== All tracks are written by Conan Gray == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Download Albums (OCC) | 57 |} == References == Category:2018 debut EPs Category:Republic Records EPs Category:Conan Gray EPs ",
