The village is situated at the confluence of the Ruak River and the Mekong River which forms the tripoint border of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos. This location has enabled it to be marketed to tourists as the \"heart\" of the Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia), as the area is popularly known as. ==Location== The village clings along the west bank of the wide Mekong River and its smaller tributary, the Ruak River, with Laos and Myanmar lying across these rivers respectively. Behind the village are the forested hills of Chiang Saen. ==Transportation== The village is located along the Road 1290 which runs along the west bank of the Mekong River between Chiang Saen Town and Ban Sop Ruak before moving inland but running parallel to the Ruak River towards Mae Sai.

Ban Sop Ruak is the location of river border crossings into Laos and Myanmar. The crossing over the Mekong River to Laos is an international border crossing from the Chiang Saen Immigration Thailand-Laos Border Crossing Point located about 500 metres south of the Golden Triange Monument. The Laotian checkpoint is called the Sam Liam Kham (or Golden Triangle) International Checkpoint which is located in the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone in Bokeo Province.
