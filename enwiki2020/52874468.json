    "text": "The Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music was the Lifetime Achievement award given by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), an organisation which represents record companies and artists in the United Kingdom. The accolade is presented at the Brit Awards, an annual celebration of British and international music. The honourees are determined by the Brit Awards voting academy with over one-thousand members, which comprise record labels, publishers, managers, agents, media, and previous winners and nominees. The award was first presented in 1977 and was subsequently awarded annually from 1982 to 2010. The award has since been presented intermittently as the BRIT's Icon Award, with the original name being re-instated at the 2019 Brit Awards ceremony. Since 2000, the Classic BRIT Awards have also annually presented their own Outstanding Contribution to Music Award. The award was retired following the 2019 Brit Awards. Paul McCartney and John Lennon are the artists with the most wins with three awards. Pink is the first female solo artist and the first international artist to receive the BRIT award while Cecilia Bartoli and Andrea Bocelli are the first female soloist and international artist respectively to receive the Classic BRIT Award. ==Contemporary winners== Paul McCartney received the award in 1977, 1983 and 2008 1986, 1995 and 2014 honouree Elton John 1998 winners Fleetwood Mac Inaugural international winner Pink {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Recipient(s) |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1977 | LG Wood and The Beatles |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1982 | John Lennon |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1983 | The Beatles |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1984 | George Martin |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1985 | The Police |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1986 | Wham! and Elton John |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1987 | Eric Clapton |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1988 | The Who |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1989 | Cliff Richard |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1990 | Queen |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1991 | Status Quo |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1992 | Freddie Mercury |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1993 | Rod Stewart |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1994 | Van Morrison |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1995 | Elton John |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1996 | David Bowie |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1997 | Bee Gees |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1998 | Fleetwood Mac |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1999 | Eurythmics |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2000 | Spice Girls |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2001 | U2 |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2002 | Sting |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2003 | Tom Jones |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2004 | Duran Duran |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2005 | Bob Geldof |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2006 | Paul Weller |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2007 | Oasis |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2008 | Paul McCartney |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2009 | Pet Shop Boys |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2010 | Robbie Williams |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2012 | Blur |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2014 | Elton John |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2016 | David Bowie |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2017 | Robbie Williams |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2019 | Pink |} ==Classic winners== Inaugural winner Nigel Kennedy Composer John Williams received the award in 2012 {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Recipient |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2000 | Nigel Kennedy |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2001 | Simon Rattle |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2002 | Andrea Bocelli |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2003 | Cecilia Bartoli |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2004 | Ren\u00e9e Fleming |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2005 | James Galway |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2006 | Placido Domingo |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2007 | Vernon Handley |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2008 | Andrew Lloyd Webber |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2009 | Jos\u00e9 Carreras |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2010 | Kiri Te Kanawa |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2011 | John Barry |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2012 | John Williams |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2013 | Hans Zimmer |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2014 | Luciano Pavarotti |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2018 | Vera Lynn |- |} ==Artists with multiple wins== *John Lennon has received the award three times (1977 and 1983 as a member of The Beatles and 1982 as a solo artist) *Paul McCartney has received the award three times (1977 and 1983 as a member of The Beatles and 2008 as a solo artist) *Elton John has received the award three times (1986 and 1995 for Outstanding Contribution and 2014 as a BRIT's Icon) *The Beatles have received the award twice (1977 and 1983) *Freddie Mercury has received the award twice (1990 as a member of Queen and 1992 as a solo artist) *David Bowie has received the award twice (1996 for Outstanding Contribution and 2016 as a BRIT's Icon) *Robbie Williams has received the award twice (2010 for Outstanding Contribution and 2017 as a BRIT's Icon) ==Notes== * Paul McCartney (1986), Sting (2016) Also Receive American Music Award of Merit * Andrew Lloyd Webber (1990), Luciano Pavarotti (1998), Elton John (1999), Bee Gees (2003) Also Receive Grammy Legend Award * Paul McCartney (1990), John Lennon (1991), The Who (2001), David Bowie (2006), The Beatles (2014), Bee Gees (2015), Queen (2018) Also Receive Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award * The Beatles (1972), George Martin (1996) Also Receive Grammy Trustees Award * Luciano Pavarotti (1998), Elton John (2000), Sting (2004), Paul McCartney (2012), Fleetwood Mac (2018) Also Receive MusiCares Person of the Year * The Beatles (1984), David Bowie (1984), Pink (2017) Also Receive Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award ==References== Category:Brit Awards ",
