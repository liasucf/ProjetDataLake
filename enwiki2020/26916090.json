Former Quicksand bassist Sergio Vega played bass on the single as well as the entire Diamond Eyes album. ==Release== On March 3, 2010, Deftones posted the track listing for Diamond Eyes via their official website, and also announced that the next single, the album's title track, would be released for digital download on March 23.
