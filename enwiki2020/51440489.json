He served as Mayordomo mayor and lieutenant of King Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n on several occasions. In 1225 \u00c1lvaro P\u00e9rez de Castro, now in the service of the Muslim rules of Ja\u00e9n, participated with 160 Christian knights in the Successful defence of Ja\u00e9n against an army under Ferdinand III of Castile. After the siege, \u00c1lvaro P\u00e9rez de Castro negotiated a truce between Castile and Granada, sealed with the release of 1,300 Christian prisoners. This gained him the favour of Ferdinand of Castile. From then on he served Ferdinand of Castile, who entrusted him with the possession of the strengths of And\u00fajar and Martos and subsequently appointed him King's representative in the border fortresses of Andalusia and in the city of Cordoba, which he helped to conquer in 1236. He also commanded the Christian forces which defeated the Muslims at the Battle of Jerez, fought in 1231. == Marriages == He married for the first time in 1212 with Aurembiaix, future Countess of Urgel and the daughter of Count Ermengol VIII of Urgell, but the marriage was annulled in 1228. He married a second time with Menc\u00eda L\u00f3pez de Haro, future queen of Portugal, daughter of Lope D\u00edaz II de Haro, Lord of Vizcaya, and his wife Urraca Alfonso de Le\u00f3n, daughter of Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n.
