    "text": "Lil Peep; Part One (stylized LiL PEEP; PART ONE or often shortened to Part One) is the debut mixtape by American hip-hop recording artist Lil Peep. It was released September 18, 2015. The mixtape supported three singles: \"Veins\", \"Praying To The Sky\" and \"The Way I See Things\". == Background == Many people have put the 2015 single \"Star Shopping\", which was released around the same time as this mixtape, on the tracklist. However, it was not officially on the mixtape. An official music video was made for \"Nothing To U\". == Album cover == The album cover features a single purple Peeps candy, along with the old stamp of Schemaposse in the bottom left-hand corner of the cover. == Music and lyrics == In this project, Lil Peep expresses vulnerable themes of a severed relationship. Including: depression, drug addiction, ghosting, heartbreak and nihilism. All of which themes, are common with the emo rap genre he helped pioneer. His lyrics also commonly bring up his substance abuse. The single \"Praying To The Sky\", has been highlighted as depicting such themes very highly. Melanie Westfall from The Daily Texan, related the blend of emo and rap to the song. With lines such as, \"I found some Xanax in my bed/I took that shit went back to sleep/They gon\u2019 miss me when I\u2019m dead/I lay my head and rest in peace\". While alluding that \"there is a tendency in this genre to use self- medication for mental health issues\". On the song, Peep describes the drug abuse that he unfortunately failed victim to two years later. With the usage of the drug Xanax. Peep confirmed on Twitter that he was \"on acid\" when making the song. One of the most popular songs from the project, \"The Way I See Things\", gives a perspective on Peep's pessimistic feelings towards the life in which he was enduring in back in late 2015. Vocalizing lyrics such as: \"I got a feelin' that I'm not gonna be here for next year/So, let's laugh a little before I'm gone\". Eerily again while describing the usage of self- medication (that would soon consume the young man) he had used to cope his feelings: \"I\u2019ve been dreamin' of this shit for a while now/Got me high now\". The song gained a mainstream attraction, which soon helped Lil Peep garner a cult following along with songs like \"Star Shopping\" upon release. Having gained more than 30 million listens on SoundCloud. In \"Another Song\" Peep sings about having lost contact with a girl who he believes thinks he is ugly. This song samples vocals from an interview from 1993 with one of Peep's biggest influences, Kurt Cobain. Conducted with MTV, Cobain confessed to having thoughts of being suicidal at points. A direct correlation to the focus of the song, being an over-arcing theme of self-hatred. == Track listing == Sample notes * \"High School\" contains elements from the song, \"Tsunaida Te\" from Japanese group Lil'B. * \"Another Song\" contains elements from the song, \"The Farthest Land\" from the official soundtrack of the PlayStation 2 action- adventure game, Shadow of the Colossus.
