Whether he was part of their team that won the 1891\u201392 Football Alliance is uncertain, but he was a near ever present in their inaugural League season, making his Football League debut in Forest\u2019s first ever match at Everton in the First Division in September 1892. He was an ever present in his second and third seasons at the club, and the highlight of his career came when he won the 1898 FA Cup with Forest, as they beat local rivals Derby County 3\u20131 in the final at The Crystal Palace. However he lost his place in the first half of 1898\u201399, and whilst he returned in December to play in most of Forest\u2019s remaining fixtures that season, he made only one further appearance in 1899\u20131900, playing his last game of 201 in total (scoring 4 goals in the process) against Bury in November 1899. Whether through injury or another reason, he retired from the game and his movements after leaving The City Ground are uncertain. ==Career statistics== Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=8|Nottingham Forest |1892\u201393 |First Division |28||1||2||0||30||1 |- |1893\u201394 |First Division |30||1||4||0||34||1 |- |1894\u201395 |First Division |30||2||3||0||33||2 |- |1895\u201396 |First Division |26||0||1||0||27||0 |- |1896\u201397 |First Division |20||0||3||0||20||0 |- |1897\u201398 |First Division |25||0||6||0||31||0 |- |1898\u201399 |First Division |19||0||3||0||22||0 |- |1899\u20131900 |First Division |1||0||0||0||1||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career Total !179!!4!!22!!0!!201!!4 |} ==Honours== ; Nottingham Forest * FA Cup winner: 1898 ==References== Category:1871 births Category:date of death unknown Category:Scottish footballers Category:English Football League players Category:Association football defenders Category:Albion Rovers F.C. players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players ",
