    "text": "In a mixture between a dielectric and a metallic component, the conductivity \\sigma and the dielectric constant \\epsilon of this mixture show a critical behavior if the fraction of the metallic component reaches the percolation threshold. The behavior of the conductivity near this percolation threshold will show a smooth change over from the conductivity of the dielectric component to the conductivity of the metallic component and can be described using two critical exponents s and t, whereas the dielectric constant will diverge if the threshold is approached from either side. To include the frequency dependent behavior, a resistor-capacitor model (R-C model) is used. == Geometrical percolation== For describing such a mixture of a dielectric and a metallic component we use the model of bond-percolation. On a regular lattice, the bond between two nearest neighbors can either be occupied with probability p or not occupied with probability 1-p . There exists a critical value p_c . For occupation probabilities p > p_c an infinite cluster of the occupied bonds is formed. This value p_c is called the percolation threshold. The region near to this percolation threshold can be described by the two critical exponents u and \\beta (see Percolation critical exponents). With these critical exponents we have the correlation length, \\xi \\xi(p) \\propto (p_c - p)^{- u} and the percolation probability, P: P(p) \\propto (p - p_c)^{\\beta} ==Electrical percolation== For the description of the electrical percolation, we identify the occupied bonds of the bond-percolation model with the metallic component having a conductivity \\sigma_m . And the dielectric component with conductivity \\sigma_d corresponds to non-occupied bonds. We consider the two following well-known cases of a conductor-insulator mixture and a superconductor\u2013conductor mixture. ===Conductor-insulator mixture=== In the case of a conductor-insulator mixture we have \\sigma_d = 0 . This case describes the behaviour, if the percolation threshold is approached from above: \\sigma_{DC}(p) \\propto \\sigma_m (p - p_c)^t for p > p_c Below the percolation threshold we have no conductivity, because of the perfect insulator and just finite metallic clusters. The exponent t is one of the two critical exponents for electrical percolation. ===Superconductor\u2013conductor mixture=== In the other well-known case of a superconductor-conductor mixture we have \\sigma_m = \\infty . This case is useful for the description below the percolation threshold: \\sigma_{DC}(p) \\propto \\sigma_d (p_c - p) ^{-s} for p < p_c Now, above the percolation threshold the conductivity becomes infinite, because of the infinite superconducting clusters. And also we get the second critical exponent s for the electrical percolation. ===Conductivity near the percolation threshold=== In the region around the percolation threshold, the conductivity assumes a scaling form: \\sigma(p) \\propto \\sigma_m |\\Delta p|^t \\Phi_{\\pm} \\left(h|\\Delta p|^{-s-t}\\right) with \\Delta p \\equiv p - p_c and h \\equiv \\frac{\\sigma_d}{\\sigma_m} At the percolation threshold, the conductivity reaches the value: \\sigma_{DC}(p_c) \\propto \\sigma_m \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_d}{\\sigma_m}\\right)^u with u = \\frac{t}{t+s} ===Values for the critical exponents=== In different sources there exists some different values for the critical exponents s, t and u in 3 dimensions: {| |+ Values for the critical exponents in 3 dimensions ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | Efros et al. ! scope=\"col\" | Clerc et al. ! scope=\"col\" | Bergman et al. |- ! scope=\"row\" | t | 1,60 || 1,90 || 2,00 |- ! scope=\"row\" | s | 1,00 || 0,73 || 0,76 |- !scope=\"row\" | u | 0,62 || 0,72 || 0,72 |} ==Dielectric constant== The dielectric constant also shows a critical behavior near the percolation threshold. For the real part of the dielectric constant we have: \\epsilon_1(\\omega=0,p) = \\frac{\\epsilon_d}{|p-p_c|^s} ==The R-C model== Within the R-C model, the bonds in the percolation model are represented by pure resistors with conductivity \\sigma_m = 1/R for the occupied bonds and by perfect capacitors with conductivity \\sigma_d = i C \\omega (where \\omega represents the angular frequency) for the non-occupied bonds. Now the scaling law takes the form: \\sigma(p, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{R} |\\Delta p|^t \\Phi_{\\pm} \\left(\\frac{ i \\omega}{\\omega_0}|\\Delta p|^{-(s+t)}\\right) This scaling law contains a purely imaginary scaling variable and a critical time scale \\tau^* = \\frac{1}{\\omega_0}|\\Delta p|^{-(s+t)} which diverges if the percolation threshold is approached from above as well as from below. == Conductivity for dense networks == For a dense network, the concepts of percolation are not directly applicable and the effective resistance is calculated in terms of geometrical properties of network. Assuming, edge length << electrode spacing and edges to be uniformly distributed, the potential can be considered to drop uniformly from one electrode to another. Sheet resistance of such a random network (R_{sn}) can be written in terms of edge (wire) density (N_E), resistivity (\\rho), width (w) and thickness (t) of edges (wires) as: R_{sn}\\,=\\,\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{\\rho}{w\\,t\\,\\sqrt{N_E}}\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, ==References== ==See also== * Percolation theory Category:Critical phenomena ",
