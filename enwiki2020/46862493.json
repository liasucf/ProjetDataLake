He competed with the club in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n and Tercera Divisi\u00f3n, scoring an all-time best 159 goals in 259 games all competitions comprised even though he was not a pure striker. Having studied in his youth to be a priest, Polo was known in Argentina as the black shadow of Am\u00e9rico Tesoriere, as he was the only European player capable of scoring against him. In a game against Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a, he converted a penalty kick with a broken fibula. Polo retired in 1935 at the age of 34, going on to manage SG Lucense in the second level in the early 50s. He died on 19 June 1966, aged 65. ==International career== Polo gained two caps for Spain during seven years, in as many friendlies. His debut took place on 4 October 1925, in a 1\u20130 win over Hungary in Budapest. ==References== ==External links== * * * *Spain stats at Eu-Football Category:1901 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Galician sportspeople Category:Spanish footballers Category:Galician footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:RC Celta de Vigo players Category:Spain B international footballers Category:Spain international footballers Category:Spanish football managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n managers Category:CD Lugo managers ",
