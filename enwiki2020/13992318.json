    "text": "Deathcar on a VinylDisc The VinylDisc is a combination of a digital layer, either in CD or DVD format, and an analog layer, which is a vinyl record, developed by the German company Optimal Media Production. It consists of a silver layer containing CD or DVD and a black polyvinyl chloride layer (able to hold 3.5 minutes of audio on 33\u2153 rpm) which can be played on a regular phonograph. Examples of singles already released in the hybrid format are Paramore's \"Misery Business\", The Mars Volta's cover of \"Candy and a Currant Bun\" by Pink Floyd, the 2017 album \"Hyakki Echo\" by Merzbow and Fightstar's \"Deathcar\" which reportedly had a limited run of 3000 copies. A sample VinylDisc to promote this new format was given to visitors of the 2007 Popkomm, containing music by Jazzanova, where it was presented in September 2007. == References == *Optimal Media Production: CD. *Optimal Media Production: News | Optimal presents a special product at Popkomm: the VinylDisc. == External links == * Techmoan: Vinyl-Disc - Vinyl & CD combined (YouTube) 27 January 2017 * VinylDisc in Museum Of Obsolete Media Category:Audio storage ",
