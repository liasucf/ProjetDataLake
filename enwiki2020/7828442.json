In 2015, he was inducted into the Texas Tech Athletic Hall of Fame. ==Professional career== ===Dallas Cowboys=== Elliott was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1992 NFL Draft, to compete as the replacement for kicker Ken Willis. He recovered from a pulled groin muscle in training camp, to be named the starter over Brad Daluiso. He started the regular season slowly until hitting 13 straight field goals and registering 27 touchbacks, which at the time were both franchise records. His 24 field goals were a rookie record and third in club history. His 3 field goals over 50 yards in a single-season ranked second in franchise history. His 119 points set a team rookie record, while ranking fourth in the NFL and leading all rookies. He was part of the Super Bowl XXVII winning team. In 1993, he only made 6-of-13 field goals (46.15%) in preseason. He missed an extra point attempt in the season opener against the Washington Redskins. He missed two field goals in the 10-13 loss against the Buffalo Bills in the second game, contributing to a 0\u20132 start. On September 14, he was released and replaced with Eddie Murray. ===Kansas City Chiefs=== On April 7, 1994, he signed as a free agent with the Kansas City Chiefs, after Nick Lowery was released in a salary-cap move. He registered 25-of-30 field goals (83.3%). In 1995, he made 24 of 30 field goals (80%), contributing to the team going 13\u20133 in the regular season and clinching home field advantage throughout the playoffs, making them heavy favorites.

He suffered a late-season swoon, as his final miss against the Colts was his ninth missed kick in five games. On February 16, 1996, the Chiefs decided not to make him a qualifying offer as a restricted free agent, effectively releasing him, even though he had an 81.7% field goal accuracy during his two seasons, ranking as the second-most accurate kicker in Chiefs history. ===Minnesota Vikings=== On August 1, 1996, he signed with the Minnesota Vikings as a free agent. He was released before the season started on August 20. ==Personal life== Elliott is now an investment manager with Texas Farm Bureau in Waco, Texas. ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:American football placekickers Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:Kansas City Chiefs players Category:People from Euless, Texas Category:Players of American football from Texas Category:Sportspeople from the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex Category:Super Bowl champions Category:Texas Tech Red Raiders football players Category:Waco High School alumni ",
