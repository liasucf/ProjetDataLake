In that role, Willens worked with the lawyers and agents conducting the investigation of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, reviewed the lawyers\u2019 memoranda for submission to members of the commission, and edited the material that became the Report of the commission. His book, History Will Prove Us Right: Inside the Warren Commission Report on the Assassination of John F.

Willens was born in Oak Park, Ill., on May 27, 1931. He received his Bachelor's degree, with high distinction, from the University of Michigan in 1953 and his Bachelor of Laws in 1956 from Yale Law School where he was an editor on the Yale Law Journal.\u201cThe Warren Commission Report: The President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy\u201d, 1964 p. 479 Willens then served in the U.S. Army from 1956 to 1958 at Fort Lewis, Washington.\"Howard P. Willens, Esq., Presented with the Albert Nelson Marquis Lifetime Achievement Award\" ==Early career== In late 1958, Willens joined the law firm of Kirkland, Ellis, Hodson, Chaffetz & Masters in Washington, D.C. At that time, the U.S. Senate's McClellan Committee was engaged in public hearings led by Robert F. Kennedy concerning the influence of organized crime in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) and possible criminal conduct by the IBT president, Jimmy Hoffa. Separately, a lawsuit filed in 1957 by dissident union members resulted in a consent decree requiring Hoffa and other IBT officials to address evidence of corruption.Cunningham v. English 175 F. Supp. 764 (D.D.C. 1958), aff'd, 269 F.2d 517 (D.C. Cir. 1959), aff'd as modified, 269 F.2d 539 (D.C. Cir. 1959), cert. denied, 361 U.S. 905 (1959) The court created a three-member Board of Monitors to supervise and enforce the implementation of the consent decree.Michael J. Goldberg, \u201cCleaning Labor's House: Institutional Reform Litigation in the Labor Movement,\u201d Duke Law Journal (Sept. 1989), pp. 985-86 In 1960, the Board of Monitors hired Kirkland Ellis to handle several disputes between the Board and the IBT concerning the union's compliance with the consent decree.Michael J. Goldberg, \u201cCleaning Labor's House\u201d pp. 986-88 Willens joined a team of lawyers headed by Herbert J. (\u201cJack\u201d) Miller, Jr. to investigate various allegations against Hoffa relating to the disappearance of IBT records and the misuse of union funds.Hoffa v. Letts, 284 F.2d 283 (D.C. Cir. 1960); Dorsey v. Cunningham, 282 F.2d 842 (D.C. Cir. 1960) Following President Kennedy's election, Robert Kennedy was appointed Attorney General in 1961. He selected Jack Miller to serve as head of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, and Willens became Second Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division.The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza They hired more lawyers to handle several investigations of Hoffa that were already underway in the Justice Department based on information collected by the McClellan Committee and the FBI. These investigations resulted in several indictments against Hoffa and his affiliates.Some of It Was Fun: Working with RFK and LBJ\u2019\u2019 Nicholas Katzenbach, 2008, p. 98In Hoffa's Shadow: A Stepfather, a Disappearance in Detroit, and My Search for the Truth\u2019\u2019 Jack Goldsmith, Farrar, Strauss and Giroux (2019). When Justice Department lawyers learned that Hoffa attempted to tamper with the jury in one of those cases, Robert Kennedy sent Willens to Tennessee to handle the Government's response. Hoffa was convicted of jury tampering in 1964 and sentenced to eight years in prison. When Hoffa appealed his conviction to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, Willens represented the Government and obtained an order affirming the conviction in 1965.U.S. v. Hoffa 349 F.2d 20 (6th Cir. 1965) ==Warren Commission== On November 29, 1963, one week after President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed a seven-member commission headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren to conduct the federal government's investigation. Willens participated in early meetings inside the Justice Department concerning the law-enforcement response to the assassination. On December 5, he obtained one of the few copies of the FBI's preliminary report identifying Lee Harvey Oswald as the likely assassin, and prepared a summary noting critical errors in the FBI's work.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 27-28 On December 17, Willens was assigned by Nicholas Katzenbach to join the staff of the Warren Commission, reporting to the chief counsel, Lee Rankin. Willens worked full-time on the commission's investigation until its report was issued on September 24, 1964. In the early days, his work focused on hiring lawyers and investigators; gathering and reviewing the records collected by the FBI and local police concerning the assassination; and preparing a rough outline of topics to be investigated and reported to the commission. Willens personally recruited several lawyers to join the staff, including Arlen Specter.Some of It Was Fun: Working with RFK and LBJ\u2019\u2019 Nicholas Katzenbach, 2008, p. 135Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 37-39 Rankin assigned a team of two lawyers to each of the major areas for investigation. Willens observed the first meeting of the newly hired staff January 13, 1964, and reported: \u201cThe lawyers were enthusiastic about their assignments, eager to get to work, and determined to ferret out whatever conspiracy might have led to the assassination and the murder of Oswald.\u201dWillens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 43-45 Rankin assigned Willens to coordinate the work of the investigative teams and to assist their communication with other agencies. Willens worked closely with Norman Redlich to monitor the progress of the teams and edit their interim reports. He also acted as a liaison between the Commission and the Justice Department, providing frequent informal updates to Miller and Katzenbach.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 46, 84 Willens reports in his book that the commission's attorneys knew from the beginning of the investigation that the FBI had made serious errors in its initial report of the assassination.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, p. 28 As the investigation continued, it became clear that the FBI was withholding important information about Oswald. Among other things, the FBI misled the Commission concerning its surveillance of Oswald in Dallas and New Orleans before the assassination, and failed to disclose Oswald's encounter with FBI Agent James Hosty. Further, in an act of \u201cinexcusable dishonesty,\u201d Hoover concealed from the commission his own decision to discipline Hosty and 16 other FBI agents for their failure to identify Oswald as a security risk and to inform the Secret Service before the president's arrival in Dallas.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 79, 119, 155 Willens notes that later investigations examined the hidden FBI evidence \u201cand no facts have come to light that challenge our fundamental conclusions regarding the identity of the assassin and the absence of any conspiracy.\u201dWillens, History Will Prove Us Right, p. 294 From the outset of the investigation, the commission's lawyers believed that evidence of a conspiracy was most likely to be found in Mexico, where Oswald traveled in September 1963. In April 1964, Willens went to Mexico to meet with FBI and CIA agents and to speak to witnesses concerning Oswald's interactions with Soviet and Cuban personnel in Mexico City. The agents indicated that Oswald's activities in Mexico were limited to efforts to obtain visas for travel through Cuba to the Soviet Union, and no evidence suggested that his visit was related to President Kennedy.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 121-27, 134 In his book, Willens describes the genesis of the single-bullet theory in informal meetings of the commission attorneys as they tried to determine the number of bullets fired at the presidential car and who was hit by each bullet. One attorney, David Belin, focused his efforts on trying to prove that a second shooter had participated in the assassination, but detailed work by the FBI and analysis of the Zapruder film suggested that all of the shots that hit President Kennedy and Governor Connally originated from Oswald's position in the book depository. Based on that work, the staff lawyers decided to test the hypotheses that the first bullet to hit the president also caused Connally's wounds.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 85-87 Over the objection of the FBI and Secret Service, they organized a reenactment of the shooting in Dallas on May 24, 1964. The reenactment \u201cproduced convincing evidence\u201d supporting the single-bullet theory, and that evidence was confirmed by expert review of the medical and ballistics evidence.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 166-68 However, because Gov. Connally testified that he was hit by the second bullet \u2013 not the first bullet that hit the president \u2013 the Commission decided not to take a position on the single-bullet theory. Instead, the Commission concluded that \u201cthere is no question\u201d that all of the shots were fired from the sixth floor of the book depository.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 270 At Warren's request, Willens prepared a draft outline of the commission's report on March 31, 1964. Thereafter, Willens, Redlich and Rankin shared the work of reviewing and editing each section of the report. Willens writes that their goal was to present the facts \u201cin a way that would persuade readers that our investigation was sufficiently thorough that the conclusion finding no credible evidence of a conspiracy was a fair and reasonable one.\u201dWillens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 108, 210, 249 The Commission delivered the report to the president on September 24, 1964, and released it to the public on September 27.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 288 ==President Johnson\u2019s Crime Commission== In August 1965, Willens left the Department of Justice to serve as executive director of the President's Commission on Crime in the District of Columbia.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 298 On December 31, 1966, the Commission released a 1,041-page report that recommended a series of reforms to address rapidly rising crime rates in the District, including gun control legislation, reorganization of the police department, speedier handling of criminal cases and changes to bail laws. The commission noted that the District's low-income community faced unemployment, racial segregation, poor education and vocational training, all of which contributed to crime. Report of the President\u2019s Commission on Crime in the District of Columbia, U.S. Government Printing Office (1966) ==1968 Democratic National Convention== Willens was a member of the delegation representing the District of Columbia at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August 1968.District of Columbia Board of Elections, Election Law in the District of Columbia and a History of District of Columbia Elections, pp. 41-44 (1971) Members of the delegation were originally pledged to Robert F. Kennedy, but Kennedy was assassinated in June 1968. Following his death, the delegation voted to nominate Rev. Channing E. Phillips, a Baptist minister and activist who was the leader of the delegation. Rev. Phillips became the first African-American to be nominated for president by a major party. ==Private Practice== In 1967, Willens joined the law firm then known as Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering in Washington, D.C. His major clients included the Ford Motor Company, Educational Testing Service and the Northern Mariana Islands. He retired from the law firm in 1995.Willens, History Will Prove Us Right, pp. 303Records and Briefs of the United States Supreme Court ==Northern Mariana Islands== Beginning in December 1972, Willens represented the Marianas Political Status Commission in negotiations with the United States. The negotiations resulted in an agreement in 1976 entitled the \u201cCovenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America.\u201dAn Honorable Accord, The Covenant between the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States, Willens & Siemer, Center for Pacific Islands Studies, School of Hawaiian, Asian, and Pacific Studies, University of Hawaii (2002), p. xiii As Willens stated, when President Ford signed legislation adopting the Covenant on March 24, 1976, \u201c[t]he fourteen thousand citizens of the Marianas had successfully exercised their right of self-determination. Against all odds, they accomplished what no people preceding them had ever done \u2013 they joined the United States voluntarily on terms they had negotiated and approved.\u201dWillens & Siemer, An Honorable Accord, p. 343 Working with his colleague and co-author, Deanne C. Siemer, Willens served as counsel for the First Constitutional Convention from 1976 to 1977. The resulting constitution has been in effect in the Northern Mariana Islands since January 1978.Willens & Siemer, An Honorable Accord, p. xiii Thereafter, Willens and Siemer represented the Commonwealth in a series of legal challenges to key provisions of the Covenant. Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands v. U.S., 670 F. Supp.2d 65 (D.D.C., 2009)U.S. ex Rel. Richards v. De Leon Guerrero, 4 F.3d 749 (9th Cir. 1993) ==Later career== After leaving Wilmer Cutler in 1995, Willens published three books concerning American foreign policy in the Pacific and the efforts of the people of the Northern Marianas to join the United States. Willens and Siemer engaged in a five-year legal battle with the U.S. Department of Justice to obtain documents under the Freedom of Information Act, resulting in the disclosure of approximately 70,000 pages of internal agency records.Willens v. National Sec. Council, 726 F. Supp. 325 (D.D.C., 1989) Based on these records and other sources, Willens and Siemer wrote National Security and Self-Determination: United States Policy in Micronesia, 1961-72 (2000) and An Honorable Accord, The Covenant between the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States (2002). With Dirk Ballendorf, Willens wrote The Secret Guam Study: How President Ford\u2019s Approval of Commonwealth Was Blocked by Federal Officials in 2005. For the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy assassination, Willens wrote History Will Prove Us Right in 2013. The book is based in part on contemporaneous journals and correspondence that had not been previously disclosed. In later years, Willens participated in lectures and panel discussions concerning the assassination, subsequent investigations and conspiracy theories.\u201cDecades Later, Yale Law School Graduates Remember Investigation into JFK\u2019s Assassination,\u201d Yale Law Report, Dec. 2019, pp. 46-49\u201cConflicting Conclusions: The Government Assassination Investigations,\u2019 The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, Oct. 29, 2018. ==Publications== *Willens & Siemer, National Security and Self-Determination: United States Policy in Micronesia, 1961\u201372, ABC-CLIO, 2000.National Security and Self- Determination *Willens & Siemer, An Honorable Accord, The Covenant between the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States, University of Hawaii Press, 2002.An Honorable Accord *Willens & Ballendorf, The Secret Guam Study: How President Ford's 1975 Approval of Commonwealth was Blocked by Federal Officials, University of Guam Press, 2005.The Secret Guam Study *Willens, History Will Prove Us Right: Inside the Warren Commission Report on the Assassination of John F.
