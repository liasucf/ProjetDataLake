    "text": "Sage Moonblood Stallone (May 5, 1976 \u2013 July 13, 2012) was an American actor, film director, producer, and distributor. He was the elder son of actor Sylvester Stallone. ==Early life== Sage Stallone was born in Los Angeles, California, the elder son and first child of Sasha Czack and actor Sylvester Stallone. He was the brother of Seargeoh \"Seth\" Stallone, and half-brother of Sophia, Sistine, and Scarlet Stallone. He was the nephew of actor and singer Frank Stallone, and grandson of Jackie Stallone. His stepmother was model and entrepreneur Jennifer Flavin. Stallone attended Montclair College Preparatory School in Van Nuys, California, where he graduated in 1993. From 1994 to 1995, he studied filmmaking at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. ==Career== As a child, Stallone made a guest appearance on Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling, brought by his grandmother Jackie Stallone, who promoted the series. Stallone made his acting debut alongside his father Sylvester Stallone in Rocky V (1990), the fifth installment of the Rocky franchise, playing Robert Balboa Jr., the onscreen son of his father's title character. He did not, however, reprise the same role in Rocky Balboa, the sixth installment of the Rocky films as he was working on his own film Vic. He also appeared with his father in Daylight (1996). After that, he acted in lesser profile films. In 1996, Stallone and film editor Bob Murawski co-founded Grindhouse Releasing, a Los Angeles-based company dedicated to the restoration and preservation of exploitation films and B-movies. Stallone directed his first short film (outside of film school), Vic, which won the 2006 Boston Film Festival \"Best New Filmmaker\" award. His last projects were appearances in Vincent Gallo's last two films, Promises Written in Water and The Agent. Both films were shown in main competition at the 2010 Venice Film Festival and in the Toronto International Film Festival. A photograph of Stallone as a young child beside his father appears in the 2015 Creed, where it is stated that his character, Robert Balboa Jr., has since moved away to Vancouver. ==Death== Stallone was found dead on July 13, 2012, at his home in the 8100 block of Mulholland Terrace in Studio City, Los Angeles. According to reports, he had not been heard from for four days prior to his death. Empty prescription drug bottles were found at the scene, but after an autopsy and toxicology tests, the Los Angeles coroner determined that Sage died of coronary artery disease caused by atherosclerosis, with no drugs detected other than an over-the- counter pain remedy.http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/30/showbiz/sage-stallone-death/ At the time of his death, Stallone was reportedly engaged. Stallone's funeral was held on July 21 at St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church in Los Angeles. He is interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year ! Title !
