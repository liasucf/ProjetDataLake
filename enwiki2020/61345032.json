He is preparing for the Polytechnique exam in the preparatory class of the Louis-le-Grand high school. After a few months of special mathematics class he decided to change his orientation by choosing medicine. He is Jean Hamburger's student at Necker Hospital. He received his doctorate in medicine in 1969 and in science in 1970. His science thesis gives rise to three articles in Nature.\u00ab Interview de Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bach \u00bb, sur sur histoire.inserm.fr (consult\u00e9 le 18 avril 2018) Correspondant in 1977, he was elected in 1985 as a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, where he was one of the two Secr\u00e9taires perp\u00e9tuels from 2006 to 2015.

His personal work concerns more particularly the study of subpopulations of T lymphocytes related to thymus activity; the characterization of thymic hormones and in particular thymulin, which he synthesizes; the action of immunosuppressants (cyclosporin, antilymphocyte sera, monoclonal antibodies against Tlymphocytes). He has been interested in the mechanisms and treatments of autoimmune diseases and more specifically insulin-dependent diabetes. He played a decisive role in the implementation of treatments for this disease with ciclosporin and, more recently, with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies. Finally, he showed that the decrease in the frequency of infections in developed countries explained the increase in the incidence of autoimmune diseases (hygienist theory). == Awards and distinctions == Among other awards and honours: * Grand Prize of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences (Jaff\u00e9 Prize) (1976) * European Society of Clinical Investigation Award (1976) * Gold medal of the European Society of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (1978) * Prix du rayonnement fran\u00e7ais (1981) * Member of the Acad\u00e9mie nationale de M\u00e9decine (elected in 1990) * Member of the Acad\u00e9mie nationale de Pharmacie (elected in 1990) * Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier Prize from the University of California (1993) * Member of the Royal Belgian Academy of Medicine (elected in 1994) * Prize of the Institute of Health Sciences (1998) * Barbara Davis Prize from the University of Colorado (2000) * Member of the British Academy of Medical Sciences (elected in 2006) He is also: * Commandeur of the Ordre of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur * Commandeur of the Ordre National du M\u00e9rite == Notes and references == Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences Category:French immunologists Category:French physicians Category:Commanders of the National Order of Merit (France) Category:Commandeurs of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur Category:1940 births Category:Living people ",
