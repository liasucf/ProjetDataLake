    "text": "Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart (24 March 1739 \u2013 10 October 1791), was a German poet, organist, composer, and journalist. He was repeatedly punished for his social-critical writing and spent ten years in severe conditions in jail. ==Life== Born at Obersontheim in Swabia, he entered the University of Erlangen in 1758 as a student of theology. He led a dissolute life, and after two years' stay was summoned home by his parents. After attempting to earn a livelihood as private tutor and as assistant preacher, his musical talents gained him the appointment of organist in Geislingen an der Steige. Meeting Schubart in Ludwigsburg in 1772, Charles Burney called him \"the first, real great harpsichord player that I had hitherto met with in Germany ... He is formed on the Bach school; but is an enthusiast, and original in genius. Many of his pieces are printed in Holland; they are full of taste and fire. He played on the Clavichord, with great delicacy and expression; his finger is brilliant, and fancy rich.\"Charles Burney, (1773) The Present State of Music in Germany, the Netherlands and United Provinces, London, T. Becket and Co., Robson and G. Robinson. Schubart was unappreciated in Ludwigsburg, according to Burney: \"The common people think him mad, and the rest overlook him.\" As a consequence of his wild life and blasphemy, found expressed in a parody of the litany, he was later expelled from the country. He then visited in turn Heilbronn, Mannheim, Munich and Augsburg. In Augsburg, he made a considerable stay, began his ' (German Chronicle, 1774\u20131778) and eked out a subsistence by reciting from the latest works of prominent poets. In 1775, Schubart witnessed a piano playing competition in Munich between Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Franz Ignaz von Beecke. He wrote in his Teutsche Chronik (27 April 1775) that in his opinion, von Beecke played far better than Mozart: \"In Munich... I heard two of the greatest clavier players, Mr Mozart and Captain von Beecke. Mozart\u2019s playing had great weight, and he read at sight everything that we put before him. But no more than that; Beecke surpasses him by a long way. Winged agility, grace and melting sweetness.\" John Irving: Mozart Piano Sonatas: Contexts, Sources, Style. Cambridge University Press 1997, , page 56 Owing to a bitter attack upon the Jesuits, he was expelled from Augsburg and fled to Ulm, where he was arrested in 1777 and confined in the fortress of Hohenasperg. Here he met with lenient treatment, and he spent the time by a study of mystical works and in composing poetry. His ' (Complete Poems) appeared in two volumes at Stuttgart in 1785/1786 (new edition by Gustav Hauff, Leipzig, 1884, in Reclams Universal-Bibliothek); in this collection most of the pieces are characterized by the \"Sturm und Drang\" period. One of the poems he wrote there and published in the Schw\u00e4bischer Musenalmanach in 1783 was \"Die Forelle\", set to music by Franz Schubert in 1817. He was set free in 1787 by Frederick the Great, king of Prussia, and expressed his gratitude in \"\" (\"Hymn to Frederick the Great\"). Schubart was now appointed musical director and manager of the theatre at Stuttgart, where he continued his ' and began his autobiography, ' (\"Schubart's Life and Thoughts\", 2 vols, 1791\u20131793), but he died before its completion in Stuttgart. His ' (Collected Writings and Fates) appeared in 8 volumes (Stuttgart, 1839\u20131840). Among Schubart's musical works are the operetta ', the melodrama ', three books of ' (1786), a \"Salve Regina\", and various songs and keyboard pieces. ==Sources== *Charles Burney, The Present State of Music in Germany, the Netherlands and United Provinces (1773) *Daniel Friedrich Strauss, ' (2 volumes, 1849; 2nd ed., 1878) *Gustav Hauff, Christian Daniel Schubart (1885) *, ' (1888) ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Ideen zu einer Aesthetik der Tonkunst, Vienna, 1806 (excerpts) * Schubart Museum in Aalen (Exhibit on his life and work) * Der Bettelsoldat (mp3) - Free audio book. * The organ und church where Schubart worked as a young man * Information from the Schubart Quintet * * Category:1739 births Category:1791 deaths Category:German poets Category:People from Ludwigsburg Category:Sturm und Drang Category:German classical organists Category:German male organists Category:German classical composers Category:German male classical composers Category:German male poets Category:German male novelists Category:German male dramatists and playwrights Category:18th-century German dramatists and playwrights Category:18th-century classical composers Category:18th-century keyboardists Category:18th-century German composers Category:18th-century male musicians ",
