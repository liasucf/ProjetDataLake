Nastos stated \"The Song Is You is a missing link between a less than successful teaming with Bill Evans, and the more modern quartet music Getz played thereafter with Corea, Jimmy Rowles, Joanne Brackeen, or Kenny Barron. It's a very worthwhile item to own if you search for it, well recorded and performed by a group that could collectively be the most purely talented of any you might find who ever backed up Stan Getz\". ==Track listing== # \"The Song Is You\" (Jerome Kern, Oscar Hammerstein II) - 5:51 # \"O Grande Amor\" (Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim, Vin\u00edcius de Moraes) - 6:02 # \"For Jane\" (Jack DeJohnette) - 3:22 # \"Dane's Chant\" (Stanley Cowell) - 7:36 # \"Major General\" (DeJohnette) - 6:32 # \"Folk Tune for Bass\" (Miroslav Vitous) - 5:10 # \"Tonight I Shall Sleep/Desafinado\" (Duke Ellington, Irving Gordon/Jobim, Newton Mendon\u00e7a) - 13:08 # \"All the Things You Are\" (Kern, Hammerstein) - 6:50 # \"Summer Night\" (Jobim) - 3:42 # \"One Note Samba\" (Jobim, Mendon\u00e7a) - 1:58 == Personnel == *Stan Getz - tenor saxophone *Stanley Cowell - piano *Miroslav Vitous - bass *Jack DeJohnette - drums == References == Category:1996 live albums Category:Stan Getz live albums ",
