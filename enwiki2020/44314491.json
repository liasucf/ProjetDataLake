During this time she completed one of the first known studies to look at brain function using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event related potentials (ERPs). Subsequently, she was awarded a prestigious Wellcome Trust International Travel Fellowship (2000-2004) and was based at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia within their Macquarie Centre for Cognitive Sciences (MACCS), as well as at the Institute of Psychiatry in London. The focus of her fellowship was to improve our understanding of thought disorder in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using clinical interviews, psycholinguistics, cognitive assessments and brain imaging. Susan became the Head of the Cognitive Neuropsychiatry at the Mental Health Research Institute of Victoria, Melbourne from 2004-2007.

In January 2019 she stepped down from her CMH Directorship as she was awarded an NHMRC Senior Research Fellowship. == Research== Over the last 20 years, Susan has published more than 250 peer-reviewed scientific papers and book chapters. She has established an internationally recognised group in the fields of schizophrenia and body dysmorphic disorder research, particularly the neuropsychology and neuroimaging of the disorders. She is highly experienced in the application of both structural and functional brain imaging to psychiatric disorders and has been awarded a number of NHMRC grants, as well as funding from The Wellcome Trust. Her work has been internationally recognised with invited talks to the UK and Europe. == Personal == Susan has a daughter, Madalyn. == Awards == * 1999: International Congress of Schizophrenia Research Young Investigator Award * 2002: Winter workshop on Schizophrenia Research Young Investigator Award * 2004: Winter workshop on Schizophrenia Research Special Investigator Award == References == == External links == * * Staff profile at Swinburne University * PubMed entry Category:Australian women scientists Category:Living people Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:Australian Women of Neuroscience 2014 Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
