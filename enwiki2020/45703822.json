His first e-commerce software named X-Cart was released in 2001. Fazlyev and his friends utilised the code developed for commercial websites to create the first e-commerce product written in PHP. X-Cart was aimed at small and medium business that could not afford far more expensive and complicated products such as IBM WebSphere Commerce. Ecwid adopted the same approach in 2009. It is an e-commerce platform that can be built into any existing website or social network page. An award-winning product received a 1,5M round from the Runa Capital venture fund in December 2011 and a syndicated 5M round from Runa Capital and iTech Capital in May 2013.
