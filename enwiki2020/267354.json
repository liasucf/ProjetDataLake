    "text": "Z Communications is a left-wing activist-oriented media group founded in 1986 by Michael Albert and Lydia Sargent.Max Elbaum. Revolution in the air: sixties radicals turn to Lenin, Mao and Che. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Verso, 2002. p. 296. It is, in broad terms, ideologically libertarian socialist, anticapitalist, and heavily influenced by participatory economics, although much of its content is focused on critical commentary of foreign affairs. Its publications include Z Magazine, ZNet, and Z Video. == History == Zeta Magazine was founded by Michael Albert and Lydia Sargent in 1987, both of whom had previously co-founded South End Press. It was renamed Z Magazine in 1989. Founded in 1994, Z Media Institute provides classes and other sessions in how to start and produce alternative media, how to better understand media, and how to develop organising skills. The institute has hosted Stephen Shalom presentations on parpolity a number of times. Founded in 1995, Z Net (also known as ZNet and Z Communications) is a website with contributors that include Noam Chomsky, Eduardo Galeano, Boris Kagarlitsky, Edward Said, Chris Spannos and Kevin Zeese. John Pilger has described it as one of the best news sources online. Rene Milan of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies called the site a rich source of information about participism. == Publications and authors == Z Magazine is published in print and on-line monthly. Contributors to the magazine have included Patrick Bond Noam Chomsky,, Ward Churchill, Edward S. Herman, Mike Kuhlenbeck, John Ross and Kevin Zeese. Articles written by Chomsky have been republished in the New Statesman. == Criticism == In a 2005 interview with Joshua Frank, Ward Churchill discussed issues he had with Z Magazine. Churchill claimed an article he worked on was not published for two years and was misattributed. He also felt Albert and Sargent had greater influence than others involved with the publication. In 2012, George Monbiot criticised the site's defence of the book The Politics of Genocide by Edward S. Herman and David Peterson which he said had been called genocide denial by scholars he had consulted such as Martin Shaw.{{cite web| url=https://www.monbiot.com/2012/05/21/see-no-evil/ == See also == * Alternative media (U.S. political left) * CorpWatch * Independent Media Centre * Political cinema * TeleSUR * UK Watch == References == == External links == * Category:Political magazines published in the United States Category:Alternative magazines Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:1987 establishments in the United States Category:Publishing collectives Category:Magazines established in 1987 Category:Communications and media organizations based in the United States Category:Organizations based in Massachusetts Category:Magazines published in Massachusetts ",
