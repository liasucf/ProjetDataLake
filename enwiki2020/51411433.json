The review comments state - \"All through the movie, you have Alexander mouthing dialogues to make him look and sound bigger than he is\". The AP Herald review states - \"Komal Jha is the heroine of this film who comes and goes out of the film at her will. She looked good in the songs, the director should have given more scope to her role\". Technical Review \\- Both technically and musically the film is appallingly low on quality and the director has also failed in generating any interest through his narration in the film. It was stated by the critics that Taraka Ratna has to choose better scripts if he is keen on come back to mainstream roles in Telugu industry. == Soundtrack == The music is composed by Dr. Josyabatla Sarma and is rated as average in reviews. # \"Alexander\" sung by Geetha Madhuri, Vedala Hemachandra # \"Guleba Kavali\" sung by Vedala Hemachandra, Malavika # \"Vayasu\" sung by M.
