The schools offer undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral programmes in various engineering disciplines. The schools were founded by Mata Amritanandamayi Devi in 1994, and are managed by her international humanitarian organisation Mata Amritanandamayi Math. == History == The Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore was established in 1994, in a obscure village of Ettimadai at the foothills of Bouluvanpatty ranges, about 20 km away from the Coimbatore city. It was the first higher educational institution to be set up by the Mata Amritanandamayi Math, which at then had only 120 students and 13 faculty members. As Amrita's first campus, the Coimbatore is still home to the administrative headquarters of Amrita University. Later in 2002, two new campuses were opened with schools of engineering at Bengaluru, and Amritapuri. While the Bengaluru campus sits in Kasavanahalli, a neighbourhood in south- west of the Bengaluru metropolis, the Amritapuri campus was set up in the village of Vallikavu, next to the international headquarters of the Mata Amritanandamayi Math. In 2003, Amrita Vishwa Vidapeetham became one of the youngest universities to be conferred the status of a deemed university. In 2019, an engineering school started operating in the newly established Chennai campus, at the outskirts of the Chennai city in a small village of Vengal. In 2021, an engineering school started operating in its new campus at Amaravati the capital city of Andhra Pradesh state. == Schools == === Amrita School of Engineering, Amaravati === The school of engineering in Amaravati campus is the youngest and going to commence it's Academic session from 2021. It is expected to have all branches as Chennai campus. === Amrita School of Engineering, Amritapuri === The school of engineering in the Amritapuri Campus started in 2002 and it has Computer Science, Electrical & Electronics, Electronics & Communication, and Mechanical Engineering departments. === Amrita School of Engineering, Bengaluru === The school of engineering in the Bengaluru Campus has Computer Science, Electrical & Electronics, Electronics & Communication, Mechanical Engineering departments alike in the Amritapuri campus, both of which were established together in 2002. It was previously affiliated to the Visveswaraiah Technological University, Belgaum, before joining the later deemed Amrita University. === Amrita School of Engineering, Chennai === The school of engineering in the Chennai campus is newest of among the four, and started functioning in 2019. It has Civil, Computer Science, Electrical & Electronics, Electronics & Communication, Mechanical Engineering departments. === Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore === The school of engineering in Coimbatore campus predates the university, and in 1994 became the first higher-education institution to be set up by the Mata Amritanandamayi Math. It has the largest intake of students annually, and also offers the most number of programs among the four engineering schools of Amrita. Among the four, It is also the only school to have Aerospace and Chemical Engineering Departments. Other than that, the school has Civil, Computer Science, Electrical & Electronics, Electronics & Communication and Mechanical Departments. == Programs == The schools offer undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral courses in various engineering disciplines. The Amrita University having the deemed university status, enjoys full autonomy over the courses, syllabus, admissions and fees in its schools of engineering. However, the programmes are approved and come under the regulations of the AICTE. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ List of B.Tech Programs offered in Amrita Campuses with their Annual Intake !Course !Branch !Amritapuri !Bangalore !Chennai !Coimbatore !Total |- | rowspan=\"12\" |B.Tech |Aerospace Engineering |0 |0 |0 |60 |60 |- |Chemical Engineering |0 |0 |0 |60 |60 |- |Civil Engineering |0 |0 |60 |60 |120 |- |Computer & Communication |0 |0 |0 |60 |60 |- |Computer Science |240 |120 |60 |360 |780 |- |Computer Science (AI) |60 |60 |0 |60 |180 |- |Electrical & Computer |60 |60 |0 |60 |180 |- |Electrical & Electronics |60 |60 |60 |120 |300 |- |Electronics & Communication |60 |180 |60 |180 |480 |- |Electronics & Computer |60 |60 |0 |0 |120 |- |Mechanical Engineering |120 |120 |60 |180 |480 |- |Total |660 |660 |300 |1200 |2820 |} == Admission == The admissions to all the B.Tech programmes offered at Amrita Schools of Engineering is done through Amrita Engineering Entrance Examinaton (AEEE) and Joint Entrance Examination. While 70% of the seats are reserved for AEEE candidates, the rest are allotted for students applying with their JEE Main rank. The candidates based on their ranks are invited for counselling at any of the campuses, where they are allowed to choose branch and campus available, and book their seats. === AEEE === Amrita Engineering Entrance Examination (AEEE) is an annual multiple-choice entrance test conducted in April in various centres across India. Similar to the JEE, the test assesses candidates on high school topics from physics, mathematics and chemistry. Candidates can attempt the Computer Based Test (CBT) at the centres all over India and abroad, after registering for the exams. The syllabus, weightage and pattern of the examination is similar to that of JEE main. === Scholarships === The schools offer scholarships as fee waiver for first year students, based on the rank scored in the entrance examination. The student admitted through scholarship has to score minimum CGPA as per the university rules in order to earn the fee waiver in the subsequent years, or his scholarship is passed on to the next eligible student. == References == Category:Universities in India Category:1994 establishments in India ",
