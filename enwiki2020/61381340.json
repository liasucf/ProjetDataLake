    "text": "The Sudbury Ontario Northland Bus Terminal (also known as the Ontario Northland Bus Depot or ONTC Terminal) is a bus station and depot in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada operated by the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission (ONTC). It is a stop on Ontario Northland and Greyhound Canada intercity bus services. The terminal consists of a single-storey structure situated at the intersection between the Kingsway, a major east-west arterial road in Sudbury, 2nd Avenue North, which leads south toward the residential neighbourhood of Minnow Lake, and Falconbridge Road, which leads northeast toward Garson. It lies to the east of Downtown Sudbury, close to the Southeast Bypass. ==History== The site of the terminal was formerly a Saturn dealership, but it has been redeveloped and now features an indoor waiting area, washrooms, a ticket desk, and an attached bus freight depot where parcels can be loaded and unloaded. Following the cancellation of many of its routes in Northern Ontario, Greyhound Canada announced in 2016 that it was closing its Sudbury bus terminal on Notre Dame Avenue and that existing Greyhound services would be relocated to the Ontario Northland terminal on the Kingsway. Ontario Northland began to respond to the service gap created by Greyhound Canada's cuts by instituting a new Ottawa\u2013Sudbury route (schedules 670 and 680) in 2017, which has since been extended to Hearst, restoring the Hearst service which was cut in 2015. In 2018, Ontario Northland announced a major service expansion west of Sudbury, with new routes servicing Sault Ste. Marie and Manitoulin Island. Sudbury is the eastern terminus of both of these new routes. The service expansion increased passenger traffic at the terminal, with the new routes adding 15,000 new passenger trips in their first year to Ontario Northland, and making the Sudbury terminal a more important component in Northern Ontario's intercity transit network. ==Services== Ontario Northland routes which stop at the terminal include: *Schedule 300-400: Toronto \u2013 Barrie \u2013 Parry Sound \u2013 Sudbury *Schedule 500-600: Sudbury \u2013 Timmins \u2013 Hearst *Schedule 670-680: Hearst \u2013 Sault Ste. Marie \u2013 Sudbury \u2013 North Bay \u2013 Ottawa *Schedule 695-697: Sudbury \u2013 Manitoulin Island \u2013 Sudbury \u2013 North Bay Greyhound Canada also operates express routes to and from downtown Toronto and Toronto Pearson International Airport. ==Connections== Greater Sudbury Transit connections are available using the on-street bus stops on 2nd Avenue North, which are served by the 2 Second Avenue/Shopping Centre and 241 Howey/Moonlight/Shopping Centre buses. The Downtown Transit Centre is the primary hub for local buses in Greater Sudbury. The downtown Sudbury railway station is the other primary intercity transit hub in Sudbury, which serves as the eastern terminus of Via Rail's three times weekly Sudbury\u2013White River train, but is a considerable distance away and requires a bus or taxi connection. Sudbury Junction station, which is served by Via Rail's twice weekly transcontinental passenger railway service, the Canadian, is a moderate distance away, but is not served by Greater Sudbury Transit buses, and has no on-site station facilities. Capreol station at the north end of Greater Sudbury is the Canadian's next westbound stop after Sudbury Junction, and is served by Greater Sudbury Transit buses. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Bus stations in Ontario Category:Buildings and structures in Greater Sudbury Category:Transport in Greater Sudbury ",
