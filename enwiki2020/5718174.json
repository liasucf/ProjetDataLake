Having overcome her father's opposition, Roseline became a Carthusian nun at Bertaud in the Alps of Dauphin\u00e9. Her consecration took place in 1288, and in about 1330 she succeeded her aunt, Blessed Jeanne (Diane) de Villeneuve, as Prioress of La Celle-Robaud in the Diocese of Fr\u00e9jus near her home. In 1320 her brother H\u00e9lion de Villeneuve, Grand Master (1319\u201346) of the Knights of St. John, restored the monastery, and in 1323 and 1328 Pope John XXII, formerly Bishop of Fr\u00e9jus, increased its revenue, granting indulgences for the anniversary of the dedication of the church. Roseline obtained leave to resign her office before her death. Many visions together with extraordinary austerities and great power over demons are ascribed to her. ==Veneration== The feast of Saint Roseline is on 17 January.Patron Saints Index: Blessed Rosalina of Villeneuve Her feast is given in the Acta Sanctorum on 11 June, the day of the first translation of her remains in 1334 by her brother Elz\u00e9ar, Bishop of Digne; but by the Carthusian Order it is celebrated on 16 October. There has always been a local cultus and this was confirmed for the Diocese of Fr\u00e9jus by a Decree of 1851, for the Carthusian Order in 1857. The saint is usually represented with a reliquary containing two eyes, recalling the fact that her eyes were removed and preserved apart. This relic was still extant at Arcs in 1882. There is no ancient life of the saint, but that given in the Acta Sanctorum, 2 June, 489 sq., was constructed by Papebroch from ancient documents. Her shrine, situated at Les Arcs-sur-Argens near Draguignan, has been for six centuries a place of pilgrimage. The Ch\u00e2teau Sainte Roseline has been transformed into a residence and its cellar is a venue for wine-tasting. The nearby Roseline Chapel contains the relics of Saint Roseline and a wall mosaic by Chagall.Maison Mimosa - Wine tasting in Provence ==Notes== ==External links== * Roseline at the Catholic Encyclopedia * http://www.beyond.fr/sites/roseline.html St Roseline Chapel Category:1263 births Category:1329 deaths Category:People from Var (department) Category:14th-century Christian saints Category:Carthusian nuns Category:Medieval French saints Category:Female saints of medieval France Category:14th-century French people Category:14th-century French women ",
