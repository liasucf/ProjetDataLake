He has gathered together music, moments from films and television series, stories, and observations on life, and discusses them with a live studio audience who - together with viewers - have been invited round to his pad for the night. In the first programme Bob looks at the black hole that is afternoon television; unearths the moment when a contestant in Family Fortunes answered with the word \"turkey\" to all the questions (an incident also referred to in episode one, series one of the sitcom 15 Storeys High); and takes a look at life on a London council estate. Along the way he reflects on what has happened to such old friends as the \"Watney's Party Seven\", \"Aztec\" chocolate bars, Clyde Best, and \"Crimplene\". Former punk favourites The Buzzcocks provide the live music with \"What do I Get?\" and \"Ever Fallen in Love\". === Credits === *Presenter - Bob Mills *Guest Artists - Lee Cornes, Race Davies, The Buzzcocks *Director - Mike Toppin *Producer - Jeff Pope *Researchers - Una Murphy, Rrob Katz *Assc.
