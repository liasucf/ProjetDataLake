The temple is located near Sam Mountain, five kilometres from Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c. The \u0110\u1ea1i Nam nh\u1ea5t th\u1ed1ng ch\u00ed, the official chronicles of the Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty that ruled Vietnam at the time noted that the temple stood on a mountain overlooking the town and the province, praising its scenery and vibrancy. In the past century and a half, the temple has been renovated many times, two of which stand out above the others. In 1861, Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t Th\u1eeba renovated the main hall and the patriarch hall at the rear. In 1958, Th\u00edch B\u1eedu Th\u1ecd raised funds to refurbish the main hall, the front of the temple and erect a three-storey tower. The temple's architecture fuses Indian styles with local motifs. At the front near the triple gate is a statue of the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. On the front pavement are two elephants statues, a black one with two tusks and a white one with six tusks. Inside the main hall are approximately 200 statues of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, arahants, atulas and devas, mostly made of wood. All of these date back to the 19th century and were crafted by local artisans from An Giang and nearby \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province. The rear of the temple has various stupas dedicated to deceased monks. One of the most notable is that of T\u00e2y An Master, \u0110o\u00e0n Minh Huy\u00ean (1807-1856) from Sa \u0110\u00e9c. He was notable for his travels in the Mekong Delta, expounding the dharma from 1849 onwards, before spending his last years at the temple. T\u00e2y An hosts traditional Buddhis festivals on an annual basis, the full moon of the first lunar month, the full moon of the tenth lunar month and the twelfth of the eight lunar month, the death anniversary of the T\u00e2y An Master. During these festivals, in addition to the first four lunar months of the year, the temple attracts a large number of pilgrims from all locations. ==References== Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1847 Category:Buddhist temples in Vietnam Category:Buddhist temples in An Giang Province Category:1847 establishments in Vietnam ",
