    "text": "\"The Ballad of Go Go Brown\" is a song by the British new wave and synth-pop band Heaven 17, released in 1988 as the lead single from their fifth studio album Teddy Bear, Duke & Psycho. It was written and produced by Glenn Gregory, Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware. \"The Ballad of Go Go Brown\" moved away from the trio's usual sound and instead featured guitars and country-influenced sound. It peaked at No. 91 in the UK, and spent two weeks on the chart. It would prove to be the band's final Top 100 entry in the UK singles chart with new material (future entries were remixes of previous hits). No promotional video was created for the single. The band performed the song on the UK TV shows Get Fresh and The Garden Party. ==Critical reception== Upon release, William Shaw of Smash Hits criticised the band for dropping their original electronic sound and \"trying to pretend to be some ancient old \"rhythm and blues\" group\". He said of the song: \"This is a shockingly awful song. It's annoyingly nonsensical and it chugs along at such a relentlessly dismal pace.\" Mica Paris, as guest reviewer for Number One said: \"I think this is quite nice. Very country and western. I liked their older stuff a lot, but they've really moved away from that. This is OK but I couldn't handle too much of it.\" Aaron Badgley of AllMusic said: \"Teddy Bear, Duke & Psycho marked the first time that Heaven 17 highlighted guitar and real bass. Worth the price of the album, however, is the out of character country-tinged \"The Ballad of Go Go Brown.\" Heaven 17 had never sounded like this before, and it demonstrated their versatility.\" ==Formats== ;7\" single #\"The Ballad of Go Go Brown\" - 3:43 #\"I Set You Free\" - 5:08 ;12\" single #\"The Ballad of Go Go Brown (Extended Version)\" - 4:37 #\"The Ballad of Go Go Brown (7\" Version)\" - 3:43 #\"The Ballad Of Go Go Brown (Version)\" - 4:29 #\"I Set You Free\" - 5:08 ;CD single #\"The Ballad of Go Go Brown (Extended Version)\" - 4:37 #\"I Set You Free\" - 5:09 #\"The Ballad of Go Go Brown (7\" Version)\" - 3:43 #\"Slow All Over\" - 6:36 ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1988) !Peak position |- |UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|91 |} ==Personnel== ;Heaven 17 * Glenn Gregory * Martyn Ware * Ian Craig Marsh ;Additional personnel * Assorted Images - design and sleeve producer * Jean Pierre Masclet - photography ==References== Category:1988 singles Category:Heaven 17 songs Category:Songs written by Martyn Ware Category:Songs written by Glenn Gregory Category:Songs written by Ian Craig Marsh Category:1988 songs Category:Virgin Records singles ",
