The transmitter was originally located at I-196 and State Street (96th Avenue) just south of Zeeland, Michigan. In an effort to get a better signal into Grand Rapids, it was moved three miles east in 1992. It broadcasts with an effective radiated power of 4,700 watts. ==Misc== There is no known meaning of what the JQK or WJQ in the call letters stood for. PNW stood for Praise And Worship, a previous format used until September 2005 when it was switched to news and talk. ==External links== * WJQK web site * WPNW web site Category:Radio broadcasting companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Michigan Category:Zeeland, Michigan Category:Holland, Michigan ",
