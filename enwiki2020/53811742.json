    "text": "Vasantasena (Fifth century BC) was a courtesan of Ujjayini according to ancient Indian literature, who earned fame and prosperity due to her finesse in various art forms such as singing, dancing, poetry, and courting as well as for her beauty. She is the protagonist of the Sanskrit play M\u1e5bcchakatika (The Little Clay Cart) written by \u015a\u016bdraka. An oleographic print by Raja Ravi Varma depicting Vasantasena, the protagonist of the play M\u1e5bcchakatika == Character in the Play == In the play, Vasantasena is depicted as a strong character. She is not a conventional heroine waiting for a hero to come woo her. According to the play, Vasantasena falls in love with Ch\u0101rudatta, a young Brahmin who loses all his wealth due to his philanthropic and altruistic nature and is seriously impoverished. The wealthy courtesan lives a life of utmost luxury but falls in love with Ch\u0101rudatta for his extremely noble nature. Despite being happily married and having a son, Ch\u0101rudatta also falls in love with Vasantasena for her beauty, her refined personality, and her noble nature. In the play, she is shown to be very bold and courageous in expressing her love for Ch\u0101rudatta, approaching him. The strength of her character is shown in full fervour when she goes to visit his house despite a raging storm, resembling an Abhisarika nayika. It is her, and not Ch\u0101rudatta, who plays the dominant role in their love affair. Thus, she stands out as an unconventional figure of agency and strength in ancient Indian literature and medieval legend. == Art and Media == Sculpture of Vasantasena kept in National Museum, Delhi Different works in the domain of arts and media have been produced at different points of time in history because the legend has been popular since times immemorial.
