    "text": "Amanpour & Company is a late-night global-affairs interview television program hosted by Christiane Amanpour. The hour-long show premiered on PBS on September 10, 2018, as an expanded version of the CNN International show, Amanpour, augmented with interviews by correspondents at the WNET studios in New York. ==History== Following the removal of Charlie Rose in December 2017 after his sexual harassment scandal, CNN offered Amanpour to PBS to air in its place. The CNN International show aired in its exact same 30-minute format minus the CNN branding and commercials from December 2017 until September 2018 as Amanpour on PBS. From shortly after PBS picked up the show plans were in the works for an expanded PBS version of the program. The result was Amanpour & Company which was announced in May 2018 with an expanded one hour running time and a third interview block conducted by correspondents from WNET in New York. Correspondent Alicia Menendez left the show on October 1, 2019 and joined MSNBC. ==Correspondents== ===Current=== *Walter Isaacson *Michel Martin *Hari Sreenivasan *Ana Cabrera (minor) ===Former=== * Alicia Menendez (September 10, 2018 \u2013 October 1, 2019; moved to MSNBC) ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:PBS original programming Category:2018 American television series debuts Category:2010s American television talk shows Category:2020s American television talk shows Category:English-language television shows Category:2010s American late-night television series ",
