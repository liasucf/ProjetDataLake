It is also known by the alternative title of Rosselli and Son and was shot at Twickenham and Riverside Studios. Its plot concerns a son of a rag-and-bone man who suffers a dramatic fall from grace. ==Plot== Antiques dealer Roselli's dreams for his son Julius are disappointed when the young man is sent down from Oxford University for bad behaviour. Julius then gets involved with a gang of Camden Town jewel thieves for whom his father is the fence. When they attempt to rob a warehouse Julius is injured in the getaway, but he continues his involvement. The gang next plan a raid on a jeweller's in Hatton Garden, but intend to cut out Roselli. The old man, unaware that his son is a member of the gang, tips off the police. ==Cast== * Dermot Walsh - Julius Roselli * Barbara Murray - Amanda * Charles Victor - Mr Roselli * John Blythe - Maxie * Michael Ward - Cornelius Hart * Thora Hird - Vera * John Horsley - Harry Armstrong * Annette D.
