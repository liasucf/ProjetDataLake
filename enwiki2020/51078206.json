    "text": "Bogdan Alexandrovich Kistiakowsky (1863\u20131920) was a Ukrainian jurist. He was the father of the American chemist George Kistiakowsky, and the Ukrainian ornithologist Alexander Kistiakowsky. After studies in Berlin, Heidelberg and Strasbourg, he taught law at the University of Moscow and in Yaroslavl. His writings were influenced by leading German thinkers, notably neo-Kantian philosophers and Georg Jellinek. He was a friend of Max Weber, whose views on the need for reform in Russian politics he shared. Through his writings, Kistiakowsky became a leading advocate of constitutionalism in Russia. His principal work, Social Science and Law (1916), attempted to establish a theory of law in the context of the social sciences, through a critical analysis of the principal schools of legal theory of his time. ==References== * Category:1863 births Category:1920 deaths Category:Russian jurists ",
