Thus, Hedgehog pathway inhibitors are an important class of anti-cancer drugs.Rubin LL, de Sauvage FJ. Targeting the Hedgehog pathway in cancer.

ACS medicinal chemistry letters. 2010 Mar 16;1(3):130-4. both inhibitors of Smoothened (SMO), which are being used for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma. Arsenic Trioxide, an inhibitor of GLI transcription factors, is being used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.List A, Beran M, DiPersio J, Slack J, Vey N, Rosenfeld CS, Greenberg P. Opportunities for Trisenox\u00ae(arsenic trioxide) in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes. Leukemia. 2003 Aug;17(8):1499. In addition, multiple other Hedgehog pathway inhibitors are in different phases of clinical trials. == Overview of the Hedgehog Signaling Pathway == The classical Hedgehog signaling pathway involves glycoproteins that are secreted by cells into the intercellular space. Multiple such glycoproteins have been characterized: Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Indian Hedgehog (Ihh), and Desert Hedgehog (Dhh).Varjosalo M, Taipale J. Hedgehog: functions and mechanisms. Genes & development. 2008 Sep 15;22(18):2454-72. Among these, Shh is the most potent. It binds and inactivates the transmembrane protein Patched1 (PTCH1). In the absence of Shh, PTCH1 inhibits the activity of Smoothened (SMO), another transmembrane protein. Upon the inactivation of PTCH1 by Shh, glioma- associated (GLI) transcription factors enter the nucleus and activate the expression of multiple genes including Myc, Bcl-2, NANOG, and SOX2. Targets of GLIs include genes involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and self-renewal of stem cells.Hui CC, Angers S. Gli proteins in development and disease. Annual review of cell and developmental biology. 2011 Nov 10;27:513-37.Scales SJ, de Sauvage FJ. Mechanisms of Hedgehog pathway activation in cancer and implications for therapy. Trends in pharmacological sciences. 2009 Jun 1;30(6):303-12.Stecca B, Ruiz i Altaba A. Context-dependent regulation of the GLI code in cancer by HEDGEHOG and non-HEDGEHOG signals. Journal of molecular cell biology. 2010 Apr 1;2(2):84-95. In addition to the canonical pathway described above, some alternate pathways related to Shh signaling have also been reported. One example is the activation of SMO without the subsequent entry of GLI transcription factors into the nucleus. Another, better characterized pathway is the activation of GLIs independent of Shh or PTCH1 / SMO. This alternate mode of triggering the activity of GLIs is common in cancer cells. Oncogenes such as KRAS can activate the GLIs in the absence of Shh signaling.Rajurkar M, De Jesus-Monge WE, Driscoll DR, Appleman VA, Huang H, Cotton JL, Klimstra DS, Zhu LJ, Simin K, Xu L, McMahon AP. The activity of Gli transcription factors is essential for Kras-induced pancreatic tumorigenesis. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 2012 Apr 24;109(17):E1038-47. Transcriptional activity of GLIs is also upregulated upon the knockdown of p53, a tumor- suppressor gene often lost during cancer progression.Stecca B, i Altaba AR. A GLI1\u2010p53 inhibitory loop controls neural stem cell and tumour cell numbers. The EMBO Journal. 2009 Mar 18;28(6):663-76. == Role of Hedgehog Signaling in Cancer == As mentioned above, targets of the Hedgehog signaling pathway include genes involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and self-renewal of stem cells. Dysregulation of all these cellular processes has been reported across cancer types. Abnormal control of these processes in cancer cells is often a consequence of dysregulated Shh signaling. The first major breakthrough in understanding the role of Shh signaling in cancer progression was the discovery that mutations in the PTCH1 gene, which codes for the PTCH1 protein, were responsible for Gorlin syndrome.Aszterbaum M, Rothman A, Fisher M, Xie J, Bonifas JM, Zhang X, Epstein Jr EH, Johnson RL, Scott MP. Identification of mutations in the human PATCHED gene in sporadic basal cell carcinomas and in patients with the basal cell nevus syndrome.

Mutations of the human homolog of Drosophila patched in the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Cell. 1996 Jun 14;85(6):841-51. Gorlin syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by developmental abnormalities and increased risk of developing basal cell carcinoma or medulloblastoma.Gorlin RJ, Goltz RW. Multiple nevoid basal-cell epithelioma, jaw cysts and bifid rib: a syndrome.

Clinical manifestations in 105 persons with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. American journal of medical genetics. 1997 Mar 31;69(3):299-308. Mutations in the PTCH1 gene can lead to the abnormal activation of GLI transcriptional activity which in turn promotes tumor development and progression. Overexpression of Shh ligand has been reported in multiple cancer types including pancreatic, colorectal,Varnat F, Duquet A, Malerba M, Zbinden M, Mas C, Gervaz P, i Altaba AR.

The gain-of-function GLI1 transcription factor TGLI1 enhances expression of VEGF-C and TEM7 to promote glioblastoma angiogenesis. Oncotarget. 2015 Sep 8;6(26):22653. This can lead to the activation of GLI transcriptional activity in the cell over-secreting Shh (autocrine signaling) or in neighboring cells (paracrine signaling). Further, Shh ligands can stimulate the production of growth factors by stromal cells present in the tumor microenvironment. These growth factors, in turn, promote the growth, survival, and proliferation of cancer cells.Yauch RL, Gould SE, Scales SJ, Tang T, Tian H, Ahn CP, Marshall D, Fu L, Januario T, Kallop D, Nannini-Pepe M. A paracrine requirement for hedgehog signalling in cancer. Nature. 2008 Sep;455(7211):406. Aberrant Shh signaling has also been implicated in the maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In chronic myeloid leukemia and breast cancer, inhibition of Shh signaling has been shown to reduce stem cell propagation and renewal. In pancreatic and colorectal cancer, Shh signaling in CSCs drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition and, ultimately, cancer metastasis.Feldmann G, Dhara S, Fendrich V, Bedja D, Beaty R, Mullendore M, Karikari C, Alvarez H, Iacobuzio-Donahue C, Jimeno A, Gabrielson KL. Blockade of hedgehog signaling inhibits pancreatic cancer invasion and metastases: a new paradigm for combination therapy in solid cancers. Cancer research. 2007 Mar 1;67(5):2187-96.Rasheed ZA, Yang J, Wang Q, Kowalski J, Freed I, Murter C, Hong SM, Koorstra JB, Rajeshkumar NV, He X, Goggins M. Prognostic significance of tumorigenic cells with mesenchymal features in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Journal of the National Cancer Institute. 2010 Mar 3;102(5):340-51. CSCs exhibit increased potential for self-renewal, differentiation, and for starting secondary tumors at distant organ sites. CSCs also exhibit mechanisms that drive resistance to chemotherapies and radiotherapy. As a result, while chemotherapy and radiotherapy are often successful in eliminating the bulk of the tumor (which consists of non-CSCs), CSCs that are left behind can lead to tumor recurrence.Prieto-Vila M, Takahashi RU, Usuba W, Kohama I, Ochiya T. Drug resistance driven by cancer stem cells and their niche. International journal of molecular sciences. 2017 Dec 1;18(12):2574.Phi LT, Sari IN, Yang YG, Lee SH, Jun N, Kim KS, Lee YK, Kwon HY. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) in drug resistance and their therapeutic implications in cancer treatment. Stem cells international. 2018;2018. Thus, via its role in CSC maintenance, Shh signaling contributes towards the failure of anti-cancer therapies. == Mechanism of Action of Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitors == Given the role of Shh signaling in promoting tumor progression and in the failure of anti-cancer therapies, the Hedgehog signaling pathway is an important therapeutic target for restricting tumor progression and to prevent disease recurrence post-treatment. Different parts of the Hedgehog signaling pathway may be targeted to abrogate the activation of pathways that promote tumor progression. === SMO Inhibitors === Inhibition of the transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO) prevents the induction of GLI transcriptional activity upon exposure of cancer cells to Shh ligands. Loss of induction of GLIs upon activation of Shh signaling inhibits the ability of Shh signaling to promote tumor progression and cancer stem cell maintenance. Therefore, SMO has been a primary target in the development of Hedgehog pathway inhibitors. Two such inhibitors, Sonidegib and Vismodegib have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating basal cell carcinoma. Multiple other SMO inhibitors are in active clinical trials. ==== GDC-0449 (Vismodegib / Erivedge) ==== Vismodegib was created by Roche / Genentech / Curis. It directly binds to SMO, preventing GLI activation. In January 2012, it became the first Hedgehog pathway inhibitor to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of any cancer. Vismodegib is currently used for the treatment of metastatic basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in adults. It is also used for treating patients with locally advanced BCC who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy.Sekulic A, Migden MR, Oro AE, Dirix L, Lewis KD, Hainsworth JD, Solomon JA, Yoo S, Arron ST, Friedlander PA, Marmur E. Efficacy and safety of vismodegib in advanced basal-cell carcinoma. New England Journal of Medicine. 2012 Jun 7;366(23):2171-9. However, it has been shown that cancer cells in BCC patients can develop resistance to Vismodegib via mutations in the SMO protein which prevents the binding of the drug to SMO.Rudin CM, Hann CL, Laterra J, Yauch RL, Callahan CA, Fu L, Holcomb T, Stinson J, Gould SE, Coleman B, LoRusso PM. Treatment of medulloblastoma with hedgehog pathway inhibitor GDC-0449. New England Journal of Medicine. 2009 Sep 17;361(12):1173-8.Yauch RL, Dijkgraaf GJ, Alicke B, Januario T, Ahn CP, Holcomb T, Pujara K, Stinson J, Callahan CA, Tang T, Bazan JF.

Hedgehog fights back: mechanisms of acquired resistance against Smoothened antagonists. Cancer research. 2011 Aug 1;71(15):5057-61. Effectiveness of Vismodegib as a monotherapy and in combination with other chemotherapies is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials across cancer types, including medulloblastoma, small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, intracranial meningioma, recurrent glioblastoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. ==== LDE-225 (Erismodegib / Sonidegib / Odomzo) ==== Erismodegib was created by Novartis. It is a SMO antagonist that can induce arrest of cell division and promote apoptosis in cancer cells. Erismodegib has been effective in limiting the invasive potential of multiple cancer types including glioblastoma,Fu J, Rodova M, Nanta R, Meeker D, Van Veldhuizen PJ, Srivastava RK, Shankar S.

Inhibition of Hedgehog signalling by NVP-LDE225 (Erismodegib) interferes with growth and invasion of human renal cell carcinoma cells. British journal of cancer. 2014 Sep;111(6):1168. It received FDA approval in July 2015 and is being used for the treatment of BCC that has recurred post- surgery or post-radiation therapy. Erismodegib can also be used in BCC patients who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy. Effectiveness of this drug in other cancer types including hematological malignancies is currently being tested in multiple clinical trials. Other SMO inhibitors currently under clinical trial include IPI-926 (Saridegib),Tremblay MR, Lescarbeau A, Grogan MJ, Tan E, Lin G, Austad BC, Yu LC, Behnke ML, Nair SJ, Hagel M, White K.

Identification and characterization of a novel smoothened antagonist for the treatment of cancer with deregulated hedgehog signaling. === GLI Inhibitors === GLI transcription factors are the terminal effectors of the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Thus, inhibition of GLIs abrogates the ability of Hedgehog signaling to trigger processes that contribute towards tumor progression and recurrence. Since the transcriptional activity of GLIs can be activated via alternate pathways, independent of SMO, GLIs are an important therapeutic target in the development of Hedgehog pathway inhibitors for cancer treatment. ==== GANTs ==== GANTs, or GLI inhibitors, were discovered at the National Cancer Institute.Lauth M, Bergstr\u00f6m \u00c5, Shimokawa T, Toftg\u00e5rd R. Inhibition of GLI- mediated transcription and tumor cell growth by small-molecule antagonists. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 2007 May 15;104(20):8455-60. GANT-58 and GANT-61 have both been shown to inhibit the GLI-mediated activation of genes. GANT-61 effectively reduced the DNA-binding affinity of GLI1 and GLI2 in multiple cancer cell lines, including rhabdomyosarcoma,Srivastava RK, Kaylani SZ, Edrees N, Li C, Talwelkar SS, Xu J, Palle K, Pressey JG, Athar M.

PLOS ONE. 2014 Feb 12;9(2):e88386. ==== Arsenic Trioxide (ATO) ==== Arsenic Trioxide (ATO) directly binds to GLI1 and GLI2 and inhibits the expression of target genes of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, thereby promoting cancer cell apoptosis and reducing cancer cell growth.Beauchamp EM, Ringer L, Bulut G, Sajwan KP, Hall MD, Lee YC, Peaceman D, \u00d6zdemirli M, Rodriguez O, Macdonald TJ, Albanese C. Arsenic trioxide inhibits human cancer cell growth and tumor development in mice by blocking Hedgehog/GLI pathway. The Journal of clinical investigation. 2011 Jan 4;121(1):148-60. ATO has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Further, it has been shown to be effective in restricting the growth of malignant pleural mesothelioma,You M, Varona-Santos J, Singh S, Robbins DJ, Savaraj N, Nguyen DM.

Arsenic trioxide inhibits viability of pancreatic cancer stem cells in culture and in a xenograft model via binding to SHH-Gli. OncoTargets and therapy. 2013;6:1129. Several clinical trials, ranging from Phase I to Phase IV, are currently underway to test the effectiveness of ATO in both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. === Shh Inhibitors === Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is the most potent of the three Hedgehog ligands. Inhibition of Shh expression and activity can thus be an effective way of restricting Hedgehog signaling- mediated tumor progression. RU-SKI 43 inhibits the activity of SHHat, an enzyme that catalyzes the palmitoylation of Shh.Petrova E, Rios-Esteves J, Ouerfelli O, Glickman JF, Resh MD.
