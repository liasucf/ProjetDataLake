Most notably, tracks 8 and 10 are often switched, most of the tracks from 12 to the end are mixed up, and the songs Survival Comes Crashing Down and Hardship Belongs To Me are shortened to Survival and Hardship. Dibbs And Murs Check In is often not even on a track listing. ==References== Category:2006 albums Category:Trustkill Records albums Category:Terror (band) albums ",
