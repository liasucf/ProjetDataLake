It was established in 1897 by Daniel David Palmer and was the first school of chiropractic in the world. The college's name was originally the Palmer School and Cure and later became the Palmer School of Chiropractic. Most early chiropractic schools were founded by Palmer alumni. ==History== The Palmer School of Chiropractic was begun by D. D. Palmer, who is the Founder of Chiropractic. D.D.'s son, Dr. B.J. Palmer, is considered the Developer of Chiropractic because he greatly expanded the scope of the school and laid the foundation for the campus and profession that exists today. He assumed responsibility of the Palmer School of Chiropractic in 1904. According to the Palmer College website, B.J.'s \"contributions included extensive research, improved methods of spinal adjusting and analysis, higher standards for chiropractic education, and increased appreciation for chiropractic worldwide.\" After B.J.'s death in 1961, his son Dr. David D. Palmer became president of the school and changed its name to Palmer College of Chiropractic, which was one of the steps leading to the school's accreditation. Dr. Dave, as he was known, modernized the campus, established non-profit status for the college and organized the Palmer College of Chiropractic International Alumni Association. The College received accreditation from the Council on Chiropractic Education and the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools largely through his leadership, but not until after his death in 1978.
