    "text": "Duets II is the 59th and final studio album by American singer Frank Sinatra. It was released in 1994, and was the sequel to the previous year's Duets. Phil Ramone produced the album and guest artists from various genres contributed their duet parts to Sinatra's already recorded vocals. Though not as commercially successful as Duets, it still rose to #9 on the Billboard albums chart and sold over 1 million copies in the U.S. It also peaked at #29 in the UK. Critical notices were again mixed at best, although some viewed it as an improvement over its predecessor. However, the album won Sinatra the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance, his last competitive Grammy Award. These would be the last studio recordings made by Sinatra, who had begun his recording career fifty-four years earlier. Both were packaged together in a \"90th Birthday Limited Collector's Edition\" released in 2005; North American pressings add an unreleased duet recording of \"My Way\" with Willie Nelson, while international pressings have him singing with Luciano Pavarotti. ==Track listing== Unless otherwise indicated, Information is based on Liner notesSinatra, Frank. \u201cDuets II\u201d.
