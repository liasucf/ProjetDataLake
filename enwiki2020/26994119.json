    "text": "Monaco was represented by French singer Laurent Vaguener, with the song '\"Notre vie c'est la musique\", at the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 31 March in Jerusalem. The song was chosen internally by broadcaster TMC and would become Monaco's last Eurovision entry for 25 years as TMC decided to opt out of the contest from 1980, and did not return until 2004 - the longest ever absence by a country which subsequently returned to the contest. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Vaguener performed 6th in the running order, following Finland and preceding Greece. \"Notre vie c'est la musique\" had a disco-style arrangement and Vaguener gave a casually presented and vocally indifferent performance. At the close of voting the song had picked up only 12 points, placing Monaco 16th of the 19 entries. The Monegasque jury awarded its 12 points to Germany.ESC History - Monaco 1979 === Points awarded by Monaco === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"gold\"|12 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"silver\"|10 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|8 points|| |- |width=20%|7 points|| |- |width=20%|6 points|| |- |width=20%|5 points|| |- |width=20%|4 points|| |- |width=20%|3 points|| |- |width=20%|2 points|| |- |width=20%|1 point|| |- |} ===Points awarded to Monaco=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Points awarded to Monaco |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * |- |} ==See also== *Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1979 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1979 Category:Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1979 in Monaco Category:Monaco stubs ",
