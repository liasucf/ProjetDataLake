    "text": "Diana Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations is, as the title implies, a collaborative album combining Motown's two best selling groups, Diana Ross & the Supremes and the Temptations. Issued by Motown in late 1968 to coincide with the broadcast of the Supremes/Temptations TCB television special, the album was a success, reaching #2 on the Billboard 200. Originally the lead single was to have been \"The Impossible Dream\" as featured in the climax to the TV spectacular TCB. However, it was decided to release \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" as a single instead even though it was not featured on TCB. This became a number-two hit on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the R&B; charts, and the follow-up, \"I'll Try Something New\", was a Top 30 hit. A third single, \"I Second That Emotion\", was released exclusively in the United Kingdom, where it became a Top 20 hit. However, a true reflection of \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\"'s popularity was that it was certified platinum and was the #1 single on both Cash Box and Record World (three weeks). By rights, this should be credited as yet another #1 single for both Diana Ross and The Supremes and the Temptations. It was produced by Frank Wilson and Nick Ashford - without his songwriting partner-wife Valerie Simpson. Diana Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations marks the first on-record appearance of new Temptations lead singer Dennis Edwards, who was brought in as David Ruffin's replacement in July 1968. During December 1968, Motown experienced a period of exceptional success. The label had 5 of the Top 10 singles in one week including \"Love Child\" by Diana Ross and The Supremes, \"Cloud Nine\" by the Temptations, \"I Heard it Through the Grapevine\" by Marvin Gaye, \"For Once in My Life\" by Stevie Wonder and, of course, \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" by arguably the first soul/pop super group, Diana Ross and The Supremes with the Temptations. Not only that, but the corresponding albums, by each individual artists ranked in the Top 10, TCB, Diana Ross & The Supremes Join the Temptations by the respective groups held down the #1 and #2 albums. Cloud Nine by the Temptations, Love Child by Diana Ross and The Supremes, For Once in My Life by Stevie Wonder, M.P.G. by Marvin Gaye, and Time Out by Smokey Robinson and The Miracles which featured the lightning speed growth of the soon to be Top 10 single, \"Baby, Baby Don't Cry\". ==Album notes== All of the tracks on the album are covers of songs by other artists. Both \"I Second That Emotion\" and \"I'll Try Something New\" were originally recorded by Motown's Smokey Robinson & the Miracles, while \"I'm Gonna Make You Love Me\" was an outside single release by both Dee Dee Warwick and Madeline Bell before it became a hit for the Supremes and Temptations. Motown's Marvin Gaye had previously had hits with \"Try It Baby\" and, as a duet with Tammi Terrell, \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\". \"This Guy's in Love with You\" was a hit for both Dionne Warwick and Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass, while \"Funky Broadway\" had been recorded as a hit for Dyke & the Blazers and Wilson Pickett. The Sweet Inspirations' signature song, \"Sweet Inspiration\", is also covered here, as is Stevie Wonder's \"A Place in the Sun\", The Four Tops' \"Then\", and the show tune \"The Impossible Dream\" from Man of La Mancha. Frank Wilson served as executive producer of the project.
