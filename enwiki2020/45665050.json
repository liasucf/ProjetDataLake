She was the first one to publicly announce herself as Birangona, a term coined by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman for the rape victims of the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971. Government of Bangladesh awarded her Independence Day Award in 2010. ==Early life and career== Priyabhashini was born on 19 February 1947 in Khulna, Bangladesh to her parents Rowshan Hasina and Syed Mahbubul Hoque. Priyabhashini was married to an artist in 1963. She had to work in a jute mill for her family. But financial problems grew and the couple got separated in 1971. Priyabhashini later became a sculptor. Since 1990, she has exhibited her works through exhibitions. Her first exhibition was jointly inaugurated by artist SM Sultan and poet Sufia Kamal, and anchored by Syed Shamsul Haque. The 2015 play Jamuna draws inspiration from Priyabhashini's life and artwork. ==Personal life== Priyabhashini married Ahsanullah Ahmed in 1972.
