A monastery was founded on Tory in the 6th century by Colmcille. The monastery dominated life on the island until 1595, when it was plundered and destroyed by English troops, waging a war of suppression against local chieftains. The monastery's bell tower is the largest structure to survive and was built in the 6th or 7th century. ===Early modern history=== In 1608, the Siege of Tory Island, one of the final incidents of O'Doherty's Rebellion, took place when a surviving group of rebels took shelter in the castle, only to begin killing each other to secure a pardon.

This peninsula is surrounded on three sides by cliffs. Balor's Fort is accessible only by crossing a narrow isthmus, defended by four earthen embankments.Oileanthorai.com \u2014 Official Tory Island Tourism Website \u2013 Places of Interest View from D\u00fan Bhaloir * An Eochair Mh\u00f3r (the Big Key) is a long, steep-sided spur jutting from the east side of the peninsula and ending in a crag called An Tor M\u00f3r (the Big Rock or the Big Tower). The spur has prominent rocky pinnacles \u2013 these are known as 'Balor's soldiers' (Saighdi\u00fair\u00ed Bhaloir). They give the spur a 'toothed' appearance and contribute to the name, 'the Big Key'. An Tor M\u00f3r * The Wishing Stone is a precipitous flat-topped rock beside the northern cliff-face of Balor's Fort. Traditionally, a wish is granted to anyone foolhardy enough to step onto the rock, or who succeeds in throwing three stones onto it. * An Cloigtheach (the Bell Tower) is the largest structure to have survived the destruction of the monastery (see history section above). The round tower was built in the 6th or 7th century. * The Tau Cross (a t-shaped cross) is believed to date from the 12th century. It is one of only two Tau crosses in Ireland (the other being in Kilnaboy, County Clare). * M\u00f3irsheisear (Grave of the Seven): M\u00f3irsheisear, which actually translates as 'big six' \u2013 a term for seven \u2013 is the tomb of seven people, six men and one woman, who drowned when their boat capsized off Scoilt an Mh\u00f3irsheisear (the Cleft of the Seven) on the island's northwest coast. According to local superstition, clay from the woman's grave has the power to ward off vermin. * The Lighthouse, standing at the west end of the island, was built between 1828 and 1832 to a design by George Halpin, a noted designer of Irish lighthouses. In April 1990, the lighthouse was automated. The lighthouse is one of three in Ireland in which a reference station for the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) is installed. The lighthouse is at coordinates * The Torpedo: A torpedo can be seen midway between An Baile Thiar and An Baile Thoir. It washed ashore during World War II and was defused and erected at its present location. ==Flora and fauna== The island is an Important Bird Area.BirdLife International (2015) Important Bird Areas factsheet: Tory Island.
