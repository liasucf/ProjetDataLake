    "text": "Shouting and Pointing is a 1976 album by British band Mott. It was the second and final album by the group. Despite favorable nods by critics in the music press, Shouting and Pointing was the only Mott album to not chart at all in either the U.S. or U.K. Following that disappointment, the band was dropped by CBS records. Singer Benjamin left, to be replaced by ex-Medicine Head band singer/guitarist John Fiddler, and the band changed their name to British Lions, just one year after the release of this album. ==Track listing== ===Side one=== # \"Shouting and Pointing\" (Morgan Fisher, Pete Overend Watts) \u2013 4:31 # \"Collision Course\" (Watts) \u2013 3:25 # \"Storm\" (Fisher, Ray Major, Watts) \u2013 5:31 # \"Career (No Such Thing as Rock 'n' Roll)\" (Nigel Benjamin, Fisher) \u2013 5:26 ===Side two=== # \"Hold on, You're Crazy\" (Watts) \u2013 4:31 # \"See You Again\" (Watts) \u2013 4:22 # \"Too Short Arms (I Don't Care)\" (Fisher, Major) \u2013 4:00 # \"Broadside Outcasts\" (Fisher, Watts) \u2013 3:18 # \"Good Times\" (Harry Vanda, George Young) \u2013 3:57 ==Personnel== ===Mott=== * Nigel Benjamin \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm and acoustic guitars * Ray Major \u2013 lead and slide guitars, backing vocals * Morgan Fisher \u2013 piano, backing vocals, organ, synthesizer * Pete Overend Watts \u2013 bass, backing vocals * Dale \"Buffin\" Griffin \u2013 drums, backing vocals, percussion ===Technical=== * Mott \u2013 producer, arranger * Eddie Kramer \u2013 producer, engineer * Mick \"The Mint\" Glossop \u2013 engineer * Bill Price, Ric Stokes \u2013 mastering * Roslav Szaybo \u2013 design * Alan Messer, Dale Griffin, Gered Mankowitz \u2013 photography ==References== ==External links== *Shouting and Pointing review *Shouting and Pointingat Discogs *Shouting and Pointing at Allmusic Category:Mott the Hoople albums Category:Glam rock albums by English artists Category:1976 albums Category:albums produced by Eddie Kramer Category:Columbia Records albums ",
