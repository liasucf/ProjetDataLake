    "text": "Matilda Maranda Crawford (pen names, Maude Moore, M. M., Mrs. John Crawford; 21 July 1844 \u2013 24 December 1920) was an American-Canadian newspaper correspondent and poet. ==Early years== Matilda (nicknames Mattie or Maty) Maranda Quackenbush was born in Clay, New York, near Syracuse, in 21 July 1844. She was of German ancestry. Her father, Garret Quackenbush, was a laborer, and her mother, Sarah Reese, was a tailor. In 1851, Crawford, her mother, and five older siblings removed to Consecon, Prince Edward County, Ontario, where Crawford attended a grammar school. Quick to learn, at the age of twelve she stood at the head of her classes, but had never written a composition. Gifted with an active and retentive memory, each bit of poetry she heard was remembered, and when but a child, she recited at one time the whole of Oliver Goldsmith 's The Deserted Village. ==Career== As an adult, Crawford lived in Michigan for some time, and while there, she was engaged in teaching. It was at that time that she commenced to contribute to the literary press. In 1868, she returned to Canada, locating in Newtonville, Ontario. While there, she wrote for various Canadian and American newspapers as a pastime. In 1871, she married John Crawford (1840-1912), of Clarke, Ontario. For a few years, her literary efforts were laid aside, owing to domestic responsibilities. She had two children, a boy and girl (Maude). In 1887, an entire summer's illness afforded leisure her for literary work, and thereafter, she wrote for the press. She used various assumed names, including \"Maude Moore\", \"M. M.\", and \"Mrs. John Crawford\". Crawford died of a stroke in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on 24 December 1920, and was buried at Port Hope Union Cemetery. ==Selected works== * Songs of all Seasons * Climes and Times: a Motely Jingle of Jumbled Rhymes (1890) ==Notes== ==References== ===Attribution=== * * ==External links== * Category:1844 births Category:1920 deaths Category:19th-century American essayists Category:19th-century Canadian non-fiction writers Category:19th-century American women writers Category:19th-century Canadian women writers Category:19th-century American poets Category:19th-century Canadian poets Category:People from Clay, New York Category:Canadian newspaper reporters and correspondents Category:American newspaper reporters and correspondents Category:American women poets Category:Canadian women poets Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:Pseudonymous writers Category:Pseudonymous women writers Category:Canadian women non-fiction writers ",
