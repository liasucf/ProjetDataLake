On 3 December 2016, he left Teuta Durr\u00ebs by terminating his contract by mutual consent. The club staff was not happy with his performance during the first part of the 2016\u201317 season, and Lam\u00e7ja himself was not happy with the playing time he was given during that time, which lead to the divorce. On 26 December 2016, Lam\u00e7ja joined Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr by signing until December 2019. On 15 May 2017, during the league match against his former side Teuta, Lam\u00e7ja was involved in a brawl moments after Teuta equalized in the 97th minute. Four days later, he was banned six matches by Commissary Committee of AFA for unsportsmanlike conduct. One the same day, the club issued a statement, citing Lam\u00e7ja's ban as \"scandal\", adding that the club will appeal the decision. He scored his first goals of 2017\u201318 season in form of a brace in the 5\u20130 thrashing of Partizani Tirana on 17 December 2017. It was Partizani's biggest loss since returning in top flight in 2013 and Lam\u00e7ja's first career brace. It was also his first goal since April 2017, ending a barren run of 22 matches in all competitions without scoring. He concluded the 2017\u201318 season by amassing 30 league appearances and scored 3 goals, with Luft\u00ebtari qualifying UEFA Europa League for the first time in history. He left the club afterwards after his contract run out and the parties didn't agree for the financial part. On 20 July 2018, Lam\u00e7ja left Albanian football and joined Football Superleague of Kosovo side Drita for the 2018\u201319 season. He made two appearances as substitute for the team in 2018\u201319 UEFA Europa League Champions Path second qualifying round against F91 Dudelange. Drita was knocked-out 3\u20132 on aggregate by the Luxembourgish side. On 13 August, he won the 2018 Kosovar Supercup as Drita won 2\u20131 against Prishtina at Fadil Vokrri Stadium. On 25 December 2018, Drita announced to have terminate the contract with Lam\u00e7ja, who failed to adapt and impress during his short tenure at Gjilani side. On 12 January 2018, Lam\u00e7ja was presented as the new player of Bylis Ballsh on a deal until the end of the campaign. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Elbasani |2012\u201313 |rowspan=\"2\"|Albanian First Division |19||4||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||19||4 |- |2013\u201314 |18||3||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||18||3 |- |2014\u201315 |rowspan=\"1\"|Albanian Superliga |24||4||4||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||28||5 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !61!!11!!4!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!65!!12 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Teuta Durr\u00ebs |2015\u201316 |rowspan=\"2\"|Albanian Superliga |31||3||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||34||4 |- |2016\u201317 |8||0||3||0||1All appearance(s) in UEFA Europa League||0||12||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !39!!3!!6!!1!!1!!0!!46!!4 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"2\"|Albanian Superliga |15||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||15||2 |- |2017\u201318 |30||3||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||33||3 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !45!!5!!3!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!48!!5 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Drita |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1\"|Football Superleague of Kosovo |4||0||1One appearance in Kosovar Supercup||0||2||0||7||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Bylis Ballsh |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1\"|Albanian First Division |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !149!!19!!13!!2!!3!!0!!165!!21 |} ==Honours== ;Elbasani *Albanian First Division: 2013\u201314 ;Drita *Kosovar Supercup: 2018 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Elbasan Category:Albanian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:KF Elbasani players Category:KF Teuta Durr\u00ebs players Category:Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr players Category:FC Drita players Category:KF Bylis Ballsh players Category:KF Vushtrria players Category:Albanian First Division players Category:Albanian Superliga players Category:Football Superleague of Kosovo players Category:Albanian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Kosovo Category:Albanian expatriate sportspeople in Kosovo ",
