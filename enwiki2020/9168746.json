One of these, the Dongfeng \"Hanma\" rely on imported U.S. made parts including Hummer H1 chassis and GM V8 6.5L diesel engine.s Currently, these companies have the capability of making indigenous parts for these Humvee-like vehicles. ==Variants== ===Dongfeng EQ2050=== Dongfeng EQ2050 in Beijing During the 1988 Beijing Defence Exhibition, AM General presented a M998 4x4 to the People's Liberation Army. The PLA didn't show much interest to the vehicle before the events of Operation Desert Storm, which made them interested in studying the vehicle. The Chinese petroleum industry purchased Hummers through American commercial sources in the mid-1990s. This provided the Chinese auto makers with an opportunity to examine the vehicle closely and provided an opportunity for reverse engineering. Later in 2003, the EQ2050 made its debut in a car show after a prototype was made in 2002. The vehicle became the preferred candidate in 2004 with 57 vehicles sent to the PLA for trials from 2004 to 2006. The first 100 EQ2050s were made with American-made parts. It passed design trials in 2006. EQ2050s were then delivered to PLA special forces unit in the Guangzhou Military Region. It's known as Mengshi in Chinese. The EQ2050 is based on an imported AM General Hummer H1 chassis. The DFM EQ2050 is powered by a Dongfeng license-built Cummins EQB150-20 110 kW/2,700R turbo-charged diesel, but it can also be fitted with the U.S.-made V8 diesel originally designed for Humvee. Both vehicles have a 5-speed gear box and a 2-speed transfer box. They are both four-wheel drive with independent suspensions and central inflating system. The EQ2050 also has re- designed lights and radiator to make it look different from the original Humvee. DFM has cooperated with AM General Motors on getting American-made parts for the first EQ2050s made. A variant of the EQ2050 called the EQ2058 was made for military purposes, which has an armored body. A civilian version of the EQ2050 is being made by DFM, which will use petrol engines instead of diesel engines. The Dongfeng CSK141 is a variant first manufactured in 2014, but was shown publicly in 2015 and in 2016 at the Zhuhai 2016 exhibit. It has been seen in the PLA Hong Kong Garrison in 2017. It has an all-round protection for 7.62x39 ammo. Its subvariants include the Dongfeng EQ2101, a vehicle with a 6x6 configuration with the CS VN/11 is the export version, first released in 2016, with rear doors instead of clamshell type rear doors. While the EQ2050 was adopted by the PLA, it was also adopted by People's Armed Police Fire Fighting brigades and by Chinese Public Security Police forces. It is called the Hanma, an approximation of the Chinese pronunciation of Hummer. An airborne assault vehicle known as the CSK002 Airbone Assault Vehicle is equipped with smoke grenade dischargers, a machine gun on top and an AGL on the front passenger seat. A 6x6 version is known as the EQ2025, which has a 4x4 variant. There's a pickup truck version made available for transporting objects on the bed. A civilian version has been produced, known as the EQ2040H Brave Soldier. So far, it has been shown in auto shows. It was previously licensed to DRB-HICOM to be marketed to countries that wish to buy it in a RHD configuration. ===Shenyang Aircraft Corporation SFQ2040=== In 2002, Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC) revealed its own Humvee clone known as SFQ2040 LieYing (Falcon). The missile system, mounted on an SAC SFQ2040, is similar to the U.S. Army HMMWV-mounted Avenger air defense system. SAC also emphasizes the low cost of its SFQ2040 with the price being one-third of the U.S.-made Humvee. A few working prototypes were made from 2002 to 2003. At least 38 vehicles were known to be made. Unlike the steel body EQ2050, the SAC SFQ2040 has an aluminum alloy body, making it much lighter than the former. It uses a Cummins 4BTAA-92 turbodiesel engine. SAC lost out to DFM, which resulted in an attempt to create a civilian version of the SFQ2040, but it never went into production. Both vehicles have limited armor protection against small caliber weapons. The vehicles can be fitted with additional equipment such as air conditioning, GPS, night vision equipment, vehicle-mounted radio, electric winch, and multipurpose weapon mount. ===Xiaolong XL2060=== A third Humvee clone is the XL2060L Fierce Dragon from Xiaolong Automotive Technologies Co., Ltd. XAT publicly rolled out the vehicles from its production lines on October 2008. Trials are being conducted by the PLA in remote areas such as Tibet, followed by tests in the deserts of Dubai. The XL2060L was on display at the Second Beijing International Disaster Emergency Response technology and equipment exhibition. The XL2060L was influenced from the Humvee and the Unimog. It uses a Steyr diesel engine and its cost ranges from US$87,000 - $146,000. Production is based from the Longyan Economic Development Zone High- tech Park in Longyan City. Mass production started in early 2012. ==Operators== Map of HMMWV (Humvee) operators worldwide.
