    "text": "Ethyl maltol is an organic compound that is a common flavourant in some confectioneries. It is related to the more common flavorant maltol by replacement of the methyl group by an ethyl group.Erich L\u00fcck and Gert-Wolfhard von Rymon Lipinski \"Foods, 3. Food Additives\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. It is a white solid with a sweet smell that can be described as caramelized sugar and cooked fruit. The conjugate base derived from ethylmaltol, again like maltol, has a high affinity for iron, forming a red coordination complex. In such compounds, the heterocycle is a bidentate ligand. ==References== Category:Flavors Category:Flavor enhancers Category:Perfume ingredients Category:4-Pyrones Category:Enols ",
