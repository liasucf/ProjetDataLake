    "text": "Hayagriva, also spelt Hayagreeva (IAST: , literally 'Horse-neck'Monier- Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary), is a horse-headed avatar of the Lord Vishnu in Hinduism. ==Hinduism== In Hinduism, Lord Hayagriva is an avatar of Lord Vishnu. He is worshipped as the god of knowledge and wisdom, with a human body and a horse's head, brilliant white in color, with white garments and seated on a white lotus. Symbolically, the story represents the triumph of pure knowledge, guided by the hand of God, over the demonic forces of passion and darkness. Origins about the worship of Hayagriva have been researched, some of the early evidences dates back to 2,000 BCE, when people worshipped the horse for its speed, strength, intelligence.Originally from = University of Michigan Hayagriva is one of the prominent deities in Vaikhanasas, Sri Vaishnavism and Madhwa Brahmins traditions. His blessings are sought when beginning study of both sacred and secular subjects. Special worship is conducted on the day of the full moon in August (\u015arava\u1e47a-Paur\u1e47am\u012b) (his avat\u0101ra-dina) and on Mahanavami, the ninth day of the Navaratri festival. He is also hailed as \"Hayasirsa\".Inquiries into the absolute Haya\u015bir\u1e63a means haya=Horse, \u015bir\u1e63a=Head. > In IAST > j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101nandamaya\u1e43 deva\u1e43 nirmalaspha\u1e6dik\u0101k\u1e5bti\u1e43 > \u0101dh\u0101ra\u1e43 sarvavidy\u0101n\u0101\u1e43 hayagr\u012bva\u1e43 up\u0101smahe > In Devan\u0101gar\u012b > \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0928\u0928\u094d\u0926\u092e\u092f\u0902 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0902 \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0932\u0938\u094d\u092b\u091f\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u0902 > \u0906\u0927\u093e\u0930\u0902 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u0939\u092f\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0935\u0902 \u0909\u092a\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0939\u0947 This verse is originally from the Pa\u00f1car\u0101tra Agamas but is now popularly prefixed to the Hayagriva Stotram of the 13th-century poet-philosopher Vedanta Desika. It is very popular among devotees of Hayagr\u012bva. ===Hindu iconography=== Hayagriva in Khajuraho Lakshamana Temple Vedanta Desika's dhy\u0101na-\u015bloka (meditative verse) on Hayagr\u012bva typifies this deity's depiction in Hindu iconography: > He has four hands, with one in the mode of bestowing knowledge; another > holds books of wisdom, and the other two hold the Conch and Discus. His > beauty, like fresh cut crystal, is an auspicious brilliance that never > decays. May this Lord of speech who showers such cooling rays of grace on me > be forever manifest in my heart! In the Mahavairocana-sutra [S\u016btra of the > Great Sun] translated and copied in 1796 by I-hsing it says: \u201cBeneath the > buddhas is Hayagriva. His body is the color of the sun at dawn. He wears > flaming effulgence and skulls as a garland. His nails are long and sharp; > his face shows a pair of bare tiger\u2019s fangs. His hair is that of a burning > lion\u2019s mane.He is awesomely powerful and fierce! This is the fierce > Vidyaraja of the Lotus section. He is just like a horse-jewel of a > Cakravartin that wanders the four continents, nowhere and never does he > rest, having all the great and terrible force of all the buddhas\u2019. This is > his nature, and therefore he possesses this terrible and all-mighty light. > Amidst the greatest obstacles of death and evil he is without the slightest > care for his own welfare, his conspicuous and uncommon gallantry, > intrepidity, and wrath is legendary among the gods, and therefore he easily > and quickly vanquishes all who oppose him! Many others submit to him at > first sight! This is because though he is fierce and terrible; his heart is > full of compassion (unbiased, dispassionate understanding).\u201d \\-- Hayagr\u012bva > Stotram, v.32 Later on Hayagriva is referred to as the \u201cHorse necked one\u201d, Defender of faith\u201d, the \u201cTerrible executioner\u201d, the \u201cExcellent Horse\u201d, and the \u201cAerial horse\u201d. This said, the Horse Avatar of Lord Vishnu is seen as pulling the sun up to the heavens every day, bringing light to darkness. Hayagriva's consort is Marichi, the goddess of the rising sun, more accurately the sun's light which is the life force of all things, and which is seen as the female aspect of Hayagriva. Marichi represents the essence of the power of creation of the cosmos. Whereas Hayagriva represents the other male aspect. In several other sources he is a white horse who pulls the sun into the sky every morning. In others such as the great epic Taraka-battle where the gods are fallen on and attacked by the Danava's [demons], Vishnu appears as a great ferocious warrior called Hayagriva when he comes to their aid. It says; \u201cHayagriva appears in his chariot, drawn by 1,000 powerful steeds, crushing the enemies of the gods beneath him!\u201d Srimad Andavan and Sri Parakala Jeeyar in front of Sri Laxmi Hayagriva of Parakala Mutt There are many other references to Hayagriva throughout the Mahabharata. It is said that Vishnu comes from battle as a conqueror in the magnificent mystic form of the great and terrible Hayagriva; \u201cThe great Hayagriva having been praised in this way by the different saints and ascetics, assumes a great white horses head. The verda\u2019s [mantras] made up his shape, his body built of all the great gods; in the middle of his head was Shiva, in his heart was Brahm\u0101 [god of heaven]; the rays of sun (Marichi) were his mane, the sun and moon his eyes; the Vasus and Sadhyas were his legs, in all his bones were the gods. Agni [Ka-ten; god of fire] was his tongue, the goddess Satya his speech, while his knees were formed by the Maruts and Varuna. Having assumed this form, an awesome wonder to behold to the gods, he vanquished the asura, and cast them down, with eyes that were red with anger.\u201d Invariably, Hayagriva is depicted seated, most often with his right hand either blessing the supplicant or in the vy\u0101khy\u0101 mudr\u0101 pose of teaching. The right hand also usually holds a ak\u1e63a-m\u0101l\u0101 (rosary), indicating his identification with meditative knowledge. His left holds a book, indicating his role as a teacher. His face is always serene and peaceful, if not smiling. Unlike his Buddhist counterpart, there is no hint of a fearsome side in the Hindu description of this deity. Indeed, the two deities seem to be totally unrelated to one another. Hayagriva is sometimes worshiped in a solitary pose of meditation, as in temple in Thiruvanthipuram. This form is known as Yoga- Hayagriva. However, he is most commonly worshipped along with his consort Lakshmi and is known as Lakshmi-Hayagriva. Hayagriva in this form is the presiding deity of Mysore's Parakala Mutt, a significant Sri Vaishnavism monastic institution. ===In Sakta history=== Hyagreeva restoring Vedas to Brahma which were taken to Rasatala A legend has it that during the creation, the demons Madhu-Kaitabha stole the Vedas from Brahma, and Vishnu then took the Hayagriva form to recover them. The two bodies of Madhu and Kaitabha disintegrated into twelve pieces (two heads, two, four arms and four legs). Yet another legend has it that during the creation, Vishnu compiled the Vedas in the Hayagr\u012bva form. Some consider Hayagriva to be one of the Dashavataras of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He along with \u015ar\u012b Krishna, Shr\u012b Rama and Shri Narasimha is considered to be an important avatar of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Hayagriva is also amongst the deities present at the Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam. Hayagreeva in Srirangam is very famous for children's education. The Sanctum Sanctorum of the inner temple. is very beautiful and all rituals are done according to Vedic principles very strictly. Mahabharata, book 12, chapter 348, says the following: Having compassed the destruction of the two Asuras and restored the Vedas to Brahma, the Supreme Being dispelled the grief of Brahma. Aided then by Hari and assisted by the Vedas, Brahma created all the worlds with their mobile and immobile creatures. After this, Hari, granting unto the Grandsire intelligence of the foremost order relating to the Creation, disappeared there and then for going to the place he had come from. It was thus that Narayana, having assumed the form equipped with the horse-head, slew the two Danavas Madhu and Kaitabha (and disappeared from the sight of Brahma). ==Hayagr\u012bva Mahatmyam== A great devotee named \u015ar\u012bVadirajatirtha of Udupi \u015ar\u012b K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Mutt used to offer cooked horse gram (Kollu) to Lord Hayagreeva.\u015ar\u012b Vadiraja's lifehistory He used to recite the Hayagr\u012bva \u015aloka and keep the offerings on his head. Lord Hayagr\u012bva would come as a beautiful white horse form and would eat the horse gram. As a very staunch devotee, Vadirajatirtha would recite the following sloka - Na HayagrivAth Param Asthi MangaLam Na HayagrivAth Param Asthi Paavanam Na HayagrivAth Param Asthi Dhaivatham Na Hayagrivam Pranipathya Seedhathi! There is no auspiciousness greater than Hayagrivan. Nothing is more sacred than Sri Hayagrivan to destroy our accumulated sins. No other God is superior to Hayagrivan. No one grieves after performing \u015aara\u1e47agati at the sacred feet of Hayagrivan. Hayagriva is listed as one of the ten incarnations of Vishnu in Canto 10 (skandh 10), chapter 40 of the \u015ar\u012bmadbhagavatam, and Akr\u016bra's prayer contains Hayagriva's name when he had a vision while bathing in Yamuna. There is a story that more than 500 years ago, a devotee from the Daivaj\u00f1a Brahmin community was casting an idol of Lord Ga\u1e47apati, when it shaped itself in the image of Lord Hayagriva. Sarvabhauma Sri Vadiraja Guru Swamiji had a dream about this legend which inspired him to approach that devotee and take the idol from him in reverence. He then installed it in Shri Sode Vadiraja Mutt. Since then it has been worshipped there as the originating God of the Daivajnya Brahmin community. The members of the community who were originally Smartha Brahmins, were instructed in Dvaita philosophy and received into the fold as Mukhya \u015ai\u1e63yas by the revered Sri Vadiraja Teertha. To this day, Daivaj\u00f1a Brahmins continue to make offerings to the Mutt and Lord Hayagriva. ==Temples of Hayagriva== Hayagreevar Temple, adjacent to Koodal Azhagar Temple ===Assam=== * Hayagriv Madhav Dol at Hajo, Assam ===Tamil Nadu=== Most of the major Vishnu temples in Tamil Nadu have a separate shrine for Lord Hayagriva. * Sri Lakshmi Hayagriva Temple, Thiruvaheendrapuram, Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu * Sri Hyagreevar Temple, adjacent to Sri Koodal Alagar Perumal Koil, Madurai * Sri Hyagreevar(\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bc0 \u0bb9\u0baf\u0b95\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bc0\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd)swamy, Sri Chidambara Vinayagar Thirukoil, A.
