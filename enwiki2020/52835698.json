It belongs to the Campanulaceae, or bellflower, family. == Description == Herzegovinian bellflower is a fragile perennial cushion plant with a length of 12\u201320 cm, sometimes 40 cm. It has a thick, lumpy semiwoody rhizome which can penetrate deep into the cracks of limestone cliffs. Its stems are numerous, square, and highly bendable. The leaves of sterile individuals are gathered in tufts, ovate, pointed, with a heart-shaped base. Both sides have 2\u20133 teeth and stems are about three times longer than the lamina. It blossoms from June to August. The flowers are in clusters of 2\u20135, with 1\u20133 bracts. The crown is bare, light blue, split into five triangular lobes. The fruit is a poricidal capsule containing numerous seeds. It opens on the side, thanks to the 3-5 holes, and the top of the fruit remains closed. The seeds are about 1 mm in length and about 0.3 mm wide. The diploid chromosome of these bellflowers is 2n = 24. ==Distribution and ecology == It is endemic from the Southeast Dinaric mountains to Albania.
