    "text": "County Buildings is a municipal facility at Martin Street in Stafford, Staffordshire. It is a Grade II* listed building. ==History== In the 19th century the Shire Hall became well established as the location for judicial meetings in the county. Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, there was a need to find a meeting place for Staffordshire County Council. The new County Buildings, which were designed by HT Hare, were completed in 1895. The majority of the county council staff were re-located to the Staffordshire Place development in 2011. Although the departure of the administrative staff to Staffordshire Place facilitated the conversion of the offices into private residences, the meeting place of the county council remains County Buildings in Martin Street. ==See also== *Grade II* listed buildings in Stafford (borough) *Listed buildings in Stafford (Central Area) ==References== S Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Staffordshire Category:Government buildings completed in 1895 ",
