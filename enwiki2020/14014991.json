    "text": "Francesco Capelli (active c. 1568) was an Italian painter. He was born in Sassuolo in the province of Modena, and was educated in the school of Correggio. He painted a 'Madonna and Child in Glory with attendant Saints' for the church of San Sebastian at Sassuolo. He was also called Caccianemici, but must not be confounded with another Francesco Caccianemici, a contemporary pupil of Primaticcio, and lived about the same period. ==References== * Category:16th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Renaissance painters Category:Modenese painters Category:People from Modena Category:Year of death missing Category:Year of birth missing ",
