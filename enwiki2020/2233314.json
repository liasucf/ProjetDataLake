He was martyred during the Battle of Karbala, and is commemorated in shia as the \"personified quintessence of the innocent victim.\" == Biography == He was born in Medina on the 9th of Rajab, 60 AH. His father's other sons were Imam Zayn al-Abidin and \u2018Ali al-Akbar. \u2018Abdullah's three sisters were Ruqayyah (Sukainah), Fatimah al- Kubra (Sakinah) and Fatimah al-Sughra. Rubab and her two children, Sakina and Ali Asghar, accompanied Husayn to Karbala. In hagiography about the Battle, Husayn's camp at one time was cut off from water supplies from 7th moharram till Ashura and so Husayn went to Yazid's besieging forces to plead water for the women and children in his camp. Husayn had brought along Ali Asghar for mercy, but Yazid's soldiers then martyred Ali by an arrow to his throat. Shia tradition relates that Ali Asghar was martyred by an opposing soldier named Hurmala with a three-headed arrow, when he moved his neck to stop the arrow from hitting his father. Ali Asghar was only six months old when he died. He is honored by Shia as the youngest person martyred at the Battle of Karbala. == Aftermath == The massacre at Karbala made Mukhtar al-Thaqafi seek revenge. He led an uprising in which Hurmala and a number of his comrades were killed.Al-Kashee, Ikhtiyaar Ma`arifah Al-Rijaal, pg. 127, hadeeth # 202Al- Khoei, Mu`jam Rijaal Al-Hadeeth, vol. 18, pg. 93, person # 12158 === Commemoration === Iranian children wearing keffiyehs in a Shia ritual for remembrance of Ali al-Asghar ibn Husayn In the Hosseini infancy conference, babies wear green or white cloth like cloth of Ali al-Asghar ibn Husayn Ali al-Asghar is buried along with his brother Ali al-Akbar and his father Husayn in Karbala, Iraq, which is now one of the most visited shrines in the world.Journeys of Tears, published by the Wessex Jamaat Ali al-Asghar and his death are commemorated in various ways, including iconographic depictions, hagiography recitations (rowzeh), poetry (nowheh), replicas of Ali Asghar's cradle and grave, and dolls representing him. according to Shia ritual shahadat-e-Ali asghar is on 9th moharram night however, he was killed 71st before imam Husayn.
