    "text": "Robert Bauer (1950 \u2013 8 September 2014) was a German mycologist, specialising in rust (Uredinales) and smut (Ustilaginomycetes) fungi. Bauer studied Biology at the University of T\u00fcbingen during the 1970s, and a particular interest in plants and fungi led to completing his PhD there in 1983 with a doctoral dissertation entitled ' (Experimental-ontogenetic and karyological studies on Uredinales). He went on to become chair of \"Systematic Botany and Mycology\" (now \"Evolutionary Ecology of Plants\") in the \"Institute of Evolution and Ecology\" at T\u00fcbingen. He became adept in the use of electron microscopes and the prerequisite specialised cutting and preparation techniques at a time when ultrastructural study of fungi was still in its infancy. He became known for detailed work on mycoparasitic fungi and the smut fungi in particular. He was able to use ultrastructural evidence to postulate phylogenies in this group before molecular techniques were developed. Subsequent molecular studies aligned with his hypotheses. Bauer produced over 100 publications during his career, during which time he was also strongly involved in teaching, the university's botanic garden and overseeing specialist internships in electronmicroscopy. Bauer died, aged 64, on 8 September 2014 in Neckartailfingen, Stuttgart. ==See also== *List of mycologists ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Date of birth unknown Category:Place of birth unknown Category:2014 deaths Category:German mycologists Category:University of T\u00fcbingen alumni Category:University of T\u00fcbingen faculty ",
