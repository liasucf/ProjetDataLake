The modern field of microeconomics arose as an effort of neoclassical economics school of thought to put economic ideas into mathematical mode. ==Traditional marginalism== Classic duopoly model of Cournot: reaction functions of both firms are derived by imposing profit maximisation, the Nash equilibrium is given by intersection of R1 and R2. At equilibrium no firm has a rational self-interest in changing produced quantities. An early attempt was made by Antoine Augustine Cournot in Researches on the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of WealthA. Cournot, Researches into the mathematical principles of the theory of wealth, 1838 https://archive.org/details/researchesintom00fishgoog (1838) in describing a spring water duopoly that now bears his name. Later, William Stanley Jevons's Theory of Political EconomyS. Jevon, The Theory of Political Economy,1871 (1871), Carl Menger's Principles of EconomicsC.Menger,Principles of Economics, 1871 https://mises.org/etexts/menger/principles.asp (1871), and L\u00e9on Walras's Elements of Pure Economics: Or the theory of social wealth (1874\u201377)Leon Walras, Elements of Pure Economics, 1874 https://books.google.com/books/about/Elements_of_Pure_Economics.html?id=hwjRD3z0Qy4C&redir;_esc=y gave way to what was called the Marginal Revolution. Some common ideas behind those works were models or arguments characterised by rational economic agents maximising utility under a budget constraint. This arose as a necessity of arguing against the labour theory of value associated with classical economists such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx. Walras also went as far as developing the concept of general equilibrium of an economy. Alfred Marshall's textbook, Principles of Economics was published in 1890 and became the dominant textbook in England for a generation. His main point was that Jevons went too far in emphasising utility as an attempt to explain prices over costs of production. In the book he writes: In the same appendix he further states: Marshall's diagram: SS' is the supply curve, DD' is the demand curve and A is the equilibrium Marshall's idea of solving the controversy was that the demand curve could be derived by aggregating individual consumer demand curves, which were themselves based on the consumer problem of maximising utility. The supply curve could be derived by superimposing a representative firm supply curves for the factors of production and then market equilibrium would be given by the intersection of demand and supply curves. He also introduced the notion of different market periods: mainly short run and long run. This set of ideas gave way to what economists call perfect competition, now found in the standard microeconomics texts, even though Marshall himself had stated:A.Marshall, Principles of Economics, 1890, BOOK VI, CHAPTER II: PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF DISTRIBUTION, CONTINUED. One of Marshall's diagrams for monopoly: DD' is the demand curve, SS' the supply curve, QQ' is the monopoly revenue curve and q3 the maximum revenue point. Cournot had already considered the mathematics of monopoly in the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth but he draw no diagram An early formulation of the concept of production functions is due to Johann Heinrich von Th\u00fcnen, which presented an exponential version of it. The standard Cobb\u2013Douglas production function found in microeconomics textbooks refers to a collaborative paper between Charles Cobb and Paul Douglas published in 1928 in which they analysed U.S. manufacturing data using this function as the basis of a regression analysis for estimating the relationship between inputs (labour and capital) and output (product): this discussion takes place through the concept of marginal productivity. The mathematical form of the Cobb\u2013Douglas function can be found in the prior work of Wicksell, Th\u00fcnen, and Turgot. Jacob Viner presented an early procedure for constructing cost curves in his \u201cCost Curves and Supply Curves\u201d (1931), Reprinted in the paper was an attempt to reconcile two streams of thought when dealing with this issue at the time: the idea that supplies of factors of production were given and independent of rate of remuneration (Austrian School) or dependent on rate of remuneration (English School, that is followers of Marshall). Viner argued that, \u201cThe differences between the two schools would not affect qualitatively the character of the findings,\u201d more specifically, \u201c...that this concern is not of sufficient importance to bring about any change in the prices of the factors as a result of a change in its output.\u201d In Viner's terminology\u2014now considered standard\u2014the short run is a period long enough to permit any desired output change that is technologically possible without altering the scale of the plant\u2014but is not long enough to adjust the scale of the plant. He arbitrarily assumes that all factors can, for the short run, be classified in two groups: those necessarily fixed in amount, and those freely variable. Scale of plant is the size of the group of factors that are fixed in amount in the short-run, and each scale is quantitatively indicated by the amount of output that can be produced at the lowest average cost possible at that scale. Costs associated with the fixed factors are fixed costs. Those associated with the variable factors are direct costs. Note that fixed costs are fixed only in their aggregate amounts, and vary with output in their amount per unit, while direct costs vary in their aggregate amount as output varies, as well as in their amount per unit. The spreading of overhead is therefore a short-run phenomenon and not to be confused with the long-run. He explains that if the law of diminishing returns holds that output per unit of variable factor falls as total output rises, and that if the prices of the factors remain constant\u2014then average direct costs increase with output. Also, if atomistic competition prevails\u2014that is, the individual firm output won't affect product prices\u2014then the individual firm short-run supply curve equals the short run marginal cost curve. In the long run, the supply curve for industry can be constructed by summing individual marginal cost curves abscissas. He also explains that: *Internal economies of scale are primarily a long-run phenomenon and are due either to reductions in the technical coefficients of production (technical economies=increasing productivity by improved organisation or methods of production) or to discounts resulting from larger size (pecuniary economies). *Internal diseconomies of scale can be avoided by increasing industry output by increasing the number of plants without increasing the scale of the plant. *External economies of scale are also either technical or pecuniary, but in this case are due to the aggregate behaviour of the industry, and refer to the size of output of the industry as a whole. *External diseconomies of scale may occur if as industry output rises the unit price of factors and materials rises as well due to increasing competition for inputs with other industries. It should be made clear that these long-run results only hold if producer are rational actors, that is able to optimise their production so as to have an optimal scale of plant. ==Imperfect competition and game theory== In 1929 Harold Hotelling published \"Stability in Competition\" addressing the problem of instability in the classic Cournout model: Bertrand criticised it for lacking equilibrium for prices as independent variables and Edgeworth constructed a dual monopoly model with correlated demand with also lacked stability. Hotteling proposed that demand typically varied continuously for relative prices, not discontinuously as suggested by the later authors. Following Sraffa he argued for \"the existence with reference to each seller of groups who will deal with him instead of his competitors in spite of difference in price\", he also noticed that traditional models that presumed the uniqueness of price in the market only made sense if the commodity was standardised and the market was a point: akin to a temperature model in physics, discontinuity in heat transfer (price changes) inside a body (market) would lead to instability. To show the point he built a model of market located over a line with two sellers in each extreme of the line, in this case maximising profit for both sellers leads to a stable equilibrium. From this model also follows that if a seller is to choose the location of his store so as to maximise his profit, he will place his store the closest to his competitor: \"the sharper competition with his rival is offset by the greater number of buyers he has an advantage\". He also argues that clustering of stores is wasteful from the point of view of transportation costs and that public interest would dictate more spatial dispersion. A new impetus was given to the field when around 1933 Joan Robinson and Edward H. Chamberlin, published respectively, The Economics of Imperfect Competition (1933) and The Theory of Monopolistic Competition (1933), introducing models of imperfect competition. Although the monopoly case was already exposed in Marshall's Principles of Economics and Cournot had already constructed models of duopoly and monopoly in 1838, a whole new set of models grew out of this new literature. In particular the monopolistic competition model results in a non efficient equilibrium. Chamberlin defined monopolistic competition as, \"...challenge to traditional viewpoint of economics that competition and monopoly are alternatives and that individual prices are to be explained in terms of one or the other.\" He continues, \"By contrast it is held that most economic situations are composite of both competition and monopoly, and that, wherever this is the case, a false view is given by neglecting either one of the two forces and regarding the situation as made up entirely of the other.\" Stackelberg competition represented as an extensive form game with Infinite action space. Later, some market models were built using game theory, particularly regarding oligopolies. A good example of how microeconomics started to incorporate game theory, is the Stackelberg competition model published in 1934, which can be characterised as a dynamic game with a leader and a follower, and then be solved to find a Nash Equilibrium. William Baumol provided in his 1977 paper the current formal definition of a natural monopoly where \u201can industry in which multiform production is more costly than production by a monopoly\u201d (p. 810): mathematically this equivalent to subadditivity of the cost function. He then sets out to prove 12 propositions related to strict economies of scale, ray average costs, ray concavity and transray convexity: in particular strictly declining ray average cost implies strict declining ray subadditivity, global economies of scale are sufficient but not necessary for strict ray subadditivity. In 1982 paperBaumol W., Contestable Markets: An Uprising in the Theory of Industry Structure, American Economic Review vol 72 pp. 1-15 1982 http://econ.ucdenver.edu/beckman/research/readings/baumol-contestable.pdf Baumol defined a contestable market as a market where \"entry is absolutely free and exit absolutely costless\", freedom of entry in Stigler sense: the incumbent has no cost discrimination against entrants. He states that a contestable market will never have an economic profit greater than zero when in equilibrium and the equilibrium will also be efficient. According to Baumol this equilibrium emerges endogenously due to the nature of contestable markets, that is the only industry structure that survives in the long run is the one which minimises total costs. This is in contrast to the older theory of industry structure since not only industry structure is not exogenously given, but equilibrium is reached without add hoc hypothesis on the behaviour of firms, say using reaction functions in a duopoly. He concludes the paper commenting that regulators that seek to impede entry and/or exit of firms would do better to not interfere if the market in question resembles a contestable market. ==Externalities and market failure== In 1937, \u201cThe Nature of the Firm\u201d was published by Coase introducing the notion of transaction costs (the term itself was coined in the fifties), which explained why firms have an advantage over a group of independent contractors working with each other. The idea was that there were transaction costs in the use of the market: search and information costs, bargaining costs, etc., which give an advantage to a firm that can internalise the production process required to deliver a certain good to the market. A related result was published by Coase in his \u201cThe Problem of Social Cost\u201d (1960), which analyses solutions of the problem of externalities through bargaining, in which he first describes a cattle herd invading a farmer's crop and then discusses four legal cases: Sturges v Bridgman, Cooke v Forbes, Bryant v Lejever, and Bass v Gregory. He then states: This then becomes relevant in context of regulations. He argues against the Pigovian tradition: This period also marks the beginning of mathematical modelling of public goods with Samuelson's \u201cThe Pure Theory of Public Expenditure\u201d (1954), in it he gives a set of equations for efficient provision of public goods (he called them collective consumption goods), now known as the Samuelson condition. He then gives a description of what is now called the free rider problem: Used cars market: due to presence of fundamental asymmetrical information between seller and buyer the market equilibrium is not efficient; in the language of economists it is a market failure Around the 1970s the study of market failures again came into focus with the study of information asymmetry. In particular three authors emerged from this period: Akerlof, Spence, and Stiglitz. Akerlof considered the problem of bad quality cars driving good quality cars out of the market in his classic \u201cThe Market for Lemons\u201d (1970) because of the presence of asymmetrical information between buyers and sellers. Spence explained that signaling was fundamental in the labour market, because since employers can't know beforehand which candidate is the most productive, a college degree becomes a signaling device that a firm uses to select new personnel. A synthesising paper of this era is \u201cExternalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets\u201d by Stiglitz and Greenwald: the basic model consists of households that maximise a utility function, firms that maximise profit\u2014and a government that produces nothing, collects taxes, and distributes the proceeds. An initial equilibrium with no taxes is assumed to exist, a vector x of household consumption and vector z of other variables that affect household utilities (externalities) are defined, a vector \u03c0 of profits is defined along with a vector E of households expenditures. Since the envelope theorem holds, if the initial non taxed equilibrium is Pareto optimal then it follows that the dot products \u03a0 (between \u03c0 and the time derivative of z) and B (between E and the time derivative of z) must equal each other. They state: One application of this result is to the already mentioned Market for Lemons, which deals with adverse selection: households buy from a pool of goods with heterogeneous quality considering only average quality, since in general the equilibrium is not efficient, any tax that raises average quality is beneficial (in the sense of optimal taxation). Other applications were considered by the authors, such as tax distortions, signaling, screening, moral hazard, incomplete markets, queue rationing, unemployment and rationing equilibrium. ==Behavioural economics== Asymmetric value function in prospect theory: big losses have a much bigger psychological impact than big gains Kahneman and Tversky published a paper in 1979 criticising the very idea of the rational economic agent. The main point is that there is an asymmetry in the psychology of the economic agent that gives a much higher value to losses than to gains. This article is usually regarded as the beginning of behavioural economics and has consequences particularly regarding the world of finance. The authors summed the idea in the abstract as follows: ==Great Recession and executive compensation== More recently, the Great Recession and the ongoing controversy on executive compensation brought the principal\u2013agent problem again to the centre of debate, in particular regarding corporate governance and problems with incentive structures. ==References== ==Further reading== * * Bouman, John: Principles of Microeconomics \u2013 free fully comprehensive Principles of Microeconomics and Macroeconomics texts.
