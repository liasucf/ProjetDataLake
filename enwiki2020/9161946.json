    "text": "Jeff Rosenstock (born September 7, 1982) is an American musician and songwriter from Long Island, United States. He was the lead singer of the ska punk band The Arrogant Sons of Bitches, the musical collective Bomb the Music Industry! and the indie rock band Kudrow. After the breakup of Bomb the Music Industry!, he began a solo career. ==Career== Rosenstock began his solo career in 2012 by releasing his debut solo \"mixtape\" I Look Like Shit two months after Bomb the Music Industry! had announced their intention to break up. This was followed by the Summer Seven Club project in 2013, which granted purchasers of Rosenstock's 7-inch single \"Summer\" exclusive access to new songs periodically released over the following months. All the songs from Summer Seven Club were later collected and made available as the Summer + compilation album. Rosenstock's first studio album as a solo artist, We Cool?, was released in 2015. His second solo album, entitled Worry, was released on October 14, 2016. On New Year's Day 2018, Rosenstock's third studio album POST- with 10 tracks was released in January 2018. His fourth studio album, NO DREAM, was released on May 20, 2020. Rosenstock has performed with many other ska and punk rock bands, including Mustard Plug, The Bruce Lee Band, and AJJ. He has also performed with his Bomb the Music Industry! band-mates Laura Stevenson and Lee Hartney. Some of his musical influences include Tom Waits, Pulp and The Beach Boys. Rosenstock also founded the independent record label Quote Unquote Records, which puts out all of its records for free (in keeping with Rosenstock's long time DIY ideology). He has worked as a producer for other artists such as Mikey Erg, The Smith Street Band, Laura Stevenson, and Dan Andriano. He is also a member of Antarctigo Vespucci, a collaborative project between himself and Fake Problems front man Chris Farren. Rosenstock composes the music for the Cartoon Network series Craig of the Creek. ==Discography== ;Solo ;The Arrogant Sons of Bitches ;Bomb the Music Industry! ;Pegasuses-XL *The Midnight Aquarium (2006) *XL (2006) *Pegauses-XL (2007) *The Antiphon (2008) ;Kudrow *Lando (2009) *Boo (split with Hard Girls) (2011) ;Antarctigo Vespucci *Soulmate Stuff (2014) *I'm So Tethered (2014) *Leavin' La Vida Loca (2015) *Love in the Time of E-Mail (2018) ;The Bruce Lee Band *Community Support Group (2014) *Everything Will Be Alright, My Friend (2014) *Rental!!
