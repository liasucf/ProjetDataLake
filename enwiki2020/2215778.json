Also shown is a Celtic cross, the coats of arms of the Provinces of Ireland and the words \"Sinn F\u00e9in\", \"\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann\" and \"NORAID.\" This Mural has been torn down along with the building to make way for resident housing. The Friends of Sinn F\u00e9in is the name of five different Irish republican political non-profit organisations located in Scotland, England, Wales, Canada, the United States and Australia. Sinn F\u00e9in USA, Located in New York City, is the largest and most successful.https://www.friendsofsinnfein.com/ Each FOSF is associated with the political party Sinn F\u00e9in, and works with the Irish-Scots, Irish English, Irish Canadian, Irish American and Irish Australian communities to foster good relations between the Sinn F\u00e9in party and the governments of those countries. Many Sinn F\u00e9in politicians engage in international speaking tours to raise support for their party. This was seen in 2014 in Australia, with Mary Lou McDonald TD and Francie Molloy MP visiting Australia and helping raise support with Irish Australians. The FOSF USA organisation is one of the chief fund- raising sources for Sinn F\u00e9in. In 2008 it was reported that FOSF USA remains one of the major contributors and a \"key source of funds\" for the party.Irish Times 15 August 2008 ==See also== * NORAID * Irish Republican Socialist Committees of North America * Troops Out Movement ==References== Category:Irish diaspora Category:Sinn F\u00e9in ",
