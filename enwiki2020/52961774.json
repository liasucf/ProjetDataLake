    "text": "The Cheshire Vase is an annual rugby union knock-out club competition organized by the Cheshire Rugby Football Union, and was introduced during the 2005-06 season with Anselmians being the first ever winners. The Vase is currently a stand-alone competition open to club sides based in either Cheshire, Merseyside or the Isle of Man that are ranked at tier 6 (North 1 West) and 7 (South Lancs/Cheshire 1) of the English league system. It is the second most important club competition organized by the Cheshire RFU behind the Cheshire Cup. The present format is as a knock-out cup with a quarter- final, semi-final and final which is held at a neutral venue during the latter stages of the season (March\u2013May). At present Cheshire Vase finals are held on the same date and same venue as the Cheshire Bowl final. ==Cheshire Vase winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- |colspan=\"5\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"| {| border=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- | style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"| | style=\"border:0;\"|Cheshire Vase Finals | style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"| |} |- ! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Season ! style=\"background:#efefef\"|Winner ! style=\"background:#efefef\"|Score ! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Runners\u2013up ! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Venue |- align=left |- | 2005-06 || Anselmians || 25-3 || Wirral || Bradwell Road, Sandbach |- | 2006-07 || Northwich || 10-9 || Wirral || Upper Park, Birkenhead |- | 2007-08 || Sandbach || 10-7 || Northwich || Burrows Hill, Winnington |- | 2008-09 || Wirral || 20-10 || Chester || Hartsfield, Moreton |- | 2009-10 || Northwich || 29-10 || Bowdon || Hartsfield, Moreton |- | 2010-11 || Altrincham Kersal || 51-22 || Anselmians || Crouchley Lane, Lymm |- | 2011-12 || Sandbach || 25-13 || Anselmians || Burrows Hill, Winnington |- | 2012-13 || Sale FC || 19-11 || Wirral || Memorial Ground, Wilmslow |- | 2013-14 || Altrincham Kersal || 17-13 || New Brighton || Burrows Hill, Winnington |- | 2014-15 || Wilmslow || 37-0 || Crewe & Nantwich || Burrows Hill, Winnington |- | 2015-16 || Birkenhead Park || 44-8 || Crewe & Nantwich || Bradwell Road, Sandbach |- | 2016-17 || Northwich || 36-10 || Birkenhead Park || The Vagrants Ground, Nantwich |- | 2017-18 || Wirral || 17-14 || Sandbach || Burrows Hill, Winnington |- | 2018-19 || Northwich || 24-17 || Birkenhead Park || Hartsfield, Moreton |- |} ==Number of wins== *Northwich (4) *Altrincham Kersal (2) *Sandbach (2) *Wirral (2) *Anselmians (1) *Birkenhead Park (1) *Sale FC (1) *Wilmslow (1) ==See also== * Cheshire RFU * Cheshire Cup * Cheshire Bowl * Cheshire Plate * English rugby union system * Rugby union in England ==References== ==External links== *Cheshire RFU Category:2005 establishments in England Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2005 Category:Rugby union cup competitions in England Category:Rugby union in Cheshire ",
