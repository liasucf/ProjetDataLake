    "text": "The '92 Demos is a demo collection by Local H. Originally released on cassette three years prior to their debut album, Ham Fisted, the collection was re- released by G&P; Records in 1999 and is currently only available through their website. At the time this was recorded, the band was a three-piece, with Scott Lucas on vocals and guitar, Matt Garcia on bass and Joe Daniels on drums. Two of these songs, \"User\" and \"Mayonnaise and Malaise\", would later appear on Ham Fisted after undergoing significant changes. \"Blur\" was also revisited for the band's album Twelve Angry Months. == Track listing == # \"Nothing Much At All\" \u2013 2:19 # \"Blur\" \u2013 3:03 # \"User\" \u2013 5:19 # \"No More\" \u2013 3:14 # \"Bigger\" \u2013 3:52 # \"Mayonnaise and Malaise\" \u2013 3:48 # \"Congressman\" \u2013 4:38 == Credits == * Scott Lucas \u2013 vocals, guitar * Matt Garcia \u2013 bass * Joe Daniels \u2013 drums Category:1999 compilation albums Category:Demo albums Category:Local H compilation albums Category:Self-released albums ",
