He was President of the Royal Statistical Society from 1904 to 1905. Powell died at Horton Old Hall, Yorkshire at the age of 84 and a statue of him stands in Mesnes Park in the centre of the town of Wigan. Powell married Anne Gregson of Toxteth Park, Liverpool in 1858. He had no heir to inherit the baronetcy which became extinct on his death. == Statue == The statue was restored in 2012 Ernest Gillick's statue of Sir Francis Powell stands in Mesnes Park, Wigan. Erected in his home town in 1910, the statue is made from bronze, which after turning green in colour due to lack of treatment, was restored in 2012. The statue shows Powell sat in his office chair, deep in thought. It also shows his right leg crossing in front of his left, which makes his right shoe protrude out further than the statue's base. It has long been a long-standing superstition that the rubbing of Powell's protruding shoe will bring a person good luck. Local belief in this tale is so strong that the shoe of the statue was never allowed to turn green due to the constant rubbing by locals and tourists. == References == == External links == * Category:1827 births Category:1911 deaths Category:People educated at Sedbergh School Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:UK MPs 1857\u20131859 Category:UK MPs 1859\u20131865 Category:UK MPs 1865\u20131868 Category:UK MPs 1868\u20131874 Category:UK MPs 1885\u20131886 Category:UK MPs 1886\u20131892 Category:UK MPs 1892\u20131895 Category:UK MPs 1895\u20131900 Category:UK MPs 1900\u20131906 Category:UK MPs 1906\u20131910 Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Presidents of the Royal Statistical Society Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Wigan Category:Members of the Inner Temple ",
