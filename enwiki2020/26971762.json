Robinson received her formal art training at the Columbus Art School (now the Columbus College of Art and Design). She continued to live and work in Columbus. She attended the Columbus Art School from 1957 to 1960, then studied art history and philosophy at Ohio State University (1960 to 1963), Franklin University, and Columbus' Bliss College. Robinson was christened \"Aminah\" (derived from Aamina, mother of the Islamic prophet Muhamad) by an Egyptian cleric during her visit to Africa in 1979. She changed her name legally to include the forename in 1980. She has shown at the Columbus Museum of Art,\"Interview with Aminah Robinson\", The Columbus Dispatch, Bill Mayr the Tacoma Art Museum, and the Brooklyn Museum. She died on May 22, 2015 of heart problems. == Work == Her diverse body of work ranges from drawings and woodcuts to complex sculptures made from natural and synthetic materials, such as twigs, carved leather, music boxes, and \"hogmawg,\" her own material composed of mud, grease, dyes, and glue. The artist's \"Memory Maps\" (multi-media constructions of appliqu\u00e9d cloth panels) contain \"the idea and symbols of Africa\u2014as a reservoir of culture, as the abode of spirits and inspiration for form and meanings that have traversed the great transatlantic African Diaspora to the Americas.\" Robinson had been the subject of nearly two hundred solo and group exhibitions before the 2002 retrospective, Symphonic Poem: The Art of Aminah Brenda Lynn Robinson at the Columbus Museum of Art. ==Awards== * 1984 Ohio Governor's Award for the Visual Arts *2004 MacArthur Fellows Program ==References== ==External links== *Artist's website *Aminah Brenda Lynn Robinson (1940 \u2013 ), Ask Art *Aminah Robinson (American, 1940), Artnet *Mimi Brodsky Chenfield, \"Aminah Robinson: One Artist\u2019s Ties to Folklife and Folk Art\", The Clarion, Summer 1989.
