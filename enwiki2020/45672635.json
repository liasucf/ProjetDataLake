According to George Jeffery, who called it the \"Tevfik Masjid\", the mosque is originally a Venetian building, most probably built as an inn due its resemblance to the 16th century inns of Italy.\"A description of the historic monuments of Cyprus. Studies in the archaeology and architecture of the island\" by George Jeffery, Nicosia 1918 The building had Gothic arches and engravings from the 14th century, which Muzaffer Ha\u015fmet G\u00fcrkan described as \"ornate\". After the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus, the building was converted into a mosque. In the beginning of the 18th century, the building was renovated by Said Mehmed Agha. The minaret of the mosque was demolished in 1952 as it was considered dangerous. On 6 September 1962, a large part of the mosque collapsed, killing a Greek Cypriot woman passing by. The incident caused criticism of the newly founded Nicosia Turkish Municipality, whose response was deemed insufficient. The newspaper Bozkurt described the mosque at the time as \"a building with no architectural or artistic significance, which rather served to meet the religious needs of a commercial neighborhood\". The collapse destroyed the entrance arch and other architectural elements of the mosque. In 2011, the Turkish Evkaf Department, in collaboration with the local Evkaf Administration, announced that the mosque would be restored. == References == Category:Mosques in Nicosia Category:Ottoman architecture in Cyprus ",
