    "text": "A blintz is a popular traditional Jewish cigar-shaped filled pancake of Ashkenazi Jewish origin, similar to a crepe or the Russian blin. Blintzes are commonly filled with farmer's cheese or fruit. They are traditionally served for Shavuot and, less commonly, for Chanukah and other Jewish holidays. ==Etymology== The word blintz in English comes from the Yiddish word \u05d1\u05dc\u05d9\u05e0\u05e6\u05e2 or blintse, coming from a Slavic word for pancake. The word blintz may come from palatschinke, and be derived ultimately from the Roman placenta cake. ==In popular culture== Blintzes are the subject of a famous Jewish parable, which uses the blintz as an analogy for Judaism itself, and one's own adherence to its beliefs. ==References== ==See also== *Blini *Palatschinke *Latkes *Fritas de prasa *Malawach *Atayef- a similar Sephardi Jewish dish Category:Shavuot Category:Jewish desserts Category:Hanukkah foods Category:Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine Category:Israeli cuisine ",
