    "text": "Else Gebel (July 1905 \u2013 1964) was a communist member of the German resistance to Nazism. She is particularly notable for having been the cellmate of Sophie Scholl in the Gestapo headquarters in the Wittelsbacher Palais of Munich before Scholl's execution. == Life == Else Gebel was born in Augsburg. She grew up together with her two brothers, Willy and Arno. She had a close relationship with Willy and both of them shared an apartment until 1935. Gebel's mother died when Else was aged 20. The three siblings were critical of Nazism. Until the 1938 November Pogroms, Gebel worked as chief secretary for the Jewish merchant Max Uhlfelder in Munich. Uhlfelder's department store was wasted during the Kristallnacht pogroms, and Uhlfelder himself was arrested and brought to the Dachau concentration camp. Gebel however was able to avoid trouble. Until her own arrest, she worked at the Diamalt company which produced malt extract for bakeries. Gebel and her brother Willy were members of the Aufbruch working team, and later of the communist resistance group led by Beppo R\u00f6mer and Robert Uhrig. On 20 June 1944, she was sentenced to one year and four months of forced labour in jail, and had to work as a bookkeeper for the Nazi administration. During her pre-trial custody, Gebel got to know the resistance fighter Sophie Scholl after Scholl's arrest on 18 February 1943, befriended her and engaged her in conversation. Sophie Scholl, her brother Hans and their friend Christoph Probst were sentenced to death and hurriedly executed on 22 February 1943. After World War II, Gebel kept many memories of her cell mate which were presented in film in F\u00fcnf letzte Tage (1982) and Sophie Scholl \u2013 The Final Days (2005). Else Gebel died in 1964. == Further reading == * * == References == Category:1905 births Category:1964 deaths Category:People from Augsburg Category:Communists in the German Resistance ",
