A steam rupture can occur in any high temperature pressurized system, including, but not limited to: automobile cooling systems, stationary power plants, mobile power plants, steam driven tools (such as some trip hammers), and even the delivery systems for application processes such as cleaning and fabric fullering. ==References== Category:Mechanical engineering Category:Engineering failures ",
