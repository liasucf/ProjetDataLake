    "text": "Map of diplomatic missions in Singapore This list of diplomatic missions in Singapore is made up of 71 embassies and high commissions, several foreign consular posts and 11 international organisations. It does not include honorary consuls. Countries without any forms of diplomatic representations in Singapore have accredited non-resident ambassadors or high commissioners to the island city-state. Due to the high cost of land for rent in Singapore, many countries operate their embassies or high commissions in an office unit within a commercial building. Nevertheless, there are countries that do operate their own embassies or high commissions within their own diplomatic compounds such as Australia, Brunei, China, France, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Russia, Switzerland, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States and Vietnam. Cuba is the latest country to open its embassy in Singapore on 4 November 2015.http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/cuban-embassy-opens-its- doorshttp://www.embassypages.com/missions/embassy15175/ ==Resident foreign Embassies and High Commissions== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Country !width=275px | Address !Image !Website |- | Angola |9 Temasek Boulevard #17-02, Suntec Tower 2 |150px |Embassy of Angola in Singapore |- | Argentina |7 Temasek Boulevard, Suntec Tower One #15-03 | |Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Argentina |- | Australia |25 Napier Road | |High Commission of Australia in Singapore |- | Austria |600 North Bridge Road, #24-04/05 Parkview Square |150px |Embassy of Austria in Singapore |- | Bangladesh |Jit Poh Building 19 Keppel Road, #10-00 & #04-00 | |High Commission of Bangladesh in Singapore |- | Belgium |#14-01 AXA Tower, 8 Shenton Way |150px |Embassy of Belgium in Singapore |- | Brazil |101 Thomson Road, #29-01/03 United Square | |Embassy of Brazil in Singapore |- | Brunei |325 Tanglin Road | | |- | Cambodia |400 Orchard Road, #10-03/04 Orchard Towers |150px |Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Cambodia: Singapore |- | Canada |One George Street, #11-01 |150px |High Commission of Canada in Singapore |- | Chile |8 Temasek Boulevard \u2013 #24-01 \u2013 Suntec Tower Three |150px |Embassy of Chile in Singapore |- | China |150 Tanglin Road | |Embassy of China in Singapore |- | Colombia |152 Beach Road #03-04 Gateway East |150px |Embassy of Colombia in Singapore |- | Costa Rica | 896 Dunearn Road, #03-02B Sime Darby Centre | |Embassy of Costa Rica in Singapore |- | Cuba |390 Havelock Road, #08-04 King's Centre | | |- | Denmark |101 Thomson Road, #13-01/02 United Square | | |- | East Timor |3 Killiney Road, #04-09 Winsland House I | | |- | Egypt |101 Thomson Road, #13-01/02 United Square | |Embassy of Egypt in Singapore |- | Finland |101 Thomson Road, #
