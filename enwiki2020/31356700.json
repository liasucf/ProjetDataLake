When he was 16 his father died and he then supported the other 12 children in the family by becoming a badkhn himself, using his father's writings (scripts). Prizament wrote for Gershom Bader's Der yidisher folks-kalendar and began writing songs and instrumental music for Yiddish theatre. He is known as a transitional figure since he also wrote for the last of the broder-zingers - Salcia Weinberg, Jule Glantz, Helena Geshpas and Pepi Litman (1874\u20131930), characterized as \"a Jewish chanteuse in Hasidic trousers\", for whom he wrote Lomir beyde davenen fun eyn makhzer (Let\u2019s Both Pray from One Prayer Book). He later collected and arranged songs from other surviving Broder Singers. Bin ikh mir a klezmerl (I\u2019m a Little Musician) was also written in that genre.http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/printarticle.aspx?id=2195 YIVO encyclopedia ==Later career== Prizament also acted, directed, and wrote plays and song, both music and lyrics.

His first acting role was in Jacob Mikhailovich Gordin's Yiddish King Lear and he stuck with acting, spending less time directing orchestras. In 1910 he was made director of the Ukrainska Besida Theater but soon left again to travel Galitsia with wandering theater troupes, thence to Argentina where he wrote in Yidisher Soykher (Jewish Merchant) In 1912 he played as a comic and directed under Meltzer in Romania and worked with Zigmund Faynman in Gordin's repertory company. During the Romanian Bulgarian war foreigners were expelled from Romania; Prizament went back to Galitsia and traveled with the Glimer troupe and his brother, Jacob Prizament, until the outbreak of the first World War. He was a soldier on the Italian and Russian fronts and arrived in Vienna in 1918 where he opened a Yiddish theater called \"Bemishn Hof\" - but after losing a permit to play he moved on to Budapest and joined the troupe \"Shtramer, Rabinovitsh, Vayts, Sheyn\" and played until Mikl\u00f3s Horthy's regime forbade Yiddish theater. He went back to Vienna and opened a Miniature-Theater and composed, with Avish Meysels, a version of the Golem of Prague. In 1923 he began touring Bratislava, Czechoslovakia and Poland, working in the HaOr troupe.

In 1928 he worked in the Azazel-Sambatiyon ensemble as music director, and then worked in Romania, where he played in theaters and kleynkunst productions, then going back to Vienna and then Poland.
