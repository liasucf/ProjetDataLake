    "text": "This article aims to give a historical outline of liberalism in Germany. The liberal parties dealt with in the timeline below are, largely, those which received sufficient support at one time or another to have been represented in parliament. Not all parties so included, however, necessarily labeled themselves \"liberal\". The sign \u21d2 denotes another party in that scheme. ==Background== The early high points of liberalism in Germany were the Hambacher Fest (1832) and the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. In the National Assembly in the Frankfurt Paulskirche (1848/1849), the bourgeois liberal factions Casino and W\u00fcrttemberger Hof (the latter led by Heinrich von Gagern) were the majority. They favored a constitutional monarchy, popular sovereignty, and parliamentary rule. Organized liberalism developed in the 1860s, combining the previous liberal and democratic currents. Between 1867 and 1933 liberalism was divided into progressive liberal and national liberal factions. Since 1945 only one liberal party has been significant in politics at the national level: The Free Democratic Party (Freie Demokratische Partei, member LI), ELDR. ==History== ===From German Progress Party to German State Party=== *1861: Liberals united in the German Progress Party (Deutsche Fortschrittspartei) *1867: The moderate faction seceded as the \u21d2 National Liberal Party *1868: A radical South German faction seceded as the \u21d2 Democratic People's Party *1884: The party merged with the \u21d2 Liberal Union into the German Freeminded Party (Deutsche Freisinnige Partei) *1893: The party split in the Freeminded People's Party (Freisinnige Volkspartei) and the \u21d2 Freeminded Union (Freisinnige Vereinigung) *1910: The FVP merged with the \u21d2 Freeminded Union and the \u21d2 German People's Party into the Progressive People's Party (Fortschrittliche Volkspartei) *1918: The party is reorganised into the German Democratic Party (Deutsche Demokratische Partei), incorporating parts of the \u21d2 National Liberal Party *1930: The DDP in an attempt to survive reorganised itself into the German State Party (Deutsche Staatspartei) *1933: The party is forced to dissolve itself ===German People's Party (1868)=== *1868: A radical faction of the \u21d2 German Progress Party formed the German People's Party (Deutsche Volkspartei) *1910: The DVP merged into the \u21d2 Progressive People's Party ===National Liberal Party / German People's Party (1918)=== National Liberals *1867: A right-wing faction of the \u21d2 German Progress Party formed the National Liberal Party (Nationalliberale Partei) *1871: A conservative faction of NLP formed the Imperial Liberal Party (Liberale Reichspartei) *1880: A left-wing faction seceded as the \u21d2 Liberal Union *1918: The NLP is reorganised into the German People's Party (Deutsche Volkspartei), part of the party joined the German Democratic Party *1933: The party is dissolved ===Liberal Union=== *1880: A left-wing faction of the \u21d2 National Liberal Party formed the Liberal Union (Liberale Vereinigung) *1884: The party merged with the \u21d2 German Progress Party into the \u21d2 German Freeminded Party ===Freeminded Union=== *1893: The \u21d2 German Freeminded Party split into the Freeminded Union (Freisinnige Vereinigung) and the \u21d2 Freeminded People's Party *1903: The \u21d2 National Social Union joined the Freeminded Union *1908: A left-wing faction seceded as the \u21d2 Democratic Union *1910: The party merged into the \u21d2 Progressive People's Party ===National Social Union=== *1896: The National Social Union (Nationalsozialer Verein) is formed *1903: The party is dissolved and members joined the \u21d2 Freeminded Union ===Democratic Union=== *1908: A left-wing faction of the \u21d2 Freeminded Union formed the Democratic Union (Demokratische Vereinigung) *1918: The remnants of the Union joined the German Democratic Party ===From Liberal Democratic Party of Germany to Alliance of Free Democrats (GDR)=== *1945: Liberals in East Germany re- organised themselves into the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (Liberal- Demokratische Partei Deutschlands).
