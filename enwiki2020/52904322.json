    "text": "The FC Basel 1903\u201304 season was their eleventh season in their existence. Basel were the second largest club in Switzerland at this time. The club's chairman was Ernst-Alfred Thalmann, who took over the chairmanship for the third time in the club's history. FC Basel played their home games in the Landhof in the Quarter Kleinbasel. == Overview == The Swiss Serie A season 1903\u201304 was divided into three regional groups, east, central and west. Basel were allocated to the central group together with the Young Boys, FC Bern, Floria Biel/Bienne, and two further teams from Basel Old Boys Basel and Fortuna Basel. FC Basel ended their ten games with five victories, two draws and three defeats in third position in the league table, obtaining 12 points, scoring 28 and conceding 25 goals. The Young Boys and the Old Boys ended level on points and so a play-off match was arranged. The Old Boys won the play-off 3\u20132 and therefore qualified for the finals, in which FC St. Gallen won their first championship title. Daniel Hug (the team's most prominent, their best and their largest player) was named as team captain. Together with goalkeeper Hofer, the players Schorpp, Strauss, Pfeiffer, Thalmann and Hasler, Hug was one of many early national team players who came from the Basel team. == Players == == Results == === Serie A === ==== Central group league table ==== ==See also== * History of FC Basel * List of FC Basel players * List of FC Basel seasons == Sources and references == * Rotblau: Jahrbuch Saison 2014/2015.
