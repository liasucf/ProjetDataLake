    "text": "Fatma Sultan (; 22 September 1704 \u2013 4 January 1733), was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Ahmed III and his wife Emetullah Kad\u0131n. She was the wife of Grand Viziers Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha, and Nev\u015fehirli Damat Ibrahim Pasha. She is considered to have been politically active and influential on the affairs of state during the late Tulip era (1703\u20131730). ==Early life== Fatma Sultan was born on 22 September 1704 in the Topkap\u0131 Palace. Her father was Sultan Ahmed III, and her mother was Emetullah Kad\u0131n. She was the eldest child and daughter born to her father. ==First marriage== In 1709, at the age of four, Ahmed betrothed her to Silahdar (\u015eehid) Ali Pasha. The wedding took place on 11 May 1709, until 16 May in the Topkap\u0131 Palace. In the meantime, Silahdar Ali Pasha was given the rank of vizier and kaymakam. On 16 May, Fatma was taken from the Topkap\u0131 Palace to the Valide Sultan's palace in Ey\u00fcp, which was allocated for the wedding. The wedding lasted until 20 May. Silahdar Ali Pasha became Grand Vizier in 1713. However, he died in 1716, when Fatma was twelve years old. ==Second marriage== In 1717, when Fatma was thirteen, Ahmed arranged her marriage to Nev\u015fehirli Ibrahim Pasha. The wedding took place on 22 February 1717 in Edirne. Ibrahim Pasha was fifty years old at that time, and had divorced his first wife in order to marry the princess. Just over a year later, Ibrahim Pasha took over as grand vezir on 9 May 1718. By 1724 Ibrahim Pasha and Fatma had several palaces at different locations. Following their marriage in 1717, the one across from the Kiosk of Processions on the landwalls of the Topkap\u0131 Palace, which had long housed many grand vezirs, grew into a monumental complex as Ibrahim Pasha and Fatma continued to annex nearby palaces, and busied themselves with restoring and rebuilding them. Ibrahim Pasha stated his longing for Fatma Sultan with a poem. Pasha explains this love and sorrow in one place: She was described as having had a large political influence on both her father, who left the ruling to her husband, and on her husband, the Grand Vizier. Some sources regard her as the real ruler of the later part of the Tulip era. She was said to have assisted the Marquis de Villeneuve, French ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1728\u20131741, in favour of an Ottoman policy benefitting to French interests during the Russo-Austrian-Turkish War (1735\u20131739). She has been referred to as the last de facto female ruler of the Ottoman Empire. The couple spent several happy and affluent years during the notorious for its splendidness and lavishness Tulip Age (L\u00e2le Devri) which became the symbol of the reign of Sultan Ahmed III. The two together had a son named Mehmed Bey who died in 1737. Fatma Sultan was widowed in 1730, when her husband Ibrahim Pasha, who was sixty-four years old, was killed during the Patrona Halil revolt, which led to the deposition of her father Sultan Ahmed. She was twenty-six years old. ==Charities== In 1727, Fatma Sultan commissioned a fountain near the Ibrahim Pasha Palace, which bears her name. In 1728, she also commissioned a fountain near the Cedid Valide Sultan Mosque in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar. During her lifetime she founded waqfs in the capital bequeathing m\u00fclk properties she had received from her father. There is no trace left from the Fatma Sultan Mosque, which was built in the Emin\u00f6n\u00fc district in Istanbul, opposite the current Vil\u00e2yet (former B\u00e2ba\u015f\u0131) building. While Nev\u015fehirli Ibrahim Pasha built a palace near this masjid, Fatma Sultan repaired the mosque and added from the land of her palace and built a large mosque. According to a judgment from an archive document determined by Ahmed Refik, on 20 October 1727, in Rumeli, in the district of Pasha, in the Berkof\u00e7a suburb, \u00c7etrof\u00e7a and Tev\u00e2bii, the monastery and Florina in the sub-districts 60.000 It is learned that the Zagori\u00e7a and its repentance mutatas, which are the property of ak\u00e7e, were allocated from the Hav\u00e2ss-\u0131 H\u00fcmay\u0131 to be devoted to be devoted to the mosque. This provision, which was written four days before the opening of the mosque to the Berkof\u00e7a and Monastir women, fits exactly with the date of its construction. ==Death== Fatma Sultan died at the age of twenty eight on 4 January 1733, and was buried in the mausoleum of Turhan Sultan in New Mosque, Istanbul. ==See also== * List of Ottoman princesses ==In popular culture== *In the 2012 Turkish historical television series Bir Zamanlar Osmanl\u0131: K\u0131yam, Fatma Sultan is portrayed by Turkish actress Leyla G\u00f6ksun. ==Ancestry== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * Category:1704 births Category:Daughters of Ottoman sultans Category:18th- century Ottoman royalty Category:1733 deaths Category:18th-century women of the Ottoman Empire ",
