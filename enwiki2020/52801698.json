    "text": "Il Frontespizio (meaning The Frontispiece in English) was an Italian art and literary magazine, which had a Catholic perspective. The magazine existed between 1929 and 1940. ==History and profile== Il Frontespizio was first published in May 1929. The founders were Enrico Lucatello and Piero Bargellini. Giovanni Papini was also instrumental in its establishment. The headquarters of Il Frontespizio was in Florence. From August 1929 the magazine became monthly, but it rarely published double issues. Vallecchi was the publisher of the magazine from July 1930 to its closure in 1940. The founding editor was Enrico Lucatello, who was succeeded by Piero Bargellini in the post. Although it targeted Catholic intellectuals, who had been alienated from public life since the Unification of Italy in 1861, its goal was not to disseminate Catholic art. Instead, it aimed at being an alternative to avant- gardism and fascist culture in Italy. It adopted an anti-Semitic approach. The magazine started the Hermetic poetry in Italy through the work by Carlo Bo, a literary critic, Mario Luzi and Piero Bigongiari. Giuseppe de Luca, a priest, was among the regular contributors. It also covered the work by Italian sculptures, including Bartolini, Carlo Carr\u00e0, Felice Casorati, De Pisis, Mino Maccari, Manzu, Giorgio Morandi, Ottone Rosai, Semeghini, Severini, Soffici, and Lorenzo Viani. Il Frontespizio is the recipient of the best graphic work award at the Milan Triennale in 1935. The magazine ended publication in 1940. ==References== Category:1929 establishments in Italy Category:1940 disestablishments in Italy Category:Antisemitism in Italy Category:Antisemitic publications Category:Catholic magazines published in Italy Category:Defunct literary magazines published in Italy Category:Fascist newspapers and magazines Category:Italian-language magazines Category:Magazines established in 1929 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1940 Category:Mass media in Florence Category:Monthly magazines published in Italy Category:Poetry literary magazines Category:Visual arts magazines ",
