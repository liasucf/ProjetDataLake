    "text": "Paramanandayya Sishyula Katha () is a 1966 Indian Telugu-language swashbuckler film, produced by Thota Subba Rao under the Sridevi Productions banner and directed by C. Pullayya. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, K. R. Vijaya with music composed by Ghantasala. The film was earlier made in Telugu in 1950 as Paramanandayya Sishyulu starring Akkineni Nageswara Rao and Lakshmi Rajyam in pivotal roles. The movie was remade in Kannada in 1981 as Guru Shishyaru. ==Plot== The plot is based on the story of the Disciples (Sishya) of Paramanandayya, seven saints in number. They are actually the disciples of Aruna Keerti Mahamuni. Chitralekha (K. R. Vijaya) dances in the court of Lord Siva (Sobhan Babu). He gives her a Rudraksha mala to wear during the visits. Later, she visits the beautiful Earth with her companions and enjoys bathing in a pool. She finds these Sishiyas keenly looking at her and curses them to become fools. After knowing the facts from Guruji and realizing her mistake, she pronounces the Vimukti (free from curse) at the time of her marriage. The Guru, Aruna Keerti, in return curses Chitralekha that she will lose her celestial status if she comes into contact with a human. He advises the Sishyas to go to Rajaguru (Principle Court Spiritual Adviser) Paramanandayya (Chittoor V. Nagaiah) at Vijayadurgam, ruled by Nandivardhana Maharaju (N. T. Rama Rao). Paramanandayya accepts them as his disciples. Chitralekha forgets the Rudraksha mala while returning to Heaven. The mala is accidentally found by the Maharajah when he comes to hunt in the forest. Chitralekha remembers her mala, and goes to the palace as a snake and tries to steals the mala. However, Maharajah dreaming about the Devakanya (a celestial maiden) touches Chitralekha, who loses her divine powers and past memory. Maharajah calls Paramanandayya for advice. He tells the Rajah to hand over the mala to her, making her regain the sequence of events. He advises her to pray to Lord Siva to attain divinity (so she can go back to Heaven). Meanwhile, whatever the Sishiyas do out of ignorance turns out to be a good thing for the Paramanandayya family. They save them from thieves etc. Finally, they decided to die as Guruji strongly scolded them for purchasing a dead cow. They eat Vishapu Undalu and go to the streets. Night patrolling, Rajabhat takes them to the Royal Court. They thought Maharaja as Indra and Ranjani (Vijayalakshmi) as an Apsara. They reach the house of Ranjani and makes the Maharajah know the criminal plans of the Minister. The Sishyas spoiled the marriage of daughter Girija with the tuberculosis patient and saved Paramanandayya from another family crisis. Ousted by Guruji, they reach RajaMahal and spoil an attempt to kill Maharaja by Jaggarayudu (Satyanarayana) and Minister (Mukkamala). They convinced Chitralekha to marry the Maharajah. During the marriage ceremony, they are released from the curse and regain their sainthood. ==Cast== *N. T. Rama Rao as Nandivardhana Maharaju *K. R. Vijaya as Chitralekha *L.
