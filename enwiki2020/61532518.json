Clausing is known for her work on international trade and tax policy, particularly the taxation of multinational corporations. ==Education== Clausing graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. from Carleton College in 1991. She then attended Harvard University and received an M.A. in economics in 1993. She received her Ph.D. in economics from Harvard in 1996 with a thesis titled Essays in International Economic Integration. From 1994 to 1995, she worked as a staff economist at the Council of Economic Advisers. After earning her Ph.D, at the age of 25, she started teaching economics at Reed College. From 2006 to 2007, she worked as an associate professor at Wellesley College. ==Career and contributions== A leading expert on the taxation of multinational firms, Clausing studies international tax incentives, base erosion and profit shifting, tax inversion, and their connections to international trade. She has received two Fulbright Research awards, one to the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels in 1999 and one to the Eastern Mediterranean University and the University of Cyprus in 2012. Clausing has worked on economic policy research with the International Monetary Fund, the Hamilton Project, the Brookings Institution and the Tax Policy Center, and she has testified before the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Committee on Finance. She has been a prominent critic of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, arguing that \"the bill replies to decades of worsening income inequality with arguably the most regressive tax policy change of our lifetimes\" and that \"the bill answers our huge problem of multinational company profit shifting by increasing the incentive to offshore.\" Clausing has provided informal policy advice to Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, a long-time supporter of tax reform. Since 2017, she has been an Opinion Contributor for The Hill. In March 2019, Clausing published her first book, Open: The Progressive Case for Free Trade, Immigration, and Global Capital. ==Selected works== * * * * * * * * * ==References== ==External links== * Kimberly Clausing's home page * Curriculum Vitae of Kimberly Clausing * Publications by Kimberly Clausing * FT Podcast Alphachat: Kimberly Clausing makes the case for open economies * Vox Weeds Podcast, A Progressive Case for Globalism * Brookings Event: Kimberly Clausing: The progressive case for free trade and globalization Category:21st-century American economists Category:American women economists Category:Economists from Illinois Category:Fulbright Scholars Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Carleton College alumni Category:People from Champaign, Illinois Category:Reed College faculty Category:Educators from Portland, Oregon Category:Living people Category:1970 births ",
