    "text": "In algebra, an augmentation ideal is an ideal that can be defined in any group ring. If G is a group and R a commutative ring, there is a ring homomorphism \\varepsilon, called the augmentation map, from the group ring R[G] to R, defined by taking a (finiteWhen constructing , we restrict to only finite (formal) sums) sum \\sum r_i g_i to \\sum r_i. (Here r_i\\in R and g_i\\in G.) In less formal terms, \\varepsilon(g)=1_R for any element g\\in G, \\varepsilon(r) = r for any element r\\in R, and \\varepsilon is then extended to a homomorphism of R-modules in the obvious way. The augmentation ideal is the kernel of \\varepsilon and is therefore a two-sided ideal in R[G]. is generated by the differences g - g' of group elements. Equivalently, it is also generated by \\\\{g - 1 : g\\in G\\\\}, which is a basis as a free R-module. For R and G as above, the group ring R[G] is an example of an augmented R-algebra. Such an algebra comes equipped with a ring homomorphism to R. The kernel of this homomorphism is the augmentation ideal of the algebra. The augmentation ideal plays a basic role in group cohomology, amongst other applications. ==Examples of Quotients by the Augmentation Ideal== * Let G a group and \\mathbb{Z}[G] the group ring over the integers. Let I denote the augmentation ideal of \\mathbb{Z}[G]. Then the quotient is isomorphic to the abelianization of G, defined as the quotient of G by its commutator subgroup. * A complex representation V of a group G is a \\mathbb{C}[G] \\- module. The coinvariants of V can then be described as the quotient of V by IV, where I is the augmentation ideal in \\mathbb{C}[G]. * Another class of examples of augmentation ideal can be the kernel of the counit \\varepsilon of any Hopf algebra. ==Notes== ==References== * *Dummit and Foote, Abstract Algebra Category:Ideals Category:Hopf algebras ",
