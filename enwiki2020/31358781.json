    "text": "\"Trouble\" is a song by the British new wave and synth-pop band Heaven 17, released in 1987 as the second and final single from their fourth studio album Pleasure One. It was written and produced by Glenn Gregory, Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware. The song peaked at No. 51 in the UK and spent four weeks on the chart. It was a bigger success in Germany where it reached No. 17. A music video was filmed to promote the single. The 12\" single re-titled as \"(Big) Trouble\". ==Critical reception== Upon release, Lesley O'Toole of Record Mirror wrote: \"Once upon a time, if you didn't own a copy of \"Fascist Groove Thang\", you were much too untrendy to be seen associating with. Since then, Heaven 17 have cobbled together the odd pearl of synthesised wisdom, but with decreasing regularity. \"Trouble\" does little to alleviate fears that the rot is setting in, being just another mish-mash of unexciting keyboard riffs and irritatingly distinctive Glenn Gregory mouthings.\" Aaron Badgley of AllMusic said in a review of Pleasure One: \"Some of the Pleasure One songs are among their best, including the wonderful \"Trouble\" and the opening track, \"Contenders.\" The guitar work in \"Trouble\" makes the song itself.\" ==Formats== ;7\" single #\"Trouble\" - 4:00 #\"Move Out\" - 3:19 ;12\" single #\"(Big) Trouble\" - 5:49 #\"Trouble (LP version)\" - 4:17 #\"Move Out\" - 3:19 ;12\" single (promo) #\"Trouble (At Mill Mix)\" - 6:42 #\"(Big) Trouble (Vocal)\" - 5:49 ;12\" single (limited edition gatefold) #\"(Big) Trouble (Extended Mix)\" - 5:51 #\"Move Out (Album Mix)\" - 3:20 #\"Trouble (U.S. Club Mix)\" - 6:45 #\"Contenders (U.S. Club Mix)\" - 7:47 ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1987) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|German Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|17 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|51 |} ==Personnel== ;Heaven 17 * Glenn Gregory - lead vocals, backing vocals, producer, arranger, mixing, engineer * Martyn Ware - sampler (Emulator II), Mellotron, SP 12 Programming, producer, arranger, mixing, engineer * Ian Craig Marsh - Fairlight programming, producer, arranger, mixing, engineer ;Additional personnel * Tim Cansfield - guitar * Phil Spalding - bass * Brian Tench - mixing * Tim Hunt - engineer * Bruce Forest - remixes of \"Trouble (At Mill Mix)\", \"Contenders (U.S. Club Mix)\" and \"Trouble (U.S. Club Mix)\" * Heaven 17, Assorted Images - sleeve design * Peter Anderson - photography ==References== ==External links== * Category:1987 singles Category:1987 songs Category:Heaven 17 songs Category:Songs written by Martyn Ware Category:Songs written by Glenn Gregory Category:Songs written by Ian Craig Marsh ",
