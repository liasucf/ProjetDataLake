    "text": "Glasnevin railway station is a proposed railway station to be built on the Western Commuter and South Western Commuter lines in Dublin, Ireland as part of the MetroLink project. Proposed plans, published in early 2019, suggested that the station would be sited between the two branches of the Western Commuter service and would provide interchange between these and the Metrolink line. This site is near, but not on, the location of the original 1901-1910 Glasnevin station which served one of the two current lines. ==References== Category:Proposed railway stations in the Republic of Ireland ",
