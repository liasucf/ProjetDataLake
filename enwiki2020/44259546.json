    "text": "The Union Wesley Methodist Episcopal Church Complex is a historic church and summer camp meeting facility on Powell Farm Road near Clarksville, Delaware. The property was developed in the post-Civil War era as a summer religious camp for African Americans. It was established around 1873, with open tabernacle-like structure for religious functions, surrounded by modest cottages. An 1890 one-room schoolhouse that was used in the education of African-American children was adapted as the camp's refectory in 1922, and in 1959 the Union Wesley Methodist Episcopal Church was built on the property. The school building in particular is notable as one of the best-preserved late 19th-century schools for African-Americans in the state. The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Sussex County, Delaware ==References== Category:Methodist churches in Delaware Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Delaware Category:Churches completed in 1873 Category:19th-century Methodist church buildings in the United States Category:Churches in Sussex County, Delaware Category:National Register of Historic Places in Sussex County, Delaware ",
