It arises from the reaction of ammonia and mercuric chloride. Addition of base converts it into \"Millon's base\", which has the formula [Hg2N]OH\u00b7(H2O)x. A variety of related amido and nitrido materials with chloride, bromide, and hydroxide are known. Before the toxicity of mercury was appreciated, mercuric amidochloride, known as \"ammoniated mercury\", was used as a topical antiseptic and disinfectant.http://www.huidziekten.nl/allergie/stoffen/mercury-ammonium- chloride.htm Eli Lilly & Company - Ointment No. 8 - Ammoniated Mercury 10% ==See also== * Merbromin, also known as \"Mercurochrome\", another antiseptic mercury compound * Thiomersal, another antiseptic mercury compound * * Millon's base ==References== Category:Mercury(II) compounds Category:Chlorides Category:Metal amides ",
