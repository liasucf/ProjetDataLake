    "text": "Jakarta XML RPC (JAX-RPC; formerly Java API for XML Based RPC) allows a Jakarta EE application to invoke a Java-based web service with a known description while still being consistent with its WSDL description. JAX-RPC is one of the Java XML programming APIs. It can be seen as Java RMIs over web services. JAX-RPC 2.0 was renamed JAX-WS 2.0 (Java API for XML Web Services). JAX-RPC 1 is deprecated with Java EE 6.JAX-WS vs. JAX-RPC - stackoverflow.com The JAX-RPC service utilizes W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standards like WSDL or Web Service Description Language.What is JAX-RPC - qwhatis.com The core API classes are located in the Java package . * Supports web-based services and clients using RPC or remote procedure calls which are based on XML. * Allow for web service accessibility through Java APIs which in turn allows for communication between different Java applications. * Enables client communication with web service of different language and running on separate platform. It works as follows: #A Java program executes a method on a stub (local object representing the remote service) #The stub executes routines in the JAX-RPC Runtime System (RS) #The RS converts the remote method invocation into a SOAP message #The RS transmits the message as an HTTP request The advantage of such a method is that it allows the Web service to be implemented at server-side as a Servlet or EJB container. Thus, Servlet or EJB applications are made available through Web services. ==References== ==External links== * *JAX-RPC 2.0 renamed to JAX-WS 2.0 Category:Java API for XML Category:Web service specifications Category:Java enterprise platform ",
