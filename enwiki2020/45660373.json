    "text": "right Alma Mater is a role-playing game published by Oracle Games in 1982. ==Description== Alma Mater is a humorous and anarchic system of role-playing high school students. Character classes include types like Brain, Cheerleader, Criminal, Jock, and Loser; other sections cover social rules, chemistry (explosives, etc.), alcohol and drugs, combat, and a section on academics. The game includes an introductory scenario. ==Publication history== Alma Mater was designed by Steve Davis and Andrew Warden, with art by Erol Otus, and published by Oracle Games in 1982 as a 48-page book with a color poster. ==Reception== J. David George reviewed Alma Mater in The Space Gamer No. 58. George commented that \"Despite the fact that Alma Mater is built on a workable and innovative set of rules, its subject matter is likely to prevent most campaigns from lasting more than a session or two.\" Lawrence Schick comments that \"The illustrations (by the notorious Erol Otus) are in such poor taste that the game was actually banned at GenCon!\" ==Reviews== * Different Worlds (Issue 26 - Jan 1983) ==References== Category:Comedy role-playing games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1982 ",
