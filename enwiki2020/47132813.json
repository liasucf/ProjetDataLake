In 1904, he was trained in the studio of Francesco Bergamini, a former pupil of Michele Cammarano. The following year he attended the Scuola Libera del Nudo and at the Accademia di Francia. He first exhibited at the 1907 Exhibition (LXXVII Esposizione Internazionale di Belle Arti) in Rome. In 1910, he won a scholarship to the Instituto Catel which allowed him to take up art as a career. In 1913, he exhibited Genetrix at the First Roman Secession Exhibition (Prima Esposizione internazionale d'arte della Secessione Romana). In December, he was granted the national art pension which gave him financial security and allowed him to set up a studio in Via Ripetta. A visit to the Louvre in Paris revealed his interest in Georges Seurat whose style was similar to his own. In 1926, he became a professor at the Accademia di San Luca. The same year he was the first Italian to win the Carnegie Prize. In the spring of 1933, he was elected to the Italian Academy. After the war, he created mainly religious works, both paintings and sculptures. In the 1950s, he spent most of his time at the Casa di Santo Stefano in Monte Argentario where he created his ambient sculpture Il Teatro della Vita (The Theatre of Life). After taking an early interest in Futurism, Ferrazzi finally moved back to Neoclassicism. He is remembered in particular for his interest in encaustic painting which he used in his murals. Giovanni Stradone was his pupil.Strad\u00f3ne, Giovanni at Treccani ==References== ==External links== *Illustrated biography from Scuola Romana (in Italian) Category:1891 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Artists from Rome Category:20th-century Italian sculptors Category:Italian male sculptors Category:20th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters ",
