She was wrecked in 1809. ==Danish origins== S\u00f8ormen was built in Copenhagen to a design by Ernst Stibolt. She was launched on 13 November 1789.Danish Naval Museum records - accessed 9 April 2011 but see note below S\u00f8ormen was designated as a mail boat [hence the Danish \"kongensb\u00e5d\" or \"kongenjagt\" \u2013 king\u2019s boat or king\u2019s sloop \u2013 in the record], and armed for self-defence. Until August 1808 the Danes considered such vessels non-combatants. Captain Trampe, in command of a sister ship (\u00d8rnen) in the postal service based in Kors\u00f8r, was reprimanded for putting his ship in harm's way when he captured a British barge in the Great Belt later that month. However, Frederick VI of Denmark later approved Trampe's action.From Danish website ==Capture== The Spanish Division of the North sent to fight the British in Denmark pledging to turn against France and side with the British When word of the uprising of the Spanish against the French in 1808 reached Denmark, some 12,000 Spanish troops of the Division of the North stationed in Denmark and under the Marquis de la Romana decided that they wished to leave French service and return to Spain. The Marquis contacted Rear-Admiral Keats, on , who was in command of a small British squadron in the Kattegat. They agreed a plan and on 9 August 1808 the Spaniards seized the fort and town of Nyborg. Keats then prepared to take possession of the port and to organize the departure of the Spanish. Keats informed the Danish authorities that if they did not impede the operation he would spare the town. The Danes agreed, except for the captains of two small Danish warships in the harbour. On 11 August Keats sent in the boats from , under the command of her captain, James Macnamara. The boats captured the brig , of 18 guns and under the command of Otto Frederick Rasch, and the cutter S\u00f8ormen, of 12 guns and under the command of Th\u00f8ger Emil Rosen\u00f8rn. Despite the odds Rasch and Rosen\u00f8rn decided to resist.Translation from the Danish websites and . British losses were an officer killed and two men wounded; the Danes lost seven men killed and 13 wounded before they struck. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issue of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"11 Aug. Boat Service 1808\" to all surviving claimants of the action.Mayo (1897), Vol. 2, p.304. The British organized the evacuation of the Spanish troops using some 50 or so local boats. Some 10,000 troops returned to Spain via Britain. Not all the Spaniards got away. Two squadrons of Spanish cavalry based as far away as Horsens on Jutland tried, on 10 August 1808, to make their way to Nyborg, but were stopped at the Little Belt crossing where Danish and French troops had reacted quickly to prevent further deserters crossing to the island of Funen. (from Danish website) The British commissioned the cutter under the name Salorman and appointed Lieutenant Andrew Duncan to command her. ==Fate== On 22 December 1808, Salorman was part of the escort of the last British convoy of the year leaving the Baltic. She was in company with four other British warships - the frigate , the brig-sloop Fama, the brig-sloop , and the gun-brig - three Swedish naval vessels and twelve merchant vessels.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 21, Jan-Jul 1809, pp.251-2.The Naval Chronicle lists the gun-brig as Ardent, but there was no gun-brig by that name and other sources give the name as Urgent. It is difficult to read the name of the cutter but it appears to be Sacorner. Unfortunately, the convoy left after an unusually severe winter had set in. Furthermore, a storm coming from the north drove already formed ice onto the convoy.Ross (1838), Vol. 2, p.130. A storm washed one man on Salorman overboard and damaged her yards and rigging. Duncan steered her towards Ystad, Sweden, but a blinding snowstorm developed that obliterated the sight of land. She grounded at about 4 am on 23 December, a little east of Ystad. In the morning boats came out from the town and salvaged what they could. By nightfall it was clear that Salorman was unrecoverable and her crew abandoned her. Next morning she was discovered to be full of water up to her gunwales. The convoy and its escorts were ill-fated, with Magnet and Fama also being lost, as were most of the merchantmen, many of which the Danes captured or destroyed. ==Notes, citations, and references== Notes Citations *Individual record cards in Danish for ships of the Danish Royal Navy can no longer (Feb 2013) be found at the internet site Orlogmuseet Skibregister.
