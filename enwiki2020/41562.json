She won many accolades, including three Academy Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award, four Golden Globe Awards, and a BAFTA Award. Bergman was born in Stockholm to a Swedish father and a German mother, and started her acting career in Swedish and German films. Her introduction to Americans came in the English-language remake of Intermezzo (1939). In addition to Casablanca (1942), Bergman's notable performances from the 1940s include the dramas For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), Gaslight (1944), The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), and Joan of Arc (1948), all of which earned her nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress; she won the award for Gaslight. She made three films with Alfred Hitchcock including Spellbound (1945) and Notorious (1946). In 1950, she starred in Roberto Rossellini's Stromboli, following the revelation that she was having an extramarital affair with the director. The affair and then marriage to Rossellini created a scandal in the United States that forced her to remain in Europe for several years, during which she starred in Rossellini's Journey to Italy (1954), now critically acclaimed. She made a successful return to working for a Hollywood studio in Anastasia (1956), winning her second Academy Award for Best Actress. In her later years, Bergman won her third Academy Award, this one for Best Supporting Actress, for her small role in Murder on the Orient Express (1974). In 1978, she worked with director Ingmar Bergman in Autumn Sonata, for which she received her sixth Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In her final acting role, she portrayed the late Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir in the television mini- series A Woman Called Golda (1982) for which she posthumously won her second Emmy Award for Best Actress. Bergman died on her sixty-seventh birthday (29 August 1982) from breast cancer. According to the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, Bergman quickly became \"the ideal of American womanhood\" and a contender for Hollywood's greatest leading actress. In the United States, she is considered to have brought a \"Nordic freshness and vitality\" to the screen, along with exceptional beauty and intelligence; David O. Selznick once called her \"the most completely conscientious actress\" he had ever worked with. In 1999, the American Film Institute recognized Bergman as one of the greatest actresses of Classic Hollywood Cinema. ==Early life== Bergman at around the age of 16. The self-portrait was taken with camera equipment inherited from her father. Ingrid Bergman was born on 29 August 1915 in Stockholm, to a Swedish father, Justus Samuel Bergman (2 May 1871 \u2013 29 July 1929), and his German wife, Frieda Henriette Auguste Louise (n\u00e9e Adler) Bergman (12 September 1884 \u2013 19 January 1918), who was born in Kiel. Her parents married in Hamburg on 13 June 1907.Standesamt Hamburg 3, 1907 No. 173 She was named after Princess Ingrid of Sweden. Although she was raised in Sweden, she spent her summers in Germany and spoke fluent German. Bergman suffered a succession of crucial losses in her infancy and childhood, which may have been experienced as abandonment. When she was two or three years old, her mother died. At 13, she lost her father, who had been an artist and photographer. He had wanted her to become an opera star and had her take voice lessons for three years. Her father documented all her birthdays with a borrowed camera. After his death, she was sent to live with his sister, Ellen Bergman, who also died of heart disease only six months later. Bergman then lived with her maternal aunt Hulda and her husband Otto, who had five children of their own. She also visited her other maternal aunt, Elsa Adler, whom the young girl called Mutti (Mom) according to family lore. She later said she \"knew from the beginning that [she] wanted to be an actress,\" sometimes wearing her deceased mother's clothing, and staging plays in her father's empty studio. Bergman could speak Swedish and German as first languages, English and Italian (acquired later, while living in the US and Italy respectively), and French (learned in school). She acted in each of these languages at various times. Bergman received a scholarship to the state- sponsored Royal Dramatic Theatre School, where Greta Garbo had some years earlier earned a similar scholarship. After several months, she was given a part in a new play, Ett Brott (A Crime), written by Sigfrid Siwertz. This was \"totally against procedure\" at the school, where girls were expected to complete three years of study before getting such acting roles. During her first summer break, Bergman was hired by a Swedish film studio, which led to her leaving the Royal Dramatic Theatre after just one year to work in films full time. == Career == === 1935\u22121938: Swedish years === 212x212px Bergman's first film experience was as an extra in the 1932 film Landskamp. Her first speaking role was a small part in Munkbrogreven (1934) . Bergman played Elsa, a maid in a seedy hotel, being pursued by the leading man, Edvin Adolphson. Critics called her \"hefty and sure of herself\u201d and \u201csomewhat overweight . . . with an unusual way of speaking her lines.\u201d The unflatteringly striped costume that she wore, may have contributed to the unfavorable comments, regarding her appearance. Soon after Munkbrogreven, Bergman was offered a studio contract and placed under director Gustaf Molander. She left the Royal Dramatic Theater to pursue acting full time. Bergman starred in Ocean Breakers in which she played a fisherman's daughter, and then in Swedenhielms, where she had the opportunity to work alongside her idol Gosta Ekman. Next, she starred in Walpurgis Night (1935). She plays Lena, a secretary in love with her boss, Johan who is unhappily married. Throughout, Lena and the wife vye for Johan's affection with the wife losing her husband to Lena at the end. In 1936, in On the Sunny Side she was cast as an orphan from a good family who marries a rich older gentleman. Also in 1936, she appeared in Intermezzo, her first lead performance, where she was reunited with Gosta Ekman. This was a pivotal film for the young actress, and allowed her to demonstrate her talent. Director Molander later said \"I created Intermezzo for her, but I was not responsible for its success. Ingrid herself made it successful.\u201d In 1938, she starred in Only One Night and played a manor house girl, an upper-class woman living on a country estate. She didn't like the part, calling it 'a piece of rubbish'. She only agreed to appear if only she could star in the studio's next film project En kvinnas ansikte. She later acted in Dollar (1938), a Scandinivian screwball comedy. Bergman had just been voted Sweden's most admired movie star in the previous year, and received top-billing. Svenska Dagbladet wrote in its review; \"Ingrid Bergman\u2019s feline appearance as an industrial tycoon\u2019s wife overshadows them all.\" In her next film, a role created especially for her, En kvinnas ansikte (A Woman's Face), she played against her usual casting, as a bitter, unsympathetic character, whose face had been hideously burned. Anna Holm is the leader of a blackmail gang that targets the wealthy folk of Stockholm for their money and jewellery. The film required Bergman to wear heavy makeup, as well as glue, to simulate a burned face. A brace was put in place to distort the shape of one cheek. In her diary, she called the film \u201cmy own picture, my very own. I have fought for it.\u201d The critics loved her performance, welcoming her as an actor of great talent and con\ufb01dence. The film was awarded a Special Recommendation at the 1938 Venice Film Festival for its \"overall artistic contribution.\"En kvinnas ansikte - Utm\u00e4rkelser (in Swedish). Swedish Film Institute. Retrieved on 2009-04-29. It was remade in 1941 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer with the same title, starring Joan Crawford. Bergman signed a three-picture contract with UFA, the German major film company, although she only made one picture. At the time, she was pregnant but nonetheless, she arrived in Berlin to begin filming The Four Companions. (Die vier Gesellen, 1938) directed by Carl Froelich. The film was intended as a star vehicle to launch Bergman's career in Germany. In the film she played one of the four ambitious young women, attempting to set up a graphic design agency. The film was a lighthearted combination of comedy and romance. At first, she did not comprehend the political and social situation in Germany. Later she said \"I saw very quickly that if you were anybody at all in \ufb01lms, you had to be a member of the Nazi party.\u201d. For the filming, Bergman's stomach was bound to reduce its size. By September, she was back in Sweden, and gave birth to her daughter, Pia. She was never to work in Germany again. Bergman appeared in eleven films in her native Sweden before the age of twenty-five. Her characters were always plagued with uncertainty, fear and anxiety. Her early Swedish films were not exactly masterpieces, but she worked with some of the biggest talents in the Swedish film industry such as G\u00f6sta Ekman, Karin Swanstr\u00f6m, Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m, and Lars Hanson. It showcased her immense acting talent, as a young woman with a bright future ahead of her. ===1939\u22121949: Hollywood and stage work breakthrough=== Intermezzo: A Love Story by Gregory Ratoff premiered on 22 September 1939. This was Bergman's first acting role in the United States. She accepted the invitation of Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, who wished her to star in the English- language remake of her earlier Swedish film Intermezzo (1936). Unable to speak English, and uncertain about her acceptance by the American audience, she expected to complete this one film and return home to Sweden. Her husband, Dr. Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m, remained in Sweden with their daughter Pia (born 1938). In Intermezzo, she played the role of a young piano accompanist, opposite Leslie Howard, who played a famous violin virtuoso. Bergman arrived in Los Angeles on 6 May 1939, and stayed at the Selznick home until she could find another residence. left According to Selznick's son Danny, who was a child at the time, his father had concerns about Bergman: \"She didn't speak English, she was too tall, her name sounded too German, and her eyebrows were too thick\". Bergman was soon accepted without having to modify her looks or name, despite some early suggestions by Selznick. \"He let her have her way\", notes a story in Life magazine. Selznick understood her fear of Hollywood make-up artists, who might turn her into someone she wouldn't recognize, and \"instructed them to lay off\". He was also aware that her natural good looks would compete successfully with Hollywood's \"synthetic razzle-dazzle\". During the following weeks, while Intermezzo was being filmed, Selznick was also filming Gone with the Wind. In a letter to William Hebert, his publicity director, Selznick described a few of his early impressions of Bergman: Intermezzo became an enormous success and as a result Bergman became a star. Ratoff, said, \"She is sensational.\" This was the \"sentiment of the entire set\", wrote a retrospective, adding that workmen went out of their way to do things for her and that the cast and crew \"admired the quick, alert concentration she gave to direction and to her lines\". Film historian David Thomson notes that this became \"the start of an astonishing impact on Hollywood and America\", where her lack of make-up contributed to an \"air of nobility\". According to Life, the impression that she left on Hollywood, after she returned to Sweden, was of a tall girl \"with light brown hair and blue eyes who was painfully shy, but friendly, with a warm, straight, quick smile\". Selznick appreciated her uniqueness. Bergman was hailed as a fine new talent, and received many positive reviews. The New York Times noted her \"freshness and simplicity and natural dignity\" and the maturity of her acting which was nonetheless, free of \"stylistic traits - the mannerisms, postures, precise inflections - that become the stock in trade of the matured actress.\" Variety noted that she was warm and convincing, and provided an \"arresting performance\" and that her \"charm, sincerity\" ...and \"infectious vivaciousness\" would \"serve her well in both comedy and drama.\" There was also recognition of her natural appearance, as opposed to other film actresses. The New York Tribune said: \"Using scarcely any makeup, but playing with mobile intensity, she creates the character so vividly and credibility that it becomes the core of [the] narrative\".190x190px Bergman made her stage debut in 1940 with Lilliom opposite Burgess Meredith. She was still learning English. Selznick was worried that his new starlet's value would diminish if she received bad reviews. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times reviewed that Bergman seemed at ease on the stage, that she commanded the stage that evening. That same year she starred in June Night, (Juninatten) a Swedish language drama film directed by Per Lindberg.Charlotte Chandler Ingrid: Ingrid Bergman, A Personal Biography 71 141653914X - 2007 -\"... more films in Germany ended, Ingrid started the last Swedish film she had agreed to do, June Night.

Selznick's company. On the 18th of February, Robert Sherwood Productions' released her second collaboration with Gregory Ratoff, Adam Had Four Sons. On the 7th of March, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released W. S. Van Dyke's Rage in Heaven. On the 12th of August, Victor Fleming's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, another Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production, had it's New York opening. Bergman was supposed to play Dr Jekyll's fianc\u00e9e but pleaded with the studio that she should play the \"bad girl\" Ivy, the saucy barmaid. Reviews noted that \"she gave a finely-shaded performance\". A New York Times review stated that \"...the young Swedish actress proves again, that a shining talent can sometimes lift itself above an impossibly written role...\". Another review said: \"...she displays a canny combination of charm, understanding, restraint and sheer acting ability.\" On 30 July 1941 at the Lobero Theatre in Santa Barbara, Bergman made her second stage appearance in Anna Christie. She was praised for her performance as a whore in the play based on Eugene O'Neill's work. San Francisco paper said she was as unspoiled as a fresh Swedish snowball. Selznick called her 'The Palmolive Garbo'. Thornton Delaharty said, \"Lunching with Ingrid is like sitting down an hour or so of conversation with an intelligent orchid.\" With left Casablanca, by Michael Curtiz opened on 26 November 1942. In it Bergman co-starred with Humphrey Bogart in the film ; this remains her best-known role. In this film, she played the role of Ilsa, the former love of Rick Blaine and wife of Victor Laszlo, fleeing with Laszlo to the United States. The film premiered on 26 November 1942 at New York's Hollywood Theater. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"The events are shot with sharp humor and delightful touches of political satire.\" It went into more general release, in January 1943.Casablanca was not one of Bergman's favorite performances. \"I made so many films which were more important, but the only one people ever want to talk about is that one with Bogart.\" In later years, she stated, \"I feel about Casablanca that it has a life of its own. There is something mystical about it. It seems to have filled a need, a need that was there before the film, a need that the film filled\". Despite her personal views regarding her performance, Bodley Crowther of The New York Times said that \"...Bergman was surprisingly lovely, crisp and natural...and lights the romantic passages with a warm and genuine glow\". Other reviewers said that she \"[plays] the heroine with...appealing authority and beauty\" and \"illuminates every scene in which she appears\" and compared her to \"a youthful Garbo.\" The Bells of St. Mary's (1945)|upright For Whom the Bell Tolls had its New York premiere on 14 July 1943. With \"Selznick's steady boosting\", she played the part of Maria, it was also her first color film. For the role, she received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. The film was adapted from Ernest Hemingway's novel of the same title and co-starred Gary Cooper. When the book was sold to Paramount Pictures, Hemingway stated that \"Miss Bergman, and no one else, should play the part\". His opinion came from seeing her in her first American role, Intermezzo. They met a few weeks later, and after studying her, he declared, \"You are Maria!\".Carlile, Thomas, and Speiser, Jean. Life, 26 July 1943, pp. 98\u2013104 James Agee, writing in The Nation, said Bergman...\"bears a startling resemblance to an imaginable human being; she really knows how to act, in a blend of poetic grace with quiet realism, which almost never appears in American pictures.\" He speaks movingly of her character's confession of her rape, and her scene of farewell, \"which is shattering to watch.\". Agee believed that Bergman has truly studied what Maria might feel and look like in real life, and not in a Hollywood film. Her performance is both \"devastating and wonderful to see...\" Gaslight opened on 4 May 1944. Bergman won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance. Under the direction of George Cukor, she portrayed a \"wife driven close to madness\" by her husband, played by Charles Boyer. The film, according to Thomson, \"was the peak of her Hollywood glory.\" Reviewers noted her sympathetic and emotional performance, and that she exercised restraint, by not allowing emotion to \"slip off into hysteria\". The New York Journal- American called her \"one of the finest actresses in filmdom\" and said that \"she flames in passion and flickers in depression until the audience - becomes rigid in its seats.\" Gregory Peck and Bergman in Spellbound (1945) poster The Bells of St. Mary's premiered on 6 December 1945. Bergman played a nun opposite Bing Crosby, for which she received her third consecutive nomination for Best Actress. Crosby plays a priest who is assigned to a Roman Catholic school where he conflicts with its headmistress, played by Bergman. Reviewer Nathan Robin said: 'Crosby's laconic ease brings out the impishness behind Bergman's fine-china delicacy, and Bergman proves a surprisingly spunky and spirited comic foil for Crosby'. The film was the biggest box office hit of 1945. Spellbound by famed director Alfred Hitchcock, premiered on 28 December 1945. In Spellbound, Bergman played Dr. Constance Petersen, a psychiatrist whose analysis could determine whether or not Dr. Anthony Edwardes, played by Gregory Peck, is guilty of murder. Artist Salvador Dal\u00ed was hired to create a dream sequences but much of what had been shot was cut by Selznick. During the film, she had the opportunity to appear with Michael Chekhov, who was her acting coach during the 1940s. This would be the first of three collaborations she had with Hitchcock. Next, Bergman starred in Saratoga Trunk, with Gary Cooper, a film originally shot in 1943, but released on 30 March 1946. It was first released to the armed forces overseas. In deference to more timely war- themed and patriotic films, Warner Bros held back the theatrical opening in the United States. On the 6th of September premiered Hitchcock's Notorious. In it, Bergman played a US spy, Alicia Huberman, who had been given an assignment to infiltrate the Nazi sympathizers in South America. Along the way, she fell in love with her fellow spy, played by Cary Grant. The film also starred Claude Rains in an Oscar-nominated performance by a supporting actor. According to Roger Ebert, Notorious is the most elegant expression of Hitchcock's visual style. Writing for the BFI, Samuel Wigley called it a \"perfect\" film. Notorious was selected by the National Film Registry in 2006 as culturally and significantly important. On 5 October 1946, Bergman appeared in Joan of Lorraine at the Alvin Theatre in New York. Tickets were fully booked for a twelve-week run. It was the greatest hit in New York. After each performance, crowds were in line to see Bergman in person. Newsweek called her 'Queen of the Broadway Season.' She reportedly received roughly $129,000 plus 15 percent of the grosses. The Associated Press named her 'Woman of the Year'. Gallup certified her as the most popular actress in America. Cary Grant and Bergman in Notorious (1946) Arch of Triumph, by Lewis Milestone premiered on 17 February 1948 with Bergman, Charles Boyer and Charles Laughton. The film was listed as the 74th highest grossing film that year. On the 11th of November, Joan of Arc had its world premiere. For her role, Bergman received another Best Actress nomination, an independent film based on the Maxwell Anderson play Joan of Lorraine, which earned her a Tony Award earlier that year. Produced by Walter Wanger and initially released through RKO. Bergman had championed the role since her arrival in Hollywood, which was one of the reasons she had played it on the Broadway stage in Anderson's play. The film was not a big hit with the public, partly because of the Rossellini scandal, which broke while the film was still in theatres. Even worse, it received disastrous reviews, and, although nominated for several Academy Awards, did not receive a Best Picture nomination. It was subsequently cut by 45 minutes, but restored to full length in 1998, and released in 2004 on DVD. Under Capricorn premiered on 9 September 1949, as another Bergman and Hitchcock collaboration. The film is set in the Australia of 1770. The story opens as Charles Adare, played by Michael Wilding, arrives in New South Wales with his uncle. Desperate to find his fortune, Adare meets Sam Flusky (Joseph Cotten), who is married to Charles's childhood friend Lady Henrietta (Bergman), an alcoholic kept locked in their mansion. Soon, Flusky becomes jealous of Adare's affections for his wife. The film met with negative reactions from critics. Some of the negativity may have based on disapproval of Bergman's affair with the Italian director Roberto Rossellini. Their scandalous relationship became apparent, shortly after the film's release. === 1950\u22121955: Italian films with Rossellini === Stromboli (1949)|220x220px|left Stromboli was released by Italian director Roberto Rossellini on 18 February 1950. Bergman had greatly admired two films by Rossellini. She wrote to him in 1949, expressing her admiration and suggesting that she make a film with him. As a consequence, she was cast in Stromboli. During the production, they began an affair, and Bergman became pregnant with their first child.Bondanella, Peter E. The Films of Robert Rossellini, Cambridge University Press (1993). This affair caused a huge scandal in the United States, where it led to Bergman being denounced on the floor of the United States Senate. On March 14, 1950, Senator Edwin C. Johnson insisted that his once-favorite actress \"had perpetrated an assault upon the institution of marriage,\" and went so far as to call her \"a powerful influence for evil.\" \"The purity that made people joke about Saint Bergman when she played Joan of Arc,\" one writer commented, \"made both audiences and United States senators feel betrayed when they learned of her affair with Roberto Rossellini.\" Art Buchwald, permitted to read her mail during the scandal, reflected in an interview, \"Oh, that mail was bad, ten, twelve, fourteen huge mail bags. 'Dirty whore.' 'Bitch.' 'Son of a bitch.' And they were all Christians who wrote it.\" Ed Sullivan chose not to have her on his show, despite a poll indicating that the public wanted her to appear. However, Steve Allen, whose show was equally popular, did have her as a guest, later explaining \"the danger of trying to judge artistic activity through the prism of one's personal life\". Spoto notes that Bergman had, by virtue of her roles and screen persona, placed herself \"above all that\". She had played a nun in The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), and a virgin saint in Joan of Arc (1948). Bergman later said, \"People saw me in Joan of Arc, and declared me a saint. I'm not. I'm just a woman, another human being.\"Spoto, Donald. Notorious: The Life of Ingrid Bergman, HarperCollins (1997), p. 300 As a result of the scandal, Bergman returned to Italy, leaving her first husband and went through a publicized divorce and custody battle for their daughter. Bergman and Rossellini were married on 24 May 1950. In the United States the film was a box office bomb but did better overseas, where Bergman and Rossellini's affair was considered less scandalous. In all, RKO lost $200,000 on the picture. In Italy, it was awarded the Rome Prize for Cinema as the best film of the year.Dagrada, Elena. \"A Triple Alliance for a Catholic Neorealism: Roberto Rossellini According to Felix Norton, Giulio Andreotti and Gian Luigi Rondi.\" Moralizing Cinema: Film, Catholicism, and Power. Eds. Daniel Biltereyst and Daniela Treveri Gennari. Routledge, 2014. The initial reception in America, however, was very negative. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times opened his review by writing: \"After all the unprecedented interest that the picture 'Stromboli' has aroused \u2014 it being, of course, the fateful drama which Ingrid Bergman and Roberto Rossellini have made \u2014 it comes as a startling anticlimax to discover that this widely heralded film is incredibly feeble, inarticulate, uninspiring and painfully banal.\" Crowther added that Bergman's character \"is never drawn with clear and revealing definition, due partly to the vagueness of the script and partly to the dullness and monotony with which Rossellini has directed her.\" The staff at Variety agreed, writing, \"Director Roberto Rossellini purportedly denied responsibility for the film, claiming the American version was cut by RKO beyond recognition. Cut or not cut, the film reflects no credit on him. Given elementary-school dialog to recite and impossible scenes to act, Ingrid Bergman's never able to make the lines real nor the emotion sufficiently motivated to seem more than an exercise ... The only visible touch of the famed Italian director is in the hard photography, which adds to the realistic, documentary effect of life on the rocky, lava- blanketed island. Rossellini's penchant for realism, however, does not extend to Bergman. She's always fresh, clean and well-groomed.\" Harrison's Reports wrote: \"As entertainment, it does have a few moments of distinction, but on the whole it is a dull slow-paced piece, badly edited and mediocre in writing, direction and acting.\" John McCarten of The New Yorker found that there was \"nothing whatsoever in the footage that rises above the humdrum\", and felt that Bergman \"doesn't really seem to have her heart in any of the scenes.\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post lamented, \"It's a pity that many people who never go to foreign-made pictures will be drawn into this by the Rossellini-Bergman names and will think that this flat, drab, inept picture is what they've been missing.\" Bergman as Irene Girard in Europa '51 Recent assessments have been more positive. Reviewing the film in 2013 in conjunction with its DVD release as part of The Criterion Collection, Dave Kehr called the film \"one of the pioneering works of modern European filmmaking.\" In an expansive analysis of the film, critic Fred Camper wrote of the drama, \"Like many of cinema's masterpieces, Stromboli is fully explained only in a final scene that brings into harmony the protagonist's state of mind and the imagery. This structure...suggests a belief in the transformative power of revelation. Forced to drop her suitcase (itself far more modest than the trunks she arrived with) as she ascends the volcano, Karin is stripped of her pride and reduced \u2014 or elevated \u2014 to the condition of a crying child, a kind of first human being who, divested of the trappings of self, must learn to see and speak again from a personal \"year zero\" (to borrow from another Rossellini film title).\"Camper, Fred. Volcano Girl, film analysis and review. Chicago Reader, 2000. Last accessed: December 31, 2007. The Venice Film Festival ranked Stromboli among the 100 most important Italian films (\"100 film italiani da salvare\") from 1942\u20131978. In 2012, the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound critics' poll also listed it as one of the 250 greatest films of all time. In 1952, Rossellini directed Bergman in Europa '51, where she plays Irene Girard who is distraught by the sudden death of his son. Her husband played by Alexander Knox soon cope, but Irene seems to need a purpose in life to assuage her guilt of neglecting her son. Rossellini directed her in a brief segment of his 1953 documentary film, Siamo donne (We, the Women), which was devoted to film actresses. His biographer, Peter Bondanella, notes that problems with communication during their marriage may have inspired his films' central themes of \"solitude, grace, and spirituality in a world without moral values\". On December 1953, Rossellini directed her in the play Joan of Arc at the Stake in Naples, Italy. They took the play to Barcelona, London, Paris and Stockholm. Her performance received generally good reviews. Their following effort was Viaggio in Italia in 1954. It follows a couple's journey to Naples, Italy to sell off an inherited house. Trapped in a lifeless marriage, they are further unnerved by the locals' way of living. According to John Patterson of The Guardian, the film started The French New Wave. Martin Scorsese picked this film to be among his favorites in his documentary short titled 'My Voyage to Italy' (2001). On 17 February 1955, Joan at the Stake opened at the Stockholm Opera House. The play was attended by the prime minister and other theatrical figures in Sweden. Swedish Daily reported that Bergman seems vague, cool and lacked of charisma. Bergman was hurt by mostly negative reviews from the media of her homeland. Stig Ahlgren was the most harsh. He called her a clever businesswoman, not an actress. \"Ingrid is a commodity, a desirable commodity which is offered in the free market.\" Another effort they released that year was Giovanna d'Arco al rogo. 225x225px Their final effort in 1955 was La Paura (Fear), based on a play by Austro-Jewish writer Stefan Zweig\u2019s 1920 novella Angst about adultery and blackmail. In Fear, Bergman plays a businesswoman, who runs a pharmaceutical company founded by her husband (Mathias Wieman). She is having an affair with a man whose ex-lover, turns up and blackmails her. The woman demands money, threatening to tell her husband about the affair if Bergman doesn't pay her off. Under constant threats, Bergman is pressed to the point of committing suicide. Rossellini's use of a Hollywood star in his typically \"neorealist\" films, in which he normally used non-professional actors, provoked some negative reactions in certain circles. Rossellini, \"defying audience expectations[,]...employed Bergman as if she were a nonprofessional,\" depriving her of a script and the typical luxuries accorded to a star (indoor plumbing, for instance, or hairdressers) and forcing Bergman to act \"inspired by reality while she worked\", creating what one critic calls \"a new cinema of psychological introspection.\" Bergman was aware of Rossellini's directing style before filming, as the director had earlier written to her explaining that he worked from \"a few basic ideas, developing them little by little\" as a film progressed. Rossellini then was accused of ruining her successful career by taking her away from Hollywood, while Bergman was seen as the impetus for Rossellini abandoning the aesthetic style and socio-political concerns of Neo-Realism. While the movies Bergman made with Rossellini were commercial failures, somehow the films have garnered a great appreciation and attention in the recent times. According to Jordan Cronk in his article reviewing the movies, their work has inspired a beginning of a modern cinematic era. Rossellini's films during the Bergman era ponder issues of complex psychology as depicted by Bergman in films like Stromboli, Europa '51 and Journey to Italy. The influence of Bergman and Rossellini's partnership can be felt in the movies by Godard, Fellini and Antonioni to more recently, Abbas Kiarostami and Nuri Bilge Ceylan. David Kehr from The New York Times commented that their works now stand as one of the pioneering works whose influence can be felt in European modern filmmaking. ===1956\u22121972: Hollywood return and recognition=== With 252x252px After separating from Rossellini, Bergman starred in Jean Renoir's Elena and Her Men (Elena et les Hommes, 1956), a romantic comedy in which she played a Polish princess caught up in political intrigue. Bergman and Renoir had been wanting to work together. In Elena and Her Men, in which Renoir written for her, she plays a down-on-a-luck Polish princess, Elena Sorokowska. The film was a hit in Paris when it premiered on September 1956. Candice Russell, commented that Bergman is the best thing in the film. Roger Ebert wrote, \"The movie is about something else - about Bergman's rare eroticism, and the way her face seems to have an inner light on film. Was there ever a more sensuous actress in the movies?\" In 1956, Bergman also starred in a French adaptation of stage production of Tea and Sympathy. It was presented at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Paris, Paris.\"Miss Bergman On Stage; Bows in French Adaptation of 'Tea and Sympathy' in Paris\" The New York Times, December 4, 1956 It tells a story of a boarding school boy who is thought to be homosexual. Bergman played the wife of the headmaster, who grows closer to him and later enticed him into sex. It was a smash hit. Twentieth Century Fox had bought the rights to Anastasia with Anatole Litvak slated to direct. Buddy Adler, the executive producer wanted Bergman, then a still controversial figure in the States, to return to the American screen after a seven-year absence. Fox agreed to take a chance, making her a box-office risk to play the leading role. Filming was going to be made in England, Paris, and Copenhagen. Anastasia tells a story of a woman who just maybe the only surviving member of the Romanov family. Yul Brynner is the scheming general, who tries to pass her off as the single surviving daughter of the late Tsar Nicholas, His hope is to use her to collect a hefty inheritance. Anastasia was an immediate success when it was released. Bosley Crowther wrote in the New York Times upon the film's release, \"It is a beautifully molded performance, worthy of an Academy Award and particularly gratifying in the light of Miss Bergman's long absence from commendable films.\" In Anastasia (1956) which won her second Oscar With her starring role in 1956's Anastasia (1956), Bergman made a triumphant return to working for a Hollywood studio (albeit in a film produced in Europe) and won the Academy Award for Best Actress for a second time. Its director, Anatole Litvak, described her as \"one of the greatest actresses in the world\". He described her at the time:After Anastasia, Bergman starred in Indiscreet (1958), a romantic comedy directed by Stanley Donen. She plays a successful London stage actress, Anna Kalman, who falls in love with Philip Adams, a diplomat played by Cary Grant. The film is based on the play 'Kind Sir' written by Norman Krasna. He tells her that he is married but couldn't possibly get a divorce in order to stay single. Cecil Parker and Phyllis Calvert also co-starred. Bergman later starred in the 1958 picture The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, based on a true story about a woman, Gladys Aylward, who was a Christian missionary in China. She endures many obstacles in her way, but through patience and sincerity, is able to win the hearts of the natives. In the film's climatic scene, to escape from the Japanese invasion, she leads a group of orphaned children to safety. New York Times wrote, \"the justification of her achievements is revealed by no other displays than those of Miss Bergman's mellow beauty, friendly manner and melting charm.\" The film also co-starring Robert Donat and Curd Jurgens. Grant and Bergman in Indiscreet (1958) Bergman made her first post-scandal public appearance in Hollywood at the 30th Academy Awards in 1959, as presenter of the award for Best Picture, and received a standing ovation when introduced.

She was awarded the 1960 Emmy for best dramatic performance by an actress. In 1961, Bergman's second American television production, Twenty-four Hours in a Woman's Life, was produced by her third husband, Lars Schmidt. She later starred in Goodbye Again as Paula Tessier, a middle-aged interior decorator who falls in love with Anthony Perkin's character, who is fifteen years her junior. Paula is in relationship with Roger Demarest, a womanizer, played by Yves Montand. Roger loves Paula but reluctant to give up his womanizing way. When Perkins starts pursuing her, the lonely Paula is suddenly forced to choose between the two men. In his review of the film, Bosley Crowther wrote that Bergman was neither convincing nor interesting in her part as Perkins's lover. In 1962, Schmidt also co- produced his wife's third venture into American television, Hedda Gabler, made for BBC and CBS. She played the titular character opposite Michael Redgrave and Ralph Richardson. That year, she took the titular role of Hedda Gabler in Paris's Theatre Montparnasse.

Here, she played a prim spinster, a dental nurse-receptionist who is secretly in love with her boss, the dentist, played by Matthau. Howard Thompson wrote in the New York Times: > The teaming of Matthau, whose dour, craggy virility now supplants the easy > charm of Barry Nelson, and the ultra-feminine Miss Bergman, in a rare comedy > venture, was inspirational on somebody's part. The lady is delightful as a > (now) 'Swedish iceberg', no longer young, who flowers radiantly while > running interference for the boss's romantic bumbling. The two stars mesh > perfectly. On the 9th of April 1970, Guy Green's A Walk in the Spring Rain had its world premiere. Bergman played Libby, the middle-aged wife of a New York professor (Fritz Weaver). She accompanies him on his sabbatical in the Tennessee mountains, where he intends to write a book. She meets a local handyman, Will Cade (Anthony Quinn), and they form a mutual attraction. The screenplay was based on the romantic novel written by Rachel Maddux. The New York Times in its review wrote, \"Striving mightily and looking lovely, Miss Bergman seems merely a petulant woman who falls into the arms of Quinn for novelty, from boredom with her equally bored husband, [Weaver], pecking away on a book in their temporary mountain retreat.\" She made an appearance in one episode of The Bob Hope Show in 1972. Also that year, U.S. Senator Charles H. Percy entered an apology into the Congressional Record for the verbal attack made on Bergman on March 14, 1950 by Edwin C. Johnson. Percy noted that she had been \"the victim of bitter attack in this chamber 22 years ago.\" He expressed regret that the persecution caused Bergman to \"leave this country at the height of her career.\" Bergman said that the remarks had been difficult to forget, and had caused her to avoid the country for nine years. Although she had paid a high price for it, Bergman, however had made peace with America, according to her daughter, Isabella Rossellini. === 1973\u22121982: Later years and continued success === On September 27 1972, Fielder Cook's From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler premiered where she acted. Also that year, Bergman was the president of the jury at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival. In an interview with The Daytona Beach Sunday News in 1978, she recalled the event as she met with Ingmar Bergman and reminded him about the letter she wrote, asking him to cast her in one of her pictures. Knowing that Ingmar would be attending, she made a copy of his reply and put it in his pocket. He didn't reply for two years. Finally, Bergman returned to the London's West End and played with John Gielgud in The Constant Wife. Bergman became one of the few actresses ever to receive three Oscars when she won her third (and first in the category of Best Supporting Actress) for her performance in Murder on the Orient Express (1974). Director Sidney Lumet offered Bergman the important part of Princess Dragomiroff, with which he felt she could win an Oscar. She insisted on playing the much smaller role of Greta Ohlsson, the old Swedish missionary. Lumet discussed Bergman's role: Bergman in The Constant Wife At the 1975 Academy Awards, film director Jean Renoir was to receive a Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to the motion picture industry. As he was ill at the time, he asked that Ingrid Bergman accept this award on his behalf. Bergman made a speech of acceptance that praised his films and the \"compassion that marked all his works\" as well as his teaching of both young filmmakers and audiences. Although she had been nominated for Best Supporting Actress, she considered her role in Murder on the Orient Express to be quite minor and did not expect to win. When her award was announced, in her surprised and unrehearsed remarks, she remarked to the audience that Valentina Cortese should have won the award for her role in Day for Night, by Truffaut. Bergman and Cortese spent the rest of the evening in each other's company, and were the subject of many photographs. Also in 1975, Bergman attended the AFI tribute to Orson Welles. The audience gave her a standing ovation when she appeared on stage. She joked that she hardly knew Welles and they only invited her because she was working across the street. In 1976, Bergman was the first person to receive France's newly-created Honorary C\u00e9sar, a national film award. She also appeared in A Matter of Time, by Vincente Minnelli, which premiered on 7 October 1976. From 1977 to 1978, Bergman returned to the London's West with Wendy Hiller in Waters of the Moon. In 1978, Bergman appeared in Autumn Sonata (H\u00f6stsonaten), by Ingmar Bergman (no relation), for which she received her seventh\u2014and final\u2014Academy Award nomination. She did not attend the awards, due to her illness. This was her final cinema performance. The film gave her the opportunity to work with Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, who were also well-known Swedish artists. In the film, Bergman plays a celebrity pianist, Charlotte, who travels to Norway to visit her neglected daughter, played by Liv Ullmann. Ullmann's character is married to a clergyman and they care for her sister, who is severely disabled, paralyzed, and unable to speak. Charlotte has not visited her two daughters for five years. The film was shot in Norway. Bergman was battling cancer at the time of the filming. The final two weeks of the shooting schedule required adjustment, because she required additional surgery. Believing that her career was nearing its end, Bergman wanted her swan song to be honourable. She was pleased with the overwhelming critical acclaim for Autumn Sonata. Stanley Kaufmann wrote, \"The astonishment is Bergman's performance. We've all adored her for decades but not many of us have thought her a superb actress. Here, she exalted in the hands of a master.\" Newsweek wrote, \"An expressive force we can't even remember seeing since Hollywood grabbed her.\" The Times (London) concurred that it was \"a tour-de-force, such as the cinema rarely sees.\" Both Bergman and Ullman won the New York Film Critic's Award and Italy's Donatello award, for their roles. Bergman later recalled that Ingmar had possibly given her the best role of her career, that she would never make another movie again. \"I don't want to go down and play little parts. This should be the end.\" In 1979, Bergman hosted the AFI's Life Achievement Award Ceremony for Alfred Hitchcock. At the program's finale, she presented him with the wine cellar key that was crucial to the plot of Notorious. \"Cary Grant kept this for 10 years, then he gave it to me, and I kept it for 20 years for good luck and now I give it to you with my prayers,\" before adding \"God bless you, Hitch.\" Bergman was the guest of honour in the Variety's Club All Star Salute program on December, 1979. The show was hosted by Jimmy Stewart and was attended by Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, Goldie Hawn, Helen Heyes, Paul Henreid and many of her former co-stars. She was honored with the Illis Quorum, the medal given to artists of significance by the King of Sweden. In the late 70s, Bergman appeared on several talk shows, and was interviewed by Merv Griffin, David Frost, Michael Parkinson, Mike Douglas, John Russell and Dick Cavett, discussing her life and career. Bergman's autobiography, My Story In 1980, Bergman's autobiography, Ingrid Bergman: My Story, was written with the help of Alan Burgess. In it, she discusses her childhood, her early career, her life during her time in Hollywood, the Rossellini scandal, and subsequent events. The book was written after her children warned her that she would only be known through rumors and interviews if she did not tell her own story.Bergman in A Woman Called GoldaOn 21th of May 1982, Carl Reiner's Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid premiered, where Bergman acted. Also that year, she was awarded the David di Donatello's Golden Medal of the Minister of Tourism, given by The Academy of Italian Cinema. Finally that year, Bergman played the starring role in a television mini- series, A Woman Called Golda (1982), about the late Israeli prime minister Golda Meir. It was to be her final acting role and she was honored posthumously with a second Emmy Award for Best Actress. Bergman was surprised to be offered the role, but the producer explained, \"People believe you and trust you, and this is what I want, because Golda Meir had the trust of the people.\" Her daughter Isabella added, \"Now, that was interesting to Mother.\" She was also persuaded that Golda was a \"grand-scale person\", one that people would assume was much taller than she actually was. Chandler notes that the role \"also had a special significance for her, as during World War II, Ingrid felt guilty because she had so misjudged the situation in Germany\". According to Chandler, \"Ingrid's rapidly deteriorating health was a more serious problem. Insurance for Bergman was impossible. Not only did she have cancer, but it was spreading, and if anyone had known how bad it was, no one would have gone on with the project.\" After viewing the series on TV, Isabella commented: Bergman was frequently ill during the filming although she rarely complained or showed it. Four months after the filming was completed, she died, on her 67th birthday. After her death, her daughter Pia accepted her Emmy. ==Personal life== === Marriages and children === Rossellini and Bergman in 1953, a scandal that rocked Hollywood On July 10, 1937, at the age of 21, in St\u00f6de, Bergman married a dentist, Petter Aron Lindstr\u00f6m (1 March 1907 \u2013 24 May 2000), who later became a neurosurgeon. The couple had one child, a daughter, Friedel Pia Lindstr\u00f6m (born 20 September 1938). After returning to the United States in 1940, she acted on Broadway before continuing to do films in Hollywood. The following year, her husband arrived from Sweden with Pia. Lindstr\u00f6m stayed in Rochester, New York, where he studied medicine and surgery at the University of Rochester. Bergman traveled to New York and stayed at their small rented stucco house between films, her visits lasting from a few days to four months. According to an article in Life, the \"doctor regards himself as the undisputed head of the family, an idea that Ingrid accepts cheerfully\". He insisted she draw the line between her film and personal life, as he has a \"professional dislike for being associated with the tinseled glamor of Hollywood\". Lindstr\u00f6m later moved to San Francisco, California, where he completed his internship at a private hospital, and they continued to spend time together when she could travel between filming. Petter did not view Bergman as the rest of the world did. He thought she was too absorbed with her popularity and image, and was full of vanity. According to Bergman biographer, Donald Spoto, Petter managed her career and financial matters. He was very frugal with money. Peter had been aware of his wife's affairs all along. When asked by the biographer why he didn't ask for a divorce, he replied, \"I lived with that because of her income\". In 1945, she and Lindstr\u00f6m, became United States citizens. On 27 August, two days before her 30th birthday, as Ingrid Lindstrom, she and her husband both filed \"Declaration of Intention\" forms with the United States District Court, Southern District of California, in order to become US citizens. Bergman returned to Europe after the scandalous publicity surrounding her affair with Italian director Roberto Rossellini during the filming of Stromboli in 1950. She begged Petter for a divorce and contact with Pia. She had asked him before but he refused. Had he agreed for a divorce, some of the unpleasantries could had been avoided. In the same month the film was released, she gave birth to a boy, Renato Roberto Ranaldo Giusto Giuseppe (\"Robin\") Rossellini (born 2 February 1950). A week after her son was born, she divorced Lindstr\u00f6m and married Rossellini by proxy and according to the Mexican law. On 18 June 1952, she gave birth to the twin daughters Isotta Ingrid Rossellini and Isabella Rossellini. Isabella became an actress and model, and Isotta Ingrid became a professor of Italian literature. It was not until 1957 that Bergman was reunited with Pia, in Rome. Petter, however, remained bitter towards Bergman. Bergman with third husband, theatre producer, Lars Schmidt During the scandal, Bergman received letters in support from Cary Grant, Helen Heyes, Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck and other celebrities. Rossellini's cousin, Renzo Avanzo, was worried that Bergman would deflect Rossellini from making pictures he should be making. Rossellini didn't like her friends for fear of trying to lure her back to Hollywood. He was possessive and would not allow Bergman to work for anyone else. In 1957, Rossellini had an affair with Sonali Das Gupta while filming in India. Bergman met with the Prime Minister of India, Pandit Nehru in London into letting Rossellini get out of India. They separated in 1956, and their marriage was annulled the following year. Rossellini then married Sonali Das Gupta in 1957. 0n 21 December 1958, Bergman married Lars Schmidt, a theatrical entrepreneur from a wealthy Swedish shipping family. She met Schmidt through her publicist, Kay Brown. They spent summers together in Danholmen, Lars's private island off the coast of Sweden. The couple and their children stayed at Choisel, not too far from Paris. While Bergman constantly off to filming, Lars was in all over Europe, producing plays and television shows. Their work schedules put a strain on their marriage. While vacationing with Schmidt in Monte Gordo beach (Algarve region, Portugal) in 1963, right after recording the TV movie Hedda Gabler, she got ticketed for wearing a bikini that showed too much according to the modesty standards of conservative Portugal. After almost two decades of marriage, the couple divorced in 1975. Nonetheless, he was by her side when she died in 1982. ===Relationships=== Bergman had had affairs with her directors and co-stars in the 40s. Spencer Tracy and Bergman briefly dated during the filming of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. She later had an affair with Gary Cooper while shooting For Whom The Bell Tolls. Cooper famously said, \"No one loved me more than Ingrid Bergman, but the day after filming concluded, I couldn't even get her on the phone.\" Jeanine Basinger, when reviewing 'Victor Fleming: An American Movie Master' by Michael Sragow writes, \"Fleming fell deeply in love with the irresistible Swede and never really got over it\". While directing his final film Joan of Arc, he was completely in thrall with Bergman. She had a brief affair with musician Larry Adler when she was travelling across Europe entertaining the troops in 1945. In Anthony Quinn\u2019s autobiography, he mentions his sexual relationship with Bergman, among his many other affairs. Howard Hughes was also quite taken by Bergman. They met through Cary Grant and Irene Selznick. He phoned one day to inform her that he had just bought RKO as a present for her. During her marriage to Lindstr\u00f6m, Bergman had affairs with the photographer Robert Capa and the actor Gregory Peck. It was through Bergman's autobiography that her affair with Capa became known.p. 176 In June 1945, Bergman was passing through Paris, on her way to Berlin to entertain American soldiers. In response to a dinner invitation she met Capa and novelist Irwin Shaw. By her account, they had a wonderful evening. The next day, she departed for Berlin. Two months later, Capa was in Berlin, photographing ruins, and they met again. Distressed over her marriage to Lindstr\u00f6m, she fell in love with Capa, and wished to leave her husband. During their months together in Berlin, Capa made enough money to follow Bergman back to Hollywood. Although Life magazine assigned him to cover Bergman, he was unhappy with the \"frivolity\" of Hollywood. Gregory Peck admitted to having an affair with Bergman during the filming of Spellbound Bergman's brief affair with Spellbound co-star Gregory Peck was kept private until Peck confessed it to Brad Darrach of People in an interview five years after Bergman's death. Peck said, \"All I can say is that I had a real love for her (Bergman), and I think that's where I ought to stop ... I was young. She was young. We were involved for weeks in close and intense work.\" Bergman was a Lutheran, once saying of herself, \"I'm tall, Swedish, and Lutheran\". Later, her daughter Isabella Rossellini said: \"She showed that women are independent, that women want to tell their own story, want to take initiative but sometimes they can't because sometimes our social culture doesn't allow women to break away from certain rules\". After the making of Intermezzo: A Love Story (1939), producer David O. Selznick he and his wife Irene remained friends with Bergman throughout her career. Bergman also formed a lifelong friendship with her Notorious co-star, Cary Grant. They met briefly in 1938 at a party thrown by David O. Selznick. Notorious was the start of a frienship between Bergman and Grant. Scot Eyman in his book, 'Cary Grant: A Brilliant Disguise' wrote, \"Grant found that he liked Ingrid Bergman a great deal,\u201d Mr. Eyman notes. \u201cShe was beautiful, but lots of actresses are beautiful. What made Bergman special was her indifference to her looks, her clothes, to everything except her art.\u201d ===Illness and death=== Bergman's grave at 235x235px During the play of The Constant Wife in London, Bergman discovered a small hard lump on the underside of her left breast. On June 15, 1974, she entered a London clinic and had her first operation. While working on Autumn Sonata, Bergman discovered another lump, and flew back to London for another surgery. Afterwards, she entered theatrical rehearsals for Waters of the Moon (1978). Despite her illness, she accepted the part to play Golda Meir in 1981. As soon as the film finished, Bergman retired to her apartment in Cheyne Gardens, London. She suffered greatly from chemotherapy. Photographers had camped outside on the pavement of her London apartment. They had telephoto lenses and she didn't even dare go near the front window. At this point, the cancer had spread to her spine, collapsing her twelfth vertebrae. Her right lung no longer functioned, and only a small part of her left lung had not collapsed. Bergman died on 29 August 1982 at 12:00 am, her 67th birthday, in London, of breast cancer. The memorial service was held in Saint Martin's-in-the-Fields church in October with twelve hundred in attendance. The children were there, the Rossellinis, relatives from Sweden, Liv Ullman, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Birgit Nilsson and Joss Ackland among others. Words of Shakespeare were read. They played 'This Old Man' from The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, a Beethoven song, and a strains of As Time Goes By. Her body was cremated at Kensal Green Cemetery, London, and her ashes taken to Sweden. Most of them were scattered in the sea around the islet of Dannholmen off the fishing village of Fj\u00e4llbacka in Bohusl\u00e4n, on the west coast of Sweden, where she had spent most of the summers from 1958 until her death. The rest were placed next to her parents' ashes in Norra Begravningsplatsen (Northern Cemetery), Stockholm, Sweden. ==Legacy== The news of Bergman's death was widely reported by mainstream media in the US and Europe. The New York Times stated: 'Ingrid Bergman, winner of three Oscars is dead.' The Los Angeles Times printed a front page notice: '3-Time Oscar Winner Ingrid Bergman Dies'. The Washington Post paid its tribute in an article that called her 'an actress whose innocent yet provocative beauty made her one of the great stars of stage and screen.' The New York Post headlined 'Ingrid Bergman Dies' on their front page in bold red color. Bergman in a magazine photo shoot in 1940s Bergman's death was being mourned by many, especially her fellow co-stars. They shared thoughtful words and fond memories, praising her tenacity, spirit, and warmth. Cary Grant, who was troubled by the news, refused to comment. Joseph Cotten considered her as a great friend and a great actress. Paul Henreid commented, \"She was so terribly beautiful in her youth. She was a very strong lady with great desires and emotions and she led a colorful life.\" Liv Ullman said that she will mourn her. \"She made me very proud to be a woman,\" she added. Leonard Nimoy praised her tenacity and courage. \"I developed enormous respect for her as a person and talent. She was a marvelous lady and actress,\" he stated. Bergman continued her acting career, despite suffering from cancer for eight years, and won international honors for her final roles. \"Her spirit triumphed with remarkable grace and courage\", adds Spoto. Director George Cukor once summed up her contributions to the film media when he said to her, \"Do you know what I especially love about you, Ingrid, my dear? I can sum it up as your naturalness. The camera loves your beauty, your acting, and your individuality. A star must have individuality. It makes you a great star.\" Writing about her first years in Hollywood, Life stated that \"All Bergman vehicles are blessed\", and \"they all go speedily and happily, with no temperament from the leading lady\". She was \"completely pleased\" with her early career's management by David O. Selznick, who always found excellent dramatic roles for her to play, and equally satisfied with her salary, once saying, \"I am an actress, and I am interested in acting, not in making money.\" Life adds that \"she has greater versatility than any actress on the American screen ... Her roles have demanded an adaptability and sensitiveness of characterization to which few actresses could rise\". According to biographer Donald Spoto, she was \"arguably the most international star in the history of entertainment\". After her American film debut in the film Intermezzo: A Love Story (1939), co-starring Leslie Howard, Hollywood saw her as a unique actress who was completely natural in style and without need of make-up. Film critic James Agee wrote that she \"not only bears a startling resemblance to an imaginable human being; she really knows how to act, in a blend of poetic grace with quiet realism\". Film historian David Thomson, said she \"always strove to be a 'true' woman\", and many filmgoers identified with her: According to her daughter, Isabella Rossellini, her mother had a deep sense of freedom and independence. She then added, \"She was able to integrate so many cultures... she is not even American but she is totally part of American culture like she is totally part of the Swedish, Italian, French, European film making.\" In 1999, she was ranked by the American Film Institute as the fourth-greatest female screen legend. === Activism === During a press conference in Washington, D.C. for the promotion of the play Joan of Lorraine, she protested to the newspapers, regarding racial segregation after seeing it first hand at Lisner Auditorium, the theater where she was working. This led to significant publicity and some hate mail. A bust of Bergman has been placed outside the Lisner Auditorium, in recognition of her protest, and as a reminder of the venue's segregated past. Bergman went to Alaska during World War II to entertain US Army troops. Soon after the war ended, she also went to Europe for the same purpose, where she was able to see the devastation caused by the war. After the onset of World War II, Bergman felt guilt for her initial dismissal of the German state. According to her biographer Charlotte Chandler, she had at first considered the Nazis only a \"temporary aberration, 'too foolish to be taken seriously'. She believed Germany would not start a war.\" Bergman felt that \"the good people there would not permit it\". Chandler adds that she \"felt guilty all the rest of her life because when she was in Germany at the end of the war, she had been afraid to go with the others to witness the atrocities of the Nazi extermination camps\". ===Documentary film=== Cannes poster of Bergman (2015) A film was made, to celebrate the one hundredth anniversary of her birth. Ingrid Bergman: In Her Own Words, is a 2015 Swedish documentary film about Bergman, directed by Stig Bj\u00f6rkman. It was screened in the Cannes Classics section at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival where it received a special mention for L'\u0152il d'or.copied content from Ingrid Bergman: In Her Own Words; see that article for attribution and history At the 2015 Vancouver International Film Festival, the film won the award for Most Popular International Documentary, based on audience balloting.copied from Ingrid Bergman: In Her Own Words see that article for attribution and history The film \"loses no chance to illuminate the independence and courage she showed in her private life\". Although the viewer may pronounce judgement on \" Bergman's free-wheeling, non-conformist maternal lifestyle, there can be no doubt about her determination and professional commitment.\" Ending with her last screen appearance in Autumn Sonata, in 1978, \"Bjorkman leaves behind the image of a uniquely strong, independent woman whose relaxed modernity was way ahead of its time.\" === Biographical stage plays === Bergman was portrayed by her daughter, Isabella Rossellini in My Dad is 100 years Old (2005). In 2015, 'Notorious', a play based on Hitchcock's Notorious has been staged at The Gothenburg Opera. Bergman's Italian period has been dramatised on stage in the musical play which is titled, Camera; The Musical About Ingrid Bergman. It was written by Jan-Erik S\u00e4\u00e4f and Staffan Aspegren and performed in Stockholm, Sweden. === In popular culture === Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca, a prominent source of parody in popular culture Woody Guthrie composed \"Ingrid Bergman\", a song about Bergman in 1950. The lyrics have been described as \"erotic\" and makes reference to Bergman's relationship with Roberto Rossellini, which began during work on the film Stromboli. This song was never recorded by Guthrie but it was set to music and recorded by Billy Bragg on the album Mermaid Avenue after being discovered in the Woody Guthrie Archive with thousands of other songs. Alfred Hitchcock based his film Rear Window (1954) (starring James Stewart as a Life wartime photographer) on Bergman and Capa's romance. Ingrid Bergman Rose In 1960, Bergman was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a motion pictures star at 6759 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1984, a hybrid tea rose breed was named 'Ingrid Bergman', in honor of the star. Her portrayal of Ilsa Lund from Casablanca was parodied by Kate McKinnon in one episode of Saturday Night Live. In the opening montage of the 72nd Academy Awards, Billy Crystal as Victor Laszlo made a parody out of Casablanca's final scene. In the 80s, Warner Bros made 'Carrotblanca' as a homage to Bogart and Bergman's character in Casablanca. In When Harry Met Sally (1989), Casablanca is a recurring theme, with the lead characters arguing over the meaning of its ending throughout the film. In Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1981), with some creative editing, the Steve Martin's character is having a conversation with Alicia Huberman from Notorious. In Lake House (2006), the Sandra Bullock's character is watching the kiss scene from Notorious. The kiss scene between Bergman and Spencer Tracy from Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is included in Cinema Paradiso (1989) closing scene. Bergman's Ilsa also inspired the role of 'Ilsa Faust' played by Rebecca Ferguson in Mission Impossible film series. She was told by Tom Cruise and director McQuarrie to review Notorious, Casablanca as well as several of Bergman's films as preparation for her role. When Tom Cruise made an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon to promote the movie, he mentions Ingrid Bergman several times.

Near the end of the movie, another poster of Bergman can be seen by the side of a road. One of the original soundtracks for the film is named 'Bogart and Bergman.' Bergman's publicity photo from Notorious has been used as the front cover of the book by Dan Callahan, The Camera Lies; Acting for Hitchcock (2020). In the book by Nora Roberts, The Collector, Ingrid Bergman is mentioned (2014). Bergman's love affair with Robert Capa has been dramatised in a novel by Chris Greenhalgh, Seducing Ingrid Bergman (2012).
