    "text": "\"My Love for You (Has Turned to Hate)\" is a song written and recorded by Hank Williams. It was his third single released on Sterling Records in April 1947. After issuing two singles containing mostly spiritual music, \"My Love for You (Has Turned to Hate)\" was the kind of bitter love song that Williams would become famous for, its narrator turning away a remorseful lover who wishes to come back. It was recorded on February 13, 1947 in Nashville with Fred Rose producing and featured Tommy Jackson (fiddle), Dale \"Smokey\" Lohman (steel guitar), Zeke Turner (electric guitar), and Louis Innis (bass). Like his previous two releases on Sterling, the single did not chart, but they did well enough for Hank to eventually land a contract with MGM Records in April 1947. ==Discography== ==References== Category:1947 songs Category:Songs written by Hank Williams Category:Hank Williams songs ",
