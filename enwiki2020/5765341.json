    "text": "Cyma molding profile (left) and shadow pattern (right) Cymatium, the uppermost molding at the top of the cornice in the classical order, is made of the s-shaped cyma molding (either cyma recta or cyma reversa), combining a concave cavetto with a convex ovolo. It is characteristic of Ionic columns and can appear as part of the entablature, the epistyle or architrave, which is the lintel or beam that rests on the capitals of columns, and the capital itself. Often the cymatium is decorated with a palmette or egg-and-dart ornament on the surface of the molding. > The heights of the parts of the capital are to be so regulated that three of > the nine parts and a half, into which it was divided, lie below the level of > the astragal on the top of the shaft. The remaining parts are for the > cymatium, abacus, and channel. The projection of the cymatium beyond the > abacus is not to be greater than the size of the diameter of the eye [of the > volute]. ==See also== * Molding (decorative) ==References== Category:Columns and entablature ",
