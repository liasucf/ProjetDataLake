The mergers are based on geographical proximity so as to maintain a good spread of schools across the country, MOE said, adding that the sites for the merged schools were chosen based on accessibility to transport and quality of infrastructure. The Anderson Junior College Hostel was planned and construction commenced in 2009. The hostel was opened in 2012,but was permanently closed from 2019 as MOE announced that demand for boarding places continue to fall and there are fewer international students in schools in Singapore. === Merger === On 20 April 2017, it was announced that Anderson Junior College would merge with Serangoon Junior College, with the merged school located at the current site of Anderson Junior College. The merged school was named as Anderson Serangoon Junior College, which is a combination of the two schools' names, from 2019. The former SRJC principal, Mr Manogaran Suppiah proceeded to be the founding principal. == Identity and culture== ===Crest=== The college crest derives its inspiration from the common \u2018flame\u2019 element in Anderson and Serangoon Junior Colleges\u2019 crests and a flower bud that is ready to bloom. The flame design is formed by the college initials \u2018ASR\u2019. The continued use of the flame element represents both colleges\u2019 history and heritage. The flame also symbolises truth, light and hope, which captures the college's intent to develop justice-oriented and service-oriented students who are enlightened and in service of others. The flower bud symbolises youth and vitality and signifies the college as a place that nurtures leaders for the nation. With each petal of the flower embodying the college colours, this reinforces the way in which the college seeks to nurture students who are adventurous in thinking and boundless in imagination while remaining grounded and empathetic citizens of the nation. ===Motto=== The college motto is Discere Servire-Non Mihi Solum, which is Latin for To Learn, To Serve-Not for Myself Alone. === House system === For competitive intra-school events, the school population is divided into four houses: * Artemis (Green) * Helios (Red) * Athena (Purple) * Poseidon (Blue) A house committee is in charge of each house, with each house having a captain and vice-captain.
