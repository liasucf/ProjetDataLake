He then went to Leeds Grammar School, where he suffered from the attentions of a cruel teacher. In 1827, Cope's father was killed in a stage coach accident. That same year he entered Sass's Academy Sass's Academy . in Bloomsbury, London, and in 1828 became a student of the Royal Academy.

In 1844 he submitted a further design called 'Meeting of Jacob and Rachel,' and was one of the six painters commissioned in July of that year to prepare preliminary drawings, coloured sketches, and specimens of fresco painting for the decoration of the House of Lords. He also received 400 pounds for his design of Prince Henry Acknowledging the Authority of Judge Gascoigne. Cope received a commission to execute this design in fresco, and also another of Edward the Black Prince receiving the Order of the Garter.
