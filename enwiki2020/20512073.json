The Fair was designed to attract businesses from the area of northeastern Poland, as well as Lithuania, Latvia and the Soviet Union. ==Highlights== The first annual Northern Trade Fair took place between August 18 and September 9, 1928. The main pavilion built in the beautiful city-park, along with the entire thematic layout of the exhibit with its 16 divisions, was designed by architect Jan \u0141uczkowski. The fair was visited by the staggering 180,000 guests in the first year. Even though, it never became as successful as similar events in Lw\u00f3w (Targi Wschodnie) or in Pozna\u0144 (Pozna\u0144 International Fair), it was the biggest annual event locally showcasting textiles, furniture, farm animals, furs, tourist equipment, production machinery and many other commercial products. The last fair took place between August 19 and September 3, 1939, but was not finished due to joint Nazi and Soviet attack on Poland.Pawe\u0142 Krasnopolski, Wilno i Wojew\u00f3dztwo Wile\u0144skie 1937, Nak\u0142adem i Drukiem Wiktorii Krasnopolskiej, Wilno, 1937. ==See also== * Pozna\u0144 International Fair * Targi Wschodnie (The Eastern Trade Fair) * Polish culture in the Interbellum ==References== Category:1928 establishments in Poland Category:1939 disestablishments in Poland Category:History of Vilnius Category:Trade fairs in Poland Category:Recurring events established in 1928 Category:Recurring events disestablished in 1939 Category:Festivals established in 1928 ",
