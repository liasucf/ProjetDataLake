    "text": "Acala or Achala ( \"Immovable\") is a dharmapala (protector of the Dharma), prominent in Vajrayana Buddhism and East Asian Buddhism., Jp. rel. dict., pp.242\u2013246 He is classed among the Wisdom Kings and is preeminent among the Five Wisdom Kings of the Womb Realm. Accordingly, his figure occupies an important hierarchical position in the Mandala of the Two Realms. In China, he is known through esoteric Tangmi traditions as Budong Mingwang (\"The Immovable Wisdom King\"). In Japan, he is known as Fud\u014d My\u014d\u014d, which is the on'yomi reading of his Chinese name.Fud\u014d My\u014d\u014d and My\u014d-\u014d, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Acala is especially important in Japanese Buddhism, where he is venerated in the Shingon, Tendai, Zen, and Nichiren sects, as well as in Shugend\u014d. He is also highly revered among some Yakuza members, who often draw on his intense facial expression and demeanor. In later Tantric scriptures, the epithet Ca\u1e47\u1e0daro\u1e63a\u1e47a and Ca\u1e47\u1e0damah\u0101ro\u1e63a\u1e47a became more common, and he is known as such in countries like Nepal and Tibet. ==Overview== Descriptions of his physical appearance derive from such scriptural source as the Mahavairocana Tantra and its annotation., under Fudo Myoo (in Japanese) His face is expressive of extreme wrath, wrinkle-browed, left eye squinted or looking askance, lower teeth biting down the upper lip. He has the physique of a corpulent (round-bellied) child. He bears a straight sword in his right hand, and a lariat or noose in his left hand. He is engulfed in flame, and seated on a huge rock base. Acala is said to be a powerful deity who protects the faithful by burning away all impediments () and defilements (), thus aiding them towards enlightenment. In Japanese esoteric Buddhism, according to an arcane interpretive concept known as the Acala and the rest of the five wisdom kings are considered , or beings whose actions constitute the teaching of the law (the other embodiments teach by word, or merely by their manifest existence). Under this conceptualization, the wisdom kings are ranked superior to the ,:ja:\u8b77\u6cd5\u5584\u795e, added 2008.4.23 (Wed) 06:02 by Boca samba (Japanese interwiki link to Dharmapala) makes this distinction. a different class of guardian deities. Nevertheless, this distinction sometimes fails to be asserted, or the two are openly treated as synonymous by many commentators, even in clearly Japanese religious contexts. The Sanskrit-derived symbol that represents Acala is \u0939\u093e\u0902, conventionally transliterated . However, it has been confounded with the similar glyph (\u0939\u0942\u0902 ), prompting some commentators to mistakenly identify Acala with other deities. This symbol is called a \"seed syllable\" (b\u012bja), and is written using the Siddham script. Some of the other transliterations and variants to his name are \u0100calan\u0101tha, \u0100ry\u0101calan\u0101tha, and \u0100calavidy\u0101r\u0101ja. The Nepalese and Tibetan form of this Buddhist deity is also known as or \"the violent-wrathful\" one. ==History== Kadampa school Originally the Mahayana deity Acalan\u0101tha, whose name means \"immovable protector\", Acala was incorporated into Vajrayana Buddhism as a servant of the Buddha. In Tangmi (Tang-era Chinese Vajrayana), his name was translated as Budong \"immovable\" (, Middle Chinese: /p\u01ddw dungx/). In turn, the deity was imported into Japan as by the priest K\u016bkai (died 835), p.243-4, quote \"\u4e0d\u52d5\u4fe1\u4ef0\u3092\u65e5\u672c\u306b\u3082\u305f\u3089\u3057\u305f\u306e\u306f..\u7a7a\u6d77\u3067\u3042\u308b\" who was studying in China as a member of the Kentoshi mission and founded Shingon Buddhism. Scholars such as Miyeko Murase state that the origins of this Buddhist deity are in the Hindu god Shiva, particularly his attributes of destruction and reincarnation.[a] ; [b] The deity has been popular throughout the Middle Ages and into modern times in Nepal, Tibet and Japan, where sculptural and pictorial representations of him are most often found. Much of the iconography comes from Japan. In Tibetan Buddhism and art, the Buddha Akshobhya, whose name also means \"the immovable one\", presides over the clan of deities to which \u0100cala belongs., p.100, \"Aksobhya, the Buddha who presides over the family (kula) of deities with which Acala is associated\" Other sources refer to the Acala and Ca\u1e47\u1e0daro\u1e63a\u1e47a as an \"emanation\" of Akshobhya, suggesting further assimilation. He evolves into a deity invoked in Buddhist rituals to \"frighten gods, titans, men and destroy the strength of demons\", and he slays all ghosts and evil spirits. In some Buddhist texts such as the S\u0101dhanam\u0101l\u0101, the Hindu gods Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma and Kandarpa (god of love) are said to be \"wicked\" because they cause endless rebirth, and these gods are terrified of Acala because he carries a rope to bind them. In other texts, such as the Mah\u0101vairocana S\u016btra, one dedicated to the Buddha is instructed to visualize the left foot of Acala on his head during meditation, to prevent obstacles in his reaching Praj\u00f1\u0101 (insight). In the Nepalese and Tibetan Buddhist traditions, Vi\u015bvavajr\u012b becomes Acala's consort. ==Japan== Painting of the Akafud\u014d (\"Red Acala\"), My\u014d\u014d-in temple on Mount K\u014dya. Japan, Heian period. In Japan, Acala is known as , which is the on'yomi pronunciation of his Chinese name. He is also known as Fud\u014d for short. ===Iconography=== Wooden sculpture of Acala. Japan, late Heian Period, 12th century Buddhist art since the Heian period has depicted Acala as angry-faced, holding a vajra sword and a lariat. pg. 244 In later representations, such as those used by the yamabushi ascetics, he may have one fang pointing up and another pointing down, and a braid on the one side of his head. The sword he holds may or may not be flaming and sometimes described only generically as a or as , which is descriptive of the fact that the pommel of the sword is in the shape of the talon-like of one type or another. It may also be referred to as . However, in some cases, as in the Akafud\u014d painting, the divinity is seen holding the ,, article on \"akafudo\" by Tanaka, Ichimatsu (\u7530\u4e2d\u4e00\u677e) a sword with the dragon coiled around it which nonetheless also has a vajra-shaped pommel. The flaming nimbus or halo behind the statue is known as the \"Garuda flame\", after the mythical firebreathing bird from Indian mythology. The two boy servants who is usually depicted in attendance to Acala are named and , though there are said to be eight such boy servants altogether and as many as forty-eight servants overall. His seat, the , \"is considered an appropriate iconographic symbol to demonstrate the steadfastness of\" the Fud\u014d. ===Worship=== In Japan, Acala became a focus of worship in his own right, and became installed as the main deity at temples and outdoor shrines. A famous example is the Narita Fud\u014d-d\u014d, a Shingon subsect temple at Narita-san. In Shingon Buddhism, Acala's mantra is directly taken from Sanskrit, and is pronounced in Japanese as \"N\u014dmaku samanda bazaradan sendamakaroshada sohataya hun tarata kan man\". At temples dedicated to Acala, priests perform the , or ritual service to enlist the deity's power of purification to benefit the faithful. This rite routinely involves the use of the as a purification tool. Acala at Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, Singapore Lay persons or monks in yamabushi gear who go into rigorous training outdoors in the mountains often pray to small Acala statues or portable talismans that serve as his honzon. This element of yamabushi training, known as Shugend\u014d, predates the introduction of Acala to Japan. At this time, figures such as the , who appeared before the sect's founder, En no Gy\u014dja, or the Vairocana, were commonly worshiped. Once Acala was added to list of deities typically enshrined by the yamabushi monks, his images were either portable, or installed in hokora (outdoor shrines). These statues would often be placed near waterfalls (a common training ground), deep in the mountains and in caves. Acala also tops the list of Thirteen Buddhas., Japanese Dictionary, p.748, middle row, under \u300c\u5fd7\u3075\u3055\u3093\u30fb\u3076\u3064.. (\u5341\u4e09)\u4f5b\u300d Thus Shingon Buddhist mourners assign Fud\u014d to the first seven days of service. The first week is an important observance, but perhaps not as much as the observance of \"seven times seven days\" (i.e. 49 days) signifying the end of the \"intermediate state\" (bardo). Literature on Shingon Buddhist ritual will explain that Sanskrit \"seed syllables\", mantras and mudras are attendant to each of the Buddhas for each observance period. But the scholarly consensus seems to be that invocation of the \"Thirteen Buddhas\" had evolved later, around the 14th century, p.68 gives \"late Kamakura Period\" and became widespread by the following century, so it's doubtful that this practice was part of K\u016bkai's original teachings. ==Conflations and Confusions== There is claim that Acala is identifiable with one of the \"two kings\" or , or the gate guardian deities in Japan,,p.170, where she gives a walkthrough of the identification of one of the Nio gods as Acala (Fud\u014d) but that assertion is not backed by much of the available commentary on the deity. One source which makes this claim explains that the seed syllable \u0939\u0942\u0902 represents Acala, but Acala's symbol is \u0939\u093e\u0902 as aforementioned, and h\u016b\u1e43 actually belongs to another Wisdom King, . This latter syllabic symbol, , is identified as the \"closed mouth\" character,, p.7, article on \u963f\u543d a-un [a-h\u016b\u1e43] (in Japanese) frequently associated with the \"two kings\" or , whose respective opened or closed mouth features are referred to by the phrase . This probably led to the further assertion that Acala was to be identified with the closed-mouthed Ni\u014d statue represented by the h\u016bm sound. If Acala were a Ni\u014d gate guardian,, articles on \u4ec1\u738b Nio p.674, \u57f7\u91d1\u525b\u795e Shukogoshin p.1084, \u91d1\u525b\u529b\u58eb Kongorikishi p.565 (in Japanese) then by transference he would belong to the class of beings called (also known as in wrestler form), or vajra (lightningbolt) wielding yak\u1e63as (not to be confused with the closely related bodhisattva Vajrap\u0101\u1e47i). Such a case would be contradictory to the aforementioned concept of the \"three wheel-embodiments\", which considers the wisdom-king a higher class of being than the vajrap\u0101\u1e47i yak\u1e63as and other dharmapala guardian deities. Nevertheless, that is strictly a Japanese interpretation. It may be noted that one of the Five Wisdom Kings, Vajrayak\u1e63a, bears the same name as this class of deity. In commentary on Tibetan art, one encounters several references to the \"Acala-Vajrap\u0101\u1e47i\". == Gallery == File:Naritasan Temple angry god in Great Pagoda of Peace.jpg|Modern sculpture at Shinsh\u014d-ji temple == See also == * Index of Buddhism-related articles * Secular Buddhism * Tibetan Buddhism ==References== ==Sources== * * Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary, Kenkyusha Limited, Tokyo 1991, * * * ==External links== *Fudo Myo-O, \u4e0d\u52d5\u660e\u738b O-Fudo-sama in Japan * Ellen Schattschneider \"Fudo Myoo (Acala)\" - In: immortal wishes (2003) *Shingon Buddhist International Institute *Tendai Buddhist Sangha in Denver Colorado Category:Dharmapalas Category:Shingon Buddhism Category:Salakapurusa Category:Wisdom Kings Category:Death gods ",
