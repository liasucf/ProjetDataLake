    "text": "Elgin Avenue Breakdown is a compilation album by The 101ers, Joe Strummer's band before he joined The Clash. It was released on Andaluc\u00eda Records (distributed by Virgin) in 1981 because of The Clash's popularity but mooted at the time that it was a semi-unofficial release due to Joe Strummer's contractual obligations with CBS. The first 500 copies came with a free poster.Taken from p172 of the memoir 'Squat City Rocks' by Richard Dudanski Just a few thousand copies were sold.Taken from p174 of the memoir 'Squat City Rocks' by Richard Dudanski The re-issue by EMI in 2005 has an accompanying booklet with an overview by Allan Jones and detailed notes on each track by Richard Dudanski. ==Track listing== Original releaseTaken from sleeve notes of the original LP on Andalucia Records (AND 101) The original Andaluc\u00eda release of Elgin Avenue Breakdown contained 4 of the 6 songs recorded by Dr Feelgood producer Vic Maile, as a centrepiece. He had agreed to their use on the album in return for royalties. The 101ers owned the rights to the BBC Maida Vale recordings so they could also be used. However most of the Pathway material recorded by Roger Armstrong was not allowed on. There was one exception: 'Sweet Revenge'. Partly this was a cross promotional idea because Chiswick wanted to release the track as a single when they found out about plans for the album. The other fact is that the 101ers had allowed Roger's use of 'Five Star Rock n Roll Petrol' from the BBC Maida Vale Sessions as the B side for 'Keys to your Heart' on Chiswick's 1976 single. Roger felt honour bound to allow the use of one Pathway track on Elgin Avenue Breakdown.See p.151 of the first edition of 'Last Gang in Town' by Marcus Gray Some observations on the songwriting: 'Usually Woody would come up with the lyrics and an idea for the melody and chords, and then develop it further with Clive, before bringing it to the band room where we would all knock it around until it took final shape.'Taken from p47 of the memoir 'Squat City Rocks' by Richard Dudanski In mid-January 1976 Mole was replaced by Dan Kelleher. Here are a few observations on Dan's contribution: 'Apart from his experience and dexterity on bass, he had other skills to offer. The backing vocals was one area that immediately improved with not just his singing but also with the harmony parts that he arranged, and then there were two or three songs on which he sang lead vocal, which would give Joe a welcome breather at strategic points in the set. He also helped me in working out new drum patterns.'Taken from p89 of the memoir 'Squat City Rocks' by Richard Dudanski The official credits are for Strummer and the 101ers unless otherwise noted. #\"Letsagetabitarockin'\" - 2:07 #\"Silent Telephone\" - 2:20 #\"Monkey Business\" (live) (Chuck Berry) - 2:22 #\"Shake Your Hips\" (live) (Slim Harpo) - 3:26 #\"Junco Partner\" (live) (Trad. arr.
