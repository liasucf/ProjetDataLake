Her father, Michael Moynihan was a TD for Kerry South from 1981\u201387 and 1989\u201392. She worked as a bank official before becoming involved in politics in 1991 when she was elected to Kerry County Council. She was first elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann at the 1992 general election as a TD for Kerry South, succeeding her father. She was re-elected at every election until 2007.

Moynihan\u2013Cronin is a former Chairperson of the Labour Party. On 11 October 2005, she announced that she would not stand for re-election at the forthcoming general election due to ill-health. Her decision to retire presented considerable difficulties for the Labour Party to retain her seat, as the party performed poorly at the local elections in 2004, failing to elect any councillors within the constituency. However, on 28 October 2006, she announced that she would stand in the forthcoming general election, having overcome her health difficulties. However, she failed to retain her seat. In June 2011 she returned to politics when she was co-opted onto Kerry County Council to represent the Killarney area, filling the seat left vacant when Marie Moloney was elected to Seanad \u00c9ireann. In 2013, she stood down from the Council and was replaced by Sean Counihan who subsequently lost the seat in the 2014 local elections. ==References== Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Labour Party (Ireland) TDs Category:Members of the 27th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 28th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 29th D\u00e1il Category:20th-century women Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la Category:21st-century women Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la Category:Local councillors in County Kerry Category:People educated at Skerry's College Category:People educated at Dominican College Sion Hill ",
