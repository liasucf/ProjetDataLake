    "text": "Boston Corner is a hamlet of the town of Ancram in Columbia County, New York, United States and the town of Northeast in Dutchess County, New York. It was formerly part of the town of Mount Washington, Massachusetts and was ceded from Massachusetts to New York on January 11, 1855, because its geographical isolation from the rest of Massachusetts made maintaining law and order difficult. Three railroads\u2014New York Central's Harlem Line, the Poughkeepsie and Eastern Railway, and the Rhinebeck and Connecticut Railroad\u2014once served the hamlet. All lines have since been abandoned. *See Boston Corners station ==History== ===1878 description=== Note, that although the above description implies the Morrissey/Sullivan fight (and resulting riot) was a primary cause for the annexation; those events actually took place on October 12, 1853, twelve weeks after the cession was agreed to by both states but more than a year before Congress made the transfer official. ==External links== *The Battle of Boston Corners Category:Hamlets in New York (state) Category:North East, New York Category:Hamlets in Columbia County, New York Category:Hamlets in Dutchess County, New York Category:Border irregularities of the United States Category:1855 establishments in New York (state) ",
