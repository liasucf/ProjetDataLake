    "text": "Kiwix is a free and open-source offline web browser created by Emmanuel Engelhart and Renaud Gaudin in 2007. It was first launched to allow offline access to Wikipedia, but has since expanded to include other projects from the Wikimedia Foundation as well as public domain texts from Project Gutenberg. Available in more than 100 languages, Kiwix has been included in several high- profile projects, from smuggling operations in North Korea and encyclopedic access in Cuba to Google Impact Challenge's recipient Biblioth\u00e8ques Sans Fronti\u00e8res. == History == Founder Emmanuel Engelhart sees Wikipedia as a common good, saying \"The contents of Wikipedia should be available for everyone! Even without Internet access. This is why I have launched the Kiwix project.\" After becoming a Wikipedia editor in 2004, Engelhart became interested in developing offline versions of Wikipedia. A project to make a Wikipedia CD, initiated in 2003, was a trigger for the project.Sutherland, Joe. Emmanuel Engelhart, Inventor of Kiwix: the Offline Wikipedia Browser. In: Wikimedia Blog. 12 September 2014. Accessed on 26 November 2014. In 2012 Kiwix won a grant from Wikimedia France to build kiwix-plug, which was deployed to universities in eleven countries known as the Afripedia Project.Citazine article on Afripedia (in French) In February 2013 Kiwix won SourceForge's Project of the Month award and an Open Source Award in 2015. == Description == The software is designed as an offline reader for web content. It can be used on computers without an internet connection, computers with a slow or expensive connection, or to avoid censorship. It can also be used while travelling (e.g. on a plane or train). Users first download Kiwix, then download content for offline viewing with Kiwix. Compression saves disk space and bandwidth. All of English-language Wikipedia, with pictures, fits on a USB stick (78 GB as of March 2020, or 16 GB with no pictures). All content files are compressed in ZIM format, which makes them smaller, but leaves them easy to index, search, and selectively decompress. The ZIM files are then opened with Kiwix, which looks and behaves like a web browser. Kiwix offers full text search, tabbed navigation, and the option to export articles to PDF and HTML. There is an HTTP server version called kiwix-serve; this allows a computer to host Kiwix content, and make it available to other computers on a network.Kiwix-serve The other computers see an ordinary website. Kiwix-hotspot is an HTTP server version for plug computers, which is often used to provide a Wi-Fi server. == Available content == Reading Wikipedia through Kiwix on a boat in the South Pacific. A list of content available on Kiwix is available for download, including language-specific sublists. Content can be loaded through Kiwix itself. Since 2014, most Wikipedia versions are available for download in various different languages. For English Wikipedia, a full version containing pictures as well as an alternative version containing text only can be downloaded from the archive. The servers are updated every two to ten months, depending on the size of the file. For English Wikipedia, the update frequency is thus substantially lower than the bzip2 database downloads by the Wikimedia Foundation, which are updated twice a month. Besides Wikipedia, content from the Wikimedia foundation such as Wikisource, Wikiquote, Wikivoyage, Wikibooks, and Wikiversity are also available for offline viewing in various different languages.Zim archive for Kiwix In November 2014 a ZIM version of all open texts forming part of Project Gutenberg was made available.Engelhart, Emmanuel. 50.000 public domain books available to everybody, everywhere, offline. Wikisource-l-Mailinglist, Wikimedia Foundation. 19 November 2014. Accessed on 26 November 2014. Besides public domain content, works licensed under a Creative Commons license are available for download as well. For example, offline versions of the Ubuntu wiki containing user documentation for the Ubuntu operating system,Ubuntuusers Hilfsmittel ZIM editions of TED conference talksKiwix archive for TED and videos from Crash Course are available in the Kiwix archive as ZIM file formats.Kiwix archive for additional content == Deployments == Kiwix can be installed on a desktop computer as a stand-alone program, installed on a tablet or smartphone, or can create its own WLAN environment from a Raspberry Pi. As a software development project, Kiwix itself is not directly involved in deployment projects. However, third party organizations do use the software as a component of their own projects. Examples include: Locations of 13 universities in 11 countries where Kiwix was deployed as part of the Afripedia Project. * Universities and libraries that can't afford broadband Internet access. ** The Afripedia Project set up kiwix servers in French-speaking universities, some of them with no Internet access, in 11 African countries. * Schools in developing countries, where access to the internet is difficult or too expensive. ** Installed on computers used for the One Laptop per Child project. ** Installed on Raspberry Pis for use in schools with no easy access to electricity in Tanzania by the Tanzania Development Trust. ** Installed on tablets in schools in Mali as part of the MALebooks project. ** Used by school teachers and university professors, as well as students, in Senegal. ** Deployed in Benin during teacher training seminars run by Zedaga, a Swiss NGO specialized in education. ** The Fondation Orange has used kiwix-serve in its own French language technological knowledge product they have deployed in Africa.Fondation Orange: le programme \"\u00e9coles num\u00e9riques\" . ** A special version for the organization SOS Children's Villages was developed, initially for developing countries, but it is also used in the developed world. * At sea and in other remote areas: ** Aboard ships in Antarctic waters. ** By the Senegalese Navy in their patrol ships. ** Included in Navigatrix, a Linux distribution for people on boats. * On a train or plane. * In European and US prison education programs. ===Package managers and app stores=== Medical Wikipedia app on a smartphone. Kiwix was formerly available in the native package managers of some Linux distributions. However, Kiwix is currently not available in most package databases, due to XULRunner, a program on which Kiwix depends, being deprecated by Mozilla and removed from the package databases. Kiwix is available in the Sugar and ArchLinux Linux distributions. It is also available on Android. Kiwix is available in the Microsoft Store, on Google Play, and Apple's iOS App Store. Since 2015, a series of \"customized apps\" have also been released, of which Medical Wikipedia and PhET simulations are the two largest. ==See also== * Internet-in-a-Box * XOWA * Wikimedia offline projects * Wikipedia:Database download == References == ==External links== * * * Explanation of Kiwix from Wikimania 2013 * Kiwix stories on the Wikimedia Blog Category:Wikipedia Category:Cross-platform software Category:Free software Category:Free and open-source Android software Category:Free educational software Category:Free web server software Category:Free mobile software Category:Software using the GPL license Category:2010 software Category:Software development Category:Travel gear Category:Internet privacy software Category:Internet censorship Category:Book censorship Category:E-book suppliers Category:Publishing Category:Software that uses XUL Category:Articles containing video clips ",
