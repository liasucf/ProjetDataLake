    "text": "Crofton is an area of Thursby, Allerdale district of Cumbria, England. It is west-southwest of Carlisle. Historically a part of Cumberland, Crofton was one of three small townships in the centre of the former Parish of Thursby. It was originally called Croft-town, derived from the word Croft, as the town standing upon the Crofts. Notable landmarks were Crofton Place, the seat of Sir Wastel Brisco, Bart. It also became a surname to John Crofton. Although Crofton Hall was demolished in approximately 1955\u20131956, some of the estate buildings remain, and the gateway and pond are notable remnants. Crofton Estate was taken over by the Land Settlement Association a government initiative to get poorer people involved in agriculture and horticultural production. The LSA estate was composed of Bank End, East Park, West Park, Shaw Wood and Whinnow Land Settlement Small Holdings. The LSA was disbanded in 1974 and some small holders were left destitute, others continued to farm the land as private owners. The LSA small holders were from a variety of backgrounds and places, Irish, Polish, Scottish, Cumbrian and other parts of England. The stables of the Brisco estate house were used as the LSA headquarters. The lake has recently been reinstated after decades of neglect. ==Gallery== Image:J M Briscoe08 08 200712 45 07IMG2764 1 Crofton Hall farm.jpg|Surviving farm building near site of Crofton Hall Image:J M Briscoe08 08 200712 43 13IMG2762 1 Crofton Hall lake.jpg|Lake near the site of Crofton hall ==See also== *Listed buildings in Thursby ==External links== *Thursby, GENUKI article.
