    "text": "\"Looks That Kill\" is a song by American heavy metal band M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. It was released in 1983, on the group's second album Shout at the Devil. It is released on January 4, 1984. ==Background== Written by bassist Nikki Sixx, the track was released as a single on January 4, 1984. It spent 10 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States, peaking at #54 and #12 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce played the song live for the first time on October 31, 1982 at the Concord Pavilion in Concord, CA. ==Music video== The music video was filmed at A&M; Records' main sound stage. It features the band in a post-apocalyptic setting where they trap a group of women in a cage while performing the song. In the middle of the video, the warrior queen (played by Wendy Barry) appears to release the women before confronting the band. The band follows and surrounds her, but she disappears, leaving a flaming pentagram on the ground. ==Track listing== # \"Looks That Kill\" \u2013 4:07 # \"Piece of Your Action\" ==Personnel== *Vince Neil \u2013 lead vocals *Mick Mars \u2013 guitar *Nikki Sixx \u2013 bass *Tommy Lee \u2013 drums, percussion ==Legacy== *The song was covered by the punk band Diesel Boy and appeared on the compilation album Punk Goes Metal. *The main riff is identical to the main riff of the Dokken song \"Young Girls\" on the Breaking the Chains album, which was released two years prior to M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's Shout at the Devil.

Due to copyright issues, this song was excluded from the European release of the game. *Until 2012, political talk radio program The Savage Nation included \"Looks That Kill\" in its opening sequence, including the lyric, \"Now, listen up.\" *Cover version was released as a bonus track on Static-X's album Cult of Static. *It appears in Guitar Hero 5. *The pre-chorus guitar riff is strikingly similar to the dungeon theme to the video game Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. The song was released four years prior to the game's release. *British hard rock band Chillpace covered the song in October 2019, changing the lyrics to be about the climate change movement. ==References== *Shout at the Devil - M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce ==External links== *Music video Category:M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce songs Category:1984 singles Category:Songs written by Nikki Sixx Category:Song recordings produced by Tom Werman Category:1983 songs Category:Elektra Records singles ",
