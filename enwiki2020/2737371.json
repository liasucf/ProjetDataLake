A. (editor), D. M. Iskhakov (article author) (1994). \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u044b \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438. \u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f (Narody Rossii. Encyclopedia) (in Russian). Bolshaya Rossiyskaya Encyclopedia. . p. 238 They speak a sub-dialect of the Tatar language's middle dialect. Russian and Tatar historians usually treat the Na\u011fayb\u00e4ks as an integral part of Volga Tatars; a minority considers Na\u011fayb\u00e4ks a separate ethnicity in their own right. In the 1989 Russian census, 11,200 people identified themselves as Na\u011fayb\u00e4ks, falling to 9,600 in 2002. == Origin == The origins of the Na\u011fayb\u00e4ks are unclear. One theory places the Na\u011fayb\u00e4ks as an offshoot of the Nogais. Other accounts claim that they are Volga Tatars baptized after the fall of Kazan Khanate. The most plausible theory, according to the 1994 Russian encyclopedia, says that the ancestors of the Na\u011fayb\u00e4ks traditionally lived in central districts of the Khanate, east of Kazan, and most likely descended from Nogay and Kipchak people. In the 18th century, they also assimilated a small group of Christians from Iran and Central Asia.\"62 male christians (Persians, Arabs, Bukharans, Karakalpaks)\" - Tishkov, Iskhakov (1994), p. 238 The most popular theory in Tatarstan is that they were Serving Tatars from Kazan Khanate that were forcibly baptized by Ivan IV and relocated to the border between nomad Bashkirs, that were already incorporated to Russia and nomad Kazakhs as border keepers. Yet another theory says that the Na\u011fayb\u00e4ks were Tatarized Finno-Ugric peoples that kept the Kazan Khanate's borders. Demonym Na\u011fayb\u00e4k emerged in written sources only in the 19th century although a fringe theory asserts its existence as far as the 17th century. The village of Nagaybak, which gave name to present-day Nagaybaksky District, is known since the 1730s. == Historical record == Reliable historical evidence of Na\u011fayb\u00e4k people start with a 1729 record detailing 25 villages of \"newly baptized [Tatars]\" (Russian: \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0451\u043d\u044b) in Ufa uezd, east of the Kama River. Most likely, they settled around Ufa in the second half of the 17th century after the completion of the defensive Kama Abatis Line (1652\u20131656). During the Tatar and Bashkir revolts of late 17th and early 18th century the Na\u011fayb\u00e4ks remained loyal to the Russian Empire. The government rewarded them with a wholesale transfer of the Na\u011fayb\u00e4ks into the Cossack estate, and assigned the Na\u011fayb\u00e4ks to the defense of Menzelinsk Fort. Another defensive fort was built in 1736 in the village of Nagaybak, 64 versts from Menzelinsk (present-day Bakalinsky District). The new fortress became the hub of the \"newly baptized\", and by 1744 the nearby Na\u011fayb\u00e4k population increased to 1359 people in eleven villages.One selo (larger village) and ten smaller villages, not counting Fort Nagaybak itself - Tishkov, Iskhakov (1994), p. 238 Two more Na\u011fayb\u00e4k villages were recorded in 1795. The original Na\u011fayb\u00e4k race was gradually diluted with an inflow of other Christianized Tatars recruited into cossack service (Yasak Tatars and Tipt\u00e4rs). The government mandated their relocation into predominantly Christian Na\u011fayb\u00e4k lands to evade daily contact between Christian and Muslim Tatars, and the new settlers rapidly intermarried with the locals. In 1773, Nagaybak Fort was caught in the way of Yemelyan Pugachev's rebellion. Loyal cossacks and troops, headed by captain Rushinsky, fled to Menzelinsk; most of the remaining soldiers joined the rebellion and participated in the siege of Ufa. Pugachev installed a \"newly baptized Persian\" by the name of Tornov, as the ataman of Nagaybak. In January 1774, a small government company pushed the rebels out of Nagaybak Fort, but Tornov returned in strength and regained control over the fort. Two weeks later a whole corps of government troops crushed the rebellion. The fort became a base for punitive expeditions against the remains of Pugachev's army.R. V. Ovchinnikov, L. N. Bolshakov. Encyclopedia of Orenburg Oblast. Nagaybak Fortress (in Russian). Retrieved October 25, 2010 Na\u011fayb\u00e4k cavalry participated in the Napoleonic Wars and in the subsequent occupation of Paris. In 1842, the Na\u011fayb\u00e4k cossacks relocated from their former host in Nagaybak Fort eastward, to the former Orenburg Governorate. Here, they founded a chain of villages named after the battles of Napoleonic Wars, including present-day Parizh, named after the Battle of Paris in 1814, Fershampenuaz (after the Battle of F\u00e8re-Champenoise), Kassel (after engagements near Kassel in Hesse), Trebiy (after the Battle of Trebbia) in 1799, etc. Fershampenuaz remains the center of Nagaybaksky District to present. Another group of the Na\u011fayb\u00e4k settled in present-day Orenburg Oblast. These Na\u011fayb\u00e4ks settled on traditionally Muslim territories, and by the beginning of the 20th century they converted back to Islam and were reassimilated into Tatar ethnos. Traditional Na\u011fayb\u00e4k female clothing is similar to that of the Ker\u00e4\u015fen Tatars, but male clothing contains many elements of the Cossack uniform. == References == Category:Ethnic groups in Russia Category:History of the Cossacks in Russia Category:Orenburg Cossacks Category:Tatar Christians Category:Volga Tatars ",
