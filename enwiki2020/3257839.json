He expected to play more in his early professional years, but the outbreak of the Second World War stopped matches from taking place, most notably one in which he participated against Bulgaria which was abandoned mid-match. In total Bia\u0142as played for Lech Pozna\u0144 in 64 matches, scoring 27 goals. He later became a football trainer and instructor for Lech after his retirement in 1951. ==References== Category:1919 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Polish footballers Category:Poland international footballers Category:Lech Pozna\u0144 players Category:Polish football managers Category:Lech Pozna\u0144 managers Category:Sportspeople from Pozna\u0144 Category:Association football forwards ",
