Olat Re'iyah, vol. I, pp. 221-222. Ecclesiastes points to the futility of seeking joy and pleasure in life, however, the Talmud comments that this is only true of joy which has not been derived from the fulfilment of a commandment.Talmud, Tractate Shabbos, 30b. Elsewhere, the bible links happiness to finding the right answer to a question.Shuchat, Wilfred. The Creation According to the Midrash Rabbah. Devora Publishing. 2002. ==Halacha== In the Talmud, one of the primary sources for traditional Jewish Law (Halacha), happiness and sadness are associated with particular months of in the Jewish calendar. One is meant to increase in happiness during the month of Adar and decrease in happiness during the month of Av.Talmud, Tractate Ta'anis 29a.Talmud, Tractate Ta'anis 26b. However, in both Maimonides's main legal work and the Code of Jewish Law by Rabbi Yosef Karo, the decrease in joy during Av is mentioned while the increase during Adar is omitted. Some commentaries ascribe this omission to the fact that happiness has no concrete guidelines and depends on the nature of each individual. Whereas acts of sadness and mourning where required by law requires specification and delineation.Nimukei Orach Chaim, Piskei Tshuvos, Chapter 686, fn 17.\"Rambam & Shulchan Aruch, What Happened To Halachic Happiness In Adar?\" revach.net. Revach L'tefila. Accessed November 11, 2014. And though happiness during Adar isn't mentioned in the main Codes, it is mentioned by the Magen Avraham, one of the main commentaries published alongside Karo's work written by Rabbi Avraham Gombiner, and in Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (the \"Abbreviated Code of Jewish Law\") by Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried.\"Mishenichnas Adar Marbim B\u2019Simcha.\" torahlab.org. Tuesday, February 28, 2012. There is a Jewish custom to hang a sign in one's home on which is written \"When Adar comes in, increase in happiness\" (Mishenichnas Adar marbin b'simcha, ). Some have the custom to place this sign to cover the customary portion of a wall left unfinished serving the memory of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem (this wall area is commonly referred to as the zecher l'churban).Yalkut Avraham 686Piskei Tshuvos 686:5. According to Maimonides, happiness is an essential element in the performance of Jewish rituals. Maimonides rules in his Code, Yad Hachazakah, that the performance of all commandments must accompany an abundance of joy.Yad Hachazakah, Hilchot Lulav 8:15. In Jewish Law, rejoicing during the Jewish holidays is considered a biblical commandment. Maimonides ruled that this obligation is fulfilled by drinking wine and eating meat.Cohen, Alfred S. \"Vegetarianism from a Jewish Perspective.\" Halacha and Contemporary Society. KTAV Publishing House. 1984. Page 295-297. The Talmud states \"One should not stand up to pray while immersed in sorrow, or idleness, or laughter, or chatter, or frivolity, or idle talk, but only while rejoicing in the performance of a commandment (b'simcha shel mitzvah).\"Eisenberg, Ronald L.

Dvar Yerushalayim. Beit Shemesh: Jerusalem. 1989. Page 12. The Zohar also notes that the Hebrew word for \"in happiness\" (b'simcha, ) contains the same letters as the Hebrew word for \"thought\" (machshava, ).Glazerson, Matityahu. Torah, Light, and Healing. Page 157.

Lulu.com. Accessed November 11, 2014. The Kabbalist Rabbi Elazar ben Moshe Azikri stated \u201cThough a person may be depressed on account of his sins, he must be joyful at the time of Divine service.

Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, the Arizal, is believed to have only received his wisdom due to his rejoicing in the mitzvoth. ==Hasidism== Joy is considered an essential element of the Hasidic way of life.

By contrast, one who is happy is likely to feel energized and motivated to control oneself.\"Rabbi Schneur Zalman of Liadi on Sadness and Joy.\" Joy: An Anthology. Chabad.org. Accessed November 11, 2014. The third Chabad Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn of Lubavitch taught that a person should be happy and remain in good spirits despite any lack in yirat shamayim (\"fear of heaven\"). Though one might consider his/herself wicked and feel he or she deserves some form of divine punishment, one should see no conflict in feeling \"happiness... from one side, and bitterness [over his or her spiritual state] from the other side\".Freeman, Tzvi. \"Guilt & Happiness\u2014Let the ecstasy override all else.\" Joy: An Anthology. Chabad.org. Accessed November 11, 2014.Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn of Lubavitch, Kitzurim V'ha-arot L'tanya, page 46. According to the Hasidic rebbe, Rabbi Moshe Leib of Sassov (1745\u20131807), a prayer filled with joy is greater than a prayer filled with tears. Quoting the Talmudic saying \"The gates of tears are never locked\", Rabbi Moshe states that for tears, the supernal gates are simply unlocked, while joy has the ability to destroy the gates completely.Rabbi Moshe Leib of Sassov, Likutei Ramal, \"Parshat Vayetsei.\" The Baal Shem Tov taught that prayer conducted with joy is greater than prayer conducted with tears.Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov. Sefer Baal Shem Tov. Colel Bais Yosef. Melbourne: Australia. 2008. The Baal Shem also taught that when the Tzadikim of the generation are joyful they awaken joy in the entire world, and that anger is dispelled by an emphasis on love for God and joy in performing the commandments. ==Mussar== According to Rabbi Yisroel Salanter, founder of the Mussar movement, a person may be able to conquer and rectify one's negative impulses by being joyful in his or her service to God.Rabbi Yisroel Salanter. Sefer Imrei Binah, Kevutzas Maamarim. Warsaw. 1878. Page 29. According to Rabbi Naftali Amsterdam \"Mussar study in ecstasy (b'hispaalus) renews the heart and gives joy to the soul.\"Etkes, Immanuel.

According to Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, the third Chabad Rebbe, by assuming the demeanor and mannerisms of one who is joyful, even if the one practicing these actions does not feel happy, such behaviors will lead to true feelings of happiness, because behaviors and actions impact the heart.Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, Igrot Kodesh, Kehot Publication Society, Brooklyn: New York, p. 324. According to Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, forcing oneself to be happy leads to truly feeling happy. According to Rabbi Nachman, even a faked, ungenuine, happiness has the power to transform one's personal situation and lead him or her to experiencing genuine joy.Maimon, Nasan. \"Rabbi Nachman's Secret of Happiness.\" Breslov.com.
