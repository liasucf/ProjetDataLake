    "text": "Montana Highway 38 (MT 38), also known as Skalkaho Road or Skalkaho Highway is a state highway in the US state of Montana approximately long. It provides seasonal direct land connections between the communities of Hamilton on the west and Phillipsburg and Anaconda on the east via Skalkaho Pass. The highway and the pass take their name from the Salish word Sq\u0313x\u0323q\u0313x\u0323\u00f3, \"many trails\". ==Route description== MT 38 begins south of Hamilton, at an intersection with U.S. Highway 93 (US 93). Initially, the highway heads south along a former section of US 93\\. The road takes an abrupt turn eastward as it passes through Grantsdale, begins its meandering climb southeast along Skalkaho Creek and northeast along Daly Creek through the Sapphire Mountains, turning southeast again before it crosses Skalkaho Pass. From the pass, MT 38 descends along the West Fork Rock Creek, past the Gem Mountain sapphire mine and crosses Rock Creek near its headwaters, going into Eagle Canyon before making a northeasterly run to its terminus at MT 1, south of Phillipsburg and west of Anaconda. Except for its westernmost and easternmost segments, MT 38 is mostly gravel. ===Winter closure=== Due to heavy snowfall on the narrow winding road, MT 38 is closed from east of Daly Creek to west of Gem Mountain, usually from late November until Memorial Day weekend. ===Scenic routes=== Skalkaho Highway is part of, or links to, these scenic routes: * The Skalkaho Highway Scenic Byway * Phillipsburg Scenic Loop (MT 38, Rock Creek Road, Montana Secondary Highway 348 and MT 1) * Rock Creek Road Back Country Byway (connects to Interstate 90 east of Clinton at exit 126) * Pintler Scenic Route (MT 1) ==Major intersections== ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== * Skalkaho Highway from dangerousroads.org * 038 Category:Transportation in Ravalli County, Montana Category:Transportation in Granite County, Montana ",
