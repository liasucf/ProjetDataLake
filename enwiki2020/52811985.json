    "text": "Faceless World is the third studio album by German heavy metal band U.D.O., released on February 25, 1990, by RCA Records. It was recorded in Dierks Studios in Cologne and mastered in Hamburg. The album's musical style features a more light approach than previous and future albums, and achieved great success. Previous guitarist Andy Susemihl had left the band, but takes writing credits for \"System of Life\", \"Living on a Frontline\" and \"Future Land\". Guitarist Wolla B\u00f6hm was added, but is only credited and pictured in the album as a member, although he does perform with the band in the \"Heart of Gold\" music video. All guitar work was done by Mathias Dieth. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Udo Dirkschneider \u2013 vocals * Mathias Dieth \u2013 guitars, backing vocals * Thomas Smuszynski \u2013 bass * Stefan Schwarzmann \u2013 drums ==Production== *Stefan Kaufmann \u2013 production, mixing *Uli Baronowsky \u2013 engineering, mixing *Ananda Kurt Pilz \u2013 cover art *Wolfgang Burat \u2013 photography *Tim Eckhorst \u2013 design (anniversary edition) ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ==References== == External links == * Category:1990 albums Category:U.D.O. albums ",
