    "text": "The Angermuseum, Erfurt's first municipal museum, was officially opened on 27 June 1886. It is housed in a building that used to house Erfurt's public weighing scales, where travelling mechants would bring their wares to be weighed for payment of the city's customs duties. The museum faces Anger square; Anger meaning a town common. Originally, only the gallery on the first floor was used for the museum. The building was constructed from 1706\u20131711. It was designed by the architect Johann Maximilian von Welsch. It is a Franconian\u2013influenced baroque building with St. Martin, the city's patron saint, in its gable triangle. == History == The extensive collection of works by the painter was donated to the city of Erfurt in 1883 by his son, Friedrich Paul Nerly, with the obligation to found a museum for the presentation of the collection. Friedrich Nerly the Elder had emigrated to Venice in 1835 and afterwards had painted exclusively aquarelles and drawings of the city. More than 700 of the works created in Italy are part of the collection of the Angermuseum. Initially, the collection focused \u2013 inspired by the works of Friedrich Nerly \u2013 on landscape painting, portraits and still lifes from the 18th to 20th centuries. It is a special feature of the Angermuseum that the citizens here were involved in the expansion of the museum and not the princes as in Weimar and Gotha. Here \u2013 above all \u2013 families like the and the family are to be mentioned. Die \u201ethe honorary class of wealthy and educated citizens\u201c (in German: \"Die Honoratiorenschicht aus Besitz\u2013 und Bildungsb\u00fcrgern\") determined the character and orientation of the museum for a long time. In 1912 the later Reichskunstwart Edwin Redslob took over the management of the museum, afterwards Walter Kaesbach. Kaesbach was supported in acquiring new artistic works by the Jewish shoe manufacturer Alfred Hess, who supported the purchase of numerous then current works by painters such as Lyonel Feininger, Emil Nolde, Ernst Barlach, Gerhard Marcks, Max Pechstein and others and thus caused the Angermuseum's collection to become known as one of the greatest of German Expressionism. The museum experienced its heyday in the 1920s under the long-term director Herbert Kunze. A famous example of the Expressionist collection at the time is the so-called \"Heckelraum\", which the artist Erich Heckel designed in 1922/24 with expressionist mural paintings under the motto \"Stages of Life\" (in German: \u201eLebensstufen\u201c). They are the \"only preserved monumental mural paintings of German Expressionism\" (in German: \"einzige erhaltene monumentale Wandmalereien des deutschen Expressionismus\") and can still be seen on the ground floor of the museum. Through the National Socialists and their definition of Degenerate Art many works of the museum's collection of modern art at the time were destroyed or removed. Some works were also lost during the escape of the Hess family from Germany. It is the ambition of the museum to restore this collection. In autumn 2017, Christian Rohlfs' oil painting \"Weiden II\" (in English: \"Willows II\"), which had originally been in the museum since 1918, was acquired for 68,500 euros. In 1935 the library moved out of the Angermuseum, which now had the entire building at its disposal. From 1944 the museum was closed down, the works of art were moved out because of the aerial war and thus saved from bombs and artillery fire. In 1976/77 the building was extensively reconstructed. On June 1, 2010, after five years of renovation work, the museum was reopened as an art museum of the state capital Thuringia with the special exhibition \"Natalya Goncharova. Zwischen russischer Tradition und europ\u00e4ischer Moderne\" (in English: \"Between Russian Tradition and European Modernity\" in cooperation with the Stiftung Opelvillen R\u00fcsselsheim and the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. Today, the museum is supported by the Association of the \"Freunde des Angermuseums\" (in English: \"Friends of the Angermuseum Association\") and the \"Verein f\u00fcr Kunst und Kunstgewerbe Erfurt\" (in English: \"The Association for Arts and Crafts Erfurt\") and, in addition to the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, possesses extensive graphic and handicraft material. == Collection Focus == * Medieval Collection: Erfurt and Thuringian Art of the Middle Ages, Sculpture, Painting, Craft Art : The collection of medieval art includes works from the heyday of Erfurt art in the second half of the 14th century, including four altarpieces from the St. Augustine's Monastery (Erfurt) and sandstone\u2013sculptures from the workshop of the master of the Severisarcophagus. Eight panel paintings, among them the small panel \"Christus als guter Hirte\") (in English: \"Christ as Good Shepherd\") (around 1540/1550) and the paintings \"Lasset die Kindlein zu mir kommen\" (in English: \"Let the little children come to me\") (around 1535) and \"Heilige Nacht\" (in English: \"Holy Night\") (around 1540), and a winged altar are attributed to Lucas Cranach the Elder and the Cranach workshop. * Collection of paintings: German painting from the 18th century to the present day * Graphic Collection: Graphics and drawings from five centuries : The collection consists of more than 30,000 works. In 2004, the Erfurt graphic artist Rudolf Franke, co-founder of the Erfurt studio community, donated 14,000 prints to the museum. Not only works by German artists can be seen, but also works by Czech and Slovak artists. In addition, works by \"unadjusted\" artists from the GDR such as Gerhard Altenbourg, Hermann Gl\u00f6ckner and Roger Loewig are in particular part of the collection. * Arts and crafts collection: Faience, Glass, Porcelain, Furniture, contemporary Jewellery : The museum's glass collection comprises over 800 objects from more than eight centuries. However, at present only 122 objects can be seen in the permanent exhibitions.
