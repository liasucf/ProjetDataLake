During the construction he died brutally, and it is said that his spirit still occupies the area.About.com - The Legend of White Lick Creek BridgeSouthern Indiana Ghosts - Danville Bridge- Danville IndianaHaunted Indiana - White Lick Creek Bridge As legend goes, the work had progressed up to the point when the workers were pouring concrete into wooden frames. One day \"Dad\" Jones was on a wooden platform above a framework that was being filled when all of sudden the platform broke. His fellow workers had to helplessly watch \"Dad\" Jones sink deeper and deeper into the concrete. It is said that the workers could hear him pounding his fists against the sides of the framework until he finally suffocated.
