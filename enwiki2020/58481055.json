Having vanquished them, he goes to put on his armor, only to be met with a succession of strange events: first the armor appears occupied by a creature with stretching limbs, then a lovely young woman appears and sprouts butterfly wings. As Quixote approaches her, the wings become giant tentacles and attack him. Just as Quixote is fighting back and reaching for his lance, he wakes up to find himself pummeling his servant Sancho Panza. ==Release== The film was released by M\u00e9li\u00e8s's Star Film Company and is numbered 1367\u20131371 in its catalogues. It was registered for American copyright at the Library of Congress on 10 October 1908, and was first announced in the French publication Cin\u00e9-Journal on 20 October 1908. The film is currently presumed lost. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Films directed by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s Category:Films based on Don Quixote Category:French films Category:French silent short films Category:Lost French films Category:French black-and-white films ",
