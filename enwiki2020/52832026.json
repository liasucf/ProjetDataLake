She is most known for being the founder, namesake and executive creative director of the Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Ensemble. She was inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1989, and named to the National Council on the Arts by President Bill Clinton in 1999. In 2005 she also received a Kennedy Center Medal of Honor during the Center's \"Masters of African American Choreographers\" series. ==Early life== Parker Robinson is the daughter of an African-American actor and a white musician. She faced extreme prejudice while growing up in 1950s Denver. At the age of 10 she nearly died in Dallas when a segregated hospital refused to admit her for a kidney condition quickly enough to prevent heart failure. Doctors expected her to be bedridden the rest of her life. She overcame the condition and threw herself into dancing in order to overcome the pain from the physical condition and emotional challenges of dealing with racism. By age 15 she was already teaching University level dance classes at the University of Colorado. She graduated from Colorado Women's College, now a part of the University of Denver.http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/cleo-parker-robinson-39 ==Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Ensemble== She is most noted for founding the Cleo Parker Robinson Dance Ensemble in 1970.
