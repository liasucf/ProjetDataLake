He was listed on Time magazine's Time 100, an annual list of the hundred most influential people in the world, in 2008. Al-Waleed is a grandson of Ibn Saud, the first Saudi Arabian king, a nephew of all Saudi Arabian kings since, and a grandson of Riad Al Solh (Lebanon's first prime minister). He is the founder, chief executive officer and 95 percent owner of the Kingdom Holding Company, a company with investments in companies in the financial services, tourism and hospitality, mass media, entertainment, retail, agriculture, petrochemicals, aviation, technology and real-estate sectors. In 2013, the company had a market capitalization of over $18 billion. Al-Waleed is Citigroup's largest individual shareholder, the second-largest voting shareholder in 21st Century Fox, a minor shareholder in Zaveriwala Holdings LLC and owns Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V and part of the Plaza Hotel. Time has called him the \"Arabian Warren Buffett\". In November 2017 Forbes listed Al-Waleed as the 7th-richest man in the world with a net worth of $39.8 billion. On 4 November 2017, he and other prominent Saudis (including fellow billionaires Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim and Saleh Abdullah Kamel) were arrested in Saudi Arabia, in a purge that the Saudi government characterized as an anti-corruption drive. The allegations against Prince Al-Waleed include money laundering, bribery, and extorting officials. Some of the detainees have been in the Ritz-Carlton, Riyadh since then.Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, billionaire investor, is released from custody in Saudi Arabia, relative says (27 January 2018) Al-Waleed was released from detention on 27 January 2018, following a financial settlement of some kind, after nearly three months in detention.Ben Hubbard, Billionaire Saudi Prince, Alwaleed bin Talal, Is Freed From Detention , The New York Times (27 January 2017). In March 2018 he was dropped from the World's Billionaires list due to lack of current information. ==Early life and education== Al-Waleed was born in Jeddah on 7 March 1955 to Prince Talal bin Abdul-Aziz, long-time-known as The Red Prince, and Mona Al Solh, daughter of Riad Al Solh (Lebanon's first prime minister). His father was Saudi Arabia's finance minister during the early 1960s, before he went into exile due to his advocacy for political reform. Al-Waleed's grandmother was Munaiyir, an Armenian whose family escaped the Armenian Genocide. She was presented by the emir of Unayza to Ibn Saud in 1921, when she was 12 years old and Ibn Saud was 45. Al-Waleed's parents separated when he was seven, and he lived with his mother in Lebanon. He first attended Pinewood College in Beirut. As a boy, he ran away from home for a day or two at a time (sleeping in unlocked cars) before attending military school in Riyadh, the King Abdul Aziz Military Academy. In 1974, he returned to Lebanon, attending the Choueifat School and then Manor School. Al-Waleed received a bachelor's degree in business administration from Menlo College in California in 1979, finishing in two-and-a-half years, and a master's degree with honors in social science from Syracuse University in 1985, finishing in eleven months. ==Business career== Al-Waleed began his business career in 1979 after graduating from Menlo College. He returned to Saudi Arabia, which was in the midst of the 1974\u201385 oil boom.Saudi Arabia. Economic Policy During the Oil Boom, 1974\u201385 . country-data.com Operating from a small, four-room cabin in Riyadh and $30,000 start-up money provided by Prince Talal, al-Waleed formed Kingdom Establishment in 1980. When that money ran out in a few months, he secured a $300,000 loan from the Saudi American Bank, partly owned by Citibank. Rather than taking a commission for facilitating contracts as the legally required middleman, Al-Waleed insisted on a stake in the project. His first success was in 1982, partnering with a South Korean construction company, and from then on, his commissions were used to fund his real estate deals. In his own words, \"All the money I used to get from this construction I would plough back into real estate, and in the stock market, both.\" After the end of the Saudi oil boom, Al-Waleed acquired the underperforming United Saudi Commercial Bank (USCB). Through mergers with Saudi Cairo Bank (SCB), forming United Saudi Bank (USB), and the Saudi American Bank (SAMBA), it became a leading Middle Eastern bank. The hostile takeover of USCB in 1986, the merger with SCB in 1997, and the merger of USB with SAMBA in 1999, were the first of their kind in the Kingdom. He then secured a majority in Al-Azizia Panda, merging it with the Savola Group, and took over National Industrialization Company. By 1989, his net worth was $1.4 billion, and included stakes in Canary Wharf, Four Seasons Hotel Group, and News Corporation. When Al-Waleed turned to the international market, he focused on \"established brands going through hard times,\" as Riz Khan puts it. Al-Waleed would do his homework, and then wait for the proper purchase entry point. He invested about $250 million in Chase Manhattan, Citigroup, Manufacturers Hanover, and Chemical Bank. After seven months, he sold his stakes in the other banks and concentrated on investing in Citicorp, acquiring 4.9 percent of the bank. Though the worst performing bank of the four, Al-Waleed considered Citicorp had the best potential. In Sept. 1990, Citibank was undercapitalized due to real estate credit losses and exposure to Latin America debt, prompting a need for a capital reserve. By Nov. they were actively seeking investors. Based on his banking experience in the Kingdom, Al-Waleed agreed in Jan. 1991 to invest $590 million, about half his accumulated wealth, in a five-year convertible security paying 11 percent interest. By Feb., that took his total investment in Citicorp to $797 million, or about 15 percent of the company. Though he had received a Federal Reserve temporary waiver to own such a large portion of the company, Al-Waleed sold enough shares in 1993 to get below the 10 percent threshold. Still, he was the largest shareholder in the largest US financial institution at the time. Yet, in Alwaleed's words, \"It is not a relationship, it's an alliance. We are there forever with them.\" Sandy Weill says of Al-Waleed, \"I think what he did really saved the bank.\" In 1993, Al-Waleed purchased a 10 percent stake in Saks Fifth Avenue for $100 million. A flagship store was then opened in Riyadh. In 1994, Al-Waleed secured a 50 percent controlling interest in Fairmont, and a 22 percent stake in the Four Seasons. In 1995, he bought a 42 percent stake in the Plaza Hotel. Then, in 1996, he bought the George V for $185 million, and spent $120 million renovating it for a reopening in Dec 1999. Regarding Al- Waleed's investment in the George V, Issy Sharp states, \"...he created value where no one else could...\" Also in 1994, Al-Waleed bought a 24 percent stake in Euro Disney for $345 million. In 1995, Kingdom Establishment for Trading and Contracting was reorganized as the Kingdom Holding Company, and Al-Waleed announced construction of the Kingdom Centre, Kingdom Hospital, Kingdom School and Kingdom City. Also in 1995, he bought a 2.3 percent share of Mediaset after haing invested earlier in the Arab Radio and Television Network, acquiring 30 percent. In Oct. 1995, Al-Waleed joined a consortium which paid $1.2 billion for control of Canary Wharf, with his share of the company amounting to 6 percent, costing him $66 million. In March 1997, Al-Waleed purchased a 5 percent stake in Apple Inc., making him the largest shareholder. In Nov. 1997, he purchased 1 percent share of Motorola for $287 million and a five percent share of Netscape for $146 million, before its purchase by AOL and merger with Time Warner. In 2001 and 2002, Al-Waleed increased his stake in AOL Time Warner by another $540 million. He also invested in MCI, Fox Broadcasting and other technology and media companies. Time reported in 1997 that Al-Waleed owned about five percent of News Corporation, which he purchased for $400 million, making him the third largest shareholder. In April 1999, Al-Waleed purchased an additional $200 million of preferred shares. In 2010 his News Corporation stake was about seven percent ($3 billion). Three years later News Corporation had a $175 million (19-percent) investment in al- Waleed's Rotana Group, the Arab world's largest entertainment company. A review of his holdings implied that al-Waleed had sold his investment in AOL.Gustin, Sam (16 August 2010) \"News Corp., the Saudi Prince and the 'Ground Zero Mosque'\" , Daily Finance (AOL), via Rich, Frank (21 August 2010) \"How Fox Betrayed Petraeus\" ,The New York Times, p. WK8 NY ed.. Retrieved 22 August 2010. In April 1997, Al-Waleed purchased a 4 percent stake in Planet Hollywood for $57 million, and another 16 percent in Nov 1998 for $45 million. In Oct. 1997, Al-Waleed bought 27 percent of M\u00f6venpick Hotels & Resorts, which he increased to 33 percent in 2003. In 1999 The Economist expressed doubts about the source of his income, wondering if he was a front man for other Saudi investors: > He has not earned enough income from his investments to pay for all that he > has spent in the 1990s. The mystery goes back to that first stake in > Citicorp. The prince has declared that this money came entirely from his > personal funds. He says he started out in 1979 with a loan of just $30,000 > from his father. He also mortgaged a house that his father had given him, > raising something like $400,000.

Nevertheless, by > 1991 Prince Alwaleed had felt able to risk an investment of $797m in > Citicorp. Al-Waleed invested in WorldCom, Priceline.com, Coca-Cola, and Ford Motor Company, totaling almost $2 billion. In Asia, he bought 5.9 percent of Daewoo for $50 million, which he increased to 18 percent with an additional $100 million investment, 3 percent of PROTON Holdings for $46 million, 3 percent of Ong Beng Seng's Hotel Properties Ltd., and $50 million worth of Hyundai Motor Company bonds. In Africa, he invested $50 million, acquiring 10 percent of Sonatel, 10 percent of Ecobank, 13.7 percent of United Bank for Africa, and 14 percent of CAL Bank. Investments which turned out poorly included WorldCom, Priceline, Teledesic, and KirchMedia, besides PlanetHollywood and Euro Disney. His stake in Apple was sold in 2005. Al-Waleed also invested in Eastman Kodak and TWA, both of which performed moderately well. In 2002, Al-Waleed formed Kingdom Hotel Investments to oversee his hotel assets. By 2003, Al-Waleed owned 100 percent of Rotana, and 49 percent of LBC Sat. His real-estate holdings included large stakes in the Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts and New York's Plaza Hotel; al-Waleed sold half his shares in the Plaza in August 2004. He has invested in London's Savoy Hotel and Monaco's Monte Carlo Grand Hotel.

In January 2006, in partnership with the U.S. real-estate firm Colony NorthStar, Kingdom Holding acquired Toronto-based Fairmont Hotels and Resorts for an estimated $3.9 billion. It was reported in 2009 that Al-Waleed owned 35 percent of Research and Marketing Group (SRMG), a large mid-east media company. The 2004 Forbes list of wealthiest people had Al-Waleed fourth, with a net worth of $21.5 billion. More than $1.3 billion was in hotel holdings. In August 2011 al-Waleed announced that his company had contracted with the Saudi Binladin Group to build the world's tallest building, the Kingdom Tower (at a height of at least ) for SR 4.6 billion.

In December 2011 Al-Waleed invested $300 million in Twitter, purchasing secondary shares from insiders. The purchase gave Kingdom Holding a \"more than 3% share\" in the company, which was valued at $8 billion in late summer 2011.Knickmeyer, Ellen, \"Saudi prince invests $300M for 3% stake in Twitter\" , Zawya Dow Jones via affiliate Market Watch, 19 December 2011. Retrieved 19 December 2011 In 2015, he announced that he would donate his fortune to charity at an unspecified date. He had previously donated $3.5 billion over the course of 35 years through his charitable organization Alwaleed Philanthropies. ==Arrest and release== On 4 November 2017, Al-Waleed was arrested in Saudi Arabia in a \"corruption crackdown\" conducted by a new royal anti-corruption committee. This was done on authority of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, his cousin (both are grandsons of Ibn Saud, first monarch and founder of Saudi Arabia), with the aim of consolidating his position. Just days before his arrest, Al- Waleed reportedly contacted US-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi (who had publicly criticized the Saudi government in the past) and invited him to return to the Kingdom in order to contribute to Mohammad bin Salman's vision. The authorities in Saudi Arabia were demanding at least $6 billion from Prince Al Waleed bin Talal in exchange of his release. In total, 320 princes, ministers and businessmen were detained. Al-Waleed was released from detention in late January 2018, nearly three months after his arrest, after he and most of the other Saudi notables arrested the previous year had made a financial settlement of some kind with the Saudi government. Prince Mutaib bin Abdullah, the son of the late King Abdullah (1924\u20132015), was released after paying a reported $1 billion. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the price for his release was $6 billion. The Saudi Arabia government did not disclose charges or produce evidence and the negotiations were held in secret. ==Forbes dispute == In 2013, Kerry Dolan, editor of Forbes annual billionaires' list, wrote an article accompanying the list entitled \"Prince Alwaleed and the Curious Case of Kingdom Holding Stock\". According to Dolan, al-Waleed attached great importance to the Forbes list and she alleged a correlation between changes in the share price of Kingdom Holdings and the annual run-up to the list's publication. In the Forbes article, Dolan wrote that al-Waleed would blind copy Dolan on text messages he sent to prominent people in an attempt to impress her. She spent a week with him in Riyadh in 2008, at his behest, touring his palaces. In 2006 Forbes estimated al-Waleed's net worth at $7 billion less than he claimed. He telephoned Dolan at home, according to the editor, \"nearly in tears\". Al-Waleed had Kingdom Holding's chief financial officer fly to New York before a previous list was published to ensure that Forbes used his stated numbers. The article explains the methodology behind Forbes 2013 estimate of his wealth at $20 billion, examines Kingdom Holdings' share performance and contains Dolan's communications with Kingdom Holdings CFO Shadi Sanbar. Sanbar demanded that al-Waleed's name be removed from the billionaires' list if Forbes did not increase its valuation of his wealth. Dolan wrote, \"As Forbes asked increasingly specific questions in the process of fact-checking this story, the prince acted unilaterally the day before it was published, announcing through his office that he would 'sever ties' with the list.\" Sanbar said in a press release, \"Prince Alwaleed has taken this step as he felt he could no longer participate in a process which resulted in the use of incorrect data and seemed designed to disadvantage Middle Eastern investors and institutions.\" Al-Waleed said in a March 2013 interview with The Sunday Telegraph that he would pursue legal action against Forbes. \"They are accusing me of market manipulation,\" Al-Waleed said. \"This is all wrong and a false statement. We will fight it all the way against Forbes.\" He called the Forbes list \"flawed and inaccurate\", saying that it \"displays bias against Middle East investors and financial institutions.\" The Guardian reported that on 6 June 2013, al-Waleed had brought a defamation claim in London against the publisher of Forbes; its editor, Randall Lane, and two journalists from the magazine. Forbes expressed surprise at the libel action and the fact that it was filed in London. According to the magazine, \"The Prince's suit would be precisely the kind of libel tourism that the UK's recently-passed libel reform law is intended to thwart. We would anticipate that the London high court will agree. Forbes stands by its story.\" As of 20 June, Forbes had not been served with papers. A statement issued by the Kingdom Holding Company accused Forbes of publishing a \"deliberately insulting and inaccurate description of the business community in Saudi Arabia and specifically, Forbes denigration of the Saudi stock exchange (Tadawul), which is one of the most regulated in the world\". According to al-Waleed, the magazine used an \"irrational and deeply flawed valuation methodology, which is ultimately subjective and discriminatory\". On 16 June 2015, Forbes and al-Waleed released a joint statement announcing that they had settled their dispute \"on mutually agreeable terms\". The opening of the Saudi stock exchange to foreign investors was cited as key in the defendants' willingness to consider the stock price of al-Waleed's publicly traded Kingdom Holding Company in valuing the KHC component of his wealth. == Political views == Al-Waleed tweeted a statement with a picture of himself holding an honorary Palestinian passport, \"In response to the news of the visit to Israel: I have not and will not visit Jerusalem or pray inside it until its liberation from the Zionist enemy. And I carry an honorary Palestinian passport\".Twitter message (1:11 PM - 24 July 2015) In 2015, al-Waleed was criticised for offering to buy Bentley cars for Saudi fighter pilots involved in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. In a tweet later deleted, he said: \"In appreciation of their role in this operation, I'm honoured to offer 100 Bentley cars to the 100 Saudi [fighter] pilots\". ==Philanthropy== In July 1997, Al-Waleed invested $10 million with the Palestinian Investment and Development Company (PADICO), and then helped cofound the Jerusalem Development and Investment Company (JEDICO). In 2002, al-Waleed donated $500,000 to help fund the George Herbert Walker Bush scholarship at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. and donated \u00a318.5 million to Palestinian families during a TV telethon ordered by Saudi King Fahd to help relatives of Palestinians after Israeli operations in the West Bank city of Jenin. In 2004, he contributed $17 million to victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. On 1 July 2015, al-Waleed held a press conference announcing his intention to donate $32 billion to philanthropic causes. He said that the funds would be used for humanitarian projects such as the empowerment of women and youth, disaster relief, disease eradication and building bridges of understanding between cultures. ===Donation after 11 September attacks=== After the 11 September attacks, al-Waleed gave a cheque for $10 million to New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, despite Saudi opposition. In a written statement after his donation, he said: \"At times like this, we must address some of the issues that led to such a criminal attack. I believe the government of the United States of America should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stance toward the Palestinian cause.\" As a result of that statement, Giuliani returned his cheque. Al-Waleed said to a Saudi weekly magazine about Giuliani's rejection of his check, \"The whole issue is that I spoke about their position [on the Middle East conflict] and they didn\u2019t like it because there are Jewish pressures and they are afraid of them.\" Giuliani replied to this by suggesting that al-Waleed's comment was actually part of the problem: \"There is no moral equivalent for this [terrorist] act. There is no justification for it... And one of the reasons I think this happened is because people were engaged in moral equivalency in not understanding the difference between liberal democracies like the United States, like Israel, and terrorist states and those who condone terrorism. So I think not only are those statements wrong, they're part of the problem.\" ===Western universities=== In 2005, al-Waleed gave Georgetown University $20 million to create the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU) in the university's School of Foreign Service, the second largest donation in the school's history. On 8 May 2008, al-Waleed gave \u00a316 million to Edinburgh University to fund a \"centre for the study of Islam in the contemporary world\". He has also endowed the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud Center for American Studies and Research (CASAR). The Institute for Computational Biomedicine at Weill Cornell Medical College is named for al-Waleed. The Centre of Islamic Studies at the University of CambridgeCentre of Islamic Studies, Cambridge and the Islamic Studies Program at Harvard University are also named after him. ===First Saudi female pilot=== Al-Waleed is considered a proponent of female emancipation in the Saudi world. He financed the training of Hanadi Zakaria al-Hindi as the first Saudi woman commercial airline pilot, and said at her graduation that he is \"in full support of Saudi ladies working in all fields\".First Saudi Female Pilot Lands Job With Kingdom Holding , 24 November 2004.

In 1983, owned by Khashoggi, it appeared as the Flying Saucer (the yacht of James Bond's villain, Largo) in Never Say Never Again. It was sold to Donald Trump, who renamed her the Trump Princess. Al-Waleed bought the yacht after Trump experienced financial problems in the late 1980s.Prince Al- Waleed's yacht . Yachts.monacoeye.com (31 May 2006). Retrieved on 17 January 2014.
