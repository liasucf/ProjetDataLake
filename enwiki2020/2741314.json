It is situated in the Orkdalen valley along the river Orkla about west-southwest of the city of Trondheim. Svorkmo is located about south of the village of Vormstad and about south of the urban area of Orkanger-Fannrem- R\u00e5bygda. The lake Svorksj\u00f8en lies about to the east of the village. For about 100 years beginning in the 17th century, Svorkmo was an industrial centre of major importance. It was in Svorkmo that the L\u00f8kken copper mine's smelters were situated. Many people worked in the smelting works and the industry formed the base of one of Norway's largest non-city communities, with hotels, bakeries, saw mills, and the Svorkmo Station (a railway station which still exists, though now only as a museum). Today Svorkmo is no more than a small village with few facilities (little more than a supermarket and a campsite) and the people who live there work elsewhere. Svorkmo is a classic example of the effects of the centralization on the Norwegian economy. The village has a population (2018) of 298 and a population density of . ==References== Category:Orkland Category:Villages in Tr\u00f8ndelag ",
