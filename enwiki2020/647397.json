Due to the unorthodox nature of the schedule (and little incentive to enforce it), some teams frequently played many more games than others did in any given season. This led to some disputed championships and two teams claiming the title. Generally, the team with the best winning percentage (with some minimum number of games played) was awarded the Pennant, but other times it was the team with the most victories. The \"games behind\" method of recording standings was uncommon in most black leagues. *1937 Kansas City Monarchs\u2020, Monarchs awarded first-half championship but Chicago American Giants had better record and disputed it, no second half of the season was recorded and Kansas City was awarded the Pennant. *1938 Memphis Red Sox\u2020 *1939 Kansas City Monarchs *1940 Kansas City Monarchs *1941 Kansas City Monarchs *1942 Kansas City Monarchs\u2021 *1943 Birmingham Black Barons\u2020\u2021 *1944 Birmingham Black Barons\u2021 *1945 Cleveland Buckeyes\u2021 *1946 Kansas City Monarchs\u2021 *1947 Cleveland Buckeyes\u2021 *1948 Birmingham Black Barons\u2020\u2021 \u2020 \u2013 Pennant was decided via a split-season schedule with the winner of the first half of the season playing the winner of the second half of the season. \u2021 \u2013 Pennant winner went on to play in the Negro World Series. ==== Post- integration champions ==== *1949 Baltimore Elite Giants *1950 Indianapolis Clowns *1951 Indianapolis Clowns *1952 Indianapolis Clowns *1953 Kansas City Monarchs *1954 Indianapolis Clowns *1955 Birmingham Black Barons (first half); Detroit Stars (second half)\u2020 *1956 Detroit Stars *1957 Kansas City Monarchs \u2020 \u2013 Pennant was decided via a split-season schedule with the winner of the first half of the season playing the winner of the second half of the season. === League play-offs === From 1937 through 1938, and again in 1943 and 1948, the NAL split the season into two halves. The winner of the first half played the winner of the second half for the league Pennant. As mentioned above, disputes also occurred in the split season finishes. *1937 \u2013 Kansas City Monarchs (first half champions), second half not documented *1938 \u2013 Memphis Red Sox (1st half) over Atlanta Black Crackers (2nd half), contested play-off declared \"no contest\" after Memphis up 2 games to 0 games *1943 \u2013 Birmingham Black Barons (one half) beat Chicago American Giants (one half), 3 games to 2 games *1948 \u2013 Birmingham Black Barons (1st half) beat Kansas City Monarchs (2nd half), 3 games to 1 game === Negro World Series === For the duration of the league, a Negro World Series took place seven times, from 1942 through 1948. The NAL Pennant winner met the champion of the rival Negro National League. Five out of the seven years, the Negro American League team (below in bold) succumbed. *1942 \u2013 Kansas City Monarchs beat Washington Homestead Grays, 4 games to 0 games *1943 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays beat Birmingham Black Barons, 4 games to 3 games *1944 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays beat Birmingham Black Barons, 4 games to 1 game *1945 \u2013 Cleveland Buckeyes beat Washington Homestead Grays, 4 games to 0 games *1946 \u2013 Newark Eagles beat Kansas City Monarchs, 4 games to 3 games *1947 \u2013 New York Cubans beat Cleveland Buckeyes, 4 games to 1 game *1948 \u2013 Washington Homestead Grays beat Birmingham Black Barons, 4 games to 1 game == References == * Category:Negro baseball leagues Category:Defunct baseball leagues in the United States Category:African- American sports history Category:Sports leagues established in 1937 Category:1937 establishments in the United States Category:Defunct professional sports leagues in the United States ",
