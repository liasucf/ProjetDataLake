    "text": "The Order of Ecumenical Franciscans (OEF)Order of Ecumenical Franciscans is a group of men and women devoted to following the examples of Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Clare of Assisi in their life and understanding of the Christian gospel: sharing a love for creation and for those who have been marginalized. Leadership is shared by a five member council. An example of Christian ecumenism, the OEF includes members of many different denominations, including Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and Eastern Orthodox. The OEF understands its charism to include not only ecumenical efforts and the traditional emphases of the Franciscans in general, but also to help to develop relationships among the various Franciscan orders. Some reference books consider them one of a number of third orders of Saint Francis, other classify them separately. ==References== == External links == * Category:Franciscan spirituality in Protestantism Category:Christian ecumenical organizations Category:Protestant third orders ",
