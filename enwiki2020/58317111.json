Located at the crossing of two roads, Ramla was a strategically important fortress. The nearby Lydda was the most important shrine of the warrior saint, Saint George. The crusaders held an assembly and decided to establish a bishopric in the town. They elected a Norman cleric, Robert of Rouen, the first bishop of the new see. ==List of bishops== * Robert of Rouen * Roger == Sources == * * == References == Lydda Category:1099 establishments in Asia ",
