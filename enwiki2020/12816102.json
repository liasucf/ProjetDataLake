    "text": "Best of Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive Live is an album of concert material from a 1985 Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive performance in Tallahassee, Florida. The album was released on Curb Records in 1994, and should not be confused with All Time Greatest Hits Live, which was a 1990 re-release of the 1986 album Live Live Live, featuring other material sourced from the same concerts. The album is notable for being one of three releases (two live, one studio) featuring a short-lived reunion line up of the band featuring founding members Randy Bachman, Tim Bachman, and C. F. \"Fred\" Turner, who had not played together since Tim's departure after the second BTO album. This lineup was joined by drummer Garry Peterson from Randy's old band, The Guess Who. The set includes versions of both The Guess Who's first hit, a cover of \"Shakin' All Over\", and their greatest hit, the original song \"American Woman\". ==Track listing== #\"Takin' Care of Business\" (Randy Bachman) - 5:47 #\"Blue Collar\" (C.
