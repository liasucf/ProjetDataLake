The Chapel could seat up to 80 people but had little use in recent years and was sold by Farnham Town Council for use as a Meeting House for the Plymouth Brethren. The cemetery is divided into six sections allowing for the burial of different denominations; there is a small children's area and an area dedicated to the interment of cremated remains.Wrecclesham Cemeteries - Wrecclesham History Group database The cemetery has 13 military burials, two from World War I and eleven from World War II, the latter including two pilots - P/O Evelyn Creen Stuart Wilson- Steele of 219 Squadron (killed 1942)P/O E J S Wilson-Steele - RAF and Commonwealth Air Forces Roll of Honour - Royal Airforce Commands database and Sgt Michael Henry John Kilburn.

He was initially buried along with the other seven members of his crew at Dyce Old Churchyard near Aberdeen. However, his family in Farnham must have applied to the RAF to have his remains returned to his home town and in 1943 he was reinterred in the plot here.Biography of Sergeant Michael Henry John Kilburn RAFVR Buried nearby is Lt Ernest Lyford of the Home GuardDover's Home Guard - The Dover Historian website who was accidentally killed in 1943 aged 55 while training with bombs.Green Lane Cemetery, Farnham - Commonwealth War Grave Commission databaseMilitary burials at Green Lane Cemetery - Surrey in the Great War: A County Remembers - A Surrey Heritage (Surrey County Council) project ==Notable burials== Sir Robert Pringle in Green Lane Cemetery *Eille Norwood (1861\u20131948) actor known for playing Sherlock Holmes in a series of silent films.Notable burials- Farnham Town Council website *Sir Robert Pringle (1855-1925) Director-General of the Army Veterinary Corps 1910-1917Grave of Sir Robert Pringle - Find a Grave *George Sturt (1863\u20131927), English writer on rural crafts and affairs ==References== ==External links== *Green Lane Cemetery, Farnham on Find a Grave Category:Farnham Category:Cemeteries in Surrey Category:Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries in England Category:Buildings and structures in Farnham Category:1914 establishments Category:Open Brethren churches in the United Kingdom ",
