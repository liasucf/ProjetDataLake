Here Jagadamba (Suryakantam) her shrew aunt, persecutes her a lot. Narayana Rao couple has two more children Kotaiah a soft-hearted person and Kathyayani a pampered daughter. As an astrologer, Narayana Rao predicts that Lakshmi is going to get a rich alliance at the age of 18. Meanwhile, Kotaiah runs away from the house and joins the army. Years roll by, Jagadamba arranges a match for Katyayani (Sowcar Janaki), but they like Lakshmi (Jamuna) when a rift arises and Lakshmi is necked out. During that plight, she reaches Tirumala hills where she rescues a misplaced baby of a wealthy couple Nagabhushnam (K.V.S.Sarma) & Seetamma (Hemalatha), she carefully handovers her back when the couple gives shelter to Lakshmi. Thereafter, Lakshmi gains everyone's affection in the house, especially their elder son Ravi (N. T. Rama Rao) falls for her. Even his parents respect his decision, but it begrudges Nagabhushnam's brother-in-law Jaganadham (Dr. Sivaramakishnaiah) as he aspires to perform his daughter Parvathi's espousal with Ravi. So, he ploys by bribing Jagadamba & her brother Sambaiah (Ramana Reddy) and they make a falsity that Lakshmi is already married. Learning it, humiliated Lakshmi leaves the house. On the other side, Kathyayani elopes with her love interest Pullaiah (Relangi) along with the money. At the same time, Kotaiah (Nagabhushnam) returns and brings out the reality from baddies when out of shock Ravi collapses. Parallelly, Pulliah spoils the amount brought by Katyayani when Lakshmi helps them to back up. Knowing the whereabouts of Lakshmi through Katyayani, Kotaiah brings her back.
