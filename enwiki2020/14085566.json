A New York native, he is recognized for his lifelong association with Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes. Stann originally joined the band in 1980.

Also Joseph \"Holistic Life Master\" is an Integrative Energy Healer, Shaman, Reiki Master, Certified Clinical Hypnotherapist, Intuitive, Teacher, and Paranormal Investigator. Joseph\u2019s interest in Holistic Healing began in the late 1960s, is organic, and was born out of personal experiences. At age 12, he had suffered a heart attack as a result of a cardiac birth defect. Several years later, early in his career as a professional musician, he began to experience painful arthritis which threatened his ability to perform, as well as making the rigors of touring more difficult. After unsuccessful attempts with traditional medicine, Joseph turned to Holistic Healing and successfully healed both his arthritis as well as his heart condition. ==Discography== *Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes, Into The Harbour (2005) \u2013 Saxophone *Gary U.S. Bonds, Back In 20 (2004) \u2013 Saxophone *Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes, Going To Jukesville (2002) \u2013 Saxophone *Joey Stann, Family Tree (2001) \u2013 Saxophone *Gary U.S. Bonds, King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents...
