Retrieved September 10, 2016 In spite of Freddie's popularity, in 1928-29 Callahan replaced it with Clarabelle's Cousin in order to cash in with the \"pretty girl\" melodrama strip boom. By late 1930 however it became a crime-adventure strip for a few months until ending in early 1931. Both strips' Sunday editions ran a topper called Dizzy's Eating House, about a low-rate diner and its scheming owner. Chic Young briefly worked for Callahan as an assistant around 1923 after being hired by KFS. Callahan's style proved influential on Young, who further developed it with his own strips Dumb Dora and Blondie. After a stint as an editorial cartoonist, Callahan revived the Piffle family format with Home, Sweet Home, which ran between 1935 and 1940. After a period as a freelance artist, he found employment in the comic book industry for Dell Publishing (where he worked on Tillie the Toiler stories) and DC Comics. Callahan died in 1954 of a heart attack while playing tennis. He was survived by his wife Helen Carr (m. 1926) a former showgirl who performed diving stunts. ==References== ==External links== * Comic book credits for Jack Callahan * Category:1888 births Category:1954 deaths Category:American comic strip cartoonists Category:Artists from New York City ",
