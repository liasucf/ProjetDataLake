    "text": "Aca\u00e7\u00e1 (from Yoruba: \u00e0k\u00e0s\u00e0, also known as eko) is a ritual food central to ceremonies of Afro-Brazilian religions, specifically to Candombl\u00e9 rituals. It is found in the states of Bahia, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Sul, and Rio de Janeiro. Pai Cido de Osun Eyin stated that \"life [...] is sustained, and is renewed with the ritual offering of aca\u00e7\u00e1.\" It has at least two variations: a similar dish made of black beans (aca\u00e7\u00e1 de feij\u00e3o-preto) and a drink (aca\u00e7\u00e1 de leite) also used in Candombl\u00e9 rituals. Aca\u00e7\u00e1 is the only ritual food required in Candombl\u00e9; it is offered to all the orix\u00e1s in the Candombl\u00e9 pantheon. Aca\u00e7\u00e1 made of white corn is offered to Oxala; that made of yellow corn is offered to Oxossi. ==Preparation== Aca\u00e7\u00e1 is made of white or red corn soaked in water for a day, which is then passed through a mill to make a paste or dough. The paste or dough is cooked in a pan and stirred continuously to reach a correct consistency. While warm small portions of the dough are wrapped in a clean, folded clean banana leaf and passed over a fire. Finely ground white cornmeal can be substituted for soaked corn. The aca\u00e7\u00e1 is cut into pieces of equal size. They are arranged on a platter to be placed on or near a pegi, or Candombl\u00e9 altar. They also decorate other ritual foods in Candombl\u00e9, notably vatap\u00e1. ==Aca\u00e7\u00e1 de feij\u00e3o-preto== Aca\u00e7\u00e1 de feij\u00e3o-preto () is a variation of the aca\u00e7\u00e1 made from black beans, i.e., the black turtle bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Black beans are substituted for soaked corn, similarly made into a paste, wrapped in banana leaves, and steamed in a pan. Aca\u00e7\u00e1 de feij\u00e3o-preto is specifically offered to the god Ogum. The variation of aca\u00e7\u00e1 is associated with Casa Fanti Ashanti, a Candombl\u00e9 temple of the Jeje-Nag\u00f4 tradition in the neighborhood of Cruzeiro do Anil, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, in the state of Maranh\u00e3o. ==Aca\u00e7\u00e1 de leite== Aca\u00e7\u00e1 de leite () is a fermented drink used in Candombl\u00e9 rituals. It is made from a corn mush to which milk and other seasonings are added. The drink is then fermented. Aca\u00e7\u00e1 de leite is found in Candombl\u00e9 temples in Bahia and the state of Rio de Janeiro. A variation, aca\u00e7\u00e1 de leite de coco, is made from coconut milk. This variation is found in the state of Rio de Janeiro. ==References== Category:Brazilian cuisine Category:Maize dishes Category:Ceremonial food and drink Category:Vegan cuisine Category:Candombl\u00e9 ",
