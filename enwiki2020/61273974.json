(Original description) This neat little species has the usual fusiform shape,. It contains five whorls, exclusive of the apical, not present in our specimens. The whorls are clathrate, with longitudinal ribs and spiral lirae, these being pale ochreous-white, the interstices darker ochreous. The body whorl is slightly prolonged and sculptured in the same way as the upper whorls. One or two of the longitudinal ribs seem thicker than the others, giving a very slightly varicose appearance.
