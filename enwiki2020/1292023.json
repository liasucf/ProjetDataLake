The first state song was \"Old New Hampshire\". This song was originally voted on by the legislature in 1941, but the song lost. In 1943, Rep. Samuel P. Philbrook sponsored legislation to create a contest to pick a state song, but this initiative failed as well. It was not until 1949 that \"Old New Hampshire\" became an official song. The second was \"New Hampshire, My New Hampshire\" in 1963, then \"New Hampshire Hills\" in 1973. In early 1977, \"Autumn in New Hampshire\" became the fourth official song, and an interim board appointed by legislators recommended using only one official song and designating the others \"honorary\" state songs. The board began considering which song to make official, as well as adding four new songs to consideration: \"Oh, New Hampshire (You're My Home)\", \"The Old Man of the Mountain\", \"New Hampshire's Granite State\" and \"The New Hampshire State March\". \"Old New Hampshire\" was voted the official song in late 1977, and the others became \"honorary\". In 1983, a new honorary state song was added: \"New Hampshire Naturally\". ==Rock music== The rock band Aerosmith has its roots in New Hampshire, as lead singer Steven Tyler and guitarist Joe Perry spent their childhood summers in Sunapee.
