Er\u00e7etin responded to this video and started a long-running debate with Beyaz. The original video features Er\u00e7etin driving a car, talking about a breakup. Beyaz's altered version replaced him into passenger seat and replying to her with his excuses. He apologizes with some French accent, since Er\u00e7etin is known for her French covers and album. Er\u00e7etin responded to video by invading Beyaz Show's studio and seizing the studio. She also uses some French accent in response. On 26 December 2014, Beyaz responded to Er\u00e7etin asking her to return the couch. A group of male audience also supports him.

She mockingly tells in the video that the channel management is discussing to cancel Beyaz Show, which is running about 20 years, and replacing it with a documentary. She ends the response with a rhyme, which contains much letter \"r\", referring to Beyaz's disability to pronounce the letter correctly. One week later, on 16 January, Beyaz responded with his male supporters \u0130hsan Varol, Hayko Cepkin, Mustafa \u00dcst\u00fcnda\u011f, Mansur Ark, Emre Karayel and Nuri Al\u00e7o.

On 23 January 2015, Er\u00e7etin make her final response with a group of elder women as \"mothers\". Beyaz's previous supporters \u0130hsan Varol, Hayko Cepkin, Mustafa \u00dcst\u00fcnda\u011f and Emre Karayel videoshopped as kids, while the mothers grounding them. Later Emel Say\u0131n joins Er\u00e7etin and advises her to make peace with Beyaz. She briefly sings \"Mavi Boncuk\", which the song advises one to be friends with everyone. Footballer Demba Ba also briefly appears. Mazhar Alanson, Fuat G\u00fcner, \u00d6zkan U\u011fur, Ata Demirer, Cem Y\u0131lmaz and Y\u0131lmaz Erdo\u011fan also tells Er\u00e7etin to forgive Beyaz.
