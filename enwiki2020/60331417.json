Now presented with the opportunity to do an album in honor of his old friend, Golson assembles a sextet and presents an album that takes the idea of \"I Remember Clifford,\" thoroughly updates it, and extends it across an hour of great music on this disc ... With some great music on tap, there's no level at which this album does not succeed\". JazzTimes' Bill Bennett observed \"Benny Golson has produced some of the finest compositions in the hard bop tradition, foremost among them his elegy for Brownie, \u201cI Remember Clifford.\u201d Trading on that is surely Golson\u2019s right, even after 40 years-perhaps because after 40 years-we know for a fact that the tune is a certifiable classic\".Bennett, B., JazzTimes Review, accessed March 26, 2019 == Track listing == All compositions by Benny Golson except where noted # \"Brown Immortal\" \u2013 7:23 # \"Five Spot After Dark\" \u2013 7:31 # \"Dear Old Stockholm\" (Traditional) \u2013 8:22 # \"Matinee\" \u2013 5:50 # \"You're the First to Know\" \u2013 6:25 # \"Lullaby of Birdland\" (George Shearing, George David Weiss) \u2013 9:01 # \"Tito Puente\" \u2013 7:23 # \"Horizon Ahead\" \u2013 5:57 # \"Ever More\" \u2013 7:48 == Personnel == *Benny Golson \u2013 tenor saxophone *John Swana \u2013 trumpet *Ron Blake \u2013 tenor saxophone *Mike LeDonne \u2013 piano *Peter Washington - bass *Joe Farnsworth \u2013 drums *Tito Puente, Carlos \"Patato\" Valdes \u2013 percussion (track 7) ===Production=== *Makoto Kimata \u2013 producer *Philip Klum \u2013 engineer == References == Category:Benny Golson albums Category:1998 albums Category:Milestone Records albums Category:Clifford Brown tribute albums ",
