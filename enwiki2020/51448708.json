The poetry in his new book, The Weatherboard Cathedral comes directly from his knowledge of and affection for the land and its people. These positive values give his work warmth that could not be achieved by the simple desire to herald the triumph of the good earth over city sin. In his most characteristic poems, \u2018Troop Train Returning\u2019, \u2018Recourse to the Wilderness\u2019 or \u2018The Wilderness\u2019, for example, journeys inland \u2018beyond the Divide\u2019 or to \u2018the waterless kingdom\u2019 become pilgrimages in search of self and old values.\"\"Recent Australian Poetry\" by Ronald Dunlop, Poetry Australia, February 1970, pp50-57 In his 2010 essay \"Art with It's Largesse and Its Own Restraint : The Sacramental Poetics of Elizabeth Jennings and Les Murray\", included in the critical anthology Between Human and Divine : The Catholic Vision in Contemporary Literature edited by Mary R. Reichardt, Stephen McInerney opined that \"The Weatherboard Cathedral reveals the many-sidedness of Murray's sacramental poetic. As well as depicting a world saturated with God's presence (a dimension of Murray's work that reached its apotheosis in the 1992 collection Translations from the Natural World), it also shows how the sacramental enlarges to embrace the sacrificial aspects of the human and animal kingdoms.\"\"Art with It's Largesse and Its Own Restraint : The Sacramental Poetics of Elizabeth Jennings and Les Murray\" by Stephen McInerney, 2010 ==See also== * 1969 in Australian literature * 1969 in poetry ==References== Category:Australian poetry collections Category:1969 books Category:Angus & Robertson books ",
