    "text": "Katy Simpson Smith (born 1985) is an American novelist. She attended public schools in her hometown of Jackson, Mississippi, before earning a B.A. in History and Film Studies from Mt. Holyoke College in Massachusetts. After receiving a Ph.D. in History from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, she went to Bennington College Writing Seminars for her M.F.A. in Creative Writing. She currently lives in New Orleans. Smith's first book, We Have Raised All of You: Motherhood in the South, 1750-1835, a cross-cultural study of motherhood among Southern whites, Indians, and African-Americans in Virginia and the Carolinas, was published in 2013 by Louisiana State University Press. According to the Journal of American History, \"Smith has made a valuable contribution to gender and southern studies by effectively complicating and humanizing the concept of motherhood. ... Her text will join the ranks of the few others that tackle this universal and timeless subject.\" Smith's first novel, The Story of Land and Sea (HarperCollins, 2014) is set in Beaufort, North Carolina, at the end of the American Revolution. The New York Times wrote that \"Smith's spare, rhythmic prose captivates,\" and according to The Philadelphia Inquirer, \"Smith has written something wondrous and rare in her coruscating debut novel\u2026In quiet, powerful language, The Story of Land and Sea takes us to a South that has been forgotten, blotted out by the stain of war, and breathes life into early history.\" BBC listed it among the \"10 Best New Books to Read,\" and Huffington Post and Vogue Magazine included it as one of their \"Best Books of the Year.\" The Library Journal wrote about her second novel, Free Men (HarperCollins, 2016), \"If [The Story of Land and Sea] could be described as a beautiful murmur, this book is a shout, sharply written and more urgent.\" In his review in The Washington Post, Ron Charles observed, \"With this collage of experiences twisted together and soaked in blood, Smith cuts to the bone of our national character.\" Smith's writing has also appeared in The Oxford American, Granta, Literary Hub, Garden & Gun, and Lenny. She was awarded a MacDowell Colony fellowship for Summer 2019. == Books == * * * == References == ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:American women novelists Category:21st-century American novelists Category:University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill alumni Category:1985 births Category:Writers from New Orleans Category:21st-century American women writers Category:Novelists from Louisiana Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Writers from Jackson, Mississippi Category:Mount Holyoke College alumni Category:Bennington College alumni ",
