The Maul Camera Rocket was demonstrated in 1912 to the Austrian Army and tested as a means for reconnaissance in the Turkish-Bulgarian War in 1912/1913. It was not used afterwards, because aircraft were much more effective. The Maul Camera Rocket had a maximum flight altitude of 1 kilometre (3,300 ft), a launch mass of 42 kg (93 pounds), a diameter of 0.32 metre (12\u00bd inches), a length of 6 metres (19 ft 8 in) and a fin span of 0.35 metres (1 ft 2 in). ==External links== *astronautix.com Category:Experimental rockets Category:Military sensor technology Category:Military intelligence Category:Photography equipment Category:Aerial photography ",
