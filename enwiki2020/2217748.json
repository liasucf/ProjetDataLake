    "text": "Himu or Himalay () is a fictional character created by the Bangladeshi writer Humayun Ahmed who appears in a disjunct series of novels. The character was first appeared in the novel titled Mayurakkhi published in 1990. ==Character== The real name of the character is Himalay, a name given by his father. He follows a lifestyle that was instructed by his psychopathic father who wanted him to be a great man. Himu wears a yellow panjabi that does not have a pocket and lives a mostly nomadic life. He walks barefoot on the streets of Dhaka without certain destination. He does not have a job and, therefore, no source of income. He prefers the life of a beggar than that of a hard worker, often praising begging. However, Himu walks endlessly \u2013 never using any form of transportation. The charterer is decidedly eccentric and unorthodox in outlook. He has a cult following for his spiritual power of predicting future events of anyone, including those of police officer, beggar, neighbor, relatives and tea stall proprietor. Most of the time he indifferently speaks unpleasant truth about the person with whom he talks. Himu unlike Misir Ali, argues that the beliefs make things happen, not inspecting or asking questions. This aspect of him makes him a person who lives by the magical side of the world, not using logic. There are 21 novels about Himu. Five others are Himu-based. ===Novels featuring Himu=== # \u09ae\u09af\u09bc\u09c2\u09b0\u09be\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09c0: # \u09a6\u09b0\u099c\u09be\u09b0 \u0993\u09aa\u09be\u09b6\u09c7: # \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1: # \u09aa\u09be\u09b0\u09be\u09aa\u09be\u09b0: # \u098f\u09ac\u0982 \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1 ...: # \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1\u09b0 \u09b9\u09be\u09a4\u09c7 \u0995\u09af\u09bc\u09c7\u0995\u099f\u09bf \u09a8\u09c0\u09b2\u09aa\u09a6\u09cd\u09ae: # \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1\u09b0 \u09a6\u09cd\u09ac\u09bf\u09a4\u09c0\u09af\u09bc \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09b9\u09b0: # \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1\u09b0 \u09b0\u09c2\u09aa\u09be\u09b2\u09c0 \u09b0\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09bf: # \u098f\u0995\u099c\u09a8 \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1 \u0995\u09af\u09bc\u09c7\u0995\u099f\u09bf \u099d\u09bf\u0981 \u099d\u09bf\u0981 \u09aa\u09cb\u0995\u09be: # \u09a4\u09cb\u09ae\u09be\u09a6\u09c7\u09b0 \u098f\u0987 \u09a8\u0997\u09b0\u09c7: # \u099a\u09b2\u09c7 \u09af\u09be\u09af\u09bc \u09ac\u09b8\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a6\u09bf\u09a8: # \u09b8\u09c7 \u0986\u09b8\u09c7 \u09a7\u09c0\u09b0\u09c7: # \u0986\u0999\u09c1\u09b2 \u0995\u09be\u099f\u09be \u099c\u0997\u09b2\u09c1: # \u09b9\u09b2\u09c1\u09a6 \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1 \u0995\u09be\u09b2\u09cb \u09b0\u200d\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09ac: # \u0986\u099c \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1\u09b0 \u09ac\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09c7: # \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1 \u09b0\u09bf\u09ae\u09be\u09a8\u09cd\u09a1\u09c7: # \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1\u09b0 \u09ae\u09a7\u09cd\u09af\u09a6\u09c1\u09aa\u09c1\u09b0: # \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1\u09b0 \u09a8\u09c0\u09b2 \u099c\u09cb\u099b\u09a8\u09be: # \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1\u09b0 \u0986\u099b\u09c7 \u099c\u09b2: # \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1 \u098f\u09ac\u0982 \u098f\u0995\u099f\u09bf \u09b0\u09be\u09b6\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09a8 \u09aa\u09b0\u09c0: # \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1 \u098f\u09ac\u0982 \u09b9\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09ad\u09be\u09b0\u09cd\u09a1 Ph.D. \u09ac\u09b2\u09cd\u099f\u09c1\u09ad\u09be\u0987: ===Other Himu-related books=== # \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1 \u09ae\u09be\u09ae\u09be: # \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1\u09b0 \u098f\u0995\u09be\u09a8\u09cd\u09a4 \u09b8\u09be\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09be\u09ce\u0995\u09be\u09b0 \u0993 \u0985\u09a8\u09cd\u09af\u09be\u09a8\u09cd\u09af: # \u09b9\u09bf\u09ae\u09c1\u09b0 \u09ac\u09be\u09ac\u09be\u09b0 \u0995\u09a5\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u09b2\u09be: # \u09ae\u09af\u09bc\u09c2\u09b0\u09be\u0995\u09cd\u09b7\u09c0\u09b0 \u09a4\u09c0\u09b0\u09c7: # \u0986\u099c \u09b0\u09ac\u09bf\u09ac\u09be\u09b0: Aaj Robibar (Today's Sunday) ==Films and Dramas Featuring Himu== *Aaj Robibar (1996) *Himu (1994)https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6605934/ ==See also== * Misir Ali, Bengali character created by Humayun Ahmed * Shuvro, Bengali character created by Humayun Ahmed * Baker Bhai, Bengali character created by Humayun Ahmed * Tara Tin Jon, Bengali characters created by Humayun Ahmed appearing in a series of dramas, portrayed by Dr.Ezazul Islam, Faruque Ahmed and Shadhin Khosru. * Alauddiner Cherager Doitto, Bengali character created by Humayun Ahmed appearing in a series of dramas, portrayed by Jayanta Chattopadhyay. == References == Category:Fictional Bengali people Category:Fictional Bangladeshi people ",
