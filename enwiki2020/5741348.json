Then in 1869, Dutch traders imported some specimens into Europe. It is now also introduced to Australia and the United States. It has a long history of cultivation in Japan for practical rather than decorative reasons. The leaves are used to make tea while the seeds or nuts are used to make tea seed oil,Camellia sasanqua in BoDD - Botanical Dermatology Database which is used for lighting, lubrication, cooking and cosmetic purposes. Tea oil has a higher calorific content than any other edible oil available naturally in Japan. Camellia sasanqua is valued in gardens for its handsome glossy green foliage, and fragrant single flowers that can range in color from white to deep pink and are produced extremely early in the season. Various cultivars have been selected, of which 'Crimson King', 'Hugh Evans' and 'Jean May' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. ==See also== * List of Award of Garden Merit camellias ==Citations and references== ;Citations ;References *Bretschneider, E.
