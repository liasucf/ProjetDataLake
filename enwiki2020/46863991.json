Belgian cycling legend Eddy Merckx won ahead of Italians Felice Gimondi and Marino Basso, winning his first of two in the Flemish classic.Vanwalleghem, Rik (1991), De Ronde van Vlaanderen, Pinguin, Belgium, , p150 The race started in Ghent and finished in Gentbrugge. ==Course== Eddy Merckx won practically every major cycling event in 1969, including the Tour of Flanders. The race was run in abysmal weather conditions. Before the first climb of the day a group of 22 riders containing all the favourites was in the front. In Vollezele, not far after Geraardsbergen and despite strong headwind, Merckx attacked solo with 73 kilometers to go. His team manager Lomme Driessens heavily objected, thinking it was too soon and telling him to stop his effort, but Merckx powered on towards the finish. He arrived in Gentbrugge with a 5' 36\" lead over runner-up Felice Gimondi, the biggest margin in the history of the Tour of Flanders. Marino Basso, leading the pack, finished third at eight minutes.Vanwalleghem, Rik (1991), De Ronde van Vlaanderen, Pinguin, Belgium, , p159-161 ==Climbs== There were four categorized climbs: * Kwaremont * Kloosterstraat (Geraardsbergen) * Valkenberg (Brakel) * Kasteeldreef (Brakel) ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccccff;\" ! !Cyclist !Team !Time |- |1 | | | align=right| 6h 20' |- |2 | | Salvarani | align=right| + 5'36\" |- |3 | | Molteni | align=right| + 8'08\" |- |4 | | Filotex | align=right| s.t. |- |5 | | | align=right| s.t. |- |6 | | Molteni | align=right| s.t. |- |7 | | Mercier-BP- Hutchinson | align=right| s.t. |- |8 | | Okay-Diamant | align=right| s.t. |- |9 | | Goldor-Hertekamp | align=right| s.t. |- |10 | | | align=right| s.t. |} ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Tour of Flanders Tour of Flanders Tour of Flanders Category:1969 Super Prestige Pernod ",
