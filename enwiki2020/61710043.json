    "text": "Starbucks Reserve is a program by the international coffeehouse chain Starbucks. The program involves operation of worldwide roasteries; currently six are in operation. Also part of the program are 43 coffee bars preparing Starbucks Reserve products, what Starbucks considers its rarest and best- quality coffees, usually single-origin coffees. Starbucks' headquarters, the Starbucks Center in Seattle, also includes a Reserve Store, a marketplace and bar selling Reserve products. Some Starbucks Reserve coffee is also sold in about 1,500 of the chain's traditional outlets. == History == The program began as Starbucks desired to compete in the high-end coffee market, competing against premium coffee retailers like Stumptown Coffee Roasters, Dillanos Coffee Roasters and Blue Bottle Coffee. Starbucks began its Starbucks Reserve program in 2010 through online sales and a small number of its retail locations, selling small-batch arabica coffees. Later, the company opened its first Reserve location, a three-story store in Latin America, solely selling Colombian coffee. The first Starbucks Reserve roastery opened in December 2014 in Seattle.https://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-starbucks-reserve- roastery-tasting-room-20140904-story.html == Types == A Starbucks Reserve Bar in Vancouver Starbucks Reserve includes three different types of locations: the \"Starbucks Reserve Roastery\", the \"Reserve Bar\", and the \"Reserve Store\". The roasteries, usually tens of thousands of square feet, are often described as a theme park experience, including coffee bars with tastings, cocktail bars, areas to observe the roasting and brewing processes, areas to purchase food, and local artwork throughout. The facilities also roast, package, and ship coffee to stores in their regions.https://www.foodandwine.com/news/starbucks-roastery-reserve-bar-store- difference The company operates roasteries in Seattle, Washington (opened 2014), Shanghai (2017), Milan (2018), New York City (2018), Tokyo (2019), and Chicago, Illinois (2019). The chain ultimately aims to operate 20 to 30 roasteries worldwide. Reserve Bars are traditional Starbucks locations that sell some Starbucks Reserve products, supplied by a regional roastery. There are 43 locations, all of which include the regular Starbucks menu, and also have a coffee bar for a similar experience to the coffee bars in the roasteries. Only one Reserve Store currently exists, in Seattle, on the first floor of the company's headquarters, the Starbucks Center. The store has a cocktail bar and marketplace, and sells similar coffee beverages to the Reserve bars and roasteries. ==Roasteries== ===Seattle=== Seattle roastery building The first Starbucks Reserve roastery opened in December 2014 in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle.https://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-starbucks-reserve- roastery-tasting-room-20140904-story.html It has and is rumored to have cost about $20 million. The roastery includes a split-flap display, a departure board style common in 20th century railway stations. The board was created by Solari di Udine and displays the coffees being roasted. ===Shanghai=== Shanghai roastery The roastery in Shanghai, China, is located in the HKRI Taikoo Hui mixed-use development, on the luxury shopping strip Nanjing Road. It opened in December 2017, and is currently the largest Starbucks location in the world (since surpassed by the Chicago roastery). The Shanghai roastery has between two stories. It is typically fully packed with customers, with lines out the door typical in peak times. The Shanghai roastery has a roasting facility, three coffee bars, a Teavana tea bar, and an augmented reality feature designed by Alibaba: information about coffees and the roasting process viewable by opening the company's Taobao app and pointing it in different places. The store also includes a marketplace, a wine and beer tasting area, a bar for scooping bags of beans to purchase, and places to sample different coffees throughout the store. Similar to other roasteries, a two-story bronze cask sits at the center of the store. The cask is decorated with 1,000 traditional Chinese stamps, hand-engraved, telling stories of the company and coffee. The cask weighs 40 tons, and holds beans roasted in the facility, which are periodically dispersed through pipes around the facility for use. One of the roastery's coffee bars is long, the longest Starbucks coffee bar in existence. Similar to Seattle, the building also features an old-fashioned split-flap display board, showing which varieties are being roasted, and information about their flavors and origin. Many of the roastery's beans were grown in China's Yunnan province. The roastery also includes a Princi location, selling pizzas and focaccia. A coffee library includes books on the history of coffee, brewing methods, coffee art, and the history of Starbucks. The Teavana bar is popular due to China's traditional tea culture; the bar has a wide variety of teas, brewing methods, and tea- based drinks. ===Milan=== Milan roastery The roastery in Milan is located in the , formerly the city's stock exchange and main post office building.

The roastery opened on September 7, 2018, becoming the first of any Starbucks in Italy, and the first and only roastery in Europe. It is the largest Starbucks in Europe, with . The location was chosen as the city of Milan was where Howard Schultz visited in 1983, inspiring him to add espresso drinks to Starbucks, develop caf\u00e9s, and create the coffeehouse chain out of the single original location. The interior was designed considering its location. Most Starbucks locations utilize warm materials like wood, rather than stone surfaces. For the Milan location, an exception was made with the installation of Calacatta marble counters, due to marble's commonplace use in high-end Italian coffee shops. The counters have a radiant heating system to keep them warm. The location has a main bar with seven different coffees, a self-service bean bar, a wood-fired oven bakery, a Princi foodservice area, a retail space, and an \"Arriviamo\" cocktail bar serving coffee-based cocktails and Italian drinks like the Aperol Spritz. The main bar has an affogato station, unique to the Milan location. The affogato ice cream is made to order with liquid nitrogen, served with an espresso shot. The coffee roasted in the building is used in Starbucks locations in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. ===New York City=== The New York location is in Manhattan's neighborhood of Chelsea. It occupies the first floor of 61 Ninth Avenue. The location has , and includes a coffee roastery, two coffee bars, a cocktail bar, bakery, and a terrarium.

The roastery has about , and was designed by Kengo Kuma and built with Japanese cedar. It is the only Reserve Roastery building purpose-built; the other roasteries repurposed existing buildings.

The first floor holds the main coffee bar, while the second floor holds a Teavana tea bar offering 18 different teas and tea- based beverages. The third-floor cocktail bar, branded a \"Arriviamo Bar\", has coffee- and tea-infused cocktails, Japanese versions of classic cocktails, and nonalcoholic cocktails. The fourth floor has the \"Amu Inspiration Lounge\", an event space planned to be certified as a training location by the Specialty Coffee Association of Japan. Central to the space is a 56-foot-tall copper cask, made of 121 copper plates hand-hammered in the Japanese tsuchime technique. The cask holds roasted coffee beans, allowing them to settle and gas to escape before brewing or packaging. Around the cask are 2,100 copper cherry blossoms suspended from the ceiling, an homage to the nearby Meguro River, popular for its numerous blossoming cherry trees. Extending from the cask are copper pipes that deliver coffee beans across different areas of the store. The facility has two roasters, a 118-kilogram Probat G-120 and a 16-kilogram Probat P25 roaster, able to roast up to of coffee each day.

Inside the building are eight copper tubes that transport coffee beans from floor to floor. Each floor has a theme and variety of delicacies. The first floor is the main floor for customers to grab coffee and treats to go, as well as souvenirs and merchandise. The second floor includes a Princi location selling pastries, fresh croissants, cannoli, cheesecakes, and other sweet tarts. Other foods like pastas and pizzas can also be found on the same floor. The third floor consists of barrels filled with Guatemalan cold brew and other rare coffees. The roastery's cocktail bar is on the fourth floor; it serves both classic and modern drinks. The fifth floor, the roof terrace, is currently unavailable until warmer seasons. == Reception == As one Starbucks Yelp reviewer noted, the Starbucks Reserve is described as \"Starbucks on crack\". Locations provide a feel of an \"art studio\" more so than a cafe, as the walls are laced with collections of art work. Menu items are generally more expensive than regular locations. At the same time, the reserve locations provide environments different than that of regular locations. == References == == External links == * Category:Starbucks Category:Tourist attractions in Manhattan Category:Tourist attractions in Seattle Category:Tourist attractions in Shanghai Category:Tourist attractions in Milan Category:Tourist attractions in Tokyo ",
