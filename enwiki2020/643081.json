They are currently members of the and play their home matches at Hithercroft stadium. ==History== The club was founded in 1995 as the result of a merger of two local teams: the original Wallingford Town, a Hellenic League side at the time, founded in 1922, and neighbours Wallingford United, who had been founded in 1934. The newly merged club was named AFC Wallingford. In 1997\u201398, the club became champions of the Chiltonian League, and gained promotion into the Combined Counties League. In 2001\u201302, AFC Wallingford won the Combined Counties League championship comfortably, and then were runners-up to Withdean 2000 and AFC Wimbledon in the succeeding two years. However, the facilities at their ground, Hithercroft, did not meet the standards of the Isthmian League and thus they were denied further promotion. A Football Association grant of \u00a3100,000 was used to fund ground improvements which would make promotion possible if they were to again win the Combined Counties League. However, after disruption caused by heavy player turnover (with several leaving for Didcot Town, who then won the FA Vase), the 2004\u201305 season saw AFC Wallingford unable to avoid last place and relegation. The 2005\u201306 season saw an upturn in fortunes for the club, with a runners-up finish in the Combined Counties League Division One, which resulted in a promotion and with it a switch to the Hellenic League Premier Division, a league deemed better suited to AFC Wallingford's geographical location in Oxfordshire. In 2011, Wallingford set up its first junior teams. In 2013, the club's name was formally changed to Wallingford Town. ==Stadium== Wallingford Town play their home games at Hithercroft, Wallingford Sports Park, Hithercroft Road, Wallingford, Oxfordshire, OX10 9RB. ==Honours== *Berks & Bucks Senior Trophy: Runners-up 2000-01 *North Berks Charity Shield: Winners 2014-15 *North Berks Charity Shield: Runners-up 2012-13 ==Records== * Best league position: 1st in Combined Counties League (then level 9), 1998\u201399 * Best FA Cup performance: 2nd qualifying round in 2000\u201301, 2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304 * Best FA Vase performance: 3rd round in 2001\u201302 ==Sources== * ==References== ==External links== *Official site with Forum *Official site Category:Association football clubs established in 1995 Category:Football clubs in Oxfordshire Category:1995 establishments in England Category:Wallingford, Oxfordshire Category:Football clubs in England Category:Chiltonian League Category:Combined Counties Football League Category:Hellenic Football League Category:North Berks Football League ",
