It is the eighth-busiest airport in Poland and currently the smallest European airport which has a direct scheduled transatlantic connection, with LOT Polish Airlines' seasonal service to Newark. ==History== The passenger domestic services to the Rzesz\u00f3w Airport were started on 30.11.1945 with the opening of the circular domestic airline number 1/2 Warszawa \u2013 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a \u2013Krak\u00f3w \u2013 Rzesz\u00f3w \u2013 Lublin \u2013 Warszawa. The airport was re-built and opened for commercial traffic in 1949 after the first facilities which were built in 1940 were destroyed in 1944. On 2 June 2007 LOT Polish Airlines commenced seasonal services to New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark's Newark Liberty International Airport, service to JFK has since ceased operations. As of January 2008, the airport has had scheduled international flights to Dublin and London\u2013Stansted, in addition to its domestic connection with Warsaw. It has also become a preferred arrival point for Jews on pilgrimage to the tomb of Rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk in Le\u017cajsk usually in March. In 2009\u201310, it registered 18.66% increase in passenger traffic serving 451,720 passengers in 2010. Coupled with the September 2006 start of the construction on a new passenger terminal, this means that the airport is undergoing a rapid expansion, albeit in fits and starts, owing to delays in setting up the management company and obtaining financing and routes. The new passenger terminal opened in May 2012. Rzesz\u00f3w Airport has been cited as an airport with below-forecast passenger numbers and an inefficient usage of EU subsidies. Rzeszow Jasionka Airport, however, was underpassing an ECA (European Court of Auditors) audit in 2014 and - among 20 other European airports - its marks were positive in terms of efficiency and legitimacy using EU funds on Airports' modernization. ==Facilities== Rzesz\u00f3w\u2013Jasionka Airport, situated north of Rzesz\u00f3w, features the third-longest runway in Poland: . ==Airlines and destinations== ==Statistics== Apron view Terminal interior {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\" |+ Traffic by calendar year |- ! !
