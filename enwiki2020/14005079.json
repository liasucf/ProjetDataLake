    "text": "Galloon trim on the cuffs and chest of a c. 1908 Russian court uniform. Galloon is a decorative woven trim sometimes in the form of a braid and commonly made of metallic gold or silver thread, lace, or embroidery. Galloon is used in the trim of military and police uniforms, ecclesiastical dress, and as trim on textiles, drapery, and upholstery. The distinction between galloon, ribbon, and belting has not always been clear, and a great deal of overlap has occasionally caused problems in classification. == References == * Abbott, James Archer.
