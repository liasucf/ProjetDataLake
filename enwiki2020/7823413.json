    "text": "John MacLeod (born 14 May 1948 in Fearn, Scotland), known in Scottish Gaelic as Iain MacLe\u00f2id, was educated at the University of Aberdeen and the Free Church College, Edinburgh, and is a minister of the Free Church of Scotland (Continuing) who has served in congregations of the Free Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland (Continuing) in Scotland and North America. He came to prominence in connection with allegations against Donald Macleod, Professor of Systematic Theology at the Free Church College: the professor was answerable to the Training of the Ministry Committee, of which Rev. John MacLeod was clerk. This led, in January 2000, to an attempt to suspend him and over twenty other ministers from the functions of the ministry and to their formation of the \"Free Church of Scotland Continuing\", of which John MacLeod was subsequently appointed the Principal Clerk of Assembly. He was moderator of the 2006 FCC General Assembly. ==Footnotes== == References == * Who's Who in Scotland (Carrick) ==External links== *Website of the Free Church Continuing Category:Scottish Christian clergy Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Aberdeen ",
