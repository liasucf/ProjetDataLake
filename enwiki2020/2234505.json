    "text": "Finan of Lindisfarne (died 10 or 17 February 661), also known as Saint Finan, was an Irish monk, trained at Iona Abbey in Scotland, who became the second Bishop of Lindisfarne from 651 until 661. ==Life== Finan was appointed to Lindisfarne in 651. Originally from Ireland, he built on Lindisfarne, a cathedral \"in the Irish fashion\", employing hewn oak, with a thatched roof, dedicated to St. Peter. He also founded St. Mary's at the mouth of the River Tyne.Grattan-Flood, William. \"St. Finan.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 12 May 2013 He converted the kings Sigebert of Essex and Peada of the Middle Angles to Christianity.Kirby Earliest English Kings pp. 79\u201380 Bede is the main source for Finan's life.Walsh New Dictionary of Saints p. 203 He is specially noted by Bede as having borne an important part in the conversion of the northern Saxons.Webb, Alfred. A Compendium of Irish Biography, M. H. Gill & Son, Dublin, 1878 The breviary of Aberdeen styles him \"a man of venerable life, a bishop of great sanctity, an eloquent teacher ... remarkable for his training in virtue and his liberal education, surpassing all his equals in every manner of knowledge as well as in circumspection and prudence, but chiefly devoting himself to good works and presenting in his life, a most apt example of virtue\". Finan ordained St. Cedd bishop of the East-Saxons, having called two other bishops to assist at his consecration. The Abbey of Whitby, his chief foundation, was the scene of the famous Paschal controversy, which resulted in the withdrawal of the Irish monks from Lindisfarne. Finan was active for some time at a monastery on Church Island on Lough Currane in County Kerry; today it is known as St. Finan's Church. To the south of the lake is Inis Uasal (Noble Island), an island which is dedicated to him. Finan died in 661,Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 219 and was buried at Lindisfarne, having held that see ten years. ==Veneration== Finan's feast day is celebrated upon 9 January. ==Citations== ==References== * * * Walsh, Michael A New Dictionary of Saints: East and West London: Burns & Oats 2007 == External links == * * Ecclesiastical History of the English People, Book 1, L.C.
