The 2019\u201320 season was the sixth with Guinness as the title sponsor, the eleventh with a grand final and the third season with 14 teams, following the admission of two South African teams. The match was planned to be held at Cardiff City Stadium, however, on 19 March 2020, Celtic Rugby DAC cancelled the event due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The re-arranged match took place on 12 September 2020 at the Aviva Stadium between defending champions Leinster and Ulster. Leinster won the match 27\u20135 to defend their title and complete a hat- trick of title wins. ==Route to the final== The top two sides from each of the two conferences met in the semi-finals, with the higher placed team having home advantage. Teams placed second and third in opposite conferences would have met in the two quarter-finals, but this was scrapped this year. The play- offs took place immediately following the final round of derby fixtures. ===Semi-finals=== ==Pre-match== The match was televised free-to-air by TG4 in the Republic of Ireland, and on BBC in Northern Ireland. It was also shown on Eir Sport. ==Final== ===Summary=== ===Details=== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| style=\"width:100%;\" |- |style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%\"| {| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |FB ||15|| Jordan Larmour |- |RW ||14|| Hugo Keenan |- |OC ||13|| Garry Ringrose (c) || |- |IC ||12|| Robbie Henshaw |- |LW ||11|| James Lowe |- |FH ||10|| Ross Byrne || |- |SH ||9 || Jamison Gibson-Park || |- |N8 ||8 || Jack Conan |- |OF ||7 || Josh van der Flier || |- |BF ||6 || Caelan Doris |- |RL ||5 || James Ryan || |- |LL ||4 || Devin Toner |- |TP ||3 || Andrew Porter || |- |HK ||2 || R\u00f3nan Kelleher || |- |LP ||1 || Cian Healy || |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- |HK ||16|| James Tracy || |- |PR ||17|| Ed Byrne || |- |PR ||18|| Michael Bent || |- |LK ||19|| Scott Fardy || |- |FL ||20|| Will Connors || |- |SH ||21|| Luke McGrath || |- |FH ||22|| Jonathan Sexton || |- |CE ||23|| Rory O'Loughlin || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Leo Cullen |- |} |valign=\"top\"| |style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%\"| {| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |FB ||15|| Michael Lowry |- |RW ||14|| Rob Lyttle |- |OC ||13|| James Hume |- |IC ||12|| Stuart McCloskey |- |LW ||11|| Jacob Stockdale |- |FH ||10|| Billy Burns || |- |SH ||9 || Alby Mathewson || |- |N8 ||8 || Marcell Coetzee || |- |OF ||7 || Sean Reidy |- |BF ||6 || Matty Rea || |- |RL ||5 || Iain Henderson (c) || |- |LL ||4 || Alan O'Connor |- |TP ||3 || Tom O'Toole || |- |HK ||2 || Rob Herring || || || |- |LP ||1 || Eric O'Sullivan || |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- |HK ||16|| John Andrew || || || |- |PR ||17|| Jack McGrath || |- |PR ||18|| Marty Moore || |- |LK ||19|| Sam Carter || |- |BR ||20|| Jordi Murphy || |- |SH ||21|| John Cooney || |- |FH ||22|| Ian Madigan || |- |BR ||23|| Nick Timoney || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Dan McFarland |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | Man of the Match: Josh van der Flier Assistant referees: George Clancy (IRFU) Frank Murphy (IRFU) Television match official: Brian MacNiece (IRFU) |} ==Notes== ==References== 2020 Category:2019\u201320 Pro14 Pro14 Grand Final Category:Leinster Rugby matches Category:Ulster Rugby matches ",
