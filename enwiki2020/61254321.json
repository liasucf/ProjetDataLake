Its office is based in St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.. ==Profile== The organization was formed in 1956 when the Council of American Bioanalysts (CAB) merged with the National Association of Clinical Laboratories (NACL) The AAB serves as an umbrella organization for the American Board of Bioanalysis,https://www.aab.org/aab/American_Board_of_Bioanalysis.asp AAB Board of Registryhttps://www.aab.org/aab/AAB_Board_of_Registry.asp ABOR AAB Associate Member Section,https://www.aab.org/aab/AAB_Associate_Members_Section.asp College of Reproductive Biologyhttps://www.aab.org/aab/CRB1.asp Environmental Biology and Public Health Sectionhttps://www.aab.org/aab/Environmental_Biology_and_Public_Health.asp and National Independent Laboratory Association.https://www.nila- usa.org/nila/default.asp ==Role as a national certifying agency== The American Board of Bioanalysis, is a national certifying agency in the United States of America, for clinical laboratory directors and supervisors. The AAB Board of Registry is a national certifying agency in the United States of America for medical technologist and medical laboratory technicians. Those certified either meet or exceed the minimum requirements for testing personnel under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. ==Role as a trade association== The National Independent Laboratory Association (NILA) functions as a trade association for community, regional, and health systems clinical laboratories.Article in \"The National Independent Laboratory Association\" NILA has a long history of defending the clinical laboratory industry from legislation that would be detrimental and costly to both the clinical laboratory and patients in the United State. One of their first victories prevented the reinstatement of the 20% copayment on Part B Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) payments.Article in \"Breaking NILA News\" The organization is currently playing a role in preventing PAMA's proposed fee cuts Article in \"Dark Daily\" ==State Licensure== The AAB officially supports state licensure for clinical laboratory personnel, but opposes laws it considers excessively restrictive. In 2014, the AAB clarified its licensure position in a response to Minnesota's H.F. 203 bill. AAB opposed the bill on the basis that it would create a hardship for United States trained military personnel to obtain a license, lead to creating loopholes where new standards would apply to only some of Minnesota's laboratories, and encouragedifferent wages based on education instead of work performed. The bill was successfully defeated allowing United States trained military personnel to continue working without additional education and training requirements. == References == ==External links== *American Association of Bioanalysts *AAB Associate Member Section *American Board of Bioanalysis *College of Reproductive Biology *Environmental Biology and Public Health Section *National Independent Laboratory Association Category:Health care-related professional associations based in the United States Category:Scientific organizations established in 1956 Category:1956 establishments in the United States Category:Organizations based in St. Louis ",
