    "text": "The Daniel Webster School, also known as Escuela Daniel Webster and as La Webster, in Pe\u00f1uelas Pueblo, Pe\u00f1uelas, Puerto Rico, was built in 1927 and expanded in 1934. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. It was deemed significant for its architecture. It was asserted in its NRHP nomination that \"Escuela Webster exemplifies the joint adoption (if not always academically accurate) of Beaux Arts and Spanish Revival styles as a legitimate architectural idiom.\" It is a two-story reinforced concrete building with an H-shaped plan. It was designed by Francisco Gard\u00f3n Vega, as indicated in construction documents, although Rafael Carmoega, then Chief Architect for the Division of Public Works of Puerto Rico's Department of the Interior Office, is the architect of record per a plaque in the building. It was built by contractor Gabino Balasquide. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Puerto Rico Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in Puerto Rico Category:Spanish Revival architecture in Puerto Rico Category:School buildings completed in 1939 ",
