It forms part of the ancient ruins in Uzgen along with three well preserved mausoleums located nearby. Uzgen Minaret is a 27.5 metre (90 feet) tall tapering tower, with an 8.5 metre (28 feet) base diameter, reducing to 6.2 metres (20 feet) at the top. Built with bricks, the Uzgen minaret's architecture consist of three distinctive parts. It has a 5 metres (16.5 feet) high octahedron shaped lower part and a tapering cylindrical middle part, similar to the Burana Tower in northern Kyrgyzstan. The upper part with arched windows and a cupola is a relatively recent addition, built in 1923 to 1924. ==Gallery== File:\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0423\u0437\u0433\u0435\u043d.jpg File:Karakhanid mausoleum Uzgen.jpg| Karakhanid mausoleum nearby minaret.
