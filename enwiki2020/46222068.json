    "text": "The Popular Liberation Front (, or FPL) was a reformist Guatemalan political party formed in 1944 largely patronized by the middle class and university students. It was a part of the popular movement that overthrew dictator Jorge Ubico and began the Guatemalan Revolution. During this period, it was one of the two largest Guatemalan parties, the other being the National Renovation Party (PRN) led by teachers. In Guatemala's first democratic elections in 1944, it joined a broad coalition of revolutionary parties to support the election bid of Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo, but subsequently distanced itself from his government. In November 1945, it merged with the National Renovation Party to form the Revolutionary Action Party (PAR), but split from it eighteen months later. This split was partially the result of ideological differences, and partially the result of manipulations by Ar\u00e9valo, who preferred to deal with a fractured opposition. During the period that it was a part of the PAR, as well as in alliance with the PRN, it enjoyed a majority in the Guatemalan Congress for the entire presidential term of Juan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo, and until 1949, it was the largest of the parties involved in the Guatemalan Revolution. The FPL was also the most conservative of the revolutionary parties, until 1949. In that year the party split between those who supported the presidential candidacy of Francisco Javier Arana, and those who opposed him. Arana's supporters left to form the \"FPL Ortodoxo,\" or the Orthodox FPL. In the 1950 election, the remainder of the FPL formally endorsed V\u00edctor Manuel Giordani, but some party members defected to support Jorge Garc\u00eda Granados, another moderate civilian, while still others supported Jacobo \u00c1rbenz, the defence minister and the administration's candidate. This infighting furthered the decline of the FPL. ==Notes and references== ;References ;Sources * * Category:1944 establishments in Guatemala Category:Agrarian parties Category:Guatemalan Revolution Category:Defunct political parties in Guatemala Category:Political parties established in 1944 Category:Political parties with year of disestablishment missing Category:Social democratic parties ",
