Though this text was originally attributed to Bodhidharma, a great deal of material was added to it, probably around the 8th century, by the monks or perhaps other anonymous groups. The work, along with T'an Lun's biography of Bodhidharma and other newly discovered manuscripts, was recompiled by a renowned Japanese Zen practitioner, Daisetsu Teitaro Suzuki, in 1935. ==Teachings== The two entrances referred to in the title are the entrance of principle (\u7406\u5165 l\u01d0r\u00f9) and the entrance of practice (\u884c\u5165 x\u00edngr\u00f9). * \"Entrance of principle\" refers to seeing through the obscurations of our daily mind and manifesting our true nature, that is, Buddha nature; it is referred to in one short passage: * \"Entrance of practice\" deals with practicing a \"detached perspective on the varying circumstances of one's own life,\" through different daily practices. In the section on the latter, the four practices are listed as being at the core of Bodhidharma's teaching. These are: ** Practice of the retribution of enmity: to accept all suffering as the fruition of past transgressions, without enmity or complaint. **Practice of the acceptance of circumstances: to remain unmoved even by good fortune, recognizing it as evanescent. **Practice of the absence of craving: to be without craving, which is the source of all suffering. **Practice of accordance with the Dharma: to eradicate wrong thoughts and practice the six perfections, without having any \u201cpractice\u201d According to John R. Mcrae, \"the \u201centrance of principle\u201d refers to interior cultivation, mental practice undertaken deep within the individual's psyche, and the \u201centrance of practice\u201d refers to practice undertaken actively and in interaction with the world.\" Yet, McRae also notes that it's not clear what exactly the \"entrance of principle\" entailed. The phrase \"wall contemplation,\" biguan, is not explicated. Later tradition graphically depicted it as practicing dhyana while facing a wall, but it may be a metaphor, referring to the four walls of a room which prevent the winds from entering the room. ==Structure== The format of the text is that of a collection of the master's teaching as collected by his students. There are two entrances listed, one abstract and one concrete. In other words, the text list two different ways of achieving enlightenment, one based on inward reflection (the entrance of principle) and one based on outward action (the entrance of practice). The bimodal structure of this treatise was frequently copied and became typical in early Chan Buddhism. ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * ==Further reading== * Dumoulin, Heinrich Early Chinese Zen Reexamined (pdf) *McRae, John R., The Antecedents of Encounter Dialogue in Chinese Ch'an Buddhism ==External links== *The Earliest Teachings of Ch\u2019an.
