    "text": "Lottia persona is a species of sea snail, a true limpet, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Lottiidae, one of the families of true limpets. ==Description== L. persona is a large, moderately tall limpet growing to up to fifty millimetres long. The apex is not central, being about one third of the way along the shell which is dark olive-green with fine white markings and has fine radial ribs, though these have often been smoothed down by erosion. The anterior slope is straight or slightly concave. ==Distribution== L. persona is found on the North American Pacific coast from Alaska to central California. It is a cryptic species, common to the high and mid-intertidal zones in sheltered rocky coasts. It is mostly found in crevices and caves and under overhangs. It is nocturnal, grazing on micro-algae when the rocks are wet. ==References== Category:Lottiidae Category:Molluscs of the Pacific Ocean Category:Taxa named by Martin Rathke Category:Gastropods described in 1833 ",
