    "text": "The 1918 Auckland Rugby League season was its 10th since its inception in 1909. It was again severely affected by the ongoing war with several hundred players serving overseas and 44 killed who were named in the annual report. North Shore Albions withdrew from the competition early in the season and on other occasions teams played short-handed. There was also a truncated representative program with only a trial match and one full Auckland representative match versus Canterbury, which was played at the Auckland Domain in front of 10,000 spectators. The senior grade featured six teams. Ponsonby United won their second consecutive title with an 8-win\u20131-loss record. Ponsonby then traveled to Christchurch to play Sydenham for the Thacker Shield and they won 11 points to 0. City Rovers won their second Roope Rooster title with a 6\u20133 win over Maritime following their first win in 1916. Senior games still regularly attracted strong crowds. The round 4 matches at Victoria Park drew an estimated crowd of 6,000. While 4,000 attended the round 5 matches, 5,000 the round 7 clash between City Rovers and Grafton Athletic at the same venue, and 6,000 witnessed the round 9 match between City Rovers and Ponsonby United. At the season end many one off matches were played between various teams. One of the more notable ones was a match between the Auckland Star staff and The New Zealand Herald staff. The game was won by the Auckland Star by 8 points to 4. These company type fixtures were to become a regular feature of Auckland Rugby League for decades to come. == Maritime, Mangere, and Big Store football clubs form == The Maritime club applied to join the Auckland Rugby League with the nomination of a senior team. This was accepted by the league. They finished the season with a 1 win, 7 loss record. The Mangere club applied for affiliation and the registration of 23 players at the Auckland Rugby League meeting on 17 April. This was granted by the league. They were to play in maroon and gold originally as requested but before the season started asked to wear blue instead. The Big Store Football Club nominated a team to play in the league which was accepted and their colours of blue and white were approved. == New league rooms == At the conclusion of the season the league opened their own league rooms on Swanson Street. The rooms were used for the first time with the Auckland Rugby League executive meeting on 23 October. The rooms consisted of \"a large billiard room and League office, and a room for clubs to hold their weekly meetings in\". It was stated that players did not formerly meet \"their fellow players during the summer time, but with this club now on a sound footing they will be able to meet each other and spend enjoyable evenings which should bring about a better feeling between the different teams\". == Representative match == Auckland played a representative match for the first time in a few seasons. They had taken a hiatus during the war years but they played a trial match between and A and B team before a match with Canterbury at the Auckland Domain. The match attracted an enormous crowd of 10,000 and Auckland won easily by 45 points to 9. ==First grade championship== The season began with 2 preliminary rounds before the competitions began proper on 18 May. Around 5,000 spectators attended the first round matches at Victoria Park and Devonport Domain. North Shore Albions played the preliminary rounds, round 1, and defaulted their next two matches before withdrawing from the competition. ===Teams=== The competition featured 6 teams. *City Rovers (red and black) *Grafton Athletic (black and white) *Maritime (white) *Newton Rangers (red and white) *North Shore Albions (green and white) *Ponsonby United (blue and black) ===Final standings=== {| |- | {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !width=175 |Team !width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld !width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W !width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D !width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L !width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F !width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A !width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Ponsonby United |9||8||0||1||103||53||16 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Newton Rangers |9||7||0||2||123||37||14 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|City Rovers |8||5||0||3||73||85||10 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Grafton Athletic |8||2||0||6||94||125||4 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Maritime |8||1||0||8||45||110||2 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|North Shore Albions |3||0||0||3||2||30||0 |- |} Ponsonby and Maritime both had default wins over North Shore Albions. Newton had a default win over Maritime (R9). These results are included in the standings. ===Preliminary Round 1=== North Shore was struggling to field a team owing to the impact of the war on their playing numbers. They only managed 11 players for their match with Maritime who were also fielding a weakened forward pack. ===Preliminary Round 2=== North Shore defaulted their match with Grafton. Ponsonby achieved a milestone of sorts becoming the first club to reach 1,000 first grade points during their match with Newton.

It had taken them 72 matches to reach the mark. ===Round 1=== ===Round 2=== North Shore lost by default to Maritime.

While Eric McGregor (brother of Kiwi Dougie McGregor) of Ponsonby United topped the try scoring list with 10.
