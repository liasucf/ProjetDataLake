    "text": "C\u00edcero Jo\u00e3o de C\u00e9zare (born 24 June 1980), nicknamed Cicinho (), is a Brazilian retired professional footballer who played as a right back. He had his breakthrough at S\u00e3o Paulo, where he was named in the 2005 Bola de Prata as the team won the Campeonato Paulista, Copa Libertadores and FIFA Club World Cup. He then spent most of his career with mixed successes at Real Madrid, Roma and Sivasspor. He suffered from alcoholism during his time in Europe. Cicinho earned 15 caps for Brazil, winning the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and going to the 2006 FIFA World Cup. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Born in Prad\u00f3polis, S\u00e3o Paulo, Cicinho began his career at Botafogo-SP before joining Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro, who loaned him to the Rio de Janeiro-based Botafogo. He won the Club World Cup in 2005 while playing for S\u00e3o Paulo. ===Real Madrid=== After an interview with Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, Cicinho signed for Real Madrid on 23 August 2005, effective from the new year. He joined for an undisclosed fee and accompanied compatriots Ronaldo, Robinho, J\u00falio Baptista and Roberto Carlos, under Brazilian manager Vanderlei Luxemburgo. He made his debut in La Liga on 8 January 2006, replacing the injured Ronaldo after 33 minutes in a goalless draw at Villarreal, and three weeks later, he scored his first goal to open a 2\u20131 win at Celta de Vigo. On 14 February, he scored after 57 seconds in a 4\u20130 win over Real Zaragoza in the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey, to no avail due to a 6\u20131 loss in the first round. In September 2006, Cicinho suffered an extensive injury to his ACL and missed over six months. His comeback, to not only the pitch, but also the starting lineup, was on 29 April 2007, against Athletic Bilbao. He assisted Ruud van Nistelrooy's first goal with a cross, and played a part in the Dutchman's second goal in a 4\u20131 win. In preparation for the 2007\u201308 season, Cicinho received less playing time under new coach Bernd Schuster. Michel Salgado and Sergio Ramos were used on the right during most of pre-season, and he therefore requested a transfer to A.S. Roma who had been following him for some time. ===Roma=== On 22 August 2007, Cicinho signed for Roma for a fee up to \u20ac11 million. Cicinho signed a five-year contract with the capital club worth from \u20ac3.6M in the first year up to \u20ac4 million in the last year (in gross salary, i.e. include tax), with additional bonuses. He made his official debut in a Roma jersey on the first matchday of Serie A against Palermo, as a substitute for Ludovic Giuly in the second half. Roma went on to win the game 2\u20130. On 9 February 2010, Cicinho joined S\u00e3o Paulo on loan until on 30 June 2010. This loan came after a 2009\u201310 season in which Cicinho received less playing time under new manager Claudio Ranieri in favor of Marco Cassetti and Marco Motta. On 13 January 2011, he returned to Spain; this time joining Villarreal on loan until the end of the season. In 2011\u201312 season Cicinho returned to Roma. He was the third choice for right back behind Marco Cassetti and Aleandro Rosi. He played only 2 matches in a 2011\u201312 season, first against Siena and second against Fiorentina in which he was a starter. His contract expired on 30 June, and he returned to Brazil. ===Later career=== Cicinho returned to Brazil after six years away on 21 June 2012, signing a one-year contract for Sport as part of president Gustavo Dubeux's promise to bring in a player who would be \"greeted by the fans at the airport\". In July 2013, Cicinho signed with Turkish club Sivasspor, managed by his former club and international defensive partner Roberto Carlos. After one year, Cicinho had become a key player, and, in April 2014, he renewed his contract for two more years. In September 2017, after over a year of unemployment, Cicinho signed with Brasiliense of S\u00e9rie D for the 2018 season. He rescinded his contract on 1 March, after two competitive games for the team from Bras\u00edlia, due to a recurring knee injury. ==International career== Cicinho representing Brazil Cicinho made his debut for Brazil national team on 27 April 2005 in a 3\u20130 win over Guatemala at the Est\u00e1dio do Pacaembu for Rom\u00e1rio's testimonial match, assisting the opening goal by \u00c2nderson. He was called up for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup in Germany, with he and L\u00e9o replacing veteran full-backs Caf\u00fa and Roberto Carlos respectively. He played every match as Brazil won. On 12 November 2005, Cicinho came on as a substitute for Caf\u00fa in a friendly against the United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi and scored his only international goal to cap an 8\u20130 victory. He was one of the 23 players called up by Carlos Alberto Parreira to defend Brazil's crown in the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany. He made his tournament debut in the 4\u20131 group stage win over Japan, assisting one of Ronaldo's goals that made him the tournament's all- time top goalscorer. His one other appearance was in the 1\u20130 loss to France in the quarter-finals, as a late substitute for Caf\u00fa. ==Personal life== In addition to being Brazilian, he is also an Italian citizen, having a grandfather from Tione degli Abruzzi in Abruzzo whose last name was \"De Cesare\", then poorly transcribed as De C\u00e9zare by the registry office. In 2012, Cicinho revealed that he was an alcoholic and smoker, and would have taken drugs were it not for doping tests in football. He told ESPN Brasil in 2016 that he smoked two packs of cigarettes a day. The following year, he confessed in a Fox interview that his addictions became a problem following his move to Real Madrid, and that he got more than 30 tattoos in a struggle to fight his depression. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=3|Cup !colspan=3|Continental !colspan=3|Total |- !Apps !Goals !Assist !Apps !Goals !Assist !Apps !Goals !Assist !Apps !Goals !Assist |- | rowspan=3|Real Madrid |2005\u201306 |19||2||1||4||1||0||1||0||0||24||3||1 |- |2006\u201307 |7||0||3||0||0||0||1||0||0||8||0||3 |- ! colspan=1 | Total ! 26!!2!!4!!4!!1!!0!!2!!0!!0!!32!!3!!4 |- | rowspan=6|Roma |2007\u201308 |30||2||5||7||0||1||7||0||0||44||2||6 |- |2008\u201309 |22||1||0||2||0||0||5||0||1||31||1||1 |- |2009\u201310 |2||0||0||1||0||0||2||0||0||5||0||0 |- |2010\u201311 |6||0||1||1||0||0||2||0||0||9||0||1 |- |2011\u201312 |2||0||0||1||0||0||2||0||0||5||0||0 |- ! colspan=1 | Total ! 62!!3!!6!!12!!0!!1!!18!!0!!1!!91!!3!!8 |- | rowspan=2|S\u00e3o Paulo |2010 |6||0||0||0||0||0||10||0||0||16||0||0 |- ! colspan=1 | Total ! 6!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!10!!0!!0!!16!!0!!0 |- | rowspan=2|Villarreal |2010\u201311 |6||0||0||1||0||0||0||0||0||7||0||0 |- ! colspan=1 | Total ! 6!!0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!7!!0!!0 |- | rowspan=2|Sport Recife |2012 |24||0||7||0||0||0||0||0||0||24||0||7 |- ! colspan=1 | Total ! 24!!0!!7!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!24!!0!!7 |- | rowspan=4|Sivasspor |2013\u201314 |31||1||15||6||1||1||0||0||0||37||2||16 |- |2014\u201315 |30||1||9||3||0||0||0||0||0||33||1||9 |- |2015\u201316 |27||0||5||0||0||0||0||0||0||27||0||5 |- ! colspan=1 | Total !88!!2!!28!!9!!1!!1!!0!!0!!0!!97!!3!!30 |- ! colspan=2 | Career total ! 198!!7!!45!!26!!2!!2!!30!!0!!1!!243!!8!!46 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== ;S\u00e3o Paulo *Campeonato Paulista: 2005 *Copa Libertadores: 2005 *FIFA Club World Cup: 2005 ;Real Madrid *La Liga: 2006\u201307 ;Roma *Coppa Italia: 2007\u201308 ===International=== ;Brazil *FIFA Confederations Cup: 2005 ==References== ==External links== * *Sivasspor profile Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:People from S\u00e3o Paulo (state) Category:2005 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:FIFA Confederations Cup-winning players Category:Brazil international footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Italy Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in Turkey Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Turkey Category:Brazilian people of Italian descent Category:People of Abruzzese descent Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players Category:La Liga players Category:Serie A players Category:S\u00fcper Lig players Category:Botafogo Futebol Clube (SP) players Category:Clube Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro players Category:Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas players Category:S\u00e3o Paulo FC players Category:Real Madrid CF players Category:A.S.
