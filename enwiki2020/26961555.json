UK-414,495 acts as a potent, selective inhibitor of the enzyme neutral endopeptidase, which normally serves to break down the neuropeptide VIP. The consequent increase in VIP activity alters blood flow to the genital region leading to increased lubrication and muscle relaxation. ==See also== * ABT-670 * ABT-724 * Bremelanotide * Cabergoline * Flibanserin * Testosterone (patch) * Melanotan II * Pramipexole * PF-219,061 * S-17092 * Tibolone == References == Category:Hydrolase inhibitors Category:Female sexual dysfunction drugs Category:Thiadiazoles Category:Carboxamides Category:Carboxylic acids Category:Aphrodisiacs Category:Cyclopentanes Category:Pfizer brands ",
