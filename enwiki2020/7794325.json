Contemporary Greek Macedonian cooking shares much with general Greek and wider Balkan and Mediterranean cuisine, including dishes from the Ottoman past. Specific influences include dishes of the Pontic, Aromanian, Slavic, Armenian and Sephardi Jewish population.\u03a5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c8\u03b7\u03c6\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03b6\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 unesco The mix of the different people inhabiting the region gave the name to the Macedonian salad.Dimitar Bechev, Historical Dictionary of North Macedonia, Historical Dictionaries of Europe, Edition 2, Rowman & Littlefield, 2019, , Introduction, p. 1. ==History== Buffalos breeding in Lake Kerkini A continuation from the ancient period are dishes such as lamb cooked with quince or various vegetables and fruits, goat boiled or fried in olive oil: modern recipes from Kavala to Kastoria and Kozani offer lamb with quince, pork with celery or leeks. The arrival of Greek refugees from Asia Minor and Constantinople in the early 20th century brought also Anatolian and Constantinopolitan elements in the cuisine of the region. Some current specialties are trahanas with crackling, phyllo-based pies (cheese, leek, spinach) and meat plates (such as pork, wild boar and buffalo). Favourites are tyrokafteri (Macedonian spicy cheese spread) and soupies krasates (cuttlefishes in wine). Unlike Athens, the traditional pita bread for the popular souvlaki usually is not grilled but fried. (Information included from 'Greek Gastronomy', GNTO, 2004) Various products are produced from the buffalo meat. There is breeding especially around Lake Kerkini. ==Appetizers/local products== A plate with tirokafteri Manouri Florina peppers Anevato creamy cheese * Ajvar (Florina), spicy dip *Krokos Kozanis (saffron) *Melintzanosalata *Kavourmas *Kolokythopita (zucchini pie) *Koulouri Thessalonikis (a type of simit) *Kich\u00ed of Kozani, a type of tyropita with cheese *Mushrooms (large production around Grevena region) *Manitaropita, mushrooms pie *Pinakot\u00ed, bread from Mount Athos *Pastourmas *Skordalia *Tahini *Taramosalata *Various cheeses, like Anevato, Kasseri, Manouri, Batzos, Metsovone, Petroto, Kefalograviera and Tirokafteri, a spicy cheese spread or dip made of whipped feta cheese with hot peppers and olive oil *Tirokroketes *Red peppers of Florina: can be roasted, sliced and served by adding olive oil and garlic , Anonymous (n.d.).
