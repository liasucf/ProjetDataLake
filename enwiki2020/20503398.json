    "text": "Leandro dos Santos Branco (born 2 June 1983 in Lages, Santa Catarina) is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a forward for \u00c1guia Negra. ==Football career== After spending most of his career with modest clubs in his country, Branco moved in 2007\u201308 to Portugal, signing with Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal. His stint with the Sado River side proved a nightmare, as he failed to score a single Primeira Liga goal in two seasons combined, also receiving his marching orders in a 1\u20132 away loss against C.F. Os Belenenses on 11 April 2009; he netted twice in official games during his stint, one in the Portuguese Cup and another in the domestic League Cup, with his team winning the latter competition. In the 2009 summer, Branco returned to his country, signing with Crici\u00fama Esporte Clube. The following year he switched to amateurs Clube Atl\u00e9tico Metropolitano, and continued playing at that level in the subsequent campaigns, representing for example Clube N\u00e1utico Marc\u00edlio Dias and Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Cultural Recreativa e Esportiva Atl\u00e9tico Cidade in several stints. ==Honours== ;Vit\u00f3ria de Set\u00fabal *Ta\u00e7a da Liga: 2007\u201308 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:People from Lages Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie D players Category:Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Chapecoense de Futebol players Category:Ituano FC players Category:Gr\u00eamio Esportivo Juventus players Category:Crici\u00fama Esporte Clube players Category:Clube Atl\u00e9tico Metropolitano players Category:Esporte Clube Internacional de Lages players Category:Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Audax Italiano footballers Category:Primeira Liga players Category:Vit\u00f3ria F.C. players Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Chile Category:Expatriate footballers in Portugal Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Portugal ",
