    "text": "Intimations of Immortality, Op. 29, an ode for tenor, chorus, and orchestra, is one of the best-known works by English composer Gerald Finzi. It is a setting of nine of the eleven stanzas (all but the seventh and eighth) of William Wordsworth's \"Ode: Intimations of Immortality\", cast as a single continuous movement of 45 minutes duration. Finzi began composing the work in the late 1930s, but did not complete it until 1950, just before it was performed on 5 September at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester Cathedral, with Eric Greene as soloist and Herbert Sumsion conducting.http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/tw.asp?w=W4412 Music critics and historians have pointed out there are obvious stylistic similarities between portions of Intimations and William Walton's 1931 cantata Belshazzar's Feast: ==References== ==Recordings== * Philip Langridge, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir, Richard Hickox.
