It consists of a long stick of wood (roughly the height of its user) with a wide blade attached to one end. It resembles a very large axe, although it is used in a different manner. The use of the gandasa as a weapon was made famous by the Lollywood film Maula Jatt (1979) and its sequels, in which the implement was portrayed as an Excalibur-like weapon used in the Punjabi Pakistani action films for fighting and killing other people. ==Soundtrack== The music of Gandasa is composed by Wajahat Attre with lyrics penned by Ahmad Rahi. ===Track listing=== ==References== == External links == * Category:1991 films Category:Pakistani action films Category:Pakistani crime films Category:Lollywood Category:Punjabi-language films Category:Pakistani films Category:1990s Punjabi-language films ",
