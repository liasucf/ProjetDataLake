He made the acquaintance of Henri Frenay at some point during military school where he became a specialist of the 4th Bureau. Leader of a company of the French 13th motorized infantry, he was wounded by a bomb explosion at the start of the German offensive. In collaboration with Frenay and Lieutenant Pierre de Froment, Gu\u00e9don organised the Lib\u00e9ration Nationale information and propaganda movement. When the Combat Zone Nord group was annihilated through arrests, Gu\u00e9don passed into the zone Sud. He commanded a company of the 7th regiment of Moroccan tirailleurs in Morocco until the allied landings. During the Tunisian campaign, he was head of the 4th Bureau (transport) of the Moroccan mountain division. Assigned as an instructor in a staff school, he subsequently entered the commissariat of prisoners and deportees, where Frenay charged him with organizing the future repatriation of French nationals held in Germany. ==Sources== * File on Colonel Gu\u00e9don in the Defence Historical Service of France ==Bibliographic summary== * Henri Frenay : La nuit finira, Paris, Laffont, 1975 * Marie Granet et Henri Michel : Combat, histoire d'un mouvement de r\u00e9sistance, Paris, PUF, 1957 * FNDIRP-UNADIF : Le\u00e7ons de t\u00e9n\u00e8bres, Paris, Perrin, 2004 * FNDIRP-UNADIF, Bernard Filaire : Jusqu'au bout de la r\u00e9sistance, Paris, Stock, 1997 * Henri Nogu\u00e8res : Histoire de la R\u00e9sistance en France, Paris, Robert Laffont, 1972 Category:French Resistance members Category:1902 births Category:1978 deaths ",
