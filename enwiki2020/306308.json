Tischbein () Honesty is a facet of moral character that connotes positive and virtuous attributes such as integrity, truthfulness, straightforwardness, including straightforwardness of conduct, along with the absence of lying, cheating, theft, etc. Honesty also involves being trustworthy, loyal, fair, and sincere.

William Shakespeare famously described honesty as an attribute people leave behind when he wrote that \"no legacy is so rich as honesty\" in act 3 scene 5 of \"All's Well that Ends Well.\"William Shakespeare.

Ethics: Theory and Contemporary Issues, Concise Edition, p. 93. For example, individuals may be perceived as being \"too honest\" if they honestly express the negative opinions of others, either without having been asked their opinion, or having been asked in a circumstance where the response would be trivial. This concern manifests in the concept of political correctness, with individuals refraining from expressing their true opinions due to a general societal condemnation of such views. ==Definitions== Merriam-Webster defines honesty as \"fairness and straightforwardness of conduct\" or \"adherence to the facts.\"Merriam-Webster (2017) Honesty Merriam-Webster.
