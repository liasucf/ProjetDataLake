Although he passed the first stage of the imperial examination, he did not succeed in passing the higher levels before the political turmoil of the new dynasty, but instead turned to writing for the market. Li was an actor, producer, and director as well as a playwright, who traveled with his own troupe. His play F\u0113ngzh\u0113ng w\u00f9 (\u98a8\u7b8f\u8aa4, \"Errors caused by the Kite\") remains a favorite of the Chinese Kun opera stage. His biographers call him a \"writer-entrepreneur\" and the \u201cmost versatile and enterprising writer of his time\u201d.Chun-shu Chang Shelley Hsueh-lun Chang, Crisis and Transformation in Seventeenth-Century China: Society, Culture, and Modernity in Li Y\u00fc's World (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1992), 48, 60\u201371, 161. Li is the presumed author of R\u00f2u p\u00fatu\u00e1n (\u8089\u84b2\u5718, The Carnal Prayer Mat), a well-crafted comedy and a classic of Chinese erotic literature.Chang and Chang, Crisis and Transformation in Seventeenth-Century China: Society, Culture, and Modernity in Li Y\u00fc's World. 16, 232\u201338, doubt Li's authorship. He also wrote a book of short stories called Sh\u00ed'\u00e8r l\u00f3u (\u5341\u4e8c\u6a13, \"Twelve Towers\"). In his time he was widely read, and appreciated for his daringly innovative subject matter. He addresses the topic of same-sex love in the tale Cu\u00ecy\u01ce l\u00f3u (\u8403\u96c5\u6a13, \"House of Gathered Refinements\"). This is a theme which he revisits in the collection W\u00fash\u0113ng x\u00ec (\u7121\u8072\u6232, \"Silent Operas\" i.e. \"novels\") and his play The Fragrant Companion. The painting manual Jieziyuan Huazhuan was prefaced and published by Li in Jinling. Li was also known for his informal essays, or xiaopin (), and for his gastronomy and gastronomical writings. Lin Yutang championed Li and translated a number of these essays. Li's whimsical, ironic \"On Having a Stomach\" proposes that the mouth and the stomach \"cause all the worry and trouble of mankind throughout the ages.\" He continues that the \"plants can live without a mouth and a stomach, and the rocks and the soil have their being without any nourishment. Why, then, must we be given a mouth and a stomach and endowed with these two extra organs?\" Yutang Lin, The Importance of Living (New York: John Day: Reynal & Hitchcock, 1937), 43. Lin also translated Li's \"How to be Happy Though Rich\" and \"How to be Happy Though Poor\", and \"The Arts of Sleeping, Walking, Sitting and Standing\", which illustrate his satirical approach to serious topics.Yutang Lin, The Importance of Understanding: Translations from the Chinese (Cleveland: World, 1960). ==Translations== * Patrick Hanan et al.
