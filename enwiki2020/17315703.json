Usually the colophon is abbreviated in subsequent mentions in the same manuscript. The texts of the manuscripts that share the colophon are not necessarily textually related (though a surprising number belong to Group \u039b (039), 164, 262, and perhaps some of the many manuscripts Wisse does not classify). In many cases the colophon was copied down from document to document independent of the text. The majority of these manuscripts are representative of the Byzantine text-type. The meaning of the colophon was discussed by Kirsopp Lake. Lake holds that the \"Holy Mountain\" is Mount Sinai.K. Lake, On the Italian Origin of Codex Bezae, Journal of Theological Studies, Vol. I, No. 3 (April, 1900), p. 445 According to Caspar Ren\u00e9 Gregory it would be possible that the manuscript Tischendorfianus III was written and corrected in Jerusalem.C.
