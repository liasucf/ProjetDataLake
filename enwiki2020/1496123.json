    "text": "Outside view of Casa del Moral The \"Casa del Moral\" (House of the mulberry tree) is a large ancestral house built around 1730 in Arequipa, Peru. Favored by tourists, it is one of the best and well-preserved samples of Andean Baroque civil architecture in Peru. The name of the house derives from the emblematic presence of a centennial tree of \"moras\" (Mulberry) in the center of the main patio of the large house. The Casa del Moral houses a collection of paintings from the \"Escuela Cusque\u00f1a\" (Cusco School), a colonial art form. Its library contains more than 3,000 volumes, primarily hispanic literature. The house is currently the property of the Peruvian bank Bancosur. ==See also== * Santa Catalina Monastery * Goyeneche Palace, Arequipa * Arequipa, ciudad de luz y terremoto * Sachaca, pueblo tradicional de Arequipa * \u201cCasa del Moral\u201d - in Spanish * AQPlink - in Spanish Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1630 Category:Buildings and structures in Arequipa Category:1630 establishments in the Spanish Empire Category:Houses in Peru Category:Andean Baroque architecture in Peru ",
