Coached by third-year head coach John McLendon, the Tigers finished the season with a 31\u20134 record and were crowned NAIA national champions by winning the 1957 NAIA Tournament. This marked the first of three consecutive national championships, a feat that no other team at any level of college basketball had previously accomplished. In addition, the 1956\u201357 team became the first historically black college to win a national basketball title. In 2019, all three national championship teams were inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. ==Individual honors== * Associated Press Little All-America \u2013 Dick Barnett * NAIA All-America \u2013 Dick Barnett, John Barnhill, James Satterwhite ==References== Tennessee AandI Category:Tennessee State Tigers basketball seasons Category:NAIA Men's Basketball Tournament championship seasons Category:Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductees Tennessee AandI State Basketball Tennessee AandI State Basketball ",
