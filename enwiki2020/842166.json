After the war he qualified as a solicitor and made several unsuccessful attempts to win the Warwick and Leamington constituency in 1951, 1955, 1957 and 1959, before being successful in 1964 in Coventry South, which he represented (later as Coventry South East) until retiring from Parliament in 1983. He also was a Warwickshire County Councillor from 1958, being leader of the Labour Group in the 1960s and from 1972 to 1993. Wilson was responsible for piloting the Divorce Reform Act 1969 through Parliament which changed the basis for divorce procedures from the old concept of matrimonial offences to that of the irretrievable breakdown of marriage. ==References== * \"William Wilson\" (obituary), The Times online, 20 September 2010. * Obituary in Telegraph, 28 September 2010 == External links == * * Catalogue of Wilson's papers, held at the Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick Category:1913 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of Birmingham Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1964\u20131966 Category:UK MPs 1966\u20131970 Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979 Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983 Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Warwickshire Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:Members of Warwickshire County Council Category:British Army soldiers Category:English solicitors ",
