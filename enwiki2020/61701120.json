    "text": "Google Chat (formerly known as Hangouts Chat) is a communication software developed by Google built for teams that provides direct messages and team chat rooms, similar to competitors Slack and Microsoft Teams, along with a group messaging function that allows Google Drive content sharing. It is one of two apps that constitute the replacement for Google Hangouts, the other being Google Meet. Google planned to begin retiring Google Hangouts in October 2019. The current version is for Google Workspace, (formerly G Suite until October 2020https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/introducing- google-workspace) customers only, with identical features in all packages except a lack of Vault data retention in the Basic package. ==History== Google Chat was called Hangouts Chat before it was rebranded. Following the rebranding, and along with a similar change for Hangouts Meet, the Hangouts brand is to be removed from Google Workspace. It will remain a consumer-level product for people using standard Google accounts.https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21215588/google-chat-hangouts-meet- g-suite-name-change-rebrandinghttps://www.techradar.com/news/google-hangouts- officially-rebrands-as-google-chathttps://bgr.com/2020/04/10/google-hangouts- vs-zoom-google-meet-and-google-chat-apps-for-g-suite/ While Google Meet introduced the above features to upgrade the original Hangouts application, some standard Hangouts features were deprecated, including viewing attendees and chat simultaneously. The number of video feeds allowed at one time was also reduced to 8 (while up to 4 feeds can be shown in a \"tiles\" layout), prioritizing those attendees who most recently used their microphone. Additionally features such as the chat box were changed to overlay the video feeds, rather than resizing the latter to fit. ==See also== *Google Talk, a defunct instant messaging service released by Google in 2005 *Google Hangouts, an instant messaging service launched by Google in 2013 *Google Allo, a defunct instant messaging service released by Google in 2016 *Google Meet, a video-communication service launched by Google in 2017 *Google Voice, the Google telephone call routing and voicemail service *Chat, the name used by Google for Rich Communication Services in the Messages app for Android. ==References== Category:IOS software Category:Android (operating system) software Category:Cross-platform software Category:2017 software Category:Google instant messaging software ",
