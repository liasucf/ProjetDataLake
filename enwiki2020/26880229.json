    "text": "Seven Stars Tavern is located in Woodstown, Salem County, New Jersey, United States. The building was built in 1762 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 17, 1976. It is said to be haunted. In the early 20th century, the Stephens family lived there and experienced multiple sightings of paranormal activities, including: figures on horseback riding up to the tavern window - which once served as one of the nation's first \"drive through\" windows during the Revolutionary War times. On one occasion, an infant (Dorothy Stephens) was in a crib in a bedroom when a figure in a white gown bent down over her and appeared to be intent on picking her up. The child's sister (Elizabeth), returning from a night out with friends, saw the figure as she checked on the child and, when she called out, the figure disappeared. In the 1980s, a Philadelphia-based news team performed a live seance in the attic. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Salem County, New Jersey ==References== Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1762 Category:Buildings and structures in Salem County, New Jersey Category:National Register of Historic Places in Salem County, New Jersey Category:Drinking establishments on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey Category:New Jersey Register of Historic Places Category:Woodstown, New Jersey ",
