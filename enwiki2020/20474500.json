    "text": "Gr\u00e9gory Sertic (; born 5 August 1989) is a French professional footballer who plays as a defensive midfielder. ==Club career== ===Bordeaux=== Born in Br\u00e9tigny-sur-Orge, Essonne of Croatian descent, Sertic joined FC Girondins de Bordeaux's youth system at the age of 15, from the famed Clairefontaine academy. During the 2007\u201308 season, spent in the Championnat de France Amateur with the senior reserves, he earned praise from first team manager Laurent Blanc. Sertic made his debut in Ligue 1 on 29 April 2009, starting in a 2\u20133 away win against Stade Rennais FC. His maiden competitive appearance had taken place on 11 November of the previous year, in the 4\u20132 home victory over En Avant de Guingamp for the round of 16 of the Coupe de la Ligue where he came on as a late substitute; his first goal in the former competition was scored in only his second appearance, helping the hosts defeat FC Sochaux-Montb\u00e9liard 3\u20130. For the 2010\u201311 season, Sertic was loaned to fellow league club RC Lens. ===Marseille=== On 30 January 2017, Sertic signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Olympique de Marseille. During his spell at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome, he played sparingly due to an anterior cruciate ligament injury. In February 2019, Sertic moved to FC Z\u00fcrich of the Swiss Super League until the end of the season. ==International career== On 25 May 2009, Sertic was called up for the first time to the France under-21 side which was due to participate in that year's Toulon Tournament. He made his debut in the competition on 6 June, playing 36 minutes in the 1\u20130 group stage defeat of Portugal. Sertic was granted Croatian citizenship in March 2013, as his paternal grandfather was a native of Brinje who moved to the French capital. However, FIFA did not allow him to play for that national team due to new rules about naturalisation of players. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|CupIncludes the Coupe de France. !colspan=\"2\"|League CupIncludes the Coupe de la Ligue. !colspan=\"2\"|ContinentalIncludes the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League. !colspan=\"2\"|OtherIncludes the Troph\u00e9e des Champions. !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |rowspan=\"9\"|Bordeaux |2008\u201309 |rowspan=\"8\"|Ligue 1 |6||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||6||1 |- |2009\u201310 |12||0||1||0||2||0||3Three appearances in the 2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League||0||0||0||18||0 |- |2011\u201312 |18||0||3||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||22||0 |- |2012\u201313 |26||0||6||1||1||0||11Eleven appearances in the 2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League||0||0||0||44||1 |- |2013\u201314 |30||3||1||0||1||0||4Four appearances in the 2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League||0||1One appearance in the 2013 Troph\u00e9e des Champions||0||37||3 |- |2014\u201315 |27||1||1||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||30||1 |- |2015\u201316 |1||0||0||0||0||0||2Two appearances in the 2015\u201316 UEFA Europa League||0||0||0||3||0 |- |2016\u201317 |17||1||1||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||19||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !137!!6!!13!!1!!8!!0!!20!!0!!1!!0!!179!!7 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Bordeaux II |2010\u201311 |rowspan=\"1\"|CFA 2 |8||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||8||0 |- |2013\u201314 |rowspan=\"3\"|CFA |1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |2014\u201315 |1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- |2015\u201316 |1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !11!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!11!!0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Lens (loan) |2010\u201311 |rowspan=\"1\"|Ligue 1 |23||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||24||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Lens II (loan) |2010\u201311 |rowspan=\"1\"|CFA |3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||3||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Marseille |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"2\"|Ligue 1 |8||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||9||0 |- |2017\u201318 |7||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4||0||0||0||11||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !15!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!4||0!!0!!0!!20!!0 |- |Marseille B |2017\u201318 |National 2 |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||2||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !191!!6!!14!!1!!9!!0!!24!!0!!1!!0!!239!!7 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== Bordeaux *Ligue 1: 2008\u201309 *Coupe de France: 2012\u201313 *Coupe de la Ligue: 2008\u201309 *Troph\u00e9e des Champions: 2009 ==References== ==External links== *Bordeaux official profile *Marseille official profile * * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:People from Br\u00e9tigny-sur- Orge Category:French people of Croatian descent Category:Sportspeople from Essonne Category:French footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Ligue 1 players Category:Championnat National 2 players Category:Championnat National 3 players Category:ES Viry-Ch\u00e2tillon players Category:INF Clairefontaine players Category:FC Girondins de Bordeaux players Category:RC Lens players Category:Olympique de Marseille players Category:Swiss Super League players Category:FC Z\u00fcrich players Category:France under-21 international footballers Category:French expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Switzerland ",
