Poster for 1842 England XI game at the Beverley Ground, Canterbury ==Life and cricket career== Baker was born at the Deanery in Canterbury in Kent and was educated at Blackheath Proprietary School. He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, although there is no record of his having received a university degree. Baker played in 22 first-class cricket matches for Kent and Cambridge University, making his debut for Kent in 1841, before the foundation of the county club in 1842. He played in the new county club's first match in August 1842 against the All-England XI. He played a few games for the amateur Gentlemen of Kent side from 1842, and in 1843 he appeared twice for Cambridge University, though he did not play in the University Match against Oxford University. Baker was credited as the manager of the Kent cricket team from around 1847 to his death and as one of the instigators of Canterbury Cricket Week which moved from the Beverley Ground to the St Lawrence Ground in 1847 and remains the world's longest running cricket festival. He was also responsible for a series of annual rural fetes in Canterbury. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1823 births Category:1888 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:Kent cricketers Category:Gentlemen of Kent cricketers Category:Cambridge University cricketers Category:English cricket administrators Category:People educated at Blackheath Proprietary School Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge ",
