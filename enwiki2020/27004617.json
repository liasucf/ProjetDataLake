Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=382199 on 2012-12-30 ==Taxonomy == The superfamily Angarioidea was created as a new superfamily by Williams et al. (2008).Williams S. T., Karube S. & Ozawa T. (September 2008) \"Molecular systematics of Vetigastropoda: Trochidae, Turbinidae and Trochoidea redefined\". Zoologica Scripta 37(5): 483-506. The same suggest that something similar may be done in the future for Arene, but Bouchet & Rocroi (2005) note that Areneinae McLean, 2001, introduced in a congress abstract, is not an available family-level name. This superfamily consists of the two following families: * Angariidae Gray, 1857 - only one genus Angaria R\u00f6ding, 1798 * Areneidae - Areneidae is however not officially described as a taxon name.WoRMS (2010). Arene Adams, 1845. In: Bouchet, P.; Gofas, S.; Rosenberg, G. (2010) World Marine Mollusca database. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=413481 on 2010-04-17 Areneidae is provisionally placed within the superfamily Angarioidea according to Williams et al.
