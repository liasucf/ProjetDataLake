Dvorna in Dr\u017eavna Tiskarna, p. 30.) in a small valley west of the main village core. ==Name== Sidol was first mentioned in written sources in 1291 and circa 1400 as Suchidol (and as Suchwdol in 1477, as Sihidal in 1664, and as s Sidala in 1769). The name is a dialect contraction of Suhi dol (literally, 'dry valley'; Suh\u00ed d\u00f4l > Sh\u00eddol > S\u00eddol). The name refers to the local geography because there is no spring in Sidol. ==History== A bronze sculpture of a Roman deity was unearthed in Sidol in 1899 during excavation for a cistern, attesting to early settlement in the area. ===Mass grave=== Jevnik Mass Grave Sidol is the site of a mass grave from the period immediately after the Second World War.
