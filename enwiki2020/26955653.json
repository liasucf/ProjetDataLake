In 1861 Jonathan Nesbit added an addition to the third floor which was believed to be part of the Underground Railroad because of the crawl space above the bedroom where runaways would have hid. He designed the Greek Revival home after he constructed the First Presbyterian Church in 1856, which still resides in Lewisburg.
