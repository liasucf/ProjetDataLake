Cort\u00e9s gave Juan the daughter of Maxixcatzin, baptized as Do\u00f1a Elvira, after the Tlaxcallan's made peace with the Spanish. Juan had a determining participation in the defeat of the army of P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez, when Cort\u00e9s sent him to \"win him friends in Narv\u00e1ez' camp.\" He died when the Aztec army attacked the Spaniards as they fled the city of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, during the La Noche Triste. ==References== Category:Spanish explorers Category:Spanish conquistadors Category:16th-century Spanish people Category:Colonial Mexico Category:Explorers of Mexico Category:History of the Aztecs ",
