Alex Carlson of Hardcore Gamer gave the PC version of this \"underdog...competent, if uninspired indie platformer\" a review score of 3/5, opining, \"Amazing Princess Sarah is well- worth five bucks if you love old-school gems like Castlevania but if you\u2019re not into that classic retro scene, [it] will do as much to convince you of the genre\u2019s flaws as it convinces you of its strengths.\" Crystal Steltenpohl of Diehard GameFAN wrote about the Xbox 360 version, \"The (mostly) fun level design, interesting gameplay, and strong visuals bring together an experience that will remind you of older Metroidvania games while keeping it fresh. (...) The game is only $1. It\u2019s practically a steal. If you like these types of games, this is one I wouldn\u2019t recommend passing up on.\" According to Rob Hamilton of HonestGamers, who gave it a 8/10, \"The game's not perfect, but thanks to its low asking price, it's a great way to enjoy a flashback to the games you may have enjoyed during your childhood.\" ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Amazing Princess Sarah at Hardcore Gaming 101 Category:2014 video games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Indie video games Category:Metroidvania games Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Side-scrolling role-playing video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Steam Greenlight games Category:Video games developed in Italy Category:Video games featuring female antagonists Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Windows games Category:Windows Phone games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox One games ",
