    "text": "That is a function word used in the English language for several grammatical purposes. These include: * as a complementizer/subordinating conjunction. (\"He asked that she go.\") ** That can be omitted when used to introduce a subordinate clause\u2014\"he told me that it is a good read\" could just as easily be \"he told me it is a good read\". ** That can be used in subordinate conjunctions describing a person or people when who[m] is problematic. * to introduce a restrictive relative clause. (\"The test that she took was hard.\") In this role, that may be analyzed either as a relative pronoun or as a conjunction as in the first case; see English relative clauses: That as relativizer instead of relative pronoun. * as a demonstrative pronoun. (\"That was hard.\") (plural: those) * as a demonstrative adjective. (\"That test was hard.\") (plural: those) * as an adverb. (\"The test wasn't that bad.\") In the first two uses the word is usually pronounced weakly, as , whereas in the other uses it is pronounced . In the Old English language that was spelled \u00fe\u00e6t. It was also abbreviated as a letter Thorn, \u00fe, with the ascender crossed, \ua765 ( OE thaet.png ). In Middle English, the letter Ash, \u00e6, was replaced with the letter a, so that that was spelled \u00feat, or sometimes \u00feet. The ascender of the \u00fe was reduced (making it similar to the Old English letter Wynn, \u01bf), which necessitated writing a small t above the letter to abbreviate the word that ( ME that.png ). In later Middle English and Early Modern English the \u00fe evolved into a y shape, so that the word was spelled yat (although the spelling with a th replacing the \u00fe was starting to become more popular) and the abbreviation for that was a y with a small t above it ( File:EME that.svg ). This abbreviation can still be seen in reprints of the 1611 edition of the King James Version of the Bible in places such as IICorinthians 13:7. ==References== ==See also== * Dependent statement * Deixis Category:English grammar Category:English words ",
