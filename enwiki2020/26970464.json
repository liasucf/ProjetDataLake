    "text": "Ad\u00e8le Haenel (; born 11 February 1989) is a French actress. She is the recipient of several accolades, including two C\u00e9sar Awards from seven nominations and one Lumi\u00e8res Award from two nominations. Haenel began her career as a child actress, making her film debut with Les Diables (2002) at the age of 12, and quickly rose to prominence in the French entertainment industry as a teenager. She received her first C\u00e9sar Award nomination for her performance in Water Lilies (2007), which also marked the beginning of her long professional and personal relationship with director C\u00e9line Sciamma. In 2014, Haenel received her first C\u00e9sar Award for her supporting role in Suzanne, and in 2015 won the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress for Love at First Fight. She continued to garner recognition for her performances in BPM (Beats per Minute) (2017), The Trouble with You (2018) and Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019). == Early life == Haenel was born on 11 February 1989 in Paris. Her mother is a teacher and her father is a translator. She grew up in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis in what she described as \"a very left-wing, artistic neighborhood\". She has Austrian heritage through her father and speaks some German. Haenel started acting at the age of 5 and was involved in local theatre. As a child, Haenel would mimic cartoon characters, particularly the characters of Tex Avery. Haenel studied economics and social sciences at the Lyc\u00e9e Montaigne. She had planned to attend HEC Paris and took a preparatory course, but ultimately failed the entrance exam. Haenel continued her studies in economics and sociology, eventually receiving a master's degree. She also pursued studies in physics and marine biology. == Career == Haenel made her film debut in 2002 at the age of 12, playing an autistic girl in the film Les Diables. She had been chosen for the lead role after accompanying her brother to the audition. After Les Diables, Haenel took a five-year break from acting. In 2007, she was persuaded by casting director Christel Baras (who had cast her in her film debut) to resume her film career, taking up the part of a synchronised swimmer in C\u00e9line Sciamma's debut feature Water Lilies. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times highlighted Haenel's performance in an otherwise mixed review of the film, recognizing her as having \"the makings of a real star\". For her role in the film, Haenel was nominated for the C\u00e9sar Award for Most Promising Actress in 2008. In 2012, she was nominated in the same category for House of Tolerance (2011), a period film directed by Bertrand Bonello, in which she played a prostitute at an upscale Parisian brothel at the turn of the twentieth century. She also received the Lumi\u00e8res Award for Most Promising Actress along with her co-stars C\u00e9line Sallette and Alice Barnole. Haenel in 2014, receiving her first C\u00e9sar Award for Suzanne Haenel played one of the two sisters in Katell Quill\u00e9v\u00e9r\u00e9's Suzanne (2013), for which she received the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Supporting Actress. In 2014, Haenel starred in the Thomas Cailley romantic comedy Love at First Fight as Madeleine, a graduate-school dropout and survivalist. She won the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress for her performance. In the same year, Haenel co-starred with Catherine Deneuve in Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9's crime drama In the Name of My Daughter, playing the daughter of a casino owner. Writing for The Village Voice, Melissa Anderson compared her performance to that of Isabelle Adjani's in the 1970s and '80s, and declared her a worthy successor to Deneuve in French cinema. For her roles in both films, Hanael received a Best Actress nomination at the 20th Lumi\u00e8res Awards. In 2016 Haenel made her German language debut in the film The Bloom of Yesterday playing the French descendant of German Holocaust survivors. In the 2017 Robin Campillo film BPM (Beats per Minute), Haenel portrayed Sophie, a headstrong HIV/AIDS activist of the Paris chapter of ACT UP. She received a nomination for the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. Haenel starred in the 2018 Pierre Salvadori crime comedy The Trouble with You, playing a widowed detective based on the French Riviera. David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter noted her performance as evoking the \"classic screwball heroine\", a departure from her usually more serious roles, and complimented her on the \"grace and buoyancy\" she brought to the character. She was again nominated for the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress. In 2019, Haenel appeared in three films which played at the Cannes Film Festival: Quentin Dupieux's Deerskin, Aude L\u00e9a Rapin's Heroes Don't Die, and C\u00e9line Sciamma's Portrait of a Lady on Fire. In Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Haenel portrayed H\u00e9lo\u00efse, a young aristocrat in 18th-century Brittany who is to be married off to a nobleman from Milan. The New Yorker's Richard Brody took note of her chemistry with co-star No\u00e9mie Merlant and complimented the actresses for being \"relentlessly graceful, endowed with physical aplomb, contemplative insight, and strong emotion\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times considered Haenel's performance worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, and Bilge Ebiri of Vulture described the climax of the film (which features Haenel) as \"one of the finest pieces of acting and one of the most moving images I\u2019ve seen in eons.\" Haenel was nominated for the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress for her performance, her seventh C\u00e9sar nomination. ==Personal life== In 2014, Haenel came out as a lesbian during her C\u00e9sar award acceptance speech and acknowledged her relationship with director C\u00e9line Sciamma, whom she met on the set of Water Lilies. The couple amicably split a few years later and before they began work on Portrait of a Lady on Fire. In 2018, she was briefly in a relationship with musician and singer Julia Lano\u00eb from the band Sexy Sushi. Haenel identifies as a feminist. She is a prominent face of France's #MeToo movement, and was the first prominent actress to speak publicly about abuse within the French film industry. In a November 2019 Mediapart interview, Haenel accused director Christophe Ruggia of sexually harassing her from the time she was 12 to 15 after casting her in his film Les Diables. Following the experience, she considered abandoning acting altogether. Haenel's account was backed up by many people who had worked on the film and noted Ruggia's inappropriate behaviour towards her, along with letters he had written her at the time proclaiming his love for her. As a result Ruggia was expelled from the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des r\u00e9alisateurs de films, the guild for French directors.O'Connor, Roisin (7 November 2019). \"Adele Haenel: French film industry rocked by childhood sexual harassment allegations against director Christophe Ruggia.\" The Independent. Retrieved 1 March 2020. Though Haenel had explicitly chosen not to go to the police with her accusations, citing the justice system as \"usually condemning so few sexual offenders\" and \"only one rape out of a hundred\" and stating that \"the justice ignores us, we ignore the justice\", the publicity garnered by her interviews about the abuse led the Paris prosecutor's office to announce they were investigating Ruggia. Haenel later changed her mind about working with the police and officially filed a complaint against Ruggia in late November 2019. In January 2020, the police officially charged Ruggia with sexual aggression against a minor by a person of authority and sexual harassment. On 28 February 2020, Haenel, along with No\u00e9mie Merlant, C\u00e9line Sciamma and A\u00efssa Ma\u00efga, walked out of the 45th C\u00e9sar Awards ceremony after Roman Polanski, who was convicted of raping 13-year old Samantha Geimer, won the award for Best Director for his film An Officer and a Spy. As Haenel left, she waved her fist and shouted \"La honte!\" (\u201cShame!\u201d), and after exiting the auditorium, she was filmed clapping sarcastically and shouting \"Bravo la p\u00e9dophilie!\" (\"Bravo, paedophilia!\"). == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
