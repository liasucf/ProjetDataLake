    "text": "Robert Emmet Chambers Jr. (born September 25, 1966) is an American criminal and convicted killer. Chambers was dubbed the Preppy Killer by the media after the August 26, 1986, New York City Central Park strangulation death of 18-year-old Jennifer Levin, for which he was originally charged with second degree murder. He claimed the death was accidental and the result of rough sex, and later pleaded guilty to manslaughter at the end of his trial. == Early life == Chambers was accepted by Boston University, where he completed one semester but was asked to leave because of difficulties, one involving a stolen credit card. He subsequently committed other petty thefts and burglaries in connection with his drug and alcohol abuse. Unable to hold a job, he was issued a summons for disorderly conduct one night after leaving Dorrian's Red Hand, a bar located at 300 East 84th Street in Manhattan. Chambers destroyed the summons as the police were leaving the scene, yelling, \"You fucking cowards, you should stick to niggers!\" == Killing of Jennifer Levin == === Background === Levin and Chambers briefly dated. The day of the murder, both were at Dorrian's Red Hand. === Finding of the body === Jennifer Levin's half-naked corpse, covered in dust, and bite marks, was found by a cyclist in Central Park near Fifth Avenue and 83rd Street, behind the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Clothing from Levin's upper body had been pushed up around her neck, and her skirt was around her waist. The medical examiner's office determined she had been strangled. Police noted there were numerous cuts and bruises on her neck, both from the strangulation and from her own fingernails as she clawed at her killer's hands. Later, Chambers hid and watched as police officers surveyed the scene. Investigators found Levin's underwear some away. ===Arrest and trial=== As he was Levin's boyfriend, police apprehended him for interrogation. Afterward they noticed the numerous scratches on his arms and face, which he blamed on his cat before admitting Levin and he separated after leaving the bar, with her going to buy smokes. On being told she wasn't a smoker, he claimed she died during an aggressive sexual encounter in the park. Before booking, Chambers was permitted to see his father, to whom he said, \"That fucking bitch, why didn't she leave me alone?\" Archbishop Theodore Edgar McCarrick of Newark, New Jersey, later Archbishop of Washington, wrote a letter of support for Chambers' bail application. He had known Chambers and his mother because she had been employed as a nurse by Cardinal Terence Cooke. McCarrick was close to the Chambers family and had served as Robert's godfather at his baptism. In 2019, he was defrocked for sexual crimes against adults and minors. Chambers had secured bail through his family and the owner of the bar, Jack Dorrian, who put up his townhouse as collateral for a bail bond. Chambers was charged with, and tried for, two counts of second-degree murder. His defense was that Levin's death had occurred during \"rough sex\". He was defended by Jack Litman, who had previously used the temporary insanity defense on behalf of Richard Herrin for the murder of Yale University student Bonnie Garland. Litman claimed Levin was promiscuous, telling she had a sex diary and that her sexual history was admissible as evidence, prompting headlines such as \"How Jennifer Courted Death\" (Daily News). On remand, he was filmed twisting off the head of a Barbie doll and saying \"Oops, I think I killed her\". Prosecutor Linda Fairstein stated: \"In more than 8,000 cases of reported assaults in the last ten years, this is the first in which a male reported being sexually assaulted by a female.\" When the jury failed to reach a verdict after nine days of deliberation, the prosecution had to allow Chambers to plead guilty for manslaughter, and he received a sentence of 15 years. == Post-conviction== In 1997, Chambers sent an untitled essay he wrote to prison anthologist Jeff Evans. The piece, subsequently titled \"Christmas: Present\", appeared in the book, Undoing Time: American Prisoners in Their Own Words.Northeastern University Press, 2001 Written while Chambers was incarcerated at Green Haven Correctional Facility in Stormville, New York, the essay is an entry from one of his journals, which he calls \"a record of the meaningless hope and frightening losses of a person I don't even know\". Chambers was released from Auburn Prison on February 14, 2003, after having served the entirety of his prison term due to his numerous infractions. His release was a media circus, with reporters staking out prime sections of the sidewalk opposite the prison as early as thirteen hours before his 7:30 a.m. release time. The same day, the NBC News program Dateline NBC interviewed Chambers, who continued to claim that he strangled Levin accidentally in an attempt to stop her from hurting him during rough sex. He also falsely denied that he had been disciplined in prison. The owner of Dorrian's Red Hand settled with Levin's parents on their claim that the bar where Levin and Chambers had been before they went to Central Park on the night of her death had served too much alcohol to Chambers. A wrongful death lawsuit, which Chambers did not contest, provides that he must pay all lump sums he receives, including any income from book or movie deals, plus ten percent of his future income (up to $25 million), to the Levin family. The family has said all the money it gets from Chambers will go to victims' rights organizations.Wolfe, Linda. Wasted: The Preppie Murder. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1989. ==Drug charges== Chambers pleaded guilty in July 2005, and on August 29 was sentenced to a reduced sentence of 90 days in jail and fined $200 for the license violation. The judge added ten days to the time prosecutors and Chambers' lawyer had agreed on because Chambers was an hour late for the hearing. He had faced up to a year in jail if he had been convicted after trial. On October 22, 2007, Chambers was arrested again, this time in his own apartment, and charged with three counts of selling a controlled substance in the first degree, three counts of selling a controlled substance in the second degree, and one count of resisting arrest. Kovell was also arrested on one count of selling a controlled substance in the second degree. The New York Daily News reported: > Cops said Chambers, 41, struggled with officers who tried to handcuff him on > the felony charges. One detective suffered a broken thumb in the fracas. Commenting on his new arrest, former Assistant District Attorney Linda Fairstein, who had prosecuted Chambers for Levin's death, said: > Doesn't surprise me. I always believed his problem with drugs and alcohol > would get him in trouble again. He's had the opportunity in prison to detox > and take college courses, to straighten out his life, but that clearly is of > no interest to him. He's learned nothing in the last 20 years. Chambers and Kovell were charged with running a cocaine operation out of the apartment. The two had previously been given notices for not paying rent, and the phone had been disconnected. Chambers appeared in court on December 18; according to the New York Post, his lawyer filed \"new papers elaborating on his psychiatric defense\". The filing claimed that Chambers had become an addict at the age of 14 and was, by 2007, using ten to twelve bags of heroin a day. It was also reported that he also used cocaine, was smoking marijuana and taking prescription drugs. Chambers planned to plead insanity. Prosecutors countered that Chambers was a drug dealer and had sold as much as $2,800 in heroin at a time to undercover police. Chambers faced life in prison on the drug charges. On August 11, 2008, the Manhattan DA's office announced that Chambers had pleaded guilty to selling drugs. On September 2, 2008, he was sentenced to 19 years on the drug charge.http://www.wnbc.com/news/17370538/detail.html As of March 2019, he is at Sullivan Correctional Facility, New York State Department of Corrections DIN (Department Identification Number) #08A4763. His earliest release date from prison is January 25, 2024; his maximum release date is October 15, 2026. ==In popular culture== *The Sonic Youth song \"Eliminator Jr.\", from their 1988 album Daydream Nation (1988) is about the Chambers case. *The song \"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\" in The Killers' album Hot Fuss (2004) was inspired by Chambers' defense of the Jennifer Levin murder charges, in which Chambers claimed he had no motive for the murder, and that he and the victim were \"friends\". *In 1989, the Chambers case was the basis of a TV movie titled The Preppie Murder, starring William Baldwin as Chambers and Lara Flynn Boyle as Levin. *In 1990, the television series Law & Order based the episode \"Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die\" on the case. *Mike Doyle has stated that his character, Adam Guenzel on Oz, (1997\u20132003) was based on Chambers. *The 2003 Law & Order: Criminal Intent episode \"Monster\" was based on both the Chambers case and the Central Park Jogger case. *In the novel American Psycho, protagonist Patrick Bateman - wealthy, preppy serial killer - mentions trying to start a defense fund for Chambers. *In the collection Shock Treatment by Karen Finley, Chambers is mentioned twice. *AMC aired a five-part mini-series The Preppy Murder: Death in Central Park on November 13, 2019. == References == ==Further reading== * Benedict, Helen.
