    "text": "The leukotriene (LT) receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that bind and are activated by the leukotrienes. They include the following proteins: * Leukotriene B4 receptors (BLTRs) \u2013 bind to and are activated by LTB4: ** BLT1 (Leukotriene B4 receptor 1) \u2013 ** BLT2 (Leukotriene B4 receptor 2) \u2013 * Cysteinyl leukotriene receptors (CysLTRs) \u2013 bind to and are activated by LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4: ** CysLT1 (Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1) \u2013 ** CysLT2 (Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2) \u2013 The recently elucidated CysLTE, represented by GPR99/OXGR1, may constitute a third CysLTR. ==See also== * Eicosanoid receptor * Oxoeicosanoid receptor * Prostaglandin receptor * Thromboxane receptor ==References== ==External links== * IUPHAR GPCR Database \u2013 Leukotriene receptors * Category:Eicosanoids Category:G protein-coupled receptors ",
