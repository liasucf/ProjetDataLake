He is currently under contract with \u00c4ss\u00e4t of the Finnish Liiga. ==Playing career== S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m was contracted by Djurg\u00e5rdens IF in his native Sweden, playing at the J20 SuperElit level when he was selected by the New York Islanders in the 4th round (95th overall) of the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. After loan assignments in the HockeyAllsvenskan with S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje SK, Almtuna IS and HC Vita H\u00e4sten, S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m left Djurg\u00e5rdens IF without a senior appearance, agreeing to a one-year deal with HV71 on April 11, 2016. S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m made his SHL debut on October 1, 2016, making 30 saves on 31 shots in a game against Skellefte\u00e5 AIK. On May 11, 2017, S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the New York Islanders. He was returned on loan by the Islanders to continue his development and tenure with HV71 through the first year of his entry-level deal in the 2017\u201318 season. S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m moved to North America for the remaining two years of his entry- level contract, however his development was stalled through injury, limited to just 4 games with ECHL affiliate, the Worcester Railers, in the 2019\u201320 season. As an impending restricted free agent from the Islanders, while still harbouring NHL aspirations S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m returned to Europe to relaunch his career, agreeing to a one-year contract with Finnish outfit, \u00c4ss\u00e4t of the Liiga, on 31 July 2020. ==Personal life== S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at the age of 7. ==Awards and honors== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
