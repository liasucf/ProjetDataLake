The champion of the CSANF Cup, has the right, if affiliated at the same time with CONIFA, to qualify automatically to the following edition of the ConIFA World Cup as representative of the South American group. It is worth mentioning that this was a new opening, as until the 2019 agreement, ConIFA did not have any South American representation. However the CSANF champion was not obliged to participate in case it didn't want to. If the CSANF champion was not an affiliate or has financial issues that kept it from taking part, the CSANF runner-up (if affiliated with ConIFA) would earn the right to take part. ==Members== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
