    "text": "The Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars were a professional American football team which played in the United States Football League (USFL) in the mid-1980s. Owned by real-estate magnate Myles Tanenbaum, they were the short-lived league's dominant team, playing in all three championship games and winning the latter two. They played their first two seasons in Philadelphia as the Philadelphia Stars before relocating to Baltimore, where they played as the Baltimore Stars for the USFL's final season. Coached by Jim Mora, the Stars won a league-best 41 regular season games and 7 playoff games. == Founding == On May 11, 1982, the announcement of the USFL was officially made by league owner and antique dealer, David Dixon.http://www.usflsite.com/history.php The league's Philadelphia team would be owned by real estate developer Myles H. Tanenbaum. He had originally wanted to name the team the Stallions in honor of Rocky Balboa, who was nicknamed \"The Italian Stallion.\" However, when the Birmingham entry snapped up the Stallions name, Tanenbaum settled on \"Stars.\" George Perles was originally named as the team's head coach in July 1982. Perles, previously an assistant coach for the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, never coached a game for the Stars, opting to take the head coach position for Michigan State instead. On January 15, 1983, the Stars hired Jim Mora to be their head coach.http://usflrevisited.webs.com/phi.htm ==1983 season== The Stars began in Philadelphia in the USFL's inaugural 1983 season and played their home games at Veterans Stadium (the \"Vet\"). They compiled the league's best regular season record of , and advanced to the 1983 USFL championship game. Their \"Doghouse Defense\" allowed only 204 points in an 18-game season\u2014the least in the history of the league. The Stars were led by fourth- year quarterback Chuck Fusina (1978 Heisman Trophy runner-up), fifth-year wide receiver Scott Fitzkee, rookie halfback Kelvin Bryant of North Carolina, rookie offensive tackle Irv Eatman of UCLA, rookie linebacker Sam Mills, and second-year safety Scott Woerner. The team also featured Towson's all-star rookie punter Sean Landeta. At the conclusion of the regular season, Bryant was named the USFL's Player of the Year by the Associated Press.http://usflrevisited.webs.com/standingsawards.htm The Stars entered the playoffs as the top-seeded team. In the Semi-Finals, the Stars were able to defeat the preseason favorites to win the 1983 title\u2014George Allen's Chicago Blitz\u2014by withstanding seven turnovers and erasing a 21-point deficit in the fourth quarter to win 44\u201338 in overtime. In the league title game at Denver's Mile High Stadium on July 17, the Stars were edged out by Jim Stanley's Michigan Panthers, 24\u201322. Just as they had against the Blitz, the Stars opened the game sluggishly, but finished with a flourish, after allowing the Panthers to carry a 17\u20133 lead into the fourth quarter. One of the few blemishes on the Stars' first season was the box office. They only attracted 18,650 fans per game. In addition to bad weather, there were lingering memories of a massive gate-papering scandal involving the World Football League's Philadelphia Bell in 1974. The Bell had claimed that a total of over 120,000 fans had attended their first two games, but it subsequently emerged that all but 19,000 of the tickets had been given away for free or for significantly reduced prices. ==1983 Philadelphia Stars schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\"|Week ! style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\"|Day ! style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\"|Date ! style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\"|Opponent ! style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\"|Game site ! style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\"|Attendance ! style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\"|Television ! style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\"|Final Score ! style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\"|W/L ! style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\"|Record |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\" colspan=10|Regular Season |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 1 | Sunday | March 6 | at Denver Gold | Mile High Stadium | 45,102 | ABC | 13\u20137 | W | 1\u20130 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 2 | Sunday | March 13 | New Jersey Generals | Veterans Stadium | 38,205 | ABC | 25\u20130 | W | 2\u20130 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 3 | Monday | March 21 | at Birmingham Stallions | Legion Field | 12,850 | ESPN | 17\u201310 | W | 3\u20130 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 4 | Sunday | March 27 | Tampa Bay Bandits | Veterans Stadium | 18,718 | ABC | 22\u201327 | L | 3\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 5 | Sunday | April 3 | Washington Federals | Veterans Stadium | 14,576 | ABC | 34\u20133 | W | 4\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 6 | Sunday | April 10 | at Los Angeles Express | Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum | 18,671 | | 17\u20133 | W | 5\u20131 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 7 | Saturday | April 16 | at Oakland Invaders | Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum | 34,901 | ESPN | 17\u20137 | W | 6\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 8 | Sunday | April 24 | Boston Breakers | Veterans Stadium | 10,257 | ABC | 23\u201316 | W | 7\u20131 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 9 | Saturday | April 30 | at Tampa Bay Bandits | Tampa Stadium | 41,559 | ESPN | 24\u201310 | W | 8\u20131 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 10 | Sunday | May 8 | Denver Gold | Veterans Stadium | 14,306 | ABC | 6\u20133 | W | 9\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 11 | Sunday | May 15 | Chicago Blitz | Veterans Stadium | 25,251 | ABC | 31\u201324 | W | 10\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 12 | Sunday | May 22 | at Arizona Wranglers | Sun Devil Stadium | 18,151 | | 24\u20137 | W | 11\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 13 | Sunday | May 29 | at Boston Breakers | Nickerson Field | 15,668 | ABC | 17\u201321 | L | 11\u20132 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 14 | Sunday | June 5 | Michigan Panthers | Veterans Stadium | 19,727 | ABC | 29\u201320 | W | 12\u20132 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 15 | Sunday | June 12 | at New Jersey Generals | Giants Stadium | 32,521 | | 23\u20139 | W | 13\u20132 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 16 | Monday | June 20 | Oakland Invaders | Veterans Stadium | 16,933 | ESPN | 12\u20136 | W | 14\u20132 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 17 | Sunday | June 26 | Birmingham Stallions | Veterans Stadium | 17,973 | | 31\u201310 | W | 15\u20132 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 18 | Sunday | July 3 | at Washington Federals | RFK Stadium | 11,039 | | 14\u201321 | L | 15\u20133 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\" colspan=10|Playoffs |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | Divisional Playoff | Saturday | July 9 | Chicago Blitz | Veterans Stadium | 15,686 | ABC | 44\u201338 OT | W | \u2014 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | USFL Championship |Sunday | July 17 | vs. Michigan Panthers | Mile High Stadium | 50,906 | ABC | 22\u201324 | L | \u2014 |} Sourcesstatscrew.com 1983 Philadelphia Stars Game-by-Game Resultsusflsite.com 1983 USFL Seasonprofootballarchives.com 1983 Philadelphia Stars (USFL) ==1984 season== The Stars remained in Philadelphia for the 1984 season but were forced to relocate their post-season home games to Franklin Field due to a conflict with the Philadelphia Phillies. The Stars roared through the regular season with the league best record, and routed George Allen's Arizona Wranglers, 23\u20133 for the league title in Florida at Tampa Stadium on July 15. It was the last traditional professional football championship for the city of Philadelphia until the Eagles' Super Bowl LII victory at the end of the 2017 season, and its first since the 1960 NFL championship. The Stars were also becoming increasingly popular amongst fans, as average home attendance jumped from approximately 18,000 in 1983 to 28,000 in 1984.http://www.usflsite.com/stars.php After the league championship game, the Stars played a rare post-season exhibition game with Tampa Bay in England on July 21, and defeated the Bandits 24\u201321 at Wembley Stadium in London. ==1984 Philadelphia Stars schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The Stars quickly realized they could not compete with the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles. Years later, Tanenbaum said that even without the daunting prospect of going head-to-head with the Eagles, the Stars would have had to start the 1986 season on an extended road trip due to the Phillies sharing Veterans Stadium as well. Had the Phillies advanced to the World Series, the Stars would not be able to play a home game until November at the earliest. With no other stadium in the Philadelphia area suitable even for temporary use, Tanenbaum moved the team to Baltimore, which was still smarting from the loss of the NFL Colts three years earlier. It initially appeared that the Stars would be bolstered by a merger with the Pittsburgh Maulers. Owner Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. had folded the Maulers after just one season because knew he could not even begin to compete with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He agreed to join Tanenbaum as a minority partner, but decided to get out altogether soon afterward. Baltimore welcomed the Stars with open arms. Tanenbaum quickly signed a broadcasting deal with Baltimore's most powerful radio station, WBAL, and built a good relationship with then-mayor William Donald Schaefer. However, he ran into a problem when he discovered that the Stars could not play at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium until 1986 due to objections from Baltimore Orioles owner Edward Bennett Williams. Reportedly, general manager Hank Peters and manager Joe Altobelli were concerned about the Stars tearing up the turf. With no other stadium in the immediate Baltimore area suitable for temporary use, Tanenbaum was forced to play at the University of Maryland's Byrd Stadium in College Park, southwest of Baltimore and a Washington suburb (coincidentally, the Washington USFL franchise, the Federals, moved to Orlando as the Orlando Renegades the same season). This was all compounded by the Washington Redskins' success during these years which included playing in the Super Bowl in January 1983 and 1984. Further complicating matters, the team kept its operations in Philadelphia and commuted to College Park for games\u2014effectively consigning the Stars to 18 road games for the league's lame-duck spring season.https://www.phillyhistory.org/blog/index.php/2014/06/the-philadelphia- stars-philadelphias-other-pro-football-team/ ==1985 season== At least in part due to all the moving, the Stars initially struggled in 1985, but won nine of their last 13 games to secure a wild-card berth. They did so in front of a mostly empty Byrd Stadium, however. While Baltimore-area fans were happy to see the return of pro football after a two-year absence, they balked at making the 35-minute drive down Interstate 95 to see the Stars play in College Park. Most were waiting for the team to begin play in the city's venerable Memorial Stadium a year later. As a result, attendance sagged to the point that the Stars might have lost home-field advantage for the playoffs even with a winning record. ABC Sports, embarrassed at the dwindling attendance from around the league, told Usher it did not want to televise playoff games in near-empty stadiums. Since ABC had disproportionate influence on league affairs due to the structure of its contract with the USFL, Usher had little choice but to agree. However, the Stars managed to upend the favored New Jersey Generals and Birmingham Stallions in successive weeks to reach the title game at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. Once there, the Stars won the USFL title beating the Bobby Hebert-led Oakland Invaders, 28\u201324. Soon afterward, Tanenbaum sold controlling interest to fellow real estate magnate Stephen Ross. As it turned out, this was the final USFL game ever played. On July 29, 1986, a federal grand jury found in favor of the USFL in its antitrust suit against the NFL. However, the USFL was only awarded $1 in damages, tripled to $3 under antitrust law. The league's abandonment of Philadelphia was a factor in the adverse jury award. The jury foreman explained that while they agreed the NFL was a monopoly, they could not agree on the size of the award. As a result, the jury misinterpreted the law and decided on the $1 award, feeling it would be changed by the presiding judge. However, the judge was not able to increase the amount once it was stipulated by the jury. As a result, the league suspended operations a day later, never to return. ==1985 Baltimore Stars schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\"|Week ! style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\"|Day !

Retrieved December 15, 2018 ==Legacy== The Stars are widely acknowledged to have been the best team to see the field in USFL history. The Stars won 41 of 54 regular-season games and were 7\u20131 in the postseason. For the team's entire run, they were coached by Jim Mora (Sr), who later became a head coach in the NFL for the New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts. Mora was actually the Stars' second choice; Tannenbaum originally hired Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator George Perles, but Perles opted instead to take the open job at his alma mater, Michigan State. Carl Peterson, who later became the president/general manager/chief executive officer of the Kansas City Chiefs, served as the team's General Manager for all three seasons. Sean Landeta and Sam Mills both also had successful careers in the NFL. Landeta was one of the top punters in the NFL for two decades, and was the last former USFL player still active in the NFL at the time of his retirement in 2006. Mills had a sterling career with the Saints (alongside Mora) and the Carolina Panthers. The Panthers retired Mills' No. 51 jersey after his death from cancer in 2005. Landeta and Bart Oates were also teammates with the New York Giants. Oates signed with the Giants in 1985. Both Oates and Landeta went on to win a combined five Super Bowl rings throughout their NFL careers. Both won two rings apiece with the Giants in 1986 and 1990, while Oates earned an additional ring with the San Francisco 49ers in 1994. Oates was selected to five Pro Bowls during his career and to the UPI All-NFC team three times. He was extremely durable, starting 125 consecutive games during his Giants career. ==Single-season leaders== Rushing Yards: 1470 (1983), Kelvin Bryant, 1406 (1984), Kelvin Bryant, 1207 (1985), Kelvin Bryant Receiving Yards: 731 (1983), Scott Fitzkee, 1895 (1984), Scott Fitzkee, 882 (1985), Scott Fitzkee Passing Yards: 2718 (1983), Chuck Fusina, 3837 (1984), Chuck Fusina, 3496 (1985), Chuck Fusina Interceptions: 8 (1983), Scott Woerner, 7 (1984), Mike Lush, 10 (1985) Mike Lush Sacks: 8.5 (1983), Don Fielder, 6 (1984) George Cooper, 10 (1985) John Walker == Season-by-season results == |- style=\"text- align:center;\" | style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\" colspan=\"6\" | Philadelphia Stars |- |1983 || 15 || 3 || 0 || 1st Atlantic Division || Won Divisional Playoff (Chicago) Lost USFL Championship (Michigan) |- |1984 || 16 || 2 || 0 || 1st Atlantic Division || Won Divisional Playoff (New Jersey) Won Eastern Conference Championship (Birmingham) Won USFL Championship (Arizona) |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | style=\"background:#DC143C; color:#FDC82F;\" colspan=\"6\" | Baltimore Stars |- |1985 || 10 || 7 || 1 || 4th Eastern Conference || Won Divisional Playoff (New Jersey) Won Eastern Conference Championship (Birmingham) Won USFL Championship (Oakland) |- !Totals || 48 || 13 || 1 |colspan=\"2\"| (including playoffs) ==References== ==External links== * USFL.info \u2013 Philadelphia-Baltimore Stars *1983 USFL Championship Game *1984 USFL Championship Game *1985 USFL Championship Game Category:1982 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:1984 disestablishments in Pennsylvania Category:1985 establishments in Maryland Category:1986 disestablishments in Maryland ",
