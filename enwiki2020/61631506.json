    "text": "Cruise is the fourteenth studio album by Japanese singer Akina Nakamori. It was released on 25 July 1989 under the Warner Pioneer label. The album includes lead single Liar. It was released after Nakamori's failed suicide attempt incident. ==Background== Cruise is the final studio album released under label Warner Pioneer. The album was recorded between 3 and 4 April 1986 in New York, at recording studio The Hit Factory. The album content is similar to her previously released studio album Crismon, which has only slow and medium melodies and singing with whisper voice (with the exception of Liar, which in the chorus part she used vibrato). The title track Akai Fushigi was once used in the earlier published track list of the studio album Fushigi. It's unknown whenever the melody line is same or different during that time. Aside of domestic music writers, several oversea writers were involved in the recording such as a Brazilian singer-songwriter Osny Mello or British songwriter Nicky Wood. After the album release, Nakamori took one-year hiatus from her music activities and made her comeback in 1990 with single Dear Friend. Due to contract breach with recording label, Nakamori didn't release new studio album until 1993. ==Promotion== ===Single=== It consists only one previously released single, Liar. It includes renewed arrangement with the change of a few instrumental sections. The original version of Liar is included in the third Best compilation album series in 1992. It's Nakamori's first album in 4 years which includes at least one leading single, previous studio albums had only new recorded tracks. ==Stage performances== In Fuji TV music television program Yoru no Hit Studio, Nakamori performed Liar twice between April and May. In TBS music television program The Best Ten, she performed Liar six times between May and June. In NTV music television program Top Ten she performed it five times between May and June. On 9 July, two days before suicide attempt, she performed it in music television reward program Megapolis Kayou Matsuri. The single Liar was performed many times during her live performances between 1989 and 2003. For the first time, it was performed during special live East Live Index in April 1989, both live album and live DVD were released later.
