Lonely Planet describes it as a \"grand old hotel\" and \"another remnant of the colonial era\". In 1935 one publication described the hotel as being \"as fine a hotel as anyone would care to stop at, excepting that we do not have a private bath\".William C. Garner, \"Roads Adequate in North Africa\", La Grande Observer (June 22, 1935), p. 4. Another said in 1972, \"The grandeur of its mosque-like domed lobby, with its light blue tiles and hanging brass lanterns, may be fading somewhat in these post- colonial days of the Peoples' Democratic Republic of Algeria.\" The hotel contains a cinema. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Hotels in Algeria Category:Economy of Constantine, Algeria Category:Buildings and structures in Constantine, Algeria Category:Hotels established in 1912 Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1912 ",
