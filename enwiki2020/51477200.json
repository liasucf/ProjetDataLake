The island's name is from the Irish Inis B\u00f3 Finne, meaning \"Island of the white/fair cow\", and so it is easily confused with Inishbofin, County Galway and Inishbofin, County Donegal, which have the same Irish name. The Latin calques \u012ansula Vaccae Albae or \u012ansula Vitulae Albae are also used on occasion. The monastery was of the Canons Regular of Saint Augustine. The Topographical Dictionary of Ireland (1837) said that of Inchbofin's , there were suitable for arable use. Griffith's Valuation (mid-19th century) mentions three families on the island: Skelly, Connell and Heffernan; the island was owned by Susan Galbraith. In the 1911 census, there were 13 people living on the island, of the same 3 families. In winter 2009, the Irish Air Corps sent a helicopter to the island to deliver cattle fodder for the last farmer on the island, John Connell, after Lough Ree froze solid. He was the last permanent resident of the island and died on 12 February 2018. ===Annalistic references=== *750: Fiangalach, son of Anmchadh, son of Maelcuraich, Abbot of Inchbofin, in Lough Ree, died.
