His focus on the upper registers and the polyester tone of his five-string bass guitar will continue to annoy those who prefer to hear the bass played dark, low and woody, but there's no denying the consistent inventiveness of his playing or the charm of these compositions\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Steve Swallow. # \"Running in the Family\" - 5:10 # \"Babble On\" - 3:44 # \"Another Fine Mess\" - 6:48 # \"I Think My Wife Is a Hat\" - 5:45 # \"Bird World War\" - 3:20 # \"Bug in a Rug\" - 6:09 # \"Lost in Boston\" - 5:00 # \"Name That Tune\" - 5:39 # \"Viscous Consistency\" - 6:02 # \"Deconstructed\" - 5:30 ==Personnel== *Steve Swallow - bass guitar *Ryan Kisor - trumpet *Chris Potter - tenor saxophone *Mick Goodrick - guitar *Adam Nussbaum - drums ==References== Category:Steve Swallow albums Category:1997 albums ",
