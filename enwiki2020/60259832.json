    "text": "Joshua Michael Brain Teves (born February 18, 1995) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing for the Utica Comets in the American Hockey League (AHL) as a prospect for the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL). ==Playing career== ===Amateur=== From 2011 to 2013, Teves played for the minor hockey for the Calgary Royals. After graduating from West Island College, Teves played for the Fernie Ghostriders in the Kootenay International Junior Hockey League (KIJHL) during the 2013\u201314 season and committed to play NCAA Division 1 ice hockey at Princeton University for the Tigers men's ice hockey team. He then joined the Merritt Centennials in the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL) for the 2014\u201315 season, where he was awarded the Coach's Choice award and the Most Improved award. Teves also became the first Centennial player to be awarded the RBC National Junior A Scholarship. For the 2015\u201316 season, Teves joined the Princeton Tigers. In his freshman season, he played 31 games and recorded 7 points. His offence picked up the following season, where he led Tiger defencemen in scoring with 25 points. However, after advancing to the 2017 ECAC Hockey Men's Ice Hockey Tournament Quarterfinals, Princeton lost to Union College. At the end of the season, Teves was selected for the first-team All-Ivy League and was invited to the Calgary Flames' 2017 Development Camp. Teves returned to Princeton for his junior year, where he led all defencemen in scoring with 33 points. Princeton once again qualified for the ECAC Tournament, where they defeated Clarkson University in a 2\u20131 overtime win to clinch an NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament spot for the first time since 2009. Teves was named to the All-ECAC Hockey third-team, becoming the first Tigers defenceman since 2012 to win the honour, and again selected as a first-team All-Ivy League. However, the Tigers lost 4\u20132 against the Ohio State University in the first round. In his senior year, Teves was named to the ECAC Hockey Pre-Season All- League Team and selected as team captain. That season, Teves led the team's defencemen in scoring as Princeton qualified for the 2019 ECAC Hockey Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. He was also nominated for the Hockey Humanitarian Award for his community service work and named a finalist for the 2018\u201319 Senior CLASS Award. However, Princeton was swept by Brown University in the first round, effectively ending Teves' collegiate career. On March 18, 2019, Teves was again selected for the All-ECAC Hockey third-team. ===Professional=== On March 12, 2019, as an undrafted NHL free agent, Teves signed a one-year contract with the Vancouver Canucks. He made his NHL debut on March 26 in Vancouver's 5\u20134 loss to the Anaheim Ducks. ==Personal life== Teves was born to Armando Teves, a teacher, and Phillippa Brain-Teves, a professor, on February 18, 1995; he has two siblings. Teves attended school in Calgary at West Island College. ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| ! rowspan=\"97\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| ! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season ! rowspan=\"97\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| ! colspan=\"5\"|Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
