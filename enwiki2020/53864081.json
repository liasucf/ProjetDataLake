Xanadu Records Listing, accessed April 24, 2017Jazzlists: Xanadu Records discography accessed April 24, 2017Xanadu in Africa catalog accessed April 24, 2017 == Reception == The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow stated \"Despite the exotic location, this LP contains a typical Xanadu high-quality bebop date. The quintet performs five standards in Senegal (this may very well be the first live recording of American jazz musicians in Africa) and the crowd is rightfully enthusiastic. Even if the music contains few surprises, this album is easily recommended to bop collectors\". == Track listing == # \"All or Nothing at All\" (Arthur Altman, Jack Lawrence) \u2013 12:22 # \"Robbins Nest\" (Illinois Jacquet, Sir Charles Thompson) \u2013 10:40 # \"I Surrender Dear\" (Harry Barris, Gordon Clifford) \u2013 8:50 # \"Blues in the Closet\" (Oscar Pettiford) \u2013 4:52 # \"Easy Living\" (Ralph Rainger, Leo Robin) \u2013 9:25 == Personnel == *Al Cohn, Billy Mitchell \u2013 tenor saxophone *Dolo Coker \u2013 piano *Leroy Vinnegar \u2013 bass *Frank Butler \u2013 drums == References == Category:1981 live albums Category:Xanadu Records live albums Category:Billy Mitchell (jazz musician) live albums Category:Al Cohn live albums Category:Dolo Coker live albums Category:Albums produced by Don Schlitten ",
