Initially there were no formal standards for which stations could make broadcasts intended for the general public, and after World War One stations under a variety of license classes, most commonly Amateur amd Experimental, began making regularly scheduled programs on a limited basis. In the Washington, D.C. area a number of U.S. government- operated stations also experimented with broadcasting technology. The Navy's high-powered NAA in Arlington, Virginia began making time signal broadcasts (in Morse Code) beginning in 1913.\"Flashing Time Over the Ocean\", Popular Electricity and the World's Advance, October 1913, p. 712. The Bureau of Standards was particularly active, and in May 1920 its Radio Laboratory station, WWV, was reported to be conducting weekly Friday evening concerts.\"13 The Transmission of Music by Radio\" by S. W. Stratton, Technical News Bulletin no. 38, Bureau of Standards, June 4, 1920, pages 8-9. In late 1920 a second Navy station, NOF, located in the Anacostia section of Washington, began to include music with its test transmissions, and on January 7, 1921 a live concert was heard as far away as Canada and Cuba.\"Radio Concert in Anacostia Heard At Thousand Receiving Stations, Including Some in Canada and Cuba\", Washington Herald, January 8, 1921, page 1. The Post Office Department was also involved, and on April 15, 1921 its WWX was one of four stations that began broadcasting daily market news reports.\"Radio Market News Service\", QST, July 1921, page 24. At least three Washington, D.C. companies made early broadcasts while operating under amateur station authorizations. The Continental Electric Company\"Times Is First On Street With Series' Details\", Washington Times, October 6, 1921, page 2. later claimed that its station, 3SV,\"Third District\", Amateur Stations of the United States (June 30, 1922 edition), page 117. The \"3\" in 3SV's call sign indicated that the station was located in the third Radio Inspection district. The fact that the first letter, \"S\", fell in the range A-W meant that the station was operating under a standard Amateur license. had been the first.\"Radio Gossip and News: History of WIL\", Washington Sunday Star, April 8, 1923, Part 1, page 41. The White & Boyer Co., operators of amateur station 3NR,\"Third District\", Amateur Radio Stations of the United States (June 30, 1921 edition), page 91. ran an advertisement on December 3, 1921 which stated that \"We transmit music from our own station on Tuesday and Friday evenings of each week from 7:30 to 9:45.\"White & Boyer Company (advertisement), Washington Evening Star, December 3, 1921, page 12. (Continental later operated broadcast station WIL from 1922-1924, while White & Boyer operated WJH from December 1921 to March 1924). Radio Construction & Electric Co. advertisement (December 1921)Radio Construction & Electric Co. (\"Special Notices\" classified advertisement), Washington Evening Star, December 18, 1921, page 3. The Radio Construction Company, located at 542 Irving Street, N.W., also made early broadcasts over a standard amateur station, 3BAX,\"Third District\", Amateur Radio Stations of the United States, (June 30, 1921 edition), page 85. and the June 1, 1921 issue of the Washington Herald reported that \"Station 3BAX, manned by W. G. Eldridge has just begun to send out concerts every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday evenings, beginning at 7:30 o'clock.\"\"Scientific Notes and Comments: Aerial Concerts via Radio Nightly\", Washington Herald, June 1, 1921, page 6. Responding to growing broadcasting activity on a national scale, the Department of Commerce adopted regulations effective December 1, 1921 to formally establish a broadcast service category, which set aside the wavelength of 360 meters (833 kHz) for \"entertainment\" broadcasting, and 485 meters (619 kHz) for \"market and weather reports\".\"Amendments to Regulations\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. Under this new regulation, WDW's first, and only, broadcasting station license was issued on December 22, 1921 to the Radio Construction & Electric Co. for a thirty-day period, for operation on the 360 meter \"entertainment\" wavelength.\"New Stations\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 3. Limited Commercial license, serial #262, issued December 22, 1921 to the Radio Construction & Electric Co. for a 30-day period However, WDW's broadcasting career, if any, was extremely brief. The station's one month initial operating license was never renewed, and WDW was formally deleted in May 1922.\"Alterations and Corrections\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 1, 1922, page 9. There is very limited additional information about the Radio Construction & Electric Co. For a couple years beginning in the summer of 1921 the company also held an Experimental station license, 3XZ.\"New Stations: Special Land Stations\", Radio Service Bulletin, August 1, 1921, page 3. The \"X\" in 3XZ's call sign indicated that it was operating under an Experimental license. A local listener reported hearing 3XZ in the summer of 1922,\"Questions and Answers: Receiver\u2014Limitations\", Washington Evening Star, July 12, 1922, page 8. but the station was deleted in mid-1923.\"Strike Out All Particulars\", Radio Service Bulletin, July 2, 1923, page 16. In April 1923 a classified advertisement listed the company's address as the location of a \"great sacrifice sale of all radio apparatus\" that \"must be sold on account of removal to new quarters\".\"Special Notices: Radio\", Washington Evening Star, April 21, 1923, page 3. ==References== DW Category:Radio stations established in 1921 Category:1921 establishments in Washington, D.C.
