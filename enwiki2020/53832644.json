Although its licensed in Ocala, the station serves the Jacksonville, Florida area and identifies itself as a Jacksonville-based station. The station is owned by DTV America Corporation, which also owns WKBJ-LD of Live Oak. That company is based in Sunrise, in Broward County, Florida. WRCZ's digital signal is transmitted over UHF channel 35. The station's transmission tower is located in the Brackridge neighborhood of Jacksonville's southeastern suburbs just off Florida State Road 115. ==History== While licensed to Ocala, Florida, the station's construction permit was issued under the callsign of W35CZ-D on February 11, 2011. The current WRCZ-LD calls were adapted on February 17, 2016. In February 2016, DTV America Corporation, the station's owner, decided to relocate the station to the Jacksonville market before putting it on the air on June 23, 2016. This made the station DTV America's fifth television station to sign on in the state of Florida, and the organization's second station in the Jacksonville market as DTV America already signed Buzzr-affiliated, Live Oak-licensed WKBJ-LD on the air in that market. In April 2017, Cheddar news TV channel started broadcasting over the air with DTV America affiliating five stations including WRCZ-LD with the network. Dunkin' Donuts, a Cheddar advertiser, was handing out free digital antennas at events in the stations' markets to publicize the over the air launch. ==Digital channels== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
