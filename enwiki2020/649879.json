It is the oldest and one of the largest universities in Russia. Founded in 1724 by a decree of Peter the Great, the University from the very beginning has had a strong focus on fundamental research in science, engineering and humanities. It is made up of 24 specialized faculties and institutes, the Academic Gymnasium, the Medical College, the College of Physical culture and Sports, Economics and Technology. The university has two primary campuses: one on Vasilievsky Island and the other in Peterhof. During the Soviet period, it was known as Leningrad State University (). It was named after Andrei Zhdanov in 1948. ==Reputation and international rankings== Saint Petersburg State University is the second best multi-faculty university in Russia after Moscow State University. In international rankings, the university was ranked 240th in 2013/2014, by the QS World University Rankings, it was placed 351\u2013400th by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and 301\u2013400th by the Academic Ranking of World Universities outperforming the rest of universities in Russia excluding Moscow State University. The university has a reputation for having educated the majority of Russia's political elite, including presidents Vladimir Putin and Dimitry Medvedev, both of whom studied Law at the university. The university is Russia's oldest university, founded in 1724 by Peter the Great, which predates the foundation of Moscow State University in 1755. Saint Petersburg state university is included in all ratings and lists of the best universities in the world and is one of the leaders in all indicators in Russia. The university was the first from Russian universities to join The Coimbra Group (CG), and it now represents Russia. ==History== ===1724\u20131821=== {|class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size: 90%; width: 25%;\" ! style=\"background:#ccf;\"| Timeline |- | * January 24, 1724: Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences created on January 24, 1724 by a decree of Peter the Great. * 1803\u20131819: Saint Petersburg University officially did not exist, as the Saint Petersburg Academy had already been disbanded, because the new 1803 charter of the Academy of Sciences stipulated that there should be no educational institutions affiliated with it. * 1804: Petersburg Pedagogical Institute was established. * 1814: Petersburg Pedagogical Institute renamed the Main Pedagogical Institute. * February 8, 1819: Alexander I of Russia reorganized the Main Pedagogical Institute into Saint Petersburg University. * 1821: Saint Petersburg University was renamed Saint Petersburg Imperial University. * 1914: With the start of the First World War, the university was renamed Petrograd Imperial University. * 1918: The university was renamed Petrograd State University. * 1924: The university was renamed Leningrad State University after Saint-Petersburg had been renamed in Leningrad on memory of Vladimir Lenin. * 1948: Leningrad State University named after Andrei Zhdanov * 1991: The university was renamed back to Saint-Petersburg State University after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. |} Hallway in the Twelve Collegia building, St. Petersburg State University: one of the longest academic hallways in the world It is disputed by the university administration whether Saint Petersburg State University or Moscow State University is the oldest higher education institution in Russia. While the latter was established in 1755, the former, which has been in continuous operation since 1819, claims to be the successor of the university established along with the Academic Gymnasium and the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences on January 24, 1724, by a decree of Peter the Great. Between 1804 and 1819, Saint Petersburg University officially did not exist; the institution founded by Peter the Great, the Saint Petersburg Academy, had been disbanded, because the new 1803 charter of the Academy of Sciences stipulated that there should be no educational institutions affiliated with it. The Petersburg Pedagogical Institute, renamed the Main Pedagogical Institute in 1814, was established in 1804 and occupied a part of the Twelve Collegia building. On February 8, 1819 (O.S.), Alexander I of Russia reorganized the Main Pedagogical Institute into Saint Petersburg University, which at that time consisted of three faculties: Faculty of Philosophy and Law, Faculty of History and Philology and Faculty of Physics and Mathematics. The Main Pedagogical Institute (where Dmitri Mendeleev studied) was restored in 1828 as an educational institution independent of Saint Petersburg University, and trained teachers until it was finally closed in 1859. ===1821\u20131917=== In 1821, the university was renamed Saint Petersburg Imperial University. In 1823, most of the university moved from the Twelve Collegia to the southern part of the city beyond the Fontanka. In 1824, a modified version of the charter of Moscow University was adopted as the first charter of the Saint Petersburg Imperial University. In 1829, there were 19 full professors and 169 full-time and part-time students at the university. In 1830, Tsar Nicholas returned the entire building of the Twelve Collegia to the university, and courses resumed there. In 1835, a new Charter of the Imperial Universities of Russia was approved. It provided for the establishment of the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of History and Philology, and the Faculties of Physics and Mathematics, which were merged into the Faculty of Philosophy as the 1st and 2nd Departments, respectively. In 1849, after the Spring of Nations, the Senate of the Russian Empire decreed the Rector should be appointed by the Minister of National Enlightenment rather than elected by the Assembly of the university. However, Pyotr Pletnyov was reappointed Rector and ultimately became the longest-serving rector of Saint Petersburg University (1840\u20131861). The Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics in Peterhof Botanical garden of the University In 1855, Oriental studies were separated from the Faculty of History and Philology, and the fourth faculty, Faculty of Oriental Languages, was formally inaugurated on August 27, 1855. In 1859\u20131861, female part-time students could attend lectures in the university. In 1861, there were 1,270 full-time and 167 part-time students in the university, of them 498 were in the Faculty of Law, the largest subdivision. But this subdivision had the cameral studies department, where students learnt safety, occupational health and environmental engineering management and science, including chemistry, biology, agronomy along with law and philosophy. Many Russian, Georgian etc. managers, engineers and scientists studied at the Faculty of law therefore. During 1861\u20131862, there was student unrest in the university, and it was temporarily closed twice during the year. The students were denied freedom of assembly and placed under police surveillance, and public lectures were forbidden. Many students were expelled. After the unrest, in 1865, only 524 students remained. A decree of the Emperor Alexander II of Russia adopted on February 18, 1863, restored the right of the university assembly to elect the rector. It also formed the new faculty of the theory and history of art as part of the faculty of history and philology. In March 1869, student unrest shook the university again but on a smaller scale. By 1869, 2,588 students had graduated from the university. In 1880, the Ministry of National Enlightenment forbade students to marry and married persons could not be admitted. In 1882, another student unrest took place in the university. In 1884, a new Charter of the Imperial Russian Universities was adopted, which granted the right to appoint the rector to the Minister of National Enlightenment again. On March 1, 1887 (O.S.), a group of the university students was arrested while planning an attempt on the life of Alexander III of Russia. As a result, new admission rules to gymnasiums and universities were approved by the Minister of National Enlightenment Ivan Delyanov in 1887, which barred persons of non-noble origin from admission to the university, unless they were extraordinarily talented. By 1894, 9,212 students had graduated from the university. Among the renowned scholars of the second half of the 19th century, affiliated with the university were mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev, physicist Heinrich Lenz, chemists Dmitri Mendeleev and Aleksandr Butlerov, embryologist Alexander Kovalevsky, physiologist Ivan Sechenov and pedologist Vasily Dokuchaev. On March 24, 1896 (O.S.), on the campus of the university, Alexander Popov publicly demonstrated transmission of radio waves for the first time in history. As of January 1, 1900 (O.S.), there were 2,099 students enrolled in the Faculty of Law, 1,149 students in the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, 212 students in the Faculty of Oriental Languages and 171 students in the Faculty of History and Philology. In 1902, the first student dining hall in Russia was opened in the university. Since about 1897, regular strikes and student unrest shook the university and spread to other institutions of higher education across Russia. During the Revolution of 1905, the charter of the Russian universities was amended once more; the autonomy of the universities was partially restored and the right to elect the rector was returned to the academic board for the first time since 1884. In 1905\u20131906, the university was temporarily closed due to student unrest. Its autonomy was revoked again in 1911. In the same year, the university was once again temporarily closed. In 1914, with the start of the First World War, the university was renamed Petrograd Imperial University after its namesake city. During the War, the university was the important center of mobilization of Russian intellectual resources and scholarship for the victory.Rostovcev E.A. The Capital University in a Time of War. Saint Petersburg/Petrograd 1914-1917 // Kollegen \u2013 Kommilitonen \u2013 K\u00e4mpfer. Europ\u00e4ische Universit\u00e4ten im Ersten Weltkrieg / Hrsg. Von T. Maurer. Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 2006. S. 177\u2013188. In 1915, a branch of the university was opened in Perm, which later became Perm State University. ===1918\u2013present=== The Assembly of Petrograd Imperial University openly welcomed the February Revolution of 1917, which put an end to the Russian monarchy, and the university came to be known as Petrograd University. However, after the October Revolution of 1917, the university's staff and administration were initially vocally opposed to the Bolshevik takeover of power and reluctant to cooperate with the Narkompros. Later in 1917\u20131922, during the Russian Civil War, some of the staff suspected of counter-revolutionary sympathies suffered imprisonment (e.g., Lev Shcherba in 1919), execution, or exile abroad on the so-called Philosophers' ships in 1922 (e.g., Nikolai Lossky). Furthermore, the entire staff suffered from hunger and extreme poverty during those years. In 1918, the university was renamed 1st Petrograd State University, and in 1919, the Narkompros merged it with the 2nd PSU (former Psychoneurological Institute) and 3rd PSU (former Bestuzhev Higher Courses for Women) into Petrograd State University. In 1919, the Faculty of Social Science was established by the Narkompros instead of the Faculty of History and Philology, Faculty of Oriental Languages and Faculty of Law. Nicholas Marr became the first Dean of the new faculty. Chemist Alexey Favorsky became the Dean of the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics. Rabfaks and free university courses were opened on the basis of the university to provide mass education. In the fall of 1920, as observed by freshman student Alice Rosenbaum, enrollment was open and the majority of the students were anti-communist including, until removed, a few vocal opponents of the regime. Seeing they were educating \"class enemies\", a purge was conducted in 1922 based on the class background of the students, and all students, other than seniors, with a bourgeois background were expelled.Branden, Barbara (1986) The Passion of Ayn Rand. Garden City: Doubleday, hardcover, 442 pages, ; pp. 42\u201343; 50\u201351 In 1924, the university was renamed Leningrad State University after its namesake city. In order to suppress intellectual opposition to Soviet power, a number of historians working in the university, including Sergey Platonov, Yevgeny Tarle and Boris Grekov, were imprisoned in the so- called Academic Affair of 1929\u20131930 on fabricated charges of participating in a counter-revolutionary conspiracy aimed at overthrowing the government. Some other members of the staff were repressed in 1937\u20131938 during the Great Purge. During the 1941\u20131944 Siege of Leningrad in World War II, many of the students and staff died from starvation, in battles or from repressions. However, the university operated continuously, and evacuated to Saratov in 1942\u20131944. A branch of the university was hosted in Yelabuga during the war. In 1944, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union awarded the university with the Order of Lenin on the occasion of its 125th anniversary and for its contribution to science and culture. In 1948, the Council of Ministers named the university after Andrei Zhdanov, a recently deceased prominent communist official. This decision was revoked in 1989 during Perestroika. In 1949\u20131950, several professors died in prison during the investigation of the Leningrad Affair fabricated by the central Soviet leadership, and the Minister of Education of the RSFSR, former rector Alexander Voznesensky, was executed. In 1966, the Council of Ministers decided to build a new suburban campus in Petrodvorets for most of the mathematics and natural science faculties. The relocation of the faculties had been completed by the 1990s. In 1969, the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Soviet Union awarded the university with the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. In 1991, the university was renamed back to Saint Petersburg State University after its namesake city. ==Science & Research at SPbU== Research development is a top priority of St Petersburg University mapping out its further growth. It is based on the SPbU Strategic Plan 2020 aimed, among other things, at comprehensive development of research, expert activity and innovation. This task is solved through the following activities: * development of academic mobility programmes, intern exchange and invitation of emerging researchers from other Russian and non- Russian organisations to St Petersburg University; * creation of a system of planning and support of scientific and innovative activities; * development and implementation of various approaches to making the research topics in fundamental and applied science timely and currently important; * development of innovative activities; * expansion of national and international cooperation in scientific activity; * development of the University's expert community; * expansion of expert and consulting activity. The priority areas of research include: * nanotechnology and materials science; * biomedicine and human health; * information systems and technology; * ecology and sustainable use of natural resources; * social research and technologies; * human resource management and technologies. ===SPbU's scientific infrastructure=== The SPbU Research Park unites teams from the resource centres acting within the framework of the main areas of the SPbU Strategic Plan. The users' tasks can be solved at several resource centres, either simultaneously or consecutively, as well as on a cross-disciplinary basis at one centre. The SPbU Research Park operates according to the principle of equal access. This means the resource centres are open to any interested persons provided that common regulations are observed. Research Park: * 26 resource centres * premises > 30,000 m2 * equipment \u2014 7,5 bln roubles St Petersburg University Research Library is one of the oldest and largest university libraries in Russia with a main collection dating back to 1783. The Library today The M. Gorky Scientific Library collection was founded over 230 years ago at St Petersburg University, which is the oldest university in Russia. Today, the Library is a large modern information centre with access to world scientific information. The central stacks of the Library are situated in the main building of St Petersburg University, the Twelve Collegiums. This is a monument of 18th century St Petersburg architecture constructed by Domenico Trezzini. The Library was accommodated in this building in 1891. The Library print collection runs to 6.8 million copies and almost 2 million titles. It is divided between a basic scientific collection and subject libraries of the University departments. The Library includes the Central Research Library and 21 subject libraries. It has 40 thousand current users, 30 thousand of them are students. Historical reference The M. Gorky Scientific Library of St Petersburg University is one of the oldest and largest university libraries in Russia. It also serves as a monument to national enlightenment, science and culture. By the richness and variety of its collection it ranks among the most prominent libraries of the world. The basic collection dates back to 1783, when Empress Catherine the Great presented the First Teachers Seminary with 1100 volumes from one of the private collections. Private donations have been supporting the Library throughout its whole history. Over 200 private collections of university professors and outstanding promoters of Russia science and culture are kept here. The collection of books acquired by the Library in the middle of the 19th century is most certainly of great historical and documentary importance. It includes books from: the collection of the Petersburg Censorship Committee (20 thousand books); the Committee of Foreign Censorship (about 10 thousand books); the archive and the library of the Liberal Society of Russian Philologists; and the library of the Bestuzhev Higher Courses for Women, which was the first higher education establishment for women in Russia. The collection of rarities which numbers 100 thousand books includes a collection of 15th to 20th century editions as well as incunabula, palaeotypes and books in old Cyrillic script. The collection of Oriental manuscripts (about 50 thousand manuscripts) kept in the Oriental Department of the Library is unique. Research Library named after M. Gorky: * over 7 mln print publications and manuscripts * more than 40,000 rare manuscripts and 67,000 rare books * 2.7 mln e-catalogue entries * 82 mln electronic full-text sources * about 600 000 titles of books and over 84,000 titles of journals accessible via digital subscription ===SPbU Megagrants=== One of SPbU's most important tasks is implementation of its own research support programmes. In 2013 and 2014, megagrant competitions were organised at SPbU, that resulting in the creation of 9 research laboratories headed by leading scholars from Russia and other countries. Laboratories established within the framework of the Megagrant Programme: * Laboratory \"Center for Bioinformatics and Algorithmic Biotechnology\" headed by Pavel Arkadyevich Pevzner * Laboratory of Electronic and Spin Structure of Nanosystems headed by Evgeny Vladimirovich Chulkov * Laboratory \"Transnationalism and Migration Processes: Comparative and Institutional Analysis\" headed by Peter Kivisto * Laboratory \"Economic Performance and the Environment\" headed by Frederick van der Ploeg * Laboratory \"Internationalisation of Politically Connected Firms from Emerging Markets\" headed by Lilac Nachum * Laboratory \"Catalysis by Transition Metal Clusters: Synthesis of Biologically Active Molecules and Pharmaceutical Building Blocks with Atomistic Precision \" headed by Valentin Pavlovich Ananikov * Research Laboratory for Analysis and Modeling of Social Processes. Political Islam / Islamism: Theory and Practice in Comparative and Historical Perspective headed by Alexander Dmitrievich Knysh * Biomolecular NMR Laboratory at SPbU: Protein Structure, Dynamics, Function, and Role in Human Disease headed by Nikolai Ruslanovich Skrynnikov * Laboratory of Amyloid Biology headed by Yury Olegovich Chernoff ===Scientific staff=== The outstanding academic staff is a most valuable resource of the University. In keeping with the best traditions of the Russian education, our academics maintain, reinforce and enhance the scientific potential, develop and apply up-to-date educational technologies and create the required material assets. Research and teaching staff: * doctors of science \u2014 more than 1,400 employees * candidates of science \u2014 more than 3,000 employees * PhD \u2014 51 employees * academicians of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian Academy of Education \u2014 19 employees * corresponding members of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Russian Academy of Education \u2014 27 employees The successful implementation of SPbU science development strategy is evidenced by a broader range of applied research, a growing number of international scholars working at SPbU laboratories as well as by joint projects launched in cooperation with research groups from non-Russian academic centres. SPbU employees have their works published in top-rated journals and annually participate in most important international scientific conferences. In 2016 SPbU became the only Russian institution listed in the Nature Index 2016 Rising Stars, a prestigious scientific ranking (the Top 100 Institutions nomination). ==International Cooperation== St Petersburg University is truly global. In 2019-2020, it became home to 3875 international students from 103 countries following degree and non-degree studies. That means, every 7th student is international. According to Rossotrudnichestvo, in 2019 SPbU was named the most popular university in Russia among foreign applicants. In 2020, the University is in even greater demand from applicants from abroad than before. Out of 12,000 applications from foreigners to the universities of St Petersburg, 5,000 were submitted to St Petersburg University. Thus, almost every second international applicant applied to St Petersburg University. The University makes it easy to connect with the whole world by offering the opportunity to participate in Alumni Clubs in 16 countries and Representative offices in China, Republic of Korea, Spain, USA, with Italy and Turkey shortly on the way. Students coming from abroad are attracted by SPbU exceptional educational standards, an opportunity to study in Russian, English as well as other foreign languages, global research and career prospects. Spending student years in the cultural capital of Russia, which received the title of \u201cEurope's Leading City Destination\u201d in World Travel Awards 2019, is also seen as a great advantage. === Getting involved === There is a number of integration programmes offered by the University to help international students feel safe and fully included into the social and cultural life. Introduction week, International Students Club, language tandems, creative and sports associations, ESN events, buddy-programme are just a few of the opportunities to get engaged. ===Partner universities=== SPbU has 485 partner universities in 80 countries ranging from China, Germany, USA, France, Finland, Japan to the Republic of Korea, and Brazil. More than 25 international summer and winter schools are held at SPbU annually. SPbU is a member of a number of international associations and student exchange programmes: Erasmus Mundus, Erasmus+, Finnish-Russian Cross Border University, Finnish-Russian Student Exchange Program, Santander Universities, TEMPUS, and many others.
