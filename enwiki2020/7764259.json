Northfield shares an indefinite northern boundary with the rest of Litchfield proper, this boundary is roughly co- terminus with that of the Northfield Fire District.

It is the home of the former Northfield Knife Company, which was founded in 1858 and ceased operations in 1926. The factory resided directly across the street from what is known as Knife Shop Dam. The foundations of the original knife factory still remain, and were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Both Northfield Pond and the Knife Shop Dam are part of Humaston Brook State Park. This undeveloped 141 acre state park provides visitors with both hiking and fishing opportunities. == Notable Residents == * J. Howard Catlin, who in partner with his brother Franklin built the Northfield Knife Company into one of the most popular knife makers in the world. * Albert M. Turner, who was the first secretary of the Connecticut Park and Forest Commission, serving in that capacity from 1914 to 1941. He directed the initial acquisition and development program for state parks and forests, establishing the framework of the system as it is known today. Of particular significance were his untiring efforts to secure and develop three shoreline state parks, Sherwood Island, Hammonasset, and Rocky Neck. * William L. Gilbert, one of the foremost clockmakers of 19th-century Connecticut and a Northfield native. == Northfield Center == The village of Northfield has its own Postal Zip Code, 06778, but has no operating Post Office.
