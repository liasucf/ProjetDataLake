    "text": "M\u00edrmans saga is a medieval Icelandic Chivalric saga, likely to have been composed in the 14th century. It belongs to an Old Norse epic cycle consisting of more than 20 sagas and together with Sigu\u00f0rar saga \u00fe\u00f6gla and Fl\u00f3vents saga to a smaller cycle related to the Christianisation of Scandinavia. According to Marianne E. Kalinke and P. M. Mitchell, this concern with the conversion to Christianity is uncommon for Icelandic Chivalric sagas. Therefore, the attribution to the original Riddaras\u00f6gur is seen as controversial among philologists, as the main topic rather suggests an allocation to the translated Riddaras\u00f6gur. == Plot == > M\u00edrman kills his heathen father, Earl Hermann of Saxland. M\u00edrman's mother > avenges her husband by giving M\u00edrman a philtre that makes him a leper. > M\u00edrman journes to Sicily to be healed by Cecilia, daughter of the king. He > is cured and marries her, and subsequently M\u00edrman journeys to Frakkland to > visit his foster-father, King Hl\u00f6\u00f0ver whose queen makes M\u00edrman forget > Cecilia and, after the death of Hl\u00f6\u00f0ver, to marry her. Cecilia disguises > herself as Earl Hiringr, joins M\u00edrman's enemies, vanquishes her husband in > combat-at-arms and leads him away captive. After their reconciliation, > M\u00edrman becomes King of Sicily. According to Astrid von Nahl, the plot is divided into two parts: the first one concerning the \u2013 for the translated Riddaras\u00f6gur typical \u2013 problems of heathenism and Christianity. The second part, however, deals with the typical topics of the original Riddaras\u00f6gur: a fraudulent mother, love and betrayal! == Structure == Astrid von Nahl proposes that M\u00edrman's saga shows some striking structural similarities with Karlamagn\u00fas saga. Both deal with a Christian king's efforts to Christianize a heathen country or the attacks on a Christian by heathens. == Manuscripts and dating == A stemma of M\u00edrmanns saga, visualised from Slay, Desmond (ed.). 1997. M\u00edrmanns saga. Editiones Arnamagn\u00e6an\u00e6, Series A, 17. Copenhagen: Reitzel. There are at least 32 manuscripts of M\u00edrman's saga. After M\u00edrman's fight with B\u0153ring, the Cod. Holm. is missing a whole quire. Dr. Eugen K\u00f6lbing supposes that the script in Cod. A. M. is undoubtedly a transcript of the former, as it was written by the same person. It only misses half a page and together with other transcripts of the Cod. Holm. there is a high probability of having preserved the whole saga. Astrid von Nahl suggestion that M\u00edrman's saga may be a conglomerate is based on the different nature of the two parts: the first one based on a lost, earlier text and a second one composed later and resembling the original Riddaras\u00f6gur. The dating of M\u00edrman's saga is difficult. In the beginning of the saga, a pope Clemens is mentioned, who is supposed to have been one of the first Bishops of Rome. Due to the bad condition of the manuscript, a precise dating unfortunately is impossible. == Sources == Unfortunately, the original source of M\u00edrman's saga is unclear. Dr. Eugen K\u00f6lbing and G\u00edsli Brynj\u00falfsson, however, believed that - on the basis of the names - the original script is likely to have been written in Latin. ==Editions and translations== * Slay, Desmond (ed.), _M\u00edrmanns saga_ , Editiones Arnamagn\u00e6an\u00e6, Series A, 17 (Copenhagen: Reitzel, 1997) * Ralph O'Connor (trans.), Icelandic Histories and Romances (Stroud Tempus, 2002) == References == Category:Chivalric sagas Category:Old Norse literature ",
