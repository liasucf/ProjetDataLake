    "text": "Jean Cavaill\u00e8s (; ; May 15, 1903 \u2013 April 4, 1944) was a French philosopher and logician who specialized in philosophy of mathematics and philosophy of science. He took part in the French Resistance within the Lib\u00e9ration movement and was arrested by the Gestapo on February 17, 1944 and shot on April 4, 1944. ==Early life and education== Cavaill\u00e8s was born in Saint-Maixent, Deux- S\u00e8vres. After passing his first baccalaur\u00e9at in 1919 and baccalaur\u00e9ats in mathematics and philosophy the following year, he studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Louis- le-Grand, including two years of :fr:classes pr\u00e9paratoires, before entering the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in 1923, reading philosophy. In 1927 he successfully passed the agr\u00e9gation competitive exam. He began graduate studies in Philosophy in 1928 under the supervision of L\u00e9on Brunschvicg. Cavaill\u00e8s won a Rockefeller Foundation scholarship in 1929-1930. In 1931 he travelled extensively in Germany; in G\u00f6ttingen he conceived, jointly with Emmy Noether, the project of publishing the Cantor--Dedekind correspondence. He was a teaching assistant at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure between 1929 and 1935, then teacher at the Lyc\u00e9e d'Amiens (now :fr:Lyc\u00e9e_Louis-Thuillier) in 1936. In 1937, he successfully defended his doctoral thesesM\u00e9thode axiomatique et formalisme (th\u00e8se principale) and Remarques sur la formation de la th\u00e9orie abstraite des ensembles (th\u00e8se compl\u00e9mentaire) under the direction of L\u00e9on Brunschvicg. at the University of Paris and became a Doctor of Letters in Philosophy. He was then appointed ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences in Logic and in General Philosophy at the University of Strasbourg. ==World War II== After the outbreaks of World War II, he was mobilized in 1939 as an infantry lieutenant with the 43rd Regiment, and was later attached to the Staff of the 4th Colonial Division. He was honoured for bravery twice, and was captured on June 11, 1940. At the end of July 1940 he escaped from Belgium and fled to Clermont-Ferrand, where the university of Strasbourg was re-organized. At the end of December 1940, he met Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie, with whom he created a small group of resistance fighters, known as \"the Last Column\". To reach a broader audience, it was decided to create a newspaper, which was to become Lib\u00e9ration, the mouthpiece of both Lib\u00e9ration-Sud and Lib\u00e9ration-Nord. Cavaill\u00e8s took an active part in editing the paper. The first edition appeared in July 1941. He was appointed professor at the Sorbonne in 1941, and left Clermont-Ferrand for Paris, where he helped form the Lib\u00e9ration-Nord resistance group, becoming part of its management committee. In April 1942, at the instigation of Christian Pineau, the central Office of Information and Action (BCRA) of London charged him with the task of forming an intelligence network in the Northern Zone, known as \"Cohors\". He was ordered by Christian Pineau to pass into the Southern Zone, and Cavaill\u00e8s headed the network and formed similar groups in Belgium and the north of France. In Narbonne he was arrested with Pineau by the French police in September 1942. After a failed attempt at escaping to London, he was interned in Montpellier at the Saint- Paul d' Eyjeaux prison camp from where he escaped at the end of December 1942. The book Cavaill\u00e8s wrote in prison in Montpellier in 1942 was published posthumously in 1946, edited by the epistemologist Georges Canguilhem and the mathematician Charles Ehresmann under the title Sur la logique et la theorie de la science. Denounced as a public enemy by the Vichy regime, and sought by the police, he fled clandestinely to London in February 1943. There he met General Charles de Gaulle on several occasions. Back in France on April 15 he resigned from the management Committee of the Lib\u00e9ration movement in order to dedicate himself entirely to direct action. He was in charge of the sabotage of the stores of the Kriegsmarine in Brittany and German radio installations on the coast. Betrayed by one of his liaison officers, he was arrested on August 28, 1943 in Paris with his sister and her brother-in-law. Tortured, imprisoned in Fresnes then in Compi\u00e8gne, he was transferred to the Citadel from Arras and was arrested on February 17, 1944. This date was chosen for his death until 2015 when it appeared that he was shot on April 4Laurent Thiery, cited in Bernard Pudal, \u00ab CAVAILL\u00c8S Jean \u00bb, in Les Fusill\u00e9s (1940-1944) , \u00c9ditions de l'Atelier, Ivry-sur-Seine, 2015 .. Buried in Arras under a wooden cross marked \"unknown n\u00b05\", his body was exhumed in 1946 to be buried in the Crypt in the Sorbonne, in Paris. ==Legacy== The Centre Cavaill\u00e8s de l'\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure was established in Paris in 1969, at 3e \u00e9tage au 29 rue d'Ulm, as Centre for the Study of the History and Philosophy of Science. At the formal opening, philosopher Georges Canguilhem said, \"A philosopher- mathematician loaded with explosives, lucid and reckless, resolute without optimism. If that's not a hero, what is a hero?\" (Translated from the original French language: \"Un philosophe math\u00e9maticien bourr\u00e9 d'explosifs, un lucide t\u00e9m\u00e9raire, un r\u00e9solu sans optimisme. Si ce n'est pas un h\u00e9ros, qu'est-ce qu'un h\u00e9ros?)Georges Canguihem, Vie et mort de Jean Cavaill\u00e8s, Paris: \u00c9ditions Allia, 2004, p. 35. Cavaill\u00e8s is honored in the Heroes of the Resistance postage stamp set. In L'Arm\u00e9e des ombres, a 1969 film directed by Jean-Pierre Melville, the character of Luc Jardie (the Chief) was in part inspired by Cavaill\u00e8s. Jardie's chief operative, recuperating from injuries in a hideaway, has only five books; the title of each is a publication of Cavaill\u00e8s, though the author is shown as \"Luc Jardie.\" ===Military honours=== * Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur * Compagnon de la Lib\u00e9ration \u2013 decree of 20 November 1944 * Croix de guerre 39/45 * M\u00e9daille de la R\u00e9sistance * Officier de l'Ordre de la Couronne de Belgique (avec palme) * M\u00e9daille de la R\u00e9sistance (Belgique) ==Works== * Sur la deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9finition des ensemble finis donn\u00e9e par Dedekind [On the second definition of finite sets given by Dedekind], Fundamenta Mathematicae, XIX, 1932, pp. 143-148. * L'\u00e9cole de Vienne au Congr\u00e8s de Prague, Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale, XLII, 1935, pp. 137\u2013149. * Briefwechsel Cantor-Dedekind, ed. by E.
