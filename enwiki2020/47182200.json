    "text": "\"Please Don't Let Me Love You\" is a song by country singer Hank Williams. It was written by Ralph Jones. ==Background== In 1955, MGM acquired the Johnnie Fair Syrup shows. Between January and May 1949, Williams had pre-recorded early morning radio shows for Johnnie Fair, and MGM issued several songs from the surviving acetates as singles to satisfy the unyielding demand for product by the late country singer, who was quickly becoming a mythic figure in country music. The performance of \"Please Don't Let Me Love You\" is powerful in its understatement and demonstrates Williams' lilting falsetto. It was released as the B-side to \"Faded Love and Winter Roses\" and became his last solo hit, peaking at #9 on the country singles chart. ==Discography== ==References== Category:Hank Williams songs ",
