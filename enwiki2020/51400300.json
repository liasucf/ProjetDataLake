    "text": "Emin Alper (born 13 August 1974 in Karaman, Turkey) is a Turkish filmmaker and historian. His directorial debut, Beyond the Hill won the Caligari Film Prize in the 62nd Berlinale and Best Film at the Asia Pacific Screen Awards. His second feature Frenzy won the Special Jury Prize after premiering in competition at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival. == Life == During his university years, Emin Alper was an active member of the cinema club at Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University, spending most of his time with friends thinking on and discussing about cinema. They would organize seminars with the prominent filmmakers of their time, Nuri Bilge Ceylan and Zeki Demirkubuz. He began writing scripts and film reviews. Together with his friends, he published the film magazine \u201cG\u00f6r\u00fcnt\u00fc.\u201d It was during his university years that his lifelong love for cinema shaped, persuading him to pursue filmmaking as a career. After graduating from the university with a degree in Economics, Alper furthered his Academic work, receiving his PhD in Modern Turkish History. Emin Alper subsequently began teaching at the Department of Social Science at Istanbul Technical University. He wrote on cinema and politics at several magazines including Tarih ve Toplum, Birikim, Mesele and Altyaz\u0131. == Filmography == Gaining experience from watching other filmmakers and taking role in their short films, Emin Alper went on to make his first independent short films, The Letter in 2005, and R\u0131fat in 2006; the latter won Best Short Film at the Bucharest International Film Festival (2008) and the Special Audience Award at the !F Istanbul International Film Festival. His breakthrough came in 2012, with his directorial debut, Beyond the Hill, \u201cabout the repressed violence and projections of a Turkish family on holiday.\" Following his first feature, Alper made his second feature, Frenzy (2014), a psycho-social drama/thriller about a society\u201c brought to heel by its fear of terrorism\u201d in which two brothers \u2014 one a paroled convict secretly recruited to ferret out terrorists by examining the contents of trash bins, the other hired to kill stray dogs \u2014 are sucked into a whirl of state-sponsored distrust. Frenzy was profoundly timely in its subject matter, loudly echoing the current turmoil of politics in Turkey and the Middle East. Alper says of Frenzy, \u2018It shows how the political system turns \u201clittle men\u201d into the cogs of its violent mechanism by providing them with authority and the instruments of violence, which in the end turn against them and lead to their destruction.\u2019 Premiering in competition at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival, Frenzy was awarded the Special Jury Prize. The film won the Jury Grand Prize at the 9th Asia Pacific Screen Awards. Both Beyond the Hill and Frenzy were chosen as the Best Turkish Film by the Turkish Critics' Association in 2012 and 2015. == Influences == At 18, Emin Alper was stirred upon watching Kustorica\u2019s Time of the Gypsies, which made him, in his own words, \u201caware of the magic of cinema.\u201d He is influenced by the works of Luchino Visconti, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Michael Haneke. The storyline of Ahmet\u2019s relation with the stray dog he adopts is inspired by Thomas Mann\u2019s story A Man and His Dog. == Cinematic style == Through his analytical background and deep insight to Turkish history, Alper has developed a unique approach and style in filmmaking, gaining him widespread local and international recognition. Both Beyond the Hill (2012) and Frenzy (2015) feature sociological parables; a marked interest of Alper\u2019s. In an interview at the Venice Film Festival, Alper defines his style as \u201cparanoia and dream versus reality.\u201d Boyd van Hoeij in the Hollywood Reporter mirrors the director\u2019s cinematic signature, writing \u201cSome of these might be subjective point-of-view shots, or dreams, nightmares or hallucinations\u2026since the film\u2019s real world isn\u2019t as clearly defined, with Istanbul really seeming to be in the grip of increasing chaos and paranoia\u2026\u201d Besides blurring the lines between dream and reality, Alper plays with color and texture, creating a sense of psychic claustrophobia, made all the more tangible by the sound work of conceptual Turkish musician Cevdet Erek. == References == Category:1974 births Category:Turkish film directors Category:Living people ",
