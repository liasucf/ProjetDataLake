    "text": "The Official Version is an alternative version of D.I.T.C.'s self-titled album D.I.T.C. which was never officially available on vinyl; hence the name of this release. The Official Version has a different track listing with many of the songs being totally different versions than the ones appearing on the first album and also 2 tracks that weren't on D.I.T.C. at all - \"All Love\" and \"We Known For That\" (which is actually a remix of the 12\" single \"Internationally Known\"). The album is executively produced by Show and released on D.I.T.C. Records with distribution by Fat Beats. ==Track listing== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"center\"|# !align=\"center\" width=\"150\"|Title !align=\"center\" width=\"150\"|Producer(s) !align=\"center\" width=\"150\"|Performer (s) |- |A1 |\"Thick (Remix)\" |Rockwilder |A.G., Big L, O.C. |- |A2 |\"Way of Life (Remix)\" |Buckwild |Fat Joe, Big L, Lord Finesse |- |A3 |\"Get Yours (Remix)\" |Show |O.C., Big L |- |B1 |\"Where Ya At (Remix)\" |DJ Premier |Big Pun, Milano |- |B2 |\"We Known For That\" |Show |Fat Joe, O.C., Big L, Lord Finesse |- |B3 |\"Champagne Thoughts\" |Buckwild |O.C. |- |B4 |\"All Love\" |Lord Finesse |Fat Joe, Lord Finesse, Big L, A.G. |- |C1 |\"Ebonics (Remix)\" |DJ Premier |Big L |- |C2 |\"Foundation\" |Diamond D |A.G., Lord Finesse, Diamond, O.C. |- |C3 |\"Weekend Nights\" |Show |A.G. |- |D1 |\"Hey Love\" |Lord Finesse |Milano, Cuban Link, O.C. |- |D2 |\"Drop It Heavy\" |Show |KRS-One, Big Pun, A.G. |- |D3 |\"Tribute\" |Ahmed |A.G., O.C., Lord Finesse |} Category:2000 albums Category:Diggin' in the Crates Crew albums Category:albums produced by DJ Premier ",
