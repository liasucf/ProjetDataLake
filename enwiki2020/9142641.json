    "text": "right Maire (also Meere or Mare) is a former village in the Dutch province of Zeeland. It was located northwest of the village of Rilland. The church of Maire was mentioned in 1284. The village suffered from a number of floods, and on November 5, 1530, it drowned completely. When it was flooded again on November 2, 1532, it was abandoned completely. A small part of the area was reclaimed from the sea in 1694, but the village was never rebuilt. Maire was a separate municipality until 1816, when it was merged with Rilland.Ad van der Meer and Onno Boonstra, \"Repertorium van Nederlandse gemeenten\", KNAW, 2006. ==See also== *List of flooded villages in Zeeland ==References== Category:Former municipalities of Zeeland Category:Former populated places in the Netherlands Category:Reimerswaal (municipality) ",
