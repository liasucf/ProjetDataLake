By the time of his departure from Old Trafford he was the longest-serving player at the squad and the only player remaining from the Tommy Docherty era. He made his Albion debut in a league match away at Leicester City early in the 1988\u201389 season, and went on to make 47 appearances and score two goals that season, after which he returned to his homeland to sign for Dundee, and went on to play for Chesterfield, Chester City, Molde in Norway and Ayr United.

His total includes one game at the 1986 FIFA World Cup, a 0\u20130 draw against Uruguay on 13 June 1986. Following his retirement from playing, Albiston managed Droylsden (1996\u201397), was a junior coach at Manchester United (2000\u201304) and has also worked as a radio summariser for Manchester Independent.
