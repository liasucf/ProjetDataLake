Wrestlers portray villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. ==Event== ===Preliminary matches=== The event kicked off with an Open Mic Challenge between Mr. Anderson and Bram. Bram retrieved the mic and tried to hit Anderson with it but missed and Anderson nailed a Mic Check to Bram onto the chairs for the win. Next, Gail Kim took on The Dollhouse (Marti Bell and Jade) in a 2-on-1 Handicap Six Sides of Steel match. Bell accidentally nailed a diving crossbody to Jade which was intended for Kim, allowing Kim to nail an Eat Defeat for the win. Later, Drew Galloway took on Eli Drake in a no disqualification match. Near the end of the match, Drake placed Galloway on a table and tried to dive onto him off the top rope but Galloway kicked him and nailed a Celtic Cross to Drake from the top rope onto the table for the win. After the match, Gail Kim and Velvet Sky handcuffed Taryn Terrell to a pole to attack her backstage. It was followed by a segment in the ring in which Eric Young confronted Chris Melendez where Melendez demanded a rematch with Young and Young accepted on the condition that Young must put his leg on the line and Melendez accepted the challenge. In the penultimate match, Matt Hardy took on Tyrus. Hardy nailed two consecutive Twists of Fate to Tyrus for the win.
