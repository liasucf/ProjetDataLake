She is known for her absurd work, such as her one-woman shows I Lost My Virginity August 15, 2010 and Boss, Whom is Girl. She has also written comedic articles, and written and starred in video content, for media sites such as Adult Swim, Comedy Central, Paste, and Super Deluxe. Along with fellow comedian Caitlin Durante, she co-hosts The Bechdel Cast, a weekly podcast about the representation of women in film. ==Career== Loftus's first job out of college was at The Boston Globe. She was fired from the role when she tweeted after a standup set, \u201ccrushing so hard at an open mic that I cum bloods.\u201d A local radio show referenced this as \u201cthe end of journalism.\u201d Her often absurdist humor, sometimes bordering on performance art and documented for websites such as Paste, has included pretending to date an American Girl doll, joining Mensa as a joke, selling \"Shrek nudes\" with her body painted green to raise money for Planned Parenthood, and attempting to eat a copy of David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. She has written and performed several one-woman live shows. One is called I Lost My Virginity August 15, 2010. Another show, Boss, Whom is Girl, was workshopped at the Lyric Hyperion Theatre in Los Angeles. It was then brought to the United Kingdom with shows in London and at the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe. Its run at the Fringe was recommended by newspapers such as The Guardian, The Sunday Times, and The Daily Express. In April 2018, a three- part web series she wrote and starred in, Irrational Fears was released on Comedy Central Digital. In summer 2018, she was hired as a writer for the long-running Adult Swim show Robot Chicken. On January 1, 2020 Loftus released a four-part podcast entitled \"My Year in Mensa\" that chronicles the events surrounding her applying to join Mensa for the purpose of writing a series of humorous articles for Paste Magazine. ==Credits== ===Live credits=== * Death Wish \u2013 Writer/Performer/Director (2014) * Basketball City \u2013 Writer (2015) * Bad Art \u2013 Writer/Performer (2015) * I Lost My Virginity August 15, 2010 \u2013 Writer/Performer (2017) * The Hacker Who Codes \u2013 Writer/Performer (2018) * Boss, Whom is Girl \u2013 Writer/Performer (2019) * Jamie Loftus, Jamie Loftus \u2013 Writer/Performer (2020) ===Film/Television credits=== * Boston PD: Zamboni Crimes Division \u2013 Writer/Animator/Voice Actor (2016) * Rat Teens \u2013 Writer/Animator/Voice Actor (2017) * Funny or Die Presents \u2013 Actor (2017) * Super Deluxe \u2013 Writer/Actor (2017\u201318) * Irrational Fears \u2013 Writer/Actor (2018) * Robot Chicken \u2013 Writer/Actor (2018) * All About Nina \u2013 Comedy Consultant/Voice (2018) * Human Kind Of \u2013 Writer/Voice Actor (2018) * The New Negroes \u2013 Actor (2019) ==References== ==External links== * The Bechdel Cast website Category:Comedians from California Category:Comedians from Massachusetts Category:American women television writers Category:American women comedians Category:American television writers Category:Living people Category:1993 births ",
