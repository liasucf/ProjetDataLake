    "text": "Ratz is a 2003 French-Canadian animated television series created by Richard Zielenkiewicz and St\u00e9phane Melchior-Durand. The show stars two rats, Rapido and Razmo, aboard the S.S. Wanderer, a cheese ship without an (apparent) actual destination. The focus of the series is on the adventures of the two rats, including guarding the cheese, interacting with other stowaways and various ill-fated encounters with the crew. The rats themselves live in the hull of the ship in a lavish two-bedroom apartment. While being targeted at young children in France, the series has gained a small cult following of older ages in Canada, due to its original late-night airing time slot. The French version features the voices of the comedy duo \u00c9ric et Ramzy, while the English version features the voices of Terrence Scammell as Rapido and Rick Jones as Razmo. Unlike most animated programs designed for a younger audience, Ratz has (except for the episode \"The Genie\") no moral resolve at the end of each episode. The series debuted on March 7, 2003 on Teletoon in Canada before premiering on France 3 in France on September 21, 2003. It has also been broadcast on various other channels overseas, such as Animania HD in the United States, Cartoon Network in Latin America, and Toon Disney in the United Kingdom. The show is also notable for its positive portrayal of rats, unusual for Western and North American cultures, which often give its fictional rats selfish, antagonizing and evil characteristics. Also of interest is the pure blend of traditional animation and 3D animation, making it Canada's most expensive Teletoon show at the time, and the eclectic soundtrack by Herv\u00e9 Lavandier. Ratz was originally titled Rapido and featured a chunkier animation style; some websites (including Xilam's own website as well) still reflect this right after the 14 years of Wimsieland had the final episode on September 23, 1999. The show premiered its episode, \"Cheese Connection\" on September 21, 2003, and the series finale episode, \"No Panic on Board, A Ratz Ending\" aired on November 11, 2003. It has been broadcast since March 25, 2020 on the Netflix streaming service.. ==Ratboarding== An integral part of Ratz is the ratboard, a transportation device resembling a mousetrap with a jet engine strapped to the back (though in the episode \"The Rat Exterminator\", the rats do not recognize an actual mousetrap). The ratboard provides the rats with speedy travel in and around the ship. Rapido is very fond of his ratboard and enjoys challenging Razmo to races, often winning. Ratboards are also used to reach otherwise inaccessible places, provide speedy rescues, move things by tether or simply to impress guests. ==Characters== *Rapido is a jet set- wannabe with a huge ego to maintain. To get over his large self-doubts and low self-esteem, he acts condescendingly and often boasts having personal connections to various celebrities. Rapido is also a hypocrite, scolding Razmo sharply for engaging in an activity, then secretly pursuing the same later on. Rapido only has interest in himself and will not aide Razmo at all, unless the situation adversely affects himself. His interests include ratboard racing, celebrity magazines, fashion, house music, feeling important and wooing women. *Razmo is the shorter and stouter rat. He is a highly productive genius and mechanic, having invented the ratboard and being responsible for all mechanical and electrical issues. He is also forced to perform all chores as Rapido never lends a hand. This has led Razmo to become depressed, emotionally scarred and obsessive-compulsive. Razmo is also childish, sometimes speaking to a plush toy and wetting the bed. His interests include playing stringed bass, jazz, counting the cheese, inventing and making friends. In the original Rapido short, Razmo had a Deep South accent; the voice was changed to have a slight Brooklyn accent during production of Ratz. Oddly, Razmo is called \"Ratz\" (as in the name of the show) on the blurb for the show in Sky program guides. The crew of the S.S. Wanderer consists of three personnel: Benny the chef, Svetlana the engineer and The Captain. Neither of them is considered a villain in the series, though Benny is the one most enraged by the rats. Usually, the crew will return to their normal duties after brushing shoulders with Rapido and/or Razmo. Humorously enough, the crew's diet consists mostly of cheese, which Svetlana hates and Benny is allergic to (although Benny's allergies are not seen or discussed within the show). *The Captain is a Scottish seaman and veteran of the seas. He is the only person who knows the final destination of the cheese in the cargo hold. Over the years, he has gone from a rather serious captain to a rather goofy one, often falling into reverie or suggesting absurd courses of action during crises. All of his orders are directed towards the other two crew members. *Svetlana, the Russian engineer. She is responsible for keeping the S.S. Wanderer afloat and is usually found in situations requiring her massive size and strength. Despite her role on the ship, Svetlana attempts to act feminine whenever possible, which isn't very often. She is often talking to or conspiring with Benny. *Benny, the Japanese chef. Benny is the only one that will give cheese to the rats. Despite having five years of culinary arts under his belt, Benny is usually preparing souffl\u00e9s or sushi for the rest of the crew. He is usually interrupted by Rapido and Razmo when he brings aboard a live animal to be slaughtered. ==Episodes== ==Merchandise== * Ratz has Region 2 DVDs out in France, released by Warner Home Video, containing eight episodes per DVD. * An album, A fond les bananes !, featuring \u00c9ric et Ramzy, has also been released in France. The show's theme song \"Pas de panique \u00e0 bord\", the record's opening track, was a minor hit in France. * In Fall 2004, Smoby Toys released the toy line based on the show such as velvet furred dolls, real working play sets and plushies just like the show of the same name. Unlike Smoby, it doesn't feel appropriate to wear midriff tops from the 4 last seasons as of 2006, Smoby has discontinued the show toy line. *Ratz has CGI music videos that were released on the Sparx Animation Studios website along with Teletoon with eight songs based from the album of the same name. * On the same date, Private Marketing Service and PMS Kids Released merchandise for the show such as Smoby dolls, snacks, games and miscellaneous. ==References== ==External links== * Official site (in French) * Xilam site * * Official home site (in French) Category:Canadian children's animated comedy television series Category:Canadian animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:French children's animated comedy television series Category:Xilam Category:2003 Canadian television series debuts Category:2003 Canadian television series endings Category:Teletoon original programming Category:Animated television series about mice and rats Category:2000s Canadian animated television series Category:2003 French television series debuts Category:2003 French television series endings Category:2000s French animated television series ",
