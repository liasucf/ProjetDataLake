The family moved to Italy, Texas in 1883, and Emma attended public school there. She later attended Southwestern Normal College, graduating in 1895, and returned to Italy to teach. She married Samuel W. Meharg of Anniston, Alabama on June 24, 1902. The couple moved to Plainview, Texas, where Samuel became the public school principal and Emma taught. In 1925, Governor Miriam A. Ferguson appointed her as Secretary of State. Ferguson and Grigsby were the first female governor and Secretary of State in Texas. Among her recommendations during the position was the creation of a civil service system for the state; she also oversaw the restoration and cataloguing of state historical records. She also recommended that position be modified from how it was set out in the state's 1876 constitution, including a higher salary and being changed from an appointed position to an elected position. Meharg served on the board of the Texas Technological College from 1932 to 1937.
