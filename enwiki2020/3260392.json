    "text": "The greater naked-tailed armadillo (Cabassous tatouay) is an armadillo species from South America. ==Description== Larger than the closely related southern naked-tailed armadillos, adults of the greater species measure in head-body length, with a tail in length. There are eight or nine uniformly shaped teeth on each side of each jaw, with no identifiable incisors or canines. The carapace includes an average of 13 movable bands between the solid shields over the shoulders and hips, with each band having about 30 individual scutes. There is also a scaled shield over the upper surface of the head, with much smaller scales on the ears and on the cheeks below the eyes. The tail bears only small, isolated scales. ==Distribution and habitat== Greater naked-tailed armadillos are found in southern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and Uruguay and extreme north-eastern Argentina. It inhabits lowland and submontane forests, and also relatively open areas such as the Cerrado and Pantanal. There are no recognised subspecies. ==Behaviour== Greater naked-tailed armadillos feed on ants and termites and sleeps in burrows, often dug within termite mounds. Burrows are typically about in width, and positioned so that their entrances face away from the prevailing winds. ==References== Category:Armadillos Armadillo, greater naked-tailed Armadillo, greater naked-tailed Armadillo, greater naked-tailed Armadillo, greater naked-tailed Armadillo, greater naked- tailed Armadillo, greater naked-tailed Armadillo, greater naked-tailed Category:Mammals described in 1804 ",
