    "text": "\"Bright Eyes\" is a song written by English songwriter Mike Batt and performed by Art Garfunkel. It was written for the soundtrack of the 1978 British animated adventure drama film Watership Down. Rearranged as a pop song from its original form in the film, the track appears on British and European versions of Garfunkel's 1979 Fate for Breakfast and on the US versions of his 1981 album Scissors Cut. It was the biggest-selling single of 1979 in the UK, remaining at number one for six weeks and selling over a million copies there. Richard Adams, author of the original novel is reported to have hated the song. A cover of the song was later used in the television series of the same name explicitly as its theme song. == Background == The song was written, produced and arranged by Mike Batt for Watership Down, with original director John Hubley requesting a song about death. It plays when the rabbit Hazel, the lead character in the film, almost dies after being wounded by a farmer's gun and Fiver, his little brother is led to him by the Black Rabbit of Inl\u00e9. The pop single arrangement of the song was very successful in the United Kingdom, staying at number one in the UK Singles Chart for six weeks in 1979, selling over one million copies, becoming the biggest-selling single of the year. In the United States, it failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100. It reached #27 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1979) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australian Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|2 |- |align=\"left\"|Austrian Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|Dutch Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|German Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|Irish Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|2 |- |align=\"left\"|Norwegian Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|South African Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|15 |- |align=\"left\"|Swedish Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|Swiss Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|2 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !
