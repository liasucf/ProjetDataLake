    "text": "James Morgan McGill, also known by his business name Saul Goodman and later known as Gene Takavic, is a fictional character who appears in the television series Breaking Bad and serves as the titular character of its spin-off prequel series Better Call Saul. He is portrayed by Bob Odenkirk, and was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. The character is an Albuquerque- based lawyer who embraces his tendencies as a former scam artist and begins to represent criminals while himself becoming involved in the city's criminal world. Saul's name is a play on the phrase \"[It]'s all good, man\". == Development == Bob Odenkirk portrays Saul Goodman/Jimmy McGill/Gene Takavic in both Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul The need for a character like Saul came from two paths of Breaking Bads development around the show's second season. First, as Walt and Jesse got themselves deeper into the drug business, the show's writers felt they needed a character to be a guide for them. At this point, they had written that Jesse's dimwitted friends like Badger were selling their drugs, they needed to envision what type of lawyer they would enlist should they run into trouble. Secondly, they were at a point in Hank's character arc where he had suffered a major trauma in seeing Tortuga's severed head, and he would no longer be able to serve as the show's bit of lightness. They thus made Saul more of a comical character to fill this void. The creators decided on the name \"Saul Goodman\" as a play on the phrase \"[It]'s all good, man\", as in that even his most simple-minded clients would remember his name when they get arrested. Gould credits Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan for initially suggesting this idea for Saul's name. The Breaking Bad episode \"Better Call Saul\" was written by Peter Gould, and he has been ultimately credited with creating the character. In terms of casting for the part, both Gilligan and Gould said that their crew included a number of fans of Mr. Show with Bob and David, including Gould's wife Nora, and Odenkirk's name quickly came up for the role. Odenkirk based the character's speaking style on producer Robert Evans. Saul was originally intended to appear in only three episodes of the second season of Breaking Bad, but instead became central to the narrative of the series. Though originally written as a \"two- and-a-half-dimensional\" comic relief character, Saul's role became more in- depth, as Gilligan and Gould found they could use Saul as a \"further entree to the criminal underbelly\" for Walt in the later seasons. This also allowed them to give the character more humanity, which the showrunners credited to Odenkirk's acting skills. They considered that like with Aaron Paul and Dean Norris, Odenkirk's acting capability significantly altered plans they had for these characters and the show in a beneficial manner, making them more central to the larger plot. As Saul had proven to be a popular character with audiences, Gilligan and Gould already had started thinking about a spin-off involving Saul and approached Odenkirk on his interest to make it happen. Once Breaking Bad was completed, Gilligan and Gould worked to establish what the spinoff series would be about, ultimately coming onto the idea of a prequel named Better Call Saul that would feature Jimmy McGill and how he would become Saul Goodman. The showrunners realized that Saul was, as seen in Breaking Bad, \"comfortable in his own skin\" and had nowhere else to go, that they could instead explore how Saul got to that point, mirroring the same type of self- destruction that occurred to Walter White in Breaking Bad. They saw Jimmy as an \"earnest, sweet guy whose brain naturally cooks up dishonest solutions to the challenges in front of him\", where by the time of Breaking Bad, Saul is a \"front\" for one who \"seemed to enjoy being a showy cheeseball\", and a \"hermetically sealed slickster\". Rhea Seehorn, who plays Kim Wexler, Jimmy's romantic interest in Better Call Saul, said that one aspect of Jimmy she incorporated into her acting was the spontaneity of Jimmy slipping into and out of the Saul Goodman character, or as Gould had described to her, \"right there at the moment\", a factor that for Kim and other associates of Jimmy can cause confusion and concern. Breaking Bad established little of Saul's origins, and even had stated that Saul was not his real name. This gave Gilligan, Gould, and Odenkirk a chance to flesh out more of Jimmy's backstory for Better Call Saul. Odenkirk and Gilligan set Jimmy's hometown as Chicago, in part as it was Odenkirk's own hometown as well as a homage to the notorious corruption in the political history of Chicago as inspiration for the character. In 2014, as a publicity stunt for the launch of Better Call Saul, a billboard for \"James M. McGill, Attorney at Law\" was placed in Albuquerque, mimicking a billboard that appeared on the show, with a phone number connecting to a voicemail message recorded by Odenkirk. == Biography == Jimmy is of Irish descent and was born on November 12, 1960 in Cicero, Illinois, outside Chicago. His older brother Chuck became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at an Albuquerque law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). As a child, Jimmy worked at his father Charles Sr.'s general store in Cicero, and watched as customers took advantage of his na\u00efve father; Jimmy soon began stealing from the store himself. According to Chuck, Jimmy embezzled $14,000 from his family's store, leading to his father's bankruptcy. His father died six months later; Jimmy cried inconsolably at the funeral. Determined not to be like his father, Jimmy becomes a con artist, and earns the nickname \"Slippin' Jimmy\" for staging \"slip and fall\" accidents. He also ran petty scams including the \"fake Rolex\" with the help of his partner-in-crime Marco Pasternak. Jimmy ran into trouble with the law when he drunkenly defecated through the sunroof of an adversary's car while the man's children were inside. Facing the possibility of having to register as a sex offender, Jimmy asked Chuck for help, despite a five-year separation with his family. Chuck successfully defended him, but required that he move to Albuquerque and work a legitimate job in HHM's mail room. At some point prior to the start of the show, Jimmy had been married and divorced twice. While working in the HHM mail room, Jimmy befriended Kim Wexler, an HHM employee attending law school. Inspired by her success, Jimmy completed his college degree and attended The University of Samoa correspondence law school. He passed the bar exam and hoped to be hired at HHM, but at Chuck's insistence, senior partner Howard Hamlin denied Jimmy the opportunity. Jimmy then began a solo practice, working out of the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon. He takes whatever cases he can get, primarily low paid public defender work. Some years later, near the time of his divorce with Rebecca, Chuck develops a psychosomatic aversion to electricity, becoming semi-reclusive. Faithfully Jimmy cares for Chuck, bringing him groceries and running his errands. Jimmy still struggles with finances, and at the start of the show drives a signature Suzuki Esteem with mismatched doors, a visual pun reflecting on Jimmy's current poor self-esteem at this stage of his life. Jimmy butts heads with Mike Ehrmantraut, a former Philly police officer working as a courthouse parking lot attendant, Jimmy begins to use the alias \"Saul Goodman\", a play on the phrase \"It's all good, man\". He initially uses it as the alternate identity for the high-energy pitchman in television ads he produces, and later makes use of it when he begins a business reselling prepaid cell phones on the street. === Better Call Saul === ==== Season 1 ==== Unhappy with working as a public defender for low pay, Jimmy hopes to represent hapless, county treasurer Craig Kettleman and his wife Betsy, a couple accused of embezzling over $1.6 million. They retain the services of HHM, but Jimmy's attempts to represent them, leads to an altercation with Tuco Salamanca and Nacho Varga, members of the Juarez drug cartel. When Nacho plans to rob them, Jimmy anonymously warns the Kettlemans, and their home later appears to have been the scene of a kidnapping. Nacho, who had been seen surveilling the Kettlemans, is arrested, and Jimmy defends him and obtains his release. Following Mike's hunch, Jimmy discovers the Kettlemans staged their disappearance and are hiding in the foothills behind their home. When he confronts them, the Kettlemans pay him $50,000 not to turn over the money. HHM suggests the Kettlemans take a plea bargain, so they turn to Jimmy for defense. Jimmy works with Mike to find the Kettlemans' hiding place. Mike commandeers the stolen funds and delivers it to the district attorney, forcing Craig to accept a guilty plea. Jimmy produces wills for several elderly clients, exhibiting patience and a great rapport, so Kim suggests he focus on an elder law practice. During a visit to the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, he finds the company is committing fraud by overcharging clients. With Chuck's help, he finds a document that proves the fraud, and Jimmy and Chuck begin a class action lawsuit against Sandpiper. When the case grows, Chuck suggests turning it over to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out of the subsequent litigation. Jimmy confronts Chuck, who admits that he resents Jimmy's legal career and does not consider him a peer because of his unconventional education and conman past. Jimmy returns to Cicero and spends a week running cons with Marco, but decides to leave after Marco dies of a heart attack. He returns to Albuquerque when Kim calls to say that the case has continued to grow, so HHM has brought in another firm, Davis & Main. Knowing he understands the details of the case better than anyone and has developed personal relationships with the clients, Kim persuades Davis & Main to hire Jimmy as an associate. Jimmy goes home and is prepared to meet with the Davis & Main partners, but has second thoughts and drives away. ==== Season 2 ==== Jimmy hides out at a hotel while vacationing under an assumed name with a stolen credit card. Kim persuades Jimmy to reconsider joining Davis & Main, so he accepts their offer. Assigned to enroll new clients in the Sandpiper case, Jimmy succeeds at signing up more residents, but his skirting of the ethical canons leads Chuck to chastise him in front of the other attorneys. Jimmy produces and airs a television ad without the approval of the D&M; partners or the knowledge of the partners at HHM, leading to a reprimand and a junior attorney assigned to constantly supervise him. Kim is relegated to menial document review work as the result of her failure to inform HHM about Jimmy's commercial. In an effort to reclaim her status at HHM, Kim works her contacts to bring in a new client and succeeds at landing Mesa Verde Bank. Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit. Jimmy proposes that they go into partnership together. Kim counters with a proposal that they start separate practices in a shared office, so Jimmy quits D&M;, Kim quits HHM and they begin their new firms. Kim succeeds at winning Mesa Verde as a client, but Chuck persuades Mesa Verde to remain with HHM. Chuck's attempts to hide his electromagnetic sensitivity during the meeting with Mesa Verde causes him to become severely ill, and his caregiver Ernesto calls Jimmy for help. While Chuck sleeps, Jimmy alters Mesa Verde documents stored at Chuck's house. As a result, Chuck's application to the state banking board for a new Mesa Verde branch is incorrect, leading to a significant delay. Mesa Verde fires HHM and hires Kim, and Chuck suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him. Kim infers Jimmy's guilt and tells him that if he left any evidence, Chuck will find it. Knowing the copy store clerk where he altered the documents can identify him, Jimmy goes to the store to buy his silence, but sees Ernesto questioning the clerk. Having visited stores at Chuck's request until he found the right one, Ernesto leaves to pick up Chuck and bring him back to question the clerk. Jimmy enters the store and bribes the clerk, then waits across the street to see what happens when Chuck arrives. Chuck begins to question the clerk, but his EHS causes him to faint and hit his head. Jimmy is torn between coming to Chuck's aid and keeping secret his alteration of the Mesa Verde documents. Jimmy comes to Chuck's aid and Chuck is transported to the hospital. He wonders how Jimmy arrived at the store so quickly after his accident and guesses that Jimmy bribed the clerk and stayed nearby to watch. Ernesto lies to Chuck, saying he called Jimmy before bringing Chuck to the store out of concern for Chuck's health. Chuck's doctor proves to Jimmy that Chuck's EHS symptoms are psychosomatic. Chuck tricks Jimmy into confessing to the Mesa Verde fraud, which Chuck secretly records. ==== Season 3 ==== Odenkirk (left) and Lavell Crawford as Saul and Huell during filming of the third season of Breaking Bad Chuck arranges for Jimmy to learn of the recording through Ernesto and Kim, and Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to destroy it. Chuck's private investigator and Howard witness Jimmy actions, enabling Chuck to report him to the police. Jimmy is arrested, but Chuck tells the prosecutor he prefers having Jimmy submit to a bar association disciplinary hearing to pursuing a criminal case. Jimmy and Kim make Chuck's mental fitness an issue when he testifies, and Jimmy questions him about his hypersensitivity. Jimmy reveals that Huell Babineaux, a pickpocket, placed Jimmy's cell phone battery in Chuck's pocket and Chuck carried it for over an hour without experiencing symptoms. The prosecutor says Chuck's mental fitness is not an issue, and the suggestion that Chuck's illness is not real causes him to vent all his frustrations about Jimmy in a tirade that stuns the hearing room audience. Jimmy's law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred. To both pay his share of the rent on the office and make use of TV ad time for which he has already prepaid, Jimmy begins producing commercials for other businesses while using the on air alias Saul Goodman. He learns of a proposed settlement of the Sandpiper case, of which his share will be more than a million dollars, but finds that Irene, the lawsuit's class representative, has turned it down because the lawyers have advised her that they can obtain a bigger settlement by waiting. Jimmy executes several actions designed to trick Irene into accepting the settlement, but feels remorse when her friends ostracize her. When he attempts to confess, her friends believe he is covering for her, so he arranges for them to overhear him bragging about tricking them on the public address system he uses to call Bingo games at the senior center. Irene is vindicated and her friendships are restored, but Jimmy's confession costs him his share of the proposed settlement. Kim takes on a second client in order to generate the income necessary to keep the office, but falls asleep at the wheel while driving to a meeting and breaks her arm. Jimmy and Kim close the office and Kim runs her practice from her apartment. Jimmy attempts to obtain a refund of his malpractice insurance premium but finds that the insurance must stay in force in case he is sued over past cases while his license is suspended. Jimmy pretends to break down while informing the insurance carrier about Chuck's condition, an act calculated to get the carrier to raise Chuck's malpractice insurance premiums. The insurance carrier informs Chuck and Howard that HHM's insurance rates will rise dramatically unless Chuck is continually supervised by another attorney. Chuck wants to fight, but Howard pays the first of three installments that enable him to buy out Chuck's partnership, and Chuck is forced to retire. Jimmy attempts to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck rebuffs him. Chuck's EHS symptoms become more severe and he removes all the appliances from his house and pulls out the wiring in an effort to discover what is causing his electricity meter to keep running. Chuck's condition continues to deteriorate, and he purposely kicks over a gas lantern that sets his house ablaze. ==== Season 4 ==== Jimmy believes himself at fault for Chuck's death until Howard confides his belief that he is at fault because of his response to the increase in malpractice insurance rates. Jimmy conceals his role in the insurance issue, allows Howard to accept the blame, and regains his upbeat demeanor. While job hunting, Jimmy spots an opportunity to steal a valuable Hummel figurine from the owner of a copier store, which he hires Ira to do. While managing a cell phone store, Jimmy uses his token inheritance from Chuck to begin a lucrative side business reselling prepaid phones on the street, again making use of the Saul Goodman alias. Kim is bored with practicing banking law for Mesa Verde, and begins accepting pro bono criminal defense cases she finds more satisfying. Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely, the firm representing Sandpiper, to hire her as a partner in charge of a new banking division, but tells Jimmy that senior partner Rich Schweikart sought her out. Near the end of his year of his probation, Jimmy's side business comes crashing down when a plainclothes cop shows up to question him. Huell, acting as Jimmy's bodyguard, misunderstands the interaction due to wearing headphones, and strikes the cop over the head with a bag of sandwiches, leading to an assault charge. As the cop has previously interacted with Huell, he plays up his injuries, and the assistant district attorney seeks to subject Huell to a sentence of several years in prison as a repeat offender. Jimmy enlists Kim's aid to defend Huell, but she refuses to ruin the cop's reputation. Instead, Kim and Jimmy arrange for a false show of support for Huell that results in the prosecutor accepting a plea bargain that keeps him out of prison. With Kim elated by the thrill of the scam, she convinces Jimmy to help her run a con that enables her to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in Lubbock, Texas with plans for a bigger building. Jimmy's request for reinstatement is denied, and he learns it was because he failed to show remorse for Chuck's death. To prepare for his appeal, Kim and Jimmy carry out several public displays that enable him to fake remorse, including dedicating a law library reading room in Chuck's name at the University of New Mexico. Jimmy makes a speech to the appeal panel about wanting to do justice to the McGill name, convincing them to reinstate his license. He then shocks Kim by obtaining a DBA application, revealing that the speech was an insincere con, and that he intends to resume practicing law under the name Saul Goodman. ==== Season 5 ==== Jimmy starts a law practice as Saul Goodman to capitalize on the alias from his prepaid cell phone business. He offers Kim astute, pragmatic advice with her pro bono clientele, advice that is both appreciated and yet frustrating in its moral ambiguity and specious nature. Mesa Verde Bank intends to evict Everett Acker from his leased land to make way for a new call center, and offers Acker a meager settlement. Kim sympathizes with Acker and has Jimmy become his counsel. Jimmy employs delaying tactics in hopes of swaying the bank to accept an alternative to Acker's eviction, but Kevin, the bank's president, is adamant. With Rich threatening to pull Kim off the Mesa Verde case, Kim asks Jimmy to persuade Acker to accept an improved settlement in which she will make up the difference between what Acker wants and what the bank will pay. Jimmy agrees, but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he surprises everyone with an outlandish offer and threats of negative publicity against the bank, which leads Kevin to agree to a more favorable deal. Kim is furious at Jimmy for not making her aware of his plan and suggests they marry so their conversations will be protected by spousal privilege. They marry the next day in a small courthouse ceremony. Howard feels guilt over his past treatment of Jimmy and offers him a job at HHM. Jimmy is unsettled by the reminder of his past and harasses Howard by damaging his car and disrupting his business lunch with Clifford Main. Howard realizes Jimmy is toying with him and rescinds the job offer; Jimmy angrily replies that as Saul Goodman, he is too big for the constraints of HHM. Nacho and Lalo Salamanca involve Jimmy in the Salamanca drug business when they hire him to gain Domingo Molina's release from jail by having him pose as a confidential informant for DEA Agent Hank Schrader. Jimmy later represents Lalo when he is arrested for murder. Gus Fring, the rival in the drug business to the Salamancas, wants Lalo released, so Mike provides information that enables Jimmy to persuade a judge to grant bail of $7 million cash. Jimmy agrees to accept $100,000 in exchange for transporting the money from a remote desert site. He picks up the cash from Leonel and Marco Salamanca (the Cousins), but on his return trip is attacked by several gunmen. Mike was tracking Jimmy for Gus and kills all but one attacker. Jimmy's car breaks down, forcing them to hide the car from the remaining attacker and trek cross-country with the money. They walk for two days and work together to kill the remaining gunman before they are able to call for help. The events leave Jimmy suffering from post-traumatic stress. After posting Lalo's bail, Jimmy tells Lalo he walked cross-country alone after his car broke down so he would not risk losing the money. Jimmy tells Kim the same story, but she sees he is lying and tells him she will be ready to listen when he is ready to tell her the truth. Jimmy cuts his recuperation short to deal with clients at the courthouse. When he returns that night, Kim tells him she quit Schweikart & Cokely and gave up the Mesa Verde account. As they argue, Mike phones to warn Jimmy that instead of going to Mexico, Lalo is en route to Jimmy and Kim's apartment. As Mike listens in via Jimmy's concealed cell phone and trains a sniper rifle on Lalo, Lalo questions Jimmy's version of events and reveals he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim stands up to Lalo and berates him for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo seems satisfied and leaves, but Jimmy and Kim move to a hotel for their safety. The next day, Jimmy learns from Mike that Lalo returned to Mexico and is to be assassinated that evening. That evening Kim tells Jimmy she saw Howard at the courthouse. On learning she left S&C;, Howard told her about Jimmy's harassment campaign and suggested that Jimmy was a bad influence on her, which she aggressively denied. She suggests they force an early settlement in the Sandpiper case, which would give Jimmy his seven-figure share of the settlement sooner. Jimmy counsels against it, but Kim confidently affirms her intent by returning the same finger gun gesture Jimmy used when announcing he intended to practice law as Saul Goodman. === Breaking Bad === By the time of Saul's introduction in Breaking Bad, he has fully adopted the identity of \"Saul Goodman\", and rarely mentions the name McGill. Saul is an astutely aggressive defense attorney, aided by his working knowledge of Spanish, but also engages in questionable as well as blatantly criminal activity, such as abetting money laundering. He routinely dresses in loud, gaudy colors, and now drives a Cadillac DeVille. Saul has established an office in a strip mall, adorned with Roman columns, and the US Constitution wallpapered behind them, his tasteless, ostentatious advertising panders to the criminal mind and includes a large inflatable Statue of Liberty balloon. He has ties to Gus Fring, the owner of the \"Los Pollos Hermanos\" fast-food chicken franchise around Albuquerque which he uses as a front to smuggle drugs from the Mexican Juarez cartel. Until the final episodes of Breaking Bad, Saul continues to have the same go-lucky attitude shown in Better Call Saul, mainly interested in profiting while other characters are concerned with life and death. ==== Season 2 ==== A prop bench with a \"Better Call Saul\" ad After their employee Badger is arrested in an Albuquerque Police sting operation, meth cooks Walter White and Jesse Pinkman hire Saul as their lawyer and consigliere. Saul has already offered to be Badger's legal counsel and has learned that the DEA hopes Badger will lead them to \"Heisenberg\". Walt poses as Badger's uncle and goes to Saul's office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to reveal his associates in order to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from \"flipping\", but Saul refuses. Walt and Jesse kidnap Saul and threaten to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing. Saul, initially worried that the two are from Lalo or Nacho, sees through their scare tactics, takes a token payment so he can give them legal advice protected by attorney-client privilege, and tells them about Jimmy \"In-'N-Out\" Kilkelly, who makes a living confessing to the crimes of others and going to prison. Saul arranges for Kilkelly to be arrested and confess to being Heisenberg. The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger meets with him for a drug deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school. He informs Walt that he was too easy to find and offers to be his full-time legal counsel, money launderer, and adviser with respect to protecting his identity. Combo, Jesse's friend and one of their dealers, is killed by a rival gang, and Jesse's friends refuse to sell any further. Saul helps Walt and Jesse out by promising to contact another dealer, Gus, though warns the pair that Gus is very selective of whom he does business with. Walter ultimately convinces Gus to buy their latest batch valued at nearly one million dollars, but Gus expresses strong reservations about Jesse's drug addiction and trustworthiness. ==== Season 3 ==== To help launder Walt's drug money, Saul uses the website his son Walter Jr. set up for donors to contribute to Walt's chemotherapy, making the drug cash look like small donations from numerous contributors. Saul also helps Jesse anonymously buy his aunt's house back from his parents with his share of the drug money. Saul and Mike bug Walt's wife Skyler's house to find out if she has told anyone about Walt. Saul attempts to get Jesse to convince Walt to resume cooking methamphetamine. After an altercation between Walt and Skyler's boss Ted Beneke, Mike brings Walt to Saul. Walt figures out that Saul has been bugging his house and attacks him, causing Saul to refuse to launder any more money through Walter Jr.'s website. Jesse visits Saul with methamphetamine he produced and asks for a meeting with Gus, at which Gus agrees to buy Jesse's product, assuming it will be an incentive to Walt. Saul sets up a meeting between Jesse and Walt to resolve the issue of Jesse's half of the money from their previous work for Gus. Walt agrees to resume meth production for Gus, with Gale Boetticher as his assistant, so Saul changes sides and agrees to launder Walt's new income. When Walt's brother-in-law Hank Schrader, a DEA agent, is close to catching Jesse in the recreational vehicle Walt and he use as a meth lab, and learning that Walt is with him, Walt calls Saul. Saul has his secretary Francesca pose as an Albuquerque Police Department dispatcher falsely claiming that Hank's wife Marie has been in a car accident, luring Hank away to the hospital, thus giving Jesse and Walt enough time to destroy the RV. Nevertheless, Saul feels guilty about his part in the cruel ruse. Frustrated at losing his potential arrest of Jesse, Hank attacks Jesse at his home. Saul visits a hospitalized Jesse, who threatens to expose Walt's identity. Saul and Walt consider killing Jesse, but decide against it. Saul tries to convince Jesse to buy commercial properties to launder his money but Jesse rejects the idea. Saul discusses plans for money laundering with Skyler and Walt, floating the idea of buying a laser tag business. Skyler wants to buy Walt's former employer Bogdan's car wash, believing it is a much more plausible front business. Walt visits Saul to discuss Jesse's plan to kill two dealers who work for Gus and killed Jesse's friend Combo and his girlfriend Andrea's brother Tom\u00e1s. Mike threatens Saul in order to obtain Jesse's location, intending to kill him before he acts against the dealers, but Saul sends Mike to the wrong location. Saul helps Jesse hide and later arranges for Jesse and Walt to meet at the laser tag arcade. ==== Season 4 ==== Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman on the set of Breaking Bad during the filming of the fourth season, with Emily Rios as Andrea Cantillo Saul and Skyler plot ways to persuade Bogdan to sell the car wash, but Skyler rules out violence or intimidation. Saul has his employee Patrick Kuby pose as a government inspector to inform Bogdan of supposed environmental concerns that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate. Bogdan sells the car wash to Walt and Skyler, and Skyler takes over day-to-day management. Walt confides in Saul about his concerns with respect to Jesse, Hank, and Gus. Saul tells Walt about Ed the \"disappearer\", a vacuum repair shop owner who can provide Walt and his family new identities if they have to flee. Walt runs over Gus' two dealers before Jesse can kill them, then tells Jesse to run. Saul helps ensure the damage to Walt's car is not discovered. Walt suggests that Gus will retaliate for the murder of the two dealers and recommends that Saul contact a hit man to kill Gus, but Saul dismisses the idea. At Jesse's behest, Saul visits Andrea and tries to give her Jesse's remaining cash. To protect Skyler from the IRS investigation into Beneke's tax fraud, Saul gives him $620,000 of Walt's cash to pay the tax bill by passing off the money as an inheritance from a fake relative. Ted plans to spend the cash, so Saul sends Kuby and Huell to force him to pay the IRS, and after Beneke signs the check he tries to run away, trips, and injures himself. After Gus threatens Walt, Walt demands Saul set up a meeting with Ed so his family can escape. Walt asks Saul to tip off the DEA about Gus directing his assassins Marco and Leonel Salamanca to attack Hank. Saul agrees but refuses to mention Gus' name. Saul persuades Jesse to come to his office, and has Huell secretly steal the ricin cigarette Walt gave Jesse to use in killing Gus. Saul gives Jesse his money and tells him to leave Albuquerque for his own safety. Jesse realizes the ricin is gone. Andrea's son Brock is poisoned and Jesse tells the doctors to check for ricin, believing that Walt is responsible. Walt persuades Jesse that Gus poisoned Brock, however, so Jesse agrees to help him kill Gus. Saul goes into hiding, but returns to represent Jesse when he is questioned about Brock's poisoning. Saul discovers from Jesse that Gus regularly visits Hector Salamanca in a nursing home. Saul passes the information to Walt, who uses it in a plot to kill Gus. ==== Season 5 ==== ===== Part 1 ===== Saul tells Skyler about Beneke's accident, which has left him hospitalized and immobile. Walt is angry with Saul about Saul's payment to Beneke, while Saul is upset at Walt for poisoning Brock (as revealed in the previous season's finale episode), revealing that he knew about it all along. He attempts to end his relationship with Walt, but Walt intimidates him into continuing their business arrangement. With Gus dead, Saul tries to convince Walt to stop making meth, but Walt says he has to continue because he needs the cash. Saul hosts a meeting between Mike, Jesse, and Walt, where they agree to set up a new meth- producing business. Saul helps Walt and Jesse look for new locations, and they agree on Ira's business, Vamanos Pest Control, as the best option. Saul defends Mike from the DEA's investigation by threatening litigation over their supposed harassment. The DEA learns that Mike's lawyer Dan Wachsberger is the conduit for Mike's hush money payments to Gus's former employees and Mike's hiding cash for his daughter-in-law Stacey and granddaughter Kaylee. Mike asks Saul to retrieve the \"go bag\" with cash and false identity documents that he previously hid. Saul is unable, however, and has Walt do it. When Mike refuses to divulge the names of Gus' former employees so Walt can have them killed to protect his identity, Walt shoots and kills him. Jesse tries to have Saul take the $5 million Jesse made stealing a trainload of methylamine and distribute it to Kaylee and the parents of Drew Sharp, a young boy whom cartel minion Todd Alquist killed during the theft. Saul refuses, saying the attempt to move the cash will attract more police scrutiny. Jesse attempts to get rid of the money in other ways, including throwing it onto random lawns and leaving it in random mailboxes. Saul calls Walt to inform him of Jesse's erratic behavior. ===== Part 2 ===== Walt visits Saul to tell him that Hank has learned that Walt is Heisenberg. Saul suggests killing Hank, but Walt refuses. Jesse is arrested while tossing money from his car, and Saul obtains his release from police custody. Saul arranges a meeting between Walt and Jesse, and Walt convinces Jesse to contact Ed and start a new life. Saul wants Jesse to give up drugs before beginning the trip, but Jesse refuses, so Saul has Huell pickpocket Jesse's cannabis. When Jesse realizes his marijuana was stolen, he figures out that Huell must have also stolen the ricin cigarette, meaning that Walt poisoned Brock and Saul knew. Instead of leaving with Ed, Jesse returns to Saul's office and assaults him. Saul admits he had Huell steal the ricin, but says he did not know what Walt intended. Saul calls Walt to warn him that Jesse knows the truth about what happened to Brock. Saul meets with Walt and suggests killing Jesse. After the DEA manipulates Huell into telling them what happened to Walt's money, Saul is afraid for his life and meets with Walt at the car wash. Believing his arrest is imminent, Walt goes into hiding. As shown in the cold open of the Better Call Saul episode \"Quite a Ride\", Saul gathers valuables from his office and gives Francesca a cover story, while she prepares to dispose of shredded documents from Saul's law practice. She agrees to be at a telephone booth on November 12 (Jimmy's birthday) at 3 p.m. to receive a call. Saul gives Francesca cash and an attorney's business card, and tells her that if she needs help she should say \"Jimmy\" sent her. Saul and Walt both subsequently contact Ed, who sets up a new life for Saul as Gene, the manager of a Cinnabon in Omaha, Nebraska. Walt tries to persuade Saul to go with him instead of going to Omaha, and to contact hit men to kill his former dealing associate Jack Welker in retaliation for killing Hank, but Saul refuses. Walt tries to intimidate Saul but doubles over in a coughing fit. Saul leaves Walt in Ed's basement and begins his trip to Omaha. === Post- Breaking Bad === Though Saul does not appear in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, Ed refers to him when Jesse attempts to persuade Ed to help him leave Albuquerque and begin a new life. In addition, a scene in the film shows that the strip mall location of Saul's former law office has become a restaurant and sports bar. The season premieres of Better Call Saul open with black-and- white flashforwards that take place after Breaking Bad, showing that after leaving Albuquerque, Saul relocates to Omaha, Nebraska under the alias Gene Takavic, keeping a low profile as a manager of a Cinnabon store in a shopping mall. These scenes show him reminiscing about his past success in private, but wary of anyone finding out about his previous life in Albuquerque. However, when called out by a taxi driver who recognizes him as Saul, Gene calls up Ed to request another relocation, but then decides mid-call to face the situation himself. == Reception == For the first four seasons of Better Call Saul, Odenkirk was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series as well as the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. Odenkirk also received nominations for the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actor in a Drama Series for the first four seasons, winning the award twice.
