    "text": "The men's long jump event at the 2020 Summer Olympics is scheduled to take place between 31 July and 2 August 2021 at the Japan National Stadium. Approximately 35 athletes are expected to compete; the exact number will depend on how many nations use universality places to enter athletes in addition to the 32 qualifying through time or ranking (1 universality place was used in 2016). ==Background== This will be the 29th appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. ==Qualification== A National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to 3 qualified athletes in the men's long jump event if all athletes meet the entry standard or qualify by ranking during the qualifying period. (The limit of 3 has been in place since the 1930 Olympic Congress.) The qualifying standard is 8.22 metres. This standard was \"set for the sole purpose of qualifying athletes with exceptional performances unable to qualify through the IAAF World Rankings pathway.\" The world rankings, based on the average of the best five results for the athlete over the qualifying period and weighted by the importance of the meet, will then be used to qualify athletes until the cap of 32 is reached. The qualifying period was originally from 1 May 2019 to 29 June 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the period was suspended from 6 April 2020 to 30 November 2020, with the end date extended to 29 June 2021. The world rankings period start date was also changed from 1 May 2019 to 30 June, 2020; athletes who had met the qualifying standard during that time were still qualified, but those using world rankings would not be able to count performances during that time. The qualifying time standards could be obtained in various meets during the given period that have the approval of the IAAF. Both outdoor and indoor meets are eligible. The most recent Area Championships may be counted in the ranking, even if not during the qualifying period. NOCs can also use their universality place\u2014each NOC can enter one male athlete regardless of time if they had no male athletes meeting the entry standard for an athletics event\u2014in the long jump. ==Competition format== The 2020 competition will continue to use the two-round format with divided final introduced in 1952. The qualifying round gives each competitor three jumps to achieve a qualifying distance (not yet set; 2016 used 8.15 metres); if fewer than 12 men do so, the top 12 (including all those tied) will advance. The final provides each jumper with three jumps; the top eight jumpers receive an additional three jumps for a total of six, with the best to count (qualifying round jumps are not considered for the final). ==Records== Prior to this competition, the existing world, Olympic, and area records are as follows. {| class=\"wikitable\" !
