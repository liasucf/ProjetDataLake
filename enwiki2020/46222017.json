    "text": "Air Dabia was a short-lived Gambian airline which flew between 1996 and 1998; it had a three-ship fleet (one Boeing 747, notable as being the airframe involved in the United Airlines Flight 811 decompression incident, and two Boeing 727 aircraft). It was run by alleged fraudster Foutanga Babani Sissoko, whose conspicuous personal wealth had murky origins. In its short period of operation, there were allegations from numerous employees of excessive hours, improper rest provisions for crews (being expected to sleep on aircraft between trips) and pay discrepancies. It transported pilgrims from Mali to Mecca, and Malian refugees from Brazzaville. The 747, C5-FBS, was abandoned at Plattsburgh International Airport and scrapped in place in 2004. ==References== ==External links== * \"The playboy who got away with $242m \u2013 using \u2018black magic\u2019\", BBC News, 16 February 2018 Category:Defunct airlines of the Gambia Category:Airlines established in 1996 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1998 ",
