Al Ittihad were originally given 3rd place as JS Kabylie did not play a penalty shootout, as they claim they won the tie on away goals. The Algerian club also said that Ittihad had an unfair advantage playing at home in a one-off match. As a result, CAF will meet on 19 January to discuss the match. The FNAF later decided that the two clubs would share 3rd place, and therefore share the $75,000 prize fund. ==Final== ===First leg=== \\---- ===Second leg=== ==References== ==External links== * North African Champions' Cup 2008/09 Category:2008 in African football 2008 Category:2008\u201309 in Moroccan football Category:2008\u201309 in Algerian football Category:2008\u201309 in Libyan football Category:2008\u201309 in Tunisian football Category:2008\u201309 in Egyptian football ",
