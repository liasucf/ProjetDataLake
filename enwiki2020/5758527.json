It is a southwestern suburb of Cork and is made-up of the townlands of Ballineaspigbeg and Ballineaspigmore (sometimes spelled Ballinaspigmore). It is near the city of Ballincollig, a satellite of Cork City, and is home to a number of schools and colleges, Though it is sometimes suggested that the name of the area derives from an early 18th-century bishop who built his country residence there, the name can be reputedly traced back further and found in sources dating to the 16th century.
