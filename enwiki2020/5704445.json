In the years 1927-1952 the company operated under the name Powszechny Zak\u0142ad Ubezpiecze\u0144 Wzajemnych and between 1952-1990 it was known as Pa\u0144stwowy Zak\u0142ad Ubezpiecze\u0144 (State Insurance Company) as it was officially given a monopoly by the state and effectively became the largest insurance company in the country. In 1991 PZU was turned into a joint stock company controlled by the state Treasury as a consequence of the political transformation after 1989. In December 1991, the PZU \u017bycie joint stock company was founded by polski Bank Rozwoju and Bank Handlowy in Warsaw. The PZU transferred its portfolio of life insurance contracts for PZU \u017bycie. In 1998, in relation with the reform of the pension insurance system in Poland, PZU \u017bycie formed PTE PZU, a joint stock company, which operates the OFE PZU (Open Pension Fund). On November 5, 1999, a share purchase agreement was concluded under which Eureko and BIG Bank Gda\u0144ski SA acquired 20% and 10% respectively of the share capital of PZU. A dispute arose in connection with the implementation of the agreement, which was settled amicably in October 2009. A settlement and sale agreement were concluded between the parties. === Over the years === In 2002, the PZU Group started its activities on the Lithuanian insurance market by acquiring shares in UAB DK \u201cLindra\u201d (PZU Lietuva). With the acquisition in OAO \u201cSkide West\u201d (PZU Ukraina) in 2005, it began operations on the Ukrainian market again. In the first half of 2008 PZU Group received 11,882.5 million Polish zloty in insurance premiums. This is an increase of 50.6% over the same period in 2007. PZU was first quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in May 2010.
