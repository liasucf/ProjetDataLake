In 1950, a year after her graduation from high school, Morgan made a recording of \"Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries\" issued by Derby Records, which made it to #26 on the U.S. Billboard record chart. Soon after, she received an RCA Victor recording contract, and she had five hits in one year, including her biggest hit \"That's All I Want from You\", which reached #3 on the chart.
