    "text": "Sean N\u00f3s and Sean-n\u00f3s Activities refers to the Irish traditional activities in the \"Old Style,\" such as Sean-n\u00f3s song and Sean-n\u00f3s dance. When the words Sean N\u00f3s are used in isolation, the general connotation is to anything Irish in an \"old style\"\u2014as opposed to the \"new way.\" When referring in isolation to just \"Sean N\u00f3s,\" the term frequently means Sean-n\u00f3s song in particular. However, other \"old style\" Irish cultural activities exist as well, such as Sean-n\u00f3s dance. == The terms \"Sean N\u00f3s\" and \"Sean-N\u00f3s\" activities == Non-English words\u2014and the associated foreign characters or diacriticals (the \"fada,\" accent mark, or other symbols added to the \"base letter\" to indicate the specific character or phoneme)\u2014can be confusing to non-native speakers or readers. The Irish Gaelic phrase \"Sean N\u00f3s\" is a prime example. * In the Irish Gaelic Language, the word \"sean\" means \"old\" and \"n\u00f3s\" means \"style.\" Therefore, \"sean n\u00f3s\" means \"old style\" (noun form)\u2014as contrasted to \"n\u00f3s nua,\" which means \"new way.\" Sean-nos Singing - A Bluffers Guide, Anthony McCann * Sean-n\u00f3s dance therefore refers to old-style dance (where addition of the \"-\" between the words indicates the adjectival form). * The phrase \"an sean n\u00f3s\" means \"the old way.\" * The phrase \"ar an sean n\u00f3s\" means \"in the old style.\" ==See also== * Sean-n\u00f3s song * Sean-n\u00f3s dance * Sean-n\u00f3s dance in America * Irish Dance == References == Category:Irish language Category:Irish music Category:Irish dance ",
