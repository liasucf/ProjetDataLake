It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. == History == == Description == ;Garden The 1985 garden still exhibits its early planning with many original trees surviving. There is a fine cast iron picket fence, on a stone foundation with impressive cast-rion entry gates. A curved entry driveway is planted with pygmy date palms (Phoenix roebelenii).Brooks, 1985, added to by Read, S., 2004 === Condition === As at 13 December 2004, in 1985 the item's condition was basically \"derelict\"; \"poor condition particularly internally of the house, detracts from its significance the dilapidated condition and extensive reconstruction required, conservation should take place within a framework of adaptation to a compatible use as a means to generate the necessary funding. Several large trees have died The front garden still exhibits its early planning with many original trees survivingThe front fence and gates are in reasonable order ground levels around the rear of the house and heavy undergrowth are exacerbating the problems of rising damp in the adjacent rooms...Brooks, 1985 === Modifications and dates === *1985 (quoting) several large trees have died *1986 adaptively reused and extended for office use *2004 skylight inserted === Further information === The poor condition particularly internally of the house, detracts from its significance, which as a result, is derived largely from its surviving form and massing. Conservation is however desirable to retain its key place in the streetscape and recover its architectural character and detailing. Given the dilapidated condition and extensive reconstruction required, conservation should take place within a framework of adaptation to a compatible use as a means to generate the necessary funding. Strict reconstruction or reinstatement of original detailing is not necessary and may be impractical given the extent of demolition and possible lack of documentary evidence. Reconstruction shall however be in a form which respects and largely replicates the finishes and decorative elements which could have been expected in a house of this quality in the mid 1880s. Where physical evidence survives, renewed detailing should follow, as closely as practical, the original. New services should be discretely inserted. External works shall respect the character of the original landscaping, in particular the curving front entry and palm trees. Car parking shall be located at the side of the house, in a way which minimises the visual impact. The front fence and entry gates shall be retained or reused to suit new entry requirements. The most appropriate and compatible use for Kailoa would be one which retains the essential external formand intenral arrangement of spaces. Such uses could include residential, cultural or community uses, an art gallery or small scale commercial functions. The overall impact of such uses should minimise changes to the fabric and setting. == Heritage listing == Heritage boundaries As at 13 December 2004, Kailoa forms an integral and important part of an area with a rich and varied collection of residential architecture, the adjacent streets being a rare survival of intact 19th century townscape in North Sydney. It is a good example of its type and has retained its garden setting, being a single storey free standing Victorian Italianate villa, () set well back from the street on a prominent hill to the rear in landscaped grounds with a fair number of mature trees and well maintained garden setting. It is of state historic and social significance for its associational values and representative aesthetic values of this type of place. It is of regional historic, social and associative aesthetic significance as a representative example of its period and type. The poor condition particularly internally of the house, detracts from its significance, which as a result, is derived largely from its surviving form and massing.(1985) Brooks, 1985; Taylor Brammer, 2004 & Adameitis, 2004; abridged by S.Read, 2004 Kailoa was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. == References == === Bibliography === * * * === Attribution === Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:North Sydney, New South Wales Category:Houses in New South Wales Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Italianate architecture in Sydney Category:1880s establishments in Australia ",
