    "text": "Lucas Bruera (born 19 October 1997) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Villa D\u00e1lmine. ==Club career== Bruera's career began with ADAFI and Estudiantes. Nelson Vivas selected the goalkeeper on the bench versus Rosario Central on 15 October 2016, though he never made a competitive appearance. In January 2017, Bruera moved across the Primera Divisi\u00f3n to Independiente. In July 2018, Bruera was signed by Chacarita Juniors of Primera B Nacional. He had almost signed with Gimnasia y Esgrima, but the move fell through after derogatory comments Bruera made about the club on Twitter whilst with rivals Estudiantes. Having been an unused substitute fourteen times in 2018\u201319, his bow came in March 2019 against Nueva Chicago. After making five further appearances for Chacarita in 2018\u201319, the goalkeeper didn't appear competitively in 2019\u201320. August 2020 saw Bruera join Villa D\u00e1lmine. ==International career== Bruera had experience at U20 level with Argentina. He was a part of their squad for the 2016 L'Alc\u00fadia International Tournament in Spain; where they finished as runners-up. ==Personal life== Bruera is the nephew of former La Plata mayor Pablo Bruera. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Estudiantes |rowspan=\"2\"|2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"3\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Independiente |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2017\u201318 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Chacarita Juniors |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera B Nacional |6||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||6||0 |- |2019\u201320 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !6!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!6!!0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Villa D\u00e1lmine |2020\u201321 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Nacional |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !6!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!6!!0 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from La Plata Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Estudiantes de La Plata footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente footballers Category:Chacarita Juniors footballers Category:Villa D\u00e1lmine footballers ",
