In the First World War he was a conscientious objector, and imprisoned in Bedford and Reading gaols. He is now known for his works about George Bernard Shaw, and his life of Henry Salt. He married the artist Clara Birnberg (1894-1989); they both became Quakers. She as Clare Winsten is known for some sculptures, including one of St. Joan in the garden of Shaw\u2019s house in Ayot St Lawrence in Hertfordshire, where Shaw and the Winstens were neighbours. Stephen's and Clara's daughter Ruth Harrison, a conscientious objector in WW2, was known as a campaigner for animal rights. == Works == * G.B.S. 90: Aspects of Bernard Shaw's Life and Work (1946); editor * Days with Bernard Shaw (1948) * Salt and His Circle (1951); preface by Shaw * Shaw's Corner (1952) * Jesting Apostle: The Private Life of Bernard Shaw (1956) == External links == * Jewish Quarterly article on the Whitechapel Boys Category:1893 births Category:1991 deaths Category:English biographers Category:British conscientious objectors Category:British emigrants to the United States Category:American Quakers Category:Converts to Quakerism from Judaism Category:Converts to Quakerism Category:English Jews Category:British Jewish writers Category:Whitechapel Boys Category:People from Ayot St Lawrence ",
