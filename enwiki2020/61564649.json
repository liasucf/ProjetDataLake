Siingh (Mobius Films) and Annand Chavan (OMG), co-produced by Vinayak Gawande and Jayesh Parekh and co-directed by Tanvi Jain. The film featuring Boman Irani, Tannishtha Chatterjee, Divya Dutta and Sanjay Suri, follows a 9-year-old street girl Jhalki, setting out to find her 7-year-old brother against the backdrop of the child slavery trade. The trailer of the film was released at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2019. The film has been premiered at various national and international film festivals and won 13 awards so far. It was released theatrically in India on 14 November 2019. ==Synopsis== A life-altering disappearance of her 7-year old brother sets Jhalki off on a mission to find him at all costs. Armed with an intimate folk-tale and her own sharp mind, is Jhalki's journey the start of a spiral that will change the lives of thousands for good? What price must she pay to get what she wants? Inspired by true events, with a backdrop of human- trafficking and child-labour, Jhalki becomes an atypical thriller of hope, courage, self-belief and perseverance, seen through the eyes of a 9-year-old girl, who will not stop anywhere short of a triumph. == Cast == * Boman Irani as Kailash Satyarthi * Tannishtha Chatterjee as Priti Vyas * Divya Dutta as Sunita Bhartiya * Sanjay Suri as DM Sanjay Bhartiya *Joy Sengupta as SDM Akhilesh * Bachan Pachehra as Rahim Chacha * Akhilendra Mishra as Shivlal Chakiya * Govind Namdev as RamPrasad *Yatin Karyekar as Sipahi * Vikram Singh as Lakhna * Sanchita Goswami as Phullorani *Aarti Jha as Jhalki * Goraksha Sakpal as Babu * Sailesh Dubey as Mohan * Kailash Satyarthi (Special Appearance) as himself *Mahesh Chandra Deva as shivlal chakiya men's-1 == Location == The film was shot in and around Mirzapur (Uttar Pradesh) and in Film City (Mumbai). ==Release and Promotion.== Jhalki was released nationwide (theatrically) by Panorama Studios on 14 November 2019 (Children's Day).
