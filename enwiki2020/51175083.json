    "text": "The Hjelm Range () is a mountain range in the Gauss Peninsula, King Christian X Land, northeastern Greenland. Administratively this range is part of the Northeast Greenland National Park zone. The range was named by the 1931 - 1934 Three-year Expedition to East Greenland following a suggestion by expedition member Thyge Johansen, who said that the rounded mountaintops reminded him of the helmets worn by Roman soldiers. ==Geography== The Hjelm Range is a mountain chain located in the southern part of the Gauss Peninsula stretching roughly from NW to SE along the coast of the Kaiser Franz Joseph Fjord.
