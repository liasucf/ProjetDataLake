Visit the website at http://www.timourhall.com Johan Georg Lochner of Mannheim, Germany, was awarded this smallholding on the Diep River in 1784. He is the ancestor of a prominent, eponymous family in South Africa. In 1878, William Duckitt's granddaughter, Aletta Jacoba Smith, purchased the property and gave it its current name. Much of the original land from the original driveway on the right side of the highway to along what is now Timour Hall Road was lost to urban sprawl. The home was built in the Victorian style with a Cape Dutch flair. A large porch lies in front, and several outbuildings are in the back. Its architectural significance led the Government of the Western Cape to declare the property a heritage site. == Bibliography == * Fransen, Hans (2004).
