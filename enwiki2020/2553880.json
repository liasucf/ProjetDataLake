    "text": "Huang Chun-ming Huang Chun-ming (; born 13 February 1935) is a Taiwanese literary figure and teacher. Huang writes mainly about the tragic and sometimes humorous lives of ordinary Taiwanese people, and many of his short stories have been turned into films, including The Sandwich Man (1983). ==Career== Born in Rat\u014d Town, Taihoku Prefecture, Japanese Taiwan (modern-day Luodong, Yilan, Taiwan), Huang began his higher education career at a college in Taipei but, after a series of transfers, ended up graduating from National Pingtung University of Education in southern Taiwan. He is a writer of broad interests and remarkable versatility, but he is first of all a short story writer. During the 1960s as a major contributor to the influential Literature Quarterly, Huang was hailed as a representative of the Taiwan Nativist Literature movement that focused on the lives of rural Taiwanese people. In more recent works he has turned his attention to urban culture and life in Taiwan's growing cities. Starting in the 1990s, he established and has written for and directed the Big Fish Children's Theater Troupe (\u9ec3\u5927\u9b5a\u5152\u7ae5\u5287\u5718). Huang was awarded the for Literature in 1997. He opened a cafe and salon in his native Yilan, operating it for three years before closing it in December 2015. == Influences == Huang has said that in his early years he had limited access to literature in Chinese and that significant influences were Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea and \"The Killers\"; Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and \"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\"; William Faulkner's \"A Rose for Emily,\" \"The Bear,\" The Wild Palms, and other American literature. Two other important influences were an anthology of short stories by Shen Congwen and a Chinese translation of stories by Anton Chekhov.Author's preface to the collection of English language translations of stories, The Taste of Apples, pp. xiv-xv. ==English translations== The major translation of Huang's work into English is The Taste of Apples (Howard Goldblatt trans). New York: Columbia University Press, 2001. (The Taste of Apples was previously published in a slightly different form as The Drowning of an Old Cat and Other Stories, (Howard Goldblatt trans.).
