    "text": "Antoine Dauvergne (3 October 1713 - 11 February 1797) was a French composer and violinist. Dauvergne was born in Moulins, Allier. He served as master of the Chambre du roi, director of the Concert Spirituel from 1762 to 1771, and director of the Op\u00e9ra three times between 1769 and 1790. Dauvergne contributed both as a performer and composer to the classical music at the court at Versailles. He is most famous as the composer of Les troqueurs, a work which had a major influence on the development of French op\u00e9ra comique. He died, aged 83, in Lyon. In addition to operas and opera-ballets, Dauvergne composed a number of other works including violin sonatas (1739), trio sonatas, motets, and what he called Concerts de Simphonies (1751). The name Dauvergne is sometimes written D'Auvergne. It means \"from Auvergne,\" the region in the center of France covered by the volcanic Massif Central mountain range. ==List of works== ===Operas and ballets=== *Les amours de Temp\u00e9, ballet h\u00e9ro\u00efque (1752, Paris) *Les troqueurs, interm\u00e8de (1753, Paris) *La coquette tromp\u00e9e, com\u00e9die lyrique (1753, Fontainebleau) *La sibylle, ballet (1753, Fontainebleu) *\u00c9n\u00e9e et Lavinie, trag\u00e9die lyrique (1758, Paris) *Les f\u00eates d'Euterpe, op\u00e9ra- ballet (1758, Paris) *Le rival favorable, additional entr\u00e9e for Les f\u00eates d'Euterpe (1760, Paris) *Canente, trag\u00e9die (1760, Paris) *Hercule mourant, trag\u00e9die lyrique (1761, Paris) *Alph\u00e9e et Ar\u00e9thuse, ballet (1762, Paris) *Polix\u00e8ne, trag\u00e9die lyrique (1763, Paris) *Le triomphe de flore, ou Le retour de printemps, ballet-h\u00e9ro\u00efque (1765, Fontainebleau) *La v\u00e9nitienne, com\u00e9die- ballet (1768, Paris) *La tour enchant\u00e9e, ballet figur\u00e9 (1770, Paris) *Le prix de la valeur, ballet h\u00e9ro\u00efque (1771, Paris) *La sicilien, ou L'amour peintre, com\u00e9die-ballet (1780, Versailles) *La mort d'Orph\u00e9e, trag\u00e9die (unperformed) *S\u00e9miramis, trag\u00e9die (unperformed) ==Discography== *Musique \u00e0 Versailles - Dauvergne: Concerts de Simphonies.
