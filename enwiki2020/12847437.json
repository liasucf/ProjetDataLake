The ' is the largest plain in Japan, and is located in the Kant\u014d region of central Honsh\u016b. The total area 17,000 km2 covers more than half of the region extending over Tokyo, Saitama Prefecture, Kanagawa Prefecture, Chiba Prefecture, Gunma Prefecture, Tochigi Prefecture and Ibaraki Prefecture.Encyclopedia of Japan, K\u014ddansha The northern limit borders on the Abukuma Highlands, Yamizo Mountain Range, Ashio Mountain Range, and a volcanic field associated with the Nasu Volcanic Belt. The western coincides with the Kant\u014d Mountain Range and the southern edge is defined by the B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula, the Miura Hills, Tokyo Bay, and Sagami Bay. The Kashima Sea and Kuj\u016bkuri Beach define the eastern end of the plain. Most of the rivers originate in the northern or western mountain ranges and flow east or southeast into the Pacific Ocean, Tokyo Bay, or Sagami Bay. In the central part of the plain is the Tone River; in the northern part the Watarase River, Kinu River, Kokai River, Naka River, and Kuji River; and in the southern part the Arakawa River, Tama River, and Sagami River. Of these rivers, the Tone River encompasses a large area of floodplain, for it has the largest drainage area in Japan of . The drainage areas covered by these rivers account for the alluvial lowland of the Kant\u014d Plain.Encyclopedia of Japan Tokyo, K\u014ddansha A collection of plateaus constitute a large part of the plain. Among them are the \u014cmiya, Musashino, Sagamino, and J\u014ds\u014d Plateaus. These large plateaus are divided into smaller ones by shallow river valleys. One of the common features of the plateaus is that their surfaces are covered with a thick layer of loam of volcanic origin. Volcanic ashes from surrounding volcanoes, Mounts Asama, Haruna, and Akagi to the north and Mounts Hakone and Fuji to the southwest, are thought to have been deposited on these plateaus.Nihon Daihyakka Jiten, Sh\u014dgakkan Among the plateaus, the Musashino Plateau has the largest stretch of land, extending from the western edge of \u014cme to the eastern edge of Yamanote which borders the alluvial plains of the Arakawa and Sumida Rivers. Its elevation gradually declines from west to east, measuring 190 m at \u014cme and 20 m at Yamanote.Nihon Daihyakka Jiten, Sh\u014dgakkan Hills in the Kant\u014d Plain stand on Tertiary strata and rise higher than surrounding plateaus, exemplified by the Sayama Hills and Tama Hills, typically, undulating between 100 and 200 m above sea level. Hills located at the western edge of the Kant\u014d Plain, the Hiki Hills, Koma Hills, Kusahana Hills, and Kaji Hills, also reach approximately above sea level.Encyclopedia of Japan Tokyo, K\u014ddansha What is noteworthy is the overall tilt of the plateaus and hills. In general, the whole area is slightly bent and forming a basin centered in the Tone River and Tokyo Bay. The ongoing process of tectonic extension continues as the plain's central region gradually sinks.Encyclopedia of Japan Tokyo, K\u014ddansha The Kant\u014d Plain witnessed its greatest devastation from an earthquake on 1 September 1923, with a death toll calculated of 142,807. ==References== Category:Plains of Japan Category:Landforms of Tokyo Category:Landforms of Saitama Prefecture Category:Landforms of Kanagawa Prefecture Category:Landforms of Chiba Prefecture Category:Landforms of Gunma Prefecture Category:Landforms of Tochigi Prefecture ",
