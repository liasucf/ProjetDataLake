She was born Sarah Trevor Teasdale in St. Louis, Missouri, and used the name Sara Teasdale Filsinger after her marriage in 1914.Collection of Teasdale's letters in the Berg Collection at the New York Public Library. ==Biography== Photograph of Sara Teasdale as a young girl Teasdale was born on August 8, 1884. She had poor health for much of her childhood, so she was home schooled until age 9. It was at age 10 that she was well enough to begin school. She started at Mary Institute in 1898, but switched to Hosmer Hall in 1899, graduating in 1903. The Teasdale family lived at 3668 Lindell Blvd. and then 38 Kingsbury Place in St. Louis, Missouri. Both homes were designed by Sara's mother. The house on Kingsbury Place had a private suite for Sara on the second floor. Guests entered through a separate entrance and were admitted by appointment. This suite is where Sara worked, slept, and often dined alone. From 1904 to 1907, Teasdale was a member of The Potters, led by Lillie Rose Ernst, a group of female artists in their late teens and early twenties who published, from 1904 to 1907, The Potter's Wheel, a monthly artistic and literary magazine in St. Louis. Teasdale's first poem was published in William Marion Reedy's Reedy's Mirror, a local newspaper, in 1907. Her first collection of poems, Sonnets to Duse and Other Poems, was published that same year. Sara Teasdale, 1907 Missouri History Museum Photograph and Print Collection. Portraits n38637 Teasdale's second collection, Helen of Troy and Other Poems, was published in 1911. It was well received by critics, who praised its lyrical mastery and romantic subject matter. From 1911 to 1914 Teasdale was courted by several men, including the poet Vachel Lindsay, who was truly in love with her but did not feel that he could provide enough money or stability to keep her satisfied. She chose to marry Ernst Filsinger, a longtime admirer of her poetry, on December 19, 1914. Teasdale's third poetry collection, Rivers to the Sea, was published in 1915. It was and is a bestseller, being reprinted several times. In 1916 she and Filsinger moved to New York City, where they lived in an Upper West Side apartment on Central Park West. In 1918 she won a Pulitzer Prize for her 1917 poetry collection Love Songs. It was \"made possible by a special grant from The Poetry Society\"; however, the sponsoring organization now lists it as the earliest Pulitzer Prize for Poetry (inaugurated 1922).\"Poetry\".

Filsinger's constant business travel caused Teasdale much loneliness.Letters from Sara Teasdale to Mr. Braithwaite expressing her loneliness can be accessed at the Berg Collection. In 1929, she moved interstate for three months, thereby satisfying the criteria to gain a divorce. She did not wish to inform Filsinger, only doing so at her lawyers' insistence as the divorce was going through. Filsinger was shocked. After the divorce she moved only two blocks from her old home on Central Park West. She rekindled her friendship with Vachel Lindsay, who was now married with children. In 1933, she died by suicide, overdosing on sleeping pills. Lindsay had died by suicide two years earlier. She is interred in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. == Teasdale's suicide and \"I Shall Not Care\" == A common urban legend surrounds Teasdale's suicide. The poem \"I Shall Not Care\" was speculated to be her suicide note because of its depressing undertone. The legend claims that her poem \"I Shall Not Care\" (which features themes of abandonment, bitterness, and contemplation of death) was penned as a suicide note to a former lover.Rare Newspapers However, the poem was actually first published in her 1915 collection Rivers to the Sea, a full 18 years before her suicide: ;I Shall Not Care WHEN I am dead and over me bright April ::Shakes out her rain-drenched hair, :Tho' you should lean above me broken-hearted, :::I shall not care. I shall have peace, as leafy trees are peaceful :::When rain bends down the bough, :And I shall be more silent and cold-hearted :::Than you are now. ==Legacy and influence== Sarony photo, Notable women of St. Louis, 1914 * The poem \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" from her 1920 collection Flame and Shadow inspired and is featured in a famous short story of the same name by Ray Bradbury. * Teasdale is the favorite poet of Arlington LeGrande, the main character of Jacquelyn Mitchard's novel The Most Wanted. * Teasdale's poems \"The New Moon\", \"Only in Sleep\" and \"Stars\" were set as choral pieces by \u0112riks E\u0161envalds, a Latvian composer, for Musica Baltica. \"Stars\" has become widely known for its use of crystal glasses for a soothing sound of the 'stars'.https://www.musicabaltica.com/en/composers-and- authors/eriks-esenvalds/https://www.eriksesenvalds.com/works *I Shall Not Care from the 1915 Collected Poems appeared in the 1966 young adult novel Up a Road Slowly by Irene Hunt. * In 1967 Tom Rapp and the group Pearls Before Swine recorded a musical rendition of \"I Shall Not Care\" on their first album One Nation Underground. * In 1994, she was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. * In 2008, \"There Will Come Soft Rains\" was included in Fallout 3 alongside Ray Bradbury's short story of the same name.
