    "text": "Sexo, pudor y l\u00e1grimas (Sex, Shame, and Tears) is a Mexican film, the second of the so-called New Era of the Cinema of Mexico (the first one was Like Water for Chocolate) and the directorial debut of Antonio Serrano. The film is based on the successful play of the same name, which ran for two consecutive years and was written by Serrano himself. After the film was released it broke box- office records in Mexico (MX$118 million, roughly US$10.9 million), it was shown for more than twenty-seven weeks, and was seen by more than eight million people in Mexico alone. The film won five Ariel Awards. , Sexo, pudor y l\u00e1grimas still held the record as Mexico's highest-grossing film of all time. ==Plot== Tom\u00e1s returns to Mexico after a seven-year trip around the world to visit his friends Carlos and Ana, a couple going through relationship problems. Ana is seduced by Tom\u00e1s, who is also her ex-boyfriend, which causes Carlos to kick Tom\u00e1s out of their home. Although instead of Tom\u00e1s leaving, Ana leaves and moves across the street to the apartment of their friends Miguel and Andrea, another couple going through problems. The situation becomes a battle of the sexes when Miguel is kicked-out for cheating on Andrea and sent to live with the \"guys\" across the street and Mar\u00eda, their friend, joins the \"girls\" in a boycott against all men. Tomas then has a fling with Andrea and gets caught in the act. After seeing the emptiness of his life, punctuated with him making a scene at a local nightclub, Tomas declares his love for Ana before apparently committing suicide by walking into an elevator shaft. ===Alternate endings=== In the Region 4 DVD version, several alternate final scenes are explored, including Tomas surviving the fall and emerging in a full body cast. ==Cast== * Demi\u00e1n Bichir as Tom\u00e1s * Susana Zabaleta as Ana * Jorge Salinas as Miguel * Cecilia Su\u00e1rez as Andrea * V\u00edctor Huggo Martin as Carlos * M\u00f3nica Dionne as Mar\u00eda ==Awards== * Silver Ariels from the Mexican Academy of Film: ** Best actress: (Susana Zabaleta) ** Art direction: (Brigitte Broch) ** Best original score ** Best original script ** ambientaci\u00f3n *Audience Award (XIV Guadalajara Film Festival) ==References== ==External links== * * *Review on the New York Times site *20 questions to Susana Zabaleta * DVD review * Profile on Zinema.com * Sexo, pudor y l\u00e1grimas on the Mexican cinema site of ITESM Category:1999 plays Category:1999 films Category:1999 comedy films Category:Mexican films Category:Mexican plays Category:Spanish-language films Category:Estudios Churubusco films ",
