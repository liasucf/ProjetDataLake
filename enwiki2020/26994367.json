Beginning in the 2001\u20132002 season, he competed in juvenile men's singles for two seasons, in the intermediate ranks for two seasons, and then as a novice for two seasons; he won the novice men's silver medal at the 2007 U.S. Championships. Johnson debuted on the ISU Junior Grand Prix (JGP) series in autumn 2007. The following season, he won two JGP medals \u2014 gold in the Czech Republic and bronze in England \u2014 and qualified for the ISU Junior Grand Prix Final, where he finished sixth. He received the junior bronze medal at the 2009 U.S. Championships. Johnson also trained in pair skating. He competed with Chelsey Jernberg in the juvenile category at the 2004 and 2005 U.S. Junior Championships. With Danielle Viola, he placed 6th in the novice ranks at the 2012 U.S. Championships. === Senior career === Johnson began competing in the senior men's category in the 2009\u20132010 season. He made his senior international debut at the 2009 Finlandia Trophy. At the 2013 U.S. Championships, Johnson finished seventh after placing 12th in the short program and fifth in the free skate. He landed a 3Lz-1Lo-3F in the free skate. He then won silver at the 2013 International Challenge Cup in The Hague, Netherlands. He was coached mainly by Tom Dickson and Catarina Lindgren, and also worked once a week with Christy Krall.

He returned to the ice after ten weeks and resumed full training in April 2014 with a titanium screw in his ankle. Johnson finished 11th at the 2015 U.S. Championships. In the summer of 2015, he underwent surgery for multiple hernias.
