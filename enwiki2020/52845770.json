    "text": "The Chatham Island merganser or Chatham merganser (Mergus milleneri) is an extinct species of merganser duck. The Chatham Islands merganser is known only from fossils and not much is known about the bird. It was the smallest of all Mergus species. Fossil records indicate it was widespread on Chatham Island but not on the smaller nearby islands. The binomial name refers to Dr Philip Millener, to recognise his work in collecting material on the species. == See also == Auckland merganser == References == Category:Mergus Category:Late Quaternary prehistoric birds Category:Quaternary birds of Oceania Category:Birds of the Chatham Islands Category:Extinct birds of New Zealand Category:Extinct birds of subantarctic islands Category:Holocene extinctions Category:Birds described in 2014 Category:Fossil taxa described in 2014 ",
