    "text": "Carry the Day is an album by Henry Threadgill released on the Columbia label in 1995. The album features six of Threadgill's compositions performed by Threadgill's Very Very Circus with guest artists.Backstrom, L. & Lopez, R. Henry Threadgill discography accessed February 3, 2010 ==Reception== Allmusic awarded the album 4\u00bd stars and the review by Scott Yanow stated \"This unique music takes several listens to absorb and even then it still might be somewhat incomprehensible\".Wynn, R. [ Allmusic Review] accessed February 3, 2010. In the Los Angeles Times Don Heckman wrote \"if you\u2019d like to sample the work of a composer-saxophonist who has consistently stretched the outer limits of jazz (even if he doesn\u2019t care to have the word applied to his music), here\u2019s a perfect opportunity ... It all sounds very sudden, spontaneous and random, which probably pleases Threadgill greatly. Among his many other accomplishments, the one that is most apparent in this creatively demanding album is the capacity to compose music that possesses the impetuous, unexpected energy of an improvised solo\".Heckman, D. LA Times Review, accessed July 29, 2019 People said \"Henry Threadgill\u2019s music has always been an anomaly, but over the years, the eclectic composer-saxophonist has produced some beautiful and wildly original music. This is true once again with Carry the Day, Threadgill\u2019s first release on a major label ... this is an impressive album by an innovative, important musician who takes chances but never loses his integrity\u2014or his wit\".Picks and Pans Review: Carry the Day, People, accessed July 29, 2019 ==Track listing== All compositions by Henry Threadgill. # \"Come Carry the Day\" \u2013 6:06 # \"Growing a Big Banana\" \u2013 3:26 # \"Vivjanrondirski\" \u2013 5:55 # \"Between Orchids Lillies Blind Eyes and Crickets\" \u2013 7:45 # \"Hyla Crucifer...
