    "text": "Gino Louis Torretta (born August 10, 1970) is a former American college and professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for five seasons. He played college football for the University of Miami, won the Heisman Trophy in 1992, and was a member of the Miami Hurricanes' national championship teams of 1989 and 1991. A seventh-round pick in the 1993 NFL Draft, he was a member of several NFL teams, but never became a regular starter as a pro. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2010. ==Early years== Torretta was born in Pinole, California. He graduated from Pinole Valley High School, where he was a standout high school football quarterback for the Pinole Spartans. ==College career== Torretta accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Miami, where he played for the Miami Hurricanes football team from 1989 to 1992. ===1989 and 1990 seasons=== As a quarterback for the Hurricanes, Torretta spent his first two seasons mostly on the bench behind then starting quarterback Craig Erickson, with his only significant playing time coming with three starts in 1989 after Erickson injured his throwing hand. During that span, however, the then-unknown Torretta lit up San Diego State for 485 yards, setting a school record for most passing yards in a game that was only broken on September 29, 2012 by Stephen Morris. ===1991 season=== In his first year as a starter, Torretta garnered further attention by stealing the show in a nationally televised 1991 game versus the Houston Cougars and their Heisman-frontrunning quarterback, David Klingler. As Miami's defense cut down Houston's run-and- shoot offense, Torretta put on the performance that many expected out of Klingler en route to a 40\u201310 victory; Klingler's lone touchdown pass in the game came with three seconds left in the fourth quarter against Miami's third- string defense, long after the game was decided. Torretta went on to lead Miami to a fourth-quarter comeback win on the road versus #1 Florida State and ultimately to an undefeated season and a co-national championship. ===1992 season=== Torretta passed for more than 3,000 yards his senior year in 1992 on his way to winning the Heisman Trophy and the Davey O'Brien Award that season. He also won the Walter Camp Award, the Maxwell Award, the Johnny Unitas Trophy and the Chic Harley Award. One of the key games of the season came against West Virginia when he threw for 363 yards and two touchdowns in the 35\u201323 victory. His career as quarterback at Miami was hugely successful, with Torretta leading the team to 26 wins and only one loss. That one loss came in the 1993 Sugar Bowl, in which Torretta's Hurricanes were dominated by the Alabama Crimson Tide's defense. Torretta was flummoxed by Alabama's 11-man fronts, and threw three interceptions after only throwing four all season. Alabama won the game, 34\u201313, and the national championship. ===Statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Comp. ! Att. ! Comp % ! Passing ! TD !

He was not selected until the Minnesota Vikings took him in the seventh round in the 1993 NFL draft and then did not play him at all that year. In 1994, Torretta was on the Vikings' roster, and then was picked up by the Detroit Lions. As was the case in 1993, he failed to play at all in 1994, serving the entire season in a backup role with the Lions. ===1995\u20131997=== In 1995, Torretta moved to NFL Europe and was also on the roster for the San Francisco 49ers and Detroit Lions but was again relegated to backup roles. He was cut by the 49ers in 1996 and subsequently picked up by the Seattle Seahawks. His only chance to play in an NFL game came in the 1996 season finale when he came off the bench for the Seahawks against the Oakland Raiders. He immediately threw a 32-yard touchdown pass to Joey Galloway that put Seattle ahead, leading the team to victory. In 1997, Torretta was on the roster for Seattle and later the Indianapolis Colts but again did not play. After the 1997 season, he retired from the NFL. ==Post-NFL career== Torretta followed his NFL career with a position at Wachovia Securities as a Senior Financial Advisor. He is Chairman/CEO of Touchdown Radio, broadcasting an NCAA game of the week on national radio. He is also an NCAA football expert on Sirius/XM channel 91\u2014College Sports Nation. Torretta is Vice President for GAMCO Asset Management, working with Institutional clients nationwide and working out of the firm's Palm Beach office. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:All-American college football players Category:American football quarterbacks Category:American people of Italian descent Category:College football announcers Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Detroit Lions players Category:Heisman Trophy winners Category:Indianapolis Colts players Category:Miami Hurricanes football players Category:Minnesota Vikings players Category:People from Pinole, California Category:Players of American football from California Category:Rhein Fire players Category:Seattle Seahawks players Category:San Francisco 49ers players ",
