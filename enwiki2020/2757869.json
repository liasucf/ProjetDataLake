    "text": "Bertrand Ice Piedmont is an ice piedmont about long and from wide, lying between Rymill Bay and Mikkelsen Bay on the Falli\u00e8res Coast of Graham Land. Bertrand Ice Piedmont is bounded on the southeast side by Pavie Ridge and on the northeast side by Black Thumb. It was surveyed in 1936 by the British Graham Land Expedition under John Riddoch Rymill, and resurveyed in 1948\u20131949 by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-names Committee after Kenneth J. Bertrand (1910\u20131978), Professor of Geography, at The Catholic University of America, Washington, D.C. A geomorphologist and Antarctic historian, Bertrand was a member of the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (1947\u20131973), and chairman 1962\u20131973. His Americans in Antarctica, 1775\u20131948, published in 1971, is the most extensive and authoritative account of American involvement in the Antarctic. == See also == * List of glaciers == Further reading == \u2022 Defense Mapping Agency 1992, Sailing Directions (planning Guide) and (enroute) for Antarctica, P 152 \u2022 Jane G.
