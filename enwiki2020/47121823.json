    "text": "is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kohske. It has been published in Shinchosha's Monthly Comic @BUNCH magazine since 2011. The series has inspired a spin-off manga, an audio drama series, an anime television series, and an original novel. ==Review== The series revolves around two \"Handymen\" who take on jobs for both the mob and the police force that no one else can handle. The two, named Worick Arcangelo and Nicolas Brown, work in the town of Ergastulum, which is full of mafia, hoodlums, prostitutes, and dirty cops. After a job of crushing a gang, Worick decided to spare and help the (amnesiac) sole survivor, Alex, under their wing for the time being. ==Characters== ===Main characters=== ;Worick Arcangelo : : (formerly Wallace Arcangelo) is Nic's partner. He has been a gigolo since he was thirteen, and views it as his main job. Nic worked as Worick's personal guard, bearing witness to the abuse his father put him through. Nic killed Worick's abusive family (with Worick's permission) twenty-two years ago in a fit of psychotic rage after witnessing Worick's father press a lit cigarette into his left eye, which to this day he wears a patch over. He has hyperthymesia and carries a M1911A1 pistol. ;Nicolas Brown : :, or Nic, is a \"Twilight\", or someone with superhuman abilities gained from the drug Celebrer. Nic is the result of a former West Gate mercenary named Gaston Brown sleeping with a Twilight prostitute. Gaston had impregnated the prostitute for the sole purpose of avoiding the expense of hiring a Tagged mercenary, and murdered the woman after Nic was born. Nic was abused by Gaston, who saw him as nothing more than a monster. He is deaf, and communicates primarily through sign language, but has exceptionally strong vision and lip reading skills. As a child mercenary, he was hired by the Arcangelo family to be Worick's bodyguard. Like all Twilights, he is identified by the dog tags that he wears. With his natural ability, he is a B/5 level Twilight, but gains A/0 level by overdosing on Celebrer. ;Alex Benedetto : :, or Ally, is a former prostitute. She joins the Handymen after the police have Nic and Worick eliminate the gang she was working for, and Worick decides to spare her life. Alex was previously under the control of Barry Abbott, who is suspected to have drugged her to keep her submissive. She only remembers a few things, including her name, and later it is revealed that she is not from Ergustulum, the setting of this series and other reason she is not familiar with life in there. She is learning sign language in order to communicate better with Nic, and on several occasions has comforted Worick when the latter was in the throes of a nightmare. She is a calm, caring person who is unafraid of violence when Worick, Nic, or Nina, are threatened. She is revealed to be a talented singer and occasionally works for the Cristiano family in that capacity. She has a younger brother named Emilio, who she worked to support, but hasn't seen him since childhood. ===Supporting characters=== ;Dr. Theo : : is a doctor who supplies Nic and other Twilights with Celebrer and other treatments. He runs a small clinic in District 7 and tries to stay neutral between the rival gangs. He is missing two fingers on his left hand. Dr. Theo is a kind person except when his clinic and Nina are threatened. ;Nina : : is a young girl who works at Dr. Theo's clinic as a nurse, and is close friends with Worick and Nicolas. ;Chad Adkins : : is a police officer in Ergastulum. He hires Nic and Worick to do jobs for the police and often has to clean up their messes when they get into trouble. There are indications in the manga that when Nic and Worick were young teens that Adkins acted as a protector and surrogate father to them. ;Daniel Monroe : : is a mafia boss, and head of one of the three main 'gangs' in Ergastulum. He is Nic's former employer. ;Delico : : is a rank D/0 Twilight who works for the Monroe Family. ;Loretta Cristiano Amodio : : :Fourteen year old daughter of the former boss and current leader of the Cristiano family. She uses her family's resources to help Twilights in need. Her associates and de facto protectors are Marco Adriano (who has superhuman strength) and Galahad Woeher (a Twilight). ;Sir Gina Paulklee : : :Referred to as 'Sir' by her subordinates, she is a Twilight and head of the Paulklee Guild, which takes in rogue Twilights and hires them out. Gina believes strongly in the Three Laws that govern Twilights, which are based on Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics: No action can be taken against 'normals', obey your master, defend yourself. She is taller than Nic, which is something he comments that he hates. ;Ginger : : is a highly ranked Twilight and member of the Paulklee Guild. She is seemingly Gina Paulklee's lover. She is a rank S/5 Twilight. ;Doug : : is a rank A/0 Twilight, like Nic. He worked for the Paulklee Guild and was roommates with Galahad Woeher. ;Joel Raveau : : is an old woman who runs a shop in Ergastulum, and a frequent customer of the Handymen. ;Uranos Corsica : : is the head of the Corsica Family. He has a large scar on his forehead. He bears an intense dislike toward Twilights. ;Constance Raveau : : is the owner of a gun shop who is on friendly terms with the handymen. ==Media== ===Manga=== The manga, which is written and illustrated by Kohske, was launched in 2011 in Shinchosha's Monthly Comic @ Bunch magazine.

She was positive toward the characters and story, commenting that the author \"makes some interesting choices with her characters\", but felt the art was occasionally subpar, pointing out an image that was reused three times, and commented that the name of the city \"sounds like some sort of stomach disorder\". Reviewing the second volume, she remarked on improvements in the author's art style and praised the development of Worick, but criticized Alex's reduced presence. She was also positive toward the third volume, writing \"Gangsta. is so gritty that you kind of feel like brushing off your skin after reading it, but it's that way with a purpose that is starting to become clear and it's going to feel like a really long wait for volume four\". Reviewing the first three episodes of the anime, Gabriella Ekens stated that it was \"a languid execution of a promising story\". She also criticized the series' musical score and animation. She stated, however, that she was looking forward to the show, and that \"its flaws are as intriguing as its strengths.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2014 radio dramas Category:2015 Japanese television series endings Category:2015 Japanese novels Category:Adventure anime and manga Category:Organized crime in anime and manga Category:Anime series based on manga Category:Bandai Visual Category:Funimation Category:Japanese radio dramas Category:Japanese crime television series Category:Manglobe Category:Neo-noir Category:Shinchosha books Category:Shinchosha manga Category:Seinen manga Category:Thriller anime and manga Category:Viz Media manga ",
