    "text": "The Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi-\u015a\u0101stra (YBh, Sanskrit; Treatise on the Foundation for Yoga Practitioners) is a large and influential doctrinal compendium, associated with north Indian Sanskritic Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism (particularly Yog\u0101c\u0101ra).Kragh 2013, pp. 16, 25. According to Ulrich Timme Kragh, it is \"a massive treatise that brings together a wealth of material stemming from Mainstream as well as Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism.\"Kragh 2013, p. 231. ==History== The Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi is generally associated with the Indian Yog\u0101c\u0101ra school because it contains certain unique Yog\u0101c\u0101ra doctrines, like the eight consciousnesses and the \u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na (storehouse or foundational consciousness). According to Ulrich Timme Kragh, \"its overall objective seems to be to present a coherent structure of Buddhist yoga practice with the Mah\u0101y\u0101na path of the bodhisattva placed at the pinnacle of the system\", but substantial parts also deal with non-Mah\u0101y\u0101na \"mainstream\" practices. The text also shows strong affinity to the Abhidharma works of the Mainstream Buddhist Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da school, adopting many of its technical terminology and classifications of phenomena (dharmas).Ulrich Timme Kragh (editor), The Foundation for Yoga Practitioners: The Buddhist Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi Treatise and Its Adaptation in India, East Asia, and Tibet, Volume 1 Harvard University, Department of South Asian studies, 2013, p. 45. While it likely contains earlier materials, the YBh is thought to have reached its final redaction in the fourth century CE.Ulrich Timme Kragh (editor), The Foundation for Yoga Practitioners: The Buddhist Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi Treatise and Its Adaptation in India, East Asia, and Tibet, Volume 1 Harvard University, Department of South Asian studies, 2013, p. 26. Traditional sources name either the Indian thinker Asa\u1e45ga (ca. 300-350) or the bodhisattva Maitreya as author, but most modern scholars hold that it is a composite text with different chronological textual layers and various authors, though this does not rule out the possibility that Asa\u1e45ga was among them.Delhey, Martin, Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi, oxfordbibliographies.com, LAST MODIFIED: 26 JULY 2017, DOI: 10.1093/OBO/9780195393521-0248.Ulrich Timme Kragh (editor), The Foundation for Yoga Practitioners: The Buddhist Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi Treatise and Its Adaptation in India, East Asia, and Tibet, Volume 1 Harvard University, Department of South Asian studies, 2013, pp. 40, 53. According to scholars such as Changhwan Park and Robert Kritzer the YBh may have subtly influenced other North Indian Buddhist works such as the Abhidharmako\u015ba and the works of the Sautr\u0101ntika school. The YBh also exherted a strong influence on the later works of the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-Vij\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101da school, such as the Mah\u0101y\u0101nas\u016btr\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra, the Abhidharma- samuccaya and the Mah\u0101y\u0101nasa\u1e43graha.Kragh 2013, p. 233. Finally, the YBh also exherted a clear influence on the tantric tradition of Indian Buddhism of the sixth to fourteenth centuries (and the works of exegetes like Ratn\u0101kara\u015b\u0101nti), and the YBh is itself aware of the use of mantras and subjugation rituals that would become common to the tantric tradition.Kragh 2013, pp. 235-236. The YBh was studied and transmitted in East Asian Buddhist and Tibetan Buddhist translations. In China, it was the work of Xu\u00e1nz\u00e0ng (\u7384\u5958, 602?-664) that introduced the YBh in full.Kragh 2013, p. 239. It caused many debates, particularly around the notion that certain beings did not have the gotra, or spiritual disposition, to attain awakening.Kragh 2013, p. 242. By the end of the Sui dynasty (589-618), Buddhism within China had developed many distinct schools and traditions. In the words of Dan Lusthaus: The YBh was translated into Tibetan in the ninth century at Samye by Ye shes sde and Cog ro Klu'i rgyal mtshan working with the Indian pa\u1e47\u1e0ditas Praj\u00f1\u0101varman, Surendrabodhi, and Jinamitra.Kragh 2013, p. 245. The YBh remained influential in these traditions (for example, it is a major source of meditation instruction for Tsongkhapa's Lamrimchenmo), however, perhaps because of size and complexity, it was eventually abandoned in monastic seminaries.Kragh 2013, pp. 16, 46, 239. Besides the Chinese and Tibetan translations which survive in full, at least 50% of the text survives in nine extant Sanskrit fragments.Kragh 2013, p. 47. A translation project is currently underway to translate the entirety of Xu\u00e1nz\u00e0ng's version into English. It is being carried out by the Bukky\u014d Dend\u014d Ky\u014dkai society and the Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research.Kragh 2013, p. 251. A subsection of the work, the Bodhisattva-bh\u016bmi, was translated into English by Artemus Engle and is part of the Tsadra series published by Shambhala Publications. == Overview of the Main Section == The complete YBh is often divided into the Basic Section and the Supplementary Section.The first section, which is the largest (49.9 % of the work), is the \"main stages division\" or \"the basic section\" (Skt. *Maulyo Bh\u016bmaya\u1e25, Ch. \u672c\u5730\u5206 B\u011bn d\u00ec f\u0113n, Tib. Sa'i dngos gzhi) and contains fourteen books that describe the successive seventeen levels (bh\u016bmi), which cover the entire range of mental and spiritual stages of practice for the Mah\u0101y\u0101na bodhisattva.Lusthaus, Dan; Muller, Charles; Summary of the Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi-\u015b\u0101stra, http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/outlines/YBh-summary.htmlKragh 2013, p. 49. However, according to Ulrich Timme Kragh, \"in the present context, the word bh\u016bmi appears in many cases to imply a 'foundation' in the sense of a field of knowledge that the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra acolyte ought to master in order to be successful in his or her yoga practice.\"Kragh 2013, p. 50. Most of the Basic Section which includes such seminal works as the Bodhisattva-bh\u016bmi and the \u015ar\u0101vaka- bh\u016bmi survives in Sanskrit, but little survives from the other parts. The following list is based on the Chinese arrangement, which seems to be closer to the original order. The fourteen books of this section are:Kragh 2013, p. 51. === 1 - Pa\u00f1cavij\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101yasamprayukt\u0101 Bh\u016bmi\u1e25 === \"The Foundation on the Fivefold Group of Empirical Consciousness\" provides a phenomenological analysis of the five sensory consciousnesses (the visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, and tactile forms of consciousness), in terms of five points, their bases (\u0101\u015braya), nature (svabhava), foci (alambana), accompanying mental states (sahaya) and functioning (karman).Kragh 2013, p. 60. Sense perception is said to have both material basis (the physical sense faculty) and a mental basis (the \u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na). The mental basis is the latent consciousness which is \"the holder of all the seeds [for the mind and mental states]\" (sarva-b\u012bjaka), \"the appropriator of the [corporeal] basis (i.e., the body)\" (\u0101\u015brayop\u0101d\u0101t\u1e5b), and \"belonging to the [category of] karmic maturation\" (vip\u0101ka-sa\u1e43g\u1e5bh\u012bta), which refers to the fact that it is morally neutral. === 2 - Manobh\u016bmi === \"The Foundation on Cognition\" discusses \"thought-consciousness or reflexive consciousness [manas] that arises subsequent to the five sensory perceptions\", in terms of the same five points outlined above. It also explains citta, manas, vij\u00f1\u0101na, the \u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na and the afflictive cognition (kli\u1e63\u1e6da\u1e43 mana\u1e25), using the schema of the eight consciousness. This book also explains the 51 mental factors (caittasik\u0101 dharm\u0101\u1e25), \"agreeing with the arrangement that is also seen in the first chapter of Asa\u1e45ga's Abhidharmasamuccaya.\"Kragh 2013, pp. 61-62. An explanation of the functioning or operation (karman) of cognition is also given which includes an extensive overview of death and rebirth, as well as an exposition of Buddhist cosmology and 24 typologies which discuss many modes of existence.Kragh 2013, p. 63. The rest of the book discusses various classifications of dharmas (phenomena), the first of which divides phenomena into physical (r\u016bpasamud\u0101ya), mental (cittacaitasikakal\u0101pa) and unconditioned (asa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta).Kragh 2013, p. 64. This exposition rejects the Abhidharma theory of atoms (param\u0101\u1e47u) and instead posits that the seeds (b\u012bja, causal potential) for physical matter are in the mind stream, which suggests that matter emerges from the mental. The second group of classifications relates to causality and explains time (adhvan), arising (j\u0101ti), elapsing (jar\u0101), enduring (sthiti), impermanence (anityat\u0101) and four types of causal conditions (pratyaya). The third group is an ethical classification of phenomena as being either beneficial (ku\u015bala) or not (aku\u015bala) or indeterminate (avy\u0101k\u1e5bta). The fourth classification includes the twelve constituents of perception (dh\u0101tu).Kragh 2013, p. 65. === 3 - Savitarkasavic\u0101r\u0101dibh\u016bmi === This book discusses three different foundations having to do with vitarka (discernment) and vicara (discursiveness): (1) the foundation which includes both, (2) the foundation with only discursiveness and (3) the foundation that has neither of these.Kragh 2013, pp. 71-72. According to Ulrich Timme Kragh \"discernment is said to be the cognitive operation that is responsible for ascertaining what is perceived by the senses by initially labeling it with a name, while discursiveness is explained as being the subsequent conceptual operation of deciding whether the perceived sense-object is desirable and what course of action one might want to take in relation to it.\"Kragh 2013, p. 72. Because these two cognitive factors play a crucial role in samsaric bondage and in meditative concentration (sam\u0101dhi, which is the pacification of these two factors), they are the focus of an extensive analysis in this book. This analysis is divided into five sections:Kragh 2013, p. 73. * A description of the three realms in sa\u1e43s\u0101ra: the desire realm (k\u0101madh\u0101tu), the form realm (r\u016bpadh\u0101tu) and the realm of incorporeality (\u0101r\u016bpyadh\u0101tu). * A description of the various defining characteristics (lak\u1e63a\u1e47a) of discernment and discursiveness. * A description of the associated correct observation (yoni\u015bomanask\u0101ra), which is \"a mental outlook inclined to practice generosity and uphold a good moral.\"Kragh 2013, p. 74. * A description of the associated incorrect observation (ayoni\u015bomanask\u0101ra), which consist of \"sixteen types of mistaken views and beliefs,\" such as eternalism, materialism, belief in a Creator God, belief in the caste superiority of brahmins, and belief in animal sacrifice.Kragh 2013, p. 75. * A description of the defilements (sa\u1e43kle\u015ba), which are \"the emotive and rational states through which sentient beings misperceive reality, e.g., desire, hatred, and ignorance.\" These are presented as subdivided into different categories, a total of 128 types of defilement are outlined. This section also explains defilement in terms of karma and in terms of the defilement of rebirth and dependent origination (prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da).Kragh 2013, pp. 76-78. === 4 - Sam\u0101hit\u0101 Bh\u016bmi\u1e25 === This book is titled \"The Foundation on Meditative Immersion\" and attempts to provide a coherent and exhaustive presentation of meditation. Large parts of this book make use of the canonical sutras of \"conservative Buddhism\" (i.e. non-Mahayana).Delhey, Martin (2009) Samahita Bhumi: Das Kapitel \u00fcber die meditative Versenkung im Grundteil der Yogacarabhumi, pp. 19-22. The first section of this book gives a general overview of meditation using four terms: meditation (dhy\u0101na), liberation (vimok\u1e63a), meditative attainment (sam\u0101patti), and sam\u0101dhi.Kragh 2013, p. 80. The second section of this book provides an extensive presentation of meditation (dhy\u0101na). First, five positive states to be cultivated and five negative states to be abandoned are explained. Then the five hindrances (nivara\u1e47a) are explained in detail. This is followed by a thorough explanation of each aspect (a\u1e45ga) of the four absorptions (catv\u0101ri dhy\u0101n\u0101ni). Also, various related terms from the scriptures are discussed.Kragh 2013, pp. 80-81. The third section provides a classification of the various types of meditation, these types are either divided into different forms of 'observation' (manasik\u0101ra) or classified according to the various foci (\u0101lambana) on which one concentrates, which are called the 'images' (nimitta).Kragh 2013, p. 81. Forty types of meditative observation are listed and explained in detail in this section. Meditative images are presented in terms of four aspects: (1) the image as the meditative focus (\u0101lambananimitta), (2) the image as the basis for meditation (nid\u0101nanimitta), (3) the images that are to be abandoned (parivarjan\u012bya\u1e43 nimitta\u1e43), and (4) the images that are to be relied upon (pratini\u1e63eva\u1e47\u012bya\u1e43 nimitta\u1e43). The images to be abandoned are: dimness (laya), restlessness (auddhatya), distraction (vik\u1e63epa), and attachment (sa\u1e45ga). A further 32 meditative images are also enumerated in this section, as well as how to enter the four meditative absorptions.Kragh 2013, p. 82. The fourth section is a summary of how meditation is explained in the sutras. The topics of the meditative liberations (vimok\u1e63a) and the various types of sam\u0101dhi are outlined, such as the emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101), wishlessness (apra\u1e47ihita), and imagelessness (\u0101nimitta), as well as sam\u0101dhi with and without vitarka-vicara.Kragh 2013, p. 83. === 5 - Asam\u0101hit\u0101 Bh\u016bmi\u1e25 === This book, \"The Foundation on Being Without Meditative Absorption\", lists 12 states that remain devoid of meditative absorption, such as a mind that is engaged in the realm of sensual desire (k\u0101m\u0101vacara) or the mind of a beginner meditator that suffers from distraction (vik\u1e63epa).Kragh 2013, p. 84. === 6 - Sacittik\u0101 Acittik\u0101 Bh\u016bmi\u1e25 === This book, \"The Foundation on Having Mentation and Being Without Mentation\", examines the notion of 'mind' or 'mentation' (citta) in relation to meditation and other doctrines\" and discusses different states that are with or without citta. States without citta include the meditative attainment of cessation (nirodhasam\u0101patti) and nirv\u0101\u1e47a, which is a state in which all mentation ceases, even the latent consciousness (\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na).Timme Kragh 2013, pp. 85-86. === 7 - \u015arutamay\u012b Bh\u016bmi\u1e25 === \"The Foundation on What is Derived from Listening\" focuses on various issues dealing with learning, listening to, and memorizing Buddhist spiritual knowledge (adhy\u0101tmavidy\u0101). \"Listening\" is related to processes of \"listening to religious discourses, memorizing and reciting scriptures, and recollecting various points of doctrine, all of which result in knowledge of the Buddhist teachings.\"Kragh 2013, p. 88. The book contains an outline of various basic Buddhist concepts in different sets or groupings similar to Abhidharma lists. This book also contains outlines of other forms of knowledge, such as the arts of healing (cikits\u0101), logical reasoning (hetuvidy\u0101), and linguistic knowledge (\u015babdavidy\u0101). === 8 - Cint\u0101may\u012b Bh\u016bmi\u1e25 === \"The Foundation on What is Derived from Understanding\" deals with understanding (cint\u0101) which refers to when \"the practitioner based on his or her studies of the teachings arrives at a singular 'view' or philosophical outlook of reality along with knowing the religious path that leads to the eradication of misconceptions of reality and the inner realization of this view.\"Kragh 2013, p. 93. This presentation is divided into three sections. The first section explains how one internalizes what one has heard or studied. The practitioner is supposed to contemplate and analyze the meaning of what they have learned in solitude. The second section provides an analysis of what is to be known (j\u00f1eyapravicaya), which is divided into what exists and what does not exist. What exists is analyzed by various categories, such as their specific characteristics (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a), general characteristics (s\u0101m\u0101nyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a), and causal characteristics (hetulak\u1e63a\u1e47a). The book also presents a second analysis of \"fivefold existence\" (astit\u0101) and fivefold non- existence which is more closely connected with the Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-Vij\u00f1\u0101nav\u0101da doctrine of the three natures (trisvabh\u0101va) and the three absences of intrisic nature (trini\u1e25svabh\u0101vat\u0101). The fivefold existences are:Kragh 2013, p. 95. # being existent in the sense of the perfectly accomplished character (parini\u1e63pannalak\u1e63a\u1e47a), # being existent in the sense of the dependent character (paratantralak\u1e63a\u1e47a), # being existent in the sense of the imagined character (parikalpitalak\u1e63a\u1e47a), # being existent in the sense of a specific character (vi\u1e63e\u015balak\u1e63a\u1e47a), # being existent as something having an inexpressible character (avaktavyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a). The corresponding non-existences are: # lacking the character of highest reality (param\u0101rthalak\u1e63a\u1e47a), # lacking the character of being independent (svatantralak\u1e63a\u1e47a), # entirely lacking any character of its own (sarve\u1e47a sarva\u1e43 svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a), # lacking a specific character (avi\u015be\u1e63alak\u1e63a\u1e47a), # lacking an expressible character (vaktavyalak\u1e63a\u1e47a). The third section of this book, the analysis of the teachings (dharmapravicaya), \"consists of three passages of selected canonical and paracanonical verses accompanied by a prose commentary.\" Among the key topics discussed here are the latent consciousness (\u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na), and the three kinds of religious training (\u015bik\u1e63\u0101). Many passages from the Ud\u0101navarga are quoted, which, according to Schmithausen, shows that the canon used by the compilers of this text belongs to the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da sect.Kragh 2013, p. 96. === 9 - Bh\u0101van\u0101may\u012b Bh\u016bmi\u1e25 === \"The Foundation on What is Derived from Meditative Cultivation\" discusses meditative cultivation (bh\u0101van\u0101), in terms of its basis, conditions, the practice of yoga and its results. First, the right circumstances needed to encounter the teachings and practice them are explained, which include being reborn as a suitable sentient being, being born in the right place and so on.Kragh 2013, p. 97. Then an explanation of how to listen to the true teaching is given, mainly, one must listen without disdain, distraction or faintheartedness. This leads the practitioner to trust that nirv\u0101\u1e47a is a real and worthy goal and thus they turn their mind towards this as their ultimate aim.Kragh 2013, p. 98. The book then discusses the conditions needed for achieving meditative insight (vipa\u015byan\u0101) and tranquility (\u015bamatha). The initial necessary circumstance leading to insight is said to be reliance on a spiritual friend (sanmitra) while tranquility is said to require the perfection of discipline (\u015b\u012blasampatti). The process towards spiritual realization is said to progress through the practice of ethical discipline and associating with a spiritual mentor, these two reinforce each other and lead to the study and internalization of the teachings, which give rise to a sense of renunciation of everything worldly and a yearning for realization. The spiritual seeker then applies all the remedies against the afflictions and achieves complete mental purity. After the inner and outer causes for spiritual development have been explained, this section then discusses the actual practice of meditative cultivation. This is explained through a list of ten types of remedies or antidotes (pratipak\u1e63a) applied to counter the numerous afflictions and adverse inclinations (vipak\u1e63a) that are also explained here. The ten meditative antidotes are:Kragh 2013, p. 99. # contemplating (of the notion) of unattractiveness (a\u015bubhasa\u1e43jn\u0101), # contemplating impermanence (anityasa\u1e43jn\u0101), # contemplating the suffering found in what is impermanent (anitye du\u1e25khasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101), # contemplating selflessness with regard to what entails suffering (du\u1e25khe 'an\u0101tmasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101), # fostering an attitude of indifference to food (\u0101h\u0101re pratik\u016blasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101), # fostering an attitude of disinterest in anything worldly (sarvaloke anabhiratisa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101), # meditating on images of light (\u0101lokasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101), # fostering an attitude of detachment (vir\u0101gasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101), # contemplating cessation (nirodhasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101), # contemplating death (mara\u1e47asa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101). Following this presentation, the book discusses practical advice related to the attainment of meditative immersion (sam\u0101dhil\u0101bha), covering topics such as living with others, finding and learning from a teacher, material affairs, one's environment, sleep and eating patterns, practicing asceticism, etc.Kragh 2013, pp. 99-100. Then, the fulfillment of meditative immersion (sam\u0101dhiparip\u016bri) is discussed, which refers to the process in which a meditator goes deeper into samadhi and achieves mastery of meditation, experiencing five stages of fruition.Kragh 2013, p. 100. === 10 - \u015ar\u0101vakabh\u016bmi === \"The Foundation on the Hearer\". This book focuses on practices associated with \"hearers\" or \"disciples\" (\u015br\u0101vaka). Lambert Schmithausen, Noritoshi Aramaki, Florin Deleanu and Alex Wayman all hold that this is the oldest layer of the YBh.Kragh 2013, pp. 54-57. The \u015ar\u0101vakabh\u016bmi is divided into four sections called yogasth\u0101nas (yogic foundations or topics) and is the second largest book of the YBh. ==== Yogasth\u0101na 1 ==== The first subdivision of the first yogasth\u0101na is called the Gotrabh\u016bmi, and it discusses, in depth, how different practitioners have different spiritual dispositions (gotra), which is explained as a mental potential or capacity, which is like a seed (b\u012bja-dharma) for spiritual achievement, found in the person since beginningless time.Kragh 2013, pp. 103-104. This predisposition is at first hidden, but if a person encounters the right causes and conditions, they will reach nirv\u0101\u1e47a. This section also discusses the qualities of persons that are \"not predisposed\" for awakening, which are persons that lack the qualities needed to attain nirv\u0101\u1e47a.Kragh 2013, p. 105. The different types of predisposed persons are also discussed. The second subdivision is called the Avat\u0101rabh\u016bmi and it focuses on how different types of persons enter (avat\u0101ra) into the path as well as the characteristics of these different types of persons that have entered the path (avat\u012br\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 pudgal\u0101\u1e25).Kragh 2013, pp. 106, 108. The third foundation of the first yogasth\u0101na is \"The Foundation of Going Forth\" (nai\u1e63kramyabh\u016bmi). Going forth is a term which implies the abandonment of the household life and becoming a monastic but can also generally refer to entering the spiritual life.Kragh 2013, p. 109. This foundation could technically be seen as covering the rest of the entire \u015ar\u0101vakabh\u016bmi and covers the entire path of practice. The path is divided into two branches, the mundane (laukika\u1e25 m\u0101rga\u1e25) and supramundane (lokottara\u1e25 m\u0101rga\u1e25). In following the mundane path, practitioners realize that the realm of sense desire is brutish and coarse and see that the absorption and rapture of the first dhy\u0101na is superior and serene. In practicing this dhy\u0101na, they achieve detachment from sense desire. They then realize that this meditation is also coarse, and progress to the second dhy\u0101na, and so on until they reach the fourth dhy\u0101na and beyond into the four immaterial attainments. The supramundane path meanwhile entails finding a genuine teacher, gaining knowledge of Dharma and realizing the four noble truths for oneself through vipa\u015byan\u0101 meditation they completely transcend sa\u1e43s\u0101ra.Kragh 2013, p. 110 The rest of this text discusses the 13 requisites (sambh\u0101ra) needed for journeying along these paths:Kragh 2013, pp. 110-117. # The first requisite is a human rebirth in a place and condition that is opportune for practicing the Dharma, # The second is the fact that a Buddha has appeared in the world, has taught the Dharma, and that this has been successfully transmitted down to the present # The third is to have a beneficial aspiration for [practicing] the Dharma (ku\u015balo dharmacchanda). # The fourth requisite is the restraint of discipline (\u015b\u012blasa\u1e43vara), which refers to keeping the ethical pr\u0101timok\u1e63a rules. # The fifth requisite is sense restraint (indriya-sa\u1e43vara) which means to \"keep the doors of the senses guarded, maintaining a protective awareness (\u0101rak\u1e63itasm\u1e5bti)\" and \"a constantly watchful awareness (nipakasm\u1e5bti).\" This practice requires that one carefully observes the process of sense perception to avoid adopting confused or harmful thinking that leads to the defilements, such as thinking that what is unattractive is attractive. # The sixth requisite is the right amount of food intake (bhojane m\u0101tra-j\u00f1at\u0101). It is eating with careful consideration, only for the sake of a healthy body, not pleasure, company or bodily beauty. # The seventh requisite is to practice staying awake (j\u0101garik\u0101yoga) in the evening (first part of the night after sunset) and in the early morning (last part of the night before sunrise). This is accomplished by taking a walk and through the visualization of a mass of light. # The eighth requisite is to move about attentively (sa\u1e43praj\u0101nadvih\u0101rit\u0101) during all of one's daily activities and in all postures. # The ninth requisite is to find a proper spiritual teacher (kaly\u0101\u1e47amitra), the right qualities of a good teacher are then outlined, including pure discipline, knowing much, being compassionate, etc. # The tenth requisite \"is to listen to the true Dharma and understand it (saddharma\u015brava\u1e47acintan\u0101)\". This section explains the twelve branches of the Buddha's Dharma and the threefold division of Sutra, Vinaya and Abhidharma. # The eleventh requisite is to be free from obstacles (anantar\u0101ya). This section outlines the many different kinds of obstacles that block one's practice. # The twelfth requisite is 'relinquishment' (ty\u0101ga), defined as \"giving items that are beyond reproach as gifts.\" # The thirteenth requisite is to possess \"the ornaments of a renunciant\" (\u015brama\u1e47\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra), which is a list of seventeen qualities including: faith (\u015br\u0101ddha), honesty (a\u015batha), intelligence (pr\u0101j\u00f1a), asceticism, and patience (k\u1e63ama). ==== Yogasth\u0101na 2 ==== The second section discusses 28 different personality types and also various ways of classifying spiritual practitioners. An example of one such classification is that of persons of different temperaments (caritaprabheda). These are: the temperament of desire and attachment (r\u0101gacarita\u1e25), the temperament of dislike and hatred (dve\u1e63acarita\u1e25), the temperament of deludedness and stupidity (mohacarita\u1e25), the temperament of pride and self-conceit (m\u0101nacarita), the temperament of intellectuality (vitarkacarita), and the temperament with equal amounts [of each afflictive state] (samabh\u0101gacarita).Kragh 2013, pp. 119-120. Following this exposition, the various meditative foci (\u0101lambana) are explained. It is in this section that concrete meditation techniques appear in this treatise. These meditations are divided into four kinds: (I) general [types of] foci, (II) foci purifying the practitioner's temperament, (III) foci [for developing] expertise, and (IV) foci purifying the afflictions.Kragh 2013, pp. 121-122. There are four types of general foci (vy\u0101py\u0101lambanam): # The conceptual image (savikalpa\u1e43 pratibimbam), used in insight meditation (vipa\u015byan\u0101). A meditator chooses a doctrinal topic such as the four noble truths, dependent arising, or the aggregrates and analyzes it conceptually while resting in meditation until a realization emerges. # The non-conceptual image (nirvikalpa\u1e43 pratibimbam) used in tranquility meditation (\u015bamatha). The mind is brought to rest on the object without analysis in nine steps called \"the nine aspects of resting the mind\" (nav\u0101k\u0101r\u0101 cittasthiti\u1e25). # The entirety of things (vastuparyantat\u0101). This is to concentrate on the five aggregates (skandha), the eighteen constituents of perception (dh\u0101tu), or the twelve perceptual domains (\u0101yatana) concerning their causality, function, or characteristics. # The fourth type of general foci is the perfection of the aim [of meditation] (k\u0101ryaparini\u1e63patti), where the meditative image is transcended, one reaches the dhyanas and attains the vision of non-conceptual, direct knowledge (nirvikalpam pratyak\u1e63a\u1e43 j\u00f1\u0101na-dar\u015banam). The foci for purifying the practitioner's temperament (caritavi\u015bodhanam \u0101lambanam) contains extensive explanations of five contemplative objects:Kragh 2013, pp. 122-125. * The person with a temperament of desire is assigned various meditations on unattractiveness (a\u015bubh\u0101) and charnel ground contemplation (mara\u1e47asati). This section also teaches meditation on the unattractiveness of the mental afflictions and on the unattractiveness of the impermanence of the five aggregates. * The person with a temperament of dislike and hatred is assigned the meditation on friendliness (maitr\u012b). The meditation consists of wishing happiness for one's friends, enemies and neutral persons until one is able to rest in an expansive and unlimited absorption state that wishes well for all. This method is then applies to meditation on compassion (karu\u1e47\u0101) and sympathetic rejoicing (mudit\u0101). * The person with a temperament of deludedness and stupidity is assigned the meditation on causality and dependent arising (ida\u1e43pratyayat\u0101prat\u012btya-samutp\u0101da). * The person with a temperament of pride and conceit is assigned the meditation on the division of the constituents (dh\u0101tuprabheda), i.e. the six elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness. * The person with an intellectual temperament is assigned the various meditations on breathing mindfulness (\u0101n\u0101p\u0101nasm\u1e5bti). Five different techniques are presented: (1) counting the breath, (2) observing how each of the five aggregates is involved in the breathing process, (3) observing dependent arising through the breath, (4) observing the four noble truths, (5) the exercise of the sixteen aspects (\u1e63o\u1e0da\u015b\u0101k\u0101ra-paricaya) of \u0101n\u0101p\u0101nasm\u1e5bti. The third type of foci, which are also termed the foci [for developing] expertise (kau\u015baly\u0101lambana), refers to the following:Kragh 2013, pp. 125-126. * Expertise in the aggregates (skandhakau\u015balya), is cultivated by contemplating the distinct nature of each aggregate and understanding none of them as a permanent, unchanging phenomenon. * Expertise in the constituents [of perception] (dh\u0101tukau\u015balya), is cultivated by observing how each dh\u0101tu \"arises, unfolds, and becomes cognizant.\" * Expertise in the domains [of perception] (\u0101yatana-kau\u015balya), is cultivated by contemplating how the different conditions in each domain give rise to each type of consciousness. * Expertise in dependent arising (prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101dakau\u015balya) is cultivated as follows: \"the meditator first analyzes how each link serves as a condition for the subsequent link to arise and then understands that the causality involved in this process requires each phenomenon to be impermanent. Since they are impermanent, they also involve suffering and are without any self.\"Kragh 2013, p. 126. * Expertise in what constitutes a basis and what does not constitute a basis [for beneficial action and desirable karmic results] (sth\u0101n\u0101sth\u0101nakau\u015balya) is cultivated by meditating on how negative and beneficial actions have different kinds of karmic results. The fourth meditative object is the foci purifying the afflictions (kle\u015bavi\u015bodhana\u1e43 \u0101lambanam). This is related to the mundane and supramundane paths. In the mundane path, meditation focuses on seeing the realm of existence one is currently on (e.g. realm of desire) as coarse, while the realm which is immediately above (i.e. first dhyana) is seen as peaceful. Then once one has attained the higher realm in meditation, one continues this process (i.e. one sees the first dhyana as coarse and the second dhyana as peaceful and so on). On the supramundane path, the foci for meditation are the four noble truths. After these presentations, there follows an exposition on how to give instructions to a student, and another section on the three trainings (superior discipline, superior meditative mind and superior insight). Then there follows a segment which outlines \"ten factors that go along with the training (\u015bik\u1e63\u0101nulomik\u0101 dharm\u0101\u1e25), which are remedies to ten factors that go against the dharma. These are:Kragh 2013, pp. 127-128. # the contemplation of unattractiveness (a\u015bubhasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101) counters sexual attachment, # the contemplation of impermanence (anityasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101) remedies belief in a self, # the contemplation of suffering with regard to what is impermanent (anitye du\u1e25khasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101) overcomes laziness and apathy, # the contemplation of no-self in suffering (du\u1e25khe 'n\u0101tmasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101) opposes belief in a self, # the contemplation of the un-attractiveness of food (\u0101h\u0101re pratik\u016blasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101) counters desire for eating, # the contemplation of the lack of real happiness anywhere in the world (sarvaloke 'nabhiratisa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101) works against craving for listening to chatter about the world, # the visualization of light (\u0101lokasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101) remedies states that cloud or confuse the mind, such as doubt, unclarity, tiredness, sleepiness, and so forth, # the contemplation of non-attachment (vir\u0101gasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101) works against attachment to the bliss experienced in higher states of meditation, # the contemplation of cessation (nirodhasa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101) overcomes desire for the meditative absorption, # the contemplation of death (mara\u1e47asa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101) remedies the misery that arises from wishing and hoping for life. The second Yogasth\u0101na also gives a general definition of yoga as \"spiritual practice\", which is said to have four aspects, (1) faith (\u015braddh\u0101), (2) aspiration (chandas), (3) perseverance (v\u012brya), and (4) spiritual methods (up\u0101ya).Kragh 2013, p. 129. Another segment of the second Yogasth\u0101na explains four levels of mental observation, engagement or attention (manask\u0101ra) as it relates to the strength and constancy of one's mental focus on the object of meditation. These four levels are: # forceful application [of the mind towards the meditative object] (balav\u0101hana), # interrupted application (sacchidrav\u0101hana), # uninterrupted application (ni\u015bchidrav\u0101hana), # effortless application (an\u0101bhogav\u0101hana). Other topics are also outlined in the second Yogasth\u0101na, including the nine types of ascertainment (adhimok\u1e63a) of the meditative focus, the four aims of yoga (yoga-kara\u1e47\u012bya), the different kinds of yoga practitioners (yog\u0101c\u0101ra), the cultivation of notions (sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101-bh\u0101van\u0101), the thirty-seven factors of Awakening (saptatri\u1e43\u015bad bodhipak\u1e63y\u0101 dharm\u0101\u1e25) and the four stages of contemplative fruition (bh\u0101van\u0101phala).Kragh 2013, pp. 129-132. ==== Yogasth\u0101na 3 ==== The third section discusses various practical issues on the path, how one approaches a teacher and how a teacher assesses a student's abilities and predispositions.Kragh 2013, p. 134. Then five topics which a teacher instructions their student are discussed: # How to guard and accumulate the requisites needed for meditation (sam\u0101dhisa\u1e43bh\u0101rarak\u1e63opacaya). # How to practice in solitary retreat (pr\u0101vivekya). The best location is in the wilderness, but it should also be safe and it should be easy to obtain provisions. The ideal retreat is done in solitude. # How to achieve one- pointedness of mind (cittai-k\u0101grat\u0101). Samadhi is defined in this section as \"a stream of mind characterized by continuous irreproachable bliss whose focus is an appropriate object of constant mindfulness.\"Kragh 2013, p. 135. This section also discusses the practice of tranquility (\u015bamatha) and meditative insight (vipa\u015byan\u0101). Tranquility is discussed through \"the nine aspects of resting the mind\" (nav\u0101k\u0101r\u0101 cittasthiti\u1e25) and the four levels of mental observation. Vipa\u015byan\u0101 is explained through \"four supports\" for insight and \"three gates\".Kragh 2013, p. 136. # How to purify the hindrances (\u0101vara\u1e47avi\u015buddhi). This is done by (1) recognizing the nature (svabh\u0101va) of the hindrances, (2) knowing the circumstances (nid\u0101na) under which they arise, (3) realizing the drawbacks (\u0101d\u012bnava) that they cause, and (4) employing the right remedies (pratipak\u1e63a).Kragh 2013, p. 137. # How to cultivate meditative observation (manask\u0101rabh\u0101van\u0101), four progressive stages are outlined. The first is \"the observation that toughens the mind\", which leads to disenchantment with sa\u1e43s\u0101ra. Then one practices \"the observation that moistens the mind\" through recollecting the qualities of the three jewels. Thirdly, one practices the observation that produces inner comfort, relaxation, and ease (pra\u015brabdhi-janako) through resting in \u015bamatha and vipa\u015byan\u0101 meditation. Finally, one reaches \"the observation that perfects knowledge and the view...by first perfecting the practice of \u015bamatha and thereupon repeatedly penetrating into the nature of phenomena with the insight of vipa\u015byan\u0101.\" The goal of this is a mind that \"has become one-pointed, gentle, and peaceful, and the various types of negative temperaments no longer arise in the circumstances where they typically would be felt.\"Kragh 2013, p. 138. ==== Yogasth\u0101na 4 ==== The fourth section discusses the mundane and supramundane paths in detail. The mundane path deals with abandoning the sensual realm and practicing the meditative absorptions (dhy\u0101nas), which lead to rebirth in higher realms (but does not lead to awakening). The various meditative observations that lead to the practice of the dhy\u0101nas is taught in this section, and the characteristics of the eight dhy\u0101nas are analyzed in detail.Kragh 2013, pp. 139-140. Other meditative attainments are also discussed, such as the meditative attainment of non-ideation (asa\u1e43j\u00f1isam\u0101patti) and the meditative attainment of cessation (nirodhasam\u0101patti). The results of these practices are also presented, including the five types of extrasensory knowledge (pa\u00f1c\u0101bhij\u00f1\u0101), and rebirth in the realm of non-sensual corporeality (r\u016bpadh\u0101tu) and the realm of incorporeality (\u0101r\u016bpyadh\u0101tu).Kragh 2013, pp. 140-142. Turning to the supramundane path (lokottara\u1e25 m\u0101rga\u1e25), practicing this path requires fully understanding the four noble truths and its sixteen characteristics through meditative observation. These sixteen characteristics are explained in detail, they are:Kragh 2013, p. 144. * The four characteristics of the truth of suffering are impermanence (anity\u0101k\u0101ra), suffering (du\u1e25kh\u0101k\u0101ra), emptiness (*\u015b\u016bny\u0101k\u0101ra), and selflessness (an\u0101tm\u0101k\u0101ra). * The four characteristics of the origin of suffering are cause (hetu), origination (samudaya), production (prabhava), and condition (pratyaya). * The characteristics the end of suffering are cessation (nirodha), peace (\u015b\u0101nta), excellence (pra\u1e47\u012bta), and escape (ni\u1e25sara\u1e47a). * The characteristics of the path to the end of suffering are being the path (m\u0101rga), the method (ny\u0101ya), the practice (pratipatti), and what leads out [of suffering] (nairy\u0101\u1e47ika). This path leads to nirvana as an arhat, through the ultimate meditation that gains insight into the four noble truths, called the vajra-like meditation (vajropama\u1e25 sam\u0101dhi).Kragh 2013, p. 145. === 11 - Pratyekabuddhabh\u016bmi === This short section titled \"The Foundation on the Solitary Buddha\" outlines the disposition, path and practices of the pratyekabuddha. Kragh notes that \"the pratyekabuddha avoids crowds and takes pleasure in solitude, exhibits little compassion and is not inclined to teach others, and is of mediocre aptitude and has a temperament of pride.\"Kragh 2013, p. 146. === 12 - Bodhisattvabh\u016bmi === The Foundation on the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Bodhisattva, which is the longest book in the basic section, is divided into three yogasth\u0101nas and ten topics:Kragh 2013, pp. 147-148. # the basis for being a bodhisattva (\u0101dh\u0101ra) # the characteristics of a bodhisattva (li\u1e45ga) # the classes of bodhisattvas (pak\u1e63a) # the bodhisattva's exalted conviction (adhy\u0101\u015baya) # the dwellings of a bodhisattva's practice (vih\u0101ra) # the bodhisattva's rebirths (upapatti) # how bodhisattvas lead sentient beings to perfection (parigraha) # the spiritual levels (bh\u016bmi) # the bodhisattva's practices (cary\u0101) # the ascension to Buddhahood (prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101) ==== Yogasth\u0101na 1 ==== Yogasth\u0101na one is titled the section on the basis (\u0101dh\u0101rayogasth\u0101na) because it deals with the basis (\u0101dh\u0101ra) for becoming a bodhisattva (topic 1). There are three main aspects of the basis of a bodhisattva. The first is an inborn unique predisposition (svagotra) for the bodhisattva path, those who lack this are said to be unable to reach Buddhahood. The second is \"the basis of initially engendering the resolve to reach Buddhahood (prathama\u015b cittotp\u0101da\u1e25), which refers to arousing bodhicitta, practicing the perfections for the benefit of oneself and others, and so forth. The third is \"the basis of practicing all the factors leading to Awakening\" (sarve bodhipak\u1e63y\u0101 dharm\u0101\u1e25).Kragh 2013, p. 148. Those who will become Buddhas are said to have a particular 'original nature' (prak\u1e5bti), which is like a 'seed' (b\u012bja) that predisposes them to this path. This nature is accomplished through the cultivation of good qualities.Kragh 2013, p. 149. These persons are seen as \"vastly superior to \u015br\u0101vakas, pratyekabuddhas, and all ordinary sentient beings\" because they have the ability to remove cognitive hindrances (j\u00f1ey\u0101vara\u1e47a) and afflictive hindrances (kle\u015b\u0101vara\u1e47a), while other beings are only able to remove afflictive hindrance. Also, bodhisattvas practice for the good and well-being of all sentient beings, while practitioners of other paths only practice for their own good.Kragh 2013, p. 150. These persons are generally caring, compassionate, harmless, helpful, love solitude and have a natural capacity for understanding the Buddhadharma. The bodhisattva's resolve to attain Buddhahood is described in detail. Its conditions, causes, aspects, qualities and so forth are outlined.Kragh 2013, pp. 152-153. The book explains how a bodhisattva engenders this wish and how they must practice, which is divided into seven undertakings. # Training for their own benefit # Training for the benefit of others, which must be balanced with the first undertaking. # Training in realizing the nature of reality (tattv\u0101rtha), which in an ultimate sense refers to the insubstantiality of phenomena (dharmanair\u0101tmya) and that all phenomena are without the duality (advaya) of existence (bh\u0101va) and non-existence (abh\u0101va).Kragh 2013, p. 157. # Developing five types of spiritual power (prabh\u0101va) such as different forms of clairvoyance (abhij\u00f1\u0101prabh\u0101va), and the power of the six perfections.Kragh 2013, p.162. # Developing sentient beings, which depends on their innate dispositions for different paths and so on. # Developing the qualities of a Buddha in themselves # Highest and complete Awakening (anuttar\u0101 samyaksa\u1e43bodhi\u1e25), which is only achieved through the removal of the afflictive hindrances and the cognitive hindrances. Yogasth\u0101na one also expounds on the six perfections (\u1e63a\u1e6dp\u0101ramit\u0101) at length, they are: * The perfection of generosity (d\u0101nap\u0101ramit\u0101). D\u0101na's nature is that \"the bodhisattva gives to others whatever they need\" without attachment, self-interest or partiality. This includes material things and the bodhisattva's own body as well as teaching Dharma, but not weapons or things that cause harm.Kragh 2013, pp. 172-173. * The perfection of discipline (\u015b\u012blap\u0101ramit\u0101). One practices ethical discipline (\u015b\u012bla) by receiving, keeping and restoring ethical vows (sa\u1e43vara) properly. This includes both vows for householders and monastics.Kragh 2013, p. 174. It also includes doing all kinds of beneficial actions such as studying the Dharma, teaching others, caring for the sick, giving material goods, praising the good qualities of others, protecting others from danger, and leading others away from negative actions.Kragh 2013, p. 175. The procedure for taking the bodhisattva vow is explained as well as the various transgressions of this vow. The four major transgressions are: (1) to belittle others and exalt oneself in hope of gain, (2) to refuse to help suffering beings by not giving alms or not sharing the Dharma (to those who ask for it), (3) to harm others and hold a grudge against others, (4) to disparage the bodhisattva teachings.Kragh 2013, pp. 175-176. * The perfection of endurance (k\u1e63\u0101ntip\u0101ramit\u0101). K\u1e63\u0101nti refers to patience, endurance and forbearance. Kragh states that this \"must be done with an attitude free from any hope of reward, must be purely motivated by compassion, and must fully forgive the wrongdoing in its entirety.\"Kragh 2013, p. 178. There are three main modes of endurance: (1) patiently bearing wrongdoings inflicted by others, (2) accepting suffering (hardships and distress), and (3) the endurance of resolving to comprehend the Dharma through patient perseverence. A bodhisattva does this through different means, such as reflecting that suffering is caused by past karma, contemplating how people who harm us now may have been our relatives in a past life, and he contemplation of impermanence.Kragh 2013, p. 179. * The perfection of drive or enthusiasm (v\u012bryap\u0101ramit\u0101). V\u012brya is a strong mental energy or force which aims at gathering good qualities and doing good activities. There are three types: (1) the armor-like drive (which willingly accepts working to help others for eons on end), (2) the drive for gathering good qualities (i.e. practicing the paramitas), and (3) the drive devoted to acting for the benefit of sentient beings (by performing beneficial actions).Kragh 2013, p. 181. * The perfection of meditation (dhy\u0101nap\u0101ramit\u0101). Dhy\u0101na refers to resting the mind (cittasthiti) so there is one-pointedness of mind (cittaik\u0101grya). This may refer to \u015bamatha or vipa\u015byan\u0101, or to a union of the two.Kragh 2013, p. 183. It may be done for the sake of happiness in this life, for the sake of gaining the bodhisattva qualities (special sam\u0101dhis unknown to other paths) and for the sake of helping other sentient beings. * The perfection of wisdom (praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101). This refers to mastering the five fields of knowledge, which include mundane knowledge as well as ultimate spiritual knowledge (of both the \u015br\u0101vaka and bodhisattva baskets) such as the four noble truths, cause and effect, etc.Kragh 2013, pp. 185-186. Following the exposition of the perfections, further sections teach various topics such as how to gather students (through giving, affectionate speech, meaningful activity and having a common aim), how to revere the three jewels (through various forms of puja), how to serve and rely on a qualified spiritual teacher (kaly\u0101\u1e47amitra, \"good friend\") and how to cultivate the four immeasurables (apram\u0101\u1e47a).Kragh 2013, pp. 186-188. Important qualities of a spiritual teacher include: being disciplined and pure in conduct, intelligent and well-educated in the doctrine, experienced and realized in meditation, compassionate, patient and caring, being without attachments and having few wants and needs, skilled at giving clear teachings, and being impartial in teaching others.Kragh 2013, pp. 189-190. Regarding practicing the four immeasurables (apram\u0101\u1e47a), this section states that this can be done in three main ways: by focusing on sentient beings, by focusing on the phenomena (dharm\u0101s) which make up sentient beings or completely without focus or reference (an\u0101lamban\u0101ni).Kragh 2013, p. 190. This section also discusses the special kind of compassion that a bodhisattva cultivates, namely great compassion (mah\u0101karu\u1e47\u0101). This kind of compassion is directed towards the suffering of all beings and is cultivated for hundreds of thousands of aeons. A bodhisattva with great compassion would do anything to help sentient beings, such as give up their life in hundreds of rebirths, and endure any torment. The cultivation of the four immeasurables \"is said to lead to instant happiness in this life, vast accumulation of merit, development of a firm wish to reach Awakening, and ability to carry the sufferings of others.\"Kragh 2013, p. 191. The following chapters contain an exposition of all the factors leading to Awakening, the third main aspect of the basis for becoming a bodhisattva. This covers sixteen elements of a bodhisattvas training:Kragh 2013, p. 192. # To have conscience and a sense of embarrassment (hr\u012bvyapatr\u0101pya), an inner sense of right and wrong. # To develop a firm strength (dh\u1e5btibal\u0101dh\u0101nat\u0101), a steadiness on the path which can control the deluded mind. It is developed by enduring suffering, recognizing negative behaviors and study. # To develop tirelessness (akhedat\u0101) in all beneficial undertakings through training in insight and compassion. # To gain knowledge in the various fields of learning # To know the world (lokaj\u00f1at\u0101), which is to see how sa\u1e43s\u0101ra is an endless and insecure cycle of birth and death, and constantly changing circumstances. # To lean on the four reliances (catv\u0101ri pratisara\u1e47\u0101ni). These are (1) to rely on the meaning and not on the words, (2) to rely on logic and not on the person giving the teaching, (3) to rely on scriptures of definitive meaning and not on scriptures of provisional meaning (4) when in doubt to rely on the essential understanding one has achieved oneself and not merely on knowledge one has heard from others.Kragh 2013, pp. 193-198. # Mastering the four analytical knowledges (of the Dharma, meaning, derivative analysis, rhetoric). # Gathering the requisites for Awakening (bodhisa\u1e43bh\u0101ra), the requisite of merit (pu\u1e47yasa\u1e43bh\u0101ra) and the requisite of knowledge (j\u00f1\u0101nasa\u1e43bh\u0101ra). # To practice the thirty-seven factors of Awakening (saptatri\u1e43\u015bad bodhipak\u1e63y\u0101 dharm\u0101\u1e25), but not to actualize them (na cain\u0101\u1e43 s\u0101k\u1e63\u0101tkaroti). # To practice calming meditation (\u015bamatha). According to Timme Kragh, \"the practice is essentially the same as that taught in the \u015br\u0101vaka path but the bodhisattvaengages in these in a special way bringing in a Mah\u0101y\u0101na Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 understanding.\"Kragh 2013, p. 194. # The bodhisattva's practice of insight meditation (vipa\u015byan\u0101), which is focused on the ultimate level of the thirty-seven factors of Awakening and is preceded by calming meditation. # The bodhisattva's expertise in the methods (up\u0101yakau-\u015balya). # The bodhisattva's mastery of retentiveness (dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b), which refers to the power of memory/remembering teachings as well as the power of mantras and formulas. # To engender bodhisattva-aspirations (bodhisattva-pra\u1e47idh\u0101na). # To accomplish three meditative absorptions (sam\u0101dhi): emptiness (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101sam\u0101dhi), wishlessness (apra\u1e47ihita\u1e25 sam\u0101dhi\u1e25), and imagelessness (\u0101nimitta\u1e25 sam\u0101dhi\u1e25). # The teaching of the four summary statements (catv\u0101rim\u0101ni dharmodd\u0101n\u0101ni): (1) everything conditioned is impermanent (anity\u0101\u1e25 sarvasa\u1e43sk\u0101r\u0101\u1e25), (2) everything conditioned is suffering (du\u1e25kh\u0101\u1e25 sarvasa\u1e43sk\u0101r\u0101\u1e25), (3) all phenomena are without a [permanent] self (an\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e25 sarvadharm\u0101\u1e25), and (4) nirv\u0101\u1e47a is peace (\u015b\u0101\u1e43ta\u1e43 nirv\u0101\u1e47am). The last section of Yogasth\u0101na one contains four lists of qualities that advanced bodhisattvas have. ==== Yogasth\u0101na 2 ==== Yogasth\u0101na two (titled \"the section on the subsidiary factors ensuing from the basis\" \u0101dh\u0101r\u0101nudharmayogasth\u0101na) explains the characteristics (li\u1e45ga) of bodhisattvas (mainly: compassion, affectionate speech, courage, openhandedness, and the ability to unravel deep underlying meanings).Kragh 2013, p. 202. Furthermore, the classes (pak\u1e63a) of bodhisattvas are explained (lay and monastic) along with their four main Dharmas or practices: good deeds, skillfulness and expertise (kau\u015balya), caring for others (par\u0101nugr\u0101ha) and dedicatory transfer of merit (pari\u1e47\u0101man\u0101).Kragh 2013, pp. 204-205. The monastic bodhisattvas are said to be superior.Kragh 2013, p. 205. The exalted conviction (adhy\u0101\u015baya) of a bodhisattva is then explained, which refers to their pure motivation and mindset. A bodhisattva is said to have tenderness towards sentient beings, they are also said to have conviction in the Buddha's teachings derived from faith and analysis. Different forms of conviction are then outlined. Yogasth\u0101na two also sets out thirteen levels or dwellings (vih\u0101ra) of accomplishment in the practice of a bodhisattva. ==== Yogasth\u0101na 3 ==== Yogasth\u0101na three (\"the section on the culmination of the basis\", \u0101dh\u0101rani\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101yogasth\u0101na) explains general topics six through ten.Kragh 2013, p. 208. Topic six, is the five kinds of rebirths (upapatti) a bodhisattva undergoes during their journey, which are:Kragh 2013, pp. 209-210. # Rebirth pacifying harm (iti\u015ba\u1e43\u015baman\u012b upapatti\u1e25). A bodhisattva is reborn in a difficult time (famine, plague, etc) in order to help others during this time. # Rebirth assuming a corresponding form (tat-sabh\u0101g\u0101nuvartin\u012b upapatti). A bodhisattva is reborn among beings who harm others, such as animals, gods, demons, or heretics, and leads them to a good path. # Rebirth into greatness (mahattvopapatti). A bodhisattva is born into excellent circumstances and becomes a great person who spiritually benefits others. # Rebirth with authority (\u0101dhipatyopapatti). A bodhisattva is born into a position of rulership over the world or the gods. # The bodhisattva's final rebirth in which they become a Buddha. Topic seven outlines six ways that bodhisattvas lead (parigraha) sentient beings to perfection:Kragh 2013, pp. 210-211. # Leading all sentient beings simultaneously (sak\u1e5btsarvasattva-parigraha). Bodhisattvas regard all sentient beings as their partner. # Leading through authority (\u0101dhipatyaparigraha), through a position such as head of a household or a king. # Leading an assembly (up\u0101d\u0101naparigraha), which refers to residing over a perfect congregation. # Guiding for a long time (d\u012brghak\u0101likam up\u0101d\u0101nam), is when a bodhisattva must care and guides certain beings slowly and for a long time. # Guiding for a short time (ad\u012brghak\u0101likam up\u0101d\u0101nam), is when they guide beings only for a short time. # Final guiding (caramam up\u0101d\u0101nam) refers to caring for individuals who are very advanced. Topic eight explains the seven bodhisattva levels (bh\u016bmis) and how they related to the thirteen vih\u0101ras.Kragh 2013, p. 211. Topic nine sums up all the bodhisattva practices (cary\u0101) into four main groups:Kragh 2013, pp. 212-213 * The practice of the perfections (p\u0101ramit\u0101cary\u0101), the six perfections are outlined and four more perfections are also explained. * The practice of the factors of Awakening (bodhipak\u1e63yacary\u0101) which refers to the thirty-seven factors of Awakening, the four investigations, and the four complete knowledges of things as they really are. * The practice of six clairvoyances (abhij\u00f1\u0101cary\u0101) * The practice of developing sentient beings (sattva-parip\u0101kacary\u0101) Finally, general topic number ten explains the bodhisattva's ascension (prati\u1e63\u1e6dh\u0101) to Buddhahood along with all the Buddha qualities which are manifested in them (140 exceptional buddha-qualities are outlined. including the 32 marks and the ten powers of a Tath\u0101gata).Kragh 2013, p. 213. === 13 - Sopadhik\u0101 Bh\u016bmi\u1e25 === The \"Foundation on Having an Existential Substratum\" discusses the state of the living arhat, as well as \"what it is that forms the remaining layer or basis for continued sa\u1e43s\u0101ric existence, namely the notion of there being an existential substratum (upadhi)\", such as the five aggregates and so forth.Kragh 2013, p. 221. === 14 - Nirupadhik\u0101 Bh\u016bmi\u1e25 === The last book, the \"Foundation on Being Without an Existential Substratum\" explains the state of an arhat who has died and entered parinirv\u0101\u1e47a (final nirvana), and thus is without a substratum for continued existence.Kragh 2013, p. 223. This book discusses parinirv\u0101\u1e47a which is said to be complete and eternal extinction and completion (nirv\u1e5bti).Kragh 2013, p. 224. == Supplementary Section == This part is made up of four 'collections' or 'compendia' (sa\u1e43graha\u1e47\u012b, sh\u00e8 \u651d, bsdu ba), which supplement the Basic Section:Ulrich Timme Kragh (editor), The Foundation for Yoga Practitioners: The Buddhist Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi Treatise and Its Adaptation in India, East Asia, and Tibet, Volume 1 Harvard University, Department of South Asian studies, 2013, p. 52. * Vini\u015bcayasa\u1e43graha\u1e47\u012b (Compendium of Ascertainment). This compendium discusses and provides a clarification (vini\u015bcaya) on aspects of the seventeen bhumis from the Basic Section. This section also contains a \"detailed treatment of \u0101layavij\u00f1\u0101na and at the same time quoting and making use of the Sa\u1e43dhinirmocanas\u016btra.\" Thus it is considered a later strata by Schmithausen. * Vy\u0101khy\u0101sa\u1e43graha\u1e47\u012b (Compendium of Exegesis). This is a manual of hermeneutical and exegetical techniques, as well as on rhetorical and logical argument (hetuvidy\u0101). * Pary\u0101yasa\u1e43graha\u1e47\u012b (Compendium of Related Terms). This text defines many of the various strings of quasi-synonymical expressions found in the \u0100gamas. * Vastusa\u1e43graha\u1e47\u012b (Compendium of [Selected] Themes). Lambert Schmithausen, Florin Delenau and Noritoshi Aramaki all hold that this is part of the oldest textual layer. It includes: ** The S\u016btravastusa\u1e43graha\u1e47\u012b which summarizes and explains key topics of each s\u016btra contained in the Samyukta-\u0101gama. ** 'The Compendium of the Vinaya' (Vinayavastusa\u1e43graha\u1e47\u012b) ** 'The compendium of Abhidharma lists' (M\u0101t\u1e5bkavastusa\u1e43graha\u1e47\u012b). The Chinese version also contains a Compendium of Abhidharma, missing from the Tibetan translation. An Indian commentary was also written on the YBh, called the Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmivy\u0101khy\u0101.Ulrich Timme Kragh (editor), The Foundation for Yoga Practitioners: The Buddhist Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi Treatise and Its Adaptation in India, East Asia, and Tibet, Volume 1 Harvard University, Department of South Asian studies, 2013, p. 30. ==Notes== === Bibliography === * * == External links == *Digital Dictionary of Buddhism (log in with userID \"guest\") *Summary of the Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi-\u015b\u0101stra, Charles Muller and Dan Lusthaus *Chinese-Sanskrit-Tibetan Terms: Yogacarabhumi *Yog\u0101c\u0101rabh\u016bmi Database (Complete marked-up Chinese text with much of the available Sanskrit and some Tibetan) Category:Mahayana texts Category:Yogacara ",
