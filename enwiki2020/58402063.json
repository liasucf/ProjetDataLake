The race was the 3rd round of the 2019 Formula One World Championship, and marked the 16th time that the Chinese Grand Prix had been run as a round of the Formula One World Championship. The race also marked the 1000th World Championship race since the first World Championship race was held at the Silverstone Circuit in . ==Background== ===Championship standings before the race=== Heading into the race, Valtteri Bottas was leading the Drivers' Championship by one point from Lewis Hamilton. Bottas's team Mercedes was leading the Constructors' Championship by 39 points from Ferrari. ===Entrants=== The drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand in drivers for either the race or practice. == Free practice == Sebastian Vettel was fastest in the first practice session with Valtteri Bottas fastest in the second practice. Bottas was again fastest in FP3 on Saturday, however the session was brought to a premature end when Alexander Albon lost control and hit the wall on the exit of the final corner, smashing into the wall rear-first with an impact of 49g. ==Qualifying== Alexander Albon was unable to compete in Qualifying after a crash in Free Practice 3 earlier in the day. The first qualifying session finished with no incidents with Valtteri Bottas setting the fastest lap of the session ahead of Charles Leclerc and teammate Lewis Hamilton. Qualifying ended with the elimination of Lance Stroll, George Russell, Robert Kubica, Antonio Giovinazzi and Albon, the last two of whom failed to set a time in the session. The second qualifying session ended without incident with Hamilton setting the fastest lap on the medium tyre compound. Bottas, Sebastian Vettel, Leclerc and Max Verstappen also set their laps on the medium compound tyre. Daniil Kvyat, Sergio P\u00e9rez, Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Lando Norris were eliminated from qualifying. The third qualifying session ended without incident with most drivers having two chances to set a fastest lap. After the first runs, Bottas was quickest with Hamilton and Vettel rounding off the top 3. When setting up their second runs, Verstappen was overtaken at turn 14 by Vettel and both Renault cars, this prevented him crossing the line before the end of the session. Pierre Gasly and both Haas cars were also unable to start a lap before the session ended as a result. At the end of the session, Bottas was on pole position 0.023 seconds ahead of Hamilton in second. Vettel qualified third. The rest of the top ten consisted of, in qualifying order, Leclerc, Verstappen, Gasly, Daniel Ricciardo, Nico H\u00fclkenberg, Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean. ===Qualifying classification=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:85%\" !rowspan=2| !rowspan=2| !rowspan=2|Driver !rowspan=2|Constructor !colspan=3| !rowspan=2| |- !Q1 !Q2 !Q3 |- !1 |align=\"center\"|77 |data-sort-value=\"BOT\"| Valtteri Bottas |Mercedes |1:32.658 |1:31.728 |1:31.547 |align=\"center\"|1 |- !2 |align=\"center\"|44 |data-sort-value=\"HAM\"| Lewis Hamilton |Mercedes |1:33.115 |1:31.637 |1:31.570 |align=\"center\"|2 |- !3 |align=\"center\"|5 |data- sort-value=\"VET\"| Sebastian Vettel |Ferrari |1:33.557 |1:32.232 |1:31.848 |align=\"center\"|3 |- !4 |align=\"center\"|16 |data-sort-value=\"LEC\"| Charles Leclerc |Ferrari |1:32.712 |1:32.324 |1:31.865 |align=\"center\"|4 |- !5 |align=\"center\"|33 |data-sort-value=\"VER\"| | |1:33.274 |1:32.369 |1:32.089 |align=\"center\"|5 |- !6 |align=\"center\"|10 |data-sort-value=\"GAS\"| | |1:33.863 |1:32.948 |1:32.930 |align=\"center\"|6 |- !7 |align=\"center\"|3 |data-sort- value=\"RIC\"| | |1:33.709 |1:33.214 |1:32.958 |align=\"center\"|7 |- !8 |align=\"center\"|27 |data-sort-value=\"HUL\"| | |1:33.644 |1:32.968 |1:32.962 |align=\"center\"|8 |- !9 |align=\"center\"|20 |data-sort-value=\"MAG\"| | |1:34.036 |1:33.150 |data-sort-value=\"9\"|No time |align=\"center\"|9 |- !10 |align=\"center\"|8 |data-sort-value=\"GRO\"| | |1:33.752 |1:33.156 |data-sort- value=\"9.1\"|No time |align=\"center\"|10 |- !11 |align=\"center\"|26 |data-sort- value=\"KVY\"| | |1:33.783 |1:33.236 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |align=\"center\"|11 |- !12 |align=\"center\"|11 |data-sort- value=\"PER\"| | |1:34.026 |1:33.299 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |align=\"center\"|12 |- !13 |align=\"center\"|7 |data-sort- value=\"RAI\"| | |1:34.125 |1:33.419 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |align=\"center\"|13 |- !14 |align=\"center\"|55 |data-sort- value=\"SAI\"| | |1:33.686 |1:33.523 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |align=\"center\"|14 |- !15 |align=\"center\"|4 |data-sort- value=\"NOR\"| | |1:34.148 |1:33.967 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |align=\"center\"|15 |- !16 |align=\"center\"|18 |data-sort- value=\"STR\"| | |1:34.292 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |align=\"center\"|16 |- !17 |align=\"center\"|63 |data-sort-value=\"RUS\"| | |1:35.253 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |align=\"center\"|17 |- !18 |align=\"center\"|88 |data-sort-value=\"KUB\"| | |1:35.281 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |align=\"center\"|18 |-class=\"sortbottom\" !data-sort- value=\"ZZZ\" colspan=\"8\" |107% time: 1:39.144 |- !data-sort-value=\"19\"| | align=\"center\" |99 | data-sort-value=\"GIO\" | | Alfa Romeo Racing-Ferrari |No time | style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\" |N/A | style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\" |N/A | align=\"center\" |19 |- !data-sort-value=\"20\"| | align=\"center\" |23 | data-sort-value=\"ALB\" | | Scuderia Toro Rosso-Honda |No time | style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\" |N/A | style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\" |N/A | align=\"center\" data-sort-value=\"20\" | |- !colspan=\"8\"| Source: |} ;Notes * \u2013 Antonio Giovinazzi failed to set a time during qualifying and was permitted to race at the stewards' discretion. * \u2013 Alexander Albon did not take part in qualifying after crashing in FP3 and was permitted to race at the stewards' discretion.
