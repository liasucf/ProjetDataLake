Cordero began the 2017 season with El Paso. The Padres promoted Cordero to the Major Leagues on May 27, 2017, as regular center fielder Manuel Margot went to the disabled list with a strained calf. He made his major league debut that day, striking out against Stephen Strasburg as a pinch hitter. Cordero started hot, collecting 19 hits in his first 17 games, but then only had one hit in his final 10 games before he was sent back to El Paso on Margot's return.

He was the Padres regular starter in left field before he was sent to the disabled list on May 28 with forearm soreness. Cordero began a rehab assignment in El Paso in June, but pain in his right elbow led to the diagnosis of a bone spur after an MRI. Surgery on the elbow ended Cordero's Major League season, but he played in the Dominican Winter League.
