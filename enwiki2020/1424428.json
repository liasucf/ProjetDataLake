    "text": "Elections in Haiti gives information on election and election results in Haiti. The Constitution of Haiti provides for the election of the President, Parliament, and members of local governing bodies. The current president is Michel Joseph Martelly, who received 68 percent of the votes in the Haitian general election, 2010\u20132011. Elections, delayed after a political impasse, are planned to be held for both the Presidency and Parliament in 2015. ==2010-2011 elections== The latest presidential election took place on November 28, 2010, with a run-off election taking place on March 20, 2011. No candidate received a majority of the vote cast in the first-round election. A second round was scheduled for March 20, 2011 with the two highest vote-getters, Mirlande Manigat and Jude C\u00e9lestin. Protests claiming fraudulent voting resulted in the electoral commission removing C\u00e9lestin from the race. This promoted Martelly from his original third-place finish in the first-round, to face Manigat in the run-off. ==2010 and following== The last presidential election was held on 28 November 2010 with a runoff on 20 March 2011. Michel Martelly won the runoff election held on 20 March 2011 with 67.6% of the vote against 31.7% for Mirlande Manigat and was sworn into office on 14 May 2011. The next presidential election is to be held in 2015. A president may not serve consecutive terms. The President named as Prime Minister Laurent Lamothe, who was subsequently ratified by the National Assembly. Prime Minister Lamothe took office on 16 May 2012. He subsequently resigned in 2014 after a series of protests. The bicameral National Assembly of Haiti (Assembl\u00e9e Nationale) consists of the Chamber of Deputies (Chambre des D\u00e9put\u00e9s) and the Senate (S\u00e9nat). The Chamber of Deputies has ninety-nine members, who are elected by popular vote for four-year terms. The Senate consists of thirty members elected by popular vote to serve six-year terms, with one third elected every two years. The last elections were held on 28 November 2010 with run-off elections on 20 March 2011. Election results: 2010 Senate - percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - Inite 6, ALTENATIV 4, LAVNI 1; 2010 Chamber of Deputies- percent of vote by party - NA; seats by party - Inite 32, Altenativ 11, Ansanm Nou Fo 10, AAA 8, LAVNI 7, RASANBLE 4, KONBIT 3, MOCHRENA 3, Platforme Liberation 3, PONT 3, Repons Peyizan 3, Independent 2, MAS 2, MODELH-PRDH 1, PLAPH 1, RESPE 1, Veye Yo 1, vacant 4. The next Senate election, for one third of the seats, was to be held in 2012 but was not called. On 22 November 2013, President Martelly convened an extraordinary session of the National Assembly and a bill respecting elections was passed, paving the way for the overdue and scheduled elections. In January 2015, after a series of disputed, unconstitutional, electoral commissions named by President Martelly were rejected by the legislature, a Provisional Elections Committee was inaugurated and began planning presidential and parliamentary elections later in 2015. ==References== ==External links== * *Adam Carr's Election Archive *International Mission for Monitoring Haitian Elections *IFES Observer Mission in Haiti Photo Gallery *European Union Election Observation Mission to Haiti (in French) ",
