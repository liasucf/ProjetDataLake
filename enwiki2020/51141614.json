    "text": "The \u00c9pinal-Erfurt glossary is a glossary of terms. It consists of two manuscripts (\u00c9pinal and Erfurt), and contains terms in Old English. It has been described as \"The earliest body of written English\", and is thought to have been compiled at Malmesbury for Aldhelm (c. 639-709). ==Manuscripts== Two main manuscripts of the Glossary exist today: * \u00c9pinal, France, Biblioth\u00e8que municipale, MS72 (2), fols. 94\u2013107, around the turn of the seventh to eighth centuries, England (perhaps specifically Southumbria). * Erfurt, Germany, Wissenschaftliche Bibliothek, MS Amplonianus, MS 2o42, fols. 1\u201314v, from the first quarter of the ninth century. (This contains other glossaries too; the one shared with the \u00c9pinal manuscript is known as \"Erfurt I\".) However, parts of the glossary are also found in other manuscripts, most importantly the Second Corpus Glossary, which contains amidst other glosses a complete text of the \u00c9pinal-Erfurt Glossary, descended independently from a common exemplar.Phillip Pulsiano, \u2018Prayers, Glosses and Glossaries\u2019, in A Companion to Anglo-Saxon Literature, ed. by Phillip Pulsiano and Elaine Treharne (Oxford, 2001), pp. 209\u201330 (p. 218). ==Facsimiles== * The \u00c9pinal Glossary, Latin and Old English, ed. by Henry Sweet, Early English Text Society, o.s. 79b (London: Tr\u00fcbner, 1883). * Bischoff, Bernhard, Mildred Budny, Geoffrey Harlow, M.
