It was designed by Slovenian architect Edvard Ravnikar and was originally intended to be built as a beach resort at Budva in Montenegro, in Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. When that project fell through, the plans were re-used and slightly adjusted for the new site in Baghdad.https://abe.revues.org/924 The hotel originally opened in 1982 as the Babylon Oberoi Hotel, managed by Oberoi Hotels & Resorts.https://abe.revues.org/924 The interiors were designed by Indian architect Sunita Kohli. Oberoi severed their connection with the hotel due to the 1991 Gulf War. On January 25, 2010 the Babylon Hotel was the site of a car bomb attack. The hotel joined the Warwick Hotels and Resorts chain in October 2014 as the Babylon Warwick Hotel.
