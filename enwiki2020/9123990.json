    "text": "Juno Falls are a folk pop band comprising songwriter/frontman Myles O Reilly and his band, hailing from Dublin, Ireland. Fans include Brad Pitt. ==History== Juno Falls began in 2003 when songwriter Myles O Reilly hooked up with producer Herbie Macken (previous keys player for Niel Finn of Crowded House and Gavin Friday) and friends, bass player Dara Diffily and drummer David Shakespeare. From that 2 week recording session in a cottage near the remote fishing village of Schull on the south coast of Ireland Starlight Drive Juno Falls debut album was born. After much radio-play success Myles O Reilly attracted the attentions of major labels and signed with Richard Branson's V2 music in 2006 with whom he released the critically acclaimed album 'Weightless' in 2007. ==Sound== Juno Falls have often been compared to many of the New Acoustic Movement's bands spawned in the new century such as Elbow, Iron and wine, and Turin Brakes. Although accessible and crossover, Myles O Reilly is never predictable and delivers music that is always mature, quirky and unique. Affording at every turn to surprise and sometimes perplex the listener while staying within the boundaries of conventional immediate song structure. In recent times, O'Reilly has started to use a sampler / loop pedal to \"sample\" self-made sounds throughout songs in his live shows. The most talked about feature to his live set is his solo re-working of Juno Falls hit '[This Song Is Your Own]' using only vocal loops. ==Trivia== * Myles O Reilly designed all the artwork for Juno Falls releases. * Myles father Brendan O Reilly was famous in Ireland for holding the Irish High-Jump record for 25 years. He was also Ireland's national television 'Sunday sports' presenter and he pursued a career in film and television acting, appearing in the epic Warner Bros. film about two runaway children Flight of the Doves in 1969. * It was Nick Seymour from Australian band Crowded House that discovered and assisted in making Juno Falls first demo's. Later assisting in the band recording their debut album with keyboardist for Neil Finn (crowded house frontman) Herbie Macken. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Starlight Drive (2004) SN8/Sony music publishing CD/LP * Weightless (2008) V2 Music Ireland CD/LP ===Releases=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"40\"|Year !Song !Label !Format !Album |- |align=\"center\"|2004 |\"This Song Is Your Own\" |N8 |7\"/CD |Starlight Drive |- |align=\"center\"|2004 |\"Kiss Me\" |N8 |7\"/CD |Starlight Drive |- |align=\"center\"|2007 |\"ATOM BOMB\" |V2 Music Ireland |Mini Album |2007 |- |align=\"center\"|2007 |\"Weightless\" |V2 Music Ireland |Album |2007 |} ===Compilations=== Juno Falls tracks have appeared on the following compilation CDs: {| class=\"wikitable\" !
