    "text": "Galyani Vadhana, Princess of Naradhiwas (; ; ; 6 May 1923 \u2013 2 January 2008) was a princess of Thailand and the elder sister of King Ananta Mahidol (Rama VIII) and King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX). She was also a direct granddaughter of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), and aunt of King Vajiralongkorn (Rama X). ==Biography== ===Early life=== Galyani Vadhana's brothers. Princess Galyani Vadhana was born on 6 May 1923 in London, England, the only daughter of Prince Mahidol Adulyadej of Songkla, the sixty-ninth son of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) and seventh son by Queen Savang Vadhana, and Sangwan Talapat (later known as Srinagarindra, Princess Mother). She was initially named May Songkla on her birth certificate and was later named Her Serene Highness Galyani Vadhana Mahidol by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI). The word \"Vadhana\" in her name came from her paternal grandmother, Savang Vadhana. In 1927, she was subsequently promoted to the royal rank, a Princess of Thailand (Her Highness) by King Prajadhipok (Rama VII). ===Education=== In 1935, Princess Galyani Vadhana attended a secondary school for girls named Ecole Superieure des Jeunes Filles de la Ville de Lausanne. In 1938, she attended the International School of Geneva, a boarding school not far from Lausanne. She was an excellent student, and eventually came first of her school at the final exam and third in all Switzerland. In 1942, Princess Galyani Vadhana continued her studies at the Faculty of Sciences in the field of chemistry at the University of Lausanne. She graduated with a bachelor of science degree in chemistry in 1948. While pursuing her science degree, she also studied social science and education for a Diplome de Sciences Sociales Pedagogiques, involving teacher education, literature, philosophy, and psychology. ===Marriage=== In 1944, Princess Galyani Vadhana renounced her royal status in order to marry Colonel Aram Rattanakul Serireongrit (24 August 1920 \u2013 3 February 1982), the son of General Luang Serireongrit (Charoon Ratanakul Serireongrit), a former Army commander-in-chief who led the invasion of the Shan States during World War II. They are the parents of one daughter, Thanpuying Dhasanawalaya Ratanakul Serireongrit (later Sornsongkram) (born in 1945 in Switzerland). This marriage ended in divorce. In 1950, when the current king ascended the throne, he reinstated her royal status. In 1969 the princess married Prince Varananda Dhavaj (19 August 1922 \u2013 15 September 1990), son of Prince Chudadhuj Dharadilok, Prince of Bejraburna and Mom Ravi Kayananda. They had no children. ===Royal title=== On 6 May 1995 \u2013 the occasion of her 72nd birthday \u2013 her brother, King Bhumibol gave her the noble title \"Kromma Luang Naradhiwas Rajanagarindra\" (loosely translated 'Princess of Naradhiwas'), making her the only female member of the Chakri Royal Family in the reign of King Rama IX to have been bestowed this title. In announcing the honour, The king said \"the Princess, who was his only sister, had shared the joys and sorrows of life since their early years and was the most highly respected in that she had always given him support. Furthermore, it is a well- known fact that she has been steadfast in her devotion to the King in order that He would enjoy grace and glory.\" She had represented the king in carrying out various royal duties and had took good care of their mother, which was a great relief to him. ===Royal projects=== The princess' royal patronage projects included traditional Thai arts, education, sports, and social welfare. She was president or honorary president of various organisations and foundations, including the Cardiac Children's Foundation, the Princess Mother's Charity Fund, and the Autistic Foundation of Thailand. She created her own foundation for funding the studies of young, gifted musicians. She was a patron of various classical music foundations. On her trips, she always gathered important and useful information shown in the royal news, giving knowledge to people. She also wrote books, poetry, and spoke French. She traveled widely within Thailand and abroad to represent the royal family and her country on missions. ===Health issues=== The princess was admitted to Siriraj Hospital in June 2007, suffering from abdominal pains. The doctors found she had cancer, and she remained in the hospital for treatment. In October 2007, doctors reported the princess had suffered an infarction on the left side of her brain as a result of occlusion of a cerebral artery. At the same time in October, her brother, King Bhumibol Adulyadej was treated at Siriraj after he experienced weakness on his right side; doctors later found out through scans that he had a blood shortage to his brain. He was admitted on 13 October and discharged on 7 November. After leaving Siriraj, he visited his sister at the hospital almost daily. On 14 December, the Royal Household Bureau released its 25th statement about the princess's health, saying she was feeling increasingly tired and was becoming less responsive. ==Interests== ===Books and writing=== Galyani Vadhana and Bhumibol in 1938. Princess Galyani Vadhana liked reading and writing from an early age. While studying Prathom 1 to Prathom 3, she read as many Thai language books as she could find. However, children's books in Thai were then rare so she often read the newspaper. She remembered once reading a story in the original French\u2014the 1878 novel Sans Famille\u2014while studying in Switzerland, which she later found again. During her secondary studies, especially while in Geneva, Switzerland, she read a lot of literature. She found that reading developed her French language skills. Later, when she was a French teacher at Thammasat University, she read many books on linguistics. In addition, she also studied art, culture, archaeology, and history for many years. When she planned visiting a foreign country, she would first read many books and documents about it. When she was nine, she published a journal, Ruaen Rom, containing articles she had written with her friends at Srapathum Palace. Her mother supported her in reading and writing English. On 10 September 1932, she published a story she had written. In addition, she wrote eleven poems about the royal family, translated three books, wrote ten tourist guide books, and an academic article. ===Photography=== Princess Galyani Vadhana was interested in photography. She had learned to take photographs not only as souvenirs but also for art and academic purposes. When she visited important places either at home or abroad, she always took photographs of those she found interesting which were useful in her travel writings. ===Music=== Princess Galyani Vadhana studied Western art. She was interested in all types of music and drama, especially classical music by master composers. She began listening classical music while studying in Switzerland. She had always studied piano at home with her younger brothers, but only intermittently as she had very little time to practice. While doing her homework, she liked to listen to classical music on a radio. In 2004, concerned about the lack of interest in promoting classical music by both governmental and private sectors, she established a Fund for Classical Music Promotion of which she became president. The fund supported classical music and related activities, provided assistance to Thai musicians to study, and promoted competitions and concerts both in Thailand and internationally. She also supported the Bangkok Symphony Orchestra and the Chulalongkorn University Symphony Orchestra, and was the patron of the Bangkok Opera. ===Education=== Princess Galyani Vadhana was interested in all education, not only at university level. She realized that primary education is very important for developing the general population. From her long experience in teaching French language, she realized the problem of interrupted French language study at mattayom (high school) and university level. In 1977 she formed L'Association Thailandaise des Professeurs de Francais (The Association of Thai Professors Teaching French Language) to act as the center for meeting and exchanging experiences of \u2013 and improving \u2013 the teaching of French language in mattayom and university classes. She was president of the association between 1977 and 1981, when she became its honorary president for the rest of her life. Her assistance to the association took many forms, including in publishing journals to distribute the latest knowledge, writing her own articles in journals, and supporting teachers' seminars, research abroad and study in higher education. As a result of her continuous work in the teaching and research of the French language in Thailand, she was conferred many honorary doctorates and also honours from many foreign governments and international organizations, including UNESCO. ===Culture, Archaeology, and History=== Princess Galyani Vadhana was interested in history and archaeology for many years. She thought these fields to be the foundations of other subjects and believed in applying reasoning to support historical ideas. She always said that her thoughts were not always correct and she would accept new data if supported by reason and evidences. In performing her duties, she became interested in many important places, which she later visited by herself. She also led groups and associations on educational tours to many historic sites, and she advised fellow guides to emphasize education about the sites. When visiting historical sites, she did not merely accept information given to her by the archaeologists, but she would research the sites beforehand, and deeply question experts about the site's restoration and excavation, and the impact on neighbouring people of the archaeologists' operations. ==Duties== ===Medical Services and Public Health=== ====The Cardiac Children Foundation of Thailand==== This foundation was begun in 1981 by the Princess Mother. Princess Galyani Vadhana became its patron on 15 June 1984. She added some of her personal property to her mother's fund and provided personal advice, thus developing its activities. It helps many sick children, especially from poor families, to be cured and treated by professional cardiac doctors, using mechanical heart valve replacement, heart pacemaker, balloon catheter, and surgery without prosthesis. Furthermore, this foundation disseminates knowledge of cardiac diseases to doctors, nurses, and the public. It also provides funds for pediatricians to study cardiac diseases in children either in Thailand or abroad. ====The HSH Princess Boonjirathorn (Chumphon) Juthathuj Foundation==== This is a foundation set up by Princess Boonjirathorn Juthathuj on 27 June 1979 to provide scholarships and awards to medical and nursing students, nursing lecturers, and nurses affiliated with Ministry of Public Health. Its President was Princess Galyani Vadhana who chaired the scholarship and award conferring committee. The first prize-giving by Princess Boonjirathorn was organized at Samitivej Hospital on 18 September 1979. Afterwards scholarships and awards were given by the Princess every year. ====The Breast Foundation==== This foundation was created in December 1994 from Charity Funds of the Princess Mother. Princess Galyani Vadhana was President, while her mother was Patron and Honorary President. Its objective is to promote knowledge and understanding of breast cancer screening. The Breast Center was established in Siriraj Hospital to provide complete breast diseases examination and diagnosis. With the modern equipment in the center, the first in Thailand, breast radiography can be carried out to enable biopsies to be carried out accurately, correctly, with very little pain. It is also timesaving and less expensive. ====The Mother Princess Medical Volunteer Foundation==== In 1964, while the Mother Princess was staying at Phu Phing Palace, Chiang Mai, she realised how poor the local populace were especially in food and medicine. She set up \"The Mother Princess Medical Volunteer Unit\" on 22 February 1969, and persuaded doctors, dentists, pharmacists, and nurses to join the unit to go and treat patients in remote communities. On 21 May 1974, the unit was renamed to become \"The Mother Princess Medical Volunteer Foundation\" with the Mother Princess as its President. Princess Galyani Vadhana followed her mother's example in the foundation's daily operations. Together they would lead volunteers to visit and treat people in rural areas. Some patients were sent for treatment at the provincial central hospital or to Bangkok. They often journeyed by helicopters because some areas had no roads. After the Princess Mother died, Princess Galyani Vadhana became President. ===Nature and Environment Conservation=== In 1991, Princess Galyani Vadhana visited and stayed at Huai Nam Dang Watershed Management Unit. She found that the nearby forests were deteriorated as a result of agricultural reclamation, so she had the idea of forming a Royal Forest Department to restore the forests. Then in 1995, the Royal Forest Department designated this area as Huai Nam Dang National Park, and built a chalet-style palace, which the princess named \"Silver Orchids Palace\", dedicated to her. She stayed there during late January and early February every year to visit nearby hill tribes. Her thinking was that the public and local administration organization co- operate to look after forest, water, wildlife, and rare flora to maintain natural balance. ===Foreign Affairs=== Princess Galyani Vadhana traveled abroad many times on formal and private visits. In addition to strengthening friendly relations with those countries, her visits helped spread knowledge of Thai culture and customs. Before any such visit she would carry out careful research. After most of these visits, she collected her notes and the information she had gathered to publish books or reproduce them in digital media for distribution. In 2003 she visited Gretzenbach in Switzerland to officially dedicate the Wat Srinagarindravararam, a temple named in honour of her mother.Srinagarin ==Writings== ===About the royal family=== * Busy Fingers * Postcard Games * Prince Mahidol and Art * Popular Chronicle From The Press, The Demise of the Princess Mother ===Translation=== * Le Couronnement Espagnol \u2013 The Spanish Coronation ===Travelogue=== * Yunnan * Bhutan : Green Island on Land * Is It Cold in Siberia? * Turkey : Land of the Roman Emperors and Ottoman Sultans * Xinjiang and Gansu : Pictures from Far Away Places * Eastern China : Mountain, Lake, Temples ==Foundations and associations== ===As honorary president=== * The Mother Princess Medical Volunteer Foundation * The Prosthesis Foundation of H.R.H.
