    "text": "Black Hammer is an American ongoing comic series created by writer Jeff Lemire and artist Dean Ormston, published by Dark Horse Comics. ==Plot== Ten years ago, Black Hammer and six other superheroes had saved Spiral City from the Anti-God, but in process became trapped in Rockwood, a timeless Twilight Zone- ish town. Shortly after the heroes arrive, Black Hammer dies. In the present, the six heroes live on Black Hammer farm with very little hope of ever escaping Rockwood. ==Publication history== Jeff Lemire originally conceived of Black Hammer in 2007, intending to draw the story himself after the end of Essex County. In 2008 he pitched the series to Dark Horse editor Diana Schutz. The pitch was accepted, but Lemire was unable to begin work until he finished The Nobody and Sweet Tooth for Vertigo, then his exclusivity contract for DC Comics prevented him from working on the series from 2010 to 2014. When Lemire returned to the series in 2014, he was working on so many projects that drawing it himself was no longer possible, so he teamed up with artist Dean Ormston for the title. According to Lemire, it was important for Black Hammer to not to look anything like mainstream superhero comics. He wanted the series to stand outside of superhero comics and comment on them, not become one of them. For this, Ormston's art style was deemed perfect. Black Hammer #1 was originally scheduled for release March 2015, however Ormston suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, which left the right side of his body partially paralyzed. After months of rehabilitation, Ormston recovered. The first issue of Black Hammer came out July the following year. Lemire continued working on the series while Ormston recovered. Dean Ormston's working pace was greatly reduced, however, so he sometimes works with layout assistance from Peter Gross. Because of this, Lemire has scripts written well ahead of the release schedule. In September 2017, shortly after the cliffhanger ending of Black Hammer #13, Dark Horse Comics announced the series had ended and that it would relaunch as Black Hammer: Age of Doom in 2018. Lemire explained the name change in a press release: > \u201cOne thing Black Hammer has always done is comment on the history of > superhero comics and we live in a world where superhero universes seem to be > rebooted, relaunched, and rebirthed every year. It felt like we needed to > play around with that idea, but put a Black Hammer spin on it.\u201d In July 2019, Lemire revealed that the story of the heroes on Black Hammer farm he had set out to tell when he had originally pitched Black Hammer would conclude with Black Hammer: Age of Doom #12. However, he called this the end of \"Phase I\" and went on to tease developments for Phase II with more spinoffs and a new core Black Hammer series focused on Lucy Weber and with Dean Ormston continuing on as artist. The title for the upcoming series will be Black Hammer: Reborn. ===The World of Black Hammer=== In 2017, Jeff Lemire started to expand the Black Hammer universe with spinoff titles, starting with Sherlock Frankenstein and the Legion of Evil. The spinoffs can be recognized by a black banner along the top of the cover which says \"From the world of Black Hammer\". There have been several spinoffs with more planned. The universe of Black Hammer and its spinoffs is frequently referred to as \"The Hammerverse\" (not to be confused with David Drake's Hammerverse) by editor Daniel Chabon in the letter columns, though this name does not appear to be part of any official branding. ====Sherlock Frankenstein==== In July 2017, Dark Horse Comics announced Sherlock Frankenstein and the Legion of Evil, a Black Hammer spinoff miniseries written by Jeff Lemire with art by David Rub\u00edn. The series focused on Lucy Weber, a nineteen-year-old investigative reporter searching for the truth about what happened ten years ago when her father, the Black Hammer, disappeared. ====Doctor Andromeda==== In December 2017, Den of Geek announced a second Black Hammer spinoff miniseries, Doctor Star and the Kingdom of Lost Tomorrows, written by Jeff Lemire with art by Max Fiumara. The series focuses on Doctor Star (later renamed Doctor Andromeda), a Golden Age superhero and contemporary of Abraham Slam. The series was retitled \"Doctor Andromeda and the Kingdom of Lost Tomorrows\" following a legal issue with another publisher. As Lemire himself explained in a 2020 interview: > \u201cI have been cagey about this because the honest truth is that there was a > legal issue with the name and its similarity to another publisher\u2019s > character and there is very little I can actually discuss. But we worked it > out very amicably with that other publisher and we agreed to change his name > and costume a bit. Not any drama or anything, it was all very civil. The > good thing is the name changed, but the story is exactly the same. And that > original printing of Doctor Star trades and floppies will probably be > collector\u2019s items to a degree now, I guess. This being Black Hammer, I do > have a fun meta way of explaining the name change within the universe itself > that will unfold next year in some new Black Hammer projects.\u201d Doctor Andromeda originally appeared in a cameo role in the original Black Hammer series as an homage to Starman, specifically the incarnation written by James Robinson, to the point that the character's alter ego was named \"Jimmy Robinson\". ====The Quantum Age==== On March 27, 2018, Dark Horse Comics announced The Quantum Age, a spinoff set in 2141 (originally 3041, but this date was revised in the trade paperback) about a group of superheroes, inspired by the heroes of Black Hammer Farm. ====Black Hammer \u201945==== On December 7, 2018, SyFy Wire announced Black Hammer \u201945, a four-issue miniseries about the Black Hammer Squadron in World War II. This miniseries marks the first time a Black Hammer title isn't solely written by Jeff Lemire, with Ray Fawkes joining as co-writer. ====Skulldigger + Skeleton Boy==== Just prior to SDCC 2019, Newsarama announced Skulldigger + Skeleton Boy, a six- issue miniseries about the vigilante Skulldigger, written by Jeff Lemire with art by Tonci Zonjic. The series had previously been mentioned in the Stranger Things / Black Hammer Free Comic Book Day 2019 issue and in The World of Black Hammer one-shot. Jeff Lemire said that this book would be the first title in \"Phase II\" of the Black Hammer universe. ====Colonel Weird==== On January 9, 2020, the Hollywood Reporter announced Colonel Weird: Cosmagog, a four-issue miniseries written by Jeff Lemire with art by Tyler Crook. It will look at Colonel Randall Weird's past and his future beyond the ending of Black Hammer: Age of Doom. Lemire described the series as a bridge from the Phase I Black Hammer series to the stories he has planned for the future. ====Barbalien==== On March 12, 2020, the Hollywood Reporter announced Barbalien: Red Planet, a five-issue miniseries written by Jeff Lemire and Tate Brombal with art by Gabriel Hern\u00e1ndez Walta. The miniseries will explore Mark Markz's time as a police officer during the 1980s AIDS crisis. It was originally scheduled to launch in LGBTQ Pride Month, but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ===Crossovers=== In March 2019, Dark Horse Comics and DC Comics announced a five-issue Black Hammer and Justice League crossover miniseries called \"Hammer of Justice!\" written by Jeff Lemire and drawn by Michael Walsh. In the initial announcement, Lemire assured readers he was going to keep Black Hammer character driven without endless tie-ins and events. \"Hammer of Justice!\" is not \"a throwaway \u2018imaginary story\u2019\" either, and will have lasting repercussions in future Black Hammer stories. When discussing whether there could be further crossovers in future, Lemire said, \"If there is a very good story to be told, I am open to it, but I doubt we will see many, or any, other crossovers in the future. This particular opportunity really worked and was a great once in a lifetime chance to tell a really fun story.\" ===Issues=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" width=\"100%\" |- !Series !Issue !Release Date !Story !Art !Colors !Letters !Cover |- |colspan=8 style=\"background: #000000;\"| |- |rowspan=14|Black Hammer |#1 |July 20, 2016 |rowspan=14|Jeff Lemire |rowspan=6|Dean Ormston |rowspan=6|Dave Stewart |rowspan=6|Todd Klein | *Dean Ormston *Jeff Lemire (variant) *Dustin Nguyen (SDCC 2016 variant) *F\u00e1bio Moon (ECCC 2018 variant) |- |#2 |August 17, 2016 |rowspan=5| *Dean Ormston *Jeff Lemire (variants) |- |#3 |September 21, 2016 |- |#4 |October 19, 2016 |- |#5 |November 16, 2016 |- |#6 |December 21, 2016 |- |Giant-Sized Annual (2017) |January 18, 2017 |Michael Allred Ray Fawkes Matt Kindt Emi Lenox Dustin Nguyen Nate Powell |Ray Fawkes Sharlene Kindt Dave Stewart |Todd Klein | *Jeff Lemire |- |#7 |March 22, 2017 |rowspan=2|Dean Ormston |rowspan=2|Dave Stewart |rowspan=2|Todd Klein |rowspan=2| *Dean Ormston *Jeff Lemire (variants) |- |#8 |April 19, 2017 |- |#9 |May 24, 2017 |colspan=3|David Rub\u00edn | *David Rub\u00edn *Jeff Lemire (variant) |- |#10 |June 21, 2017 |rowspan=2|Dean Ormston |rowspan=2|Dave Stewart |rowspan=2|Todd Klein |rowspan=2| *Dean Ormston *Jeff Lemire (variants) |- |#11 |July 26, 2017 |- |#12 |August 23, 2017 |colspan=3|David Rub\u00edn | *David Rub\u00edn *Jeff Lemire (variant) |- |#13 |September 20, 2017 |Dean Ormston |Dave Stewart |Todd Klein | *Dean Ormston *Jeff Lemire (variant) |- |colspan=8 style=\"background: #000000;\"| |- |rowspan=4|Sherlock Frankenstein and the Legion of Evil |#1 |October 18, 2017 |rowspan=4|Jeff Lemire |colspan=3 rowspan=4|David Rub\u00edn | *David Rub\u00edn *Mike Mignola (variant) *Darren Warren Johnson (ECCC 2018 variant) |- |#2 |November 22, 2017 | *David Rub\u00edn *Dean Ormston (variant) |- |#3 |December 20, 2017 | *David Rub\u00edn *Duncan Fegredo (variant) |- |#4 |January 24, 2018 | *David Rub\u00edn *Jeff Lemire (variant) |- |colspan=8 style=\"background: #000000;\"| |- |rowspan=4|Doctor Star and the Kingdom of Lost Tomorrows |#1 |March 7, 2018 |rowspan=4|Jeff Lemire |rowspan=4|Max Fiumara |rowspan=4|Dave Stewart |rowspan=4|Nate Piekos | *Max Fiumara *Declan Shalvey & Jordie Bellaire (variant) *Jeff Lemire (ComicsPRO variant) |- |#2 |April 4, 2018 | *Max Fiumara *J.G.
