    "text": "Paul Radley is an Australian writer. ==Life and writing career== Radley was born and raised in Newcastle, NSW; by the time he was 16 years old, having dropped out of school, he took a job as a storeman at David Jones. In 1981, Radley won Australian/Vogel Literary Award for the book \"Jack Rivers and Me\". After receiving the $10,000 prize, the book was published by Allen and Unwin, sponsors of the price. Following that the Literature Board of the Australia Council presented him with a writer\u2019s fellowship. This led to the publication of two more novels by Radley. He was also a writer-in-residence at St. Andrews University, Scotland, where he received a fellowship from the Literature Board. ==Controversy== In March 1996, Radley claimed that he had not had anything to do with the authorship of 'Jack Rivers and Me'. He claimed that his great uncle Jack Radley had written the manuscript, but had been too old to enter the competition. However, in May of that year, Jack Radely admitted to have assembled the manuscript from his own previously unpublished stories but argued that Paul Radley had made a significant contribution by taping conversations that were subsequently used in the manuscript. Jack Radley had asked his great nephew to enter the competition on his behalf. ==References== Category:Australian writers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
