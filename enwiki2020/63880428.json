Portuguese Pioneers of Vietnamese Linguistics. Bangkok: Orchid Press, 2002. In the years between 1611 and 1617 he studied at St. Paul's College, Macau, where he was exposed to the works of Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues T\u00e7uzu. The latter was a Portuguese Jesuit who had pioneered transliteration of Japanese into Latin alphabet using phonetics of the Portuguese language. Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues T\u00e7uzu arrived in Macau from Japan in 1614, 6 years after completing his most famous work about Japanese grammar, Arte da Lingoa de Iapam. Francisco de Pina arrived in \u0110\u00e0ng Trong (called Cochinchina by Europeans at the time) in 1617 in order to replace the Jesuit Diogo de Carvalho in the missionary work of evangelization developed together with the Italian Francesco Buzomi in modern Vietnam since 1615. At the time there were two Portuguese Jesuit residences in \u0110\u00e0ng Trong: modern H\u1ed9i An and Qui Nh\u01a1n. Pina took residence in H\u1ed9i An, but his missionary work was spread between the two Jesuit missions. Francisco de Pina drowned at sea in modern C\u1eeda \u0110\u1ea1i on 15 December 1625 while trying to rescue guests on a wrecked boat. His body was buried in an unknown location in H\u1ed9i An. == Works == Although no works of Francisco de Pina survive today, he is considered to be the first European able to speak fluent Vietnamese, a skill which he used in his missionary work.Do, Quang Chinh, SJ. Dong Ten Trong Xa Hoi Dai Viet - The Society of Jesus in the Vietnamese Society. Montreal: Anton & Duoc Sang. 2007:72 Pina believed that such skill was a fundamental part of the evangelization work, and repeatedly accused his fellow clergymen of not acting in the same manner.Dror, Olga ed. Views of Seventeenth-century Vietnam, Christoforo Borri on Cochinchina and Samuel Baron on Tonkin. Ithaca, NY: Cornell Southeast Asia Program, 2006 Pina pioneered the method of recording the Vietnamese language with Latin characters, which forms the basis of modern Vietnamese alphabet, while teaching his disciples the Vietnamese language. The most famous of these is Alexandre de Rhodes, who published in 1651 in Rome the Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum, a trilingual dictionary between Vietnamese, Portuguese and Latin compiled by Alexandre Rhodes from the work of various Portuguese Jesuits (among which Gaspar do Amaral, Ant\u00f3nio Barbosa, Ant\u00f3nio de Fontes and Francisco de Pina himself). Francisco de Pina compiled a first vocabulary of the Vietnamese language in 1619, and reported to his superiors having composed a treatise on orthography and phonetics in 1622 or 1623. Some scholarsZwartjes, Otto. Portuguese Missionary Grammars in Asia, Africa and Brazil, 1550-1800 . Amsterdam: John Benjamins Publishing Co., 2011 have argued that Pina is responsible for writing a grammar based on which Honufer B\u00fcrgin compiled and edited the text Manuductio ad Linguam Tunkinensem independently of the work of Alexandre de Rhodes. Other scholars have challenged this conclusion by gathering evidence that the Manuductio ad Linguam Tunkinensem was written by Philippus Sibin using the Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum of Alexandre de Rhodes as a reference. == References == Category:Portuguese translators Category:17th-century Portuguese Jesuits Category:Portuguese Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Translators to Vietnamese Category:Creators of writing systems Category:17th-century Portuguese people Category:17th-century Jesuits Category:Jesuit missionaries in Vietnam Category:Jesuit missionaries Category:Portuguese expatriates in Vietnam Category:Portuguese Jesuits Category:Jesuit Asia missions Category:Jesuit missionaries in China Category:Missionary linguists Category:Linguists from Portugal Category:History of Catholicism in Vietnam Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Vietnam Category:1585 births Category:1625 deaths Category:Deaths by drowning Category:People from Guarda, Portugal ",
