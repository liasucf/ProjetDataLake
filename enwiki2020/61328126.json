During this period, he began writing about natural history, publishing \"Notes for Birdland\" in Savings Weekly, the journal of the State Savings Bank. For 20 years, he published \"The Out of Doors\", a weekly column in the Terang Express, using the nom-de-plume Neophema. In 1943, he joined the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union. He published several articles in the Union's flagship journal, The Emu, including \"Birds of Terang, South-western Victoria\".Binns G.

In his final years with the State Savings Bank, Binns was manager at several suburban branches (1951-56), at Horsham (1957-1960) and Box Hill (1961-64). During this period, he was also a prominent member of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union, serving as their Secretary from 1953-56 and again from 1959\u201363, and President from 1965\u201366. ==Death and legacy== Binns died in Blackburn, Victoria on September 24, 1976, just a few months after the death of his wife, Ilma. He was survived by his three daughters, Ruth, Phyllis and Meredith, and his son Greg. In an obituary published in the journal The Emu, W.R. Wheeler wrote that \"As one who worked with him on Council, I regarded his diligence and energy, particularly over his correspondence with members throughout Australia and overseas, as outstanding. He was truly one of the old school.\" ==References== Category:1899 births Category:1976 deaths Category:Australian ornithologists Category:20th-century zoologists ",
