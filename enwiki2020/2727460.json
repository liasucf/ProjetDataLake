    "text": "Former Barat College Old Main building, Lake Forest, Illinois.Old Main is a term often applied to the original building present on college or university campuses in the United States. The building serves today as home to administrative offices, such as the president or provost, but in its early inception may have served multiple functions, including classrooms and residences. Although many university campuses have outgrown the initial capacity of \"old mains\" and their geography has made them less central to university life than they once were, the building is commonly depicted in university or college marketing material to promote the longevity and tradition of the institution. Many old main buildings are surmounted by large towers, cupolas, or spires, occasionally housing bells or carillons.
