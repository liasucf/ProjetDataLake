    "text": "Abraham Lincoln High School, usually referred to simply as Lincoln High School, is a secondary school located in the Lincoln Heights district of Los Angeles, California, United States. It is located in the East Los Angeles-area community, surrounded by El Sereno, Chinatown, Boyle Heights and Cypress Park. The school is named after Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, and was one of the first public high schools established in California. It is one of the District 5 high schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest school district in the US. Lincoln students are drawn from Chinatown and other areas. Cypress Park residents may attend either Lincoln or Franklin high school. ==History== The early history of Lincoln High School is unusually complicated because, over the years, it has served all three of the typical grade configurations--elementary school, middle school and high school. What eventually became Lincoln High School was originally established in 1878 as Avenue 21 Grammar School. By 1913, the Avenue 21 school had become an intermediate school and its student population had grown to the point that a new campus was needed. That year the intermediate school moved to the present Lincoln High School site, and the curriculum expanded to include the senior high school grades. This marks the true beginning of Lincoln High. Pending the construction of a new school (the current site) on the former mansion property of Charles Woolwine, the Avenue 21 intermediate school moved its location to the hillside site (now the current physical education and track field), where students studied under the trees. \\- http://dbase1.lapl.org/webpics/calindex/cards/007/0614084-073.jpg In the early 1970s, students from all six upper grades attended the school together. In 1878, the plant was extended across Lincoln Park Avenue, which is now the current site. In 1881, the school added a gymnasium. In 1924, a science building was added. The present school was built extensively in the 1940s under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration reform. Much of the construction and renovations occurred after the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, which damaged the gymnasium, the auditorium, the music building, the library and the English building.http://www.laschools.org/employee/design/fs-studies-and- reports/download/LAUSD_Presentation_March_2002.pdf?version_id=1895945 Jim Tunney Stadium, home to Lincoln's football and track teams, was built during the reconstruction of Lincoln High School. Beginning in the latter part of the 1960s, Lincoln High School became a focal point for the emerging Chicano civil rights movement that was fueled by student activism which called for a more culturally sensitive educational curriculum and access to college preparatory courses for Mexican American students. Encouraged by Sal Castro, who championed equal educational opportunity as a Lincoln High faculty member, students at Lincoln organized a mass walk-out in protest of sub-standard facilities, vocational program tracking for Chicano youth and discriminatory practices which excluded them from advanced college prep courses. In March 1968, Lincoln High students led the first wave of what became the largest student strike in the history of public education in US. The \"Blow-out\" was joined by students from at least three other area high schools, among them Garfield, Roosevelt, Lincoln, Belmont and Wilson. In 2009 the opening of the Felicitas and Gonzalo Mendez Learning Centers relieved Lincoln.\"2.

It was the school's second baseball championship, and the first one since 1935. ==Demographics== === Demographics === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em; margin:auto;\" |+ 2019 Demographics of student body |- !
