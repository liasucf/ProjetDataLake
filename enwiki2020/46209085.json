    "text": "The Hamilton Bulldogs are a major junior ice hockey team in the Ontario Hockey League that began to play in the 2015\u201316 season. Based in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, the Bulldogs play their home games at the FirstOntario Centre. They were purchased by owner Michael Andlauer in March 2015 and re-located to Hamilton after a 34-year run in Belleville, where they were known as the Bulls. The Bulldogs replaced the American Hockey League team of the same name, also formerly owned by Andlauer. That original team played in Hamilton from 1996 to 2015, after which they moved to St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, to become the second incarnation of the St. John's IceCaps. ==History== On March 12, 2015, Michael Andlauer announced that he had acquired the Belleville Bulls and that they would move to Hamilton's FirstOntario Centre for the 2015\u201316 season as the Hamilton Bulldogs. The former AHL Hamilton Bulldogs had been sold to the Montreal Canadiens and moved to St. John's, Newfoundland, for the 2015\u201316 season as the St. John's IceCaps (the True North Sports and Entertainment-owned IceCaps, which were affiliated with the Winnipeg Jets, moved back to Winnipeg). ==Coaches== *2015\u20132016, George Burnett *2016\u20132018, John Gruden *2018\u20132019, Dave Matsos *2019\u20132020, Vince Laise *2020\u2013present, Steve Staios (interim head coach) ==Notable alumni== *Nick Caamano *Matt Luff *Christian Mieritz *Marian Studenic *Robert Thomas ==Season-by-season results== ===Regular season=== Legend: OTL = Overtime loss, SL = Shootout loss {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
