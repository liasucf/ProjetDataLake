    "text": "Edgardo \"Edgar\" Colina Labella (; born May 22, 1951) is a Filipino politician and lawyer currently serving as the Mayor of Cebu City since June 2019. Prior to becoming mayor, he served two consecutive terms as Vice Mayor of Cebu City from 2013 to 2019 and was a member of the City Council representing Cebu City's North District from 1998 to 2001 and again from 2004 to 2013. ==Early life and education== Labella, a native of Barangay Mabolo, Cebu City, is the son of Eugene Labella (a former Ministry of Public Information regional director in Central Visayas and Visayan movies director) and Esterlina Colina Labella (a former Visayan actress). He completed his elementary education at Mabolo Elementary School in 1963 and secondary education in 1967 at the University of the Visayas, Cebu City where he also earned his bachelor's degree in political science in 1971. He then took up Bachelor of Laws in University of San Carlos from 1973 to 1977. He was admitted to the Philippine Bar on April 21, 1978. ==Early career== Labella started as an associate of Cabahug Law office in 1978 and later became a legal officer of the Complaints and Investigation Office of the Office of the President. He was then promoted to Junior Presidential Staff Officer in the same office while serving as legal consultant of the National Institute of Science of Technology. On March 1980, Labella was designated as legal officer in the Office of the Tanodbayan and was promoted to trial attorney on September 1983. He then became a Special Prosecutor from April 1983 to November 1986. He was appointed as Director of the Office of the Ombudsman-Visayas from 1994 to 1998. ==Political career== ===Councilor, 1998\u20132001 and 2004\u20132013=== Labella started his political career as a councilor for the Cebu City 1st (North) District in the Cebu City Council in 1998. He ran under Bando Osme\u00f1a \u2013 Pundok Kauswagan (BOPK). He then returned to his old post in 2004 and served until 2013 where he also became the Majority Floor Leader in the 12th Sangguniang Panlungsod. ===Vice mayor, 2013\u20132019=== On February 28, 2012, Labella, together with two other Cebu City councilors affiliated with BOPK namely Jose Daluz III and Ronald Cuenco declared their support to then Mayor Michael Rama who left BOPK in 2011. He accepted the offer of Rama to be his candidate for vice mayor in the 2013 elections where he defeated the incumbent vice mayor Joy Augustus Young of BOPK by 184 votes. ====First term (2013\u20132016)==== As presiding officer of the 13th Sangguniang Panlungsod, Labella started with only 4 allied councilors namely Mary Ann de los Santos, David Tumulak, Nendell Hanz Abella and James Anthony Cuenco. Several months after the 2013 barangay elections, Tisa Barangay Captain Phillip Zafra was elected as President of Liga ng mga Barangay-Cebu City Chapter making him an ex-officio member in the Cebu City Council. Labella assumed as acting Mayor of Cebu City on December 11, 2015 after then Mayor Michael Rama was placed under 60-day preventive suspension from the Office of the President in relation to the 2014 demolition of a concrete island and lamppost project in barangay Labangon, Cebu City. Then councilor Nestor Archival meanwhile assumed as acting Vice Mayor of Cebu City. Labella ran for re-election in the 2016 elections and won a wider margin of 29,864 votes against Archival of BOPK. On May 17, 2016, he was suspended, together with Rama and 12 councilors, for \"grave abuse of authority\" in relation to the release of calamity assistance in 2013. ====Second term (2016\u20132019)==== Labella's running mate Rama lost to Tomas Osme\u00f1a in the 2016 elections. On June 30, 2016, he and his 10 allied councilors took their oath of office before Adlaon Barangay Captain Nieves Narra at Rama Compound. With the new administration's refusal to participate in Mega Cebu project by the Metro Cebu Development and Coordinating Board (MCDCB), Osme\u00f1a warned Labella not to represent Cebu City in the said undertaking. He took his oath as a new member of PDP\u2013Laban on August 26, 2016 together with several politicians. ===Mayor, 2019\u2013present=== In July 2018, Labella, who does not come from a political family, officially declared his intention to run as Mayor of Cebu City against incumbent Mayor Tomas Osme\u00f1a while fellow partymate former Mayor Michael Rama also signified his intention to reclaim his old post. It was feared that if both Labella and Rama had run for the same elective position, this would have split their group, BARUG Team Rama. On August 30, 2018, Rama officially announced his decision to run for vice mayor and gave way to Labella who was then the incumbent vice mayor. They were later endorsed by President Rodrigo Duterte as PDP\u2013Laban's official candidates in Cebu City. Labella went on to defeat Osme\u00f1a by 18,925 votes in the 2019 elections. He was elected as the national chairman of the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) on July 19, 2019. After calling Isla dela Victoria, a proposed integrated resorts and casino project of Universal Hotels and Resorts Inc. (UHRI) in Kawit Island, as \"disadvantageous\" to Cebu City when he was still vice mayor, he reversed his position when UHRI decided to increase its investment in the joint venture project with the city from PHP 18 billion to PHP 25 billion. He has indicated that he will not stop the development since the cases filed to stop it were already dismissed. However, he has not allowed UHRI to reclaim the adjacent shore of the site since it would make the reclaimed area a property of UHRI. Similar to what incumbent vice mayor Rama did during his term as Mayor, Labella is occupying the ground floor of the Cebu City Hall annex building as the Mayor's Office saying that \"it will be easier for the Cebuanos to see\" him. Their predecessor, Tomas Osme\u00f1a, previously occupied the 8th floor of the said building. He was appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte as chairman of the Regional Peace and Order Council (RPOC) in Central Visayas last October 28, 2019. ==Issues and criticisms== === Sinulog 2019 fiasco === On August 23, 2019, through an executive order, he created the Sinulog Governing Board which aims to oversee the cultural and religious activities for Sinulog, an annual festival held on the third Sunday of January in Cebu City. This prompted vice mayor Rama, who was serving as Chairman of the Sinulog Foundation, Inc. (SFI), to question the creation of the said body as it would threaten the autonomy of SFI. Rama eventually resigned as its Chairman on October 29, 2019. When the news broke out about the restriction of live video coverage for the Sinulog grand parade and showdown after SFI entered into a -worth agreement granting MyTV exclusive broadcast rights, Labella immediately ordered its cancellation and assured other media groups that there will be no exclusivity to the said event. Labella had to also clarify that other food companies were allowed to sell their products along the Sinulog grand parade route after it was reported that SFI entered into another exclusive agreement worth with San Miguel Food Inc. (SMFI). === Bambi Beltran === Cebuano artist Bambi Beltran filed a lawsuit against Mayor Edgar Labella and cops for human rights violation after her arrest on April 19, 2019 for a Facebook post which Labella called as \"fake news\". === COVID-19 response === On June 2019, Cebu City's inadequate management and response to COVID-19 lead to more than 5,500 cases which resulted to it being called as the epicenter of COVID-19 in the Philippines. Presidential Peace Adviser Carlito Galvez, chief implementor of the National Task Force (NTF) on COVID-19, bared that Cebu City was the new COVID-19 epicenter. After getting the public and private support, Mayor Labella led a major revamp in addressing COVID-19 in the city and finally flattening the curve. Cebu City has closed 49 village isolation centers. As of October 2020, the city registered zero COVID-19 related deaths. ==Personal life== Labella is married to Joycelyn Nicolas Labella. They have two children namely Edgardo and Eugene Philippe. Labella was one of the survivors of the 1998 sinking of the passenger ferry MV Princess of the Orient that sailed from Manila to Cebu during Typhoon Vicki where 150 of the 388 passengers perished. He stayed afloat for 36 hours clad in a life vest until he was found by rescuers. He is also a regular runner at the Cebu City Sports Center as a member of the Walk and Talk Club. ==Awards== * 2010: Prolife Recognition Award by the Human Life International * 2010: The Archdiocese of Cebu's Humanae Vitae Award * 2019 - Outstanding Visayanian (University of the Visayas) ==References== ==External links== * * |- |- Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:People from Cebu City Category:Cebuano people Category:Filipino lawyers Category:PDP\u2013Laban politicians Category:Vice Mayors of Cebu City Category:Mayors of Cebu City Category:University of the Visayas alumni Category:University of San Carlos alumni Category:Cebu City Council members ",
