She previously was Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from Germany. She belongs ancestrally to the royal House of Oldenburg which reigned over the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg until 1918. ==Family background== In accordance with the traditions of the House of Oldenburg, her dynastic style from birth was Her Highness Duchess Beatrix Amelie Ehrengard Eilika of Oldenburg. She is the elder daughter of Duke Huno of Oldenburg and Countess Felicitas-Anita \"Fenita\" Schwerin von Krosigk.Montgomery-Massingberd, Hugh. \"Burke's Royal Families of the World: Volume I Europe & Latin America, 1977, pp. 221-222, 251-252, 327-328. Her father is a younger son of Nikolaus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Oldenburg (1897\u20131970), erstwhile head of the former ruling family of Oldenburg that lost its throne in 1918. She belongs to the same male-line as the royal houses of Denmark and Norway, the deposed royal house of Greece and imperial Russia, and Charles, Prince of Wales, heir to the thrones of the Commonwealth realms, to which last crown she is also distantly in line in accordance with the Act of Settlement 1701. Her maternal grandfather was Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk, who served as finance minister under Adolf Hitler and was the last head of government of the Third Reich. Her cousin, Eilika of Oldenburg, is married to Georg von Habsburg, a son of Otto, the last Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary. ==Personal life== In 2010 she married nobleman Sven von Storch (born 1970). He is the son of businessman Ben-Detlev von Storch and Antje Kr\u00fcger. ==Education and early career== Von Storch was a banker before she studied law in Heidelberg and Lausanne. She worked as a lawyer in Berlin when she began her political career. ==Political career== Since 2014, Beatrix von Storch has been a Member of European Parliament representing Alternative for Germany. Initially a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists group, she left the group in April 2016, forestalling her imminent expulsion, and immediately joined the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) group. Storch is an opponent of same-sex marriage. She has accused school gay youth networks of using \"forced sexualization\" on their students. ==Controversies== ===Legal battle with the Berliner Schaub\u00fchne=== In November 2015, a leading Berlin theatre, the Schaub\u00fchne, was brought into legal conflict with Beatrix von Storch over a play, Falk Richter's FEAR, that parodied AfD leaders as zombies and mass murderers.Joseph Pearson, Fear and the German Far Right: Conversations with Falk Richter in Schaub\u00fchne Pearson's Preview, schaubuehne.de Beatrix von Storch is depicted facing retribution for her grandfather's role as a minister in Hitler's government. AfD Spokesperson Christian L\u00fcth responded by interrupting a performance and filming it. Beatrix von Storch, and the Conservative spokesperson Hedwig von Beverfoerde, then requested and obtained a preliminary injunction against the theatre, prohibiting it from using images of them in the production. They charged that the use of the images violated their human dignity protected under the Constitution. On 15 December 2015, the court ruled against the complainants in favour of the theatre's freedom of expression and lifted the injunctions against using the images. The judges commented that 'any audience member can recognize that this is just a play'. ===Remarks about use of deadly force against refugees=== In late February 2016, von Storch was \"pied\" by members of the German left-wing group Peng Collective at a party meeting in Kassel. The activists, dressed as clowns, protested against her assertion that German border control personnel had the right to shoot at incoming illegal immigrants. A YouTube video of the assault gained wide attention in social media.'Tart War with AfD politician attacked in meeting', huffingtonpost.de videoTart attack (removed) at YouTube ===\"Rapist hordes\" tweet=== Von Storch's Twitter account was blocked for twelve hours after she posted a criticism of the Cologne Police Department for publishing a New Years greeting in Arabic as well as in German, French and English. She had written: \"What the hell is wrong with this country? Why is the official page of the police in NRW tweeting in Arabic? Are they seeking to appease the barbaric, Muslim, rapist hordes of men?\" Cologne was the location of multiple sexual assaults and robbery on New Year's Eve, December 2015. (see New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany) Other prominent members of the AfD quickly sprang to von Storch's defense, including Alice Weidel.The New York Times, 2 January 2018 ===Ancestry=== ==See also== * 2014 European Parliament election in Germany * Counts, dukes and grand dukes of Oldenburg * List of people who have been pied ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from L\u00fcbeck Category:Duchesses of Oldenburg Category:Free Democratic Party (Germany) politicians Category:Alternative for Germany politicians Category:Members of the Bundestag for Berlin Category:Members of the Bundestag 2017\u20132021 Category:Alternative for Germany MEPs Category:MEPs for Germany 2014\u20132019 Category:21st-century women MEPs for Germany Category:Jurists from Schleswig-Holstein Category:Female members of the Bundestag Category:Members of the Bundestag for the Alternative for Germany ",
