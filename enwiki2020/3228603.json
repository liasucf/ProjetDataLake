    "text": "Fellowship Church (FC) is an evangelical Christian megachurch located in Grapevine, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth, that is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. FC's lead pastor has been Ed Young since its opening in 1989. ==History== FC started in 1989 as a mission church of the First Baptist Church of Irving, Texas, and was initially known as \"Fellowship of Las Colinas\". Christine Perez,Booming Fellowship Church to open three new locations, bizjournals.com, USA, August 1, 2004 Approximately 150 members of First Baptist Irving relocated to the new church. FC initially met in a rented facility next to the Irving Arts Center and across from MacArthur High School. Thus, it moved across the parking lot to the nearby Irving Arts Center. During this time, FC tried the concept of \"simultaneous services\"\u2014one group would meet at FC's facility while another would meet at the Arts Center. The FC music team would play at one site while Young preached at the other, then midway through the services the teams would switch places. The concept proved unsuccessful and was shortly dropped. Meanwhile, FC began to look for a suitable site for its permanent facility. FC discovered a site on heavily traveled State Highway 121 north of Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, which was being auctioned by the Resolution Trust Corporation. Though larger than FC wanted, FC did not have the option to bid on only a portion of the site\u2014it had to bid on the entire site or not bid at all. FC agreed to bid on the site, and was the successful bidder; however, it had to borrow $1.675 million to make the payment. Approximately two years later, the announcement was made that Grapevine Mills would be built across the street from FC. Unsolicited offers came in for portions of the FC property, and eventually FC sold a parcel on the north side of the property for the exact amount it had borrowed earlier, thus allowing it to begin construction debt-free. In April 1998, FC finally completed and moved to its current facility and adopted its present name.
