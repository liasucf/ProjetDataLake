    "text": "M\u00e1rio Rui Sousa e Silva (born 27 March 1925), known as M\u00e1rio Rui, is a retired Portuguese footballer who played as a forward. He is most known for his five\u2013year spell at Benfica, where he scored 24 goals in 59 games, winning the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal in 1943\u201344 and the Primeira Liga in 1944\u201345. ==Career== M\u00e1rio Rui arrived at Benfica at age 16 to play for their youth team. After three years there, on 14 May 1944, he made his debut for the first team in a cup match against Acad\u00e9mica. He played again a week later, helping Benfica qualify for the Cup final, which he missed. The following year, he played eight games and scored five goals, being part of an offensive line that included Julinho, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Rog\u00e9rio Pipi and Ars\u00e9nio and was dubbed the Os Cinco Diabos Vermelhos (Five Red Devils). M\u00e1rio Rui's breakthrough happened in 1945\u201346, when he scored 15 goals in 28 matches, being a vital part of the first team that finished second to Belenenses in the league. However, the appearance of Vitor Baptista, Corona and Alfredo Mel\u00e3o in the following seasons, removed him of the first team and he became a fringe player. M\u00e1rio Rui played for Belenenses from 1950 to 1952, amassing 40 games and nine goals, which helped him return to Benfica in 1952, where he was once again, a rarely used player, with two games in two seasons. After Benfica, he played for Oriental de Lisboa until 1956 ==Honours== Benfica *Primeira Liga: 1944\u201345 *Ta\u00e7a de Portugal: 1943\u201344 ==References== General * Specific Category:1925 births Category:Possibly living people Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Primeira Liga players Category:S.L.
