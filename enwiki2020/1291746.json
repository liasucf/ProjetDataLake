    "text": "Anders Erik Limpar (born 24 September 1965) is a Swedish former professional footballer and coach who played as a winger. Limpar featured for clubs IF Brommapojkarna, Young Boys, Cremonese, Arsenal, Everton, Birmingham City, AIK, Colorado Rapids and Djurg\u00e5rdens IF. Limpar was as well capped 58 times by Sweden, scoring 6 goals altogether. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Born in Solna with Hungarian roots, Limpar started playing football in Brommapojkarna, famous for its production of footballing talent. He then played for \u00d6rgryte, joining in the wake of its sensational Swedish championship title in 1985. Limpar quickly became one of the hottest properties in Swedish football, and as so he was offered the chance to journey to Switzerland with Bern club Young Boys. He followed this up in a one-season spell in Italy with Cremonese during the 1989\u201390 season. ===Arsenal=== His club career peaked when he signed for Arsenal in the summer of 1990 from Cremonese for \u00a31m. He went on to win the league title in the 1990\u201391 season, but sat on the sidelines injured for Arsenal's 1993 wins in both the League and the FA Cups. He played a particularly notable part in the 1990\u201391 season, scoring some important goals, and impressing in his first season with exciting wing play and crowd-pleasing displays. These included a hat-trick against Coventry City in a 6\u20131 win on the final day of the league season, by which time Arsenal were already champions. He managed a total of 13 goals that season, with 11 of them coming in the league. He won the GuldbollenSweden's Player of the Year awardin 1991. Limpar scored 20 goals from 116 appearances for Arsenal where he was popular with the fans. He and manager George Graham eventually fell out and with his contract due to come to an end in May 1994, Limpar, who was seeking a new deal at the club, was not offered one by Graham. ===Everton=== On transfer deadline day in March 1994, Limpar transferred to Everton for \u00a31.6 million. Whilst playing for the toffees he won the FA Cup for the first time in 1995. Limpar went on to play a vital role in the Cup final at Wembley, with a run from inside his own half leading to Everton's winning goal being scored by Paul Rideout. He also hit a memorable 50-yard reverse-pass which led to an Everton break-away that BBC commentator Barry Davies described as the 'pass of the match'. He also went on to win the Charity Shield of 1995 with Everton. As so, Limpar eventually fell out of favour at Goodison Park after 1995\u201396, making only two appearances for the club during the 1996\u201397 season. ===Birmingham City=== On 20 January 1997, Limpar was signed by Birmingham City for a fee of \u00a3100,000. He made his league debut on 1 February 1997, in a 1\u20132 away defeat against Bolton Wanderers. The move proved to be unfruitful, as he made only four appearances, before the club later ended his stay in April 1997. ===Later career=== Moving back to Sweden on a free transfer to AIK in the summer of 1997, he won the Swedish championship also known as the Allsvenskan in 1998. After two years in Stockholm, he signed for Major League Soccer side Colorado Rapids in February 1999 where he stayed until November 2000. He then returned to Sweden to sign for Djurg\u00e5rdens IF. However he failed to make an appearance for them and shortly went on to IF Brommapojkarna, where he started his club career. He eventually retired from the game in March 2001 at the age of 35, due to persistent injuries. ==International career== In total, Limpar won 58 caps for Sweden, scoring 6 goals. He was a member of one of the most successful Sweden squads ever, the team that finished third at the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States. However, he did not have a large role during the tournament, making just one substitute appearance, in the 3rd-place match. ==Coaching career== Limpar began coaching the youth team at Djurg\u00e5rdens IF. He was later appointed assistant manager for the Swedish second division team Sollentuna United. In October 2008, aged 43, he played a one-off game for Sollentuna United's reserve side in the position of left back. ==Personal life== After retiring from football in 2001, Limpar opened a bar, The Limp Bar, in central Stockholm, although it has since closed. In 2012 Limpar, together with colleague Mikael Crona, founded Swedish company Super Lock which produces plastic boxes. He currently is the CEO of betting site BestBetToday.com. ==Honours== Limpar in 2017 ===Club=== Arsenal *First Division (1): 1991 *FA Cup (1): 1993 *English League Cup (1): 1993 *UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (1): 1994 Everton *FA Cup (1): 1995 *FA Charity Shield (1): 1995 AIK *Allsvenskan (1): 1998 *Svenska Cupen (1): 1999 Djurg\u00e5rdens IF *Superettan (1): 2000 ===International=== Sweden *King's Cup (1): 1996 *FIFA World Cup (1): 1994 Third place ===Individual=== *Guldbollen (1): 1991 *IF Brommapojkarna Hall of Fame: 2014 ==References== ==External links== * Anders Limpar on Twitter * Category:Living people Category:1965 births Category:People from Solna Municipality Category:Association football midfielders Category:Swedish footballers Category:IF Brommapojkarna players Category:\u00d6rgryte IS players Category:BSC Young Boys players Category:U.S. Cremonese players Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:Everton F.C. players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:AIK Fotboll players Category:Colorado Rapids players Category:Djurg\u00e5rdens IF Fotboll players Category:Allsvenskan players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:Serie A players Category:Serie B players Category:Major League Soccer players Category:Swedish people of Hungarian descent Category:1990 FIFA World Cup players Category:1994 FIFA World Cup players Category:UEFA Euro 1992 players Category:Sweden international footballers Category:Olympic footballers of Sweden Category:Footballers at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Major League Soccer All-Stars Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:Swedish expatriate footballers Category:Swedish expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Swedish expatriate sportspeople in Italy Category:Swedish expatriate sportspeople in Switzerland Category:Swedish expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Djurg\u00e5rdens IF Fotboll non-playing staff ",
