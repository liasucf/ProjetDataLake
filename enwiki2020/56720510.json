Located in southwest Konak, the bridge is a pedestrian overpass that crosses the Mustafa Kemal Coastal Boulevard. Opened in October 1997, the overpass has become a symbol of G\u00f6ztepe and its surrounding neighborhoods. G\u00fczelyal\u0131 Bridge was renamed to its current name in 2010, after the death of Private Kerem O\u011fuz Erbay in a terrorist attack in \u0130skenderun. A large ceremony was held on the bridge for Erbay and Private Serhat Aslan, both \u0130zmir natives, who died in the attack. ==References== Category:Bridges completed in 1997 Category:Cable-stayed bridges in Turkey Category:1997 establishments in Turkey Category:Buildings and structures in \u0130zmir Province Category:Pedestrian bridges in Turkey Category:Konak District ",
