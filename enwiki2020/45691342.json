I do not specialize. The cost depends on the time a given design takes to complete. I have been making bookplates for about eight or ten years.\" \"Walter M. Aikman was a noted artist and bookplate designer, who created a bookplate for Elizabeth Mast Hyatt herself in 1912. This design for Aikman's own bookplate shows a landscape with a pond, swan and human figure surrounded by an elaborate frame. The Latin inscription \"Sub Robore Virtus\" translates as \"Virtue Under Strength.\"\"Walter M. Aikman bookplate, 1914.\" \"His latest and best is his own I have had the privilege to reproducing. The beautiful ornamental framework is engraved with the Burin. This Mr. Aikman cleverly adapted from an old Italian design. The central panel is a reduced copy, in etching, of Mr. Aikman's masterpiece in wood engraving, \"Sunset, La Hulpe,\" engraved by him from his own design in oil while at La Hulpe, Belgium. As the wood engraving is eight by ten inches in size, Mr. Aikman has accomplished the difficult task of copying it so small a reproduction with remarkable skill and fidelity to the original.\"Radin, Herman T. 1914. \"Walter M.
