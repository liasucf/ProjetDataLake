    "text": "Nanna is the eighth studio album recorded by Xavier Rudd and the United Nations, a band featuring a diverse group of musicians from Australia, South Africa, Samoa, Germany, Ireland and Papua New Guinea.http://www.bluesfest.com.au/schedule/detail.aspx?ArtistID=79 The album was recorded and self-produced in Australia and mixed by Errol Brown in Jamaica. ==Reception== In his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek calls Rudd's work on Nanna \"far more collaborative than anything he's done before.\" On the first single, \"Come People\", \"Rudd's vocals are urgent, layered just above backing vocalists Georgia Carowa and Alicia Mellor, whose chants underscore his lines\", but it's the United Nations collective who are the voice of the album. Jurek believes \"Rudd reveals himself as a gifted bandleader and arranger\" allowing the United Nations to shine \"in this ambitious mix.\" Dan Lander of Rolling Stone Australia wrote, \"Nanna is a beautiful celebration of global sound, the only flaw being that Rudd's own unique voice gets a little lost in all that egalitarianism.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Bobby Alu \u2013 Drums, percussion * Georgia Carowa \u2013 Backing vocals * Stuart Currie \u2013 Trombone * Eddie Elias \u2013 Fender Rhodes, Hammond organ, piano * Peter Hunt \u2013 Trumpet * Simon Keet \u2013 Synthesizer * Chris Lane \u2013 Bansuri, tenor sax * Alicia Mellor \u2013 Backing vocals * Tio Moloantoa \u2013 Bass * Yeshe Reiners \u2013 Ngoni, percussion * Xavier Rudd \u2013 Guitar, vocals, Weissenborn, Yidaki ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable\" !
