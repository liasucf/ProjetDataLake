Illeris, Knud: Contemporary Theories of Learning, Routledge, 2009, pp. 90-105 He was widely acknowledged as the founder of the concept of transformative learning. ==Perspective Transformation== Mezirow began his theory of perspective transformation when he studied adult women who chose to re-enter higher education. Mezirow's initial research and further study led him to surmise that adults do not simply make application of old ways of learning to new situations - instead they \"discover a need to acquire new perspectives in order to gain a more complete understanding of changing events\". Mezirow then coined this \"reflective-change-action\" process as Perspective Transformation. Mezirow continued to find consistencies in the adult learners he studied. He then identified 10 stages that adult learners encounter as they experience perspective transformations. ==Works== * 1990. Fostering Critical reflection in adulthood, Jossey-Bass Inc * 1991.
