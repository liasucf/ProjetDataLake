According to OECD figures there are 9,935 people in the Netherlands migrated from Hong Kong, a figure which would exclude people who declared other sources of origin and people born in the Netherlands to Hong Kong parents.\"International Migration Database\". OECD. Retrieved August 23, 2016. , figures from the Netherlands' Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek showed that 9,757 Hong Kong-born persons (4,808 men, 4,949 women), and 8,440 persons with at least one parent born in Hong Kong (4,300 men, 4,140 women). The number of persons of Hong Kong background has shown only mild growth, entirely due to natural increase rather than additional migration; in fact the stock of Hong Kong migrants fell by 5.6% during the same period. According to F. N. Pieke, Hong Kong was a significant source of Chinese migrants to the Netherlands in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with about 600 to 800 per year, falling off to around 300 to 400 per year by the late 1980s. While most Hongkongers are Cantonese by descent, there are Hongkongers who are of Teochew, Hakka, Shanghainese, Hokkien or South Asian descent, and people from overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. Owing to Hong Kong's previous status as a British crown colony, the British nationality of the inhabitants and the existence of people with non-Chinese ancestry, Hongkongers overseas may or may not identify with the Chinese diaspora in the same country. One of the sources of Hongkongers in the Netherlands are Chinese Indonesians who first migrated to Hong Kong and moved onwards to the Netherlands with their children. ==Notable people== *Chow Yiu Fai, lyricist and writer *Popo Fan, owner and chef of Asian Glories *Chloe Nguyen (Nguy\u1ec5n Nhi), actress ==References== * * Category:Asian diaspora in the Netherlands Category:Dutch people of Asian descent Category:Ethnic groups in the Netherlands Netherlands Category:Immigration to the Netherlands ",
