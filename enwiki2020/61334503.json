    "text": "The I. I. Rabi Prize in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics is given by the American Physical Society to recognize outstanding work by mid-career researchers in the field of atomic, molecular, and optical physics. The award was endowed in 1989 in honor of the physicist I. I. Rabi and has been awarded biannually since 1991. The prize citation reads: ==RecipientsThe source of all citations quoted in this section is: == * 2019 Kang-Kuen Ni: \"For seminal work on ultracold molecules, including original contributions to the understanding of chemical reactions in the quantum regime, deterministic creation of individual molecules with optical tweezers, and development of novel, high- precision techniques to interrogate and control the complete set of internal molecular resources.\" * 2017 Martin Zwierlein: \"For seminal studies of ultracold Fermi gases, including precision measurements of the equation of state, the observation of superfluidity, solitons, vortices, and polarons, the realization of a microscope for fermions in a lattice; and the production of chemically stable polar molecules.\" * 2015 Ian Spielman: \"For the development of quantum simulations using ultra-cold atoms, creation of synthetic electromagnetic fields, demonstration of synthetic spinorbit coupling, and applications to studying new physical systems.\" * 2013 Markus Greiner: \"For seminal contributions to the field of ultracold atoms, including the observation of the superfluid-to-Mott-insulator transition, the study of the BEC-BCS cross over for fermions, and the development of imaging techniques for atoms in optical lattices with single-atom resolution\" * 2011 Cheng Chin: \"For pioneering work in strongly interacting Fermi gas and few body physics including the discovery of the Effimov effect.\" * 2009 Mikhail Lukin: \"For pioneering theoretical and experimental work at the interface between quantum optics, quantum information processing, and the quantum many body problem.\" * 2007 Jun Ye: \"For advances in precision measurement, including techniques for stabilizing and measuring optical frequencies, controlling the phase of femtosecond laser pulses, and measuring molecular transitions.\" * 2005 Deborah Jin: * 2003 Mark A.
