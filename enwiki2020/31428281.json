    "text": "Jaroslav Kozl\u00edk (22 May 1907 \u2013 21 October 2012) was a Czech educator and theorist of education, a senior member of the Sokol movement, a pioneer and a former volleyball champion in Czechoslovakia. He was the author of 30 books and over 300 articles, mostly devoted to the theory of education and sports organizations. Kozl\u00edk developed the concept of physical education for elementary schools in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In 2009, he was named an honorary citizen of Prague 4, the largest city district of Prague. Until his death, Kozl\u00edk was active in the Sokol organization, criticizing its current administration for a lack of edificatory impingement on society and youth. ==Career as a volleyball player== Born in Byst\u0159ice pod Host\u00fdnem, Kozl\u00edk was a member of winning teams at Czechoslovak volleyball championships in 1929, 1936, and 1939 and won championships of the Sokol organization as a captain of the Sokol Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e team ten times between 1926 and 1936. ==Career as a pedagogue and researcher== Kozl\u00edk started his career as a teacher at Karol\u00edna Sv\u011btl\u00e1's School for Girls in Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e in 1926. From 1933 to 1945 he taught at the Experimental Elementary School in Zl\u00edn. The aim of the experimental elementary schools (of which there were three in the Czechoslovakia) was to develop and apply progressive teaching methods including project teaching. After World War II, Kozl\u00edk moved to Prague and accepted position in the Research Institute of Education, where he stayed until 1972, when he was forced to retire because of his openly expressed disagreement with the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Kozl\u00edk had an influence on the concept of physical education at elementary schools in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, establishing obligatory swimming and skiing training. He participated in several school reforms between 1945 and 1972 and on the education reform in Czechoslovakia after the Velvet revolution in 1989. ==Personal life== Kozl\u00edk was married Anna Chalupov\u00e1, who also engaged in sports. The couple had three daughters (Iva, Jarmila and Alena) and remained together until Chalupov\u00e1's death in 1998. While working at the Experimental Elementary School in Zl\u00edn, Jaroslav Kozl\u00edk has established a close relationship with Jan Anton\u00edn Ba\u0165a, then the patriarch of the prominent Czechoslovak entrepreneur family. Kozl\u00edk first visited Ba\u0165a in 1933 in the Ba\u0165a company headquarters to discuss Ba\u0165a sponsoring a new gymnasium hall. Ba\u0165a and Kozl\u00edk held different opinions on the concept of the building. Kozl\u00edk, who regarded Ba\u0165a's concept unfit to the use as a school gymnasium, told Ba\u0165a that \"someone understands the spindle industry, someone understands the shoe industry and I have a little understanding of physical education\". Upon this, Ba\u0165a signed Kozl\u00edk's proposal without further debate. Kozl\u00edk's diligence and courage made a deep impression on Ba\u0165a, who later asked Kozl\u00edk to become his personal trainer. He died of natural causes on October 21, 2012 at the age of 105. ==References== Category:1907 births Category:2012 deaths Category:People from Byst\u0159ice pod Host\u00fdnem Category:Czech centenarians Category:Czech educators ",
