    "text": "Preston J. Pardus (born February 15, 1997) is an American professional racing driver. He currently competes part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 36 Chevrolet Camaro for DGM Racing. Also a sports car racer, Pardus won the Spec Miata class at the 2017 and SCCA National Championship Runoffs and claimed the 2020 Super Sweep in the Spec Miata division. ==Racing career== Racing Spec Miatas, Pardus won the 2017 SCCA National Championship Runoffs on a last-lap pass. Pardus was also selected by Mazda Motorsports as a finalist to compete at the Mazda Road to 24 Shootout in late 2017. In 2019, Pardus started the Super Tour off with a win at Sebring International Raceway in January, competing in the Central Florida region of the SCCA. He went on to win the SCCA Majors Southeast Conference Championship that year, topping a series with over 150 entrants. Pardus' Xfinity debut at Road America In August 2019, Pardus made his NASCAR Xfinity Series debut in the 2019 CTECH Manufacturing 180 at Road America. While the start came with his family Pardus Racing Inc. team, Pardus' car was an old Chip Ganassi Racing chassis, was powered by an Earnhardt Childress Engines engine, and the at-track effort was headed by Tony Furr, who served as crew chief. He returned to the series in July 2020 for the Pennzoil 150 on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course, driving for DGM Racing. After starting 19th, Pardus ended the race in tenth for his first top-ten finish in NASCAR. At the SCCA Runoffs that year, Pardus avoided a first-lap melee and went from seventh to the lead on the final lap to claim his second Runoffs victory in the Spec Miata class. In doing so, he also garnered the 2020 Super Sweep award for the Spec Miata division, awarded to any driver who wins the Runoffs, point standings and a major conference championship in the same season. ==Personal life== Pardus' father Dan formerly competed in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, NASCAR Busch Series and ARCA Re/Max Series. He graduated from Spruce Creek High School in 2015. His family owns Danus Utilities, Inc., an underground utility company that Pardus works for when he is not racing. Danus Utilities has also sponsored his race cars. ==Motorsports career results== ===SCCA National Championship Runoffs=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\" |- !
