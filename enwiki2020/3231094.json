The coal mine is situated in the northeastern part of the Cesar-Rancher\u00eda Basin, the basin of the Rancher\u00eda River, between the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in the west and the Serran\u00eda del Perij\u00e1 to the southeast. At Cerrej\u00f3n, low-ash, low-sulphur bituminous coal from the Cerrej\u00f3n Formation is excavated. The mine is one of the largest of its type, the largest in Latin America and the tenth biggest in the world. Cerrej\u00f3n extends over . It is divided into three sections, North Zone, Central Zone and South Zone. Total proven reserves are estimated at 503 megatonnes. In 2016, the mine produced . In June 2020, lawyers for the local Wayuu community lodged a request to the United Nations special rapporteur for work to be immediately halted over environmental and human rights concerns. == History == === The 19th century === There is controversy about the discoverer of Cerrejon mine, and some names are shuffled: the American civil engineer John May, hired by the national government, which conducted the examination in 1864; the writer Jorge Isaacs; and Mr. Juan Gomez Os\u00edo, native of La Guajira. In the 19th century small scale mining began. La pugna por el carb\u00f3n de El Cerrej\u00f3n en el siglo XIX === Cerrej\u00f3n North Zone === A major part of the history of the Cerrej\u00f3n mine should be mentioned: the \"defunct\" company Intercor (International Colombia Resources Corporation) was in its time called \"The Cerrej\u00f3n Zona Norte Coal Project\". In December 1976, a partnership contract was signed between Carbocol S. A. (Carbones de Colombia S. A.), a state-owned firm, and Intercor (International Colombia Resources Corporation Intercor), at the time Exxon, today ExxonMobil subsidiary, to develop the north zone of Cerrej\u00f3n. This contract considered three stages: exploration (1977\u20131980), construction (1981\u20131986), and production (1986\u20132009). In January 1999, the Colombian government extended the concession for a further 25 years, to 2034. * In November 2000, the Colombian government sold its Carbocol S. A. shares (50%) in the partnership contract Cerrej\u00f3n North Zone to a consortium comprising subsidiaries of BHP Billiton, Anglo American, and Glencore. Subsequently, Glencore sold its shares to Xstrata. * In February 2002, this consortium acquired the remaining 50% of shares from Intercor (ExxonMobil), thereby becoming sole concessioners of the Cerrej\u00f3n North Zone. * In November 2002, the union of the purchased to Intercor and Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n S. A. was formalized, and the official name of the mine operator was changed to Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n Limited, Cerrej\u00f3n. === Cerrej\u00f3n Central Zone === In this zone, there are two areas under concession: * The Central Deposit (El Cerrej\u00f3n community) has been in production since 1981 via contracts with different companies (a Domi Prodeco Auxini consortium, Carbones del Caribe, and others). In 1995, Glencore acquired Prodeco S. A., creating Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n S. A. and then in 1997, Anglo American became involved in the business. In 2000, BHP Billiton became the third partner. * The Oreganal Deposit (state-owned) was initially under concession to Carbones del Caribe by the national government. Then, in 1995, the concession passed to Oreganal S. A. which, in turn, ceded its shares to Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n S. A. in 1999. ==== Patilla Area ==== In 2001, after a public tender, this area was ceded to a consortium comprising Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n S. A. and Cerrej\u00f3n Zona Norte S.A., which is currently concessioned to subsidiaries of BHP Billiton, Anglo American, and Xstrata. === Cerrej\u00f3n South Zone === In 1997, after a tender process, the exploration and mining contract for this zone was awarded to the consortium now comprising subsidiaries of BHP Billiton, Anglo American, and Xstrata. Currently, the Cerrej\u00f3n South Zone is under exploration. == Description == Cerrej\u00f3n is the tenth largest coal mine in the world and the biggest in Latin America.The 10 biggest coal mines in the world Production started in 1985, when the mine was operated by Carbocol, a Colombian state company and Intercor, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil. The proven reserves in 2009 were and the probable reserves . The coal is low-ash, low-sulphur bituminous coal, mined from the Paleocene Cerrej\u00f3n Formation in the northeastern part (Cerrej\u00f3n Sub-basin) of the Cesar- Rancher\u00eda Basin.Cerrej\u00f3n The coal seams reach a thickness of .

Producci\u00f3n de carb\u00f3n en Colombia - UPME == Operation, installations and operator == Mining operations at one of Cerrej\u00f3n pits Cerrej\u00f3n is owned in equal parts by subsidiaries of the international mining companies BHP, Anglo American and Glencore. The mine produces over 32 million tonnes of thermal coal a year and has estimated reserves of over five billion tonnes Unique in Colombia, the mine has an integrated railway line and shipping terminal, which gives increased efficiency and lower environmental impact. As well exporting coal, the port and railway are used to transport supplies to the mine. The mine has maintenance workshops of over . === Railway === The integrated railway line is long. Each train can haul 109 freight wagons, each of which can carry of 96 to 110 tonnes of coal. === Port === The Puerto Bol\u00edvar shipping terminal loads bulk carrier ships of up to . The port also has a supply dock for ships of up to 70,000 tonnes which is used to supply machinery, spare parts, fuel, and other goods for the mining operation. The navigable channel is deep, wide, and . It is one of the largest coal maritime ports in South America with clean technology. == Integrated operation == === Figures === * From 1985 to 2011, the coal mine of the Cerrej\u00f3n, produced 508.8 million tonnes of coal and generated US$2,006 million in royalties. In 2011 alone, sales generated US$336.60 million for the country as a whole and the region of La Guajira. * By the end of 2011, the mine of the Cerrej\u00f3n, had reached a historical production figure of 32.03 million tonnes to the following markets: Europe (58%), the Mediterranean and Asia (21%), Central and South America (12%), and North America (9%). * These external sales represent 40% of Colombia's coal sales and 4.6% of global coal sales. * Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n's directly employed workforce numbers 5,373 workers (62% from La Guajira, 28% from other parts of the Caribbean coast, and 10% from the rest of the country). * In addition, a further 4,497 workers are employed indirectly through contractor firms for the operation. === Mining fleet === Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n has a mining fleet comprising 493 pieces of equipment: 258 trucks with a load capacity of 190, 240, and 320 tonnes, 50 hydraulic shovels, and 185 pieces of auxiliary equipment. * A truck can haul a load equivalent to approximately 10 tractor trailers. In Colombia, a tractor trailer hauls 30 to 35 tonnes. * A P&H; 2800XPC shovel has a load capacity equivalent to the weight of 40 automobiles, that is, approximately 63.5 tonnes. * A PC8000 shovel can manage a load equivalent to 50 automobiles (approximately ). === Infrastructure === Coal train Bol\u00edvar Port ;Railway * The mine of the Cerrej\u00f3n uses the only freight railway in the country * The tracks are in length, connecting the mine with Puerto Bol\u00edvar ;Puerto Bol\u00edvar * Largest coal-export port in Latin America * Covered conveyor belts and a direct-loading system since 1985 * Receives vessels of up to ;Airports * of runway; Mine: Puerto Bol\u00edvar: * Restricted flight area ;Mine-Puerto Bol\u00edvar Motorway * A motorway long for operational support and access for the population of La Guajira since 1982. It links the southern part of the department with the northern part. ;Mushaisa Residential Unit * Complete infrastructure for housing, commercial shops, and services for 2,200 residents * 297 houses, 430 apartments, and a hotel for over 200 people * Albania School: a bilingual school with a very high ICFES ranking. It is currently ranked 23 out of 12,273 educational institutions in the country == Extraction process == Overburden removal The extraction process begins with the identification and relocation of wildlife in the area slated for intervention. Then the land is cleared and the topsoil is removed and stored in soil banks for the future reclamation of areas intervened by the mining operation. Subsequently, the area is drilled and explosives inserted for blasting so the hydraulic shovels can remove the overburden. This waste rock is loaded on 240-tonne and 320-tonne trucks and deposited in waste rock dump sites. * Once the coal seams are exposed, the tractors pile up the coal and it is loaded onto 190-tonne trucks. * The coal is taken to one of two crushing plants and piled in accordance with its quality and caloric value. * The plant crushes the coal, and transports it via conveyor belt to the silos for loading in rail cars. * The train travels 150 kilometres to Puerto Bol\u00edvar. * At the unloading station, the train unloads the coal and conveyor belts transport it to the three stacker-reclaimers, which unload it to storage piles. It is later reclaimed and sent to the linear ship-loader, which places it in the holds of coal ships. == See also == * Puerto Bolivar Airport * Cerrej\u00f3n Formation * Titanoboa, world's largest prehistoric snake, found in Cerrej\u00f3n, among many other fossils == References == == Further reading == * The Cerrej\u00f3n Foundations System * Cerrej\u00f3n coal \u2013 The Coal Institute * Overview of operations Cerrej\u00f3n * Proyecto de El Cerrej\u00f3n \u2013 Universidad del Norte == External links == * Carbones del Cerrej\u00f3n Limited, Cerrej\u00f3n Category:Coal mines in Colombia Category:Surface mines in Colombia Category:Cesar\u2013Rancher\u00eda Basin Category:La Guajira Department Category:Xstrata Category:Standard gauge railways in Colombia ",
