    "text": "Cameron \"Cammy\" Mackay (born 9 December 1996) is a Scottish professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Inverness Caledonian Thistle. ==Career== He made his debut for Inverness Caledonian Thistle in May 2015, coming on as a late substitute for Ryan Esson, in a game against Celtic at Parkhead. The following week, he was an unused substitute for Inverness as they won the Scottish Cup Final at Hampden Park. Mackay was loaned out to Scottish League Two side Elgin City at the start of the 2016\u201317 season, however, his move was cut short and he returned to Thistle temporarily in September 2016 to provide goalkeeping cover after second-choice keeper Ryan Esson suffered an elbow injury. On 29 October 2016, Mackay made his first league start for Inverness against Hearts after Owain F\u00f4n Williams was injured in the pre-match warm-up. Mackay subsequently returned to Elgin City on loan in December 2016. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Scottish footballers Category:Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C. players Category:Elgin City F.C. players Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:Clachnacuddin F.C. players Category:Brora Rangers F.C. players Category:Rothes F.C. players ",
