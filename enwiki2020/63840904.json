    "text": "Mount Nagishlamina is an 11,068-foot (3,374 meter) glaciated mountain summit located in the Tordrillo Mountains of the Alaska Range, in the US state of Alaska. The mountain is situated west of Anchorage, northwest of Mount Spurr, and southeast of Mount Torbert, which is the nearest higher neighbor. It is the fifth-highest peak in the Tordrillo Mountains, a subset of the Alaska Range. The mountain takes its Dena\u02bcina language name from the Nagishlamina River which drains the west side of the peak.Donald J. Orth, Dictionary of Alaska Place Names, 1967, page 669.James Kari and James A. Fall, Shem Pete's Alaska, 2nd Ed. 2003. page 54. Mount Nagishlamina's name was in use by local mountaineers since the 1970s, and was officially adopted in 1999 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. This geographic feature was likely the highest unclimbed peak in the United States at the time of its first ascent in 1989 by Dave Johnston.Steve Gruhn, December 2016 Scree. Mountaineering Club of Alaska. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Mount Nagishlamina is located in a subarctic climate zone, with long, cold, snowy winters, and cool summers.
