He next worked for a produce company and eventually formed a partnership with Peter Saybolt to operate their own produce business. By 1860, Elkins had bought out his partner and had built their produce operation into the largest store of its kind in the United States. Always looking for business opportunities, William Elkins soon recognized the potential for the usages of oil being pumped from the developing oilfields of Northwestern Pennsylvania and became a pioneer in the refining of crude oil. In Philadelphia he founded Monument Oil Works that built a primitive oil refinery which he constantly modernized and soon expanded into other locations. His company was the first to make gasoline and was involved in the production of asphalt. In 1875, the increasingly wealthy Elkins entered into a partnership with Standard Oil, becoming a significant shareholder in that oil giant. In 1873, William Elkins first met Peter Widener and the two became trusted friends who would partner in street car and railway businesses that would expand to major cities across the United States and make them both enormously wealthy.New York Times - May 6, 1899 article titled \"Chicago Roads Change Hands\" A member of the Board of Directors of numerous enterprises in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, among his investments William Elkins held sizeable share positions in American Tobacco Company and International Mercantile Marine Co. ==Personal life== In 1858, William Elkins married Maria Louise Broomall with whom he had two daughters and two sons:Wiegle, A.
