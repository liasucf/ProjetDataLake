    "text": "TERA connector allows splitting the link through different patch cords with one, two, and four pairs. TERA is a shielded twisted pair connector for use with Category 7 twisted-pair data cables, developed by The Siemon Company and standardised in 2003 by the International Electrotechnical Commission with the reference IEC 61076-3-104. The 2006 revision of the standard extended the characterised performance up to 1000 MHz. The connector has a different footprint from the more common 8P8C connector. TERA-Connector TERA is also a useful interface for broadcast communications technology (BCT). This connector allows for cable sharing, permitting users to integrate video, voice and data services over a single cabling link. ==See also== * GG45 * ARJ45 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Networking hardware Category:IEC 61076-3 ",
