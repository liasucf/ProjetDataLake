    "text": "In mathematics, the Hardy\u2013Littlewood zeta-function conjectures, named after Godfrey Harold Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood, are two conjectures concerning the distances between zeros and the density of zeros of the Riemann zeta function. == Conjectures == In 1914 Godfrey Harold Hardy proved that the Riemann zeta function \\zeta\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{2}+it\\bigr) has infinitely many real zeros. Let N(T) be the total number of real zeros, N_0(T) be the total number of zeros of odd order of the function \\zeta\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{2}+it\\bigr), lying on the interval (0,T]. Hardy and Littlewood claimed two conjectures. These conjectures \u2013 on the distance between real zeros of \\zeta\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{2}+it\\bigr) and on the density of zeros of \\zeta\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{2}+it\\bigr) on intervals (T,T+H] for sufficiently great T > 0, H = T^{a + \\varepsilon} and with as less as possible value of a > 0, where \\varepsilon > 0 is an arbitrarily small number \u2013 open two new directions in the investigation of the Riemann zeta function. 1\\. For any \\varepsilon > 0 there exists such T_0 = T_0(\\varepsilon) > 0 that for T \\geq T_0 and H=T^{0.25+\\varepsilon} the interval (T,T+H] contains a zero of odd order of the function \\zeta\\bigl(\\tfrac{1}{2}+it\\bigr). 2\\. For any \\varepsilon > 0 there exist T_0 = T_0(\\varepsilon) > 0 and c = c(\\varepsilon) > 0, such that for T \\geq T_0 and H=T^{0.5+\\varepsilon} the inequality N_0(T+H)-N_0(T) \\geq cH is true. == Status == In 1942 Atle Selberg studied the problem 2 and proved that for any \\varepsilon > 0 there exists such T_0 = T_0(\\varepsilon) > 0 and c = c(\\varepsilon) > 0, such that for T \\geq T_0 and H=T^{0.5+\\varepsilon} the inequality N(T+H)-N(T) \\geq cH\\log T is true. In his turn, Selberg made his conjecture that it's possible to decrease the value of the exponent a = 0.5 for H=T^{0.5+\\varepsilon} which was proved 42 years later by A.A.
