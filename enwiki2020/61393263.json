She is able to map out the fuzzy frontiers that exist in a child's mind between reality and fantasy and in doing so also to convey the perils of childhood and adolescence -both the real and the imagined.\" == References == Category:1988 American novels Category:Realist novels Category:English-language novels Category:Farrar, Straus and Giroux books Category:1988 debut novels ",
