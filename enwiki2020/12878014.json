    "text": "Emmett Jerome \"Heinie\" Mueller (July 20, 1912 \u2013 October 3, 1986) was a Major League Baseball player for the Philadelphia Phillies from 1938 to 1941. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Mueller originally signed as an infielder with the St. Louis Cardinals\u2019 organization. Before reaching the major leagues, Mueller played with Springfield in the Western Association and in 1935 and 1936 with Houston. In December 1937, the Cardinals sold Mueller to the Philadelphia Phillies. Mueller became the Phillies starting second baseman in 1938. In his major league debut on Opening Day, April 19, he became the first player in history to hit a leadoff home run in his first major league at-bat. No other Phillie would hit a leadoff homer on Opening Day until C\u00e9sar Hern\u00e1ndez in 2017. In four seasons with the Phillies, Mueller was primarily a second baseman (225 of his 441 games), but he also appeared as a pinch hitter, third baseman, outfielder, first baseman, and shortstop. In 441 major league games, Mueller collected 324 hits, scored 144 runs, knocked in 127 runs, walked 156 times, and stole 10 bases. He compiled a career batting average of .253 and a .337 on-base percentage. Mueller joined the U.S. Army shortly after Pearl Harbor. He was stationed at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, where he played baseball for the Reception Center Missions. A highlight at the time was playing for military all-star team which defeated an American League all-star team, 5\u20130, on July 7, 1942, at Cleveland\u2019s Municipal Stadium before a crowd of 62,059. After the war, Mueller attended the Phillies spring training in 1946. Having missed four seasons to military service, Mueller did not make the cut and was released by the Phillies on April 22, 1946. He continued to play in the minor leagues and later became a minor league player-manager, including a stint with the Muskogee Reds in the Western Association in 1949. Mueller died in Orlando, Florida at age 74 in 1986. He is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Winter Garden, Florida. ==See also== *List of Major League Baseball players with a home run in their first major league at bat ==References== ==External links== * Biography and Photographs Category:1912 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Baseball players from Missouri Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Danville Veterans players Category:Scottdale Cardinals players Category:Scottdale Scotties players Category:St. Joseph Saints players Category:Greensboro Patriots players Category:Springfield Cardinals players Category:Springfield Red Wings players Category:Houston Buffaloes players Category:Lynchburg Cardinals players Category:Shreveport Sports players Category:Muskogee Reds players ",
