    "text": "Lake Tota (), the largest lake in Colombia, located in the east of Boyac\u00e1 department, inside the Sugamuxi Province, it is the source of the Upia River which flows into the Orinoco River basin. The major town on the lake is Aquitania, located on its eastern side. Other nearby villages include Tota, Iza and Cu\u00edtiva. Lake Tota was an important religious center for the Muisca culture. The name Tota comes from the Chibcha language of the Muisca and according to linguist Mariana Escribano its main name refers to \"Astronomic Observatory\", relating to its sacred uses for that culture. There are legends which relate to the way the lake was formed by the hands of ancient ancestors. The area around Lake Tota is one of the major onion producing regions of Colombia. The western shore of the lake is a popular tourist destination for Colombians. The average water temperature of 13 \u00b0C allowed for the introduction of rainbow trout (Onchorynchus mykiss) which created a valuable wild fishery (a mounted specimen in Restaurante Lucho, Aquitania, reportedly early in the 1990s, weighed 7 kg) and cage culture aquaculture, but predation on native fish species as led to the now accepted extinction of the pez graso or grease fish (Rhizosomichthys totae) believed native to only this lake. Lake Tota is a breeding ground for several threatened or endangered bird species, including the least bittern (Ixobrychus exilis bogotensis), the Colombian ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis andina), the Bogot\u00e1 rail (Rallus semiplumbeus) and Apolinar's wren (Cistothorus apolinari). The last confirmed sighting of the Colombian grebe (Podiceps andinus), now considered to be extinct, was at Lake Tota.Lake Tota - Bird Life International - accessed 02-05-2016 == Etymology == In the Chibcha language of the Muisca people, Tota means \"Farmfields of the river\".
