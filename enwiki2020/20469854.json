Its main base is Fairbanks International Airport with its major hub at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. The company slogan is Legendary Aircraft. Extraordinary Service. == History == A family- owned business run by Robert W. Everts who created Tatonduk Flying Service in 1977 with a single Cessna 180 aircraft to provide air transportation for miners in the remote places of Alaska. Since 1980, his father, Clifford R. Everts, has owned and operated Everts Air Fuel Inc., which specializes in airlifting flammable and hazardous materials. In 1993 the airline, originally Federal Aviation Regulations Part 135 certified (Commuter and On-Demand Operations), became FAR Part 121 certified (Domestic, Flag, and Supplemental Operations) as Tatonduk Outfitters Limited purchased Everts Air. With the introduction of larger aircraft like the Douglas DC-6B and Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando the company split between Everts Air Alaska and Everts Air Cargo. ==Operating the Douglas DC-6== Everts Air Cargo DC-6 lifting off at Anchorage Since Northern Air Cargo abandoned their regular service with the Douglas DC-6, Everts Air Cargo is the last airline in the United States to operate scheduled flights with a rather large fleet of 60-year-old piston-powered aircraft. In a 2007 video interview, the Anchorage Station Manager stated that the DC-6 was still considered to be a valuable aircraft for operations in the harsh conditions of Alaska, with excellent landing and takeoff performance on gravel runways. The downside is the difficulty to find Avgas and the maintenance labor cost. Everts Air Cargo estimates a ratio of 12 hours of maintenance for every single flying hour. Spare parts could also be a problem but Everts Air Cargo anticipates they will have enough in stock to keep the last DC-6 flying beyond 2020. == Zero Gravity Corporation Boeing 727 == Since 2015 Everts Air has operated a Boeing 727-227F for the Zero Gravity Corporation (also known as ZERO-G), which previously operated with Amerijet International.https://spacenews.com/nasa-considering-new-commercial-parabolic- aircraft-flight-deals/ The aircraft is based in the Contiguous United States and operates weightless flights. Unlike NASA, ZERO-G is governed under Part 121 of FAA regulations, enabling the company to cater to both tourists and researchers alike. ==Destinations== Everts Air operates scheduled freight and passengers services to the following domestic destinations: * Allakaket (AET) - Allakaket Airport * Anaktuvuk Pass (AKP) - Anaktuvuk Pass Airport * Anchorage (ANC) - Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (hub) * Aniak (ANI) - Aniak Airport * Arctic Village (ARC) - Arctic Village Airport * Barrow (BRW) - Wiley Post\u2013Will Rogers Memorial Airport * Beaver (WBQ) - Beaver Airport * Bethel (BET) -Bethel Airport * Bettles (BTT) - Bettles Airport * Dillingham (DLG) - Dillingham Airport * Eagle (EAA) - Eagle Airport * Emmonak (EMK) - Emmonak Airport * Fairbanks (FAI) - Fairbanks International Airport (hub) * Fort Yukon (FYU) - Fort Yukon Airport * Galena (GAL) - Edward G.
