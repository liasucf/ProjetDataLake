    "text": "My Songs is a remixed and re-recorded album by British singer-songwriter Sting. This is his second studio album featuring new renditions of previously released material (after 2010's Symphonicities) and his fourteenth studio album overall. The album was released on 24 May 2019. ==Background== The album features fifteen reworked versions of a selection of Sting's most widely recognised songs from across his career both as a member of The Police and as a solo artist. Via his social media outlets, Sting described the new versions of the songs as being reconstructed, refitted and reframed, and all of them with a contemporary focus. Some songs on the album have been remixed using elements of the original tracks, whilst others are complete re-recordings. A remixed version of \"Brand New Day\" produced for My Songs was released on 31 December 2018. This version was first performed live in Times Square on the same day. A remixed version of \"Desert Rose\" and a newly recorded version of \"Demolition Man\" were made available to download on 28 March 2019. The My Songs tour commenced on 28 May 2019 in Paris. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019\u201320) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Digital Albums (ARIA) | 9 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| French Albums (SNEP) | 2 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italian Albums (FIMI) | 14 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) | 17 |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgian Albums (Ultratop Wallonia) | 86 |- ! scope=\"row\"| French Albums (SNEP) |37 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Polish Albums (ZPAV) | 96 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Swiss Albums (Schweizer Hitparade) | 92 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" !
