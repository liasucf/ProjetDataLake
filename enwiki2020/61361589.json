    "text": "\"In These Shoes?\" is a song by British singer and songwriter Kirsty MacColl, released in 2000 as the second and final single from her fifth studio album Tropical Brainstorm. It was written by MacColl and Pete Glenister, and produced by MacColl, Glenister and Dave Ruffy. ==Background== The song samples \"Spanish Grease\", a track written by Willie Bobo and Melvin Lastie, and first recorded by Bobo in 1965. During an appearance on Later... with Jools Holland, MacColl said of the song: \"It's about being a fashion victim; being a slave to fashion and crippling yourself in the process.\" \"In These Shoes?\" has been featured on various media and soundtracks, including in a TV advert for Adidas in 2000. It was used in a trailer for the British sitcom Kiss Me Kate and featured in the HBO series Sex and the City. In 2002, it was the theme to the comedy-drama series Any Time Now,https://img.kirstymaccoll.com/strange- facts/Strange-Facts-Emporium.pdf and was used as the theme tune for the first series of The Catherine Tate Show in 2004. The song also featured in the 2005 film Kinky Boots (including on its soundtrack album). ==Music video== A music video was filmed to promote the single. It was directed by Ben Unwin and produced by Sally Collins. In the book My Kirsty - End of the Fairytale, MacColl's former manager Frank Murray recalled of the video: \"We both watched it together and she thought it was so funny - she loved the fact that she barely appears in it.\" ==Reception== Upon release, David Bauder of the Associated Press considered \"In These Shoes?\" to be a \"hilarious song about a woman whose obsession with fashion trumps all other interests\". Landon Hall of the Associated Press considered the song the album's \"pinnacle\" and described it as a \"party record with a catchy Spanish chorus and sultry guitar\". Andy Kellman of AllMusic felt the song was \"top-shelf material\". Billboard commented: \"Tropical Brainstorm contains some of the artist's most vibrant work in years, including the sexy, scandalous \"In These Shoes?\".\" ==Track listing== ;12\" single #\"In These Shoes?\" (UR Crazy Remix) - 3:40 #\"In These Shoes?\" (UR Crazy Remix Edit) - 3:40 #\"In These Shoes?\" (Extended Moba Club) - 3:40 #\"In These Shoes?\" (Moba Cut) - 3:40 #\"In These Shoes?\" (Album Version) - 3:40 ;12\" single (UK promo) #\"In These Shoes?\" (Le Rosbifs Mix) - 3:40 #\"In These Shoes?\" (P Mix) - 3:40 ;CD single #\"In These Shoes?\" - 3:40 #\"My Affair\" - 3:52 #\"Good for Me\" - 8:08 ;CD single #2 #\"In These Shoes?\" - 3:40 #\"In These Shoes?\" (Le Rosbifs Mix) - 3:40 #\"In These Shoes?\" (P Mix) - 3:40 ;CD single (European release) #\"In These Shoes?\" - 3:40 #\"In These Shoes?\" (UR Crazy Remix) - 3:40 #\"In These Shoes?\" (UR Crazy Remix Edit) - 3:40 #\"In These Shoes?\" (P Mix) - 3:40 #\"My Affair\" (Live) - 3:52 ==Personnel== * Kirsty MacColl - vocals, autoharp * Pete Glenister - guitar * Ben Storey - trumpet * Dave Ruffy - drums * Bosco De Oliveira - percussion * Ernesto Estruch, Felix Gonzalez, Gabriel Fonseca, Omar Puente - backing vocals Production * Kirsty MacColl, Pete Glenister, Dave Ruffy - producers * Lee Groves - additional programming * UR Production, Maurizio Pini, Max Baffa, Le Rosbifs, Steve P. - remixes Other * Stylorouge - design, photography ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (2000) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Italy (FIMI) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|46 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|81 |} ==Cover versions== * In 2000, American singer Bette Midler recorded her own version of the song for her album Bette.
