Although he had never seen a case, Dunglison included a description of the disease in his 1842 textbook The Practice of Medicine. Waters's account of the disease was one of the first to note that the disease is hereditary, \"within the third generation at farthest.\" Another of Dunglison's students at Jefferson, Charles R. Gorman, wrote his thesis on the magrums as well. ==Works== ===Published works=== *1824 Commentaries on Diseases of the Stomach and Bowels of Children *1832 Human Physiology *1833 A New Dictionary of Medical Science and Literature.
