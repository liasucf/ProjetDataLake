    "text": "The Early Years 1965\u20131972 is a compilation box set by compiling the early work of the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 11 November 2016 by Pink Floyd Records with distribution held by Warner Music for the UK and Europe and Sony Music for the rest of the world. It comprises seven volumes over 33 discs, including CDs, DVDs, and Blu-Ray discs, vinyl records, plus memorabilia including photos, posters and tour programmes. It contains early non-album singles plus unreleased studio and live recordings. Although Volumes 1\u20136 have been available individually since 24 March 2017, Volume 7 \u2013 1967\u20131972: Continu/ation, remains exclusive to the set. A two-CD compilation, The Early Years \u2013 Cre/ation, was also released. Due to an error, a CD edition of Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii was also included in the box set in place of the 2016 mix of Obscured by Clouds which was placed inside the set in a cardboard wallet at the last moment. The standalone edition of 1972: Obfusc/ation contains both CDs as standard. In 2019, a number of Blu-ray discs in the set began to fail due to manufacturing defects. Warner Music and Pink Floyd announced a recall programme on 1 October 2019, which ran until 1 January 2020. ==Contents== ===Volume 1: 1965\u20131967: Cambridge St/ation=== Track listing: Disc one (CD) \u2013 studio recordings from 1965\u20131967 1965 recordings: #\"Lucy Leave\" \u2013 2:57 #\"Double O Bo\" \u2013 2:57 #\"Remember Me\" \u2013 2:46 #\"Walk with Me Sydney\" \u2013 3:11 #\"Butterfly\" \u2013 3:00 #\"I'm a King Bee\" \u2013 3:13 1966\u20131967 recordings: # * \"Arnold Layne\" (2010 mix) \u2013 2:57 #\"See Emily Play\" (2010 mix) \u2013 2:55 #\"Apples and Oranges\" (2010 mix) \u2013 3:05 #\"Candy and a Currant Bun\" (2010 mix) \u2013 2:45 #\"Paintbox\" (2010 mix) \u2013 3:48 #\"Matilda Mother\" (alternate version) (2010 mix) \u2013 4:01 #\"Jugband Blues\" (2010 mix) \u2013 3:01 #\"In the Beechwoods\" (2010 mix) \u2013 4:43 #\"Vegetable Man\" (2010 mix) \u2013 2:32 #\"Scream Thy Last Scream\" (2010 mix) \u2013 4:43 Tracks 1\u20136 were recorded as The Tea Set around Christmas 1964.

This volume is notable for containing three feature length films: The Committee, More and La Vall\u00e9e and, despite its subtitle, a live recording of \"Echoes\" from 1974.

The Pompeii performance has never been officially released on CD before. The Live at Pompeii CD was accidentally included in the 1972: Obfusc/ation set instead of the 2016 mix of the Obscured by Clouds album. Therefore the 2016 Obscured by Clouds CD was included separately in a white slipcase; on the front of which is written \"Obscured by Clouds 2016 remix\" and on the reverse: \"Replacement CD disc for Obfusc/ation [...] (Stereo 2016 mix of Pink Floyd 'Live at Pompeii' CD supplied in error)\". Warner Music has to date refused to provide replacement discs where copies of Obscured by Clouds were not included in customers' box sets (all Sony Music issues had the replacement CDs). When the 1972: Obfusc/ation was released as a standalone set in March 2017, the Live at Pompeii CD was included as Disc 2 of the set. The Live at Pompeii CD track listing is as follows: #\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" \u2013 6:45 #\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\" \u2013 10:35 #\"One of These Days\" \u2013 5:50 #\"A Saucerful of Secrets\" \u2013 12:49 #\"Echoes\" \u2013 24:56 #\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" (Alternative Version) \u2013 6:06 ===Replica vinyl singles=== Arnold Layne #\"Arnold Layne\" #\"Candy and a Currant Bun\" Point Me at the Sky #\"Point Me at the Sky\" #\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\" It Would Be So Nice #\"It Would Be So Nice #\"Julia Dream\" See Emily Play #\"See Emily Play\" #\"The Scarecrow\" Apples and Oranges #\"Apples and Oranges\" #\"Paintbox\" ==The Early Years 1967\u20131972: Cre/ation== The Early Years 1967\u20131972: Cre/ation is a 2-disc highlights compilation of the box set The Early Years 1965\u20131972 which was released on 11 November 2016. ===Track listing=== Disc one #\"Arnold Layne\" (2010 mix) \u2013 2:57 #\"See Emily Play\" (2010 mix) \u2013 2:55 #\"Matilda Mother\" (alternate version, 2010 mix) \u2013 3:58 #\"Jugband Blues\" (2010 mix) \u2013 3:02 #\"Paintbox\" (2010 mix) \u2013 3:47 #\"Flaming\" (BBC Radio session, 25 September 1967) \u2013 2:42 #\"In the Beechwoods\" (2010 mix) \u2013 4:43 #\"Point Me at the Sky\" \u2013 3:41 #\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" (single version) \u2013 5:48 #\"Embryo\" (from Harvest Records sampler Picnic) \u2013 4:42 #US Radio advertisement for Ummagumma \u2013 0:22 #\"Grantchester Meadows\" (BBC Radio session, 12 May 1969) \u2013 3:46 #\"Cymbaline\" (BBC Radio session, 12 May 1969) \u2013 3:39 #\"Interstellar Overdrive\" (Live at the Paradiso, Amsterdam, 9 August 1969) \u2013 4:24 #\"Green Is the Colour\" (BBC Radio session, 12 May 1969) \u2013 3:21 #\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" (BBC Radio session, 12 May 1969) \u2013 3:28 Disc two #\"On the Highway\" (Zabriskie Point sessions) \u2013 1:17 #\"Auto Scene Version 2\" (Zabriskie Point sessions) \u2013 1:13 #\"The Riot Scene\" (Zabriskie Point sessions) \u2013 1:40 #\"Looking at Map\" (Zabriskie Point sessions) \u2013 1:56 #\"Take Off\" (Zabriskie Point sessions) \u2013 1:19 #\"Embryo\" (BBC Radio session, 16 July 1970) \u2013 10:13 #\"Atom Heart Mother\" (Live at the Casino de Montreux, 21 November 1970) \u2013 18:01 #\"Nothing, Part 14\" (\"Echoes\" work in progress) \u2013 7:01 #\"Childhood's End\" (2016 mix) \u2013 4:33 #\"Free Four\" (2016 mix) \u2013 4:16 #\"Stay\" (2016 mix) \u2013 4:08 *Disc 1, tracks 1\u20135 & 7 are taken from 1965\u20131967: Cambridge St/ation. *Disc 1, tracks 6 and 11 are taken from 1967\u20131972: Continu/ation. *Disc 1, tracks 8\u20139 are taken from 1968: Germin/ation. *Disc 1, tracks 10 & 12\u201316 are taken from 1969: Dramatis/ation. *Disc 2, tracks 1\u20137 are taken from 1970: Devi/ation. *Disc 2, track 8 is taken from 1971: Reverber/ation. *Disc 2, tracks 9-11 are taken from 1972: Obfusc/ation. ===Personnel=== * Syd Barrett \u2013 vocals, guitars (only disc 1, tracks 1\u20137) * David Gilmour \u2013 vocals, guitars (except disc 1, tracks 1\u20137, 11) * Nick Mason \u2013 drums, percussion (except disc 1, track 11) * Roger Waters \u2013 vocals, bass (except disc 1, tracks 11\u201312), acoustic guitar (only disc 1, track 12) * Richard Wright \u2013 vocals, keyboards (except disc 1, track 11) ===Charts=== The Early Years 1967\u20131972: Cre/ation {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseekers Albums (RMNZ) | 3 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (PROMUSICAE) | 58 |- |- |- |} ==Credits== * Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis \u2013 creative director. * Lana Topham \u2013 curator, producer and archivist for The Early Years films. * Pentagram \u2013 package design. * John Whiteley \u2013 1960s psychedelic paper design. * Peter Curzon of StormStudios \u2013 photo memorabilia curation and design, assisted by Lee Baker; artwork for 7-inch vinyls. * Glenn Povey \u2013 additional memorabilia. * Tracey Kraft of Pink Floyd Archive \u2013 photo stills. * Andy Jackson of Tube Mastering \u2013 audio mastering CD and 7-inch vinyl. * Ray Staff of Air Studios \u2013 audio mastering 7-inch vinyls. * Peter Sykes \u2013 The Committee director. * Barbet Schroeder \u2013 More and La Vall\u00e9e director. ==Reception== The Early Years 1965\u20131972 has a score of a 97 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 8 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called it \"a deep, multi-tiered portrait of the years when Pink Floyd were fumbling around trying to find their voice.\" He praised the tracks \"Vegetable Man\", \"In the Beechwoods\", the band's collaboration with John Latham, the soundtracks they recorded for The Committee and Zabriskie Point, and \"Moonhead\". \"Because so much of this music is raw \u2013 it's alternately live, unfinished, and improvisatory \u2013 the box underscores how Pink Floyd were an underground band right up until Dark Side\" he concludes. \"Decades later, these recordings still feel boundless: this was music made without a destination in mind and the journey remains thrilling.\" Daryl Easlea of Record Collector described the box-set as \"the sonic equivalent to background reading and extensive footnotes for their remarkable body of recorded work.\" He describes the band's earliest material from 1965 as \"showcasing what a fabulous beat band they initially were. A quick grin is not something you associate with the Floyd, but these five early tracks from 1965 are tremendous fun.\" He also praised the John Peel concert from 1971 as being \"a real treat, with a 14-minute-long Fat Old Sun displaying their improvisational might. A lengthy capture of Embryo demonstrates their glacial grandeur at its finest.\" He also singles out \"the 20 December 1967 BBC session, just a month before Barrett\u2019s departure\" as \"a revelation.\" Pitchfork named awarded the box set the week's \"Best New Reissue\". Jesse Jarnow wrote that \"[a]s career periods go, the seven years of Pink Floyd\u2019s Early Years don\u2019t exactly match other intense eras of classic rock creativity, like Bob Dylan from 1961 to 1968 or the Beatles from 1962 to 1969 [...] this set illustrates something about both Pink Floyd\u2019s own path and the rewards of resilience.\" He writes that \"in the modern age of oversized vault-clearing and copyright-protecting box sets, there is something resoundingly human about The Early Years, which only makes the achievements more extraordinary\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described the compilation as an \"exhaustive document\" that contains \"some tantalising glimpses of the different paths they could have taken\". He praised some of the material (noting, for example, the influence their \"cyclical, hypnotic repetitions and weird, very un-rock-like atmosphere\" of early improvisations like \"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\" had on \"nascent\" krautrock bands as well as their role in the development of space rock) but criticized the superfluousness of some of it (pointing out that the box-set contains \"15 versions of Careful With That Axe, Eugene\" and writing, \"there comes a point where you suspect that even the most ardent fan of Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun [...] will heave a fairly weary sigh as its three-note bassline starts up for the umpteenth time.\") ===Accolades=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
