    "text": "Darius Johnson (born 15 March 2000) is an English professional footballer who plays as a forward for FC Volendam. ==Career== As a youngster, Johnson had various internships and trials with football clubs, firstly with Queens Park Rangers before heading off to the likes of Tottenham Hotspur, Crawley Town and Oxford United, but failed to secure permanent terms. After a subsequent break from football, Johnson returned at the age of seventeen to play for The Harrow Club at youth level. During his time with them, Johnson played in a friendly against YouTube team Rising Ballers; who subsequently signed the forward. He would eventually leave the club, prior to joining Combined Counties Football League side Kensington & Ealing Borough. After making five appearances for the semi-professional outfit, Johnson joined Chelsea on trial. He earned the possibility of a contract after featuring in Premier League 2 against Brighton & Hove Albion, but was unable to sign due to Chelsea's ongoing transfer ban. Johnson secured a trial with Dutch team FC Volendam in mid-2019. He was given a professional deal soon after, having appeared in an exhibition match versus VPV Purmersteijn. He made his pro debut on 23 August 2019 during a 3\u20130 loss away to De Graafschap, as he came off the bench to replace Nick Doodeman after seventy-nine minutes. Johnson scored his first FC Volendam league goal on 13 September, netting in a home draw against FC Dordrecht. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\"|FC Volendam |2019\u201320 |rowspan=\"1\"|Eerste Divisie |4||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||4||1 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !4!!1!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!4!!1 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Chelsea, London Category:Black English sportspeople Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:English expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in the Netherlands Category:English expatriate sportspeople in the Netherlands Category:Combined Counties Football League players Category:Eerste Divisie players Category:Kensington & Ealing Borough F.C. players Category:FC Volendam players ",
