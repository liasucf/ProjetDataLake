The delia () is a garment worn by male szlachta (nobility) of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. The delia is similar to a coat or cloak, and was worn over the \u017cupan from the 16th until the early 18th century. The delia was usually fashioned from wool, cotton, or velvet, and finished with fur. The typical delia had short, loose, unsewn sleeves, and was fastened with metal buttons over the breast. The delia was of Oriental origin and the word itself came to Poland in the mid-16th century from Turkey. ==See also== * Kontusz * Pas kontuszowy * \u017bupan Category:Polish clothing Category:Lithuanian clothing ",
