    "text": "The Centre of People\u2019s Movements or Popular Movements Central (, CMP) is a Brazilian left-wing social movement organization that articulate various social urban movements in their common and general struggles, such as housing, health, women, blacks, solidarity economy, among others. Founded after a national meeting of social movements in Belo Horizonte in 1993, the CPM is the fruit of a historic process of resistance by several combative popular social movements for social struggles during the 1980s, such as the defense of the right to the city and a Brazilian democratic project for the country able to guarantee wide social involvement. The need to create a toll able to coordinate and to join forces between various social movements in the struggle for rights and for the construction of public policies was the main purpose of creating the CPM, and continues as a guiding principle of its performance. Thereafter, the CPM starts to get involved in some of the main social struggles in Brazil, such the Cry of the Excluded, national campaign and caravans in defense of rights, demonstrations against the implementation of privatization and neoliberal agenda, and marches to promote employment and the economic and social development. In recent years, it also played an important role as one of the leftist and social organization involved in protests against the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff and in the Free Lula movement. ==See also== * Cry of the Excluded * Landless Workers' Movement * Free Lula movement ==References== Category:Protests in Brazil Category:Left- wing politics in Brazil Category:Social movements in Brazil Category:Political advocacy groups in Brazil Category:Labor in Brazil Category:Socialism in Brazil Category:Wealth in Brazil Category:Social justice organizations ",
