    "text": "Hajo Seppelt (born 1963) is a German journalist and author. == Personal life and education == Seppelt was born in Berlin, and is the son of Alfred Seppelt, who was the head of the Berlin Chess Federation from 1984 to 2004. In 1981, he obtained his college preparatory degree (Abitur) at the Beethoven High School (Berlin) in Berlin's Lankwitz neighborhood. He studied sports, social studies, journalism and French at the Free University of Berlin for a few semesters but did not complete a degree. == Career == Since 1985, Seppelt has worked as a sports reporter for Germany's premier public broadcaster ARD. He has also worked for the Berlin public broadcaster Sender Freies Berlin and its 2003 successor Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg. After working for many years as a live commentary for swimming events for ARD, he was stripped of this duty in the early summer of 2006. Seppelt said that this was in reaction to a private email, in which he criticized ARD's uncritical reporting on doping, becoming public. Since 2006, he has worked as a freelance journalist for ARD and has made a number of reports and documentary films about doping. === Doping in Germany === Together with former Canadian swimmer Karin Helmstaedt, Seppelt made the documentary film Staatsgeheimnis Kinderdoping (State Secret Child Doping) about the perpetrators and victims of doping in East German swimming. It was broadcast by ARD. Together with Holger Sch\u00fcck, he published the book Anklage: Kinderdoping. Das Erbe des DDR-Sports (Indictment Doping: The Legacy of East German Sports) in 1999. It also dealt with the topic of state doping in Communist East Germany. In 2006, Seppelt reported extensively about the doping problem in cycling. Among other things, his research led to the identification of the German physician Markus China as a member of the doping network organized by Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes.RBB Online, Nach ARD- Informationen Deutscher Komplize des spanischen Dopingnetzwerkes identifiziert In November of that year, he was awarded the Leuchtturm f\u00fcr besondere publizistische Leistungen (Lighthouse Prize for Special Journalist Achievement) by the journalists\u2019 association Netzwerk Recherche for his research, reports and exclusive revelations about cyclists Jan Ullrich and Floyd Landis and Eufemiano Fuentes.RBB Online, Journalistenpreis f\u00fcr RBB-Sport reporter Hajo Seppelt In the documentary \u201cMission: Clean Sport\u201c Hajo Seppelt and Jo Goll documented the work of German doping control officers. The film highlighted flaws in Germany's doping-control system and caused heady public discussions, which contributed to structural changes in Germany's National Anti Doping Agency (NADA). The report won the Silver Chest Award 2007 at the International Television Film Festival in Plovdiv and the international Sports Movie and TV Award 2007 in Milan.inside-digital.de, The film was also nominated for the German Television Prize and the Prix Europa. In mid-January the German Skiing Association (DSV) took legal action, and a Hamburg court issued an injunction against Seppelt for refusing to make a cease-and-desist declaration demanded by the DSV about suspicions that German cross-country skiers and biathletes had engaged in blood doping in a Vienna laboratory.FOCUS Online, Deutsche in Wiener Blutbank (16 January 2008) A superior court in Hamburg overturned that ruling in Seppelt's favor, concluding that DSV had no right to demand the cease-and-desist declaration because it was not affected by the journalist's reporting. The ruling was based constitutional guarantees of journalist freedom in cases of anonymous sources. The judgement also overturned an injunction from October 21, 2008.taz, Das Klima ist rauer (1. Dezember 2008) Seppelt's suspicion could not be proved after extensive investigations. In January 2012 Seppelt and colleagues from the Western German public broadcaster WDR had reports featured on ARD and WDR sports programs about the blood of thirty athletes being exposed to ultra-violet radiation by a sports doctor in the Eastern German city of Erfurt. Several of the athletes concerned were named. In the wake of the broadcasts, a discussion arose as to whether such procedures were banned according to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) code. WADA itself considered them to be.Hajo Seppelt: Interview mit NADA-Generaldirektor David Howman \u2013 Erneuter Kurswechsel der WADA im Fall Erfurt? , in: Sportschau.de, 4. Juni 2012. Anti-doping investigations of the athletes ended up with discontinuations and acquittals due to extenuating circumstances, and a criminal investigation of the doctor concerned was also discontinued. Nonetheless, many experts declared that blood treatments were banned in principle by the laws governing sports. The doctor tried to get a superior court in Cologne to issue an injunction against WDR,sid: Erfurter Arzt erwirkt einstweilige Verf\u00fcgung, in Focus.de, 1. M\u00e4rz 2012. but the broadcaster won out, and the report was allowed to contain references to \u201cforbidden blood treatments.\u201dsid: Erfurter Doping-Aff\u00e4re: WDR siegt vor OLG, in: Focus.de, 27. November 2012. === Doping in China === Parallel with the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, ARD broadcast the 45-minute-documentary Olympia im Reich der Mittel: Doping in China (Flying High in the Middle Kingdom: Doping in China), which Seppelt made with Jo Goll. The film reported about doping and doping controls in China, in particularly above proven case of stem-cell manipulation carried out on top athletes.DOKfilm, Olympia im Reich der Mittel At the International New York Film Festival, it won a world gold medal for long-form reporting. It was also awarded the main prize at 2009 Sportfilm Liberec 2007 - World Facts Challenge festival.NDR, Auszeichnung Sportfilm Liberec 2009 === Doping in Kenya === In the spring and summer of 2012, Seppelt and Kempe reported for the first time about doping among Kenyan track-and-field athletes. The focus was primarily on practices among doctors in the background. One athlete told of widespread doping among Kenyan long- distance runners.Topl\u00e4ufer aus Kenia gesteht in der ARD Doping, in: ARD.de, 6. August 2012.Kenianer Kisorio nennt weitere Doping-Details, in: ARD.de, 8. August 2012. The reports caused intense reactions in Kenya and met with considerable international resonance. As a result, doping controls were stepped up in the country. The documentary Doping - Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics shows that it is relatively easy to obtain banned performance-enhancing drugs in Kenya. It traces the story of an impoverished young runner who seems to have died from the side effects of taking EPO. Kenyan athletics authorities refused to speak with Seppelt about the issue, and his film presents circumstantial evidence of corruption among Kenyan sports functionaries. Former Boston marathon winner Rito Jeptoo asserts that Kenyan athletes are not subjected to blood tests while training. Another Kenyan runner claims that the national federation suppresses positive doping results in return for bribes. Seppelt also suggests the International Association of Athletics Federations isn't doing enough to address the problem of doping in endurance disciplines. After evaluating data on athletes' blood collected at major athletics competitions over a number of years, two Australian scientists conclude that doping is the only plausible explanation for some of the measurements. The IAAF also refused to speak with Seppelt about his suspicions. In August 2015, he presented a nearly hour-long report questioning athletics in general and Kenya's long-distance runners in particular. Shortly before the IAAF World Championships in London, German broadcaster ARD aired a new episode of Doping Top Secret in August 2017, titled \"The Big Money Run. Africa's Athletes on Sale.\" The feature by Hajo Seppelt, Benjamin Best, Ulrike Unfug, and Grit Hartmann particularly examines people surrounding and influencing African Athletes in track and field disciplines. It focuses not only on doping, but also delves into shady practices of managers and into the numerous changes of nationality that occur in this core Olympic sport. === Doping in Russia === In December 2014 ARD broadcast Seppelt's film Geheimsache Doping: Wie Russland seine Sieger macht (The Doping Secret: How Russia Makes its Winners), made with the help of Russi athletes who told their stories in front of the camera. In this 60-minute documentary, whistleblowers testified to systematic doping in athletics and other sports in Russia. The film presents evidence for these allegations in form of footage and audio recordings secretly made by the whistleblowers as well as official documents. The documentary attracted global media attention and was broadcast worldwide in a number of languages. After its broadcast in Germany, several figures in international sports organizations and anti-doping institutions either resigned their posts or were suspended. http://hajoseppelt.de/2014/12/the-secrets-of-doping-how-russia-makes-its- winners/ In March 2016, in its Sport Inside program, the WDR broadcast another film on doping in athletics with a focus on Russia: \u201cGeheimsache Doping: Russlands T\u00e4uschungsman\u00f6ver\u201d (\u201cThe Doping Secret: Russia\u2019s Red Herrings\u201d). In it, Hajo Seppelt, together with co-author Florian Riesewieck, showed how Russian coaches and officials avoided conditions of the World Athletics Federation IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA. The 30-minute documentary once again received extensive international attention and was broadcast in several countries. http://hajoseppelt.de/2016/03/doping-secret- russias-red-herrings/ In November 2016 the documentary \"Doping - Top secret: The protection racket\" (by Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck, Olga Sviridenko and Felix Becker) was aired in ARD's weekly programme \"Sportschau\". It is based on a joint investigation by the French newspaper Le Monde and the ARD doping editorial team. The documentary is about criminal activities linked to doping and cover up in international athletics. http://www.ardmediathek.de/tv/Sportschau/Doping-Top-Secret-The-Protection- Rack/Das-Erste/Video?bcastId=53524&documentId;=39197456 http://www.playthegame.org/news/news-articles/2016/0251_new-claims-further- involve-iaaf-top-in-russian-doping-coverups/ In May 2018 ARD announced that Russia had declared void a visa issued to Seppelt so he could report on the 2018 FIFA World Cup, citing Russia stating that Seppelt is on a list of unwanted persons. In May 2018 Hajo Seppelt and Florian Riesewieck produced another episode of the documentary series \"Doping Top Secret\" on ARD \u2013 titled \"Russia\u2018s Football Friends\". This time they focused on suspicious facts in football in Russia, host country of the World Cup. === Doping in Weightlifting === On 5 January 2020, Seppelt released a documentary on ARD titled 'Secret Doping - the Lord of the Lifters'. In the documentary, Seppelt uncovers that weightlifters as young as 13 in Thailand are encouraged to take performance enhancing drugs. In a secret recording, Seppelt also captures footage of Olympic bronze medalist Siripuch Gulnoi admitting to taking performance enhancing drugs before winning bronze at the 2012 Olympics. Other secret footage also captures a doctor with the Moldovan weightlifting team claiming that they used doppelgangers to give urine samples for athletes in exchange for payments. The documentary also made claims of corruption against the IWF and its president, Tam\u00e1s Aj\u00e1n, resulting in him stepping aside from the role pending an investigation and resigning as an IOC honorary member.https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-statement-on-tamas-ajan He eventually resigned from his position as president permanently on 15 April. The president and entire executive board of the Thai Amateur Weightlifting Association (TAWA) also resigned from their positions. The new acting president of the IWF appointed Richard McLaren, the Canadian lawyer whose investigative work did so much to expose state-sponsored doping in Russia, to lead the investigation into corruption and doping in weightlifting. === Other reports === Prior to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, ARD broadcast the 45-minute-documentary \u201cFlying High in the Middle Kingdom: Doping in China\u201d, which Hajo Seppelt produced with Jo Goll. The film reported about doping and doping controls in China, in particular, about proven cases of stem-cell manipulation carried out on top athletes. At the International New York Film Festival, it won a world gold medal for long-form reporting. It was also awarded the main prize at the 2009 Sportfilm Liberec 2007 \u2013 World Facts Challenge Festival. Prior to the 2009 World Athletics Championships in Berlin, ARD broadcast the documentary \u201cDoping Top Secret: The String-Pullers in Athletics\u201c by Hajo Seppelt and Robert Kempe about the people who pull the strings in doping in track-and- field.ARD, Prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, ARD broadcast the 30-minute feature \u201cGeheimsache Doping Eiskalter Betrug\u201d (\u201cDoping Top Secret: \u201eIce-Cold Cheating\u201d). In it, Hajo Seppelt, Robert Kempe and Jochen Leufgens took a look behind the scenes at winter sports.ARD, In the wake of research by Seppelt in September 2010 about the world's top cyclist Alberto Contador, the Union Cycliste Internationale had to admit that the Spanish Tour de France winner had turned up positive in doping tests. It emerged that the UCI had wanted to keep secrets a positive test by Contador for the substance Clenbuterol at the Tour de France in July 2010.Tagesschau, In February 2012, Contador was retroactively banned for two years, from August 2010 to August 2012, by the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for Clenbuterol use.sportschau In May 2011, Seppelt and co-filmmaker Kempe had the chance to film footage about sports for a week in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. The result was the documentary film Sport in Nordkorea - Einblicke in eine unbekannte Welt (Sports in North Korea \u2013 A Look at an Unknown World), which was broadcast by ARD in July 2011. In 2013, Seppelt and Kempe completed a critical documentary about Thomas Bach, shortly before he was elected president of the International Olympic Committee. In January 2017 Germany's ARD television aired another part of its \u201cDoping Top Secret\u201d series. The new episode focussed on Russian whistleblower Andrey Dmitriev. Frustrated with the persistence of doping in his home country's athletics community, the runner made secret video recordings. The footage enabled him to prove that a big-name coach suspended due to doping links is still working with athletes. In April 2017, Hajo Seppelt and his colleague Thilo Neumann revealed the existence of positive doping tests for Clenbuterol in the context of follow-up checks during the 2008 Olympic Games in Peking. The journalists also uncovered that the IOC kept these results a secret in consultation with WADA. Research showed that the IOC did not follow up on these cases, even though the organization's regulations demand further investigation in case of positive doping tests. Among the athletes who were tested positive, there was at least one Jamaican sprinter. The IOC's declaration, stating that the positive tests were a result of the athletes\u2019 consumption of meat from China which supposedly contained Clenbuterol and that therefore there where no investigations concerning other possible causes, engendered worldwide criticism. In June 2017 the German Broadcaster a new Episode of \"Doping Top Secret\", titled \"Brazil\u2019s dirty game\", was aired by ARD. The documentary by Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck und Thilo Neumann examined the topic of doping in the host country of the last Football World Championships and of the last Olympic Games. Massive failings and shortcomings of Brazil's doping prevention plans where substantiated. Additionally, a multitude of indications for a culture of doping, deeply rooted in Brazil Football and stretching up to the national elite could be found. In June 2018 on occasion of the Football World Cup in Russia ARD German TV aired a documentary titled \"Doping Top secret: Brazil\u2019s Twelfth man\" (Authors: Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck, Edmund Willison) about doping in Brazilian football.Geheimsache Doping: Brasiliens zw\u00f6lfter Mann, ARD, July 1, 2018Geheimsache Doping - Profifu\u00dfballer besuchen dubiosen brasilianischen Mediziner, Hajo Seppelt, Florian Riesewieck, Edmund Willison und Sebastian M\u00fcnster, ARD, July 1, 2018Doping: German journalists expose doctor linked to Brazilian football stars, Alexander Pearson, Deutsche Welle, July 2, 2018\u201eHormone sind das Elixier des Lebens\u201c, Jessica Sturmberg, Deutschlandfunk, July 1, 2018 (in German)Bericht \u00fcber Doping in Brasilien, Sport1, July 1, 2018 (in German)Berichte \u00fcber angebliches Doping-Netzwerk in Brasiliens Fu\u00dfball, Spiegel Online, July 2, 2018 (in German)Dopingskandal skakar Brasilien mitt under VM Fotbolls-VM 2018, Expressen, July 2, 2018 (in Swedish) == Awards == *2018 German Sports Journalist of the Year *2018 Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany *2018 Gold World Medal at the New York Film Festivals in the category \u201eCurrent affairs\u201c for \u201cDoping Top secret: The Big Money Run \u2013 Africa\u2018s Athletes on Sale\u201d (Co- Authors: Ulrike Unfug, Benjamin Best and Grit Hartmann) *2017 \u201ePlay the Game\u201c Award (together with the whistleblowers Vitalyi Stepanov and Yuliya Stepanova) *2017 \u201eMention D\u2019Honneur\u201c in the category \u201cSport & Society\u201d for the documentary film \u201cDoping \u2013 Top Secret: The Big Money Run \u2013 Africa\u2019s Athletes On Sale\u201d at the international film festival of Federation Internationale Cinema Television Sportifs in Milano *2017 Main Prize at International Festival Sportfilm Liberec \u2013 International FICTS Festival for the Documentaries \u201cShowdown for Russia\u201d and \u201cRussia\u2019s Red Herrings\u201d (Co-Authors: Florian Riesewieck, Olga Sviridenko and Felix Becker) *2017 Tagesthemen Award for the reporting on doping in Russia *2017 Gold World Medal at the New York Film Festivals in the category \u201cCurrent affairs\u201d for \u201cDoping Top secret: Showdown for Russia\u201d (in cooperation with Florian Riesewieck, Felix Becker and Olga Sviridenko) *2017 Nomination of the WDR program sport inside for the 53rd Adolf Grimme Prize (member of the team of authors) *2016 Winner of the Open Russia Award f\u00fcr independent news journalism and investigative research on Russian topics *2016 International Sports Movies TV Award in the category \u201cSport & Society\u201d for the documentary film \u201cDoping \u2013 Top Secret: Russia\u2019s Red Herrings\u201d at the international film festival of Federation Internationale Cinema Television Sportifs in Milano *2016 Nomination Tagesthemen Award (sports category) for the story \u201cARD requests unwelcome: IAAF President Coe\u2019s poor start\u201d *2016 Laureate of the Hanns-Joachim-Friedrichs-Award for TV journalism *2016 Nomination of \u201cDoping \u2013 Top Secret: Showdown for Russia\u201d for PRIX EUROPA 2016 (category TV Current Affairs) *2016 Nomination for the Austrian Film and Television Award Goldene ROMY for \u201cDoping \u2013 Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics\u201d in the category \u201cBest TV Documentary\u201d *2016 Finalist at the New York Film Festivals in the category \u201cBest Investigative Report\u201d for \u201cDoping \u2013 Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics\u201d *2016 Bud- Greenspan-Award der New York Track and Field Writers for the documentaries \u201cDoping \u2013 Top Secret: How Russia makes its winners\u201d and \u201cDoping \u2013 Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics\u201d *2016 German Television Prize in the category Best Sports Program for \u201cDoping \u2013 Top Secret: How Russia makes its winners\u201d and \u201cDoping \u2013 Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics\u201d *2015 Awards at the first global competition for sports journalism, the \u201cSports Media Pearl Award\u201d (by AIPS) in Abu Dhabi: first price in the category Video documentary for \u201cDoping \u2013 Top Secret: The Shadowy World of Athletics\u201d and special price in the category \u201cBest investigative reporting\u201d *2015 Award of the Berlin-Brandenburg Journalists Association: \u201cLanger Atem\u201d \u2013 for dedication and perseverance in journalistic research.
