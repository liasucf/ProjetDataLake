    "text": "Marco Katz (born March 16, 1952, in New York City, USA) plays trombone and arranges and composes music for band, brass quintet and other musical ensembles. The reviewer Adam Gaines, in a review of the Bundee Brothers Bone Band album, wrote that \"Katz's compositions are a real highlight of the disc. His trombone writing is expertly idiomatic, and his music is harmonically interesting without being obtuse.\"Adam Gaines, >\"Bundee Brothers Bone Band: A Review\" , Online Trombone Journal Mundo Universitario, a program televised by the University of Valle, featured \"Marco Katz, master of literature and a professional musician, who was the last trombonist with the legends Charlie Palmieri and Mon Rivera.\"Arboleda, Andrea. .

Katz performed as a featured soloist with Mon Rivera and recorded with the Lebron Brothers and Carlos Barber\u00eda y su Orquesta Kubavana. In 1978, he was nominated \u201cTrombonist of the Year\u201d by Latin NY magazine for his recording work with the Alegre All- Stars director Charlie Palmieri. Writing in Herencia Latina, the music critic Jairo Grijalba Ruiz noted that \"The Heavyweight\" by Palmieri included \"a solo with mute by Marco Katz, which is truly extraordinary and at the same time brief demonstration of his style.\"Grijalba Ruiz, Jairo, \"Un encuentro en Popoy\u00e1n con Marco Katz.\" (Charlie Palmieri incluy\u00f3 un solo de tromb\u00f3n con sordina a cargo de Marco Katz, el cual es en verdad una extraordinaria y al mismo tiempo muy breve demostraci\u00f3n de su estilo.) Herencia Latina. Dec. 2012-Jan. 2013 In 1994, he recorded \"Tubby the Tuba Meets a Jazz Band\" for Tubby the Tuba and Friends, an Angel Records release with narrations by Paul Tripp and performances by Bob Stewart on tuba, Jimmy Owens on trumpet, Paquito D'Rivera on clarinet, Katz on trombone, Chuck Folds on piano, John Thomas on percussion and Oliver Jackson on drums.Allegro, Volume CVIII No. 9sydmusic.com: Tubby article This track was re-released as part of Tubby the Tuba Presents Play it Happy, on the Koch Records, now E1 Music, catalog with Meredith Vieira as narrator.Tubby the Tuba Presents Play it Happy! at All Music Katz's score for Zoey's Zoo (Oh Yeah!

Music Publishers, International Music Co. and Carl Fischer Music.sheetmusicplus.com: Search result for Katz The arrangements for the International Music Company often employ classical compositions in settings for trombones and brass quintets. Although some of these works, especially the trombone trios and quartets, have been well received by educators, a reviewer in the International Trumpet Guild Journal finds fault with Katz's brass quintet arrangements of music by Juan Morel Campos. The reviewer objects to Katz's positing of Morel Campos as an important composer, noting \"he does not merit a mention in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.\" As for the works themselves, the reviewer finds them \"rhythmically interesting but rather simple melodically.\"Johansen, David. \"Review of Four Danzas\". International Trumpet Guild Journal. June 2002: p. 74. Katz earned a Performing-Artists-in-the-Schools certification from Teachers College, Columbia University, in 1987. Five years later, he studied gamelan music in Bali. From 2001-2002, he lived in Spain and studied art, politics and literature at the Complutense University of Madrid, textual training that helped him formulate critical views on the place of musicians in contemporary society. He later earned his BA and MA at Humboldt State University and a PhD at the University of Alberta. Following those studies, he began to perform music and teach literature at MacEwan University. In the twenty-first century, Katz has turned to writing on music and other cultural topics.
