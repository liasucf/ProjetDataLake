    "text": "Joseph Belcher (died 1724) was a minister from Dedham, Massachusetts. ==Personal life== Belcher was born on May 14, 1669 in Milton, Massachusetts and was graduated from Harvard College in 1690. Soon after moving to Dedham, he married Abigail Thompson. They had six children. His son, Sir Joseph Belcher, was a Harvard graduate and a teacher in the Dedham Public Schools. In 1721 he came down with a \"dangerous paralysis\" and went to Roxbury to the home of his son-in-law, Rev. Thomas Walter. There he was cared for by his wife's brother, Dr. Philip Sampson. He died in Roxbury on April 27, 1723 and five of the \"principal men\" of Dedham were appointed to hire a coach to transport his body back to Dedham. The town appropriated 40 pounds to cover the expenses of his funeral. He is buried in the Old Village Cemetery. ==Ministry== He first preached in Dedham on April 17, 1692 and then again for the second time a month later on May 15th. The records of May 23, 1692 Town Meeting indicate that \"the Ch and Town have given a call\" to have Belcher move to Dedham and serve as the minister. Belcher returned to preach on June 12th and did so regularly beginning on October 30th. Church records indicate the call was given on December 4, 1692. A few weeks later, on December 23rd, Town Meeting voted to set his salary at 60 pounds a year. He was minister at the First Church and Parish in Dedham from 1693 until 1723, although illness prevented him from preaching after 1721. During his time as minister, a tax was instituted in Dedham to ensure his salary was paid. He tried to have the church return to a system of voluntary contributions in 1696, but it failed. By the end of his tenure his salary was 100 pounds a year plus the firewood provided by members of the parish. The town also contributed 60 pounds to build a parsonage on land now owned by the Allin Congregational Church. His portrait, donated in 1839, hangs just left of First Church's pulpit. Five of his sermons survive. One was delivered before the Great and General Court, one before the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, two preached in Dedham specifically for young people, and one at the ordination of Nathaniel Cotton in Bristol, Rhode Island. ==Notes== ==References== ==Works cited== * * * ==External links== Category:American clergy Category:Clergy from Dedham, Massachusetts Category:People from Milton, Massachusetts Category:1724 deaths Category:1669 births Category:Harvard College alumni Category:Burials at Old Village Cemetery ",
