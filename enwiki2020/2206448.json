The West Indies became a full member of the Imperial Cricket Conference (now the International Cricket Council) on 31 May 1926 at the same time as India and New Zealand. It played its first test match in 1928 against England at Lord's. Their first game against other opposition came in 1930/31 when they played Australia. In the mid-1980s there were two rebel West Indian tours to South Africa, which was at that time banned from official competition because of the apartheid r\u00e9gime then in force there. None of the matches from the rebel tours were recognised as official Test matches and all players who toured South Africa at the time were banned from official international cricket matches for life. The captains of those West Indian sides are also listed below. Prior to becoming a member of the ICC, the first combined West Indian team was formed in 1884Canada Cricket online \u2013 scroll to \"West Indies 1886 tour to Canada\" and toured Canada and the United States in 1886 under the captaincies of Charles Guy Austin Wyatt of DemeraraThe Development of West Indies Cricket Google Book results pages 22 and 23 and Laurence Fyfe of JamaicaCanada Cricket online \u2013 scroll to \"The first West Indies cricket tour\" (also vice captain under Wyatt). In a return tour by the United States in 1888, the combined West Indian team was captained by Edward Wright.West Indies versus the Gentlemen of the United States of America 1888Cricket Archive: Edward Wright Combined West Indian teams have played more regular first-class cricket under the name \u201cWest Indies\u201d since 1897 usually against amateur sides touring from England, such as Lord Brackley\u2019s XI or RA Bennett\u2019s XI, but from 1912 onwards the MCC also played on tour against the West Indies. The West Indies also toured England in 1900, 1906 and 1923 with the opposition usually being various English first- class and minor county sides. Other opposition during these tours included amateur sides, the MCC, an England XI (once) and Scotland and Ireland (once each). Some of the matches played on the various West Indian tours of England were deemed not to be first-class matches. During this time (1897 to 1926) the various West Indies captains were Aucher Warner, Stanley Sproston (non-first- class matches only), Harold Austin, Clement King, Alfred Harrigan, Edwin Moulder, William Sherlock, Percy Tarilton, Malcolm Austin and Karl Nunes ==Men's cricket== ===Test match captains=== This is a list of cricketers who have captained the West Indian cricket team for at least one Test match. Development of the Test captaincy of West Indies falls into three eras \u2013 *The period of white captaincy *Rise to become the dominant Test nation *Slide from Test domination. The table of results is complete up to the third and final Test match for the West Indies in the 2020 West Indian tour of England. Where a player has a dagger (\u2020) next to a Test match series in which he captained at least one Test, that denotes that player deputised for the appointed captain or were appointed for a minor proportion in a series. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"90%\" ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" colspan=9 | West Indian Test match captains |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" !

The first Twenty20 International played in the West Indies was played on 20 June 2008 against Australia in Bridgetown, Barbados. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" ! colspan=10 style=\"border-right:0px;\"; | West Indian Twenty20 International captains |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" !

The Rest of the World teams that played in England and Australia in 1970 and 1971/2 respectively were captained by a West Indian. World Series Cricket featured a West Indian side, and finally, there were two rebel West Indian tours to apartheid South Africa. ====Rest of the World, 1970 and 1971/2==== When the South African tour to England due to take place in 1970 was cancelled, five matches were arranged against a Rest of the World team, all of which were recognised as Tests at the time, although they were later stripped of Test status. A similar situation also arose with the proposed South African tour of Australia that was due to take place in 1971/2, when the Rest of the World team also played two one-day matches. (There were to be three games, but one was abandoned without a ball being bowled.) These matches do not have official ODI status. The Rest of the World team was captained by a West Indian, Garfield Sobers. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"90%\" ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" colspan=9 | Rest of the World Test match captains |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" !

Three sides were constructed: an Australian team, a West Indian team and a World team, with the World teams including some West Indians too. The teams played a mixture of unofficial Test matches, styled as Supertests, and unofficial ODIs. Unlike the Australian players, who were barred from playing official cricket until the rift was healed after the 1978/9 season, the West Indian players were permitted to play official cricket as well as compete in World Series Cricket. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"90%\" ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" colspan=9 | West Indian Supertest match captains |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" !

The West Indies Cricket Board banned all the tourists from cricket for life, and such was the furore caused by the visits that many of the cricketers ceased to be welcome in their home islands. The rebel West Indian squad played a series of Tests and ODIs, none of which have official status. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"90%\" ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" colspan=9 | West Indian rebel Test match captains |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" !

The West Indies\u2019 most successful captains in Test cricket are Viv Richards (who has won 27 of his 50 Tests), Clive Lloyd (who won 36 of his 74 Tests), Frank Worrell (who won 9 of his 15 Tests) and Richie Richardson (who won 11 of his 24 Tests). In one-day internationals the West Indies\u2019 most successful captain is Clive Lloyd, who won 64 of his 84 matches. The successes of the senior men's team in international tournaments was never replicated at the youth level until the 2016 U-19 Cricket World Cup when Shimron Hetmyer lead the West Indies Under-19 team to their first ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup title. For the most recent international format of cricket, Twenty20 Internationals, the West Indies' best result in an international tournament was achieved in the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and 2016 ICC World Twenty20 where the team won the ICC World Twenty20 under the captaincy of Darren Sammy. Stafanie Taylor led the West Indies' women's team to their best result in an international Twenty20 tournament when the team won the 2016 ICC Women's World Twenty20. Prior to that Merissa Aguilleira led West Indies women to the semi-finals in the 2010 ICC Women's World Twenty20, the 2012 ICC Women's World Twenty20 and the 2014 ICC Women's World Twenty20 and also led the women to their first title in an international Women's Twenty20 tournament during the 2010 ICC Women's Cricket Challenge. Both the West Indies' men's and women's teams made it to the semi- finals of the 2012 ICC World Twenty20 and 2012 ICC Women's World Twenty20 under the captaincies of Darren Sammy and Merissa Aguilleira respectively; the third time the men's and women's teams from the same country have done this in the ICC World Twenty20 after Australia's men and women's teams achieved the feat in 2010 and 2012. This feat was repeated for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 and 2014 ICC Women's World Twenty20 when the West Indies' men's and women's teams made it to the semi-finals again under the captaincies of Darren Sammy and Merissa Aguillera. This was bettered in 2016 when both the West Indies' men's and women's teams not only made it to the semi-finals but won the tournaments for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 and 2016 ICC Women's World Twenty20 under the captaincies of Darren Sammy and Stafanie Taylor. Along with men and women's teams from New Zealand (in 2016), England (2016), South Africa (2014), and Australia (2012 and 2010) who also made it the semi-finals in the previous tournaments, this was the eighth time men's and women's teams from the same country have reached the semi-finals in the same year of the ICC World Twenty20. It was also only the second time (after Australia in 2010) that men's and women's teams from the same country have reached the final in the same year of the ICC's premier Twenty20 tournaments. Merissa Aguilleira also led the West Indies women to its best result in Women's ODI cricket when the team finished second in the 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup (bettering their previous best finish in the Women's World Cup of fifth place in 2005). Their previous best result had been under Stephanie Power when she led the West Indies to second place in the 2003 IWCC Trophy. Aguilleira is also the most successful West Indies women\u2019s captain in one-day internationals, winning 32 of 55 matches. The only women\u2019s captain who has led her side to a victory in a women's Test match is Louise Browne in the 1976/77 Test series against India. ==See also== *List of West Indian Test cricketers *List of West Indian ODI cricketers *Development of the Test captaincy of West Indies ==References== *Cricket Archive *Wisden Cricketers' Almanack * Captains West Indies National ",
