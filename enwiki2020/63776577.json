    "text": "Kim Hye-jun (born May 8, 1995) is a South Korean actress. She is best known for her role in Kingdom as Queen Consort Cho. She won Best New Actress at the 40th Blue Dragon Film Awards for her role in Another Child. Her other works include Matrimonial Chaos and Rain or Shine. == Career == She first appeared in commercials in 2015 and was still studying theater and film at Hanyang University when she debuted in the lesbian romance web series Lily Fever. Determined to go to as many auditions as possible in order to gain experience, she unexpectedly passed one for Saturday Night Live Korea, although she had always considered herself to have no talent for comedy, and so joined the regular cast of the TV show in 2016. Having made her name participating in several popular skits, she left the show at the end of the season in June. She starred in several short movies such as A Transfer Student and appearing as support in a few TV series. She landed her first role in a feature film in After Spring. In 2018, Kim was cast as one of the main characters in Netflix Original series Kingdom, portraying the unusual character of an ambitious teenage queen who is expecting the heir of the throne. In late 2018, she reunited with Bae Doona in the TV series Matrimonial Chaos, playing Bae's younger sister. Although Kim's acting in Kingdom was criticized by some viewers who would find it inconsistent with the much codified period piece genre, she was praised just a few months later for her performance as one of the leads in Another Child, the directorial debut of Kim Yun-seok. In 2020, she got a lead role in the black comedy mystery MBC television series Chip In (2020), alongside Oh Na-ra. == Filmography == === Films === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Year !Title !Role |- |2018 |Her Story |Hye Soo's friend |- |2018 |After Spring |Hyang Yi |- |2019 |Another Child |Kwon Joo Ri |- |2019 |Metamorphosis |Park Sun Woo |- |2020 |Sink Hole |Eun Joo |} === Television series === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Year !Title !Role !Network |- |2015 |Lily Fever |Kim Kyung Ju |Naver |- |2016 |Dr. Romantic |Jang Hyun Joo |SBS |- |2017 |Green Fever |Wan Seon |Naver |- |2017 |Reunited Worlds |Sung Soo Ji |SBS |- |2017 |Rain or Shine |Lee Jae Young |JTBC |- |2018 |Matrimonial Chaos |Kang Ma Ru |KBS2 |- |2019\u20132020 |Kingdom |Queen Consort Cho |Netflix |- |2020 |Chip In | Yoo Bit-na |MBC |} == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Award !Category !Nominated work !Result !Ref. |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2019 |28th Buli Film Awards | Best New Actress | rowspan=\"4\" |Another Child | | |- |40th Blue Dragon Film Awards |Best New Actress | | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2020 |56th Baeksang Arts Awards |Best New Actress | | |- |14th Asian Film Awards |Best Newcomer | | |} == References == Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean actresses Category:21st-century South Korean actresses Category:South Korean film actresses Category:South Korean television actresses ",
