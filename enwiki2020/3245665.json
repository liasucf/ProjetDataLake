In 1963, the station was acquired by Springfield Broadcasting, a division of Stuart Stations. It aired a full service middle of the road music format, using NBC Radio News for its world and national news coverage. Mid-West Family Broadcasting bought the station in 1976, switching it to country music a short time later.Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-72 In the early 1990s, WMAY went with an oldies format, and it flipped to its current talk radio format in 1995. Mid-West Family Broadcasting also owns local stations 98.7 WNNS-FM, 97.7 WQLZ and 92.7 WUSW. Three of the most well-known broadcasters to pass through the studio were Bob Hale (hired directly from Clear Lake, IA after the Buddy Holly plane crash in 1959. He mc'd the show at the Surf Ballroom that night, gave casualties the next day, and was hired by WMAY; he purportedly made the coin flip between Ritchie Valens and Tommy Allsup for the final seat on the plane.); Cal Schrum (\"The State Policeman's Friend,\" on the overnight shift; starred in several B westerns and was beloved by law enforcement personnel working the \"graveyard shift\"); and Red Barnes (Gregory Harutunian), his 1980s successor who would \"set the chickens free,\" in the early morning hours. The station was also known in the 1980s for its \u201cLittle Black Box\u201d promotion that awarded keys to a new vehicle to the finder of a hidden box containing keys to a new vehicle. The station would air clues for listeners to scavenger hunt the surrounding metro area for the \u201cblack box\u201d. The promotion ended around the time the station switched from its long-running Country format. On August 28, 2020, it was announced by Midwest Family that WUSW would drop their country format and begin simulcasting WMAY on September 1. The addition of 92.7 expands WMAY\u2019s FM coverage to areas to the south and east of Springfield.
