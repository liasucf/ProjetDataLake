She was a local deputy to the LII Legislature of the Congress of Sonora, which met from 1988 to 1991, and a federal deputy to the LV Legislature of the Mexican Congress, which convened between 1991 and 1994. In 1994, Soto left the PARM in order to accept the Labor Party's presidential nomination. After placing fourth, she later developed a rift with the party when it refused to discuss various reforms she had proposed. In 2001, President Vicente Fox appointed her as the Mexican ambassador to Brazil. Soto was among the more active Mexican diplomats in Brazil, traveling extensively and promoting Mexican firms in the country. In 2008, Carlos Slim appointed Soto to be the Executive Director of the Technological Institute of Tel\u00e9fonos de M\u00e9xico, a non-profit organization promoting education. She remained in that position for six years. In 2015, Soto returned to the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in more than 20 years, on the party ticket of the Party of the Democratic Revolution.
