The station is owned by Quincy Media. WXOW's studios and transmitter are located on County Highway 25 in La Crescent, Minnesota. WQOW (channel 18) in Eau Claire operates as a semi- satellite of WXOW, extending the ABC signal into the Chippewa Valley of Wisconsin. As such, it simulcasts all network and syndicated programming as provided through WXOW but airs separate commercial inserts, legal identifications, local newscasts and Sunday morning religious programs,Program Information for WXOW at TitanTV.comProgram Information for WQOW at TitanTV.com and has its own website. WXOW serves the southern half of the La Crosse\u2013Eau Claire market while WQOW serves the northern portion. The two stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes. Although WQOW maintains its own studios on Friedeck Road in Eau Claire, master control and some internal operations are based at WXOW's facilities. DirecTV and Dish Network offer both WXOW and WQOW as of September 2010. ==History== WXOW signed on on March 7, 1970 as a semi-satellite of WKOW-TV in Madison, which was owned by Horizon Communications at the time. Before then, ABC programming in the market was relegated to off-hours clearances on CBS affiliate WKBT (channel 8) and NBC affiliate WEAU (channel 13). Depending on the location, Western Wisconsin viewers could get the full ABC schedule on KMSP-TV from the Twin Cities, KAUS- TV (now KAAL) in Austin, Minnesota, or WKOW. For its first decade on the air, WXOW's UHF signal was marginal at best in Eau Claire, primarily because its transmitter was located in Minnesota. As a result, Chippewa Valley viewers only got a decent signal from the station when cable arrived in the market in the mid-1970s. In order to solve this reception problem, WXOW severed the electronic umbilical cord with WKOW and signed on WQOW as a full-time satellite on September 22, 1980, two years after the station was sold to Liberty Television. Tak Communications purchased Liberty Television's Wisconsin-based stations in 1985. In 1991, Tak filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; it would be taken over by a group of creditors less than three years later. This resulted in the sale of Tak's Wisconsin stations to Shockley Communications in 1995. WXOW and WQOW began operating a cable-only affiliate of The WB in 1998 known as \"WBCZ\".Chippewa.com This was seen through a simulcast on channel 15 on most cable systems in La Crosse and Eau Claire. In June 2001, Quincy Newspapers (later Quincy Media) announced that it would acquire Shockley Communications. In September 2002, WXOW became the first La Crosse area television station to broadcast in digital on UHF channel 14.Wxow.com WXOW and WQOW replaced \"WBCZ\" with new second digital subchannels (simulcasting The CW) when the new network launched in the fall of 2006. After The CW Plus national feed was upgraded to 720p high-definition level in fall 2012, an HD feed became available on Charter digital channel 610. Up until August 2018, there were two different signals from the same tower at WXOW's studios carrying The CW as a digital translator of sister station KTTC also carried a CW subchannel in high definition. WXOW began airing solely in digital, effective February 17, 2009, with the analog transmitter operating for sixty additional days broadcasting as part of a \"nightlight\" service with local news and information about the digital transition.Tomahjournal.com On June 11, 2009, WXOW moved from its initial digital channel assignment to channel 48 at a higher broadcasting power. WXOW and WQOW launched This TV (simulcast on new third digital subchannels of the stations) in February\u2013March 2010.AVSforum.comAVSforum.com WXOW had a construction permit to air a digital fill-in translator covering Tomah, Wisconsin. Airing on UHF channel 28, this low-powered signal would have had a transmitter on Echo Road in western unincorporated Monroe County. The permit was later cancelled on June 6, 2013.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=41540 ==Digital channels== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The station is also a part of the Green Bay Packers and WIAA sports networks; the former allows WXOW to carry Packers preseason games and official team programming, and to brand itself as \"Your Official Packers Station\" for the La Crosse market. ==Newscasts== With the launch of WQOW, WXOW began to simulcast its newscasts on that station. In 1982, WQOW established a separate news operation with local newscasts focusing on Eau Claire and the surrounding areas. Since it did not operate an in-house weather department of its own, all segments originated from WXOW's studios in a tape- delayed arrangement. The effort was cancelled in March 1990 as a cost-cutting measure and, as a result, WQOW once again began simulcasting WXOW's newscasts. It would not be until October 1996 when WQOW would relaunch its own local news operation for a second time which remains to this day. Although this incarnation of news production includes a separate weather department from WXOW, meteorologists from that station can fill-in on WQOW (this is the case especially on weekends). In September 2011, WXOW became the second television station in the market to perform an upgrade to high definition newscast production. Included in the change was a new studio and updated graphics package. The news department at WQOW was upgraded to HD level at the same time. ==References== *Madison group buys WXOW-TV (1995) ==External links== *WXOW *WXOW mobile *WXOW-DT2 \"La Crosse-Eau Claire CW+\" * Category:Television channels and stations established in 1970 Category:1970 establishments in Wisconsin XOW Category:Quincy Media Category:ABC network affiliates Category:Decades (TV network) affiliates Category:Court TV affiliates Category:True Crime Network affiliates ",
