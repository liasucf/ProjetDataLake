Confucius thought highly of his excellent moral conduct, and considered him fit to be the ruler of a state. After completing school, he served as chief officer of Jisun, the noble clan that dominated the politics of Lu. Ran Yong was a native of the State of Lu. He was 29 years younger than Confucius, and was from the same clan as Ran Geng and Ran Qiu, two other prominent disciples of Confucius. He was of the same age as Ran Qiu. He was known for his moral integrity, despite being born to a father of lowly status, and Confucius declared that his background would not detract from his excellence. He was said to be not an eloquent speaker. In Confucian temples, Ran Yong's spirit tablet is placed the second among the Twelve Wise Ones, on the east. Ran Yong's offspring held the title of Wujing Boshi (\u4e94\u7d93\u535a\u58eb; W\u01d4j\u012bng B\u00f3sh\u00ec). ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * * * * Category:522 BC births Category:Disciples of Confucius Category:6th-century BC philosophers Category:Philosophers from Lu (state) Category:Year of death unknown Category:5th-century BC philosophers Category:6th-century BC Chinese people Category:5th-century BC Chinese people ",
