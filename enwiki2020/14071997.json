    "text": "B-cell lymphoma 6 protein is a protein that in humans is encoded by the BCL6 gene. Like BCL2, BCL3, BCL5, BCL7A, BCL9 and BCL10, it has clinical significance in lymphoma. == Function == The protein encoded by this gene is an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger transcription factor and contains an N-terminal POZ/BTB domain. This protein acts as a sequence-specific repressor of transcription and has been shown to modulate the STAT-dependent Interleukin 4 (IL-4) responses of B cells. This protein can interact with several corepressor complexes to inhibit transcription. This gene is found to be frequently translocated and hypermutated in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and contributes to the pathogenesis of DLBCL. An exon 7 skipping splice variant encodes a shorter form of the protein which lacks the first two zinc fingers of the DNA binding domain. Physiologically, BCL6 is a master transcription factor which leads the differentiation of naive helper T cells in Follicular Helper T cells (TFH cells). Its action is negatively regulated by the gene PRDM1 encoding the transcription factor Blimp-1. ==Diagnostic utility== The presence of BCL6 can be demonstrated in tissue sections using immunohistochemistry. It is exclusively present in the B-cells of both healthy and neoplastic germinal centres. It therefore demonstrates both reactive hyperplasia in lymph nodes and a range of lymphomas derived from follicular B-cells, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, follicular lymphoma and the nodular lymphocyte predominant subtype of Hodgkin's disease. It is often used together with antibodies to Bcl-2 antigen to distinguish neoplastic follicles from those found in benign hyperplasia, for which Bcl-2 is negative. == Interactions == BCL6 has been shown to interact with * BCOR, * C-jun, * HDAC1, * HDAC4, * HDAC7A, * HDAC5, * IRF4, * NCOR2, * SMRT, * ZBTB7A * T-bet, * ZBTB16 == See also == * Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphoma * Diffuse large B cell lymphoma == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * == External links == * * Category:Transcription factors ",
