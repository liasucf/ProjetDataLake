    "text": "Porthtowan (, meaning cove of sand dunes) is a small village in Cornwall, England which is a popular summer tourist destination. Porthtowan is on Cornwall's north Atlantic coast about west of St Agnes, north of Redruth, west of Truro and southwest of Newquay in the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape, a World Heritage Site. Porthtowan is popular with surfers and industrial archaeologists; former mine stacks and engine houses dot the landscape. ==Geography== Porthtowan lies along the Godrevy Head to St Agnes heritage coast, which is located on the north Cornwall coast of the Celtic Sea in the Atlantic Ocean. It lies between Godrevy Head (with the Godrevy Towans) and St Agnes Head, north of the village of St Agnes.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End St Agnes Heritage Coast. British Express. Retrieved 18 September 2012. The Godrevy to St Agnes Heritage Coast has been a nationally designated protected area since 1986. The marine site protects 40 species of mammals and amphibians.St Agnes Heritage Coast. Protected Planet. Retrieved 18 September 2012.Species Protected Planet: St Agnes Heritage Coast. Retrieved 18 September 2012. Porthtowan is within walking distance of National Trust coastal and cliff-side walks. Between Porthtowan and Agnes Head is one of Cornwall's \"largest remaining heathland[s].\" Ironically, the heath survived \u2013 and was not turned into arable land \u2013 because of the soil contamination of previous mining activities. Few plants or species other than heathers and spiders can thrive in the area's environmental condition.Look out St Agnes to Carn Gowla Walk. National Trust. Retrieved 28 September 2012. ==Toponymy== Its name comes from the Cornish words \"porth\" and \"tewynn\" to mean landing place at the sand dunes.Porthtowan, Banns Vale, Mount Hawke and Chapel Porth. St Agnes Forum. Retrieved 28 September 2012. ==History== Porthtowan's history is associated with mining and one of its most prominent buildings is a former engine house converted for residential use. Allen's Corn Mill operated at Porthtowan between 1752 and 1816.Allen's Mill. English Heritage National Monuments. Retrieved 21 September 2012. Porthtowan owes much of its present- day character to its popularity as a local seaside resort in Victorian and Edwardian times when the local populace from Redruth and the surrounding areas went there, particularly on Bank Holidays. ==Mining== Coastal settlements in Cornwall between Perranporth and Porthtowan had copper, lead, iron, tin and zinc mines. Porthtowan mines mainly produced copper.Simon Camm. Cornish Rocks and Minerals. Alison Hodge Publishers; March 2010 [cited 29 September 2012]. . p. 50. ===South Wheal Towan=== The South Wheal Towan copper mine also operated in the area. Still visible is its Echo Corner mine stack. The mine had a slide lode that intersected with the main lode, Hamptons and Downright lode. In addition to copper pyrites, brown iron ore was also found in the mine.James Bastian Hill; Donald Alexander MacAlister; Sir John Smith Flett.

Stationery Off., by Wyman & Sons; 1908 [cited 29 September 2012]. p. 241. ===Tywarnhayle Mine=== The Tywarnhayle mine was opened in 1826 as United Hills Mine but the name was changed in 1848 to Tywarnhayle Mine. It was an important source of copper ore until about 1860.Barton, D. Bradford (1965) A Guide to the Mines of West Cornwall; 2nd ed. Truro: D. Bradford Barton; p. 43 Its engine house, Taylors Shaft, is visible in the hills surrounding the coastal village. The mine was located about 1 kilometre southeast of Porthtowan. It was the United Hills Mine on 3 February 1830 when an engine boiler exploded and killed nine people. In 1906 money was invested to drain and work the Tywarnhayle mine. Water was piped out by Cornwall's first electrical centrifugal pumps, made by Worthington Simpson, at the rate of 1,000 gallons per minute. The amount of copper ore mined between 1826 and 1906 was 86,800 tons.Barton, D. Bradford (1965) A Guide to the Mines of West Cornwall; 2nd ed. Truro: D. Bradford Barton; p. 47 File:Tywarnhayle mine, near Porthtowan - geograph.org.uk - 73824.jpg|Tywarnhayle mine.

Tywarnhayle was one of the four stannaries. There were three others: Blackmore, Foweymore and, lastly, Kerrier and Penwith. The Stannaries managed mining law, taxation, court proceedings and jails. ===Wheal Coates=== The mine is renowned for its pseudomorphs, in this case tin oxide, or cassiterite, that takes on the shape of the feldspar crystals that it replaces within granite.

It operated primarily from 1826 to 1862. ===Wheal Lushington=== Wheal Lushington, also known as the New Wheal Towan, was a copper mine located on a hill overlooking the beach. The engine house that was built in 1872 was never used as an engine house and has since been converted for other uses.Barry Gamble. Cornish Mines: Gwennap to the Tamar.

In 1772, women and girls worked at the mines, earning 4 to 6 d per day.Lynne Mayers. Balmaidens. Hypatia Publications; 1 June 2004 [cited 29 September 2012]. . p. 27. In 1809 Wheal Towan had a cobbing shed which was a building used to break the ore up with a pointed hammer weighing up to 4 pounds. Teenage girls (bal maidens) sat on low benches and broke the ore to remove the rock and break the ore into small pieces. It was a loud and difficult task, but not as difficult as bucking which came next; this required the ore to be broken down into a powder or granules with a flat-ended cast iron hammer.Lynne Mayers. Balmaidens. Hypatia Publications; 1 June 2004 [cited 29 September 2012]. . pp. 64, 63\u201365. Some time before 1826 the mine resulted in \u00a3130,000 profit, having been mined to a depth of 150 fathoms. It was then closed until 1826. Two 80-inch cylinder steam engines called Wilson's engine from the engineer Samuel Grose (1791\u20131866) were used in 1826 to drain the mine. The monthly output between January 1827 and March 1828 from the engine ranged from 48.9 to 84.2 million 94 pound bushels.Samuel Lewis.

It was also known as West Wheal Towan (1850\u20131867), Lelant Wheal Towan and West Wheal Lucy (1872). During the period he owned it, the mine provided Ralph Allen Daniell of Trelissick with a fortune estimated at the time as a \"guinea a minute\". The first underground steam engine was built in Wheal Towan in 1785. It was reopened in 1872 as West Wheal Lucy and abandoned soon after. The only remains on the surface are burrows created from the mine's operations. The burrows head in the direction of Towan Cross.D. B. Barton. A Guide to the Mines of West Cornwall; 2nd ed. Truro: D.
