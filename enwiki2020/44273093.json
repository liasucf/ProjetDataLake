    "text": "Collide is the twelfth studio album by American R&B; group Boyz II Men. The album was released on October 21, 2014, by MSM Music Group. ==Critical reception== Andy Kellman of AllMusic said, \"This is easily the group's most scattered album, as it offers various shades of ballads, some throwbacks, oddly escapist adult alternative fare, and even anthemic rockers. Many of them blur the line between fresh changes of pace and ill-suited switch-ups. \"Already Gone,\" one that falls toward the latter, is schizophrenic itself, as it bounds between early-'80s arena rock and EDM. It's also one of many songs in which Auto-Tune is used -- easily the album's most baffling characteristic.\" ==Track listing== * Credits adapted from liner notes.Boyz II Men - Collide (Target Deluxe Edition).
