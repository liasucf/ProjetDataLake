    "text": "The 2010\u201311 Football Conference season was the seventh season with the Conference consisting of three divisions and the thirty-second season overall. The Conference covers the top two levels of Non-League football in England. The Conference Premier is the fifth highest level of the overall pyramid, whilst the Conference North and Conference South exist at the sixth level. The top team and the winner of the play-off of the National division were promoted to Football League Two, while the bottom four were relegated to the North or South divisions. The champions of the North and South divisions were promoted to the National division, alongside the play-off winners from each division. The bottom three in each of the North and South divisions were relegated to the premier divisions of the Northern Premier League, Isthmian League or Southern League. For sponsorship reasons, the Conference Premier is referred to as the Blue Square Bet Premier. ==Conference Premier== A total of 24 teams will contest the division, including 18 sides from last season, two relegated from the Football League Two, two promoted from the Conference North and two promoted from the Conference South. ===Promotion and relegation=== Teams promoted from 2009\u201310 Conference North * Southport * Fleetwood Town Teams promoted from 2009\u201310 Conference South * Newport County * Bath City Teams relegated from 2009\u201310 League Two * Darlington * Grimsby Town ===League table=== ===Play-offs=== ====Semifinals==== AFC Wimbledon won 8\u20131 on aggregate.
