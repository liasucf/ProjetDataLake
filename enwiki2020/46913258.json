    "text": "Alfred Thieme (1830 \u2013 1906) was a German industrialist and art collector from Leipzig. What little is known of his life was published in his art catalog, which was written by his son, the art historian Ulrich (known for Thieme- Becker) and the art historian Wilhelm von Bode. It was illustrated with engravings of artworks by Albert Kr\u00fcger. He donated much of his collection, also known as the Thiemeschen Sammlung, to the Museum der bildenden K\u00fcnste. Thieme was also the father of Georg Thieme who founded a medical publishing business, today Thieme Medical Publishers. ==Art collection== File:Frans Hals - Mulatto (so-called) - WGA11099.jpg|The Mulatto, by Frans Hals File:Pieter de Hooch - Company Making Music - WGA11711.jpg|Musical Party in a Hall, by Pieter de Hooch ==References== * Galerie Alfred Thieme in Leipzig, with an introduction by Wilhelm Bode, republished by Ulrich Thieme, Leipzig, 1900 ==External links== * Category:1830 births Category:1906 deaths Category:People from Leipzig Category:German art collectors Category:19th-century art collectors Category:20th-century art collectors Category:German industrialists Category:19th-century German businesspeople Category:20th-century German businesspeople ",
