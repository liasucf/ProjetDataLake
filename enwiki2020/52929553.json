After the Catholic Church refused its publication it was eventually published in 1827 under the auspices of the British and Foreign Bible Society, who had been lobbied to support Le Gonidec by the champion of Welsh language publications, Thomas Price (known as \"Carnhuanawc\"). The resulting \"Protestant\" translation was placed on the Index of Banned Books by the Catholic Church. The Old Testament of Le Gonideg was edited after his death by Editions Prud'hommes (Saint-Brieuc), printer of the Diocese of Saint-Brieuc, in 1866. A contemporary translation of the Old Testament is Testamant Kozh, 5 volumes, translated from Hebrew into Breton by Pierre Le Gall and Job Lec'hvien.
