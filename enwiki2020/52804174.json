Initially, police officers responded to a 911 call made by a neighbor of Garcia about him threatening the neighbor and his co-worker with the rifle. When they discovered Garcia in the backyard, he began shouting at the officers, which caused them to take a defensive position. After this, he barricaded himself inside the house and a perimeter was set up by police with SWAT being activated to assist in negotiating Garcia into surrendering. Walker and another patrol officer set up a position on an intersection between Waterview Drive and Turtle Cove Drive, the latter being the location where Garcia barricaded himself. He then radioed Little Elm Police Chief, Rodney Harrison, to report that a bullet was fired somewhere on the intersection from 50 yards away. Harrison asked Walker to confirm the origin of the gunshot and the latter replied that he and the patrol officer were being fired upon. Just moments later, Harrison stated that a \"hail of gunfire came from inside the residence in the direction of Detective Walker and our patrol officer,\" Two other officers shot back at Garcia, which led to the gunfire lasting for a total of about one minute. Walker was flown to the Denton Regional Medical Center, where he succumbed to his injuries. Deputies from the Denton County Sheriff's Office and police officers from the Frisco Police Department were dispatched to back up the other officers. An elderly woman that was also in the residence with Garcia was rescued by being escorted from the rear sides of the home. Police believe that the woman is the grandmother of Garcia.

The standoff lasted for a total of 6 hours. |- |2017-01-16 || Doudzai, Mohammad Azim (32) || Virginia (Herndon) || Police say Doudzai wounded two men with gunshots before setting a fire in the home and barricading himself inside with a hostage.
