He was first identified as a suspect in the disappearance of a fellow university student in October 2019. On October 30th, after searching his home in Villa Santin, Toluca, State of Mexico, officers found the strangled bodies of three women, two of them buried in the backyard and one hidden in the bathroom. Guzm\u00e1n went on the run, but was arrested over a month later on December 6th. After his capture he admitted to killing not only the three women, but also three other people: a girl and her father in 2012, in Otzolotepec, as well as his own father in 2006, when he was just 16 years old. He is currently awaiting trial for the murders. == Background == Little is known about \u00d3scar's early life before his crimes, but there have been suspicions that his father was physically abusive to his mother and him.Although Guzm\u00e1n would declare that he was attracted to the idea of killing in his youth, paradoxically, unlike many other serial killers, he also showed a great interest and attachment to animals. At the time of his capture, he had two dogs and a cat as pets, for which he showed great concern during his time in jail. According to Dr. Feggy Ostrosky, his inclination for animals could be because of pathological narcissism, where he sees himself as a \"protector\", by taking care of animals he can exercise this role without any resistance from his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. She considers him a psychopath and narcissist, who is eager for attention. Among his hobbies were krav maga, which he actively practised for at least four years, death metal, satanism and stories about serial killers, whom he admired for their \"intelligence\". Although he had lived alone for years, \u00d3scar was economically dependent on her mother, and neighbors described him as a quiet man who never spoke to anyone and always dressed in black. At the time of his capture, he was studying psychology at a local university. == Murders == === Initial killings === \u00d3scar's first victim was his own father, whom he murdered at 16 years of age in 2006. During a phone call with his mother from prison made in January 2020, he confessed to the crime. Later on, he formally admitted his guilt. The circumstances surrounding his father's death have not been disclosed, but the prosecution has confirmed that Guzm\u00e1n was responsible. His next victims were a woman identified only as \"M\u00f3nica\" and her father. Guzm\u00e1n first encountered her on September 10, 2012, at a high school in Otzolotepec, quickly becoming enfatuated with and stalking her. At one point, he went to her house and decided to search through, unaware that the girl's father, identified only as \"Tom\u00e1s\", was there. After being discovered by the latter, \u00d3scar decided to kill him, stabbing the man repeatedly and later finishing him off with an axe. He then sat down and waited for M\u00f3nica to return, with the deceased Tom\u00e1s' remains still in the house. When she arrived, Guzm\u00e1n subdued her using his skills in krav maga and took her to his house in Villa Santin, where he kept the girl alive for two weeks, repeatedly sexually assaulting and torturing her, before ending her life by beating her to death two days before her birthday. He then dismembered the body, put the remains in cardboard boxes and threw then in a ravine in El Mirador, Mexico City. === Fourth and fifth murders === Guzm\u00e1n's next victim was Adriana Gonz\u00e1lez Hern\u00e1ndez, a 27-year-old psychology student at the Insurgentes University of Toluca, who disappeared on March 24, 2017, after leaving her home in El Ranchito neighborhood in Toluca. According to relatives of hers, a few days before her disappearance, Adriana presented \u00d3scar as her \"boyfriend\" at a family gathering. He later confessed to activist Frida Guerrera Villalzavo that he kept Adriana alive until February 2018. The fifth victimw as Martha Patricia \"Patty\" Nava Sotelo, 25, a criminology and law student who disappeared on February 9, 2019 in Huixquilucan. Months before she vanished, Patty expressed concerns to her family that somebody was following her, in particular, of a black truck whose driver kept driving after her. It is known that \u00d3scar knew the Nava family, as the mother was his neighbor. After her disappearance, the last place where Patty's cell phone reception was detected was near the Villa Santin house. She was held captive under the effects of Rivotril (a brand of clonazepam) for several days until her death later that month. === Last murder === The last victim was 23-year-old J\u00e9ssica Guadalupe Orihuela, a fellow psychology student studying in the same university as Guzm\u00e1n, who disappeared on October 24, 2019, after leaving her home in Colonia 5 de Mayo. \u00d3scar had started harassing her months before her abduction. When she vanished, J\u00e9ssica's family suspected that it none other than Guzm\u00e1n himself: they came to his house on several occasions, but he repeatedly denied having seen her and ended up threatening them to \"stop bothering him.\" Far from that, several family members stood outside the house for four days between October 26th and 30th. Legally, the police couldn't enter the premises without a court order, which took several days to arrive, despite the fact that the relatives claimed to have seen J\u00e9ssica through the house windows. On October 30th, the order finally came. The police entered the house, but by then, Guzm\u00e1n had fled. While examining the household, they found J\u00e9ssica's strangled body in the bathroom. She had reportedly been killed hours prior to discovery. == References == Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Mexican criminals Category:Male serial killers Category:Mexican serial killers Category:Patricides Category:People from the State of Mexico ",
