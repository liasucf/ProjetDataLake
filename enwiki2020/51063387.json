Fox wrote a strongly worded letter back to Monro, objecting to him \"claim[ing] for the Speaker the right of recommending this or any other appointment independently of the Responsible Ministers\". Fox went on to state that Friend's workload meant that he could not at that time be released from his position as accountant for the Land Purchase Department and \"some considerable time will probably elapse before Mr Friend's services can be dispensed with, should the Government then, in reference to other considerations, be prepared to acquiesce in your recommendation\".Appendix to the Journals to the House of Representatives, 1862 Session 1, D-19 Friend's appointment as Clerk-Assistant was eventually gazetted on 7 October 1864.NZ Gazette, 7 October 1864, page 384NZ Herald, 8 October 1864, page 5New Zealander, 8 October 1864, page 4 The effective date of Friend's appointment as Clerk-Assistant is unclear (he may have been acting in this role for a short period before his official appointment).

Everyone who is familiar with the House and its work will at once designate Mr. George Friend, the present Clerk Assistant, as the proper man to receive the promotion. Mr. Friend is a very old servant of the House, and has had charge of all its work in Committee of the Whole for upwards of a quarter of a century, occasionally also relieving Major Campbell in the chair at the table.
