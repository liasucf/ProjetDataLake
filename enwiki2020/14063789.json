The station was most recently a sports talk format known as \"JOCK 98.7 ESPN.\" This format moved to 98.7 FM's sister stations KBFL (AM) and KBFL-FM (1060 AM/96.9 FM/99.9 FM) on July 30, 2020 as part of the purchase of the Meyer Communications owned stations (which also includes KWTO (AM) and KWTO- FM) by Zimmer Midwest Communications. ==History== KWTO-FM went on the air on November 23, 1967; it later adopted a rock format and was known as \"Rock 99\". This format lasted well into the 1980s until rival station KXUS went on the air in April 1985 with a similar format. Rock 99 was originally an automated music format utilizing the TM Stereo Rock format based from Dallas, TX. Several FM radio stations used this format during the 1970s into the 1980s. These stations had the same announcer and same call letter type music jingles. One example, WIBW-FM 97.3 in Topeka, KS was Rock 97 and sounded just like KWTO-FM Rock 99. That was a great automated music format without the talkative DJ's, it was rock, pop, oldies, and some album cuts. The on-air format basically went like this: Two new songs followed by two older songs then commercial break (usually four commercials) then call letter jingle and back to the music. In March 1987, the station adopted a more Top-40 format and became \"99 Hit FM\". The call letters were changed to KKHT in 1990,Call Sign History, fcc.gov.

In 2001, the station adopted an all-sports format and became known as \"The JOCK, 98.7 FM\".
