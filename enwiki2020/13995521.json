Started Racing: Early August 1977 at 13 years of age. His friend took him to a local track in Lakeside, California. He didn't have his own race bike, so he raced his friends. He got his own bike for his 14th birthday on September 8, 1977.BMX Plus! October 1986 Vol.9 No.10 pg.46 Sanctioning Body: () First race result: Third place.

First Professional race result: Third in Pro class at the World Wide BMX Association (WWBMXA) Supernationals on June 6, 1982 in Rancho San Diego, California.BMX Plus! September 1982 Vol.5 No.9 pg.24 The WWBMXA didn't have a two tier Senior/Junior pro class like the NBL or the ABA. As a result he raced at least two Senior pros; Harry Leary, who won the event, and Clint Miller who came in second. However, Texas was still considered a junior pro in the ABA and the NBL and raced that class at those events. First Professional win: In \"A\" Pro at the American Bicycle Association (ABA) Supernationals in Lake Elsinore, California on January 23, 1983. He won US$450,BMX Plus!

January 1983 Vol.6 No.1 pg.31 (results) Technically speaking it could be said his first junior pro race result was at the WWBMXA Supernationals in June 1982 but the WWBMXA did not have a two tier pro system unlike the NBL and the ABA. At least two top level senior pro racers raced in Texas's class but the majority of the racers in that class were junior pros.

At any given time a racer could have numerous ever changing co-sponsors. Primary sponsorships can be verified by BMX press coverage and sponsor's advertisements at the time in question. When possible exact dates are used. ====Amateur==== *Bicycles N' Stuff: 1979. *Hidden Valley Schwinn: 1979-1980 *Cal Bike: 1980-Early 1982 ====Professional==== *O'Neal: 1982-May 1983 *Gruenert Design Racing: May 1983-September 1, 1983 *Pro Neck: September 1, 1983-December 1984.

Texas would be unsponsored for almost the entire summer of 1985 after Bassett went out of business. *CW (Custom Works) Racing: October 1985-September 21, 1986. Texas was dropped from CW Racing after the weekend of the ABA Freedomnationls. According to BMX Plus!, CW claimed that Texas's racing was not up to par. Note: at the time there was no written contract between Texas and CW Racing.BMX Plus! January 1987 Vol.10 No.1 pg.68 BMX Action reported that Shawn Texas received a letter from CW telling him that among the reasons he was let go was that he didn't wear his cosponsor's goggles and Texas was dissatisfied with CW's products. Texas confirmed the letter but contested the reasons: > \"I didn't wear my goggles in Oregon because I didn't have any. I wore them > on tour after Roger (Worsham) said something about it...Man, I did > everything he ever told me to do!\" :He continued: > \"I was NEVER dissatisfied with their products. I told Rog that I'd like a > frame with a little bit steeper head tube, and he said, 'fine.' Everything > was cool. I wanted them to make my own frame with my signature on it because > they could sell a bunch of 'em and I'd get my name on something. But Rog > says he doesn't want to put anybody's name on products after what happened > with Pete (Loncarevich). I said, 'fine.' Next thing I know... I got this > letter in the mail telling me I was off the team!\"---BMX Action February > 1987BMX Action February 1987 Vol.12 No.2 pg.18 :After CW, with an exception of a brief sponsorship with MBK in France, Texas did not have a sponsor for an extended period of time before he was picked up by Eagle Snacks. In the meantime he had listed \"Team Jesus\" as his \"sponsor\".BMX Plus! April 1987 Vol.10 No.4 pg.59 (Example in AA pro results) Like fellow pro racers Eric Rupe and Mike Miranda, Shawn Texas is a born again Christian. Side Note: \"CW\" never stood for \"Coast Wheels\" as it is widely thought. Coast Wheels was a bike shop that Roger Worsham owned. Custom Works was a completely different and independent company.History of CW page This is in contrast with JMC (Jim Melton Cyclery) which did start out as a bicycle shop and then began manufacturing its own BMX components including entire bicycles. *Motobecane (MBK): November 22\u201323, 1986. This was a one weekend sponsorship in France for the Bicross/Yop King of Bercy championship race in Bercy, France. It was not a permanent position nor was it meant to be.BMX Action April 1987 Vol.12 No.4 pg.13 *Eagle Snacks: February 21, 1987Super BMX & Freestyle June 1987 Vol.14 No.6 pg.14-December 1987.

The parting was on mutual good terms. Texas was unsponsored for five months after he left Eagle Snacks. *White Bear: May 1988-March 1989 *Boss Racing Products July 1989-August 1989 Texas was briefly on Boss after leaving White Bear.BMX Plus!

Beginning with the 1996 season the IBMXF and FIAC completed the merger and both ceased to exist as independent entities being integrated into the UCI. Beginning with the 1997 World Championships held in Brighton, England the UCI would officially hold and sanction BMX World Championships and with it inherited all precedents, records, streaks, etc. from both the IBMXF and FIAC. Pro Invitationals and Series Championships *1984 Tijauna BMX Cup Championship Pro Champion\u2020 \u2020The Tijuana BMX Cup was a special promotional race that was held in Tijuana, Mexico. The race was heavily promoted by both individual promoters and the State Secretary of Tourism of Baja California. It featured a track designed by pro racer Eddy King. The raced was sanctioned by the International Cycling Organization (ICO) and the BMX Association (BMXA). The BMXA was an old but small and local BMX sanctioning body headquartered in San Diego, California. Both the ABA and the NBL had declined to sanction the event. Despite heavy promotion the event was poorly attended including by most top name pros. Shawn Texas, Eddy King, Donny Atherton, Rod Beckering, Toby Henderson and Denny Davidow were the only recognizable names to race in the pro classes.BMX Plus! September 1984 Vol.7 No.9 pg.58 *1986 Orange YMCA BMX Pro Series Champion The YMCA BMX Pro Series Championship was a private four race pro series held at the Orange YMCA BMX race track in Orange, California on four consecutive Wednesdays in February and March 1986. It was sponsored by MRC, Mike Redman Concepts. It was highly successful and well attended by many top ranked pros despite the relatively low prize purse of US$150 ($281.52 in 2007 Cost of Living Calculator) plus 100 percent payback with a US$200 (US$375.36 2007) bonus for the top three series finishers. It did however, have an unusually low entrance fee of $10 ($18.77 2007) for the pros per race.BMX Plus!

He went over a berm at high speed.ABA Action March 1983 Vol.7 No.2 pg.29 ===Racing habits and traits=== ===Miscellaneous=== *Shawn Texas received a one-month suspension from racing at the 1984 NBL Las Vegas, Nevada National after he deliberately collided with Frank Post after getting squeezed off the track at a step jump in the second straight. Texas, feeling that the action was deliberate on Post's part, cut across the infield and rammed Post perpendicular to him (called a \"T-Bone\" or \"center punch\") in the second turn. Mutual shouting and pushing ensued. The NBL track officials ruled that Frank Post would be disqualified for the day, receiving no money or points for that day for fighting physically with Texas (it is illegal to fight even in retaliation). The same for Texas in addition to the one-month suspension for instigating the altercation.BMX Action September 1984 Vol. 9 No. 9 pg. 53 & 55 According to BMX Plus! Frank Post admitted that he moved over on Texas in the second turn deliberately so he would have to worry about Texas diving in on the inside and up into Post, cutting him off as they went into turn three.BMX Plus! September 1984 Vol. 7 No. 9 pg. 55 *Shawn Texas received a suspension from racing for punching fellow racer Rick Palmer after a collision at the ABA's Gilley's Nationals on March 7, 1987 day 1. Rick Palmer tried to pass Texas in the second turn but was unsuccessful and both went down after Palmer collided with Texas. Texas was in third at the time in the third and final run of the \"AA\" pro mains and would have most likely won the entire event if he held his third position. In anger he punched Palmer in the chin who retaliated with a punch to Texas's lip. Clayton John, President of the ABA, suspended them both for one day, preventing them from racing the second day of the Gilley's National on Sunday.American BMXer April 1987 Vol. 9 No. 3 pg. 33 This incident and previous incidents of fighting in the pro ranks caused the ABA to initiate new rules. The first incident of fighting results in a one-day suspension and a warning, the second a four-month suspension automatically. ==Post BMX career== ==BMX press magazine interviews and articles== *\"Shawn Texas\" BMX Plus!
