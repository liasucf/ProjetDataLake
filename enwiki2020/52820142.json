Review in Booklist v. 97, iss. 14, Mar. 15, 2001, p. 1361. Jackie Cassada, writing in Library Journal, wrote that the collection \"highlight[s] the year's best contributions to the genre\" and calls it \"[a] good addition to most libraries' sf collections,\" singling out Chiang's, Turzillo's and Butler's pieces for particular comment.Cassada, Jackie. Review in Library Journal v. 126, iss. 7, Apr. 15, 2001, p. 137. Kirkus Reviews noted that \"[t]he award-winning stories all appear,\" highlighting \"worthy runners-up David Marusek and Michael Swanwick\" and Grand Master Brian Aldiss's \"typically clever, chilling story.\" But \"[o]n the downside,\" the reviewer scores \"the reluctance of SF/fantasy to examine itself,\" giving as examples the introduction, in which Silverberg \"burbles gently,\" and Wolfe's handling of \"the year's roundup ...; not surprisingly, he has nothing cogent to say,\" and decries the fact that, \"despite the passing of such luminaries as A. E. van Vogt, Marion Zimmer Bradley, James White, and Stanley Kubrick, no obituaries appear.\" The review also takes to task Author Emeritus Daniel Keyes's description of \"the genesis of his extraordinary and moving story 'Flowers for Algernon'; perusing this piece, readers will also understand why he never wrote anything else of real consequence.\" In summation, \"[t]he quality of the fiction's not in dispute, but it's hard to justify that sky-high price tag for a short volume consisting mostly of reprints.\"Kirkus Reviews (review), Feb. 15, 2001. The collection was also reviewed by Gary K. Wolfe in Locus #484, May 2001. ==Notes== Nebula 35 Category:Robert Silverberg anthologies Category:2001 short story collections Category:Science fiction anthologies ",
