There were four wildfires in this series, which spanned the years of 1933\u20131951. By association, the name Tillamook Burn also refers to the location of these fires. This event is an important part of the local history of Oregon. ==First fire (1933)== The Tillamook burn photographed in 1941 The first fire started in a ravine at the headwaters of Gales Creek on August 14, 1933. The exact cause of the first fire is unknown; however, the common narrative states that as the crews were wrapping up operations early due to fire hazard restrictions, a steel cable dragging a fallen Douglas fir rubbed against the dry bark of a wind-fallen snag. The snag burst into flame, and the wildfire that grew out of this burned before it was extinguished by seasonal rains on September 5.Tillamook Burn reforested after three blazes. Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976. An oppressive, acrid smoke filled the neighboring valleys; ashes, and cinders, and the charred needles of trees fell in the streets of Tillamook; and debris from the fire reached ships at sea. A Civilian Conservation Corps member was the only known human casualty of fighting the fire. The loss in processed lumber was estimated to have been $442.4 million in contemporary (1933) dollars\u2014a serious loss not only to the timber industry at the time, but also to a nation struggling with the Great Depression. A massive salvage operation was immediately begun to harvest usable portions of the burned wilderness. The speed with which a forest fire can spread in heavy fuels under the most hazardous conditions is well illustrated by this fire. From August 14 at 1 p.m. until the early morning of August 24 the fire had burned about and it appeared that it might be brought under control soon. Thus, for over 10 days it had burned at an average rate of about a day. On August 24, the humidity dropped rapidly to 26 percent and hot gale force winds from the east sprang up. During the next 20 hours of August 24 and 25 the fire burned over an additional , or at a rate of per hour along a front. The fire was stopped only by the fact that the wind ceased and a thick, wet blanket of fog drifted in from the ocean. PROBLEMS OF FIRE IN NUCLEAR WARFARE Jerald E. Hill Rand Corporation Santa Monica, California 21 August 1961. pg 25 ==Second fire (1939)== The second fire was started in 1939, allegedly by another logging operation. It burned before being extinguished, and was contained within the bounds of the earlier fire. ==Third fire (1945)== A third fire started on the morning of July 9, 1945, near the Salmonberry River, and was joined two days later by a second blaze on the Wilson River, started by a discarded cigarette. This fire burned before it was put out. The cause of the blaze on the Salmonberry River was mysterious, and many believed it had been set by an incendiary balloon launched by the Japanese (due to the fire occurring in the waning days of World War II), which had been carried to Oregon by the jet stream. The third fire was perhaps the best known, after the initial wildfire, because it affected much of the forested mountains along the popular highways between Portland and the recreational destinations of the ocean beaches. This devastation remained visible to any traveler through the area as late as the mid-1970s. ==Fourth fire (1951)== The last fire started in 1951, and burned only . It was also confined within the burned-over area. == Salvage operations == Immediately after the first fire, new logging camps formed and existing ones expanded operations. At the time, access to the forest was limited and the railroad lines did not yet extend into the inner reaches of the forest. The town of Timber expanded during the time and became a prominent logging town along with the smaller town of Cochran to the west. Some of the logging companies near Glenwood joined their operations to form the Consolidated Timber Company. The lumber from these operations played an important part in providing wood resources to the United States during World War II. Throughout the subsequent years, miles of roads and railroad lines and were built through the forest to the various logging camps providing enhanced access. This made it easier for forestry restoration, maintenance, and fire prevention operations allowing them eventually to get a handle on the continued series of burns, however it had the secondary effect of creating new issues with erosion among a terrain known for landslides. ==Restoration== The repeated fires led some to think that large wildfires in the area were inevitable and that the land was now too damaged from the intense heat to ever again sustain forests.See Lucia, supra, at 65. But determined efforts by Oregonians -- private citizens, government officials, land owners and many others -- resulted in efforts to restore The Burn, beginning with hearings during World War II under Judge H. D. Kerkman of Washington County and eventually resulting in a decades-long reforestation program.See Lucia, supra, at 135 et seq. Much of the lands of the Tillamook burn had come to be owned by the counties of Tillamook, Yamhill, and Washington through foreclosures on unpaid property taxes; at the time of the forest fires, most of the land was owned by timber companies, which also paid the cost of fighting the fires. A measure was submitted by the Legislative Assembly to the voters to float a bond to finance reforestation, which narrowly passed in 1948. In a book published that same year, Stewart Holbrook wrote about the Tillamook Burn in Northwest Corner: Oregon and Washington: > [Reforestation] can never compensate for that tragedy we call the Tillamook > Burn, as somber a sight as to be viewed this side of the Styx.

Reforestation was performed simultaneously with research by the forest industry into the best methods of growing and planting the young trees (including how to protect them from the ravages of deer, beavers, mice and other wildlife). Young people from northwest Oregon helped with the hand- planting of seedlings. Between 1949 and 1972, they planted about a million seedlings, a massive number but still only about 1 percent of the total of 72 million seedlings replanted by all means. Everything from state prisoners to newly designed helicopters played a part in the reseeding program over the years.Lucia, supra, at 185 and 215. Eventually the forest began to return and in 1973, Oregon Governor Tom McCall dedicated the Tillamook Burn as the Tillamook State Forest. At the time the reforestation of the Tillamook Burn began, some assumed that the forest land would, when the trees were mature, be harvested for lumber. Current environmental beliefs have questioned this assumption, and both the proportions and specific parts of this land that will be logged or conserved for wildlife are in dispute. ==Pop culture== Folk singer Sufjan Stevens references the Tillamook Burn in his song 'Fourth of July' from his album Carrie and Lowell. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTeKpWp8Psw Poet and author Albert Drake titled a 1970s book of poems and essays, Tillamook Burn, from his experiences growing up in Oregon. ==Bibliography== *Ellis Lucia, Tillamook Burn Country: A Pictorial History (1984, Caxton Printers) (). *Gail Wells, The Tillamook (Oregon State University Press, 1999) *Stewart Holbrook and Henry Sheldon, Northwest Corner: Oregon and Washington: The Last Frontier (Doubleday & Company, Inc., Garden City, NY, 1948) ==References== ==External links== *Tillamook Forest Center Category:1930s wildfires Category:1933 fires Category:1933 in Oregon Category:1933 natural disasters in the United States Category:1939 fires Category:1939 in Oregon Category:1939 natural disasters in the United States Category:1940s wildfires Category:1945 fires Category:1945 in Oregon Category:1945 natural disasters in the United States Category:1950s wildfires Category:1951 fires Category:1951 in Oregon Category:1951 natural disasters in the United States Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in Oregon Category:Old-growth forests Category:Tillamook County, Oregon Category:Washington County, Oregon Category:Wildfires in Oregon Category:Yamhill County, Oregon ",
