At the same time, he and a few friends operated a small art academy. With the assistance of a lithographer named Francisco Ti\u00f3, he was able to move to Madrid in 1884, to study at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando with the landscape painter, Carlos de Haes, and make copies of Vel\u00e1zquez at the Museo del Prado.Biography @ Nomencl\u00e0tor. In 1887, he moved to Torroella de Montgr\u00ed and, two years later, settled on the Costa Brava, where he painted maritime scenes. In 1888, he received honorable mention at the Exposici\u00f3n Universal de Barcelona.

It was not until 1915 that, strongly urged by his friends, he held a small private exhibition at the . It was then that he reestablished contact with a childhood friend, Doctor , who became his patron. After that, he spent long periods at the Doctor's home in Sabadell, painting for a small group of local customers. He participated in a few exhibitions; notably in 1917 in Barcelona and 1920 in Begur. He created approximately 200 self-portraits, which bear little stylistic resemblance to his other works. He had a rough temperament, few friends and, despite some success, was usually mired in poverty. The writer, Josep Pla, described him as a \"primitive, marginal, anarchic being\" who painted by instinct.Josep Pla: Francesc Gimeno, pintor, el vell (1858-1927), pg. 95. In 2006, the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya organized an exhibit entitled \"Francesc Gimeno, un artista male\u00eft\" (A painter cursed/damned).Francesc Gimeno.
