    "text": "Thomas Balch (died c. 1774) was a Colonial minister in South Dedham, Massachusetts. He first took the pulpit in 1736. The Balch School was named for him in 1867 in Norwood, Massachusetts. A new school was built on the same site in 1913 and is also known as the Balch School. When Norwood separated from Dedham in 1872, Balch was a potential name for the community. His daughter, Mary, married Manasseh Cutler, and Cutler studied under the elder Balch for the ministry. Balch died 38 years after being ordained. ==References== Category:Clergy from Dedham, Massachusetts Category:People from Norwood, Massachusetts Category:American clergy Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing ",
