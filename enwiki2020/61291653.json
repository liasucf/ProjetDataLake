With his efforts, International Court of Justice (ICJ) awarded ownership of Preah Vihear Temple to Cambodia in 1962. From 1964 to 1969 he was the ambassador to China. In 1967, the Chinese embassy in Cambodia published and distributed Communist propaganda to the Cambodian populace praising the Cultural Revolution, which irritated Norodom Sihanouk. Sihanouk threatened to break off diplomatic relations with China. Truong Cang was about to leave Beijing, but finally was persuaded to stay in China by Chinese premier Zhou Enlai. From 1972 to 1973 he was the permanent representative to the United Nations. Truong Cang was regarded as a national hero by Khmer nationalists. In Phnom Penh, Oknya Truong Cang Road was named after him. ==References== Category:1913 births Category:Khmer Krom people Category:Cambodian politicians Category:Cambodian diplomats Category:Finance ministers of Cambodia Category:Foreign ministers of Cambodia Category:Ambassadors of Cambodia to China Category:Permanent Representatives of Cambodia to the United Nations Category:Possibly living people ",
