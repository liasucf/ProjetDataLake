She attended St Joseph's M\u0101ori Girls' College in Hawkes' Bay and joined the school choir there.

She also formed a band called the Phoenix Show Band and performed in cabaret shows. In 1974, Baker sang at the opening of the Commonwealth Games, held in Christchurch, New Zealand. The same year, Viking Records invited her and the St Joseph's choir to re-record their initial album, which was re-released in 1976 as Maori Love Songs. The album sold over 100,000 copies and both the choir and Baker were awarded Golden Discs. Viking also invited Baker to work on a recording New Zealand Maori Chorale.
