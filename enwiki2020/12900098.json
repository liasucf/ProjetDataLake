    "text": "The Clarence Greenwood Recordings is the third album by American recording artist Citizen Cope. It was released on September 14, 2004 via RCA Records. Originally, The Clarence Greenwood Recordings was scheduled to be released under Arista Records after he was pursued by the company where they bought out his contract with his former label, DreamWorks Records. Arista CEO L.A. Reid - who executive produced the album - left the label amid huge losses before it was released. The move made Citizen Cope an RCA signee when Arista was restructured in 2004. On August 30, 2019, the RIAA issued a Gold certification for The Clarence Greenwood Recordings fifteen years after its initial release. == Track listing == All the tracks were written and produced by Clarence Greenwood == Personnel == * Clarence Greenwood \u2013 main artist, producer, drum machine, fender rhodes, guitar, keyboards, programming, synthesizer bass, turntables * Rev.
