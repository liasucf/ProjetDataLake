    "text": "Jump 'n Bump is a 1998 freeware and open-source MS-DOS platform multiplayer video game by Brainchild Design. == Gameplay == Jump 'n Bump has no plot, other than that it involves up to four rabbits in multiplayer deathmatch: Dott, Jiffy, Fizz, and Mijji, trying to hop onto each other's heads to squish each other and score a point, while sending gibs flying everywhere. The rabbits are controlled by players on the same computer, using the keyboard, mouse, and/or joystick. == Development == Jump 'n Bump was written C and Assembly language by Brainchild Design in 1998. The graphics were made with Deluxe Paint 2 and Paint Shop Pro 5. The Mod music was made with Fast Tracker 2. Although the players' scores are tracked, the game continues indefinitely until it is ended by the players. In 1999 the game with its source code was released as Emailware.Jump 'n Bump readme.txt JUMP 'N BUMP by Brainchild Design in 1998 Jump 'n Bump is e-mailware.
