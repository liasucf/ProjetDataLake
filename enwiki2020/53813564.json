    "text": "Susanna and the Elders, Artemisia Gentileschi, Burghley House (England), 1622 Susanna and the Elders is a painting by the Italian artist Artemisia Gentileschi. The painting is signed with Gentileschi's name and the date of 1622. It is in the collection at Burghley House near Stamford, Lincolnshire, England. The painting has been listed as being in the Marquess of Exeter's family collection since at least the 1700s. It was listed in the 1763 Burghley inventory and was presumably acquired by Brownlow Cecil, 9th Earl of Exeter (1725 \u2013 1793) while on the Grand Tour. It is one of several paintings by Gentileschi depicting the story of Susanna from the Book of Daniel. Similar compositions of Susanna and the Elders are at Pommersfelden from 1610, at Brno dated 1649, and Bologna from 1652. A copy of the Burghley version is in the Nottingham Castle Museum collection. The painting was loaned to the Gentileschi exhibition that was to be held at the National Gallery in London in 2020, but was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. == References == Category:1610 paintings Category:Paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi Gentileschi ",
