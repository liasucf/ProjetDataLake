In 2010, officials from NAS Whiting Field announced plans to expand the runways for several NOLFs they operate (including NOLF Summerdale) to facilitate the use of the T-6 Texan II training aircraft, which is replacing the aging fleet of T-34 Mentors. Those plans have come under heavy opposition by some residents who are worried about losing homes and land in the process.Navy expansion plans worry some Baldwin County residents After NOLF Summerdale's flying activities were reduced for refurbishment, it officially \"reopened\" in March 2016 to resume more full-time training flights.Navy Outlying Field Summerdale Reopens ==References== ==External links== *Aerial photo as of 17 February 1997 from USGS The National Map Category:Airports in Baldwin County, Alabama Summerdale ",
