It is managed by Washington State Parks as the Spokane River Centennial State Park Trail. The trail extends from Sontag Park in Nine Mile Falls, Washington to the Washington/Idaho border. It passes through the cities of Spokane, Washington, Spokane Valley, Washington, Liberty Lake, Washington and the unincorporated community of Spokane Bridge, before crossing under the Interstate 90 Spokane River Bridge\u2014traveling through Kootenai County, Idaho for approximately \u2014and then continuing through Washington for about , before meeting with the North Idaho Centennial Trail at the Washington\u2013Idaho border. The trail is divided into three sections: Riverside refers to the section of the trail within Riverside State Park, Urban refers to the section within the city of Spokane, and Valley refers the section east of Spokane (almost all of which lies in the Spokane Valley, hence the name). After the border into Idaho, the trail continues as the North Idaho Centennial Trail. ==History== Centennial Trail near Gonzaga Following the Expo '74, advocates proposed a mixed use pathway along the river. Citizens in Washington and Idaho expanded the idea by 1986 by joining forces and suggesting a much longer trail that could be completed in time to celebrate the respective state centennials of Washington (1989) and Idaho (1990). In 2010, it was designated a National Recreation Trail. ==References== ==External links== *Spokane River Centennial State Park Trail Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission *Spokane River Centennial State Park Trail Brochure Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission *Friends of the Centennial Trail Category:State parks of Washington (state) Category:Parks in Spokane County, Washington Category:Transportation in Washington (state) Category:Hiking trails in Washington (state) Category:Transportation in Spokane County, Washington Category:Tourist attractions in Spokane County, Washington Category:National Recreation Trails in Washington (state) ",
