Born in Goomalling, a small Wheatbelt town, to Winifred Lilia (n\u00e9e Kenworthy) and Roland William Schell, Schell was educated in Perth, boarding at Wesley College. He subsequently returned to Goomalling to farm, initially with his family and later independently, and also became involved with what is now the Western Australian Farmers Federation. He obtained a pilot's licence in 1966, and for several years worked as a commercial pilot and flying instructor based at Jandakot Airport. A former state secretary of the Young Country Party, and a member of each of the various iterations of the National Party, Schell was third on the Nationals' ticket for the Senate at the 1984 federal election.WESTERN AUSTRALIA, 1984 legislative election: Senate. Psephos \u2013 Adam Carr's Election Archive. Retrieved 16 March 2015. He successfully contested Mount Marshall at the 1986 state election, winning the seat off a sitting Liberal member, Bill McNee, on a nine-point swing. However, prior to the 1989 election, Mount Marshall was abolished in a redistribution, with Schell instead contesting the neighbouring Liberal-held seat of Moore. Bill McNee was also contesting Moore, replacing the retiring Bert Crane as the Liberal candidate, and defeated Schell's bid for re-election. After losing his seat in parliament, Schell became the owner and manager of the Joondalup franchise of Jetset, a travel agency. ==References== Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Australian Anglicans Category:Australian aviators Category:Australian businesspeople Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Western Australia Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly Category:People educated at Wesley College, Perth Category:People from Goomalling, Western Australia Category:Commercial aviators ",
