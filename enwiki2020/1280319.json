It is headed by Korado Korlevi\u0107, a prolific astronomer and discoverer of minor planets. In 2009, the Vi\u0161njan observatory moved to Ti\u010dan (at ) and received the obs. code L01 on 5 October 2017 (). == Description == {| class=\"wikitable\" align=left style=\"font-size: 0.9em; width: 245px; margin: 0.2em 1.5em 0.5em 0;\" |+ Minor planets discovered: 108 |- | see |} Vi\u0161njan Observatory was founded in 1992, as a public observatory. It worked in the field of astrometry and search of a new asteroids. Increasing light pollution made the observations in Vi\u0161njan difficult, and they stopped in 2001. In 2009, a new building of the observatory was opened near the village of Ti\u010dan, approximately 2.5 kilometers away. According to the statistic on observatory's website (Vi\u0161njan and Ti\u010dan) as of 2016, a total of 1420 asteroids and 2 comets have been discovered at the observatory, which uses 11 telescopes and has a staff of 78 members and volunteers.http://www.astro.hr/#about The Minor Planet Center (MPC) directly credits the Vi\u0161njan Observatory with the discovery of 108 minor planets (see list below), while 1294 discoveries are credited to Korado Korlevi\u0107. (The observatory's statistic may also include unnumbered minor planets for which the MPC does not assign a discoverer.) The observatory is home of several summer programs for youth in astronomy, archeology, marine biology and other disciplines: Youth Science Camp, Summer School of Science and Vi\u0161njan School of Astronomy. == List of discovered minor planets == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 25em; margin-right: 1em; line- height: 1.65em !important; height: 675px; |- | 9429 Pore\u010d || 14 March 1996|| |- | 12123 Pazin || 18 July 1999|| |- | 12541 Makarska || 15 August 1998|| |- | 12581 Rovinj || 8 September 1999|| |- | || 11 September 1999|| |- | || 17 September 1999|| |- | || 29 September 1999|| |- | || 29 August 1998|| |- | || 25 August 1998|| |- | || 23 August 1998|| |- | || 23 August 1998|| |- | || 29 August 1998|| |- | || 24 September 1998|| |- | || 25 August 1998|| |- | || 29 August 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 14 February 1996|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 16 May 1996|| |- | || 13 March 1997|| |- | || 17 August 1998|| |- | || 24 May 1996|| |- | || 25 April 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 23 April 1998|| |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size: 89%; float: left; width: 25em; margin-right: 1em; line-height: 1.65em !important; height: 675px; |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 16 October 1999|| |- | || 31 July 1998|| |- | || 17 August 1998|| |- | || 6 May 1998|| |- | || 25 August 1998|| |- | || 26 August 1998|| |- | || 10 September 1998|| |- | || 16 September 1998|| |- | || 24 September 1998|| |- | || 10 September 1998|| |- | || 21 September 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 17 August 1998|| |- | || 23 August 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 29 August 1998|| |- | || 17 September 1998|| |- | || 25 August 1998|| |- | || 16 January 1996|| |- | || 5 April 1996|| |- | || 14 January 1999|| |- | || 16 May 1996|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 25em; margin- right: 1em; line-height: 1.65em !important; height: 675px; |- | || 23 February 1996|| |- | || 22 September 1998|| |- | || 29 July 1998|| |- | || 17 August 1998|| |- | || 18 September 1998|| |- | || 15 September 1999|| |- | || 15 April 1996|| |- | || 29 March 1998|| |- | || 29 March 1998|| |- | || 17 August 1998|| |- | || 25 August 1998|| |- | || 20 April 1998|| |- | || 17 August 1998|| |- | || 26 August 1998|| |- | || 29 August 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 29 September 1998|| |- | || 17 August 1998|| |- | || 15 September 1998|| |- | || 24 April 1998|| |- | || 25 April 1998|| |- | || 17 August 1998|| |- | || 17 August 1998|| |- | || 25 August 1998|| |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 25em; margin-right: 1em; line-height: 1.65em !important; height: 675px; |- | || 18 September 1998|| |- | || 17 September 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 24 September 1998|| |- | || 18 September 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 24 September 1998|| |- | || 12 April 1996|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 22 April 1998|| |- | || 18 September 1998|| |- | || 19 April 1999|| |- | || 10 September 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |- | || 30 July 1998|| |- | || 25 August 1998|| |- | || 11 November 1998|| |- | || 16 January 1999|| |- | || 17 August 1998|| |- | || 15 September 1998|| |- | || 22 September 1998|| |- | || 23 September 1998|| |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 25em; margin-right: 1em; line- height: 1.65em !important; height: 220px; |- | || 10 September 1998|| |- | || 1 August 1998|| |- | || 10 September 1998|| |- | || 21 April 1998|| |- | || 30 July 1998|| |- | || 15 November 1998|| |- | || 21 September 1998|| |- | || 21 September 1998|| |} == See also == * List of asteroid-discovering observatories * * List of observatory codes == References == == External links == * * http://www.en.sci.hr/ Category:Astronomical observatories in Croatia Category:Buildings and structures in Istria County * Category:Minor- planet discovering observatories ",
