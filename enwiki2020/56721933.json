In Malang, Oza undergoes formal education from elementary to intermediate level, successively at SDN 1 Purwodadi, SMPN 6 Malang, and SMA 9 Malang. Oza did not complete his formal education at high school level, because when he was in high school he was admitted to INTI College Indonesia majoring in business. However, the lecture was not completed. Oza Kioza became a singer after following the direction of his mother, Nurhayati, who is a jazz and dangdut singer. While Oza's father is also not far from vocal affairs for being qori. On 2 November 2007 Oza Kioza attended the StarDut event at Indosiar.
