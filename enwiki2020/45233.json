    "text": "Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, (5 February 1788 \u2013 2 July 1850) was a British Conservative statesman who served twice as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1834\u201335 and 1841\u201346) and twice as Home Secretary (1822\u201327 and 1828\u201330). He is regarded as the father of modern British policing, owing to his founding of the Metropolitan Police Service. Peel was one of the founders of the modern Conservative Party. The son of a wealthy textile-manufacturer and politician, Peel was the first prime minister from an industrial business background. He earned a double first in classics and mathematics from Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the House of Commons in 1809, and became a rising star in the Tory Party. Peel entered the Cabinet as Home Secretary (1822\u20131827), where he reformed and liberalised the criminal law and created the modern police force, leading to a new type of officer known in tribute to him as \"bobbies\" and \"peelers\". After a brief period out of office he returned as Home Secretary under his political mentor the Duke of Wellington (1828\u20131830), also serving as Leader of the House of Commons. Initially a supporter of continued legal discrimination against Catholics, Peel reversed himself and supported the repeal of the Test Act (1828) and the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, claiming that \"though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger\". After being in the Opposition 1830\u201334, he became Prime Minister in November 1834. Peel issued the Tamworth Manifesto (December 1834), laying down the principles upon which the modern British Conservative Party is based. His first ministry was a minority government, dependent on Whig support and with Peel serving as his own Chancellor of the Exchequer. After only four months, his government collapsed and he served as Leader of the Opposition during Melbourne's second government (1835\u20131841). Peel became Prime Minister again after the 1841 general election. His second government ruled for five years. He cut tariffs to stimulate trade, replacing the lost revenue with a 3% income tax. He played a central role in making free trade a reality and set up a modern banking system. His government's major legislation included the Mines and Collieries Act 1842, the Income Tax Act 1842, the Factories Act 1844 and the Railway Regulation Act 1844. Peel's government was weakened by anti-Catholic sentiment following the controversial increase in the Maynooth Grant of 1845. After the outbreak of the Great Irish Famine, his decision to join with Whigs and Radicals to repeal the Corn Laws led to his resignation as Prime Minister in 1846. Peel remained an influential MP and leader of the Peelite faction until his death in 1850. Peel often started from a traditional Tory position in opposition to a measure, then reversed his stance and became the leader in supporting liberal legislation. This happened with the Test Act, Catholic Emancipation, the Reform Act, income tax and, most notably, the repeal of the Corn Laws. Historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote: \"Peel was in the first rank of 19th century statesmen. He carried Catholic Emancipation; he repealed the Corn Laws; he created the modern Conservative Party on the ruins of the old Toryism.\"A.J.P. Taylor, Politicians, Socialism and Historians (1980) p. 75 ==Early life== Peel was born at Chamber Hall, Bury, Lancashire, to the industrialist and parliamentarian Sir Robert Peel, 1st Baronet, and his wife Ellen Yates. His father was one of the richest textile manufacturers of the early Industrial Revolution.Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 2\u201311. The family moved from Lancashire to Drayton Manor near Tamworth, Staffordshire; the manor house has since been demolished, the site occupied by Drayton Manor Theme Park.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 490; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 4, 119. Peel received his early education from a clergyman tutor in Bury and at a clergyman's local school in Tamworth. He may also have attended Bury Grammar School or Hipperholme Grammar School, though evidence for either is anecdotal rather than textual. He started at Harrow School in February 1800. At Harrow he was a contemporary of Lord Byron, who recalled of Peel that \"we were on good terms\" and that \"I was always in scrapes, and he never\". On Harrow's Speech Day in 1804, Peel and Byron acted part of Virgil's Aeneid, Peel playing Turnus and Byron playing Latinus. Christ Church, Oxford, which Peel attended 1805\u20131808, graduating with a double first. He was later MP for the university, 1817\u20131829. In 1805 Peel matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford. His tutor was Charles Lloyd, later Regius Professor of Divinity, on Peel's recommendation appointed Bishop of Oxford. In 1808 Peel became the first Oxford student to take a double first in Classics and Mathematics.Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 11\u201312. Peel was a law student at Lincoln's Inn in 1809. He also held military commissions as a captain in the Manchester Regiment of Militia in 1808, and later as lieutenant in the Staffordshire Yeomanry Cavalry in 1820. ==Early political career== Peel entered politics in 1809 at the age of 21, as MP for the Irish rotten borough of Cashel, Tipperary.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 1; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 13; 376. With a scant 24 electors on the rolls, he was elected unopposed. His sponsor for the election (besides his father) was the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Sir Arthur Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington, with whom Peel's political career would be entwined for the next 25 years. Peel made his maiden speech at the start of the 1810 session, when he was chosen by Prime Minister Spencer Perceval to second the reply to the king's speech.Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 18. His speech was a sensation, famously described by the Speaker, Charles Abbot, as \"the best first speech since that of William Pitt.\"Gash, Mr. Secretary Peel, 59\u201361, 68\u201369. Peel changed constituency twice, becoming MP for Chippenham in 1812, and then MP for Oxford University in 1817.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 12, 18, 35. In 1810, Peel was appointed an Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies; his Secretary of State was Lord Liverpool. When Lord Liverpool formed a government in 1812, Peel was appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland. The Peace Preservation Act of 1814 authorised the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland to appoint additional magistrates in a county in a state of disturbance, who were authorised to appoint paid special constables (later called \"peelers\"OED entry at peeler (3)). Peel thus laid the basis for the Royal Irish Constabulary. Peel was firmly opposed to Catholic emancipation, believing that Catholics could not be admitted to Parliament as they refused to swear the Oath of Allegiance to the Crown. In May 1817, Peel delivered the closing speech in opposition to Henry Grattan's Catholic emancipation bill; the bill was defeated by 245 votes to 221. Peel resigned as Chief Secretary and left Ireland in August 1818. In 1819 the House of Commons appointed a Select Committee, the Bullion Committee, charged with stabilising British finances after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and Peel was chosen as its chairman.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 6\u201312; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 18\u201365, 376. Peel's Bill planned to return British currency to the gold standard, reversing the Bank Restriction Act 1797, within four years (it was actually accomplished by 1821). ==Home Secretary== The Duke of Wellington, Prime Minister 1828\u20131830, with Peel Peel was considered one of the rising stars of the Tory party, first entering the cabinet in 1822 as Home Secretary.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 3, 9, 13; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 66, 68; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 65. As Home Secretary, he introduced a number of important reforms of British criminal law.Gash, 1:477\u201388. He reduced the number of crimes punishable by death, and simplified the law by repealing a large number of criminal statutes and consolidating their provisions into what are known as Peel's Acts. He reformed the gaol system, introducing payment for gaolers and education for the inmates in the Gaols Act 1823.Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 68\u201371; 122; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 104. In 1827 the Prime Minister Lord Liverpool became incapacitated and was replaced by George Canning. Peel resigned as home secretary.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 4, 96\u201397; Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 26\u201328. Canning favoured Catholic emancipation, while Peel had been one of its most outspoken opponents (earning the nickname \"Orange Peel\", with Orange the colour of the anti-Catholic Orange Order).Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 21\u201348, 91\u2013100. George Canning himself died less than four months later and, after the brief premiership of Lord Goderich, Peel returned to the post of Home Secretary under the premiership of his long-time ally the Duke of Wellington.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 28\u201330; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 103\u201304; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 18. During this time he was widely perceived as the number-two in the Tory Party, after Wellington himself.Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 104. The Test and Corporation Acts required many officials to be communicants in the Anglican Church and penalised both nonconformists and Catholics. They were no longer enforced but were a matter of humiliation. Peel at first opposed the repeal, but reversed himself and led the repeal on behalf of the government, after consultation with Anglican Church leaders. The Sacramental Test Act 1828 passed into law in May 1828. In future religious issues he made it a point to consult with church leaders from the major denominations.Gash, 1:460\u201365; Richard A. Gaunt, \"Peel's Other Repeal: The Test and Corporation Acts, 1828,\" Parliamentary History (2014) 33#1 pp. 243\u201362. The 1828 Clare by-election returned the Catholic Irish nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell. By autumn 1828, the Chief Secretary for Ireland was alarmed by the extent of civil disorder and the prospect of a rebellion if O'Connell were barred from Parliament. Wellington and Peel now conceded the necessity of Catholic emancipation, Peel writing to Wellington that \"though emancipation was a great danger, civil strife was a greater danger\". Peel drew up the Catholic Relief bill. Peel felt compelled to stand for re-election to his seat in Oxford, as he was representing the graduates of Oxford University (many of whom were Anglican clergymen), and had previously stood on a platform of opposition to Catholic Emancipation.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 35\u201340; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 46\u201347, 110, 376. Peel lost his seat in a by-election in February 1829, but soon found another, moving to a rotten borough, Westbury, retaining his Cabinet position.Gash, 1:564\u201365 He stood for Tamworth in the general election of 1830, representing Tamworth until his death. Peel guided the Catholic relief bill through the House of Commons, Wellington through the House of Lords. With many Ultra-Tories vehemently opposed to emancipation, the bill could pass only with Whig support. Wellington threatened to resign if King George IV did not give Royal assent; the King finally relented, the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 passing into law in April 1829. Peel's U-turn cost him the trust of many Tories:Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 37\u201339; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 114\u201321. according to Norman Gash, Peel had been \"the idolized champion of the Protestant party; that party now regarded him as an outcast\".Gash, 1:545\u201398 William Heath depicted the Duke of Wellington and Peel in the roles of the body-snatchers Burke and Hare suffocating Mrs Docherty for sale to Dr. Knox; representing the extinguishing by Wellington and Peel of the 141-year-old Constitution of 1688 by Catholic Emancipation. ===Police reform=== It was in 1829 that Peel established the Metropolitan Police Force for London based at Scotland Yard.Gash, 1:488-98. The 1,000 constables employed were affectionately nicknamed 'bobbies' or, somewhat less affectionately, 'peelers'. Although unpopular at first, they proved very successful in cutting crime in London, and by 1857 all cities in Britain were obliged to form their own police forces.Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 87\u201390. Known as the father of modern policing, Peel developed the Peelian Principles which defined the ethical requirements police officers must follow to be effective. In 1829, when setting forth the principles of policing a democracy, Sir Robert Peel declared: \"The police are the public and the public are the police.\" ==Whigs in power (1830\u20131834)== The middle and working classes in England at that time, however, were clamouring for reform, and Catholic Emancipation was only one of the ideas in the air.Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 123\u201340. The Tory ministry refused to bend on other issues and were swept out of office in 1830 in favour of the Whigs.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 45\u201350; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 136\u201341. The following few years were extremely turbulent, but eventually enough reforms were passed that King William IV felt confident enough to invite the Tories to form a ministry again in succession to those of Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne in 1834.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 51\u201362, 64\u201390, 129\u201343, 146\u201377, 193\u2013201; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 179; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 66. Peel was selected as prime minister but was in Italy at the time, so Wellington acted as a caretaker for three weeks until Peel's return.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 196\u201397, 199; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 66\u201367. ==First term as prime minister (1834\u20131835)== The Tory Ministry was a minority government and depended on Whig goodwill for its continued existence. Parliament was dissolved in December 1834 and a general election called. Voting took place in January and February 1835, and Peel's supporters gained around 100 seats, but this was not enough to give them a majority.The Routledge Dictionary of Modern British History, John Plowright, Routledge, Abingdon, 2006. p235 As his statement of policy at the general election of January 1835, Peel issued the Tamworth Manifesto.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 210\u201315; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 184; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 12; 69\u201372. This document was the basis on which the modern Conservative Party was founded. In it Peel pledged that the Conservatives would endorse reform. The Whigs formed a compact with Daniel O'Connell's Irish Radical members to repeatedly defeat the government on various bills.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 227; 229\u201335; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 185\u201387; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 71\u201373. Eventually, after only about 100 days in government, Peel's ministry resigned out of frustration and the Whigs under Lord Melbourne returned to power.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 250\u201354, 257\u201361; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 188\u201392; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 74\u201376. The only real achievement of Peel's first administration was a commission to review the governance of the Church of England. This ecclesiastical commission was the forerunner of the Church Commissioners.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 224\u201326. ==Leader of the Opposition (1835\u20131841)== In May 1839 he was offered another chance to form a government, this time by the new monarch, Queen Victoria.Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 417\u201318; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 206. However, this too would have been a minority government, and Peel felt he needed a further sign of confidence from his Queen. Lord Melbourne had been Victoria's confidant since her accession in 1837, and many of the higher posts in Victoria's household were held by the wives and female relatives of Whigs;Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 416\u201317; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 206\u201307. there was some feeling that Victoria had allowed herself to be too closely associated with the Whig party. Peel therefore asked that some of this entourage be dismissed and replaced with their Conservative counterparts, provoking the so-called Bedchamber Crisis.Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 207\u2013208; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 89. Victoria refused to change her household, and despite pleadings from the Duke of Wellington, relied on assurances of support from Whig leaders. Peel refused to form a government, and the Whigs returned to power.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 23; Clark, Peel and the Conservatives: A Study in Party Politics 1832\u20131841, 419\u201326; 448; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 208\u201309; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 89\u201391. ==Second term as prime minister (1841\u20131846)== Engraving showing the members of Sir Robert Peel's government in 1844 ===Economic and financial reforms=== Peel finally had a chance to head a majority government following the election of July 1841.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 24. Peel came to office during an economic recession which had seen a slump in world trade and a budget deficit of \u00a37.5 million run up by the Whigs. Confidence in banks and businesses was low, and a trade deficit existed. To raise revenue Peel's 1842 budget saw the re- introduction of the income tax,Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 35\u201336; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 227; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 112. removed previously at the end of the Napoleonic War. The rate was 7d in the pound, or just under 3 per cent. The money raised was more than expected and allowed for the removal and reduction of over 1,200 tariffs on imports including the controversial sugar duties.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 37; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 235; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 113\u201314. It was also in the 1842 budget that the repeal of the corn laws was first proposed.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 35\u201336; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 112\u201313. It was defeated in a Commons vote by a margin of 4:1. ===Factory Act=== Peel's promise of modest reform was held to, and the second most famous bill of this ministry, while \"reforming\" in 21st-century eyes, was in fact aimed at the reformers themselves, with their constituency among the new industrial rich. The Factory Act 1844 acted more against these industrialists than it did against the traditional stronghold of the Conservatives, the landed gentry, by restricting the number of hours that children and women could work in a factory and setting rudimentary safety standards for machinery.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 40\u201342; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 302\u201305; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 125; 129. This was a continuation of his own father's work as an MP, as the elder Robert Peel was most noted for reform of working conditions during the first part of the 19th century. Helping him was Lord Shaftesbury, a British MP who also established the coal mines act. ===Assassination attempt=== In 1843 Peel was the target of a failed assassination attempt; a criminally insane Scottish wood turner named Daniel M'Naghten stalked him for several days before killing Peel's personal secretary Edward Drummond thinking he was Peel,Read, Peel and the Victorians, 121\u201322. which led to the formation of the criminal defense of insanity. ===Corn Laws and after=== The most notable act of Peel's second ministry, however, was the one that would bring it down.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 113\u201315. Peel moved against the landholders by repealing the Corn Laws, which supported agricultural revenues by restricting grain imports.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, vi. This radical break with Conservative protectionism was triggered by the Great Irish Famine (1845\u20131849).Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 66; Ramsay; Sir Robert Peel, 332\u201333. Tory agriculturalists were sceptical of the extent of the problem,Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 72. and Peel reacted slowly to the famine, famously stating in October 1846 (already in opposition): \"There is such a tendency to exaggeration and inaccuracy in Irish reports that delay in acting on them is always desirable\". His own party failed to support the bill, but it passed with Whig and Radical support. On the third reading of Peel's Bill of Repeal (Importation Act 1846) on 15 May, MPs voted 327 votes to 229 (a majority of 98) to repeal the Corn Laws. On 25 June the Duke of Wellington persuaded the House of Lords to pass it. On that same night Peel's Irish Coercion Bill was defeated in the Commons by 292 to 219 by \"a combination of Whigs, Radicals, and Tory protectionists\".Schonhardt- Bailey, p. 239. Following this, on 29 June 1846, Peel resigned as prime minister.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 68\u201369, 70, 72; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 347; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 230\u201331. Though he knew repealing the laws would mean the end of his ministry, Peel decided to do so.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 67\u201369. It is possible that Peel merely used the Irish Famine as an excuse to repeal the Corn Laws as he had been an intellectual convert to free trade since the 1820s. Blake points out that if Peel had been convinced that total repeal was necessary to stave off the famine, he would have enacted a bill that brought about immediate temporary repeal, not permanent repeal over a three-year period of gradual tapering-off of duties.Blake, Disraeli, 221-222. The historian Boyd Hilton argued that Peel knew from 1844 he was going to be deposed as the Conservative leader. Many of his MPs had taken to voting against him, and the rupture within the party between liberals and paternalists, which had been so damaging in the 1820s but masked by the issue of parliamentary reform in the 1830s, was brought to the surface over the Corn Laws. Hilton's hypothesis is that Peel wished to be deposed on a liberal issue so that he might later lead a Peelite/Whig/Liberal alliance. As an aside in reference to the repeal of the Corn Laws, Peel did make some moves to subsidise the purchase of food for the Irish, but this attempt was small and had little tangible effect. In the age of laissez-faire,Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 70. government taxes were small, and subsidies or direct economic interference was almost nonexistent. That subsidies were actually given was very much out of character for the political times; Peel's successor, Lord John Russell, received more criticism than Peel on Irish policy. The repeal of the Corn Laws was more political than humanitarian.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 69\u201371. Peel's support for free trade could already be seen in his 1842 and 1845 budgets;Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, pp. 35\u201337, 59. in late 1842 Graham wrote to Peel that \"the next change in the Corn Laws must be to an open trade\" while arguing that the government should not tackle the issue.Quoted in Gash, Sir Robert Peel, 362. Speaking to the cabinet in 1844, Peel argued that the choice was maintenance of the 1842 Corn Law or total repeal.Gash, Sir Robert Peel, 429. Despite all of Peel's efforts, his reform programs had little effect on the situation in Ireland.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, pp. 48\u201349. ==Later career and death== Peel did retain a hard core of supporters however, known as Peelites,Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 78\u201380; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 353\u201355. and at one point in 1849 was actively courted by the Whig/Radical coalition. He continued to stand on his conservative principles, however, and refused. Nevertheless, he was influential on several important issues, including the furtherance of British free trade with the repeal of the Navigation Acts.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 78; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 377; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 257. Peel was a member of the committee which controlled the House of Commons Library, and on 16 April 1850 was responsible for passing the motion that controlled its scope and collection policy for the rest of the century. Peel was thrown from his horse while riding on Constitution Hill in London on 29 June 1850. The horse stumbled on top of him, and he died three days later on 2 July at the age of 62 due to a clavicular fracture rupturing his subclavian vessels.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 80; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 361\u201363; Read, Peel and the Victorians, 1; 266\u201370. His Peelite followers, led by Lord Aberdeen and William Gladstone, went on to fuse with the Whigs as the Liberal Party.Adelman, Peel and the Conservative Party: 1830\u20131850, 86\u201387; Ramsay, Sir Robert Peel, 364. ==Family== Thomas Lawrence's portrait of his patron Julia, Lady Peel (1827), now in the Frick Collection. Peel married Julia Floyd (1795 - 1859) (daughter of General Sir John Floyd, 1st Baronet and his first wife Rebecca Darke) on 8 June 1820. They had seven children: *Julia Peel (30 April 1821 \u2013 14 August 1893). She married George Child Villiers, 6th Earl of Jersey, on 12 July 1841. They had five children. She married her second husband, Charles Brandling, on 12 September 1865. *Sir Robert Peel, 3rd Baronet (4 May 1822 \u2013 9 May 1895). He married Lady Emily Hay on 17 June 1856. They had five children. *Sir Frederick Peel (26 October 1823 \u2013 6 June 1906). He married Elizabeth Shelley (died 30 July 1865, niece of the poet Percy Shelley through his brother John) on 12 August 1857. He was remarried to Janet Pleydell- Bouverie on 3 September 1879. *Sir William Peel (2 November 1824 \u2013 27 April 1858). *John Floyd Peel (24 May 1827 \u2013 21 April 1910). He married Annie Jenny in 1851. *Arthur Wellesley Peel (3 August 1829 \u2013 24 October 1912). He married Adelaide Dugdale, daughter of William Stratford Dugdale and Harriet Ella Portman, on 14 August 1862. They had seven children. *Eliza Peel ( \u2013 April 1883). She married Hon. Francis Stonor (son of Thomas Stonor, 3rd Baron Camoys) on 25 September 1855. They had four children. Julia, Lady Peel, died in 1859.
