    "text": "Lake M\u00e1cha () is an artificial lake (fish pond) (now 2.84 km\u00b2) in the Liberec Region of the Czech Republic, near Doksy and Bezd\u011bz Castle. During the Cenozoic Era, a large lake existed at this site (as a remnant of an older sea). During the last Ice Age, the lake drained away, leaving only a peat bog. Between 1366 and 1367 Charles IV ordered a large pond to be established here. Its older name was Velk\u00fd rybn\u00edk ('Big Pond', or in German Gro\u00dfteich) or Hirschbersk\u00fd rybn\u00edk ('Big Hirschberg Pond', or in German Hirschberger Gro\u00dfteich). Its current name was established after 1945 and officially since 1961. The name refers to the romantic poet Karel Hynek M\u00e1cha. ==External links== * Information about the lake for tourists Macha Category:Geography of the Liberec Region Category:\u010cesk\u00e1 L\u00edpa District Macha ",
