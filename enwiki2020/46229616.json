    "text": "is a Japanese physician and oncologist specializing in molecular diagnosis and novel medical treatment of cancer. He is well known for the discovery of a melanoma-related antigen (later, it is called, Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan-4 (CSPG4)) by producing a monoclonal antibody. In addition, he produced monoclonal antibodies against CEA or ICAM-1 and found out they are usable in the diagnosis and the pathological analysis. He is a former professor and president of Sapporo Medical University. He was a Council Member of Science Council of Japan (The 20th and 21st term).
