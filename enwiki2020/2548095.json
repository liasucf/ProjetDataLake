    "text": "Now 70s (formerly Channel U, Channel AKA, Massive R&B; and Total Country) is a British digital satellite TV music channel, owned by All Around the World Productions, available through Sky, Freeview and Virgin Media within the UK and Ireland. It focuses on music from the 1970s, being the third decade- oriented channel in the Now portfolio, along with Now 80s and Now 90s. ==History== ===As Channel U=== Channel U: 3 March 2003 - 16 March 2009 Channel U was a significant outlet not only for established artists, but also for those who are just starting out, helping the breakthrough for acts such as Tinchy Stryder, Tinie Tempah, Dizzee Rascal, Chip, Wretch 32, Devlin, Giggs, Skepta and N-Dubz. Its material \"includes crude productions shot with handheld digital video cameras,\" and helps new musicians attract attention and build a fan base. According to its website, \"the aim of the channel was to highlight to the public, the raw and unsigned talent we have in the UK, and give them a platform from which they could perform,\" and it has been successful in this mission, as suggested by the production and popularity of such compilation CDs as Channel U: The Album. Many artists have expressed their loyalty to the channel in their lyrics; for example, in Lady Sovereign's \"9 to 5\", \"Channel who? Oh Channel U, the ones who made me huge, like Katie Price's boobs!\". Other artists to comment on Channel U include Kano, Ironik, Lethal Bizzle, Sway, Remi Nicole, Mr Wong, and Dizzee Rascal. Dan le sac vs Scroobius Pip criticised Channel U in their song \"Fixed\", as did Lowkey, who cited the absence of any innovation and the channel's lack of desire to take risks. Channel U commissioned the first 'grime comedy', an animated adult sitcom named The Booo Krooo. The TV series ran for six episodes and focused on the misadventures of three young MCs trying to break into the music game, but often ending up worse off than when they started. The Booo Krooo was originally a cult classic to readers of RWD Magazine and came got the attention of the Channel U after being co-signed by Missy Elliott. The animation series was developed by Matt Mason and Alex Donne Johnson with illustrations by Julian Johnson, aka Art Jaz. Music publication Ransom Note said: > \"Boo Kroo were essentially a proto version of People Just Do Nothing. After > proving a popular feature in the magazine, Boo Kroo were given their own > show on Channel U \u2013 which is how this video for the track (by a peak form > Sticky) came about.\" In October 2005, the first annual Channel U Awards were held in London with live performances from its underground playlist. Before he joined MTV to host the British version of Pimp My Ride, Tim Westwood had a show on Channel AKA, along with his other media activity. Following the success of the Westwood show the channel further developed its programming by licensing a lifestyle TV series, The Ballers Show, in 2006. The 30-minute show gave its audience the unique opportunity to see the real lives of footballers off the pitch and featured Premier League football stars including Jermain Defoe and Jermaine Pennant. On 14 July 2016, the channel's founder, Darren Platt, died. In his obituary in The Guardian the newspaper stated that Channel U \"forged a place for a genre that began its life ignored by the mainstream\". On 25 September 2020, it was confirmed that Channel U would be returning to TV on 13 November 2020 to promote the film Against All Odds. ===As Channel AKA=== Channel AKA: 16 March 2009 - 11 April 2014 Channel AKA: 11 April 2014 - 1 June 2018 The parent company of Fizz TV and Channel U went into voluntary liquidation at the beginning of February, 2009, before being purchased by Mushroom TV.
