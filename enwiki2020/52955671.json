Amelia Abascal was primarily a self-taught artist. After arriving in Mexico in 1940 at the age of 17, she took classes in chemistry, and applied it to her plastic arts, painting, ceramics, and designing. She was one of four artists to represent Mexico in 1968 at an exhibition in Argentina of Latin American painting. Following the Exhibition in Argentina Amelia Abascal won acclaim with a solo exhibition at the Misrachi Art Gallery in Mexico City, Mexico in 1968. Abascal's work involves treating bronze and copper sheets with acid to create an eroded texture. She specializes in relief sculpture, but has also produced murals. == Works == Amelia Abascal's acid treated copper plates were shown at the 1967 Galer\u00eda de Arte Mexicano which was held in Mexico City, Mexico during the months of January and February.
