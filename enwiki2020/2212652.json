    "text": "Canora was a commuter rail station formerly operated by Exo in the west end of the C\u00f4te-des-Neiges neighbourhood of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, just east of Mount Royal. It was served by the Deux-Montagnes line and Mascouche line until 2020. The platforms are located northwest of the west portal of the Mount Royal Tunnel. Canora will reopen in 2022 as a station on the R\u00e9seau express m\u00e9tropolitain. ==History== The station is located at 7300, Canora Road, immediately northwest of Jean Talon Street. The station takes its name from Canora Road, which in turn takes its name from the first operator of this line, the CAnadian NOrthern RAilway, which built the line and operated it for a short time before it was merged into Canadian National Railway. From the opening of the Deux-Montagnes Line in 1918 until the modernization of the line, which took place between 1993 and 1995, the station was called Portal Heights because of its location at the northwest end of the Mount Royal Tunnel. The station is valued by the residents of not only the town of Mont- Royal, but also by those of the C\u00f4te-des-Neiges borough, for its fast connection with the downtown Central station involves a 7-minute journey via the tunnel. Under the R\u00e9seau express m\u00e9tropolitain (REM) proposal, which would convert the Deux-Montagnes line to rapid-transit operation, a connecting station would be built on the Saint-J\u00e9r\u00f4me line adjacent to Canora across Rue- Jean-Talon. Starting in May 2018, due to its 4-year-long process of being converted to light rapid transit, only one of the station's two platforms was being used for travel in both directions; the same was true for its neighbouring station Mont-Royal (outbound). The station was fully closed on May 11, 2020, in order to be converted into a REM station. It is slated to reopen in 2022. ==Connecting bus routes == {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"background: #; font-size:100%; color:#FFFFFF;\" colspan=4|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de transport de Montr\u00e9al |- !
