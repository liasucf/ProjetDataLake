    "text": "The men's team pursuit event in cycling at the 2000 Summer Olympics was held on Sunday, 17 September, and Monday, 18 September 2000 at the Dunc Gray Velodrome. The competition consisted of matches between two teams of four cyclists. The teams started at opposite ends of the track. They had 16 laps (4 kilometres) in which to catch the other cyclist. If neither was caught before one had gone 16 laps, the times for the distance (based on the third rider of the team to cross the line) were used to determine the victor. ==Medalists== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |align=center bgcolor=gold| Gold Gold |align=center bgcolor=silver| Silver Silver |align=center bgcolor=cc9966| Bronze Bronze |- | Guido Fulst Robert Bartko Daniel Becke Jens Lehmann | Sergiy Chernyavsky Sergiy Matveyev Alexander Symonenko Oleksandr Fedenko | Paul Manning Chris Newton Bryan Steel Bradley Wiggins |} ==Records== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- World and Olympic records prior to the Games. | World Record | 4:00.958 | Italy | Manchester, Great Britain | 31 August 1996 |- | Olympic Record | 4:05.930 | France | Atlanta, USA | 27 July 1996 |} ==Results== * Q denotes qualification by place in heat. * q denotes qualification by overall place. * DNS denotes did not start. * DNF denotes did not finish. * DQ denotes disqualification. * NR denotes national record. * OR denotes Olympic record. * WR denotes world record. * PB denotes personal best. * SB denotes season best. ===Qualifying round=== Held 18 September For the qualifying round, teams did not face each other.
