    "text": "The Chorrera Formation (, N2ch) is a geological formation of the Bogot\u00e1 savanna, Altiplano Cundiboyacense, Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes. The formation consists of coarse to very coarse conglomerates. The Chorrera Formation dates to the Neogene period; Pliocene epoch (Montehermosan to Chapadmalalan in the SALMA classification), and has a maximum thickness of . == Etymology == The formation was defined by Helmens and Van der Hammen in 1995 after the La Chorrera waterfall in Subachoque.Montoya & Reyes, 2005, p.67 == Description == === Lithologies === The Chorrera Formation consists of coarse to very coarse conglomerates. === Stratigraphy and depositional environment === The Chorrera Formation unconformably overlies the Late Cretaceous Guadalupe Group. The formation is overlain by the Pleistocene Subachoque Formation. The age of the Chorrera Formation has been estimated to be Late Pliocene based on its stratigraphical position. The depositional environment is characterised by alluvial fans formed during the main phase of tectonic uplift of the Eastern Ranges in the Late Pliocene. Dutch geologist Salomon Kroonenberg, who studied the Neogene uplift of the Eastern Andes in Colombia, defines the main stage of uplift between six and four million years ago. Other Dutch geologists Helmens, Van der Hammen and Hooghiemstra have pushed back this uplift phase to between 4.5 and 3 Ma.Molnar, 2004, p.75 The facies origin of the Chorrera Formation is comparable to the Marichuela Formation, outcropping on the eastern edge of the Bogot\u00e1 savanna, yet different in stratigraphic position. The deposition of sediments of the Chorrera Formation is time-equivalent with the explosive phase of the Paipa\u2013Iza volcanic complex, active between 4.7 and 3.6 Ma,Monsalve et al., 2011, p.120 and the Miocene to Late Pliocene Tilat\u00e1 Formation. == Outcrops == The Chorrera Formation is found at its type locality in the synclinal of the R\u00edo Fr\u00edo, east of Subachoque, Cundinamarca. == See also == : Geology of the Eastern Hills : Geology of the Ocet\u00e1 P\u00e1ramo : Geology of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense == References == === Bibliography === * * * == External links == * Category:Geologic formations of Colombia Category:Neogene Colombia Category:Pliocene Series of South America Category:Chapadmalalan Category:Montehermosan Category:Conglomerate formations Category:Alluvial deposits Formations Formations ",
