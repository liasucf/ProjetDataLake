Xerox first became interested in office automation through computers in 1969 and purchased Scientific Data Systems or SDS. They then renamed the division Xerox Data Systems or XDS; they saw limited success, and the division was ultimately sold to Honeywell at a significant loss. The Sigma 9 was announced in 1970 and the first delivery was made in 1971. There were 3 models built, the Sigma 9, the Sigma 9 Model 2 and the Sigma 9 Model 3. The original was the most powerful and was universally applicable to all data processing applications at the time. The Model 2 was able to process in multi-programmed batch, remote batch, conversational time- sharing, real-time, and transaction processing modes. The Model 3 was designed for the scientific real-time community. ==Features of the Basic Systems== All models featured a CPU with at least a floating-point arithmetic unit, Memory map with access protection, Memory write protection, Two real-time clocks, a Power fail-safe, an External interface, Ten internal interrupt levels. Also a Multiplexor input/output processor (MIOP) featuring Channel A with eight sub- channels. Listed below are the individual specifications ===Sigma 9=== * CPU featuring: ** Decimal arithmetic unit ** Two 16-register general purpose register blocks ** Interrupt control chassis with eight external interrupt levels ** Memory reconfiguration control unit * Main Memory of 64K words * Motor generator set ===Model 2=== * CPU featuring: ** Decimal arithmetic unit ** Two 16-register general purpose register blocks ** Interrupt control chassis with two external interrupt levels * Main Memory of 32K words ===Model 3=== * CPU featuring: ** One 16-register general purpose register blocks ** Interrupt control chassis with two external interrupt levels * Main Memory of 32K words ==Interesting facts== * The Sigma 9 had a very long run, about 10 years, and around 1980 other companies started building computers that could emulate the Sigma 9. Telefile was first and Modutest was shortly behind. *Motorola paired the Sigma 9 with the IBM 370/168 for improved function and avoidance of duplicate hardware costs. * In 1976 the Mississippi State Central Data Processing Authority published multiple requests for Proposals to lease or purchase of a Sigma 9 to help with daily office tasks. * In February 1975 the first Sigma 9 went online at the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC). In October 1976 the 3rd Sigma 9 went online and 2 million records were added to the database. This continued on until 1986 when the fifteenth Sigma 9 was connected and the database contained 15 million bibliographic records. *The Xerox Sigma 9 worked very well for library databases and was used in quite a few University libraries around the country. == References == ==Further reading== *Sigma 8, 9 Withdrawal Pains Eased With Independent Memory.
