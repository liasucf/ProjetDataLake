    "text": "Adilson E. Motter (born January 1, 1974 in Brazil), is the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison Professor of Physics at Northwestern University, where he has helped develop the concept of synthetic rescue in network biology as well as methods to control the nonlinear dynamics of complex networks. In joint work with Takashi Nishikawa, he discovered the phenomenon of asymmetry-induced symmetry.Nishikawa T. and Motter A. E., Symmetric States Requiring System Asymmetry, Physical Review Letters 117, 114101 (2016). Motter's research is focused on complex systems and nonlinear phenomena, primarily involving complex networks, systems biology, chaos and statistical physics. ==Scientific activity== Motter has contributed to the study of nonlinear phenomena in complex systems. He and his collaborators have established conditions for the synchronization of power grids Motter A. E., Myers S. A., Anghel M., and Nishikawa T., Spontaneous synchrony in power-grid networks, Nature Physics 9, 191 (2013).Better power grid synchronization may enable smart grids to self- recover from failures, Phys.Org, February 22, 2013, by Lisa Zyga. and other complex networks.Motter A. E., Zhou C. Z. and Kurths J., Network Synchronization, Diffusion, and the Paradox of Heterogeneity, Physical Review E 71, 016116 (2005).Nishikawa T. and Motter A. E., Network Synchronization Landscape Reveals Compensatory Structures, Quantization, and the Positive Effect of Negative Interactions, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 107, 10342 (2010). Together with his former student Z. Nicolaou, he designed a class of mechanical metamaterials that exhibit longitudinal negative compressibility.Nicolaou Z. G. and Motter A. E., Mechanical metamaterials with negative compressibility transitions, Nature Materials 11, 608 (2012). He has devised local methods for cascade control in distributed systemsMotter A. E., Cascade Control and Defense in Complex Networks, Physical Review Letters 93, 098701 (2004). and his team advanced the large-scale modeling of cascading failures.Yang Y., Nishikawa T., and Motter A. E., Small Vulnerable Sets Determine Large Network Cascades in Power Grids, Science 358 (6365), eaan3184 (2017). His group has studied implications of these methods for the recovery of lost function in biological Motter A.

E., NECO - A scalable algorithm for NEtwork COntrol, Protocol Exchange (2013), doi:10.1038/protex.2013.063. His first publication in network science established the three degrees of separation for English words.Small word network, Nature Science Update, July 2, 2002, by Philip Ball. In other areas, most noticeably chaos theory, he is known for accommodating the formalism of chaos theory within general relativity.Motter A. E., Relativistic Chaos is Coordinate Invariant, Physical Review Letters 91, 231101 (2003). Along with colleagues, he also formalized the concept of doubly transient chaos in dissipative dynamical systems Motter A. E., Gruiz M., K\u00e1rolyi G. and Tel T., Doubly transient chaos: Generic form of chaos in autonomous dissipative systems, Physical Review Letters 111, 194101 (2013). and discovered that network dynamics can exhibit sensitive dependence on network structure much in the same way chaotic dynamics exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions or parameters.Nishikawa T., Sun J. and Motter A. E., Sensitive dependence of optimal network dynamics on network structure, Physical Review X 7, 041044 (2017). Together with Marc Timme, he wrote the review \u201cAntagonistic Phenomena in Network Dynamics\u201d, which discusses a variety of seemly paradoxical or highly counterintuitive effects in collective network dynamics.Motter A. E. and Timme M., Antagonistic Phenomena in Network Dynamics, Annu. Rev. Condens. Matter Phys 9, 463 (2018). ==Awards== Motter is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. He was selected as a Sloan Research Fellow in 2009, received an NSF CAREER Award in 2011, and was awarded the Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi Prize in Network Science in 2013. In 2014 he was identified among the 30 most promising scientists under the age of 40 born in Latin America, according to a survey conducted jointly by the magazine Qu\u00e9 Pasa and the blog LatinAmericanScience.org. LatinAm\u00e9rica Genial, Qu\u00e9 Pasa, May 2, 2014. In 2015, the Simons Foundation named Motter one of their Fellows in Theoretical Physics. He is an elected Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and in 2020 was named Fellow of the Network Science Society. ==References== ==External links== * Home Page * Publications * Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian scientists Category:Brazilian physicists Category:Complex systems scientists Category:Systems biologists Category:Chaos theorists Category:Northwestern University faculty Category:Sloan Research Fellows Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Category:21st-century American physicists Category:Brazilian people of Italian descent ",
