Both tests are widely used in neuropsychological assessment. Rey was considered to be a pioneer in clinical psychology, child psychology, and neuropsychology. Rey is known in American neuropsychological literature for his \"tests of malingering\". Rey's tests of malingering include the Rey 15-Item Memory Test (RMT), the Rey Word Recognitions Test (WRT), and the Rey Dot Counting Test (DCT). ==Publications== *Translations of excerpts from Andre Rey\"s Psychological examination of traumatic encephalopathy and P.
