    "text": "Liddell Power Station was commissioned between 1971 and 1973 These fossil fuel power stations burn coal to power steam turbines that generate some or all of the electricity they produce. Australia's fleet of coal fired power stations are aging and due for replacement. In early 2017, 75% of coal fired power station in the country were operating beyond their original design life. The declining cost of renewable energy sources such as solar power, wind power and battery storage means it is unlikely a new coal fired power station will ever be built in Australia. The Liddell Power Station is expected to be decommissioned and replaced by battery storage in 2022. == New South Wales == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\" !

The Northern Territory relies predominantly on natural gas, as well as various renewable energy sources. Likewise, it has no functioning coal fired power stations. South Australia previously had a number of coal power stations. The last to be closed were the Northern and Playford B power stations. == See also == *100% renewable energy *Energy policy of Australia *List of natural gas fired power stations in Australia == References == Coal Category:Coal-fired power stations in Australia Category:Lists of coal-fired power stations ",
