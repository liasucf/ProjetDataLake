    "text": "KEZT-CD, virtual channel 23 (UHF digital channel 34), is a low-powered, Class A television station licensed to Sacramento, California, United States. It is a translator of Modesto-licensed Univision owned-and-operated station KUVS-DT (channel 19) which is owned by the Univision Local Media subsidiary of Univision Communications. KEZT-CD's transmitter is located on 22nd Street in downtown Sacramento. Its parent station shares studios with Stockton-licensed duopoly partner and UniM\u00e1s owned-and-operated station KTFK-DT (channel 64) on Arden Way near Cal Expo in Sacramento. ==History== KEZT first aired programming from The Box (later MTV2) in the 1990s, and then Telefutura, when the network was launched in 2002. When KTFK-TV channel 64 was acquired by Univision Communications in 2003, it assumed the Telefutura affiliation in 2004 and channel 23 switched to the Home Shopping Network. This made KEZT one of two television stations owned by Univision to broadcast in English (along with KUVI-DT, the UPN (later MyNetworkTV) affiliate at the time in Bakersfield); however, it re-aired a Spanish-language newscast and two Spanish-language public affairs programs from KUVS on Sunday mornings to meet Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirements regarding local programming on Class A television stations. In 2014, KEZT began repeating KUVS-DT, which made KUVI-DT the only English-language Univision-owned station. To accommodate these changes, the station added three new subchannels, expanding from one SD channel to four channels (with two HD channels in 5.1 surround sound for Spanish programming and two SD channels for English programming). ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

It was replaced with a digital channel (in standard definition with 2-channel sound) the same day. ==Newscasts== The newscasts of both sister stations KUVS and KTFK are seen on the station's .1 and .2 subchannels, respectively. ==References== ==External links== *Official website * EZT-CD Category:Univision low-power network affiliates Category:Bounce TV affiliates Category:Court TV Mystery affiliates Category:Digital low-power television stations Category:Television channels and stations established in 1992 Category:1992 establishments in California ",
