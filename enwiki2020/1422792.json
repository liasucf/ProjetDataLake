In the song, the repeated usage of the phrase \"and the band played on\" signaled that no one was paying proper attention to world problems, in the same manner the AIDS epidemic was initially ignored.

The Temptations\u2019 version is seen in the 2018 film Blackkklansman. ==Tina Turner version== The song \"Ball of Confusion\" plays an important part in the career of Tina Turner - if only indirectly. Her recording of the track was included on 1982 album Music of Quality and Distinction Volume One, a tribute by the British Electric Foundation featuring members of the new wave band Heaven 17, Love and Rockets and a number of guest vocalists covering 1960s and 1970s hits, among them Sandie Shaw, Paul Jones, Billy Mackenzie, Paula Yates and Gary Glitter. Turner's synth-driven interpretation of \"Ball of Confusion\" opened the album, was also issued as a single, and became a Top 5 hit in Norway; this led to Capitol Records signing Turner and to Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh recording another 1970s cover with her in late 1983. The track was Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together\", which became a surprise hit single on both sides of the Atlantic and the starting point of Turner's comeback, with the following 1984 album Private Dancer going multi-platinum in 1984. ===Versions and mixes=== * Album Version/7\" Mix - 3:20 * 7\" Instrumental - 3:20 * 1991 B.E.F.
