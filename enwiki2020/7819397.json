    "text": "Alfred Schreuder (; born 2 November 1972) is a Dutch football manager and current FC Barcelona assistant manager, having previously managed TSG 1899 Hoffenheim ==Club career== During his career Schreuder played for RKC Waalwijk, NAC Breda, Feyenoord, FC Twente and Vitesse. After he had stopped playing for FC Twente in March 2008, he joined SDV Barneveld on amateur base. It was after about three months when he returned as professional football player as he signed a new contract for one year at Vitesse. He retired in January 2009. ==Managerial career== Schreuder started his managerial career, immediately after his retirement, as assistant manager of Vitesse. In the summer of 2009 he signed with FC Twente to be assistant manager of Steve McClaren. After McClaren resigned his position on 26 February 2013, Schreuder was appointed interim manager. However, in March 2013, the club officially appointed Michel Jansen as head coach and Schreuder as his assistant, because Schreuder was not yet appropriately licensed as a manager. This arrangement continued for the 2013\u201314 season, while Schreuder was studying for the UEFA Pro Licence, which he obtained in May 2014. Subsequently, Schreuder was installed as manager of FC Twente, with Jansen as his assistant. On 30 August 2015, Schreuder was sacked after winning one point in the first four matches of the 2015\u201316 season. On 26 October 2015, Schreuder was appointed assistant manager of Huub Stevens at TSG 1899 Hoffenheim. After Stevens' resignation on 10 February 2016, he remained at the club as assistant of Julian Nagelsmann. On 5 January 2018, it was announced that Ajax had reached an agreement with Hoffenheim to sign Schreuder as assistant of their new head coach Erik ten Hag. In March 2019, it was announced that Schreuder would succeed Julian Nagelsmann as head coach of TSG 1899 Hoffenheim from 1 July 2019 after signing a contract until 2022. However he has been sacked by the club on 9 June 2020 since his form is not up to the expectations of the board . As of August 2020, Schreuder joined FC Barcelona as assistant-manager under Ronald Koeman, both signing a 2-year deal with an escape-clause option after the first year. ==Personal life== His brother Dick was also a footballer and joined him in coaching at Hoffenheim. ==Statistics== ===Club=== {| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border:1px solid #AAAAAA;font-size:90%\" |-bgcolor=\"#E4E4E4\" !style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #AAAAAA\" |Season !style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #AAAAAA\" |Club !style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #AAAAAA\" |Competition !style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #AAAAAA\" align=\"center\" |Apps !style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #AAAAAA\" align=\"center\" |Goals |- |1991/92||Feyenoord|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|1||align=\"center\"|0 |- |1992/93||Feyenoord|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|0||align=\"center\"|0 |- |1993/94||RKC Waalwijk|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|29||align=\"center\"|1 |- |1994/95||RKC Waalwijk|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|29||align=\"center\"|3 |- |1995/96||RKC Waalwijk|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|29||align=\"center\"|1 |- |1996/97||RKC Waalwijk|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|32||align=\"center\"|2 |- |1997/98||NAC Breda|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|28||align=\"center\"|0 |- |1998/99||NAC Breda|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|31||align=\"center\"|1 |- |1999/00||NAC Breda|| Eerste Divisie||align=\"center\"|32||align=\"center\"|3 |- |2000/01||NAC Breda|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|25||align=\"center\"|2 |- |2001/02||NAC Breda|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|34||align=\"center\"|0 |- |2002/03||NAC Breda|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|34||align=\"center\"|2 |- |2003/04||Feyenoord|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|25||align=\"center\"|0 |- |2004/05||RKC Waalwijk|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|20||align=\"center\"|0 |- |2005/06||Feyenoord|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|1||align=\"center\"|0 |- |2006/07||Feyenoord|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|10||align=\"center\"|0 |- |2007/08||FC Twente|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|3||align=\"center\"|0 |- | ||SDV Barneveld|| Eerste Klasse||align=\"center\"|-||align=\"center\"|- |- |2008/09||Vitesse|| Eredivisie||align=\"center\"|6||align=\"center\"|0 |- style=\"background:#E4E4E4;\" !! colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\" | Total !! 369 !! 15 |} ===Managerial statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |Team ! rowspan=\"2\" |From ! rowspan=\"2\"|To ! colspan=\"8\" |Record !rowspan=2| |- ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- |align=left|Twente (interim) |align=left|26 February 2013 |align=left|1 April 2013 | |- |align=left|Twente |align=left|1 July 2014 |align=left|30 August 2015 | |- |align=left|1899 Hoffenheim |align=left|1 July 2019 |align=left|9 June 2020 | |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total !\u2014 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:People from Barneveld Category:Dutch footballers Category:Feyenoord players Category:RKC Waalwijk players Category:NAC Breda players Category:FC Twente players Category:SBV Vitesse players Category:Eredivisie players Category:Eerste Divisie players Category:Dutch football managers Category:FC Twente managers Category:Eredivisie managers Category:TSG 1899 Hoffenheim managers Category:Bundesliga managers Category:AFC Ajax non-playing staff Category:Dutch expatriate sportspeople in Germany Category:Association football midfielders Category:Expatriate football managers in Germany Category:Dutch expatriate football managers ",
