Subsequently, Torrid was used in the 1930s as a trials ship for new anti-submarine warfare weapons, particularly playing a role in the development of ASDIC. The vessel was launched on 10 February 1917 and wrecked off the Falmouth coast en route to being broken up on 16 March 1937. ==Design== Torrid was one of ten destroyers ordered by the British Admiralty in March 1916 as part of the Eighth War Construction Programme. The ship was laid down by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson at Wallsend on the River Tyne and launched in February 1917. Torrid was long between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was normal and deep load. Power was provided by three Yarrow boilers feeding two Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines rated at and driving two shafts, to give a design speed of . Three funnels were fitted. of oil were carried, giving a design range of at . Armament consisted of three Mk IV QF guns on the ship's centreline, with one on the forecastle, one aft on a raised platform and one between the second and third funnels. A single 2-pounder (40 mm) pom-pom anti-aircraft gun was carried, while torpedo armament consisted of two twin mounts for torpedoes. Fire control included a single Dumaresq and a Vickers range clock. The ship had a complement of 82 officers and men. ==Service== On commissioning, Torrid joined the 10th Destroyer Flotilla of the Harwich Force. Torrid remained part of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla at the end of the war, but was reduced to the Crew on 20 October 1919. During the 1930s, Torrid was used as a trial ship for new anti-submarine weapons. The ship was equipped with ASDIC in 1930, and successfully demonstrated that the system worked. Torrid subsequently used ASDIC to successfully find the sunken aircraft-carrying submarine on 3 February 1932. ASDIC went on to prove invaluable in the Battle of the Atlantic. The vessel was also used to trial a forward-firing anti-submarine mortar with less success. During this time, between 18 December 1930 and 10 July 1931, the destroyer was commanded by Charles Pizey, later the first Chief of the Naval Staff of the Indian Navy. Torrid was considered as part of the planned Royal Navy deployment in defence of traffic between Port Said and Alexandria on 19 October 1935 after the start of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War but was retired before the outbreak of hostilities between Italy and the British Empire. The destroyer was handed over to Thos W Ward of Sheffield in 27 January 1937 in exchange for RMS Majestic. However, while being towed to the breakers on 16 March 1937, the ship ran aground onto rocks at Trefusis, Falmouth. The wreck was broken up and scrapped in situ, but remains of interest to divers. The ship's plaque, bearing the motto, is held by the Imperial War Museum. ==Pennant numbers== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:left\" !Pennant Number !Date |- |F75||1917 |- |F80||1918 |- |H81||1930 |- |} ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * Category:1917 ships Category:Ships built on the River Tyne Category:R-class destroyers (1916) Category:World War I destroyers of the United Kingdom Category:Maritime incidents in 1937 ",
