Bernie Sanders won the Independent Party of Oregon's presidential primary, but could not run due to sore-loser legislation and the Independent Party of Oregon chose to not nominate a presidential candidate. The Independence Party of Minnesota gave its presidential nomination to Evan McMullin. The Alliance Party was formed on October 14, 2018. On December 17, 2018, the American Party of South Carolina successfully asked the South Carolina Election Commission to record that the party had changed its name to the Alliance Party. On May 4, 2019, the Independence Party of Minnesota voted to affiliate with the Alliance party at its state convention. The Independent Party of Connecticut also affiliated with the Alliance Party and the Alliance Party became ballot qualified in Mississippi. ===2020 presidential election=== On April 25, 2020, the party nominated Rocky De La Fuente for president and Darcy Richardson for vice president. The ticket was approved by a vote of twenty four to two. Greg Orman, Brian Moore, and Michael Steinberg attended the presidential nomination convention that was conducted through Zoom. On June 23, the Natural Law Party of Michigan nominated De La Fuente and Richardson. On August 15, the American Independent Party nominated De La Fuente, but chose Kanye West rather than Richardson as their vice-presidential nominee. ==References== Category:Centrist political parties in the United States Category:Political parties established in 2018 ",
