David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 29, 2016\"Diocese of Perpignan-Elne\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016 The diocese comprises the Department of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales. This see continues the old Diocese of Elne,Or diocese of Elna, Catalan name. which was renamed and had its see relocated at Perpignan, in 1601 after a papal bull of Pope Clement VIII.Perpignan-Elne (Diocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy] Its territory brought together the Diocese of Elne, part of the Spanish Diocese of Urgel known as French Cerdagne, three cantons of the Diocese of Alet, and two villages of the Diocese of Narbonne. The Diocese of Elne was a suffragan of the Diocese of Narbonne until 1511. Pope Julius II made the Diocese of Elne directly subject to the Holy See in 1511, but on 22 January 1517 Pope Leo X reversed the policy, and the Diocese of Elne became again a suffragan of the Diocese of Narbonne.Gallia christiana VI (1739), Instrumenta, pp. 492-497. In 1482, by virtue of a Decree of the Council of Trent, Pope Gregory XIII made it a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Tarragona.Gallia christiana VI (1739), p. 1030. After 1678 it was again a suffragan of the Diocese of Narbonne. The department of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales was united in 1802 to the Diocese of Carcassonne. The diocese was to be reestablished by the Concordat of 11 June 1817, but the French Parliament did not approve the treaty. The Diocese of Perpignan was therefore re-established by papal bull in 1822, and was made suffragan to the Archdiocese of Albi. Its see is the Perpignan Cathedral (French: Basilique-Cath\u00e9drale de Saint-Jean- Baptiste de Perpignan; Catalan: Catedral de Sant Joan Baptista de Perpiny\u00e0). ==History== The Diocese of Elne is created in the 6th century. The first known Bishop of Elne is Dominus, mentioned in 571 in the Chronicle of John of Biclarum. Among others are Cardinal Ascanio Maria Sforza (1494\u201395), Cardinal Caesar Borgia (1495\u201398), Cardinal Francisco Lloris y de Borja (1499-1506), Cardinal Jacques de Serra (1506\u201312), Cardinal Girolamo Doria (1530\u201333); and Bishop Olympe-Philippe Gerbet (1854\u201364). The Cathedral of Elne (eleventh century) and the adjoining cloister are rich examples of elaborate medieval ornamentation. In the later Middle Ages, and under the influence of Roman Law, Roussillon witnessed revivals of slavery; this is proved by numerous purchase deeds of Muslim and Christian slaves, dating back to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The diocese honours especially St. Vincent de Collioure, martyr (end of the third century); and St. Eulalia and St. Julia, virgins and martyrs (end of third century). In memory of former ties with the metropolis of Tarragona, the Church of Perpignan honours several Spanish saints: St. Fructuosus, Bishop of Tarragona, and his deacons Augurius and Eulogius, martyred at Tarragona in 259; some martyrs of the Diocletian persecution (end of third century); Justa and Rufina of Seville; Felix and Narcissus of Gerona; Aciselus and Victoria of Cordova; Leocadia, of Toledo; St. Ildefonsus (607-67), Archbishop of Toledo. After becoming Bishop of Elne in 1495, Caesar Borgia decides to raise the taxes on the clergy, resulting in an uprising in 1497. Those same taxes are cut in two the following year, after the clergy complained to the king. The Benedictine Dom Briard (1743-1828), who continued the series of Historiens de France, belonged to Perpignan. At Perpignan Pope Benedict XIII (Pedro de Luna) held a council 1 November 1408, to rally his partisans; they gradually melted away and on 1 February 1409, the eighteen remaining bishops advised the antipope to send ambassadors to Pisa to negotiate with Pope Gregory XII. Numerous councils were held at Elne: in 1027 (the Synod of Toulouges), 1058, 1114,The meeting, which was a judicial assembly, summoned by mandate of Pope Paschal II, and presided over by Bishop Petrus Bernardi of Elne, was held on 2 January 1114: J. D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio Tomus XXV, pp. 90-91. 1335, 1337, 1338, 1339, 1340, and 1380. The council held in 1027 decreed that no one should attack his enemy from Saturday at nine o'clock to Monday at one; and that Holy Mass be said for the excommunicated for a space of three months, to obtain their conversion. The author of l'Art de verifier les Dates wrongly maintains that the Council of Elvira was held at Elne. The chief places of pilgrimage of the diocese are: Notre-Dame du Ch\u00e2teau d'Ultr\u00e9ra, at Sor\u00e8de; Notre-Dame de Consolation, at Collioure; Notre-Dame de Font Romeu, at Odeillo; Notre-Dame de Forca-R\u00e9al, near Millas; Notre-Dame de Juigues, near Rivesaltes; the relics of Sts. Abdon and Sennen at Arles on the Tech. ==Bishops== ===To 1000=== * Domnus (c. 571)Jean Capeille, Dictionnaire de biographies roussillonnaises (1914) * Benenatus (c. 589)He was present at the Third Council of Toledo: * Acutulus (c. 633 to 638) * Witaricus (c. 656) * ClarusBishop Clarus sent his Vicar Veremundus to the Council of Toledo in 683.
