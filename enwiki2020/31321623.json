    "text": "Shine is Cancer Research UK's night-time walking marathon which uses light as a symbol of hope and the progress being made in the fight against cancer. Participants can choose to walk either or to raise awareness and funds for Cancer Research UK. It is a unique fundraising event where those taking part can choose which cancer they want to beat and raise money for that area of cancer research. In 2011 there will be Shine events in three cities in the UK - Glasgow, Manchester and London. == See also == *Race for Life *List of health related charity fundraisers ==External links== *Shine official site *Cancer Research UK Category:Cancer fundraisers Category:Charity events in the United Kingdom Category:Challenge walks ",
