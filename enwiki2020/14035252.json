    "text": "Jacobs Pond is a pond in Norwell, Massachusetts. The pond is located alongside Assinippi, a village in neighboring Hanover. Route 123 runs along the southern shore of the pond. The pond is the headwaters of Third Herring Brook, a tributary of the North River which is the town line between Norwell and the eastern boundary of Hanover. The water quality is impaired due to non-native aquatic plants and non-native fish in the pond. The South Shore Natural Science Center is located near this pond. ==External links== *Environmental Protection Agency *South Shore Coastal Watersheds - Lake Assessments *South Shore Natural Science Center Category:Ponds of Plymouth County, Massachusetts Category:Ponds of Massachusetts ",
