Research at the IBMC is developed through two main lines of research: Molecular and Cellular Design and Molecular Diagnosis and Therapy. The Institute carries out intense translational and transferable technology research programs that have led to more than 20 registered patents and the creation of spin-off companies. ==== Institute \"Center of Operations Research\" ==== The University Research Institute \"Center of Operations Research\" (CIO) was established to support R&D; activities in statistics, optimization and information technologies. The CIO comprises researchers from different fields (statistics, mathematics, computer engineering and marketing), forming a qualified interdisciplinary group capable of solving problems currently found in the business environment. The CIO continually searches for ways to improve the quality, efficiency and productivity in both public institutions and private companies. ==== Institute of Neurosciences ==== The Institute of Neurosciences (IN) is a joint UMH and CSIC research center devoted to the study of the structure, function and development of the nervous system under normal and pathological conditions. The IN is organized into three research units that include Developmental Neurobiology, Molecular Neurobiology and Cellular and Systems Neurobiology. Research groups at the IN use a wide variety of techniques covering the fields of molecular and cell biology, genetics and physiology. ==== Institute of Bioengineering ==== The Institute of Bioengineering (IB) focuses on the following areas: cell regenerative therapy, genetics of plant development, cell physiology, biomaterials, biomedical instrumentation, telemedicine, structural and functional genomics, toxicology and chemical safety, neurotoxicity and embryotoxicity, synthesis and design of organic molecules and polymers with biological and electronic applications, cell banks, clinical trials and drug monitoring. ==== Drug Addiction Research Institute ==== The Drug Addiction Research Institute (INID) is fundamentally oriented towards the development of research, education and application of programs and resources, through the provision of services and technical assessment for public and/or private entities that may require them in relation to all problems related to drug addiction. The INID approaches the problems of drug addiction through three research blocks: prevention, assistance, and reinsertion. ==== The Mediterranean Center for Environmental Studies ==== The Mediterranean Center for Environmental Studies (CEAM) is an institute of applied research created with the aim of undertaking R&D; projects in environmental issues of special relevance for the Valencia Autonomous Community and the Mediterranean region. The CEAM houses the European Photoreactor (EUROPHORE), one of the largest simulation chambers for studying atmospheric chemistry processes. Other areas include the evaluation of plant injuries caused by air pollution, the study and forecasting of extreme weather phenomena, the study of climate change and the carbon cycle, the fight against desertification and the restoration of ecosystems affected by forest fires. Scientific and Business Park, UMH === Scientific and Business Park === The Scientific and Business Park at the UMH is managed by the Fundaci\u00f3n Qu\u00f3rum. The Park has four areas of specialization: the Biotechnological Business Innovation Centre (CIEB); ILINOVA, ICTs and Consulting; ILITEK, Engineering; and AGROTEC, focusing on the field of agriculture and horticulture. Residing at the Park are an extensive number of innovative businesses from sectors including biotechnology and health sciences, ICTs and industrial technologies, aeronautics, agro food, socioeconomics, etc. The businesses installed at the park have a series of value-added services at their disposal, like the search for technological partners, assistance in the search for public and private financing, administrative area outsourcing, assistance in business strategy and management, access to the UMH library and databases, etc. The Park is a member of the Association of Science and Technology Parks of Spain (APTE), the International Association of Science Parks (IASP), and a member of the Network of Valencian Science Parks (rePCV). It actively collaborates with the Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI), being a node in the Network of R&D; Information Points, as well as with the High Council of Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Navigation of Spain.

To accomplish this, the University has increased the number of agreements it has with foreign universities in recent years, which in turn has resulted in an increment of incoming and outgoing students and exchanges of faculty and researchers. The UMH is continuously interested in fostering its international relations and expanding its number of foreign partners. The UMH organizes language courses in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish as a foreign language. In fact, interested students can take the DELE examination, the Diploma de Espa\u00f1ol como Lengua Extranjera (Diploma of Spanish as a Foreign Language), at the UMH, which is a certification from the Cervantes Institute with international recognition. ==References== ==External links== * Universidad Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez * Universidad Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez (English) Category:Universities in the Valencian Community Category:Educational institutions established in 1997 Category:Elche ",
