She has also earned a postgraduate diploma in Animation Filmmaking from Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning. == Artistic career == In 1987 Channer, along with painter Lynne Fernie, photographer Cyndra MacDowall, and filmmaker Marg Moores contributed to an exhibit titled Sight Specific: Lesbians and Representation. The exhibit explored connections between lesbian and artistic identities, relationships, narratives and politics. The same year, Channer was one of six artists invited to participate in a site-specific mural project, Women On Site, curated by Sarah Denison for the A Space Community Arts Committee. Channer's mural, titled \"Black Women Working\", was located at the Parkdale Library in Toronto. Channer curated the travelling exhibition Black Wimmin: When and Where We Enter with Buseje Bailey in 1989. She is the subject, alongside artist Faith Nolan, of Dionne Brand's 1993 documentary film, Long Time Comin', which explores the activism inherent in the practice of both artists. Channer is a member of the W5ART Collective, an artist collective established in 2011 by Buseje Bailey, Grace Channer, Alexandra Gelis, Margie Macdonald and Alexandra Majerus. In 2012, Channer was one of three artists, along with Sandra Brewster and Jay Stewart, who painted a 100-foot long mural celebrating women in visual and martial arts. Located in the East-end of Toronto, the public art piece is titled KIA: Unified Movement of Power, and it celebrates the strength of martial arts movement. == Exhibitions == \"Who Will Fight For Our Liberation,\" Power Plant Gallery, 1992. == References == == External links == * Visual Artists Biographies, York University, African Canadian Online * Canadian Filmmakers Distribution Centre: Grace Channer * National Film Board of Canada: Long Time Comin' Category:1959 births Category:Canadian multimedia artists Category:Living people Category:Queen's University at Kingston alumni Category:York University alumni Category:21st-century Canadian painters Category:Lesbian artists Category:British emigrants to Canada Category:Black Canadian women Category:21st-century Canadian women artists ",
