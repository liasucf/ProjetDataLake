    "text": "Location of Hemimont Plateau on the Antarctic Peninsula. Northeast Glacier is a steep, heavily crevassed glacier on the west side of Hemimont Plateau, long and wide at its mouth, which flows from McLeod Hill westward and then south- westwards into Marguerite Bay between the Debenham Islands and Roman Four Promontory, on the west coast of Graham Land, Antarctica. Northeast Glacier was first surveyed in 1936 by the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE) under John Riddoch Rymill. It was resurveyed in 1940 by members of the United States Antarctic Service (USAS), who first used the glacier as a sledging route, and so named by them because it lay on the north-eastern side of their base at Stonington Island. == Yapey\u00fa Refuge == Yapey\u00fa Refuge () is an Argentine Antarctic refuge nearby San Mart\u00edn Base from which it depends. It is located on the Falli\u00e8res Coast in the Antarctic Peninsula. The refuge was inaugurated on November 4, 1956 as logistical support and is administered by the Argentine Army. The shelter is located at 600 meters above the Northeast Glacier. In 1956, during the installation of the San Mart\u00edn Base, the Argentine Army built three refuges in order to have logistical support from Marguerite Bay, in the Bellingshausen Sea, to the Weddell Sea crossing the Antarctic Peninsula from west to east. The three refuges were built: the Chacabuco, the Yapey\u00fa and the Maip\u00fa. The project took 63 days, travelling about 786 kilometres using sled pulled by dogs. The refuge has food, equipment, medicines and fuel and was used for scientific projects carried out in the 1957-1958 International Geophysical Year. The refuge pay homage to Yapey\u00fa, the birthplace of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn. ==See also== * Blow-me-down Bluff * List of glaciers in the Antarctic * List of Antarctic field camps ==References== Northeast Glacier as seen from San Mart\u00edn Base Category:Glaciers of Falli\u00e8res Coast ",
