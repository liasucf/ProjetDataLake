Current Cedar Rapids Mayor Ron Corbett announced the creation of a commission to rename a major Cedar Rapids landmark in honor of Canney. Possible choices for the memorial which have been mentioned include an airport terminal at Eastern Iowa Airport, a former federal court which is being re-purposed to become Cedar Rapids' future city hall, or the city library. Corbett explained that, \"We\u2019re looking for something significant to have Don Canney\u2019s name associated with. Don was big into public infrastructure, so it only makes sense from the standpoint also.\" ==References== Category:1930 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Mayors of Cedar Rapids, Iowa Category:American civil engineers Category:American Marine Corps personnel of the Korean War Category:University of Iowa alumni ",
