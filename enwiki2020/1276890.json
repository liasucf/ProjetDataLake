    "text": "Ruth Closius-Neudeck was a Schutzstaffel (SS) supervisor at a Nazi concentration camp complex from December 1944 until March 1945. She was executed for war crimes. ==Early life== Ruth Closius was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wroc\u0142aw, Poland). She later married and was known as Ruth Neudeck or Ruth Closius-Neudeck. ==Camp work== In July 1944, she arrived at the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp to begin her training to be a camp guard. Neudeck soon began impressing her superiors with her unbending brutality towards the female prisoners, resulting in her promotion to the rank of Blockf\u00fchrerin (Barrack Overseer) in late July 1944. In the Ravensbr\u00fcck camp, she was known as one of the most ruthless female guards. Former French prisoner Genevi\u00e8ve de Gaulle-Anthonioz commented after the war that she had seen Neudeck \"cut the throat of an inmate with the sharp edge of her shovel\". In December 1944, she was promoted to the rank of Oberaufseherin, and moved to the Uckermark extermination complex down the road from Ravensbr\u00fcck. There she involved herself in the selection and execution of over 5,000 women and children. The prisoners were mistreated by Neudeck or her fellow SS Aufseherinnen. In March 1945, Neudeck became head of the Barth subcamp. ==Capture and execution== In late April 1945, she fled the camp but was later captured and detained in prison while the British Army investigated the allegations against her. In April 1948, she stood accused at the third Ravensbr\u00fcck Trial, along with other Schutzstaffel (SS) women. The 28-year-old former SS supervisor admitted to the accusations of murder and maltreatment made against her.Jone, Phillip (2010) Quickly To Her Fate. Lulu.com. . The British court found Neudeck guilty of war crimes and sentenced her to death by hanging.
