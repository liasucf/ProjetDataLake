    "text": "thumb Heinrich Koppers (November 23, 1872 \u2013 September 5, 1941) was a German engineer. Koppers developed a new type of coke oven that economically recovered the byproduct chemicals of the coking process. The design of these ovens was superior to other ovens. Having previously worked at other German companies, he founded his own company Heinrich Koppers AG in 1901 to successfully exploit the patents he had been granted in the area of coke oven design. The headquarters of Heinrich Koppers AG were in Essen - Moltkeviertel, adjacent to the mansion of the Koppers family (both buildings built in 1911). former headquarters of Heinrich Koppers AG; enlarge image to read inscription above front door; picture of 2009 Villa Koppers: former residence of the Heinrich Koppers family; picture of 2009 After meeting with US Steel in 1907, Koppers agreed to build a coke plant in the United States and formed the H. Koppers Company. In 1912, the H. Koppers Company was incorporated to be Koppers Inc. in Chicago, Illinois, an industrial organization which moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States in 1914. In 1914, Koppers sold his controlling stake in Koppers Inc. to industrialist Andrew Mellon for $300,000. == See also == * Koppers ==References== ==External links== *Heinrich Koppers in German Wikipedia *Heinrich Koppers AG in German Wikipedia Category:1872 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Organizations based in Pittsburgh Category:Coke ovens Category:Engineers from Essen ",
