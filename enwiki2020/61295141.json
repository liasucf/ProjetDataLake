    "text": "Bazirgan and Bezirgan are the Turkish forms of the Persian B\u0101zarg\u0101n, meaning \"merchant\". In Ottoman Turkish, the term B\u0101zirg\u0101n was used to denote merchants of Christian and especially Jewish origin. Some of these Christian and Jewish merchants held office in the Ottoman palace or Ottoman army. For instance, the Bazirgan-bashi functioned as chief purveyor of textiles to the Imperial Ottoman household. The Odjak-B\u0101zirg\u0101ni, in practise a steward, was usually of Greek or Jewish origins, and was responsible for handling the salaries and supplies of the Janissary corps. The office of Odjak-B\u0101zirg\u0101ni became a hereditary post amongst certain families. ==References== ==Sources== * Category:Ottoman titles Category:Ottoman society Category:Turkish words and phrases Category:Ottoman merchants ",
