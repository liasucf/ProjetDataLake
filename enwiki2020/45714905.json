    "text": "Nicolas Guigon (born October 10, 1980 in \u00c9chirolles) is a French pole vaulter. Representing his nation France in the men's pole vault at the 2004 Summer Olympics, Guigon cleared a height at 5.75 metres to set his own personal best from the national athletics meet in Reims. Throughout his sporting career, Guigon trained for the track and field club ASPTT Grenoble, under his personal coach, 1991 Mediterranean Games champion, and two-time Olympian Philippe d'Encausse (1988 and 1992). Guigon qualified for the French squad in the men's pole vault at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Two months before the Games, he registered a personal best clearance and an Olympic A-standard of 5.75 m to secure a spot on the French team at the national athletics meet in Reims. During the prelims, Guigon started off with a single foul, until he successfully surpassed 5.30 m on the second attempt. Failing to clear his next targeted height of 5.50 m after three straight misses, Guigon shared a thirty- first spot with Poland's Adam Kolasa throughout the overall standings, and did not advance past the qualifying round. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:French male pole vaulters Category:Olympic athletes of France Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:People from \u00c9chirolles Category:Sportspeople from Is\u00e8re ",
