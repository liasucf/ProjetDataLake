    "text": "Penny, Lady Stewart (n\u00e9e Lancaster; born 15 March 1971), is an English model, photographer and TV personality. She is married to rock singer Sir Rod Stewart. In 2014, she joined the ITV lunchtime show Loose Women. ==Early life== Lancaster was brought up by parents Graham and Sally who were both regular gym-goers and encouraged a love of fitness. She also has a brother named Oliver. At the age of six, Lancaster took up dance, learning tap, ballet and modern but decided to quit at the age of 16 due to her height and decided aerobics would better suit her frame. Six years later Lancaster became a certified fitness trainer. It was during this time that she was spotted by a model scout who suggested she should consider a career in modelling. Lancaster suffers from chronic sweat problem called hyperhidrosis. ==Career== ===Early career=== Throughout the 1990s, Lancaster was in a long-term relationship with city trader Mickey Sloan. They lived in Bermuda from 1996 to 1998 but separated in 1999. Around this time, Lancaster decided to learn about the other side of modelling and began taking photography classes. ===Ultimo=== In 2002, Lancaster signed up to be the face of designer lingerie brand Ultimo for a reported \u00a3200,000. Although she was a success at promoting the brand - raising its profile, especially in the United Kingdom - two years later, Lancaster's contract was not renewed. She was replaced in the role by Rod Stewart's ex-wife Rachel Hunter. The decision, dubbed \"Bra Wars\" by the British press, was seen as a publicity stunt which infuriated Stewart who described the money-grabber as \"manipulative\". However, two of Stewart's daughters - Kimberly and Ruby - have since modelled for Ultimo. ===Strictly Come Dancing=== Lancaster was announced as one of the fourteen celebrities taking part in the fifth series of Strictly Come Dancing in 2007. In week 4, she was revealed as one of the bottom two participants. She and her partner (Ian Waite) were in the week six dance-off with Matt Di Angelo and were voted off.
