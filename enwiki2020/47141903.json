    "text": "Indivisible is an action role-playing-platform game developed by the now- defunct Lab Zero Games and published by 505 Games. The game was initially released in October 2019 and on Nintendo Switch on April 28, 2020. It was released in Japan on July 16, 2020. On October 9, 2020, 505 Games announced the cancellation of all future updates and content for Indivisible following the dissolution of Lab Zero Games. ==Gameplay== Indivisible features platform- style action RPG exploration and combat mechanics inspired by Valkyrie Profile. ==Plot== The game begins with a battle between a group of warriors led by Indr (voiced by Keith Silverstein) and the goddess Kala (voiced by Anjali Bhimani). The battle ends with Kala being defeated and sealed on Mount Sumeru while Indr finds an abandoned baby they call Ajna (voiced by Tania Gunadi) and raises her as his own daughter. 16 years later, Ajna lives with her father in the village of Ashwat until it is attacked by an army led by Dhar (voiced by Benjamin Diskin), who kills her father. After defeating Dhar, Ajna uses her newly awakened power to absorb him into her mind and forces him to take her to his leader, the warlord Ravannavar (voiced by Michael Dorn) who ordered the attack. While gaining more companions, Ajna eventually confronts and chases Ravannavar to Mount Sumeru where she kills him, unaware that Ravannavar's intention was to use her power to unseal Kala, given that she is a part of her body, so that she destroys and recreates the world. After being cast out of Sumeru, Ajna and her companions are rescued by the Deva Thorani (voiced by Zehra Fazal), who guides her to the nearby port, where she meets Angwu (voiced by Laura Patalano) a former member of Indr's party who instructs Ajna to look for several chakra gates around the world and activate them so that she increases her power in preparation to face Kala in battle. After doing so, Ajna returns to Sumeru despite being warned by her friends that she may be not ready yet, and while facing Kala, she loses herself to anger, becoming a monster that causes massive destruction until a reformed Dhar sacrifices himself to stop her. One week later, Ajna recovers and determined to atone for her mistakes, travels the world again to regroup with her friends, while helping solve some problems she unwillingly caused during her previous journey, and returns to Sumeru for a final battle with Kala. In the occasion, Ajna bids farewell to her companions and convinces Kala to give up on destroying the world, the two merging together and disappearing. In the post credits, an image of Ajna is seen, living a new life while merged with Kala. ==Development== Indivisible was announced by Lab Zero Games during their Skullgirls panel at the Anime Expo on July 2, 2015. According to the developer, the game's storyline was influenced by southeast Asian mythology and other cultures. It also features 2D hand-drawn animation by Lab Zero Games' artists. Composer Hiroki Kikuta, best known for his work on Secret of Mana, scored the game's soundtrack. The game features animation by Japanese anime studio Trigger and American animation studio Titmouse, Inc., with the opening animation directed by Yoh Yoshinari of Little Witch Academia. Lab Zero Games launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo on October 5, 2015, with a goal of . A playable prototype of the game was released in tandem with the launch. If Lab Zero Games met or exceeded their goal, publisher 505 Games would contribute their remaining development budget. The campaign's initial 40-day contribution period faced relatively sluggish fundraising, earning approximately $764,000 by November 8, 2015. However, on November 13, 2015, the campaign was extended for an additional 20 days after the game received roughly 963,000 in pledges, above Indiegogo's required 60% threshold. Following the extension, the goal was eventually reached on December 2, 2015. The game was released on October 8, 2019 in North America and released three days later in Europe. The game was eventually released on Nintendo Switch on April 28, 2020. However, this was done without any input from Lab Zero Games and was instead given a surprise release by a porting group. As a result, the game's launch was given no prior announcement and came as a surprise even to the original developers. Additionally, the Switch version was also launched missing features that were added through updates, such as co-operative play and New Game+ mode. This was due to the game accidentally launching on its original planned release date, rather than being delayed to early May 2020 as was intended. On October 9, 2020, 505 Games announced the cancellation of all future updates and content for Indivisible following the dissolution of Lab Zero Games. ==Animated series== On July 17, 2020, it was announced that an animated adaptation of Indivisible was in development and would be released on the Peacock streaming service. The series was to be produced by DJ2 Entertainment and Legendary Television. ==Reception== Both the PlayStation 4 and PC versions of Indivisible received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to Metacritic. Joe Juba of Game Informer praised the game's art style, animation, music and combat but criticized the backtracking and some other issues with the combat. ===Accolades=== The game was nominated for \"Character Design\" and \"Game, Original Role Playing\" at the NAVGTR Awards. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 video games Category:505 Games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Crossover video games Category:Crowdfunded video games Category:Indie video games Category:Indiegogo projects Category:Linux games Category:Mac OS games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Platform games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Single- player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games scored by Hiroki Kikuta Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Television series by Universal Animation Studios ",
