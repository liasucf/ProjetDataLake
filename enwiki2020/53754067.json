The following is a list of rulers currently known from the history of the ancient Levantine kingdom Ammon. Ammon was originally ruled by a king, called the \"king of the children of Ammon\" (Ammonite: \ud802\udd0c\ud802\udd0b\ud802\udd0a \ud802\udd01\ud802\udd0d\ud802\udd0f\ud802\udd0c\ud802\udd0d; '). After the conquest of the Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid Empires, Ammon was maintained by an administrator ( ', literally \"servant\"; h\u0113go\u00famenos, \"leader\"). Only a modest number of Ammonite kings are known today, mostly from the Bible and epigraphic inscriptions. ==Rulers of Ammon== ===Kings of Ammon=== * unnamed Ammonite king of \\---- * Nahash ( N\u0101\u1e25\u0101\u0161; mid eleventh century B.C.) * Hanun son of Nahash ( \u1e24\u0101n\u00fbn; early tenth century B.C.) * Shobi son of Nahash ( \u0160\u014db\u00ee; early tenth century B.C.) \\---- * Rehob (; c. 850s B.C.) * Baasha son of Rehob (; 853 B.C.) \\---- * Shanip (Ammonite: \u0160eneb; ; c. 734 B.C.) * Zacchur son of Shanip (Ammonite: Zakk\u00fbr)Tentatively based on the inscription Y\u0259ra\u1e25\u02bf\u0101z\u0101r [bar Za]kk\u00fbr bar \u0160enebh, \"Jeraheazar [son of Za]cchur son of Shanib\". * Jeraheazar son of Zacchur (Ammonite: Y\u0259ra\u1e25\u02bf\u0101z\u0101r)Variously interpreted Y\u0259ra\u1e25\u02bf\u0101z\u0101r or Yari\u1e25-\u02bfezer. \\---- * Peduel (Ammonite: P\u0259d\u00fb\u02be\u0113l; ; c. 720s B.C.)Variously interpreted P\u0259d\u00fb\u02be\u0113l (also written Pad\u00f4\u02be\u0113l), P\u0103d\u0101\u02be\u0113l, or P\u0259d\u0101\u02be\u0113l. \\---- * Barachel ( B\u0101rak\u02be\u0113l; c. 670s) \\---- * Amminadab I (Ammonite: \u02bfAmm\u00een\u0101d\u0101b; c. 650 B.C.) * Hissalel son of Amminadab (Ammonite: H\u0259\u1e63al\u02be\u0113l; c. 620 B.C.)Variously interpreted Hi\u1e63al\u02be\u0113l (\"Hissalel\"), Ha\u1e63al\u02be\u0113l (\"Hassalel\"), or Ha\u1e63il\u02be\u0113l (\"Hasilel\"). * Amminadab II son of Hissalel (c. 600 B.C.) \\---- * Baalis ( Ba\u02bf\u0103l\u00ees; 580s B.C.) ===Administrators of Ammon=== * Tobiah ( \u1e6c\u014dbhiyy\u0101h; fifth century B.C.) * Timothy ( Tim\u00f3theos; second century B.C.) ==See also== * List of rulers of Moab * List of rulers of Edom * Ammon * Lot (biblical person) ==References== Category:Ammon ",
