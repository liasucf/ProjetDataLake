The victims \u2013 a middle-aged man killed at home, a dead woman found in the trash dump, and a teenage girl slain in the park \u2013 were all killed in grisly manners, but they didn't seem related to each other. Without any clue to follow up on, Tam is decidedly at his wits' end. But when Chak is seriously wounded by a mysterious assailant, Tam deduces that the only way to uncover the truth is to get into the mind of the deranged killer, and in so doing he is forced to face a long-hidden side of himself. ==Cast== * Aaron Kwok as Tam * Liu Kai-chi as Inspector Fung Chak * Patrick Tam as Inspector Lo * Cheung Siu-fai as Leung Wai Yip * Gong Beibi as Ling Ho-yee * Izz Xu as Ling Ka-fai ==Release== The film was released in Hong Kong on 12 May 2011. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2011 films Category:Hong Kong films Category:2011 crime thriller films Category:Hong Kong crime thriller films Category:Detective films Category:Films directed by Oxide Pang Category:Cantonese-language films Category:Hong Kong sequel films Category:Films set in Bangkok Category:Films shot in Bangkok ",
