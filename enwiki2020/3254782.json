He has received the T\u00f3mas Gu\u00f0mundsson Award, Halld\u00f3r Laxness Literature Award, and in 1996 was nominated for the Icelandic Literature Prize.Iceland literature site Bjarni's early work was self-published, and did not receive much attention. However, his 1996 novel Endurkoma Mar\u00edu ('The Return of Mary) was a critical success: 'the novel is a fantastic tale of an unusually talented young woman and an unusual young man who loves her from afar. It takes place in several cities that show distinct similarities to certain European cities but are clearly illusory spaces'.\u00c1str\u00e1\u00f0ur Eysteinsson and \u00dafhildur Dagsd\u00f3ttir, 'Icelandic Prose Literature, 1940--2000', in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. by Daisy Nejmann, History of Scandinavian literatures, 5 (University of Nebraska Press: 2007), pp. 404--70 (p. 451). In the estimation of \u00c1str\u00e1\u00f0ur Eysteinsson and \u00dafhildur Dagsd\u00f3ttir, 'Time is an important element in all his novels; their imagery is influenced by ancient myths and invested with a fairy tale atmosphere while simultaneously referring to modern phenomena.'\u00c1str\u00e1\u00f0ur Eysteinsson and \u00dafhildur Dagsd\u00f3ttir, 'Icelandic Prose Literature, 1940--2000', in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. by Daisy Nejmann, History of Scandinavian literatures, 5 (University of Nebraska Press: 2007), pp. 404--70 (p. 451). ==Works== Works are novels unless otherwise stated. * H\u00e1lfsnert st\u00falka 2014 * Nakti vonbi\u00f0illinn 2012 * Mannor\u00f0 2011 (translated into English as The Reputation).Trans. by David McDuff (Gainsborough: Red Hand Books, 2017), . https://www.redhandbooks.co.uk/the-reputation/. * Bo\u00f0skort \u00ed \u00fej\u00f3\u00f0arveislu 2009 (essays) * Leitin a\u00f0 Audrey Hepburn 2009 * Draugah\u00f6ndin 2008 (children's book) * Bernhar\u00f0ur N\u00fall 2007 * Andlit: sk\u00e1ld\u00e6visaga 2003 * Mann\u00e6tukonan og ma\u00f0ur hennar 2001 * N\u00e6turv\u00f6r\u00f0ur kyrr\u00f0arinnar 1999 * Borgin bak vi\u00f0 or\u00f0in 1998 * Endurkoma Mar\u00edu: sk\u00e1ldsaga 1996 (translated into English as The Return of the Divine Mary.The Return of the Divine Mary, trans. by David McDuff (Reykjav\u00edk: Uppheimar, 2007), repr.
