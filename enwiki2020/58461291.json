    "text": "The Cabangu Museum () is a museum in the town of Santos Dumont, Brazil. It is dedicated to the memory of Santos Dumont, the \"Father of Aviation\". In the house, personal objects, photos and the aviation museum are still preserved. In the Museum are also deposited the ashes of the first woman pilot of the Brazilian aviation, An\u00e9sia Pinheiro Machado. == Cabangu == There are three versions for the meaning of the word \"Cabangu\": *The first, somewhat folkloric, comes from the transformation of the phrase \"The angu is over\" (in Portuguese: Acabou o angu), used by the old residents at the time of the construction of the railroad in the region, that with the passage of time became Cabangu. *The second, would be a place where, at the time of the Inconfid\u00eancia Mineira, a caboclo lived with the surname \"Cabangu\". *The third, whose etymology would originate in the Tupi-Guarani, name of the beginning of the Mantiqueira region: \"Caa (woods) / bangu (dark). ==Financial problems== The Museum has been suffering from lack of cash, labor debts and inability to maintain and restore content. The institution even tried to make crowdfunding, but has been closed a few times for lack of funds. ==See also== *Timeline of aviation ==References== ==External links== *Official page in the Wayback Machine Category:Museums in Brazil Category:Aerospace museums in Brazil Category:Alberto Santos-Dumont Category:Museums in Minas Gerais Category:Biographical museums in Brazil Category:Houses in Brazil ",
