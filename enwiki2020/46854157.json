It is located high in the southern mountains of the island, and contains more than 40 images, rendered in paints that are white, red, brown, and black. The art was carefully analyzed in 2011, and a radiocarbon date of c. 600 CE was obtained from a paint sample. The meaning of the art is a subject of debate. The cave was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Guam ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Guam Category:Rock art of Oceania ",
