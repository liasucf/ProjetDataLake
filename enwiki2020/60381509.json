    "text": "Nerd Poker (formerly Nerd Poker with Brian Posehn and Friends, currently Brian Posehn's Nerd Poker) is a weekly comedy and adventure podcast that primarily features comedian Brian Posehn and his friends as they play the Dungeons & Dragons tabletop role-playing game. ==History== The show formally began releasing episodes in 2012 on the Earwolf network, but left the network to become independent. Co-hosts include comedians Blaine Capatch and Dan Telfer, actors Ken Daly and Chris Tallman, and writer Sarah Guzzardo. The podcast has alternated several co-hosts through the years, and stems from a real-life ongoing game that also included comedian Patton Oswalt. Former co-hosts Gerry Duggan, Sark, and Steve Agee have left the show but returned as guests. The show's dungeon master (carrying over the tradition from before the show was on the air) was Sark. Later those duties were handed off to Blaine Capatch, then Dan Telfer. ==Format== The show originated using the second edition of Dungeons and Dragons, switched to fourth edition, went back to second, then finally settled on fifth edition when the show rebooted as an independent podcast in 2017. Though they have played the Tomb of Annihilation pre-made adventure for their Patreon supporters as bonus episodes, the majority of the podcast consists of stories created by the respective Dungeon Masters. Some bonus episodes have also featured \"Danger Rooms,\" one-off adventures nicknamed after the training room used by the X-Men. ==See also== * Critical Role ==References== Category:Talk podcasts Category:2012 podcast debuts Category:Dungeons & Dragons Category:Audio podcasts Category:Comedy and humor podcasts ",
