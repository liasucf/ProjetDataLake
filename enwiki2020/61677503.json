    "text": "Heteromysis (from Greek heteros meaning \u2018different\u2019, and mysis, a genus name Mysis) is a genus of marine mysid crustaceans (opossum shrimps) from the family Mysidae, associated with various shallow-water invertebrates. The name describes differentiation of its pereiopods (thoracic appendages) as possible adaptation to commensal life-style. Heteromysis is one of the largest mysid genera, containing more than 80 species. The genus is distributed globally, but predominantly in tropical and subtropical waters. Heteromysis Fosteri was named after South African filmmaker Craig Foster, after he had discovered eight new species of shrimp during a year of diving every single day while filming a common octopus. Three new species belong to Heteromysis and differ from species known at the time in colour, eye shape and spine patterns. ==References== Category:Mysida ",
