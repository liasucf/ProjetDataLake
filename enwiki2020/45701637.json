The wingspan is about 39 mm. Adults are pale reddish brown, the apex of the forewings blackish and two dark brown lines transverse the disc of the wing. The first is deflected to the median nervurem then inflected to the inner margin and the second runs from the costa towards the outer margin, where it joins a darker apical streak. There is also an obscure submarginal line and two small black central spots. The hindwings have two central dark brown lines, the first curved and the second straight. There is also slightly wavy dark brown submarginal line.Entomologist 23: 113 ==References== Category:Moths described in 1890 Category:Drepaninae ",
