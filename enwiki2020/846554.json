Roberts was named for Coxswain Samuel Booker Roberts, Jr., a Navy Cross recipient, who had been commended for voluntarily steering a Higgins boat towards enemy forces, in order to divert fire from evacuation efforts being undertaken by other friendly vessels. Samuel B. Roberts was laid down on 6 December 1943, at the Brown Shipbuilding Company of Houston, Texas. She was launched on 20 January 1944, sponsored by Mrs. Roberts, and was commissioned on 28 April 1944, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Robert W. Copeland, USNR. The Roberts was sunk in the Battle off Samar, in which a relatively small force of U.S. warships prevented a vastly superior Japanese force from attacking the amphibious invasion fleet off the large Philippine island of Leyte. The ship was part of a relatively light flotilla of destroyers, destroyer escorts, and escort carriers, called \"Taffy 3\", that was inadvertently left alone to fend off a fleet of heavily armed Japanese battleships, cruisers, and destroyers off the Island of Samar, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf of October 1944. Steaming aggressively through a gauntlet of incoming shells, Samuel B. Roberts scored one torpedo hit and numerous gunfire hits as she slugged it out with larger enemy warships before finally being sunk. After the battle, Samuel B. Roberts received the appellation \"the destroyer escort that fought like a battleship.\" She was the first of three U.S. Navy ships to bear Roberts' name. ==Service history== Samuel B. Roberts had a shakedown cruise off Bermuda from 21 May to 19 June 1944. After spending time at the Boston Navy Yard, Roberts departed for Norfolk, Virginia, on July 11. Roberts departed Norfolk on 22 July, going through the Panama Canal on 27 July. She joined the Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor on 10 August. Samuel B. Roberts conducted training exercises around the Hawaiian Islands, and then steamed out on 21 August with a convoy that reached Eniwetok Atoll on 30 August. On 2 September, Roberts steamed back to Pearl Harbor, arriving there with a convoy on 10 September. Following further training, the destroyer escort got underway on 21 September, escorted a convoy to Eniwetok, and arrived on 30 September. Roberts next proceeded to Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands of the Southwest Pacific, and then joined Task Unit 77.4.3, nicknamed \"Taffy 3\". From there she steamed to the Leyte Gulf area off the eastern Philippines, and upon arrival, she commenced operations with the Northern Air Support Group off the Island of Samar. ===The Battle off Samar=== Shortly after dawn on 25 October, Samuel B. Roberts was protecting Taffy 3's small escort carriers. These were serving as bases for small bombers and fighters that were supporting the Army assault. These warships were steaming off the eastern coast of Samar when the Japanese Center Force\u2014a 23-ship task force under the command of Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita\u2014suddenly appeared on the horizon and opened fire. At 07:35, Roberts turned and headed toward the battle. She charged toward the heavy cruiser . The commanding officer, Copeland, announced \"We're making a torpedo run. The outcome is doubtful, but we will do our duty.\" With smoke as cover, Roberts steamed to within of Ch\u014dkai, coming under fire from the cruiser's forward guns. Roberts had moved so close that the enemy guns could not depress enough to hit her and the shells simply passed overhead. Many hit the carrier . Once within torpedo range, she launched her three Mark 15 torpedoes. One blew off Ch\u014dkais stern. The American sailors cheered, \"That a way, Whitey, we hit 'em,\" as if it were a ballgame, as shells were still incoming. Roberts then fought with the Japanese ships for a further hour, firing more than six hundred shells, and while maneuvering at very close range, mauling Ch\u014dkais superstructure with her and anti-aircraft guns. At 08:51, the Japanese landed two hits, the second of which damaged the aft gun. This damaged gun suffered a breech explosion shortly thereafter which killed and wounded several crew members. With her remaining gun, Roberts set the bridge of the heavy cruiser on fire and destroyed the Number Three gun turret, before being hit by three shells from the battleship . The shells tore a hole long and wide in the port side of her aft engine room. Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Paul Carr Gunner's Mate Third Class Paul H. Carr was in charge of the aft gun mount, which had fired nearly all of its 325 stored rounds in 35 minutes before a breech explosion. Carr was found dying at his station from a severe intestinal wound, begging for help to load the last round he was holding into the breech. He had scored a great many hits on the heavy cruiser Chokai, also sunk that day. He was posthumously awarded a Silver Star, and a guided missile frigate was later named for him.Tincan Sailors p. 332. The guided missile frigates and were also named for the ship and its captain. At 09:35, the order was given to abandon ship. She sank 30 minutes later, with 90 of her sailors. The 120 survivors of the crew clung to three life rafts for 50 hours before being rescued. During the battle, Samuel B. Roberts\u2014designed for \u2014reached by raising pressure to and diverting all available steam to the ship's twin turbines.Hornfischer, James D. (2004). The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors.
