But construction was stopped because the tender to select the contractor was stopped by the city council in August 2015. The metro is not being built in Dnipropetrovsk because Filatov and Korban require \"kickbacks\", - Pashchenko, Ukrainian News Agency (17 August 2015) The station is named for its proximity next to the city's historical museum. The station was already envisioned in the 1980 official planning of the city's metro lines, the station referred to as \"Student\". The metro is being designed in Dnepropetrovsk (Metrostroy magazine No.5 1980), Dnipro Metropoliten (unfficial website of Dnipro Metro) It was originally scheduled to be opened in 1993, the station's construction was delayed significantly after the fall of the Soviet Union. Budget issues and economic instability in Ukraine further delayed the station's opening. The station is located deep underground in the center of Dnipro, and is located right after Tsentralna station, which is another station currently under construction. It is not known what final form the station will take on; whether it will be a deep column or a single-vault station. ==References== ==External links== * (Images of the station under construction) Category:Dnipro Metro stations ",
