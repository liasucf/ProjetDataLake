    "text": "The Green Line (), also known as Line 1, is one of the four lines of the Montreal Metro in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The line runs through the commercial section of downtown Montreal underneath Boulevard de Maisonneuve, formerly Rue de Montigny. It runs mainly on a northeast to southwest axis with a connection to the Orange and Yellow Lines at Berri-UQAM, and with the Orange Line west of downtown at Lionel-Groulx. The section between Atwater and Frontenac was part of the initial network; the line was extended to Honor\u00e9- Beaugrand in 1976 to provide easy access to 1976 Summer Olympics sites. It was extended to Angrignon in 1978. All but three stations \u2014 De L'\u00c9glise, Lionel- Groulx, and Charlevoix \u2014 are side platform stations. ==History== The first stations, found on the section between Atwater and Papineau, opened on October 14, 1966. Several smaller sections were delayed by several months. On December 19, 1966, the line was further extended from Papineau to Frontenac, and two days later came the stopover Beaudry between Berri-UQAM and Papineau. On December 20, 1967, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Back completed his art piece L'histoire de la musique \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (The history of music in Montreal) in Place-des-Arts station. This commissioned piece was the first artwork completed in the Metro system. The construction of the second phase began in 1971, when Montreal was awarded the bid to host the 1976 Summer Olympics. The goal was to have the ability to transport visitors from downtown to the Olympic Park in the east end. The opening of the section between Frontenac and Honor\u00e9-Beaugrand took place on June 6, 1976, six weeks before the start of the Summer Olympics. Green Line trains inaugurated an autopilot feature on November 8, 1976. The third expansion phase, between Atwater and Angrignon, came into operation on September 3, 1978. == Rolling stock == From the line's opening in 1966, MR-63 cars were used on the Green Line. Upon the introduction of the MR-73 cars on the Green Line in 1976, the older MR-63 cars were used on the Orange Line. From the early-1980s until 2018, MR-63 cars were once again in use on the Green Line. With the introduction of the newer MPM-10 trains (also known as Azur) in 2016 on the Orange line, the Green Line is now primarily served by both the MR-73 and MPM-10 cars. The MR-63 trains were fully retired on June 21, 2018. As of August 2019, all 54 Azur train sets were delivered. Of these, nine are running on the Green Line.. ==List of stations== {| class=\"wikitable centre\" |- ! scope=col |Station ! scope=col |Inauguration date ! scope=col |Odonym ! scope=col |Namesake !scope=col|Transfers/Connections !scope=col|Location |- |Angrignon |rowspan=8|September 3, 1978 |Angrignon Boulevard Angrignon Park |Jean-Baptiste Angrignon (Councillor of Montreal) | Terminus Angrignon |rowspan=\"3\"|Le Sud-Ouest |- |Monk |Monk Boulevard |James Monk (Attorney-General of Quebec) | |- |Jolicoeur |Jolic\u0153ur Street |Joseph-Mo\u00efse Jolic\u0153ur (parish priest) | |- |Verdun |De Verdun Street |Notre-Dame-de- Saverdun, France | |rowspan=\"3\"|Verdun |- |De l'\u00c9glise |De l'\u00c9glise Avenue |\u00c9glise Saint-Paul | |- |LaSalle |LaSalle Boulevard |Robert Cavelier de La Salle (French explorer) | |- |Charlevoix | Charlevoix Street |Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Xavier de Charlevoix (French historian and explorer) | |rowspan=\"2\"|Le Sud-Ouest |- |Lionel-Groulx |Lionel-Groulx Avenue |Lionel Groulx (Quebec historian) | Orange Line |- |Atwater |rowspan=7|October 14, 1966 |Atwater Avenue |Edwin Atwater (Councillor of Montreal) | |rowspan=\"10\"|Ville-Marie |- |Guy-Concordia |Guy Street Concordia University |\u00c9tienne Guy (landowner) Concordia salus | |- |Peel |Rue Peel |Sir Robert Peel | |- |McGill |McGill College Avenue McGill University |James McGill (Scottish-Canadian businessman) |R\u00e9seau express m\u00e9tropolitain (planned) |- |Place-des-Arts |Place des Arts |Cultural complex | |- |Saint-Laurent |Saint Laurent Boulevard |Saint Lawrence or Saint Lawrence River | |- |Berri-UQAM |Berri Street Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al De Montigny Street |Simon Despr\u00e9s dit Le Berry Testard de Montigny family | |- |Beaudry |December 21, 1966 |Beaudry Street |Pierre Beaudry (landowner) |- |Papineau |October 14, 1966 |Papineau Avenue |Joseph Papineau | |- |Frontenac |December 19, 1966 |Frontenac Street |Louis de Buade de Frontenac (Governor-General of New France) | |- |Pr\u00e9fontaine |rowspan=9|June 6, 1976 |Pr\u00e9fontaine Street Raymond-Pr\u00e9fontaine Park |Raymond-Fournier Pr\u00e9fontaine (mayor of Montreal) | |rowspan=\"10\"|Mercier\u2013 Hochelaga\u2013 Maisonneuve |- |Joliette |Joliette Street |Barth\u00e9lemy Joliette (founder of Joliette, Quebec) | |- |Pie-IX |Pie-IX Boulevard |Pope Pius IX | |- |Viau |Viau Street |Charles-Th\u00e9odore Viau | |- |Assomption |De l'Assomption Boulevard |Dogma of the Assumption of Mary (proclaimed by Pope Pius XII in 1950) | |- |Cadillac |De Cadillac Street |Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac (French explorer) | |- |Langelier |Langelier Boulevard |Fran\u00e7ois-Charles- Stanislas Langelier | |- |Radisson |Radisson Street |Pierre-Esprit Radisson (French explorer) | Terminus Radisson |- |Honor\u00e9-Beaugrand |Honor\u00e9-Beaugrand Street |Honor\u00e9 Beaugrand | |} ==See also== * Orange Line * Yellow Line * Blue Line * Red Line (Line 3) * List of Montreal Metro stations ==References== == External links == * 2008 STM System Map Category:1966 establishments in Quebec Category:Rapid transit lines in Canada ",
