The two families remained unknown to one another for nearly thirty years, until Cicero's parents, Frank, Sr. and Mary, met while working at the nearby LaMantia Brothers produce house. They courted and privately wed in early 1935 over the opposition of their families, due to religious and cultural (northern/southern Italy) differences. Cicero, Jr. and his siblings, James and Nancy, were raised in his mother's Protestant faith; his family's unique history served as the springboard and subject of his first book. After his family moved to suburban Western Springs, Frank, Jr. became the first in his family to go to high school or college, attending Lyons Township High School in La Grange and Amherst College in Massachusetts (1953\u20134), before transferring to Wheaton College in Illinois, where he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science (1957).

In the initial 1984 court decision, Amoco was found liable, however Cicero succeeded in having Astilleros also found responsible, and in limiting damages based on incompetent clean-up efforts. After several appeals, Amoco agreed to pay $200 million in 1992, a figure much lower than the French claim, which amounted to $1.6 billion.Associated Press. \"Cut Is Urged in Oil Award,\" The New York Times, September 18, 1989.
