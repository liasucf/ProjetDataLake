He held the electorate for ten years until 1984. In July 1983 John Kirk announced that he would not seek the Labour Party's nomination for Sydenham in the 1984 election. In his place Labour selected Jim Anderton, the party president, whereupon Kirk (a strong David Lange supporter) declared that he would stand against the official Labour candidate as an independent. His continuing opposition to Anderton's selection resulted in the Labour Party's New Zealand Council suspending him from membership of the Labour Party. Kirk served out the remainder of his parliamentary career as an Independent MP after declaring that he would never again vote with the Labour Party. He stood in the Wellington urban electorate of Miramar in the 1984 general election where he was unsuccessful. ==Insolvency == Kirk left New Zealand in 1984 while still an MP, owing more than $280,000. He was arrested in the US, held in prison, and then extradited to New Zealand, where he was charged under the Insolvency Act 1985. He was sentenced to four months' periodic detention. ==References== * *From Muldoon to Lange: New Zealand Elections in the 1980s by Alan McRobie and Steven Levine (2002, MC Enterprises, Rangiora) Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand Labour Party MPs Category:Independent MPs of New Zealand Category:Prisoners and detainees of New Zealand Category:Prisoners and detainees of the United States federal government Category:New Zealand MPs for Christchurch electorates Category:Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:People extradited from the United States Category:People extradited to New Zealand Category:New Zealand politicians convicted of crimes Category:People from Katikati Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1984 New Zealand general election Category:Children of Prime Ministers of New Zealand ",
