From 1939\u20132000, it was the location of Ballochmyle Hospital operated by NHS Ayrshire and Arran. Following a \u00a35m restoration that began in 2009, it was converted to luxury flats. ==History== Ballochmyle House was designed by Robert Adam and completed in 1760 before being substantially rebuilt to a design by Hew Montgomerie Wardrop with assistance from George Mackie Watson in 1887. It was the home of Wilhelmina Alexander whose lasting fame derives from being Robert Burns's 'The Bonnie Lass o'Ballochmyle' in the song of that title.Westwood, page 53 In 1939, Ballochmyle Hospital was established as one of seven Emergency Hospital Service facilities for military casualties when Ballochmyle House was requisitioned from Sir Claud Alexander. The wooden huts which had been erected during the war continued to be used for civilian purposes after the war. After services transferred to East Ayrshire Community Hospital, Ballochmyle Hospital closed in 2000. The house has since been converted into luxury apartments and the site redeveloped for residential use. ==References== ==Sources== *Westwood, Peter J. (2008). Who's Who in the World of Robert Burns.
