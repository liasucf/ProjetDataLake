    "text": "The Ojo Alamo Formation is a geologic formation in New Mexico spanning the Mesozoic/Cenozoic boundary. ==Description== The Ojo Alamo formation is divided into two subunits separated by a large unconformity\u2014a gap in the geologic record. The lower Naashoibito member (sometimes considered part of the Kirtland Formation) was deposited during the Maastrichtian age of the Cretaceous period, specifically between about 69-68 million years ago. It overlies the De-na-zin member of the Kirtland formation, though the two are separated by another large unconformity that spans a period of geologic time equivalent to 73-69 million years ago.Sullivan, R.M., and Lucas, S.G. 2006. \"The Kirtlandian land-vertebrate \"age\" \u2013 faunal composition, temporal position and biostratigraphic correlation in the nonmarine Upper Cretaceous of western North America.\" New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, Bulletin 35:7-29. All dinosaur fossils probably come from this unit. The upper unit of the Ojo Alamo Formation is the Kimbeto Member, which was deposited mainly during the earliest Cenozoic (Danian age of the Paleogene period), between 66 and 64 million years ago. == Fossils == A restoration of the environment, featuring Dineobellator (center front), Ojoceratops (right), a tyrannosaurid (far left), and Alamosaurus (center back), taxa all known from the formation. Ojo Alamo Formation showing conglomerate lens with petrified wood, De-Na-Zin Wilderness Dinosaur remains are among the fossils that have been recovered from the formation, though all dinosaur remains come from the lowest part of the formation, the Naashoibito member (sometimes considered part of the Kirtland Formation, which dates to the late Maastrichtian stage of the Cretaceous period.Williamson, T.E. and Weil, A. (2008). \"Metatherian mammals from the Naashoibito Member, Kirtland Formation, San Juan Basin, New Mexico and their biochronologic and paleobiogeographic significance. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 28: 803-815. Some researchers have claimed to find isolated non-avian dinosaur remains in the younger Kimbeto Member. If this is the case, it would represent the only known instance of a non-avian dinosaur population persisting after the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event. However, most scientists consider these to have been stratigraphically misinterpreted or reworked from the older Naashoibito member. === Alamo Wash fauna === The following species are known to be present in the Naashoibito Member \"Alamo Wash Fauna\".Jasinski, S. E., Sullivan, R. M., & Lucas, S. G. (2011). Taxonomic composition of the Alamo Wash local fauna from the Upper Cretaceous Ojo Alamo Formation (Naashoibito Member) San Juan Basin, New Mexico.

Baltz et al. reassigned the lower beds to the Kirtland Formation in 1966, but this has not been generally accepted.Baltz, E.H., Ash, S.R., and Anderson, R.Y., 1966, History of nomenclature and stratigraphy of rocks adjacent to the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, western San Juan basin, New Mexico, IN Shorter contributions to general geology, 1965: U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper, 524-D, p.
