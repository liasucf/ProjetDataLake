Previously they must exit and re-enter the station, but a new linkway has been built via the shopping center. * - Passengers can interchange to Lines 1 and 2. This is also a very important station, as it is located at a major financial district as well as near many tourist attractions. *: The first platform to platform interchange station in the Shanghai Metro network. Interchange with Line 4. ==History== The subway line's first phase began trial operation on September 17, 2007 and officially opened on December 29, 2007, running between and . The second phase, from Yaohua Road to began operation on July 5, 2009. Two stations opened later than the rest of the line: in September 2012 and opened in April 2011. Even though Line 8 is a heavy rail rapid transit line, \"C size\" trains used for light metro lines consisting of 6 or 7 cars are being used throughout the line with platforms built to accommodate up to 8 car trains. Due to the trains relatively smaller loading gauge and capacity compared to \"A size\" trains used on other Shanghai Metro lines the line is extremely crowded. This has caused much doubt among the public in the Shanghai Metro's ability to accurately predict passenger flows for future lines. It was revealed that line 8 originally was forecasted to have a short term daily ridership of 400,000-500,000 people/day, which warrants the use of larger \"A size\" trains. This is not surprising given Line 8 is planned to serve some of Shanghai's densest neighborhoods and several major attractions. However the forecast was downgraded to 200,000 people/day which allowed Shanghai Alstom, a company interested in manufacturing and selling \"C size\" trains in Shanghai, to build trains for line 8. There are no short term solutions to the overcrowding. The loading gauges of \"A size\" trains are incompatible with \"C size\" trains but parallel relief bus services have started operating. On May 4, 2017 it was announced the third phase had been renamed the Pujiang line, and will be a new long automated people mover line running from Shendu Highway station to Huizhen Road station. It will use rubber tire Bombardier Innovia APM 300 technology. On January 13 Bombardier delivered the first out of 44 autonomous people movers to Shanghai. It opened on March 31, 2018. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: right;\" !Segment!!Commencement!!Length!!Station(s)!!Name |- |style=\"text-align: left;\"| Shiguang Road \u2014 Yaohua Road | 29 December 2007 | | 20 |style=\"text- align: left;\"| Phase 1 |- |style=\"text-align: left;\"| Yaohua Road \u2014 Shendu Highway | 5 July 2009 | | 8 |style=\"text-align: left;\"| Phase 2 |- |style=\"text-align: left;\"| Oriental Sports Center | 12 April 2011 | Infill station | 1 |style=\"text-align: left;\"| |- |style=\"text-align: left;\"| China Art Museum | 28 September 2012 | Infill station | 1 |style=\"text-align: left;\"| |} ==Rolling Stock== {|border=0 style=\"border:1px solid #999;background-color:white;text-align:left;font-size:90%\" |-align=center bgcolor=#cccccc !Type!!Time of manufacturing!!Series!!Sets!!Assembly!!Notes |- |Type C||2006\u20132008||08C01||28||Tc\uff0bMp\uff0bM\uff0bM\uff0bMp\uff0bTc||Manufactured by Alstom |- bgcolor=#efefef |Type C||2009\u20132010||08C02||18||Tc\uff0bMp\uff0bM\uff0bM\uff0bM\uff0bMp\uff0bTc||Manufactured by CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles |- |Type C||2010\u20132012||08C03||20||Tc\uff0bMp\uff0bM\uff0bM\uff0bM\uff0bMp\uff0bTc||Manufactured by CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles |- bgcolor=#efefef |Type C||2018\u20132020||08C04||24||Tc\uff0bMp\uff0bM\uff0bM\uff0bM\uff0bMp\uff0bTc||Manufactured by CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles |} File:Shanghai Metro Line 8 AC07.JPG|08C01 train File:Shanghai Metro Line 8 AC13.JPG|08C02 train == References == Category:Shanghai Metro lines Category:Line 8, Shanghai Metro Category:Railway lines opened in 2007 Category:2007 establishments in China ",
