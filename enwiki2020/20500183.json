    "text": "The Suzuki GSX1100F is a sport touring motorcycle introduced by Suzuki in October 1987 as part of the GSX series. It had a 16-valve engine and a 5-speed gearbox. It had a full touring fairing and was particularly noted for its electrically powered height-adjustable wind screen that was prone to failures. The engine came originally from the GSX-R1100, but was re-tuned to provide more low-end and mid-range power. ==References== GSX1100F Category:Sport touring motorcycles Category:Motorcycles introduced in 1987 ",
