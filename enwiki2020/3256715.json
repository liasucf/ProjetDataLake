Retrieved 11 December 2011 \"GoldenEye\" was first released on the original motion picture soundtrack and the following year it was included on Turner's album Wildest Dreams.

Retrieved 11 December 2011 ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard described it as a \"gloriously over-the- top James Bond theme\". He said it is a \"tingly, feline performance\", and added that producer Nellee Hooper \"captures the essence of the movie, wrapping the track in sweeping strings and horns that are fondly reminiscent\" of the 1964 movie Goldfinger. He also noted that U2's Bono and the Edge \"get in on the fun, writing a tune that's fraught with cryptic lyrical twists and romantic intrigue.\" Nisid Hajari from Entertainment Weekly said that \"the James Bond myth certainly allows for the trinity of Sex, Danger, and Elegance to verge on melodrama.\" He noted the song's \"self-conscious vocals and maudlin horns and strings\" and added that \"Goldeneye\" \"blithely crosses the line\". David Cook from The Michigan Daily wrote that \"it's amazing how similar this song sounds to other opening songs from previous James Bond movies \u2014 there must be some magic formula to making all of the sound so Bondlike.\" Music & Media called \"GoldenEye\" a \"perfect candidate for the soundtrack of 007's latest adventure\" and wrote that Tina Turner \"and her raw R&B; power easily fit in the Shirley Bassey tradition.\" They also noted that composers Bono and The Edge \"stayed close to the traditional James Bond sound\". Jeff Farance from The News-Journal said in his movie review that \"the title sequence is pure Bond, with Tina Turner belting out the title song in the grand tradition of magnificent music for 007.\" ==Music video== Tina Turner in the music video of \"GoldenEye\". The music video for \"GoldenEye\" was directed by English film director Jake Scott and made its debut at the end of October 1995.http://mvdbase.com/video.php?id=28514 ==Versions and remixes== * Soundtrack album version/Wildest Dreams album version (U.S.) \u2013 4:43 * Single edit/Wildest Dreams album version (Europe) \u2013 3:31 * A/C Mix \u2013 4:02 * Urban A/C Mix by Dave Hall \u2013 4:58 * Club Edit by David Morales \u2013 4:02 * Morales Club Mix \u2013 10:00 * Morales 007 Dub \u2013 9:37 * Morales Dub of Bond \u2013 5:36 * Video edit \u2013 3:20 ==Samples and covers== * In 1999, French rapper Kohndo has sampled parts of the instrumentals in his song \"Survivre\". * In 2008, Lil Mass, another French rapper, sampled it in the song \"Beatdown\". * The song appeared in an episode of MTV series Human Giant and again in the 2010 film Beatdown. * American singer Nicole Scherzinger, lead singer of pop group Pussycat Dolls, covered the single for the 2010 remake of the video game GoldenEye 007.
