It should be distinguished from the journal Machine intelligence which was established in the mid-1960s.E.g.: vs.: In 2001, forty editors and members of the editorial board of Machine Learning resigned in order to support the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), saying that in the era of the internet, it was detrimental for researchers to continue publishing their papers in expensive journals with pay-access archives.
