It is an irregularly-shaped 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a cross-gabled hip roof, projecting sections, and corner turret typical of the Queen Anne style. Its porch, supported by Tuscan columns, and front entry, with fanlight and pedimented bay, are typical of the Colonial Revival. Built in 1903 by a prominent local builder, is one of the community's finest examples of this transitional style. It is set on a handsome manicured lot over in size. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Monroe County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Queen Anne architecture in Arkansas Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1903 Category:Houses in Monroe County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Monroe County, Arkansas ",
