    "text": "Terby is a crater on the northern edge of Hellas Planitia, Mars. It is in the Iapygia quadrangle. The 174 km diameter crater is centered at 28\u00b0S, 73\u00b0E with an elevation of \u22125 km. It is named after Fran\u00e7ois J. Terby. It is the site of an ancient lakebed and has clay deposits.Murchie, S. et al. 2009. A synthesis of Martian aqueous mineralogy after 1 Mars year of observations from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Journal of Geophysical Research: 114. Using data from Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter missions researchers believe Terby's layers were formed from sediments settling under water. Crater counts show this happened during the Noachian period. It used to be thought that Terby Crater contained a large delta.Ansan, V. et al. 2005. Analysis of layered deposits in Terby crater Hellas region, Mars) using multiple datasets MOC, THEMIS, and OMEGA/MEX date. Lunar Planet. Sci., XXXVI (CD-ROM). Abstract 1324. However, newer observations have led researchers to think of the layered sequence as part of a group of layers that may have extended all the across Hellas. There is no valley large enough at the northern rim of Terby to have carried the large amount of sediments necessary to produce the layers. Other details in the layers argue against Terby containing a delta.Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY. Fan deposits are some of the thickest on Mars.
