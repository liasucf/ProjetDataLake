The second version's music from Joseph Haydn's operas La fedelt\u00e0 premiata and Il mondo della luna was recorded using analogue technology in June 1975 and September 1977 respectively in the Grande Salle, \u00c9palinges, Switzerland. ==Cover art== The cover of the first version of the album features a photograph of von Stade taken by her first husband, Peter Elkus.Frederica von Stade sings Mozart & Rossini Arias, with the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Edo de Waart, Philips LP, 9500-098, 1976.

The cover of the third version, designed by Netherlads, features a photograph of von Stade taken by Marcia Lieberman. ==Critical reception== ===Reviews=== Gioachino Rossini, painted by an unknown artist Alan Blyth reviewed the first version of the album on LP in Gramophone in February 1977. If he were in charge of an opera house, he wrote, he would be eagerly planning a staging of Rossini's Otello, That was how much he had been enthused by hearing Frederica von Stade's performance of Rossini's version of Desdemona's Willow Song scene. To understand his excitement, readers had only to \"listen how her voice runs delicately through the phrase 'Salce d'amor delizia' ending with a heartrending diminuendo ... or how affectingly she touches in the recitative, or how she rightly allows a little harshness into her lovely tone in the word 'l'ingrato' or covers it for the Prayer\". These details were no doubt the result of meticulous design, and yet von Stade's execution of them felt wholly free of artifice. Blyth, Alan: Gramophone, February 1977, pp. 1317-1318 Her characterization of Angelina, the Cinderella of La Cenerentola, was just as vivid a portrait (and based, thankfully, on a modern, scholarly edition of Rossini's score). The roulades of the opera's concluding scene were delineated with precision. When the La Scala company had recently brought their production of La Cenerentola to Covent Garden, Lucia Valentini Terrani had presented Angelina's music with \"a fearsome and speedy brilliance\"; von Stade, \"forgetting and forgiving in her final Rondo\", offered \"a tender lightness that is just as winning\". Von Stade had also recently sung Rossini at the Royal Opera House, debuting there as Rosina in Il barbiere di Siviglia. Her recording of \"Una voce poco f\u00e0\" was \"as bewitchingly as on stage\". Her Rosina was mischievous and flirtatious, but had a gentleness about her too, as well as a rapid vibrato that was rather appealing. All three items on the A side of the LP were very effective dramatically. The B side began with a portrayal of Mozart's Cherubino that was no less compelling. Just as she had when appearing in Le nozze di Figaro at Glyndebourne, von Stade brought us \"a palpitating youth - swooning, too, in a nicely easy-going and varied 'Voi che sapete'\". And her \"tender, seductive\" Zerlina from Don Giovanni was a girl whose embraces nobody could resist. La clemenza di Tito was the one work that von Stade drew on with less than total success. In Sesto's \"Parto, parto\", she was perfect - she sang its striking divisions accurately but without ostentation, and she conveyed all of Sesto's \"sincerity and faith\". But her reading of Vitellia's \"Non pi\u00f9 di fiore\" paled by comparison with that of Janet Baker in a recent staging at Covent Garden. Baker had sung the role with a \"variety of colour and nuance\" that von Stade could not equal. Von Stade might make a convincingly \"scheming, nasty\" Vitellia one day, but that day had not come yet. Teresa Rieu was a graceful harpist accompanying Desdemona, and Bas de Jong was an unimpeachable clarinetist accompanying Sesto. George Pieterson was adroit but \"less advantageously placed\" with his basset-horn in Vitellia's aria. The Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and Edo de Waart were proficient but not outstanding. Philips's engineers had put von Stade so close to her microphone that one could hear her breathing, but their balancing worked very well. George Jellinek reviewed the first version of the album on LP as a \"recording of special merit\" in Stereo Review in May 1977. Frederica von Stade, he wrote, had followed her first operatic recital - her Columbia disc of French Opera Arias - with a sequel of music in which she was altogether at home. Her record's B side, devoted to Mozart, was marginally better than its Rossinian side A.Jellinek, George: Stereo Review, May 1977, p. 113 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, painted by his brother-in-law, Joseph Lange Her \"breathlessly amorous Cherubino\" had been relished on stage in both America and Europe, and was just as enjoyable on her album. The timbre of her high mezzo-soprano voice was ideally suited to Zerlina. And she sang \"expertly and elegantly\" in her two excerpts from La clemenza di Tito. In her Rossini selections, she performed \"winningly\" both in Desdemona's sorrowful music and in Angelina'a and Rosina's pyrotechnic bel canto showpieces. But her technique was not altogether beyond reproach. On the one hand, her fioriture in La Cenerentola and in Il barbiere di Siviglia (as in Mozart's \"Parto. parto\") lacked the superlative precision achieved by Janet Baker, Teresa Berganza and Marilyn Horne. On the other hand, her Rosina, while characterful, did not sound as spontaneous as was desirable. Bas de Jong and George Pieterson both negotiated their tricky obbligato woodwind parts adeptly. The playing of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra was \"nicely articulated and warm\". Condecting, Edo de Waart set far too slow a tempo for Desdemona. Philips's audio quality was very good. Profiling von Stade in Time magazine (13 December 1976), the unnamed author wrote that the album displayed \"a lustrous amber mezzo-soprano voice with an unusually sweet crystalline top and seemingly effortless agility\".Time, 13 December 1976, p. 101 The album was also reviewed in The complete Penguin stereo record and cassette guide, which reported that \"Frederica von Stade is, as always, magically compelling here, both in vocal personality and in ... vocal production\".Greenfield, Edward, Layton Robert and March, Ivan: The complete Penguin stereo record and cassette guide, Penguin, 1984, p. 1374 ===Accolades=== The album was nominated for a Grammy award for the best classical solo vocal performance of 1977.https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/frederica-von-stade-0 Alan Blyth included the album in his 1977 Gramophone Critics' Choice list of the best recordings of the year.Blyth, Alan: Gramophone, December 1977, p. 1016 ==Track listings== ===First and third versions=== Philips LP (9500-098) and PentaTone SACD (5186-158) Gioachino Rossini (1792-1868) Il barbiere di Siviglia, ossia L'inutile precauzione (\"The barber of Seville, or The useless precaution\", Rome, 1816), with a libretto by Cesare Sterbini (1784-1831) after Le Barbier de S\u00e9ville (1775) by Pierre Beaumarchais (1732-1799) * 1 (5:46) Cavatina (Rosina): \"Una voce poco f\u00e0...Io sono docile\" Otello, ossia Il moro di Venezia (\"Othello, or The Moor of Venice\", Naples, 1816), with a libretto by Francesco Maria Berio, Marchese di Salsa, after The tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice (?1603) by William Shakespeare (1564-1616) * 2 (13:35) Canzona e preghiera (Desdemona): \"Assisa a pi\u00e8 d'un salice...Deh! calma, o ciel, nel sonno\" La Cenerentola, ossia La bont\u00e0 in trionfo (\"Cinderella, or Goodness triumphant\", Rome, 1817), with a libretto by Jacopo Ferretti (1784-1852) after Cendrillon, ou la petite pantoufle de verre (\"Cinderella, or The little glass slipper\", 1697) by Charles Perrault (1628-1703) * 3 (6:26) Rondo (Angelina): \"Nacqui all' affanno...Non pi\u00f9 mesta\" Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) Le nozze di Figaro (\"The marriage of Figaro\", K. 492, Vienna, 1786), with a libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte (1749-1838) after La folle journ\u00e9e, ou le Mariage de Figaro (\"The mad day, or The marriage of Figaro\", 1784) by Pierre Beaumarchais (1732-1799) * 4 (3:05) Aria (Cherubino): \"Non so pi\u00f9\" * 5 (3:10) Canzona (Cherubino) \"Voi, che sapete\" La clemenza di Tito (\"The clemency of Titus\", K. 621, Prague, 1791), with a libretto by Caterino Mazzol\u00e0 (1745-1806) after Pietro Metastasio (1698-1782) * 6 (9:27) Recitativo accompagnato e rondo (Vitellia): \"Ecco il punto...Non pi\u00f9 di fiori\" Il dissoluto punito, ossia il Don Giovanni (\"The rake punished, or Don Giovanni\", K. 527, Prague, 1787), with a libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte after El burlador de Seville y convidado de piedra (\"The trickster of Seville and the stone guest\", ?1616) by Tirso de Molina (1579-1648) * 7 (3:57) Aria (Zerlina): Vedrai, carino La clemenza di Tito * 8 (6:30) Aria (Sesto): \"Parto, parto...Guardami, e tutto obblio\" ===Second version=== Philips CD (420-084-2) Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) La fedelt\u00e0 premiata (\"Fidelity rewarded\", Hob.
