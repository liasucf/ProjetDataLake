    "text": "\"Thunder\" is a song by Prince and The New Power Generation, from the 1991 album Diamonds and Pearls. It was issued as a limited, individually numbered 12-inch single picture disc in the UK only, and the edited version was available only on the promotional single. The lyrics can be interpreted as referring to the night Prince decided to withdraw The Black Album, when he was rumored to have suffered a bad ecstasy trip.Hahn, Alex. Possessed: The Rise and Fall of Prince. Billboard Books, 2003. . Page ? This is the first single cover to feature Mayte, sitting at the lower left. The B-sides were previously released on the \"Gett Off\" maxi-single: \"Violet the Organ Grinder\" and \"Gett Off\" (Thrust Dub). ==Critical reception== Tom Doyle from Smash Hits described the song as \"quirky rock\". ==Chart performance== The song was another top 30 hit for Prince, peaking at number 28 in the UK, and continuing the moderate success of Diamonds and Pearls singles there. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1992) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles (Official Chart Company) |align=\"center\"|28 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Music Week Dance Singles |align=\"center\"|6 |- |} ==References== * Uptown: The Vault \u2013 The Definitive Guide to the Musical World of Prince: Nilsen Publishing 2004, ==External links== * Category:Prince (musician) songs Category:1992 singles Category:Songs written by Prince (musician) Category:Paisley Park Records singles Category:Warner Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Prince (musician) Category:1991 songs ",
