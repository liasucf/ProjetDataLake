Before moving to Portland, Oregon, the franchise was previously in Boston, Massachusetts as the Boston Breakers and New Orleans, Louisiana as the ==History== ===Boston Breakers=== The team started out in 1983 as the Boston Breakers, owned by Boston businessman George Matthews and former New England Patriots wide receiver Randy Vataha. However, finding a stadium proved difficult. The lack of a professional-quality stadium had stymied previous attempts at pro football in Boston before the Patriots arrived in 1960. The largest stadium in the region was Schaefer Stadium in Foxborough, home of the Patriots. However, it was owned by the Sullivan family, owners of the Patriots, and Matthews and Vataha were not willing to have an NFL team as their landlord. As a result, their initial choice for a home facility was Harvard Stadium, but Harvard University rejected them almost out of hand. They finally settled on Nickerson Field on the campus of Boston University, which seated only 21,000 people\u2013far and away the smallest stadium in the league. The team's cheerleaders were called \"Heartbreakers.\" Coach Dick Coury put together a fairly competitive team led by QB Johnnie Walton (then 36 years old, a former Continental Football League and World Football League alumnus who had been out of football since the late 1970s) and Canadian Football League Veteran HB Richard Crump. The Breakers finished 11-7, finishing one game behind the Chicago Blitz for the final playoff spot. Walton, who had retired from pro football years earlier and had spent the previous three years coaching college football, was the league's 7th ranked passer. Coury was named coach of the year. Despite fielding a fairly solid team, playing in Nickerson doomed the team in Boston. The stadium had been built in 1955 (though parts of it dated to 1915), and had not aged well. It was so small that the Breakers lost money even when they sold out as visiting teams got a portion of the gate proceeds. The Breakers and Washington Federals were the only teams to draw less than 14,000 per game in 1983. The other 10 teams drew over 18,000 per game. (What fans did come to the games were generally passionate; the documentary Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL? made note of a particular Breakers victory in which fans stormed the field afterward.) Concluding that Nickerson Field was not suitable even for temporary use, Matthews again approached Harvard, but the school refused again. He then hashed out a deal to move to Foxborough, but ultimately decided against being a tenant of an NFL team. He seriously considered an offer to sell a stake in the team to Jacksonville, Florida businessman Fred Bullard, but pulled out after Bullard proposed firing Coury in favor of Florida State coach Bobby Bowden. (Bullard would ultimately land an expansion franchise, the Jacksonville Bulls.) After floating offers to move to Seattle, Honolulu and Portland, Matthews ultimately decided to move to New Orleans. He sold a 31 percent interest to New Orleans real estate developer Joe Canizaro, and the move was approved by the USFL on October 18, 1983. Matthews later sold his remaining stake to Canizaro, but Vataha remained as team president. ====1983 Boston Breakers schedule==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Week ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Day ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Date ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Opponent ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Game site ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Attendance ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Television ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Final score ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|W/L ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Record |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\" colspan=10|Regular Season |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 1 | Sunday | March 6, 1983 | at Tampa Bay Bandits | Tampa Stadium | 42,437 | | 17\u201321 | L | 0\u20131 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 2 | Sunday | March 13, 1983 | at Denver Gold | Mile High Stadium | 41,926 | | 21\u20137 | W | 1\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 3 | Sunday | March 20, 1983 | Washington Federals | Nickerson Field | 18,430 | | 19\u201316 | W | 2\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 4 | Sunday | March 27, 1983 | at New Jersey Generals | Giants Stadium | 41,218 | | 31\u201321 | W | 3\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 5 | Saturday | April 2, 1983 | Birmingham Stallions | Nickerson Field | 10,976 | ABC | 27\u201316 | W | 4\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 6 | Sunday | April 10, 1983 | Oakland Invaders | Nickerson Field | 7,984 | ABC | 7\u201326 | L | 4\u20132 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 7 | Sunday | April 17, 1983 | at Arizona Wranglers | Sun Devil Stadium | 20,911 | | 44\u201323 | W | 5\u20132 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 8 | Sunday | April 24, 1983 | at Philadelphia Stars | Veterans Stadium | 10,257 | ABC | 16\u201323 | L | 5\u20133 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 9 | Sunday | May 1, 1983 | Michigan Panthers | Nickerson Field | 10,971 | | 24\u201328 | L | 5\u20134 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 10 | Saturday | May 7, 1983 | at Los Angeles Express | Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum | 16,307 | ESPN | 20\u201323 | L | 5\u20135 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 11 | Sunday | May 15, 1983 | Denver Gold | Nickerson Field | 4,173 | | 17\u20139 | W | 6\u20135 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 12 | Sunday | May 22, 1983 | at Washington Federals | RFK Stadium | 7,303 | | 21\u201314 | W | 7\u20135 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 13 | Sunday | May 29, 1983 | Philadelphia Stars | Nickerson Field | 15,668 | ABC | 21\u201317 | W | 8\u20135 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 14 | Monday | June 6, 1983 | Chicago Blitz | Nickerson Field | 15,087 | ESPN | 21\u201315 | W | 9\u20135 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 15 | Sunday | June 12, 1983 | at Birmingham Stallions | Legion Field | 20,500 | ESPN | 19\u201331 | L | 9\u20136 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 16 | Sunday | June 19, 1983 | Tampa Bay Bandits | Nickerson Field | 15,530 | ESPN | 24\u201317 | W | 10\u20136 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 17 | Saturday | June 25, 1983 | at Oakland Invaders | Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum | 30,396 | ESPN | 16\u201317 | L | 10\u20137 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 18 | Sunday | July 3, 1983 | New Jersey Generals | Nickerson Field | 15,798 | | 34\u201310 | W | 11\u20137 |} Sourcesstatscrew.com 1983 Boston Breakers Game-by-Game Resultsusflsite.com 1983 USFL Seasonprofootballarchives.com 1983 Boston Breakers (USFL) ===New Orleans Breakers=== In New Orleans, the team played in the spacious Louisiana Superdome, also home to the NFL's New Orleans Saints. They started out the season 5-0, and all signs pointed to them running away with the Southern Division. However, they only won three more games to finish 8-10. This included a 35-0 thrashing by the Philadelphia Stars and losses in their last six games. In spite of adding NFL star TE Dan Ross and rookie HBs Buford Jordan and Marcus Dupree (whose signing was technically against USFL rules as he was underage), the team struggled. Walton was inconsistent and ultimately retired after the season, while Dupree would experience constant problems with his knees throughout his time with the Breakers. Years later, defensive lineman Jeff Gaylord recalled that the Breakers' slide came because many of his teammates were sucked into New Orleans' drug culture. According to Gaylord, cocaine use ran rampant in the locker room, and its lure was too much for many of his teammates who had grown up poor. On the positive side, New Orleans supported the team well, averaging 30,557 per game. Many of them came to see Dupree, who grew up in neighboring Mississippi. Jordan ran for 1,276 yards (4th in the league), and Ross and WR Frank Lockett had strong years. After the season, the league owners decided to go for broke and move to the fall starting in 1986. This put teams like New Orleans, Michigan, and Philadelphia in an awkward situation. Canizaro knew that the Breakers could not hope to compete with the Saints, and opted to move before the 1985 season rather than play a lame duck season in New Orleans. ====1984 New Orleans Breakers schedule==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Week ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Day ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Date ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Opponent ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Game site ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Attendance ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Television ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Final score ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|W/L ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Record |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\" colspan=10|Preseason |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#BFBFBF;\" | 1 | colspan=8|Bye | \u2014 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#BFBFBF;\" | 2 | colspan=8|Bye | \u2014 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 3 | Saturday | February 11, 1984 | at Birmingham Stallions | Legion Field | 12,000 | | 10\u201330 | L | 0\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 4 | Saturday | February 18, 1984 | vs. Memphis Showboats | Cajun Field | | | 20\u20130 | W | 1\u20131 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" | style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\" colspan=10|Regular Season |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 1 | Sunday | February 26, 1984 | at San Antonio Gunslingers | Alamo Stadium | 18,233 | | 13\u201310 | W | 1\u20130 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 2 | Sunday | March 4, 1984 | at Oakland Invaders | Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum | 41,200 | | 13\u20130 | W | 2\u20130 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 3 | Sunday | March 12, 1984 | Memphis Showboats | Louisiana Superdome | 45,269 | | 37\u201314 | W | 3\u20130 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 4 | Monday | March 19, 1984 | at Jacksonville Bulls | Gator Bowl Stadium | 48,303 | ESPN | 38\u20139 | W | 4\u20130 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 5 | Sunday | March 25, 1984 | Chicago Blitz | Louisiana Superdome | 43,692 | ABC | 41\u201335 OT | W | 5\u20130 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 6 | Monday | April 2, 1984 | at Birmingham Stallions | Legion Field | 28,100 | ESPN | 17\u201331 | L | 5\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 7 | Sunday | April 8, 1984 | Pittsburgh Maulers | Louisiana Superdome | 39,315 | ABC | 27\u201324 | W | 6\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 8 | Monday | April 16, 1984 | Tampa Bay Bandits | Louisiana Superdome | 35,634 | ESPN | 13\u201335 | L | 6\u20132 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 9 | Sunday | April 22, 1984 | Denver Gold | Louisiana Superdome | 22,139 | ABC | 20\u201318 | W | 7\u20132 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 10 | Friday | April 27, 1984 | at Philadelphia Stars | Veterans Stadium | 34,011 | | 0\u201335 | L | 7\u20133 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 11 | Monday | May 7, 1984 | Arizona Wranglers | Louisiana Superdome | 22,937 | ESPN | 13\u201328 | L | 7\u20134 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 12 | Sunday | May 13, 1984 | Michigan Panthers | Louisiana Superdome | 21,053 | ABC | 10\u20133 | W | 8\u20134 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 13 | Sunday | May 20, 1984 | at Tampa Bay Bandits | Tampa Stadium | 42,592 | ABC | 20\u201331 | L | 8\u20135 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 14 | Sunday | May 27, 1984 | Birmingham Stallions | Louisiana Superdome | 23,748 | ABC | 14\u201331 | L | 8\u20136 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 15 | Friday | June 1, 1984 | at Memphis Showboats | Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium | 31,198 | | 17\u201320 | L | 8\u20137 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#BFBFBF;\" | \u2014 | Friday | June 8, 1984 | at New Jersey Generals | Giants Stadium | colspan=5|Postponed; rescheduled for June 10. |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 16 | Sunday | June 10, 1984 | at New Jersey Generals | Giants Stadium | 23,114 | ABC | 21\u201331 | L | 8\u20138 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 17 | Friday | June 15, 1984 | Jacksonville Bulls | Louisiana Superdome | 21,233 | | 17\u201320 OT | L | 8\u20139 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 18 | Sunday | June 24, 1984 | at Washington Federals | RFK Stadium | 6,386 | | 17\u201320 | L | 8\u201310 |} Sourcesstatscrew.com 1984 New Orleans Breakers Game-by-Game Results Retrieved December 28, 2018usflsite.com 1984 USFL Season Retrieved December 28, 2018profootballarchives.com 1984 New Orleans Breakers (USFL) Retrieved December 28, 2018 ===Portland Breakers=== Searching for a home, Canizaro considered moving to Sacramento and Columbus, and even weighed merging with the Birmingham Stallions. However, he was particularly intrigued when he visited Portland. It was a fairly large market with a reasonably adequate facility by USFL standards in 32,000 seat Civic Stadium (the stadium capacity has since been reduced). The move to Portland was announced on It marked a return home of sorts for Coury, who had led the World Football League's Portland Storm in 1974. Initially, Portland seemed to welcome the Breakers with open arms. The Breakers sold out 6,000 of its highest-priced tickets within twelve hours. On the field the team struggled, as the strain of playing in three cities in three years finally caught up with them. The team opted to go with former Jacksonville starter Matt Robinson as Walton's replacement, rather than seeking a more proven USFL QB without a home, like Craig Penrose, Alan Risher, or Mike Hohensee, or trading for someone like Oakland's Fred Besana, or even signing an NFL vet. Robinson ultimately proved to not be an adequate replacement for Walton, finishing with a 62.6 QB rating. HB Jordan did have another strong year with over 800 yards as did Lockett. However, their season effectively ended when Dupree suffered a season-ending knee injury in the season opener. While they managed to upend four playoff teams, they never recovered from a six-game losing streak and finished 6-12. The Breakers were one of nine teams slated to play in the USFL's first fall season, and were slated to be one of only two teams west of the Mississippi River. However, they had only drawn 19,919 per game, nowhere near enough to break even. This was partly because Civic Stadium was located in an area of downtown with little parking (a stop on the MAX Light Rail line would not open for another decade). With such meager attendance, meeting payroll became an adventure. At one point midway through the season, the players were only paid every other week. With four games to go, the checks stopped coming altogether. They were forced to waive their entire roster after missing their final payroll. Coury later recalled that he and his staff never got paid the full salaries stipulated in their contracts. After talks to merge with other teams failed, Canizaro folded the franchise while the USFL's antitrust suit against the NFL was underway, citing over $17 million in losses over three years. It had been obvious even before Canizaro folded the franchise that the Breakers would never play another down. Canizaro was the only league owner who moved his team twice and both moves were tremendous distances. There was some discussion of transplanting the Denver Gold organization to Portland, but this idea was ultimately abandoned as the Gold (whose owners opposed moving to the fall) instead merged with the Jacksonville Bulls. The entire league suspended operations not long afterward after it was awarded only $3 in damages. The Breakers had the distinction of being the only team to play for the entire duration of the USFL for three cities, each season in a different city without relocating mid-season. Unlike many USFL teams, the Breakers never changed their name, logo or colors when they relocated. ====1985 Portland Breakers schedule==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Week ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Day ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Date ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Opponent ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Game site ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Attendance ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Television ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Final score ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|W/L ! style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Record |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\" colspan=10|Preseason |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#BFBFBF;\" | 1 | colspan=8|Bye | \u2014 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 2 | Saturday | February 9, 1985 | vs. Denver Gold | Pomona, California | | | 9\u201327 | L | 0\u20131 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 3 | Saturday | February 16, 1985 | vs. Los Angeles Express | John Shepard Stadium, Los Angeles Pierce College, Los Angeles, California | 5,500 | | 17\u201338 | L | 0\u20132 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" | style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF;\" colspan=10|Regular Season |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 1 | Sunday | February 24, 1985 | at Arizona Outlaws | Sun Devil Stadium | 20,351 | | 7\u20139 | L | 0\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 2 | Saturday | March 2, 1985 | Los Angeles Express | Civic Stadium | 25,232 | ESPN | 14\u201310 | W | 1\u20131 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 3 | Sunday | March 10, 1985 | at Denver Gold | Mile High Stadium | 17,870 | | 17\u201329 | L | 1\u20132 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 4 | Saturday | March 16, 1985 | Orlando Renegades | Civic Stadium | 25,885 | | 23\u201317 | W | 2\u20132 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 5 | Sunday | March 24, 1985 | at Houston Gamblers | Houston Astrodome | 22,031 | | 20\u201327 | L | 2\u20133 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 6 | Monday | April 1, 1985 | San Antonio Gunslingers | Civic Stadium | 19,882 | ESPN | 0\u201333 | L | 2\u20134 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 7 | Saturday | April 6, 1985 | Oakland Invaders | Civic Stadium | 23,388 | | 30\u201317 | W | 3\u20134 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 8 | Sunday | April 14, 1985 | at New Jersey Generals | Giants Stadium | 38,245 | ABC | 7\u201334 | L | 3\u20135 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 9 | Sunday | April 21, 1985 | at Baltimore Stars | Byrd Stadium | 14,832 | | 17\u201326 | L | 3\u20136 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 10 | Saturday | April 27, 1985 | at Los Angeles Express | Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum | 8,410 | | 12\u201317 | L | 3\u20137 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 11 | Monday | May 6, 1985 | Houston Gamblers | Civic Stadium | 18,457 | ESPN | 7\u201345 | L | 3\u20138 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 12 | Saturday | May 11, 1985 | at Birmingham Stallions | Legion Field | 28,500 | ESPN | 0\u201314 | L | 3\u20139 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 13 | Sunday | May 19, 1985 | Arizona Outlaws | Civic Stadium | 15,275 | | 21\u201330 | L | 3\u201310 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 14 | Saturday | May 25, 1985 | Memphis Showboats | Civic Stadium | 16,682 | ESPN | 17\u201314 | W | 4\u201310 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 15 | Sunday | June 2, 1985 | at Oakland Invaders | Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum | 12,740 | | 20\u201338 | L | 4\u201311 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 16 | Saturday | June 8, 1985 | Tampa Bay Bandits | Civic Stadium | 15,521 | | 27\u201324 | W | 5\u201311 |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfd;\" | 17 | Friday | June 14, 1985 | Denver Gold | Civic Stadium | 18,953 | ESPN | 23\u201317 | W | 6\u201311 |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#fdd;\" | 18 | Sunday | June 23, 1985 | at San Antonio Gunslingers | Alamo Stadium | 19,603 | | 13\u201321 | L | 6\u201312 |} Sourcesstatscrew.com 1985 Portland Breakers Game-by-Game Resultsusflsite.com 1985 USFL Season Retrieved December 28, 2018profootballarchives.com 1985 Portland Breakers (USFL) Retrieved December 28, 2018 ===Top \"name\" players=== Among the top \"name\" players that the Breakers had were LB Marcus Marek, HB Marcus Dupree of OU, QB Johnnie Walton, K Tim Mazzetti, QB Matt Robinson, HB Buford Jordan, P Jeff Gossett, OT Broderick Thompson and TE Dan Ross. ===Coaches and executives=== Coury was the team's coach for all three seasons. He was no stranger to Portland, having coached the Storm of the World Football League in 1974. Defensive coordinator was the late Pokey Allen who would later take Portland State University to two national championship games. The Offensive coordinator during the 1983 season was College Football Hall of Fame and former NFL Most Valuable Player Roman Gabriel. After the 1984 season, Jim Fassel was hired as Offensive coordinator, but after five months on the job, he left to become Head Coach at the University of Utah. In 1985, the Offensive coordinator was Pete Kettela, a former head coach of the Edmonton Eskimos. Allen would hire former Breaker executive Steven \"Dream\" Weaver as his marketing director and whose publicity stunts raised his Portland State teams to a national acclaim. The team president for the Portland Breakers was the legendary John Ralston, who was also a founder of the USFL. Other executives included Jack Galmiche, John Brunelle and Brian Feldman. Feldman was the only executive who worked in all three cities. ==Single-season leaders== *Rushing Yards: 1,296 (1984), Buford Jordan *Receiving Yards: 1,189 (1984), Frank Lockett *Passing Yards: 3,772 (1983), Johnnie Walton == Season-by-season == |- | colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF; text-align:center;\"| Boston Breakers |- |1983 || 11 || 7 || 0 || 2nd Atlantic || -- |- | colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF; text-align:center;\"| New Orleans Breakers |- |1984 || 8 || 10 || 0 || 3rd EC Southern || -- |- | colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#0088CE; color:#FFFFFF; text-align:center;\"| Portland Breakers |- |1985 || 6 || 12 || 0 || 5th WC || -- |- !Totals || 25 || 29 || 0 |colspan=\"2\"| == Head coaches == *Dick Coury (1983\u20131985) ==References== ==External links== * USFL.info - Boston-New Orleans-Portland Breakers *Remember the USFL \u2013 Breakers History Category:1985 establishments in Oregon Category:1985 disestablishments in Oregon ",
