Together, Applix TM1, Applix Web and Applix Executive Viewer were the three core components of the Applix Business Analytics Platform. (Executive Viewer was subsequently discontinued by IBM.) On October 25, 2007, Applix was acquired by Cognos. Cognos rebranded all Applix products under its name following the acquisition. On January 31, 2008, Cognos was itself acquired by IBM. Prior to OLAP industry consolidation in 2007, Applix was the purest OLAP vendor among publicly traded independent business intelligence vendors, and had the greatest growth rate. TM1 is now marketed as IBM Cognos TM1; version 10.2 became publicly available on September 13, 2013. == Products and technology == Applix TM1 is enterprise planning software used for collaborative planning, budgeting and forecasting, as well as analytical and reporting applications.

IBM Cognos TM1 also includes a data orchestration environment for accessing external data and systems, as well as capabilities designed for common business planning and budgeting requirements (e.g. workflow, top-down adjustments). ==See also== * Applixware == References == ==External links== *IBM Cognos TM1 Web Site Category:Companies established in 1983 Category:Companies disestablished in 2007 Category:Defunct companies based in Massachusetts Category:Defunct software companies of the United States Category:Online analytical processing Category:1983 establishments in Massachusetts ",
