    "text": "DVD\u00b1R (also DVD+/-R, or \"DVD plus/dash R\") is not a separate DVD format, but rather is a shorthand term for a DVD drive that can accept both of the common recordable DVD formats (i.e. DVD-R and DVD+R). Likewise, DVD\u00b1RW (also written as DVD\u00b1R/W, DVD\u00b1R/RW, DVD\u00b1R/\u00b1RW, DVD+/-RW, and other arbitrary ways) handles both common rewritable disc types (i.e. DVD-RW and DVD+RW, but not usually DVD-RAM).. == See also == * DVD-R * DVD+R * DVD-RW * DVD+RW ==References== Category:DVD ",
