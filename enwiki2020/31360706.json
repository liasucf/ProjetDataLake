In 1991, Rob and Tracey Hirt invested in a small, start-up mortgage company\u2013 Residential Pacific Mortgage. In 1996, Rob was awarded the ownership rights to re-acquire Residential Pacific Mortgage, which eventually became RPM Mortgage. Rob has led RPM to become one of the top 15 private, retail mortgage lenders in the U.S. according to the Scotsman Guide 2015 rankings. Since its first evaluation from Standard & Poor's in 2012, RPM remains the only privately owned U.S residential mortgage originator to consistently receive above average ratings across all eight key areas S&P; analyzes. In 2011, the company was sued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for \"breach of contract, negligence and negligent hiring/supervision\". They later settled out of court for $550,000. On 4 June 2015, The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau filed a complaint in federal district court against RPM Mortgage and its CEO, Erwin Robert Hirt, for illegally paying bonuses and higher commissions to loan originators to incentivize them to steer consumers into costlier mortgages, illegally profiting tens of millions of dollars from 2011 to 2013. They were fined $20 million including $18 million as redress to consumers with an additional $2 million as a civil penalty, half of which is to be paid by CEO Robert Hirt. \"RPM rewarded its loan officers for steering consumers into mortgages with higher interest rates,\" said CFPB Director Richard Cordray in a press release. \"Today we are putting an end to RPM\u2019s unlawful practices and holding Robert Hirt personally responsible for his involvement in them.\" After RPM was fined, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) President David Stevens defended RPM, stating that the MBA repeatedly sought clarification from the Federal Reserve, which issued the loan officer compensation rule in 2010 under the Dodd-Frank act, and later from the CFPB, which took over its enforcement. \"The rule has long been a subject of industry confusion because of its broad and prescriptive reach into the smallest details of lender compensation plans and the lack of clear guidance on how to comply\", Stevens said. ==References== ==External links== * RPM Mortgage, Inc.
