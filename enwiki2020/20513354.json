Lotoko, also known by the slang term \"p\u00e9trole\", is a home-distilled alcoholic drink or \"moonshine\" in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Lotoko is usually made from maize, but sometimes from cassava or plantain. Heads of corn are cut up and boiled into a mash which is then fermented and distilled using improvised stills made from cut down oil drums. Although it is officially banned, because of its high alcohol content (over 50%), its production is widespread in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Lotoko production, being a cottage industry, is very low- tech. It provides its mainly female producers with a degree of financial independence. ==Health concerns== Because of the woody core of the cobs of corn, the alcohol produced contains high levels of methanol which is toxic. Lotoko made from cassava or plantains doesn't carry the same methanol risk. Local NGOs have expressed concernLe \"Lotoko\", un alcool indig\u00e8ne dangereux pour la sant\u00e9 des Kinois [Lotoko, an indigenous alcoholic drink that's dangerous to the health of Kinshasans]La boisson indig\u00e8ne Lotoko, un danger pour la sant\u00e9 [An indigenous drink, Lotoko, is a health hazard] as to its health effects in the communities of Kinshasa, where it costs 200 to 300 FC, compared to 600 FC for commercially brewed beers. ==Etymology== Lotoko is a Lingala word and is known country-wide. ==References== Category:Distilled drinks Category:Democratic Republic of the Congo culture Category:Crimes Category:Whisky Category:Adulteration Category:Alcohol in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ",
