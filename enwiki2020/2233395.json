This CLASS-based POTS-telephone calling feature works by combining the services of call waiting with caller ID but also introduces an \"options\" feature that, in conjunction with certain screen- based telephones, or other capable equipment, gives a telephone user the option to * Switch: Place the current call on hold to take the second call (not a new feature) * Hang-up: Disconnect the current call and take the second call * Please Hold: Send the caller either a custom or telephone-company- generated voice message asking the caller to hold * Forward to Voice Mail: Send the incoming caller to the recipient\u2019s voice mail service. * Join: Add the incoming caller to the existing conversation.
