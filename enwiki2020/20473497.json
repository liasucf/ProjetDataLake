While many women contributed in the Mexican Revolution 1910-1920 by fighting alongside their husbands, others wrote against the injustices of the D\u00edaz regime. In May 1901 she founded an anti- D\u00edaz newspaper called V\u00e9sper. She attacked the clergy in Guanajuato and wrote against foreign domination in Mexico. She also wrote against the D\u00edaz regime and criticized D\u00edaz for not carrying out the requests and needs of the people. As a result, her newspaper was confiscated and she was also put in jail several times by D\u00edaz between 1904 and 1920. She established a new newspaper called El Desmonte (1900-1919) and continued her writings. She encouraged workers and peasants to vote as she wrote \u201cnot to integrate power, but to disintegrate it, as a means of forming, not a new oligarchy but of transforming the oligarchies into truly public administrations.\u201d She argued that the Mexican Population could not count on the leadership of political parties given that they wanted to obtain office in order to protect their own interests. To propagate liberation ideology throughout Mexico, Juana Bel\u00e9n Guti\u00e9rrez de Mendoza translated the works of Peter Kropotkin, Mikhail Bakunin, and Pierre Joseph Proudhon to Spanish. Even though she was intimidated throughout her life, she continued writing and educating the public on the injustices the different governments brought upon Mexico. She is one of the many intellectuals who contributed with her writings to the Mexican Revolution. She was also a Caxcan Indian from the state of Durango.Pouwels, Joel Bollinger.
