    "text": "Sarah Louise Whatmore (born 21 September 1981) is an English singer- songwriter, best known from the British TV series Pop Idol. ==Early life== Whatmore was born in Salford and raised in Walkden. == Career == ===Pop Idol=== Sarah Whatmore rose to fame in the first series of the British television show Pop Idol. Simon Fuller signed her to RCA Records including a worldwide management deal with 19 Entertainment. ===Music career=== In 2002 and 2003 she released two singles \"When I Lost You\" and \"Automatic\", respectively, which both reached the Top 20 in the UK Singles Chart. Whatmore was writing for fellow Pop Idol alumni, and spent time working on her debut album, Living Proof. A third single failed to materialise, and the release of Living Proof was cancelled. Several recordings were leaked over the years, including \"Close To Me\" and \"Don't Let Me Go\". Turning down the opportunity to become a backing singer for Kylie Minogue to concentrate on her own solo career, Whatmore spent the next five years honing her craft. During the years she wrote more than two hundred songs with various collaborators including Greg Fitzgerald and Peter John Vettese . Whatmore continued to record and write for herself as well as other musicians. In 2008, she came up with an album of new material. The first single was titled \"Smile\", and was released on 22 September 2008. It contained a sample of Hall & Oates' \"Sara Smile\". The single included remixes by Bimbo Jones and Vito Benito. The album, Time To Think, was released on 23 March 2009. Her next single from the album was \"Undefined\". ==Discography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Album information |- |align=\"left\"|Living Proof *Released: 2003 (Cancelled) *Singles: **\"When I Lost You\" \u2013 UK No. 6, Australia No.49 **\"Automatic\" \u2013 UK No. 11 |- |align=\"left\"|Time to Think *Released: 2009 *Singles: **\"Smile\" **\"Undefined\" |} ==References== ==External links== * * EUT Interview Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:People from Walkden Category:Pop Idol contestants Category:Music in Salford Category:Musicians from Manchester Category:RCA Records artists Category:19 Recordings artists Category:English female pop singers Category:21st-century English singers Category:21st-century English women singers ",
