The British sent Zhob Expedition in 1884 in order to occupy the Zhob region through Baratkhail. In the meanwhile in a battle, the castles of Saifullah Khan Khoidadzai and Shah Jehan Jogezai (The Badshah of Zhob) were demolished. On 7 October 1884, an assault on the Qalla (Castle) of Shah Jehan near Akhterzai resulted the killings of many tribal people including Malik Hamza Daulatzai and Mohammad Ghous who fought bravely. All 500 tribal Sardars admitted their submission before the British forces and also signed an agreement that they will not interfere in the affairs of British Government in Zhob region except Saifullah Khan Khoidadzai and Shah Jehan Jogezai, who had a narrow escape from the battle scene and established themselves at Kalat Afghanistan; where they used to operate their insurgency campaign against the British and never subdued before the British Occupying Forces.
