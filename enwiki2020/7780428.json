    "text": "\"The Heart of a Broken Story\" is a short story by J. D. Salinger, published in the September 1941 issue of Esquire magazine. The story was one of Salinger's first commercial successes and brought him welcomed attention as a young author. In the story, he pokes fun at the formulaic boy-meets-girl stories that appear with regularity in many magazines during that era. The only story to be narrated by Salinger himself, it nonetheless shows his unwillingness to control his characters. ==References== ==External links== Category:1941 short stories Category:Short stories by J.
