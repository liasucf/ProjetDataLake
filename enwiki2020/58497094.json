He was then director of the Conservatoire de Lille for 33 years, until his death. == Life == Born in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux, Nord department of France in a family of carillonneurs, Lannoy was quickly introduced to the bell tradition. He began his musical studies at the Conservatory of Valenciennes where he studied harmony, violin and bassoon with master Fernand Lamy. He was accepted at the Conservatoire de Paris and obtained the supreme awards in the writing classes. He presented himself in vain for the first time for the Prix de Rome in 1938. During his studies at the conservatory, he was also a soldier-musician in the 5th Line Infantry Regiment of Courbevoie. Lannoy was taken prisoner at the beginning of the Second World War and remained so for 5 years despite a few escapes. Sent to Czechoslovakia, he escaped but could not resist visiting Bayreuth, the city of Wagner and was retaken. Sent to Ukraine, in the disciplinary camp of Rawa Ruska, he attempted another escape in 1942, which led to his internment at the citadel of Lemberg. Then sent to Austria in 1943 in a Stalag, he was appointed Kapellmeister and organized orchestras, choirs and even a ballet- mime,Pygmalion, played by prisoners in Poland. He was rewarded for these facts by the m\u00e9daille de la R\u00e9sistance, the medal of and the Escapees' Medal. Freed by the American army, he returned to Paris in 1945. At the request of the Americans, he composed the music for the documentary film Homecoming, recounting the return of prisoners after the Second World War and directed by Henri Cartier-Bresson. For the radio, and at the request of Henri Dutilleux, he composed La l\u00e9gende des pays alli\u00e9s by Louise de Vilmorin He competed again for the Prix de Rome in 1946 and obtained a second major prize, which earned him the position of director of the Conservatoire de Lille.
