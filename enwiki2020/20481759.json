    "text": "Longuda (N\u028bng\u028bra) is a Niger\u2013Congo language of Nigeria. Joseph Greenberg counted it as a distinct branch, G10, of his Adamawa family. Boyd (1989) assigned it a branch within Waja\u2013Jen. When Blench (2008) broke up Adamawa, Longuda was made a branch of the Bambukic languages. The current number of speakers is unknown. Ethnologue cites an SIL figure of 32,000 from 1973. Variants of the name Longuda include Languda, Longura, Nunguda, Nungura, Nunguraba. ==Dialects== In the Adamawa Languages Project website, Kleinewillingh\u00f6fer (2014) lists five dialects in the Longuda dialect cluster.Kleinewillingh\u00f6fer, Ulrich. 2014. Longuda group. Adamawa Languages Project. *Longuda/Lunguda of Guyuk and Wala Lunguda *N\u028bng\u028bra(ma) of Cerii, Banjiram *Longura(ma) of Thaar\u028b (Koola) *N\u028bng\u028bra(ma) of Gwaanda (Nyuwar) *N\u028bng\u028bra(ma) of Deele (Jessu) Partly due to word taboo customs, there is considerable lexical diversity among Longuda dialects. ==Names and locations== Below is a list of language names, populations, and locations from Blench (2019). {| class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"font-size: 85%;\" | !
