    "text": "Philippe Parreno (born 1964 in Oran, Algeria) is a French artist who lives and works in Paris, France. His work includes various media, such as film, installations, performance, drawing, and text. Parreno focuses on expanding ideas of time and duration through his artworks and distinctive conception of exhibitions as a medium. Preferring projects to objects, he began examining unique approaches to narration and representation in the 1990s and has been exhibiting internationally ever since. ==Early life and education== Parreno was born in Oran, in Algeria. From 1983 until 1988, he studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Grenoble and at the Institute des hautes \u00e9tudes en arts plastiques at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris from 1988 until 1989. ==Work== Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art, Porto. Parreno has exhibited his works since the early 1990s and has been critically acclaimed ever since then. Parreno has worked collaboratively with other artists in all manner of media throughout his career. The concept of exhibitions and exhibition-making has been a central aspect for Parreno. For the artist, the exhibition is not a single work of art but a medium that offers endless possibility. Therefore, his exhibitions are mostly site-specific, as Parreno discloses in an interview for ArtReview: \"What I generally do is so specific to the place that will hold the exhibition. I don't 'travel' shows. I find it impossible.\"Art Review 67, no. 7 (October 2015), pp. 78-85; here p. 80. See also: \"Philippe Parreno\", in: Fondation Beyeler. The Collection, ed. by Theodora Vischer, Fondation Beyeler, Hatje Cantz 2017, . Apart from his extended concept of exhibitions, Parreno's artworks are concerned with the transformation of art genres, where is great diversity of used media plays a significant role. === Notable exhibitions and works === Turbine Hall, Tate Modern, London 2016. Parreno has used his specific conception of exhibitions in his 2013 exhibition Anywhere, Anywhere Out Of The World where he radically transformed the monumental space of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris. Parreno turned the building itself into a living constantly evolving organism using sound, image and performance to guide the visitor on a journey through his works, both old and new. The exhibition was orchestrated along the lines of a dramatic composition where the spectral presence of objects, music, lights, and films guide and manipulated the visitor's experience transforming this monologue into a polyphony. In Dancing around the Bride in 2012 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art curated by Carlos Basualdo in collaboration with Erica F. Battle, Parreno acted as a metteur-en- sc\u00e8ne (orchestrator), using the artworks of John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and Marcel Duchamp to invoke time and motion. Sound was a key element in the 2013 exhibition, The Bride and The Bachelors, at the Barbican, London. The varied sequence of Parreno's subtle orchestration of live and pre-recorded sound from the works of Cage, Cunningham, Johns, Rauschenberg and Duchamp was arranged in concert with live dance performances, enabling the exhibition to change over time. During Art Basel, 2012, Parreno presented two major new works at Fondation Beyeler \u2013 Marilyn (2012) and C.H.Z. (Continuously Habitable Zones) (2011). Marilyn was subsequently shown at Parreno's first solo exhibition in Russia at the Garage Center for Contemporary Culture, Moscow and at the 55th Venice Biennale at Fran\u00e7ois Pinault's museum, Palazzo Grassi. H {N)Y P N(Y} OSIS, Parreno's first major U.S. exhibition, ran from June until August 2015 within the monumental interior of Park Avenue Armory\u2019s Wade Thompson Drill Hall, New York and transformed the traditional exhibition experience through an interplay of film, sculpture, and the spectral presence of sound and light. Shortly after, in October 2015 until February 2016, Parreno presented Hypothesis, at HangarBicocca in Milan, his first survey exhibition in Italy. The show, curated by Andrea Lissoni, was inhabited by a series of key pieces together with recent works and music according to a mise en sc\u00e8ne devised by Parreno. In October 2016 [until April 2017] Parreno undertook the Hyundai Commission for the Turbine Hall at London's Tate Modern. Entitled Anywhen , it was curated by Tate's Andrea Lissoni, Senior Curator, International Art (Film), with Vassilis Oikonomopoulos, Assistant Curator, it was the second annual Hyundai Commission, a series of site-specific works created for the Turbine Hall by renowned international artists. In December 2016 - March 2017 Parreno presented Thenabouts at ACMI in Melbourne, a retrospective of his films. In 2017 from 2 February - 7 May, Parreno exhibited A Time Coloured Space at the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art in Porto. Taking over the entire museum it featured some of Parreno's most well-known works, and new works for the exhibition. Later that year, from 7 July - 17 September 2017 at the Rockbund Art Museum in Shanghai, Parreno presented Synchronicity.. From October 2017 - February 2018 Philippe Parreno: La levadura y el anfitri\u00f3n (The Yeast and The Host) was at Museo Jumex, Mexico City. ==Collaboration== Collaboration is integral to Parreno's work. In June 2006, Universal released a feature-length documentary directed by Parreno and Scottish artist Douglas Gordon entitled Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait, which premiered out of competition at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival. Using 17 cameras, this unique football film follows legendary French midfielder Zinedine Zidane throughout an entire Real Madrid vs Villarreal match in front of 80,000 fans at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. Two of the cameras were borrowed from the U.S. army and have the largest zoom available. The film tracks Zidane's every move on and off the ball, in the thick of the action. Subtitles includes the player's thoughts and observations on his playing career. The motion unfolds in a flow accentuated by an emotive original score by Scottish rock band, Mogwai. In 2007 Parreno directed and co- curated with Hans Ulrich Obrist, a group exhibition, Il Tempo del Postino (Postman Time) for the Manchester International Festival, which then showed at Art Basel, 2009. More than fifteen artists collaborated in this project including Doug Aitken, Matthew Barney & Jonathan Bepler, Tacita Dean, Trisha Donnelly, Olafur Eliasson, Liam Gillick, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Douglas Gordon, Carsten H\u00f6ller, Pierre Huyghe, Koo Jeong-A, Philippe Parreno, Anri Sala, Tino Sehgal, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Thomas Demand, and Peter Fischli / David Weiss. In 2012 Parreno collaborated with artist Liam Gillick on To the Moon via the Beach . Shown at The Amphitheatre in Arles, this was a piece concerning work, production, and change, with the title reflecting its shifting nature and the promise of a journey. On entering the exhibition, visitors encountered an area covered in tons of sand. Over four days, this \u2018beach\u2019 area was transformed by sand sculptors into a moonscape, which formed a constantly changing backdrop to a series of 22 artists\u2019 projects. The whole process was made visible with equal importance placed upon the production, presentation, and exchange of ideas. In 2014 Parreno was involved in a unique collaboration with a number of artists and curators, including Tino Sehgal, Liam Gillick, Hans-Ulrich Obrist, Asad Raza, and Pierre Boulez, for which he was also a curator. The exhibition Solaris Chronicles at the LUMA Foundation Arles Campus was presented in two phases and examined, through a series of artistic interventions and projects, the creative vision of architect Frank Gehry. Centred on large-scale models of many of Gehry's seminal works, the constantly shifting mise-en-sc\u00e8ne created by the artists formed a bridge between art and architecture, transforming the usual relationship and collaborative processes between the two practices. In 2019, Parreno, Arca and Nicolas Becker used a generative music technology called Bronze to create a new work which will occupy the lobby of MoMA in New York for two years. 'Echo' is a site-specific work involving sound, light and animated physical objects. Described by the artist as an auto-poetic system, the work will exist in the space, responding to itself and its surroundings endlessly. == Selected key works == *Anywhen (film), 2016 *Li Yan (film), 2016 *The Crowd (film), 2015 == Selected solo exhibitions == 2018 Philippe Parreno: La levadura y el anfitri\u00f3n (The Yeast and The Host), Museo Jumex, Mexico City, \\- Until 11 February 2018 2017 Philippe Parreno: Synchronicity, Rockbund Art Museum, Shanghai \\- 7 July - 17 September 2017 Philippe Parreno: A Time Coloured Space, Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art, Porto, Portugal, \\- 3 February - 7 May 2017 2016 Philippe Parreno: Thenabouts, ACMI (Australian Centre for the Moving Image), Melbourne, Australia \\- 6 December 2016 - 13 March 2017 Philippe Parreno: Anywhen, the 2016 Hyundai Commission for the Turbine Hall, Tate Modern, London \\- 4 October 2016 - 2 April 2017 2015 Hypothesis, HangarBicocca, Milan, Italy \\- 22 October 2015 - 14 February 2016 H {N} Y P N {Y} OSIS, Park Avenue Armory, New York, USA \\- 11 June 2015 - 2 August 2015 2013 Anywhere, Anywhere Out of the World, Palais de Tokyo, Paris, France \\- 23 October 2014 - 12 January 2014 Philippe Parreno, curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, The Garage Center for Contemporary Culture, Moscow, Russia 2012 Philippe Parreno, Fondation Beyeler, Basel, Switzerland 2010 Philippe Parreno, Serpentine Gallery, London, UK Philippe Parreno, CCS Bard, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, USA From November 5 Until They Fall Down, Castello di Rivoli, Torino, Italy 2009 November, Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, Ireland May, Kunsthalle Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland 8 Juin 1968, Centre Pompidou - Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019Art Moderne, Paris, France == Selected group exhibitions == 57th International Art Exhibition, La Biennale di Venezia, Venice, 13 May \u2013 26 November 2017 2016 The Eighth Climate (What Does Art Do?), 11th Gwangju Biennale, Korea 2015 All The World's Futures, 56th International Art Exhibition La Biennale di Venezia, Venice 2014 Lucas Burckhardt and Cedric Price - A stroll through a fun palace curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Pavilion of Switzerland, 14th International Architecture Exhibition, la Biennale de Venezia, Venice, Italy Solaris Chronicles, LUMA Foundation, Arles, France 2013 Light Show, Hayward Gallery, London, UK The Bride and the Bachelors: Duchamp with Cage, Cunningham, Rauschenberg and Johns curated by Carlos Basualdo, Barbican Art Gallery, Barbican Centre, London, UK 2012 Dancing around the Bride: Cage, Cunningham, Johns, Rauschenberg, and Duchamp curated by Carlos Basualdo in collaboration with Erica F.
