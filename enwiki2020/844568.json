    "text": "palm nut soup (right) Fufu Fufu (or foofoo, fufuo, foufou) is a staple food common in many countries in West Africa and Central Africa such as Sierra Leone, Guinea, Ghana, Liberia, Cote D'Ivoire, Benin, Togo, Nigeria, both Congos, Cameroon, the Central African Republic and Gabon, and is also found in the Caribbean. It is often made in the traditional Ghanaian, Nigerian and Cuba method by mixing and pounding separate equal portions of cassava and green plantain flour thoroughly with water. It is then adjusted to either increase or decrease the viscosity of the fufu depending on personal preferences. Other flours, such as semolina, maize flour or mashed plantains may take the place of cassava flour. Fufu is often served with groundnut soup, palm nut soup, abunuabunu or light soup. The traditional method is to boil starchy food crops like cassava, yams or plantains and cocoyams and then pound them into a dough- like consistency. Fufu is eaten with the fingers, and a small ball of it can be dipped into an accompanying soup or sauce. ==African fufu== Portuguese traders introduced cassava to Africa from Brazil in the 16th century. In Ghana, fufu, also known as fufuo, is white and sticky (if plantain is not mixed with the cassava when pounding). The traditional method of eating fufu is to pinch some of the fufu off in one's right hand fingers and form it into an easily ingested round ball. The ball is then dipped in the soup before being eaten. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the word \u201cfoutou\u201d is also used. Ivorian \u201cfoufou\u201d is specifically sweet mashed bananas, whereas the \u201cfoutou\u201d is a stronger, heavier pasta made of various staple foods such as yam, cassava, banana, taro or a mix of any of those. In the French-speaking regions of Cameroon, it is called \u201ccouscous\u201d (not to be confused with the North African dish couscous).DeLancey, Mark W., and Mark Dike DeLancey (2000). Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon, 3rd ed. Lanham, Maryland: The Scarecrow Press, p. 134. A similar staple in the African Great Lakes region is ugali. It is usually made from maize flour (masa), and is also eaten in Southern Africa. The name ugali is used to refer to the dish in Kenya and Tanzania. Closely related staples are called nshima in Zambia, nsima in Malawi, sadza in Zimbabwe, pap or vuswa in South Africa, posho in Uganda, luku, fufu, nshima, moteke, semoule, ugali and bugari in the Republic of the Congo and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and phalet\u0161he in Botswana. ==Caribbean fufu== In Caribbean nations with substantial populations of West African origin, such as Cuba, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Puerto Rico, plantains, yuca or yams are mashed with other ingredients (fuf\u00fa nigeriano). In Cuba, the dish retains its original African stem name, termed simply as fuf\u00fa or with added descriptive extensions like fuf\u00fa de platano or fuf\u00fa de platano pint\u00f3n. On other major islands, fuf\u00fa goes by the names of mang\u00fa in the Dominican Republic, mofongo and funche in Puerto Rico and bammy in Jamaica. What distinguishes the Caribbean \"fuf\u00fa\" from its West African relative is a firmer texture with stronger flavors. As it moves away from Cuba, the fuf\u00fa's core is less a gelatinous dough and more of a consistent mass. Puerto Rican mofongo, in keeping with the creolized cuisine traditions of the Caribbean, tends toward a fuf\u00fa of much higher density and robust seasoning. While keeping a conspicuous African character, mofongo has borrowed from the island's Iberian culinary tradition, to create a dish made of fried green plantains, yuca or breadfruit. Unlike the mushier Caribbean and West African fuf\u00fas, mofongo is generally firmer and crustier. Nigerian food: fufu being sold on the street in Lagos To prepare mofongo, green plantains are deep-fried once unlike twice fried tostones. Next, they are mashed in a 'pilon' (mortar) with chopped garlic, salt, black pepper and olive oil. The resulting mash is then pressed and rounded into a hollowed crusty orb. Meat, traditionally chicharr\u00f3n, is then stuffed into the chunky ball of fried green plantains. A few recipes call for a meat or vegetable salsa criolla\" (related to American Creole sauce) poured on top of the hot sphere. In the trendier \"mofongo relleno,\" typical of western Puerto Rico, seafood is all over, inside and outside. Traditional mofongo, as previously cited, comes seasoned and stuffed with meat and bathed in a chicken broth soup.Food and Identity in the Caribbean, Hanna Garth, Ed. 2013 Bloomsbury Press. Because of its elaborate process of preparation and its sundry ingredients, poet and blogger Arose N Daghetto called the mofongo a type of \"fuf\u00fa paella\" and branded it as \"the big daddy of fuf\u00fas.\" A dish called funche made with taro, green and yellow plantains boiled and mashed with butter, garlic, and pork fat was once popular in Puerto Rico. Once mashed it was formed into balls and eaten with broth made from sesame seeds. Funche is written in early Puerto Rican cookbooks around the 1800's, but can probably be traced back to African slaves on the island. Funche today in Puerto Rico is cornmeal cooked in coconut milk and milk. Wrapped fufu The vegetable or fuf\u00fa sauce in the Anglo-Caribbean is not fried first. Plantain is not used as much, as it is used in so many dishes. Fufu is usually part of, or added to, a soupy sauce or on the side with a soupy dish. In Antigua, fufu is served as part of the national dish but is called fungi/fungee and is made using cornmeal and okra. Similarly, in Barbados it serves as part of the national dish and is called cou cou and uses cornmeal or, less commonly, breadfruit instead, like several other English Caribbean islands. In Haiti it is called tum tum and Foofoo. It is mostly made of breadfruit but can be made of plantain or yams and is usually served with an okra based stew or soup. ==Origin== Fufu is believed to originate in what is modern-day Ghana,Siciliano-Rosen, L. \"Fufu.\" Encyclopedia Britannica.https://www.britannica.com/topic/fufu by the Asante, the Akuapem, the Guans, the Akyem, the Bono and the Fante peoples of the Akan ethnic group of Ghana. Today, it also features in Beninese cuisine, Togolese cuisine, Guinean cuisine, Cameroonian cuisine, as well as Nigerian cuisine. Fufu\u2019s prevalence in the West African subregion has been noted in literature produced by authors from that area. It is mentioned in Chinua Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart, for example. ==Preparation== Pounded fufu In Ghana, pieces of boiled cassava or other tubers are pounded together in a giant wooden mortar using a wooden pestle. In between blows from the pestle, the mixture is turned by hand and water gradually added till it becomes slurry and sticky. The mixture is then formed into a ball or a rounded slab and served. With the invention of the fufu machine preparation has become much less labour-intensive.
