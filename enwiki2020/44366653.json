The production of electric water heaters dates back to 1960, with the appearance of the Ariston brand, which would propel the Group to leader status in this sector in Italy with the dawn of the 1970s. Following the success of Ariston heaters, in the 1980s the company decided to enter the space heating sector and started manufacturing boilers. During the 1990s the company opened its first branches in Eastern Europe and Asia. In the same years Ariston Thermo acquired Racold, India's largest water heaters' manufacturer, and opened its first wholly owned plant in China. The early 21st century saw the acquisition in 2001 of several historical companies and brands in the heating and burner sectors, namely: Chaffoteaux, Elco, Cuenod and Rendamax. Over the two-year period 2004\u20132005, new plants were inaugurated in Hanoi and St Petersburg, while the acquisition of Ecoflam was completed, the latter among Italy's leading companies for heating systems; in 2008, after the acquisition of Termogamma SA, specialised in the production of heat pumps, the company opened its European centre of excellence for solar heating systems in Italy, in Serra de' Conti. In 2009, the company (until then part of MTS Group) changed its name to Ariston Thermo. Ariston Thermo acquired in 2011 Cipag SA and Domotec AG, leaders in Switzerland for the production, distribution and maintenance of water heating systems.http://www.ansa.it/web/notizie/regioni/marche/2011/07/11/visualizza_new.html_787057524.html Ansa \u2013 Ariston Thermo acquires Cipag and Domotec 2013 saw the acquisition of DhE, an Italian company specialised in heating elements for commercial and industrial applications, and the set up of a joint venture for the production and commercialisation in Uzbekistan of domestic heating systems.
