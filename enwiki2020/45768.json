He reigned from 1368 through 1383. His personal name was Yutanari (\u5bdb\u6210) and his regal name roughly translates to \"Long Celebration\". ==Genealogy== His father was Emperor Go-Murakami and his mother may have been Kaki Mon'in. Empress (ch\u016bg\u016b): Saionji Kinshige's daughter * Gy\u014dgo (\u884c\u609f; 1377\u20131406\uff09 Ny\u014dgo: Noriko (father and family unknown) * First son: Imperial Prince Tokiyasu (\u4e16\u6cf0\u89aa\u738b) Unknown * Kaimonji Kosho (\u6d77\u9580\u627f\u671d; 1374\u20131443) * Sonsei (\u5c0a\u8056; 1376\u20131432), * son: founder of Tamagawa family (\u7389\u5ddd\u5bae) ==Biography== On March 29, 1368 (Sh\u014dhei 23, 11th day of the 3rd month),Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 158. following the death of Emperor Murakami II, he was enthroned in the house of the Chief Priest at the Sumiyoshi Grand Shrine in Sumiyoshi, Osaka, where the Southern Court had made its capital. However, because the Southern Court's influence was declining, the enthronement remained in some doubt until the Taish\u014d period. In 1926, the enthronement was officially recognized and inserted into the Imperial Line. Emperor Ch\u014dkei insisted throughout his reign on fighting the Northern Dynasty, but it was already too late. In 1383 or 1384, he abdicated to Emperor Go-Kameyama, who supported the peace faction. After the reunification of the rival courts, he went into retirement and eventually returned to Yoshino where he died on August 27, 1394. The kami of Emperor Ch\u014dkei is venerated at Shish\u014d jinja in Totsugawa, Yamato province.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 128. ===Kugy\u014d=== Kugy\u014d (\u516c\u537f) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court's actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted. In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life's career. During Ch\u014dkei's reign, this apex of the Daij\u014d-kan included: * Sadaijin * Udaijin * Nadaijin * Dainagon ==Eras of Ch\u014dkei's reign== The years of Ch\u014dkei's reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or neng\u014d. :Nanboku-ch\u014d southern court *Eras as reckoned by legitimate Court (as determined by Meiji rescript) * Sh\u014dhei (1346\u20131370) * Kentoku (1370\u20131372) * Bunch\u016b (1372\u20131375) * Tenju (1375\u20131381) * K\u014dwa (1381\u20131384) :Nanboku-ch\u014d northern court *Eras as reckoned by pretender Court (as determined by Meiji rescript) * \u014can (1368\u20131375) * Eiwa (1375\u20131379) * K\u014dryaku (1379\u20131381) * Eitoku (1381\u20131384) ==Notes== Japanese Imperial kamon \u2014 a stylized chrysanthemum blossom == Works cited == * * Ponsonby-Fane, Richard Arthur Brabazon.
