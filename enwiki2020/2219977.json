Following Mr. Hall's death in 1990, Obadiah Harris, Ph.D. served as the second president and in 2001 opened the University of Philosophical Research, an accredited online university offering graduate programs in consciousness studies and transformational psychology and an undergraduate degree in liberal studies.

PRS maintains a research library of over 50,000 volumes, and also sells and publishes metaphysical and esoteric books, mostly those authored by Hall.
