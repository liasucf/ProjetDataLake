The Hics were originally formed as a two piece electronic indie band between Evans and Welsh, and were later joined by Matt Knox on bass. After feeling something was missing, they called on their old schoolmates Rox Barker, who joined as vocalist, and Geordan Reid-Campbell, who joined as guitarist. The band met their sixth member, Saxophonist David Turay, through the Jazz scene. The Hics got their name from Hickory, the wood from which some drumsticks are made. Their first single, \"Lines\", was released on 30 September 2012 through their soundcloud page. The song was soon picked up by BBC Radio 6 Music DJ Gilles Peterson, who played the song on his radio show on 6 October 2012, and later included it on his compilation Brownswood Bubblers Nine, released on 10 December 2012.
