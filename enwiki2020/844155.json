    "text": "The Sangre de Cristo Mountains (Spanish for \"Blood of Christ\") are the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains. They are located in southern Colorado and northern New Mexico in the United States. The mountains run from Poncha Pass in South-Central Colorado, trending southeast and south, ending at Glorieta Pass, southeast of Santa Fe, New Mexico. The mountains contain a number of fourteen thousand foot peaks in the Colorado portion, as well as all the peaks in New Mexico which are over thirteen thousand feet. The name of the mountains may refer to the occasional reddish hues observed during sunrise and sunset, and when alpenglow occurs, especially when the mountains are covered with snow. Although the particular origin of the name is unclear, it has been in use since the early 19th century. Before that time the terms \"La Sierra Nevada\", \"La Sierra Madre\", \"La Sierra\", and \"The Snowies\" (used by English speakers) were used.Robert Julyan, The Place Names of New Mexico, University of New Mexico Press, 1998. According to tradition, \"sangre de Cristo\" were the last words of a priest who was killed by Native Americans. ==Land management and recreation overview== Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the East of Santa Fe, taken during a winter sunset after a snowfall on 29 January 2013 Sangre de Cristo Mountain Range Much of the mountains are within various National Forests: the Rio Grande and San Isabel in Colorado, and the Carson and Santa Fe in New Mexico. These publicly accessible areas are managed by the United States Forest Service and are popular for hunting, camping, hiking, mountain biking, backpacking, climbing, and cross-country and downhill skiing. The mountains include two large wilderness areas, the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness in Colorado and the Pecos Wilderness in New Mexico, as well as some smaller wilderness areas, such as Latir Peak Wilderness. The Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve lies on the southwest side of the mountains in Colorado and are managed by the National Park Service. ==Subranges== The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are divided into various subranges, described here from north to south. Use of the terms \"Sangre de Cristo Range\" and \"Sangre de Cristo Mountains\" is inconsistent and either may refer to either the northernmost subrange, the southernmost subrange, or the mountains as a whole. ===Sangre de Cristo Range=== The Sangre de Cristo Range, the largest and most northerly subrange of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, runs directly along the east side of the Rio Grande Rift, extending southeast from Poncha Pass for about 75 miles (120 km) through south-central Colorado to La Veta Pass, approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of Walsenburg. They form a high ridge separating the San Luis Valley on the west from the watershed of the Arkansas River on the east. ===Crestones=== The Crestones are a group of four 14,000+ foot (4,268+ m) peaks (fourteeners) in the Sangre de Cristo Range above Crestone, Colorado. ===Spanish Peaks=== The Spanish Peaks are a pair of mountains, West Spanish Peak, , and East Spanish Peak, , located in southwestern Huerfano County, Colorado. The Spanish Peaks were designated a National Natural Landmark in 1976 as one of the best known examples of igneous dikes. The mountains can be seen from as far as to the north from Colorado Springs, to the west from Alamosa, Colorado, to the south from Raton, New Mexico, and to the east from La Junta, Colorado. ===Culebra Range=== The Culebra Range runs almost due north and south, with its northern limit at La Veta Pass in Colorado, and its southern limit at Costilla Creek, just south of Big Costilla Peak in New Mexico. Its highest point is Culebra Peak at , which is notable for being the only fourteener in Colorado which is on private land. Climbers wishing to ascend Culebra must pay a fee (currently US$100 per person), and the number of climbers per year is limited. It is also the most southerly fourteener in the U.S. Rockies. Standing to the east of the main crest are the two prominent Spanish Peaks (West: , East: ). These peaks were important landmarks on the mountain branch of the Santa Fe Trail.The bioregion receives very little water and has an annual precipitation of .This region is also home to the Culebra Micro-basin which has a rich agricultural history in the state of Colorado. ===Taos Mountains=== The Taos Mountains span the western lobe of the range from Costilla Creek in the north, to Tres Ritos in the south.Butterfield, Mike, and Greene, Peter, Mike Butterfield's Guide to the Mountains of New Mexico, New Mexico Magazine Press, 2006, Some sources only include the region north of Palo Flechado Pass in the Taos Mountains; however they do not give a specific subrange name to the entire southern portion. See for example the 1:250,000 scale USGS maps. They include the highest point in New Mexico, Wheeler Peak, at , which is part of the Wheeler Peak Wilderness. Other notable peaks include Pueblo Peak, which at rises dramatically above Taos Pueblo, and Latir Peak, at . Williams Lake is located below Wheeler Peak in the Wheeler Peak Wilderness. Taos Ski Valley lies just to the west of Wheeler Peak. Much of the central portion of the Taos Mountains is on Taos Pueblo land. As viewed from Taos, they are locally called \"Taos Mountain.\" The southern portion of the Taos Mountains, between Palo Flechado Pass and Tres Ritos (U.S. Route 64 and NM Route 518), is lower and less dramatic than the northern section, with its high point being Cerro Vista, . The Fernando Mountains are a small subrange lying in this section, just south of US Route 64. ===Cimarron Range=== The Cimarron Range lies across the Moreno Valley to the east of the Taos Mountains. It is a lower range, with its highest point being Baldy Mountain at . The Philmont Scout Ranch lies on the east side of the Cimarron Range. ===Rincon Mountains=== This is a minor subrange, significantly lower than the rest of the Sangre de Cristos; it lies east of the southernmost portion of the Taos Mountains. ===Santa Fe Mountains=== Rounding out the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are the Santa Fe Mountains, which include all peaks south of NM Route 518. This group lies near Santa Fe and surrounds the Pecos Wilderness, which protects the source watershed of the Pecos River. The peaks include Truchas Peak, , as their highest point. Other notable peaks are Santa Fe Baldy () and Jicarita Peak (). The Pecos Wilderness is crossed by many trails and is popular for backpacking and for fishing in its high alpine lakes. ==Prominent peaks== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Peaks !Rank !Mountain Peak !Subrange !Elevation !Prominence !Isolation !

They are bounded on the west by the Rio Grande rift and on the east by a series of reverse and thrust faults. Vertical displacement along the faults is at least , and gravity measurements suggest the uplift has been thrust eastward great distances. This faulting places Precambrian basement rock in contact with sedimentary strata along the eastern margin of the uplift except where igneous rocks have been intruded along the fault. ==See also== *Glorieta Pass *Valle Vidal *Vietnam Veterans Memorial State Park *Southern Rocky Mountains ==References== ==External links== * *Sangre de Cristo Mountains @ Peakbagger *List of the 13-ers in Sangre de Cristo *NPS\u2014TwHP: \u201cGlorieta and Raton Passes: Gateways to the Southwest\u201d \u2014 a National Park Service Teaching with Historic Places (TwHP) lesson plan.
