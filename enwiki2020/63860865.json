    "text": "Mawalan Marika (c.1908-1967) was an Aboriginal Australian artist and the leader of the Rirratjingu clan of north-east Arnhem Land, Northern Australia. He is known for his bark paintings, carvings and political activism. == Biography == Mawalan Marika was born in 1908 in Yirrkala. His clan falls under the Dhuwa moiety, one of the two moieties found in Arnhem Land. In addition to being an important asset to many anthropologists including Charles P. Mountford and Ronald Berndt, he was one of the most prominent political activists of his time. Marika was a signatory of the Yirrkala bark petitions sent to the Australian government in 1963. Marika was one of the first artists to break from tradition and teach his daughters (i.e women) how to paint the sacred madayin clan designs. Mawalan advocated for the teaching of Yol\u014bu culture to the general Australian population and negotiated the foundation of a Methodist mission at Yirrkala in 1935. One way he tried to encourage this transmission of knowledge was the establishment of commercial production of bark paintings through the mission. == Career == Marika painted over 40 works, many of which can be found in art collections of museums or private collectors. In the 1950s, he helped to create a commercial bark painting environment at the Yirrkala mission and collaborated in the creation of the Yirrkala Church Panels. One of Marika's figurative traits is that he often paints the Djang'kawu sisters, who are said to be the creator beings of the Dhuwa moiety. The Marika family see themselves as direct descendants of the Djang'kawu. Mawalan created an entire series of paintings detailing the journey on the Djang'kawu sisters into country. As well as being known for his bark paintings, Marika had a high level of skill in carving and sculpture. His sculptures are cleanly painted with clan designs and finished with feathers, human hair, or other such natural attachments. His style is characteristic of the Dhuwa moiety, featuring many dots, diagonal lines, and geometric/diamond shapes. One of the innovations for which Marika is credited is the use of episodic or panel style bark paintings and breaking away from the use of rarrk by using dotting techniques and more figural elements. A notable trait of many of his paintings is the striking use of yellow ochre, which features heavily in all his works, be they sculptural or painted. Many of his works, like most Arnhem Land painters, deal with subjects relating to the sacred stories and ceremonies of the clan. == Collections == * Art Gallery of New South Wales * Kluge-Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection of the University of Virginia * National Gallery of Australia * National Gallery of Victoria == Significant exhibitions == * Old Masters Exhibition - National Gallery of Australia * The Art of Arnhem Land - Perth, 1957 * Dreamings - New York, 1988 * Aratjara - Europe, 199394 * Yalangbara: Art of the Djang'kawu - National Museum of Australia, 201011 == References == == Further reading == * * * * == External links == Category:Australian Aboriginal artists Category:1908 births Category:1967 deaths ",
