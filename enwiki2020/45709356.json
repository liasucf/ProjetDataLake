    "text": "This is a list of battalions of the Durham Light Infantry, which existed as a regiment of the British Army from 1881 to 1968. ==Original composition== Victoria crown cap badge of the Durham Light Infantry (1881\u20141902) When the 68th Regiment of Foot and the 106th Regiment of Foot became the Durham Light Infantry (DLI) in 1881 under the Cardwell-Childers reforms of the British Armed Forces, seven pre-existing militia and volunteer battalions of County Durham were integrated into the structure of the DLI. These latter battalions had existed intermittently for some time, but had been made permanent in reaction to a perceived threat of invasion by France the late 1850s.Beckett p. 164Ward pp. 10-22Vane pp.288-297 The militia, in two battalions, were more appealing to the working classes as the equipment was government funded, while the volunteers were organised as \"rifle volunteer corps\", independent of the British Army, financially self-supporting and composed primarily of the middle class, they underwent a number of reorganisations before reaching the form in which they were incorporated into the county regiment.Ward pp. 252-263Vane pp. 297-298Vane pp.304-306 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- !Battalion !Formed !Formerly !Depot/Headquarters |- ! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#bdb;\"|Regular |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |1st |25 August 1756Vane pp.1-3 |2/23rd Regiment of Foot, 68th Regiment of Foot (Lambton's Regiment of Foot) (22 April 1758Ward p. 27), 68th (Durham) Regiment of Foot (15 August 1782Ward p. 60), 68th (Durham) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) (late 1808Vane p. 40) |Sunderland (since 1873) |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |2nd |1839Vane p. 107 |2nd Bombay European Regiment, 2nd Regiment Bombay European Light Infantry (1840Vane p. 109), 2nd European Regiment Bombay Light Infantry (14 December 1854Vane p. 112), Her Majesty's 2nd Regiment of Bombay European Light Infantry (3 November 1859Ward p.239), 106th Regiment Bombay Light Infantry (30 July 1862Ward p. 242) |Sunderland (since 1873) |- ! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#deb887;\"|Militia |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |3rd (Militia) |1759 |1st Durham FusiliersWard p. 252 |Barnard Castle (since 1853) |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |4th (Militia) |1853 |2nd North Durham Militia |Durham (since 1853) |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" ! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#bbd;\"|Volunteers |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |1st Durham Rifle Volunteer Battalion |December 1861 |4th Administrative Battalion Durham Rifle Volunteer CorpsWard pp. 263-4Westlake, pp. 74\u20138. |Stockton |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |2nd Durham Rifle Volunteer Battalion |August 1861 |2nd Administrative Battalion Durham Rifle Volunteer Corps |Bishop Auckland |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |3rd (Sunderland) Durham Rifle Volunteer Battalion |February 1861 |3rd (The Sunderland) Durham Rifle Volunteer CorpsDunn. |Sunderland |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |4th Durham Rifle Volunteer Battalion |August 1861 |1st Administrative Battalion Durham Rifle Volunteer Corps |Chester-le-Street |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |5th Durham Rifle Volunteer Battalion |August 1861 |3rd Administrative Battalion Durham Rifle Volunteer Corps |Gateshead |} In December 1887 the Durham Rifle Volunteer Battalions were renamed as Volunteer Battalions of the Durham Light Infantry retaining their Administrative battalion numbers.Vane p. 307 The 3rd Corps sub-title was granted in 1867, with the slight change officially registered in 1887.Westlake p.75 ==Reorganisation== The Territorial Force (renamed the Territorial Army in 1920) was formed in 1908, from the volunteer infantry battalions of the county regiments, and other volunteer arms. The militia battalions transferred to the \"Reserve\" or the \"Special Reserve\". The 3rd and 4th battalions exchanged numbers that year, and were recast as the 3rd (Reserve) and 4th (Extra Reserve) battalions in a draft finding role.Ward p. 255 The reason for this apparently pointless exchange of numbers was that in the event of a mobilisation the War Office intended to use the 3rd battalion of a regiment to provide reinforcements for the regular battalions, while if a regiment had a 4th battalion it would be mobilised as a whole unit. The older unit (1st Durham Fusiliers, then the 3rd battalion) wished to remain as a fighting unit, and so exchanged numbers.Order of Service (4th) All volunteer battalions were renumbered to create a single numerical sequence.Ward p. 266 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- !Battalion !Formerly |- |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |3rd (Reserve)||4th (Militia) |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |4th (Extra Reserve)||3rd (Militia) |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |5th||1st Volunteer Battalion |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |6th||2nd Volunteer Battalion |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |7th||3rd Volunteer Battalion |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |8th||4th Volunteer Battalion |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |9th||5th Volunteer Battalion |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |} ==First World War== Brass shoulder title as used by regulars and service battalions in the First World War The Durham Light Infantry would send 22 battalions overseas and lose 12006 other ranks during the course of the war.Ward pps. 334, 446 The regiment's territorial components formed duplicate second and third line battalions of progressively lower fitness men.Ward p. 332 Many new battalions, technically of the Regular Army, were formed as part of Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener's appeal for an initial 100,000 men volunteers in August 1914, referred to as the New Army or Kitchener's Army. The 18th and 20th Service battalions, were referred to as \"Pals\" because they were predominantly composed of work colleagues, the 19th battalion was originally a Bantam battalion.Ward pp. 328-329 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- !Battalion !Date Formed !Service !Fate !Notes |- ! colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#bdb;\"|Regular |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |1st |22 April 1756 |India (NWF), Afghanistan | |One of eight out of the 52 regular Army infantry battalions ordered to stay in India.Ward Ch10 |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |2nd |1839 |Western Front, Army of Occupation | |Attached to 18th Brigade, 6th Division throughout the war.
