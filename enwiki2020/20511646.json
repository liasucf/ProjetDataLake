The agency is responsible for collecting, reporting and disseminating intelligence, and conducting counter-intelligence in the interest of Serbia's national security. ==History== The Security Intelligence Agency (BIA) was formed on 1 August 2002 as the successor of State Security Service (SDB), which existed from 1991 to 2002. Its function is similar to that of the CIA in the United States or the MI6 in the United Kingdom. ===2017\u2013present=== In May 2017, Bratislav Ga\u0161i\u0107, former Minister of Defence and close associate of outgoing Prime Minister and newly elected President, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, was appointed as the head of the Security Intelligence Agency. Following his appointment, Ga\u0161i\u0107 suspended his activities in the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS). In August 2017, an amendments to the Law on the Security and Information Agency, which strengthen the authorities of the agency's director, have arrived in the National Assembly for adoption. This move was condemned by several officials including the Commissioner for Information of Public Importance Rodoljub \u0160abi\u0107 and former co-Minister of Internal Affairs Bo\u017eo Prelevi\u0107. They have stated that these amendments are unconstitutional and thus way creating a platform for \"party's intelligence agency\" of SNS, aimed at the opposition and \"domestic traitors\" who disagree with the ruling regime. ==Directors== Source: ; Status {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:right; text-align:center\" !No. !Portrait !Name !Took office !Left office |- bgcolor=\"#e6e6aa\" !\u2013 |75px |Andreja Savi\u0107 |1 August 2002 |24 January 2003 |- !1 |75px |Mi\u0161a Mili\u0107evi\u0107 |25 January 2003 |6 March 2004 |- !2 |75px |Rade Bulatovi\u0107 |6 March 2004 |17 July 2008 |- !3 |75px |Sa\u0161a Vukadinovi\u0107 |17 July 2008 |3 August 2012 |- !4 |75px |Neboj\u0161a Rodi\u0107 |3 August 2012 |3 September 2013 |- bgcolor=\"#e6e6aa\" !\u2013 |75px |Dragan Markovi\u0107 |3 September 2013 |25 October 2013 |- !5 |75px |Aleksandar \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 |25 October 2013 |23 May 2017 |- !6 |75px |Bratislav Ga\u0161i\u0107 |23 May 2017 |Incumbent |} ==See also== * Military Intelligence Agency (VOA) * Military Security Agency (VBA) * Intelligence and Reconnaissance Directorate *List of intelligence agencies ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:2002 establishments in Serbia Category:Government agencies established in 2002 Category:Counter-intelligence agencies Category:Serbian intelligence agencies Category:Law enforcement in Serbia ",
