    "text": "Ch\u00e2teau de La Palice The Ch\u00e2teau de La Palice is a castle, developed into a ch\u00e2teau, in the commune of Lapalisse in the Allier d\u00e9partement of the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes r\u00e9gion of France. == History == Built between the 11th and 13th centuries, the feudal part of the castle was acquired by Jacques I de Chabannes in 1430. His grandson, Jacques II, mar\u00e9chal of France, built the Renaissance wing at the beginning of the 16th century out of rose-coloured bricks, endowing the castle with sobriety and elegance. This wing replaced the wall connecting the fortress to the Gothic style chapel, itself built c.1470. The ceilings have raised colourful box beams inlaid with gold. Today, the fully furnished living rooms contain many historical artefacts as a museum of the castle's history. The Ch\u00e2teau de La Palice is listed as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture. == See also == * List of castles in France ==References== == External links == * La Palice Castle - information * Ministry of Culture database entry for Ch\u00e2teau de La Palice * Ministry of Culture photos Category:Castles in Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Category:Ch\u00e2teaux in Allier Category:Monuments historiques of Allier Category:Historic house museums in Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Category:Museums in Allier ",
