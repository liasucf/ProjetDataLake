Criticising Tom she states: \"For a little while, it seemed as though the Birdseye Botherer had disappeared from the planet, but no, he's back to taunt us, this time with his underage drinking and the overreaction to it. He's been nine for about two years now, and still acts like a toddler. Still, I suppose he won\u2019t need to grow up much given the general IQ of the male populace of Hollyoaks.\" The character was voted 'Soaps Greatest Ever Child' in a 2009 Inside Soap poll and has been nominated for several awards at The British Soap Awards and Inside Soap Awards. At the 2012 Inside Soap Awards Hollins was nominated for \"Best Young Actor\" and has won the award in 2005, 2006 and 2008.
