In 1925 the pair moved to Los Angeles, eventually forming the Rhythm Boys trio with Harry Barris. ==Biography== Barris wrote the songs \"Mississippi Mud\", \"I Surrender, Dear\", and \"Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams\". The singing group worked with Paul Whiteman's Big Band for three years. They went out on their own for a year until Crosby effectively dissolved the group to go solo. The Rhythm Boys were filmed for the movie The King of Jazz (1930) singing \"Mississippi Mud\", \"So the Bluebirds and the Blackbirds Got Together\", \"A Bench in the Park\", and \"Happy Feet\". According to a filmed interview of Rinker, Crosby performed the first two weeks on his first film while on daytime work release from jail after crashing his car into a telephone pole while driving drunk. After the Rhythm Boys broke up, they reunited once on the Paul Whiteman Presents radio broadcast on July 4, 1943. In 1952, a song for which Rinker wrote the music with lyrics by Floyd Huddleston, \"You Can't Do Wrong Doin' Right\", appeared in the films Push-Button Kitty and The Affairs of Dobie Gillis. \"You Can't Do Wrong Doin' Right\" also previously appeared in the 1950 film Duchess Of Idaho. He also wrote the song \"Everybody Wants to Be a Cat\" also with Floyd Huddleston for the Disney animated children's movie The Aristocats (1970).
