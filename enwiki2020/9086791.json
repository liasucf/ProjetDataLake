It had the distinction of being one of the few Bon Jovi songs to be played at virtually every live concert since its introduction, until The Circle Tour in 2010, where it was only played occasionally. When played, it is often incorporated into a medley with a cover song inserted into the middle, such as \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" by The Rolling Stones, or \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\" by The Undisputed Truth. Concert footage of \"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\" can be viewed on the Live From London and The Crush Tour DVDs. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !Chart (1993) !Peak position |- |- |- |- !scope=row|Finland (Suomen virallinen lista) |align=\"center\"|20 |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|US Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks (Billboard) |style=\"text-align:center;\"|29 |- |} ==Notes== * ==References== ==External links== * Category:Bon Jovi songs Category:1993 singles Category:Songs written by Desmond Child Category:Songs written by Richie Sambora Category:Songs written by Jon Bon Jovi Category:Song recordings produced by Bob Rock Category:1992 songs Category:Mercury Records singles Category:Cultural depictions of Jim Morrison ",
