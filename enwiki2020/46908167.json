    "text": "El Salvador Symphony Orchestra (Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de El Salvador; OSES) is the national symphony orchestra of El Salvador. Founded in 1922, by Paul M\u00fcller, it is one of Central America's oldest orchestras. Originally formed as the Banda de los Supremos Poderes (Supreme Powers Band), it was renamed the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica del Ej\u00e9rcito (Army Symphony Orchestra), before taking its current name. Esteban Servell\u00f3n and Humberto Pacas have served as its conductors. The OSES was preceded by two earlier classical music groups, the Philharmonic Society of El Salvador (1875) and the National Orchestral Society (1910). OSES is funded by government and private sources. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * ==External links== *Official website (in Spanish) Category:1922 establishments in El Salvador Category:Symphony orchestras Category:Musical groups established in 1922 ",
