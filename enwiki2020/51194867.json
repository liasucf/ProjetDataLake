He obtained the title \"honoured artist\" in 1965. == Biography == Prokopiev was born on 18 July 1904 in Kyustendil, Bulgaria to a teacher's family. After finishing secondary school, in 1923, he moved to Leipzig to study the violin with H. Wassermann, followed by specializations in Paris with Lucien Capet in 1924 and 1926, in P\u00edsek with the violin pedagogue Otakar \u0160ev\u010d\u00edk in 1925 and 1927, as well as in Berlin at the Stern'sches Konservatorium with Carl Flesch from 1928 to 1930.Encyclopedia of Bulgarian Music Culture. Publishing House of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, 1967, page 370. In 1930, Prokopiev returned to Bulgaria and became a music teacher in the American College of Sofia, establishing his own private music school that existed until 1936. In 1940, he taught at the First Male Gymnasium of Sofia. During the Second World War, Prokopiev had the idea of creating the vocal choir of the Bulgarian army. Soon after the Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1944, he established the Representative Choir to the Bulgarian People's Army, renamed afterwards as Ensemble for Songs and Dances of the BPA, and nowadays: Representative Ensemble of the Bulgarian Armed Forces. Prokopiev was conductor of the choir until 1957. The first choir's performance took place in 1944, a concert by 26 vocalists. Later, Prokopiev started attracting instrumentalists, too, as well as some of the finest Bulgarian opera singers of the time, such as Dimitar Uzunov and Nikola Nikolov, as well as the composer Asen Karastoyanov, who composed approximately 50 songs especially for the choir.\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u0430\u043d\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0431\u044a\u043b \u043d\u0430 \u0412\u044a\u043e\u0440\u044a\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438 70 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u044f \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430, \u0421\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u041d\u0420, 1 October 2014 In 1941, Prokopiev wrote \"Methodics of singing\", in which he developed the topic of singing as a separate subject in Bulgarian schools.
