The species broad-based leaves that are peltate, with a glabrous peduncle, an acuminate tip and nearly entire margin, resembled that of Begonia hernandioides. However, there are differences, in that B. hernandioides had red-colored stipule that is broadly ovate, the petiole and abaxial lamina is pubescent, and the peltate leaves are elliptic. ==Etymology== The specific epithet refers to the name of the municipality of Adams, where the species was first documented. ==References== ==External links== *Begonia adamsensis (Sect.
