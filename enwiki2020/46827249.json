    "text": "Nikola Stepani\u0107 Selni\u010dki (, ) was a Catholic bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of P\u00e9cs (1596-1598) and Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb (1598-1602). With his 1598 and 1599 activities aimed to impose his feudal authority over Serbs who populated a year earlier vast territories in Slavonia, abandoned for more than 40 years, he initiated the \"Vlach question\". == Early life == According to Sakcinski, Selni\u010dki was born in Selnica near Konj\u0161\u0107ina in 1553 in a family which is a branch of Turopolje nobility. According to some other sources Selni\u010dki was a son of Stephan from Bosnia, who descended from a noble family. He studied in at University of Paris and in Bologne. He wrote a chronicle with detailed description of the 1593 Battle of Sisak which is not preserved. == Vlach question == When Serb settlers came to Habsburg military frontier (in modern-day Croatia) they were settled on the land which remained vacant for more than 40 years. Soon after Serbs were settled in Slavonia, Selni\u010dki began with his activities against them. In 1598 Selni\u010dki received information that emperor Rudolf was going to grant Serbs privileges which would guarantee their status of people free from their feudal obligations. Selni\u010dki was the first of Croatian nobility who tried to impose his rule over Serb settlers. Furthermore, Selni\u010dki actually was the initiator of the \"Vlach question\" in Croatia with his intention to impose his feudal authority over Serbs, populated a year earlier on his estates by Vara\u017edin general Sigismund. In July 1599 Selni\u010dki requested that Serbs (Vlachs) populated a year before on the territory of his estates should not be given any privileges. == References == == Sources == * * * * * == External links == * Website of the Archdiocese of Zagreb, a page about Nikola Selni\u010dki Category:1553 births Category:1602 deaths Category:16th-century Jesuits Category:17th-century Jesuits Category:Anti-Serbian sentiment ",
