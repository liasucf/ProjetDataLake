    "text": "Giuseppe Cei. Giuseppe Cei (January 25, 1889 \u2013 March 28, 1911) was an Italian aviation pioneer. He was born in C\u00e0scina, Tuscany, and showed a precocious talent for mechanics from a very early age. He also obtained good results as a fencer, winning the sabre prize in the International Contest held at Milano in 1908. In the late 1909, he moved to Paris, France. He studied in the Roche School for Aeronautics and Mechanic Constructions, graduating in engineering. In the same period he started to fly planes at the Issy-les-Moulineaux airfield. On January 1, 1911 he received the 35th piloting license in Italy. Later his aerobatic performances in Paris, riding a Farman biplane, led the French President Armand Falli\u00e8res to declare him Le roi de l'air (\"The King of the Air\"). Cei died on March 28 of that year when his plane crashed on Rotschild Island near Puteaux. His funeral was celebrated by a large crowd in Paris. Later his body was buried in his native city. ==External links== *Page at EarlyAviatiors.com Category:1889 births Category:1911 deaths Category:People from the Province of Pisa Category:Aviation pioneers Category:Italian engineers Category:Italian male fencers Category:20th-century engineers ",
