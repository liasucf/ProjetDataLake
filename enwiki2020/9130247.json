    "text": "The Codes is the English title for Szyfry, a Polish film released in 1966, directed by Wojciech Has. ==Story== Tadeusz (Jan Kreczmar) is a Polish veteran of World War II who fled to London at the end of the war, leaving behind his wife Zofia (Irena Eichler\u00f3wna) and two sons, Maciek (Zbigniew CybulskiDirectory of World Cinema, Volume 8 edited by Adam Bingham, v. 8 p. 15) and Jedrek, who disappeared when he was 17 years old. Tadeusz returns to Krak\u00f3w to discover if Jedrek may be alive. His wife and son Maciek were members of resistance - was it possible that the second son may have been the traitor? During Maciek's struggle to explain to his father their history during German occupation, questions arise concerning collaboration with the Gestapo and retribution by the Home Army. Has pictures the mystical lost boy in a dark fairy-tale forest, full of the war's ghosts and wholesale executions. The hypnotic quality of these excursions foreshadows the mesmerizing passages of Has' later film, The Hour-Glass Sanatorium. ==Cast== *Jan Kreczmar as Tadeusz *Zbigniew Cybulski as Maciek *Ignacy Gogolewski as Doctor Gross *Irena Horecka as Aunt Helena *Janusz Klosinski as Antiquary *Adam Dzieszynski as Receptionist in 'Hotel Polski' *Irena Eichler\u00f3wna as Zofia *Janusz Gajos as White monk *Barbara Krafft\u00f3wna as Jadwiga *Zofia Merle as Forester's daughter *Kazimierz Opali\u0144ski as Pieczara *Irena Orska as Neighbor == See also == *Cinema of Poland *List of Polish-language films ==References== ==External links== * Category:1966 films Category:Polish films Category:Films directed by Wojciech Has Category:Polish-language films ",
