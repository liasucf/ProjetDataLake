Within a few years, he decided to take his business nationwide, launching MyStateInsurance.com in 2001. In 2007, he purchased the HomeInsurance.com web domain and quickly became one of the first resources to enable insurance comparison shopping, online and off. In 2010, the company purchase HomeownersInsurance.com to build out its footprint, and in 2011 it was ranked 61st on the Inc. 500 list of fastest-growing U.S. companies. In March 2012, Red Ventures, a marketing and sales company, acquired HomeInsurance.com, while keeping the company headquarters in Wilmington.
