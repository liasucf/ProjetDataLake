    "text": "Giovanni J. Ughi (born Padova, Italy), engineer and scientist, is one of the inventors of multimodality Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Laser- induced fluorescence molecular imaging, pioneering a first-in-man study of coronary arteries during his work at Massachusetts General Hospital. The results of his work, combining two imaging technologies, may better identify dangerous coronary plaques, responsible for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. He also was one of the pioneers of targeted molecular imaging of human atherosclerosis, determining the use of a FDA approved molecular agent (i.e., indocyanine green (ICG)-enhanced near-infrared fluorescence) that can illuminate high-risk features of human carotid atherosclerotic plaques and other molecular agents for the identification of unhealed stents that are at higher risk of stent thrombosis. Dr. Ughi also made significant contributions to the development of methods for the computer- based, automated analysis of Intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, helping the widespread adoption of intracoronary OCT imaging technology. He is recognized for the development of methods for the automatic quantification of stent characteristics on intracoronary optical coherence tomography images. He authored over 40 papers in peer-reviewed scientific international journals. == References == ==External links== * Does New Dual- Modality Imaging Come Closer to Uncovering Vulnerable Plaques? * OCT, fluorescence imaging pair to better identify heart attack-prone coronary plaques * Science Daily: Combining two imaging technologies may better identify dangerous coronary plaques * Bullock Fellowship Award * Giovanni J.
