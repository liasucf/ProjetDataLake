    "text": "Kirkbymoorside () is a small market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England, about north of York, midway between Pickering and Helmsley, on the edge of the North York Moors National Park. It has a population of about 3,000, measured in the 2011 Census as 3,040. ==History== Kirkbymoorside is noted as Chirchebi in the Domesday Book of 1086. It has served as a trading hub at least since 1254, when it became a market town. There are two ancient coaching inns extant, the Black Swan with its carved porch, and the cruck-framed George and Dragon, which originated in the 13th century. The Georgian fa\u00e7ades point to later periods of commercial prosperity on the coaching route between York and Scarborough.Town Council website: Retrieved 10 April 2011. Some Ancient British, Viking and Anglo- Saxon remains have been found in the vicinity. The Norman baron Robert de Stuteville built a wooden moated castle on Vivers Hill. The estate passed to the Wake family in the 13th century, who brought prosperity to the town. However, it was badly hit by the Black Death of the mid-14th century, after which the wooden castle lay in ruins. Prosperity returned after 1408, when the Neville family took over, although little remains of the fortified manor they built to the north of the town. The Nevilles remained Catholic and took part in the Rising of the North of 1569. By 1660 there was a grammar school. (The building is now part of the library.) The great Toll Booth in the middle of the town was built about 1730 with stone taken from the Nevilles' manor. The old Market Hall was gutted by fire but rebuilt in 1872. By 1881 the population of the town was 2,337.Town Council website: Retrieved 10 April 2011. There is some dispute as to the correct spelling (the alternative spelling being Kirbymoorside (which is how the railway companies spelt the name on the station), as it is traditionally pronounced), but it is usually and officially spelled with the \"k\". Signposts also read \"Kirkbymoorside\". \"Kirk\" means church and \"-by\" is the Viking word for settlement, so the name translates as \"settlement with a church by the moorside\", or, as Ekwall argues, Moorside is \"Moresheved\" which means \"top of the moor\". A valley near the town is known as Kirkdale. More recently, Kirkbymoorside was the last town in England to adopt double yellow lines to restrict parking.

The track was lifted by August 1965. The last passenger trains ran in the early 1950s, but a goods train ran from Malton via Gilling East until 1964. The rails between Kirkbymoorside and Pickering were lifted in the 1950s and the main A170 road runs over part of the track bed to the east of the town. There were plans, since withdrawn, for a Tesco store to be built on the site of the old railway station, which caused some controversy. The station buildings were demolished in 2010 and the site is now occupied, in part, by new houses.
