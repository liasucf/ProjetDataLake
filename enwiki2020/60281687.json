On 30 April 2020, Paris Saint-Germain were awarded the championship based on PPG ratio following the early cancellation of the 2019\u201320 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They subsequently claimed both national cups to achieve a domestic treble. Furthermore, the team then qualified for its first-ever Champions League final, hoping to win its first European trophy since 1996. However, they were defeated by Bayern Munich 0\u20131. ==Players== French teams are limited to four players without EU citizenship. Hence, the squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries\u2014countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement\u2014are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling. ===Current squad=== ==Transfers== === In === For recent transfers see List of French football transfers summer 2019 {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! ! !scope=col|Player !Transferred From !scope=col|Fee !scope=col|Date !scope=col|Source |- |align=center|21 |align=center| | | Manchester United |Free | | |- |align=center|19 |align=center| | | Sevilla |\u20ac19,500,000 | | |- |align=center|30 |align=center| | | Chelsea |Free | | |- |align=center|25 |align=center| | | Ajax |Free | | |- |align=center|22 |align=center| | | Borussia Dortmund |\u20ac32,000,000 | | |- |align=center|27 |align=center| | | Everton |\u20ac30,000,000 | | |- |align=center|16 |align=center| | | Sevilla |Loan | | |- |align=center|1 |align=center| | | Real Madrid |\u20ac13,000,000 | | |- |align=center|18 |align=center| | | Inter |Loan | | |} === Out === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! ! !scope=col|Player !Transferred To !!scope=col; style=\"width: 65px;\"|Fee !scope=col|Date !scope=col|Source |- |align=center|1 |align=center| | | Juventus |Free | | |- |align=center|25 |align=center| | | Juventus |Free | | |- |align=center|13 |align=center| | | S\u00e3o Paulo |Free | | |- |align=center|27 |align=center| | | Bayer Leverkusen |\u20ac15,000,000 | | |- |align=center|\u2014 |align=center| | | Lens |\u20ac1,000,000 | | |- |align=center|21 |align=center| | | Lille |\u20ac10,000,000 | | |- |align=center|18 |align=center| | | Real Betis |\u20ac21,000,000 | | |- |align=center|\u2014 |align=center| | | Lokomotiv Moscow |\u20ac12,000,000 | | |- |align=center|24 |align=center| | | RB Leipzig |\u20ac15,000,000 | | |- |align=center|\u2014 |align=center| | | Eintracht Frankfurt |\u20ac10,000,000 | | |- |align=center|\u2014 |align=center| | | Charleroi |Free | | |- |align=center|\u2014 |align=center| | | Hermannstadt |Free | | |- |align=center|\u2014 |align=center| | | Avranches |Free | | |- |align=center|37 |align=center| | | Monaco |\u20ac10,000,000 | | |- |align=center|34 |align=center| | | Nice |\u20ac12,500,000 | | |- |align=center|\u2014 |align=center| | | Rennes |Free | | |- |align=center|16 |align=center| | | Real Madrid |Loan | | |- |align=center|29 |align=center| | | Sporting CP |Loan | | |- |align=center|\u2014 |align=center| | | Avranches |Free | | |} ==Kits== {| | | | | | | |} ==Pre-season and friendlies== ==Competitions== ===Overview=== ===Troph\u00e9e des Champions=== ===Ligue 1=== ====League table==== ====Results summary==== ====Results by round==== ====Matches==== The Ligue 1 schedule was announced on 14 June 2019.
