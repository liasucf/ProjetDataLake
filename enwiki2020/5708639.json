    "text": "Platygonus (\"flat head\" in reference to the straight shape of the forehead) is an extinct genus of herbivorous peccaries of the family Tayassuidae, endemic to North and South America from the Miocene through Pleistocene epochs (10.3 million to 11,000 years ago), existing for about . == Description == Restoration Platygonus were gregarious animals and, like modern peccaries, possibly traveled in herds. At least nine known species of Platygonus are known and ranged from southern Canada to Mexico and from California to Pennsylvania. Stratigraphically, they occur throughout the Pleistocene (Calabrian), and as early as the Blancan in the Gelasian of the Pliocene. The most recent credible date obtained for some species remains is about 11,000 BP. They probably appeared very similar to their closest living relative, the Chacoan peccary. == Taxonomy == Platygonus compressus skull in The Children\u2019s Museum of Indianapolis Platygonus was named by John Lawrence LeConte in 1848 for fossils found in Pleistocene karst deposits in Illinois, which are now preserved in the Academy of National Sciences in Philadelphia. The following species of Platygonus have been described: * P. bicalcaratus (nomen dubium) * P. brachirostris * P. chapadmalensis * P. cinctus * P. compressus (type) * P. kraglievichi * P. marplatensis * P. narinoensis * P. oregonensis * P. pearcei * P. pollenae * P. scagliae * P. setiger * P. striatus * P. texanus * P. vetus == Morphology == Most Platygonus species were similar in size to modern peccaries especially giant peccary, at around in body length, and had long legs, allowing them to run well. They also had a pig-like snout and long tusks which were probably used to fend off predators. They had a complex digestive system, similar to that of a modern ruminant. == Distribution == Fossils of Platygonus have been found in: ;Miocene * Sheep Creek Formation, Nebraska ;Chapadmalalan * Chapadmalal Formation, Argentina ;Hemphillian * Beecher Island, Colorado * Edson Beds, Kansas * Rancho Viejo Beds, Mexico * Devil's Nest Airstrip, Ogallala Group, Nebraska * McKay and Rattlesnake Formations, Oregon * Miami Quarry, Texas ;Blancan * Gila Conglomerate and St. David Formation, Arizona * Palm Spring and San Diego Formations, California * Tamiami Formation, Florida * Glenns Ferry Formations, Idaho * Ballard, Rexroad and Crooked Creek Formations, Kansas * Rancho Viejo Beds, Mexico * Tequixquiac, Mexico * Panaca Formation, Nevada * Camp Rice Formation, New Mexico * Blanco and Love Formations, Texas * Ringold Formation, Washington ;Plio-Pleistocene * Cocha Verde, Taminango, ColombiaCocha Verde at Fossilworks.org ;Pleistocene * Tarija Formation, Bolivia * Palm Spring and Turlock Lake Formations, California * Bermont and Wicomico Formations, Florida * Yarbrough Cave, Georgia * American Falls Lake Bed E Formation, Idaho * Galena, Illinois (type locality)Galena at Fossilworks.org * Harrodsburg Crevice, Indiana * Turin Pit, Iowa * Kingsdown and Crooked Creek Formations, Kansas * Welch Cave, Kentucky * Cumberland Cave and Bushey Cavern, Maryland * Tacubaya Formation, Mexico * Geddes Lake barrow pit, Michigan * Little Beaver Cave and Zoo Cave, Missouri * Sappa Formation, Nebraska * Dry Cave, New Mexico * Sheriden Cave, Ohio * Holloman Gravel Pit, Oklahoma * Fossil Lake, Oregon * Hanover Quarry and Platygonus vetus type locality, Pennsylvania * Hot Springs Mammoth Site, South Dakota * Laubach Cave, Seymour, Tule and Shuler Formations, Texas * Early's Cave, Gardner's Cave, New Quarry Cave, Vickers Cave, Ruffners Cave, Virginia * Hamilton Cave, Trout Cave, Poorfarm Cave, Patton Cave, West Virginia * Wellsch Valley, Saskatchewan == References == === Bibliography === * * == Further reading == * \u2020Platygonus Category:Miocene even-toed ungulates Category:Pliocene even-toed ungulates Category:Pleistocene even-toed ungulates Category:Miocene first appearances Category:Pleistocene genus extinctions Category:Neogene mammals of North America Category:Pleistocene mammals of North America Category:Irvingtonian Category:Blancan Category:Hemphillian Category:Pleistocene Canada Category:Fossils of Canada Category:Neogene Mexico Category:Pleistocene Mexico Category:Fossils of Mexico Category:Miocene United States Category:Pliocene United States Category:Pleistocene United States Category:Fossils of the United States Category:Pliocene mammals of South America Category:Pleistocene mammals of South America Category:Ensenadan Category:Uquian Category:Chapadmalalan Category:Neogene Argentina Category:Pleistocene Argentina Category:Fossils of Argentina Category:Pleistocene Bolivia Category:Fossils of Bolivia Category:Neogene Colombia Category:Pleistocene Colombia Category:Fossils of Colombia Category:Fossil taxa described in 1848 Category:Ringold Formation Miocene Fauna ",
