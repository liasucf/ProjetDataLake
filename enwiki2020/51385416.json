In November 1941 Koni\u010danin participated in battle against Chetniks who tried to capture Novi Pazar. Together with forces of Mulla Jakup and Biko Dre\u0161ovi\u0107, his forces attacked rear flanks of Chetniks and caused their dismay and retreat. Based on the Had\u017eiahmetovi\u0107s instructions he went to Sjenica to gather additional support in men, arms and ammunition for planned attack on Ra\u0161ka. In December 1941, based on invitation of Hasan Zvizdi\u0107, Koni\u010danin brought a company of Muslims from Tutin to Sjenica to participate in the struggle against Partisans who tried to capture Sjenica. One of Koni\u010danin's important roles was his cooperation with SS Polizei-Selbstschutz- Regiment Sandschak. Koni\u010danin commanded Muslim forces that burned village \u0160avci near Novi Pazar. Koni\u010danin was killed during an attack against Partisans on 23 June 1944. == References == == Sources == * Category:Sand\u017eak Muslim militia Category:1910 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Bosniaks of Serbia Category:Bosnian Muslim collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:People killed by Yugoslav Partisans ",
