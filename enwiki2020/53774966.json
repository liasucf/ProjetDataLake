    "text": "Sirius College (formerly known as I\u015f\u0131k College) is a school network of private schools established by Turkish Australians. Based in Melbourne, Victoria, the school, which has ~2900 students, has campuses in Keysborough, Broadmeadows, Dallas, Sunshine West, and Shepparton. The schools are non-denominational but the students are predominantly Muslim, the schools have amenities that cater towards Islamic customs, and religion is taught as an elective subject. ==History== In 1988, an unregistered non-profit organisation was established for the purpose of education, and later registered and named as Selimiye Foundation Ltd., in 1992. The organisation also had established a boarding house to aid students with their education. They later established their first campus, I\u015f\u0131k College in Broadmeadows and begun operation of the school with 27 students in 1997. The first years of operations for the campus saw an increase of students, with 60 students by the end of the first year and 250 student enrolments by 1998 along with a new campus in Geelong. Two other campuses were later opened in 1999 (Mildura campus) and 2001 (Keysborough campus). The Shepparton (2005), and Sunshine West (2010) campuses were later opened, along with the Mildura campus ceasing regular operations and reforming as a weekend language school and tuition centre. Later, in 2013, the name of the schools was changed from \"I\u015f\u0131k College\" to \"Sirius College\". The school celebrated their 20-year anniversary in 2017. ==References== Category: Private schools in Melbourne ",
