Mikl\u00f3s Faludi (3 February 1870 \u2013 1 February 1942) was the artistic director of the Comedy Theatre of Budapest and the founder of the Hunnia Biograph Company through which he financed and oversaw the development of the first purpose-built film studio in Hungary. == Biography == Tombstone of theatre manager Mikl\u00f3s Faludi (1870-1942) and his wife Marie Combe (1868-1921) at Kerepesi Cemetery in Budapest Mikl\u00f3s Faludi was born Mikl\u00f3s M\u00f3zes Waltersdorf in Devecser, Hungary, on 3 February 1870. His parents were G\u00e1bor Faludi, a successful businessman who founded the famous Comedy Theatre of Budapest in 1896, and Josefin L\u0151vy. After completing his secondary school studies, Mikl\u00f3s worked as a bank clerk in London, England after which he moved to France, where he met his wife Marie Combe. In 1896 he returned to Budapest and became the secretary of the N\u00e9psz\u00ednh\u00e1z (Folk Theatre). In 1901, he joined his father G\u00e1bor and brothers Jen\u0151 and S\u00e1ndor in the management of the Comedy Theatre as the artistic director and dramaturge, a role which he would retain until 1921. Faludi's experiences in Western Europe as a young man, along with his ability to speak English, French, and German, allowed him to translate and stage popular plays from across the continent including David Belasco's Madame Butterfly. In 1911, Faludi founded the Hunnia Biograph Company and personally oversaw the construction of the first film studio in Budapest, located in Pannonia Street. The company produced a number of films until it ceased operations in 1913. In his later years, he worked as an artistic director at the Belv\u00e1rosi Theatre until his retirement in 1939. Faludi died in Budapest on 1 February 1942 and was buried at Kerepesi Cemetery. == References == *Faludi Mikl\u00f3s; mek.oszk.hu] * B\u00e1rdi \u00d6d\u00f6n: A r\u00e9gi V\u00edgsz\u00ednh\u00e1z (Bp., 1957) * Hunyady S\u00e1ndor: A V\u00edgsz\u00ednh\u00e1z 40 \u00e9ve (Bp., 1936) * Szi.
