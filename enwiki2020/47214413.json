The site is located on a hill at the center of the historic region of Sarcidano. The first excavations of the site date back to the mid-nineteenth century and were resumed several times in the nineties of the twentieth century. The entire complex consists of a nuraghe composed by a central tower and a quatrefoil bastion, surrounded by a village. At the site there were found several artifacts such as ceramics and a fragment of a bronze loop of the Schnabelkanne type. ==Gallery== File:Tholos nuraghe Adoni.jpg|Tholos of the lateral tower File:Nuraghe Adoni villaggio.jpg|Ruins of the village ==References== *Sardegna cultura , Villanova Tulo - Complesso di Adoni Category:Buildings and structures in Sardinia Category:Archaeological sites in Sardinia Category:Former populated places in Italy Category:Tourist attractions in Sardinia Category:Nuraghe ",
