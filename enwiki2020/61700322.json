    "text": "\"Treehouse\" is a song by British singer-songwriter James Arthur with American singer Ty Dolla Sign and British rapper Shotty Horroh. It was released as a digital download and for streaming on 6 September 2019, as the fourth single from Arthur's third album You. ==Background== In a statement, James Arthur said: \"Treehouse is a song about surrendering \u2013 going to a safe place, a sanctuary where you can get away from your troubles. The sentiment is 'it's okay not to be okay', just take a load off and go to your happy place. The line 'I don't know why you don't ask for help' could be directed at me, but everyone feels life getting on top of them at times. That\u2019s the message I want to share. It's an inclusive song, not a personal one\". In an interview with the Official Charts Company, Arthur acknowledged that the song was a \"change of pace\" for him, and remarked that \"My hardcore fans know I'm a huge hip-hop fan[,] and that's where my heart is. [...] I've been hard-positioned as this guy who just does ballads \u2013 that's not me at all. I enjoy taking on a lot of styles. It had to be something like this\". ==Music video== A music video to accompany the release of \"Treehouse\" was first released onto YouTube on 6 September 2019. ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseekers (RMNZ) | 22 |- |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
