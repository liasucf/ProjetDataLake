    "text": "Silver Eye is the seventh studio album by English electronic music duo Goldfrapp, released on 31 March 2017 by Mute Records. The album's first single, \"Anymore\", was released to digital music retailers on 23 January 2017 after its premiere on Lauren Laverne's BBC Radio 6 show. ==Background and release== In July 2015, Alison Goldfrapp announced on Twitter that the group had returned to the studio to work on music for the forthcoming seventh album, but was mum as to a release date, stating she could only generalize it to be \"sometime in 2017\". This came after finishing their tour to promote their last album, Tales of Us, and scoring a Royal National Theatre production of Medea. Goldfrapp noted their desire to do something different from previous albums Supernature and Head First, eventually bringing in John Congleton (Blondie, St Vincent, Swans) and The Haxan Cloak to produce on the strength of his work on Bj\u00f6rk's 2015 album Vulnicura. In early December 2016, Goldfrapp posted on their Instagram page the covers of their first six studio albums, and later that month, the band posted an image of two topless figures with bleached blonde hair holding each other's heads with arms slicked with a black, oil- like substance. The social media upload contained the hashtag #goldfrapp7, implying it was a piece born from the album's creative and marketing campaign. The title of the album, Silver Eye, was accidentally leaked with the posting of a pre-order link on the HMV website on 21 January 2017, and was later confirmed in a press release by the band on 23 January. The press release also announced the release of the album's opening track, \"Anymore\", as the album's lead single. Released on 9 February, the official music video for \"Anymore\" was directed by Alison Goldfrapp, produced by Mary Calderwood, and filmed in Fuerteventura. Two further tracks were released ahead of the album. On 9 March 2017, Goldfrapp premiered the album's closing track, \"Ocean\", through Billboard and released to digital music retailers on 10 March. \"Moon in Your Mouth\" was released on 24 March 2017. The music video for the second single \"Systemagic\" premiered on 24 April 2017.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGdMxxpeljU The music video for the third single \"Everything Is Never Enough\" premiered on Nowness on 7 September 2017. On 19 May 2018 it was announced on the band's social media pages that an announcement and video were to be unveiled over the weekend. On May 21, 2018, a remix of \"Ocean\" featuring Dave Gahan was released worldwide, along with the news that it would be the lead single from a deluxe edition of Silver Eye. ==Critical reception== Silver Eye received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 74, based on 21 reviews. ==Commercial performance== Silver Eye debuted at number six on the UK Albums Chart, selling 11,733 copies in its first week. ==Track listing== ===Notes=== * signifies an additional producer * signifies a co- producer ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Silver Eye. ===Goldfrapp=== * Alison Goldfrapp \u2013 vocals, instruments * Will Gregory \u2013 instruments ===Additional musicians=== * Andy Savours \u2013 programming * David Wrench \u2013 additional programming * John Congleton \u2013 additional drum programming * Nick Batt \u2013 additional drum programming * Charlie Jones \u2013 bass guitar * Sebastian Sternberg \u2013 live drum loops * Robert Brian \u2013 drums * Leo Abrahams \u2013 guitar ===Technical personnel=== * Goldfrapp \u2013 production, engineering * The Haxan Cloak \u2013 co-production ; additional production * John Congleton \u2013 co- production ; additional production * Leo Abrahams \u2013 additional production * Andy Savours \u2013 additional production * David Wrench \u2013 mixing * Marta Salogni \u2013 mix engineering * Sebastian Sternberg \u2013 live drum loops recording * Mark Frith \u2013 drum recording * Iain Berryman \u2013 additional engineering * Alessandro Baldessari \u2013 additional engineering * Pete Hutchings \u2013 additional engineering * Marco Migliari \u2013 additional engineering * Ted Jensen \u2013 mastering at Sterling Sound, New York City * Matt Colton \u2013 mastering at Alchemy, London ===Artwork=== * Alison Goldfrapp \u2013 art direction, photography * Mat Maitland \u2013 album design ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseeker Albums (RMNZ) | 3 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2017 albums Category:Albums produced by John Congleton Category:Albums produced by Leo Abrahams Category:Goldfrapp albums Category:Mute Records albums ",
