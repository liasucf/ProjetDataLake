Parts of the site complex were excavated between 1983 and 1996 by a team led by Mark Roberts of University College London. Numerous Acheulean flint tools and remains of animals (some butchered) dating to around 500,000 years ago were found at the site.Fox, Alex, Europe\u2019s Oldest Bone Tools Hint at Early Hominin Sophistication, Smithsonian, August 14, 2020 The area therefore was used by some of the earliest occupants of the British Isles.
