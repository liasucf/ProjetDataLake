Also Ja Rule dissed Proof in a freestyle on \"It's Murda\" by saying \"Y'all haven't heard yet that nigga change is 'Loose' and I got \"Proof\" get it, I got 'Proof'\" and on \"The Wrap\" with \"Nah, I'ma give it to you, The same way that we gave it to 'Proof', The same way that we gave it to 'Loose'\". The track list was printed wrongly on the album, with tracks 8 and 9 being interchanged. == Track listing == ==Reviews== * ==References== Category:Proof (rapper) albums Category:2004 debut albums Category:Albums produced by Mr. Porter ",
