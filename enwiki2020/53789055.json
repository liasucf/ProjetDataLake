    "text": "Fly Creek also known as Vlaie Creek, begins by the border of the Town of Otsego and Town of Springfield in Otsego County, New York. Fly Creek then travels south towards the hamlet of Fly Creek and converges with Oaks Creek south of the hamlet of Fly Creek. The Fly Creek Cider Mill and Orchard is located next to Fly Creek. The Mill gets power to make cider from the Fly Creek water flow and is the last remaining mill in the area. Fly Creek is also located partly within the Fly Creek Historic District. ==History== One theory to the name of the creek goes that as early as 1714 Dutch traders passed through the area traveling to Otsego Lake. The Dutch word for \u201cmarsh\u201d is \u201cvlie\u201d. Fly Creek rises in a marsh to its north, So it\u2019s likely that those Dutchmen named the creek Vlie Creek which became known as Fly Creek today. ==See also== *List of rivers of New York ==References== Category:Rivers of Otsego County, New York Category:Rivers of New York (state) ",
