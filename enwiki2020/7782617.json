    "text": "Two River Theater is a professional, not-for-profit, regional theater company producing plays and educational programs for audiences of central New Jersey, United States, and beyond. It houses two theaters: a 350-seat main stage theater (The Joan and Robert Rechnitz Theater), and a 99-seat black box theater (The Marion Huber Theater). On its main stage, Two River Theater produces a multi-play subscription season and family shows. It is located in Red Bank, New Jersey, on the peninsula between the Navesink and Shrewsbury Rivers that gave the theater its name. The company received \"Theatre of the Year\" awards from the New Jersey Theatre Alliance in 2006, and from The Star- Ledger in both 2006 and 2008. At the July 2009 meeting of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, Two River Theater was designated as a Major Impact Organization. Two River Theater is supported in part by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the New Jersey State Council on the Arts/Dept. of State, a partner agency of the National Endowment for the Arts, and contributions from hundreds of local and national corporations, foundations, businesses and individuals. Two River Theater is a member of LORT (League of Resident Theatres), Theatre Communications Group and the New Jersey Theatre Alliance. ==History== Theater entrance, December 2006Currently under the leadership of Artistic Director John Dias and Managing Director Michael Hurst, Two River Theater develops and produces great American theater created by today's most gifted, adventurous artists. Each year, more than 55,000 patrons and guests come through the doors to see exceptional productions in two intimate performance spaces, the Joan and Robert Rechnitz Theater and the Marion Huber Theater. Audiences come knowing that whether Two River Theater is producing a beloved classic, something brand new, or a rediscovered masterpiece, they are invited on an adventure: to experience great stories on stage, engage in conversation, and encounter the life of the human spirit in all its shifting modes. Two River Theater is recognized in the national theater community for their new-play commissioning program, launched in 2010 to create a pipeline for developing work that contributes to the vitality and future of the American theater. Commissions currently in development include plays by Madeleine George (author of Seven Homeless Mammoths Wander New England), Lisa Kron (writer and performer of 2.5 Minute Ride), Tony Meneses (author of Guadalupe in the Guest Room), Martin Moran (writer and performer of The Tricky Part and All the Rage), and Tanya Saracho, and new musicals by the teams of Joe Iconis and Joe Tracz (Be More Chill), and Daniel Mat\u00e9 and Marshall Pailet. Each season, the theater hosts numerous artist residencies, workshops, and readings to support the development of new work for the American theater, including separate week-long retreats with Clubbed Thumb and NYU's Graduate Musical Theater Writing program. Annual programs include a Cabaret of New Songs for the Musical Theater; Crossing Borders, a five-day festival of new plays by Latino writers and free community events; and Nosotros, a program that fosters a closer relationship between theater and Latino artists and audiences. The theater seeks to cultivate a new generation of theatergoers through innovative arts education programs that introduce young people to the theater and create opportunities for them to engage with renowned theater artists. The \"A Little Shakespeare\" series, launched during Two River's 20th Anniversary Season, showcases an annual production of a Shakespeare play performed by high-school students and includes both public performances and student matinees. Each year, Two River's education programs and student matinees serve students in 50 schools throughout the state of New Jersey. Classroom residencies support academic achievement and, in partnership with schools and community organizations across the central New Jersey region, the theater offers multiple programs that introduce at-risk adolescents to theater. Two River Theater was founded by Joan and Robert Rechnitz in 1994. The theater is easily accessible by car, train, or bus, with restaurants, shopping and hotels within walking distance. ==The building== Stairs inside the theater The Two River Theater new building has a futuristic lobby with -high glass walls with a sweeping roof evoking waves of a river. The building was designed by New York architect Stewart Jones, of Hardy, Holzman, Pfeiffer & Associates, who also designed the Wilma Theater in Philadelphia and the Harvey Theater at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The main Rechnitz Theater seats 350 patrons, and features a modern lighting system. Centered around a thrust stage, the theater was built so as the furthest seats would be no more than from the performers. The facility includes the Marion Huber Theater - a fully convertible, 99-seat black box space, that hosts more experimental works, readings, classes, and rehearsals, and provides an intimate experience for audience members. Two River Theater contains a costume and prop shop, as well as a production warehouse where all sets are made on location. ==Production history== ===2016/2017 season=== Two River Theater's 2016/2017 season featured seven productions. \"These plays dive deep into essential elements of our contemporary lives\u2014love, honor, racism, family conflict, climate change, war, and more,\" said artistic director John Dias in a statement. \"And yet they do so in a joyously human way, painting indelible, moving, hilariously funny, and most of all, deeply honest portraits of people at their best, worst, and everything in between.\" The season began with August Wilson's Ma Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom (Sept. 10\u2013Oct. 9), about singer Ma Rainey and the music scene in 1920s Chicago. The production featured Branden Dirden, and Ruben Santiago-Hudson directed.

Selected students receive two free subscriptions, take workshops in aspects of professional theater, complete assistantships with Two River artists and staff, and work with other creative students from all over New Jersey. PlayBack is a program in which selected high school students work with Two River Teaching Artists who guide them in the creation and performance of their own original play inspired by, in response to, and in conversation with a production on the theater's main stage. This is an intensive twelve-week program, which culminates with performances on the set of that production. Summer Ensembles is a three-week summer program offered to students from first to twelfth grade. Teaching artists channel students\u2019 natural energy and vitality into creative thinking, teamwork, and performance skills through theater games, songs and devising original material. Not only do students get the opportunity to perform for their peers, they are able to see the inner-workings backstage with the Two River production staff. Young Voice's 732 is an educational project to collect stories from those that work, live or play in the 732 area code, and offer those stories back to the community. In June 2010, Young Voices 732 created a play using real dialogue by middle schoolers called Life in the Middle, directed by KJ Sanchez and starring local students. ===Co-productions=== Macbeth (Folger Theatre), 26 Miles (Round House Theatre), A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream (California Shakespeare Theater), Orestes (Folger Theatre), Meredith Willson's The Music Man - In Concert (New Jersey Performing Arts Center) ===Transfers to New York=== In January 2009, Two River Theater produced the world premiere of associate artistic director KJ Sanchez's ReEntry, co-written by Emily Ackerman, which followed with a month-long run at New York's Urban Stages.
