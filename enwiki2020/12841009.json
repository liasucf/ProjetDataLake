It is situated ca. 860 meter above sea-level at the southern flanks of Alaca Da\u011f. Now only one of the walls of the church stands. The church has served a sizeable village that probably was founded in the sixth century. The church itself is a sixth-century basilica which was rebuilt in the ninth century. It is on the Lycian Way long-distance footpath. == References == * * Erik Petersen, Waymarking af The Lycian Way.
