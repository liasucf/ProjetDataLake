    "text": "\"The Lavender Cowboy\" was originally a 1923 humorous poem by Harold Hersey about an unmanly cowboy \"with only two hairs on his chest\" who comes out a hero. It was then set to music and appeared in the 1930 Western film Oklahoma Cyclone. Several versions have since been recorded, and it has been banned from radio airplay because the lyrics are considered suggestive of homosexuality. Lavender Cowboy, The Lavender Cowboy, The Lavender Cowboy, The \"He was only a lavender cowboy And the hairs on his chest were but two He wanted to be a real hero And do as the real heroes do Erbecini's and other hair lotions He would rub on his chest every night But when he awoke in the morning Not a new hair was in sight He fought for Nellie, your honor And he cleaned out a whole robber's nest He died with his six guns a smokin' But with only two hairs on his chest Well they buried him out on the prairie Where the coyotes howl every night And in the place where his bones lay Two cacti have grown into sight.\" Other versions are somewhat less sympathetic to the hapless wrangler. In one, having failed to impress Nellie, he goes on a binge and breaks into the local saloon at night, \"making off with the strawberry gin\". This leads to his demise. \"They shot the lavender cowboy and said as they laid him to rest \"You're better of now boy coz you can't be a cowboy with only two hairs on your chest\"\". ",
