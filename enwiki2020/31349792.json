The highest part of the island is still surrounded by a stone wall from the pre-war period, and features the remains of red brick barracks and a powder magazine. The island is accessible by a ferry. ==Gallery== File:Sarushima from boat 2010.jpg|On the ferry leaving the island File:Sarushima Southern Promentory.jpg|Southern Promentory File:Sarushima Southern Beach.jpg|Southern Beach File:Saru shima01.jpg|From above File:Sarushima fort.JPG|Inside the island File:Sarushima Fortified Pathway.jpg|Fortified Pathway File:Sarushima Abandoned Watchtower.jpg|Abandoned Watchtower File:Sarushima Bunker Tunnel.jpg|Bunker Tunnel File:Sarushima Gun Battery.jpg|Gun Battery File:Sarushima Gun Battery Recess.jpg|Gun Battery Recess File:Sarushima Northwestern Overlook.jpg|Northwestern Overlook File:Sarushima Northern Cove.jpg|Northern Cove ==References== ==External links== * City of Yokosuka sightseeing information * Sarushima: Welcome to Monkey Island CNN Travel article, April 2010 Category:Tourist attractions in Kanagawa Prefecture Category:Islands of Kanagawa Prefecture Category:Nichiren ",
