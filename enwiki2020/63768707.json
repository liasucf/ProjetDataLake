Huntington Park is a park in the Nob Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California. ==Location== Huntington Park is at 1050 Taylor Street and is bordered by California, Taylor, Sacramento, and Cushman streets, in the Nob Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California. ==History== The park is on land donated to the city, in 1915, by the widow of railroad tycoon Collis P. Huntington, whose house had stood on the site until it was destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fire. Some of those made homeless by that catastrophe were for a time housed in tents on the site. ==Facilities== The city-block-size park contains landscaped areas, a playground, and two fountains. At one time, dogs were forbidden, so dog owners would walk them at night. ==See also== * Top of the Mark ==References== Category:Nob Hill, San Francisco Category:Parks in San Francisco Category:Municipal parks in California Category:Urban public parks ",
