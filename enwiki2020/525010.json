Gnomes as magical creatures were first described during the Renaissance period by Swiss alchemist Paracelsus as \"diminutive figures two spans in height who did not like to mix with humans\".

Among the figures depicted were ' (Italian for hunchbacks). In particular, Jacques Callot produced 21 versions of ', which he engraved and printed in 1616. ===Pre-twentieth century=== By the late 1700s, gnome-like statues made of wood or porcelain called \"gnomes\" became popular household decorations.

Within less than 10 years, statues of dwarfs had spread from the provinces of Saxony and Thuringia across Germany to France and, in 1847, Sir Charles Isham, brought 21 terracotta gnomes manufactured in Germany by Philip Griebel back to Britain where they were called \"gnomes\" in English and placed in the gardens of Isham's home, Lamport Hall in Northamptonshire. Nicknamed \"Lampy\", the only gnome of the original batch to survive is on display at Lamport Hall and insured for . The manufacture of gnomes spread across Germany, with numerous other large and small manufacturers coming in and out of the business, each having its own particular style of design.

Garden gnomes spread to other countries in Europe in the 1840s and became particularly popular in France and Britain. The term \"garden gnome\" may originate from the term \"Gnomen-Figuren\" (miniature figurines), used in the original German catalogues. ===Twentieth century=== Garden gnomes were further popularized when Sir Frank Crisp, the owner of the second largest collection of garden gnomes in the UK opened his Friar Park, Henley-on-Thames estate to the public at least once a week from 1910-1919. It was here where garden enthusiasts and visitors from around the world perhaps saw garden gnomes for the first time. The reputation of German gnomes declined after World War I, but they became popular again in the 1930s following Disney's animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, when more working-class people were able to purchase them. Tom Major-Ball (father of former British prime minister John Major) was the most notable producer at that time with his company Major's Garden Ornaments.

Garden gnomes saw a resurgence in popularity again in the 1970s with the creation of more humorous types of gnomes. In the 1990s travelling gnome and garden gnome pranks became popular and made national news at times, where people steal a garden gnome from an unknowing person's lawn and then send the owner photos of the gnome as a practical joke before returning it. ===Twenty-first century=== Philip Griebel's descendants are still producing garden gnomes in Germany. , there were an estimated 25 million garden gnomes in Germany. ==Types of garden gnomes== Garden gnomes are typically male, often bearded, usually wear red phrygian caps and often have pipes. They are often shown pursuing leisurely pastimes such as fishing or napping. Gnomes may be made from terracotta clay slip (runny clay) poured into molds. This is allowed to set up and the excess emptied from the centre, leaving a clay shell. The gnome is removed from the mold when firm, allowed to dry and then fired in a kiln until hard. Once cooled, the gnome is painted. More modern gnomes are made from resins and similar materials. Today, many different variations of garden gnomes exist, including humorous ones ranging from the lighthearted biker or barbecuing gnome, to the more dark, such as one stabbed in the back or wearing an executioner's hood. ==In popular culture and politics== Coolmen garden gnomes Gnomes have become controversial in serious gardening circles in the UK, and were for a time banned from the prestigious Chelsea Flower Show, as the organisers claimed that they detract from the garden designs.
