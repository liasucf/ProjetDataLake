    "text": "Song So-hee (Hangul: \uc1a1\uc18c\ud76c; born October 20, 1997), is a South Korean singer who specializes in traditional Korean music known as gugak. She rose to fame after winning the KBS National Singing Contest in 2008 at the age of 11, earning her a reputation as a gugak prodigy. The South Korean government honored Song with the title, \"Best Korean of the Year,\" in 2010. ==Early life and education== Song was born in Yesan, Chungcheongnam-do, South Korea on October 20, 1997. She is the eldest daughter of Song Geun-yeong (her father), and Yang Bok-rye (her mother). She has one younger sister, Song So-yeong. Song displayed her talent for music at a very young age, which she later attributed to her father's habit of singing minyo, a genre of Korean folk songs, to her. When she was five years old, her parents enrolled her in a gugak academy to develop her singing skills. She studied under gugak singers Park Seok-sun and Lee Ho- yeon, the latter of whom is classified as a \"Living National Treasure\" by the South Korean government. She learned to play traditional Korean percussion instruments under samul nori master Lee Gwang-su. Song attended Deoksan Elementary School, Imseong Middle School, and Hoseo High School, all in Chungcheongnam-do. In 2016, she enrolled in Dankook University's School of Music to study gugak. == Career == Song became famous nationwide after she performed \"Changbu Taryeong\" at the 2008 KBS National Singing Contest. Her performance left a deep impression upon the viewers. She won the grand prize in the contest and became the youngest grand prize winner in the 29 years of the contest's history.

She sang songs such as \"Changbu Taryeong\", \"Taepyongga\", \"Arirang\", \"Batnori\", \"Gunbam Taryeong\", and \"Battuiwara\" on these programs and became more famous. Her appearance on Star King in 2008 led her to another important training opportunity from Master Lee Ho-yoen, who is a specialist in Gyeonggi minyo. Having been impressed by So- hee's talent, Master Lee volunteered to provide training for her on a regular basis. Minyo (Korean folk music) literally means \"song of folklore\" and is the traditional music sung most frequently by Koreans. Minyo is broadly classified into three types according to region: Gyeonggi, Namdo, and Seodo Minyo. Gyeonggi Minyo is traditionally popular in the central area around Seoul. > \"She was born with a gift for singing Minyo. She has high-pitched voice tone > and it's a clear, ringing voice (which is essential for singing minyo). She > also has an extraordinary sense of pitch which enables her to learn new > songs with ease.
