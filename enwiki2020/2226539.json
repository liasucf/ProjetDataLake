    "text": "The British Rail Class 60 is a class of Co-Co heavy freight diesel-electric locomotives built by Brush Traction. They are nicknamed Tugs by rail enthusiasts. ==History== In the 1980s, British Rail determined there was a requirement for a high-powered Type 5 diesel locomotive for use on its Trainload Freight sector. On 10 August 1987, the British Railways Board issued a competitive tender for response by 7 November, for a fleet of 100 locomotives. Of the six companies invited to tender, only three bid responses were received: *Metro-Cammell - offered a Metro-Cammell body with an option of traction packages, many untried, and could not offer performance guarantees as stipulated by the tender *General Electric Company - a partnership with General Motors Electro Motive. They offered a state-of-the-art Class 59, built in the UK, probably at Crewe Works, which had an existing partnership for construction of the Class 91 electric locos *Brush Traction - offered a locomotive powered by either a Mirrlees or Ruston engine, and used separately excited (Sepex) traction control, as previously tested on the Class 58. Of the three bidders, Brush was selected, and an order was placed for 100 locomotives in a deal worth around \u00a3120 million. Brush sub-contracted parts construction, with final construction at Brush's erecting shops at Loughborough. The bodyshells, shared with the Class 92 electric locomotives, were fabricated by Procor (UK) of Wakefield. The engine was a higher-powered development of the Mirrlees engine previously fitted experimentally to Class 37 nos. 37 901-37 904. The first locomotive was delivered in June 1989 and sent to Derby for testing, which revealed a number of teething problems. Parts requiring modifications included the axle box suspension and the Mirlees engine cylinder head. ==Design== ===Bodywork=== Unlike the Classes 59 and 66 (solid girder underframe) the Class 60s have a monocoque stressed skin construction with diagonal trusses - with the external bodywork providing support for the internal components. Two different cab designs were considered and full size mock-ups were made in wood, plastic and metal by the Engineering Development Unit at the Railway Technical Centre in Derby. One of these had a French-style raked-forward cab end, similar to the SNCF Class CC 72000, but this was rejected in favour of a more conventional cab. ===Electrical=== The main alternator is a Brush BA1006A type, providing power for the traction motors via rectification circuits to DC, the auxiliary alternator is Brush BAA 702A Auxiliary Alternator, providing power for the radiator fans, lubrication and fuel oil pumps, traction motor cooling fans and air compressors amongst others. The main and auxiliary alternators are both driven by the main engine. Each of the six axles is driven via a reduction gear by one nose suspended axle hung traction motor (Brush designed and built TM2161A four pole motors). Each motor has a separate microprocessor-controlled power supply (SEPEX in Brush's designation - from \"Separately Excited\"), a system that was first tried on one Class 58, 58050. One feature of this system is that if one set of wheels/axle/motor starts to wheelslip their speed can be reduced without affecting the other motors. ===Prime mover=== The engine is an 8-cylinder, 145 litre Mirrlees Blackstone 8MB275T diesel traction engine (275 mm cylinder diameter); the Mirrlees engine was one of the most fuel efficient available at the time (189g of fuel per kWhr), but relatively heavy. The engine was also successfully installed in marine applications such as small ships and passenger ferries. The low cylinder count for the rated power was expected to result in lower maintenance costs.Sources: * * ;Engine dimensions * Eight cylinders in line * Bore, 275 mm (10.8 inch) * Stroke, 305 mm (12 inch) * Power output, 3,100 hp (2,311 kW) at 1,000 rpm ==Current operators== ===DB Cargo UK=== 60 019 (Westerleigh, 2009) Following the privatisation of British Rail all 100 units came under the management of the English Welsh & Scottish (EWS), It was EWS's policy not to reduce the 100 strong fleet, with both fire and collision damaged locomotives receiving repairs. In 2003/04 a number of the fleet were stored, surplus to requirements.At the same time the Class 47, 56 and 58 fleets were withdrawn and the Class 37 fleet reduced ( see 2000 to present day) Between 2004 and 2007 typically between 50\u201375%During this period the Class 60s saw more work during the winter, and higher numbers available for work - owing to the seasonal demand for fuel oil. of the fleet would be out of action at a given time. In 2007 the operational fleet was estimated to be 60 locomotives. 60 079 (Westerleigh, 2012) In June 2007 EWS was acquired by DB Schenker, a wholly owned subsidiary of the German railway company, Deutsche Bahn. Since working for EWS/DB Schenker, Class 60s have typically been employed on stone, aggregate, ballast and petroleum traffic and also on steel trains. By 2009 many Class 60s were in storage, with only fifteen in operation at any one time. In September 2010 twenty of the class were offered for disposal by DB Schenker UK, whilst in November 2010 DBS announced that 20 units would be overhauled. In January 2011 DB Schenker announced that seven units would undergo an overhaul, with an option of an overhaul on a further fourteen units. In January 2013, the overhaul was described as an \"upgrade\" to create a new fleet of \"Super 60's\". DB Schenker gave no technical details but, according to Tugtracker, there were mechanical upgrades trialled on 60 099 and electrical upgrades trialled on 60 011. Tugtracker also gives a list of eighteen locomotives upgraded between 1 September 2011 and 1 October 2013. Locomotives which had gone through the Super 60 program by September 2013 included (17); 60 007, 010, 015, 017, 019, 020, 024, 039, 040, 054, 059, 062, 063, 074, 079, 091, 092, with another four programmed later that year; 60 001, 044, 066 and 60 100, although its unclear if all of these were completed. https://www.railmagazine.com/trains/current-trains/making-the-class-60s-super- again In 2012 some Class 60s were offered for sale through Romic-Ace International Pte Ltd. In late 2013 DB Schenker Rail UK offered 20 locomotives for sale. These were to be purchased on 31 October 2013 by Doncaster-based Wabtec Rail in a \u00a310m deal - the deal was reported to have fallen through in 2014. In August 2017 DB Cargo UK offered a further 20 locomotives for sale, these being 60 003, 004, 005, 006, 008, 013, 014, 018, 022, 023, 025, 027, 030, 031, 032, 037, 042, 050, 051, and 052. They were sold to Wabtec Rail.Class 60s sold to Wabtec Railways Illustrated 8 August 2017 However again this sale subsequently fell through. In late 2018 DB Cargo UK offered 3 Class 60's (60 004, 014 and 018) for sale, which caused the status of the previous sale of Class 60 locomotives to Wabtec to be uncertain, given all 3 locomotives had thought to have been included in the previous Wabtec sale.DB Cargo to Dispose of 3 Class 60s DB Cargo UK 28 November 2018 On 1 December 2018 DB Cargo UK offered further Class 60s for sale - 60 008, 028, 029, 046, 055, 064, 070 and 098, which was the first time 60 064 had been put up for sale.DB Cargo to Dispose of 8 Class 60s DB Cargo UK 04 December 2018 In 2019 DB Cargo UK offered 60 006, 050, 060, 081 and 086 for sale, stored at Toton.https://uk.dbcargo.com/rail-uk-en/what-we- offer/additional_services/Disposals-1926106 All found buyers with three, initially, sold to metal recyclers (60 006 & 086 sold to Ron Hull, Rotherham, 60 050 to Raxstar) and 60 060 & 081 to 'Private Sales'. Subsequently, 60 086 was resold to a private owner and 60 050 was purchased by the same individual. On 20 January 2020 60 006 was scrapped at Toton and was the first of the class to be scrapped. On 10 February 2020 60 086 was transferred to the Wensleydale Railway and into preservation. This was followed by 60 050. ===GB Railfreight=== In July 2018 GB Railfreight bought all ten of Colas Rail\u2019s Class 60 locomotives, Colas having replaced them with a further seven orders for Class 70 locomotives. ===DCRail=== In March 2019 DCRail acquired four locomotives from DB Cargo; 60 028, 029, 046, 055. These are being overhauled by DB Cargo at Toton TMD with 60 046 the first to enter service in November 2019.DCRail gets first Class 60 - William Wilberforce] The Railway Magazine issue 1425 December 2019 page 105 ==Former operators== ===British Rail=== 60 024 Elizabeth Fry at Eastleigh By 1990, the class had started to be introduced onto the mainline, replacing previously double headed Class 33 Type 3s in the South East region, as well as Classes 20, 26, 27, 31 and 73. The first locos accepted into traffic were 60 017 and 60 018 in October 1990. The class 60s primarily worked on aggregate (specifically stone) traffic also replacing Class 56s and Class 58s, some of which were withdrawn, others transferred. Their introduction replaced double-heading and also allowed longer and/or heavier trains to be worked. ===Colas Rail=== 60 076 (Bristol, 2015) In June 2014 it was reported that 10 locos have been sold to Colas Rail. The numbers are 60 002/021/026/047/056/076/085/087/095/096. The first one to appear in the Colas yellow and orange livery was 60 087, which was photographed at Burton- on-Trent on 2 June 2014. In July 2018 Colas Rail sold all ten of its locomotives to GB Railfreight.https://www.railmagazine.com/news/fleet/gb- railfreight-buys-more-locomotives ==Accidents and incidents== *On 30 June 2015, 60 054 was hauling a tanker train that derailed at , Lincolnshire due to buckled track. *On 26 August 2020, 60 062 Stainless Pioneer was hauling a tanker train that derailed and caught fire at Morlais Junction, near , Glamorgan. ==Naming and liveries== 60 054 named Charles Babbage In 1989 Railfreight named the Class 60s in traditional fashion; those locomotives attached to the construction and metals sectors were named after British mountains as were some attached to the coal sector. The others (coal and petroleum sectors) received the names of famous British citizens, with an emphasis on those whose contribution had been to science and engineering. Locomotives numbered 60 001 and 60 098 were exceptions, being named Steadfast and Charles Francis Brush respectively. The locomotives received the standard liveries of their respective sectors. 60 033 Tees Steel Express in British Steel blue at in 1999 After coming into EWS's ownership, the Class 60 locomotives were repainted in the red and yellow EWS livery as and when repainting was necessary. Many others carried vinyl stickers on their sides over the former BR sector liveries, demonstrating EWS's ownership. A few locos received new names including 60 033: Tees Steel Express, painted in British Steel blue, and 60 081, repainted in a mock Great Western Railway green livery and renamed Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 2000. In 2007/08, two locomotives received special liveries: 60 074 received a 'powder blue' livery and was named Teenage Spirit at the National Railway Museum in York as part of a charity event for the Teenage Cancer Trust. 60 040 was repainted in a red livery and named The Territorial Army Centenary as part of the celebration of that event. Both of these locos have since been repainted into standard DB Schenker livery. In 2010 class 60 number 60 099 was repainted into a Tata Steel silver livery and logo at Toton TMD and unveiled at Tata's Scunthorpe plant on 27 September. In January 2011 60 011 became the first member of the class to receive the standard DB Schenker livery, after a repaint at Toton TMD. In late May 2014 60 087 emerged from Toton TMD in Colas livery. It was joined by 60 002, 021, 026, 047, 056, 076, 085, 095 and 096. In 2019 DCR Cappagh acquired four former DB Cargo Class 60s, from store, which were overhauled and repainted by DB Cargo at Toton TMD. 60 046 and 60 055 were repainted in the DC Rail Freight corporate grey livery. 60 046 regained its original name, William Wilberforce, whilst 60 055 regained its original name, Thomas Barnardo. 60 028 was turned out in a blue livery, with large CAPPAGH logo. On 18 February 2020 the final locomotive of the quartet, 60 029, emerged from a repaint, at Toton TMD, in DC Rail Freight grey and carrying its original name, Ben Nevis. ==Scrapping== On 20th January 2020 work began scrapping locomotive 60 006 at Toton depot, the first Class 60 to be dismantled. ==Fleet summary== Fleet summary 2020. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
