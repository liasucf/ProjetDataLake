It is best known for its Edensoy line of organic soy milk,Dun & Bradstreet report on Eden, via Google Finance and its line of organic Japanese foods and condiments. The company claims to be the oldest independent organic food producer in the United States, and the largest supplier of organic dry grocery items.about Eden Foods Eden was founded in 1969 as a co-op grocery store in Ann Arbor, Michigan to continue the operations of a defunct macrobiotic food buying club. Originally incorporated as a nonprofit, it became a for-profit company in 1970. In 1972, the company began importing Japanese foods such as miso and soy sauce for both the retail and commercial markets. Many of Eden's Japanese foods are still sourced in Japan. Most of Eden Food's products are organic, most are certified kosher, and most are vegan, except for their katsuo (Japanese fish flakes). Many of Eden's prepared foods are also gluten-free, and have therefore been recommended for those on a gluten-free or gluten-free casein-free (GFCF) diet.The GFCF Diet: Side dishes == Products == ===Soy milk=== In 1997, an independent test by The New York Times looking for traces of GMOs in 11 soy and corn-based products found Eden's milk to be the only product that tested clean, a finding that Eden Foods attributed to their extensive certification and testing program.Eden Foods' organic soy milk passes the media test for GMOs - The Organic & Non-GMO Report ===Soy sauce=== In 2001, Eden shoyu soy sauce was rated highest for flavor by Cook's Illustrated in a comparison of 12 brands. In 2007, Eden's tamari was rated best out of seven brands tested in a comparison conducted by the San Francisco Chronicle for its \"Taster's Choice\" column.SFGate.com - \"Top tamari balances sweet and salty\" ===Extra virgin olive oil=== In 1999, Prevention Magazine rated Eden's \"Extra Virgin Spanish Olive Oil\" highest in flavor and protective nutrients out of the 22 brands of extra virgin olive oil studied.Eden Foods press release ===Canned food=== Eden uses BPA-free enamel-lined cans for most of its products (the only exception being tomato-based foods),Eco Childs Play:Canned Food and BPA and was subsequently recommended by the Center for Science in the Public Interest as a safer option for canned food.Report from Center for Science in the Public Interest on BPA In a 2005 study, Eden's canned refried beans were rated best in nutritional value among commercial refried beans by Men's Health Magazine.125 Top Foods for Men ==Controversy== ===Infant formula charges=== In 1988 CEO Michael Potter was charged and later served 30 days in jail on misdemeanor charges for misrepresenting Edensoy soy milk as an infant formula. The suit was brought after a Canadian infant developed a rare eye and bone disorder as a result of vitamin deficiency from being fed the product. The child's physician later reported the patient to have \"completely recovered\". ===Employee healthcare=== In March 2013, Eden Foods filed suit against the Obama administration seeking an exemption from the mandate to cover contraception for its employees under the Affordable Care Act. According to the company's CEO Michael Potter, providing access to any form of contraceptives would violate his beliefs as a Catholic. (This stance against all types of birth control differs from Hobby Lobby's refusal to cover several types of contraception.) Eden Foods lost its suit in both the District Court and the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals (Eden v. Sebelius), and appealed to the Supreme Court. The Burwell v. Hobby Lobby decision by the US Supreme Court on 30 June 2014 overrules the lower courts. The next day, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, Eden Foods v. Burwell.https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/13-591.htm In response, some customers urged a boycott of the company on popular liberal websites, as well as the company's own Facebook page. ==See also== * Organic infant formula * List of vegetarian and vegan companies ==References== ==External links== *Eden Foods - official website Category:Organic farming organizations Category:Food and drink companies established in 1969 Category:Vegetarian companies and establishments of the United States Category:1969 establishments in Michigan Category:Food and drink companies based in Michigan ",
