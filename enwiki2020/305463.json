    "text": "In mathematics, Steinhaus\u2013Moser notation is a notation for expressing certain large numbers. It is an extension (devised by Leo Moser) of Hugo Steinhaus's polygon notationHugo Steinhaus, Mathematical Snapshots, Oxford University Press 19693, , pp. 28-29. == Definitions == :n in a triangle a number in a triangle means . :n in a square a number in a square is equivalent to \"the number inside triangles, which are all nested.\" :n in a pentagon a number in a pentagon is equivalent with \"the number inside squares, which are all nested.\" etc.: written in an ()-sided polygon is equivalent with \"the number inside nested -sided polygons\". In a series of nested polygons, they are associated inward. The number inside two triangles is equivalent to inside one triangle, which is equivalent to raised to the power of . Steinhaus defined only the triangle, the square, and the circle n in a circle, which is equivalent to the pentagon defined above. == Special values == Steinhaus defined: *mega is the number equivalent to 2 in a circle: *megiston is the number equivalent to 10 in a circle: \u2469 Moser's number is the number represented by \"2 in a megagon\". Megagon is here the name of a polygon with \"mega\" sides (not to be confused with the polygon with one million sides). Alternative notations: *use the functions square(x) and triangle(x) *let be the number represented by the number in nested -sided polygons; then the rules are: **M(n,1,3) = n^n **M(n,1,p+1) = M(n,n,p) **M(n,m+1,p) = M(M(n,1,p),m,p) * and **mega = M(2,1,5) **megiston = M(10,1,5) **moser = M(2,1,M(2,1,5)) ==Mega== A mega, \u2461, is already a very large number, since \u2461 = square(square(2)) = square(triangle(triangle(2))) = square(triangle(22)) = square(triangle(4)) = square(44) = square(256) = triangle(triangle(triangle(...triangle(256)...))) [256 triangles] = triangle(triangle(triangle(...triangle(256256)...))) [255 triangles] ~ triangle(triangle(triangle(...triangle(3.2 \u00d7 10616)...))) [254 triangles] = ... Using the other notation: mega = M(2,1,5) = M(256,256,3) With the function f(x)=x^x we have mega = f^{256}(256) = f^{258}(2) where the superscript denotes a functional power, not a numerical power. We have (note the convention that powers are evaluated from right to left): *M(256,2,3) = (256^{\\,\\\\!256})^{256^{256}}=256^{256^{257}} *M(256,3,3) = (256^{\\,\\\\!256^{257}})^{256^{256^{257}}}=256^{256^{257}\\times 256^{256^{257}}}=256^{256^{257+256^{257}}}\u2248256^{\\,\\\\!256^{256^{257}}} Similarly: *M(256,4,3) \u2248 {\\,\\\\!256^{256^{256^{256^{257}}}}} *M(256,5,3) \u2248 {\\,\\\\!256^{256^{256^{256^{256^{257}}}}}} etc. Thus: *mega = M(256,256,3)\\approx(256\\uparrow)^{256}257, where (256\\uparrow)^{256} denotes a functional power of the function f(n)=256^n. Rounding more crudely (replacing the 257 at the end by 256), we get mega \u2248 256\\uparrow\\uparrow 257, using Knuth's up-arrow notation. After the first few steps the value of n^n is each time approximately equal to 256^n. In fact, it is even approximately equal to 10^n (see also approximate arithmetic for very large numbers). Using base 10 powers we get: *M(256,1,3)\\approx 3.23\\times 10^{616} *M(256,2,3)\\approx10^{\\,\\\\!1.99\\times 10^{619}} (\\log _{10} 616 is added to the 616) *M(256,3,3)\\approx10^{\\,\\\\!10^{1.99\\times 10^{619}}} (619 is added to the 1.99\\times 10^{619}, which is negligible; therefore just a 10 is added at the bottom) *M(256,4,3)\\approx10^{\\,\\\\!10^{10^{1.99\\times 10^{619}}}} ... *mega = M(256,256,3)\\approx(10\\uparrow)^{255}1.99\\times 10^{619}, where (10\\uparrow)^{255} denotes a functional power of the function f(n)=10^n. Hence 10\\uparrow\\uparrow 257 < \\text{mega} < 10\\uparrow\\uparrow 258 ==Moser's number== It has been proven that in Conway chained arrow notation, :\\mathrm{moser} < 3\\rightarrow 3\\rightarrow 4\\rightarrow 2, and, in Knuth's up-arrow notation, :\\mathrm{moser} < f^{3}(4) = f(f(f(4))), \\text{ where } f(n) = 3 \\uparrow^n 3. Therefore, Moser's number, although incomprehensibly large, is vanishingly small compared to Graham's number:Proof that G >> M :\\mathrm{moser} \\ll 3\\rightarrow 3\\rightarrow 64\\rightarrow 2 < f^{64}(4) = \\text{Graham's number}. == See also == * Ackermann function == References == ==External links== * Robert Munafo's Large Numbers * Factoid on Big Numbers *Megistron at mathworld.wolfram.com (Steinhaus referred to this number as \"megiston\" with no \"r\".) *Circle notation at mathworld.wolfram.com *Steinhaus- Moser Notation - Pointless Large Number Stuff Category:Mathematical notation Category:Large numbers ",
