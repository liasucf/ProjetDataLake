    "text": "This is a list of the fastest flying birds in the world. A bird's velocity is necessarily variable; a hunting bird will reach much greater speeds while diving to catch prey than when gliding. The bird with the greatest airspeed velocity is the Peregrine falcon, able to exceed 320 km/h (200 mph) in its hunting dives. A close relative of the common swift, the white-throated needletail (Hirundapus caudacutus), is commonly reported as the fastest bird in level flight with a reported top speed of 105km/h (69mph). This record remains unconfirmed as the measurement methods have never been published or verified. The record for fastest confirmed level flight by a bird is 111.5 km/h (69.3 mph) held by the common swift. == Birds by flying speed== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ececec;\" !Common name !Image !Species !Family !data-sort-type=\"number\"|Average horizontal speed !data-sort- type=\"number\"|Maximum horizontal speed !datatype=\"number\"|Maximum airspeed !Flight |- |Peregrine falcon |100px |Falco peregrinus |Falconidae |65\u201390 km/h 40-56 mph |110 km/h 68 mph | |389 km/h 242 mph |High-speed dive\u2014pointed long wings |- |Golden eagle |100px |Aquila chrysaetos |Accipitridae |45\u201351 km/h 28-32 mph |129 km/h 80 mph |241 km/h 150 mph |320 km/h 200 mph | |- |Grey-headed albatross |100px |Thalassarche Chrysostoma |Diomedeidae | |127 km/h Sustained ground speed for approximately nine hours with no rest on high tailwinds during an Antarctic storm. 78.9 mph | | |2.2m (7'2\") wingspan allows for high power use from wind. |- |Gyrfalcon |100px |Falco rusticolus |Falconidae |80\u2013110 km/h 50-68 mph |145 km/h 90 mph |187\u2013209 km/h 116-130 mph |209 km/h 130 mph |High-speed dive\u2014pointed long wings |- |White-throated needletail |100px |Hirundapus caudacutus |Apodidae | |169 km/h The British Broadcast Corporation warns from taking this value too seriously, as the methods employed to measure it have never been published, rendering its verification difficult. 105 mph | |169 km/h 105 mph |High-speed wings |- |Common swift |100px |Apus apus |Apodidae | |111.6 km/h 69.3 mph | |166km/h |High-speed wings |- |Eurasian hobby |100px |Falco subbuteo |FalconidaeHobby, Falco subbuteo | | | |159km/h |Can sometimes outfly the swift as it eats them and catches them on the wing. |- |Frigatebird |100px |Fregata |FregatidaeAnimal Corner ; Sea Birds Frigate Bird Galapagos Sea Birds - The Great Frigate Bird and the Magnificent Frigate Bird | | | |153km/h |Slow gliding/soaring high aspect ratio |- |Spur- winged goose |100px |Plectropterus |AnatidaeFree find Spur-Winged Goose Plectropterus gambensis - Kenya Birds | | | |143km/h |High-speed wings |- |Red-breasted merganser |100px |Mergus serrator |AnatidaeThe cornell lab of Ornithology - Cornell University Bird Guide - Red-breasted Merganser | | | |136km/h |High\u2013aspect ratio wings |- |Canvasback |100px |Aythya valisineria |AnatidaeDucks Unlimited - Wet-lands conversation Canvasback | | | |128km/h |High-speed wings |- |Eider |100px |Somateria mollissima |Anatidae Family XXXIX.
