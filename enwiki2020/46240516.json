The VOOC Flash Charge circuit technology reportedly lowers the temperature of the charging adapter, and creates an interface from the adapter to the phone, which, OPPO claims, improves the speed and safety of the charge. VOOC 2.0 has been licensed to OnePlus as the Dash Charge technology. A single-cell, 30-watt (5 V/6 A) version of VOOC 4.0 has also been licensed to OnePlus as Warp Charge. OnePlus does not market its phones as VOOC-compatible despite the fact that VOOC 2.0 and Dash are compatible. In June 2019 Vivo teased Super FlashCharge technology capable of up to 120W charging. , VOOC has been licensed to 14 other corporations, most of which are in the phone charging and power strip industries. Oppo claims that more than 1000 patents around VOOC have been filed worldwide. == Versions == , VOOC / SuperVOOC comes in five variations: * VOOC 2.0, which operates at 5 V/4 A. * VOOC 3.0 (2019), a technology that claims to be 23.8% faster than VOOC and \"based on a new technology\". It appears to be a 5 V/5 A version of VOOC. VOOC, v3.0: 55 % in 30 minutes. * SuperVOOC (2018), a successor of VOOC 2.0 with 10 V/5 A (50W). It charges a two-cell battery in series. * VOOC 4.0 (2020), a successor of VOOC 3.0, which operates at 5 V/6 A (30 W). VOOC, v4.0: 67 % in 30 minutes. * SuperVOOC 2.0 (2020), a successor of Super VOOC with 10 V/6.5 A (65 W). == Devices == Dash Charge for OnePlus 5 * VOOC 2.0 is supported by OPPO R6 through Oppo R15, by F1 (Find 1) Plus through Find X, Realme 3 Pro, Realme X, and Oppo N3. ** OnePlus devices since OnePlus 3 (3, 3T, 5, 5T, 6, 6T, 7) support Dash Charge, claiming to charge \"a day's power in half an hour\". * VOOC 3.0 is supported by Oppo F11, Oppo Reno series, Realme 5 Pro, Oppo F-15 . * SuperVOOC is supported by the Oppo Find X, OPPO R17 Pro and Realme X2 Pro. * VOOC 4.0 is supported by Realme 6. ** Warp Charge is supported by the OnePlus 6T McLaren, 7 Pro and 7T series and OnePlus 8 series. * SuperVOOC 2.0 (2020) is supported by OPPO Find X2, OPPO Reno 4 Pro. ** New warp charge coming to 8T series All models reported include the \"s\" (or OnePlus \"T\"), \"Plus\", and \"Pro\" variants. Oppo's mobile DAC, Oppo H1-2SE, also features VOOC charging. == Technology == All versions of VOOC require a proprietary cable to work. In addition to electrical requirements like thickness (low electrical resistance) to handle the high currents without overheating, the VOOC 2.0/Dash protocol requires a fifth pin on the (USB-A to USB-C) cable to communicate through. Without such communication, the charger runs at a limit of 5 V/1.5 A. From VOOC 4.0 this limit elevated to 5V/2.0A. On the Android phone end, the VOOC communication code is open source under GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) version 2 as a part of the modified Linux kernel, and has been used by custom ROMs like Lineage OS. The firmware code for PIC16F microcontrollers on the \"VOOC IC\" is also defined in the code. There is some rudimentary documentation provided by OnePlus, which mentions a BQ27541 battery gauge chip made by Texas Instruments, with Dash-specific protocol extensions. The source code allows a list of parts used for the technology to be made: for example, the Find X uses a pic1508/stm8s chip on the adapter and a bq25882 two-cell charger chip on the phone. The BQ27541 gauge is exchanged for a BQ28Z610 gauge which can handle two-cell battery packs. == Marketing == OnePlus has recognised the weakness of many other mobile phones with fast charging technology to significantly slow down the charging speed during operation of the device, using it as an opportunity to promote Dash Charge enabled devices, which do not throttle the input power during operation.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAy6uRtZcwY OnePlus 3T charging speed comparison with Google Pixel XL during commute in car (uploaded January 26th 2017) == Other charging technologies == * USB-PD and PPS * Qualcomm's Quick Charge * Mediatek's Pump Express * Huawei's SuperCharge ==References== Category:Battery charging Category:Chinese inventions ",
