    "text": "\"Concerning the Jews\" is an 1899 short essay by Mark Twain. Twain had lived in Austria during 1896, and opined that the Habsburg empire used Jews as scapegoats to maintain unity in their immensely diverse empire. In 1898 he published the article \"Stirring Times in Austria\". Twain's account generated several letters, and one poignant response in particular from an American Jewish lawyer who asked Twain: \"Tell me, therefore, from your vantage-point of cold view, what in your mind is the cause. Can American Jews do anything to correct it either in America or abroad? Will it ever come to an end? Will a Jew be permitted to live honestly, decently, and peaceably like the rest of mankind? What has become of the golden rule?\"page 2 of the facsimile of the 1934 reprint In response, Twain penned \"Concerning the Jews,\" which Harper\u2019s also published in 1899. The essay included the statement that Jews did not do their part in terms of fighting in America's armed forces: \"He is a frequent and faithful and capable officer in the civil service, but he is charged with an unpatriotic disinclination to stand by the flag as a soldier \u2013 like the Christian Quaker.\" However, when War Department figures revealed that Jewish Americans were actually represented in the nation's military in a larger percentage than their share of the population, Twain issued a retraction and an apology,Tom Tugend, \"Little known museum tells story of Jews in the American military,\" Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), March 17, 2008., from Internet Archive entitled Postscript \u2013 The Jew as Soldier. The essay also included a somewhat positive account of the Jewish people, with regard to their survival: ==See also== *Philo-Semitism ==References== ==External links== *\"Concerning the Jews\", Harper's Magazine, September 1899, pp. 527\u2013535 [facsimile]. *\"Concerning the Jews\" Category:Essays by Mark Twain Category:1899 essays Category:Jewish history-related articles by importance Category:Works originally published in Harper's Magazine Category:Works about Jews and Judaism ",
