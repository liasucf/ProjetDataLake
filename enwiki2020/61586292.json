In 1856 Henry Johnson and lawyer William Allanson purchased the Old Salt Lake land and built a salt evaporation pond to make and sell salt. The site of Old Salt Lake was designated a California Historic Landmark (No.373) on Sept. 6, 1941. On December 15, 1854 Manuel Dominguez sold 215 acres of the Rancho San Pedro for $500 to Los Angeles businessmen Henry Allanson and William Johnson. Johnson and Allanson also built a boiling house with 48 wood fired kettles to make salt faster than the evaporation pond. Johnson and Allanson exported much of the salt produced by transporting it 10 miles overland to the Port of San Pedro. Spanish Missionaries also dug up salt from the lake in the time of Spanish missions in California. The Salt lake was a large pond that was 600 by 1800 feet, it was fed by a natural spring. Johnson and Allanson shut down the salt works in 1862 and sold it to businessman, Frances Mellus. Frances Mellus ran the Pacific Salt Works at the site until 1881. In 1881 Liverpool Salt Works at the Salton Sea, a rival company, purchased Pacific Salt Works and the closed. The lake was 600 feet from the Redondo Beach sea shore at an elevation of about 10 feet.
