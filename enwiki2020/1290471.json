    "text": "George Augustus Sheridan (February 22, 1840 \u2013 October 7, 1896) was an American politician, most notably serving in the House of Representatives from Louisiana for one term (the 43d Congress, 1873\u20131875) ==Biography== Sheridan was born in Millbury, Massachusetts, and moved with his parents to Chicago in 1858. During the Civil War, he served as a Captain in the Union Army until his resignation on October 28, 1864. After the war, Sheridan was one of a group of Northern officials who moved in to administer the defeated Southern states (often derisively referred to by Southerners as \"carpetbaggers\"). In 1866, he moved to New Orleans, Louisiana; there he served as brigadier general of militia on the staff of the Republican Governor, Henry Clay Warmoth. In 1867, Sheridan was made sheriff of Carroll Parish in northeastern Louisiana, which was later divided into East Carroll and West Carroll parishes. Sheridan was elected to the House in 1872 as a Liberal Republican, after running against P. B. S. Pinchback, who was to become noted as the first black governor of a U.S. state. Pinchback contested Sheridan's seat, and the matter wasn't fully settled until February 1875, when the House Committee on Elections decided that Sheridan had won. After his service in the House, he was appointed Recorder of Deeds in the District of Columbia, serving from May 17, 1878, until May 17, 1881, when he retired. Sheridan died at the age of fifty-six in the National Soldiers' Home in Virginia. He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery. ==External links== *Page about Sheridan from the Arlington website *Entry in the Congressional Biographical Dictionary Category:1840 births Category:1896 deaths Category:People from Millbury, Massachusetts Category:Liberal Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives from Louisiana Category:Union Army officers Category:People of Illinois in the American Civil War Category:Politicians from Chicago Category:Politicians from New Orleans Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Category:19th-century American politicians ",
