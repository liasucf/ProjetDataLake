They settled in the neighborhood of Magalh\u00e3es Bastos, Rio de Janeiro, and had 5 children, but 2 died before 1 year of age, the other 3 were Carmelina, Eduardo and Ant\u00f4nio. According to Father Ant\u00f4nio Maria, he says he is \"half Brazilian, half Portuguese\". Antonio and his family lived a humble life, lived with his grandmother Maria and grandfather Manuel, until 1948, when they finished building a home. Antonio studied at Col\u00e9gio Rosa da Fonseca. He was ordained priest on 25 September 1976 and his early years as priest he exerced his missionary activity in Portugal. He spent many years in charge of the Works of Greater Love at Catarina Kentenich Educational Center, based in Jaragu\u00e1, S\u00e3o Paulo, but is now on his way to a new mission after spending a year in a sabbatical period in Mexico. As a priest, who made a vow of poverty and therefore does not have institutions in his name, the Congregation itself took over the whole work of the orphanage, where Father Antonio Maria has three adopted children. Now, the priest lives in Extrema, Minas Gerais, or in Jacare\u00ed, in S\u00e3o Paulo, where the sisters of the new project work on the construction of a convent. \"Of course humanly speaking, I miss it, but God is filling with other works that we are doing,\" he told the Mundo Lus\u00edada. Ant\u00f4nio Maria has since worked at the Filhas de Maria Foundation \u2013 Servas dos Pequeninos, with his mother-house in Minas Gerais, and branches in other states. Despite the changes, the priest continues to count on the friendship and affection of the Portuguese community. ==Discography== * 1982 \u2013 A Esperan\u00e7a Tem Voz * 1984 \u2013 Tempo de Paz * 1993 \u2013 99 * 1994 \u2013 Foi Deus * 1994 \u2013 P\u00e1ssaro Liberto * 1999 \u2013 Festa da F\u00e9 * 2000 \u2013 Mensageiro do Amor * 2001 \u2013 Apenas um Menino * 2002 \u2013 Miss\u00e3o Divina * 2003 \u2013 No Mar De Maria * 2004 \u2013 Com Vida * 2007 \u2013 Benedito Bento do Brasil * 2010 \u2013 Prisioneiro do Amor * 2015 \u2013 Mais Perto * 2015 \u2013 Peregrina Do Evangelhom.som13.com.br ==References== ==External links== * https://www.padreantoniomaria.com.br/ Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian Roman Catholic singers Category:Brazilian Roman Catholic priests Category:Musicians from Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Brazilian people of Portuguese descent ",
