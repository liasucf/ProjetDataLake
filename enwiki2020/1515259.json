The SBP was previously owned by Thomas Crosbie Holdings (TCH). It was then owned by Key Capital, Paul Cooke and staff members (6% equity for staff). It was then owned by Sunrise Media, the shareholders of which include Key Capital. It is now owned by Kilcullen Capital Partners. The paper's first edition appeared on 26 November 1989. While TCH's other major newspaper titles, the Irish Examiner and Evening Echo, are based in Cork, the Post is published in Dublin. The paper describes itself as \"Ireland's Political, Economic and Financial Newspaper\". It is a general newspaper with a strong emphasis on commerce, politics and financial markets. The newspaper does not have a sports section. Three supplements are published weekly with the newspaper: The Market, which concentrates on Irish Stock Exchange and company news; The Magazine, an entertainment and features magazine; and a property supplement. A once-monthly Computers in Business magazine is also included. Ted Harding succeeded Kiberd as editor of the paper in 2001 and edited the paper for three years, resigning in October 2004.Harding resigns at SBP Samantha McCaughren, Irish Independent, Business, 28 October 2004. ==Examinership (2013)== An interim examiner was formally appointed to Post Publications Ltd, publisher of The Sunday Business Post newspaper, on 15 March 2013. The High Court was told that there might be a voluntary redundancy scheme at the newspaper in late 2013 which would target 25 staff positions.
