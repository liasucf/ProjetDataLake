    "text": "The Columbia City Council is the lawmaking body of the city of Columbia, Missouri. It has seven elected members, including the Mayor of Columbia. Each member represents one of the city's six wards, except the mayor who is elected by city-wide vote. Council members are elected for three-year terms. Elections are held annually, as the terms are staggered. In addition to lawmaking, the main duties of the council include hiring a city manager and appointing citizens to boards and commissions; of which there are 57 as of 2019. The council members receive a stipend; however, there has been debate over making members full-time city employees. The council meets in Columbia's City Hall, also known as the Daniel Boone Building. ==Current Council== The most recent municipal election was April 2, 2019. Incumbent Mayor Brian Treece defeated former Missouri State Representative Chris Kelley. Ian Thomas and Karl Skala ran unopposed. The Mayor announced the hiring of Columbia's newest city manager John Glascock on July 15, 2019. Also in 2019, the Associated Press reported that the council \"is backing legislation that would ban gay conversion therapy for minors.\" === Mayor === *Brian Treece === 1st Ward === * Clyde Ruffin * Pat Fowler 2020-2023 === 2nd Ward === * Mike Trapp === 3rd Ward === * Karl Skala === 4th Ward === * Ian Thomas === 5th Ward === * Matt Pitzer === 6th Ward === * Betsy Peters ==History== *Darwin Hindman ==See also== *History of Columbia, Missouri *Board of Aldermen of the City of St. Louis *Kansas City, Missouri City Council ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Map of City Wards Category:Government of Columbia, Missouri Category:Missouri city councils Category:Politics of Columbia, Missouri ",
