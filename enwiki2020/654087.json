    "text": "The ' (; FAI'; ), is the world governing body for air sports, and also stewards definitions regarding human spaceflight. It was founded on 14 October 1905, and is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland.Home. F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale. Maison du Sport International, av. de Rhodanie 54, CH-1005 Lausanne, tel +41 21 345 1070. It maintains world records for aeronautical activities including ballooning, aeromodeling, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones), as well as flights into space. ==History== The FAI was founded at a conference held in Paris 12\u201314 October 1905, which was organised following a resolution passed by the Olympic Congress held in Brussels on 10 June 1905 calling for the creation of an Association \"to regulate the sport of flying, ... the various aviation meetings and advance the science and sport of Aeronautics.\" The conference was attended by representatives from 8 countries: Belgium (Aero Club Royal de Belgique, founded 1901), France (A\u00e9ro-Club de France, 1898), Germany (Deutscher Aero Club e.V.), Great Britain (Royal Aero Club, 1901), Italy (Aero Club d'Italia, 1904), Spain (Real Aero Club de Espa\u00f1a, 1905), Switzerland (Aero-Club der Schweiz, 1900) and the United States (Aero Club of America, 1905). On 2 February 2017 the FAI announced its new strategic partnership with international asset management firm Noosphere Ventures. FAI Secretary General Susanne Sch\u00f6del, FAI President Frits Brink and Noosphere Ventures Managing Partner Max Polyakov signed the agreement, making Noosphere Ventures FAI's Global Technical Partner. ==Activities== The FAI is the international governing body for the following activities: * Aerobatics through the FAI Aerobatics Commission (\"Commission Internationale de Voltige A\u00e9rienne\" \u2013 CIVA) * Aeromodeling and drones through the FAI Aeromodelling Commission (\"Commission Internationale d'A\u00e9ro-Mod\u00e9lisme\" \u2013 CIAM) * Ballooning through the FAI Ballooning Commission (\"Commission Internationale de l'A\u00e9rostation\" \u2013 CIA) * General aviation through the FAI General Aviation Commission (\"General Aviation Commission\" \u2013 GAC) * Gliding through the FAI Gliding Commission (\"International Gliding Commission \u2013 IGC\") * Hang gliding & Paragliding through the FAI Hang Gliding & Paragliding Commission (\"Commission Internationale de Vol Libre \u2013 CIVL) * Human-powered aircraft through the FAI Amateur-Built and Experimental Aircraft Commission (\"Commission Internationale des A\u00e9ronefs de Construction Amateur \u2013 CIACA\") * Microlighting and Paramotoring through the FAI Microlight & Paramotor Commission (\"Commission Internationale de Microaviation \u2013 CIMA) * Skydiving through the FAI Skydiving Commission \u2013 ISC ) * Rotorcraft through the FAI Rotorcraft Commission (\"Commission Internationale de giraviation \u2013 CIG) The FAI establishes the standards for records in the activities. Where these are air sports, the FAI also oversees international competitions at world and continental levels, and also organizes the World Air Games and FAI World Grand Prix. The FAI organises the FAI International Drones Conference and Expo. This event offers a platform for organisations, businesses and individuals to discuss how drones are used today and to create a framework for how they will be used and impact on life in the future. The FAI also keeps records set in human spaceflight, through the FAI Astronautic Records Commission (\"International Astronautic Records Commission \u2013 ICARE) === Karman Line definition === The FAI defines the limit between Earth's atmosphere and outer space, the so-called Karman Line, as the altitude of above Earth's sea level. ==Records== 1971 USSR commemorative stamp depicting Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal established by FAI Among the FAI's responsibilities are the verification of record-breaking flights. For a flight to be registered as a \"World Record,\" it has to comply with the FAI's strict rules, which include a proviso that the record must exceed the previous record by a certain percentage. Since the late 1930s, military aircraft have dominated some classes of record for powered aircraft such as speed, distance, payload, and height, though other classes are regularly claimed by civilians. Some records are claimed by countries as their own, even though their achievements fail to meet FAI standards. These claims are not typically granted the status of official records. For example, Yuri Gagarin earned recognition for the first manned spaceflight, despite failing to meet FAI requirements. The FAI initially did not recognize the achievement because he did not land in his Vostok spacecraft (he ejected from it), but later it recognized that Gagarin was the first human to fly into space. The FAI then established \"The Yuri A. Gagarin Gold Medal\", which has been awarded since 1968. ===Classes=== Record flight diploma issued by the FAI The following types of craft have records: * Class A Free Balloons * Class B Airships * Class C Aeroplanes ** Class CS Solar-Powered Aeroplanes * Class D Gliders & Motorgliders * Class E Rotorcraft * Class F Model Aircraft ** Class F1 \u2013 Free flight ** Class F2 \u2013 Control line ** Class F3 \u2013 Radio control *** F3K - Discus Launch Glider *** F3F - Slope Soaring ** Class F4 \u2013 Scale model aircraft ** Class F5 \u2013 Electrically powered model aircraft ** Class F8 - Autonomous flight (created by CIAM in 2006, later retired) * Class G Parachuting * Class H Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) Aeroplanes * Class I Manpowered aircraft * Class K Spacecraft * Class M Tilt-Wing/Tilt Engine Aircraft * Class N Short Take-off and Landing (STOL) Aeroplanes * Class O Hang Gliding & Paragliding * Class P Aerospacecraft * Class R Microlights and Paramotors * Class S Space Models (Model rockets) * Class U Unmanned aerial vehicle ===Some of the records=== {| class=wikitable style=\"font-size:97%;\" |- ! style=\"width:120px;\"|Date !
