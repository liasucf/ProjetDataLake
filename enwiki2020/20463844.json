The intangibles tax was levied on individuals\u2019 holdings of stock and bonds. The revenue was collected in the county of origin and was distributed to libraries based on need. In 1983, the Ohio General Assembly repealed the intangibles tax and replaced it with the Library and Local Government Support Fund or LLGSF. An amount of the personal income tax equaling 6.3% of Ohio\u2019s personal income tax receipts were earmarked for the LLGSF. This funding was divided using an equalization formula so that underserved areas would receive a guaranteed share. In 1993, the General Assembly passed legislation reducing the LLGSF from 6.3% to 5.7% of personal income tax. It remained at that level until the 2002-2003 biennium budget called for the funding to be frozen at the same level as July 2000 through June 2001. This was the beginning of a funding freeze which lasted through December 2007. Beginning with January 2008 distributions, a new funding source was developed. This fund named the Public Library Fund or PLF is 2.22% of the state\u2019s total general tax revenue.Puskarich Public Library System ==References== ==External links== * Category:Public libraries in Ohio Category:Education in Monroe County, Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Monroe County, Ohio ",
