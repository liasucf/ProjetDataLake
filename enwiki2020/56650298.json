    "text": "Karthik Ramanna is Professor of Business & Public Policy and Director of the Master of Public Policy Program at the University of Oxford\u2019s Blavatnik School of Government. Ramanna's scholarship has explored regulation and decision- making at the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board. He has also written about the costs and benefits of fair value accounting. His 2015 book Political Standards posits that accounting rule-making is an exemplar of a \"thin political market,\" a regulatory setting of economic consequence in which the general public is largely disinterested and where corporate special interests possess relevant tacit knowledge. This situation can result in regulatory capture. Ramanna is a proponent of reforming business ethics education, arguing that corporate managers have unique capabilities and duties to steward the basic institutions of capitalism. Prior to Oxford, Ramanna taught leadership, ethics, and financial reporting at Harvard Business School, where he won the International Case Centre's Outstanding Case-Writer prize, dubbed by the Financial Times as \u201cthe business school Oscars.\u201d ==Publications== *Ramanna, K.
