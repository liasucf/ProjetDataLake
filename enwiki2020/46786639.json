X-Men: First Class co- writers Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz wrote the pilot, but did not get the green light. London then redeveloped the pilot with McNamara and Gamble taking over writing duties, and took the script to Syfy, which ordered a pilot. The pilot, directed by Mike Cahill, was filmed in New Orleans in late 2014 and wrapped in December. Syfy picked up the show for a 13-episode first season, to be aired in 2016. McNamara and Gamble became executive producers. Series production began on August 4, 2015, in Vancouver, and it was announced that Olivia Taylor Dudley had replaced Sosie Bacon as Alice Quinn. It was also announced that Rick Worthy had been cast as Dean Fogg, Anne Dudek as Professor Sunderland, with Esm\u00e9 Bianco also cast. Syfy aired an advance commercial-free screening of the first episode on December 16, 2015, ahead of its January 25, 2016, premiere, when it was shown along with the second episode. The show was renewed for a second season in February 2016, and the second season premiered on January 25, 2017. On April 12, 2017, the series was renewed for a third season of 13 episodes, which premiered on January 10, 2018.

On Metacritic, it has a score of 60 out of 100, based on 24 reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 74% based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 6.47/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \"The Magicians impressive special effects and creative storytelling help compensate for a derivative premise and occasionally sluggish pace.\" Some critics and fans criticized the show for its brutal depiction of Julia being raped and that the rape gave her extra magical powers. The incident was also criticized because, after Julia remembered the assault, she betrayed her friends by forming an alliance with, and literally embracing, a murderer \u2013 who is also a rape survivor. As Lisa Weidenfeld of The A.V. Club put it: \"the show has now suggested that the two victims of sexual assault are its villains\". The second season received positive reviews. On Metacritic, it has a score of 74 out of 100, based on 5 reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 91% based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 8.06/10. The site's consensus reads: \"A clearer sense of purpose and extra helpings of cynicism and danger lead The Magicians to a higher level of engagement.\" The third season also received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 100% approval rating, based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Surprising and wildly entertaining, The Magicians third season has more than enough tricks up its sleeve to keep viewers under its spell.\" The fourth season received positive reviews. On Metacritic, it has a score of 81 out of 100, based on 4 reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 92% approval rating, based on 23 reviews, with an average rating of 9.04/10. The site's consensus reads: \"The Magicians conjures a mind-bending fourth season that reinvigorates the ensemble with heady twists and spellbinding turns \u2013 all leavened by the series' signature glib humor.\" While the season started with a 100% score, reception became more mixed in the second half. The finale was not well received by some fans, who mainly criticized the romanticization of suicidal ideation that was displayed but also the treatment of marginalized groups. The fifth season also received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it has a 100% approval rating, based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 7.87/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Following an uncertain finale, The Magicians recuperates with a fifth season that pushes forward without losing where it came from.\" ===Ratings=== ===Awards and nominations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
