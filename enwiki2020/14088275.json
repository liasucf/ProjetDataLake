    "text": "NEMF logo New England Motor Freight, Inc. was one of the largest less than truckload carriers in the Northeast U.S., based in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The company was founded in 1977. Abbreviated NEMF, it is one of several transportation companies controlled by CEO Myron \"Mike\" Shevell and his family company, Shevell Group. NEMF employed 1,385 drivers and operated 1,446 power units. Mike Shevell and NEMF both have connections to the American Mafia according to an investigation conducted by the federal government. In a racketeering suit filed by the U.S. Attorney in 1988 Shevell was accused of making Mafia payoffs and having an eleven-year corrupt relationship with Tony Provenzano, a Genovese family mobster and former union leader who was convicted of racketeering and murder. The matter was settled with no admission of wrongdoing. On February 11, 2019, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy citing rising overhead costs and a shortage of drivers. ==References== ==External links== *Company Website *The Shevell Group *FMCSA Safety and Fitness Electronic Records *nasstrac.org *UPS Logistics Category:Companies based in Elizabeth, New Jersey Category:Economy of the Northeastern United States Category:Trucking companies of the United States Category:1977 establishments in New Jersey Category:2019 disestablishments in New Jersey Category:Transport companies established in 1977 Category:Transport companies disestablished in 2019 Category:Transportation companies based in New Jersey ",
