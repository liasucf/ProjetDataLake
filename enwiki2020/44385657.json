    "text": "Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 1 (HC-1) was a helicopter squadron of the United States Navy operating several helicopter types in support of United States Pacific Fleet ships and other units. The squadron was established on 1 April 1948 and disestablished on 29 April 1994. It was nicknamed \"Pacific Fleet Angels\" or just \"Angels\". ==History== Early experience with helicopters by the Navy was developed by Helicopter Development Squadron THREE (VX-3) which operated out of Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey. This led to the creation of the service's first two designated helicopter squadrons, Helicopter Utility Squadron (HU-1) and HU-2 on 1 April 1948.http://www.public.navy.mil/airfor/hsc2/Pages/History.aspx As the Navy changed the scope of roles for its utility helicopter squadrons, it also re- designated them Helicopter Combat Support Squadrons. HU-1 was duly re- designated HC-1 on 1 July 1965. A detachment of HC-1 participated in Operation Desert Storm aboard and during its return played a key role assisting civilians in aftermath of the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone. The squadron was disestablished on 29 April 1994. ==Equipment== The squadron has operated several types during its history: * Sikorsky HO3S * Sikorsky HO4S * Piasecki HUP Retriever * Sikorsky UH-34D/E Seahorse * Kaman UH-2A/B/C Seasprite * Boeing-Vertol UH-46 Sea Knight * Sikorsky SH-3G/UH-3H Sea King * Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion ==See also== * History of the United States Navy * List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons ==References== == External links == * 01 01 ",
