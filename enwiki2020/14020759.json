    "text": "An advanced superionic conductor (AdSIC) is fast ion conductor that has a crystal structure close to optimal for fast ion transport (FIT). == History == The term was introduced in a paper by A.L. Despotuli, A.V. Andreeva and B. Rambaby. == Characteristics == The rigid ion sublattice of AdSICs have structure channels where mobile ions of opposite sign migrate. Their ion- transport characteristics display ionic conductivity of ~0.3/\u03a9 cm (RbAg4I5, 300 K) and activation energy of Ei~0.1 eV. This determines the temperature- dependent concentration of mobile ions ni~Ni x eEi/kBT capable to migrate in conduction channels at each moment (Ni~1022/cm3, ni~2x1020/cm3, 300 K). The Rubidium silver iodide\u2013family is a group of AdSIC compounds and solid solutions that are isostructural with the RbAg4I5 alpha modification. Examples of such compounds with mobile Ag+\\- and Cu+-cations include KAg4I5, NH4Ag4I5, K1\u2212xCsxAg4I5, Rb1\u2212xCsxAg4I5, CsAg4Br1\u2212xI2+x, CsAg4ClBr2I2, CsAg4Cl3I2, RbCu4Cl3I2 and KCu4I5. RbAg4I5 AdSIC displays peculiar features of crystal structure and dynamics of mobile ions. Recently, all solid state micrometre- sized supercapacitors based on AdSICs (nanoionic supercapacitors) had been recognized as critical electron component of future sub-voltage and deep-sub- voltage nanoelectronics and related technologies (22 nm technological node of CMOS and beyond). ==References== == External links == * Category:Electricity ",
