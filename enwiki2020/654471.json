    "text": "Tunnel under construction, 2008 Maunabo () is a municipality of Puerto Rico located in the southeastern coast, northeast of Patillas and south of Yabucoa. Maunabo is spread over eight barrios and Maunabo Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas- Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area. The current mayor of the town is Jorge L. M\u00e1rquez P\u00e9rez and the population in 2010 was 12,225. ==History== Maunabo was founded in 1799. Maunabo derives its name from a Taino Indian river name \"Manatuab\u00f3n\". When after the Treaty of Paris (1898), the U.S. conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, the population of Maunabo was 6,221. Maunabo is known for its advances in media. Being almost \"disconnected\" from the rest of the island by its high mountains, the maunabe\u00f1os created their own newspaper called La Esquina \"The Corner\" in English, on August 30, 1975 by Ram\u00f3n \"Chito\" Arroyo and Jos\u00e9 Orlando Rivera. It started as a community one-sheeter distributed free of charge only in Maunabo, but its popularity was so overwhelming that a year later it was transformed into a monthly tabloid. Today, the paper still is free of charge, home delivering 40,000 copies not only in Maunabo but also in the southeastern towns of Guayama, Arroyo, Patillas, Yabucoa and Humacao, and read by more than 190,000 people. Recently, the paper opened its new offices in Maunabo where they also work on La Esquina Online and other projects. ===Hurricane Maria=== Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Maunabo with the significant amount of rainfall. == Geography == Maunabo is surrounded by high mountains on two sides. The three major peaks are Pico Hutton on Sierra Guardarraya with an elevation of ; Cerro Santa Elena also known as El Sombrerito (or the \"hat\" for its unusual shape) on Sierra de Pandura with an elevation of ; and Cerro de la Pandura with an elevation of . The wind on these high points is so strong that it is hard to hear anything else but it blowing past your ears. At Sierra Guardarraya the strong winds have affected the growth of vegetation and the tall grass only grows flat to the ground. In the lush and tropical vegetation of Cerro de la Pandura you will find one of the Island's most endangered species of coqu\u00ed, the little frogs that sing like birds at night and which are endemic to the Island (though just recently a new species have flourished in the islands of Hawaii where they are considered a pest and are being exterminated by the local government). Known as the coqu\u00ed Guaj\u00f3n (Eleutherodactylus cooki), this coqu\u00ed can be found in the mountains shared by the neighboring towns of Yabucoa, Patillas and San Lorenzo. Though discovered in 1932 by Chapman Grant of the U.S. Army, it was not until 1997 that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declared it an endangered species. ===Barrios=== Subdivisions of Maunabo. Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Maunabo is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as . # Calzada # Emajagua # Lizas # Matuyas Alto # Matuyas Bajo # Maunabo barrio-pueblo # Palo Seco # Quebrada Arenas # Talante # Tumbao ===Sectors=== Barrios (which are like minor civil divisions) and subbarrios, in turn, are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanizaci\u00f3n to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others. ===Special Communities=== Of the 742 places on the list of , the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Maunabo: Matuyas, Sector Garc\u00eda in Talante, and Batey Columbia in Calzada. ==Demographics== ==Tourism== Mauna Caribe, a which is a local type of bed and breakfast, tropical inn, is located in Maunabo. With an almost unspoiled culture\u2014due to the high mountains that separate the town from the rest\u2014Maunabo still is a very colonial city and the lack of large commercial chains gives it a unique personality compared to the rest of the island. The warm, unspoiled and untamed blue and green waters of the beaches of Maunabo are one of its major attractions. The three beaches (Los Bohios, Los Pinos and Playa Punta Tuna) are mostly visited by the locals all year round. The beaches also attract tourists that explore other regions beyond San Juan and other major cities. Surfers love these wild and dangerous waters. The Punta Tuna beach is also known by the locals as Playa Escondida or the \"hidden beach\", crowned by the Punta Tuna Lighthouse on one side and separated from the main road by lush sea grape trees on the other. The beach is only accessible by foot through a short dusty road. The sand at Los Pinos beach (the name means \"the pines\" and it comes from a pine-tree-lined hill on the side of the beach) shines with black carbon minerals and legend has it that these come from sea volcanoes or from underwater fossil fuel deposits. The minerals tend to stick to anything that is wet and thus it is rarely visited. The Los Bohios beach is a popular beach in town, attracting thousands of visitors each year. The town is also known for its Punta Tuna Lighthouse built by the Spanish at the end of the 19th century before the Island was turned over to the United States as spoils of the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898. Though it has never ceased working under the active management of the U.S. Coast Guard, for almost 30 years the lighthouse was not accessible to the public. Due to Law 180 presented by Governor An\u00edbal Acevedo Vil\u00e1, the doors of the lighthouse were opened once again to the public in February 2006. The lighthouse is also a permanent symbol in the town's coat of arms. The town is also known for its annual crab carnival \"Festi-Carnaval Jueyero\" which attracts thousands of visitors for a three-day celebration with live music, street fairs, contests and much crab-based food. The carnival is celebrated during the first week of September, at the peak of the summer heat. ===Landmarks and places of interest=== Faro Punto de Tuna * Cantera Caverns * Punta Tuna Light - built by the Spaniards in 1892 is located on Punta Tuna. * Punta Tuna Beach ==Culture== ===Festivals and events=== Maunabo celebrates its patron saint festival in May.

A Chilean construction company is in charge of the contract. The tunnels have been named Vicente Morales Lebr\u00f3n, after an environmental activist who, as a result of the 1956 tropical storm Betsy that damaged the only road that connected the town with the north side of the island, proposed the tunnels to be built. In September 2018, the tunnel was closed briefly for the filming of a music video. There are 22 bridges in Maunabo. ==Gallery== A beach in Maunabo, Puerto Rico.jpg|A beach in Maunabo ==See also== * List of Puerto Ricans * History of Puerto Rico * Did you know-Puerto Rico? ==References== ==External links== * Puerto Rico Government Directory - Maunabo Category:Municipalities of Puerto Rico Category:Populated places established in 1799 Category:San Juan\u2013Caguas\u2013Guaynabo metropolitan area Category:1799 establishments in the Spanish Empire Category:1799 establishments in North America ",
