    "text": "Lateysha Naomi Henry (born 25 November 1992), known professionally as Lateysha Grace, is a Welsh television personality, businesswoman and model. She began her television career after appearing on the MTV reality series The Valleys (2012\u20132014), and has since made further television appearances in the seventeenth series of Big Brother (2016), Million Dollar Baby (2018), and Celebrity Ex on the Beach (2020). == Career == ===Television appearances=== Grace began her reality television career on MTV series The Valleys in 2012, at the age of nineteen. She is known for quotes she says on the show such as \"tamping\", \"fuming\", \"raging\", and also came up with \"Valleywood\", which she then went on to get tattooed. On 7 June 2016, Grace entered the Big Brother house, to participate in the seventeenth series. She was never nominated for eviction, but was eliminated as part of an \"Annihilation Week\" twist on 12 July 2016, when contestant Jason Burrill was required to evict a fellow housemate. In 2018, Grace starred in Million Dollar Baby, an MTV series that documented herself, business partners and friends trying to raise \u00a31 million for her daughter, Wynter. ===Music=== In April 2014, Grace released her first single, \"You Beautiful\", featuring D-Jukes, though it failed to chart. The single was a plotline in the third series of The Valleys, where her fellow housemates were underwhelmed with the finished track. In her autobiography, Grace noted: \"I think a huge part of it all was jealousy. It could have been a classic hit but they still wouldn't have admitted they liked it because none of the other housemates had anything substantial going on in their lives.\" === Other ventures === Grace has featured in many men's magazines including Nuts. In 2014, she appeared nude in a photoshoot for Zoo, following a breast enlargement and nipple reduction. In 2013, she began selling an online fashion range. In 2015, she released her autobiography, titled Valleywood. In 2018, Grace began a children's clothing business, named Baby on Trend. ==Personal life== Before The Valleys, Grace worked as an accounts administrator, a hairdresser, and in a fish and chip shop. She has a daughter, Wynter, with ex- boyfriend Ben Charles. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 births Category:Big Brother (British TV series) contestants Category:Living people Category:People from Port Talbot Category:Welsh female models Category:Welsh television personalities Category:Welsh women in business ",
