Following the film's success, Devgn and Shetty collaborated on three follow-ups to the film - the first of these, Singham Returns, which marked Shetty's production debut and was produced by Devgn, reunited the duo with Kareena Kapoor Khan who replaced Aggarwal as the female lead, and was a direct continuation to Singham, set in Mumbai, with the basic plot inspired by the 1993 Malayalam film Ekalavyan; the second, Simmba, lifted from the 2015 Telugu film Temper and starring Ranveer Singh as the titular anti-heroic orphaned cop with roots in Shivgarh, alongside Sara Ali Khan and Sonu Sood, was the first spin-off and the first expansion to officially create a Cop Universe, with Karan Johar joining Shetty as a producer on the film; the third entry, Sooryavanshi, a second follow-up starring Akshay Kumar as the titular anti-terrorist squad chief, Singham's friend, was slated to release in March 2020, but was postponed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic lockdown announced by the Indian government. All three films were co-produced and distributed by Reliance Entertainment. == Plot == Rakesh Kadam (Sudhanshu Pandey) is an honest police officer who ends up committing suicide due to the false accusations of corruption levelled against him by Jaikant Shikre (Prakash Raj), a don and politician in Goa running various rackets like kidnapping, extortion and smuggling. Kadam's wife Megha (Sonali Kulkarni) vows revenge against Jaikant in front of him, exclaiming that God will dispense justice to him for this act. The story moves to Shivgarh, a small village near the Goa-Maharashtra border. Bajirao Singham (Ajay Devgn), an honest police officer like Kadam, is in charge of the Shivgarh police station. A station house officer in charge of his own town, he resolves most of the problems in his town informally and without filing charge sheets, thereby gaining much reputation and love from the villagers. Gautam \"Gotya\" Bhosle (Sachin Khedekar) is an industrialist and a friend of Singham's father Manikrao \"Manya\" Singham (Govind Namdeo). He comes to Shivgarh with his wife and daughter Kavya (Kajal Aggarwal). Eventually, Singham and Kavya fall in love with each other. Their courtship takes place through a series of comic events where she initially hates him after he slaps her tight when she is caught frightening villagers disguising as a ghost, but then has a change of heart when she sees his honest and simple nature and finds that he wants to apologize for his behaviour. Everything seems to run smoothly until Jaikant, who is given a conditional bail for a murder he had committed, is required to travel to Shivgarh to sign the bail every fortnight. He, instead, sends one of his allies to do the formalities, much to the fury of Singham who demands Jaikant sign the bail in person. Humiliated, Jaikant reaches Shivgarh but is unable to take any revenge on Singham fearing the wrath of the villagers, who threaten to finish him off. Using his political contacts, he gets Singham transferred to Goa to take revenge. Singham, unaware of Jaikant's hand behind his transfer, joins the Colva police station in Goa as an inspector. His co- workers, Sub-Inspector Dev Phadnis (Vineet Sharma), Sub-Inspector Abbas Malik (Ankur Nayyar), and Head Constable Prabhu Savalkar (Ashok Saraf), hate Jaikant for his crimes but are unable to take any action because of Jaikant's political powers. DSP Satyam Patkar (Murli Sharma), Singham's senior, is on Jaikant's payroll and takes care in concealing and eliminating the evidence of Jaikant's crime from the eyes of the law. Singham, upon learning of Kadam's tragedy from the colleagues and Megha, and taking cues from what he has already seen, tries to take this to the notice of DGP Vikram Pawar (Pradeep Velankar) but it turns out to be of no use as there is no evidence against Jaikant and Patkar. Local minister Narvekar (Anant Jog) soon adds to Singham's troubles when he refuses to support him against Jaikant, later launching the latter as a candidate from his local political party. Feeling defeated and mentally tortured by Jaikant to no limits, a worried Singham wants to return to his hometown, but is stopped by Kavya, who encourages him to fight against the evil and not run away like a coward. At that point, some of Jaikant's men attack him, and he, realizing the futility of returning to Shivgarh, brutally beats the goons black and blue. Singham then arrests Jaikant's top lieutenant Shiva Nayak (Ashok Samarth) in a fake case of illegally smuggling alcohol after setting him up to tear the FIR against the goons, who he had come to free, and realizing that Shiva, under Jaikant's orders, had planted bundles of cash in Kadam's jeep. Later, he thwarts off Patkar in full view of the public when Patkar, bounded by his duties to Jaikant, tries to bail Shiva out. Jaikant kidnaps Kavya's younger sister Anjali (Sana Amin Sheikh) for ransom on Kavya's birthday. Rescuing her, Singham successfully traces the origins of the kidnapping racket to Jaikant, confronting Narvekar with his team in anger, but is unable to arrest him as he wins the election and is set to become a minister of the Goa Government. Jaikant sends transfer orders to Singham to go back to Shivgarh within 24 hours. That night at a police function organized for the officers with their family, Singham confronts the officers, particularly Pawar and Patkar, for not abiding by their duties and being dishonest and unfaithful to their profession by protecting Jaikant. At first, Patkar berates Singham, but filled with guilt, Phadnis, Abbas and Savalkar decide to help Singham fight Jaikant. Soon, he is joined by the entire Goa Police Force, with Pawar also extending support, and all of them invade Jaikant's home to kill him, with Patkar revealing himself to be in support of Singham in a twist. Jaikant eventually escapes but after running through the city, he is arrested by the police the next morning. They bring him to the police station and shoot him dead on Kadam's chair, threatening Shiva moments after the shot to change his statement. At a media conference, while proving Jaikant and Narvekar guilty, Pawar and Singham clear the late Kadam of all corruption charges. The film ends with Singham and the other police officers saluting Megha. == Cast == * Ajay Devgn as Inspector Bajirao Singham, a police officer with unparalleled strength and wit of mind, one would say close to godliness.

The film's DVD was released on 23 August 2011. The Delhi High Court, upon Reliance Entertainment's request, issued an order to all Indian ISPs to block file sharing sites to prevent unauthorized sharing of Singham. == Reception == === Critical reception === Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave it four out of five stars and stated \"Singham is over-the-top retro kitsch, spilling over with high-voltage stunts, slow-motion action cuts and fiery dialogues delivered in high decibels. It is meant for all those action buffs interested in time travel to the angry young 1970s and 1980s when cinema was larger-than- life and totally unrealistic. But then, retro is currently chic, isn't it?\" Komal Nahta of Koimoi gave it four and a half stars out of five stars and said \"On the whole, Singham is a powerful action-emotional drama which boasts of equally powerful dialogues and absolutely power-packed performances. It\u2019s a super-hit and will be loved by the masses and the classes, the men and the women, the young and the old, the rich and the poor. It is the kind of film which consumes the viewer and gives him the feeling that he was part of the fight against corruption! The film has immense repeat-value. Its business in Maharashtra will get a further boost because of the liberal use of Marathi in the dialogues. Kaajal Aggarwal acts with effortless ease. Her performance is good.\" Suparna Sharma of The Asian Age gave it two out of five stars and stated \"Singham is a primitive, archetypal genre piece, and it is a hit. Rohit Shetty taps into the sentiment of the moment \u2013 emasculation, frustration \u2013 and gratifies it. But endowing a cop with nobility doesn\u2019t ring true, especially not when he is neither Chulbul-charming nor when the target of his anger and lashing is generic sleaze\u2026 Singham is vigilante cop let loose on all things foul. I felt fluctuating connect with Singham, but mostly he made me queasy.\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the four and a half stars out of five and said \"Singham pays homage to the action films of the 1970s, which was known for the heroism, death-defying action sequences and pulse-pounding thrills. It's an acknowledgement to one of the most successful genres of Bollywood \u2013 action movies \u2013 known for the trademark good versus evil themes and well choreographed stunts.\" Saibal Chatterjee from NDTV also gave four out of five stars and said \"Singham is an old-fashioned but rousing Hindi commercial film that pretty much restores one\u2019s faith in this often-maligned brand of cinema. It has super-duper hit written all over it. No matter how dismissive you might be of films that have no space for shades of grey, chances are that Singham will disarm you, if only for a bit.\" Dailybhaskar gave a score of three stars out of five and said \"The action takes over the romance in the film. Go for it, if you want to catch one hell of an action flick! \"Movie review: Singham. Daily.bhaskar.com. Retrieved on 21 February 2017. Sukanya Venkatraghavan from Filmfare gave two stars out of five and said \"Singham is a film that will invoke wolf whistles and applause from its audience. It is gloriously massy. The movie knows its job and does it well. It does nothing out of the box to grab your attention and yet it does. Pretty easily. Watch it for its robust potboiler personality. With extra masala as garnish. Ajay Devgan pulls out all stops for this one. He is fierce and impactful. This is his show all the way. His quirky forte for comedy too comes forth in the ubiquitous ha ha sequences with leading lady Kajal Aggarwal who looks pretty and has done what she has been told to, but probably deserved a meatier debut.\" Kaveree Bamzai from India Today gave three out of five stars and deemed that \"Mr Devgn tries hard, growling like a Singham, and acting like a superman, but I was more interested in Prakash Raj's two tone Al Capone shoes.\" Raja Sen from Rediff gave one and a half stars out of five and said \"All I can personally say about this trend of remaking one-note Southern hits as a viewer is that it's an exhausting one. It is in the tiny victories that we must seek refuge after a film like this: I'm just glad the hero, so eager to peel off his uniform, left his pants on.\" Sudhish Kamath from The Hindu said \"The original wasn't the best film around but it had a few smarts, pace and fury, and worked despite its cheesy visual effects purely because of Suriya who made the corniest lines sound good. Devgn does exactly the opposite. He takes some half-decent lines (by Farhad and Sajid) and makes them sound cheesy.\" Shubha Shetty Saha from MiD DAY gave the film a score of two stars and deemed that \"Nothing turns director Rohit Shetty on more than cars meeting mid air. We all know that by now. And this film has some breath taking action sequences, too. That's about it is.\" Meenakshi Rao from The Pioneer describes the film as \"the David Dhawan of action, or for that matter the Golmaal of fights. To keep the audience engaged all through such unending babble needs some kind of acumen which normal people do not always have and through which people like Rohit Shetty get to make a whole lot of money, if not sense.\" giving it seven out of ten stars. Kunal Guha from Yahoo! Movies gave two stars and says that \"The film's assumption that mispronunciation is funny makes us endure words like honest (with a loud 'h'), clean cheet (clean chit), noun-saans (nonsense) and sooocide (suicide). The dialogues are spouted with immense enthusiasm but the words defuse the intensity and make them seem trivial. Devgn does a fair job and conveys sufficient conviction and humility through his character. Kajal Aggarwal makes an unobjectionable debut and her eyes would surely inspire a few compliments.\" === Box office === Singham started extremely well at single screens with occupancy around 90% and was average at multiplexes with 50%\u201360% occupancy, In the first four days, the film collected .

Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama awarded the album two stars out of five and said \"Singham turns out to be a fine album though one does feel that there could have been much more than just three songs here. While 'Saathiyaa' is the pick of the lot and has the potential to play on beyond the theatrical run of the film as well, title song \"Singham\" brings in the right mood despite its setting. However given the fact that the film is not quite a musical and the focus would be primarily on pushing its action flavour, the album would find it tough to make much of a mark commercially.\" Tanuj Manchanda of Planet Bollywood gave the album five and a half stars citing that \"Ajay-Atul produces a satisfactory soundtrack, after their first attempt in Virudh and shows their versatility in a short span of 3 songs. One looks forward to their forthcoming venture My Friend Pinto which will be their second Bollywood film as composers. Overall, the songs are decent and have the ability in them to become a success. It will help in enhancing the film's narrative.\" == Accolades == {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Award Ceremony ! Category ! Recipient ! Result !
