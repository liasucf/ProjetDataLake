Lesabe maintained her activism despite the banning of the party and later became part of the People's Caretaker Council (PCC) in which she was elected to the National Council. PCC (which was a vehicle for ZAPU evading a ban) was itself banned in 1964. Between 1970 and 1974 she went around the country drumming up support for ZAPU. At a Congress of the ANC in 1975 she was elected to the National Executive as head of ZAWU while Josiah Chinamano was elected the vice president and Joseph Msika was made the Secretary General.
