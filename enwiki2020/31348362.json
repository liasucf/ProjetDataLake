From 1994 to 1996, Schweinitz was a professor of composition at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik \"Franz Liszt\", Weimar. In 2007 he succeeded composer James Tenney at the California Institute of the Arts. == Music == Since 1997, Schweinitz has been concerned with \"[r]esearching and establishing new microtonal tuning and ensemble playing techniques based on non-tempered just intonation\" in his compositions. Schweinitz's music is often characterized by its freely expressive counterpoint exploring the distinctive melodic and harmonic networks of just intonation within a rigorously structured formal logic. Between 2000 and 2004, Schweinitz together with Canadian composer Marc Sabat developed a staff notation for just intonation called the Extended Helmholtz-Ellis JI Pitch Notation. ==Awards== *1986 Schneider-Schott Music Prize *1992 Hindemith Prize of the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival ==Recordings== * Variationen \u00fcber ein Thema von Mozart, Harmonia Mundi Deutschland * Mass for soloists, choir and orchestra op. 21, WERGO ==References== == External links == * Wolfgang von Schweinitz, at CalArts * * List of works, at Plainsound Music Edition Category:German opera composers Category:Male opera composers Category:German classical composers Category:20th-century classical composers Category:21st-century classical composers Category:1953 births Category:Musicians from Hamburg Category:Living people Category:German male classical composers Category:20th-century German composers Category:21st-century German composers Category:20th-century German male musicians Category:21st-century German male musicians ",
