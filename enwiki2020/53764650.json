    "text": "Munster Reds is an Irish inter-provincial cricket team based in Munster. In April 2017, Cricket Ireland approved the participation of the team in the Interprovincial Twenty20 Cup, the highest level of T20 domestic cricket in Ireland. They joined Leinster Lightning, North West Warriors and Northern Knights in the 2017 tournament. They played their first match in the Inter- Provincial Trophy on 26 May 2017, and won their first match, against North West Warriors, on 6 July 2018. Following the successful end to their 2018 season, there was talk of Munster Reds being included in the Interprovincial One-Day Trophy competition, but while this is an objective of Cricket Ireland, it was confirmed this would not happen in 2019. ==Current squad== * denotes players with international caps. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; width:80%;\" |- !
