The pair have been married for 10 years after Stephen migrated to Australia following World War II. They return to a Berlin still struggling with damage caused in the war, and to a wealthy family still hiding secrets about their war-time involvement. ==Reviews== A reviewer in The Canberra Times was not impressed with the novel: \"Dymphna Cusack's new documentary novel, Heatwave in Berlin, has the pace, the excitement and something of the basic hollowness of a thriller...What it makes as a novel, however, is something which cannot be taken very seriously. The characters have the larger-than-life quality of figures in a melodrama, and they speak with something of the same staginess.\"\"Theme that lacks conviction\", The Canberra Times, 13 May 1961, p14 == See also == * 1961 in Australian literature ==References== Category:1961 Australian novels Category:Novels by Dymphna Cusack ",
