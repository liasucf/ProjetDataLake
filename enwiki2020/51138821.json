    "text": "Pajsije II (, ) was Archbishop of Pe\u0107 and Serbian Patriarch for a short time during 1758. He was an ethnic Greek. Before he became Serbian Patriarch, he was Metropolitan of U\u017eice and Valjevo, under Vikentije I. In 1758, when patriarch Vikentije went to Constantinople, metropolitan Pajsije traveled with him. While staying in Constantinople, Serbian Patriarch was struck with sudden illness and died. Metropolitan Pajsije took the opportunity and succeeded in becoming new Serbian Patriarch as \"Pajsije II\". His tenure was very short since in that time Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 was in constant internal turmoil. His main rival was another Greek, metropolitan Gavrilo, who succeeded in overthrowing Pajsije II and becoming new Serbian Patriarch as Gavrilo IV. == References == ==Sources== * * * * * * ==External links== * Official site of the Serbian Orthodox Church: Serbian Archbishops and Patriarchs Pajsije II Category:18th-century Greek people Category:Greeks of the Ottoman Empire ",
