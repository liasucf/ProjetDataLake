The Fury, a Pacific Division team in the Major Arena Soccer League, played their home games in the Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, California. The team was led by general manager and head coach Bernie Lilavois plus assistant coach Joe Pollard. The Ladies of Fury dance team was directed by Lynae de Leon. Ontario finished the 2014\u201315 season with a 13\u20137 record, second best in the Pacific Division, but lost their first-round playoff game to the Las Vegas Legends. ==Season summary== The Fury struggled early in the season, losing 3 of their first 4 games. A road win over the Rochester Lancers began a 5-game in streak stopped by an overtime loss to the Turlock Express. 2014 ended with a win over the Sacramento Surge and 2015 began with a loss to the Las Vegas Legends. A home win over the Harrisburg Heat was the first of 6 consecutive wins that followed. A pair of losses to the San Diego Sockers at home and on the road left Ontario with a 13\u20137 record and 2nd place in the Pacific Division. The Fury qualified for the post-season but fell 5\u20136 to Las Vegas in the Pacific Division Semi-Final. ==History== The Fury entered the 2013\u201314 season as an expansion team in the Professional Arena Soccer League. They got off to a promising start with home wins over the Dallas Sidekicks and Sacramento Surge, but dropped six straight matches then struggled to find their way. With their only road win coming at fellow expansion team Bay Area Rosal, the Fury finished the season with a 5\u201311 record and missed the playoffs. ==Off-field moves== The team established a non-profit organization named the Fury Foundation to promote healthy living to young people. Activities include school assemblies, soccer camps, and an educational program called \"Health's A Kick\". In May 2014, the Professional Arena Soccer League added six teams from the failed third incarnation of the Major Indoor Soccer League and reorganized as the Major Arena Soccer League. With the league expansion and reorganization, the other Pacific teams for 2014\u201315 are California-based Sacramento Surge, San Diego Sockers, and Turlock Express plus the Las Vegas Legends and the expansion Seattle Impact. The Impact's assets were purchased mid-season and the team replaced on the schedule by the Tacoma Stars. In September 2014, the Fury purchased the Tijuana-based Toros Mexico and designated the franchise as their official developmental team in the Premier Arena Soccer League. Former Toros Mexico owner Joe Pollard will serve as an assistant coach for the Fury as well as running the developmental team. ==Schedule== ===Pre-season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"110\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"210\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"160\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"250\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"100\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 1 | Friday | October 12 | 7:05pm | at Las Vegas Knights | W 8\u20137 | 1\u20130 | Orleans Arena | 2,275 |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 2 | Friday | October 19 | 7:05pm | Mexican National Indoor Team | L 8\u201314 | 1\u20131 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 4,200 |} ===Regular season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"110\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"190\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"250\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"130\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 1 | Friday | November 7 | 7:05pm | Monterrey Flash | L 5\u20137 | 0\u20131 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 2,219 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 2 | Sunday | November 9 | 3:05pm | Sacramento Surge | W 12\u20137 | 1\u20131 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 1,738 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 3 | Sunday | November 16 | 5:05pm | at San Diego Sockers | L 2\u20137 | 1\u20132 | Valley View Casino Center | 2,913 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 4 | Friday | November 21 | 7:30pm | at Syracuse Silver Knights\u2660 | L 2\u201318 | 1\u20133 | Oncenter War Memorial Arena | 3,355 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 5 | Saturday | November 22 | 7:00pm | at Rochester Lancers\u2660 | W 15\u201313 (OT) | 2\u20133 | Blue Cross Arena | 8,214 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 6 | Tuesday | December 2 | 7:00pm | at Las Vegas Legends | W 8\u20137 | 3\u20133 | Orleans Arena | 860 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 7 | Sunday | December 7 | 3:05pm | Turlock Express | W 9\u20136 | 4\u20133 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 1,952 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 8 | Sunday | December 14 | 3:05pm | Seattle Impact | W 13\u201310 | 5\u20133 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 1,572 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 9 | Thursday | December 18 | 7:30pm | at Seattle Impact | W 11\u20139 | 6\u20133 | ShoWare Center | 365 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 10 | Saturday | December 27 | 7:05pm | at Turlock Express | L 8\u20139 (OT) | 6\u20134 | Turlock Indoor Soccer | 498 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 11 | Sunday | December 28 | 3:05pm | at Sacramento Surge | W 8\u20137 | 7\u20134 | McClellan Park | 415 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 12 | Saturday | January 3 | 7:05pm | Las Vegas Legends | L 8\u201311 | 7\u20135 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 2,024 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 13 | Friday | January 9 | 7:05pm | Harrisburg Heat | W 10\u20139 | 8\u20135 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 2,654 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 14 | Saturday | January 17 | 7:05pm | Turlock Express | W 10\u20136 | 9\u20135 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 1,911 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 15 | Sunday | January 18 | 3:05pm | Las Vegas Legends | W 6\u20135 | 10\u20135 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 2,038 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 16 | Friday | January 30 | 7:35pm | at Turlock Express | W 8\u20135 | 11\u20135 | Turlock Indoor Soccer | 509 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 17 | Saturday | January 31 | 7:05pm | at Sacramento Surge | W 11\u201310 | 12\u20135 | McClellan Park | 395 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 18 | Saturday | February 7 | 7:05pm | Sacramento Surge | W 26\u20133 | 13\u20135 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 4,672 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 19 | Thursday | February 12 | 7:05pm | San Diego Sockers | L 5\u20139 | 13\u20136 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 4,253 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 20 | Saturday | February 21 | 7:05pm | at San Diego Sockers | L 1\u20133 | 13\u20137 | Valley View Casino Center | 4,094 |} \u2660 Game played with multi-point scoring (most goals worth 2 points and select goals worth 3 points).
