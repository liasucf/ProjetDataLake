    "text": "FIFA is a series of association football simulation video games developed and released annually by Electronic Arts under the EA Sports label. Football video games such as Sensible Soccer, Kick Off and Match Day had been developed since the late 1980s and already competitive in the games market when EA Sports announced a football game as the next addition to their EA Sports label. The Guardian called the series \"the slickest, most polished and by far the most popular football game around\". As of 2011, the FIFA franchise has been localised into 18 languages and available in 51 countries.\"EA SPORTS FIFA Soccer 11 in Stores Now Throughout North America, Available in Europe and Asia Beginning September 30\". Montreal Gazette. Retrieved 1 August 2014 Listed in Guinness World Records as the best-selling sports video game franchise in the world, by 2019, the FIFA series had sold over 282.4 million copies.Fiscal year 2019, FIFA 18 2.4 million, FIFA 19: 20 million gadgets.ndtv: \"FIFA 19 Sales Flat Thanks to FIFA 18, Says EA\" It is also one of the best-selling video game franchises. When the series began in late 1993, it was notable for being the first to have an official licence from FIFA, the world governing body of football. The latest installments in the series contain many exclusively licensed leagues including leagues and teams from around the world, including the German Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga, English Premier League and EFL Championship, Italian Serie A and Serie B, Spanish La Liga and La Liga 2, French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2, Portuguese Primeira Liga, Turkish S\u00fcper Lig, Dutch Eredivisie, Scottish Premiership, the Swiss Super League, Russian Premier League, Polish Ekstraklasa, Mexican Liga MX, American Major League Soccer, South Korean K-League, Japanese J1 League, the Chinese Super League, Saudi Professional League, Australian A-League, Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n, Brazilian Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A and Argentine Superliga Argentina, allowing the use of real leagues, clubs and player names and likenesses within the games. Popular clubs from around the world, including some teams from Greece, Ukraine and South Africa, are also included, without those nations' entire leagues. The main series has been complemented by additional installments based on single major tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA European Football Championship, as well as a series of football management titles. As of FIFA 21, Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is the face of the franchise, appearing on the front cover of the series and in promotional campaigns and advertisements. He takes over from Eden Hazard of Real Madrid who was the face of the previous cover. Lionel Messi appeared on four straight covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16. Wayne Rooney has appeared in the most covers being on the cover of every game from FIFA 06 to FIFA 12. Since the release of FIFA Mobile in 2016, forward Marco Reus, Eden Hazard, Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, and Paulo Dybala have appeared on the cover. FIFA 12 holds the record for the \"fastest selling sports game ever\" with over 3.2 million games sold and over $186 million generated at retail in its first week of release. The franchise's latest release, FIFA 21, has been released worldwide on 9 October 2020. It is available for multiple gaming systems, including the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and on PC. An enhanced version of the game is to be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S and Google Stadia at some point in the future. ==History== While FIFA 95 did not add much other than the ability to play with club teams, FIFA 96 pushed the boundaries. For the first time with real player names by obtaining the FIFPro license, the PlayStation, PC, 32X and Sega Saturn versions used EA's \"Virtual Stadium\" engine, with 2D sprite players moving around a real-time 3D stadium. FIFA 97 improved on this with polygonal models for players and added an indoor soccer mode, but an early pinnacle was reached with FIFA: Road to World Cup 98. This version featured much improved graphics, a complete World Cup with qualifying rounds (including all national teams) and refined gameplay. Months later, World Cup 98, was EA's first officially licensed tournament game. John Motson was the first commentator for the FIFA series, and has worked alongside Ally McCoist, Andy Gray, Des Lynam, Mark Lawrenson and Chris Waddle. Motson first joined the franchise for FIFA 96; he and McCoist were replaced by Gray and Clive Tyldesley for FIFA 06 but later returned for FIFA Manager 08. Martin Tyler has been the default commentator for the FIFA series since 2006, alongside Andy Gray between 2006 and 2010 and Alan Smith from 2011\u2013present. FIFA games have been met with some minor criticism; such as improvements each game features over its predecessor. As the console market is expanding, FIFA is being challenged directly by other titles such as Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer series. Both FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer have a large following but FIFA sales is rising as much as 23 percent year-on-year. In 2010, the FIFA series had sold over 100 million copies, making it the best-selling sports video game franchise in the world and the most profitable EA Sports title. With FIFA 12 selling 3.2 million copies in the first week after its 27 September North American debut in 2011, EA Sports dubbed it \"the most successful launch in EA Sports history\". In 2012, EA Sports signed Lionel Messi to the FIFA franchise, luring him away from the competitor Pro Evolution Soccer. Messi's likeness was then immediately placed on the cover of FIFA Street. In 2013, the Spanish professional women's footballer Vero Boquete started a petition on Change.org, which called upon Electronic Arts to introduce female players in the FIFA series. The petition attracted 20,000 signatures in 24 hours. FIFA 16, released on 25 September 2015, included female national teams. Calling it \"the slickest, most polished and by far the most popular football game around\", and \"football [video] games\u2019 equivalent of the Premier League\", The Guardian praised the game\u2019s FIFA Ultimate Team, which \"encourages you to purchase Panini-sticker-like player packs to build up a dream team\", adding the series has \"an excellent Journey mode that lets you control an aspiring pro and build him up to an international superstar, and a Career mode that lets you control your favourite team on and off the field.\" One of the best-selling video game franchises, by 2018, the FIFA series had sold over 260 million copies. ==Games in the series== ===1990s=== ====FIFA International Soccer==== *Cover athlete: David Platt and Piotr \u015awierczewski (Packie Bonner and Ruud Gullit in some versions) *Released for: PC, DOS, Amiga, Sega CD (as FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition), 3DO, SNES, Mega Drive/Genesis, Master System, Sega Game Gear, Game Boy *Release date: 15 December 1993 Known as EA Soccer during development and sometimes subsequently also known as FIFA '94, the first game in the series was released in the weeks leading up to Christmas 1993. This greatly hyped football title broke with traditional 16-bit era games by presenting an isometric view rather than the more usual top-down view (Kick Off), side view (European Club Soccer), or bird's-eye view (Sensible Soccer). It only includes national teams, and real player names are not used. A notorious bug allows the player to score by standing in front of the goalkeeper so that the ball rebounds off him into the net. The game was number one in the UK charts, replacing Street Fighter II Special Champion Edition, and staying there for a full six months.Official Gallup UK Mega Drive sales chart, February\u2013July 1994, published in Mega issues 17-22 Mega placed the game at #11 in their Top 50 Mega Drive Games of All Time.Mega magazine issue 26, page 74, Maverick Magazines, November 1994 The Sega Mega CD version was released under the title \"FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition\" it includes some features used in the next title, and is a highly polished version of the original. This version was ranked #7 on the Mega list of the Top 10 Mega CD Games of All Time. The game on the 3DO console sported pseudo-3D cameras and it was the most graphically advanced version. Also, the game is playable on the PlayStation 2 version of FIFA 06. It was made in celebration for the 1994 FIFA World Cup held in the United States \u2013 especially noticeable in the Super NES version which, despite having a smaller team selection than the Genesis version, had three exclusive teams which qualified for the real-life tournament: Bolivia, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. The game was called International Soccer so EA could sell the game successfully in Europe, after assuming Americans would have no interest in the game. ====FIFA 95==== *Cover athlete: Erik Thorstvedt (Alexi Lalas in some versions) *Released for: Mega Drive/Genesis *Release date: 10 November 1994 Using the same engine with only minor touch-ups, FIFA 95 introduced club teams to the series within eight national leagues: Brazil, Germany's Bundesliga, Italy's Serie A, Spain's La Liga, England's Premier League, France's Ligue 1, Netherlands' Eredivisie and the United States. Most of the leagues have team lineups based on the 1993\u201394 season, and the teams, although recognisably real, all still have generic players, many of them even returning from the previous game. The USA League consists of teams and players from the A-League, the country's second division \u2013 subsequent editions would feature \"artificial\" division one leagues, a feature not corrected until the 2000 edition, when Major League Soccer was included for the first time. In addition, the Brazilian league contained only teams from S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states, with the exception of Internacional, from Rio Grande do Sul\u2014it would not be until FIFA 07 that Campeonato Brasileiro represented the country. The game eliminates the one-touch passing seen in the original FIFA International Soccer. This was also the only game in the main series not to be released in more than one platform (counting spin-offs, only FIFA 64 and certain versions of the FIFA Manager series share this distinction). ====FIFA 96==== *Cover athlete: Frank de Boer and Jason McAteer (European version) *Released for: DOS/Windows, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Sega 32X, SNES, Mega Drive/Genesis, Sega Game Gear, Game Boy *Release date: 30 September 1995 This is the first FIFA game to feature real-time 3D graphics on the Sega Saturn, PlayStation and PC versions, using technology called \"Virtual Stadium\". It is also the first in the series to present players with real player names and positions, with ranking, transfer and team customisation tools. However, the Brazilian teams had mostly inaccurate rosters, some of them even featuring long-retired players (this would only be corrected in FIFA 99), and the American league consisted of entirely fictitious teams and rosters (Major League Soccer had been inaugurated for only a few months as of the game's release, but it would only start to appear in the games as of FIFA 2000). The SNES and Mega Drive versions use an updated version of FIFA 95's engine with new teams and graphics. It is also the first FIFA game to contain a player/team editor (in the Mega Drive and fifth-generation versions only). Also, in addition to the eight national leagues of the previous game, three leagues debuted in the game: Scottish Football League Premier Division, Allsvenskan and Super League Malaysia, a lineup that would stay for the next two editions as well. This was also the first FIFA game to have a proper introduction. ====FIFA 97==== *Cover athlete: David Ginola (European version); Bebeto (rest of the world) *Released for: DOS/Windows, PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Mega Drive/Genesis, SNES, Game Boy *Release date: 30 November 1996 The biggest change in FIFA '97 was the inclusion of 6-a-side indoor soccer mode and polygonal players, with motion capture provided by David Ginola. The game features a much higher number of playable leagues from England, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Malaysia. These versions also feature commentary by John Motson, partnered by Andy Gray, with Des Lynam introducing the matches. ====FIFA: Road to World Cup 98==== *Cover athlete: Roy Lassiter (USA); David Beckham (UK); Paolo Maldini (Italy); David Ginola (France); Andreas M\u00f6ller (Germany); Ra\u00fal (Spain) *Title song: \"Song 2\" by Blur *Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, SNES, Mega Drive/Genesis, Game Boy *Release date: 8 November 1997 This game marks the start of an upward trend in the series. It boasts a refined graphics engine, team and player customisation options, 16 stadia, improved artificial intelligence, a \"Road to World Cup\" mode with all FIFA-registered national teams, and a licensed soundtrack featuring popular musical artists of the time. The game features many accurate team squads for national call up when playing in the round robin qualification modes. Another new feature was the ability to manually change the referee's strictness, allowing some fouls to go un-noticed or without punishment. Additionally, for the first time in a FIFA game, the offside rule is properly implemented. In previous games, when a player was in an offside position doing anything except running, that player was penalised for offside even when the ball was passed backwards. The 32-bit version of FIFA 98 corrects this so that the game would only award a free kick for offside if the ball was passed roughly to where the player in the offside position was. FIFA 98 was also the first of the series to feature a licensed soundtrack, with \"Song 2\" by Blur used as the intro track for the game. It was the last FIFA game to be released on the 16-bit consoles that the series had originated on. ====FIFA 99==== *Cover athlete: Dennis Bergkamp (World), Kasey Keller (USA), Fabien Barthez (France), Hidetoshi Nakata (Japan); Olaf Thon (Germany); Rui Costa (Portugal); Christian Vieri (Italy); Ahn Jung-hwan (South Korea); Fernando Morientes (Spain); Jason Kreis (USA beta) *Title song: \"The Rockafeller Skank (Remix)\" by Fatboy Slim *Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 *Release date: 30 November 1998. No description. ====FIFA 2000==== *Title song: \"It's Only Us\" by Robbie Williams *Cover athlete: Hidetoshi Nakata (Japan); Sol Campbell (UK); Vincenzo Montella (Italy); Pep Guardiola (Spain); Emmanuel Petit (France); Jaap Stam (Netherlands); Vassilios Tsiartas (Greece); Mehmet Scholl (Germany); Sim\u00e3o (Portugal); Eddie Pope (US); Ra\u00ed (Brazil); P\u00e4r Zetterberg (Sweden); \u0110ovani Roso (Israel); Kim Byung-ji (South Korea); Kiatisuk Senamuang (Thailand); *Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Game Boy Color *Release date: 26 October 1999 This version of the FIFA series contained over 40 \"classic\" teams, so that gamers could play as retired football legends. It marked the introduction of Major League Soccer, replacing the fictitious \"American\" league previously included, as well as national leagues from Denmark, Greece, Israel, Norway and Turkey (though Galatasaray is not present in the game). The game features over 40 national sides, fully integrated seasons, set piece selections, increased physical contact, new facial animations, shielding ability and tougher tackling. The game received mixed reviews due to its cartoonish graphic engine and shallow gameplay, a brand new engine was implemented in an attempt to give more \"emotion\" to the 3D player models. The game was generally considered to be much inferior than its rival. The opening video for FIFA 2000 features Sol Campbell performing motion capture duties for the game, then having his likeness computer-generated to play against a retro side from 1904, the year of the inauguration of FIFA. The game also included Port Vale, the club supported by Williams, in the \"Rest of the World\" section (they were in the Football League First Division at the time, and while the concept of post-season promotion and relegation was introduced in this edition, teams from lower league tiers were only selectable starting with FIFA 2004). ===2000s=== ====FIFA 2001==== *Title song: \"Bodyrock\" by Moby *Cover athlete: Edgar Davids (Netherlands); Paul Scholes (UK); Gheorghe Hagi (Romania); Ben Olsen (US); Ricardo S\u00e1 Pinto (Portugal); Gaizka Mendieta (Spain); Filippo Inzaghi (Italy); Lothar Matth\u00e4us (Germany); Thierry Henry (France); Leonardo (Brazil); Shimon Gershon (Israel); Ko Jong- soo (South Korea) *Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, PlayStation *Release date: 8 November 2000 This title had a new graphics engine from FIFA Soccer World Championship which allows each team to have its own detailed kit, and for some players, their own unique faces. Doing away with ordinary coloured pennants as club emblems, the license includes official club emblems for the first time, although certain leagues, like the Dutch league, are unlicensed. Slightly tweakable physics made the game a modding favorite for its fan community. The game also includes the entire Austrian Bundesliga and Korean K-League as playable leagues for the first time, albeit removing the Portuguese Liga and the Turkish Premier League. A \"hack\" feature is included, where the player can press R1 to attempt an intentional foul, such a high sliding tackle. This title was the first game of the series with a power bar for shooting (such a feature already existed in the Super NES version of the first game, but it was not in all versions of the game). FIFA 2001 was the first version (for the PC) that could be played online, which was revolutionary, and the first game in the franchise on a 6th generation video game console in USA and Europe. The PlayStation version of FIFA 2001 received a \"Gold\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. ====FIFA Football 2002==== *Title song: \"19-2000 (Soulchild Remix)\" by Gorillaz *Cover athlete: Hidetoshi Nakata (Japan); Thierry Henry (France, UK, USA); Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 (Sweden); Nuno Gomes (Portugal); Francesco Totti (Italy); Ruud van Nistelrooy (Netherlands); \u0130lhan Mans\u0131z (Turkey); Gerald Asamoah (Germany); Lampros Choutos (Greece); Hong Myung-bo (South Korea); Sibusiso Zuma (South Africa & Denmark); Nawaf Al-Temyat (Saudi Arabia); Tomasz Radzinski (US); Roberto Carlos (Brazil); Iker Casillas (Spain); Tomasz Frankowski (Poland); Haim Revivo (Israel) *Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, GameCube, PlayStation *Release date: 1 November 2001 For FIFA Football 2002, power bars for passes were introduced, and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level. The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer's preference. The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs such as PSV, Ajax and Feyenoord, although there was no Dutch league of any kind (they were under the \"Rest of World\" header). This game also features, for the first time, the Swiss Super League, at the cost of excluding the Greek League. A card reward system licensed from Panini was also introduced where, after winning a particular competition, a star player card is unlocked. There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the 2002 World Cup (France, Japan and South Korea), in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies. Playing with other national teams will allow the player to play through their respective zones' qualifying rounds (except for Oceania and Africa, whose confederations are not represented in full). FIFA Football 2002 was the final game in the main series to feature the Japanese national team, as the Japan Football Association would sell its exclusive rights to Konami during 2002, thereby depriving not only FIFA, but all other football games in the market (with the exception of EA's World Cup spin-offs), from using its lineup and likeness (Japanese players in foreign markets continued to be featured in the series, though) until FIFA 17. ====FIFA Football 2003==== *Cover athlete: Roberto Carlos, Ryan Giggs, and Edgar Davids (in the United States, only Landon Donovan appeared) *Title song: \"To Get Down (Fatboy Slim remix)\" by Timo Maas *Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, Mobile phone *Release date: 5 November 2002 FIFA Football 2003 added features completely new gameplay from the previous titles. EA revamped the outdated DirectX 7 graphics used in FIFA 2001 and 2002, and introduced new graphics featuring more detailed stadia, players, and kits. Club Championship Mode was introduced with the feature of playing against 17 of Europe's top clubs in their own stadia and the fans singing their unique chants and songs. A TV-style broadcast package gave highlights at half-time and full-time, as well as comprehensive analysis. One of the most anticipated new features was EA Sport's \"Freestyle Control\" which allows the user to flick the ball on and lay it off to teammates. Other additions include greater likenesses of players such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho, as well as realistic player responses. An Xbox version was added to the Windows and PlayStation 2, whereas the original PlayStation version was dropped. FIFA Football 2003 was also the first game in the series to use the EA Trax. EA Trax is the exclusive music menu system that has been used ever since in all FIFA titles. ====FIFA Football 2004==== *Cover athlete: Thierry Henry, Alessandro Del Piero and Ronaldinho *Title song: \"Red Morning Light\" by Kings of Leon *Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, Nokia N-Gage, Mobile phone *Release date: 18 October 2003 While not adding much to the game engine, the biggest new inclusion in FIFA Football 2004 is secondary divisions, which allow the player to take lower ranked teams into the top leagues and competitions (a promotion/relegation system was present since the 2000 edition, but none up until this one featured second-tier leagues). A new gameplay feature dubbed \"off the ball\" was introduced, which is the ability to simultaneously control two players, in order, for example, to move a second player into the box in anticipation of a pass. The online mode was touted as the main feature. Another key feature is \"Football Fusion\", which allows owners of both FIFA 2004 and Total Club Manager 2004 to play games from TCM in FIFA 2004. This is also the first FIFA game to feature Latin American club teams aside from those of the Brazilian League; there are four from Mexico (Am\u00e9rica, Toluca, Monterrey and UNAM; a fifth team, Tigres UANL, is present only in the Game Boy Advance version) and two from Argentina (Boca Juniors and River Plate). The title sequence, featuring Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry and Alessandro Del Piero, was filmed at St James' Park, the home ground of Newcastle United. ====FIFA Football 2005==== *Cover athlete: Patrick Vieira, Fernando Morientes and Andriy Shevchenko (in North America, Oswaldo S\u00e1nchez replaced Patrick Vieira) *Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation, PlayStation Portable (America only), Game Boy Advance, Nokia N-Gage, Gizmondo, Mobile phone *Release date: 11 October 2004 FIFA Football 2005 was released much earlier than the usual late October date to obtain a head start over Pro Evolution Soccer 4 and avoid clashing with EA Sports' own FIFA Street. The game features the return of the create-a-player mode, as well as an improved Career mode. The biggest difference compared to previous titles in the series is the inclusion of first-touch gameplay which provides gamers with the ability to perform real-life tricks and passes. It is also the first version to feature the full Mexican League. The game has no opening video, but its soundtrack is headlined by British DJ Paul Oakenfold, who composed the FIFA Theme especially for the game, using some sounds from the game such as artificial crowd noise and commentary. This was the last title released for the original PlayStation in the US. The game also features authentic crowd chants edited by producer Dan Motut. ====FIFA 06==== *Cover athlete: Wayne Rooney and Ronaldinho (in North America, Omar Bravo and Freddy Adu joined Ronaldinho on the cover) *Released for: GameCube, Microsoft Windows, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, Xbox, Game Boy Advance, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360 *Release date: 4 October 2005 FIFA's developers made a complete overhaul of the game engine for this installment of FIFA, claiming a dramatic increase in the control of play, having rewritten more than half the game's code. In addition to a renovation of the engine, which discards the \"off the ball\" system, the developers boasted a significantly more involved Career mode and the introduction of \"team chemistry\" which determines how well team members play together. This installment breaks with the long tradition of commentary from Match of the Day's John Motson and (more recently) Ally McCoist, who are replaced by ITV's Clive Tyldesley and former Sky Sports pundit Andy Gray, who had already worked in the series as guest commentator. One of the new features in FIFA 06 was a special \"retro\" which features nostalgia of the game. Inside it includes an unlockable classic biographies section, a memorable moments video compilation, which features ten of the most memorable moments as judged by the FIFA 06 developers, a video compilation with a retrospective view of every game in the FIFA series and the chance to play the first ever game in the FIFA series which was titled as \"FIFA 94\". The game also features for the first time a Classic XI team consisting of great football legends and a World XI team consisting of current great superstars. Both teams have the Cardiff Millennium Stadium as their primary ground. These clubs must be unlocked in the \"Fan Shop\". The Xbox 360 version, titled FIFA 06: Road to FIFA World Cup, featured only national teams and a brand-new engine taking advantage of the Xbox 360's graphical capabilities. It was the first FIFA game on a seventh- generation console. ====FIFA 07==== *Cover athlete: Wayne Rooney and Ronaldinho (worldwide); Ronaldinho and Lukas Podolski (Germany); Ronaldinho, Landon Donovan and Francisco Fonseca (North America); Ronaldinho and Juninho Pernambucano (France); Ronaldinho and David Villa (Spain) *Released for: Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Advance, Java ME *Release date: 27 September 2006 The main differences from the previous game are a new \"Interactive Leagues\" function, new stadia such as the new Wembley Stadium and Emirates Stadium, and the ability to create custom teams and Turkcell Super League returns after seven years of absence from the series. The game's front-end and graphics engine remain largely the same. The Xbox 360 version uses a completely new game engine which was created from scratch for the system. This Xbox 360 version also features a much reduced team line-up, completely removing all lower division teams and focusing on the four main European leagues, plus the Mexican Clausura and national teams. This was the last title released for the GameCube, Xbox and Game Boy Advance. ====FIFA 08==== *Slogans: Can You FIFA 08? *Cover athlete: Wayne Rooney and Ronaldinho (worldwide); Ronaldinho and Miroslav Klose (Germany); Ronaldinho and Sergio Ramos (Spain); Ronaldinho, Jozy Altidore and Guillermo Ochoa (North America); Ronaldinho and Euzebiusz Smolarek (Poland); *Title Song: \"Sketches (20 Something Life)\" by La Rocca *Released for: Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, Java ME *Release date: 20 September 2007 FIFA 08 introduced a new game mode called \"Be a Pro\", in which the player controls only a single player on the field. This version also introduced a larger club section including the League of Ireland, and the Hyundai A-League of Australia, for the first time. Unlike FIFA 06 and 07 however, FIFA 08 does not include any memorable moments or season highlights. It was the first game in the franchise for PlayStation 3 and Wii, the latter introducing motion controls for shooting, as well as three mini- games that make use of the Wii Remote. ====FIFA 09==== *Slogans: Are You Ready For FIFA 09? *Cover athlete: Wayne Rooney and Ronaldinho (worldwide); Wayne Rooney and Sergio Ramos (Spain); Ronaldinho and Kevin Kuranyi (Germany); Ronaldinho and Bal\u00e1zs Dzsudzs\u00e1k (Hungary); Ronaldinho and Daniele De Rossi (Italy); Ronaldinho, Maurice Edu and Guillermo Ochoa (North America) *Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, Java ME, Zeebo *Release date: 3 October 2008 FIFA 09 features a revamped collision system and an option for 10 versus 10 \"Be a Pro\" online matches, and the new \"Adidas Live Season\" feature, which updates all the players' stats in a particular league based on the player's form in real life. Although the feature is activated through microtransactions, gamers have access to one free league of their choice from the moment they activate the service to the end of the 2008\u201309 season. Online play has also been improved in FIFA 09, with a feature called \"FIFA 09 Clubs\" allowing players to form or join clubs and field their strongest team online. The game is the first in the FIFA series to feature user-controlled goal celebrations. FIFA 09 has met with generally positive reception from reviewers. Clive Tyldesley and Andy Gray again provide the commentary in the English version. However, in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game, Tyldesley is replaced by Martin Tyler. For the first time, users can also purchase extra commentator voices in different languages from the PlayStation Store (PlayStation 3) and Xbox Live Marketplace (Xbox 360).FIFA soccer 09 Free download - 14 Commentator's Pack Zimbio Another option for the English language is Tyldesley and Andy Townsend. ===2010s=== ====FIFA 10==== *Slogans: Lets FIFA 10 *Cover athlete: Theo Walcott, Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney (UK); Wayne Rooney and Tim Cahill (Australia); Wayne Rooney and Andreas Ivanschitz (Austria); Wayne Rooney and Bal\u00e1zs Dzsudzs\u00e1k (Hungary), Wayne Rooney and Robert Lewandowski (Poland); Ronaldinho and Giorgio Chiellini (Italy); Karim Benzema, Steve Mandanda and Guillaume Hoarau (France); Wayne Rooney and Bastian Schweinsteiger (Germany); Frank Lampard and Sim\u00e3o (Portugal); Karim Benzema and Xavi (Spain); Frank Lampard; Sacha Kljestan and Cuauht\u00e9moc Blanco (North America); Sergei Semak (Russia) *Released for: Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, iOS, Android, Java ME *Release date: 2 October 2009 (Europe), 20 October 2009 (USA) FIFA 10 has an extended Manager Mode which includes a new Assistant Manager that can be used to take care of the team's line-up and to rotate the squad based on importance of the upcoming match and improved finances. The \"Player Experience and Growth System\" has changed. Player growth will now be determined by in-game performance, demands placed on the player, and achievements based on the player's particular position. The games also features 50 stadia and 31 leagues, among which the Russian Premier League is introduced to the series (except for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions). It also includes 360 degrees player control instead of the 8-direction control in previous games. ====FIFA 11==== *Slogans: We Are 11 *Cover athlete : Kak\u00e1 (World), Wayne Rooney (United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland & Australia), Mesut \u00d6zil & Ren\u00e9 Adler (Germany), Tim Cahill (Australia), Jakub B\u0142aszczykowski (Poland); *Released for: Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, iOS, BlackBerry OS, Java ME *Release date: 28 September 2010 (USA), 1 October 2010 (Europe) FIFA 11 was released 28 September 2010 in North America and 1 October 2010 in Europe.

Other new features include an improved passing system, improved player likenesses, the ability to play as a Goalkeeper for the first time, and other various other tweaks and additions.

The Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 were the main consoles for the game, and for the first time, the PC version was feature-identical. In May, EA announced that a Nintendo 3DS version would be available, including career mode, 11 vs 11, street mode and Be a Pro, but excluding any online mode. On 27 May, it was confirmed that FIFA 12 would be released on PlayStation 2.

For the first time in the series, the game has been officially ported to the Mac OS X operating system by TransGaming. In March 2012, FIFA Football was released as a launch title for the PS Vita, which despite the different name was a port of FIFA 12.

It is the only FIFA title to be released on the Wii U. New features include: *Attacking Intelligence \u2013 Players automatically analyse space and think ahead making it potentially easier to break down the defence. Goalkeeping Intelligence has also been improved in similar ways. *Complete Dribbling \u2013 Precise 360-degree mobility with the ball allowing players to be more dangerous and creative during 1-on-1 confrontations. *1st Touch Control \u2013 Eliminates near-perfect touches for all players and allowing defenders to take advantage of the loss of focus and poor touches to win back possession. *EA SPORTS Football Club \u2013 Earn rewards, level-up, enjoy live challenges and connect with friends.

Also, all versions have an all-new Co-op Seasons online mode, in which two players can play a season for the same team. As for the team selection, the game features, for the first time, the top leagues from Argentina, Chile and Colombia, the first time South American leagues other than the Brazilian one are featured in a FIFA game. The PC version does not feature the Ignite engine (which will be exclusive to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One releases); rather than that, they will feature the Impact engine, same as used in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions (which the PC versions have been using since 11), with minor improvements. This is reportedly due to Electronic Arts' claims that most PC players do not own a machine powerful enough for the Ignite engine, therefore it would only be featured in the next edition. This is the last FIFA game to be released for the PlayStation Portable and FIFA 14 would eventually become the last PlayStation 2 game produced and released in South America. The game features new signature goal celebrations from a number of players including Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Lionel Messi, among others.\"Fifa 14 celebrations: How to do Gareth Bale, Ronaldo, and Lionel Messi's signature moves\".

The first edition released during EA's deal with the English Premier League as Official Sports Technology Partner. This deal allows all 20 Premier League stadiums to be included in the game as well as official Premier League scoreboards and television graphics. FIFA's exclusive access to Premier League clubs allowed detailed photography of all 20 stadiums so they could be authentically recreated, with the cheers, chants and sounds of more than 20 Premier League matches also recorded.

After the complications in the previous edition, some Brazilian teams agreed to lend their visual identities (badges, names and kits) to the game, but no such agreement was reached with players due to the decentralization of player image rights in Brazil; as a result, the Brazilian teams are placed in the Rest of World block (being given their own incomplete league slot in subsequent editions), with their rosters comprised completely by fictional players, unlike all other clubs and most national teams. ====FIFA 17==== * Slogans: Football Has Changed * Cover athlete: Marco Reus (World, chosen by popular vote over Anthony Martial, Eden Hazard and James Rodr\u00edguez) * Released for: Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One * Release date: 27 September 2016 (North America), 29 September 2016 (worldwide) FIFA 17 is the first time the FIFA video game series to use the Frostbite game engine and also the first to implement a story mode, namely, \"The Journey\".

It is similar to the 32-bit versions of FIFA 97, and was initially announced under the same title. High numbers of pre-orders for FIFA 64 led Electronic Arts to reverse its recent decision to withdraw from Nintendo 64 software development, instead announcing plans to release several EA Sports games for the Nintendo 64 over the next year. ;FA Premier League Stars series :Two games, in 2000 and 2001, FIFA was based primarily around the Premier League, though localised versions of the second game were released in Germany, France, Spain and South Korea. ;FIFA Soccer World Championship (FIFA\u30b5\u30c3\u30ab\u30fc \u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30d4\u30aa\u30f3\u30b7\u30c3\u30d7) :Released only in Japan on 25 May 2000, this PlayStation 2 exclusive, a prototype of FIFA 2001, was the first installment of the series on a 6th generation video game console. The game contains under-23 national teams like Australia national under-23 soccer team, and Japan national under-23 football team, due to Japan U-23 having qualified to the quarter-finals at the Sydney Olympics, just like a Japanese version of ISS Pro Evolution 2, but it sold only in Japan by Electronic Arts Square. ;UEFA Champions League series :Two games were released in the series: UEFA Champions League 2004\u20132005 and UEFA Champions League 2006\u20132007. ;FIFA Total Football (FIFA\u30c8\u30fc\u30bf\u30eb\u30d5\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb) :Released in Japan in March 2004 on the PlayStation 2, it was based on FIFA 2004. ;FIFA Superstars :This is a Facebook game developed for EA Sports by Playfish. The game operates on a similar premise to the \"Ultimate Team\" mode that appears in the main FIFA games. Users collect trading cards that represent different players; each card has a statistical rating of the player's skills, contributing to an average team skill rating. The skill rating is augmented by a \"training\" rating, and the combination of the two ratings gives the overall team rating. These ratings determine the outcomes of matches played by the team; a team must win a certain number of matches to progress through a series of leagues, culminating with the \"Superstars\" league. Users may purchase new player cards with in-game \"coins\", which are acquired through playing matches, winning leagues and as gifts from friends; the cards come in bronze, silver and gold packs, with bronze containing low-rated players and gold containing the best players in the game, although gold packs cost more coins. Coins may also be used to purchase training and stadium upgrades, such as training cones and seating. The game requires match credits, which can be earned by playfish cash, penalty shootouts, playing against your friends or simply waiting over time. The game was released in February 2010. The game has gone offline at the end of March 2013, with very lousy service and many user complaints on the forum. ;FIFA World :A free-to-play massive multiplayer online FIFA game, this time distributed by EA Sports themselves.
