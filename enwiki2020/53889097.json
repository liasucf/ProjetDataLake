    "text": "The Merchant Navy and Airline Officers' Association (MNAOA) was a trade union representing officers in the United Kingdom. The origins of the union lay in 1921, when Captain W. H. Coombes founded the Navigators and General Insurance Company Ltd. It offered insurance for officers in the merchant navy against the possibility of the Board of Trade cancelling their certificate of competency. A succession of small rivals began offering similar services, prompting Coombes to expand operations to the insurance of small vessels. He also created a trust to administer the company, and this began representing officers in negotiations with employers and the government.Arthur Marsh and Victoria Ryan, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, vol.3, pp.203-204 Over time, the trade union functions of the company increased and, in 1935, the Navigators and Engineering Officers' Union was created to take these on, with all policyholders becoming members. In 1956, the Marine Engineers' Association merged in, and the union was renamed as the MNAOA. In 1985, it merged with the Radio and Electronic Officers' Union to form the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers. ==General Secretaries== :1935: William Harry Coombs :1943: Douglas Tennant :1971: John Slater :1974: Eric Nevin ==References== ==External links== *Catalogue of the MNAOA archives held at the Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick Category:Defunct trade unions of the United Kingdom Category:Maritime officers' trade unions Category:Transport trade unions in the United Kingdom Category:Trade unions established in 1956 Category:Trade unions disestablished in 1985 ",
