    "text": "Dragan Jakovljevi\u0107 (, born 23 February 1962) is a Bosnian Serb former footballer who played as a forward for FK Sarajevo, Nantes, Royal Antwerp as well as the SFR Yugoslavia national team. Jakovljevi\u0107 was included by Yugoslavia national football team to UEFA Euro 1992 as a replacement player to Darko Pan\u010dev, who renounced in 24 May by claiming physical reasons, although this statement was believed for just a few people in Belgrade, who saw political views as the true cause of the withdrawal of the Macedonian forward. Jakovljevi\u0107, however, could never play in the tournament, as the national team would be suspended one week later due to the Yugoslav Wars. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina footballers Category:Serbian footballers Category:Yugoslav footballers Category:Yugoslavia international footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Yugoslav First League players Category:Ligue 1 players Category:Belgian First Division A players Category:FK Sarajevo players Category:FC Nantes players Category:Royal Antwerp F.C. players Category:Expatriate footballers in Belgium Category:Expatriate footballers in France Category:Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Yugoslav expatriate footballers Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina expatriate footballers Category:Yugoslav expatriates in France Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina expatriate sportspeople in Belgium ",
