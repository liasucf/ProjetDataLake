    "text": "David George Hogarth (23 May 1862 \u2013 6 November 1927), also known as D. G. Hogarth, was a British archaeologist and scholar associated with T. E. Lawrence and Arthur Evans. He was Keeper of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford from 1909 to 1927. Hogarth was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the First World War, and served with the Naval Intelligence Division. During 1916, he was the acting director of the Arab Bureau, and was later responsible for delivering the Hogarth message. ==Early life and education== D. G. Hogarth was the son of Reverend George Hogarth, Vicar of Barton-upon- Humber, and Jane Elizabeth (Uppleby) Hogarth. He had a sister three years younger, Janet E. Courtney, an author and feminist. In one of his autobiographical works, Hogarth claimed to be an antiquary who was made so, rather than born to it. He said, \"nothing disposed me to my trade in early years.\" Those years included a secondary education, 1876\u20131880, at Winchester College, which claims to be, and was labelled by Hogarth as, \"our oldest Public School.\". In October 1881, Hogarth matriculated into Magdalen College, Oxford to study Literae Humaniores. He achieved first class honours in both Mods (1882) and Greats (1885). He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1885: as per tradition, his BA was promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Oxon) degree. ==Career== In 1886, Hogarth was elected a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford. Between 1887 and 1907, he travelled to excavations in Cyprus, Crete, Egypt, Syria, Melos, and Ephesus (the Temple of Artemis). On the island of Crete, he excavated Zakros and Psychro Cave. Hogarth was named director of the British School at Athens in 1897 and occupied the position until 1900. He was the keeper of the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford from 1909 It was at the Ashmolean in early 1909 that Hogarth first met T. E. Lawrence \u2013 Wilson, Jeremy (1989) Lawrence of Arabia p.53 \u2013 ( see also long footnote on p.987-988 where Robert Graves in his 1927 work Lawrence and the Arabs had an account of the meeting as January 1909 ) until his death in 1927.M, J.

E. Lawrence (left) and Lt Col. Dawnay at the Arab Bureau, Cairo, May 1918 In 1915, during the First World War, Hogarth was commissioned with the temporary rank of lieutenant commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and joined the Geographical Section of the Naval Intelligence Division. Professor Hogarth was appointed the acting director of the Arab Bureau, for a time during 1916 when Sir Mark Sykes went back to London. Kinahan Cornwallis was his deputy. Hogarth was close with T. E. Lawrence and worked with Lawrence to plan the Arab Revolt. Sykes befriended Hogarth, who had described India Government as believing they had a moral imperative to the British Raj as the best form of government and could not fail in their duty to impose it on a Province of Mesopotamia. The Arabists rejected this proposal vehemently; Sykes taking Hogarth's research as evidence of the uniquely different situation in the protectorate. The archaeologists knew it was clear that the Raj had no understanding of the different conditions, that there needed to be a specific \"Arab Policy\" for what had become a frontier of empire.James Onley, The Arabian Frontier of the British Raj (1921) Hogarth returned to Oxford and the Ashmolean Museum in June 1919. From 1925 to 1927 he was President of the Royal Geographical Society. ==Personal life== D. G.
