He was married to P\u0103una Greceanu-Cantacuzino. ==Life== \u0218tefan was involved in his father's intrigue against Prince Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu, denouncing him to the Ottoman Empire (Wallachia's overlord), and surrendering Br\u00e2ncoveanu's secret correspondence with the Habsburg Monarchy, enemies of the Porte in the Great Turkish War. After obtaining the Prince's deposition, he took the throne in Bucharest as an Ottoman appointee. His rule coincided with the Habsburg attack led by Prince Eugene of Savoy, during which the Cantacuzinos shook off Ottoman tutelage, informing Stephan, comte de Steinville on the Porte's war preparations. A kapucu was sent to depose Prince \u0218tefan in January 1716, and arrested him together with his father and uncle (the sp\u0103tar Mihai Cantacuzino). The three of them were executed in Constantinople. Following \u0218tefan Cantacuzino's death, the Phanariote rule in Wallachia was established as a way to ensure a tighter Ottoman control over Wallachia. ==See also== *Cantacuzino family ==References== *Neagu Djuvara, \u00centre Orient \u0219i Occident. \u021a\u0103rile rom\u00e2ne la \u00eenceputul epocii moderne, Humanitas, Bucharest, 1995, p. 31, 336 Category:1715 deaths Stefan Category:Executed monarchs Category:Rulers of Wallachia Category:Romanian people executed abroad Category:18th-century executions by the Ottoman Empire Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Craiove\u0219ti ",
