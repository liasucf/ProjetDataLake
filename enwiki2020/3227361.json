    "text": "Deathbird Stories: A Pantheon of Modern Gods is a 1975 collection of short stories by American author Harlan Ellison, written over a period of ten years;pg 297 of the Bluejay edition, from the Gratia gratiam parit: \"It took ten years to complete this cycle of stories.\" the stories address the theme of modern-day \"deities\" that have replaced the older, more traditional ones. The collection, with its satirical, skeptical tone, is widely considered one of Ellison's best. The book includes a 1973 introduction and a stern caveat lector page advising the reader against enjoying the volume in one sitting. The title of the book comes from \"The Deathbird\", the nineteenth and last story in the collection. The collection includes three major award-winners, including \"The Whimper of Whipped Dogs\", which won the Edgar Award; \"Adrift Just Off the Islets of Langerhans: Latitude 38\u00b0 54' N, Longitude 77\u00b0 00' 13\" W\", which won the Hugo Award; and \"The Deathbird\", another Hugo Award winner.
