    "text": "In mathematics, an Euler brick, named after Leonhard Euler, is a rectangular cuboid whose edges and face diagonals all have integer lengths. A primitive Euler brick is an Euler brick whose edge lengths are relatively prime. A perfect Euler brick is one where the longest diagonal is also a whole number but such a brick has not yet been found. Euler brick with edges and face diagonals == Definition == The definition of an Euler brick in geometric terms is equivalent to a solution to the following system of Diophantine equations: :\\begin{cases} a^2 + b^2 = d^2\\\\\\ a^2 + c^2 = e^2\\\\\\ b^2 + c^2 = f^2\\end{cases} where are the edges and are the diagonals. == Properties == * If is a solution, then is also a solution for any . Consequently, the solutions in rational numbers are all rescalings of integer solutions. Given an Euler brick with edge-lengths , the triple constitutes an Euler brick as well.Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski, Pythagorean Triangles, Dover Publications, 2003 (orig. ed. 1962). * At least two edges of an Euler brick are divisible by 3. * At least two edges of an Euler brick are divisible by 4. * At least one edge of an Euler brick is divisible by 11. == Examples == The smallest Euler brick, discovered by Paul Halcke in 1719, has edges and face diagonals .Visions of Infinity: The Great Mathematical Problems By Ian Stewart, Chapter 17 Some other small primitive solutions, given as edges \u2014 face diagonals , are below: All five primitive Euler bricks with dimensions under 1000 :{| style=\"border- collapse:collapse;text-align:right;white-space:nowrap;\" |(|| 85,|| 132,|| 720||) \u2014 (|| 157,|| 725,|| 732||) |- |(||140,|| 480,|| 693||) \u2014 (|| 500,|| 707,|| 843||) |- |(||160,|| 231,|| 792||) \u2014 (|| 281,|| 808,|| 825||) |- |(||187,||1020,||1584||) \u2014 (||1037,||1595,||1884||) |- |(||195,|| 748,||6336||) \u2014 (|| 773,||6339,||6380||) |- |(||240,|| 252,|| 275||) \u2014 (|| 348,|| 365,|| 373||) |- |(||429,|| 880,||2340||) \u2014 (|| 979,||2379,||2500||) |- |(||495,||4888,||8160||) \u2014 (||4913,||8175,||9512||) |- |(||528,||5796,||6325||) \u2014 (||5820,||6347,||8579||) |} == Generating formula == Euler found at least two parametric solutions to the problem, but neither gives all solutions. An infinitude of Euler bricks can be generated with Sounderson's parametric formula. Let be a Pythagorean triple (that is, .) Then the edges : a=u|4v^2-w^2| ,\\quad b=v|4u^2-w^2|, \\quad c=4uvw give face diagonals :d=w^3, \\quad e=u(4v^2+w^2), \\quad f=v(4u^2+w^2). There are many Euler bricks which are not parametrized as above, for instance the Euler brick with edges and face diagonals . == Perfect cuboid == A perfect cuboid (also called a perfect Euler brick, a perfect box) is an Euler brick whose space diagonal also has integer length. In other words, the following equation is added to the system of Diophantine equations defining an Euler brick: :a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = g^2, where is the space diagonal. , no example of a perfect cuboid had been found and no one has proven that none exist. Euler brick with edges and face diagonals Exhaustive computer searches show that, if a perfect cuboid exists, * the odd edge must be greater than 2.5 \u00d7 1013, * the smallest edge must be greater than . Some facts are known about properties that must be satisfied by a primitive perfect cuboid, if one exists, based on modular arithmetic:M. Kraitchik, On certain Rational Cuboids, Scripta Mathematica, volume 11 (1945). * One edge, two face diagonals and the body diagonal must be odd, one edge and the remaining face diagonal must be divisible by 4, and the remaining edge must be divisible by 16. * Two edges must have length divisible by 3 and at least one of those edges must have length divisible by 9. * One edge must have length divisible by 5. * One edge must have length divisible by 7. * One edge must have length divisible by 11. * One edge must have length divisible by 19. * One edge or space diagonal must be divisible by 13. * One edge, face diagonal or space diagonal must be divisible by 17. * One edge, face diagonal or space diagonal must be divisible by 29. * One edge, face diagonal or space diagonal must be divisible by 37. In addition: * The space diagonal is neither a prime power nor a product of two primes. * The space diagonal can only contain prime divisors \u2261 1(mod 4).I. Korec, Lower bounds for Perfect Rational Cuboids, Math. Slovaca, 42 (1992), No. 5, p. 565-582.Ronald van Luijk, On Perfect Cuboids, June 2000 == Almost-perfect cuboids == An almost-perfect cuboid has 6 out of the 7 lengths as rational. Such cuboids can be sorted into three types, called Body, Edge, and Face cuboids.Rathbun R. L., Granlund \u0422., The integer cuboid table with body, edge, and face type of solutions // Math. Comp., 1994, Vol. 62, P. 441-442. In the case of the Body cuboid, the body (space) diagonal is irrational. For the Edge cuboid, one of the edges is irrational. The Face cuboid has just one of the face diagonals irrational. The Body cuboid is commonly referred to as the Euler cuboid in honor of Leonard Euler, who discussed this type of cuboid.Euler, Leonard, Vollst\u00a8andige Anleitung zur Algebra, Kayserliche Akademie der Wissenschaften, St. Petersburg, 1771 He was also aware of Face cuboids, and provided the (104, 153, 672) example. Euler, Leonard, Vollst\u00a8andige Anleitung zur Algebra, 2, Part II, 236, English translation: Euler, Elements of Algebra, Springer-Verlag 1984 The three integer cuboid edge lengths and three integer diagonal lengths of a face cuboid can also be interpreted as the edge lengths of a Heronian tetrahedron that is also a Schl\u00e4fli orthoscheme. There are infinitely many face cuboids, and infinitely many Heronian orthoschemes. Only recently have cuboids in complex numbers become known. Randall L. Rathbun published 155,151 found cuboids with the smallest integer edge less than 157,000,000,000: 56,575 were Euler (Body) cuboids, 15,449 were Edge cuboids with a complex number edge length, 30,081 were Edge cuboids, and 53,046 were Face cuboids. The smallest solutions for each type of almost-perfect cuboids, given as edges, face diagonals and the space diagonal : * Body cuboid: * Edge cuboid: * Face cuboid: * Complex Body cuboid: * Complex Edge cuboid: * Complex Face cuboid: == Perfect parallelepiped == A perfect parallelepiped is a parallelepiped with integer-length edges, face diagonals, and body diagonals, but not necessarily with all right angles; a perfect cuboid is a special case of a perfect parallelepiped. In 2009, dozens of perfect parallelepipeds were shown to exist,. answering an open question of Richard Guy. Some of these perfect parallelepipeds have two rectangular faces. The smallest perfect parallelepiped has edges 271, 106, and 103; short face diagonals 101, 266, and 255; long face diagonals 183, 312, and 323; and body diagonals 374, 300, 278, and 272. == See also == * Pythagorean quadruple == Notes == == References == * * * * * Category:Arithmetic problems of solid geometry Category:Diophantine equations Category:Pythagorean theorem Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics ",
