Despite growing up in a rugby dominated country, Whippy started playing basketball at a young age due to family influence \u2013 both his parents played and coached basketball at some level in Fiji. He quickly learned the skills and tactics of the game, and at the age of 14, he represented Fiji with the national basketball team. With the national team, he won gold medals at the 2002 Oceania Youth Tournament in Tonga and the 2007 South Pacific Games in Samoa.

He improved further as a senior in 2010\u201311 as he earned the Pacific West Player of the Year award and finished his four-year career at BYU\u2013Hawaii with a school-record of 245 steals.
