    "text": "Fat City is the debut album on the Sons of Champlin, formerly known as the Opposite Six released in 1967 on Trident Productions. The Sons of Champlin were a more strait-laced rock band who did many recordings from 1966 to 1967. It is very concise in structure and effort than their later looser psychedelic-based material they released in the late 1960s. ==Background== In 1965, the Sons of Champlin were a garage band but forceful band. After re- investing earnings from a Kingston trio's success into a small domain of properties and music-related corporations in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of which became known as Trident Productions, Frank Werber signed the Sons of Champlin in 1966 hoping they would be a promising success. Werber sent the band into Trident's own Columbus Recorders with crew producer Randy Steirling in late 1966 to conditionally work on a full album via a lease deal with MGM Verve. Due to a variety of difficulties, it never happened and the Sons left Trident with antipathy in June 1967. The split resulted in only two songs on Fat City that were previously released which were Sing Me a Rainbow and Fat City, which they still perform today. The remaining 18 tracks are covers of other artist tracks. ==Track listing== # \"Sing Me a Rainbow\" (3:22) # \"She Said\" (2:39) # \"Don't Talk to Strangers\" (2:33) # \"1,000 Miles from Nowhere\" (2:52) # \"One of These Days\" (2:41) # \"I Wouldn't Put It Past You\" (3:03) # \"It's Gonna Rain\" (2:25) # \"Fat City\" (3:45) # \"To Me\" (3:46) # \"Green Monday\" (2:36) # \"Don't Stop\" (1:58) # \"Little Fugue\" (1:54) # \"Shades of Grey\" (3:47) # \"Say You Know\" (2:44) # \"I Wish You Could Be Here\" (2:50) # \"One of These Days\" (2:10) # \"It's the End\" (2:55) # \"Pillow\" (2:52) # \"Don't Stop\" (1:59) # \"KCPX Radio Spots\" (0:51) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1967 debut albums Category:The Sons of Champlin albums ",
