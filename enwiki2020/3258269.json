    "text": "The station in 1960 Lynton and Lynmouth railway station was the terminus of the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway, a narrow gauge line that ran through Exmoor from Barnstaple to Lynton and Lynmouth in North Devon, England. The station served the twin towns of Lynton (on the top of the cliffs) and Lynmouth (on the shoreline below). ==History== It opened with the line on 11 May 1898. Originally providing accommodation for the stationmaster and his family, the station building was substantially updated under Southern ownership, including removal of the chimney stacks. A separate house was built for the stationmaster on the rising ground to the West of the main line, and rail access to the engine shed was reversed at around the same time. The water supply was very poor in this location often causing the toilets and water tower for the locomotives to be closed. Due to this trains often stopped at Parracombe Halt to fill the water tanks of the engine. From 1923 the line was operated by the Southern Railway.L T Catchpole: The Lynton & Barnstaple Railway 1895-1935 published by The Oakwood Press. Eighth edition 2005. . It closed on 29 September 1935. Now within the Exmoor national park, the station building has become a private residence, the former goods shed has been divided into two cottages, and a number of private residences have been built close to the trackbed on the approaches to the former station. The rebuilt L&BR; is planned to terminate at a new station closer to Lynton.
