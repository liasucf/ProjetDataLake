    "text": "The Complete Wooden Nickel Recordings is a 2-Disc set released by Styx in 2005. The compilation contains remastered versions of Styx's first four albums, Styx, Styx II, The Serpent Is Rising, and Man of Miracles, which were released by Wooden Nickel Records. It also includes \"Unfinished Song\", which was previously released as the B-side to the single \"Best Thing\" and on the 1980 RCA reissue of Man of Miracles (which was entitled Miracles). The four albums contained in this compilation (plus Styx's fifth album, Equinox) were recorded with original singer/songwriter/guitarist John Curulewski and feature a harder, eclectic, and more progressive sound when compared to subsequent albums that included Curulewski's replacement, singer/songwriter/guitarist Tommy Shaw. ==Track listing== ===Disc one=== #\"Movement for the Common Man\" \u2013 13:11 #*\"Children of the Land\" (James Young) #*\"Street Collage\" (John Ryan) #*\"Fanfare for the Common Man\" (Aaron Copland) #*\"Mother Nature's Matinee\" (J.
