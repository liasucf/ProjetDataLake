While overseeing Guantanamo, he blocked attempts to get a commander of the camp reprimanded over abuse claims. Craddock insisted that the officer had done nothing wrong. On January 28, 2009, Der Spiegel reported obtaining a classified NATO document in which Craddock ordered troops to kill drug traffickers and bomb narcotics laboratories in Afghanistan, even if there is no evidence that they are involved in terrorist activities. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates' book Duty is very critical of Craddock in his role as Supreme Allied Commander Europe. Gates cites examples where Craddock did not want fellow U.S. Army generals, such as Stanley A. McChrystal, to attend coalition meetings with partner nations. At one point Craddock provided his unsolicited advice to Gates regarding who he thought should attend a senior coalition meeting. Gates then had to order Craddock to carry out the mission as instructed by him. In the book, Gates goes on to opine that was the only time in his career in governmental service in which he had to \"order\" a general officer to carry out a specific task. ==Awards and decorations== {| |100px |Office of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge |- |100px |Joint Chiefs of Staff Badge |- |80px |SACEUR Badge |- |70px |24th Infantry Division Combat Service Identification Badge |- |60px |64th Armor Regiment Distinctive Unit Insignia |} {| | |Defense Distinguished Service Medal with 1 Oak Leaf Cluster |- | |Army Distinguished Service Medal |- | |Silver Star Medal |- | |Defense Superior Service Medal with 1 Oak Leaf Cluster |- | |Legion of Merit with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters |- | |Bronze Star |- | |Meritorious Service Medal with 3 Oak Leaf Clusters |- | |Army Commendation Medal with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters |- | |Army Achievement Medal |- | |Joint Meritorious Unit Award with 3 Oak Leaf Clusters |- | |Valorous Unit Award |- | |National Defense Service Medal (with two bronze service stars) |- | |Southwest Asia Service Medal (with two bronze service stars) |- | |Kosovo Campaign Medal (with two bronze service stars) |- | |Global War on Terrorism Service Medal |- | |Army Service Ribbon |- |20px |Overseas Service Ribbon (with award numeral 5) |- | |NATO Meritorious Service Medal |- | |NATO Medal for Yugoslavia with bronze service star |- | |Bundeswehr Gold Cross of Honor |- | |El Salvador Gold Medal for Distinguished Services |- | |Cross of Military Merit, First Class (Guatemala) |- |106px |Nicaraguan decoration (Unidentified) |- | |Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland |- | |Estonian Order of the Cross of the Eagle First Class |- |106px |Canadian Meritorious Service Cross (Military Division)http://canadagazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2010/2010-03-27/pdf/g1-14413.pdf |- | |Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia) |- | |Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait) |} Additionally, Craddock has been honored of the following associations: *United States Armor Association \u2014 Order of Saint George *National Infantry Association \u2014 Order of Saint Maurice (United States) Legionnaire * Ordnance Association \u2014 Order of Samuel Sharpe, Honorary Kentucky Colonel * Honorary Texan, Artillery Association \u2014 Order of Saint Barbara ==Personal life== A bridge in Doddridge County, West Virginia on U.S. Route 50 was dedicated to Craddock in 2006. ==See also== ==References== * ==External links== *Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe *United States European Command Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:United States Army generals Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (US Army) Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Recipients of the NATO Meritorious Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Badge of Honour of the Bundeswehr Category:Commanders of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Category:West Virginia University alumni Category:American people of Welsh descent Category:United States Army Command and General Staff College alumni Category:Military personnel from West Virginia Category:People from Doddridge County, West Virginia Category:Recipients of the Order of Saint Maurice Category:Recipients of the Defense Superior Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Defense Distinguished Service Medal Category:Recipients of the Military Order of the Cross of the Eagle, Class I Category:NATO Supreme Allied Commanders Category:People from Parkersburg, West Virginia Category:Recipients of the Meritorious Service Medal (United States) ",
