    "text": "The 2019\u201320 EFL League One (referred to as the Sky Bet League One for sponsorship reasons) was the 16th season of Football League One under its current title and the 28th season under its current league division format. Newly promoted Bury were expelled from the EFL on 27 August 2019, due to financial issues at the club. They could not satisfy the requirements of their notice of withdrawal issued by the EFL for this deadline date. The league operated with 23 teams for 2019\u201320, with three teams being relegated to League Two for the 2020\u201321 season, rather than the usual four. Bury did not fulfil any of their league fixtures for the season, as they were all postponed, so no results were expunged. Financially troubled Bolton Wanderers entered administration and had been threatened with expulsion but were saved in a buy- out on 28 August. Bolton failed to fulfil their fixture against Doncaster Rovers on 20 August. They called off the game 26 hours before kick off without informing the EFL nor Doncaster, claiming concerns over younger players' welfare.https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/sport/17847196.efl-doncaster-unhappy- bolton-postpone-tuesday-match/ On 21 November, they were issued with a five- point deduction suspended for 18 months in relation to the Doncaster postponement, as well as a postponement in the 2018\u201319 season against Brentford in the Championship. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the season was temporarily suspended on 13 March. On 3 April 2020, this suspension was extended indefinitely. On 9 June, clubs voted to curtail the season, meaning the final table would be calculated by a points-per-game method with the play-offs being played behind closed doors. ==Team changes== The following teams have changed division since the 2018\u201319 season. ==Stadiums== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
