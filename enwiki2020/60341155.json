In his review for The Atlantic, David Sims praised the satirical nature of the show, writing that the show's \"creators have long prided themselves on staying ahead of tech trends via thorough research, and this new season seems more on point than ever\". Dan Einav of Financial Times gave the season a mostly positive review, writing that it was \"still one of the best [comedies] on TV, even without the brilliantly coarse TJ Miller\". Still, other critics felt Miller's absence, and noticed the repetitiveness of the series. Chuck Barney, writing for the San Jose Mercury News, noted \"Miller and his contributions as the dimwitted, weed-smoking tech investor Erlich Bachman are undeniably missed\". Likewise, Refinery29s Ariana Romero expressed disappointment that Miller's departure had not improved \"its very noticeable, and unnecessary, lack of women on screen\". == Home media == The fifth season was released on DVD only (no Blu-ray) on September 4, 2018. == References == == External links == * * Category:2018 American television seasons Category:Silicon Valley (TV series) ",
