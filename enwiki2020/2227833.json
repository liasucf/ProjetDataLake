    "text": "Vavoua International School (VIS) was a boarding school operated by WEC International located east of the town of Vavoua on the road to Zu\u00e9noula. It was closed in 2002 due to political unrest in Ivory Coast. ==History== Founded in 1970, the school offered excellent educational opportunities for many missionary kids (MKs) and other children from a wide variety of countries. While VIS's official language was English, students at VIS were offered correspondence classes in Dutch, German, and Korean as well as a variety of international curricula. Most VIS students were from East Asia, Africa, Europe, North America or the Pacific, and have remained in contact since the closing of the school. The VIS student body is credited with several important inventions, including Christmas bamboo trees and poultry security testing. ==See also== * Christianity in Ivory Coast * Education in Ivory Coast * List of boarding schools == External links == * www.wec-int.org/vis latest information Category:1970 establishments in Ivory Coast Category:Buildings and structures in Sassandra-Marahou\u00e9 District Category:Co-educational boarding schools Category:Christian schools in Africa Category:Defunct schools in Ivory Coast Category:Educational institutions established in 1970 Category:International high schools Category:International schools in Ivory Coast Category:Haut-Sassandra Category:Organizations with year of disestablishment missing Category:Religious schools in Ivory Coast ",
