    "text": "The castle, Bailieboro Castle Lake loop is a hiking route in Ireland whose length is 3 kilometres. It is situated in Bailieborough, a small town in County Cavan. It is visited by many tourists every year and who walk the loop around Castle Lake and into Castle Lake Forest. Anglers also use to go there if they want to fish. The route begins and ends at the car park on the lakeshore and it can be done by bicycle or only walking. It goes through the tombs of the Marist brothers who occupied Bailieborough Castle for a time before the castle's eventual demolition. The builder of that castle was William Bailie, a Scottish undertaker, who was granted the lands of Tandragee in east Breffni by King James I. He built the castle and enclosed the demesne by 1629. ==References== \"Castles of Ireland - County Cavan\". rootsweb.ancestry.com.
