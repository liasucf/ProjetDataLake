    "text": "Allen and Ginter was a Richmond, Virginia, tobacco manufacturing company formed by John Allen and Lewis Ginter in 1865. Allen & Ginter created and marketed the first cigarette cards for collecting and trading in the United States. Some of the notable cards in the series include baseball players Charles Comiskey, Cap Anson, and Jack Glasscock, as well as non-athletes like Buffalo Bill Cody. The company merged with four other tobacco manufacturers to form the American Tobacco Company in 1890. Since 2006, a revived version of the brand has been issued by Topps for a line of baseball cards. ==History== ===Tobacco manufacturing=== Engraving of the Allen & Ginter warehouses in Richmond, Virginia, from an 1886 promotional book Virginia Brights cigarette box by Allen & Ginter, c. 1888 The firm of Allen & Ginter was founded in 1865. In 1882 Allen retired, leaving Ginter, who retained the firm name despite taking on one John Pope as new partner. The first tobacco company to employ female labor, by 1886 they had 1,100 employees, predominantly girls, who rolled the cigarettes. The company offered a prize for the invention of a machine able to roll cigarettes (which until then had been hand-rolled). James Albert Bonsack won this prize with his 1880/81 invention. Because it was not completely reliable, all but one of the large tobacco manufacturers declined to buy the machine. James Buchanan Duke did buy this cigarette rolling machine in 1885 and used it to great success; by 1890 he had consolidated his four major competitors, including Allen & Ginter, and formed the American Tobacco Company.Pritcher, Lynn. \"More About Tobacco Advertising and the Tobacco Collections.\" Duke University Libraries. 24 January 2008. 10 April 2008. The \"Allen & Ginter Company\" was no more, but Lewis Ginter sat on the board of the American Tobacco Company. The cigarette brands of Allen & Ginter included Richmond Gems, Virginia Brights, Perfection, Dandies and Little Beauties. In 1890, Allen & Ginter, along with other companies of the United States (W. Duke & Sons, W.S. Kimball & Company, Kinney Tobacco, and Goodwin & Company) formed the American Tobacco Company, in an attempt to compete against British tobacco companies. ===Collectible cards=== In late 1880s, Allen & Ginter began to release cigarette card sets as promotional items for its cigarette brands.
