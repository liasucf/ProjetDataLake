    "text": "WFOT 89.5 MHz \"Annunciation Radio\" is a Catholic radio station licensed to Lexington, Ohio and serving the Mansfield, Ashland and Mount Vernon areas of the northern Mid-Ohio region airing Catholic programming from EWTN Global Catholic Radio and Ave Maria Radio as a local repeater of originating station WNOC 89.7 MHz licensed in Bowling Green, Ohio with main studios located in Toledo, Ohio and locally serving the southeast corner of the Toledo Diocese and the Catholic parishes of the Ashland, Mansfield and Mount Vernon area WFOT can be heard on a typical car radio along I-71 between Delaware and New London and online ==Brief history== WFOT began in February 2007 as a near-simulcast of WVKO in Columbus from 2007 to 2011 and then WVSG in Columbus from 2011 until July 2013 when it was part of St. Gabriel Radio. St. Gabriel Radio began broadcasting in 2005 on the former WUCO (now WQTT) in Marysville, Ohio until 2010. Though WUCO was the first to air Catholic programming for the Columbus Diocese, this made WFOT the second such station in that diocese. ==WFOT transitions from St. Gabriel Radio to Annunciation Radio== In June 2013 Annunciation Radio purchased WFOT which on July 11, 2013 at 3:00 pm, programming transitioned from St. Gabriel Radio to Annunciation Radio. Sale and transfer of license of WFOT was granted by the FCC on June 24, 2013, thus making WFOT the fifth full-time Catholic station in the Toledo Diocese and the third station in Annunciation's regional network. ==Callsign history== The WFOT callsign was previously used briefly in 1989 at 93.7 FM in Atwood, Tennessee, the present day WTKB. The callsign was then granted to the Hellinger Foundation (and later to St. Gabriel Radio) on December 16, 2005 ==See also== * WNOC * WHRQ * WSHB ==External links== * Official Annunciation Radio site (with streaming audio) * * Additional information from REC Networks site FOT Category:Catholic radio stations FOT ",
