    "text": "The Overture & the Underscore is the 2004 (see 2004 in music) debut album by Australian singer-songwriter Sarah Blasko. == Background == \"Essentially I wanted there to be something really classic about the album\", says Blasko on her official website.Official website \"The kind of debut albums I like are those that don't try and do too much too soon, that point towards a number of possible directions, and that give the songs some room to move. It was really important to me that my voice and the songs had some character and that there was an intimacy to them. We tried to achieve this by using little or no effect on the voice and not going too far with overdubs.\" Triple J music director Richard Kingsmill rated it ninth on his list of favourite 2004 albums.
