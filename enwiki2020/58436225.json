He attended the Royal College of Strasbourg and enrolled voluntarily in the Army of the Rhine in 1793. In September 1794 he was transferred to the military engineering corps. Admitted to the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in the autumn of 1797, he moved in the spring of 1798 to the \u00c9cole du G\u00e9nie de Metz and graduated with the brevet of first lieutenant. It was at this time that he wrote about the integration of differential equations. In January 1801 he took part in the Egyptian Campaign of the French Army. On his return in 1801 he was assigned to the port of Toulon. Named captain of the sappers in December 1801, he became second in command of the headquarters of the corps of engineers in November 1802.

His mathematical work focused on the study of the changes of Cartesian coordinates applied to systems of planes and lines and the geometric representation of complex numbers based on original ideas of his uncle Louis Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Arbogast. They have been published for the most part in the Annales de Gergonne. After the death of his brother Fran\u00e7ois;in 1810, he published his treatise Recherches sur la pouss\u00e9e des terres (1817). == Publications == * M\u00e9moire sur le mouvement de rotation d\u2019un corps solide libre autour de son centre de masse, Paris, 1813 == Bibliography == Category:French campaign in Egypt and Syria Category:Geotechnical engineers Category:French military engineers Category:French mathematicians Category:1775 births Category:1833 deaths ",
