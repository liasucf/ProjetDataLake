Radical Routes is a UK-based secondary co-operative of housing co- ops, worker co-ops, and social centres committed to social change. The organisation supports new and established co-ops through loan finance, training workshops, practical support, and national gatherings. ==History== Radical Routes emerged in 1986 from a network of people in London and Hull who wanted to develop workers' co-operatives. The network agreed it's common aims and adopted the name Radical Routes in 1988, and became incorporated as Radical Routes Limited in 1992. In 1998 Rootstock Limited was incorporated as an investment scheme supporting Radical Routes co-operatives. The original house in Hockley was set up as the 'New Education Housing Co-op'. According to Rootstock, between 1991 and 2012 Radical Routes made over sixty loans to member co-ops \u2013 totaling over \u00a31m \u2013 with no co-operatives defaulting on loan payments. These loans have typically been used by member housing co-ops, in addition to finance from traditional lenders, to buy property. ==Work== Radical Routes provides small loans (up to about \u00a350,000) to member co- operatives. Decisions on making loans are made collectively by other member co-operatives, this has been described as \"peer-group loan appraisal\". Radical Routes publishes booklets on subjects such as How to set up a Housing Co- operative and How to set up a Worker Co-operative. With Cooperatives UK they launched proposals for an independent co-operative regulator after the government announced that it would be abolishing the FSA. Previously the FSA had regulated co-operatives, which were registered as industrial and provident societies. Radical Routes is developing a \u2018co-op cluster\u2019 model for co-op housing with groups of housing co-ops combining their assets to buy new properties outright, eliminating mortgage interest. ==Membership== Member co- operatives are expected to commit to a share of Radical Routes' workload as volunteers, and work toward radical social change. The organisation has about 40 members, consisting primarily of small housing co-ops, alongside some worker co-ops and social centres. The organisation also has a number of supporting associates. ===Housing co-operatives=== * 151 Housing Co-operative, Newcastle upon Tyne *Anarres, Bristol *Bruadair, Edinburgh *Catfish, Huddersfield *Clideside, Glasgow *Cornerstone, Leeds *Coventry Peace House * Dragonfly, Oxford *Equinox, Manchester *Federici, Birmingham *Golem, Swansea *Gung Ho, Birmingham *Heartwell, South Devon *Highbury Farm, Monmouth *The Hive, Bradford *Kindling, Oxford *Mary Ann Johnson, Haringey *Neds, Nottingham *Nutclough, Hebden Bridge *Out of Town, Brighton *Plan B, Manchester *Random Camel, Ipswich *Redcurrant, Edinburgh *Rockdove Rising, Manchester *Rose Howey, Liverpool *Share Instead, Sheffield *Skylark, Brighton *Talamh, South Lanarkshire *Walden Pond, St Leonards-on-Sea *Wild Peak, Derbyshire *Xanadu, Leeds *Yellow Brick Road, Worthing ===Worker co-operatives=== *Birmingham Bike Foundry *Catalyst Collective *Footprint Workers Co-op, Leeds *Secure Active ===Social centres=== * Cowley Club, Brighton ==Affiliations== Radical Routes is a affiliated to a social investment scheme called Rootstock, through which Radical Routes co-operatives can secure finance.
