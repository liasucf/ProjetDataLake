Chalcis is one of the five Aetolian towns spoken of by Homer, who gives it the epithet of \u1f00\u03b3\u03c7\u03af\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (anchialos, \"near the coast\"), in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad. It continued to be mentioned in the historical period, by Thucydides, Polybius, and Strabo. Its site is identified as near the modern Kato Vasiliki. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Aetolia Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Locations in the Iliad ",
