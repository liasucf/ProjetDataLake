    "text": "L'Assiette au Beurre (literally The Butter Plate, and roughly translating to the English expression pork barrel) was an illustrated French weekly satirical magazine with anarchist political leanings that was chiefly produced between 1901 and 1912. It was revived as a monthly for a time and ceased production in 1936. The magazine's caricature and editorial cartoon content was drawn from a varied cadre of illustrator-contributors of many backgrounds and disparite artistic styles. The content often focused on socialist and anarchist ideas. The first series expired on 15 October 1912. A second series was published between 1921 and 1925 on a monthly basis, eventually becoming a single supplement. At the time of its founding near the start of the twentieth century, France was divided on crucial issues such as the extension of military service, revanchism (the call of French nationalists to avenge and reclaim from Germany the annexed territories of Alsace-Lorraine), right of association, separation of church and state, freedom of speech, and the emergence of new and radical political and social ideas in France such as revolutionary syndicalism, antimilitarism, anti-clericalism, Proletarian internationalism, feminism and the rise of labour law, which were all subjects of feature in the magazine. L'Assiette au Beurre is a valuable iconographic testament of the Belle \u00c9poque (\"Beautiful Era\") period in France, characterized by optimism, peace at home and in Europe, new technology and scientific discoveries. Georges Wolinski (killed in the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo), indicated in 2011 that his magazine's work was the legacy of L'Assiette au Beurre. ==Description== From its first appearance, L'Assiette au Beurre registered as a departure in form from other French humor publications. Each issue was made up of chiefly two- or three-color-inked cartoons and caricatures, given full- or sometimes double-page placement (instead of the more common quarter page real estate granted to such content in related French publications), with each installment containing a minimum of 16 illustrated pages. Special editions held up to 48 pages. Images were published from original drawings using a zincography, planographic printing process. Periodically, a single artist was chosen for an issue to provide a variety of panels on a specific topic, making that issue a veritable collected album for that illustrator. Sometimes a team was employed as well. According to Kevin C. Robbins in Roving Anarchists Fl\u00e2neurs: The Visual Politics of Popular Protest via Parisian Street Art in L'Assiette au beurre (1900-1914), \"For the most sardonic of multi-media exploits, Assiette staff paired artists with noted, left-wing essayists, poets, or novelists who provided suggestions for timely or provocative captions for each image submitted.\" ==History== ===Founding=== Cover of L'Assiette au Beurre no. 88 (6 December 1902), composed by Benjamin Rabier. B\u00eates et gens translates to \"man and beast\". Samuel Sigismond Schwarz was the magazine's founder and director. Schwarz was a Jewish immigrant to France from Hungary, becoming a French naturalized citizen. After arriving in Paris in 1878, Schwarz became a book broker, specializing in the work of Victor Hugo through association with Paul Meurice. He later managed and was the editor of Le Frou Frou (1900-1923), another French humorist periodical that famously featured Picasso sketches, as well as Le Tutu and Le Pompon \u2014 magazines also in the humorist vein and known to have had anti-Dreyfusard leanings. Sigismund established a presence in 1895 at 9 rue Sainte-Anne in Paris as an editor of serial novels and later opened a retail space on behalf of Librairie Schwarz, located at 58 Rue de la Chauss\u00e9e-d'Antin. He launched the first issue of L'Assiette au Beurre on 4 April 1901, priced at 25 centimes; it did not have a specific theme, which later editions often did. The front cover illustration titled \"Caisse de gr\u00e8ve\" (\"Strike Fund\") was by Th\u00e9ophile Steinlen and referred to the labour movement in the communes of Montceau-les-Mines and the involvement of Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau, among other Interior Ministers. Other illustrations appearing in the first edition include one by Adolphe Willette depicting the signing of an illustrated letter that plays on the idiomatic meaning of \"L'Assiette au Beurre\" \u2013 to lines one pockets. This was followed by a Jean Veber drawing occupying two pages, and then by works by Charles L\u00e9andre, Gustave-Henri Jossot, Steinlein, Jacques Villon, Charles Huard, Hermann Vogel, Pierre-Georges Jeanniot, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Franti\u0161ek Kupka, Auguste Roubille and finally by a Hermann-Paul drawing. Although there was little accompanying text, and no clear anarchist theme to the content, the first issue's tone is fiercely satirical and disrespectful of institutions and the affluent; a trend that increased in later editions. At inception, L'Assiette au Beurre contained no advertising in its body, but was circulated with a 4-page insert, showcasing Sigismund periodicals and literary productions, as well as editions of classic books, to be purchased directly or through a subscription. ===Developments=== Starting with the fourth issue's cover, the graphic presentation was changed to emulate that of a newspaper. Such typographical variation was quite unusual in the media of the day, though Cocorico had previously paved the way by giving their designers freedom to innovate in the manner. Issue no. 14 was the first to take up a theme, conveyed by its title: \"La guerre\" (\"War\"). It was illustrated with 14 lithographs signed by Hermann Paul. n\u00b0 14, 4 July 1901 The first special edition of the magazine, released in February 1902, sold for 1 franc and was headlined and took up the theme of \"empoisonneurs patent\u00e9s\" (\"Patented Poisoners\" \u2013 referring to a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the France of the time that regarded the practice of tainting milk by adding filler, such as impure water, to increase profits). J\u00falio Tom\u00e1s Leal da C\u00e2mara, a Portuguese painter and cartoonist who was famous in the Paris of the Belle Epoque, produced the cover, and the issue lambasted the industry for its tainted milk and other industrial food practices that were a fraud on the public. In December 1903, the paper starts printing a \"false\" cover without images, to guard against censorship, and at the same time to offer advertisements on the back cover. One of the more unusual issues artistically and in format was no. 48, entitled \"Crimes et ch\u00e2timents\" (\"Crime and Punishment\"). Published on 1 March 1902, and composed by F\u00e9lix Vallotton, it consists of 23 lithographs printed only on the front and perforated to make each etching detachable, thus rendering it a true album of prints. The selling price was increased to 50 centimes. The format was never repeated, making it a unique feature in the magazine's run. The first issues sold between 25,000 and 40,000 copies and garnered a profit. In 1902, Sigismund recorded sales approaching 250,000 copies. However, at the end of that year, the publication experienced its first failure linked to poor sales of some of its other titles but managed to recapitalize its newspaper group.Gabriele Galantara (18 November 1905). In October 1903, at a time when business in general appeared to be going wrong for Sigismund, he passed management of the magazine over to a certain \"de Boulay\". The quality of the content held up under his stewardship, as did its sales. In August 1904, management was taken over by Charles Bracquart, followed by one E. Victor. The magazine's printing was moved to a more modern location at 62 rue de Provence \u2013 the offices of the established art magazine L\u2019\u00c9preuve, administered since at least 1903 by Andr\u00e9 Jonci\u00e8res, the heir to a large fortune. In January 1905, the management weekly was taken over by Jonci\u00e8res, who remained in control until October 1912. Jonci\u00e8res introduced advertising and derivative products (post cards, almanacs, calendars, etc.). The magazine's last address was 51 rue du Rocher. The penultimate issue (593) should never have appeared and had the ultimate theme \"Les Vieilles Filles\" (\"Old Girls\").Notice sur Gallica, en ligne. Between 1907 and 1912 Jonci\u00e8res broadened the magazine's appeal abroad by incorporating material about organizations such as the Second International, the CGT and various European socialist parties; the printing of Franco-German and Franco-English special issues, with bilingual captions; inviting outside cartoonists to contribute; and by coverage of significant socio-political events, such as the great French general strike of September 1911. ==Decline of the series (1910-1912)== L'Assiette au Beurre is a periodical demanding an artistic point of view, and its production cost was significant from the outset. From 1910-1911, the production values suffered due to financial troubles. Jonci\u00e8res subsidized the magazine with his fortune in an attempt to keep the price to 50 centimes. The last issue of the first series, no. 594, came out on 12 October 1912. The first series comprised 593 numbers, excluding special issues. Jonci\u00e8res died in August 1920. Georges Anquetil revived L'Assiette au Beurre on 20 November 1921 in a monthly edition. From October 1925 to January 1927, the white Blackbird makes its literary supplement. Subsequently, editions were more scarce until 1936 where the title disappears officially, although between 1943 and 1944 some reprisal editions were published containing content from the first series. ==First series illustrators== L'Assiette au Beurre was primarily a work of illustrators; more than 9,600 discrete drawing were produced. * Jack Abeill\u00e9 * Adaramakaro * Andrisek * Apa * Aroun-al-Rachid * Gil Baer * Paul Balluriau * Emmanuel Barcet * Jacques Baseilhac * \u00c9mile Bayard * Bellery-Desfontaines * Ren\u00e9 Berger * \u00c9douard Bernard * Henry Bing * Otto Bleistift * Paul Bour * Henri Boutet * L\u00e9opold Braun * Zyg Brunner [Zyg] * Georges Bruyer * L\u00e9once Burret * Eug\u00e8ne Cadel * Camara (Tom\u00e1s Leal da C\u00e2mara) * Leonetto Cappiello * Caran d'Ache * Andr\u00e9 Cahard * Charles \u00c9mile Egli * Georges Carr\u00e9 * \u00c9douard Carrier * Carsten Ravn * Chanteclair (Lucien \u00c9mery) * Jules Ch\u00e9ret * A.

At least in its early stages the magazine maintained a focus on political issues through its drawings, sometimes anti- semitic (in 1902, Judaism was skewered) and often anti-freemasonryL'assiette au Beurre: \"Les francs-ma\u00e7ons\"; assietteaubeurre.org, online. and anti- imperialism.\"L'Alg\u00e9rie aux Alg\u00e9riens\"; issue of 9 May 1903. The plutocracy was systematically attacked. L'Assiette au Beurre employed more than two hundred artists of an international character. Social issues, often taboo, were also included, such as the death penalty, trafficking of children, sexuality, or even of the themes of daily life such as \"L'argent\" (\"money\"), \"Le gaz\" (gas\"), \"La police [et ses exc\u00e8s]\" (the police and their excesses]), \"L'alcool\" (\"alcohol\"), \"Paris la nuit\" (\"Paris by night\"), and many others. ==List of theme issues== * No. 26: \"Les camps de reconcentration du Transvaal\" (\"Concentration Camps in the South African Republic\"), by Jean Veber, 1901. * No. 30: \"La prostitution\" (\"Prostitution\"), by Kees van Dongen, 26 October 1901. * No. 41: \"L'argent\" (\"Money\"), by Kupka, 11 January 1902. * No. 42: \"Les tueurs de la route\" (\"The Road Killers\"), by Weiluc, 18 January 1902. * No. 48: \"Crimes et ch\u00e2timents\" (\"Crime and Punishment\")\", by F\u00e9lix Vallotton, 1 March 1902. * No. 88: \"B\u00eates et gens\" (\"Man and Beast\"), by Benjamin Rabier, 6 d\u00e9cembre 1902. * No. 101: \"Les Acad\u00e9misables\", by Camara, 7 March 1903. * No. 108: \"Esth\u00e8tes\" (\"Aesthetes\"), by Paul Iribe, 25 avril 1903. * No. 110: \"Colonisons !

The price base was revised upward in May 1901 (30 cents per regular issue) and in 1905 again to 50 centimes, after Sigismund withdrew. The price iwas judged too high by some, including Jules Grandjouan, who ultimately wrote to Jonci\u00e8res about the issue. In February 1906, Senator Ren\u00e9 B\u00e9renger, nicknamed \" P\u00e8re la Pudeur\" (\"Father Modesty\") championed a bill focused on child prostitution: under this pretext, he sought to censor what was deemed pornographic and obscene. With its legality uncertain, the in April 1908 the Chambre des d\u00e9put\u00e9s (Chamber of Deputies), placed the sale of L'Assiette au Beurre under threat of police sanction. A sales ban was instituted in railway stations (to \"prot\u00e9ger les yeux chastes de certains publics\" (\"protect the chaste eyes of the public\"), while some of its composers were even arrested (e.g. Jules Grandjouan) and spent a few days in prison. ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:1901 establishments in France Category:1936 disestablishments in France Category:Defunct political magazines published in France Category:Anarchist periodicals published in France Category:French-language magazines Category:Monthly magazines published in France Category:Weekly magazines published in France Category:Magazines established in 1901 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1936 Category:Magazines published in Paris ",
