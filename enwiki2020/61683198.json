His name comes from the Sanskrit word meaning \u201cocean.\u201d ==Character== S\u0101gara is listed among the Eight N\u0101ga Kings and is one of sixteen that are spared from the assault of the garudas. His frequent inclusion of S\u0101gara among the several groups of protective deities in Buddhism is a direct reference to the n\u0101gas and his role as one of their primary leaders. He is listed among the 28 guardians of the thousand-armed Avalokite\u015bvara. The Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra reveals that he is the n\u0101ga that presides over the world's supply of rain. In East Asian art, he is often depicted with a reddish white complexion and assumes a posture of great authority. In his left hand he holds a snake or dragon and in his right hand he wields a sword. He wears a crown that consists of five snakes. ===Undersea Palace=== S\u0101gara's palace lays at the bottom of the ocean and is the setting of several Mahayana sutras. It is 84,000 yojanas in length and width with an array of decorations that are seven-fold, including walls, banisters, jeweled nets and seven rows of trees. The palace is adorned with the seven treasures and is filled with the song of innumerable birds. ==Literature== King S\u0101gara appears extensively throughout the Buddhist canon. His name often appears in enumerations of dragon kings that appear among \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha's audience. On other occasions, he is a central figure who participates in conversation with the Buddha and bodhisattvas and elucidates matters in the realm of the n\u0101gas. ===Lotus Sutra=== Chapter 12 of the Lotus Sutra contains the well-known episode of S\u0101gara's daughter, known simply as n\u0101gakanya (\"n\u0101ga maiden\"), whose transformation allows her to procure the male body of a bodhisattva, followed by becoming a fully enlightened Buddha. This event was preceded by Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b's visit to S\u0101gara's ocean palace, where he taught the Lotus Sutra to the n\u0101gas. ===Lalitavistara S\u016btra=== S\u0101gara makes a few appearances in the Lalitavistara S\u016btra. He is one among six n\u0101ga kings who make the aspiration to venerate the bodhisattva Siddh\u0101rtha with clouds and rain of sandalwood powder. When Siddh\u0101rtha discarded the golden bowl provided by Suj\u0101t\u0101, S\u0101gara took it from the bottom of the Naira\u00f1jan\u0101 River and later gave it to \u015aakra to be enshrined among the gods in Tr\u0101yastri\u1e43\u015ba. Towards the end of the story, the Buddha is described as having a rumbling voice like that of one of S\u0101gara's thunderclouds. ===Sutra on the Questions of the N\u0101ga King S\u0101gara=== Three extant versions of this sutra exist in both the Tibetan Kangyur and the Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka (T0598, T0599 and T0601). Known in Sanskrit as the S\u0101garan\u0101gar\u0101japarip\u1e5bcch\u0101 S\u016btra, all three texts are vastly different from each other regarding their content. The shortest text opens with the Buddha residing in S\u0101gara's ocean palace accompanied by an audience of 1,250 monks. The Buddha addresses S\u0101gara and teaches him that speaking the Four Dharma Seals is synonymous with speaking the 84,000 methods of teaching the Dharma. ==See also== *Nagaraja *Longn\u00fc ==References== Category:Buddhist gods Category:N\u0101gas Category:Rain deities ",
