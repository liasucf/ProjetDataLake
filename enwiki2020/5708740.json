    "text": "The Adventures of Superboy is a proposed TV series that was put into production in 1961. It was meant to capitalize on the success of Adventures of Superman, which went out of production in 1958. Only a pilot episode (\"Rajah's Ransom\") was produced, although 12 additional scripts had been prepared, had the series been picked up. It featured the first non-comic book portrayals ever of Superboy and Lana Lang and stands as a forerunner of later series Superboy, which lasted four seasons and Smallville, which lasted ten seasons. ==Cast== *Johnny Rockwell as Superboy/Kal-El/Clark Kent *Bunny Henning as Lana Lang *Monty Margetts as Martha Kent ===Guest cast=== *Ross Elliot as Fred Drake *Charles Maxwell as Gunner Ferde *Robert Williams as Chief Parker *Richard Reeves as Shorty Barnes *Yvonne White as Miss Gibbs *Stacy Harris as Jake Ferde *Jimmy Bates as Jimmie Drake *Ray Walker as Mr. Edlund *True Ellison as Donna ==Video and DVD releases== The only stand-alone releases so far for The Adventures of Superboy have been from specialty distributors, such as Video Rarities, which released it on VHS along with The Adventures of Superpup and screen test footage as Superboy and Superpup: The Lost Pilots.
