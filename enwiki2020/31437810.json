The station allowed spectators direct access to the arena for two events. The first was the 1993 UCI Track Cycling World Championships and the second speed skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics. The station has not been used since the Olympics, although it has never officially been decommissioned. The Norwegian National Rail Administration proposed in 2006 the re-opening the station in conjunction with larger events at the arena. ==Facilities== Officially Vikingskipet Station is part of Hamar Station and denoted track 42. The track is long and ends Vikingskipet. The section runs parallel to the R\u00f8ros Line, but unlike the mainline it is electrified.
