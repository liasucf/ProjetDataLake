Alton Brown is the publisher. Caroline Glickman is the managing editor. The newspaper uses articles from news services, such as the Associated Press, as well as former Media General-owned news organizations. The News & Advance added a new printing press in 2009, manufactured by KBA. Its last press was built in 1974, when the newspaper moved to its current building. Prior to 1974, the newspaper's headquarters were in downtown Lynchburg. == History == The News was founded in 1866, as a morning newspaper, while The Daily Advance was founded in 1880, as an evening newspaper. In 1888, future U. S. Senator Carter Glass bought The News. In 1893, he bought The Daily Advance and merged its business operations with The News, with news and opinion operations remaining separate. The Glass family continued to publish both papers (The News, every morning; The Daily Advance, weekday afternoons) until 1979, when the papers were purchased by Worrell Newspapers Inc., which began publishing a merged edition, The News & Daily Advance, on weekends and holidays, with separate volume and edition numbers. In 1986, separate delivery of the News and Daily Advance was ended, replaced by a seven-day morning paper, The News & Daily Advance. In 1991, \"Daily\" was dropped from the name and the paper assumed its current title. In 1995, Worrell sold The News & Advance to Media General, which sold most of its newspaper division to Berkshire Hathaway in 2012.Sale of The News & Advance complete == Sections == ===Front and local=== The News & Advance covers local news of interest to Lynchburg and its surrounding counties, a combined metropolitan area of approximately 225,000 people.
