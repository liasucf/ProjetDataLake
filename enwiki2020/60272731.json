    "text": "The 2019 Gaza economic protests, dubbed as We Want to Live protests, began on February, initiating with the popular call \"We want to live\" by a group of politically unaffiliated media activists. The group has been nicknamed the 14th March movement. The protests aim at high costs of living and tax hikes in the Gaza Strip. The protests were met with violence by the ruling Hamas, which dispatched security forces to disperse protesters. Several human rights organisations and political factions have denounced attacks on protesters by Hamas security forces. The protests were described as the most severe anti- regime protests in Gaza since the Hamas takeover in 2007. ==See also== *Arab Spring *2011\u20132012 Palestinian protests ==References== Category:Protests in the Gaza Strip Gaza Strip Category:2019 protests Category:2019 in the Gaza Strip Category:Fatah\u2013Hamas conflict ",
