    "text": "Socrum is an unincorporated community in Polk County, in the U.S. state of Florida. ==History== A post office called Socrum was established in 1907, and remained in operation until 1918. According to tradition, the name is a contraction of \"soak 'em\", on account of the marshy town site. An alternate derivation is a conjunction of \"soak & rum\", as early settlers would keep barrels of rum both relatively cool and safe from native populations by immersing said barrels in \"Indian Lake\" - a small lake at 28\u00b0 09.89\" N, 82\u00b0 00.54\" W as part of modern-day Bethel Baptist Church near the corner of North Socrum Loop Road and North Campbell Road ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Polk County, Florida Category:Unincorporated communities in Florida ",
