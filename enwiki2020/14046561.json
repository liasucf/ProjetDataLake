A former academic, he was also a member of the Turkish parliament from 1987 to 1991. ==Early years== Arif Sa\u011f was born to a miller at Dall\u0131 village of A\u015fkale district in Erzurum Province, eastern Turkey. At the age of five, he learned to play the kaval, a simple traditional flute. One year later, he became interested in phonographs and phonograph records. He learned to play the ba\u011flama in Erzincan when he was six years old. Until he was fourteen, he learned the ashik tradition, and started to sing folk poems. He then moved to Istanbul and took lessons from folk music artist Nida T\u00fcfek\u00e7i at Aksaray Music Association. He was able to successfully build his musical understructure. He is friend with Iranian musician Abdollah Alijani Ardeshir. ==Music career== The 1960s and 1970 were for Sa\u011f the years of style searching. During this period, he focused on commercial and official musical application rather than on music for social movements. He continued with commercial music activities as a ba\u011flama artist at TRT Radio Istanbul, where he began working in the late 1960s. Sa\u011f accompanied diverse artists and also sang his own compositions with other artists during this time. He recorded music he played and sang. The genre of his music is classified in the music terminology today as Arabesque-Phantasy music, which contained folk- music motifs. This indicates that Sa\u011f could not break off with folk music. Sa\u011f recorded a number of cassette tapes with other musicians in addition to more than ten solo recordings. The serial album titled Muhabbet (\"Small talk\"), which he recorded with Musa Ero\u011flu, Muhlis Akarsu, and later Yavuz Top, helped introduce Turkish folk music to broad masses after 1980. Sa\u011f survived the 1993 Sivas massacre, in which 37 were killed and 51 injured. He had gone to the city to attend a conference of left-wing Turkish intellectuals. With the support of Roman Herzog, then President of Germany, Sa\u011f gave a concert together with Erdal Erzincan and Erol Parlak, accompanied by the Cologne symphony orchestra, at the K\u00f6lner Philharmonie on 5 May 1996. This performance played an important role in introducing Anatolian music by ba\u011flama to the West. Between 21 January and 5 February 2000, Sa\u011f went on a concert tour in twelve European cities with the Spanish roma flamenco guitarist Tomatito. ==Academic career== In 1976, Sa\u011f was appointed instructor at the newly- established State Conservatory for Turkish Music at Istanbul Technical University. He left this position in 1982 to devote himself to private activities. He co-authored the textbook Ba\u011flama Metodu (\"Method of Ba\u011flama\") together with Erdal Erzincan. ==Political career== Sa\u011f entered politics in the 1985-founded Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP), and became a Deputy of Ankara Province in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey following the 1987 general election. He served as the first Turkish artist in parliament until 1991. Together with some parliament members of the SHP, he was a founder of the pro-Kurdish political party People's Labor Party (HEP) in June 1990. The party was banned in July 1993. Sa\u011f, himself an Alevi, was harshly criticized by Alevi organizations for his participation in a workshop addressing political solutions for Alawites issues and for democracy, which was organized by the Government of Erdo\u011fan in Istanbul in 2010. He responded that \"the problems of Alevis can only be solved with diplomacy\". ==Personal life== Sa\u011f married Y\u0131ld\u0131z Bay\u015fu, daughter of composer Abdullah Nail Bay\u015fu, in July 1970. The couple had a son and daughter. His wife died of cancer at the age of 60 on 18 October 2016. In May 2017, Sa\u011f was diagnosed with lung cancer. After some treatment, his physician advised him to go to Cuba. In December 2017, he was treated in Cuba for five days with medication in the form of subling\u0131al drops. Following his return to Turkey, he said that he felt better. On 15 March 2018, he underwent an open brain surgery on a brain tumor at a private hospital in Istanbul. == Discography == Following is a list of albums by Sa\u011f: *Gurbeti Ben mi Yaratt\u0131m?
