Starting with only three flavors: vanilla, chocolate, and coffee, the company opened its first retail store in Brooklyn, New York, on November 15, 1976.See sign outside that first store, shown at :File:H\u00e4agen-Dazs' first shop.jpg. The business now has franchises throughout the United States and many other countries around the world including Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia, India, South Africa, China, Lebanon, New Zealand, Peru, Mexico and Brazil. The company also produces ice cream bars, ice cream cakes, sorbet, frozen yogurt, and gelato.

According to Mattus, it was a tribute to Denmark's exemplary treatment of its Jews during the Second World War, and included an outline map of Denmark on early labels. Mattus felt that Denmark was also known for its dairy products and had a positive image in the United States. His daughter Doris Hurley reported in the 1999 PBS documentary An Ice Cream Show that her father sat at the kitchen table for hours saying nonsensical words until he came up with a combination he liked. The reason he chose this method was so that the name would be unique and original. ===Conflict with Frusen Gl\u00e4dj\u00e9=== In 1980, H\u00e4agen-Dazs unsuccessfully sued Frusen Gl\u00e4dj\u00e9, an American ice cream maker founded that year, for using foreign branding strategies. The phrase frusen gl\u00e4dje--without the acute accent--is Swedish for \"frozen delight\". In 1985, Frusen Gl\u00e4dj\u00e9 was sold to Kraft General Foods. A Kraft spokeswoman stated that Kraft sold its Frusen Gl\u00e4dj\u00e9 license to the Unilever corporation in 1993, but a spokesman for Unilever claimed that Frusen Gl\u00e4dj\u00e9 was not part of the deal.'Whatever Happened To...Frusen Gladje? The Christian Science Monitor September 28, 2000 The brand has since disappeared. ===N\u00f6rgen Vaaz=== A similar brand of premium ice cream named N\u00f6rgen Vaaz has been marketed, principally in southeast Australia, since at latest the 1980s. H\u00e4agen-Dazs does not appear to have challenged the N\u00f6rgen Vaaz brand name, perhaps due to their lack of success against Frusen Gl\u00e4dj\u00e9. ==Products== H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream comes in several traditional flavors as well as several esoteric flavors that are specific to the brand, such as Vanilla Swiss Almond and Bananas Foster. It is marketed as a \"super-premium\" brand: it is quite dense (very little air is mixed in during manufacture), uses no emulsifiers or stabilizers other than egg yolks, and has a high butterfat content. It is sold both in grocery stores and in dedicated retail outlets serving ice cream cones, sundaes, and so on. Since 1992, most of the world's H\u00e4agen-Dazs products have been manufactured at a plant in Tilloy-l\u00e8s-Mofflaines, France that is now controlled by General Mills. In the United States and Canada, H\u00e4agen-Dazs is licensed to and produced by Nestl\u00e9 subsidiary Dreyer's. H\u00e4agen-Dazs entered the Japanese market in 1984 by forming a joint venture with Suntory and Takanashi Milk, which has produced their products there ever since. To offset increasing costs of their ingredients and the delivery of the product, H\u00e4agen- Dazs announced that, in January 2009, it would be reducing the size of their ice cream cartons in the US from to . In March 2009, they announced that they would be shrinking the container to . ==History== H\u00e4agen-Dazs' first store at 120 Montague Street, Brooklyn, New York H\u00e4agen-Dazs's founder Reuben Mattus was born in Poland in 1912 to Jewish parents. His father died during the First World War, and his widowed mother migrated to New York City with her two children in 1921. They joined an uncle who was in the Italian lemon-ice business in Brooklyn. By the late 1920s, the family began making ice pops, and by 1929, chocolate-covered ice cream bars and sandwiches under the name Senator Frozen Products on Southern Boulevard in the South Bronx, delivering them with a horse-drawn wagon to neighborhood stores in the Bronx.H\u00e4agen-Dazs' store in VivoCity, Singapore. The Senator Frozen Products company was profitable, but by the 1950s the large mass-producers of ice cream started a price war leading to his decision to make a heavy kind of high-end ice cream. In 1959, he decided to form a new ice cream company with what he thought to be a Danish-sounding name, H\u00e4agen-Dazs, a move known in the marketing industry as foreign branding. Rose Mattus would dress up in fancy clothing to distribute free samples, giving the ice cream an air of sophistication and class. The Pillsbury Company bought H\u00e4agen-Dazs in 1983. In 1999, Pillsbury and Nestl\u00e9 merged their U.S. and Canadian ice cream operations into a joint venture called Ice Cream Partners. General Mills, in turn, bought Pillsbury in 2001 and succeeded to its interest in the joint venture. That same year, Nestl\u00e9 exercised its contractual right to buy out General Mills' interest in Ice Cream Partners, which included the right to a 99-year license for the H\u00e4agen- Dazs brand, until 2100. Since then, pursuant to that license, the Dreyer's subsidiary of Nestl\u00e9 has produced and marketed H\u00e4agen-Dazs products in the United States and Canada. In December 2019, Nestl\u00e9 sold Dreyer's along with its rights in the H\u00e4agen-Dazs brand to Froneri, a joint venture set up by Nestl\u00e9 and PAI Partners in 2016. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Companies based in Oakland, California Category:General Mills brands Category:Ice cream brands Category:Ice cream parlors Category:Nestl\u00e9 brands Category:Restaurants established in 1976 Category:Food and drink companies established in 1960 Category:1960 establishments in New York (state) ",
