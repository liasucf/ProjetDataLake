    "text": "Johann Sebastiani (30 September 1622 - 1683) was a German baroque composer. Sebastiani was born in Weimar. He became Kantor at K\u00f6nigsberg cathedral in 1661, and court Kapellmeister from 1663 to 1679. He died in K\u00f6nigsberg. His works include sacred and occasional pieces and songs; the most famous is his St Matthew Passion (before 1663, performed again 1672). He is the first composer who introduce chorale into oratorio passion. Within the St Matthew Passion, Sebastiani includes eight different chorale melodies and introduces thirteen chorale verses.Duff, Robert Paul David, The Baroque Oratorio Passion: A Conductor\u2019s Guide to Compositional Techniques and Their Foundations, 2000 This work is a development from the style of Heinrich Sch\u00fctz which includes recitatives and arias but avoids a dramatic operatic idiom, and marks an intermediate position between Sch\u00fctz and Bach such as those of Johann Theile and Johann Valentin Meder.Stanley Anthony Malinowski, The Baroque oratorio passion: an edition of the St. Matthew passion of Johann Valentin Meder 1978 p146 Two violins accompany Christ, who is a bass; three viols accompany Evangelist, who is a tenor, Judas, who is an alto, and the other characters. In 1672 Sebastiani got married and from that point until the end of his life he was concerned primarily with the publication of his works. In 1672, he published a collection entitled Erster Theil Der Parna\u00df-Blumen, Oder Geist- und Weltliche Lieder.Duff, Robert Paul David, The Baroque Oratorio Passion: A Conductor\u2019s Guide to Compositional Techniques and Their Foundations, 2000 ==Recordings== * Matth\u00e4us-Passion 1672.
