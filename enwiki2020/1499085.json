    "text": "The Gregory Highway is a state highway in Queensland that serves the major coal-mining centres of Central Queensland.Queensland Government - Department of Transport and Main Roads - Maps The highway was named after Augustus Gregory, an early explorer. ==Route description== The highway runs southward from Quartz Blow Creek, a point 31 kilometres west of Mount Surprise on the Gulf Developmental Road, via Charters Towers, to Springsure, over 900 kilometres away. The northern section of 756 kilometres is designated by the state government as the Gregory Developmental Road. The shorter southern section between Clermont and Springsure (174 kilometres) is designated the Gregory Highway. As of 2015, the first 120 kilometres between the Gulf Developmental Road via Einasleigh to the Lynd Junction are unsealed and may be corrugated. The next section to Charters Towers has been upgraded from single lane to mostly dual-laned bitumen. The road is used by many road trains.
