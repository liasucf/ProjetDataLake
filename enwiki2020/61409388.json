The club has been involved in the decriminalisation of homosexuality in India. == History == The support group started from 23 January 2013, by Kapil. Kapil used his representation in his course group to inform more students and soon developed into a club to create a safer space for students belonging to sexual minority groups. IITs has a long history of support to queer groups, and have been involved with many LGBT support groups in India. According to a survey conducted in IIT Delhi in 2015, around 72% of the respondents \"believe homosexuality is as normal as heterosexuality\". == Involvement in Decriminalisation of Homosexuality in India == In May 2018, the club with support of Naz Foundation filed a petition to review Section 377. The petition was filed by a team of 20 IITians, the youngest of whom was an undergraduate student at IIT Delhi. In response of the petition, the Supreme Court agreed to review after the central government declared that it would not oppose the petitions, and would leave the case \"to the wisdom of the court\". On 6 September 2018, the Court overruled an earlier decision from 2013, thereby decriminalising homosexuality in India. After the verdict, the club gained an established recognition. ==Gallery== File:Indradhanu Tour of Stalls 2.jpg|Members of Indradhanu File:IITD Pride March 2.jpg|Indradhanu at the IIT- Delhi Pride March File:Pride Parade at IIT Delhi.jpg|Members with posters == See also == *IIT Delhi *LGBT rights in India * Navtej Singh Johar v.
