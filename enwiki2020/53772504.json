    "text": "Paul Flaherty (born November 6, 1948, Hartford, Connecticut) is an American jazz saxophonist who plays primarily in free improvisational idioms. Flaherty began playing saxophone at age 10, focusing initially on alto sax, though he would later perform on tenor and soprano saxophone as well. He worked in the bands of John Ciffirelli and Gordon Cohen in the early 1970s, but received negative responses to his style, and instead began self-releasing albums.Paul Flaherty, Allmusic His first album as a leader was issued in 1978, and in the 1980s he played jazz part-time, working as a house painter. He began what grew into a long-term musical partnership with Randall Colbourne in 1988, releasing a series of albums together that included guest musicians such as Chris Corsano, Richard Downs, Marc Edwards, Jim Hunt, Greg Kelley, Mike Murray, and Steve Scholz. ==Discography== ===As leader or co-leader=== * Impact with Randall Colbourne, Stephen Scholz (Cadence, 1990) * Primal Burn with Randall Colbourne, Richard Downs (Tulpa, 1991) * The Fourth Way with Randall Colbourne, Stephen Scholz, Richard Downs (Tulpa, 1992) * Cydonia with Randall Colbourne, Stephen Scholz, Mike Murray (Tulpa, 1993) * Fat Onions with Randall Colbourne (Cadence, 1994) * Visitants with Randall Colbourne (Zaabway, 1995) * Third Rail with Randall Colbourne, Richard Downs (Zaabway Music, 1996) * Resonance with Randall Colbourne, Daniel Carter, Raphe Malik, Sabir Mateen (Zaabway, 1997) * Anahad with Randall Colbourne (Cadence, 1999) * The Hated Music with Chris Corsano (Ecstatic Yod, 2000 * Prana with Randall Colbourne, Richard Downs (Zaabway, 2001) * The Ilya Tree with Greg Kelley, John Voigt, Laurence Cook (Boxholder, 2001) * Sannyasi with Greg Kelley, Chris Corsano (Wet Paint, 2002) * Voices (Wet Paint, 2003) * Steel Sleet (Tyyfus, 2005) * Kaivalya Vol. 1 with Marc Edwards (Cadence, 2005) * The Dim Bulb with Steve Baczkowski, Chris Corsano (Wet Paint, 2005) * Snow Blind Avalanche with Chris Corsano, C.
