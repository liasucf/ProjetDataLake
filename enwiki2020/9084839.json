Existing government airstrip is situated between the NH 27 and NH 330 at Sultanpur Naaka, Ayodhya, in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. The State Government signed a memorandum of understanding with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) in February 2014 for the development of the airport. ==Recent efforts== ===Efforts by Union Civil Aviation Minister=== Union Civil Aviation Minister Ajit Singh stated that there are three airstrips Faizabad, Moradabad and Meerut. He requested that give these airstrips to AAI and they will construct airports. The U.P. government does not want airports. Agra is an exception. Akhilesh does not want to give free land for airports, Ajit Singh said, adding that more airports would generate employment and spur growth in the state. If the Airports Authority of India got land for domestic airports in other eight cities and towns in U.P., it would have benefited the people of the state, the minister added. And after constant effort the airport has been haned over to AAI. ===Development under low-cost airports=== In an endeavour to provide air connectivity to different parts of India, development of low-cost airports is the most important component. Instructions have been issued to AAI to identify the most suitable low cost model for development of smaller airports and to develop airports in the smaller cities based on this mode. ===Handing over to Airports Authority of India=== Faizabad Airport is handed over by the government of Uttar Pradesh to Airports Authority of India (AAI) to be developed as full-fledged airport along with three others (Meerut, Moradabad and Saifai) by the approval of Uttar Pradesh cabinet. The government of Uttar Pradesh is providing extra land free of cost for the further expansion and for the construction of a terminal.

According to the government order, any private aircraft can land by paying Rs 500. There will be no parking charges for the first two hours, after which Rs 200 will be charged per day. The government is giving this airstrip to private investors for their pilot training and aircraft maintenance engineering institutes. \"The fresh government order for landing and parking is an extension of that project, because now the government will not have to bother much about activities like maintained, which will be taken care of by the institutes,\" said Swaroop. The procedure followed earlier to obtain permission for using the airstrip used to be long. The owner of the private aircraft had to contact the respective district magistrate who would further contact the directorate which would take the measures required for landing of the aircraft. ==Projected length== The state government has decided to acquire more than 280 acres of land around the airstrip and widen it to allow landing of bigger aircraft. Projected airstrip needs to have a width of 45 meters and a length of 2.5 km. ==References== Category:Airports in Uttar Pradesh Category:Buildings and structures in Faizabad Category:Transport in Faizabad Category:Proposed airports in Uttar Pradesh ",
