The Green Revolution in India refers to a period when Indian agriculture was converted into an industrial system due to the adoption of modern methods and technology such as the use of high yielding variety (HYV) seeds, tractors, irrigation facilities, pesticides, and fertilizers. It was mainly found by M.S. Swaminathan. This was part of the larger Green revolution endeavor initiated by Norman Borlaug, which leveraged agricultural research and technology to increase agricultural productivity in the developing world.Hardin, Lowell S. \"Meetings That Changed the World: Bellagio 1969: The Green Revolution.\" Nature 25 Sep 2008: 470-471. Retrieved 16 November 2018 from https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context;=envstudtheses Under premiership of Congress leader Indira Gandhi, the Green Revolution within India commenced in 1966 that led to an increase in food grain production, especially in Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. Major milestones in this undertaking were the development of high-yielding varieties of wheat, and rust resistant strains of wheat.Newman, Bryan. \"A Bitter Harvest: Farmer Suicide and the Unforeseen Social, Environmental and Economic Impacts of the Green Revolution in Punjab, India .\" Development Report No. 15. Jan 2007. Food First: Institute for Food and Development Policy. Retrieved 16 November 2018 from https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1027&context;=envstudtheses However, agricultural scientists like M.S. Swaminathan and social activists like Vandana Shiva are of the opinion that it caused greater long term sociological and financial problems for the people of Punjab and Haryana. However it proved to be a useful measure and was pioneer in helping the then Indian Government to independently produce necessary crops in her own country instead of depending on foreign exports and whose policies were often misused by the foreign nations to blackmail India to serve their own political purpose and get dominated by those nations. == Practices == === Wheat production === The main development was higher-yielding varieties of wheat, for developing rust resistant strains of wheat. The introduction of high-yielding varieties(HYV) of seeds and the improved quality of fertilizers and irrigation techniques led to the increase in production to make the country self- sufficient in food grains, thus improving agriculture in India. The methods adopted included the use of high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of seeds with modern farming methods. The production of wheat has produced the best results in fueling self-sufficiency of India. Along with high-yielding seeds and irrigation facilities, the enthusiasm of farmers mobilized the idea of agricultural revolution. Due to the rise in use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, there was a negative effect on the soil and the land (e.g., land degradation). === Other practices === * Irrigation infrastructure * Use of pesticides ** Use of insecticides ** Use of herbicides * Consolidation of holdings * Land reforms * Improved rural infrastructure * Supply of agricultural credit * Use of chemical or synthetic fertilizers * Use of sprinklers or drip irrigation systems * Use of advanced machinery * Use of vector quantity == Rationale for the Green Revolution == The Green Revolution in India was first introduced in Punjab in the late 1960s as part of a development program issued by international donor agencies and the Government of India. During the British Raj, India's grain economy hinged on a unilateral relation of exploitation. Consequently, when India gained independence, the weakened country quickly became vulnerable to frequent famines, financial instabilities, and low productivity. These factors formed a rationale for the implementation of the Green Revolution as a development strategy in India. === Frequent famines === In 1964-65 and 1965\u201366, India experienced two severe droughts which led to food shortages and famines among the country's growing population. Modern agricultural technologies appeared to offer strategies to counter the frequency of famines. There is debate regarding India's famines prior to independence, with some arguing they were intensified by British taxation and agrarian policies in the 19th and 20th centuries, and others downplaying such impact of colonial rule. === Lack of finance === Marginal farmers found it very difficult to get finance and credit at economical rates from the government and banks and hence, fell as easy prey to the money lenders. They took loans from landlords, who charged high rates of interests and also exploited the farmers later on to work in their fields to repay the loans (farm labourers). Proper financing was not given during the Green Revolution period, which created a lot of problems and sufferings to the farmers of India. Government also helped those under loans. === Low productivity === In the context of India's rapidly growing population, the country's traditional agricultural practices yielded insufficient food production. By the 1960s, this low productivity led India to experience food grain shortages that were more severe than those of other developing countries. Agricultural technological advancements offered opportunities to increase productivity. == Criticisms of the Green Revolution == The Green Revolution yielded great economic prosperity during its early years. In Punjab, where it was first introduced, the Green Revolution led to significant increases in the state's agricultural output, supporting India\u2019s overall economy. By 1970, Punjab was producing 70 percent of the country's total food grains, and farmers' incomes were increasing by over 70 percent. Punjab's prosperity following the Green Revolution became a model to which other states aspired to reach. However, despite the initial prosperity experienced in Punjab, the Green Revolution was met with much controversy throughout India. === Indian economic sovereignty === Criticism on the effects of the green revolution include the cost for many small farmers using HYV seeds, with their associated demands of increased irrigation systems and pesticides. A case study is found in India, where farmers are buying Monsanto BT cotton seeds\u2014sold on the idea that these seeds produced 'natural insecticides'. In reality, they need to still pay for expensive pesticides and irrigation systems, which might lead to increased borrowing to finance the change from traditional seed varieties. Many farmers have difficulty in paying for the expensive technologies, especially if they have a bad harvest. These high costs of cultivation push rural farmers to take out loans\u2014typically at high interest rates. Over-borrowing commonly entraps farmers into a cycle of debt. On top of this, India's liberalized economy further exacerbates the farmers's economic conditions. Indian environmentalist Vandana Shiva writes that this is the \"second Green Revolution\". The first Green Revolution, she suggests, was mostly publicly funded (by the Indian Government). This new Green Revolution, she says, is driven by private (and foreign) interest \u2013 notably MNCs like Monsanto\u2014as encouraged by the neoliberal context. Ultimately, this is leading to foreign ownership over most of India's farmland, undermining farmers' interests. Farmer's financial issues have become especially apparent in Punjab, where its rural areas have witnessed an alarming rise in suicide rates. Excluding the countless unreported cases, there has been estimated to be a 51.97 per cent increase in the number of suicides in Punjab in 1992-93, compared to the recorded 5.11 per cent increase in the country as a whole. According to a 2019 Indian newspaper, indebtedness continues to be a grave issue affecting Punjabi people today, demonstrated by the more than 900 recorded farmer suicided in Punjab in the last two years. === Environmental damage === Excessive and inappropriate use of fertilizers and pesticides polluted waterways and killed beneficial insects and wild life. It has caused over-use of soil and rapidly depleted its nutrients. The rampant irrigation practices led to eventual soil degradation. Groundwater practices have fallen dramatically. Further, heavy dependence on few major crops has led to loss of biodiversity of farmers. These problems were aggravated due to absence of training to use modern technology and vast illiteracy leading to excessive use of chemicals. === Increased regional disparities === The green revolution spread only in irrigated and high-potential rainfed areas. The villages or regions without the access of sufficient water were left out that widened the regional disparities between adopters and non-adopters. Since, the HYV seeds technically can be applied only in a land with assured water supply and availability of other inputs like chemicals, fertilizers etc. The application of the new technology in the dry-land areas is simply ruled out. The states like Punjab, Haryana, Western UP etc. having good irrigation and other infrastructure facilities were able to derive the benefits of the green revolution and achieve faster economic development while other states have recorded slow growth in agriculture production. == References == Category:Agricultural revolutions Category:History of agriculture in India Category:Intensive farming Category:History of the Republic of India Category:Economic history of India Category:Indira Gandhi administration Category:History of Punjab, India (1947\u2013present) ",
