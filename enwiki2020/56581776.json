In 2008, Saarinen\u2019s daughter Eve was born with an undetected critical congenital heart defect (CCHD). Although Saarinen's newborn daughter was in heart failure at 2 days old, she was nearly discharged without a diagnosis and survived two heart surgeries in the first months of life.Kristina Crane, \"Sent Home Too Soon? The Difficult Art of Hospital Discharge\", U.S. News, Jan 29, 2015 This experience inspired Saarinen to create the Newborn Foundation | Coalition and launched the country\u2019s first multi-hospital newborn heart screening pilot in collaboration with a state department of health, with the purpose of making CCHD screening a standard of care in the United States. As a result, the screening was added to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Routine Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) and all 50 states including the District of Columbia have adopted universal screening. Approximately 4 million U.S. newborns each year are now being screened for heart defects using pulse oximetry. ==Professional Background == Ananamarie Saarinen In 2016, Saarinen was appointed by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services under the Obama Administration to the federal Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC). She has helped draft more than 40 pieces of health legislation, authored more than 200 policy briefings and co-authored numerous published manuscripts on the importance of advancing early detection and treatment of neonatal and pediatric health conditions. Under her leadership, the BORN Project was selected as one of only 24 global innovation projects from around the world addressing the UN Sustainable Development Goals addressing human rights, health equity and innovation. The work of the UN Solutions Summit cohort was co-convened by the White House and the United Nations in collaborations with the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, the Kenyan Ministry of Technology, the Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Government of Norway, the Government of Fiji and the Global Innovation Exchange. Thus far, the BORN project has provided neonatal pulse oximetry screening training and implementation, and a data collection framework for more than 1,200 health workers, expanding its screening cohort to nearly 300,000 newborns across 200 delivery sites in 10 low and middle-income countries. It was also among the first formal public/private sector commitments to reduce preventable newborn mortality as part of the UN Secretary General's Every Woman, Every Child initiative. ==Newborn Foundation | Coalition== 310x310px In 2011, under Saarinen's leadership, the Newborn Foundation | Coalition successfully lobbied the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to include pulse-oximetry testing for CCHDs in their universal screening recommendations. As a result, all 50 states including the District of Columbia adopted these federal recommendations - known as the Routine Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), with roughly 4 millions U.S. newborns now being screened each year for CCHDs using pulse oximetry. Saarinen is leading the BORN project, a global health initiative leveraging pulse oximetry technology to combat neonatal mortality. The project is a targeted education-and-implementation initiative with the goal of bringing low-cost, effective screening tools, technologies and protocols to remote and resource-poor settings to earlier diagnose and treat medically fragile infants. To date, the foundation has worked in 16 countries, screening hundreds of thousands of newborns in its project portfolio, leading to formal newborn screening policies in China, Mongolia, the Philippines, India, and Mexico. In 2016, the Newborn Foundation was among the first investment grants from London-based Global Innovation Fund (GIF), supported the Department of International Development in the UK; the United States Agency for International Development (USAID); the Omidyar Network; the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency; and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia). The grant was used to expand the BORN Project, and bring low-cost, mobile-app based pulse oximetry technology to 93,000 newborns for earlier detection and access to treatment for life-threatening, but treatable health conditions. In 2018, the Newborn Foundation developed Find Pneumonia Sooner - a set of resources to help drive adoption of screening and diagnostic tools to reduce childhood pneumonia deaths as the single biggest killer of children globally. The initiative supports the Newborn Foundation\u2019s role as a founding partner of the Every Breath Counts Coalition, a global public-private partnership to support national governments to end preventable child pneumonia deaths by 2030, and was part of a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2019, The Newborn Foundation and co-founder Annamarie Saarinen were selected as 2019 #Give16 Honors recipients, presented by the 3M Open and honoring 16 individuals and organizations for outstanding impact in the community. The award also helped raise funds for programs at the University of Minnesota Masonic Children\u2019s Hospital, a Newborn Foundation partner research center. == Awards and Recognitions == Saarinen is the recipient of the Betty Hubbard Maternal and Child Health Leadership Award and the Patient Safety, Science and Technology Humanitarian Award, a distinction also held by Vice President Joe Biden, UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, and U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer. Saarinen is a Humphrey Policy Fellow, has been an adjunct lecturer at 5 international medical colleges, and serves as an advisor to UNICEF and the WHO in creating technical specifications for oxygen therapy and monitoring devices. == References == Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:American activists ",
