This dish is popular in many former Austro-Hungarian regions in various variations, all of which include a puff pastry base and custard cream, including the following countries: ==By country== ===In Austria=== ===In Slovenia=== In Slovenia, kremna rezina is commonly associated with the town of Bled, an Alpine tourist destination in northwestern Slovenia. The recipe cake was brought to the local Hotel Park in 1953 by I\u0161tvan Luka\u010devi\u0107 , chef of the hotel's confectionery store. He came to Bled from Serbia where a similar cake was already known. As of October 2009, 10 million cream cakes have been baked at the hotel's patisserie since its invention. The name of the dessert means simply \"cream slice\". Most locals refer to it as krem\u0161nita, from the German word Cremeschnitte, with the same meaning. While the kremna rezina from Bled celebrated their 10th million piece production, Sla\u0161\u010di\u010darna Len\u010dek, which is located in Dom\u017eale, in year 2013 celebrated the 75th anniversary since they have made their first one which is called Len\u010dkova kremna rezina. ===In Croatia=== Krempita In Croatia, the two most popular variants are Samoborska krem\u0161nita from the town of Samobor and Zagreba\u010dka krem\u0161nita from the capital, Zagreb. The extremely popular Samoborska krem\u0161nita is characterized by having a puff pastry top, predominantly custard cream filling (less whipped cream) with meringue and is finished with powdered sugar. Zagreba\u010dka krem\u0161nita has a characteristic chocolate icing instead of the puff pastry top, while maintaining the puff pastry base. The classic recipe for Samoborska krem\u0161nita is considered to be designed by \u0110uro Luka\u010di\u0107 in the early 1950s, based on different earlier variants found in patisseries of Zagreb. ===In Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina=== In Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro, the dish is known as krempita 'cream pie'. It is usually prepared with puff pastry dough. The filling is usually pure thick custard, less commonly combined with meringue (whipped egg whites and sugar) creme. A similar recipe with only meringue filling is called \u0160ampita. === In Montenegro === Kotorske krempite with three layers of dough and two layers of cream. In Montenegro, the most famous are the Kotorska krempita or Kotorska pa\u0161ta (Kotor Cremeschnitte). Except for the original recipe, they differ from other crempitas because they are made with three layers of dough and two layers of cream. The \"Kotorska pa\u0161ta\" festival dedicated to this delicacy is held in Kotor every year. === In Poland === === In Romania === Is made out of filo pastry of usually three layers with cream on top and crumble sprinkled on it.
