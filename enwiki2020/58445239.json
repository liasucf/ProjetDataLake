    "text": "The Vaughn's Hall and Blacksmith Shop is a building in Montello, Wisconsin, United States, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The two- story cement block building was built by a blacksmith named John P. Vaughn in 1912. The new cast concrete blocks were manufactured in Montello at Neck and Brothers manufacturing site. The building was used as a blacksmith shop with a community hall upstairs. The second floor grand opening ball on June 28, 1912 featured the Lyric Harp Orchestra. Later, the building was used as a garage, a car dealership, a hardware store, and is now home of the Montello Museum. In 2001, on the eve of demolition, Vaughn Hall was saved by a group of citizens dedicated to preserving Montello's history and a conscientious community who donated the building to the Montello Historic Preservation Society. ==References== Category:Blacksmith shops Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Wisconsin Category:1912 establishments in Wisconsin Category:National Register of Historic Places in Marquette County, Wisconsin ",
