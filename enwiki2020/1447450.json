The show stars Kirstie Alley as Veronica \"Ronnie\" Chase, the head of her own lingerie company in New York City. ==Overview== Veronica 'Ronnie' Chase, played by Alley, has made a living being known as the \"Queen of Romance\". She is the owner of Veronica's Closet, a company that sells lingerie and other bedroom accessories. Her husband Bryce, played by Christopher McDonald, regularly cheats on her, though she always takes him back because of the image she has created. However, after another tryst, Veronica decides to leave him and begins her life as a single woman. She is championed by her best friend and Chief Financial Officer Olive Massery, played by Kathy Najimy, and her father Pat Chase, played by Robert Prosky, who is also her chauffeur. She also works with Perry Rollins, played by Dan Cortese, a former thong model who is her publicist; her assistant Josh Blair, played by Wallace Langham, and Leo Michaels, played by Darryl 'Chill' Mitchell. Later in the first season, she gets a silent partner in Millicent, played by Holland Taylor. However, when Millicent dies, the company is taken over by Millicent's incompetent son. During the second season. Millicent's ex- husband, Alec Bilson, played by Ron Silver, takes the company from his former step-son and helps the company regain some financial ground. However, he and Ronnie get closer, romantically, as the season progresses. He dies between seasons two and three and is revealed to have married someone else. His widow, June Bilson, played by Lorri Bagley, is a stereotypical dumb blonde who has some secret intelligence. She remodels the entire office and refuses to give up her share of the company until Olive buys her out in the series finale. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Kirstie Alley as Veronica \"Ronnie\" Chase * Dan Cortese as Laird \"Perry\" Rollins, former underwear model and publicist * Wallace Langham as Josh Nicol\u00e9 Blair, Veronica's assistant, a man whose sexual identity is unclear * Daryl Mitchell as Leo Michaels, Veronica's harried marketing manager * Kathy Najimy as Olive Massery * Robert Prosky as Pat Chase (season 1) * Ron Silver as Alec Bilson, Veronica's business partner and rival (season 2) * Lorri Bagley as June Bilson Anderson, Alec's wife and Veronica's partner (season 3) ===Recurring=== * Mary Lynn Rajskub as Chloe (15 episodes) * Cynthia Mann as Virginia/Receptionist (14 episodes) * Christopher McDonald as Bryce Anderson (9 episodes), Ronnie's ex-husband * Ever Carradine as Pepper (8 episodes) * Tamala Jones as Tina (8 episodes) * Alan F.

Its title was derived from the \u201creal life\u201d lingerie company, Victoria's Secret. Hammocked between Seinfeld and ER within the Must See TV lineup, the show was a top 10 hit, although the initial ratings died down later in the first season. The sitcom spent the first two seasons on Thursdays at 9:30 (after Seinfeld in season 1 and after Frasier in season 2). NBC moved the show out of Must See TV to a new time slot, following Suddenly Susan (another NBC sitcom centered around a professional single woman), on Mondays for the 1999\u20132000 season. Ratings fell more than 50 percent, and NBC put both shows on hiatus. The show returned on Tuesdays at 9:30 (after Will & Grace) with only a slight boost in ratings. NBC canceled the series in 2000, along with Suddenly Susan, due to low ratings. Reruns were shown on USA Network for a short time in 2000\u20132001 and on TV Guide Network from 2011\u20132012. The show was taped Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, on soundstage 25. ==Episodes== ===Series overview=== ===Season 1 (1997\u20131998)=== ===Season 2 (1998\u20131999)=== ===Season 3 (1999\u20132000)=== ==Broadcast and ratings history== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
