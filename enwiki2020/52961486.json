    "text": "LexShares is an online marketplace for investing in litigation. It connects plaintiffs in commercial legal disputes with investors to fund their cases. Founded in 2014, LexShares is privately owned with offices in Boston and New York City. The LexShares platform, launched by co-founders Jay Greenberg and Max Volsky in 2014, is an online marketplace for litigation funding, similar to equity crowdfunding. The LexShares platform connects accredited investors with plaintiffs and attorneys looking for funding. Investors can buy a stake in the outcome of a lawsuit by giving plaintiffs, oftentimes business owners, the capital they need to pay legal fees or operate their business while in the midst of litigation. LexShares funds individual commercial cases. When a new case is offered, LexShares' investor network is notified and has the opportunity to invest through their online platform. In 2018, LexShares closed its debut $25 million multi-claim marketplace fund. On 10 June 2020, LexShares confirmed the introduction of LexShares Marketplace Fund II (LMFII). LMFII would invest in litigation-related investments available on the LexShares marketplace with a goal fund size of $100 million. ==References== ==External links== * LexShares Category:2014 establishments in the United States Category:Financial services companies of the United States Category:Online marketplaces of the United States ",
