    "text": "Bug is the third studio album by American alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr., released in October 1988 through SST Records. Blast First and Au Go Go Records released the album in the United Kingdom and Australia, respectively. It was the last Dinosaur Jr. album with original bassist Lou Barlow until Beyond in 2007. Bug is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Beats Per Minute ranked it the 41st best album of the 1980s. Despite it being a favorite of many Dinosaur Jr. fans, J Mascis has said it is his least favorite Dinosaur Jr. album. The version of 'Keep The Glove' included on the 2005 reissue is not the same as the version on the b-side of the 'Freakscene' single or the 'Fossils' compilation. == Critical reception == Sample of \"Freak Scene\" The album was generally well received by critics. In a favorable review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine described 'Freak Scene' as the album's \"masterpiece\" and opined \"Although the majority of the album is firmly situated in the sprawling, noisy metallic fusion of hard rock and avant noise, Bug also demonstrates that J Mascis has a talent for winding folk-rock. Like its predecessor, the songs on Bug are quite uneven, but it does represent a major step forward for Mascis\". Writing for Drowned In Sound in 2005, Mike Diver said of the album \"The songwriting has increased tenfold since You\u2019re Living All Over Me, with Barlow and Mascis really beginning to flex the grey matter muscles. But really, if you like music \u2013 be it grunge, indie, punk, whatever \u2013 you will love this. Period. Go spend some money already.\" Awarding the album 4 out of 5 stars, Mojo said in their issue 108 review article \"Bug marks the emergence of Mascis writing by rote. When applied to such an outlandishly great song as 'Freak Scene' his skills still blazed...\" ==Track listing== All songs written by J Mascis. ==Personnel== ;Dinosaur Jr. * J Mascis \u2013 vocals, guitar * Lou Barlow \u2013 bass, vocals on \"Don't\" * Murph \u2013 drums ;Additional personnel * Sean Slade \u2013 engineering * Paul Q.
