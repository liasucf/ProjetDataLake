His father also had the praenomen Gnaeus and was a praetor in 205 BC who fought in the Second Punic War. His grandfather, Gnaeus Octavius Rufus was quaestor 230 BC. == Career == === Ambassadorship in Greece === In the winter of 170 BC, Octavius and Gaius Popillius Laenas served as ambassadors in Greece under Aulus Hostilius Mancinus, where they enforced a decree by the Senate asserting the Senate's control over Roman magistrates stationed in Greece. At Aegium, the ambassadors spoke with the Achaeans, assuring that the Romans were on good terms with them. However, on entering Aetolia, they were not as well-received and demanded hostages. Lastly, they then went to Thyrium in Acarnania without having settled the disputes in Aetolia. There, they heard from opposing groups of Acarnanians who were debating war with the Macedonians.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita 43.17 === Campaign in Macedonia === Octavius served as praetor in 168 BC and was given control of the Roman fleet in the Third Macedonian War.Livy, Ab Urbe Condita 44.17 After the consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus defeated Perseus at Pydna, Octavius took the Roman fleet to Samothrace in pursuit of Perseus.
