He played 11 games in the NHL for the Maple Leafs and Atlanta Thrashers between 2000 and 2003, mainly playing in the minor American Hockey League, before a spinal injury during a game forced his early retirement. Internationally Farkas played for the American national junior team at three World Junior Championships, winning a silver medal in 1997. ==Playing career== After playing four seasons of college hockey for Boston College, Farkas joined the Maple Leafs' roster for the 2000 Stanley Cup Playoffs. He appeared in three games during that postseason, recording one goal. Despite his playoff success, Farkas appeared in only eight games for the Maple Leafs over the next two seasons, and three more for the Atlanta Thrashers during the 2002\u201303 season. While playing for the American Hockey League's Chicago Wolves in 2003, Farkas was pushed from behind, and fell headfirst into the boards during a game against the Rochester Americans.
