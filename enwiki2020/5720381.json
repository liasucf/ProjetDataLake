During the 20th century, most attacks were carried out by various Irish Republican Army (IRA) groups and were linked to the Northern Ireland conflict (the Troubles). In the late 20th century there were also isolated attacks by Middle Eastern terrorist groups, though it was still the fact that the vast majority of the attacks were the work of the IRA and allied groups. During the 21st century, however, most terrorist incidents in Britain have been linked to Islamic fundamentalism. An interpretation of this change is that terrorist incidents in Britain may be growing due to Britain's participation in the Iraq War and its role in the Syrian Civil War, as part of a coalition with other Western countries. Polling shows most Britons agree with the theory that their country's actions in Muslim lands provoke blowback in the form of terror attacks. Since 1970, there have been at least 3,395 terrorist-related deaths in the UK, the highest in western Europe.\"How many people are killed by terrorist attacks in the UK?\". The Telegraph. 5 June 2017. The vast majority of the deaths were linked to the Northern Ireland conflict and happened in Northern Ireland. Between 1971 and 2001, there were 430 terrorist-related deaths in Great Britain. Of these, 125 deaths were linked to the Northern Ireland conflict, and 305 deaths were linked to other causesDouglas, Roger. Law, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Terrorism. University of Michigan Press, 2014. p.18 \u2013 most of the latter deaths occurred in the Lockerbie bombing.
