    "text": "The A49 derby is a football rivalry between Hereford FC and Shrewsbury Town. The derby was listed as the nineteenth fiercest rivalry in English football by The Daily Telegraph, with the two clubs last facing each other in the league during the 2011\u201312 season which concluded with Shrewsbury being promoted to League One and Hereford relegated to the Conference National. The last meeting to date was an FA Cup first-round tie the following season at Edgar Street, with Hereford winning 3\u20131. Hereford United were subsequently wound-up at the High Court in December 2014. With the phoenix club Hereford F.C. currently competing in the National League North, three divisions below Shrewsbury, the fixture is only likely to be played in the FA Cup. In November 2015, an FA Vase second round fixture between the newly formed Hereford FC and Shrewsbury- based West Midlands (Regional) League club Haughmond at Edgar Street was humorously given the title of \"The New A49 Derby\". ==History== ===Head-to-head record=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
