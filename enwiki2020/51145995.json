    "text": "The Guerra de los Padres (\"War of the Priests\") was a violent political crisis that took place in Honduras between April and June 1861. A conflict between the government and the clergy began when President Jos\u00e9 Santos Guardiola agreed to permit freedom of worship to the inhabitants of the Bay Islands, a predominantly Protestant colony of Britain. This contravened the Constitution of 1848.Thomas M. Leonard, The History of Honduras (Greenwood, 2011), p. 46.
