The play received its world premiere at the Donmar Warehouse as part of their spring 2015 season, where it ran from 24 April to 7 May 2015. Directed by Josie Rourke and set in a fictitious London polling station on election night 2015, the play was broadcast live on UK television channel More4 on the night of the election. In 2019, the play was updated in a production for that year's general election. ==Production history== The Vote was written by playwright James Graham. On 3 November 2014, it was announced the play would premiere as part of the Donmar Warehouse's spring 2015 season and would begin previews at the Donmar Warehouse, London on 24 April with an official opening, and final night on 7 May 2015. Tickets for the play's short run were made available through a ballot. In addition to its theatre showing, a live broadcast of the play aired on the UK television channel More4 on the night of the election. The Vote is set in a polling station in Lambeth, during the final 90 minutes of polling for the 2015 general election on 7 May 2015, meaning it was the first ever play broadcast live at the exact time it was set. The broadcast attracted 555,000 viewers at its peak, making it the most viewed production in the history of the Donmar Warehouse. The broadcast was filmed using fixed-rig cameras, similar to those used in television shows such as One Born Every Minute, rather than conventional filming methods. The play was directed by Josie Rourke, with design by Robert Jones, lighting design by Oliver Fenwick, movement by Stephen Mear, composition by Michael Bruce and sound design by Nick Lidster. The work which had been in development for a year previous reunited the Donmar Warehouse's artistic director Rourke with writer James Graham, who last worked together on the play Privacy, which also premiered at the Donmar. The play featured an ensemble cast of around 40, including Catherine Tate, Mark Gatiss, Timothy West, Nina Sosanya and Bill Paterson. Judi Dench also starred alongside her real life daughter Finty Williams for the first time, playing a mother and daughter and marking her first performance at the theatre since 1976. A typical performance ran 90 minutes, with no interval. Describing the live broadcast, director Rourke said, \"This is a unique opportunity for the Donmar to make a small theatre feel very big\", whilst writer Graham added that he hoped to illuminate the \"diverse, diligent and often hilarious individuals\" who turn the \"unglamourous\" settings of polling stations into \"places where history is made\". ==Cast== * Mark Gatiss * Catherine Tate * Jude Law * Kit Harington * Judi Dench * Timothy West * Chuk Iwuji * Hadley Fraser * Eddie Arnold * Paul Chahidi * Rosalie Craig * Fisayo Akinade * Stephen Kennedy * Jade Anouka * Jackie Clune * Gerard Horan * Michael Shaeffer * Nina Sosanya * Nicholas Burns * Pandora Colin * Heather Craney * Stavros Demetraki * Rachel Denning * Rita Balogun * Tommy French * Madalena Alberto * Llewella Gideon * Joanna Griffin * Alice Hewkin * MyAnna Buring * Kadiff Kirwan * Aicha Kossoko * Beverley Longhurst * Andrew McDonald * Wnda Opalinska * Bhasker Patel * Bill Paterson * Prasanna Puwanarajah * Penny Ryder * Yusra Warsama * Finty Williams * Alex Boxall ==References== ( Category:2015 plays Category:2015 television films Category:2015 in British television Category:2015 United Kingdom general election Category:English political plays Category:Works set in the 2010s Category:Plays set in London Category:Works about elections Category:Plays by James Graham ",
