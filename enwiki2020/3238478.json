    "text": "In mathematics, a Bianchi group is a group of the form :PSL_2(\\mathcal{O}_d) where d is a positive square-free integer. Here, PSL denotes the projective special linear group and \\mathcal{O}_d is the ring of integers of the imaginary quadratic field \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d}). The groups were first studied by as a natural class of discrete subgroups of PSL_2(\\mathbb{C}), now termed Kleinian groups. As a subgroup of PSL_2(\\mathbb{C}), a Bianchi group acts as orientation-preserving isometries of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space \\mathbb{H}^3. The quotient space M_d = PSL_2(\\mathcal{O}_d) \\backslash\\mathbb{H}^3 is a non-compact, hyperbolic 3-fold with finite volume, which is also called Bianchi manifold. An exact formula for the volume, in terms of the Dedekind zeta function of the base field \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d}), was computed by Humbert as follows. Let D be the discriminant of \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d}), and \\Gamma=SL_2(\\mathcal{O}_d), the discontinuous action on \\mathcal{H}, then :\\mathrm{vol}(\\Gamma\\backslash\\mathbb{H})=\\frac{|D|^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{4\\pi^2}\\zeta_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d})}(2) \\ . The set of cusps of M_d is in bijection with the class group of \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-d}). It is well known that any non-cocompact arithmetic Kleinian group is weakly commensurable with a Bianchi group.Maclachlan & Reid (2003) p.58 ==References== * * * * * ==External links== * Allen Hatcher, Bianchi Orbifolds Category:Group theory ",
