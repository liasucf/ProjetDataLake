    "text": "This article provides information on candidates who stood for the 1934 Australian federal election. The election was held on 15 September 1934. ==By- elections, appointments and defections== ===By-elections and appointments=== *On 6 February 1932, Eddie Ward (NSW Labor) was elected to replace John Clasby (UAP) as the member for East Sydney. *On 6 April 1933, Herbert Collett (UAP) was appointed as a Western Australian Senator to replace Sir Hal Colebatch (UAP). *On 11 November 1933, James Fairbairn (UAP) was elected to replace Stanley Bruce (UAP) as the member for Flinders. *On 5 June 1934, William Holman (UAP), the member for Martin, died. No by-election was held due to the proximity of the election. *On 31 July 1934, Charles McGrath (UAP), the member for Ballaarat, died. No by-election was held due to the proximity of the election. *On 2 August 1934, Walter McNicoll (Country), the member for Werriwa, resigned. No by-election was held due to the proximity of the election. ===Defections=== *In 1933, Independent MP Sir Littleton Groom (Darling Downs) joined the United Australia Party. *In 1934, Country Senator Robert Elliott (Victoria) lost preselection. He resigned from the party and sat as an Independent. *In 1934, Labor Senator John Daly (South Australia) was expelled from the state branch of the party, and sat as an Independent. *In 1934, a dispute between the federal Australian Country Party and the state- based United Country Party in Victoria saw the two parties endorse candidates separately. The UCP had demanded that sitting members sign a new pledge before being re-endorsed, which several MPs objected to. The two sitting members, deputy party leader Thomas Paterson (Gippsland) and Hugh McClelland (Wimmera), were endorsed by the federal party. The other Victorian Country Party MP, William Hill (Echuca), retired rather than sign the pledge. ==Redistributions and seat changes== *Redistributions of electoral boundaries occurred in New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia. **In New South Wales, the UAP- held seat of South Sydney was renamed Watson. The Labor-held seat of Cook and the UAP-held seats of East Sydney (gained by NSW Labor in a by-election) and Lang also became notionally NSW Labor. ***The member for Lang, Dick Dein (UAP), contested the Senate. ***The member for South Sydney, John Jennings (UAP), contested Watson. **In Queensland, the Labor-held seat of Oxley was renamed Griffith. ***The member for Oxley, Frank Baker (Labor), contested Griffith. **In South Australia, the UAP-held seat of Angas was abolished. *The member for Corangamite, William Gibson (Country), contested the Senate. ==Retiring Members and Senators== ===Labor=== * Frank Anstey MP (Bourke, Vic) ===United Australia=== * Malcolm Cameron MP (Barker, SA) * Moses Gabb MP (Angas, SA) * John Latham MP (Kooyong, Vic) * George Mackay MP (Lilley, Qld) * William Watson MP (Fremantle, WA) *Senator Sir Walter Kingsmill (WA) *Senator Sir Harry Lawson (Vic) *Senator Matthew Reid (Qld) ===Country=== * William Hill MP (Echuca, Vic) ===Independent=== *Senator John Daly (SA) [elected as Labor] ==House of Representatives== Sitting members at the time of the election are shown in bold text.
