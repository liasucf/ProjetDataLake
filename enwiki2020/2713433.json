    "text": "Dominie (Wiktionary definition) is a Scots language and Scottish English term for a Scottish schoolmaster usually of the Church of Scotland and also a term used in the US for a minister or pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church. ==Origin== It comes from the Latin domine (vocative case of Dominus 'Lord, Master'). When the Church of Scotland began to introduce universal provision of education in Scotland after it became established as a national church in 1560, its aim was to have a university educated schoolmaster in every parish. The minister sometimes served as the dominie. Over time this came to be used as a term for a minister, schoolmaster or university student. In the United States and in South Africa the same word is used to describe a pastor in the Dutch Reformed Church. ==See also== * Dominee ==References== Category:Church of Scotland Category:Education in Scotland Category:Scots language Category:Scottish English Category:Titles Category:Education and training occupations ",
