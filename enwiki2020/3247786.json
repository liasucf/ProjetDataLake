The book also includes previously unreleased interview questions that were left out of the magazine articles, and a full piece on Darkthrone's Transilvanian Hunger that was never published in a magazine due to its length. ===Flexi Series=== In November 2010, the magazine announced the launch of the monthly Decibel Flexi Series. Beginning with the January 2011 issue (#75), the magazine now includes a limited vinyl flexi disc bound into the magazine each month available exclusively to its subscribers. ==Tour== Beginning in 2012, Decibel puts on an annual tour in the US and Canada. According to metal blog No Clean Singing, typically the tour is headlined by a seasoned death metal band and includes three supporting acts: a \"hard-touring band with a dependable legion of fans\"; a \"critical darling band in search of a wider audience, one that Decibel Magazine has put a lot of page space into supporting\"; and a \"pit-friendly band with connections to the metal underground, one early in their career and sporting a charismatic frontman\". Some dates of the tour also include local openers. == References == == External links == * *The Decibel Magazine Tour website Category:Music magazines published in the United States Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:Heavy metal publications Category:Magazines established in 2004 Category:Magazines published in Philadelphia Category:Periodicals with audio content Category:2004 establishments in Pennsylvania ",
