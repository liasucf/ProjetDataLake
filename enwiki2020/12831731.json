    "text": "The Lordship of Glamorgan was one of the most powerful and wealthy of the Welsh Marcher Lordships. The seat was Cardiff Castle. It was established by the conquest of Glamorgan from its native Welsh ruler, by the Anglo-Norman nobleman Robert FitzHamon, feudal baron of Gloucester, and his legendary followers the Twelve Knights of Glamorgan. The Anglo-Norman Lord of Glamorgan, like all Marcher lords, ruled his lands directly by his own law: thus he could, amongst other things, declare war, raise taxes, establish courts and markets and build castles as he wished, without reference to the Crown. These privileges were only lost under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542. Though possessing many castles, the main seat of the Lordship was Cardiff Castle. == First Creation == thumb *Robert Fitzhamon, the conqueror of Glamorgan (1093\u20131107) *Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (1118\u20131147) *William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester (1147\u20131183) *Isabel, Countess of Gloucester (d. 1217) with: **John of England (1189\u20131214), however marriage annulled **Geoffrey FitzGeoffrey de Mandeville, 2nd Earl of Essex (after 1214\u20131217) == Second Creation == *Gilbert de Clare, 4th Earl of Hertford, 5th Earl of Gloucester (1217\u20131230) *Richard de Clare, 5th Earl of Hertford, 6th Earl of Gloucester (1230\u20131262) *Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford, 7th Earl of Gloucester (1262\u20131295) *Ralph de Monthermer, 1st Baron Monthermer (1297\u20131307) through marriage to Joan, the widow of the 6th Earl.
