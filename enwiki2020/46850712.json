The lens is one of the classic professional soft-focus \"portrait lenses\". In a joint effort with the pioneering photographer Heinrich K\u00fchn, who, as a pictorialist, was artistically seeking for \"romantic softness without sugariness, blurring without a woolly effect\" in images and had been experimenting with binocular lenses and soft filters and rasters in the 1920s already, the lens was technically designed by ,G. Kadlubek, R. Hillebrand: Kadlubeks Objektiv-Katalog. Ed. Photo-Deal, Neuss 2000, , S. 150. founder of the optical company in Munich, Germany. The resulting lens was marketed as Anachromat K\u00fchn. Later in 1928,Wolfgang Baier: Quellendarstellungen zur Geschichte der Fotografie. 2. Auflage, Schirmer/Mosel, M\u00fcnchen 1980, , S. 536 the lens became the Tiefenbildner-Imagon, which was introduced by Rodenstock in 1930/1931 and produced up into the 1990s. The unusual term ' is a German composition, which can be best translated as \"depth-of-field creator, modulator or painter\" in an artistic sense; this designation was later dropped. Imagons do not typically have shutter mechanisms and are instead mounted on shutters (i.e., Copal large format shutters). There are also variants which can be mounted on focusing helicoids or bellows to be used with medium format or 35 mm cameras. All Imagons were originally sold with three different diffusion discs matched to its focal length. The Imagon equivalent to aperture size is determined by the interplay between the imagon lens central opening and the modifiable arrangement of smaller openings on the diffusion disc. These taken together produce an \"H-stop\" designation which approximates the corresponding f-stop of a normal lens. By rotating the outer rim of the disc, the opening of these smaller holes can be modified, and by this the amount of softness, which superimposes the sharper core of the image, is also changed. Wider H-stops, or more-open holes, mean more softness. Focus is set with the diffusion disc closed. The diffusion disc is then opened to the degree desired to record the image.Alfons Scholz, Lichtbilder mit dem Imagon, 1979 pg. 61. == List of lens models == List of known Anachromat K\u00fchn Dr. Staeble lenses: *170 mm (A17; for 9\u00d712 cm) *200 mm (A20; for 9\u00d712 cm) *250 mm (A25; for 9\u00d712 cm) *310 mm (A31, for 9\u00d712 cm) List of known Rodenstock Imagon lenses: *90 mm (for 35 mm; prototype for pre-World War II Leica only) *120 mm H=4.5 (for 35 mm and 6\u00d76 cm) *150 mm H=5.8 (for 6\u00d76 cm) *170 mm H=5.4 (for 6\u00d79 cm)Imagon - Rodenstock macht es Ihnen leicht *200 mm H=5.4 (for 9\u00d712 cm) *200 mm H=5.8 (for 4.5\u00d76 cm,Rodenstock - Das Imagon H5,8/200mm an Mittelformatkameras 6\u00d76 cm, 6\u00d77 cm, 6\u00d79 cm, and 4\u00d75\") *250 mm H=5.4 (for 10\u00d715 cm) *250 mm H=5.8 (for 4\u00d75\") *300 mm H=5.6 (for 13\u00d718 cm) *300 mm H=7.7 (for 5\u00d77\")Brian Lewington: A History of the Imagon lens by Dr. Alfons Schultz *360 mm H=5.8 (for 16\u00d721 cm and 8\u00d710\") *420 mm H=6.0 (for 18\u00d724 cm) *480 mm H=6.2 (for 24\u00d730 cm) == See also == * *Soft-focus lens *Bokeh *Depth-of-field == References == == Further reading == * Alfons Scholz: Lichtbilder mit dem Imagon. vwi Verlag, Starnberg 1980 == External links == * Harold M.
