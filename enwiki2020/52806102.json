    "text": "Occipital epilepsy is a neurological disorder that arises from excessive neural activity in the occipital lobe of the brain that may or may not be symptomatic. Occipital lobe epilepsy is fairly rare, and may sometimes be misdiagnosed as migraine when symptomatic. Epileptic seizures are the result of synchronized neural activity that is excessive, and may stem from a failure of inhibitory neurons to regulate properly. ==Signs and symptoms== The most frequently reported symptoms are elementary \"visual hallucinations\" characterized by basic irritations to perception of sight. Scotomas and amaurosis also occur and are predictors of poor medication response. Hallucinations may be described as flashing small circular patterns or zigzags. Vomiting or temporary blindness may occur and visual seizures may be followed by a headache leading to a frequent misdiagnosis as migraine. Seizures may become generalized. ==Diagnosis== ==Management== Prognosis is generally good, and seizures usually respond to classic antiepileptics. Resection of pathological tissue has been used successfully to treat occipital lobe epilepsy. ==References== Category:Epilepsy types Category:Occipital lobe ",
