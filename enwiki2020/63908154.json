Its motto is \"Den Samiska Kultur- och Samh\u00e4llstidskriften\" (The S\u00e1mi Culture and Society Magazine). Having published regularly since 1918, Samefolket is considered one of the oldest indigenous periodicals in the world. ==History== Samefolket was founded by Torkel Tomasson following the first national meeting of the Swedish S\u00e1mi, which was held in \u00d6stersund in 1918 on the heels of the pan-national S\u00e1mi Assembly of 1917. Tomasson called the new paper Samefolkets Egen Tidning (The S\u00e1mi People's Newspaper). In the first issue, Tomasson called for people to use the word \"S\u00e1mi\" instead of \"Lapp,\" both as an expression of pride in the S\u00e1mi people and because of negative associations in Swedish with the word Lapp. Tomasson served as editor-in-chief of the paper until his death in 1940, publishing many articles on S\u00e1mi culture and identity. In 1960, Samefolkets Egen Tidning was rebranded as Samefolket (The S\u00e1mi People). Samefolket mainly reports on cultural and political events in S\u00e1pmi, but it periodically also covers issues of importance to other indigenous peoples. The magazine publishes primarily in Swedish, but also contains stories in Norwegian and S\u00e1mi languages spoken in Sweden, primarily Northern, Lule, and Southern S\u00e1mi. The magazine is owned by Stiftelsen Samefolket, which is co-funded by the and . ===Editors=== * Torkel Tomasson: 1918\u20131940 * : 1940\u20131960 * Israel Ruong: 1969\u20131973 * Olle Andersson: 1974\u20131996 * Gustaf Jillker: 1996\u20132003 * \u00c5sa Lindstrand: 2003 ==References== Category:Magazines published in Sweden Category:Publications established in 1918 Category:Sami in Sweden Category:1918 establishments in Sweden Category:Sami magazines Category:Swedish-language magazines ",
