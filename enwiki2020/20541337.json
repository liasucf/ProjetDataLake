It has significantly reduced time between Yeongdo Island and western Busan. Initially, a trip from Seo-gu to Yeongdo-gu (or vice versa) was 7 km long and would take 30 minutes. Now, it is only 2 km long and takes 3 minutes. ==See also== * Gwangandaegyo -another bridge part of the Southern Busan Thoroughfare ==External links== * Busan Infrastracture Corporation(\ubd80\uc0b0\uc2dc\uc124\uacf5\ub2e8) Category:Buildings and structures in Busan ",
