Its nearest higher peak is Mount Daly, to the immediate northeast. Takakkaw Falls is situated four km to the west, the Waputik Icefield lies to the north, and Sherbrooke Lake lies to the south. ==History== Charles Sproull Thompson (1869-1921) named the peak in 1898, for William H. Niles (1838-1910), president of the Appalachian Mountain Club and Professor of Geology at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who also did some mountaineering in the area. Canadian Mountain Place Names - The Rockies and Columbia Mountains, Glen W. Boles, Roger W. Laurilla, William L. Putnam, Rocky Mountain Books, 2006, page 183. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1898 by D. Campbell and Charles E. Fay. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. ==Geology== Mount Niles is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Mount Niles is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below \u221230 \u00b0C. Precipitation runoff from Mount Niles drains into the Yoho River and Niles Creek, both tributaries of the Kicking Horse River. ==References== ==See also== *List of mountains of Canada *Geography of British Columbia Mount Niles right of center with Mount Daly and Daly Glacier to left, and Takakkaw Falls in lower right, as seen from Iceline Trail ==External links== * Weather: Mount Niles * Parks Canada web site: Yoho National Park Category:Mountains of British Columbia Category:Canadian Rockies Category:Yoho National Park ",
