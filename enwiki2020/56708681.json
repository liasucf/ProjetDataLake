Noel Burtt was a leg-spinner who spun the ball sharply and took about 500 wickets over 20 years for his club, Sydenham, in the Christchurch senior competition. However, he was only moderately successful in first-class cricket, and was unable to command a regular spot in the Canterbury team. His brother Tom played Test cricket for New Zealand. Both of them played hockey for Canterbury. Noel's son Wayne also played cricket for Canterbury. Noel Burtt served in the New Zealand Artillery during the Second World War. In 1983, suffering from severe illness, he took his own life.David Frith, Silence of the Heart: Cricket Suicides, Mainstream Publishing, Edinburgh, p. 72. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1911 births Category:1983 deaths Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:Canterbury cricketers Category:Cricketers from Christchurch Category:New Zealand military personnel of World War II Category:Cricketers who committed suicide ",
