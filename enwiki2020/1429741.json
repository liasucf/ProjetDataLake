Quite often IPs have an accountancy background. A few active practitioners are lawyers, but it is not necessary to be qualified as either, as since 1986 there has been a direct entry route to the profession. ==Insolvency is a regulated profession== In the UK, only a licensed insolvency practitioner can be appointed in relation to formal insolvency procedures for individuals and businesses. Insolvency practitioners are licensed to advise on, and undertake appointments in, all formal insolvency procedures. In the UK, insolvency practitioners are subject to oversight and inspection by their recognised professional body. Insolvency is a regulated profession under the Insolvency Act 1986 and anyone who wishes to practise as an IP needs to pass the JIEB exams; a set of three examination papers set by the Joint Insolvency Examination Board (JIEB). The exams are held once a year, usually in November, and each last 3.5 hours. Once the exams have been passed, it is necessary to meet the authorising body's insolvency experience requirements. Licences are issued by the following recognised professional bodies: *Association of Chartered Certified Accountants *Insolvency Practitioners Association *Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales *Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland *Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland *Law Society of Scotland *Solicitors Regulation Authority As a \"competent authority\" under the Insolvency Act 1986, the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) \u2013 and, for Northern Ireland, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment \u2013 also authorises IPs.
