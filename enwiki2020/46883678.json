    "text": "Berge Virgin Forest Nature Reserve () is a nature reserve in J\u00e4mtland County in Sweden. It is part of the EU-wide Natura 2000-network. The nature reserve protects an area of virgin forest in a hilly landscape, and also contains the Lake Gr\u00e5ssj\u00f6n. Some parts of the forest is almost completely unaltered by human activity; for example, one tree in the nature reserve has been found to be 580 years old. The forest is mixed coniferous, and contains a lot of coarse woody debris. The unspoilt area is an important habitat for several unusual species, including lesser twayblade, heath spotted orchid and northern coralroot. It is also a preferred habitat for several birds, like osprey, red- throated loon and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker; the latter two are on the national Swedish red list. ==References== Category:Nature reserves in Sweden Category:Natura 2000 in Sweden Category:Tourist attractions in J\u00e4mtland County Category:Geography of J\u00e4mtland County Category:Protected areas established in 1998 Category:1998 establishments in Sweden Category:Old-growth forests ",
