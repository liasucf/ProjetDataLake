Capel Moreia, Llangefni, a design by Owen Morris Roberts Roberts was born in Birkenhead, the son of Edward Roberts, a joiner from Porthmadog.\"Owen Morris Roberts\" in Capel (journal of Cymdeithas Treftadaeth y Capeli), 39 (2002), 11 The family returned to Porthmadog when Edward Roberts was employed on the rebuilding of Capel Tabernacl in the town. Roberts had originally been a ship's carpenter, but subsequently took over his father's joinery business, studied art and geometry with John Cambrian Rowland, and trained himself to become an architect.Jones, Anthony (1996) Welsh Chapels, NMW, p.87 He went on to design a large number of chapels, particularly in North Wales, and other public buildings. Roberts' surviving work includes Capel Moreia, Llangefni; remodelling of the now-listed Plough Lane Chapel, Brecon and the Rundbogenstil-inspired facade of Capel Bach, Rhos. He was responsible for the remodelling of Capel Als, Llanelli. Secular buildings produced by his firm include the Albert Hall, Llandrindod Wells. Many of his chapels are in the Italianate style, occasionally freely mixed with Classical elements, and often feature stair towers. Roberts, who was a prominent member of the Liberal Party and a councillor for Merioneth, died in Porthmadog in 1896. His firm, Owen Morris Roberts & Son, went on to produce other chapel designs. ==Gallery== Image:Capel y Garth,Porthmadog DSC 1619 -1.jpg|Capel y Garth, Porthmadog (1898) Image:Rhosllanerchrugog - geograph.org.uk - 16697.jpg|Capel Bach, Rhos; rebuilt to design by Roberts, 1889 Image:Plough chapel, Brecon (geograph 3479604).jpg|Plough Lane chapel, Brecon Image:Hyfrydle Chapel,Holyhead (geograph 4164116).jpg|Hyfrydle, Holyhead Image:Albert Hall, Llandrindod Wells - geograph.org.uk - 1551963.jpg|Albert Hall, Llandrindod Wells File:Former Friends Meeting House, Llandrindod Wells (geograph 4921565).jpg|Former Quaker Meeting House, Llandrindod Wells (by Owen Morris Roberts & Son, 1897) Image:Rehoboth Chapel, Nant Peris (geograph 2894286).jpg|Rehoboth, Nant Peris, rebuilt by Roberts in 1876 File:Penuel, Eglwys y Bedyddwyr, Rhosllanerchrugog - geograph.org.uk - 830205.jpg|Penuel, Rhos; facade by Roberts, 1891 File:Capel Moreia Morfa Nefyn - geograph.org.uk - 533118.jpg|Moreia, Morfa Nefyn (1882) File:Ambrose Memorial Chapel, Porthmadog NLW3362112.jpg|Capel Coffa Emrys, Porthmadog (1878; demolished c.1985) File:Capel Horeb, Brynsiencyn (geograph 1874556).jpg|Horeb, Brynsiencyn (1881) File:SALEM, Eglwys yr Annibynnwyr, Caernarfon - geograph.org.uk - 163370.jpg|Salem Welsh Independent Chapel, Caernarfon; a design by Thomas Thomas extended and remodelled with flanking stair towers by Roberts in 1891 ==References== Category:Welsh architects Category:1832 births Category:1896 deaths Category:People from Birkenhead Category:British ecclesiastical architects ",
