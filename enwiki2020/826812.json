    "text": "Fay Weldon CBE, FRSL (born 22 September 1931) is an English author, essayist and playwright. ==Early life== Weldon was born Franklin Birkinshaw in Birmingham, England, in 1931, to a literary family. Her maternal grandfather, Edgar Jepson (1863\u20131938), her uncle Selwyn Jepson and her mother Margaret Jepson wrote novels (the latter sometimes under the nom de plume Pearl Bellairs, from the name of a character in Aldous Huxley's short story \"Farcical History of Richard Greenow\"). Weldon grew up in Christchurch, New Zealand, where her father, Frank Thornton Birkinshaw, worked as a doctor. In 1937, when she was six, her parents divorced. She and her sister Jane spent the summers with her father, first in Coromandel, later in Auckland. She attended Christchurch Girls' High School for two years from 1944. Weldon has described herself as a \"plump, cheerful child\", stating in a blog post that began as an unpublished article for the Daily Mail: \"I was born large, blonde and big-boned into a family of small beautiful women. My mother thought it was unlikely that anyone would marry me, and therefore I would have to pass exams, earn my own living and make my own way in the world. Or that\u2019s what I thought she thought.\" She goes on to explain how this view of herself affected her later writing career. \"I\u2019d be happier to have been be seen as a skinny, feisty child, a slim and serious adult, and a handsome octogenarian with an interesting literary past. But that was not to be, despite a lifetime of diets. It was however a state of affairs which made me write a good few novels with overweight, plain women as their heroines. I\u2019ve always been on their side \u2013 they are the unseen majority.\" In September 1946, when she was 15, she returned to England with her mother and sister. She recalls: \"I was a literary groupie from the antipodes...Not that I had any intention of being a writer at the time \u2013 too much like hard work. All I wanted was to get married and have babies.\" She did not see her father again before his death in 1949. In England Weldon won a scholarship to the all-girls South Hampstead High School, before going on to study psychology and economics at the University of St Andrews, Scotland. Later she recalled attending classes with the moral philosopher Malcolm Knox, who \"spoke exclusively to the male students, maintaining that women were incapable of moral judgement or objectivity.\" She completed her MA in 1952 and moved to London, where she worked as a clerk at the Foreign Office for a salary of six pounds a week. ==Early career== Weldon had temporary jobs as a waitress and hospital ward orderly before working as a clerk for the Foreign Office where she wrote pamphlets to be dropped in Eastern Europe as part of the Cold War. She had to leave this job after she became pregnant. Later she took a job with Crawford's Advertising Agency, where she worked with the writer Elizabeth Smart, and where she could earn enough to support herself and her young son (Nicolas). As head of copywriting at Ogilvy, Benson & Mather, she was responsible for publicising (but not originating) the phrase \"Go to work on an egg\". She coined the slogan \"Vodka gets you drunker quicker,\" saying in a Guardian interview: \"It just seemed ... to be obvious that people who wanted to get drunk fast needed to know this.\" Her bosses disagreed and suppressed it. ==Literary career== ===Writing career=== Gerard Casey on British television discussion programme After Dark in 1997 In 1963 Weldon began writing for radio and television. In 1967, her first novel, The Fat Woman's Joke was published. \"When I submitted my first novel in 1966 it was accepted without demur. I thought this was because I was a wonderful writer, But it wasn't. It was because I had learned to have nothing turned down.\" She subsequently built a very successful and prolific career, publishing over thirty novels, collections of short stories, films for television, newspaper and magazine articles and becoming a well-known face and voice on the BBC. She has described herself as a \"writeaholic\". In 1971 Weldon wrote the first episode of the landmark television series Upstairs, Downstairs, [170] for which she won a Writers Guild award for Best British TV Series Script. In 1980 Weldon wrote the screenplay for director/producer John Goldschmidt's television movie Life for Christine, which told the true story of a 15-year-old girl's life imprisonment. The film was shown in prime-time on the ITV Network by Granada Television. She also wrote the screenplay for the 1980 BBC miniseries adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul. In 1989, she contributed to the book for the Petula Clark West End musical Someone Like You. Weldon's most celebrated work is her 1983 novel The Life and Loves of a She-Devil, which she wrote at the age of 52. Her novel The Hearts and Lives of Men was written and published in serial form, appearing in the British magazine Woman between 1 February and 15 November 1986. She told The New York Times, \"It was written as the Dickens novels were written....You made it up as you went along, confined by the structure of the story, which is going to go on for you don't know how long\u2014but you have to be able to bring it to an end with three weeks' warning.\" ===Other literary activities=== In 1996, she was a member of the jury at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival. She was also chair of judges for the 1983 Booker Prize. The judging for that prize produced a draw between J. M. Coetzee's Life & Times of Michael K and Salman Rushdie's Shame, leaving Weldon to choose between the two. According to Stephen Moss in The Guardian, \"Her arm was bent and she chose Rushdie\" only to change her mind as the result was being phoned through. Weldon was appointed Professor of Creative Writing at Brunel University in West London in 2006: \"A great writer needs a certain personality and a natural talent for language, but there is a great deal that can be taught \u2013 how to put words together quickly and efficiently to make a point, how to be graceful and eloquent, how to convey emotion, how to build up tension, and how to create alternative worlds.\" In 2012 Weldon she was appointed Professor of Creative Writing at Bath Spa University, where she shares an office with Professor Maggie Gee. Weldon serves together with Daniel Pipes as the most notable foreign members of the board of the Danish Press Freedom Society (Trykkefrihedsselskabet). ===Awards=== * Writers' Guild Award for the pilot of the original TV programme Upstairs Downstairs (1973) * The Man Booker Prize Best Novel nominee (1979) for Praxis * Society of Authors Travelling Scholarship (1980) * Winner of the Los Angeles Times Fiction Prize for The Heart of the Country (1989) * Whitbread Prize Best Novel nominee (1996) for Worst Fears * PEN/Macmillan Silver Pen Award (1996) for Wicked Women * Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) 2001 ===Feminism=== A self-declared feminist, Weldon's work features what she has described as \"overweight, plain women\" \u2013 as she has deliberately sought, she has said, to write about and give a voice to women who are often overlooked or not featured in the media. She says there were many reasons why she became a feminist, including \"appalling\" lack of equal opportunities and the myth that women were supported by male relatives. \"What drove me to feminism fifty years ago was the myth that men were the breadwinners and women kept house and looked pretty.\" She notes that the turning point for her, however, was the outright sexism in the media industry at that time, such as when she attended a casting session of a TV drama she had written and watched the male director and producer \"...cast the lead by flicking through Spotlight and just choosing the girl they both most fancied. And they were amazed when I objected: female skill, talent, experience, intelligence meant nothing to them\". ==Personal life== In 1953, while working at the Foreign Office, Weldon became pregnant by a musician she met who was moonlighting as a doorman. She has said that while she wanted the child (son Nicolas), she decided she did not want the father. In 1957, tired of struggling to support herself as a single mother, she married Ronald Bateman, a headmaster 25 years her senior.Saner, Emine, \"'I'm the only feminist there is \u2013 the others are all out of step'\", The Guardian, 22 August 2009. They lived together in Acton, London, for two years, until the marriage ended. In 1961, at 29 Weldon met her second husband, Ron Weldon, a jazz musician and antiques dealer.Grice, Elizabeth, \"Fay Weldon: 'Dying? I don't want to do that again'\", Daily Telegraph, 12 March 2009. They married in 1963 when Fay was heavily pregnant with her second son Dan (born 1963). They lived in East Compton, Somerset, later having two more sons, Tom (1970) and Sam (1977). It was while she was pregnant with Dan that Weldon began writing for radio and television. During her marriage to Ron Weldon, the couple visited therapists regularly. In 1992 Ron left Fay for his astrological therapist, who had told him that the couple's astrological signs were incompatible. They began divorce proceedings, although Ron died in 1994, just eight hours before the divorce was finalised. In 1994 Weldon married Nick Fox, a poet who is also her manager, with whom she currently lives in Dorset. In 2000 Weldon became a member of the Church of England and was confirmed in St Paul's Cathedral. She states that she likes to think that she was \"converted by St Paul\".Weldon, Fay, \"Converted by St Paul\", in Caroline Chartres (ed.), Why I Am Still an Anglican, Continuum, 2006, p. 134. ==Controversies== In a 1998 interview for the Radio Times Weldon claimed that rape \"isn't the worst thing that can happen to a woman if you're safe, alive and unmarked after the event.\"\"Fay Weldon: Rape isn't the worst thing that can happen \", BBC News, 30 June 1998. She was roundly condemned by feminists for this assertion. In 2000, Weldon's novel The Bulgari Connection became notorious for its product placement, naming the jewellers not only in the title but another 33 times, while a minimum of 12 times was stipulated in the \u00a318,000 contract. Weldon has defended the so-called \"Snowflake Generation\", saying: \"We should stop being beastly to the snowflakes.... Today\u2019s young grow up into a violent, angry, unstable environment, all too likely to end up jobless, homeless and childless, unlikely to reach their full potential. They are probably the most despairing generation ever conceived. The least we can do is not add to their burden by slagging them off.\" ==Literary works== ===Novels=== *The Fat Woman's Joke (1967) *Down Among the Women (1971) *Words of Advice (1974) *Little Sisters (1975) *Female Friends (1975) *Remember Me (1976) *Praxis (1978) *Puffball (1980) *The President's Child (1982) *The Shrapnel Academy (1986) *The Heart of the Country (1987) *The Hearts and Lives of Men (1987) *Leader of the Band (1988) *The Cloning of Joanna May (1989) *Darcy's Utopia (1990) *Growing Rich (1992) *Life Force (1992) *Question of Timing (1992) *Affliction (1994) *Splitting (1995) *Worst Fears (1996) *Big Women (1997) *Rhode Island Blues (2000) *The Bulgari Connection (2000) *Mantrapped (2004) *She May Not Leave (2006) *The Spa Decameron (2007) *The Stepmother's Diary (2008) *Chalcot Crescent (2009) *Kehua!
