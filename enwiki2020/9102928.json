    "text": "PEKA, \"Politiki Epitropi Kypriakou Agona\" (The Political Committee of the Cypriot Struggle), was the political wing of the EOKA movement which fought against the British and Turkish Cypriots for the union of Cyprus with Greece between 1955 and 1959. It was founded in the summer of 1956 with the specific aims to: 1\\. Co-ordinate the political and military struggle. 2\\. Raise the morale of the Greek-Cypriot people. 3\\. Enlighten world public opinion as to the struggle, its origin and its aims. 4\\. Keep Greek-Cypriots united in their demand for Enosis. The organisation was first headed by Renos Lysiotis, who was succeeded by Michalis Maratheftis, and finally in 1958 by Tassos Papadopoulos, former President of Cyprus. Category:EOKA ",
