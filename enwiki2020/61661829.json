    "text": "The cathedral Interior Halle Cathedral () is the oldest surviving church in the old part of the city Halle, Saale. Beside it resided the Archbishop of Magdeburg, who ruled the city for a long period. Albert of Brandenburg remodelled the church's exterior from 1520 onwards and built the neighbouring Neue Residenz, aiming to make the church one of the most influential and powerful monasteries north of the Alps. ==History== It was founded as a Dominican monastery in 1271 and completed in 1330, with a simple three-aisle abbey church dedicated to Sankt Paul zum heiligen Kreuz (the order's rules prohibited a tower or a separate choir). Around 1520 the then-archbishop Albert of Brandenburg had Bastian Binder remodel the church's exterior, adding rounded gables. It was reconsecrated in 1523 as the Stiftskirche of the Archdiocese. It was probably first referred to as a 'Dom' or cathedral at that time, although it was never the seat of the archbishopric. From 1523 onwards Albert also took on artists to improve the interior, commissioning The Meeting of St Erasmus and St Maurice from Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald, altarpieces from Lucas Cranach the Elder and stone sculptures by Peter Schro. Between 1519 and 1525 Cranach and his workshop produced 16 altarpieces for the church with a total of 140 panels, though only two central panels, some wings and a few sketches survive.

As an opponent of Martin Luther, Albert was forced out of Halle in 1541 and took the church's portable fittings with him to Aschaffenburg, where they remain. His secular successors as rulers of the area used the church as a chapel for their court and palace. The last such ruler, Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, added galleries and a larger altar in the mid 17th century, altering the church's style to early Baroque. In 1680 Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg made it a parish church (by then the area was Protestant-Reformed) and in 1702 a young Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel was employed there for a year's probationary period. The first abbess of the 'Freiweltliches adeliges von Jena\u2019sches Fr\u00e4uleinstift' was appointed in the church in 1703, the order having been founded by Gottfried von Jena with royal Prussian approval the previous year. The abbesses were also buried in the churchJohann Christoph von Dreyhaupt: Pagus Neletici Et Nudzici..., Halle 1750, S. 239, Ziff 43; Google Books. The interior was 're-Gothicised' between 1883 and 1896 and the outer walls and interior were restored by the Denkmalpflege between 1957 and 1959. The Domstiftung Sachsen-Anhalt began a full renovation of the church in 1996, with work largely completed by 2005. == Description== ==Organs== === Main organ=== W\u00e4ldner organ In 1851 the parish replaced the church's baroque organ with a new instrument built by Friedrich Wilhelm W\u00e4ldner and August Ferdinand W\u00e4ldner, who had begun work on the instrument four years earlier. === Choir organ=== == Bibliography (in German) == * Heinrich L.
