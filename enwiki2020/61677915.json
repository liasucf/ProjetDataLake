    "text": "The 2007\u201308 Leyton Orient F.C. season was the 109th season in the history of Leyton Orient Football Club, their 92nd in the Football League, and second consecutive season in the third tier of the English football league system.Kaufman, N.K. & Ravenhill, A.E., \"Leyton Orient: The Complete Record\", Breedon Books, 2006. == Season summary == Having finished in 20th place, one spot above the relegation zone, most of the side that won the club promotion in 2006 left at the end of the season. Some players were released, some declined new contracts and the club's longest-serving player Matthew Lockwood was re-signed but later moved in pre-season to Nottingham Forest. The O's began the 2007-08 season in fine form, winning seven of their first nine games in all competitions. Orient were top of the table at the beginning of October and were in the top seven until after Christmas, though a loss of form in the second half of the season, recording only three wins from the last 12 games, meant the season ended in a respectable 14th placed finish with 60 points. == Competitions == === League One === ==== Table ==== ==== Results Summary ==== === FA Cup === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Round !Date !Opponent !Venue !Result !Attendance !Scorers !Notes ! |- style=\"background:#f3f3f3;\" | style=\"text- align:center;\" |1 |10 November |Bristol Rovers |Home | style=\"text- align:center;\" |1\u20131 | style=\"text-align:center;\" |3,157 |Gray (16) | |Report |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" |1 (Replay) |20 November |Bristol Rovers |Away | colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |Postponed (Waterlogged pitch) |- style=\"background:#f3f3f3;\" | style=\"text-align:center;\" |1 (Replay) |27 November |Bristol Rovers |Away | style=\"text-align:center;\" |3\u20133 | style=\"text-align:center;\" |3,742 |Boyd (28, 92 pen.), Gray (55) |Lost 6\u20135 on penalties |Report |} === League Cup === === Football League Trophy === == Squad == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width:70%;\" ! style=\"background:#FF0000; color:white; text-align:center;\" | ! style=\"background:#FF0000; color:white; text-align:center;\" |Name ! style=\"background:#FF0000; color:white; text-align:center;\" |Nat ! style=\"background:#FF0000; color:white; text-align:center;\" |Position ! style=\"background:#FF0000; color:white; text-align:center;\" |Date of birth (Age) ! style=\"background:#FF0000; color:white; text-align:center;\" |Signed from ! style=\"background:#FF0000; color:white; text-align:center;\" |Note |- ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\" |Goalkeepers |- |1 |Stuart Nelson | |GK | |Brentford | |- |12 |Glenn Morris | |GK | |none | |- ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\" |Defenders |- |2 |Stephen Purches | |RB | |AFC Bournemouth | |- |3 |Charlie Daniels | |LB | | colspan=\"2\" |on loan from Tottenham Hotspur |- |4 |Alton Thelwell | |CB | |Hull City | |- |5 |Tamika Mkandawire | |CB | |Hereford United | |- |6 |Brian Saah | |CB | |none | |- |8 |Adam Chambers | |RB | |Kidderminster Harriers | |- |15 |Sam Oji | |CB | |Birmingham City | |- |19 |Aiden Palmer | |LB | |none | |- |20 |Jason Demetriou | |RB | |none | |- |23 |Clayton Fortune | |CB | |Bristol City | |- |25 |Tom Kemp | |CB | |none | |- |27 |Chris Robson | | | |none | |- ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\" |Midfielders |- |7 |John Melligan | |CM | |Cheltenham Town | |- |10 |Sean Thornton | |CM | |Doncaster Rovers | |- |11 |Wayne Corden | |W | |Scunthorpe United | |- |17 |Paul Terry | |DM | |Yeovil Town | |- |24 |Solomon Shields | | | |none | |- |26 |Jack Page | | | |none | |- |29 |Loick Pires | |W | |none | |- ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center;\" |Forwards |- |9 |Wayne Gray | |CF | |Yeovil Town | |- |14 |Andy Barcham | |CF | | colspan=\"2\" |on loan from Tottenham Hotspur |- |16 |Jabo Ibehre | |CF |28 January 1983 |none | |- |18 |Adam Boyd | |CF | |Luton Town | |- |21 |Efe Echanomi | |CF | |none | |- |22 |Raphael Sylvester | |CF | |none | |- |28 |Bradley Gray | |CF | |none | |} == References == Category:Leyton Orient F.C. seasons ",
