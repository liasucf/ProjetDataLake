    "text": "The Piedmontese regional election of 1980 took place on 8 June 1980. ==Events== Christian Democracy resulted narrowly ahead of the Italian Communist Party. After the election, the Italian Communist Party and the Italian Socialist Party decided to continue their political cooperation and formed a coalition government with the PSDI under the leadership of Socialist Enzo Enrietti. However in 1983 the Socialists switched sides and Aldo Viglione, a Socialist who had been President of the Region from 1975 to 1980, formed a new regional government with the Christian Democrats, the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, the Italian Liberal Party and the Italian Republican Party (Pentapartito). ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:95%\" |- bgcolor=\"EFEFEF\" !colspan=2| Party ! votes ! votes (%) ! seats |- | bgcolor=white| | Christian Democracy | align=right|956,356 | align=right|32.4 | align=right|20 |- | bgcolor=red| | Italian Communist Party | align=right|932,888 | align=right|31.7 | align=right|20 |- | bgcolor=hotpink| | Italian Socialist Party | align=right|417,763 | align=right|14.2 | align=right|9 |- | bgcolor=pink| | Italian Democratic Socialist Party | align=right|176,412 | align=right|6.0 | align=right|3 |- | bgcolor=blue| | Italian Liberal Party | align=right|174,728 | align=right|5.9 | align=right|3 |- | bgcolor=black| | Italian Social Movement | align=right|117,724 | align=right|4.0 | align=right|2 |- | bgcolor=lime| | Italian Republican Party | align=right|98,155 | align=right|3.3 | align=right|2 |- | bgcolor=darkred| | Proletarian Unity Party | align=right|29,656 | align=right|1.0 | align=right|1 |- | rowspan=2| | Proletarian Democracy | align=right|24,998 | align=right|0.9 | align=right|- |- | Others | align=right|19,158 | align=right|0.6 | align=right|- |- |- bgcolor=\"EFEFEF\" !colspan=2| Total | align=right|2,947,838 | align=right|100.0 | align=right|60 |- ! colspan=5 align=center|File:Piedmont_Council_1980.svg |- | colspan=5 align=center|Largest party by municipality |- ! colspan=5 align=center|File:Piemonte 1980.png |} Source: Ministry of the Interior Category:Elections in Piedmont Category:1980 elections in Italy ",
