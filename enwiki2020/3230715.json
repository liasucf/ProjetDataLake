    "text": "The Suramadu Bridge (), also known as the Surabaya\u2013Madura Bridge, is a cable- stayed bridge between Surabaya on the island of Java and the town of Bangkalan on the island of Madura in Indonesia.Indra Harasputra, 'Special report:Suramadu bridge could last for 100 years', The Jakarta Post, 10 June 2009. Opened in June 2009, the 5.4-km bridge is the longest in Indonesia and the first bridge to cross the Madura Strait. The cable-stayed portion has three spans with lengths , , and . The bridge has two lanes in each direction plus an emergency lane and a dedicated lane for motorcycles in each direction. ==History== ===Early history=== Madura strait in 1952 The idea of a bridge connecting Surabaya with Madura is said to have first been proposed in the early 1960s by the well-known Indonesian engineer Professor Sedyatmo from the Bandung Institute of Technology. Later, in the mid-1980s, there was renewed interest in the project when staff from the Indonesian National Planning Bureau (Bappenas, or Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional Republik Indonesia) met with Japanese aid donors to discuss construction of a bridge.Jack Spotten, 'Iniliah Sejarah Singkat Jembatan Suraamadu Yang Perlu Kita Tahu' (Need to Know: Short history of the Suramadu Bridge), #TandaPagar, 2 January 2016, accessed 22 July 2018. A pre-feasibility study was prepared in early 1990 and in December 1990, President Suharto appointed a team of ministers and advisers to consider plans for the bridge.Presidential Decision (Keputusan Presiden) No 55 of 1990, dated 14 December 1990. Later, a consortium consisting on the Indonesian state-owned firm PT Jasa Marga and other Indonesian firms along with Japanese firms (Mitsubishi Corporation, Itochu, Shimizu, and the Long Term Credit Bank) was established to proceed with the bridge. ===Further developments=== In 1997-98, a range of problems arising from the Asian financial crisis in Indonesia led to suspension of activities. However within a few years the East Java Provincial Government took up a renewed interest in plans and in 2000 announced that further initiatives would be taken at the provincial level. These steps gained impetus when President Megawati issued a decree instructing ministers to take additional steps to support construction of the bridge and appointing PT Jawa Marga as the lead Indonesian firm for the project.Presidential Decision (Keputusan Presiden) No 79 of 1993, dated 27 October 2003. The bridge was built by a consortium of Indonesian companies PT Adhi Karya and PT Waskita Karya working with China Road and Bridge Corp. and China Harbor Engineering Co. Ltd. The total cost of the project, including connecting roads, has been estimated at Rp4.5 trillion (US$445 million). Construction began in August 2003. In July 2004, a girder collapsed, killing one worker and injuring nine others. Work on the bridge halted at the end of 2004 due to lack of funds, but was restarted in November 2005. The main span of the bridge was connected on 31 March 2009 and the bridge was opened to the public on 10 June 2009. Within a week of the opening, it was discovered that nuts and bolts as well as maintenance lamps had been stolen and that there was evidence of vandalism of cables supporting the main span. ==Tariffs== As is often the case with public sector infrastructure facilities in Indonesia, there has been pressure to keep the tariffs for use of the bridge low. Tolls were initially set at Rp30,000 (US$3 in 2009) for four-wheeled vehicles and Rp3,000 (US$0.30) for two- wheelers. However, in early 2016, it was announced that President Jokowi favored a 50% cut in the tolls to help promote the competitiveness of industries on the Madura side of the bridge. No details were available as to how the cuts in the tolls would be funded.Ayomi Amindoni, 'Govt to cut Suramadu Bridge tolls', The Jakarta Post, 4 February 2016. However, a spokesperson for the state-owned company P.T. Jasa Marga which operated the bridge said that the reductions in tariffs would not cause a problem for the operating firm itself because P.T. Jasa Marga was paid directly by the government to manage the bridge.'Govt cuts Suramadu bridge fee by 50 percent', The Jakarta Post, 1 March 2016. From 27 October 2018, toll tariffs were abolished for all types of vehicles. == Bridge Gates == {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Bridge Gate ! KM ! Location !
