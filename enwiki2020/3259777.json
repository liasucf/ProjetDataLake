P. Panaitescu, Cronicile slavo-rom\u00e2ne din secolele XV- XVI, publicate de Ion Bogdan, Editura Academiei Romane, Bucure\u0219ti, 1959, p. 44-48 was Voivode (Prince) of Moldavia from November 1399 to June 1400. According to one hypothesis, he may have been the Lithuanian prince George Koriatovich. Other hypotheses posit him as the son of Roman I of Moldavia (1391\u20131394) and an unknown wife, possibly of Lithuanian extraction from descendants of Karijotas, confused with the Lithuanian prince because of the similar name and background. The nickname \"the Crippled\" can be found only in the chronicle of Putna Monastery, drafted in the first years of the 16th century, but its origins are unknown. The reasons why he has remained in history with this nickname are not known precisely (probably suffered from a disease that makes it difficult to move). ==Biography== Iuga Ologul was the second son of Moldovan regnant Roman Mu\u0219at and Anastasia Mushat. According to some historical sources, Iuga have reigned for a few months.Aceast\u0103 perioad\u0103 poate fi dedus\u0103 din singura atestare documentar\u0103 a lui Iuga Ologul, datat\u0103 din 28 noiembrie 1399, \u0219i prima atestare documentar\u0103 a lui Alexandru cel Bun, urm\u0103torul la tron, datat\u0103 din 29 iunie 1400 (Documenta Romaniae Historica A.

Xenopol, Editura Academiei Republicii Socialiste Rom\u00e2nia, Bucure\u0219ti, 1975) According to other sources, Iuga have ruled for two years.Constantin C. Giurescu, Istoria Rom\u00e2nilor, Ed. ALL Educa\u021bional, Bucure\u0219ti, 2003, I, p. 360 In historical sources, there is a confusion between Iuga Ologul and the Lithuanian prince Yuri Koriatovich (sometimes named as Jurg Coriatovici or Iurie Koriatovici) of Podolia. This confusion is due to the fact that the name Iuga is a locally adapted version of the Ruthenian name Yuri. In fact, it is assumed that Iuga Ologul was baptized in honor of this prince, since he was the son of Roman the Ist and of his first wife, the Lithuanian princes of Koriatovites origin, the rulers of Podolia.Documenta Romaniae Historica A.

Moldova, vol. I (1384-1475), Institutul de Istorie \u0219i Arheologie A.D. Xenopol, Editura Academiei Republicii Socialiste Rom\u00e2nia, Bucure\u0219ti, 1975, p. 11-12 probably giving up for health reasons. It is assumed that Stephen the I-st appointed Iuga Ologul as successor, since his children, Bogdan and Stephen (recalled only in the bead roll ( \"pomelnik\") of St. Nicholas Monastery, Probota Veche, founded by their father) were too young succeed the throne and the boyars had a great influence in the country's politics and could have imposed their own candidate. Iuga Ologul was challenged from the very beginning, by his stepbrother Alexander, who at his father's death had fled together with his brother Bogdan, according to a source at Curtea de Arge\u0219 (under his protection Mircea cel Batrin, Lord of Wallachia).Nicolae Grigora\u0219, \u021aara Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 a Moldovei de la \u00eentemeierea statului p\u00e2n\u0103 la \u0218tefan cel Mare (1359-1457), Ia\u0219i, 1978, p. 74-77 The documents of that time, pointed out that Mircea Voda entered to Moldova, leading the army and installed Alexandru for reigning. Iuga had been taken as hostage to Wallachia,Constantin Rezachevici, Mircea cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n \u0219i Moldova, \u00een \"Revista de istorie\", XXXIX, nr. 8, Bucure\u0219ti, 1986, p. 754-755Constantin Rezachevici, Mircea cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n \u0219i lumea rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 a vremii sale, \u00een \"Magazin istoric\", nr. 9, Bucure\u0219ti, 1986, p. 9-10 where he died January 7, 1403 (when Alexandru cel Bun did not mention him \u201c holy dead of before\") and in 1407, in the Bistri\u021ba Monastery, he was recorded as dead. From the rule of Iuga Voda Ologul, on November 28, 1399, it also appears that he was married and had offspring (\"this is my belief, Iuga voivode, and the faith of my children, and the faith of Stephen the Voivode and his children , the faith of his brothers, the belief of Olecsandro, the belief of Bogdan ... \"Documenta Romaniae Historica A.

His funeral probably took place in Wallachia, but until now, it is not known where he was buried. . ==See also== ==References== Category:Rulers of Moldavia ",
