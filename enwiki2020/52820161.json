    "text": "The Indian 50 paisa coin, popularly called Athanni is a former denomination of the Indian Rupee. The 508px coin equals of the Indian Rupee. The symbol for paisa is (8px). ==History== Prior to 1957, Indian rupee was not decimalised and the rupee from 1835 to 1957 AD was further divided into 16 annas. Each anna was further divided to four type Indian pices and each pice into three Indian pies till 1947 when the pie was demonetized. In 1955, India amended the \"Indian Coinage Act\" to adopt the metric system for coinage. Paisa coins were introduced in 1957, but from 1957 to 1964 the coin was called \"Naya Paisa\" (English: New Paisa). On 1 June 1964, the term \"Naya\" was dropped and the denomination was simply called \"One paisa\". Paisa coins were issued as a part of \"The Decimal Series\". In 2019, the new coins of Indian rupee were adopted, but the 50 paise coins were not minted as they have ceased to be in circulation. ==See also== * Indian paisa ==References== Category:Half-base- unit coins Category:Coins of India Category:Fifty-cent coins ",
