According to his biographer Valerius Andreas, Opmeer was a friend of \"painters, sculptors and architects\", including Maarten van Heemskerck, Pieter Aertsen, Willem Danielsz van Tetrode, Frans Floris, Antonis Mor and Philip Galle. ==Life== Petrus was born in Amsterdam on 13 September 1526, the son of Pieter van Opmeer and Maria van Akersloot. Throughout his life he demonstrated a great love of learning, and had the family resources to pursue his interests. He was initially educated in Amsterdam at the school run by Alard van Amsterdam and Nicolaas Cannius, spent time in Leuven, and went to Tournai to learn French and mathematics. At the age of 19 he married Sophia Sasbout, and went to Delft to study Greek with Petrus Resenius, rector of the Latin school. He was studying civil and canon law at Leuven University when the Dutch Revolt broke out, prompting him to switch to theology. After the murder of Cornelis Musius, Opmeer offered his services to the Army of Flanders, and was an appointed a secretary to the Council of War by Francisco de Valdez. After the Siege of Leiden he returned to his native Amsterdam until the city was lost to the rebels in 1578 and Catholic worship was prohibited. He then moved to Delft and lived there the rest of his life, dying on 4 November 1594 and being buried in the Oude Kerk. His son, Petrus Opmeer the Younger, published a number of his writings posthumously.A.
