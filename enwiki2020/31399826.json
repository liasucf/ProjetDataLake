VVherein they that either want leisure to read, or that haue not iudgement to conceiue, or that are not able to buie the learned treatises of other concerning particular points of religion, may yet euidently see poperie not to be of God, and our religion to be acceptable in his sight. Very necessarie for these times, for the confirmation and strengthening of men in our religion, that neither by Iesuits, nor by any other, they may be drawne to poperie, or any other heresie or sect: and likewise for the winning of Papists and atheists to an vnfained liking and true profession of our religion.

See at Umich/eebo (Login only). * The Dignitie of God's Children (1610)The Dignitie of God's Children: or an exposition of 1 John iii. 1, 2, 3, plentifully showing the comfortable ... and most blessed state of all God's children, and also ... the base ... condition of all other that are not the children of God (Printed by Thomas Haueland, for Thomas Man, and are to be sold at his shop in Paternoster Row, at the signe of the Talbot, London 1610). * Two profitable treatises (1616)Two profitable treatises: I. Of Davids love to the word: II. Of Dauids meditation on the word of God. The one shewing the excellencie of the word, and therefore worthy of the love of all men: and what be the trials and testimonies; as likewise the impediments and helpes of the said love. The other shewing the necessitie of the continuall meditation of the word by all men that will bee saved: and that as well for knowledge as for practice and obedience: removing likewise the things that may hinder, and laying forth the things that may further the said meditation of the word, either generally by all men, or particularly by ministers of the word (Printed by Edward Griffin for Arthur Iohnson dwelling in Pauls Church-yard at the signe of the White horse, London 1616).

Or, a logicall and theologicall exposition of the two first verses of the twelfth to the Romanes, with all the doctrine in the said two verses, plainly laid forth, and fitly applied according as these times do require the same. Wherein also besides the orthodoxall exposition of the said words, diuers other places of Scripture by the way occurring, before somewhat obscure, are so naturally interpreted, as that the iudicious reader shall thinke his paines well bestowed in vouchsafing to reade this treatise following.

The Generall Treatise against Poperie was dedicated to Robert, Lord Rich, with a letter to his readers including friends in Kent, London, Essex and Suffolk. The Two Profitable Treatises were dedicated to the Mayor and Jurats of Sandwich, were published in London in 1616, and were dated by Stoughton from St Bartholomew's Hospital in Sandwich. The Christians Sacrifice (dedicated to Robert (2nd) Earl of Warwick, and Baron of Leez, and to his son Robert, Lord Rich) contains \"The Authors Postscript to his children as it were his last will and testament unto them\", dated 22 August 1622. He states he has lived to twice his father's age, and twelve years more. Having seven children then living, he declares he has nothing to leave them but his precepts. \"Let none of you be grieved that I have left you nothing of my inheritance in Kent, neither of my lands since, that I purchased in Suffolke, as also in Essex, all being now gone, and the price thereof spent: not riotously or otherwise lewdly, but by other meanes.\"Stoughton, The Christians Sacrifice, Postscript, pp. 252-58 (Google). == Life == ===University=== John Stoughton reached university age while his father was still in East Anglia, and entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1607, where he was tutored by William Sancroft the elder, uncle of Archbishop Sancroft.F.J. Bremer, Congregational Communion: Clerical Friendship in the Anglo-American Puritan Community, 1610\u20131692, New England Studies (Northeastern University Press, Boston 1994), p. 31, referring to Letter of 1615 in Harleian MSS 3785 no. 29. Graduating B.A. in 1611 and M.A. in 1614, he was elected a Fellow of the college in 1616. His ordination as priest is probably that recorded in December 1617, performed by Samuel Harsnett:CCEd Ordination Record ID: 194231. he took the degree of Bachelor of Divinity in 1621.Alumni Cantabrigienses Part I Vol. 4, p. 171. In the following year his father died, but by this time John was well-established in his university position. In 1623, when the Master of Emmanuel, John Preston (admitted 1622), sought confirmation of a college statute concerning the requirements for his residency, John Stoughton's signature headed the list of Fellows' names who certified their formal response in two separate orders.E.S. Shuckburgh, Emmanuel College, Cambridge College Histories (F.E. Robinson & Co., London 1904), pp. 58-60 (Internet Archive). He was considered a preacher of unusual eloquence. Two notable sermons given by him in 1624, reflecting political circumstances of the time, concern the theme of marriage. Early in 1623/24 he preached at Paul's Cross in London The Love-Sick Spouse, on a text of lament from the Canticles interpreted to signify the separation of Christ from His true Church. The Song of Solomon was a rich source for contemporary theological exegesis directed against the threat to protestantism posed by royal marital alliance with Roman Catholic Spain or France. Stoughton quoted many classical and patristic sources in his exposition. About ten months later, in The Happinesse of Peace preached during a royal visitation to Cambridge, he spoke to like point before a courtly audience which cannot have missed his meaning.J.

John Stoughton succeeded him as Rector in 1624 and married his widow Mary (n\u00e9e Machell). Here he developed connections with Sir Thomas and Dame Margaret Wroth of Petherton Park, who were highly active in colonial enterprises in North America. Dame Margaret, cousin of Robert Rich and sister of Sir Nathaniel Rich, and probably a near relation of Dr. Stoughton's wife,For this connection see D. Richardson, ed. K.J.

Dr Stoughton's wide circle of correspondence reflected his involvement in, or support for, the propagation and unification of international Protestantism.
