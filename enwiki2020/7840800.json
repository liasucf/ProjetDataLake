    "text": "An artist performing on an August F\u00f6rster piano in 2015 August F\u00f6rster is a piano manufacturing company (also rendered \"Foerster,\" occasionally \"Forster,\" officially \"August F\u00f6rster GmbH Kunsthandwerklicher Fl\u00fcgel-und-Pianobau\") that currently has a staff of 40 employees and produces around 120 grand pianos and 150 uprights per year. ==History== On April 1, 1859, August F\u00f6rster opened a small piano workshop in L\u00f6bau, Germany, expanding to a factory on L\u00f6bau's Jahn Street in 1862.\"Geschichte\" , Official Website of August F\u00f6rster GmbH, 2005. Accessed April 11, 2009.\"F\u00f6rster\", Grove Music Online, 2009. Accessed 19 April 2009. (subscription required) Still in use today, this facility has been enlarged and modernized by the F\u00f6rster family and remains the exclusive site for the manufacture of the original August F\u00f6rster piano. In 1897, Caesar F\u00f6rster succeeded his father August as manager of the company and opened a second factory in Ji\u0159\u00edkov, Bohemia (later Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic) in 1900. The owner Franz C\u00e4sar F\u00f6rster was awarded an imperial and royal warrant of appointment to the court of Austria-Hungary. Vierling-F\u00f6rster piano In 1937 the company manufactured one of the first electric pianos, the \u201cVierling-F\u00f6rster\u201d piano, developed by Oskar Vierling at the Heinrich Institute for Oscillation Research at the Technical University of Berlin using electromagnetic pickups.Wolfgang Voigt, \u201cOskar Vierling, ein Wegbereiter der Elektroakustik f\u00fcr den Musikinstrumentenbau>\u201d, in: Das Musikinstrument vol. 37, No 1/2, 1988, 214-221, No. 2/3,172-176. In 1948 the factory in Ji\u0159\u00edkov was nationalized. Under new state-sanctioned management many pianos of good quality were produced, but since 1948 the Czechoslovak-made pianos have had no connection or relationship to the German August F\u00f6rster piano. This \"other\" August F\u00f6rster is currently produced in the Czech Republic by the Petrof Piano Company and sold in Canada and certain European countries. In 1972, the final phase of East German nationalization transformed the company into the state- owned \"VEB Fl\u00fcgel-und-Pianobau L\u00f6bau.\" Although still under the management of Wolfgang F\u00f6rster, the company was annexed as part of the German Piano-Union, Leipzig. The family name was added back into the official company name in 1976, resulting in instruments branded \"VEB F\u00f6rster Pianos L\u00f6bau.\" Also in 1976, the company began its first exports to the United States. ==Noted Customers== Many prominent musicians have favored the German-made F\u00f6rster piano. Among them have been Richard Strauss and Sergei Prokofiev, both owners of F\u00f6rster pianos, and Giacomo Puccini, who wrote a number of his operas while working at a F\u00f6rster piano. Robert Fischer, Alex Duke and Anton Kuerti are also noted for their regard of the August F\u00f6rster piano. ==Awards== F\u00f6rster pianos have won many awards for quality and tone, including the \"Verleihung der Goldmedaille f\u00fcr den Rokokofl\u00fcgel\" in 1987. In The Piano Book by Larry Fine, the German-made August F\u00f6rster piano receives the highest possible rating in the areas of performance, quality control, and confidence (Fine's term for general durability). In his \"High Quality Performance Pianos\" category, Fine ranks the modern August F\u00f6rster piano as just below such internationally respected instruments as C. Bechstein, Grotrian, and B\u00f6sendorfer. In addition, Fine praises the modern F\u00f6rster piano for its \"remarkable bass,\" and also comments on a particular \"responsiveness\" of the Renner action when observed in the F\u00f6rster application. ==In popular culture== An August F\u00f6rster piano was seen by audiences worldwide as the featured instrument in the movie The Pianist. ==Current Grand Piano Models== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
