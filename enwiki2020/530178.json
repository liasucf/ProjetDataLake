    "text": "The G3 (Gewehr 3) is a 7.62\u00d751mm NATO, select-fire battle rifle developed in the 1950s by the German armament manufacturer Heckler & Koch (H&K;) in collaboration with the Spanish state-owned design and development agency CETME (Centro de Estudios T\u00e9cnicos de Materiales Especiales). ==History== The origin of this rifle can be traced back to the final years of World War II when Mauser engineers at the Light Weapon Development Group (Abteilung 37) at Oberndorf am Neckar designed the Maschinenkarabiner Ger\u00e4t 06 ( MKb Ger\u00e4t 06, \"machine carbine device 06\") prototype assault rifle chambered for the intermediate 7.92\u00d733mm Kurz cartridge, first with the Ger\u00e4t 06 model using a roller-locked short recoil mechanism originally adapted from the MG 42 machine gun but with a fixed barrel and conventional gas-actuated piston rod. However, it was realized that with careful attention to the mechanical ratios, the gas system could be omitted. The resultant weapon, Ger\u00e4t 06H (the \"H\" suffix is an abbreviation for halbverriegelt - \"half-locked\") was assigned the designation StG 45(M) (Sturmgewehr 45(M) , assault rifle 45) but was not produced in any significant numbers and the war ended before the first production rifles were completed. The German technicians involved in developing the StG 45(M) were taken to work in France at Centre d'Etudes et d'Armement de Mulhouse (CEAM). The StG 45(M) mechanism was modified by Ludwig Vorgrimler and Theodor L\u00f6ffler at the Mulhouse facility between 1946 and 1949. Three versions were made, chambered in .30 Carbine, 7.92\u00d733 mm Kurz, and the experimental 7.65\u00d735 mm French short cartridge developed by Cartoucherie de Valence in 1948. A 7.5\u00d738 mm cartridge using a partial aluminium bullet was abandoned in 1947. L\u00f6ffler's design, designated Carabine Mitrailleuse Mod\u00e8le 1950, was retained for trials among 12 different prototypes designed by CEAM, MAC, and MAS. Engaged in the Indochina War and being the second NATO contributor, France canceled the adoption of these new weapons for financial reasons. CETME A2b 7.92\u00d740mm CETME M53 developmental prototype In 1950, Vorgrimler moved to Spain where he created the LV-50 rifle chambered for the Kurz cartridge and later, the proprietary 7.92\u00d740mm CETME M53 round. At this point, the rifle was renamed the Modelo 2. The Modelo 2 drew the attention of the West German Bundesgrenzschutz (Border Guards), who sought to re-equip the newly formed national defense forces. Not willing to accept a cartridge outside of the NATO specification, the Germans asked CETME to develop a 7.62\u00d751mm version of the rifle. The resulting CETME Model A was chambered for the 7.62\u00d751mm CETME cartridge which was identical in chamber dimensions but had a reduced-power load compared to the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO round. Further development of the rifle with input from H&K; produced the CETME Model B which received several modifications, including the ability to fire from a closed bolt in both semi- automatic and automatic firing modes, a new perforated sheet metal handguard (the folding bipod had been the foregrip in previous models), improved ergonomics and a slightly longer barrel with a 22 mm rifle grenade launcher guide. In 1958, this rifle was accepted into service with the Spanish Army as the Modelo 58, using the 7.62\u00d751mm CETME round. In 1956, the Bundesgrenzschutz canceled their planned procurement of the CETME rifles, adopting the Belgian- made FN FAL as the Gewehr 1 instead. However, the newly formed West German Army (Bundeswehr) now showed interest and soon purchased a number of CETME rifles (7.62\u00d751mm NATO chambering) for further testing. The CETME, known as the Automatisches Gewehr G3 according to German nomenclature, competed successfully against the Swiss SIG SG 510 (G2) and the American AR-10 (G4) to replace the previously favored G1 rifle. In 1956 the Bundeswehr started extended troop trials with 400 CETME rifles. Heckler & Koch made a number of changes to the CETME rifles. In January 1959, the Bundeswehr officially adopted the technically improved CETME proposal. The West German government wanted the G3 rifle to be produced under license in Germany; purchase of the G1 had previously fallen through over FN's refusal to grant such a license. In the case of the G3, the Dutch firm Nederlandse Wapen en Munitiefabriek (NWM) held production and sales rights to the CETME design outside of Spain. To acquire production rights, the West German government offered NWM contracts to supply the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) with 20mm ammunition. Production of the G3 was then assigned to Rheinmetall and H&K.; The latter company already had ties to CETME, and had worked to further optimize the CETME rifle for use with the full-power 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge (as opposed to the downgraded CETME variant). In 1969, Rheinmetall gave up production rights to the G3 in exchange for H&K;'s promise not to bid on MG 3 machine gun production. Later in 1977, the West German government ceded ownership of G3 production and sales rights exclusively to Heckler & Koch. Initial production G3 rifles differed substantially from more recent models; early rifles featured closed-type mechanical flip-up sights (with two apertures), a lightweight folding bipod, a stamped sheet steel handguard, a wooden buttstock (in fixed stock models) or a telescopic metal stock. Before delivery to the Bundeswehr, each G3 went through functional checks, zeroing the sight line and a shooting test at the factory. In the process, five shots were fired at a target at with particularly accurate sighting-in ammunition. The 5-shot group could not exceed (1.2 mil/4.13 MOA) diameter. The weapon was modernized during its service life (among other minor modifications it received new sights, a different flash suppressor, and a synthetic handguard and shoulder stock), resulting in the most recent production models, the G3A3 (with a fixed polymer stock) and the G3A4 (telescoping metal stock). The rifle proved successful in the export market, being adopted by the armed forces of over 40 countries. Of that figure, 18 countries undertook domestic production of the G3 under license. Known manufacturers of the weapon included France (MAS), Greece (Hellenic Arms Industry), Iran (Defense Industries Organization), Luxembourg (Luxemburg Defense Technologie), Mexico, Myanmar, Norway (Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk), Pakistan (Pakistan Ordnance Factories), Portugal (FBP), Saudi Arabia (Military Industries Corporation (Saudi Arabia)), Sweden (Husqvarna Vapenfabrik AB and FFV Carl-Gustaf in Eskilstuna), Thailand, Turkey (MKEK) and the United Kingdom (Royal Ordnance). The Bundeswehr was working on improving their G3 rifles in the 1990s with a brass deflector that deflects spent cartridge cases down and frontwards from the operator and a new polymer pistol-grip/fire-control assembly module that allows better ambidextrous operation of the safety lever when they had their G3 rifles replaced for the Heckler & Koch G36. Currently (2018) hundreds of thousands of G3A3A1, G3A4A1 and G3KA4A1 modernized variants rifles are maintained by Bundeswehr personnel and kept in reserve or are available in military base small arms storages. ==Design details== ===Operating mechanism=== A schematic of the G3 roller- delayed blowback mechanism Cutaway model of the chamber with gas relief flutes (left) and roller-delayed action of the G3 assault rifle The G3 is a selective-fire automatic weapon that employs a roller-delayed blowback operating system. The two-piece bolt assembly consists of a breech (bolt head) and bolt carrier. The bolt is held in battery by two sliding cylindrical rollers that engage locking recesses in the barrel extension. The breech is opened when both rollers are compressed inward against camming surfaces driven by the rearward pressure of the expanding gases upon the bolt head. As the rollers move inward, recoil energy is transferred to the locking piece and bolt carrier which begin to withdraw while the bolt head slowly moves rearward in relation to the bolt carrier. As the bolt carrier clears the rollers, pressure in the bore drops to a safe level, the bolt head is caught by the bolt carrier and moves to the rear as one unit, continuing the operating cycle. Based on the geometric relationship arising from the angles of the roller contact surfaces of the locking piece and the barrel extension recesses, the recoil of the bolt head is delayed by a ratio of 4:1 for the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO chambering. Thus during the same period of time, the bolt head carrier moves 4 times faster than the bolt head. This ratio is continued until the locking rollers have been withdrawn from the barrel extension recesses. The bolt features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface. The \"bolt head locking lever\" is a spring-loaded claw mounted on the bolt carrier that grabs the bolt head as the bolt carrier group goes into battery. The lever essentially ratchets into place with friction, providing enough resistance to being re-opened that the bolt carrier does not rebound. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside the bolt while the lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by the recoiling bolt). ===Features=== Disassembled G3A3 rifle showing its modular design Drehvisier rotating drum sight pictures HK G3 Bayonet with scabbard The G3 is a modular weapon system. Its butt-stock, fore-stock and pistol-grip/fire-control assembly may be changed at will in a variety of configurations (listed below). Simple push-pins hold the components in place and removing them will allow the user to remove and replace parts rapidly. The weapon made extensive use of cost-saving pressed and stamped steel components rather than machined parts and spot welding to connect parts. The stamped sheet metal cocking handle tube and receiver are large exposed parts that are prone to deformation from hard impact as they were designed to be relatively thin to save weight. If dented severely or deep enough during field service reliability problems due to internal parts movement impairments can occur that put the rifle out of action and can not be field solved by the user. To determine and correct such situations armorers are trained to employ specially designed \u201cGO\u201d and symmetry gauges and straightening mandrels to fairly quickly repair such problems.[The Battele Rifle: Development and Use Since World War II by Russel C. Tilstra, Jefferson, North Carolina : McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers, 2014.]G3 Armorer's Manual Instructions for Maintenance and Repair Cal. 7.62 mm \u00d7 51, page 8 ====Trigger==== The rifle is hammer fired and has a trigger mechanism with a 3-position fire selector switch that is also the manual safety toggle that secures the weapon from accidentally discharging (fire selector in the \"E\" or \"1\" position \u2013 single fire mode (Einzelfeuer), \"F\" or \"20\" \u2013 automatic fire (Feuersto\u00df), \"S\" or \"0\" \u2013 weapon is safe (Sicher), trigger disabled mechanically). The weapon can be fitted with an optional four-position safety/fire selector group illustrated with pictograms with an ambidextrous selector lever. The additional, fourth selector setting enables a three-round burst mode of fire. The rifle has a relatively high trigger pull of due to a drop safety requirement. An interchangeable set-trigger pack assembly featuring a trigger stop and less trigger pull is available for the G3SG/1 and other sniping orientated variants. ====Sights==== The original G3 and G3A1 rifle variants had a relatively low iron sight line that consisted of a Klappvisier a \"L-type\" flip up rear sight and hooded front post. From the G2A2 variant the firearm is equipped with a relatively low iron sight line that consists of a Drehvisier a rotary rear drum and hooded front post. The rear sight is mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation with the help of tools. This deliberately prevents non-armorers to (re)zero the iron sight line. The rotary drum features an open V-notch (numbered 1) for rapid target acquisition, close range, low light and impaired visibility use and three apertures (numbered 2, 3 and 4) used for: in increments for more precise aiming. The 1 V-notch and 2 or aperture settings have an identical point of aim. The V-notch and apertures are calibrated for US M80 / German DM111 series or other equivalent 7.62\u00d751mm NATO ball ammunition. The receiver housing has recesses that work with STANAG claw mounts/HK clamp adapters used to mount day or night aiming optics. ====Barrel==== The rifled barrel - four right-hand grooves with a twist rate - terminates with a slotted flash suppressor which can also be used to attach a bayonet or serve as an adapter for launching rifle grenades. From the G3A3 the barrel was free floated from the stock and had polygonal rifling. The barrel chamber is fluted with twelve flutes, which assists in the initial extraction of a spent cartridge casing (since the breech is opened under very high barrel in internal cartridge case pressure). ====Feeding==== The G3A3 (A4) uses either steel (260 g) or aluminium (140 g) 20-round double-stacked straight box magazines, or a 50-round drum magazine. H&K; developed a prototype plastic disposable magazine in the early 1960s, but it was not adopted as aluminum magazines were just as light and proved more durable, as well as easier to produce. ====Accessories==== Standard accessories supplied with the rifle include: a detachable bipod (not included with rifles that have a perforated plastic handguard), sling, cleaning kit and a speed-loading device. Several types of bayonet are available for the G3, but with few exceptions they require an adapter to be inserted into the end of the cocking tube. The most common type features a 6 inch spear-point blade nearly identical with the M7 bayonet, but with a different grip because of its mounting above the barrel. The weapon can also mount a 40 mm HK79 under-barrel grenade launcher, blank firing adapter, a straight blowback bolt (called a \"PT\" bolt, lacks rollers) used for firing 7.62\u00d751mm ammunition with plastic bullets, a conversion kit used for training with .22 Long Rifle ammunition and a sound suppressor (that uses standard ammunition). ==Variants== Original G3 variant with older style flip up sights and wooden furniture G3A2 Freischwinger (FS) G3A4 and G3A3 Bundeswehr soldiers armed with G3A3A1 and G36 rifles in 2010 The G3 served as a basis for many other weapons, among them: the PSG1 and MSG90 precision rifles, the HK11 and HK21 family of light machine guns, a semi-automatic version known as the HK41, a \"sporterized\" model called the SR9 (designed for the civilian market in countries where the HK91 would not qualify, primarily the US after the 1989 importation restrictions) and the MC51 carbine. * G3: Original model based on the CETME Model 58 introduced in 1959 and approved in 1960. It had a wooden stock and handguard. * G3A1: G3 approved in 1963 with a single-position, retractable stock sliding in grooves pressed in the sides of the body, locked by a catch under the special bodycap. This design was chosen after earlier experimentation with an MP-40 style ventrally-folding metal stock; excessive recoil caused it to be dropped from consideration. * G3A2: G3 developed in 1962 with new rotating drum rear sight and a Freischwinger (FS) free-floating barrel that significantly improved accuracy. * G3A3: The most well known 1963 version. Drum sights with an improved front sight, a flash- suppressor/muzzle brake capable of firing NATO standard granades, a fixed solid plastic buttstock, and a plastic handguard that does not contact the free-floating barrel. The handguard came in a slim, ventilated version and a wide version. The latter allows for the attachment of a bipod. * G3A3A1: This is a version of the G3A3 with an ambidextrous trigger group and brass deflector. This is an official German Army designation, not an HK factory one. * G3A4: The G3A4 uses drum sights and a single position, retractable stock. Entered service in 1974 for frontline infantry units. * G3A4A1: This is a variant of the G3A4 with an ambidextrous trigger group and brass deflector. This is an official German Army designation, not an HK factory one. * G3KA4: Smallest of the line, it is a Karabiner, or carbine version of the G3. It uses an HK33 handguard, features drum sights, a retractable stock, and a barrel (reduced in length to the base of the front sight post), that is too short for use with a bayonet or rifle grenades. * G3KA4A1: Variant of the G3KA4 with a polymer grip assembly, ambidextrous trigger group and brass deflector. This is an official German Army designation, not an HK factory one. ===Models made under license=== The G3 rifle is or was produced under license in the following countries: Brazil, France, Mexico, Turkey, Portugal, Sweden, Norway, Greece, Pakistan, Myanmar and Iran. * G3P3: Model number for Pakistani-made version of G3A3. * G3P4: Model number for Pakistani-made version of G3A4. * G3A5: HK assigned model number for the HK-made Danish version of the G3A3. It differs in that it has a silent bolt-closure device. In Danish service it is known as the Gv M/66. The Gv M/66 was originally intended for use with optics as a designated marksman rifle, while the rest of the squad were issued M1 Garands. * G3A6: HK assigned model number for the Iranian-made version of the G3A3. It differs in having a dark-green handguard, stock, and trigger pack. * G3A7: HK assigned model number for the Turkish-made version of the G3A3. * G3A7A1: HK assigned model number for the Turkish-made version of the G3A4. * HSG1: HK assigned model number for the Luxembourg-made version of the G3A3. * BA63: Model number for Myanmar-made version of original G3 (with wooden stock, handguard and flip sight) ===Other military variants and derivatives=== A Norwegian soldier with the licence-built AG-3F2 model fitted with a Br\u00fcgger & Thomet railed foreend, vertical grip and Aimpoint red dot sight G3s made in Pakistan under license ====Denmark==== * Gv M/75: Variant leased from the German Bundeswehr / German government by the Danish government to replace the aging M1 Garands. Originally manufactured by either Rheinmetall or HK for the German Bundeswehr. The Gv M/75 rifles are basically G3's with the old style straight cocking tube as opposed to the later FS (Freischwinger, \"Cantilevered\") variant. The Rheinmetall versions lack an external selector lever and can be converted from semi-automatic to full automatic (or vice versa) by the use of a special tool. ====Myanmar==== * BA63 (Burma Army): Licensed produced G3 by Myanmar stated owned KaPaSa factories in partnership with Fritz Werner Industry Ausrustungen-Gmbh (FRG) and the German Technical Corporation Agencyhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maung_Myoe/publication/272092747_Building_the_Tatmadaw/links/54dac5d50cf2ba88a68de69a/Building- the-Tatmadaw.pdf , Page 106. with licensing rights sold by 1960 with the first 10,000 G3s bought from West Germany (through Rheinmetall) before Burmese factories went operational due to fears that it could align with East Germany. It was the main battle rifle for Myanmar armed forces until they were replaced by MA series 5.56mm assault rifles in 1995. The BA63 is still in service with Myanmar Police Force, People's Militia and ethnic Border Guard Forces. * BA64: Typically known as the G4 in Myanmar armed forces, this is the heavy barreled light machine gun (LMG) version of standard G3A3 with bipod, carrying handle and full metal hand-guard with ventilation ports. Produced by KaPaSa factories in partnership with Fritz Werner Industry Ausrustungen-Gmbh (FRG). As standard, a pair of G4s were issued to every infantry squad in the Myanmar Army. It has now been phased out from in favour of the MA series light machine guns. The BA64 remained in service with Myanmar Police Force, People's Militia and ethnic Border Guard Forces. * BA72: Assault carbine version of G3A4/G3K with shorter barrel and wooden stock. * BA100: A copy of the G3A3ZF sniper rifle. ====Norway==== * AG-3: Norwegian G3A5 variant produced by Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk, with the given name Automatgev\u00e6r 3. A total of 253,497 units were produced for the Norwegian Armed Forces from 1967 to 1974. The Norwegian AG-3 differs from the original G3; it has a buttstock that is approx. 2 cm longer, the bolt carrier has a serrated thumb groove to aid in silent bolt closure, it features an all-metal cocking handle and a different bayonet mount. Throughout Autumn 2020, they began to replace the AG-3 with the Heckler & Koch HK416 and MP7, a transition which is planned to see completion by the end of the year. * AG-3F1: An AG-3 with a retractable stock as on G3A4. Produced by Kongsberg V\u00e5penfabrikk. A retractable stock was required by certain groups of soldiers within the Norwegian Armed Forces, primarily vehicle crews with limited space inside, particularly where a quick disembarkment from such a vehicle is required. All versions of the AG-3 have the ability to attach a 40 mm HK79 grenade launcher. * AG-3F2: An improvement of the AG-3F1, featuring B&T; Picatinny rails on the receiver, as well as a RIS handguard. On the AG-3F2, Aimpoint red dot sights were mounted onto the receiver top rail for faster quick acquisition, and easier aiming in low-light conditions. ====Sweden==== * Ak 4: Swedish-made version of the G3A3, with a buttstock that is 2 cm longer, the bolt carrier has a serrated thumb groove to aid in silent bolt closure and fitted with a heavy buffer for higher number of rounds fired before failure. Extended sight adjustments. The rifles were manufactured from 1965 to 1970 by both Carl Gustafs stads gev\u00e4rsfaktori and Husqvarna Vapenfabriks and from 1970 until the end of production in 1985 \u2013 exclusively by Carl Gustaf in Eskilstuna. All Ak 4's are adapted to mount the M203 grenade launcher. Sweden has supplied unmodified Ak 4's to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. * Ak 4OR: Optiskt Riktmedel, optical sight. This model is fitted with a Hensoldt 4\u00d724 telescopic sight mounted via a HK claw mount. During a few years it was not issued but it is now again in use by the Hemv\u00e4rnet - Nationella skyddsstyrkorna (\"Swedish Home Guard\"). * Ak 4B: In this updated version the iron sights have been removed and replaced with an Aimpoint CS red-dot reflex sight mounted on a Picatinny rail. The rail is welded onto the rifle. Used by Hemv\u00e4rnet - Nationella skyddsstyrkorna (\"Swedish Home Guard\"). * Ak 4C: An updated version of the Ak 4B with an adjustable-length stock designed and manufactured by the Swedish company Spuhr i Dalby AB. Fielded in 2017 and used by Hemv\u00e4rnet - Nationella skyddsstyrkorna (\"Swedish Home Guard\"). * Ak 4D: An updated version of the Ak 4B with the adjustable-length stock of the Ak 4C but with the addition of a modular handguard (also designed and manufactured by the Swedish company Spuhr i Dalby AB) and the Hensoldt 4\u00d724 telescopic sight of the Ak 4OR in a Picatinny mount. The Ak 4D will be used by the Swedish Army as a stop-gap DMR. ====Iran==== * DIO G3-A3 Bullpup: Iranian bullpup variant of the G3. ====Pakistan==== * G3P4: Pakistan Ordnance Factories designation for license-produced G3A4 rifles. * G3S: A version of G3P3 with a shorter barrel. * G3M-Tactical: A light weight version of G3 rifle with polymer body and shorter barrel. ====United Kingdom==== * FR Ordnance MC51 Machine Carbine: Produced by the United Kingdom firm FR Ordnance International Ltd. The MC51 weighs , has a folded overall length of , a barrel length of only , which produces a muzzle velocity of approx. and a muzzle energy of 2215 J. Another UK-based company called Imperial Defence Services Ltd. absorbed FR Ordnance and continues to market the MC51 standard variant. ===Specialized G3 types=== German designated marksman (right) with G3A3ZF in 2015 German sniper with a modernized G3SG with a STANAG claw mounted Schmidt & Bender 3-12x50 PM II telescopic sight in Afghanistan in 2011 MSG90 (top) and PSG1 * G3TGS: This is simply a G3 with a 40 mm HK79 under-barrel grenade launcher. TGS stands for Tragbares Granat System (\"portable grenade system\"). * G3A3ZF: This is a rifle issued with a STANAG claw-and rail scope bracket and a Hensoldt Fero Z24 4\u00d724 telescopic sight to be mounted and zeroed by the user. The ZF stands for Zielfernrohr (\"Telescopic Sight\"). The Hensoldt Fero Z24 4\u00d724 telescope sight for G3 rifle and claw mount assembly were developed for designated marksman use. The Fero Z24 elevation knob features Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) settings for in increments calibrated for 7.62\u00d751mm NATO ball ammunition. The G3A3ZF is otherwise a standard G3A3 that during factory test shooting printed a 5-shot group of (0.8 mil/2.75 MOA) diameter or less. * G3SG/1: A modified/accurized rifle for sharpshooter/sniper use introduced in 1972. The \"SG\" stands for Scharfsch\u00fctzengewehr (\"Sharpshooting Rifle\"). The rifles were individually selected from the G3 production line for outstanding accuracy during test- firing and then modified. G3SG/1 rifles got a heavy, dual-stage buffer, fixed mounted, Zeiss Diavari-DA 1.5-6\u00d736 power telescopic sight and STANAG claw mount assembly mounted. The standard trigger was exchanged for an adjustable set-trigger pack assembly with a trigger pull and in the set operation mode, the buttstock has a slightly adjustable auxiliary cheek riser, and the lengthened handguard has an integrated bipod. The Zeiss Diavari-DA 1.5-6\u00d736 was windage adjustable and had an elevation knob featuring Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) settings for . For the sub ranges the BDC numbers are yellow. The BDC numbers for the longer ranges are white and in increments. The automatic fire mode was retained but the set-trigger mode could only be used for semi-automatic firing. * MSG3: A variant introduced in 1988 featuring a long barrel, a newer telescopic sight mount that is found on only a few of the Heckler & Koch rifles, as compared to the more conventional claw mounts, though the claw mounting points remain on the receiver. This newer telescopic sight mount does not allow the use of the open sights with the mount in place, as is the case with the more conventional claw mount. The receiver is not strengthened. In addition to the G3SG/1 the buttstock has an auxiliary cheek riser and its length is adjustable and features the PSG1 semi-automatic only trigger pack. MSG stands for Milit\u00e4risches Scharfsch\u00fctzen Gewehr (\"Military Sniper Rifle\"). * MSG90: A somewhat cheaper and lighter long barrel version of the PSG1 modified for military sniping/designated marksman applications. The MSG90 and PSG1 have different trigger packs. * PSG1: A free-floating long barrel semi-automatic only version of the G3 introduced in 1985 with a strengthened receiver with rails welded over the channels where a retractable buttstock would slide and numerous other upgrades and such to meet the necessities of police sniper units. This rifle is famous for its accuracy and comfort, but infamous for its price and inability to be deployed by military units because some upgrades made the rifle too fragile. PSG stands for Pr\u00e4zisionsscharfsch\u00fctzengewehr (\"Precision Sniper Rifle\"). * HK32: An experimental variant of the rifle chambered for the Soviet 7.62\u00d739mm M43 cartridge. It was never adopted by any country. ===Law enforcement and civilian models=== HK41. SR9. * G3A1*: The terminology used by custom gunsmiths (e.g., Choate) and importers (e.g., Interarms) for imported semi- automatic G3 weapons with an aftermarket side-folding stock. This is not part of official HK nomenclature. * HK41: The HK41 is a semi-automatic version of the G3 that was marketed to law-enforcement. Limited sales at home and US import restrictions and firearms regulations led this weapon to be dropped from HK's product line quickly and it was replaced by the HK91. * Fleming Arms HK51: Contrary to popular belief the HK51 is not made by H&K;, being a creation of the American Class II manufacturing after-market. The HK51 has no real standards but is usually a cut down and modified G3A3 or its semi- automatic clones the HK41 and HK91 and modified to take MP5 furniture and accessories. It is usually fitted with a collapsible stock; with a 211 mm (8.31-inch) long barrel; it is relatively small at 589 mm (23.17 inches) with the stock retracted and 780 mm (30.72 inches) with the stock extended. The first commercial version was by Bill Fleming of Fleming Arms and existed before Heckler & Koch made the HK53. * HK91: The HK91 is a semi-automatic version of the G3 similar to the HK41, also marketed to civilians. However, in order to comply with US firearm regulations a number of modifications to the HK91 were made that do not appear on the first pattern HK41. Internal parts that could allow fully automatic fire were removed. A shelf was welded onto the receiver where the push-pin of the trigger pack would normally go, to prevent installation of a fully automatic trigger pack. This did not allow the use of the paddle style magazine release and so the magazine release button on the right side of the magazine well must be used instead. It is otherwise identical to the G3A3/A4. Importation into the United States began in 1974 and ceased in 1989, with some 48,000 rifles being imported. * HK911: The HK911 was an HK91A2 with the flash hider removed and the receiver re-stamped with an extra 1 to comply with the US importation ban of 1989. The new designation theoretically made it legally immune to the Import Ban, as no \"HK911\" rifles were mentioned on the list of banned guns. However, the later banning of several \"paramilitary\" features on the HK911 made it illegal. * SR9: These variants of the HK91ZF were created to comply with the Semi-Auto Import Ban of 1989, which included all variants of the HK91. They differed from the HK91 in that they had their flash hiders removed and featured a smooth forend that lacked the bipod attachment point.
