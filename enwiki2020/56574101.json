    "text": "__NOTOC__ Amyton is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located on the eastern side of the Flinders Ranges about north of the state capital of Adelaide and about north-east of the municipal seat of Melrose. Boundaries for the locality were created on 13 March 1997 and was given the \u201clong established name\u201d of Amyton which is derived from the former Government Town of Amyton. The government town was intended to be the principal settlement of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Pinda. It was surveyed in January 1879 and laid out as \u201c204 house allotments and 180 larger blocks and parklands.\u201d It was proclaimed on 10 April 1879 and was named after the eldest daughter of William Jervois, the Governor of South Australia. It was diminished on 13 May 1954 by the cancellation of the loan registration book for the land intended for \u201cschool purposes\u201d and resumption of all of the land intended for the school, parklands and the town, and was proclaimed to \u2018cease to exist\u2019 on 13 June 1957. The town had as many as \u201cfour buildings and many temporary constructions\u201d at one time and had a school in operation from 1881 to 1930. As of 2012, \u201cnothing remains but a small pioneer cemetery\u201d and \u201ca few rubble heaps\u2026\u201d Geoffrey Manning, the South Australian historian, notes that the town was not successful because the \u201cuncertainty of the rainfall\u201d made the growing of wheat unviable, although farmers of the time could practise dairying as the \u201cgood variety of summer fodders, such as saltbush and blue bush\u201d realized better financial returns than growing wheat. Amyton is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart and the local government area of the District Council of Mount Remarkable. ==References== Category:Towns in South Australia ",
