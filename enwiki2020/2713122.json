Officially known as a riverboat casino because the gaming area is situated on a building built on barges that float in a pool of water linked to the nearby Mississippi River as required by state law, the resort in all other aspects resembles its Nevada sibling, except for the atrium. It includes a 1,600 seat showroom, a 1,070-room hotel, and an RV park. ==History== Opened in 1994 by Boyd Gaming Corporation as the third Sam's Town Casino (The second being Sam's Town Gold River Laughlin which was open from 1984 to 1991 when it was sold becoming Gold River resort and later River Palms.)
