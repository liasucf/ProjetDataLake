    "text": "Ingerophrynus is a genus of true toads with 12 species. The genus is found in southern Yunnan and Southeast Asia; from Myanmar and Indochina to peninsular Thailand and Malaya, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Nias Island, Sulawesi, and the Philippines. This genus was established after a major taxonomical revision of frogs in 2006. ==Taxonomy and systematics== Ten of the species in this genus were formerly considered species of the genus Bufo, most of them in what had been known as the Bufo biporcatus group; the remaining ones were assigned to this genus based on molecular data. In 2007 a new species, Ingerophrynus gollum, was added to this genus. The sister taxon of Ingerophrynus is Sabahphrynus. ==Etymology== The generic name Ingerophrynus honors Robert F. Inger, an American zoologist from the Field Museum of Natural History. ==Description== The diagnostic characters of the Bufo biporcatus group are the presence of , , and supratympanic crests, lack of a tarsal ridge, presence of vocal sacs but absence of melanophores in the surrounding muscle tissue, lack of tibial glands, lack supinator manus humeralis and adductor longus muscles, presence of paired crests on the vertebral column, rugose skull, squamosal bones with broad dorsal plates, and smooth palatine bones. ==Species== There are 12 species: {|style=\"text-align:left; border:1px solid #999999; \" |-style=\"background:#CCCC99; text-align: center; \" !Binomial Name and Author!!
