    "text": "Midshipman fish belong to the genus Porichthys of toadfishes. They are distinguished by having photophores (which they use to attract prey and after which they are named, reminding some of a naval uniform's buttons) and four lateral lines. Typical midshipman fishes, such as the plainfin midshipman (Porichthys notatus), are nocturnal and bury themselves in sand or mud in the intertidal zone during the day. At night they float just above the seabed. Some species have venomous dorsal spines and are capable of inflicting serious injuries if handled. == Description == Male midshipman fish have two morphs: type I and type II. Type I and type II males have different reproductive strategies, and can be distinguished from each other based on physical characteristics. Type I males are eight times larger in body mass, and have much larger vocal organs. Type II males\u2019 reproductive organs are seven times larger in size than those of type I males. Female and type II male midshipman fish can be distinguished from each other by the female\u2019s slightly larger size, and the type II male midshipman\u2019s large reproductive organs. == Species == Atlantic midshipman (Porichthys plectrodon) Photophores on an Atlantic midshipman. Midshipman fish are named after their photophores. === Extant species === There are currently 14 recognized extant species in this genus: * Porichthys analis C. L. Hubbs & L. P. Schultz, 1939 (Darkedge midshipman) * Porichthys bathoiketes C. R. Gilbert, 1968 * Porichthys ephippiatus H. J. Walker & Rosenblatt, 1988 (Saddle midshipman) * Porichthys greenei C. H. Gilbert & Starks, 1904 (Greene's midshipman) * Porichthys kymosemeum C. R. Gilbert, 1968 * Porichthys margaritatus (J. Richardson, 1844) (Daisy midshipman) * Porichthys mimeticus H. J. Walker & Rosenblatt, 1988 (Mimetic midshipman) * Porichthys myriaster C. L. Hubbs & L. P. Schultz, 1939 (Specklefin midshipman) * Porichthys notatus Girard, 1854 (Plainfin midshipman) * Porichthys oculellus H. J. Walker & Rosenblatt, 1988 (Smalleye midshipman) * Porichthys oculofrenum C. R. Gilbert, 1968 * Porichthys pauciradiatus D. K. Caldwell & M. C. Caldwell, 1963 * Porichthys plectrodon D. S. Jordan & C. H. Gilbert, 1882 (Atlantic midshipman) * Porichthys porosissimus (G. Cuvier, 1829) === Fossil species === * \u2020Porichthys analis - Early Pliocene Onzole Formation, EcuadorOnzole Formation at Fossilworks.org * \u2020Porichthys margaritatus - idem * \u2020Porichthys pedemontanus - Tortonian ItalyPorichthys pedemontanus at Fossilworks.org == Biology == === Reproduction and vocalization === Mating in midshipman fishes depends on auditory communication. Male midshipman fish produce several different vocalizations while females only make grunts in non-breeding situations. == References == == External links == * Category:Batrachoididae Category:Bioluminescent fish Category:Extant Miocene first appearances ",
