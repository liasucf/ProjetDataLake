From 1950 one length was equal to 0.08 of one second. == Competition report== The best bitch in the country Cranog Bet was one of the market leaders when the ante-post lists were compiled; the Phil Rees trained January 1962 whelp was aiming to become just the third bitch in history to win the Derby. Leading Midlands trainer Joe De Mulder sent a strong team headed by Cahara Rover the Pall Mall Stakes, Birmingham Cup and Stewards Cup champion. Scottish Greyhound Derby winner 'We\u2019ll See' now in the hands of Joe Pickering was also considered a leading entry. The betting was Cahara Rover 14-1, Lucky Wonder, Fairy Chum, Fleadh Music, Cranog Bet all 20-1. Cranog Bet was eliminated during the first round continuing the trend of ante-post favourites failing to pass the first stage. One of the main Irish entries called Wonder Valley also failed to make it past round one, he had exceptional pace but his large size meant that he tended to encounter trouble. Cahara Rover and We\u2019ll See safely progressed to round two. The second round saw Scamp Boy and Jerpoint Prince oblige as favourites and the well supported Rupunnini and Die Cast claimed the other two heats. The semi-finals were disappointing due to the fact that the greyhounds encountered so much trouble. The first semi left 20-1 chance Crazy Platinum in front after missing first bend trouble, he held off Die Cast and Rupuninni, both of whom had recovered well to make the final. The second semi was won in 29.77 slower than some of the graded* races and Cahara Rover and Jerpoint Prince were both knocked over. We\u2019ll See finished first with Scamp Boy and Hack It Chieftain taking the minor places. The final had three runners connected to Scotland and three from England. Bessie Lewis had travelled from near Mount Vernon in Glasgow and We\u2019ll See was owned by Scotsman Harry Louden. The newspapers picked up on the fact and announced that it was the England versus Scotland final. The final was seen as being wide open with Die Cast starting 2-1 favourite. First to break was Crazy Platinum followed by We\u2019ll See but both bumped each other at the first bend effectively ending the chances of the pair. Hack Up Chieftain went through a gap that appeared and took full advantage by going on to win the race at odds of 20-1, the first time the rank outsider in the final had claimed the crown. Die Cast finished well to take second place.
