Virkon Broad Spectrum Disinfectant (EPA Label). Virkon has a wide spectrum of activity against viruses, some fungi, and bacteria. This includes at least 300 strains/clinical isolates from 76 bacteria, 47 strains/clinical isolates from 35 viruses and 45 strains/clinical isolates from 17 fungi. It has been proven effective against SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (2019-nCoV).
