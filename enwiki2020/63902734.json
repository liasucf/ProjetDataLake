Their priority is to get her married off at the earliest. But in case they fail to find and fix her marriage within a reasonable time to a suitable groom of their choice, they decide to offer the girl as Dakshina to a priest, which is called Daiva marriage. No qualities of groom like good character, conduct, etc. are emphasized in this form of marriage. Typically, this type of marriage literally amounts to giving away the bride to the priest, at times due to inability of her family to organise her, being poor. Among eight types of marriages defined in Hinduism, as specifically mentioned in Manu Smriti (Verse 3.21)), namely (1) Brahma (Hindi: \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e), (2) Daiva (Hindi: \u0926\u0948\u0935), (3) Arsha (Hindi: \u0905\u0930\u094d\u0936), (4) Prajapatya (Hindi: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e\u092a\u0924\u094d\u092f), (5) Asura (Hindi: \u0905\u0938\u0941\u0930), (6) Gandharva (Hindi: \u0917\u0928\u094d\u0927\u0930\u094d\u0935), (7) Rakshasa (Hindi: \u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0938), and (8) Paishacha (Hindi: \u092a\u0948\u0936\u093e\u091a), this type of marriage that is considered inferior because it is degrading to womanhood. This form of marriage is generally recommended only for the Brahmans among four varnas of the Hindu social order in Hinduism, because the Brahmans can only officiate in the sacrifices as priest.Traditional Forms of Hindu Marriage in India (http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/hindu/traditional-forms-of-hindu- marriage-in-india/4377) The practice followed by many Royals in ancient times to forge diplomatic ties with allies and enemies (after getting defeated) alike by giving away their daughters can also be considered as this type of marriage. Giving away of Jodhabai by her father, Raja Bharmal of Amber to Akbar and giving away of Uttara by her father, king Virata of Matsya to Arjuna as his daughter in law are few of many such examples. ==References== Category:Marriage in Hinduism Category:Family Category:Social institutions Category:Vedic Customs ",
