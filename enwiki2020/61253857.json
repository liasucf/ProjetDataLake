    "text": "Hubie Halloween is a 2020 American comedy horror film directed by Steven Brill, written by Adam Sandler and Tim Herlihy, and starring Sandler, Kevin James, Julie Bowen, Ray Liotta, Rob Schneider, June Squibb, Kenan Thompson, Shaquille O'Neal, Steve Buscemi, and Maya Rudolph. The film follows a delicatessen worker that loves Halloween who must save the town of Salem, Massachusetts from a kidnapper. Released on October 7, 2020 by Netflix, the film is dedicated to the late actor Cameron Boyce, who was originally set to star but died prior to production. The film received mixed reviews from critics. == Plot == Hubie Dubois (Adam Sandler) is a delicatessen employee in Salem, Massachusetts. Hubie is ridiculed by almost the entire city for being eccentric, and is the butt of many practical jokes. Hubie spends his time during Halloween monitoring the city as the official Halloween Helper. The day before Halloween, Hubie meets his strange new neighbor Walter Lambert (Steve Buscemi), and news spreads around town about Richie Hartman (Rob Schneider), a convict who has absconded from a local mental institution. The next day is Halloween; Hubie is working as Halloween Monitor and investigates Walter's home after reports of strange noises. Having reported this to the police, he is \"recruited\" by police sergeant Steve (Kevin James) as an \"AUU\" (auxiliary undercover unit). Hubie goes to a local Halloween party to monitor the activities. However, it soon turns sour. Hubie is tricked into going in to a corn maze following reports that a kid is lost. Hubie's teenage co-worker Mike (Karan Brar) follows hoping to scare Hubie. Hubie finds Mike and sees him getting pulled into the maze, then nowhere to be found. Hubie moves his attention to monitoring at a drive-in cinema. Hubie\u2019s old classmates Lester and Mary Hennessey (Tim Meadows and Maya Rudolph) scare Hubie after false reports of a suspicious activity in one of the cars at the drive-in (who turned out to be trick-or-treaters driven by Mr. Hennesy to throw eggs at Hubie). He flees in to the woods and finds Walter. Walter thinks he is turning into a werewolf and chases Hubie to a haunted house in a fun fair. Mr. and Mrs. Hennesy are kidnapped and police sergeant Steve is alerted. At the haunted house, Hubie sees a husky, thinking it is Walter in his final form. The husky then runs into the haunted house and Hubie chases it inside. Pete Landolfa (Ray Liotta), one of Hubie's bullies, goes in to scare Hubie, but is kidnapped in front of him. Sgt. Downey arrives and suggests that they cancel Halloween. Hubie thinks it is Walter, but then Sgt. Blake calls that Walter is at the police station with Richie who had turned themselves in, who also reveals that Walter's real name is Nick Hudson. Richie had escaped to bring Walter back to the mental institution which they refer to as the werewolf treatment center. They all agree that Hubie is the kidnapper, thinking he is getting revenge on his bullies. He runs away and goes to a radio station. DJ Aurora (Shaquille O'Neal, voiced by Vivian Nixon) tells Hubie that someone calls a lot more than him always requesting a song for Hubie. They all think Violet (Julie Bowen) is the culprit, thinking she's the caller. The burner phone that was planted when called is reveled to be in Hubie\u2019s house and he races there, hoping his mother (June Squibb) is okay. It is revealed that Hubie's mother kidnapped the bullies in revenge for bullying Hubie and plans to burn them alive. He rescues them and his mother suddenly disappears. A year later, Hubie is married to Violet and is the new Mayor of Salem. Hubie, having earned respect from the locals, goes into town on his bicycle and prepares for the Halloween festivities. ==Cast== Ben Stiller reprises his role as Hal L., an orderly at Richie's asylum who previously appeared in Happy Gilmore.

Principal photography began in July 2019 around Salem, Lynnfield, Hamilton, Manchester-by-the-Sea, and other parts of Massachusetts, wrapping in early September. == Release == Hubie Halloween was digitally released by Netflix on October 7, 2020. It was the top-streamed title in its first two weeks of release. == Reception == On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 46% based on 65 reviews, with an average rating of 4.99/10. The website's critics consensus reads \"Viewers immune to its star's charms won't find it much of a treat, but Hubie Halloween is sweet enough to satisfy fans of Adam Sandler's antics.\" On Metacritic it has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \"B\u2013\", praising the cameos and saying: \"Are those details enough to make Hubie Halloween much better than all the other content Sandler has churned out for Netflix so far, or am I just drunk on the movie's pumpkin-spiced production design? It's hard to say, but this is the first time in a long time that it feels nice to watch the Sandman goof off with his friends for 90 minutes.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2020 comedy horror films Category:American comedy horror films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films about bullying Category:Films about Halloween Category:Films directed by Steven Brill Category:Films produced by Adam Sandler Category:Films produced by Allen Covert Category:Films scored by Rupert Gregson-Williams Category:Films set in 2019 Category:Films set in 2020 Category:Films set in Massachusetts Category:Films shot in Massachusetts Category:Films with screenplays by Adam Sandler Category:Films with screenplays by Tim Herlihy Category:Happy Madison Productions films ",
