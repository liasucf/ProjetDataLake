    "text": "\"Soma\" sculpture adapted to use LED lights instead of fire, installed in San Francisco as public art, 2015 Flaming Lotus Girls is a volunteer-based group of artists who make large-scale kinetic fire art. FLG has been described as a \"women-focused anarchist art collective.\" The group began in 2000, in San Francisco, California, as a group of six women and two men who wanted to gain the fabrication skills and design experience needed to create large sculptural installations. The group includes over a hundred members of all genders, and a majority of the members are women. Many of the sculptures have interactive elements, allowing the audience to control the lighting, flames, sound, or other effects. The collective's work has appeared throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, Australia, and the Netherlands. == Art == ===Serenity (2019)=== Serenity was chosen as a 2019 Black Rock City Honoraria project in February, 2019. It features a group of three giant, and many smaller fireflies escaping the pieces of a large broken jar. Serenity will primarily be sculpted in steel - and will feature interactive flame and LED effects at night. It is currently being constructed in San Francisco, California, and is expected to debut at Burning Man in August, 2019. ===Noetica (2017)=== Noetica is a set of two sculptures constructed from 144 stainless steel squares carved with intricate patterns. The larger of the two sculptures is hydraulically powered - and may be controlled by manually manipulating the smaller sculpture. Noetica was displayed in Black Rock City, NV in 2017. === Pulse (2016) === Pulse is an anatomically-correct heart that beats fire through its four chambers, emulating the blood flow through the human heart. The outer steel structure mimics the intricate vasculature and predominant veins and arteries. Above the heart chambers, the aortic arch shoots pulses of fire into the night sky. The sculpture was displayed at the SOMArts Cultural Center in San Francisco in 2016 as part of an event promoting a Flaming Lotus Girls photo calendar. === Xylophage (2013) === Xylophage is a giant sculptural fungi featuring sound, light and fire, sprouting from the remains of an enormous tree. Xylophage appeared at Burning Man in 2013. ===Tympani Lambada (2011)=== alt= Tympani Lambada is a sculptural representation of the inner ear, with interactive controls for its flames and LED lights. The sculpture is approximately 80 by 40 feet and weighs 20,000-25,000 pounds. The planning and construction of the sculpture involved building large trusses out of pipes that carry propane, linked with 140 joints. ===Soma (2009)=== alt= Soma is a stainless steel neuron that illustrates flowing electricity through crowd-controlled LED light patterns that shoot along its dendrites and axon. Soma appeared at Electric Daisy Carnival in 2013. In 2014 it was installed at Pier 14 along the Embarcadero on the San Francisco waterfront for one year, adapted to light up with LED lights instead of the original balls of fire. In 2016 it moved to Vallejo, California as a public art installation for two years, as part of an effort to draw visitors to the city's downtown and waterfront areas. ===Mutopia (2008)=== Mutopia methanol shooters, Friday night, Burning Man 2008 Mutopia is a spiraling sculpture of \"seedpods,\" laid out according to the Golden Ratio, a proportion found throughout art and nature.

The Angel's wings burn continuously with ambient flame, and each feather features audience-controlled \"poofer\" fire effects. Its head, formed from curved steel plate and featuring hand-blown glass eyes, stands tall and functions as a wood-burning fireplace. Participants are invited to move around and between the Angel's feathers, and to climb and sit atop its driftwood torso. During its debut appearance at Burning Man, the driftwood torso was burnt as part of the performance. A new steel one was designed and constructed in the winter of 2009\u20132010, to bring to Toronto's Winter Festival. ===The Seven Sisters (2004)=== Electra of the Seven Sisters, morning after the Burn, Burning Man 2004 A collection of seven sculptures approximately in height, representing the stars of the Pleiades constellation.
