    "text": "Laurie Anderson's Puppet Motel is a 1995 CD-ROM developed by The Voyager Company. The CD-ROM was based on the song \"The Puppet Motel\", from Anderson's 1994 album Bright Red. It was a non-mass-market CD-ROM, and along with Who Built America? had only middling financial success and could not prevent the company from a round of lay offs. ==Critical reception== The Obscurity felt the title gave the player an experience \"all at once dark, confusing, desolate, and beautiful.\" CDM acknowledged that the work was self-aware as \"media recognizing the demise of the CD\". Digital Culture felt the title went beyond a game to become a \"freestanding work of art\". ==References== ==External links== * Laurie Anderson Interview 1995 CD-ROM Interactive * Electronic Entertainment interview Category:Works by Laurie Anderson Category:1995 software ",
