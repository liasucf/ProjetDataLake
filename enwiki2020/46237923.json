Printed versions are also available. ==Black Book Function in the Auto Industry== Today, Black Book is a division of Hearst Business Media Corporation. The magazine is circulation controlled, restricted to dealers and financing sources. Black Book is issued weekly, reflecting the latest prices direct from actual or online automobile dealers. National Auto Research Inc, provides vehicle pricing. In select formats, Black Book vehicle appraisal guides are published daily, weekly, and monthly in various electronic formats, including data feeds, internet based applications, hand held PDAs, smart phones and online appraisal services. == Black Book Methodology == Black Book visits 60 auctions nationwide every week to gather the most up to date information on used car values. It collects data from wholesale auctions it attends in person or online, applies adjustments and compares them against dealer advertised prices. Access is restricted because it requires subscriptions, but public access to its price search features are accessible through third party sites such as Newcars.com. Finding out car value is dependent on several factors including make, model, year, condition, accessories and mileage of the vehicle. Currently Black Book is the official valuation service for Cars.com, a third-party internet shopping site based on their accurate vehicle values which help serve as an important guide for consumers navigating the vehicle selling and trade-in process. ==References== Category:1955 establishments in the United States Category:Automobile magazines published in the United States Category:Hearst Communications publications Category:Magazines established in 1955 Category:Magazines published in Georgia (U.S. state) ",
