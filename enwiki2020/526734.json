In 1983 when he was six years old, his father, Aubrey II, was shot and killed as an innocent bystander in a domestic dispute while working as an electrician. When his mother told him that his father had been killed, Huff later wrote: \"I went back to watching The Transformers on television. I remember thinking, \u2018He was never here anyway.\u2019\" Huff's mother Fonda then raised him and his sister Angela. Growing up, Huff regularly practiced baseball in his yard, which had a batting cage with lights and a pitching machine. He said, \"[My mother bought] it more to keep me out of trouble.\"Baggarly, 93 He grew up rooting for the Texas Rangers, and frequently attended their games. One of his favorite players was Nolan Ryan. Huff initially attended Mineral Wells High School, but transferred to Brewer High School when his family moved to Fort Worth.

He graduated in 1995. ===College career=== Huff attended Vernon College for two years and was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of its baseball team in 1996. He transferred to the University of Miami for his final two years of college baseball.

He also hit 21 home runs (fifth in school history) and a school record of 95 runs batted in (RBI). Baseball America, The Sporting News, and the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association named him a first-team All-American. Huff finished his UM college career with a .400 batting average (second in school history) and a .719 slugging percentage (third in school history).

Huff's single-season totals in hits, doubles, home runs, and RBI had been matched by 11 players in major league history as of 2012. He was tied for 24th in AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting along with Esteban Loaiza and Jason Varitek. Defensively, he tied with Tim Salmon for the lead in errors by AL right fielders with six. ====2004==== In 2004, Huff spent most of the season playing third base. On May 12, he had five RBI, including a three-run home run against Chan Ho Park, in a 9\u20138 victory over the Texas Rangers. He saw a streak of 398 consecutive games played snapped on August 22 when he was forced to miss a game with a minor back injury. He told reporters afterwards, \"You guys care more about the streak than I do.\" On August 27, he had four hits in an 8\u20137 loss to the Athletics. He had four hits on September 23 in a 7\u20133 loss to the Yankees. Huff finished the season batting .297 with 178 hits, 27 doubles, 29 home runs, and 104 RBI in 157 games. His average, home runs, and RBI were the highest totals among Devil Rays' players. ====2005==== In 2005, Huff spent most of the year in right field. On April 18, Huff had four RBI and hit the 100th home run of his career, a three-run shot against Jaret Wright in a 19\u20138 loss to the Yankees. After hitting 5 home runs in the first three months, Huff hit 17 home runs through the rest of the season. On July 22, he hit the first grand slam of his career, a game-winning home run against Bruce Chen in a 7\u20135 victory over the Orioles. He was named the AL Player of the Week from July 25 to 31 after he batted .409 with two home runs and 10 RBI. In 148 games, Huff batted .261 with 150 hits, 26 doubles, 22 home runs, and 92 RBI. ====2006==== For 2006, Huff was moved back to third base.

On May 4, he was activated from the DL. On May 19, he hit his first career walk-off home run against Yusmeiro Petit in a 10-inning, 5-4 win over the Marlins. Through July 9, Huff batted .283 with 65 hits, 15 doubles, 8 home runs, and 28 RBI in 63 games. Huff ranked among the top ten in several career and single-season records in the history of the Tampa Bay Rays (Devil Rays from 1998 to 2007) as of 2019. Through 2019, he ranked fifth in games played (799), at bats (3,028), plate appearances (3,322), hits (870), doubles (172), RBI (449), and batting average (.287). His 128 home runs ranked third (behind Carlos Pe\u00f1a's 163, and Evan Longoria's 261), and his 400 runs scored ranked sixth. He, Longoria and Delmon Young were the only Devil Rays to appear in 162 games in a season. He held Devil Rays' record for hits in a season and doubles in a season, both set in 2003. His batting averages in 2002 and 2003 ranked sixth and seventh, respectively; his home run total in 2003 tied for fifth; and his RBI totals in 2003 and 2004 were fourth and tied for sixth, respectively. ===Houston Astros=== On July 12, 2006, the Houston Astros acquired Huff from Tampa Bay for minor leaguers Mitch Talbot and Ben Zobrist. Huff was used at third base for the Astros until August 1, when he was moved to right field following regular third baseman Morgan Ensberg's return from the DL. In his debut with the Astros on July 13, the first game after the All- Star break, Huff had two hits, including a three-run home run against Randy Messenger in a 5-1 victory over the Marlins.

On October 31, he filed for free agency. ===Baltimore Orioles=== Huff with the Orioles ====2007==== On January 3, 2007, Huff officially signed a 3-year $20 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles. He began the year getting most of the starts at first base, but in mid-May he became the Orioles regular DH as Kevin Millar was moved to first base. In a 9-7 loss to the Angels on June 29, he hit for the cycle and got his 1000th hit and 200th double (both against Kelvim Escobar). He was one of four Orioles to hit for the cycle (along with Brooks Robinson, Cal Ripken, Jr., and F\u00e9lix Pie) and the first player to do so at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. On August 14, Huff had two hits and five RBI, including a grand slam against Jeff Karstens in a 12-0 victory over the Yankees. In 151 games, Huff batted .280 with 154 hits, 34 doubles, 15 home runs, and 72 RBI. ====2008==== Before the 2008 season, Huff switched his uniform number from 19 to 17 in honor of his former teammate Joe Kennedy, who died during the offseason. He angered fans in the offseason when he called Baltimore a \"horse----\" town when compared to Tampa, but he regained fan support by the end of the year by posting one of his best seasons. He was the Orioles' designated hitter for most of the season, although he was moved to third base at the end of August following an injury to Melvin Mora. On April 8, he had four hits and four RBI in an 8-1 victory over the Rangers. He was named AL Player of the Week from June 30 to July 6 after hitting .345 with three home runs and nine RBIs.

Through August 17, Huff batted .253 with 109 hits, 24 doubles, 13 home runs, and 72 RBI in 110 games. ===Detroit Tigers=== Huff with the Tigers On August 17, 2009, Huff cleared waivers and was traded to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for pitching prospect Brett Jacobson. He began his time with the Tigers as the team's DH, but in September he only played against right-handed pitchers as Marcus Thames began playing against left-handed pitchers. He hit his first career pinch-hit home run against Jason Frasor on September 14, a game-tying three-run hit in a 10-inning, 6-5 victory over Toronto. In 40 games with the Tigers, Huff batted .189/.265/.302 with 20 hits, six doubles, two home runs, and 13 RBI. His season totals were a .241 batting average, 129 hits, 30 doubles, 15 home runs, and 85 RBI in 150 games. Following the season, Huff filed for free agency. ===San Francisco Giants=== ====2010==== On January 13, 2010, Huff signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the San Francisco Giants. He spent most of the season playing first base for the Giants, although he played left field and right field when Buster Posey played first base from May 29 \u2013 June 30 and Travis Ishikawa made most of the starts at first base from July 3 \u2013 August 14. On April 14, Huff hit his first career inside-the-park home run (his first home run with the Giants), a game-winning hit against Charlie Morton in a 6-0 victory over the Pirates. On August 28, he got his 1,500th career hit against Alex Sanabia in a 10-inning, 10-9 victory over the Marlins. In 157 games, Huff batted .290 with 165 hits, 35 doubles, 26 home runs, and 86 RBI while scoring 100 runs (tied for seventh in the league with Brandon Phillips, Mart\u00edn Prado, and Dan Uggla) for the first time in his career. Huff finished seventh in the voting for the NL MVP award. Huff, in the 11th year of his career, reached the playoffs for the first time as the Giants won the NL West. In Game 4 of the NL Division Series (NLDS) against the Atlanta Braves, he had a ninth-inning, two- out, game-tying RBI single against Mike Dunn in a 3-2 Giants' victory. He batted .267 with four hits and one RBI in the series as the Giants defeated the Braves in four games. He batted .250 with six hits and three RBI in the series as the Giants defeated the Phillies in six games. In Game 4 of the World Series against the Texas Rangers on October 31, he hit a game-winning two-run home run against Tommy Hunter in a 4-0 Giants' victory. He batted .294 with five hits, a home run, and four RBI in the series, winning his first World Series as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first World Series in 56 years. ====2011==== Huff with the Giants, April 2011 Huff filed for free agency after the 2010 season, but on November 23, 2010, he re-signed a $22 million contract with the Giants for two years with a club option for 2013. Coming off the team's 2010 World Series success and his new contract, Huff arrived at 2011 spring training out of shape. He began 2011 in right field due to an injury to Cody Ross, but he returned to first base when Ross was activated from the disabled list on April 20. He drew a pinch-hit, game-winning, bases loaded walk on April 30 against John Lannan in a 2-1 victory over the Washington Nationals. On June 2, his wife's birthday, Huff hit three home runs and drove in a career-high six runs in the Giants' 12\u20137 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. He said after the game, \"[My wife] wanted me to hit her a homer. I hit three. Brownie points.\" Those home runs accounted for a quarter of his season total, as his overall production dropped from the previous season. For the season, he batted .246/.306/.370. Compared to 2010, his batting average dropped 44 points, his homers fell from 26 to 12, and his walks went from 83 to 47 as he grew impatient. His On-base plus slugging (OPS) dropped 215 points to .676, last among Major League first baseman in 2011. Giants' manager Bruce Bochy said, \"[Huff's] struggles helped cause our struggles\"; the Giants failed to return to the playoffs in 2011. ====2012==== In 2012 spring training, Huff competed with Brandon Belt and Brett Pill for the Giants' first base job. Belt won the job, and Huff opened the season as the Giants' left fielder. On April 21, because the Giants did not have any infielders available, Huff was positioned at second base for the first time in his career in the ninth inning of a tied game against the Mets. He failed to cover second base in a potential double play situation, and the Mets went on to win the first game of the doubleheader 5-4. After the game, on April 25, Huff was placed on the 15-day disabled list with anxiety issues. He returned from the DL on May 7 but was used mainly as a pinch hitter for the rest of the season. On June 15, he was placed on the DL with a sprained right knee that he suffered jumping over a dugout railing to celebrate Matt Cain's perfect game. He returned from the DL on July 28 but was placed on it four days later with right knee tendinitis, which kept him out until August 31. In 52 games, Huff batted .192/.326/.282 with 15 hits, four doubles, one home run, and seven RBI. In the playoffs, Huff was used exclusively as a pinch hitter. In 10 games, he had one hit in nine at-bats but won his second career World Series as the Giants swept the Tigers in four games. On November 1, Huff's $10 million club option was declined, making him a free agent. He instead was paid a $2 million buyout. Huff hit 242 career home runs, through the 2019 season tying him for 246th all-time with a number of players. In addition to being used as a designated hitter, he played at five different positions in his career: first base, third base, left field, right field, and second base. ==Post-playing career== On January 4, 2014, Huff announced his retirement from baseball and took a position as a baseball color commentator for the Pac-12 Network. On March 31, 2014, Huff started co-hosting a morning radio show on Bay Area sports radio station 95.7 The Game with Chris Townsend and Ric Bucher titled Bucher, Towny and Huff. Huff left the show in August 2014. Huff was an assistant baseball coach at Canyon Crest Academy in San Diego, California in 2015. In late 2015, Huff announced he was attempting a comeback three years after playing his final Major League game. In February 2017, he released a book, co-written by Stephen Cassar, entitled Baseball Junkie, in which he opens up about his \"battle with anxiety and the pressure of playing in the Major Leagues\". ==Personal life== On January 27, 2007, Huff married Barbara \"Baubi\" Heaton. The couple have two sons. During Huff's playing days, they resided in Tampa, Florida, in the off-season. Baubi Huff filed for divorce on January 31, 2012. Although the couple briefly reconciled, they eventually divorced and Huff claimed that a woman could only marry him for money. Huff has several tattoos. A Transformers fan, he has the logos of the Autobots and Decepticons tattooed on his shoulder blades. On his left shoulder, he also has a tattoo of a guitar with his father's name under it in memory of his father. Huff said he began taking Adderall in 2009, and was high on it \"every game, pretty much\" thereafter. He said: \"I was crushing 20, sometimes 50, 60, almost 100 milligrams daily\". He said he was \u201chigh as a kite\u201d during the team's 2010 victory parade, as he struggled with the drug, which he views as a performance-enhancing drug. He said he then developed a dependency on alcohol to help him sleep, drinking 12-15 beers after games. During the Giants' 2010 playoff race and postseason, Huff became known for wearing a red \"rally thong\", which he joked would help the team win. When he was slumping in 2011, fans sent him thongs throughout the season in hopes of improving his performance. In 2014, Huff says he contemplated suicide as he held a .357 Magnum to his head, with its hammer cocked, \"ready to pull the trigger\". ===Political views and use of Twitter=== Huff has supported the policies of President Donald Trump, as well as support for pro-gun policies and traditional gender roles. In November 2019, a comment Huff posted on Twitter went viral. He stated: \"Getting my boys trained up on how to use a gun in the unlikely event @BernieSanders beats @realDonaldTrump in 2020. In which case knowing how to effectively use a gun under socialism will be a must.\" The tweet was accompanied by a photo of a smiling Huff wearing a pro-Trump T-shirt at a shooting range, holding a used target with many bullet holes in it, and accompanied by two children (presumed to be his sons) whose faces were out of the frame of the picture. In early January 2020, Huff was criticized after tweeting in response to a comment on the site which talked about invading Iran and kidnapping women from the country. He wrote: \"Let's get a flight over and kidnap about 10 each. We can bring them back here as they fan us and feed us grapes, amongst other things.\" Huff later claimed the tweets were satirical, and continued to post similar tweets. In mid-January 2020, when the Giants promoted Alyssa Nakken to be an assistant coach, making her the first full- time female assistant coach in the history of MLB, Huff tweeted: \"I got in trouble for wearing a thong in my own clubhouse when female reporters were present. Can't imagine how it will play out with a full time female coach running around. This has #metoo & #BelieveAllWomen written all over it. Only in \u2066@SFGiants.\" And then: \"Couldn't imagine taking baseball instruction from an ex female softball player. Have fun with that @bcraw35 @bbelt9 @BusterPosey.\" His behavior eventually prompted the Giants to ban Huff from a ceremony in 2020, honoring their 2010 World Series championship. The team wrote that its reason was: \"Aubrey has made multiple comments on social media that are unacceptable and run counter to the values of our organization.\" Huff claimed that he was banned because of his support for President Trump saying \"If you look at my Twitter account, I'd say about 75 percent of my support [is for] President Trump. So, yeah, absolutely. I have every reason to believe in my heart of hearts it was all about President Trump.\" In June 2020, Huff commented on the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed over 440,000 people world-wide and more than 119,000 in the United States, by calling out people who wore masks to protect themselves from the virus saying \"If you want to wear a mask and live in fear for the rest of your lives, that's certainly your prerogative. But the vast majority of well-adjusted, sane, common sense people that aren't sheep and can reason for themselves agree with me. I understand that coronavirus is real. If you have pre-existing conditions, or you're an old person or\u2014and this is going to sound insensitive, but someone has to say it\u2014you're morbidly obese, then stay the fuck home. Just because that is your plight in life, doesn't mean the whole world has to shut down. If I God forbid get the coronavirus, here's what I do: I go home, I get well and I get back and live my life. I would rather die from coronavirus than live the rest of my life in fear and wear a mask.\u201d In August 2020, Huff attracted controversy for referring to alleged murderer Kyle Rittenhouse as a \"national treasure.\" ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * : Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Tampa Bay Devil Rays players Category:Houston Astros players Category:Baltimore Orioles players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Baseball players from Ohio Category:Baseball players from Texas Category:Major League Baseball center fielders Category:Major League Baseball first basemen Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Major League Baseball right fielders Category:Major League Baseball third basemen Category:Miami Hurricanes baseball players Category:Sportspeople from Fort Worth, Texas Category:People from Marion, Ohio Category:Charleston RiverDogs players Category:Orlando Rays players Category:Durham Bulls players Category:Visalia Oaks players Category:San Jose Giants players Category:Fresno Grizzlies players Category:Vernon Chaps baseball players Category:People from Mineral Wells, Texas Category:Silver Slugger Award winners ",
