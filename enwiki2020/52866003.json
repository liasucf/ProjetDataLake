    "text": "Karl Hans Albrecht Jr. (born 1948 in Essen) is a German billionaire, and the son of Karl Albrecht, who founded the discount supermarket chain Aldi with his brother Theo. Albrecht worked for Aldi S\u00fcd in various roles until his resignation due to a cancer diagnosis (from which he subsequently recovered). He and his sister Beate Heister control the family trust, the Siepmann Stiftung (named for their mother), which, in turn, controls Aldi S\u00fcd, the source of their joint fortune. Together with Heister, he has a net worth of US$41.3 billion, as of August 2020. He is married to Gabriele Mertes, and they have no children. ==References== Category:1948 births Karl Jr. Category:German billionaires Category:20th-century German businesspeople Category:German businesspeople in retailing Category:Businesspeople from Essen Category:Living people ",
