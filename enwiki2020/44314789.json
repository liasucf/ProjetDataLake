It is the second oldest golf club in Queensland \u2013 Townsville is 3 years older. The club has had no fewer than five different locations within the Toowoomba City boundary. Originally the club occupied land on Drayton Road in Harristown, then on a block of land in the area now best known as St Vincent's Hospital, then relocated to the now Toowoomba Turf Club land and after much negotiation found a more permanent home in Willowburn where Bailey Henderson Hospital is located. In approximately 1924 it was decided that the club needed more permanency and therefore members negotiated both the purchase and acceptance of gifted land from Marmaduke Manley who had suggested the move, that the club has now owned and occupied since 1925. The official opening of the club took place on 4 December 1926, when Queensland Premier William McCormack hit a long drive to officially open the course for play. However, the links had been open for play unofficially for some time beforehand. At the 115th annual general meeting on 30 May 2011, the members of the Toowoomba Golf Club \u2013 Middle Ridge, elected Nancy Young as inaugural female club president. Toowoomba Golf Club joined a select few golf clubs throughout Australia who had elected a lady to the office of Club President. At the 2012 Queensland Golf Industry Awards the club won the Regional Tournament of the Year award for their hosting of the BMW and Westpac Pro Am Classic in September 2011. The women's course record was set in June 2014 when 14-year-old Darcy Habgood scored a one-under round of 72. ==See also== *Golf in Australia *Queensland PGA Championship *Sport in Queensland ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Category:Golf clubs and courses in Queensland Category:Sport in Toowoomba Category:1926 establishments in Australia Category:Middle Ridge, Queensland ",
