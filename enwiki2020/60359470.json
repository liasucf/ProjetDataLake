USACE handles leasing and engineering, with contracts for rapid facility modification and setup to local contractors. The plan envisions that the facilities' operation and the provision of medical staff will be handled entirely by the various states rather than the federal government. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:United States Military Academy alumni Category:United States Army Corps of Engineers personnel Category:University of Vermont alumni Category:United States Army Command and General Staff College alumni Category:United States Army generals Category:United States Army Corps of Engineers Chiefs of Engineers Category:COVID-19 pandemic in the United States Category:White House Coronavirus Task Force ",
