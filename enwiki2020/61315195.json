In 1980, Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova began to work in the media with Radio Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova, in the municipality of Cachoeira Paulista, acting in the old frequency of Radio Bandeirantes, now with power that covers the whole of Brazil. From 1989, Comunidade Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova began to work with a TV retransmitter, Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova by TVE of Rio de Janeiro. In the year of 2002, Jonas Abib celebrated the 25 years of the Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova. Also in 2002, he met with Pope John Paul II.

Pope Benedict XVI gave the priest the title given to priests who stand out for relevant services rendered to the Church and to the faithful in their dioceses. The official request was made by the Bishop of the Diocese of Lorena, Bishop Benedito Beni dos Santos. The investiture ceremony took place eight days later, at Cachoeira Paulista, at the Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova headquarters. Father Jonas Abib receives Monsignor's title next Wednesday\". New song. October 9, 2007. Retrieved September 6, 2018 In the same year, he received the title of Corepiscopo of the Maronite Church, granted by the Maronite Eparchy of Brazil through Bishop Edgard Madi. Such a title is the highest honor a Maronite presbyter can receive under the bishop and is awarded directly by the Maronite Patriarch. The investiture ceremony took place on Monsignor Jonas' birthday, in the Maronite Cathedral of Our Lady of Lebanon. The paternal family of Monsignor Jonas was originally linked to the Maronite Church, since his grandfather was deacon of the same one when in Lebanon. It is so much that Jonas Abib had to ask permission to the Maronite Eparchy of Brazil to become deacon and presbyter by the Roman rite. == \"Jonas Abib Case\", freedom of expression and religious proselytism == Jonas Abib is the author of the book Sim, Sim, N\u00e3o, N\u00e3o! \u2013 Reflexos de Cura e Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o, which reached its 85th edition in 2007. In 2008, a controversy began about the allegedly prejudiced content with which Jonas Abib referred to other religions, such as spiritism, in addition to those religions of African origin, such as Umbanda and Candombl\u00e9. In 2008, the Bahia state court ordered the collection of the publication in the State. The Bahian prosecutor, in turn, accused Abib of inciting religious discrimination (article 20, Law 7,716 / 1989). The case reached the Federal Supreme Court, which ruled in respect of it in 2016, in the case of an Ordinary Appeal in Habeas Corpus. The rapporteur of the case, Minister Luiz Edson Fachin, first explained that \"the discriminatory criminal discourse only materializes after three indispensable steps have been taken: one of cognitive character, attesting to the inequality between groups and or individuals, another of value bias, in which is based on a supposed relationship of superiority between them and, finally, a third, in which the agent, from the previous stages, assumes legitimate the domination, exploitation, enslavement, elimination, suppression or reduction of fundamental rights of the different that comprises inferior\". In the case in point, Minister Fachin understood that Abib \"by means of publication in a book, incites the Catholic community to undertake a religious rescue aimed at the salvation of adherents of spiritualism, in an attitude which, despite the fact that, does without any sign of violence, domination, exploitation, enslavement, elimination, suppression or reduction of fundamental rights. \" Accordingly, the Court decided that the crime of incitement to religious discrimination should not be defined, since the conduct, \"although intolerant, pedantic and arrogant\", as the minister rapporteur of the case qualified, is part of the religious proselytism of the Catholic religion, quality \"essential to the exercise, in its entirety, of freedom of religious expression\". Except for Minister Luiz Fux, the other ministers of the First Chamber voted with the rapporteur, extinguishing the criminal action. == Discography == ;Participation in COMEP records *1976 \u2013 Can\u00e7\u00f5es para Orar no Esp\u00edrito 2 *1976 \u2013 Can\u00e7\u00f5es Latino Americanas para Orar no Esp\u00edrito *1977 \u2013 Ele Vive ;Solo Career *1977 \u2013 O Amor Vencer\u00e1 (Gravadora COMEP) *1984 \u2013 Anuncia-Me *1985 \u2013 Quem Dera... *1986 \u2013 Vem Louvar *1987 \u2013 Vem Louvar II - Tu \u00c9s a Vida *1987 \u2013 Vem Louvar III \u2013 Queremos Deus *1988 \u2013 Vem Louvar IV - 10 Anos de Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova *1989 \u2013 Vem Louvar V - Entregue Seu Caminho a Deus *1991 \u2013 Anuncia-Me 91 *1991 \u2013 Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova: Volume 1 *1992 \u2013 Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova: Volume 2 *1992 \u2013 Rio de \u00c1gua Viva *1993 \u2013 Eu e Minha Casa Serviremos ao Senhor *1997 \u2013 Como \u00c9 Linda a Nossa Fam\u00edlia *2001 \u2013 N\u00e3o D\u00e1 Mais Pra Voltar [Versions] *2004 \u2013 S\u00f3 Pra Voc\u00ea [Live] *2008 \u2013 Como \u00c9 Linda a Nossa Fam\u00edlia (ao vivo) [CD and DVD] ; Collecting *1994 \u2013 Collection: As 20 + *1994 \u2013 20 Sucessos *1998 \u2013 O Vento Sopra Onde Quer *2000 \u2013 Maria, M\u00e3e da Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova == References == == External links == * Monsignor Jonas Abib's Official Page * Can\u00e7\u00e3o Nova Community Official Page Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:People from Elias Fausto Category:Brazilian people of Lebanese descent Category:Brazilian Roman Catholic priests Category:Salesians of Don Bosco Category:Brazilian Roman Catholic singers Category:Brazilian singer-songwriters ",
