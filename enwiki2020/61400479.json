    "text": "The New Zealand Women's Land Army was formed to supply New Zealand's agriculture during the Second World War, with a function similar to its British namesake. The organisation was originally formed in 1940. City girls from the age of 17 and up were \"sent to assist on sheep, cattle, dairy, orchard and poultry properties\" in response to labour shortages due to the mobilisation of male farm workers. In 1942, the organisation was renamed the New Zealand Women's Land Service. A total of 2,711 women served throughout the war; this made it the largest of the women's services raised by New Zealand during the war. It was disbanded in 1946, following the end of the war. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * Women's Land Service images, National Library of New Zealand Women's Land Army Category:Women in World War II Women's Land Army Land Army Women's Land Army Women's Land Army ",
