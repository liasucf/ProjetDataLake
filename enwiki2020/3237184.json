Later, when she is found murdered that ring is nowhere to be found. From here the story moves to a cache of jewelry stolen by the Nazis during World War II and smuggled out of France after the war by an American army colonel, who, together with Mike Hammer, tries to find the ring and recover all the other jewels. However, many parties are on the lookout and the private eye runs into big trouble. ==Cast== *Robert Bray as Mike Hammer *Whitney Blake as Nancy Williams *Donald Randolph as Colonel Holloway *Jan Chaney as 'Red' *Gina Core as Maria Teresa Garcia *Pamela Duncan as Velda, Hammer's secretary *Booth Colman as Det. Pat Chambers *Phil Arnold as \"Shorty\" ==Critical reception== TV Guide noted \"The third of UA's Mike Hammer films in the 1950s...the usual number of fisticuffs, killings, and love scenes are presented. This is a lesser work in the series. Though well-crafted, the story is shallow and not really worth the efforts given here. The violence is often senseless and the sex seems to exist only for its own sake. Well produced, but still a boring and tasteless piece\"; while Allmovie found the film \"Not quite as accomplished as Robert Aldrich's classic Mike Hammer yarn Kiss Me Deadly, My Gun is Quick works well within its modest limits.\" ==References== == External links == * Category:1957 films Category:1957 crime films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films about prostitution in the United States Category:1950s mystery films Category:Detective films Category:American mystery films Category:United Artists films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on works by Mickey Spillane Category:Films directed by Victor Saville Category:Films produced by Victor Saville ",
