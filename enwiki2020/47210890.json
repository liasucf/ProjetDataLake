Some time after their foundation, the two main activities of the Georgi Dimitrov shipbuilding and shiprepair yard separated, so Odessos undertook the shiprepair services. The construction of the Graving dock was related at that time with the necessity for execution of emergency dock repairs of war ships in case of eventual military operations in the Black Sea basin during the Cold War. The first docked vessel was the Bulgarian M/V \u201cShipka\u201d. This docking marked the commencement of service of the Graving dock. == Key figures 2015 == * Annual Turnover: 25 Million Dollars * Docked projects 2015: 60 * Employees: over 700 Annual repairs by type of vessel: * General cargo:22 * Bulk carrier:13 * Oil/chemical tanker:5 * Refrigerated cargo:3 * Ro-ro cargo;3 * Vehicles carrier:3 * Passenger/ro-ro cargo/ferry:2 * Tanker:2 * Container ship:1 * Chemical tanker:1 * Oil/products tanker:1 * Product tanker:1 * Ro-ro passenger ship:1 * Supply vessel:1 * Cargo barge:1 Facilities * Area: 320 000 sq. m * Floating Docks: 2 (up to 75 000 DWT) * Graving Dock: 1 (up to 35 000 GRT) * Wharves & Berths: 1 153,5 m with depth up to 9,80 m * Cranes: 17 Total docked projects 1955-2015: 4 940 ==Certificates== * ISO 9001:2008 Ship repair and conversion * AQAP 2120 Repair and docking of vessels up to 70 000 DWT and afloat repair of vessels up to 150 000 DWT * BS OHSAS 18001:2007 Ship repair and conversion Odessos Shiprepair Yard SA is certified by Class Societies for the following activities: * Certified welders and approved WPS (EH36) for welding of ship\u2019s steel hull structures (LR \u0438 RINA); * Certified welders and approved WPS for welding of ship\u2019s bronze propellers (LR \u0438 GL); * Approval for welding of ship\u2019s hull structures and mechanical elements (GL, BRS); Survey and maintenance of ship\u2019s fire equipment (LR, GL, BV, BRS); * Survey and maintenance of ship\u2019s life-boats and davits (LR); * Thickness measurements of ship\u2019s hull structure (LR, GL, BV, DNV, BRS); ==Today== The yard has invested over 30 million US dollars in improvement of infrastructure, buildings, purchase of machinery, equipment and stations, improvement of workplace and safety.
