    "text": "The Southern Positioning Augmentation Network (SPAN) is a satellite based augmentation system for the Australasian region being developed by Australia and New Zealand. It is expected to be operational by 2023. Work is proceeding in using Dual Frequency Multi-Constellation (DFMC) to reduce certain errors that first generation systems like WAAS cannot handle. Also under research is using Precise Point Positioning as part of the design. The resulting system is expected to increase the accuracy of GPS \"to less than a metre, and in some devices to 10 centimetres\". == Test Transmission == From October 2017 to 31 July 2020, Geoscience Australia provided a test SBAS transmission service. == References == == External links == * Information on SPAN Category:Satellite navigation systems ",
