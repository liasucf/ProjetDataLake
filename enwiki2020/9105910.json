Limited dating evidence suggests the enclosure was dug in the early-mid first century BC.Biddle, M. 1975. 'Excavations at Winchester, 1971 - Tenth and Final Interim Report: part I', The Antiquaries Journal 55:1, 96-126. The town wall of the Roman civitas capital of Venta Belgarum which succeeded the Iron Age settlement cut across its eastern end. Today it is a small grassy park in Winchester, and was formerly used for the annual Winchester Hat Fair both as a picnic site and to stage outdoor theatre and acrobatics. ==References== Category:Hill forts in Hampshire ",
