According to the International Lesbian and Gay Association's May 2008 report, both male and female same-sex sexual acts are illegal in Algeria. ==Law regarding same- sex sexual activity== Article 338 of Algerian law (English translation) reads: Article 333 of the Algerian law (English translation) reads: Vigilante executions, beatings, and torture are also allowed with police joining in on the attacks, being complicit, or turning a blind eye. The criminals laws originate from the prevailing mores in Algeria that view homosexuality and cross-dressing as against the Islamic faith. ==Living conditions== Homosexuality and cross-dressing are prohibited by law, and the prevailing social attitude is openly negative, even violent. The law does not recognize or respect the civil rights of LGBT persons. Officially, there are no gay- friendly establishments and no political organization is allowed to campaign for LGBT rights. Examples of hate crimes against homosexuals include the stoning of two men in the street in 2001 and the killing of two men, one in 1994 and the other in 1996. Most attempts of having unofficial same-sex marriage are blocked by police, as was the case in a 2005 attempt. \"Asil Balata\" was a student who was murdered for suspicion of being gay in 2019. The student was killed in his dormatory in the university district and the words \"he is gay\" were painted on the wall with his blood, the murderer thought that he would avoid judicial follow-up for that. Houari Manar, a popular ra\u00ef singer widely thought to be gay, died in 2019. Following his death several homophobic comments were made on social media. According to a survey done for BBC News Arabic by the Arab Barometer research network in 2018-19, about 26% of Algerians think that homosexuality should be accepted. ==Summary table== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | Same-sex sexual activity legal | No (Penalty: Up to 3 years imprisonment with fines up to 10,000 dinars, torture, beatings, or vigilante execution) |- | Equal age of consent | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in employment only | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in the provision of goods and services | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in all other areas (Incl. indirect discrimination, hate speech) | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in gender identity | No |- | Same-sex marriages | No |- | Recognition of same-sex couples | No |- | Step-child adoption by same-sex couples | No |- | Joint adoption by same-sex couples | No |- | Gays and lesbians allowed to serve openly in the military | No |- | Right to change legal gender | No |- | Access to IVF for lesbians | No |- | Commercial surrogacy for gay male couples | No (Illegal for all couples regardless of sexual orientation) |- | Commercial surrogacy for lesbian female couples | No (Illegal for all couples regardless of sexual orientation) |- |Automatic parenthood on birth certificates for children of same-sex couples | No |- |Conversion therapy banned for minors | No |- | MSMs allowed to donate blood | No |} ==See also== *Human rights in Algeria *Politics of Algeria *LGBT rights in Africa ==Notes== ==External links== *GayAlgerie.net - Algerian LGBT Media Algeria Category:Human rights in Algeria Algeria Algeria Category:LGBT in Algeria Category:Politics of Algeria ",
