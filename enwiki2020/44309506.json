    "text": "The North Washington Street Bridge is a historic bridge in DeWitt, Arkansas. Built in 1910, it carries North Washington Street over Holt Branch, just south of Holt Lane, and is the oldest known concrete bridge span in the state. It consists of two spans of steel girders, resting on concrete abutments and a concrete central pier, with concrete decking. It is long and has a roadbed wide. Its guard rails consist of metal piping mounted on concrete piers with simple recessed panels as a decorative effect. The short spans of the bridge demonstrate the unfamiliarity with the use of concrete as a bridge-building material. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. ==See also== *North Jackson Street Bridge *Maxwell Street Bridge *National Register of Historic Places listings in Arkansas County, Arkansas *List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas ==References== Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Bridges completed in 1942 Category:Buildings and structures in Arkansas County, Arkansas Category:1942 establishments in Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas County, Arkansas Category:Road bridges in Arkansas Category:Steel bridges in the United States Category:Girder bridges in the United States ",
