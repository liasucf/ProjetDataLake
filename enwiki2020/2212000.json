    "text": "Ivan Yarkovsky Ivan Osipovich Yarkovsky () (24 May 1844, Asveya, Vitebsk Governorate \u2013 22 January 1902, Heidelberg) was a Polish Russian civil engineer. Born from a Polish family in Asveya (Russian Empire, now Belarus), he worked for a Russian railway company and was obscure in his own time. Beginning in the 1970s, long after Yarkovsky's death, his work on the effects of thermal radiation on small objects in the Solar System (e.g., asteroids) was developed into the Yarkovsky effect and the YORP effect. The asteroid 35334 Yarkovsky is named in his honour . In 1888, he also created a mechanical explanation of gravitation. ==References== ==Literature== * * ==External links== * Citations for asteroids discovered at Sormano Astronomical Observatory Category:1844 births Category:1902 deaths Category:People from Verkhnyadzvinsk District Category:People from Drissensky Uyezd Category:Polish astronomers Category:Polish civil engineers ",
