The Vatican quickly welcomed her, in a sign interpreted as interest in thawing the relationship with Ireland.

The Ambassador says that this conversation \u201ccovered many things. We spoke of priorities that are very dear to Ireland such as our development program, our concern regarding the plight of Christians and other religious minorities in the world today. I was able to update Pope Francis on talks in Northern Ireland and of course on recent developments in Ireland more broadly\u201d. Ambassador Madigan said Pope Francis \u201cresponded very well to the updates I was giving him and expressed very warm interest in our development program, which perhaps in many ways chimes with his own messages in ensuring that the vulnerable and marginalized are not left behind\u201d.Irish Ambassador to Holy See Speaks to Vatican radio Radio Vatican, Nov 12, 2014 In June 2018 it was announced that Madigan would return to Ireland to a post in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Madigan was received in audience on 6 September 2018 to present her Letters of Recall and the end of her mission pending the placet for the new Irish ambassador to the Holy See, Derek Hannon. On September 25, 2018, when Pope Francis visited Ireland, Madigan participated in welcoming him. The Pope visited \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, where he met with President Michael D.

The Pope signed the visitors' book with the following message: \"With gratitude for the warm welcome I have received. I assure you and the people of Ireland of my prayers that almighty god may guide and protect you all. Francis\". Upon being handed a ceremonial shovel by head gardener Robert Norris, Pope Francis planted a tree in the President's back garden, a tradition which his predecessor Pope John Paul II had also performed nearby. Madigan is credited with improving relations between Ireland and the Vatican, with assistance from former papal nuncio Archbishop Charles Brown. Madigan was successful is smoothing the relationship between the Holy See and the Irish government after a very tense period during which T\u00e1naiste Eamon Gilmore closed the Irish Embassy at the Vatican. While publicly presented as a cost saving measure, it was widely recognized as a \"rebuke to the Vatican over Church mishandling of allegations of clerical abuse.\"The Irish Catholic, \"New ambassador to the Holy See appointed\", June 7, 2018 ==Personal== Madigan is married and has one son.
