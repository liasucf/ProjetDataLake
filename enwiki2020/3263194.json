New Zealand started metrication in 1969 with the establishment of the Metric Advisory Board (MAB) and completed metrication on 14 December 1976.Consumer Affairs, November 2006 accessed 28 August 2013 Until the 1970s, New Zealand traditionally used the imperial system for measurement, which it had inherited from the United Kingdom. ==Strategy toward metrication== The New Zealand metric symbol was introduced in March 1971. To give metrication a human face, a baby girl whose parents agreed to co-operate was nicknamed Miss Metric.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&dat;=19771005&id;=4MgwAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=dAIEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6924,4465370 News and pictures of her progress were intermingled with press releases about the progress of metrication. By the end of 1972 the temperature scale, road signs, and measures used in the sale of such items as wool and milk had been metricated. Only a few letters voiced outright opposition to the changeover. ==Exceptions== Although New Zealand completed metrication in the 1970s, a 1992 study of university students found that at that time there was a continued use of imperial units for birth weight and human height alongside metric units.\"Human use of metric measures of length\" . Dignan, J. R. E., & O'Shea, R. P. (1995). New Zealand Journal of Psychology, 24, 21\u201325. On the 30th anniversary of the introduction of the metric system in December 2006, the New Zealand Consumer Affairs Minister, Judith Tizard, commented that \"Now 30 years on the metric system is part of our daily lives\" but noted some continuing use of imperial measurements in some birth announcements of baby weights and also with people's heights. Screen sizes for devices such as televisions, monitors and phones, and wheel rim sizes for vehicles, are stated in inches, as is the convention in the rest of the world. The aviation industry is one of the last major users of the old imperial system: altitude and airport elevation is measured in feet. All other aspects (fuel quantity, aircraft weight, runway length, etc.) use metric. ==References== ==External links== * Weights and Measures Act 1987 * Metrication in New Zealand New Zealand Category:Science and technology in New Zealand ",
