They were declared a Natural Monument in 1974.Tetas De Maria Guevara Natural Monument The western hill, the higher, is only 75 m high, but they stand out in the surrounding flat arid plain and are easily seen from the ferry. One of the local legends say that these breast- shaped hills were named and given to a mestiza woman from Cuman\u00e1 called Maria Guevara who fought in the Venezuelan War of Independence and breast fed soldiers. She had two sons of whom she breast fed as adults which is thought to be the reason of why they were such great warriors, hence the hills were named after her breasts. The estate was lost after her death and the Guevara family were never able to claim it their own, as the deeds of the island, documenting Marias possession of it were hidden in a papaya fruit. However, her tomb lies beneath the hills of the mountains.Turismo por Venezuela - Las Tetas de Mar\u00eda Guevara ==See also== *Isla Margarita *Breast-shaped hill ==References== ==External links== * Just Venezuela - Las Tetas de Maria Guevara *Parque Nacional Laguna de La Restinga *Tetas De Maria Guevara Category:Isla Margarita Category:Mountains of Venezuela Category:Natural monuments of Venezuela Category:Geography of Nueva Esparta ",
