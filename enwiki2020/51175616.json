It is an archeological site in Ramales de la Victoria. It is known for a skeleton belonging to a woman nicknamed The Red Lady of El Mir\u00f3n. She is estimated to have died around 18,700 years ago, during the Upper Paleolithic (Magdalenian). The skeleton is examined to that of someone between 35 and 40 years. Her bones were coated with ochre, a red iron-based pigment, hence, her name. Striation-engraved red deer scapula from El Mir\u00f3n Cave. The cave was discovered in 1903 by amateur archaeologists Hermilio Alcalde del R\u00edo and Lorenzo Sierra. It contains a rich collection of Upper Paleolithic art. Among the prominent arts are those of an engraving of a horse and possibly one of a bison. The first systematic excavation started only in 1996. The team of archaeologists, led by Lawrence Straus of the University of New Mexico and Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Morales of the University of Cantabria, made a discovery of a number of prehistoric remains. The Red Lady was discovered in 2010. The cave contains a large limestone block towards the rear. A narrow space running through the block was the location of the skeleton.. ==References== Category:Paleoanthropological sites Category:Archaeological sites in Spain Category:Caves of Cantabria Category:Magdalenian Category:Art of the Upper Paleolithic ",
