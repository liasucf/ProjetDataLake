SongwriterUniverse. Retrieved February 11, 2012. The song was first recorded by Kamahl in 1982 for a country and western album he was recording. Kamahl talked about being the first to record the song in an appearance on Australian TV show Spicks and Specks but stated it was not commercially released because it was felt he did not suit the country and western style. Instead, Roger Whittaker recorded the song, as well as Sheena Easton and Lee Greenwood. The song appeared shortly thereafter in charted versions by Colleen Hewett (1982), Lou Rawls (1983), Gladys Knight & the Pips (1983), and Gary Morris (1983). The highest-charting version of the song to date was recorded in 1988 by singer and actress Bette Midler for the soundtrack to the film Beaches. This version was released as a single in early 1989, spent one week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in June 1989, and won Grammy Awards for both Record of the Year and Song of the Year in February 1990. On October 24, 1991, Midler's single was also certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipment of one million copies in the United States. In 2004 Midler's version finished at No. 44 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs survey of top tunes in American cinema. Perry Como recorded the song for his final studio album Today, released by RCA Records in 1987. Como wanted \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" released as a single, but RCA refused; Como was reportedly so angry, he vowed to never record for RCA Records ever again. In a 2002 UK poll, \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" was found to be the most- played song at British funerals. ==Background== Silbar and Henley recorded a demo of the song, which they gave to musician Bob Montgomery. Montgomery then recorded his own demo version of the song, changing it from the mid-tempo version he was given to a ballad. Silbar and Henley then offered the song to many artists, which eventually resulted in Roger Whittaker becoming the first to release the song commercially. It appears on his 1982 studio album, also titled The Wind Beneath My Wings. The song was shortly thereafter recorded by Australian artist Colleen Hewett and released by Avenue Records in 1982. Hewitt's recording became the first version of the song to be issued as a single and to appear on a national chart, peaking at No. 52 on Australia's Kent Music Report chart.

She also noted Midler's \"demonstrative interpretation\". Stephen Holden from The New York Times noted in his review of the Beaches soundtrack, that \"one is reminded of just how powerful a pop singer Ms. Midler can be when handed the right song and an arrangement that doesn't constrict her brash, larger-than-life personality.\" He added that \"the most effective numbers are dramatic ballads\" like \"Wind Beneath My Wings\". People Magazine wrote that the song \"articulates the movie's theme of enduring friendship, and Midler's heartfelt delivery conveys the message a lot more succinctly and satisfyingly than the film.\" The Stage noted that the song, \"a cabaret favourite for several years now\", has been \"given a new lease of life because it has been recorded by Bette Midler.\"\"Sing a song in season\". The Stage. August 3, 1989. page 10. Retrieved March 29, 2020. John Louie from The Stanford Daily called it a \"sweet, melodious ballad\". ===Music video=== Bette Midler in the black-and-white music video. The music video for \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" was made in black-and-white. It opens with a light-haired girl meeting a dark-haired girl under the dock on a beach. They befriend each other and walk along the beach together. Occasionally throughout the video, Midler performs on a stage, dressed in a black dress and long curly hair. Her arms are crossed. The girls dances on the beach until the dark-haired finds a long stick, which she writes in the sand with. The light-haired girl continues to dance alone. Toward the end, the dark-haired falls onto the sand and starts digging in it. She finds a doll buried in the sand and pushes it to her chest. As the video ends, the light-haired girl goes beyond the horizon. ===Track listing=== 7\": US (Atlantic 7-88972) 7\": UK (Atlantic A8972) 7\": Japan (Atlantic PRS-2048) 3\": Japan (Atlantic 09P3-6159) # \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" # \"Oh Industry\" 12\": UK (Atlantic A8972T) 3\": UK (Atlantic A8972CD) # \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" # \"Oh Industry\" # \"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\" CDM: US (Atlantic PR2615-2) promo # \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" (edit) # \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" (album version) CDM: Germany (Atlantic 756785481-2) # \"Wind Beneath My Wings\" # \"From a Distance\" # \"In My Life\" # \"To Deserve You\" Note: Released in 1996 ===Charts=== ====Weekly charts==== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1989\u20131990, 1996\u20131997 and 2008) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA Charts) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) | 21 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 10) | 2 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand (RIANZ) | 4 |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles (Official Charts Company) | 5 |- ! scope=\"row\" |- ! scope=\"row\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2008) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles (Official Charts Company) | 70 |} ====Year-end charts==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1989) !align=\"center\"|Position |- |Canada Top Singles (RPM) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|31 |- |United States (Billboard) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|7 |} ==Other versions== In the 1990s, two English actor/singers released their versions as singles.
