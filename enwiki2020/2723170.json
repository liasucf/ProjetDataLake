    "text": "St. John's-Ravenscourt School (commonly referred to as SJR) is an independent, co-educational, university-preparatory school founded in 1820. Located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, the school delivers an enriched curriculum from Kindergarten through Grade 12. Elizabeth II, as Queen of Canada, is the royal patron of the school. The school offers a boarding option starting in grade 8. ==History== The school was founded in 1820 by Rev. John West as the Red River Mission School for the children of early Selkirk settlers and select aboriginal children.Manitoba Historical Society. \"St. John's Ravenscourt School\". http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/organization/sjr.shtml The School was originally built on the banks of the Red River in Selkirk, and then relocated by Rev. David Thomas Jones to the west bank of the river near present-day St. John's Park. In 1834, the School recorded 20 boys and 21 girls attending the renamed Red River Academy. The Academy was purchased in 1849 by the Bishop of Rupertsland, David Anderson, and was renamed St. John's Collegiate.Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online. \"Anderson, David\". http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=39461 In 1866, the school's name was changed to St. John's College School. The school's campus was expanded to include buildings on Main Street and Anderson Avenue, and stood as a landmark until their demolition in the early 1950s. In 1929, Norman Young became the first headmaster of Ravenscourt. Young had been encouraged by a group of Winnipeg businessmen, who promised that their sons would attend. The school was originally located at Armstrong's Point on the Assiniboine River.Manitoba Historical Society. \"A Walking Tour of Armstrong's Point\". http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/mb_history/05/armstrongpttour.shtml In 1934, it was relocated to a house built by Colonel R.M. Thomson.Thomson A, Lafortune S. Handbook of Canadian Boarding Schools. Toronto: Dundurn Press, 1999, p 241 The unfinished home was located in Fort Garry on the banks of the Red River. The new facility was soon expanded to include the Richardson Gymnasium, the first gym in Western Canada to sport a basketball court. In 1950, the Board of Anglican churchmen that as a group governed St. John's College decided to close the school. This decision upset the alumni of the school, and the alumni sought a way to continue their school. It was finally decided that St. John's College School would be amalgamated with Ravenscourt. The two schools became St. John's-Ravenscourt. After the flood of 1950, many new facilities were added to the school, notably an arena, and a junior school building. In 1971, the school made the decision to readmit girls to the school.Thomson, A. \"Secondary Education in Manitoba in 1994\". https://zone.biblio.laurentian.ca/dspace/bitstream/10219/187/5/Manitoba.pdf In November 1981, Her Majesty the Queen granted her patronage to the School, and one year later gave permission for the creation of scholarship in her name to mark the event of her patronage. In 2004, Kindergarten Classes and the Music Room were created for the junior school, and girls were allowed into Junior School. From 2008 through 2017, St. John's-Ravenscourt School was named one of Manitoba's Top Employers, announced by the Winnipeg Free Press newspaper. Today, the school's student population has increased to just over 800 students, with full integration of girls in all grades since 2007. In 2014, the new Richardson Senior School and Riley Fitness Centre were opened. The renovation project was done by Bockstael Construction in association with Stantec Architects. ==Campus== St. John's-Ravenscourt School has a large, well designed campus with several different buildings serving multiple or specific purposes.
