In Autumn 2006 BSM launched its first sub-label, Alcopop! Records. Alcopop! began working with bands such as Johnny Foreigner, Anamanaguchi, Fight Like Apes and others. On 7 September 2010, the label celebrated its 100th release. Partied Hard was a DVD/CD compilation featuring over thirty promo, live and bonus videos from the label's history. It was only available between 7 September (the day after BSM099 came out) and 24 October 2010 (the day before BSM101 was due out). In April 2011 BSM co- founded Pink Mist with fellow indie labels Holy Roar and Blood And Biscuits. A 12\" compilation was released on Record Store Day to mark the launch. Pink Mist is an East London-based collective releasing records, promoting regular live shows and blogging about up and coming new bands. In 2012 it was nominated for Best Small Label at the AIM Awards. Kevin Douch was featured as a speaker at AIM's Indie Con event in 2017. Big Scary Monsters have announced new albums from Lemuria, Yndi Halda, Nervus and Tangled Hair for 2018 as well as a vinyl reissue of Hell Is For Heroes' 'The Neon Handshake'. From 2007 to 2016 BSM hosted an annual five-a-side football tournament at Wembley Powerleague, with bands, labels, magazines, shops and other music industry teams competing. ==Pop Up Stores== In December 2016 the label announced that they'd be opening up a Pop Up Store in Hackney London from January 23 to February 4 in 2017. This two week period was eventually catalogued as BSM200 and was a celebration of the labels 16th birthday. During the pop up were in-store performances from the likes of Modern Baseball, Kevin Devine, Gnarwolves, Delta Sleep, Beach Slang and more. There were also other non-music based events including, a-bring-your-dog day, a screen printing day with Awesome Merchandise, and a cocktail bar run by the band Tiny Moving Parts. During March 2018 BSM announced they would be opening their second pop up store in Cardiff. The in- store featured performances from UK based signings, Jamie Lenman, Orchards, Nervus and US band Slaughter Beach, Dog. In 2019 BSM continued its run of form and announced their Pop Up Store would be coming to Glasgow in Scotland. Over their time there the label hosted in store performances from We Were Promised Jetpacks and in store talks from prominent Scottish music figures.>br> ==Reissues== Over the last few years BSM have continued to reissue classic yet niche releases from the early 00's. \\- The Gloria Record - A Lull In Traffic - 2020 Released to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the EP's original release. \\- And So I Watch You From Afar - ASIWYFA - 2019 A 10th anniversary reissue featuring a remastering of the original record and a live recording of the band performing their debut record all consisting in a 4LP box set. \\- Hell Is For Heroes - Neon Handshake - 2018 A celebration of the band's debut album turning 15 \\- Reuben - In Nothing We Trust - 2017 Less of a reissue and more of a first press.
