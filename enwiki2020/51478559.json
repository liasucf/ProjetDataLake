Peter and Paul in \u0160iauliai () also called \u0160iauliai Cathedral is a religious building of the Catholic Church that serves as the cathedral in \u0160iauliai, a city in the European country of Lithuania, and the seat of the diocese of \u0160iauliai. Interior of the cathedral ==History== The Church of Saints Peter and Paul was built in the seventeenth century, between 1617 and 1626, and is a significant example of the Renaissance and Mannerism. In 1880, lightning struck a tower, so it was necessary to make repairs. The most significant damage occurred after World War II. In 1944 the church was in a sorry state, but already during the Soviet era, the church was restored. Simultaneously with the creation of the Diocese of Siauliai on May 28, 1997, the Church of Saints Peter and Paul was elevated to the status of cathedral by Pope John Paul II. ==See also== *Roman Catholicism in Lithuania *Sts.
