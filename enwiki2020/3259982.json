    "text": "Gottfried and Brigitte John in 2004 Gottfried John (;Unlike the common English name John, the German pronunciation begins with a \"y\" sound. 29 August 1942 \u2013 1 September 2014) was a German stage, screen, and voice actor. A long-time collaborator of Rainer Werner Fassbinder, John appeared in many of the filmmaker's projects between 1975 and his death in 1982, including Eight Hours Don't Make a Day, Mother K\u00fcsters Goes to Heaven, Despair, The Marriage of Maria Braun, and Berlin Alexanderplatz. His distinctive, gaunt appearance saw him frequently cast as villains, and he is best known to audiences for his role as the corrupt General Arkady Ourumov in the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye, and for his comedic turn as Julius Caesar in Asterix & Obelix Take On Caesar, the latter for which he won the Bavarian Film Award for Best Supporting Actor. ==Early life== John was born in Berlin, Germany on 29 August 1942. In World War II he and his mother were evacuated to East Prussia; his father, whom he never met, was married to another woman. He grew up with his single parent mother and in several protectories; John fled from such a protectory when he was 15 years old and returned to his mother, who was living in Paris. In Paris he earned a living as a pavement artist and construction worker, and returned to Berlin in 1960. ==Career== During the 1970s and early 1980s, John was cast by director Rainer Werner Fassbinder in several of his projects, in particular as Reinhold in the Berlin Alexanderplatz (1980) mini- series. He was internationally known for his portrayal of General Arkady Ourumov in the James Bond film GoldenEye and Julius Caesar in Asterix and Obelix take on Caesar. ==Personal life== John lived with his wife, Brigitte, in Utting am Ammersee from 2008 until his death in 2014. On 1 September 2014, it was announced that John had died in Utting am Ammersee near Munich, Germany of cancer at the age of 72. ==Works== ===Filmography=== * Caf\u00e9 Oriental (1962) (uncredited) * Das M\u00e4dchen und der Staatsanwalt (1962) as Train passenger (uncredited) * Jaider, der einsame J\u00e4ger (1971) as Jaider * Carlos (1971, TV Movie) as Carlos * Eight Hours Don't Make a Day (1972\u20131973, TV Series) as Jochen * World on a Wire (1973, TV Movie) as Einstein * Mother K\u00fcsters' Trip to Heaven (1975) as Niemeyer * Der Kommissar: Der Held des Tages (1976, TV series episode) as Werner Stimmel * Derrick: Das Superding (1976, TV series episode) as Krummbach * Und Rosa und Marilyn und ...
