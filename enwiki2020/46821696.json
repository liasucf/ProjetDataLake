    "text": "The 2015 Pacific hurricane season was the second-most active Pacific hurricane season on record, and featured the strongest tropical cyclone ever observed in the Western Hemisphere: Hurricane Patricia. The season officially started on May 15 in the Eastern Pacific\u2014east of 140\u00b0W\u2014and on June 1 in the Central Pacific\u2014between the International Date Line and 140\u00b0W\u2014and ended on November 30\\. These dates typically cover the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Northeastern Pacific tropical cyclone basin. The season's first storm, Hurricane Andres, developed on May 28; the season's final storm, Tropical Depression Nine-C, dissipated on December 31, well after the official end of the season. Throughout the season, 31 tropical depressions developed, 26 of which became tropical storms, a record-tying 16 of them reached hurricane strength, and a record-breaking 11 achieved major hurricane intensity. Activity in the Central Pacific shattered records, with 16 tropical cyclones forming in or entering the basin; the previous highest was 11 during the 1992 and 1994 seasons. On August 30, three hurricanes at Category 4 strength\u2014Ignacio, Jimena, and Kilo\u2014existed simultaneously in the Northeastern Pacific, which was a first for the basin. On October 23, Hurricane Patricia became the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere, with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 872 mbar (hPa; 25.75 inHg) and maximum sustained winds of 215 mph (345 km/h). Activity in the basin was boosted by the strong 2014\u201316 El Ni\u00f1o event, which brought anomalously high sea surface temperatures and low vertical wind shear that helped the numerous systems form and intensify. Four time zones are utilized in the basin: Central for storms east of 106.0\u00b0W, Mountain from 106.0\u00b0W to 114.9\u00b0W, Pacific from 115.0\u00b0W to 140.0\u00b0W, and Hawaii\u2013Aleutian for storms between the International Date Line and 140\u00b0W. However, for convenience, all information is listed by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) first with the respective local time included in parentheses. This timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center are included. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season. ==Timeline of events== ImageSize = width:800 height:220 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:20 left:20 Legend = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270 AlignBars = early DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/05/2015 till:01/02/2016 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/05/2015 Colors = id:canvas value:gray(0.88) id:GP value:red id:TD value:rgb(0.38,0.73,1) legend:Tropical_Depression_=_\u226439_mph_(0\u201362_km/h) id:TS value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96) legend:Tropical_Storm_=_39\u201373_mph_(63\u2013117_km/h) id:C1 value:rgb(1,1,0.80) legend:Category_1_=_74\u201395_mph_(118\u2013153_km/h) id:C2 value:rgb(1,0.91,0.46) legend:Category_2_=_96\u2013110_mph_(154\u2013177_km/h) id:C3 value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25) legend:Category_3_=_111\u2013129_mph_(178\u2013208_km/h) id:C4 value:rgb(1,0.56,0.13) legend:Category_4_=_130\u2013156_mph_(209\u2013251_km/h) id:C5 value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38) legend:Category_5_=_\u2265157_mph_(\u2265252_km/h) Backgroundcolors = canvas:canvas BarData = barset:Hurricane bar:Month PlotData= barset:Hurricane width:11 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till from:28/05/2015 till:04/06/2015 color:C4 text:\"Andres (C4)\" from:31/05/2015 till:09/06/2015 color:C4 text:\"Blanca (C4)\" from:10/06/2015 till:17/06/2015 color:C1 text:\"Carlos (C1)\" from:08/07/2015 till:10/07/2015 color:TS text:\"Ela (TS)\" from:10/07/2015 till:12/07/2015 color:TS text:\"Halola (TS)\" from:10/07/2015 till:13/07/2015 color:TS text:\"Iune (TS)\" from:11/07/2015 till:19/07/2015 color:C4 text:\"Dolores (C4)\" from:12/07/2015 till:18/07/2015 color:TS text:\"Enrique (TS)\" barset:break from:23/07/2015 till:25/07/2015 color:TS text:\"Felicia (TS)\" from:27/07/2015 till:30/07/2015 color:TD text:\"Eight-E (TD)\" from:29/07/2015 till:07/08/2015 color:C2 text:\"Guillermo (C2)\" from:06/08/2015 till:14/08/2015 color:C4 text:\"Hilda (C4)\" from:16/08/2015 till:17/08/2015 color:TD text:\"Eleven-E (TD)\" from:21/08/2015 till:26/08/2015 color:C1 text:\"Loke (C1)\" from:22/08/2015 till:01/09/2015 color:C4 text:\"Kilo (C4)\" from:25/08/2015 till:05/09/2015 color:C4 text:\"Ignacio (C4)\" barset:break from:26/08/2015 till:09/09/2015 color:C4 text:\"Jimena (C4)\" from:31/08/2015 till:05/09/2015 color:TS text:\"Kevin (TS)\" from:05/09/2015 till:10/09/2015 color:C3 text:\"Linda (C3)\" from:19/09/2015 till:22/09/2015 color:TS text:\"Malia (TS)\" from:20/09/2015 till:21/09/2015 color:TD text:\"Sixteen-E (TD)\" from:25/09/2015 till:28/09/2015 color:TS text:\"Niala (TS)\" from:26/09/2015 till:01/10/2015 color:C1 text:\"Marty (C1)\" from:03/10/2015 till:08/10/2015 color:C2 text:\"Oho (C2)\" barset:break from:03/10/2015 till:04/10/2015 color:TD text:\"Eight-C (TD)\" from:09/10/2015 till:15/10/2015 color:TS text:\"Nora (TS)\" from:15/10/2015 till:27/10/2015 color:C4 text:\"Olaf (C4)\" from:20/10/2015 till:24/10/2015 color:C5 text:\"Patricia (C5)\" from:18/11/2015 till:22/11/2015 color:TS text:\"Rick (TS)\" from:23/11/2015 till:28/11/2015 color:C4 text:\"Sandra (C4)\" from:31/12/2015 till:31/12/2015 color:TD text:\"Nine-C (TD)\" bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas from:01/05/2015 till:01/06/2015 text:May from:01/06/2015 till:01/07/2015 text:June from:01/07/2015 till:01/08/2015 text:July from:01/08/2015 till:01/09/2015 text:August from:01/09/2015 till:01/10/2015 text:September from:01/10/2015 till:01/11/2015 text:October from:01/11/2015 till:01/12/2015 text:November from:01/12/2015 till:01/01/2016 text:December from:01/01/2016 till:01/02/2016 text:Jan.
