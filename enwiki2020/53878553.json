At the same time, Mariana abandons Juan Carlos, and again, he begins an affair with Natalia's best friend. When she discovers the truth, Natalia realises that the people around her are worthless. All these events will just go to show Juan Carlos that Natalia is the love of his life, but it may be too late for him.
