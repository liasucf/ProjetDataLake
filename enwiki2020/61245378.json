    "text": "High School is a 2019 memoir by twin sisters Sara Quin and Tegan Quin, of the Canadian indie pop group Tegan and Sara. It is their first book and was published on September 24, 2019 by Simon & Schuster Canada. It recounts their childhood and adolescence growing up in Alberta in the 1990s as well as their musical beginnings. It was published three days before the release of Tegan and Sara's ninth studio album, Hey, I'm Just Like You, which contains re- recordings of unreleased demo songs that the duo recorded as teenagers. The book won a 2020 Alex Award. ==Summary== The book covers the sisters' childhood and adolescence and their first relationships while growing up during the mid-1990s as queer teenagers in Calgary, Alberta. It also covers their musical beginnings, up until their career began to take off. It is written in alternating chapters from both Tegan's point of view and Sara's. ==Publication== High School was announced on December 11, 2018, nine months ahead of its publication. The book was published on September 24, 2019 by Simon & Schuster Canada in Canada, by MCD, an imprint of Farrar, Straus and Giroux, in the United States and Virago Press (Hachette UK) in the United Kingdom. The book debuted at number fifteen on The New York Times Hardcover Nonfiction best-sellers list on October 13, 2019. ==Reception== Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly gave the book positive reviews, but both magazines felt that the memoir would mostly appeal to those who are already fans of the band.\" Jancee Dunn, writing for The Washington Post, gave the book a positive review, calling the sisters \"skilled writers with an eye for detail\" and praising their account of their experience as twins and as teenagers, but lamented that the book suffered from the \"stream-of-consciousness verbosity\" of a diary. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone praised the book, calling it \"a quietly heroic rock and roll origin story\" and writing, \"Those explosively detailed depictions of their earliest experiences trying to find girlfriends are worthy of an excellent YA novel, thanks to Tegan or Sara's unsparingly real, matter- of-fact prose style.\" Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic wrote, \"While Tegan and Sara are hilarious in their onstage banter, on the page their anecdotes read as spooky, solemn obstacle-running. A melancholy tone runs throughout. Queerness complicates what otherwise might seem like just hijinks.\" ==Publication history== * * * ==References== Category:2019 non-fiction books Category:English-language books Category:Canadian non-fiction books Category:Canadian memoirs Category:Literary collaborations Category:Tegan and Sara albums Category:Simon & Schuster books Category:Music autobiographies Category:Lesbian non-fiction books Category:LGBT literature in Canada Category:2010s LGBT literature Category:LGBT autobiographies ",
