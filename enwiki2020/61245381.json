The E-League Premiership Rounds is a nine-round period. Each team will play each other club once in a two-legged tie format with two games being played in each division. A win gives the winning team 3 points, a draw gives both teams 1 point and a loss for the losing team gets 0 points. When there is no result, both teams get 0 points as well. FFA also reserves the right to regulate the result of any match played including a \"no result\". The goals from each division will be aggregated to determine the winner for each Club each round within both Xbox One and PlayStation 4 games. If a player/competitor forfeits a game, the result will be a 3\u20130 loss for that player, unless that forfeit will take place during the match and the current goal difference is greater than being 3 goals up. The goal difference will result as a 3\u20130 final score. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 establishments in Australia Category:Sports leagues established in 2018 Category:A-League Category:Esports leagues Category:FIFA (video game series) competitions Category:Fox Sports (Australian TV network) original programming ",
