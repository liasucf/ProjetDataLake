At a meeting held in May, 1906, in Kokomo, she was elected to serve as treasurer of the Indiana Auxiliary of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. At a suffrage convention held between 16 and 17 March 1909 in Logansport, Barnard was re-elected treasurer. Barnard was still serving as treasurer of the Indiana Auxiliary in 1914 and archival records at the Indiana Historical Society show she had correspondence with Carrie Chapman Catt.

Her husband who was the director of the Indiana State Food and Drug Commission, supported these efforts closing down bakeries and unsanitary businesses that handled food. Barnard also started the Indianapolis Social Register and was one of the founding members of the Irvington Dancing Club. She and her husband had two children.
