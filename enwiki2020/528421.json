It is a bulbous perennial that grows wild in dry places, reaching in height. It reproduces by seed, bulbs and by the production of small bulblets in the flower head (similarly to Allium vineale). Unlike A. vineale, it is very rare with A. oleraceum to find flower-heads containing bulbils only. In addition, the spathe in A. oleraceum is in two parts.The Reader's Digest Field Guide to the Wild Flowers of Britain p.382.Linnaeus, Carl von. 1753. Species Plantarum 1: 299. Its specific epithet oleraceum means \"vegetable/herbal\" in Latin and is a form of (). ==Description== Allium oleraceum grows to a height of about . The underground bulb is up to in diameter. The main stem is usually rounded, but is occasionally flattened, and bears two to four leaves and a terminal inflorescence composed of a number of small, stalked, pinkish-brown flowers and sometimes a few bulblets. The papery bracts have long points which often much overtop the flowers, the stamens of which do not protrude. == Distribution == Allium oleraceum is widespread across most of Europe, with additional populations in Turkey and the Caucasus.Allium oleraceum L. Altervista Flora Italiana It is sparingly naturalised in scattered locations in North America.Flora of North America v 26 p 238, Allium oleraceumBONAP (Biota of North America Program), floristic synthesis, Allium oleraceumGleason, H.

In the United Kingdom, A. oleraceum is found in dry, grassy places, usually steeply sloping and calcareous soils, and on open sunny banks in river floodplains. A. oleraceum is scattered throughout England and very scattered in Wales, Scotland and Ireland. Erosion of coastal areas leads to a reduction in the available habitat for this species, leading to population declines.UK Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (GRFA) . The highest altitude from which it has been recorded in Britain is in Dovedale, Derbyshire. Allium oleraceum subsp. girerdii was formerly included, but is now classified as Allium oporinanthum. == See also == * Allium vineale * Allium monanthum ==References== Category:Garlic oleraceum Category:Flora of Europe Category:Flora of temperate Asia Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
