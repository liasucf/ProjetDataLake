    "text": "Suiten mon, main gate of the shrine Nanamori-zuka, tomb of Taira clan warriors ' is a Shinto shrine in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan. It is dedicated to Antoku, a Japanese emperor who died as a child in the Battle of Dan-no-ura (aka Dannoura), which occurred nearby in 1185. This battle was important in the history of Japan because it brought an end to Genpei War in which the Minamoto clan defeated the rival Taira clan, and ended the Taira bid for control of Japan. The shrine is situated on the waterfront of the Kanmon Strait, between the centre of Shimonoseki and the tourist restaurants of Karato, Kanmon Wharf. The bright red main gate makes it a very visible sight. ==Description== The colours and style of the gate are inspired by Ry\u016bg\u016b-j\u014d, according to the Shimonoseki Tourist GuidebookShimonoseki Tourist Guidebook, a pamphlet published by the Shimonoseki City Tourism Department, March 2007, in Japanese. published by the Shimonoseki City Tourism Department. This source states that Antoku's grandmother, Nii-no-Ama, who drowned with Antoku, wished for their palace to be created underwater as she jumped into the sea. Ry\u016bg\u016b-j\u014d is a mythical underwater palace, belonging to the dragon god of the sea. In the Tale of Heike, Nii-no-Ama told Antoku, before jumping, that they would go to an underwater palace, without referring to Ry\u016bg\u016b-j\u014d. Then, Antoku's mother (Kenreimon-In, aka Taira no Tokuko) had a dream, in which they were living in Ry\u016bg\u016b-j\u014d. Inside, in the Hoichi Hall, is a statue of Hoichi the Earless, one of the characters in a traditional ghost story which was made known in the west by Lafcadio Hearn. The grounds also contain the Nanamori-zuka (seven mounds), which represent the Heike warriors also lost in the Battle of Dan-no- Ura. ==Kanpei-sha== In 1871, the identified the hierarchy of government- supported shrines most closely associated with the Imperial family.Ponsonby- Fane, Richard.
