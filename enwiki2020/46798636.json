Organised by the Arab Athletic Federation, it took place in Rabat, Morocco from 31 July to 2 August. A total of thirty-nine events were contested, of which 20 by male and 19 by female athletes, identically matching the programme of the 2003 World Youth Championships in Athletics.Pan Arab Youth Championships.

Five athletes completed individual doubles at the tournament. On the boys' side, Omani Abdullah Al-Sooli won a 100 metres/200 metres short sprint double and Abdalaati Iguider of Morocco took both middle-distance titles. On the girls' side, Nawal El Jack of Sudan won both the 400 metres flat and 400 metres hurdles, Jordan's Rima Taha won both horizontal jumps, and Egypt's Sara Es Sayed Hassib Dardiri won the shot put and discus throw. The host nation Morocco easily topped the table with a total of fourteen golds among its 42 medals. The Next most successful nations were Egypt, with six gold medals, and Sudan, with five gold medals from its haul of 17. Saudi Arabia and Algeria were the other stand-out nations, having each won thirteen medals. A total of twelve nations reached the medal table. The competition was held in the same year as the 2004 Arab Junior Athletics Championships. The youth event subsequently became a biennial event held in odd-numbered years, in order to avoid the schedule clash. Three champions from the youth championships also won an Arab junior title that year, all from the throw events: Mostafa Abdul El-Moaty won the shot put titles, Yasser Mohamed Ali Hassan had a javelin throw double, and Iman Mohamed El Ashri was twice hammer throw winner.Pan Arab Junior Championships.
