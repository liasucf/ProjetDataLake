Supposedly, he almost managed to outrun them, but he came to a bean field and refused to run through it because he had prohibited beans as ritually unclean. Since cutting through the field would violate his own teachings, Pythagoras simply stopped running and was killed. This story may have been fabricated by Neanthes of Cyzicus, on whom both Diogenes and Iamblichus rely as a source. |- !scope=\"row\" | Heraclitus of Ephesus | center | 475 BC | According to one account given by Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, the Greek philosopher Heraclitus was said to have been devoured by dogs after smearing himself with cow manure in an attempt to cure his dropsy. |- !scope=\"row\" | Themistocles | center | 459 BC | Themistocles, the Athenian general who won the Battle of Salamis, actually died of natural causes in exile,Thucydides I, 138 but was widely rumored to have committed suicide by drinking bull's blood.Plutarch Themistocles, 31 Diodorus XI, 58 Since bull's blood is not actually poisonous, Themistocles cannot have died in this way, but the legend is widely retold in classical sources. The early twentieth-century English classicist Percy Gardner proposed that the story about him drinking bull's blood may have been based on an ignorant misunderstanding of a statue showing Themistocles in a heroic pose, holding a cup as an offering to the gods. The comedic playwright Aristophanes references Themistocles drinking bull's blood in his comedy The Knights (performed in 324 BC) as the most heroic way for a man to die.Aristophanes 84\u201385 |- !scope=\"row\" | Aeschylus | center | 455 BC | According to Valerius Maximus, Aeschylus, the eldest of the three great Athenian tragedians, was killed by a tortoise dropped by an eagle that had mistaken his bald head for a rock suitable for shattering the shell of the reptile.
