She also co- authored a handbook on the plants of Yosemite National Park. ==Biography== Carlotta Hall was born in Kingsville, Ohio, in 1880 to Adelaide Percy (Hardy) Case and Quincy A. Case. She studied botany at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating with a B.S. in 1904. In 1910 she married the botanist Harvey Monroe Hall, with whom she had a daughter, Martha, in 1916. Hall became a fern collector and an assistant professor of botany at the University of California, Berkeley. She published on ferns of the Pacific Coast and co-wrote the illustrated handbook A Yosemite Nature (1912) with her husband as a pocket-sized botanical guidebook to Yosemite National Park. The book covers more than 900 species, omitting only the grasses, sedges, and rushes. She was a member of the California Academy of Sciences and a corresponding member of several European scientific societies. A species of California fern, the tufted lacefern or Carlotta Hall's lace fern (Aspidotis carlotta-halliae), is named in her honor. Her papers, along with those of her husband and daughter, are held by UC Berkeley. ==Selected publications== As author; *\"Notholaena copelandii, a Newly Recognized Species of the Mexican Texano Region\".
