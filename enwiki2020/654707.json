    "text": "Maglemosian ( 9000 \u2013 6000 BC) is the name given to a culture of the early Mesolithic period in Northern Europe. In Scandinavia, the culture was succeeded by the Kongemose and Tardenoisian culture. ==Environment and location== The name originates from the Danish archeological site Maglemose, situated near G\u00f8rlev and H\u00f8ng on western Zealand, southwest of lake Tiss\u00f8. Here the first settlement of the culture was excavated in 1900, by George Sarauw. A German translation appeared in Pr\u00e4historische Zeitschrift in 1911 During the following century a long series of similar settlements were excavated from England to Poland and from Sk\u00e5ne in Sweden to northern France. When the Maglemosian culture flourished, sea levels were much lower than now and what is now mainland Europe and Scandinavia were linked with Britain. The cultural period overlaps the end of the last ice age, when the ice retreated and the glaciers melted. It was a long process and sea levels in Northern Europe did not reach current levels until almost 6000 BC, by which time they had inundated large territories previously inhabited by Maglemosian people. Therefore, there is hope that the emerging discipline of underwater archaeology may reveal interesting finds related to the Maglemosian culture in the future. ==Characteristics== The Maglemosian people lived in forest and wetland environments, using fishing and hunting tools made from wood, bone, and flint microliths. It appears that they had domesticated the dog. Some may have lived settled lives, but most were nomadic. Huts made of bark have been preserved, in addition to tools made of flint, bone, and horn. A characteristic of the culture are the sharply edged microliths of flintstone, used for spear and arrow heads.Med bue, pil og fiskespyd Gyldendals Open Encyclopedia . Pictures of some Maglemosian tools. Another notable feature is the leister, a characteristic type of fishing spear, used for gigging. ==Scandinavian data table== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Era !
