    "text": "Yema cake is a Filipino chiffon cake with a custard filling known as yema. It is generally prepared identically to mam\u00f3n (chiffon cakes and sponge cakes in Filipino cuisine), with the only difference being that it incorporates yema either as frosting, as filling, or as part of the cake batter. Yema is a custard-like combination of milk and egg yolks. It is also typically garnished with grated cheese. ==See also== * Flan cake *Brazo de Mercedes *Ube cake *Crema de fruta *Mango float * List of cakes ==References== Category:Philippine desserts Category:Cakes ",
