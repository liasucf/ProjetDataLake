    "text": "Rhyothemis princeps, known as the sapphire flutterer, is a species of dragonfly of the family Libellulidae. The flight of the genus Rhyothemis is usually fluttering, leading to the common description of \"flutterer\" for most species in the genus. Rhyothemis princeps is found in Australia and New Guinea only. It is a medium-sized dragonfly (wingspan 70mm, length 40mm) that inhabits a variety of freshwater lakes, ponds, and swamps. It has a dark blue to black abdomen, and its wings are dark, with two or three pale patches on the outer section. Males have dark patches extending to their wingtips, whereas females have clear wingtips. In sunlight the dark colours can reflect a metallic purplish tinge. In Australia its range is limited to north-eastern Queensland from Cape York Peninsula to around Rockhampton. ==Gallery== Rhyothemis princeps - Sapphire Flutterer 1.jpg|Male side view Sapphire Flutterer (Rhyothemis princeps) (29564129526).jpg|Male viewed from above Sapphire flutterer 2190-2.jpg|Male in Cairns Rhyothemis princeps female wings (34252012483).jpg|Female wings Rhyothemis princeps male wings (34252015673).jpg|Male wings ==See also== * List of Odonata species of Australia ==References== Category:Libellulidae Category:Odonata of Australia Category:Odonata of Asia Category:Insects of New Guinea Category:Taxa named by William Forsell Kirby Category:Insects described in 1894 ",
