Ida Frances Steloff was born to a poor family in Saratoga Springs, New York on December 31, 1887. Her mother died when she was young, and at 12 she was taken in by a couple who offered her a home. She dropped out of school in the seventh grade. At the age of 19, she moved to New York where she worked at Loeser's, a department store. Steloff then worked in several bookstores, and in 1920 founded the Gotham Book Mart. Steloff challenged government censorship, ordering smuggled copies of Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer in the 1930s and purchasing shipments of D. H. Lawrence's banned book Lady Chatterley's Lover in the late 1920s. Steloff married David Moss in 1923. They divorced in 1930. ==See also== * Frances Steloff: Memoirs of a Bookseller ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:1887 births Category:1989 deaths Category:American booksellers Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:People from Saratoga Springs, New York ",
