    "text": "Lagoa (; Portuguese for lagoon) is a municipality in the southwestern part of S\u00e3o Miguel Island in the Azores. The population in 2011 was 14,442,Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica in an area of 45.59 km\u00b2.Eurostat Lagoa is located east of Ponta Delgada, the island capital. ==History== The area of Lagoa was settled just after the first colonists came to the island of S\u00e3o Miguel, and its first inhabitants established their homes in the areas that would eventually form the villages of Lagoa and \u00c1gua de Pau. It is believed that early settlers chose the area for its sheltered bay, which was necessary for their loading and unloading of cargo, livestock and provisions. The Porto dos Carneiros was one of these areas, so named for the fact that sheep, as well as other animals, were offloaded within its cove.Porto dos Carneiros is translated from the Portuguese for \"port of the rams\", and is used to identify a natural harbor along the southern coast used for the shipment of goods and livestock during the early part of the settlement of S\u00e3o Miguel. The celebrated Portuguese historian, Father Gaspar Frutuoso referred to Lagoa, in the way that the first settlers named it, a name that was dependent on where they made their homes: :\u201cThe village of Lagoa, called this owing to the existence of a \"lake in front\" of the doors to the Church (a reef) and its port where [it was large enough for ships] to battle, where in the past there were large catches of fish, since the ocean would enter it, and the livestock would drink from its waters and others would pass time swimming in its waters...\" It was in the area of the Church of Santa Cruz that most of these original founders established their homes, near an ancient lake (long since dried up). In the 15th Century, the island of S\u00e3o Miguel continued to receive settlers and in Lagoa those colonists steadily settled farther to the west, around the bay that became known as Porto dos Carneiros, where fishing began to take on an important aspect of the local economy. To the east of the village of Lagoa, several families established agrarian settlements in the vicinity of \u00c1gua de Pau. Around 1515, due to its social and economic growth the village of \u00c1gua de Pau was elevated to Villa and made temporary municipal seat of the newly incorporated municipality of Lagoa. By this time, the historian Father Gaspar Frutuoso noted in his tome Saudades da Terra the 100 homes existed in the community; a comparable size to the other centers on the island, but only half the size of Ponta Delgada (250), Vila Franca do Campo (200) or Ribeira Grande (200). In 1522 (April 11) Lagoa, the village, became the municipal seat of the municipality, at a time when the population hovered around 1000 people and 300 homes. At the time, it was considered one of the more productive agricultural areas of the island, responsible for wheat, wine and woad production. Its port was the important regional point of entry and exit for many of its products, in addition to fishing center. The communities prosperity extended into the 19th century, when the village was the center of a flourishing ceramic industry and distillation of alcohol and spirits. By the 20th Century these industries were supplemented by factories for the production of vegetable oil, soap and animal feeds, at a time when agricultural production and the fishery was also dominant. At the end of the 20th Century, the tertiary sector had taken on a significant part of the areas economy (58.2% of the population was active in these activities), while the number of new companies involved in the sector grew (17.2%, between 2001 and 2004). ==Geography== ===Physical geography=== A view of the varied landscapes, including urban centre, rural pasturelands and mountainous interior The municipality is located on the southern coast of S\u00e3o Miguel, and nestled between the three larger municipalities of Ponta Delgada (to the west), Ribeira Grande (in the north) and Vila Franca do Campo (on the eastern frontier); its municipal seat is approximately nine kilometers from the principal city on the island (Ponta Delgada). It was created on April 11, 1522 by royal decree from King D. Jo\u00e3o III, and although the municipal seat was temporarily assigned to \u00c1gua de Pau, it is currently occupied by the urbanized core of Nossa Senhora do Ros\u00e1rio and Santa Cruz. Its small territory is relatively rich in biodiversity, influenced by its differentiated environmental characteristics between the Fogo volcano (the Serra de \u00c1gua de Pau) and the volcanic complex of Picos. Most of this space is occupied by pasturelands, cultivated tracts and, along the coast, an urbanized core. The cryptomeria, acacia and eucalyptus are just some of the variety of trees that populate the forests in the interior, while along the southern flank of Fogo, there are many endemic species of Erica azorica, Calluna vulgaris, the cedro- do-mato (Juniperus oxicedrus) the pau branco (Picconia azorica). ====Ecoregions & protected areas==== * Ponta da Galera \u2013 with an area of 220 ha (195 ha coast), the 7180 meter long coastal habitat has been designated under the Rede Natura 2000 designation (Code PTMIG0020) as a protected habitat, due to its number of shallow bays and coves, endemic vegetation, marine environments and species of flora and fauna. In addition to the Azorean heather (Erica azorica) and carnations (Spergularia azorica), the area is known as a home for pods of Harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), Common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the Loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta), as well as avian species of shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea boreallis) and Sterna. ===Climate=== The climate is, like much of the archipelago, temperate and maritime; the mean annual temperature is about , February being the coldest month ) and August the warmest ().

This was briefly interrupted at the end of the 1960s, with a wave of emigration (5% decrease in population) to the United States and Canada. Before this period, the 10.2% decrease in the population was attributed to the participation of many youth in the Portuguese contingent in World War I, and the post-war epidemic that developed. In the 1980s, the population has slowly rebounded (0.4%), while growth has marked in the 1990s, with 9.5% increase in population (1226 new residents). Since 1950, Lagoa has been constantly evolving, and in 2001 the residential area encompassed 4385 homes, that included many of the older heritage dwellings that have survived since colonization. Between 1991 and 2001, there was a 36% growth in the number of occupied dwellings in the urbanized core, while the communities of \u00c1gua de Pau and Santa Cruz have also grown markedly (25.3% and 24.3%, respectively).
