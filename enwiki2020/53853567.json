    "text": "The Quinimar\u00ed River () is a river in northwestern Venezuela. The Quinimar\u00ed River rises in the Tam\u00e1 Massif. It drains the southern slope of the T\u00e1chira depression. It is located in the municipality of C\u00f3rdoba in the state of T\u00e1chira, Venezuela. It joins the Torbes River and then flows into the Uribante River, a tributary of the Apure River, in the Orinoco basin. The Quinimar\u00ed basin holds extensive areas producing coffee and sugar cane, which are favored by the humid mountain climate of the area. The river is named after the \"Quenemar\u00edes\" indigenous people that inhabited this part of the Venezuelan Andes. Settlements on the river's banks include villages such as San Vicente de La Revancha, R\u00edo Chiquito, La Petrolea, Estaci\u00f3n Santa Ana and Santa Ana del T\u00e1chira, capital of the municipality. La Petrolea on the left bank is where oil exploration began in Venezuela in 1878 after a strong earthquake devastated the area and released the so-called \"black gold\" in the Quebrada La Alquitrana, a tributary just from the Quinimar\u00ed River. Oil still flows from the subsoil in small quantities, a factor that limits the use of the river as a tourist attraction. ==See also== *List of rivers of Venezuela ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:Rivers of Venezuela ",
