    "text": "Selex RAN-40L is a naval 3D L band search radar developed by Leonardo. The radar is used for long range maritime air surveillance and early warning. The radar uses a fully solid state active phased array antenna and capable of tracking and detecting air targets like aircraft or drones up to 400 km away. RAN-40L is based on existing land based 3D RAT-31DL radar which is a system widely used by NATO Countries for long air surveillance. The radar functions include Track While Scan for air and surface long-range surveillance and missile tracking . Radar coverage is obtained by phase scanning in elevation, while mechanically rotating in azimuth. The antenna rotates at 6rpm or 12rpm, with 360\u00b0 azimuth coverage. == See also == *Selex RAT-31DL *SMART-L *AN/SPY-3 *AN/SPY-6 *OPS-24 *OPS-50 *Type 346 Radar *Phased array *Active electronically scanned array *Active phased array radar == Operators == ; * Italian aircraft carrier Cavourhttp://www.aiad.it/aiad_res/cms/documents/SSICavourEN.pdf * Durand de la Penne-class destroyers == References == ; Category:Military radars of Italy Category:Naval radars Category:Military equipment of Italy ",
