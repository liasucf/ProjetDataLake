    "text": "Chenorhamphus is a genus of birds in the Australasian wren family, Maluridae. == Taxonomy and systematics == The species of the genus Chenorhamphus were formerly classified in the genus Malurus until a 2011 analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA showed high divergence between the two taxa resulting in them being re-split into separate species. The study also found them to lie in a separate clade with the genera Sipodotus and Clytomyias and distinct from the genus Malurus. This led to the subsequent re-classification of the species into their own genus, Chenorhamphus. The genus contains two species: * Broad-billed fairywren (Chenorhamphus grayi) * Campbell's fairywren (Chenorhamphus campbelli) ==References== ==External links== Category:Maluridae Category:Bird genera ",
