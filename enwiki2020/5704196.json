Thion, one of the most hard-working and underrated locks in world rugby, has played for France since 2003, representing them at the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia as well as captaining them in three tests in late 2005. He was also a part of the 2006 Six Nations Championship- winning side. Before playing rugby union, Thion played basketball for Entente Osny Cergy Pontoise and Pau-Orthez. In fact, he made the switch from basketball to rugby late enough in his life that under current regulations of LNR, which operates France's professional rugby union league, he does not qualify as a \"France-developed\" player. Thion's first club was AS Montferrand, where he stayed until 2001, then signing with USA Perpignan, where he stayed for two seasons, before moving to Biarritz, his current club. He made his debut for France on 14 June 2003 in the first of two matches against Argentina. Argentina won the match 10\u20136 at Jos\u00e9 Amalfitani Stadium in Buenos Aires. He was in the starting line-up of the subsequent test against the Pumas a week later, which was again won by Argentina, although only by one point, with the final score being 33\u201332. Thion played in the 31\u201323 loss to the All Blacks at Jade Stadium in Christchurch on June 28, as well as the 56\u20138 win over Romania on August 22. Thion started for France in their last test before the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. The game was played against England in Marseille, and was won by France by just one point, with the final score being 17\u201316. Thion was selected in France's 2003 World Cup squad. France made it to the semi-finals. He earned international caps for France playing in the November tests against Australia, the All Blacks and Argentina. Thion played in every match during the 2005 Six Nations Championship, as well as a test against Australia in November. After the Australian test, Thion captained France in a test match against Canada, which France won 50\u20136. Thion captained France on two more occasions that year, the 43\u20138 win over Tonga and the 26\u201320 win over the Springboks. In 2006, he played every match for France during the 2006 Six Nations Championship, which was won by France in the end. Biarritz made it to the 2005-06 Heineken Cup final, but were defeated by Munster. However, they went on to make it to the 2005-06 Top 14 final as well, where they beat Stade Toulousain to become the champions of France. In 2007, he helped France retain their 6 nations title, defeating Scotland in the final match by 47-19 allowing France to pip Ireland to the title. Thion then played in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, where France were hosts. France finished 4th with semi final defeat to England. ==References== ==External links== *Jerome Thion on lequipe.fr *Jerome Thion on rwc2003.com *Jerome Thion on scrum.com *Jerome Thion on ercrugby.com Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:People from Senlis Category:French rugby union players Category:Rugby union locks Category:ASM Clermont Auvergne players Category:Biarritz Olympique players Category:USA Perpignan players Category:France international rugby union players Category:Sportspeople from Oise ",
