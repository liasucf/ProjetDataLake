    "text": "The UCT Mathematics Competition is an annual mathematics competition for schools in the Western Cape province of South Africa, held at the University of Cape Town. Around 7000 participants from Grade 8 to Grade 12 take part, writing a multiple-choice paper. Individual and pair entries are accepted, but all write the same paper for their grade. The current holder of the School Trophy is Rondebosch Boys High School, with Diocesan College achieving second place in the 2018 competition. These two schools have held the top positions in the competition for a number of years. The competition was established in 1977 by Mona Leeuwenberg and Shirley Fitton, who were teachers at Diocesan College and Westerford High School, and since 1987 has been run by Professor John Webb of the University of Cape Town. ==Awards== ===Mona Leeuwenburg Trophy=== The Mona Leeuwenburg Trophy is awarded to the school with the best overall performance in the competition. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- | colspan=\"3\"| Recipients of the Mona Leeuwenburg Trophy |- !
