The manga is licensed by Seven Seas Entertainment for publication in North America, with the first volume to be published in June 2020. == Plot == Love Me for Who I Am follows non-binary high school student Mogumo, who lives away from their family home. At school, fellow student Tetsu Iwaoka invites them to work at Question!, a maid caf\u00e9.
