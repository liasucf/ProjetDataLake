Emericella venezuelensis, a new species with stellate ascospores producing sterigmatocystin and aflatoxin B1. Systematic and Applied Microbiology. 27:672-680 It has been shown to produce aflatoxin B1 and sterigmatocystin. In 2016, the genome of A. venezuelensis was sequenced as a part of the Aspergillus whole-genome sequencing project - a project dedicated to performing whole-genome sequencing of all members of the genus Aspergillus.https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Aspven1/Aspven1.home.html The genome assembly size was 34.84 Mbp. ==Growth and morphology== Aspergillus venezuelensis has been cultivated on both Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA) plates and Malt Extract Agar Oxoid\u00ae (MEAOX) plates. The growth morphology of the colonies can be seen in the pictures below.
