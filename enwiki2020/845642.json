In internal combustion engines, a variable-length intake manifold (VLIM),variable intake manifold (VIM), or variable intake system (VIS) is an automobile internal combustion engine manifold technology. As the name implies, VLIM/VIM/VIS can vary the length of the intake tract - in order to optimise power and torque across the range of engine speed operation, as well as help provide better fuel efficiency. This effect is often achieved by having two separate intake ports, each controlled by a valve, that open two different manifolds - one with a short path that operates at full engine load, and another with a significantly longer path that operates at lower load. The first patent issued for a variable length intake manifold was published in 1958, US Patent US2835235 by Daimler Benz AG.US Patent 2835235 There are two main effects of variable intake geometry: ;Swirl: Variable geometry can create a beneficial air swirl pattern, or turbulence in the combustion chamber. The swirling helps distribute the fuel and form a homogeneous air-fuel mixture - this aids the initiation of the combustion process, helps minimise engine knocking, and helps facilitate complete combustion. At low revolutions per minute (rpm), the speed of the airflow is increased by directing the air through a longer path with limited capacity (i.e., cross-sectional area) - and this assists in improving low engine speed torque. At high rpms, the shorter and larger path opens when the load increases, so that a greater amount of air with least resistance can enter the chamber - this helps maximise 'top-end' power. In double overhead camshaft (DOHC) designs, the air paths may sometimes be connected to separate intake valves so the shorter path can be excluded by de- activating the intake valve itself. ;Pressurisation: A tuned intake path can have a light pressurising effect similar to a low-pressure supercharger - due to Helmholtz resonance. However, this effect occurs only over a narrow engine speed band. A variable intake can create two or more pressurized \"hot spots\", increasing engine output. When the intake air speed is higher, the dynamic pressure pushing the air (and/or mixture) inside the engine is increased. The dynamic pressure is proportional to the square of the inlet air speed, so by making the passage narrower or longer the speed/dynamic pressure is increased. ==Applications== Many automobile manufacturers use similar technology with different names. Another common term for this technology is variable resonance induction system (VRIS). *Acura \u2014 Variable Volume Induction 3.0-litre V6 C30A (1991-2005) and 3.2-litre V6 C32B (2002-2005); 3.2 L V6 J32A3 (2004-2008); 2.0-litre I4 R20A (2013-2015) petrol engines *Audi \u2014 2.8-litre V6 petrol engine (1991\u201398); 3.0-litre V6 (2002-2005); 3.6 and 4.2-litre V8 engines, 1987\u2013present *Alfa Romeo \u2014 Twin Spark 16v (1.8 and 2.0-litre) and JTS engines *BMW \u2014 DISA (DIfferenzierte SaugAnlage - \"Differential Air Intake\"), two Port: M42, three Port: N52; DIVA (variable length runners): M54 etc. BMW's DIVA (Differentiated Variable Air Intake) used on the N62 V8 engine, is the world's first continuously variable length intake manifold. *Citro\u00ebn \u2014 XM 3,0 V6.24 (200 hp) used during 1991 to 1997, ZX Coupe 2.0 16v XU10J4 engine. *Daewoo \u2014 Variable Geometry Induction System (VGIS) Lanos *Dodge / Chrysler \u2014 3.5 L V6 EGE, (1993-1997) used in Dodge Intrepid, Chrysler Concorde and LHS; 2.0 A588 - ECH (2001\u20132005) used in the 2001-2005 model year Dodge Neon R/T; 6.4 L V8 2011-2014 Dodge Charger and Challenger, Chrysler 300, Jeep Grand Cherokee (SRT8 versions) *Ferrari \u2014 360 Modena, 550 Maranello, LaFerrari *Fiat - Controlled High Turbulence (1989\u201392, Fiat Croma CHT), StarJet engine, dubbed Port Deactivation (PDA), Variable Intake System on the 131HP 1.8 16V and on the 155 HP 2.0 20V Pratola Serra engine. *Ford \u2014 Dual-Stage Intake (DSI), on their Duratec 2.5 and 3.0-litre V6s, and it was also found on the Yamaha V6 in the Taurus SHO.

The SVT edition (in North America) and ST170 edition (in Europe) of the Ford Focus added IMRC to the Ford Zetec engine.
