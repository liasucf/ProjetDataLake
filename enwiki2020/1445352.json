    "text": "Jo\u00e3o Domingos da Silva Pinto (born 21 November 1961) is a Portuguese former footballer and manager. Having spent his entire professional career with Porto (16 years, winning a total of 24 major titles, including nine leagues and the 1987 European Cup), he is regarded as one of the greatest Portuguese right backs of all-time. Pinto represented the Portugal national team during more than one decade, appearing with them in one World Cup and one European Championship. ==Playing career== Pinto was born in Oliveira do Douro, Vila Nova de Gaia, Porto District. A FC Porto trainee, it did not take him long to establish himself in the side's starting XI. When Fernando Gomes broke his leg before the 1986\u201387 European Cup final against FC Bayern Munich, he was picked as the captain, and reportedly only released the cup on Portuguese soil after the 2\u20131 win in Vienna. Always an undisputed starter, Pinto retired after the 1996\u201397 season after 16 years as a professional, helping the northerners to their first three-leagues-in-a-row accolade (in total he won nine national championships, four cups, and was part of the treble-winning squad which won the Champions Cup, the European Supercup and the Intercontinental Cup). Given his devotion and long service to the club, he was subsequently given a place coaching its youth teams. Pinto totalled 70 caps with one goal for Portugal, being selected as national captain on 42 occasions. After seeing the nation's 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification hopes squashed after a 0\u20131 away loss against Italy he left the field in tears, further enhancing his nickname, Capit\u00e3o; he played internationally in UEFA Euro 1984 and at the 1986 World Cup \u2013 Bobby Robson, who coached Porto, once remarked of him: \"He has two hearts and four legs. It's extremely difficult to find a player like him.\" ==Coaching career== Pinto began working as a head coach in the Portuguese second division. He started with S.C. Covilh\u00e3, moving in January 2013 to G.D. Chaves and helping the latter club promote to that level in his only season. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Appearances and goals by club, season and competition. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"16\"|Porto |1981\u201382 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |7||0||2||0||0||0||2||0||11||0 |- |1982\u201383 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |23||0||6||1||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||31||1 |- |1983\u201384 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |26||0||9||0||9||0||2||0||46||0 |- |1984\u201385 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |30||0||7||0||2||0||4||0||43||0 |- |1985\u201386 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |18||1||3||0||4||0||2||0||27||1 |- |1986\u201387 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |29||3||5||0||9||0||2||0||45||3 |- |1987\u201388 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |34||1||7||0||4||0||3||0||48||1 |- |1988\u201389 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |35||1||4||0||3||0||2||0||44||1 |- |1989\u201390 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |30||0||3||0||6||0||colspan=2|\u2014||39||0 |- |1990\u201391 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |30||0||5||1||5||0||2||0||42||1 |- |1991\u201392 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |33||8||6||0||4||0||1||0||44||8 |- |1992\u201393 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |25||2||2||0||8||0||3||1||38||3 |- |1993\u201394 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |31||1||6||0||10||0||2||0||49||1 |- |1994\u201395 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |31||0||2||0||4||0||3||0||40||0 |- |1995\u201396 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |13||0||6||0||4||0||0||0||23||0 |- |1996\u201397 |Primeira Divis\u00e3o |13||0||2||0||2||0||0||0||17||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career Total !408!!17!!75!!2!!76!!0!!28!!1!!587!!20 |} ===International=== National team appearances and goals listed by year. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:100%; text-align: center;\" |- ! colspan=\"3\" | Portugal national team |- !
