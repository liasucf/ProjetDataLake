    "text": "Gregory Lamont Vaughn (born July 3, 1965) is an American former baseball left fielder who played for the Milwaukee Brewers (1989\u201396), San Diego Padres (1996\u201398), Cincinnati Reds (1999), Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2000\u201302) and Colorado Rockies (2003) in Major League Baseball (MLB). He was born in Sacramento, California, where he attended Kennedy High School. He then played baseball at the University of Miami. He is the cousin of fellow former major leaguers Mo Vaughn and Jerry Royster. ==Career== ===Amateur=== In 1984 and 1985, Vaughn played collegiate summer baseball for the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). He led the Kettleers to league titles in both seasons, and was league MVP in 1985. Vaughn was inducted into the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2009. ===Professional=== Vaughn was selected by the Brewers in the first round (4th pick) of the 1986 amateur draft. A slugger whose batting average dropped below .250 as often as rising above it, he compensated with excellent power. He had three seasons with at least 100 runs batted in, and four with 30 or more home runs \u2013 including the season, when he hit 50 to finish 4th in the major leagues behind Ken Griffey, Jr., Sammy Sosa, and Mark McGwire, who set the home run record that season. In 1999, he became the first player in major league history to be traded after a 50-homer season when the Padres traded him to the Cincinnati Reds. Vaughn's arrival in Cincinnati caused a bit of a controversy with club ownership and their no facial hair policy. Vaughn styled a goatee that he really didn't want to remove. Fans urged owner Marge Schott to lift the long-standing policyhttp://reds.enquirer.com/1999/02/05/red_tell_us_what.html that had been in place since 1967, which she eventually did. On the field, he hit 45 homers and became the second player in major league history to hit 40 or more homers in consecutive seasons with two different teams (one year after Andr\u00e9s Galarraga became the first). Throughout his career, Vaughn batted .242 with 355 home runs, 1072 RBI, 1017 runs, 1475 hits, 284 doubles, 23 triples and 121 stolen bases in 1731 games. Vaughn became eligible for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. 75% of the vote was necessary for induction, and 5% was necessary to stay on the ballot. He received no votes and dropped off the ballot. ==Personal life== His son, Cory Vaughn, played minor league baseball in the New York Mets organization.https://www.nj.com/mets/2014/02/mets_cory_vaughn_playing_towards_majors_while_managing_diabetes.html ==See also== * 50 home run club * List of Major League Baseball career home run leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs scored leaders * List of Major League Baseball career runs batted in leaders ==References== Notes ==External links== , or Retrosheet, or Pelota Binaria (Venezuelan Winter League) : Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:African-American baseball players Category:American Association (20th century) MVP Award winners Category:American League All-Stars Category:Baseball players from California Category:Beloit Brewers players Category:Cardenales de Lara players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Colorado Rockies players Category:Colorado Springs Sky Sox players Category:Cotuit Kettleers players Category:Denver Zephyrs players Category:El Paso Diablos players Category:Helena Gold Sox players Category:Major League Baseball designated hitters Category:Major League Baseball left fielders Category:Miami Hurricanes baseball players Category:Milwaukee Brewers players Category:National League All-Stars Category:Sacramento City Panthers baseball players Category:San Diego Padres players Category:Silver Slugger Award winners Category:Sportspeople from Sacramento, California Category:Tampa Bay Devil Rays players ",
