His family seat was N\u00e9met\u00fajv\u00e1r in western Hungary (now G\u00fcssing in Austria). The Batthy\u00e1ny family traces its roots as far back as the founding of Hungary by \u00c1rp\u00e1d in the year 896, its ancestor being one of seven princes called Urs. On 14 December 1828 Batthy\u00e1ny married Wilhelmine von Ahrenfeld, widow of Ferdinand, Graf Bubna von Littitz (died 1825), and some twelve years older than Batthy\u00e1ny. This came two years after the birth of their first son, Edmund, and two months after the birth of their second, but it had the effect of legitimating them both. His wife died in 1840.Almanach de Gotha (1877), p. 216 In 1838 Batthy\u00e1ny donated his entire library, including the mysterious Rohonc Codex, to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. While still a young man Batthy\u00e1ny emigrated to England, where he became well known as an owner and breeder of Thoroughbred racehorses. In 1843 he established his own stud. Batthy\u00e1ny was involved in the Magyar national movement as a member of the constitutional Hungarian Ministry of 1848 led by his cousin Lajos Batthy\u00e1ny. In 1851 he signed a letter together with Count K\u00e1zm\u00e9r Batthy\u00e1ny, Bertalan Szemere, and Prince Paul Esterh\u00e1zy to his old friends, the Duke of Wellington and Lord Melbourne, accusing Lajos Kossuth of high treason and terrorism.\"Prince Esterh\u00e1zy and the Hungarian Government of 1848\", The Times (November 13, 1851). This letter exposed the divisions in the Magyar national movement to English supporters.Conference on British-Hungarian Relations since 1848 (PDF) In 1859 Batthy\u00e1ny was elected to the Jockey Club. He hired the trainer John Dawson to condition his horses at Newmarket. In 1875 his horse Galopin won The Derby and went on to be the Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1888, 1889 and 1898. Galopin was the damsire of Bayardo and of the 1886 U.K. Triple Crown Champion, Flying Fox. Philip, 4th Prince Batthyany- Strattmann (1781\u20131870) In 1870 Batthy\u00e1ny's second cousin Philipp, 4th Prince Batthy\u00e1ny-Strattmann, died without children, and Batthy\u00e1ny succeeded as the 5th Prince Batthy\u00e1ny-Strattmann. At about this time he presented a small life- boat called Harbinger to the boatmen of Bridlington.Sarah Stocks, Count Gustave Batthyany: Miscellaneous Items on Count Gustav Batthyany and Harbinger Lifeboat (2003), pp. 3\u201310 Batthyany had a heart condition that enforced the early retirement of his horse Galopin at the end of the 1875 season, as it was feared that the excitement of watching him race again could put the Prince's life at risk.Ahnert, Rainer L. Ahnert (editor in chief), Thoroughbred Breeding of the World, Pozdun Publishing, Germany, 1970 He died on 25 April 1883 after suffering a heart attack while attending a luncheon at the Jockey Club. Probate was granted on 23 May 1883 to Annie Smith, wife of John Graham Smith, one of the Executors, in the amount of \u00a349,612, 8s. His address at death was stated as 3 Park Street, Grosvenor Square.\"Gustavus Prince BATTHYANY STRATTMANN\" in Probate Index for 1883 at probatesearch.service.gov.uk, accessed 11 February 2018 His executors sold off his bloodstock at the Tattersalls July Sale at Newmarket, and a legal action was brought against them by his eldest son. ==Marriage and family== On 14 December 1828 Batthy\u00e1ny married Freiin Wilhelmine von Ahrenfeld. They had two sons: *Edmund Gustavus, 6th Prince Batthy\u00e1ny-Strattmann, born 20 November 1826, died on 29 October 1914 at the family castle of K\u00f6rmend. *Count Gustav Batthy\u00e1ny was born at Vienna on 3 September 1828 and died unmarried on 27 August 1906. ==Gallery== File:Harry Hall Prince Plausible mit G.
