    "text": "Serra is a municipality in the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil. Bordering the north of the state's capital, Vit\u00f3ria, the municipality is part of the Greater Vit\u00f3ria metropolitan area. Its population was 507,598 (2018) and its area is 553 km. Serra, the seat of the municipality, is to the north of the characteristic Mestre \u00c1lvaro mountain which juts out of the coastal lowlands, and which is said to look like a small mountain range or \"serra\", in Portuguese, which is where the town and municipality got its name. ==Politics== Serra has five districts (distritos): Serra-Capital (or Serra- Sede), Carapina, Calogi, Nova Almeida and Queimado. Among those districts there are 118 neighbourhoods (bairros). Another important urban area is that of Jacara\u00edpe, on the coast 20 km north of Vit\u00f3ria. Jacara\u00edpe is very well known for surfing championships, and is a weekend beach used by capital dwellers. Other smaller fishing villages such as Manguinhos are also close enough for day trips and are popular destinations for the locals. The coastline of the municipality is protected in part by the Costa das Algas Environmental Protection Area, created in 2010. ===Neighbourhoods of Serra === *Andr\u00e9 Carloni *Alterosa *Bairro de F\u00e1tima *Balne\u00e1rio de Carapebus *Barcelona *Barro Branco *Bicanga *Boa Vista *Carapina *Cascata *Central Carapina *Ch\u00e1cara Parreiral *Cidade Continental *Cidade Pomar *Colina de Laranjeiras *El Dourado *Eurico Salles *Feu Rosa *H\u00e9lio Ferraz *Jacara\u00edpe *Jardim Carapina *Jardim Limoeiro *Jardim Tropical *Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta *Laranjeiras *Laranjeiras II *Laranjeiras Velha *Mata da Serra *Manoel Plaza *Morada de Laranjeiras *Nova Almeida *Nova Carapina I *Nova Carapina II *Novo Horizonte *Novo Porto Canoa *Parque Resid\u00eancia de Laranjeiras *Parque Resid\u00eancia de Tubar\u00e3o *Porto Canoa *Ros\u00e1rio de F\u00e1tima *Santo Antonio *S\u00e3o Diogo I *S\u00e3o Diogo II *S\u00e3o Geraldo *Serra Dourada I *Serra Dourada II *Serra Dourada III *Taquara *Taquara I *Taquara I *Taquara III *Valpara\u00edso *Vila Nova De Colares ==References== ==External links== *History of Serra (in Portuguese) **Images Maps Google of Serra ES Brazil Category:Populated coastal places in Esp\u00edrito Santo Category:Municipalities in Esp\u00edrito Santo ",
