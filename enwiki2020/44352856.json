Plain bearings are now illegal for interchange service in North America.Car and Locomotive Cyclopedia 1969 As early as 1908 axle boxes contained a set of long cylindrical rollers allowing the axle to rotate. It was also used on steam locomotives such as the Victorian Railways A2 class, the LMS Garratt, the LSWR 415 class, and the GCR Class 1. == Center pin == A large steel pin\u2014or rod\u2014which passes through the center plates on the body bolster and truck bolster. The truck turns about the pin, and stress is taken by the center plates. == Center plate == One of a pair of plates which fit one into the other and support the car body on the trucks allowing them to turn freely under the car. The one on the truck may also be called center bowl. == Truck side frame == The frame at either side of the truck. == Truck bolster == Each truck has a bolster\u2014a transverse floating beam\u2014between the side frames. It is the central part of every truck on which the underframe of the railcar or railroad car is pivoted through the center pivot pin. == Side bearing == There is one side bearing located on each side of the centerplate on the truck bolster. == Image gallery == File:Journal box.png | An American journal box showing a plain bearing File:Bettendorf truck at Illinois Railway Museum.JPG | This Bettendorf-style freight car truck uses journal bearings in journal boxes that are integral parts of the side frames. The center pin can be seen pointing up from the bolster. It has coil springs File:Rollingstock axle.jpg | Railroad car wheels are affixed to a straight axle, such that both wheels rotate in unison. This is called a wheelset.
