He is introduced to golf by his school's principal. Dandoh quits baseball and decides to play golf instead partly after hearing he could win 30 million yen in a tournament. He believes if he wins the money, his mother would come back after she left him, his older sister, and his father because of money problems. His nickname comes from an alternate pronunciation of his given name, the Japanese word dand\u014d (\u5f3e\u9053, lit. \"trajectory\"). ; : :Yuka Sunada is Dandoh's friend who follows him to play golf.

His career came to an end after a car accident, which left him unable to swing a golf club.
