    "text": "Basroch refugee camp was situated in Grande-Synthe, Dunkirk, France. It began as an informal refugee camp in a muddy field in about 2006. As late as summer 2015 it still only contained about 60 residents, but by January 2016 the camp had expanded to more than 2000 people. The very rapid expansion created a humanitarian crisis, as the site was not at all suitable for the large numbers of people who were living there. The rats, refuse and disease led to the camp being referred to as \"Europe's worst refugee camp.\" It was described as \"appalling,\" \"gut wrenching\" and \"deplorable.\" The international NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res stated: Aid organisations working at Basroch camp included Emma\u00fcs, Terre d\u2019Errance, le Secours Catholique et Populaire, Aid Box Convey and Edlumino, which provided education to the children of the camp. ==See also== *Migrants around Calais *Calais Jungle *Sangatte *European migrant crisis *Modern immigration to the United Kingdom *Illegal immigration in the United Kingdom *Channel Tunnel, \u00a7 Asylum and immigration *Refugees of Iraq *Edlumino ==References== Category:Calais migrant crisis (1999\u2013present) Category:Refugee camps Category:Illegal immigration to the United Kingdom Category:Waste in France ",
