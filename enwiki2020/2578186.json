    "text": "Hanjin Shipping Co., Ltd. was a South Korean integrated logistics and container transport company. Prior to its liquidation, Hanjin Shipping was South Korea's largest container line and one of the world's top ten container carriers in terms of capacity. ==Overview== Hanjin shipping formerly operated some 60 liner and tramper services around the globe, transporting over 100 million tons of cargo annually. Its fleet consisted of many container ships, bulk and LNG carriers. Hanjin Shipping had its own subsidiaries dedicated to ocean transportation and terminal operation and it had several branch offices in various countries. On February 17, 2017, Hanjin Shipping Co. was declared bankrupt by South Korean courts. ==Bankruptcy== Hanjin container ===Insolvency=== Hanjin Shipping's insolvency was caused in part by overcapacity in the container ship industry. ===Liquidation=== In April 2016, Hanjin applied to its creditors for debt restructuring, in order to avoid formal insolvency proceedings. On August 31, 2016, Hanjin filed for receivership at the Seoul Central District Court and requested the court to freeze its assets, after losing support from its banks the previous day. After Hanjin's receivership was publicized, creditors confiscated assets and Hanjin vessels experienced access issues in ports globally because service providers were not informed if and how they would be paid to load and unload Hanjin vessels . On September 2, 2016 Hanjin Shipping Co. filed papers in U.S. Bankruptcy court in Newark, New Jersey that would allow its vessels to dock without its ships, cargo or equipment being confiscated by creditors. Shortly after its receivership, experts predicted Hanjin Shipping was likely to be liquidated. In the following months, Hanjin Shipping announced it would shut down offices around the world, lay-off workers, sell remaining assets, and discontinue most services. On February 17, 2017, Hanjin Shipping Co. was declared bankrupt by South Korean courts, with a court order to be liquidated. ===Aftermath and legacy=== Hanjin Shipping was the largest bankruptcy in the container transport industry and it caused worldwide supply chain and shipping disruption as cargo ships were left stuck at ports and canals waiting for cash payments. Hanjin's bankruptcy created a massive ripple effect. Other businesses that rely on physical products found themselves without the expected revenue from inventory that became stuck at sea. The containers of other container ship companies also became stranded on Hanjin vessels. Hanjin collapsed at an especially inconvenient time for retailers furnishing their inventories with imported items in preparation for a seasonal uptick in Thanksgiving, Christmas, Black Friday, and New Year's sales. Although large companies such as Nike were affected, the repercussions were more prominent on smaller companies. In February 2017, SM Line, a new shipping firm formed by Samra Midas (SM) Group, purchased five vessels previously owned by Hanjin. In March, SM Line acquired two of Hanjin Shipping's terminals in Korea, in the cities of Gwangyang and Incheon. In August 2017, a South Korean bankruptcy trustee which was appointed to manage the liquidation of Hanjin Shipping reported that it had only collected 220 million USD from the sale of Hanjin's assets. This sum amounts to only 2% of the US$10.5 billion total debt Hanjin owes to its creditors.http://www.globaltrademag.com/global-logistics/final- bill-hanjin-shipping- bankruptcy-10-billionhttp://www.tradewindsnews.com/finance/1322963/hanjin- shipping-sales-fail-to-plug-usd-105bn- holehttp://business.mb.com.ph/2017/08/09/hanjin-shipping-raises-fraction- of-10-5-b-in-bankruptcy-claims/ ==Services== Hanjin 20 foot containers * Container \u2013 Transported approximately 3.7 million TEU containers a year.
