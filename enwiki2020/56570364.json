    "text": "Love in a Cold Climate is a 1980 British television series produced by Thames Television. It is an adaptation of the Nancy Mitford novels The Pursuit of Love (1945) and Love in a Cold Climate (1949), set between 1924 and 1940, with a screenplay adaptation by Simon Raven.Harris M. Lentz III, \"Raven, Simon\" in Obituaries in the Performing Arts, 2001: Film, Television, Radio, p. 242 It was originally broadcast on the ITV network in eight episodes. The series starred Lucy Gutteridge, Rosalyn Landor, Michael Aldridge, Judi Dench, Vivian Pickles, and Jean-Pierre Cassel. ==Production== The filming of the serial has been described as \"most uncharacteristically relaxed\" for the actors, as it had been scheduled during what proved to be a long-running dispute between ITV and the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians union. At first, there was a work-to-rule, and the actors were not called until 11 am, with filming ending at about 4 pm. The dispute then escalated into a full strike, and filming was abandoned, with the actors being paid a retainer until it could be resumed.John Miller, Judi Dench: With a Crack in Her Voice (2013), p. 160 ==Cast== *Judi Dench as Aunt Sadie (Lady Alconleigh) *Michael Aldridge as Uncle Matt (Matthew Radlett, Lord Alconleigh) *Michael Williams as Davey Warbeck *Lucy Gutteridge as Linda *John Moffatt as Lord Merlin *Isabelle Amyes as Fanny *Vivian Pickles as Lady Montdore *Job Stewart as Boy Dougdale *Rosalyn Landor as Lady Polly Hampton *Rebecca Saire as Victoria *Christopher Scoular as Alfred *Richard Hurndall as Lord Montdore *Michael Cochrane as Cedric Hampton *Yolande Palfrey as Jassy *Selena Carey-Jones as Louisa *Max Harris as Little Matt *Jean-Pierre Cassel as Fabrice, duc de Sauveterre *Patience Collier as duchesse de Sauveterre *Anthony Head as Tony Kroesig *Peter Howell as Duke of Paddington *Joshua Le Touzel as Bob *David Parfitt as Little Matt *Leon Eagles as Sir Leicester Kroesig *Daphne Neville as Lady Kroesig *Diana Fairfax as Emily Warbeck *Adrienne Corri as Veronica Chaddesley-Corbett *Noel Johnson as Lord Stromboli *Ralph Lawson as Christian Talbot *Ann Queensberry as Lady Patricia *Richard Beale as Josh *Michael Lees as Lord Fort-William *Amanda Boxer as Young Baroness *Anthony Higgins as Juan *Suzanne Burden as Lavender Davis *Michael Elwyn as Roly *Tamzin Neville as Linda *Katherine Kath as Old Countess *Simon Lack as Doctor *Emma Higginson as Victoria *Geoffrey Lumsden as Sir Archibald Curtly *Pamela Pitchford as Mrs Hunt *Michael Jayes as Robert Parker *Gillian Maude as Germaine *G\u00e9rard Falconetti as Barman ==Notes== ==External links== * *The Nancy Mitford web site Category:1980 British television series debuts Category:1980 British television series endings Category:1980s British drama television series Category:1980s British television miniseries Category:Television shows based on British novels Category:ITV television dramas Category:Period television series Category:Television series by Fremantle (company) Category:Television shows produced by Thames Television Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows set in England ",
