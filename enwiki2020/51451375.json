The selection took place amid the backdrop of the 2016 Labour Leadership election, with Simon being a close friend and ally of Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, who had been calling for incumbent Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn to step down. Steve Bedser pitched to Corbyn supporters, expressing his support for Corbyn, whilst simultaneously stating that Corbyn needed to improve his performance.http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/corbyn- supporters-targeted-birmingham-labour-11609344 On 10 August 2016, Simon was announced as the winning candidate. ==Candidates== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
