    "text": "XEDW-AM was a radio station in Minatitl\u00e1n, Veracruz, Mexico. The station broadcast from 1936 to September 5, 1969\u201413 years beyond the expiration of its concession\u2014when it was closed by a federal government inspector. ==History== XEDW was awarded its concession on July 1, 1936. The 20-year concession was made to H\u00e9ctor Silva Canto. The station broadcast on 1150 kHz until moving to 1260 with the adoption of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement on March 29, 1941, where it operated with 250 watts. The concession expired on June 30, 1956, without being renewed. On September 5, 1969, XEDW was visited by V\u00edctor Hern\u00e1ndez Castillo, a federal inspector from the Directorate General of Telecommunications, and ordered closed. The person who presented himself as the operator of the station, Daniel Schacht P\u00e9rez, replied one day late to a letter asking him to show cause why the station should not be permanently closed. (Schacht owned XEKM-AM radio in the same city.) As a result, in a resolution dated February 16, 1972 but not published in the Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n until March 17, 1975, the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation decreed the closure of the station and ordered it to pay a fine of 5,000 pesos. The 1260 frequency in Minatitl\u00e1n was opened to new commercial bidders on October 18, 1976, as XEMTV-AM. Oscar Bravo Santos was the only applicant to file for the frequency on time, and his XEMTV-AM signed on October 14, 1983. ==References== Category:1936 establishments in Mexico Category:1969 disestablishments in Mexico Category:Defunct radio stations in Mexico Category:Radio_stations_established_in_1936 Category:Radio_stations_disestablished_in_1969 ",
