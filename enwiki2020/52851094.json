    "text": "Tom Oliverson is an American anesthesiologist who is a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives for District 130. He succeeded fellow Republican Allen Fletcher, who did not seek a fifth term in the position. ==Biography== A 2000 graduate of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Oliverson is affiliated with U.S. Anesthesia Partners, which operates more than one thousand anesthesiology groups in Texas. He consults with physicians and dentists in regards to patient office surgery. In 2015, Oliverson and his wife, Jennifer, were named to the inaugural committee of Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, the presiding officer of the Texas State Senate. The Oliversons home school their three children and reside in suburban Cypress, Texas. They are active members of Jersey Village Baptist Church, which was founded in Houston in 1956. ==Political career== Oliverson retained prominent Republican political strategist Allen Blakemore, and handily the Republican House nomination over Kay Smith, 16,988 votes (70 percent) to 7,265 (30 percent). No Democrat sought the position in the November 8 general election, held in conjunction with the 2016 presidential election. Oliverson contends that property taxes in Harris County are \"too high, and we need meaningful tax relief now.\" He supports automatic reductions in property tax rates when revenues increase above expected levels. He supports the \"fair tax\" system as a means to abolish property taxes. Despite the overall Democratic sweep of Harris County, Dr. Oliverson handily won his second term in the state House in the general election held on November 6, 2018. He defeated the Democrat Fred Infortunio, 52,063 votes (68.5 percent) to 22,562 (29.7 percent). The remaining 864 votes (1.5 percent) went to the Libertarian Roy Eriksen. Oliverson earned recognition in June 2019 from Texas Monthly magazine as one of Texas' top lawmakers for his work on passing health care legislation and working with Republicans and Democrats during Texas' 86th Legislative session. ==References== ==External links== * State legislative page * Tom Oliverson at the Texas Tribune Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:People from Houston Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Texas Republicans Category:Physicians from Texas Category:Baylor College of Medicine alumni Category:Baptists from Texas ",
