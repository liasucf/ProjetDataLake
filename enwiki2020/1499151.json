Just to the northwest of K\u00e4stner is the walled plain Gilbert. To the south is the prominent crater Ansgarius, and to the southwest lies La P\u00e9rouse. This formation belongs to the category termed a walled plain. It has a worn, irregular outer wall that is overlaid by several small craters and there is a small break along the north-northeast. Along the northeastern rim is K\u00e4stner B, and to the southwest is the small K\u00e4stner E. A shallow, unnamed crater is attached to the southern rim. The interior floor is relatively level and featureless, with only a few small craterlets and minor ridges. ==Satellite craters== By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to K\u00e4stner. {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |K\u00e4stner !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Latitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Longitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Diameter |- |align=\"center\"|A |align=\"center\"|4.5\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|77.3\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|25 km |- |align=\"center\"|B |align=\"center\"|6.3\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|80.7\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|20 km |- |align=\"center\"|C |align=\"center\"|8.0\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|76.9\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|19 km |- |align=\"center\"|E |align=\"center\"|8.1\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|77.6\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|10 km |- |align=\"center\"|G |align=\"center\"|4.2\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|79.0\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|72 km |- |align=\"center\"|R |align=\"center\"|6.9\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|82.3\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|17 km |- |align=\"center\"|S |align=\"center\"|8.0\u00b0 S |align=\"center\"|83.2\u00b0 E |align=\"center\"|30 km |} The following craters have been renamed by the IAU. * K\u00e4stner F -- See Black.
