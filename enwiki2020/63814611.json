Prasanna ==Reception== Times of India wrote \" Despite its honourable intention of glorifying kabadi, Dhoni Kabadi Kuzhu is an amateurish exercise that struggles to keep us hooked, mainly due to the bland performances are bland, and the flat filmmaking\". Indian Express wrote \"For a film which talks at length about the pride of Tamil and kabaddi, Dhoni Kabadi Kuzhu ends up being a discredit to both due to its incredibly careless writing and making.\" News Today wrote \"It is honourable that the makers have tried to give their best and build up a good image for our native sport, kabaddi. But, it is sad that though their attempts are praiseworthy, they have botched up a bit in the execution. The film is dragging in the first half and the humour, if any, fails to make us laugh on most occasion. Things get better in the second half though as the movie gets in on the kabaddi action. But what is funny is that the serious and tense moments that the director hopes to make us sit on the edge of the seat, do the exact opposite and make us laugh\". == References == == External links == * Category:2018 films Category:Tamil- language films Category:Indian films Category:2010s Tamil-language films Category:2010s sports drama films Category:Indian sports drama films Category:2018 directorial debut films Category:2018 drama films ",
