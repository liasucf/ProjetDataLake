    "text": "Hot is the debut album by English singer and songwriter Melanie Brown, released on 9 October 2000 by Virgin. The album was not as successful as her albums with the Spice Girls or that of other members solo albums released around this time. It peaked at number twenty-eight in the United Kingdom and sold over 60,000 copies, receiving a silver certification. The album had four singles: \"I Want You Back\", featuring Missy Elliott, \"Tell Me\", \"Feels So Good\" and \"Lullaby\". The first three singles reached the top 5 in the United Kingdom. The single \"Word Up\", previously released on the soundtrack of the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, was included on the Japanese version. The album received mixed to negative reviews from critics. ==Background== The album was released on 9 October 2000, less than a month before the release of Forever, the third studio album by the Spice Girls; this is cited as the main reason that Hot was not successful: fans were more interested in the Spice Girls comeback album rather than Melanie B's debut album. Despite being released only two weeks after the top 5 hit \"Tell Me\" and including single \"I Want You Back\", Hot entered the UK Albums Chart at No. 28 before quickly dropping from the chart completely. Hot was digitally released in the United States via the iTunes Store on 30 October 2007. Four months after the album's release, the single \"Feels So Good\" was released, becoming a top 5 hit. This single helped the album re-enter the UK Albums Chart. The last single, \"Lullaby\" was released in June 2001, but was unable to make a great impact on album sales, therefore Hot re-entered the Top 200 for only one week. Altogether the album went on to sell over 53,000 copies. The track \"Hotter\" was set to be the album's fifth single, however, this was decided against because of the low charting of \"Lullaby\". ==Track listing== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Hot. ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
