In February 1645, Gyldenl\u00f8ve was given the estate Skinnerup g\u00e5rd by his father. He was not impressed with its name nor its derelict condition. He rebuilt the manor and renamed it Ulriksholm. He was subsequently made a count. Gyldenl\u00f8ve was general of the Realm () and commander-in-chief of the Danish army during the Dano-Swedish War of 1657\u20131658. Ulrik led the charge of a student army against the Swedish army during the siege of Copenhagen in 1658. When the Swedes stormed Kallebodstrand in Copenhagen, where Gyldenl\u00f8ve had his headquarters, a bloody struggle was fought between the Danish-Dutch defenders and the Swedish-German attackers. Gyldenl\u00f8ve was slain by several enemy gunshots. The Gyldenl\u00f8vesgade streets in Copenhagen and Odense are named after him. Gyldenl\u00f8ve was remembered by the Danish nobility and peasantry as one of Denmark's foremost military commanders. Christian V also had a son with the same name. ==Legacy== Gyldenl\u00f8vesgade in Copenhagen and Gyldenl\u00f8vesgade in Odense are named after him.
