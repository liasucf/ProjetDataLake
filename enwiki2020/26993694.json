    "text": "The Alipashiad or Alipashias () is a Greek epic poem, written in the early 19th century by the Muslim Albanian Haxhi Shehreti. The work is inspired by and named after Ali Pasha, the Ottoman lord of Ioannina, Epirus, describing, in heroic style, his life and military campaigns. ==Background and historical value== Although Ali Pasha was Albanian, he used Greek in his courtly dealings, since this was the dominant language in the regions he controlled. Moreover, the use of Greek language in various works of Albanian authors was very common. In accordance to this, the composer of the Alipashiad, who was Ali's personal balladeer, Haxhi Shehreti, composed this work in Greek language, considering it a more prestigious language in which to praise his master. William Leake says that Shehreti had no Greek education and knew only the colloquial Greek of Albania and its borders. The language of the poem, therefore (according to Leake) represents the local vulgar dialect of the Greek language.William M. Leake (1835) Travels in Northern Greece, vol. 1, p. 463. Historically, the Alipashiad contains the unusual feature of being written from the Muslim point of view. Apart from describing Ali's adventures the poem describes Ioannina, which was a center of Greek culture and renaissance that time, as well as the activities of the local mercenaries (Armatoles) and revolutionaries (Klephts) that Ali had to deal with. ==Text and date== The Alipashiad consists of 15,000 lines and was written in installments in the first years of the 19th century, when Ali Pasha was at his height as the powerful and semi-independent ruler of much of Ottoman Greece. The poem is written in a modern demotic Greek language and contains some dialectical interference and foreign expressions. A copy of the poem was found by the British antiquarian and topographer, William Martin Leake, in 1817. In 1835 he published 4,500 lines of the Alipashiad. The entire poem was published by the Greek historian Constantine Sathas in his volume Historical Disquisitions in 1870 (The Alipashiad, of the Turkalbanian Hadji Sehreti). ==References== ==External links== *Leake William Martin.
