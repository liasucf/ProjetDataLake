    "text": "Released in 2001 on Deep Shag Records, Lunch with the Devil includes the songs \"Poodlecide\", a tribute to 1980s metal icon Ronnie James Dio (\"Dio Rocks!\"), and a twisted ballad of unbidden lust (\"The Thighs of Tammy Faye\"). Of interest to listeners of the Dr. Demento Radio Show is the first official release of a song that's been played for years called \"Woke Up Dis Mornin'\". The album runs the gamut from cowpunk to freakout folk always with a comedic edge mixed with social or political commentary. ==Track listing== #\"Poodlecide\" #\"Down to the Valley\" #\"Thighs of Tammy Faye\" #\"Should I Shop or Should I Die\" #\"God Is a Groovy Guy\" #\"Mogollon Love\" #\"Grenada\" #\"Dio Rocks!\" #\"Die Like a Dog\" #\"Mr. Johnson\" #\"Cow of My Dreams\" #\"An Artist's Lament\" #\"Chicken Lips\" #\"Woke Up Dis Mornin'\" #\"Have a Nice Day\" #\"White Things\" ==External links== *Deep Shag Records listing for the album Category:2001 albums Category:Fish Karma albums Category:Deep Shag Records albums Category:2000s comedy albums ",
