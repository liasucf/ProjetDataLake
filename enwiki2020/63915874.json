He was succeeded upon his death in 1758 by his son Yang Weixing (\u694a\u7dad\u8208/\u6768\u7ef4\u5174), later referred to as Chief of Kho Kan Shan (\u79d1\u5e72\u5c71, K\u0113g\u00e0n Sh\u0101n). He expanded his territory tenfold compared to that inherited from his predecessor. After his death in 1795, his son Yang You Gen (\u694a\u6709\u6839/\u6768\u6709\u6839, Y\u00e1ng Y\u01d2ug\u0113n) became the chief. He soon renamed the state as Kokang and titled himself Heng of Kokang. In 1840, Yang Guohua (\u694a\u570b\u83ef) was given the title \"the Hereditable Magistrate of Guogan (Kokang) County (\u4e16\u8972\u679c\u6562\u7e23\u4ee4)\" by the Chinese Qing dynasty. The Heng was succeeded after his death in 1874 by his younger brother Yang Guozheng (\u694a\u570b\u6b63/\u6768\u56fd\u6b63), who ruled peacefully and began relations with Britain upon the annexation of Upper Burma. In 1916 he went blind, and abdicated in favor of his nephew Yang Chunrong (\u694a\u6625\u69ae/\u6768\u6625\u8363, Y\u00e1ng Ch\u016bnr\u00f3ng). The new ruler then took the Burmese title \"Myosa\" (lit. town eat, given to a prince). He died in 1927 and was succeeded by his son Colonel Sao Yang Wen Ping (\u694a\u6587\u70b3/\u6768\u6587\u70b3, Y\u00e1ng W\u00e9nb\u01d0ng), Saopha of Kokang.http://history.people.com.cn/n/2015/0127/c372326-26458099.html, retrieved 19 July 2020https://www.360kuai.com/pc/9ac8ded1d1d064187?cota=3&kuai;_so=1&sign;=360_7bc3b157, 21 July 2020 ==Rulers== * 1739\u20131758: Yang Shien Tsai (Cai) (b. 1685 \u2013 d. 1758) * 1758\u20131795: Yang Wei Shin (Xing) (d. 1795) ===Title Heng=== After China relinquished jurisdiction on 4 February 1897, Kokang came under British protection.https://www.worldstatesmen.org/Myanmar_shankaren.html, retrieved 25 Sept 2020 * 1795\u20131840: Yang Yon Gen (b. 1770 \u2013 d. 1840) * 1840\u20131874: Yang Guo Hwa (b. 1814 \u2013 d. 1874) * 1874\u20131916: Yang Guo Zhen (Hkun Lu Kwan) (b. 1840 \u2013 d. 1919 ===Title Myosa=== * 1916\u201317 Jan 1927: Yang Chun Yon (Yang Shwin Yong Tzu Ye) (b. 1878 \u2013 d. 1927) * 17 Jan 1927\u20131943: Sao Yang Wen Pi (1st term) (b. 1897 \u2013 d. 1949) (deposed by the Kuomintang in 1943; in exile from 1944 until Oct 1945) * Oct 1945\u201325 Aug 1947: Sao Yang Wen Pi (2nd term) ===Title Saopha=== During World War II, Kokang was recognized as separate from Shan State in August 1947 by the British, and the ruler took the title Saopha.
