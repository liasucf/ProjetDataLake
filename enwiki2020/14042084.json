    "text": "In enzymology, protochlorophyllide reductases ( and ) are enzymes that catalyze the chemical reaction The reduction of ring D of protochlorophyllide completes the biosynthesis of chlorophyllide a :protochlorophyllide + NADPH + H+ \\rightleftharpoons chlorophyllide a + NADP+ The three substrates of this enzyme are protochlorophyllide, NADPH, and H+; its two products are chlorophyllide a and NADP+ . This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is chlorophyllide-a :NADP+ 7,8-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include NADPH2-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase, NADPH-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase, NADPH-protochlorophyllide reductase, protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase, and protochlorophyllide photooxidoreductase. This enzyme is part of the biosynthetic pathway to chlorophylls. There are two structurally unrelated proteins with this activity, referred to as light-dependent and the dark-operative. The light-dependent reductase needs light to function, while the dark-operative version is a completely different protein, consisting of three subunits that exhibit significant sequence similarity to the three subunits of nitrogenase.Yuichi FujitaDagger and Carl E. Bauer (2000). Reconstitution of Light-independent Protochlorophyllide Reductase from Purified Bchl and BchN-BchB Subunits. J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 275, Issue 31, 23583-23588. This enzyme might be evolutionary older but (being similar to nitrogenase) is highly sensitive to free oxygen and does not work if its concentration exceeds about 3%.S.Yamazaki, J.Nomata, Y.Fujita (2006) Differential operation of dual protochlorophyllide reductases for chlorophyll biosynthesis in response to environmental oxygen levels in the cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya boryana. Plant Physiology, 2006, 142, 911-922 Hence the alternative, light dependent version evolved as the concentration of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere grew. ==See also== * Biosynthesis of chlorophylls ==References== Category:EC 1.3.1 Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
