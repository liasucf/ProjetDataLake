All songs are by Boynton and Michael Ford, lyrics by Boynton, and recorded by Adam Bryant, with Michael Ford as instrumentals and backup vocals. The album can be found on Apple Music and Spotify. Boynton wrote the album because she was unhappy with the available recorded children's music. She later wrote that she sought to \"create an album that would somewhat parallel that ran beneath my own childhood\". She had hopes that her songs would withstand repeated listening by adults.
