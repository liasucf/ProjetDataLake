    "text": "Jakob Mathias Antonson Lothe (14 November 1881 \u2013 17 June 1975) was a Norwegian politician for the Liberal Party. He was born in Lote in Gloppen as a son of farmers Anton Jakobsen Lothe (1852\u20131932) and Anne Marie A. R\u00f8s\u00e6t (1853\u20131940). He was a member of Gloppen municipal council between 1919 and 1928, except for a short period between 1923 and 1925. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament from Sogn og Fjordane in 1925, and was re-elected on five occasions, with a spell as deputy representative during the term 1928-1930. However, he served most of that term as well, after regular representative Per Klingenberg Hestetun died. Lothe was President of the Lagting, the former quasi-upper house of the parliament of Norway, from 1945-1954. ==References== Category:1881 births Category:1975 deaths Category:People from Gloppen Category:Sogn og Fjordane politicians Category:Liberal Party (Norway) politicians Category:Members of the Storting Category:20th-century Norwegian politicians ",
