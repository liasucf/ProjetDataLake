Regular cast members included Don Johnson, Philip Michael Thomas, Saundra Santiago, Gregory Sierra, Michael Talbott, John Diehl, Olivia Brown, and Edward James Olmos. The first season was filmed on location in Miami, Florida. The show's crew took up semi-permanent residence in the Alexander Hotel. They later worked out of Greenwich Studios. The film crew on the show was 95% local to the Miami area. Various filming locations on the show included: Downtown Miami, Old Miamarina (Bayside Market Place), Opa Locka Airport, Biscayne Boulevard, Key Biscayne, Florida, Venetian Causeway, Coconut Grove, South Beach, North Miami Beach, St. Croix, McArthur Causeway, Ocean Drive, and Tamiami Trail. Episodes were produced at an average cost of $1.3 million, much higher than the typical cop-show episode of $1 million. The show went to unusual lengths to get the right settings and props for each episode. Music was an integral part of the show. Unlike other television shows at the time, Miami Vice would buy the rights to original versions rather than covers. The show would spend up to $10,000 per episode for original recordings by artists like Todd Rundgren, U2, and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Jan Hammer, the show's musical composer, would create the rest of the show's musical score. Hammer used the Fairlight CMI IIx, a computer based music workstation consisting of an 8-bit sampler, digital synthesizer, MIDI controller and sequencer. The Fairlight enabled Hammer to score and perform the entire show's music single-handedly. Jan would work out of his state-of-the-art studio in his home in Brewster, New York composing the score for each episode. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\" |- ! style=\"background- color: #71A6D2\" | No. overall ! style=\"background-color: #71A6D2\" | No. in season ! style=\"background-color: #71A6D2\" | Title ! style=\"background-color: #71A6D2\" | Directed by ! style=\"background-color: #71A6D2\" | Written by ! style=\"background-color: #71A6D2\" | Original air date ! style=\"background- color: #71A6D2\" | Production code |} ===Season 2 (1985\u201386) === Season two of Miami Vice premiered on September 27, 1985, with the two-hour episode \"The Prodigal Son\".

Additionally, USA Network aired \"Too Much, Too Late\" on January 25, 1990, since NBC would not show that episode due to its strong topic of child molestation (NBC and USA are now owned by the same company).

The first three episodes aired on NBC in June 1989, while the fourth one aired on USA Network in January 1990. *\u20202 The episode \"Leap of Faith\" was a backdoor pilot for a potential series that did not come to fruition. *\u2021 The episode \"Too Much, Too Late\" was not shown on NBC due to its graphic content and a plot vividly involving child molestation, which at the time was considered unsuitable even for nighttime television. ==References== ==External links== *List of Miami Vice episodes at TV.com *List of Miami Vice episodes at Internet Movie Database Category:Lists of American crime drama television series episodes * ",
