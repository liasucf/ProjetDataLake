    "text": "Bottle of George Washington's Rye Whiskey George Washington\u2019s Rye Whiskey is distilled at George Washington\u2019s reconstructed distillery at Mount Vernon from a recipe discovered by scholars examining the distillery ledgers for 1798 and 1799. It is distilled in limited quantities and only available for purchase in person. In 1797, urged on by his farm manager, James Anderson, Washington ramped up production and it produced 600 gallons. In 1799, the year Washington died, the distillery produced nearly 11,000 gallons, making it the largest whiskey distillery in America at that time. After close to a decade of archaeological excavation and reconstruction planning by historians and historical trade interpreters, the building began operation in 2007 using five copper pot stills on the footprints of the original ones. The first batch of whiskey was released in 2010. On March 22, 2017, Governor Terry McAuliffe signed a bill sponsored by Virginia Senator Adam Ebbin (D-30th) designating George Washington\u2019s Rye Whiskey as the official state spirit of the Commonwealth of Virginia.. ==Ingredients== 60 percent rye, 35 percent corn and 5 percent malted barley. ==Process== The staff uses Washington\u2019s original mash bill and 18th-century methods. The grain is processed in Washington\u2019s water- powered gristmill, fermented in wooden mash tubs and distilled in copper pot stills heated by wood fires. In Washington\u2019s time whiskey was not aged but this recipe calls for it to be distilled twice. ==References== Category:Distilleries in Virginia Category:Rye whiskey Category:Food and drink in Virginia Category:George Washington Category:Symbols of Virginia Category:Whiskies of the United States ",
