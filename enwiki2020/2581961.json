    "text": "Lidcombe is a suburb in western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Lidcombe is located west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government areas of Cumberland Council and City of Parramatta. Lidcombe is located west of Rookwood Cemetery, the largest cemetery in the Southern Hemisphere. == History == Samuel Haslam owned various grants beside Haslams Creek from 1804. A railway station called Haslam's Creek was opened in this area in 1859, on the railway line from Sydney to Parramatta. Haslam's Creek is sometimes referred to as Haslem's Creek.The Department of Railways Research and Information Section (1966) Railway Quiz (Department of Railways) p11 Although it had not been intended to construct a station at Haslam's Creek, the then owner of the land where the station now stands, Father John Joseph Therry, together with nearby landholders Potts and Blaxland, agreed to pay \u00a3700 to enable its construction.Mitchell, pp.308\u2013310 Haslam's Creek was the site of the first railway disaster in New South Wales in July 1858 which resulted in two deaths.Pollon, p. 153 When the necropolis opened in 1867 it was known as Haslam's Creek Cemetery. Residents disliked the association with the burial ground and in 1876 the suburb was renamed Rookwood from a title of a novel by William Harrison Ainsworth (1805\u20131882). The name of the railway station was changed to Rookwood in 1878 and by the 1880s shops were established in the area. In 1891, the municipality of Rookwood was incorporated. Over time, the necropolis had become known as Rookwood Cemetery and by 1898 residents were again agitated about the association of their suburb with the cemetery. In 1913, a new name was suggested to honour the previous mayor Henry John Larcombe and the serving mayor Frederick Lidbury. Syllables from the name of each alderman (Lidbury and Larcombe) were combined to form the name Lidcombe on 1 January 1914.Reed, A. W. (1969) Place Names of New South Wales.

Sydney-Melbourne-Wellington- Auckland, p. 87 The municipality amalgamated with Auburn local government area in 1949.Pollon A large number of post-WWII European migrants, including a large number of Ukrainians, settled in the area of Lidcombe, and built a number of buildings including a church, 2 halls and 2 schools. Lidcombe is still the cultural centre of the Ukrainian community in Sydney. The population dynamics changed with the influx of Middle Eastern immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s. The two main streets are John and Joseph, named after the early colonial priest John Joseph Therry. == Heritage listings == Lidcombe has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * East Street: Rookwood Cemetery and Necropolis * Joseph Street: Lidcombe Hospital Precinct == Transport == === Trains === Lidcombe Railway Station Olympic Park platform Lidcombe railway station is an important junction station.
