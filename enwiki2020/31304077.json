According to Turkish authorities, a total of 147 people were killed, including 40 members of security forces, 85 rebels and 22 civilians. According to the Turkish government, the clashes started when a large force of PKK guerrillas attacked government buildings in \u015e\u0131rnak on the night of 18 August, and that security forces responded by bombing, heavy shelling and firing on rebel positions in local houses and shops. The PKK however denied they had launched the attacks that sparked the battle, which continued for over 48 hours. Following the battle a curfew was imposed in the town. Similar operations were later launched in the towns of Kulp in Diyarbak\u0131r Province on 3 October 1992, and Varto in Mu\u015f Province on 17 September 1996. ==Controversy== Amnesty International identified 15 of the civilians killed as Hezni Erkol, G\u00fcler S\u00f6kmen (13), Zehra Koval, Veysi S\u00f6kmen (6), Halime K\u00fcrtel, Sema S\u00f6kmen (9), S\u00fcleyman K\u00fcrtel, Kumru G\u00fcngen, Abdulaziz Besin, G\u00fcl\u00fcm G\u00fcngen (6), Haci Kili\u00e7, Menive G\u00fcngen (14), Yusuf Vatan, Ibrahim Artu\u00e7 and Yusuf Yaman. They claimed that reporters \"were prevented from speaking to local political officials by the police, and there was no way to get an objective account of what had happened\" and that \"those who managed to approach reporters in secrecy could only say they were under fire for two days and claim that tanks and cannons were used to hit buildings occupied by civilians.\" They also claimed there were further attacks on civilians in villages surrounding \u015e\u0131rnak. On 26 August, Amnesty International sent requests to Turkish Prime Minister, S\u00fcleyman Demirel, Interior Minister Ismet Sezgin, Emergency Legislation Governor \u00dcnal Erkan and \u015e\u0131rnak province governor Mustafa Mala, to immediately initiate an independent and impartial inquiry into the events, to ensure no-one was mistreated in police custody and to make their findings public. ==See also== * October 2007 clashes in \u015e\u0131rnak * Siege of Varto * 2015-16 \u015e\u0131rnak clashes ==References== ==Sources== * Serta\u00e7 Do\u011fan, \u015e\u0131rnak Yan\u0131yor 1992, Do Yay\u0131nlar\u0131, 2008, Category:History of the Kurdistan Workers' Party Category:Conflicts in 1992 Sirnak Category:1992 in Turkey Category:\u015e\u0131rnak Province Category:History of \u015e\u0131rnak Category:August 1992 events in Asia ",
