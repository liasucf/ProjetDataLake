    "text": "Aerial Pandemonium Ballet is a 1971 album by Harry Nilsson, and one of the first-ever remix albums, years before they became commonplace in the late 1970s and 1980s onwards. ==Background== With the successes of \"Everybody's Talkin'\" and The Point! creating demand for Nilsson recordings, a reissue of his first two RCA Victor albums (Pandemonium Shadow Show and Aerial Ballet), then out of print, was considered. Nilsson thought that his early albums already sounded a bit dated by 1971. So he went back into the studio with the master tapes, remixed, tweaked, and re-recorded vocals, and came up with a new consolidation that he titled Aerial Pandemonium Ballet. Aerial Pandemonium Ballet includes four songs from Pandemonium Shadow Show (\"1941\", \"Without Her\", \"River Deep - Mountain High\", and \"Sleep Late, My Lady Friend\") and eight songs from Aerial Ballet (\"Daddy's Song\", \"Good Old Desk\", \"Don't Leave Me\", \"Mr. Richland's Favorite Song\", \"Together\", \"Everybody's Talkin'\", \"One\", and \"Bath\"). The songs from Pandemonium Shadow Show not included in Aerial Pandemonium Ballet are \"Ten Little Indians\", \"Cuddly Toy\", \"She Sang Hymns Out of Tune\", \"You Can't Do That\", \"She's Leaving Home\", \"There Will Never Be\", \"Freckles\", and \"It's Been So Long\". The songs from Aerial Ballet not included in Aerial Pandemonium Ballet are \"Little Cowboy\", \"I Said Goodbye to Me\", \"Little Cowboy (Reprise)\", \"Mr. Tinker\", and \"The Wailing of the Willow\". ==Reception== Reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, on allmusic.com, describes the result as \"just old tunes presented in slightly new, slightly off-putting ways.\" ==Track listing== All music and lyrics by Harry Nilsson except where noted #Introduction \u2013 :09 #\"1941\" \u2013 2:37 (slowed down track & remixed) #\"Daddy's Song\" \u2013 2:07 (new vocals, guitar/piano/out of sync) #\"Mr. Richland's Favorite Song\" \u2013 2:07 (new bg vocals & remixed) #\"Good Old Desk\" \u2013 2:30 (slowed down track & remixed) #\"Everybody's Talkin'\" (Fred Neil) \u2013 2:42 (dumped second voice & remixed) #\"Bath\" \u2013 1:50 (re-EQ'd original tracks) #\"River Deep \u2013 Mountain High\" (Phil Spector, Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich) \u2013 3:57 (new vocals & remixed) #\"Sleep Late, My Lady Friend\" \u2013 2:37 (remixed) #\"Don't Leave Me\" \u2013 2:12 (remixed) #\"Without Her\" \u2013 2:08 (new vocals & remixed) #\"Together\" \u2013 1:37 (new vocals, edited out bridge & remixed) #\"One\" \u2013 2:18 (remixed and significantly edited - the original was 2:50) #Closing \u2013 :20 ==References== Category:Harry Nilsson albums Category:1971 remix albums Category:RCA Victor remix albums Category:Albums produced by Rick Jarrard Category:Albums produced by Harry Nilsson ",
