They defeated Florida and LSU to advance to the championship game of the SEC Tournament where they lost to Kentucky. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament where they defeated Green Bay and Northern Iowa to advance to the Sweet Sixteen where they lost to Oklahoma. ==Previous season== The team had a 21\u201312 (11\u20137 in Conference Play) record and entered the SEC Tournament as the 5th seed after losing two games to end conference play, where it lost to Auburn.
