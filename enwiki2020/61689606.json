    "text": "\"All the Good Girls Go to Hell\" (stylized in all lowercase) is the sixth single recorded by American singer Billie Eilish for her debut studio album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? (2019). It was released by Darkroom and Interscope Records on September 6, 2019. Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell co-wrote it, with the latter producing it. \"All the Good Girls Go to Hell\" reached number 46 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It also entered the top-20 on charts in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The music video for the song was uploaded onto Eilish's YouTube channel on September 4, 2019. Eilish promoted the song by performing it live at venues including Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Glastonbury Festival and during her 2019 When We All Fall Asleep Tour. ==Composition== \"All the Good Girls Go to Hell\" was described as a punchy piano number and one of its parent album's poppiest tracks in a press review. According to Finneas O'Connell, one of the two songwriters of the song, the song's lyrics are about climate change, God and the Devil, and \"the idea that humans have made such a mess of the planet at this point that they\u2019re both talking to each other like, 'What\u2019s going on? Why did they do all of this?'\". ==Commercial performance== Following the release of its parent album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, \"All the Good Girls Go to Hell\" debuted at number 46 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart of April 13, 2019. In Canada, the song peaked at number 19 on the Canadian Hot 100. In Europe, it charted at number 179 in France, 63 in Germany, 70 in Italy, 42 in Netherlands, 22 in Norway and 25 in Sweden. \"All the Good Girls Go to Hell\" was more commercially successful in Oceania, peaking at number eight in Australia and nine in New Zealand. ==Music video== A teaser for the \"All the Good Girls Go to Hell\" music video was revealed at Times Square on September 3, 2019. It was released through Eilish's YouTube channel the following day. Picking up where \"Bury a Friend\" left off, the syringes injected into Eilish's back gave her a \"giant\" pair of wings, depicting the singer as a fallen angel. She then drops from the sky and gets stuck in oily muck before being set ablaze, burning the feathers from her wings while walking in the middle of the road, near the end of the clip, silhouettes of dancing women begin to form in the flames behind her. The video ends with Eilish, now completely turned into a demon, walking away into the flames. Uproxxs Derrick Rossignol wrote that the visual is \"full of fire and darkness\". Elle Hunt of The Guardian noted that a closer inspection of the lyrics suggests that the song (and by extension, the music video) references global warming, and Eilish herself alluded to this by posting a personal note on the video description rallying her fans to attend global climate strikes on September 20 and 27, three days before the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York City. University of California at Santa Barbara Professor Ken Hiltner notes that the initial scene, where Eilish falls from heaven into a post-industrial wasteland, as a modern re-imagination of John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost. ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal and the liner notes of When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?
