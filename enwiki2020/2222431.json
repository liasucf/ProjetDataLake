    "text": "Restless is a 1992 album by Skydiggers. It was the band's most commercially successful release, and produced their biggest chart hit, \"A Penny More\". In 1996, the album disappeared from Canadian record stores after the band's label, FRE Records, filed for bankruptcy. Although the band pursued litigation to win back the master tapes, they were not successful. As a result, in 1999, they released an alternate version of the album, Still Restless: The Lost Tapes. ==Track listing== # \"Accusations\" \u2013 2:42 (Skydiggers) # \"Feel You Closer\" \u2013 2:24 (P.Cash) # \"A Penny More\" \u2013 4:15 (Finlayson/Maize) # \"Restless (It's Alright)\" \u2013 2:33 (Finlayson/Maize) # \"This Old Town\" \u2013 2:42 (P.Cash) # \"Swamp Boogie\" \u2013 3:11 (P.Cash) # \"Don't Blame it On Me\" \u2013 3:22 (P.Cash) # \"I Don't Know Why\" \u2013 3:56 (P.Cash) # \"I Don't Want To Talk About It\" \u2013 4:54 (Finlayson/Maize) # \"Just Before the Rain\" \u2013 2:34 (P.Cash) # \"Slow Burning Fire\" \u2013 3:24 (J.Buckingham) # \"It's Sunday Pouring Down Rain\" \u2013 2:42 (P.Cash) # \"She'd Calm Down\" \u2013 3:02 (Skydiggers) ==References== Category:1992 albums Category:Skydiggers albums ",
