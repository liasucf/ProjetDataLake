    "text": "Surviving America's Most Hated Family is a 2019 BBC documentary film presented and written by Louis Theroux. The programme follows as Theroux revisits the family at the core of the Westboro Baptist Church and observes how its members have changed since the death of the church's founder, Fred Phelps. The documentary first aired on BBC Two in the United Kingdom on 14 July 2019, and is the third in a trilogy of documentaries Theroux has made about the church. It was preceded by 2007's The Most Hated Family in America, and 2011's America's Most Hated Family in Crisis. While the first two documentaries focused on the controversial doctrine, cult-like atmosphere and extensive protest activities of the church, the third documentary concerns itself primarily with the lives of former members. It also covers the impact of the death of lead Pastor Fred Phelps on the church, as well as his rumored death- bed excommunication for softening his anti-homosexual rhetoric. Megan Phelps's defection from the church, from devoted follower to critic, as well as her attempts to stay in contact with her family (in particular with her mother Shirley) is covered in detail. Theroux also notes an odd phenomenon where his previous critical documentaries inspired two young men, UK ex-pat Steven Holroyd and a young American called 'J', to join the church. Steven, who is now known as Mathias and is a former mailman, flew over to Topeka and married Pastor Phelps' granddaughter Jael Phelps after becoming interested in the church after watching Theroux's previous films air on BBC. Steven had previously released a video online in which he stated his main reason for leaving the UK was its approval of Elton John's gay lifestyle and the lack of King James Only churches. ==Reception== Surviving America's Most Hated Family garnered a mixed-to-positive reception from critics. Gerard O'Donovan of The Telegraph gave it two out of five stars, deeming it \"a rare misstep from this normally pin-sharp documentarian.\" Brian Donaldson of The List gave the special three out of five stars, calling it \"a road to nowhere.\" Conversely, Lucy Mangan of The Guardian rated it four out of five stars, while admitting it was \"a deeply uncomfortable watch.\" Both O'Donovan and Mangan accused the documentary of veering into exploitation. O'Donovan wrote, \"Theroux went wrong, withholding some potentially distressing news from (Megan Phelps-Roper) until a moment of maximum emotional impact, and lingering long on her shocked and tearful reaction.\" Mangan agreed, saying \"It is profoundly uncomfortable to watch and, for me, errs firmly on the side of exploitation \u2013 which is not, generally, Theroux\u2019s stock-in-trade.\" Phelps-Roper personally defended Louis' decision to reveal this information in this manner, stating in a Twitter post that she knows her family will watch the documentary and will see how devastated she was. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Louis Theroux's BBC Two specials Category:2019 television films Category:2019 films Category:British films Category:BBC television documentaries Category:Westboro Baptist Church Category:Documentary films about Christianity in the United States Category:Documentary films about families Category:Television episodes set in Kansas Category:BBC travel television series ",
