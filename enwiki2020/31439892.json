    "text": "Bagel toast () is a sandwich commonly eaten in Israel. It is composed of a pressed, toasted bagel filled with vegetables and cheese and is grilled on a sandwich toaster or panini press. While the bagel is round with a hole in the center, it is unlike the typical American bagel in that it is made from a different dough with sesame seeds. Bagel toast is generally filled with tzfatit, feta, white, or yellow cheese, green olives, corn, tomatoes, onions, dressing, and pizza or chili sauce. Bagel toast is typically found in cafes or coffee houses in Israel and is also served as a casual snack in the home. At the famous Abulafia Bakery, in Jaffa, Israel, for example, bagel toast is served with a side of za'atar, a mixture of sumac, sesame seeds, and herbs. ==See also== * Bagel and cream cheese * List of sandwiches * List of toast dishes ==References== ==External links== Category:Bagels Category:Israeli cuisine Category:Jewish breads Category:Cheese sandwiches Category:Toast dishes ",
