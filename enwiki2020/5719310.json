Foch (Supreme Allied Commander) standing, his chief of staff Weygand sitting on the right. Wemyss was the senior British representative at the signing of the armistice that ended active hostilities in the war. It was Weymyss who made the decision, much to the anger of British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, to have the ceasefire to come into effect at 11.00 a.m. Lloyd George wanted it to take place at 2.30 p.m. so that he could make the announcement in the House of Commons. Wemyss realised that 11 a.m on the 11th day of the 11th month had a strong, poetic quality about it; besides, by 2.30 p.m. more soldiers could be unnecessarily killed. After attending the Paris Peace Conference as Britain's naval representative, Wemyss resigned in November 1919 following persistent calls for Sir David Beatty to be given his job.Heathcote, p. 253 Wemyss was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 1 November 1919 and was raised to the peerage as Baron Wester Wemyss, of Wemyss in the County of Fife on 18 November 1919.
