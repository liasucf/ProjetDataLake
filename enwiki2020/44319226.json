    "text": "Plumbr is an Estonian software product company founded in late 2011 that develops performance monitoring software running on a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The Plumbr product is built on top of a proprietary algorithm that automatically detects the root causes of Java performance issues by interpreting application performance data. ==Products== Plumbr monitors customers' JVM applications for memory leaks, garbage collection pauses and locked threads. Plumbr problem detection algorithms are based on analysis of performance data of thousands of JVMs. Plumbr consists of an agent and a portal. Plumbr Agent is attached to JVM and sends memory usage and garbage collection information to Plumbr Portal. On Plumbr Portal one can see information such as heap and permgen memory usage, garbage collection pauses' and lock contention duration. Clients that can't send data to third parties can order a self-hosted portal and have full solution in-house. In case of incidents Plumbr provides its users with information on problem severity, problem's root cause location in source code or JVM configuration and lists steps needed to take to remediate the problem. Clients include NASA, NATO, Dell, HBO, Experian, EMC Corporation. ==References== == External links == * Category:Software companies of Estonia Category:Computer programming tools Category:Java development tools Category:Java virtual machine Category:Performance management Category:Profilers Category:Software companies established in 2011 ",
