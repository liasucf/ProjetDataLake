    "text": "Dejan Petkovi\u0107 (, pronounced ; born 10 September 1972) is a Serbian football pundit and retired footballer. In his native country he is widely known under the nickname Rambo while in Brazil he is known as Pet. He played six times for the FR Yugoslavia, scoring one goal. Petkovi\u0107 played for seven Brazilian clubs in his career, and was made an honorary consul of Serbia in Brazil. ==Early life== Born to father Dobrivoje (traffic technician from Ni\u0161) and mother Milena (construction technician from Petrovac na Mlavi) who met in the small mining town of Majdanpek where they both arrived in search of work, young Dejan immediately took to football. ==Club career== ===Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161=== Petkovi\u0107's playing career started in 1988 at Radni\u010dki Ni\u0161. In the same year, he met his future wife Violeta. He became the youngest player ever to play an official match in the history of old Yugoslav First League, debuting on 25 September 1988 when he was 16 years and 15 days old, against \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo\"A boa vida dos gringos\", Placar n\u00ba. 1239, September 2002, Editora Abril, pp. 48\u201349. thus beating Mitar Mrkela's record by 1 day. Radni\u010dki ended up winning 4\u20130 in that match. Petkovi\u0107's age record has since been broken by Slavko Perovi\u0107 and Danijel Aleksi\u0107. Petkovi\u0107 still helps his first club,\"Petkov\u00edcio\", Rafael Maranh\u00e3o, Placar n\u00ba. 1289, December 2005, Editora Abril, pp. 62\u201367. which has since then declined. ===Red Star Belgrade=== In July 1992, Petkovi\u0107 was bought by Red Star Belgrade. Though not even 20 years of age, he arrived with a reputation as a skilled technical playmaker. As established Yugoslav internationals such as Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107, Darko Pan\u010dev, Vladimir Jugovi\u0107, and Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107 left the club during the same summer, Petkovi\u0107 was given a first-team run straight away by new head coach Milan \u017divadinovi\u0107, appearing in 30 league matches and scoring 5 goals in his first season in Belgrade. He ended up staying with Red Star until December 1995 (three and a half seasons), winning two Yugoslav First League titles. His transfer to Real Madrid was principally agreed during summer 1995, but Red Star decided to hang on to him for the 1995\u201396 UEFA Cup where the club expected to do well after finally being allowed back on the European scene following years of sporting sanctions due to regional conflicts. However, Red Star was eliminated by Swiss club Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax in the preliminary round. ===Real Madrid=== In December 1995, 23-year-old Petkovi\u0107 joined the Spanish giants Real Madrid. At the time of his arrival, the club was not where it wanted to be in the league, hovering just outside the European spots in 6th and 7th place. Playing under head coach Jorge Valdano, Rambo made his league debut on 17 December versus Celta de Vigo as a 65th minute sub for the legendary club veteran M\u00edchel as Madrid won 1\u20130 at home. Petkovic would see action again on 3 January at home versus Real Valladolid \u2014 Madrid was comfortably 4\u20131 ahead when Valdano threw Petkovi\u0107 on for Iv\u00e1n Zamorano in the 61st minute. What would turn out to be Petkovi\u0107's last appearance of the season for the club came the following week away at lowly CP M\u00e9rida \u2014 Real let the 0\u20132 lead slip by conceding two goals and in the 81st minute Valdano sent Petkovi\u0107 in for Freddy Rinc\u00f3n in search of a goal, but the score stayed 2\u20132. Within a fortnight Petkovi\u0107 was loaned out to Sevilla before being able to have a first-team run during his one month at the Bernabeu. ====Loan to Sevilla==== Arriving to Estadio S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n in mid-January 1996, Petkovi\u0107 was once again parachuted into a club battling turmoil. Sevilla was barely above the relegation zone with head coach Juan Carlos \u00c1lvarez (already their second head coach of the season) on thin ice. Juan Carlos gave his new Serbian acquisition his debut at home on 24 January vs Albacete as a starter. Playing upfront with Davor \u0160uker as strike partner, Petkovi\u0107 had an average outing as Sevilla drew 1\u20131 with Castillan visitors, which cost head coach Juan Carlos his job. Four days later away at Real Sociedad, new head coach V\u00edctor Esp\u00e1rrago gave Petkovi\u0107 the starting assignment again alongside \u0160uker, but subbed him off for Ram\u00f3n \"Monchu\" Su\u00e1rez Del Valle early into the second half in the 53rd minute. The next week versus Racing de Santander, Petkovi\u0107 was moved back into attacking midfielder role just behind \u0160uker and Monchu, however Sevilla again lost 0\u20131 while Petkovi\u0107 got subbed off in the 59th minute. The following week Petkovi\u0107 got relegated to the bench, only getting a bit part as an 89th-minute sub as Sevilla improbably triumphed away at league- leaders Atletico Madrid, however, the week after that he was back in the starting assignment. Petkovi\u0107 finished out the 1995\u20131996 La Liga season in Sevilla, appearing in 8 league matches (7 as a starter) and scoring 1 goal. ====Return==== During summer 1996, Petkovi\u0107 returned from the loan spell in Sevilla. The Real squad that he returned to was radically different from the one he left six months earlier: starting with new head coach Fabio Capello over to attack-minded left back Roberto Carlos from Inter Milan, right back Christian Panucci from AC Milan, attacking midfielder Clarence Seedorf from Sampdoria right down to the all new forward line with Petkovi\u0107's former teammate \u0160uker from Sevilla, and fellow Yugoslav Predrag Mijatovi\u0107 from Valencia. The competition for spots up front thus got even tougher. Despite having a reputation for cautious and defensive football, Capello played a three-man attack of Ra\u00fal, Mijatovi\u0107, and \u0160uker, with Seedorf just behind them. It became clear that Capello was not counting on Petkovi\u0107, as he did not play a match until coming on as late substitute in the fourth match of the season.Real Madrid-Rayo Vallecano 1:0;La Liga, 22 September 1996. Retrieved 27 October 2017. A week later Petkovi\u0107 came on as a late substitute at Real OviedoReal Oviedo-Real Madrid 2:3;La Liga, 29 September 1996. Retrieved 27 October 2017. for his last Madrid appearance. ====Loan to Santander==== Petkovi\u0107 got loaned out to Racing de Santander in January 1997. He then briefly returned to Real before being discovered by Vit\u00f3ria in a friendly tournament in which both clubs were involved. along with Real Mallorca and Flamengo. ===Vit\u00f3ria=== He joined Vit\u00f3ria along with Bebeto and T\u00falio Costa, the three signed for the club thanks to the sponsorship of Banco Excel.\"500 Times do Brasil\", Placar n\u00ba. 1263-A, October 2003, Editora Abril, pp. 20 In the rubro-negro baiano he started his successful Brazilian career, winning two Bahia State Championships and a Copa do Nordeste. He stayed until 1999 at Vit\u00f3ria, when he joined Venezia of Italy, after an 8 billion lire transfer. ===Flamengo=== Petkovic did not succeed at Venezia, and quickly returned to Brazil, where he joined Flamengo of Rio de Janeiro. In Flamengo his skills were fundamental in helping the team win the last two titles of the historic three in a row series against arch-rivals Vasco, from 1999 to 2001. One month later, another free kick goal by Petkovic, against S\u00e3o Paulo, allowed Flamengo to win the Copa dos Campe\u00f5es and return to Copa Libertadores next year. Hugely popular at the time, he was known as \"Pet\" by the supporters. However, at 2001 Campeonato Brasileiro, Flamengo finished only one position above the relegated teams. The club also lost, in January 2002, the Copa Mercosul final against the Argentine side San Lorenzo, in a match in which Petkovic was sent off. ===Vasco da Gama=== In 2002, he moved to Vasco da Gama, where he stayed until 2004. He played for a short time at the Chinese club Shanghai Shenhua during this period where he won the 2003 league title with them. Unfortunately, in 2013 the Chinese Football Association would revoke the league title after it was discovered the Shenhua General manager Lou Shifang had bribed officials to be biased to Shenhua in games that season. During his second spell at Vasco he helped his team avoid relegation at Campeonato Brasileiro, being the club's top scorer and top assistant.\"Salvo pelo gringo\", Placar n\u00ba. 1278-A, January 2005, Editora Abril, pp. 53 Vasco failed to record a win the 10 matches without Petkovic, acquiring only 10% of available points; with him the cruzmaltinos obtained 45.7% of these points. After helping them stay up, Petkovi\u0107 was awarded Bola de Prata from the Placar magazine as one of the two best midfielders in the league. During that year he often played with an ex- teammate from Radni\u010dki, Montenegrin goalkeeper \u017deljko Tadi\u0107, who was scouted by him.\"Vai dar suco?\", L\u00e9dio Carmona, Placar n\u00ba. 1292, March 2006, Editora Abril, pp. 73. ===Fourth team in Brazil: Fluminense=== After a half-year in Saudi Arabia, where he played for Al-Ittihad, he returned to Rio de Janeiro in August 2005, now to play for Fluminense. Already 33 years old, Petkovi\u0107 had to face a certain mistrust from the club's fans due to his association with Flamengo. However, his amazing performance in his third match against Cruzeiro Esporte Clube, put an end to fan's misgivings, as he scored twice in a 6\u20132 away win. His first was the 1000th goal score by the Fluminense in the Brazilian Championship, earning Petkovi\u0107 a commemorative plate in his honour at the club's headquarters. In this goal, Petkovic passed through three opponents in a short space, shooting just in time to avoid the oncoming goalkeeper. In the second one, he placed a powerful left-foot shot from outside the penalty box.\"Petkovic \u2013 O gringo mais brasileiro\", S\u00e9rgio Xavier Filho, Placar n\u00ba. 1287, October 2005, Editora Abril, pp. 16. After other great exhibitions, he received his second consecutive Silver Ball in the Brazilian federation annual award ceremony. After a bad season in 2006, when Fluminense had to fight relegation, he left the club. ===Other clubs=== In 2007, he played at Santos after signing a short term deal from Goi\u00e1s until the end of the 2007 season. In 2008, Petkovic played for Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro, signed in late March 2008 as the great star of the club's centennial celebrations. Nevertheless, his contract was not renewed at the end of the season on orders from the newly arrived coach, Emerson Le\u00e3o who previously also released Petkovi\u0107 from Santos when he arrived there in December 2007. ===Return to Flamengo=== On 20 May 2009 Flamengo announced the free transfer signing of Petkovic, despite previously having taken the club to court over unpaid wages in the amount of US$9 million. Though the two parties managed to settle the outstanding financial issues out of court prior to his signing, Petkovi\u0107's return was still met with a lot of scepticism, even outright opposition, from many people within the club as well as outside observers all of whom had doubts about his ability to perform at such an age. Some also expressed concern over the fact that he missed the Rio de Janeiro state championship part of the season, meaning that he hadn't played any competitive football in the 6 months since his dismissal from Mineiro. However, much to the surprise of many people, 37-year-old Petkovic played a pivotal role for Flamengo, scoring 8 goals (including 2 direct from corners) and leading the club's challenge to eventually win its fifth Brazilian Championship title, the first of his career. He overcame being left out of the team by manager Cuca when his replacement in July, Andrade, included him in the team and allowed him to help the club rise from 14th place. Petkovic was praised by the Brazilian press for a number of outstanding performances, including a brace he scored in round 30 for a 2\u20130 win away at league leaders Palmeiras on 18 October 2009, as well as his round 34 contribution on 8 November away at Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro where the team recorded important 1\u20133 win. On 20 November 2009 he was inducted into the Brazilian Hall of Fame in the Maracana, thus becoming only the fifth non- Brazilian and third European to receive such an honour in Brazil. Then on 7 December, as the season finished and Flamengo celebrated their title, Petkovi\u0107 won the traditional Bola de Prata (Silver Ball) organized by the sports magazine Placar and ESPN Brasil for best midfielder of the 2009 Brazilian Championship. It was the third time that he was awarded the prize. Starting the new season from the very beginning, Petkovic entered his first match of the 2010 Rio state championship as a late substitute and scored a goalPetkovic for 1\u20133 at Volta Redonda on what was virtually his first touch of the contest at Volta Redonda on 20 January 2010. On 5 June 2011, Petkovi\u0107 retired as a professional player after playing the first half of the league match against Corinthians. To commemorate his retirement, all Flamengo players had Petkovic's name on the back of their jerseys in the match. ==International career== Petkovi\u0107 started playing by SFR Yugoslavia youth teams when he was 15 years old. In that age, he even scored one of the fastest goals in football, after just three seconds in a match against Cyprus. He was later called to 1992 Toulon Tournament, alongside players like Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107, Zoran Mirkovi\u0107, \u017deljko Cicovi\u0107, Elvir Boli\u0107, Spira Gruji\u0107, Mitko Stojkovski, Sr\u0111an Baj\u010deti\u0107, Miladin Be\u010danovi\u0107, Igor Ta\u0161evski, Sretko Vuksanovi\u0107 and \u017deljko Tadi\u0107. His team made a runner-up campaign, in which Petkovi\u0107 scored two goals in a 3\u20130 triumph over United States (against players such as Brad Friedel, Claudio Reyna, Alexi Lalas and Cobi Jones). While still playing in that youth tournament, he received his first call up to the senior national team, being included for the UEFA Euro 1992 squad. Yugoslav coaches had already called eighteen from the twenty allowed players, without Croats, keeping some Macedonians, two Slovenes and just one Bosniak alongside the Serbs and Montenegrins. It was expected that the later two players would be Miroslav \u0110uki\u0107 and Dragi\u0161a Bini\u0107, but Petkovi\u0107 and Slobodan Kr\u010dmarevi\u0107 were included instead, at 29 May, just two days after that 3\u20130 winning game against USA at the Toulon Tournament. He and Kr\u010dmarevi\u0107 then came immediately to Sweden, where their teammates were already preparing for the Euro. But Yugoslavia would be suspended at 31 May due to its civil wars, just ten days before the opening match. After that, Petkovi\u0107 was called to FR Yugoslavia first matches after its banning, in December 1994, although staying in the bench \u2013 curiously, the first match of Yugoslav return was against Brazil. In a South American tour, the second match would be against Argentina. In that day, Petkovi\u0107 started disagreements with the then coach Slobodan Santra\u010d. The player was praised in the training sessions and, under Santra\u010d's orders, warmed up from the 30th minute to the 80th one and then decided to seat, as thinking he would not play anymore. Santra\u010d was disgusted and called another reserve to enter;Dejan Petkovi\u0107 \u2013 um carioca raro (December 2009). Revista ESPN n. 2. Ed Spring, pp. 20\u201321 it was Darko Kova\u010devi\u0107, who mad his senior debut as replacing Predrag Mijatovi\u0107. After two another matches without being used, Petkovi\u0107 then earned his first cap on 31 March 1995, against Uruguay, in Belgrade. He was included in the starting players as of the next Yugoslav match, against Russia. In his second cap, he scored a goal just one minute after a Valery Karpin one, but Yugoslavia still lost by 2\u20131. Petkovi\u0107 also played the three later matches of Yugoslavia in 1995. All of them were winnings in away fields. In the last 1995 match, however, he again had disagreements with Santra\u010d, even after giving three assists and scoring an incorrectly invalid goal. After such a performance, the player did not like criticism from the coach, who appointed two wrong passes of Petkovi\u0107, who did objections to Santra\u010d qualities. Petkovi\u0107 still received a Santra\u010d call up for a match against Romania in March 1996, after some good initial performances for Real Madrid and Sevilla. It was the first 1996 game of Yugoslav team. However, two weeks before it, in a Sevilla training, Petkovi\u0107 suffered a serious injury which would withdraw him for the rest of the season. Santra\u010d would not call him anymore and the player did not took part in the 1998 FIFA World Cup. It was only after Milan \u017divadinovi\u0107 took the helm of the Yugoslavia national team that Petkovi\u0107 earned another chance with his national side \u2013 curiously, in another friendly against Brazil, in September 1998. Playing for Vit\u00f3ria at the time, Petkovi\u0107 traveled to S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds in the same flight as the Brazilian team. He was even a starting player in a 1\u20131 draw, being later replaced by Sa\u0161a \u0106ur\u010di\u0107. It would be his last official match for the national team. Because of that, Petkovi\u0107 later expressed his belief in being called up for that game just because he would be a good Portuguese language translator to Yugoslav crew. He still later played another two unofficial matches for Yugoslavia, in December 1999, under Vujadin Bo\u0161kov rule. Petkovi\u0107 was a starting player and even captain against Canary Islands (scoring a goal in a 2\u20132 draw against Luis Molowny coached players) and Catalonia (a 1\u20130 defeat). He was meanwhile a Venezia player, but some days later he left Italy to play again in Brazil, for Flamengo. Some also blame Petkovi\u0107's few and far in between call-ups on the fact he played for Brazilian sides most of his career, and thus was not always readily available for Yugoslavian coaches to watch him perform, evidenced by the fact he was omitted by Bo\u0161kov from the Euro 2000 roster after coming to Flamengo. Furthermore, Petkovi\u0107 declared in an interview to Placar magazine that he was more likely to get a call-up had he stayed at Venezia, a club he regarded as \"ten times weaker club than Flamengo\". Petkovi\u0107 was also rumoured to not have very favorable relationships with the Football Association of Yugoslavia, yet another speculation for his few caps. According to him and his family, another reason was his denial in accept bribes charged by high ranked Federation officials. In 2004, some have even felt Petkovi\u0107 would have made the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o if he were Brazilian. To that end, after the changing of the former FR Yugoslavia into Serbia and Montenegro the previous year, he publicized his dream in being picked by the Brazil national side,\"P\u00e1tria amada, Brasil\", Fl\u00e1via Ribeiro, Placar n\u00ba. 1274, September 2004, Editora Abril, pp. 50\u201353. but he did not have Brazilian citizenship. In 2006, a campaign in his native country urged the Serbian FA to select Petkovi\u0107 for Serbia and Montenegro's final roster for the World Cup in Germany. Striker Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107 even went as far as saying Petkovi\u0107 would be a welcome addition. In January 2006, it was announced that Petkovi\u0107 would be called up for friendly matches in February, but nothing ever came of it. The then Serbia and Montenegro coach Ilija Petkovi\u0107, who is not a relative of him, thought Dejan Petkovi\u0107 would disrupt the team's harmony, as he had a reputation for having a very loud personality. However, even before the nation upcoming final breakup, the harmony was disrupted by the coach himself, after Ilija called his son Du\u0161an Petkovi\u0107, a defender who played just a few matches until 2004 for the team, to replace the injured forward Mirko Vu\u010dini\u0107. Embarrassed after huge criticism, Du\u0161an asked to not take part of the squad. In a first moment, it was believed that the replacement player would be Dejan Petkovi\u0107, as he told in 2018 to El Pa\u00eds journal: \"I came from a fantastic 2005 Campeonato Brasileiro for Fluminense. My matches in Brazil were broadcast in Serbia. The whole country asked my calling up. They always created an excuse to not bring me. When the Cup squad list was launched, people asked themselves why I was not selected. In those days, Zico said that Serbia would win the Cup: 'they have 23 players better them Pet'. So, Vu\u010dini\u0107 injured himself. And then they announced the substitute: 'D. Petkovi\u0107'. Some people started calling to congrat me, but, actually, the chosen one was Du\u0161an Petkovi\u0107, the coach's son. He exchanged a forward for a defender. It resounded so negatively, reaching the point that, in the preparation for the Cup, the boy could not stand the pressure and left, ashamed of being there. We played the Cup with one player less. They never gave me an official statement. Off the records, they told that, if they call up me, I would have to play. Unfortunately, I lost two World Cups. I joined the select group of the good players who never played a World Cup. I have not any frustration for not playing the Cup, because it was not a failure of mine. In football, a few people have power to ruin a lot ot things. The people who managed my country team did bad things to me, the institution itself did not. I do not hold any sorrow\". Petkovi\u0107 retired from professional football without ever playing for the White Eagles. In 2009, Serbia coach Radomir Anti\u0107 praised Petkovi\u0107's success as an incoming 2009 Brazilian champion for Flamengo, but confirmed the player's too unlikely chances in being included for 2010 FIFA World Cup. Petkovi\u0107 never had such expectations anymore, feeling himself too old as having 37 years: \"I would like having ten years less to at least go to a World Cup\", he said while celebrating his country confirmation to South Africa. He just kept some desire in playing a last friendly match for his national team. ==Playing style== He is considered one of the best foreign players to have played in Brazil, a great free and corner kicker and passer. In 2006 while playing for Fluminense, he scored a goal directly from a corner against Gr\u00eamio. In the next game, he scored another, but the ball hit the hand of a player from Fluminense and entered the goal; nonetheless, the officials counted it as one. Overall, he scored eight goals from corner kicks in his career, the last one on 8 November 2009 for Flamengo against Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro in the Brazilian S\u00e9rie A. He is currently the record holder for most goals from corners scored in football history. ==Legacy== *His form in the first half of 2001 preceded the arrival of five more Serbs to Brazilian football. \u017deljko Tadi\u0107 (who would play later with Petkovic at Vasco), Miodrag An\u0111elkovi\u0107, Nikola Damjanac, Vladimir \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107, Dejan Osmanovi\u0107, and Vladimir Petkovi\u0107 (unrelated to Dejan Petkovic). *In November 2009, following Petkovi\u0107's pinnacle season at Flamengo, Serbian film director Darko Baji\u0107 started shooting a documentary on Petkovi\u0107's life and career path. Initially with the working title of Rambo Petkovi\u0107 \u2013 90 minuta sa produ\u017eecima, \u017eivotni me\u010d and later O Gringo, the film is meant to be shown before the 2010 World Cup. Apparently, the director wanted to make the film ever since Petkovi\u0107's initial successes with Flamengo in 2001, but the player wasn't thrilled with the idea. Petkovi\u0107 eventually agreed during his second stint with Flamengo. The yet unfinished movie was promoted in Belgrade on 29 December 2009. *His pivotal role in Flamengo's road to its fifth league title motivated a pop song, \"\u00c9 o Pet\". *Although his return home to possibly finish out his career with Red Star and/or perhaps take an administrative role in the club once his playing career is over was occasionally mentioned in Serbian media, Petkovi\u0107 said in early 2010 that he'll continue living in Brazil even after stopping playing. Though not mentioning anything specific, he said that he wants to take advantage of the opportunities 2014 World Cup and 2016 Rio Olympics will provide for those who want to be involved with sports. *Petkovi\u0107 was a color commentator for Brazilian sports cable franchise SporTV during the 2018 World Cup.
