This spin-off program is officially recognized as a part of I Can See Your Voice franchise. ==Gameplay== ===Format=== Under the versus format, both guest artists can eliminate one mystery singer each in the first two rounds, and then both can choose one mystery singer each to perform a duet with in the third round. The winning condition implies to each mystery singer chosen by guest artist that has been performed a duet separately, if: * One guest artist had chosen a \"good singer\" and another one had chosen a \"bad singer\"; or * Both two guest artists had chosen a \"good singer\" or a \"bad singer\". ;Rewards The guest artist(s) gets \u20ab50,000,000 (if one of them was a good singer); or \u20ab25,000,000 each (if both two were good singers). Both winning mystery singers also get \u20ab10,000,000 each. ===Rounds=== There are seven individuals of mystery singers standing on the platform with its aliases to keep their identities concealed until stage of truth performance. ;Round 1: Singer's visual The guest artist is given some time to observe and examine each mystery singer based on their appearance. After this, a muted video of each mystery singer that reveals only 0.3 seconds of their singing voice is played as an additional hint. ;Round 2: Singer's lip-sync Each mystery singer performs a lip-sync of a song. Good singers lip-sync to their own voice, while bad singers lip-sync to other's voices. ;Round 3: Singer's talent The guest artist(s) must predict the remaining mystery singers based on other talents, except \"singing\" itself. It is unrelated to the stage of truth, but it depends on identity. ==Episodes (2017)== ===Guest artists=== {|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size:100%; white-space:nowrap;\" |Color key: |- | |- | |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" text-align:center; line-height:18px; width:100%;\" ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"|Episode ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"|Guest artist ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"6\"|Mystery singers |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|# ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|Date ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"5\"|Elimination order ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|Winner |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"|Visual round ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"|Lip-sync round ! scope=\"col\"|Talent round |- !rowspan=\"2\"|1 |rowspan=\"2\"|7 October 2017 | |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|2 |rowspan=\"2\"|14 October 2017 |Jun Ph\u1ea1m |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- |Miu L\u00ea | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|3 |rowspan=\"2\"|21 October 2017 | |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- |Tronie Ng\u00f4 | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|4 |rowspan=\"2\"|28 October 2017 | |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|5 |rowspan=\"2\"|4 November 2017 |Lam Tr\u01b0\u1eddng |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- |Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng Thanh | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|6 |rowspan=\"2\"|11 November 2017 | |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|7 |rowspan=\"2\"|18 November 2017 | |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|8 |rowspan=\"2\"|25 November 2017 | |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|9 |rowspan=\"2\"|2 December 2017 | |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- |Will | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|10 |rowspan=\"2\"|9 December 2017 | |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|11 |rowspan=\"2\"|16 December 2017 |Kh\u1ed5ng T\u00fa Qu\u1ef3nh |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|12 |rowspan=\"2\"|23 December 2017 | |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|13 |rowspan=\"2\"|30 December 2017 |Ho\u00e0i L\u00e2m |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- |V\u0169 C\u00e1t T\u01b0\u1eddng | |} ==Episodes (2018)== ===Guest artists=== {|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size:100%; white-space:nowrap;\" |Color key: |- | |- | |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" text-align:center; line-height:18px; width:100%;\" ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"|Episode ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"|Guest artist ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"6\"|Mystery singers |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|# ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|Date ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"5\"|Elimination order ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|Winner |- ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"|Visual round ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"|Lip-sync round ! scope=\"col\"|Talent round |- !rowspan=\"2\"|14 |rowspan=\"2\"|6 January 2018 | |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|15 |rowspan=\"2\"|13 January 2018 | |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|16 |rowspan=\"2\"|20 January 2018 |\u0110oan Trang |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|17 |rowspan=\"2\"|27 January 2018 | |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |- !rowspan=\"2\"|18 |rowspan=\"2\"|3 February 2018 | |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" |rowspan=\"2\" | |- | | |} ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:2017 Vietnamese television seasons Category:2018 Vietnamese television seasons Category:Hidden Voices (game show) ",
