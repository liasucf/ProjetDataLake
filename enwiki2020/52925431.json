    "text": "The Tanzania Postal Bank Plc. is a licensed commercial bank in Tanzania and one has the roots of one of the oldest banking institutions in the country. The bank traces its roots to the Tanganyika Post office Savings Bank, which then formed an entirely independent entity from the Tanzania Posts Corporation. In 2017 the bank aimed to list itself on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange and officially transformed into a Public limited company. == History == === Incorporation === In 1925 the Tanganyika Post Office Savings Bank Ordinance was passed by the British Colonial government that established the Tanganyika Post office Savings Bank. The bank became operational in just two years in 1927. === Financial Sector Reform === After the government of Tanzania began financial sector reform following the end of Ujamaa economic policies in the country, the Tanzania Post office Savings bank was transformed into a separate entity, the Tanzania Postal Bank. The Tanzania Postal Bank Act No. 11 of 1991 created the bank as a separate entity from the Tanzania Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. Since attaining its independence, the bank has provided services to a much larger population than before and it has begun to provide a profit to the government. === Public Limited Company === In 2015 the bank management declared that the bank will list the bank on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange, in order to raise capital to expand and automate the companies operations. On January 19, 2017, the bank officially rebranded the company and Tanzania Postal Bank Limited changed its name to TPB Bank Plc. === Mergers and Acquisitions === In 2018, the Bank of Tanzania merged Twiga Bancorp and Tanzania Women's Bank into Tanzania Postal Bank due to their poor performance. In June 2020, the central bank merged TIB Commerial limited into TPB. The merger is set to bring the total assets of the bank to over 1 Trillion Tanzanian shillings. == Corporate Affairs == === Ownership === As of December 2018 the banks ownership is split among four stakeholders. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" |+ Tanzania Postal Bank Stock Ownership ! style=\"width:2em;\" |Rank !!Name of Owner!!Percentage Ownership |- |1||Government of Tanzania||83.44 |- |2||Tanzania Posts Corporation||7.61 |- |3||Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar||2.91 |- |4||TP & TC Savings and Credit Society||2.67 |- |5||Local Authorities Pension Fund (LAPF)||2.35 |- |6||Workers\u2019 Compensa\u019f on Fund (WCF)||1.02 |- ||| TOTAL||100.0 |- |} === Business trends === Tanzania Postal bank year ends on December of the year {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" ! ! 2012 ! 2013 ! 2014 ! 2015 ! 2016 ! 2017 ! 2018 |- | Total Revenue (TZS Billions) | align=\"center\" |31.10 | align=\"center\" |38.48 | align=\"center\" |53.22 | align=\"center\" |74.49 | align=\"center\" |91.67 | align=\"center\" |106.8 | align=\"center\" |118.3 |- |Interest Income (TZS Billions) | align=\"center\" |20.87 | align=\"center\" |26.60 | align=\"center\" |34.75 | align=\"center\" |49.43 | align=\"center\" |66.81 | align=\"center\" |83.0 | align=\"center\" |96.0 |- | Profit After Tax (TZS Billions) | align=\"center\" |4.07 | align=\"center\" |4.74 | align=\"center\" |6.77 | align=\"center\" |8.27 | align=\"center\" |10.81 | align=\"center\" |12.7 | align=\"center\" |12.7 |- |Total Assets (TZS Billions) | align=\"center\" |167.3 | align=\"center\" |200.8 | align=\"center\" |297.8 | align=\"center\" |370.7 | align=\"center\" |400.8 | align=\"center\" |458.3 | align=\"center\" |562 |- | Number of Branches | align=\"center\" |28 | align=\"center\" |28 | align=\"center\" |28 | align=\"center\" |28 | align=\"center\" | | align=\"center\" | | align=\"center\" | |- |Number of Employees | align=\"center\" |444 | align=\"center\" |454 | align=\"center\" |574 | align=\"center\" |660 | align=\"center\" |700 | align=\"center\" |718 | align=\"center\" |888 |- | Notes/sources | align=\"center\" | | align=\"center\" | | align=\"center\" | | align=\"center\" | |align=\"center\" | |align=\"center\" | |align=\"center\" | |} ==References== == External links == *Website of Bank of Tanzania Category:Banks of Tanzania Category:Companies of Tanzania Category:Economy of Tanzania Category:Banks established in 1925 Category:1925 establishments in Tanganyika ",
