    "text": "The Maravatio shiner (Notropis marhabatiensis) is a small North American freshwater fish, where it is known only from San Miguel Spring of the upper Lerma River drainage in Mexico. The Maravatio shiner is a member of the Notropis calientis species complex along with the Ameca shiner, the Calabazas shiner, the Durango shiner and the Zacapu shiner, the latter being described concurrently with N. marhabatiensis. ==Conservation== The Maravatio shiner is found in a single pool around a spring near the town of Maravatio in Michoacan. In visits by researchers between 2004 and 2007 the species was not found. The small spring is enclosed by houses and is under intense human usage or recreation and sanitation. Exotic fish guppies (Poecilia reticulata), Twospot livebearers (Heterandria bimaculata) and Oreochromis sp. have been introduced and this could explain the possible absence of N. marhabatiensis from the spring. This species has not yet been evaluated by the IUCN for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species but its describers state that the species should be considered in danger of extinction and so should be evaluated as Critically Endangered. == References == Notropis Category:Freshwater fish of Mexico Category:Fish described in 2009 ",
