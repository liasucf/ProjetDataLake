Krzy\u017can, Marian. Mi\u0119dzynarodowe turnieje lotnicze 1929-1934 [International aviation competitions 1929-1934], Warsaw 1988, It had the same modern all-metal construction, covered with corrugated duralumin sheet, as larger Junkers passenger planes. The first flight of the A50 took place on 13 February 1929. It was followed by further four prototypes, in order to test different engines. Junkers expected to produce 5,000 aircraft, but stopped after manufacturing only 69, of which only 50 were sold. The high prices probably inhibited sales. Apart from Germany, they were used in several other countries and some were used by airlines. The purchase price in 1930 in the United Kingdom was between \u00a3840 or \u00a3885.Junkers Junior, Flight, April 4, 1930. Starting from the A50ce variant, the wings could be folded for easier transport. Three German A50 took part in the Challenge international touring plane competition in July 1929, taking 11th place (A50be, pilot Waldemar Roeder) and 17th place. Three A50 took part also in the Challenge 1930 next year, taking 15th (A50ce, pilot Johann Risztics), 27th and 29th places. In June 1930 a series of eight FAI world records for altitude, range and average speed were set on a floatplane variant of A50 with the Armstrong Siddeley 59 kW (79 hp) engine. In 1931 Marga von Etzdorf flew an A50 solo from Berlin to Tokyo, the first woman to do so.A50ce D-1842 shelters under the wing of big sister G.38 D-2000 in May 1930. ==Variants== *A50 - Armstrong Siddeley Genet radial engine *A50ba - Walter Vega radial engine (one built) *A50be - Armstrong Siddeley Genet engine *A50ce - Armstrong Siddeley Genet II engine or for export Genet Major I 74 kW, folding wings *A50ci - Siemens-Halske Sh 13, radial engine, folding wings.

The -ce and -ci variants were produced in the largest numbers with about 25 of each on the German civil register. Due to their construction, the A50 were durable aircraft and they lasted long in service. The last plane was used in the 1960s in Finland. There is one A50 preserved in Deutsches Museum in Munich and another in Helsinki airport. One A50 (VH-UCC, c/n3517) is in airworthy condition in Australia. ==Description== Metal construction sports plane, conventional in layout, with low cantilever wings, stressed corrugated duralumin covered. Two-spar wings were folding rearwards or could be detached. Crew of two, sitting in tandem in separate open cockpits (if it flew without a passenger, one cockpit could be closed with a cover). Two-blade propeller. Conventional fixed split axle mainwheel landing gear, with a rear skid. fuel tank A50ce in Helsinki-Vantaa, departure hall, gate 28 ==Operators== ; *Argentine Air Force ; *Royal Australian Air Force ; *Bolivian Air Force ; *Brazilian Air Force ; *Finnish Air Force ; *Reichswehr ; *Luftwaffe ; *Hungarian Air Force ; *Imperial Japanese Navy ; *Paraguayan Air Force ; *Portuguese Air Force ; *South African Air Force *South African Airways operated three aircraft ; *Swedish Air Force ; *Swiss Air Force ; *Royal Air Force ; *Uruguayan Air Force == Surviving aircraft == An example is currently on display in Helsinki Airport.
