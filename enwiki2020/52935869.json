    "text": "The National Super Alliance, known by the abbreviation NASA, is a Kenyan political coalition of opposition centre-left parties that was formed in January 2017. These parties include the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), Wiper Democratic Movement (Wiper), Forum for the Restoration of Democracy - Kenya (FORD-Kenya), Amani National Congress (ANC), National Rainbow Coalition, Progressive Party of Kenya, Chama Cha Uzalendo (CCU), and the Muungano Party (MP). Raila Amolo Odinga, Wycliffe Musalia Mudavadi, Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka, Moses Wetangula and Isaac Ruto are the co-principals of the coalition. The coalition was created to oppose President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy-President William Samoei Ruto in the 2017 general elections. ==Candidates== The NASA Coalition's presidential candidate for the 2017 general election was Raila Amolo Odinga, and the candidate for deputy-president was Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka. Odinga and Musyoka ran under the National Super Alliance. Thus, their political parties (the Orange Democratic Movement and the Wiper Democratic Movement) opted to field their own candidates for other political positions. The other political parties in the coalition also fielded candidates for various electoral positions. Thus, \"NASA candidates\" did not technically exist. Of all the principals, only Wycliffe Musalia Mudavadi did not run for electoral office. He instead ran the NASA National Campaign Committee. Raila Amolo Odinga and Stephen Kalonzo Musyoka ran for president and deputy president, Moses Wetangula for Bungoma County senator, and Isaac Ruto for Bomet County for governor. ==Manifesto== The NASA Coalition launched a six- point manifesto prior to the 2017 elections that focuses on * Food security * 'Progressive values' (democracy, affirmative action, freedom of the media, transparency, rule of law, and public participation) * Dealing with cartels * Kenya's debt burden * Job creation * Healthcare * Affordable education The manifesto borrowed heavily from that by the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy, for which Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka were also the candidates for president and deputy president for the 2013 general election. ==References== Category:2017 establishments in Kenya Category:Political parties established in 2017 Category:Political party alliances in Kenya ",
