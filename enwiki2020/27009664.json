    "text": ":To be distinguished from Giuditta a German operetta by Franz Leh\u00e1r. La Giuditta may refer to one of several Italian oratorios: Each version of La Giuditta deals with the figure of Judith, from the Biblical Apocrypha, who liberated the besieged city of Bethulia by seducing and then beheading the enemy General Holofernes. Judith and Holofernes are the two main roles common to all versions. Incidental characters, such as, in the larger Scarlatti Giuditta, Achior, a captain so revolted by Holofernes' brutality that he defects to the Israelite army, do not occur in other versions. ==Italian language oratorios== ===Scarlatti's Rome Giuditta=== Alessandro Scarlatti: La Giuditta, Rome, 1693.
