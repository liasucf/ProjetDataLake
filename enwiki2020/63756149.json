This allowed many universities to begin restarting their athletic programs. Yale was one of the few teams to have officially existed during the war but, despite that advantage, the Elis still had a great deal of difficulty in the spring semester. The agreement with the New Haven Arena had ended and the Bulldogs no longer had a permanent home. Additionally, many schools were not ready to field teams until February at the earliest, and even then only a few games were scheduled for most programs. As a consequence, Yale played just two games during the season. They were, however, against the Elis' two biggest rivals at the time, providing some measure of normalcy for the student body. With so few games, the team did not employ a coach for the season. As of 2020 this is the final season in which the Bulldogs did not have an official head coach. E. Harvey Cushing served as team manager instead. ==Roster== ==Standings== ==Schedule and Results== |- !colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season ==References== Category:Yale Bulldogs men's ice hockey seasons Yale Bulldogs Yale Bulldogs Yale Bulldogs Yale Bulldogs ",
