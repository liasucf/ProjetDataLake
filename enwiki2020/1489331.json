Burroughs, Jack Pierson and Nan Goldin, in describing Treleaven's place in \"a lineage of obdurate misfits\".Artforum, Spring 2006 He attended the Etobicoke School of the Arts. Treleaven's drawings are included in the final segment of 'Outside the Lines' at the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, a major 2014 survey of contemporary abstraction.Contemporary Arts Museum Houston ==Films== Treleaven's first film Queercore: A Punk-u-mentary was produced in 1996, a documentary on the queercore scene in the 1990s. In 2002 Treleaven presented an overview of his independent publishing experiences in a film entitled The Salivation Army which has been screened at MOMA and Art Basel, Switzerland. In 2005 photographer/director Carter Smith approached Treleaven about adapting his published horror story, Bugcrush, into Smith's Sundance Film Festival award-winning short film. Director Steven Spielberg has openly lauded the film.Bouchard, Stephanie, \"His life is in \u2018Ruins\u2019\", Maine Today, 3 April, 2008 In 2008, he appeared in the feature film, The Lollipop Generation by G.B.

Burroughs, Brion Gysin, William Blake, and Derek Jarman. The zine was a seeding ground for a variety of concepts and styles that would continue to appear in Treleaven's visual art. Books, zines and independently produced publications continue to be a recurring motif throughout his work. In 2006 a book marking the 10th anniversary of the This Is The Salivation Army project was published by Printed Matter (NY) and Art Metropole (Toronto), containing an entire reprint of the zines alongside more recent drawings and collages.
