In 2014, his club president, Redeno Apap, asked if he would apply for a Maltese passport, which was granted in March 2015. Later that month, national coach Pietro Ghedin was searching for a new striker after the suspension of Michael Mifsud. Effiong made his senior international debut for Malta on 25 March, replacing Jean Paul Farrugia in the 60th minute of a 0\u20132 friendly defeat against Georgia at the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium in Tbilisi. On 8 June, he came on for Andrew Cohen in the 60th minute of a home friendly against Lithuania, and 20 minutes later scored his first international goal to seal a 2\u20130 victory. He scored his second national goal in a 1\u20131 draw against Estonia in August 2016. His third goal came from a header against Scotland in Malta's 5\u20131 home defeat in a World Cup qualifier on 4 September 2016. ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Malta's goal tally first. {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !Goal!!Date!!Venue!!Opponent!!Score!!Result!!Competition |- || 1. || 8 June 2015 || Ta' Qali National Stadium, Attard, Malta || || align=center | 2\u20130 || align=center | 2\u20130 || Friendly |- || 2. || 6 September 2015 || Ta' Qali National Stadium, Attard, Malta || || align=center | 2\u20131 || align=center | 2\u20132 || UEFA Euro 2016 qualification |- || 3. || 31 August 2016 || P\u00e4rnu Rannastaadion, P\u00e4rnu, Estonia || || align=center | 1\u20131 || align=center | 1\u20131 || Friendly |- || 4. || 4 September 2016 || Ta' Qali National Stadium, Attard, Malta || || align=center | 1\u20131 || align=center | 1\u20135 || 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification |} ==Honours== ;Valletta *Maltese Premier League: 2011\u201312 *Maltese Super Cup: 2011 ==References== == External links == * https://www.national-football-teams.com/player/58681/Alfred_Effiong.html Category:Living people Category:1984 births Category:Association football forwards Category:Maltese footballers Category:Malta international footballers Category:Nigerian footballers Category:Nigerian emigrants to Malta Category:Balzan F.C. players Category:Qormi F.C. players Category:Marsaxlokk F.C. players Category:Valletta F.C. players Category:Maltese Premier League players Category:Nigerian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Malta Category:Nigerian expatriate sportspeople in Malta ",
