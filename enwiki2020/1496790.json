Distributed by Strand Releasing. It is an anthology of short films about unrequited love. Director Eytan Fox returned to similar subject matter in his full-length Yossi & Jagger (2002); filmmaker Michael Burke expanded \"Fishbelly White\" into the full-length film The Mudge Boy (2003); and Adam Salky (director) (along with original writer David Brind) expanded and remade Dare into a full-length feature film, also entitled Dare (2009). Boys Life 5 consists of the following segments: * Fishbelly White \"Fishbelly White\" chronicles the rural isolation of childlike Duncan (Mickey Smith), who's been lonely since his mother's death. Because his care-worn father ignores him, Duncan befriends the farm animals and adopts a chicken as his pet. Abused by his own father, an older adolescent named Perry (Jason Hayes) takes a shine to the outcast. Proclaiming they aren't gay, Duncan and Perry suppress a mutual attraction that would outrage Perry's macho friends. Directed by Michael Burke. * Late Summer (2001; Director/Writer: David Ottenhouse) \"Late Summer\" deals with the sort of unspecified childhood crush that both gays and straights have experienced. After his parents die in a car crash, Adam goes to live with an aunt and uncle; Adam's popular cousin Josh (Chris Nee) takes him under his wing. Responding to this all-American teen's guidance, the sheltered Adam learns how to skateboard and use a still-camera. Frozen in time, one picture celebrates how Josh lives on in his younger cousin's heart. Directed by David Ottenhouse. * Time Off \"Time Off\" offers viewers a tour of duty with Israeli soldiers during the First Lebanon War, in 1982. In a bivouac, sensitive Yonatan (Hanoch Re'im) wonders why gung-ho Lieutenant Erez (Gil Frank) picks on him.

Directed by Eytan Fox. * Dare (2005; Director/Writer: Adam Salky/David Brind) In \"Dare,\" Ben (Adam Fleming), a teenage techie, shines a spotlight on Johnny (Michael Cassidy), a jock stumbling through the lead in the school play.
