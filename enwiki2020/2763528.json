    "text": "The Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (; ), or, in short, the Karelian ASSR (; ), sometimes referred to as Soviet Karelia or simply Karelia was an autonomous republic of the Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, with the capital in Petrozavodsk. The Karelian ASSR was formed as a part of the Russian SFSR by the Resolution of the Presidium of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) of June 27, 1923 and by the Decree of the VTsIK and the Council of People's Commissars of July 25, 1923 from the Karelian Labor Commune.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 31 In 1927, the ASSR was divided into districts,Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 35 which replaced the old volosts. From 1940 to 1956, territory annexed from Finland (which had briefly constituted a puppet Finnish Democratic Republic) was incorporated with the previous Karelian Autonomous Republic to form the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, which had the status of a union republic in the federal structure of the Soviet Union. However, by this time, only a small portion of the population of this region was of Karelian or Finnish ethnic background. Some later historians believe that this unorthodox upgrade was likely a \"convenient means for facilitating the possible incorporation of additional Finnish territory\" (or all of Finland) or \"at least a way to keep Finland continuously under the gun\". On July 16, 1956, the SSR was downgraded from a Union Republic to an ASSR, and retroceded to the Russian SFSR. Beginning on August 9, 1990, the Karelian ASSR declared state sovereignty and renamed to the Karelian Soviet Socialist Republic (; ). The Karelian SSR was renamed to the Republic of Karelia on November 13, 1991 and remains a federal subject of Russia. ==Administration== ===Chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet=== *Aleksandr Vasilevich Shotman (25 June 1923 - 1924) *Aleksandr Fyodorovich (December 1924 - May 1928) *Nikolay Aleksandrovich Yushchyev (January 1929 - 13 January 1934) *Vasiliy Petrovich Averkyev (13 January 1934 - 1935) *Nikolay Vasilyevich Arkhipov (February 1935 - November 1937) *Mark Vasilyevich Gorbachev (November 1937 - 31 March 1940) *Pavel Stepanovich Prokkonen (16 July 1956 - 18 July 1979) *N.
