    "text": "Old Boyfriends is a 1979 American drama film directed by Joan Tewkesbury and written by Paul Schrader and Leonard Schrader. The film stars Talia Shire, Richard Jordan, Keith Carradine, John Belushi, John Houseman and Buck Henry. The film was released on March 22, 1979, by Embassy Pictures. ==Plot== Dianne Cruise (Talia Shire) is a clinical psychologist who is suffering with an identity crisis and struggling with her marriage. In an attempt to learn about herself, Dianne goes on a road trip to reconnect with three of her old boyfriends. == Cast == *Talia Shire as Dianne Cruise *Richard Jordan as Jeff Turrin *Keith Carradine as Wayne Van Til *John Belushi as Eric Katz *John Houseman as Doctor Hoffman *Buck Henry as Art Kopple *Nina Jordan as Dylan Turrin *Gerrit Graham as Sam The Fisherman *P. J. Soles as Sandy *Bethel Leslie as Mrs. Van Til *Joan Hotchkis as Pamela Shaw *William Bassett as David Brinks *Murphy Dunne as Keyboard Player ==Production== Old Boyfriends was made without a distribution deal. The film had a cost of $2.5 million in cash and $0.5 million in deferments. David Shire, husband of Talia, scored the movie. ==Reception== Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \"a movie in which the characters are more intelligent and interesting than anything they are required to do ... The writing veers back and forth between the good and the appalling.\" Dale Pollock of Variety wrote, \"What's missing, in both the Schraders' script and Tewkesbury's direction, is a strong sense of just why Shire is trying to recapture her past, other than idle curiosity. As in other Schrader pix, the characters are carefully distanced, and only Jordan projects any real warmth.\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4 and wrote that it was \"wildly uneven\" in tone and had \"too many stories. I would have preferred that one relationship, the adult one with Richard Jordan, had been examined in greater detail. She and Jordan seem like an interesting couple. But their rapproachment is rudely severed and what follows after their first encounter appears to be dictated by psychological theory.\"Siskel, Gene (May 2, 1979). \"A fine idea, but too many 'Boyfriends' spoil the plot\". Chicago Tribune. Section 3, p. 2. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times stated, \"Despite the raucous interlude with Belushi, 'Old Boyfriends' is a quiet and well-observed romantic drama and a promising start for a directing career, revealing most particularly a gift for evoking good performances.\"Champlin, Charles (April 12, 1979). \"Backtracking to 'Boyfriends'\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote, \"In 'Old Boyfriends,' director Joan Tewkesbury and a talented cast end up hostages to an unsalvageable script.\" == References == == External links == * * Category:1979 films Category:1970s drama road movies Category:American films Category:American drama road movies Category:Embassy Pictures films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by David Shire Category:Films with screenplays by Paul Schrader Category:1979 directorial debut films Category:1979 drama films ",
