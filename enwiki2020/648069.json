    "text": "The Homestead Grays (also known as Washington Grays or Washington Homestead Grays) were a professional baseball team that played in the Negro leagues in the United States. The team was formed in 1912 by Cumberland Posey, and remained in continuous operation for 38 seasons. The team was originally based in Homestead, Pennsylvania, adjacent to Pittsburgh. By the 1920s, with increasing popularity in the Pittsburgh region, the team retained the name \"Homestead\" but crossed the Monongahela River to play all home games in Pittsburgh, at the Pittsburgh Pirates' home Forbes Field and the Pittsburgh Crawfords' home Greenlee Field. From 1940 until 1942, the Grays played half of their home games in Washington, D.C., while remaining in Pittsburgh for all other home stands. As attendance at their games in the nation's capital grew, by 1943, the Grays were playing more than two-thirds of their home games in Washington.Snyder, Brad (2003). Beyond the Shadow of the Senators: The Untold Story of the Homestead Grays and the Integration of Baseball, p. 155. McGraw- Hill. . ==Franchise history== The Grays grew out of an earlier industrial team. In 1900, a group of African-American players had joined together to form the Germantown Blue Ribbons, an industrial league team. For ten years, the Blue Ribbons fielded a team every season and played some of the best sandlot teams in the area. In 1910, the managers of the team retired. The players reorganized the team and named themselves the Murdock Grays. In 1912, they became the Homestead Grays, the name they retained for the remainder of the franchise's history. 1913 Homestead Grays.

Cumberland Posey Jr is standing at far left ===American Negro League=== The Grays did join the American Negro League in 1929, but that league lasted only one season. The team operated independently again until 1932, when Posey organized the ill-fated East-West League; that league also collapsed before completing its first and only season. ===Negro National League=== Posey entered his Grays in the Negro National League in 1935. With the near-collapse of the Pittsburgh Crawfords, Josh Gibson returned to the Grays in 1937, combining with slugger Buck Leonard to power the Grays to nine consecutive (and a total of ten) Negro National League Championships and three Negro League World Series titles. Vic Harris managed the Grays during their years in league play, between 1935 and 1948, and piloted Homestead to eight pennants. He guided his team to six consecutive pennants from 1937 through 1942; in 1945 and 1948, and led the 1948 team to the Negro League World Series championship. The 1943 and 1944 NLWS titles came under Candy Jim Taylor. ====Art Rooney==== Pittsburgh Steelers founder and owner Art Rooney related in a 1981 interview that he \"from time to time\" had \"helped financially support the Negro League team, the Homestead Grays, and . . . was a better baseball fan than football fan.\" ===Post-Negro league play=== Following the collapse of the Negro National League after the 1948 season, the Grays struggled to continue as an independent club, and ultimately disbanded in May 1951. ==Home fields== From the late 1930s through the 1940s, the Grays played their home games at Pittsburgh's Forbes Field, home of the Pittsburgh Pirates. However, during this same period the club adopted the Washington, D.C. area as its \"home away from home\" and scheduled many of its \"home\" games at D.C.'s Griffith Stadium, the home park of the Washington Senators. During these games, they were alternatively known as the Washington Grays or Washington Homestead Grays. ==Baseball Hall of Fame inductees== These Homestead Grays alumni have been inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center |- ! colspan=5 style=\"\"|Homestead Grays Hall of Famers |- ! style=\"\"|No. ! style=\"\"|Inductee ! style=\"\"|Position ! style=\"\"|Tenure ! style=\"\"|Inducted |- | 4 || Cool Papa Bell || OF || 1932, 1943\u20131946 || 1974 |- | \u2014 || Ray Brown || P || 1937\u20131945 1947\u20131948 || 2006 |- | \u2014 || Oscar Charleston || OF || 1930\u20131931 || 1976 |- | \u2014 || Mart\u00edn Dihigo || P || 1927\u20131928 || 1977 |- | \u2014 || Bill Foster || P || 1931 || 1996 |- | 20 || Josh Gibson || C || 1930\u20131931 1937\u20131946 || 1972 |- | \u2014 || Judy Johnson || 3B || 1930, 1937 || 1975 |- | 32 || Buck Leonard || 1B || 1934\u20131950 || 1972 |- | \u2014 || Cum Posey || Founder- Owner || 1912\u20131946 || 2006 |- | \u2014 || Willie Wells || SS || 1932 || 1997 |- | \u2014 || Smokey Joe Williams || P || 1925\u20131932 || 1999 |- | \u2014 || Jud Wilson || 3B || 1929\u20131931 1941\u20131946 || 2006 |} ==Legacy== On July 11, 2002, the Homestead High-Level Bridge which connects Pittsburgh to Homestead over the Monongahela River at Homestead was renamed the Homestead Grays Bridge in honor of the team.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, \"Homestead Span Honors Baseball Team\", July 12, 2002 ===Washington Nationals=== When the Montreal Expos moved to Washington, \"Grays\" was one of the three finalists (along with \"Senators\" and the eventual winner \"Nationals\") for the relocated team's new name, reflecting Washington's baseball history.USA Today, \"In Washington, it'll be 'Let's go Nats'\", November 22, 2004.
