In its heyday, the town had a saw mill, a blacksmith shop, a cabinet shop, and a general store. When the Pan Handle Railroad was built in Miami County, it was not extended to Snow Hill, and the community became a ghost town. ==References== Category:Geography of Miami County, Indiana Category:Former populated places in Indiana Category:Ghost towns in Indiana ",
