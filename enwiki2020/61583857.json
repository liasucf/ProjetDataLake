    "text": "Mathylde Frontus is a member of the New York State Assembly, representing the 46th district since 2018. She is a Democrat. The district includes portions of southern Brooklyn, including Coney Island, Brighton Beach, Bay Ridge and Dyker Heights. Prior to elected office Frontus was well known as a community organizer in southwestern Brooklyn, including as the founder of Urban Neighborhood Services. She received the Characters Unite Award from NBCUniversal for that work in 2014. She is a graduate of New York University, Teachers College, Columbia University (Ph.D.) and Harvard Divinity School. Frontus is of Haitian descent. In 2018, Assembly member Pamela Harris resigned her seat after allegations of fraud led to an 11-count indictment. Soon afterward, Frontus announced her candidacy for the open seat, and then won the Democratic primary election over Ethan Lustig-Elgrably by only 51 votes. In the general election, Frontus defeated Republican Steven Saperstein with 56% of the vote. In March 2020, Frontus fired a member of her staff, Marilyn Franks, a receptionist in Frontus\u2019 Coney Island district office, after Franks shared a message on Facebook that urged patrons to avoid Chinese restaurants and businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. == References == == External links == * Mathylde Frontus - New York State Assembly (official site) Category:Living people Category:Members of the New York State Assembly Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Politicians from Brooklyn Category:New York (state) Democrats Category:Teachers College, Columbia University alumni Category:New York University alumni Category:Harvard Divinity School alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
