    "text": "Golden Gaytime (Cookie Crumble in New Zealand) is a popular ice cream snack that is made and distributed by the Streets confectionery company in Australia, and first released in 1959. It is a toffee and vanilla ice cream dipped in compound chocolate, and wrapped in honeycomb biscuits on a wooden paddlepop-stick. Its name has survived intact regardless, or because, of the possible homosexual connotations in modern decades. ==Variations== On 4 August 2015, Streets announced the release of Golden Gaytime ice-cream tub format in addition to its usual popsicle stick format. On 7 September 2016, Streets announced the release of Golden Gaytime cross Cornetto cone \u2013 named Golden Gaynetto \u2013 in addition to other formats. In 2017, Streets released a Golden Gaytime ice-cream sandwich named the Golden Gaytime Sanga (\"Sanga\" being Australian slang for sandwich). In 2017, the flavours Gaytime Unicorn, Pi\u00f1a Colada and Choc Mint McMint Face were introduced. == Advertising == The company appears to embrace the camp name by retaining the tagline from the 1980s, \"It's hard to have a Gaytime on your own\". The in-home boxes feature the words \"4 delicious chances to have a gay time\". In 2009, Streets started re-airing a television commercial from the 1980s. == Cultural impact == The double meaning of the name is highlighted in The Bedroom Philosopher song, \"Golden Gaytime\". ==See also== * Unilever * Streets (ice cream) ==References== Category:Australian confectionery Category:Ice cream brands Category:Unilever brands Category:Australian brands ",
