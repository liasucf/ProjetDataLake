    "text": "Moment of Glory is an album by German hard rock band Scorpions. It was recorded in collaboration with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and released in 2000. The album features re-arranged songs from the Scorpions repertoire, as well as classical interludes, a cover song and the new single \"Moment of Glory\". Initially, English composer Andrew Powell was asked to provide arrangements and Michael Kamen was designated next for the orchestral material. After the latter gave up the job in order to work with Metallica for their album S&M;, finally the Austrian arranger and conductor Christian Kolonovits proved to be the right collaborator.Michael Custodis, chapter: Moment of Glory - The Scorpions und die Berliner Philharmoniker, in: Klassische Musik heute. Eine Spurensuche in der Rockmusik, Bielefeld transcript-Verlag 2009 == Live performances == The Moment of Glory concert programme was first presented at the Hannover EXPO in June 2000, with Christian Kolonovits conducting the Berlin Philharmonic. The live performance was filmed to be released in VHS and Video CD in December 2000. In 2001, this rock-symphonic show was taken on a seven-city tour to Russia and the Baltic countries. Christian Kolonovits and Scott Lawton alternated as orchestra conductors. == Track notes == \"Hurricane 2000\", the reworking of \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\", was the official theme song to Sabres Hockey Network broadcasts. The title track \"Moment of Glory\" was the official anthem of the EXPO 2000 in Hannover, Germany. The instrumental \"Deadly Sting Suite\" is based on two earlier Scorpions tracks, \"He's a Woman, She's a Man\" and \"Dynamite\". The fifth track \"Crossfire\" repeats the main theme of the Russian song \"Moscow Nights\". \"Here in My Heart\", written by Diane Warren, was recorded by Tiffany 10 years earlier for her album New Inside. The 5.1 surround mix on the SACD release includes an orchestra-only version of \"Wind of Change\" as a ghost track, which follows after approximately one minute of silence at the end of \"Lady Starlight\". == Track listings == ===Album=== ===Video=== ==Personnel== ===Scorpions=== * Klaus Meine \u2013 lead vocals * Matthias Jabs \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals * Rudolf Schenker \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals * Ralph Rieckermann \u2013 bass, backing vocals (on video version only) * James Kottak \u2013 drums, backing vocals * The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra ===Guest musicians on CD=== * Lyn Liechty \u2013 vocals on \"Here in My Heart\" * Ray Wilson \u2013 vocals on \"Big City Nights\" * Zucchero \u2013 vocals on \"Send Me an Angel\" * Guenther Becker - sitar on \"Lady Starlight\" * Ken Taylor \u2013 bass * Stefan Schrupp - drum and computer programming * Gumpoldtskirchener Spatzen, Vienna - children's choir on \"Moment of Glory\" * Vince Pirillo, Kai Petersen, Michael Perfler - choir on \"Moment of Glory\" * Susie Webb, Zo\u00eb Nicholas, Rita Campbell, Melanie Marshall - backing vocals ===Guest musicians on VHS=== * Lyn Liechty \u2013 vocals on \"Here in My Heart\" * Ray Wilson \u2013 vocals on \"Big City Nights\" ===CD production=== *Christian Kolonovits - producer, arrangements, conductor *Hartmut Pfannm\u00fcller - engineer, mixing *Joerg Steinfad, Martin Boehm, Rory Kushnen, Gert Jacobs, Mirko Bezzi - engineers *Ian Cooper - mastering ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2000) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japanese Albums (Oricon) | 100 |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2000) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) | 63 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\"|Year !align=\"center\"|Title !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=2|2000 |align=\"center\"|\"Moment of Glory\" |align=\"center\"|German Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|67 |- |align=\"center\"|\"Here in My Heart\" |align=\"center\"|UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|91 |} == Certifications == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |Country |Organization |Year |Sales |- |Germany |BVMI |2000 |Gold (+ 150,000) |- |Canada |CRIA |2004 (DVD) |Gold (+ 5,000) |- |} == References == ==External links== * Official album page * Official DVD page * \"Moment of Glory\" video * \"Hurricane 2000\" video * \"Here in My Heart\" video Category:2000 albums Category:Scorpions (band) albums Category:EMI Classics albums Category:2000 video albums Category:Scorpions (band) video albums Category:Live video albums ",
