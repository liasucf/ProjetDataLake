    "text": "Patrick Thomas \"Paddy\" Noonan (4 September 1875 \u2013 27 January 1935) was an Australian rules footballer who played for the Fitzroy Football Club and Carlton Football Club in the Victorian Football League. A small rover, Noonan played in Fitzroy's inaugural VFL season in 1897 and then their inaugural premiership side the following year. In 1901 he crossed to Carlton and spent two seasons with the Blues. Noonan spent the rest of his career in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) where he captained North Melbourne to premierships in 1903 and 1904. Noonan also spent some time playing at fellow VFA side Williamstown Football Club. Following North Melbourne's entry to the VFL, Noonan was appointed coach in 1929, where North Melbourne finished last, with their only win coming against Footscray. Noonan remains the oldest first- time coach in VFL/AFL history. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1875 births Category:Fitzroy Football Club players Category:Carlton Football Club players Category:Williamstown Football Club players Category:North Melbourne Football Club (VFA) players Category:North Melbourne Football Club coaches Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:1935 deaths ",
