    "text": "The New Zealand Republican Party of 1967 was a political party which campaigned for the creation of a New Zealand republic. It was founded by Bruce Jesson in 1967, and was linked to the Republican Association. It did not win any seats in Parliament, and was dissolved in 1974. Later, another party, which was also subsequently dissolved, arose under the same name. The two are, however, unconnected. ==See also== * Republicanism in New Zealand * Republican Association of New Zealand * Bruce Jesson Category:Political parties established in 1967 Category:Defunct political parties in New Zealand Category:Republican parties Category:Republicanism in New Zealand ",
