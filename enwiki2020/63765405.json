(2020). * Fossil oothecae produced by dictyopteran insects, representing the earliest fossil evidence of oothecae reported so far, are described from the Upper Triassic (Carnian) Potrerillos Formation (Argentina) by Cariglino, Lara & Zavattieri (2020), who name new ichnotaxa Oothecichnus pensilis and Oothecichnus duraznensis. * Revision of the cicadomorph genera Ipsvicia and Ipsviciopsis from the Upper Triassic Blackstone Formation (Australia) is published by Lambkin (2020). * 100-million-year-old sweat bee nests, representing the oldest evidence of crown bees reported so far, are described from the Castillo Formation (Argentina) by Genise et al. (2020). * A single worker of Ceratomyrmex ellenbergeri preserved restraining a Caputoraptor elegans nymph is described from the Cretaceous Burmese amber by Barden, Perrichot & Wang (2020), who argue that the aberrant morphology of fossil haidomyrmecine \"hell ants\" (scythe-like mouthparts and horn-like cephalic projections) was an adaptation for prey capture. * Evidence of polymorphism within worker caste of ants belonging to the species Zigrasimecia ferox is presented by Cao et al. (2020). * A study comparing the relative lengths of legs of ants from Baltic amber (Formica flori and members of the genus Cataglyphoides) and extant ants belonging to the genera Cataglyphis and Formica will be published by Wehner, Rabenstein & Habersetzer (2020), who report that the Cataglyphoides data are fully in accord with the Cataglyphis pattern of the leg-to-body length relationships, and discuss evolutionary implications of their findings. * A snakefly larva with a very prominent, leg-sized antenna is described from the Cretaceous Burmese amber by Haug, M\u00fcller & Haug (2020), who discuss the implications of this specimen for the knowledge of the early evolution and diversification of snakeflies. * Three neuropteran larvae with straight mandibulomaxillary stylets, representing some of the oldest straight-jawed neuropteran larvae reported so far, are described from the Aptian amber from Spain by P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente et al. (2020). * A study on the morphology and phylogenetic relationships of the mysteriomorphid beetles, based on data from new specimens from the Cretaceous Burmese amber, is published by Peris et al.
