    "text": "Lead(II) hydroxide, Pb(OH)2, is a hydroxide of lead, with lead in oxidation state +2. It is doubtful that such a simple compound exists. Lead basic carbonate (PbCO3\u00b72Pb(OH)2) or lead(II) oxide (PbO) is encountered in practice where lead hydroxide is expected. This has been a subject of considerable confusion in the past. ==Preparation== When a hydroxide is added to a solution of a lead(II) salt, a hydrated lead oxide PbO\u00b7xH2O (with x < 1) is obtained. Careful hydrolysis of lead(II) acetate solution yields a crystalline product with a formula 6PbO\u00b72H2O = Pb6O4(OH)4.Von Egon Wiberg, Nils Wiberg, Arnold Frederick Holleman, \"Inorganic Chemistry\", Academic Press, 2001 (Google books). This material is a cluster compound, consisting of an octahedron of Pb centers, each face of which is capped by an oxide or a hydroxide. The structure is reminiscent of the Mo6S8 subunit of the Chevrel phases. ==Reactions== In solution, lead(II) hydroxide is a somewhat weak base, forming lead(II) ion, Pb2+, under weakly acidic conditions. This cation hydrolyzes and, under progressively increasing alkaline conditions, forms Pb(OH)+, Pb(OH)2(aqueous), Pb(OH)3\u2212, and other species, including several polynuclear species, e.g., Pb4(OH)44+, Pb3(OH)42+, Pb6O(OH)64+. ==Lead hydrate== The name Lead hydrate has sometimes been used in the past but it is unclear whether this refers to Pb(OH)2 or PbO\u00b7xH2O.https://www.google.com/patents/US527830https://www.google.com/patents/US496109 ==References== ==External links== * Case Studies in Environmental Medicine - Lead Toxicity * ToxFAQs: Lead * National Pollutant Inventory - Lead and Lead Compounds Fact Sheet Category:Hydroxides Category:Lead(II) compounds ",
