    "text": "Alfa Pendular is the name of the Pendolino high-speed tilting train of Portuguese state railway company CP.S\u00e9rie 4000: CP official website It connects the cities of Guimar\u00e3es, Braga, Porto, Aveiro, Coimbra, Santar\u00e9m, Lisbon, Albufeira and Faro, among others at speeds of up to . The trains were assembled in Portugal by ADtranz at the former Sorefame works at Amadora, based on contracting partnership between Fiat-Ferroviaria as the main contractor and ADtranz and Siemens as the main subcontractors. Beginning 2017, the trains were refurbished, introducing new interiors, livery, seating and features such as Wi-Fi and power outlets. == Description == The Alfa Pendular high speed train is a six car electric multiple unit (EMU), which is derived from and closely resembles the Giugiaro designed Italian Fiat-Ferroviaria ETR 480 Pendolino train. The bogies had to be redesigned to operate on Portugal's track. There are 8 traction motors, installed on all but the two middle vehicles of the train, developing . This M-M-T-T-M-M arrangement spreads the weight of the train, giving it a weight of only per axle, which helps its cornering ability at high speed. During testing, a top speed of was reached close to Espinho in 1998. === Tilting technology === Its tilting train technology, with a maximum tilt angle of 8\u00b0, allows the train to negotiate curves at higher speeds than conventional trains. The combination of the resulting high cornering velocity and the tilting movement of the carriages helps ensure a comfortable ride for the passengers, although the jostle and sway compensating for track irregularities may cause \"travel sickness\" in those susceptible. The hydraulic tilting system is governed by two gyroscopes in the head cars. The curve is found on the base of the elevation of the external track. The use of this train did not require particular modifications to the existing rail network, but it is expensive in terms of maintenance of the rolling stock because of the complexity of the tilting system. == Stations == The stations served by the Alfa Pendular are from north to south:Comboios de Portugal > Alfa Pendular > Esta\u00e7\u00f5es *Braga *Guimar\u00e3es *Famalic\u00e3o *Trofa *Porto-Campanh\u00e3 *Vila Nova de Gaia *Espinho *Aveiro *Coimbra-B *Pombal *Entroncamento *Santar\u00e9m *Lisboa-Oriente *Lisboa-Santa Apol\u00f3nia (off the lines from/to Faro) *Lisboa-Entrecampos *Pinhal Novo *Tunes *Albufeira *Loul\u00e9 *Faro Old first class carriage on the Oporto - Lisbon service. == See also == * List of high speed trains == References == == External links == * CP 4000 @ Trainspo Category:Pendolino Category:Tilting trains Category:High-speed rail in Portugal Category:Electric multiple units of Portugal Category:Fiat Ferroviaria ",
