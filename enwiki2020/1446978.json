The party ran in the 2006 elections to the Knesset on a joint list with Professor Paul Eidelberg's Yamin Yisrael party, but received less than the 2% minimum number of votes required to pass the threshold to receive representation. Baruch Marzel was a senior activist for Kach, the most right-wing stream of religious nationalism in Israel, though Marzel was number two on Kleiner's Herut list for the 2003 Knesset elections. In 2008, prior to the elections for the 18th Knesset, the party merged with Eretz Yisrael Shelanu, which, in turn, joined with the larger National Union party. Jewish National Front representative Michael Ben-Ari was given the fourth spot on the list, and subsequently won a seat in the 18th Knesset in 2009. This marks the first time the Jewish National Front enjoyed Knesset representation. ==Position== The party calls for a change in the country's electoral system so that Knesset members represent constituencies, rather than being elected on a party list system, as well as switching to a presidential system of government.Hazit: The Jewish National Front -- By Prof. Paul Eidelberg GalileeBlog, 7 December 2005 It also supports preserving Israel as a Jewish state by increasing Jewish immigration, limiting immigration of people who are not Jews according to Halakha, and strengthening Jewish education in public schools, and is against territorial compromise, citing the stance of Rabbi Chaim Zimmerman, who wrote a halakhic discourse entitled \"The Prohibition of Abandoning Land in Eretz Yisrael\". == Election results == 2006 election {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center !
