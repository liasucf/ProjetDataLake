It is situated between Quebec Route 136 to the south and the College of Jesus and Mary of Sillery to the north, and is part of the Sillery Heritage Site in the borough of Sainte-Foy\u2013Sillery\u2013Cap-Rouge. Although the current church was built in 1852, and originally dedicated to the Irish Saint Columba, the parish was founded in 1644, with a chapel constructed on the same site by the Jesuits. ==History== Maison des J\u00e9suites-de-Sillery, the house of the Jesuits, near the church Joseph-Ferdinand Peachy, architect of the church ===Foundation=== In 1637, the Jesuits arrived in New France, and founded a mission in the area. They built the mission Saint-Joseph de Sillery, to minister to the local First Nations population. They named their mission after Saint Joseph. In 1644, they built a chapel, dedicated to Saint Michael, for the French and First Nations peoples on a promontory in Sillery known as pointe \u00e0 Puiseaux. The Jesuits left in the late 1600s.\"On the Promontory of Pointe \u00e0 Puiseaux\" from Saint-Michel de Sillery Church: History and Works of Art Until 1847, the local Catholic population had to travel to Sainte-Foy or Quebec City to attend Mass. That year, a local timber merchant, Patrick McInenly, had his house converted into a place of worship, St. Richard's Chapel. Later, with the congregation increasing, it was decided to build a church on the site of the first chapel. ===Construction=== Construction on the church began in 1852, utilizing the plans of the Irish-born architect Goodlatte Richardson Browne. In 1853, Joseph-Ferdinand Peachy took over as architect. The church opened for worship in 1854. The French form of the name, Colomb, was adopted by canonical decree in 1855. The following year, both the municipality and the parish took on the name St Columba of Sillery (St Colomb de Sillery, for the francophones). In 1880, the bell tower was completed and a spire was added according to Peachy's designs.St-Michel de Sillery Church from Patrimoine-religieux.com, retrieved 31 May 2015 ===Developments=== When the church was opened, most of the work on the interior had not started. This work began in October 1866 and was based on Browne's designs. Peachy supervised the work and Jean V\u00e9zina crafted the wooden decor and Maurice Larose did the masonry. In 1945, the Gothic Revival interior was changed during a renovation. The gold and white wooden altar was moved to the sacristy and a brown granite one from Chicoutimi was installed in its place.\u00c9glise de Saint-Michel-de- Sillery from \u00c9glises de Qu\u00e9bec, retrieved 1 June 2015 The choir stalls were removed and a wooden balustrade was replaced by a communion table made of iron.
