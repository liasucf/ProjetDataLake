His father, Ami Bost, was also a Pastor. He learned the piano with Franz Liszt. In 1840, he gave up his musical career and he became Pastor in La Force, village of the Dordogne valley of France. In 1846, he inaugurated the new temple and decided to build the Asylum of his dreams by the temple. 'La Famille' (the Family) was inaugurated on May 24, 1848. It was immediately made available to children, orphans, disabled, incurables. He created 9 asylums during his life. In 1861, he married Eug\u00e9nie Ponterie. The Asylum has since flourished to become the John Bost Foundation where over 1000 people with a wide variety of disabilities live. ==External links== *John Bost Foundation *Establishments of John Bost at Laforce, The Romance of Charity by John De Liefde (1867) *John Bost, Pastor and Philanthropist, The Quiver (1883) Category:1817 births Category:1881 deaths Category:People from the Bernese Jura Category:Swiss Calvinist and Reformed Christians Category:French Calvinist and Reformed ministers Category:Swiss pianists Category:19th-century pianists ",
