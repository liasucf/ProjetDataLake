It was launched on 4 September 2019 and returned for a second series on 8 January 2020. The show came off-air during the COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March 2020 and was then cancelled as a result of budget cuts at the BBC. == Background == Neil's long- running politics and current affairs programme This Week ended in July 2019 following his decision to \"step down from late-night broadcasting\". His lunchtime Daily Politics show ended in 2018 after 15 years. The Andrew Neil Show was first announced on 29 August 2019 in a statement from the BBC's press office. Ahead of the announcement, Rob Burley, the editor of BBC live political programmes, tweeted a teaser of the programme's logo, a superimposed 'A' and 'N'. Upon announcement, Neil said: \"I'm delighted to be fronting a weekly show in prime time on BBC Two that will be on top of the story, whatever direction it takes. The autumn of 2019 is destined to be one of the most intriguing and significant in British politics for at least a generation\". Neil continued to present Politics Live on BBC Two every Thursday lunchtime in addition to the programme. == Format == The Andrew Neil Show aired at 7 pm on Wednesdays and focused on Brexit. It rounded up political events of the week and featured interviews with key politicians. Other BBC journalists frequently appeared on the show to offer their analysis, with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg being the most frequent guest.
