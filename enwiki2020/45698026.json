An English translation by K\u00e1ri Driscoll was published in 2014. ==Reception== Publishers Weekly wrote: \"Mosebach's charming, exuberant narrator is not be trusted, and the novel calls into question our notions of memory. Mosebach's writing is florid, tinged with a biting wit. ... Irreverent, playful, and intricate, Mosebach's book is a deconstruction of how we choose to tell stories.\" ==References== ==External links== * What Was Before at the German publisher's website * What Was Before at the British publisher's website Category:2010 German novels Category:Frankfurt in fiction Category:German-language novels ",
