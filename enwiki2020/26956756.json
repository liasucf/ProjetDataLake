It houses the Str\u00f6her Collection. It is part of the Duisburg: Town and Harbour section of the Ruhr Industrial Heritage Trail. ==Architecture== Based in a former warehouse, the MKM was opened in April 1999. The building was redesigned by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron, using a masterplan devised by Norman Foster. After gutting the original industrial building an exhibition space of 3,600 m\u00b2 was created across three storeys. With 6-meter high ceilings, grey Turkish basalt natural daylight is provided by the ceiling-high window slits. The building is served by an external staircase attached to the original building. ==History of the building== The original building was erected in 1860 with extensive redevelopment between 1908\u20131916. Steel silos were added in the 1930s. In 1969he merger of Werner & Nicola Germania M\u00fchlenwerke with the K\u00fcppers M\u00fchlenwerken in Homberg gave rise to the name \"K\u00fcppersm\u00fchle\". ==References== * The MKM \u2013 Centre for Modern and Contemporary Art, accessed 14 April 2010 Category:Art museums and galleries in Germany Category:Modern art museums in Germany Museum Kuppersmuhle Category:Culture in Duisburg Category:Museums in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Art museums established in 1999 Museum Kuppersmuhle ",
