    "text": "Flavio-Shir\u00f3 (born August 27, 1928) is a Japanese-Brazilian visual artist. Regarded as an influential postwar Brazilian painter, he is known for his dark and disturbing paintings that merge elements of abstract expressionism and surrealism. He is one of the main representatives of abstract expressionism in Brazil. Born in Hokkaido, Japan and raised in the Amazon, Flavio-Shir\u00f3 spent his adult life working in Paris and Rio de Janeiro. His work has been exhibited in many countries, including Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. His paintings are also included in the permanent collections of notable museums including the Hara Museum of Contemporary Art, the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Modern Art, and the Fonds national d'art contemporain. In 2019, Flavio-Shir\u00f3 received the Order of the Rising Sun from the Emperor of Japan, the highest award conferred by the Japanese government to non-politicians, in recognition of his cultural contributions. ==Biography== Flavio-Shir\u00f3 was born in 1928 in Sapporo, on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. In 1932, he emigrated to Tom\u00e9-A\u00e7u, Brazil with his family as part of a settler agricultural mission. Flavio- Shir\u00f3\u2019s formative years were spent in the Amazon jungle, an experience that had a lasting influence on his artistic style and worldview. In 1939, he moved with his family to S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil in search of a better education and economic opportunity. In S\u00e3o Paulo, Flavio-Shir\u00f3 began his artistic training, studying at an arts and crafts school and painting movie posters for Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer. He also began to participate in group shows, joining the S\u00e3o Paulo Artists\u2019 Union and the Grupo Santa Helena, a movement of working-class modern painters. In the early 1950s, Flavio-Shir\u00f3 held his first solo exhibition in Rio de Janeiro and exhibited paintings in the first S\u00e3o Paulo Art Biennial, the second oldest art biennial in the world. In 1953, Flavio- Shir\u00f3 emigrated to Paris where he studied engraving and lithography at the Ecole nationale superieure des beaux arts and married the Romanian-Brazilian author and illustrator Beatrice Tanaka. In the 1960s, Flavio-Shir\u00f3\u2019s work shifted from abstract expressionism towards an increasingly surrealistic style featuring organic shapes and nightmarish objects inspired by his childhood in the Amazon. His artistic contributions during this period were recognized with several prestigious exhibits and awards, including the Guggenheim International Show in 1963 and the prize for painting at the second Biennale de Paris in 1961. From the 1970s through the 2010s, Flavio-Shir\u00f3\u2019s artistic production has continued. His signature style, combining abstract gestures, rich colors, and disturbing biological objects, continued to evolve, with landmark, large-scale works including Pablo (1973) and Mem\u00f3ria dos Cais (1987), which is in the permanent collection of the S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Modern Art. He received numerous awards, including the Itamaraty Award at the 1989 S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial and the Eco-Art Prize at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, and held solo exhibitions at the Hara Museum of Contemporary Art, the Niter\u00f3i Contemporary Art Museum, and the Tomie Ohtake Institute. In August 2019, in recognition of his cultural achievements, the Japanese government awarded Flavio-Shir\u00f3 the Order of the Rising Sun, the highest award offered by the Japanese government to non-politicians. == Solo Exhibitions == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Date !Place |- |1993 |Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro |- |1993 |Hara Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo |- |1993 |Museu de Arte Moderna (MAM), S\u00e3o Paulo |- |1994 |Niter\u00f3i Contemporary Art Museum, Niter\u00f3i |- |1998 |Casa das 11 Janelas, Belem |- |2008 |Centro Cultural Correios, Rio de Janeiro |- |2008 |Instituto Tomie Ohtake, S\u00e3o Paulo |- |2018 |Cultural Pinakotheke, S\u00e3o Paulo |- |2018 |Cultural Pinakotheke, Rio de Janeiro |} ==Gallery== File:Flavio Shiro Sumi VIII.jpg|\"Sumi VIII\" (1987) File:Flavio- Shiro, Navel Portrait, 1973.jpg|\"Navel Portrait\" (1973) File:Flavio-Shiro La Marseillaise.jpg|\"La Marseillaise\" (1974) File:Flavio-Shiro Pablo.jpg|\"Pablo\" (1973) ==References== ==External links== * Flavio-Shir\u00f3 Artist Website Category:1928 births Category:Brazilian people of Japanese descent Category:Brazilian artists Category:Brazilian painters Category:Japanese emigrants to Brazil Category:Naturalized citizens of Brazil Category:People from Sapporo Category:People from S\u00e3o Paulo Category:20th-century Brazilian painters Category:21st-century Brazilian painters Category:Living people ",
