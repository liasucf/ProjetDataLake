    "text": "Bucket-handle is a movement of ribs that results in change in transverse diameter of the thorax. ==Definition== One of the most important functions of ribs and diaphragm is the change in volume of thorax that helps inspiration and expiration.Drake, Richard L.; Vogl, Wayne; Tibbitts, Adam W.M. Mitchell; illustrations by Richard; Richardson, Paul (2005). Gray's anatomy for students. Philadelphia: Elsevier/Churchill Livingstone. . In general, the ribs move around two axes. As the anterior end of ribs is about 4 cm lower than the posterior end, the middle part of rib is lower than anterior and posterior ends. Movement at costovertebral joints 7 to 10 about an anteroposterior axis results in raising and lowering the middle of the rib, the Bucket-handle movement. In elevation, this increases the transverse diameter of the thorax. ==See also== * Pump handle movement ==References== Category:Thorax (human anatomy) Category:Respiration ",
