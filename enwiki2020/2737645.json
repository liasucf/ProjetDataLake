Bosden was one of the eight civil parishes of Cheshire to be included in the Stockport rural sanitary district in 1875. From 1894 it formed part of the Stockport Rural District. In 1900 the parish was abolished and it instead became part of the Hazel Grove and Bramhall civil parish and urban district. Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District was abolished in 1974 and as Bosden Farm, the area has since formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport in Greater Manchester. == Schools == As of 2004 there is now only one Primary school after the closure of St. Stephens Church of England Primary School. This is Warren Wood Primary School which was built in 1981 just a few hundred metres away from the shopping precinct on Turnstone Road. It serves as an active part of the community, providing local education to the pupils in the area and also holding public events and gatherings in the main hall and grounds. ==References== Category:Areas of Stockport ",
