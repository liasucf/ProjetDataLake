    "text": "is a Japanese isekai light novel series written by Reia, featuring artwork by Futaba Hazuki. The series was initially self-published on Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d starting on February 7, 2015 and Fujimi Shobo began publishing a light novel version in November of the same year. The web novelization ended on September 3, 2017 and the final light novel was released in December 2018. A manga adaptation by the same name was released through Young Ace UP, the free web comic magazine of Young Ace, starting on December 22, 2015 and is currently being released in English by Seven Seas Entertainment. The author has released several spin-off series as web novels. ==Plot== A young Japanese office lady is killed in a vehicular accident. After losing consciousness, she awakens in another world in the body of Iris, the antagonist of an otome game she had been playing before her demise. To her shock, she discovers that she has reincarnated at the exact moment where Iris' former fianc\u00e9, Prince Edward, confronts her in front of the entire school over her bullying of Yuri, the illegitimate daughter of a baron and the game's heroine. Thinking fast, Iris manages to leave the school with her dignity intact and upon returning home, is also able to avoid being sent to a nunnery, the fate of the original Iris. Impressed by her rational thinking, Iris's father Duke Louis de Armelia leaves her in control of the Armelia fief in place of her brother Bern, who is one of Edward's supporters and is also in love with Yuri. As the series progresses, Iris uses her her previous life's knowledge to bring about major, positive changes to her fief and the kingdom, such as the concept of banking and schooling for commoners who would otherwise not receive education. She also introduces commercial products that had not previously existed or were only available in a crude form, such as chocolate and cosmetics, going so far as to start her own successful corporation. This brings both positive and negative attention to Iris, her family, and the fief, especially as it angers Prince Edward, who wanted her to be severely punished. It's also shown that Iris was not responsible for all of the bullying claimed by Yuri, as she had only spread rumors and made negative comments, and that Iris was a far kinder person than the one portrayed in the game's storyline. Furthermore, Yuri's personality is shown to possibly be a facade. It is also hinted that she is a foreign spy sent to disrupt the kingdom and that she is purposefully draining the kingdom's finances via Edward under the guise of charity in order to weaken it against an impending invasion. Iris finds herself and her family stuck in the middle of a succession crisis over the throne, as there is a vocal faction of people who support Edward's older brother Alfred, who is reported to be traveling to gain more support as well as to avoid assassination by his stepmother, the mother of Edward. ==Characters== ===Almeria family, servants, and employees=== *Iris Lana Almeria: She is the first daughter of the Duke and Prime Minister, Louis de Armelia. The in-game version of Iris was portrayed as a villain who was sent to a nunnery as a result of her actions. The real version of Iris is shown to be more generous and kind, as she has gone out of her way to rescue several children from dying in abject poverty and giving them jobs as servants in her mansion. Although she has managed to prevent herself from being sent to a nunnery, Iris was still expelled from school and sent to her home fief, where she serves as its acting lord due to her brother's support of Edward's actions. *Bern Tashi Almeria: Iris's brother, Bern was a love interest in the otome game. He was present when Edward confronted Iris and supported his actions, going so far as to publicly denounce her as well. These actions cost him much of his parents' respect and as a result Iris is appointed as the acting lord instead of him. He is initially indignant and resentful of his father's actions but comes to respect his sister after witnessing the amount of time and hard work she has put into the job. This, along with a scolding from his father for neglecting his responsibilities, also causes Bern to see Yuri in a different light after she suggests dismantling the military force in order to fund meals for the poor. He then begins to support his sister and family, his love for Yuri destroyed. *Duke Louis de Armelia: Iris's father and the Prime Minister. He supports the royal family and gives them advice. He was against Iris marrying Edward because it would give them too much political power and put their family at risk. *Merellis Reiser Armelia: Iris's mother, she helps support Iris's business ventures and is a major person of influence and power in social circles. *Tanya: Iris's personal maid, she almost starved to death as a child due to her being a poverty-stricken orphan. Due to Iris rescuing her and nursing her back to health, as well as giving her a secure position within the Almeria household, she is completely loyal to her mistress. *Lyle: Iris's bodyguard. *Dida: Iris's bodyguard. *Rehme: Librarian of the Almeria family library. *Sebastian: Head butler. *Moneda: *Sei: Iris's Footman. *Merida: Iris's Family's Chef. ===Royal family=== *Prince Alfred of Tasmeria/Dean: He is the first prince of Tasmeria. He was not present in the otome game but was mentioned. Some of his supporters want him to ascend the throne, as they view Edward as too much of a liability to trust with that much power. The prince spends much of his time away from the royal capital due to the risk of being assassinated by his step-mother, who views both him and his little sister (who were birthed by the first queen) as a threat to their half-brother Edward's ability to rule. He spends much of his time under the alias of Dean and working for Iris, who he eventually comes to love. *Prince Edward of Tasmeria: Iris's former fianc\u00e9, Edward's in-game portrayal is in sharp contrast to his real personality, which is hot-headed and impulsive. This causes many to see him as a poor choice for king, as they believe that he is incapable of making wise decisions for the kingdom. These fears are exacerbated by his relationship with Yuri, as he is blind to the fact that Yuri's spending, along with that of the Queen, has almost completely drained the kingdom's finances. His hatred of Iris is also a factor, as he is willing to alienate and even destroy her duchy to seek retribution, which would have lasting negative repercussions for the entire kingdom and put them at risk. *Princess Leticia of Tasmeria: She is Alfred's sister and Edward's half-sister. *Queen Ellia Tasmenia: Edward's mother and the step-mother of Alfred and his younger sister Leticia. It is implied in the series that she caused the death of the first queen so she could take her place. *Dowager Queen Arya Von Tasmeria: She is the grandmother of Alfred, Edward, and Leticia. She supports Alfred as the next king, as she is unconvinced that Edward would make a wise ruler. The Dowager Queen has an extremely strong political and social presence. *King Tasmenia: He is absent for much of the series as he is in poor health. ===Other nobles=== *Van Lutasha: The son of the current Pope and one of the capturable love interests in the game, Van is infatuated with Yuri. *Dorsen Katabelia: The son of the commander of the Royal Guards, Dorsen is another love interests in the game. He is initially infatuated with Yuri but becomes disillusioned with her over time. *Yuri Neuer: She is the main character in the game, where she is portrayed as an honest and innocent young lady. In the series this is shown to be an act as she was actually sent by Tasmenia's enemies to serve as a spy and to disrupt the kingdom from the inside so that it could be conquered. She is the illegitimate daughter of a baron and grew up in poverty, which is her reason for disliking the kingdom of Tasmenia and trying to cause its downfall. ==Media== ===Web novelization=== Accomplishments of the Duke's Daughter was initially self-published through the novel publishing website Sh\u014dsetsuka ni Nar\u014d.
