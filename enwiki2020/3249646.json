    "text": "eBags is an online retailer of handbags, luggage, backpacks, laptop bags, and travel accessories that was founded in Greenwood Village, Colorado near Denver. The pure-play e-retailer was recognized by traditional retailers as a survivor of the dot-bomb crash in addition to the September 11 terrorist attacks which dramatically slowed travel product sales in 2001. Before being acquired for $105 million by Samsonite in 2017, the main website, eBags.com, carried bags and accessories from more than 650 brands. eBags also operated the eBags Corporate Sales site and offered its own private label products under the name The eBags Brand. During 2020, eBags stopped selling brands not owned by Samsonite. As of September 2020, eBags.com retailed products from 5 brands: eBags private label brand, Samsonite, American Tourister, Hartmann, and High Sierra. == History == Jon Nordmark, Peter Cobb, Frank Steed, Andy Youngs, and Eliot Cobb founded eBags in the late spring of 1998. The website eBags.com launched on March 1, 1999 with seven brands including Samsonite, JanSport, and Skyway luggage. The focus was primarily on luggage due to the backgrounds of the founders, four of which worked previously at Samsonite. From summer 1999, eBags' starting experiencing rapid growth. eBags drop- shipped most products direct from manufacturers to consumers. In addition to lower inventory costs, eBags lowered operating costs by outsourcing their call center outsourced to the Philippines, although today it is back in the U.S. The company also focused on garnering customer reviews which was a relatively new concept in e-commerce in 1999. eBags' growth slowed following the \"dot com bomb\" of 2000, the recession of 2001, and the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. eBags won \"Website of the Year\" from The I.Merchant Awards competition, sponsored by Catalog Age, in 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2006. In 2001, Multichannel Merchant wrote, \"in the wake of scores of highly publicized flameouts ... (I.Merchant) ... recognizes those online marketers that are helping to establish \u2014 and surpass \u2014 the standards of the still-fledgling medium.\" In 2004, winners were selected from more than 200 entries. In October 2004, eBags launched eBags.co.uk with the intent of expanding further into Europe at a later time. The eBags UK offices were located in Cambridge, England. That year marked eBags' expansion of its brand representation to more than 600 total in the United States and Europe. eBags.co.uk was later closed in December 2008 and the company focus returned to growing the main site, eBags.com. By the end of 2008, eBags passed $100 million in annual gross orders. In Fall 2011, prior to the start of holiday season, eBags moved its call center operations back to the U.S. They currently use in-house employees to handle calls, and contracted with HGS Ltd. to handle overflow. The shift allowed the company to shave about 34% off its customer care expenses because the U.S.-based customer service representatives were able to resolve customer complaints more efficiently. American customer service reps shaved about a minute and 20 seconds from each call and resolved customer issues on the first contact 80% of the time, compared with 69% for calls handled in the Philippines. Before being acquired by Samsonite, eBags.com carried 67,000 bags and travel accessories from 600 brands. As of February 2016, eBags sold over 25 million bags and had over 3.2 million reviews on the website. In April 2017 Samsonite agreed to acquire eBags for $105 million in cash. eBags generated $158.5 million in sales in 2016, up 23.5% from $128.3 million in 2015. eBags headquarters in Greenwood Village, Colorado was closed in September 2020 and moved to Massachusetts. == Corporate Sales == eBags has a Corporate Sales division that operates the eBags Corporate Sales website, ebagscorporate.com. This division handles large orders for conferences and tradeshows, corporate gift programs, and other promotional-type events. In addition to bags and travel accessories, they provide a much broader scope of products including writing instruments, mugs, mobile tech items, and outdoor/leisure products. == Handbags.com == eBags purchased the Handbags.com domain in 1999. For several years, the website was a blog offering advice on handbag trends, styles, and brands. In July 2011, eBags rebranded Handbags.com into an online retailer of handbags, women's bags, and fashion accessories. The website's slogan is, \"Handbags.com: Bag Obsessions Begin Here\". Unlike eBags.com, Handbags.com is targeted specifically to women and was the first of the eBags sites to offer social features like signing in with Facebook and a shareable wishlist. eBags still operates Handbags.com today. == GTS and 6PM.com == In 2002, eBags took what they learned from eBags.com and formed Global Technology Services (GTS) - a division that operated e-commerce sites for two other brands in the bag industry: Tumi and Case Logic. In October 2002, they began operating Tumi.com followed by Tumi UK in October 2005, Tumi Germany in July 2006, and Tumi Japan in August 2006. The Case Logic GTS site launched in July 2005. During this same timeframe, eBags also launched 6PM.com. Purchased as Shoedini.com in March 2004 and renamed in November 2005, 6PM.com combined eBags' knowledge of bags with the complementary business of shoes. 6PM's main feature was matching bags with shoes. 6PM was sold in October 2007 to Zappos and eBags returned focus to the eBags.com site. Similarly, the GTS division was dissolved and resources were reallocated to the core business. ==References== ==External links== * eBags.com * eBags Corporate Sales * Handbags.com * Case Logic.
