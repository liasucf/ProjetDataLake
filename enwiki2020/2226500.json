Left to right Abstract / Bougouni / Southern region style, Vertical/ Segu/ Northern region style, the Horizontal / Bamako / Northern region style, and the Abstract / Sikasso region style. Two Chiwara at the Art Institute of Chicago. Female (left) and male Vertical styles. A Chiwara (also Chi wara, Ci Wara, or Tyi Wara; ; ) is a ritual object representing an antelope, used by the Bambara ethnic group in Mali. The Chiwara initiation society uses Chiwara masks, as well as dances and rituals associated primarily with agriculture, to teach young Bamana men social values as well as agricultural techniques. == Stylistic variations == Chiwara masks are categorized in three ways: horizontal, vertical, or abstract. In addition, Chiwara can be either male or female. Female Chiwara masks are denoted by the presence of a baby antelope and straight horns. Male Chiwara masks have bent horns and a phallus. The sex of a Chiwara mask is much clearer on horizontal and vertical masks while abstract masks tend to be difficult to classify. The appearance of the Chiwara form varies greatly both by region and time produced. Specific master wood carvers also subtly modified the accepted (or even religiously mandated) local forms, forming a distinct \"signature\" or \"school\" of Chiwara figures.Allen Wardwell (November 1984) A Bambara Master Carver, African Arts, 18(1):pp83\u201384. These regional variations have been roughly assigned the stylistic categories above. Thus the Bougouni / Southern region style are an amalgam of several animal motifs combined in the same work, in an abstract style; the Bamako / Northern region style is usually of the horizontal style; the Segu/ Northern region style (the heartland of the Bambara Empire) matches the vertical style with the unique \"cut out\" triangular body motif of the males. Other regional styles have been proposed, including the Sikasso region style, with a thin, delicate, vertical form within almost human, snoutless face.See descriptions at Ciwara, African chimeras. Exhibition, Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly, Paris. 23 June \u2013 17 December 2006 . and see the galleries at Hamill Gallery:Bamana Chi Wara. ==Ceremonial usage== In Bambara, chi wara means laboring wild animal,Elisabeth Salzhauer Axel, Nina Sobol Levent (2003) and is a representation of Bambara mythos about the creation of farming. === Mousso Koroni === While there are several versions of the story, the discovery of agriculture is credited to the hero Chi Wara, a half antelope, half human figure born from the union of the sky goddess Mousso Koroni and an earth spirit in the shape of a cobra. The Chi Wara came to earth to teach humans to sow crops, and thus is honored at both sowing and harvest festivals. === The Chi Wara figure === The Chi Wara itself is usually represented as a Roan Antelope with an almost human face, but also takes shapes of other creatures and emblems of farming. The hero descends from the sky goddess, and thus represents the sun, its body is often elongated and short legged to represent the aardvark who burrows into the earth like a farmer. Its high horns echo the stalks of millet, and it stands on a dancer clad in a mass of raffia stalks to represent both flowing water and a bountiful harvest. The zig-zag patterns echo the movement of the sun across the sky, and the penis of the male figure stands low to the ground, fertilizing the earth. The Chi Wara figures always appear as a male/female pair, combining the elements of fertility of humans with fertility of the earth. The female figure usually carries a young antelope on her back, and is said to represent human beings carried by the Chi Wara hero, as well as a newborn human carried on a mother's back. ===chi wara ton=== As farmers of the upper Niger river savanna, the blessing of agriculture is of central importance to Bambara society. These traditions survive in part because the Bambara were one of the last cultures in the area to embrace Islam, after the fall of the Bambara Empire in the late 19th century. Bambara culture has traditionally had a strict set of age and caste fraternities (ton/jo/jow), and the chi wara ton society is one of the more important. It gathers all young adult males of the Soli age group to work the fields at clearing, sowing and harvest, when the greatest number of laborers is needed. Secret teachings of the chi wara ton pass the needed skills for this work, upon which the very survival of the community depends. The chi wara ton is also the only major Bambara society which includes both sexes. Women's labor is needed for agriculture, just as both sexes are needed for human reproduction. === Dance === The Chi Wara is always danced with each wooden figure attached to a basket on the dancer's head, and the body covered in a huge pile of raffia. Often the face is obscured with raffia that has been colored or decorated, and the dancer carries a long staff. The figures are always in one or more male/female pairs, with the female usually dancing behind the male, fanning him and spreading his powers into the gathered community. The Male figures leap to represent the antelope, and then scratch the earth with their staves or horns as the Chi Wara teaches humans to cultivate crops. In some communities the Mousso Koroni figure also appears. Initiated children wear a \"Sogono Kuni\" (\"Little antelope head\"), which is quite rare to find in museums. princetonol.com: Chi Wara Headdress of the Bamana . This provides much greater detail and sources, while University of Virginia. ART IN CONTEXT: How is the Chi Wara Used? and Humboldt State University: gallery of Chi Wara and other Bambara dancers , show images of the full ceremony. == World influence == African sculptural forms became fashionable amongst European artists and collectors at the beginning of the Twentieth century, and the Chiwara, especially in its more abstract forms, became one of the icons of what Europeans called Primitive Art. The artist Guillaume Apollinaire and collector Paul Guillaume published images of the Chiwara in their Sculptures n\u00e8gres in 1917, while Picasso, Braque, and Les Fauves became fascinated with African sculpture and masks in general, and the Chiwara figure in particular.Some examples of French studies of African sculpture among the artists, critics, and collectors of Modern Art include: \u00c0 propos d'art n\u00e8gre by Guillaume Apollinaire; Opinions sur l'art n\u00e8gre with contributions by Braque, Matisse, and Picasso; Rencontre avec l'art n\u00e8gre by Jean Laude; La Sculpture n\u00e8gre et l'art moderne by Paul Guillaume; and L'art n\u00e8gre by Henri Clouzot and Andr\u00e9 Level. A vertical, male, semi-abstracted Chiwara figure was included in the 1935 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibit African Negro Art, and the Masterpieces of African Art at the Brooklyn Museum in 1954, (as well as shows in LondonThe Sculptor Henry Moore singles out the Chiwara in a review of a 1951 London show.
