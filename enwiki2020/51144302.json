She studied the piano with Henri Herz, Moscheles, and Kalkbrenner. She gave her first formal recital at the age of eight, amazing the public with her young virtuosity. The famous critic Fran\u00e7ois Joseph F\u00e9tis wrote that he had heard all the famous pianists, but that none conveyed to him a sentiment of perfection like Madame Pleyel (\"...mais je d\u00e9clare qu'aucun d'eux ne m'a donn\u00e9, comme Madame Pleyel, le sentiment de perfection.\").F\u00e9tis, Fran\u00e7ois Joseph, Biographie universelle des musiciens et bibliographie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la musique, vol VII (Paris, 1860\u20131868). ==Marriage and later career== Berlioz was desperately in love with Pleyel, and in 1830 they became engaged. While he was in Italy, she broke off the engagement to marry Camille Pleyel, son of Ignaz Pleyel, and heir to the piano manufacturing business. Pleyel was one of the most admired pianists of the 1830s. In 1848, she became chair of the piano department of the Brussels Conservatoire. She died in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, near Brussels.
