Lutes papers, Marian Matyn Her first paid publication was in the Detroit Free Press. In 1906 her first book Just Away: A Story of Hope attracted interest due to the recent accidental shooting death of her son Ralph. She moved to Cooperstown, New York to join the staff of American Motherhood, a magazine founded by Dr. Mary Wood-Allen. From 1908 to 1919 she was the editor of American Motherhood; in 1919 she moved to Today's Housewife, another magazine from the same publisher, Arthur Crist, in Cooperstown.

Dawson from the Dictionary of Midwestern Literature: Volume 1: The Authors (2001)The Editor, Vol. 45, Feb. 10, 1917, The Editor Company, Ridgewood, NJ, p. 121 In 1924 Lutes became the housekeeping editor of Modern Priscilla, a Boston-based women's housekeeping magazine, and director of their \"Proving Plant\", an early testing facility for housekeeping products. She continued there until the organization ceased to operate in 1930 due to the Depression. After this time Lutes concentrated on her writing and achieved success starting around 1935, initially combining her expertise in cookbooks and recipes with her memories of her Michigan childhood in a series of popular essays collected in The Country Kitchen (1936), which won a National Book Award for \"Most Original Work\". Lutes had many articles and stories published in a variety of magazines, including Vogue, Woman's Day, Farm Journal, American Mercury, Gourmet, and others, and a historical article on dime novelist (and Cooperstown resident) Erastus Beadle published in New York History.New York History, Vol. 22, no. 2 (April 1941), p. 147-157 Lutes died of a heart attack in 1942, shortly after finishing her final memoir, Cousin William. She was buried near her childhood home in Jackson, Michigan. ==Appreciations== In a promotional blurb published on the dust jacket of one of her own books, L. M. Montgomery wrote of Lutes' The Country Kitchen, \"I seemed on every page to be living over again my own childhood in that old P.E. Island kitchen I remember so well. The book is so full of delightful humor and characters. Its people are alive. I've put it away on my 'special bookshelf' where I keep all the books I really love.\"The L. M. Montgomery Reader: Volume One, ed. Benjamin Lefebvre, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2013, p. 154 Lawrence Dawson wrote in 1981 that \"Mrs. Lutes's writing was \"unusual\" because she wrote with respect about American \"country folk\" when it was still not the respectable thing to do\", that \"she had an unusual sense for the uniquely characteristic detail\", and that she had an unusual ear for dialect.\"'A Word for What was Eaten': An Introduction to Della T.
