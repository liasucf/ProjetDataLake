He was a canon in Link\u00f6ping Cathedral. Upon his appointment as bishop, he was the first Bishop of Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s aligned with the Lutheranism. Botvid Sunesson opposed King Gustav's marriage to Catherine Stenbock and was consequently deposed from his bishopric and kept prisoner at Gripsholm Castle. In 1561 Botvid Sunesson was reinstated as bishop but he died a year later.Fehr, I. \"Botvid Sunesson\", Swedish National Biography.
