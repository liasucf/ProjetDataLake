What in Goethe is presented as a clash of moral and natural laws, appears in the film as a questioning of norms, moral and ethics of civil marriage. For literature fans still a remarkable contribution.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1974 films Category:1974 drama films Category:German drama films Category:East German films Category:Films based on German novels Category:Films based on works by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Category:Films set in the 1800s ",
