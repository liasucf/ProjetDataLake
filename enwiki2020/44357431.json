    "text": "G. Pat Collins, also known as George Pat Collins or Pat Collins (born George Percy Collins; December 16, 1895 \u2013 August 5, 1959) was an American actor of the stage and screen. ==Biography== Collins was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1895. After serving in the United States Army during World War I, Collins began his acting career in the New York theater scene. His first Broadway appearance was in the 1922 play, The Bootleggers, a short-lived comedy which was produced at the 39th Street Theatre in November and December of that year. He would appear in ten plays between 1922 and 1938. His film career would last slightly longer, mostly as a character actor or in smaller roles, from 1928 through 1958, during which time he appeared in over 100 films. Collins often played earnest roles like police or military officers. His first film was a silent picture, the 1928 film, The Racket, which stars Louis Wolheim, and in which Collins had a featured role. It would be the only silent film he would make. Two years later, in 1930, Collins would have a featured role in another film with Wolheim, the classic All Quiet on the Western Front. In 1922 he would marry the silent film actress, Billie Rhodes, and the two would remain married until Collins death. After finishing work on They Died With Their Boots On, in which he had a small role, Collins took a break from the film industry, and at the age of 47 re-enlisted in the armed services for the duration of World War II. He would return to films with a small role in 1947's Easy Come, Easy Go. Collins would continue to act in films through 1958, mostly in supporting and small roles. His final film would be in the Glenn Ford 1958 vehicle, The Sheepman. He died on August 5, 1959 in Los Angeles, aged 63. ==Filmography== (Per AFI database) *The Racket (1928) as Patrolman Johnson *Half Marriage (1929) as Detective Bob Mulhall (uncredited) *All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) as Bertinck *Be Yourself!
