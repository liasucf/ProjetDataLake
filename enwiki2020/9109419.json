    "text": "The Holland with Boston by-election, 1924 was a by-election held on 31 July 1924 for the British House of Commons constituency of Holland with Boston in Lincolnshire. The by-election was caused by the death of the town's Labour Member of Parliament (MP) William Stapleton Royce, who had held the seat since its creation for the 1918 general election. The Liberal candidate was the son of Sir Richard Winfrey, MP for South West Norfolk from 1906\u20131923 and Gainsborough from 1923-24. The result was a victory for the Conservative Party candidate Arthur Dean. == Votes == == References == == Sources == * * == See also == * Holland with Boston constituency * 1929 Holland with Boston by- election * 1937 Holland with Boston by-election * List of United Kingdom by- elections (1918\u20131931) Holland with Boston by-election Holland with Boston by- election Holland with Boston by-election Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Lincolnshire constituencies ",
