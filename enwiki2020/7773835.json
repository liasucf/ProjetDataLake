    "text": "The center of Rushmore Mall near the main entrance Rushmore Mall is a shopping mall located in Rapid City, South Dakota. It opened in 1978 and fulfills the needs of residents in a sprawling western South Dakota/northwestern Nebraska/northeastern Wyoming market area. The mall is currently owned by Spinoso. The anchor stores are JCPenney, Planet Fitness, Traders Market, and At Home. There is 1 vacant anchor store that was once Herberger's. ==History== Original anchors were JCPenney and Sears, each of which relocated from downtown Rapid City, and Herberger's, which originally was located on the south side of the mall. Target was added as a fourth anchor on the north side of the mall in 1980, while Herberger's erected a new location west of Target in 1995 and Scheels All Sports replaced the original Herberger's location. At Home is located where Target had existed before relocating to Rushmore Crossing strip mall. JCPenney temporarily moved into the vacated Target space in 2014 through 2016 while its existing store was renovated.http://rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/j-c-penney-to-move-into- former-target-space-in/article_7bc42c04-df65-5da3-b4d0-47450becbd5c.html In 1999, Borders opened southwest of the mall. It closed in 2011 and later became Books-A-Million. In 2012, the mall was taken to a servicer, due in part to JCPenney threatening mall owners to leave unless they were allowed to relocate to a larger store.http://www.ibj.com/simons-rushmore-mall-loan-sent-to- servicer-fitch-says/PARAMS/article/38471 On January 4, 2018, Sears announced that they would be closing as part of a plan to close 103 stores nationwide.
