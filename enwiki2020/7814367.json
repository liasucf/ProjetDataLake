Their programming originates from the studios located on the campus of the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa. The station runs 24 hours a day all year round and there is always a live DJ producing their programming; the station never switches to prerecorded material. Typically, the programming is divided into consecutive 3-hour blocks with a distinct musical theme per block, usually hosted by a University of Hawaii student or, occasionally, a faculty or community member. As a highly diversified representative station of the people of a multicultural environment, every musical genre is typically touched upon over the course of two or three days of programming, including jazz, assorted Latino sounds, hip-hop, punk, alternative, metal, goth, reggae, electronic, Hawaiian, country, various world music strains, and many more. It currently broadcasts on 90.1 MHz as of March 19, 2016 at 3:00 PM Hawaiian Standard Time. There is one translator at K217AA on 91.1 FM in the North Shore. In addition, it is also featured on Oceanic Time Warner Cable digital channel 866 for the entire state of Hawaii.Digital Cable Program Guide / Lineups - Oceanic Time Warner Cable (accessed March 20, 2011) ==References== ==External links== *KTUH's official website *KTUH FM Honolulu - Alumni * TUH Category:Radio stations established in 1969 Category:1969 establishments in Hawaii TUH ",
