In: Ayyelet Oettinger & Danny Bar- Maoz (eds.), Mittuv Yosef: Yosef Tobi Jubilee Volume, vol. 2: The Jews of Yemen: History and Culture, pp. clxiii\u2013cxc. Haifa the zaffa ( / ALA-LC: zaffah), or wedding march, is a musical procession of bendir drums, bagpipes, horns, belly dancers and men carrying flaming swords. This is an ancient arab tradition that predates Islam. When the procession reaches its destination, usually the house of the bridegroom, there is usually a party, more loud noises, and then dinner. The Zaffa is well-documented in many Egyptian movies ever since its start, 100+ years ago. ==References== Category:Egyptian music Category:Egyptian culture Category:North African culture Category:Middle Eastern culture ",
