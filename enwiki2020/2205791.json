    "text": "\"I Saw Three Ships (Come Sailing In)\" is a traditional and popular Christmas carol from England. The earliest printed version of \"I Saw Three Ships\" is from the 17th century, possibly Derbyshire, and was also published by William Sandys in 1833.Cecil James Sharp (2008) The Morris Book: With a Description of Dances as Performed by the Morris Men The lyrics mention the ships sailing into Bethlehem, but the nearest body of water is the Dead Sea about away. The reference to three ships is thought to originate in the three ships that bore the purported relics of the Biblical magi to Cologne Cathedral in the 12th century.Website describing the carol and giving secondary references Another possible reference is to Wenceslaus II, King of Bohemia, who bore a coat of arms \"Azure three galleys argent\".Camden Roll, dated c.1280, entry 11 and Heralds' Roll, dated c.1280 entry 18. Another suggestion is that the ships are actually the camels used by the Magi, as camels are frequently referred to as \"ships of the desert\". ==Arrangements== An arrangement by Martin Shaw appears in the Oxford Book of Carols.The Oxford Book of Carols (1928) p.36. The Carols for Choirs series of carol books features arrangements of the carol by both Sir David Willcocks and John Rutter. Organist Simon Preston and former conductor of the Choir of King's College, Cambridge, Sir Philip Ledger, have also written arrangements that the choir have performed at the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols in recent years. There is also a more recent choral arrangement by British composer Richard Fox. This carol is also featured in the musical Caroline, or Change, but as a counterpoint. Adapted by Jon Schmidt on Jon Schmidt Christmas album. John Renbourn has arranged it (in a rather free adaptation) for guitar. The song appears on Nat King Cole's 1960 album The Magic of Christmas (l/k/a \"The Christmas Song\"), arranged by Ralph Carmichael. ==Other versions== Illustration for three pretty girls in the ship entertaining at a wedding held on New Year's Day in a children's book * \"I saw three ships come sailing by on New Year's Day\" is a 19th-century version, which mentions three pretty girls in the ship entertaining at a wedding held on New Year's Day. ==Other recordings== * The Barenaked Ladies recorded a version on their Christmas album Barenaked for the Holidays in 2004 and on their Snacktime:Live at Massey Hall album in 2009. * Canadian singer/songwriter Bruce Cockburn recorded a version on his Christmas album Christmas in 1993. * English musician Sting recorded a version for the compilation album A Very Special Christmas 3 in 1997. * Progressive rock singer Jon Anderson released a version as the title track of his album 3 Ships in 1985. * Keyboardist Keith Emerson recorded an instrumental rock adaptation on his The Christmas Album (1988). * Mannheim Steamroller recorded the song on their first Christmas album. * In 1995, Glen Campbell recorded the song on his Christmas album Christmas with Glen Campbell. * Blackmore's Night recorded the song on their 2006 Christmas-themed album Winter Carols. * Sufjan Stevens recorded a version of the song in 4/4 time for his album Hark!: Songs for Christmas, Vol. II.* * The main refrain is used as the outro for the Half Man Half Biscuit song \"It's Cliched to be Cynical at Christmas\" from the album Trouble over Bridgwater. * Lindsey Stirling released her version on her holiday album Warmer in the Winter.Katrina Rees, \"ALBUM REVIEW: Lindsey Stirling \u2013 \u2018Warmer In The Winter\u2019,\", CelebMix, October 19, 2017 * Three ships appear as an instrumental version of Teletubbies, since the Teletubbies had to sit down the hill to see the ships. * At the end of A Muppet Family Christmas, during the Christmas caroling medley, the Count leads everyone in singing \"I Saw Three Ships\". * In their 2002 album, Twenty-Four Seven, folk trio Coope Boyes and Simpson include a loose adaptation written by Mike Waterson as a tribute to the lives lost when three Hull trawlers sunk in close succession in February 1968. * Chris Squire recorded this song on his Swiss Choir album.
