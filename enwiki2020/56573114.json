Having since worked his way up and been commissioned as an Inspector in the CID's Special Investigation Section, Sean gained access to narrow down his search to Bangkok, Thailand in hope of reuniting with his long - lost brother. On one such trip, Sean encounters Lynn, a jaded, self - serving tour leader who makes him out to be a pervert and child kidnapper, and gets him arrested. There they meet Aut, a high - flying, hot - shot Thai Inspector who seems to care more about his image than police work and, at the same time, is suspiciously familiar with the local gangs. Thus their lives collided and become intertwined, and what started as one man's search for his brother, quickly turns into a dangerous foray into the underbelly of an international human trafficking syndicate. ==Trivia== * This is Ann Kok's first English drama series in over 25 years. == Synopsis == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Episode Number !Description !Date Aired |- |1` |A 12-year - old boy, Kelvin, goes missing from a tour group and the tour guide, Lynn, is forced to help search for him.
