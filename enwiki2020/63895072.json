The regular season was set to commence on Thursday 9 April and end on Sunday 12 July, with the finals then taking place between 16\u201324 July. However, following the coronavirus outbreak in early to mid March 2020, the season was suspended indefinitely. After two months of deliberation and in the wake of easing coronavirus restrictions, the league announced a revised competition format for 2020 beginning on Tuesday 23 June and ending with the grand final on Saturday 1 August. The 2020 season was initially set to feature eight teams following the withdrawal of the Southern Huskies and Super City Rangers and the inclusion of the Franklin Bulls for the first time. However, three of the top four teams in 2019 (Wellington Saints, Hawke's Bay Hawks and Southland Sharks) decided not to enter the modified competition. This left the door open for the inclusion of the Otago Nuggets, a team who were looking to re-enter the league in 2021 for the first time since 2014, and the Huskies. Coinciding with the announcement of a revised 2020 competition, the Huskies franchise relocated from Tasmania to Auckland and became the Auckland Huskies. The 2020 season began on 23 June, with all seven teams playing up to three games per week over six weeks. The season concluded on 1 August with the Otago Nuggets defeating the Manawatu Jets in the grand final to win their maiden NBL championship. All teams were based in Auckland, with all games played out of The Trusts Arena. ==Team information== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:99%; text-align:left\" |- ! style=\"width:15%\" | Team ! style=\"width:10%\" | City origin ! style=\"width:15%\" | Arena ! style=\"width:8%\" | Colours ! style=\"width:13%\" | Head Coach |- | Auckland Huskies | Auckland | align=center rowspan=\"7\"|The Trusts Arena, Auckland | | Kevin Braswell |- | Canterbury Rams | Christchurch | | Mick Downer |- | Franklin Bulls | Auckland | | Liam Simmons |- | Manawatu Jets | Palmerston North | | Tim McTamney |- | Nelson Giants | Nelson | | Michael Fitchett |- | Otago Nuggets | Dunedin | | Brent Matehaere |- | Taranaki Mountainairs | New Plymouth | | Doug Courtney |- |} ==Summary== ===Regular season standings=== ===Finals=== Tuesday 28 July *Elimination Final 1 \u2013 6th vs 7th *Qualifying Final \u2013 1st vs 2nd Wednesday 29 July *Elimination Final 2 \u2013 3rd vs Winner EF1 *Elimination Final 3 \u2013 4th vs 5th Thursday 30 July *Semi Final 1 \u2013 Winner QF vs Lowest EF Winner *Semi Final 2 \u2013 Loser QF vs Highest EF Winner Saturday 1 August *Grand Final \u2013 Winner SF1 vs Winner SF2 ==Awards== ===Statistics leaders=== Stats as of the end of the regular season {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !
