    "text": "Night of the Demons is a 1988 American supernatural horror film directed by Kevin S. Tenney, written and produced by Joe Augustyn, and starring Amelia Kinkade, Cathy Podewell, Linnea Quigley, Hal Havins, and Alvin Alexis. The plot follows a group of high school students who throw a party inside an isolated funeral parlor. While attempting a s\u00e9ance, they accidentally release a demon locked in the crematorium that begins to possess them one by one. Filmed in Los Angeles in 1987, Night of the Demons premiered in Detroit in September 1988, grossing $3.1 million at the box office. Though it received a mixed critical response, the film would later become a cult classic in the years since its release. It was followed by two sequels, as well as a 2009 remake of the same name. ==Plot== Teenage outcast Angela Franklin and her friend Suzanne are throwing a party at Hull House, a mortuary abandoned from its gruesome past and rumored to be cursed by evil spirits. On the way there, Stooge, Helen and Rodger drive past an elderly man who is carrying apples and razor blades. When Stooge taunts him by showing his buttocks out of the passenger window, the elderly man curses at them and says that \"they'll get what they deserve.\" Judy Cassidy and her boyfriend Jay Jansen pick up their friends, Max and Frannie, for the party. When they arrive, Judy's ex-boyfriend Sal Romero crashes the party. They start the party by dancing, but the radio dies out. Angela then holds a s\u00e9ance as a party game, but Helen screams when she sees a demon in the mirror foreshadowing her demise, and the mirror falls to the ground in pieces. The group suddenly hears thuds below them, and the demon frees itself from the crematorium to possess a distracted Suzanne. The group searches around the house, and the possessed Suzanne forcefully kisses Angela for the demon to manifest in her, too. When Judy discovers that Jay only invited her to have sex, he abandons her in a room only for her to be apparently locked in. Rodger and Helen find no exit outside, but as Helen disappears and the demons call out Rodger's name he locks himself in the car. Stooge wanders with Suzanne to find a bathroom and he gets locked outside, where her face transforms and she smashes a mirror before disappearing. A confused Stooge finds Angela seductively dancing in front of the fireplace and begins to dance with her, but when they kiss she possesses him as she bites off his tongue. Meanwhile, Jay wanders off to find Suzanne in a bathroom with her breasts out and distorted lipstick all over her face and nipple. While they have sex, she reveals her inner demonic appearance to him and gouges his eyes. The possessed Stooge comes across Max and Frannie having sex in a coffin and promptly murders them both gruesomely. As Sal becomes horrified when he sees Angela putting her hands in the fire, Rodger (who had fallen asleep) is awoken from Helen's body crashing on the car. The two manage to free Judy, but are split up when the now openly demonic Angela chases after them. Hiding from Angela, Sal and Judy discover Suzanne with Jay's body before Sal is thrown out of a window. Judy escapes and she evades the demons throughout the house. When she attempts to climb down and Angela tries to kill her, Sal appears to fight her off and they both fall off the roof, with Sal impaled on a spike. Judy and Rodger are chased by the demons, and they lock themselves in the crematorium. Just as Angela and Stooge break down the door, she uses a pipe funneling gas and ignites it to torch them. They escape upstairs and are cornered by the demons, including a burnt Angela and Stooge along with the demon possessed undead bodies of Suzanne, Jay, Max, Frannie and Sal. Rodger smashes through a window that leads them outside and they begin to climb up a wall by grabbing on the barbed wire around it, but the demons try to drag down Judy by her ankles. Rodger pulls her up and they escape over the wall as the sun rises to destroy the possessed corpses and banish the demons back to hell. A severely shaken Judy and Rodger walk home together and they pass by the elderly man who watches them with disgust. He then enters his home to eat one of his wife's homemade pies, only to realize too late she used the apples that he placed the razor blades in. The blades graphically slice through his throat, killing him; his wife then casually approaches his dead body to kiss his head, saying \"Happy Halloween, dear.\" ==Cast== * Cathy Podewell as Judy * Amelia Kinkade as Angela Franklin * William Gallo as Sal Romero * Alvin Alexis as Rodger * Linnea Quigley as Suzanne * Lance Fenton as Jay Jansen * Hal Havins as Stooge * Allison Barron as Helen * Philip Tanzini as Max * Jill Terashita as Frannie ==Production== Filming began in Los Angeles, California on April 8, 1987, under the working title Halloween Party.
