It was given to those non- natives who faithfully and honorably completed a term of service in the Congo.. It was the second decoration in terms of precedence, the Order of the African Star, introduced seventeen days earlier, being the first.. The award consisted of a five-sided silver star 30 millimetres in diameter. On one side, in the centre, was a smaller five-sided gold star, while on the other was the Free State motto, Travail et progr\u00e8s (work and progress). It came with a blue ribbon with horizontal silver bars attached to indicate the number of terms of service in the Congo. Vice-Governor General Paul Costermans, for example, wore the star with four bars.. ==References== Category:Awards established in 1889 Category:Colonial orders of chivalry Category:Orders, decorations, and medals of Belgium ",
