Her youngest brother was Anketell Moutray Read, who earned a Victoria Cross during the First World War. == Work == Under the pseudonym DH Moutray Read, she wrote the popular \"Highways and Byways of Hampshire\" volume in the MacMillan Highways & Byways series, in this instance illustrated by portrait painter Arthur Bentley Connor. Moutray Read also wrote a book on the creation of her own garden, with illustrations, plans and photographs. She began gardening with a ten rod allotment in Cottenham Park, Wimbledon, and soon realised that she could not manage without a garden. She purchased an old house and garden of about three quarters of an acre near Wadhurst in Sussex, which was grassland when Moutray Read purchased it. Moutray Read was a Fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society, and edited the Gardener's Year Book for 1930. Moutray Read was also a member of the Folklore Society, presenting a number of papers, and reviewing books for the society's journal Folklore. == References == Category:British horticulturists Category:20th-century British women writers Category:Nature writers Category:Fellows of the Royal Horticultural Society Category:1870 births Category:1947 deaths ",
