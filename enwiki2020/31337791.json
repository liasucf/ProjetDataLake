The test is to find out if the girl is pure or not and if not, she has committed some sort of impure thing or had an impure thought in her life. This is carried out by Maha Mai, who asks that the bride to be to walk 25 steps holding her hand, while underwater. Sharmi, who is Pakki's friend makes it 24 steps before she cannot hold her breath any longer.

DadaBhai who is the village head has joined hands with Maha Mai to prove all girls impure and send them to his cottage in the jungle so that he can take advantage of them and have fun and then send them off to their way out of the village.
