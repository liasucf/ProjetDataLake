    "text": "Daddy's Girls is an American television sitcom created by Brenda Hampton and David Landsberg, that aired on CBS from September 21 to October 12, 1994. ==Overview== The series followed Dudley Walker (Dudley Moore), the owner of a New York fashion house who loses his wife and his business partner when, after a years-long secret affair, they run off together leaving him as the primary caretaker to his three daughters. The series is notable as the first in which a gay principal character was played by an openly gay actor. Harvey Fierstein played Dennis Sinclair, a high-strung designer at Walker's firm. The series was critically panned, and was placed \"on hiatus\" after only three episodes had aired. This was Moore's penultimate on-screen job and his last regular television series. He later attributed his difficulties during the production of the show to the early stages of progressive supranuclear palsy, the disease that ultimately led to his death in 2002. ==Cast== * Dudley Moore as Dudley Walker * Harvey Fierstein as Dennis Sinclair * Stacy Galina as Amy Walker * Meredith Scott Lynn as Samantha Walker * Keri Russell as Phoebe Walker * Phil Buckman as Scar * Alan Ruck as Lenny ==Episodes== ==Reception== Although Fierstein earned praise for his performance, Daddy's Girls was hated by critics. New York magazine called the series \"Despised, reviled.\" Entertainment Weekly, somewhat prophetically, found Moore to be \"wan and confused\". The Dallas Morning News could only say that \"Daddy's Girls isn't horrendously bad\" but somewhat prophetically predicted that it would not last until Christmas. ==References== ==External links== * Daddy's Girls at the Internet Movie Database Category:American LGBT-related sitcoms Category:1990s American sitcoms Category:1994 American television series debuts Category:1994 American television series endings Category:CBS original programming Category:Television series by Warner Bros.
