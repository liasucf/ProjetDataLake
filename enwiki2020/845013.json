It carries 15th Avenue NW over Seattle's Salmon Bay between Ballard to the north and Interbay to the south. The Ballard Bridge follows the Fremont Bridge in the east in the succession of bridges spanning the Lake Washington Ship Canal, which connects Lake Washington in the east to Puget Sound in the west. Built in 1917, it has an opening span of and a total length of . The spans of the bridge that don't lift were originally surfaced with wood planks. It also carried a streetcar. In 1939, the fixed spans of the Ballard Bridge were replaced as a Public Works Administration project. The deck was surfaced with concrete and the rails for the streetcar were removed. In 1982, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In recent years bicyclists have complained that improvements are needed to address safety concerns. == Gallery == File:Seattle - Ballard Bridge under construction, 1916.jpg|Ballard Bridge under construction, 1916 Image:Ballard Bridge-1.jpg|The bridge, up Image:Ballard Bridge-2.jpg|The bridge, down ==Notes== https://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Man-killed- after-driving-off-open-Ballard-Bridge-1094382.php ==External links== *Seattle Department of Transportation: Ballard Bridge Category:Bridges in Seattle Category:Bascule bridges in the United States Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Washington (state) Category:National Register of Historic Places in Seattle Category:Bridges completed in 1917 Category:Towers in Washington (state) Category:Road bridges in Washington (state) Category:Drawbridges on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Ballard, Seattle Category:1917 establishments in Washington (state) ",
