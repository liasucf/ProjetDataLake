    "text": "Chandalar is an unincorporated community in Yukon-Koyukuk Census Area in the U.S. state of Alaska. Chandalar is located on the eastern shore of Chandalar Lake by Chandalar Lake Airport, about 200 miles north of Fairbanks, and is at an elevation of 1,873 feet. It succeeded an earlier community (or communities) by that name (see History). The present Chandalar has never formally reported a population on the U.S. Census. The community is served by the Chandalar Lake Airport and is not accessible by road. It was featured in the National Geographic show Life Below Zero. ==History, Other Chandalars & Little Squaw== At least two communities bore the name of Chandalar before the present one. The Chandalar Mining Camphttps://www.goldrichmining.com/media/downloads/technical_reports/Buzzel_Chandalar_Rpt.pdf p.24/25, map of area, reference to location of Chandalar was located several miles to the northeast of the current Chandalar.https://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=138:3:0::NO:3:P3_FID,P3_TITLE:1400140,Chandalar%20Mine https://www.google.com/maps/place/67%C2%B035'27.5%22N+148%C2%B009'36.9%22W/@67.5783691,-148.1494446,4574m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d67.59098!4d-148.16025 This settlement was developed as a mining camp in about 1906-07, and a post office was established in 1908, but it was shut down in 1944.https://geonames.usgs.gov/apex/f?p=138:3:0::NO:3:P3_FID,P3_TITLE:1400137,Chandalar Also at or adjacent to this location was the mining camp of Little Squaw, which was along the same named creek. Little Squaw had been named for the daughter of Frank & Nevelo Yasuda, who helped found this mining area.https://alaskamininghalloffame.org/inductees/yasuda.php Little Squaw appeared twice on the U.S. Census, reporting a population of 8 in 1930https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/00476569ch2.pdf and 10 in 1940.https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/33973538v1ch11.pdf In at least one instance, Little Squaw and Chandalar were reported as being the same place on the 1951 USGS Chandalar Topographical Map.http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/topo/250k/txu-pclmaps-topo-us- chandalar-1951.jpg The present-day census-designated place of Venetie, Alaska was also called Chandalar Village.https://www.tananachiefs.org/about/communities/venetie/ It is unclear if this was the \"Chandalar\" reported on the 1920 and 1930 U.S. Censuses. Maps of the time were not clear on the location, though the 1929 USGS Topographical Map of Chandalar-Sheenjek Region, Alaska http://cartweb.geography.ua.edu/lizardtech/iserv/calcrgn?cat=North%20America%20and%20United%20States&item;=States/Alaska//Alaska1929e.sid&wid;=1000&hei;=900&props;=item(Name,Description),cat(Name,Description)&style;=simple/view- dhtml.xsl reported Chandalar at the present location of Venetie. A review of the names on the census rolls for 1930 Chandalar and 1940 Venetie would confirm whether this was the same location. The name was removed to the present settlement on Chandalar Lake by the airport around the 1940s. ==Climate== Chandalar has a continental subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen Dfc). The nearest weather station is at Chandalar Lake. ==Demographics== ===(Old) Chandalar=== Chandalar first appeared on the 1920https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/41084484v1ch5.pdf U.S. Census and again in 1930https://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/00476569ch2.pdf as an unincorporated village. It reported \"no population\" in 1940https://catalog.archives.gov/id/5823274 and did not appear on the census again under that name. As stated under \"history\", it is unclear if this Chandalar is the former mining camp at Little Squaw Creek or if it was the present day Venetie. ===New Chandalar=== The new settlement that sprang up around the Chandalar Lake Airstrip has never formally reported a population to date, as of the 2010 Census.https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-1-3.pdf However it has a population of about 5. ==References== ==External links== * Lanigan's Retreat Category:Unincorporated communities in Alaska Category:Unincorporated communities in Unorganized Borough, Alaska Category:Unincorporated communities in Yukon\u2013Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska Category:Populated places of the Arctic United States ",
