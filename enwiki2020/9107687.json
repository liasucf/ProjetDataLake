    "text": "The Big Sleep are an American three piece band based in Brooklyn, New York. The band consists of Sonya Balchandani (bass/vocals), Danny Barria (guitar/vocals), and Gabe Rhodes (drums). The Big Sleep are signed to French Kiss Records. ==History== Formed in 2003, the band's discography includes the self-released EP You Today, Me Tomorrow, the full-length Son Of The Tiger LP (released in late 2006), the full-length album Sleep Forever (released in 2008), and the album Nature Experiments (2012). Having drawn comparisons to fellow New Yorkers Sonic Youth, The Big Sleep's sound deviates from that of more recently formed contemporaries. Often without vocals, The Big Sleep's songs are for the most part instrumentals leaning towards post-rock or shoegaze, however often with a psychedelic feel hearkening back to classic rock such as Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath. In fall 2011, The Big Sleep performed at CMJ Music Marathon and released \u201cAce\u201d, the single from their new album Nature Experiments.The Big Sleep \"Ace\" | Stereogum Nature Experiments was released on January 31, 2012.The Big Sleep Ready New Album | NBC New York ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

But the Big Sleep are less about who they might remind you of, and more about where they\u2019re going. If you went to Disney World and rode Space Mountain, and there were moments of blissful drifting between the times you\u2019re hurtling through the cosmos at breakneck speeds, it still wouldn\u2019t describe what you're in store for. Wearing a seat belt on your trip with the Big Sleep won\u2019t do you any good at all.\" - New York Press (July 2006) ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:Indie rock musical groups from New York (state) Category:Musical groups from Brooklyn Category:Musical groups established in 2003 Category:Frenchkiss Records artists ",
