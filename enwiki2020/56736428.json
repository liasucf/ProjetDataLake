    "text": "' is a sub-kilometer asteroid with a somewhat elongated and angular shape, approximately in diameter. It is classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo or Amor group. The V-type asteroid has a rotation period of approximately 1.5 hours. It was first observed on 10 November 2017 by the 60-inch Pan-STARRS 1 telescope at Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii. == Orbit and classification == It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0\u20131.7 AU once every 1 years and 7 months (585 days; semi-major axis of 1.37 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.27 and an inclination of 9\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. is a V-type asteroid with a bright surface. == 2018 flyby== Orbit of Animation of 2017 VR12 orbit from 1 October 2016 to 1 October 2018 passed 0.0097 AU (3.76 lunar distances) from Earth on 7 March 2018, the closest approach by this asteroid currently known. It brightened to 12th magnitude, making it one of the brightest Near Earth asteroids of the year. It was observed by radar from Goldstone, Green Bank and Arecibo Observatory. Images revealed that is a slightly elongated and angular body with a size of approximately 160 by 100 meters. == Physical characteristics == Images obtained at Green Bank and Arecibo observatories in 2018, revealed that is a slightly elongated and angular body with a size of approximately 160 by 100 meters. === Rotation period === On 5 March 2018, a rotational lightcurve was obtained from photometric observations by astronomers at the Northolt Branch Observatories. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 1.5 hours with a brightness amplitude between 0.4 and 0.5 magnitude (). == Gallery == File:2017 VR12 NBO 2018-02-15.png|, imaged at Northolt Branch Observatories on 15 February 2018. The asteroid is visible at 17th magnitude at this point, at a distance of 10.4 million km (6.5 million mi) from Earth. The image is inverted (stars appear dark, the background appears light). File:2017 VR12 NBO 2018-02-26.png| on 26 February 2018. The asteroid is visible at 15th magnitude, at a distance of 4.8 million km (3.0 million miles) from Earth. The telescope is tracking the asteroid, causing stars to trail as the asteroid slowly moves across the sky. File:2017 VR12 NBO 2018-03-05.png| on 5 March 2018, two days before closest approach. The asteroid was 1.9 million km (1.2 million mi) from Earth at that time, visible at 13th magnitude. File:2017 vr12-flyby.png|Daily motion outside moon's orbit.
