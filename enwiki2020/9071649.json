(1985), Deutsche Baumschule, Sept. 1985, 368-369.Vermeulen, N. (2001), Encyclopaedia of Trees & Shrubs. Fitzroy Dearborn, ==Description== 'Recerta' produces a straight, clean stem, supporting a rounded crown. The leaves are elliptic, with typically acuminate tip, the blade 6-12 cm long by 3-6.5 cm broad; the margins are doubly, if bluntly, serrate.G\u00f6tz, W. (1985). Die Ulme kehrt zur\u00fcck.

Aachen-Brand: Euroflora Klette Verl., Nd Image: Recerta leaf 2.jpg|Leaves Image: Recerta bark.jpg|Bark ==Pests and diseases== Tests in the USA found the cultivar to be only 'somewhat resistant to Dutch elm disease', meanwhile evaluation in France by the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) confirmed the tree as only 'moderately resistant'. ==Cultivation== Serious doubts as to the tree's long term culture in Europe have been expressed.Heybroek, H. M. (1986), Tuin en Landschap 8(12): 19, 1986. Although registered in 1993 as 'Recerta' by Conrad Appel KG (ceased trading 2006), of Darmstadt, Germany, the tree is not known to have ever been in commerce. ==Notable trees== A mature specimen grows in a park in the Amerbos district of north Amsterdam, planted in the early 1990s along with other elm cultivars. ==Accessions== Not known. ==References== Category:Hybrid elm cultivar Category:Ulmus articles with images Category:Ulmus ",
