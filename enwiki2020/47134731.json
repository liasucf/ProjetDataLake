    "text": "The Swan Book is the third novel by the Indigenous Australian author Alexis Wright. It met with critical acclaim when it was published, and was short- listed for Australia's premier literary prize, the Miles Franklin Award. ==Plot Introduction== The Swan Book is set in the future, with Aboriginal people still living under the Intervention in the north, in an environment fundamentally altered by climate change. It follows a girl who is pulled from a tree as a child after having been lost and gang-raped, and how she grows up raised by a European immigrant and seemingly guided by swans. After the death of her guardian, she is betrothed to a boy who grows up to become the first Indigenous President of Australia (Prime Minister has been abandoned in this future), and later marries him, despite retaining a childlike mind even as an adult. == Awards and nominations == * 2014 shortlisted Victorian Premier's Literary Awards \u2014 Prize for Indigenous Writing \u2014 Fiction * 2014 shortlisted the Stella Prize * 2014 winner ASAL Awards \u2014 ALS Gold Medal * 2014 shortlisted Miles Franklin Literary Award * 2014 shortlisted New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards \u2014 Christina Stead Prize for Fiction * 2016 winner Kate Challis RAKA Award ==Reviews== *Gleeson-White, Jane. \"Going viral\" 2013-08-23.
