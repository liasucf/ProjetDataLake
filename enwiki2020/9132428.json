    "text": "The North Macedonia national basketball team ( / Ko\u0161arkarska reprezentacija na Severna Makedonija, formerly known officially as the Macedonia national basketball team) represents North Macedonia in international basketball and is controlled by the Basketball Federation of North Macedonia, which was created in 1992. They joined FIBA in 1993, after they gained independence from Yugoslavia. That same year the national team played their first official match against Estonia. Prior to 1993, Macedonian players took part on the Yugoslavia national team. Macedonia debuted in their first international tournament at the EuroBasket in 1999. They have appeared five times at the event overall, with their top performance coming in 2011. ==History== Macedonia basketball team prior to a match at Boris Trajkovski Sports Center Before 1991, Macedonia was a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with players from Macedonia being part of the Yugoslavia national team. ===EuroBasket 1999=== Macedonia basketball team at a time out during a match with Latvia. After qualifying for EuroBasket 1999, the national team was placed in Group A, along with FR Yugoslavia, France and Israel. The first game Macedonia came out firing showing solid competitive play against the French Team, however, eventually lost by a narrow margin of 67\u201371. Next up, was Group A favorites FR Yugoslavia, showing superior play with their post up offense, Macedonia lost 68\u201383. With the final game of the group Macedonia played a fairly even match, however, luck was not on their side, losing 82\u201384. Even though Macedonia lost all 3 of their matches to be eliminated, the team showed heart and talent with their impressive play against France and Israel. Due to their small margin of the losses Macedonia ended the tournament ranked as 13th overall. ===EuroBasket 2009=== EuroBasket 2009 was the first EuroBasket tournament that Macedonia qualified for in a decade. The Macedonian national team was placed in Group A, along with Greece, Croatia and Israel. Macedonia began the tournament with a brutal 54\u201386 loss to rivals Greece, but rebounded with an 82\u201379 victory over Israel. Despite dropping their last match against Croatia, the Israel result was enough to secure second round qualification. In the second round, Macedonia was placed in Group E alongside France, Germany and Russia. Macedonia lost to France in the second round opener, but famously defeated Germany in the next game. Against Russia, Macedonia was narrowly defeated by a score of 69\u201371. This performance was not enough to secure a berth in to the knockout round. Nevertheless, Macedonia considers this as a historic success for the national team, since it was only the country's second appearance at the EuroBasket and the team advanced past the first round. In the final tournament rankings, Macedonia ranked 9th place with a record of 2\u20134. ===EuroBasket 2011=== Marin Dokuzovski, head coach of the team in 2011. Through the qualifying round, Macedonia qualified for EuroBasket 2011 and was in Group C along with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro, and Finland in the preliminary phase. The national team lost their first match to Montenegro 65\u201370 in overtime but won the remaining four against Croatia 78\u201376, Greece 72\u201358, Finland 72\u201370, and Bosnia and Herzegovina 75\u201363. Macedonia finished first in the group and advanced to the second round. In the second round, Macedonia was in Group F with Russia, Slovenia, Greece, Georgia, and Finland. Having beaten Greece and Finland in the preliminary round, Macedonia went in to the second round with a 2\u20130 record. After beating Georgia 65\u201363, Macedonia qualified for the knockout round. The team then beat Slovenia 68\u201359, but lost to Russia by 2 points 63\u201361 after Sergey Monya made a buzzer-beating shot to win the final game of the second round. Macedonia, therefore, finished second in Group F. For the first time in the national team's history, it reached the knockout stage where it defeated host country Lithuania 67\u201365 by 2 points in the quarterfinals. Macedonia then lost to the eventual champion Spain 92\u201380 in the semifinals. They then lost again in the third place game to Russia 68\u201372 and finished in fourth place. ===2012 Olympic Qualifying Tournament=== By finishing in 4th place at EuroBasket 2011, Macedonia qualified for the 2012 FIBA Olympic Qualifying Tournament. They were drawn into Group D along with Angola and New Zealand. In the first game against Angola, Macedonia came out non-aggressive in the 1st half falling to a 13 pt deficit 40\u201353 at halftime. During most of the match, the top Macedonian players showed fatigue due to the grueling playoff matches they had played for their club teams. In addition, Macedonia came out with a strong 4th quarter, eventually losing by a margin of 4 points, with the final score being 84\u201388 Angola. Top scorers for Macedonia against Angola were Pero Antic with 17, and Bo McCalebb with 21. On the next match day, which was the day after with less than 24 hours of rest, Macedonia came out a lot stronger in the 1st quarter with a strong lead that carried over the entire game. Eventually, New Zealand could not recover, and fell to Macedonia with an Final score of 84\u201362. Leading scorers for the game were Todor Gecevski with 16, Antic with 17, and McCalebb with 23. The Macedonian players got much needed rest before the quarterfinals, which would begin two days later on 6 July 2012. The team, following the 68\u201364 victory by New Zealand over Angola, won Group D and its opponent in the quarterfinals was to be the Group C runner-up, Dominican Republic. Macedonia lost the game 86\u201376, though the team had a 13-point lead at halftime. The lost eliminated the national team from qualifying for the 2012 Olympic Games ===EuroBasket 2013=== By participating at the 2012 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament, Macedonia qualified for EuroBasket 2013 in Slovenia. In a disappointing campaign, the Macedonian national team didn't manage to repeat the success from the previous Eurobasket, having one victory in five matches in their preliminary Group B against Serbia 89\u201375, which was good enough only for the last place in the group stage and 21st overall. The first game of the Eurobasket against Montenegro was particularly demoralizing, as the Montenegrins won 81\u201380 in controversial fashion, after the referees didn't call interference on the basket during Gjorgji \u010cekovski's last second game winning attempt, despite the fact that one of the Montenegrin players got his hand trapped in the net. Macedonia's best performers were once again McCalebb and Anti\u0107, with 17.6 and 13.8 points per game, respectively. After the tournament, several of the Macedonian veteran players, led by captain Pero Anti\u0107, announced their retirement from the national team. ===EuroBasket 2015=== At the EuroBasket 2015 there were not high expectations for Macedonia, due to their poor performance at their last EuroBasket appearance in 2013. In their first match against Greece they were thoroughly manhandled throughout as they were defeated 65-85. Looking for their first victory heading in to their second match of the tournament they went up against the Netherlands. The outcome was different this time, as the national team played with more energy and heart and pulled out an 78-71 win. Unfortunately, that would wind up being the only win for Macedonia, as they finished with an 1-4 record and a lousy 19th place at the event. ===Country's name change and recent years=== Macedonia was renamed North Macedonia after the Prespa agreement that came into effect on 12 February 2019. North Macedonia took part in the 2019 World Cup Pre-Qualifiers, but were eliminated after posting an 1-3 record in their group. They will now go through EuroBasket 2021 qualifiers for the chance to qualify to the next EuroBasket. ==Competitive record== ===FIBA World Cup=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:
