Between 10 July and 9 September, she performed similar duties out of Bermuda, and on 12 September, put to sea from Norfolk to rescue hurricane-disabled SS George Ade. She reached the stricken ship on the 15th, and brought her safely to port through another violent storm, in which she herself was damaged. From 31 December 1944 to 4 June 1945, Escape again operated out of Bermuda, during this time aiding three large ships damaged by heavy seas. On 11 August, she departed Norfolk for the Pacific Ocean, but with the end of hostilities, her orders were changed, and after towing scows from Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, to Tampa, Florida, she sailed to Davisville, Rhode Island, for mooring buoys.
