    "text": "The following tables provide a comparison of computer algebra systems (CAS). A CAS is a package comprising a set of algorithms for performing symbolic manipulations on algebraic objects, a language to implement them, and an environment in which to use the language. A CAS may include a user interface and graphics capability; and to be effective may require a large library of algorithms, efficient data structures and a fast kernel. ==General== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: smaller; text-align: center; width: auto;\" |- ! style=\"width: 12em\" | System !

The ability to generate plaintext files is also a sought-after feature because it allows a work to be understood by people who do not have a computer algebra system installed. ===Operating system support=== The software can run under their respective operating systems natively without emulation. Some systems must be compiled first using an appropriate compiler for the source language and target platform. For some platforms, only older releases of the software may be available. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: smaller; text-align: center; width: auto;\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"width: 12em\" | System !
