    "text": "The 2001 Benson & Hedges Masters was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament that took place between 4 and 11 February 2001 at the Wembley Conference Centre in London, England. Paul Hunter won the first of his three Masters titles by defeating Fergal O'Brien in a dramatic final match. O'Brien had led 6\u20132 at the end of the afternoon session, but Hunter dominated the evening session by compiling four century breaks in six frames to lead 9\u20138 and finally winning the title 10\u20139 after a long final frame. Also in the competition, Steve Davis had failed to compete for the first time since 1980, after he had dropped out of the top 16 the previous season and was denied a wild-card. Jimmy White took the wild-card entry as he was the local favourite. A future World Champion Shaun Murphy played in his television debut after winning the Benson and Hedges Championship a few months previously and defeated Marco Fu 6\u20131 in the wild-card round before losing against Stephen Hendry 4\u20136 in the first round. The highest break of the tournament was 136, which was achieved by both Paul Hunter and Jimmy White. ==Field== Defending champion Matthew Stevens was the number 1 seed with World Champion Mark Williams seeded 2. Places were allocated to the top 16 players in the world rankings. Players seeded 15 and 16 played in the wild-card round against the winner of the qualifying event, Shaun Murphy (ranked 151), and Jimmy White (ranked 18), who was the wild-card selection. Shaun Murphy was making his debut in the Masters. ==Prize fund== The breakdown of prize money for this year is shown below: *Winner: \u00a3175,000 *Runner-up: \u00a388,000 *Highest break: \u00a320,000 *Total: \u00a3650,000 ==Wild-card round== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\" |- !
