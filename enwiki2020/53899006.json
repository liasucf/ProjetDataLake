Nowadays the church is used for Roman Catholic services. ==History== The british started to develop the area known as Mtarfa around the end of the 19th century. When the RNH Mtarfa was built after WWI, the chapel dedicated to St Oswald of Northumbria was constructed to serve the spiritual needs of the stationed navy personnel. It was dedicated on March 12, 1921. After the departure of the British forces in 1979, the chapel fell into disuse. Some years later, the chapel was reopened and blessed as a Roman Catholic chapel. It is still in use. The chapel has one altar and a stone pulpit.\"Mtarfa\", Malta-Canada. Retrieved on 27 April 2017. \"Churches\", Local Councils.
