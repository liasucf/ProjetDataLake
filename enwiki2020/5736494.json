It is located on the east bank of the River Daugava, to the east of the City Centre and is defined roughly as the area between A. Deglava Iela and Ieri\u0137u Iela.Riga Map - http://www.balticlines.lv/images/map_riga.gif The area is characterised by apartment blocks from the late Soviet and early independence years (1980s\u20131990s), though there is also some detached housing. The district is Latvian and Russian-speaking. Domina Shopping Centre is the largest shopping centre in the Baltic states, located on the northwest side of Purvciems. == History == Starting the end of 17th century and start of 18th century, the largely unsurveyed territory was called Hausma\u0146a purvs. Until the 19th century, only yeomen lived there. In 1828, the first part of the region was included in Riga's borders, and the area saw rise in single-family house construction. The second part of the region was included in Riga's borders in 1924, when a regional development plan and road construction led to rise in family home construction. The territory remained primarily for single homes until 1963\u20134. In 1965, the Purvciems housing block plan was conceived, that led to extensive high-rise building throughout 1970\u201380s. Purvciems together with P\u013cavnieki is one of the most densely inhabited neighbourhoods of Riga. ==References== Category:Neighbourhoods in Riga ",
