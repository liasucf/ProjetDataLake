    "text": "The 2015 Meath Intermediate Football Championship is the 89th edition of the Meath GAA's premier club Gaelic football tournament for intermediate graded teams in County Meath, Ireland. The tournament consists of 18 teams, with the winner going on to represent Meath in the Leinster Intermediate Club Football Championship. The championship starts with a group stage and then progresses to a knock out stage. The draw for the group stages of the championship were made on 9 February 2015 with the games commencing on the weekend of 10 April 2015. Cortown were promoted to the middle grade after a 3-year exodus when securing the J.F.C. crown last year. This was Oldcastle's return to the Intermediate grade after 5 years as a senior club since being relegated last year. Clann na nGael were relegated tho the J.F.C. after 8 years in the middle grade. On 4 October 2015, Ratoath claimed their first ever I.F.C. title (since beginning to field football teams in 1956) when overcoming Nobber 1-15 to 0-5 in Pairc Tailteann and hence earning promotion to the S.F.C. for the first time in their history. After winning the Meath I.F.C. Ratoath also made history by winning their first Leinster Intermediate Club Football Championship and became only the second Meath club to win this honour after Wolfe Tones in 2004. They beat Athlone of Westmeath in the final. Unfortunately their journey came to an end at the All-Ireland semi-final stage when losing to Kerry I.F.C. champions St. Mary's Cahirciveen who featured former All-Star and Kerry Bryan Sheehan. ==Team changes== The following teams have changed division since the 2014 championship season. ===From I.F.C.=== Promoted to S.F.C. * Ballinlough - (Intermediate Champions) Relegated to 2015 J.F.C. * Carnaross ===To I.F.C.=== Relegated from 2013 S.F.C. * Oldcastle Promoted from 2014 J.F.C. * Cortown - (Junior 'A' Champions) ==Participating teams== The teams taking part in the 2015 Meath Intermediate Football Championship are: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
