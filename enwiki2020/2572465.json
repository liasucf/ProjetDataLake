    "text": ":Bourbaki also defines an inductive set to be a partially ordered set that satisfies the hypothesis of Zorn's lemma when nonempty. In descriptive set theory, an inductive set of real numbers (or more generally, an inductive subset of a Polish space) is one that can be defined as the least fixed point of a monotone operation definable by a positive \u03a31n formula, for some natural number n, together with a real parameter. The inductive sets form a boldface pointclass; that is, they are closed under continuous preimages. In the Wadge hierarchy, they lie above the projective sets and below the sets in L(R). Assuming sufficient determinacy, the class of inductive sets has the scale property and thus the prewellordering property. The term having a number of different meanings. According to: *Russell's definition, an inductive set is a nonempty partially ordered set in which every element has a successor. An example is the set of natural numbers N, where 0 is the first element, and the others are produced by adding 1 successively. *Roitman considers the same construction in a more abstract form: the elements are sets, 0 is replaced by the empty set emptyset, and the successor of every element y is the set y union {y}. In particular, every inductive set contains a sequence of the form. *For many other authors (e.g., Bourbaki), an inductive set is a partially ordered set in which every totally ordered subset has an upper bound, i.e., it is a set fulfilling the assumption of Zorn's lemma. ==References== * Category:Descriptive set theory ",
