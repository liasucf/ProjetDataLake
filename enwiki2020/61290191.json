Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the Games have been postponed to 23 July to 8 August 2021, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be the nation's fifteenth appearance at the Summer Olympics, having taken part in all but three editions since its debut (as the Gold Coast) in 1952. Ghana did not attend Montreal 1976 because of the African boycott, as well as the Moscow 1980, when the nation joined the United States-led boycott. ==Athletics== Ghanaian athletes achieved the entry standards, either by qualifying time or by world ranking, in the following track and field events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event): ;Track & road events {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Quarterfinal !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left rowspan=2|Joseph Amoah |align=left|Men's 100 m |colspan=2 | | | | | | |-align=center |align=left|Men's 200 m | | |colspan=2 | | | | |} ;Field events {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Qualification !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Distance !Position !Distance !Position |-align=center |align=left|Nadia Eke |align=left|Women's triple jump | | | | |} ==Boxing== Ghana entered two boxers into the Olympic tournament.
