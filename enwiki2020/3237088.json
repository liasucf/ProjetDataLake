WDLA UK, Lancaster UK, 2011. ISSN 1368-485X Production of the aircraft kit was ended in 2012. ==Development== Lancair IV on a ground engine run with the engine cowlings removed and door open The Lancair IV and IV-P were designed by Lancair around the Continental TSIO-550 - a twin turbocharged engine that is capable of developing at sea level and capable of operating altitudes as high as 29,000 feet. By the fall of 2011 110 Lancair IVs and 250 IV-Ps had been completed and were flying. In July 2016 the company announced it would sell the older Lancair lines of aircraft, including the Lancair IV, to concentrate on the Lancair Evolution instead. Once the transition was complete the company changed its name to the Evolution Aircraft Company. The buyer of the old lines of aircraft continued in business as Lancair International, LLC. ==Operational history== In 2014, Bill Harrelson piloted a Lancair IV setting a world speed record for solo flight between the earth's poles for an aircraft under in a 175-hour-long series of flights. The flight also broke a record from Fairbanks, Alaska to Kinston, North Carolina. The aircraft was modified to hold of fuel. ==Variants== ;Lancair IV :Unpressurized four seat kit-plane, powered by a Continental TSIO-550 engine ;Lancair IV-P :Pressurized four seat kit-plane, powered by a Continental TSIO-550 engine ;Lancair Propjet :Pressurized four seat kit-plane, powered by either a Walter or a PT6 Pratt & Whitney turboprop, that can achieve cruise speeds in excess of 300 knots (556 km/h) at altitudes up to 30,000 feet (9,140 m). ;Lancair Tigress :A proposed pressurized version using the Orenda OE600 V-8 engine, giving it a cruise speed of . The engine was later cancelled and consequently only prototypes of the aircraft were completed.Purdy, Don: AeroCrafter - Homebuilt Aircraft Sourcebook, Fifth Edition, page 190. BAI Communications, 15 July 1998. ;RDD Enterprises LX7 :A re-manufactured version that converts an existing IV-P by replacing the wing with one with a new airfoil to reduce stall speed, a new fuel system, new interior and avionics. ==Accidents== As of June 2014, the NTSB Aviation Accident Database records 20 crashes involving 18 fatalities across all IV variants. On February 3, 2012, Steve Appleton, CEO of Micron Technology, Inc., was killed while attempting an emergency landing in a Lancair IV-PT turboprop at the Boise Airport in Boise, Idaho, moments after takeoff. He had aborted a take off a few minutes earlier. ==Specifications (Lancair IV-P)== ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Homebuilt aircraft Category:1990s United States civil utility aircraft IV Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft ",
