The daily afternoon program offered a mix of US-based cartoons (such as Wacky Races, Scooby-Doo and The Archies), with viewer competitions. One of his tag lines on the telephone with viewer contestants who were unsuccessful was \"golly gosh\". When Kemsley left in 1973, Daryl Somers took over the time slot.

He went on to write three children's plays: The Land Of Coloured Dreams, Once Upon A Time... And All That and The Magical Adventures of Puck. Kemsley left Channel Nine and then studied in England at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) in 1979. ==Cartoonist== In 1984 Kemsley was invited to take over the syndicated comic strip, Ginger Meggs, and several comic books featuring the character have since been published. He has also contributed to The Traralgon Journal, Adelaide's Sunday Mail, Sydney's The Sun-Herald, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Daily Telegraph. Kemsley twice served as President of the Australian Cartoonists' Association. Awards include the 2001 Stanley Award for Cartoonist of the Year, presented by the Australian Cartoonist's Association.
