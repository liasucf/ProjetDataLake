    "text": "is a fictional character in the Dragon Ball manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He is first seen as the reincarnation of the evil Piccolo Daima\u014d in chapter #161 , published in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump magazine on February 9, 1988, and is positioned as the demonic archrival of the protagonist Son Goku. However, it is later revealed that he is in fact a member of an extraterrestrial humanoid species called Namekians, those able to create the series' eponymous wish-granting Dragon Balls. After losing to Goku, Piccolo decides to team up with him and his friends in order to defeat newer, more dangerous threats, such as Vegeta, Frieza, Cell and Majin Buu. He also trains Goku's first child Gohan in martial arts, with the two forming a strong bond. ==Creation and development== Piccolo, more specifically his parent Piccolo Daima\u014d, was created by Toriyama as he wanted to have a villain who would be a true \"bad guy.\" Prior to his creation, nearly all the previous villains in the series were considered too likable. His editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, stated he introduced Toriyama to evil historical figures for inspiration. Piccolo Daima\u014d was created after he told the author how Roman Emperor Nero enjoyed watching people suffer. However, the Shenlong Times issue #2, a bonus pamphlet given to some buyers of the Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide guidebook, says that the character was modeled after Torishima himself. After creating Piccolo Daima\u014d, Toriyama noted that it was one of the most interesting parts of the series and that he became one of his favorite characters. Although Piccolo's transformation from a villain to a hero was considered by Toriyama to be clich\u00e9, he still felt excited when drawing him, noting that despite having a scary face, he still looks appealing. Piccolo is initially assumed to, like his parent, be a member of the , however, midway through the series it is learned that they are actually members of the alien race called . Toriyama stated that he never thought of making Piccolo an alien until Kami was introduced. But afterwards he did try to make it consistent, such as drawing the Namekian architecture similar to the throne Piccolo Daima\u014d had. ===Voice actors=== In the original Japanese version of the anime and all other media, Piccolo is voiced by Toshio Furukawa, with the only exception being his initial newborn child form which was voiced by Hiromi Tsuru. Furukawa, who up to that point had mostly played happy lighter-voiced characters, said he got the role because he stated in interviews at the time that he wanted to play a villain. He said it was difficult to constantly perform with a low voice because his normal lighter voice would break through if he broke concentration. When asked if Takeshi Aono's work as Piccolo Daima\u014d influenced his portrayal of Piccolo, Furukawa replied that because Piccolo Daima\u014d was impulsive, he initially played his own role as an energetic person around eighteen-years-old and later imagined him as close to thirty-years old in Dragon Ball Z. Furukawa, as well as Gohan's voice actress Masako Nozawa, said the episodes where Piccolo trains Gohan left an impression on them. He said the fans really enjoyed those episodes as well. Furukawa also cited Piccolo making a pun for Kai\u014d-sama as memorable because it was so out of character for him. By the time he reprised the voice in Dragon Ball Super, Piccolo had become Furukawa's favorite character of all his roles.Dragon Ball Super Cast Comments In English, several different voice actors have voiced Piccolo, including Scott McNeil in episodes 1-53 (1-67 unedited) in Funimation Entertainment's initial dub of Dragon Ball Z in association with Saban Entertainment and Ocean Productions as well as Geneon's dub of the first three Dragon Ball Z films,Dragon Ball Z Geneon dub's credits and episodes 108-291 of Westwood Media's dub of the franchise (in association with Ocean Productions);Dragon Ball Z Westwood dub's credits by Ethan Cole in Chinook Animation's dub of Dragon Ball GT (produced in association with Blue Water Studios);Dragon Ball GT Chinook dub's credits by Dan Woren in Bandai's English release of the video game Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout;Dragon Ball GT: Final Bout credits by British-born French actor Paul Bandey in the infamous English dubs of the movies released exclusively in the UK and the Netherlands by AB Groupe (wherein the character was referred to as \"Big Green\"), by David Gasman (who also voiced Goku in this dub) in the European dub of Dead Zone (there called In Pursuit of Garlic), vocal grunts by Ed Marcus in The History of Trunks (or Gohan and Trunks) and consistently by Christopher Sabat in Funimation's in-house dub of all Dragon Ball media.Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, and Dragon Ball Z Kai Funimation dub's credits Ray Chase voices Piccolo in the Toonami Asia broadcast of Dragon Ball Super produced by Bang Zoom!

He also possesses an attack called the , which is fired with one hand being supported by the other. One of Piccolo's most powerful attacks is the an attack that is expelled from Piccolo's index and middle fingers.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 1, chapter 7Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 1, chapter 8 Unlike most energy-based attacks in Dragon Ball, the potent Makank\u014dsapp\u014d pierces its targets like a drill rather than enveloping them or exploding on contact. Another attack of Piccolo's is the , which involves firing off many orbs of energy that float around the opponent. Piccolo then squeezes his hand to make all the orbs converge onto the opponent, exploding on contact. The is another of his signature attacks, being one that he teaches to his pupil Gohan. Another move Piccolo is seen to have is the which is conjured by putting his hands on his chest, gathering energy and then releasing it outwards. One of Piccolo's less frequently used techniques is the ability to fire energy rays from his eyes, which he first uses against Kuririn's energy attack during their match in the 23rd Tenka'ichi Bud\u014dkai, then later against Goku in the finals, and again when he trains Gohan. Piccolo can also perform a type of fusion which he does with Nail on planet Namek to confront Freeza and with Kami to confront the Androids, each time greatly increasing his power; the first time enough to clash toe-and-toe with Freeza's second form, and the latter he became much more powerful than an unmastered Super Saiyan. ==Appearances== === In Dragon Ball=== Introduced as the offspring and reincarnate of the demon Piccolo Daima\u014d, Piccolo Jr. plans to continue his parent's mission of world domination, and avenge his death at the hands of Goku. Piccolo enters the 23rd Tenka'ichi Bud\u014dkai under the alias .

Piccolo remains amazed with the powers from Gohan and trains him in preparation to fight against the two Saiyans who will invade Earth.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 2, chapter 12Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 1, chapter 10 Early in their training, Piccolo destroys the moon to prevent Gohan from transforming into an Oozaru and removes his tail. As the year goes by, Piccolo starts to change as he spends time training Gohan, slowly beginning to bond with him. Kami himself comes to notice Piccolo's change of heart as well. When the Saiyans arrive a year later, Piccolo discovers his heritage from them. Piccolo tries to capitalize on Gohan's increased strength but cannot due to the child's fear, convincing him to withdraw Gohan from the battle and is knocked unconscious by Nappa after trying to weaken him. Piccolo saves Kuririn from being finished off by one of Nappa's attacks. Vegeta senses that Goku is close by, stronger and could pose a challenge with the others involved and thereby orders their speedy execution. Nappa then unleashes another one of his attacks, this time aiming for Gohan. Piccolo, having come to care for the boy dearly, sacrifices himself to protect Gohan from the attack, resulting in the deaths of both himself and Kami, which results in the Dragon Balls ceasing to exist.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 3, chapter 28 Vegeta is initially unable to activate the Oozaru transformation during his fight with Goku thanks to Piccolo's earlier deed. After the Saiyans are defeated, Gohan and the survivors travel to Piccolo's homeworld, Namek, to revive those who died against the Saiyans with the Namekian Dragon Balls. In the meantime, Piccolo trains in the afterlife with Kai\u014d-sama. Piccolo is resurrected on planet Namek to help Goku and others defeat the evil Freeza. He takes this time to merge with the beaten Namekian called , giving Piccolo a power increase.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 9, chapter 101 Despite his massive power increase and going head to head with Freeza's second transformation,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 9, chapter 106 Freeza transforms and Piccolo is defeated. After Freeza reaches his final form and immediately kills Dende afterward to prevent him from healing the group, Piccolo, Gohan and Kuririn attack him to no avail. In Freeza's following fight with Goku, who tries charging a Genki-dama to defeat him, Piccolo is given the remaining energy of both Gohan and Kuririn, allowing him to stall for a short time. Once Freeza emerges from the impact of the Genki-dama unscathed, Piccolo is severely injured by Freeza with a shot to the chest, leaving Goku to defeat Freeza alone. Piccolo is taken from the battlefield by Gohan at the warning of Goku, as his death would render the Dragon Balls ineffective once more. Piccolo is later teleported off the planet to safety on Earth and after regaining consciousness, declines to return to a new version of Namek as he wishes to protect Gohan and become stronger while remaining on Earth. After Freeza's death, Piccolo trains with Goku and Gohan for three years to prepare for a battle against two powerful Androids created by the Red Ribbon Army's Dr. Gero to kill Goku. Piccolo tries to intervene during Goku's battle with Android 19, but is shot down by Dr. Gero, revealed to have faked being injured to lower the guard of the Androids. Though he manages to best Dr. Gero in battle, he is unable to prevent him from activating the other Androids. After being defeated by Android 17 and Android 18, Piccolo seeks to unite with Kami, and gain another massive increase in power. After uniting with Kami, Piccolo becomes aware of a more dangerous threat named Cell, who volunteers information on himself when believing he has bested Piccolo (oblivious to Piccolo's regenerative abilities) when in reality the latter was pretending to be defeated in order to find out Cell's origin. Before his second encounter with Cell, Piccolo once again battles the Androids, except this time he battles #17 one on one.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 15, chapter 173 After a somewhat even match, Cell arrives on the battle scene; Cell needs to absorb the Androids to complete his power.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 15, chapter 174 While trying to prevent this, Piccolo is nearly killed by Cell,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 15, chapter 176 surviving the encounter thanks to his regenerative abilities and following some training in the Room of Spirit and Time, he is forced to participate in a tournament created by Cell called the Cell Games, where he fights one of the seven Cell Juniors that are created by Cell,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 213 who are later destroyed by Gohan.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 18, chapter 214 Piccolo laments that he cannot assist Gohan in his battle against Cell due to his lack of power, lauding Vegeta for helping Gohan after Cell's death and making the lookout his permanent residence.*Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 19, chapter 223 * Seven years later, Piccolo is poised to fight Kai\u014d-shin at the 25th Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai, forfeiting the match after finding himself reluctant to fightDragon Ball Z manga, volume 21, chapter 246 and journeying with him to confront Babidi, being turned into stone by Dabura.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 22, chapter 253 After being freed upon Dabura's death,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 23, chapter 270 he attempts to kill Babidi. Piccolo discovers Babidi survived the attempt on his life when he goes to pay respects to the now deceased Vegeta, and Babidi later demands Piccolo be brought forward or humans will die in the meantime. Piccolo plans on giving himself up until Goku talks him out of it, citing his need of his teachings. Piccolo then acts as a trainer to Goten and Trunks and their fused form Gotenks. Piccolo trains the boys in fighting the evil creature Majin Buu, who finds them and the other heroes. Piccolo tries negotiating with Buu to give the group more time to conjure a fighter strong enough to combat him, Buu agreeing to an hour, which Piccolo uses to give Goten and Trunks half a month in the Room of Spirit and Time. During Gotenks' fight with Buu, Piccolo seals them within the Room of Spirit and Time when he destroys the entrance after Gotenks lies that he has no moves left. Gotenks uses his Super Saiyan 3 form's shouting to create an exit for Piccolo and himself, allowing them to return to Earth. After more unsuccessful attempts to kill Buu, he is later absorbed by Buu along with Gotenks and Gohan and incorporated into his being. He is later freed by Goku and Vegeta,Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 26, chapter 313 and he later gives his energy to Goku's Genki-Dama attack, which Goku uses to defeat Buu once and for all.Dragon Ball Z manga, volume 26, chapter 322 === In Toriyama's films and Dragon Ball Super === Piccolo appears in eleven Dragon Ball Z films; in the first movie, Piccolo aids in stopping Garlic Jr.'s plot after having been attacked by his minions, wanting revenge;Dragon Ball Z: Dead Zone in the second, Piccolo is brainwashed by Dr. Wheelo and made to combat the others until Gohan frees him by destroying the machinery associated with his brainwashing;Dragon Ball Z: The World's Strongest in the third, Piccolo comes to save Gohan from Turles and succeeds by taking a blast for him;Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might in the fourth, Piccolo combats Lord Slug and discovers that Namekians are weak to whistling, allowing for his defeat;Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug in the fifth, Piccolo is able to defeat most of Cooler's squadron, only to be defeated by Cooler himself;Dragon Ball Z: Cooler's Revenge in the sixth, Piccolo fights Cooler's minions on Namek and saves the others after they are captured;Dragon Ball Z: The Return of Cooler in the seventh, Piccolo saves Gohan from being attacked by Android 13 and battles the android in both his forms;Dragon Ball Z: Super Android 13 in the eighth, Piccolo travels to New Planet Vegeta and fights Broly, giving his energy to Goku which leads to the foe's defeat;Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan in the ninth, Piccolo comes to help the others fight Bojack and his crew;Dragon Ball Z: Bojack Unbound in the fourteenth, Piccolo combats Beerus alongside Android 18 and Tenshinhan, only to be bested;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods and, lastly, in the fifteenth, Piccolo narrowly escapes death once Freeza destroys the Earth.Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection 'F' After the events of the latter two films, Piccolo is resurrected after being killed by Freeza in the Dragon Ball Super retelling of Resurrection 'F' and agrees to train Gohan again.

In 2004, fans of the series voted him the fifth most popular character for a poll in the book Dragon Ball Forever. Piccolo has appeared in various Anime Grand Prix polls, taking high places in the category \"best male character\" in 1990, 1991 and 1992 polls. Piccolo's character has received praise and criticism by publications for various media. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment praised Piccolo's growth in Dragon Ball Z as one of the most important parts of the series, noting how he decides to train Gohan to fight Vegeta. Although Katherine Luther from About.com noted Piccolo to be one of the strongest warriors from his planet, she mentioned he has several weaknesses that make him weaker than other characters from the series, with his most notable one being his affection for Gohan. During a review of the Dragon Ball anime, Beveridge noted Piccolo to be able to perform a large number of abilities in contrast to other characters such as Goku, making the fight between both of them unbalanced. However, he found the said battle to be very entertaining despite it lasting several episodes. Tim Jones from THEM Anime Reviews found Piccolo's differences from Dragon Ball to Dragon Ball Z as one of the reasons the former show is recommendable to viewers over the later anime. While reviewing the fourth Dragon Ball Z film, Anime News Network writer Allen Drivers found Piccolo's initial scenes peacefully enough to entertain viewers. In a later film, John Sinnott from DVD Talk criticized Piccolo's involvement saying he appears \"from out of no where\" in order to fight alongside his friends giving the film little reasoning. Chris Homer from The Fandom Post believed Piccolo's sacrifice in Dragon Ball GT \"was a genuine touching moment\" for fans of Dragon Ball Z, but also viewed the death as relying \"too much on previous ideas\" in order for it to get sorted. Sam Leach from Anime News Network noted that some fans of the series tend to joke Piccolo is a better paternal figure to Gohan than his actual father, Goku, and felt that Dragon Ball Super emphasized it more when Piccolo started training him again. ===Cultural Impact=== The character has influenced Naruto manga author Masashi Kishimoto; in order to give Sasuke Uchiha a central role in the film Boruto: Naruto the Movie, Kishimoto made him the teacher of the protagonist Boruto Uzumaki as his father, Naruto Uzumaki, was busy. This was inspired by how Piccolo starts training Gohan when Goku dies in Dragon Ball. Piccolo's attack Special Beam Cannon / Makank\u014dsapp\u014d became an Internet meme which started with Japanese schoolgirls photographing themselves apparently using, and being affected by, this attack in 2013. According to gaming blog Kotaku, the trend took off after photos were posted on Japan's largest bulletin board 2channel,, with photographs typically showing one person striking the ground or making a mystical gesture while others around them are photographically captured in mid-air. ==References== Category:Animated series villains Category:Anime and manga characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Anime and manga characters who use magic Category:Anime and manga characters with accelerated healing Category:Anime and manga characters with superhuman strength Category:Anime and manga martial artists Category:Anime and manga telepaths Category:Comics characters introduced in 1988 Category:Dragon Ball characters Category:Fictional asexuals Category:Fictional characters who can change size Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves Category:Fictional characters who can stretch themselves Category:Fictional characters with energy-manipulation abilities Category:Fictional characters with slowed ageing Category:Fictional characters with superhuman senses Category:Fictional extraterrestrial characters Category:Fictional martial arts trainers Category:Fictional mentors Category:Fictional suicides Category:Fictional telepaths Category:Merged fictional characters pl:Lista postaci wyst\u0119puj\u0105cych w Dragon Ball#Piccolo Daima\u014d ",
