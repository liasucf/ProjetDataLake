With a crew of six, Roald Amundsen traversed the passage in a three-year journey, finishing in 1906.Gj\u00f8a \u2013 norsk polarskute (Store norske leksikon) == History == Gj\u00f8a, the first ship to sail through the Northwest Passage Gj\u00f8a in 1903, at the time of the Northwest Passage expedition === Construction === The square-sterned sloop of 45 net register tonnage () was built by Knut Johannesson Skaale in Rosendal, Norway in 1872, the same year Amundsen was born. She was named Gj\u00f8a after her then owner's wife. (Gj\u00f8a is a modern form of the Norse name Gy\u00f0a, in turn a nickname for Gu\u00f0fr\u00ed\u00f0r, a compound of gu\u00f0 'god' and fr\u00ed\u00f0r 'beautiful'.) For the next 28 years the vessel served as a herring fishing boat. === Purchase by Amundsen === On March 28, 1901, Amundsen bought her from Asbj\u00f8rn Sexe of Ullensvang, Norway, for his forthcoming expedition to the Arctic Ocean. Gj\u00f8a was much smaller than vessels used by other Arctic expeditions, but Amundsen intended to live off the limited resources of the land and sea through which he was to travel, and reasoned that the land could sustain only a tiny crew (this had been the cause of the catastrophic failure of John Franklin's expedition fifty years previously). Her shallow draught would help her traverse the shoals of the Arctic straits. Perhaps most importantly, the aging ship was all that Amundsen (who was financing his expedition largely by spending his inheritance) could afford. Amundsen had little experience of Arctic sailing, and so decided to undertake a training expedition before braving the Arctic ice. He engaged Hans Christian Johannsen, her previous owner, and a small crew, and sailed from Troms\u00f8 in April 1901. The next five months were spent sealing on the pack ice of the Barents Sea. Following their return to Troms\u00f8 in September, Amundsen set about remedying the deficiencies in Gj\u00f8a that the trip had exposed. He had a 13 horsepower marine paraffin motor driving a single screw installed. She had hitherto been propelled only by sail and had proved to be sluggish. Much of the winter was spent upgrading her ice sheathing; Amundsen knew she would spend several winters iced-in. === Journey through the Northwest Passage === In the spring of 1902, her refit complete, Amundsen sailed her to Christiania (now Oslo), the capital of Norway. At this time Norway was still in a union with Sweden, and Amundsen hoped the nationalistic spirit which was sweeping the country would attract sponsors willing to underwrite the expedition's growing costs. After much wrangling, and a donation from King Oscar, he succeeded. By the time Amundsen returned, Norway had gained its independence, and he and his crew were among the new country's first national heroes. Amundsen served as the expedition leader and Gj\u00f8a's master. His crew were Godfred Hansen, a Danish naval lieutenant and Gj\u00f8a's first officer; Helmer Hanssen, second officer, an experienced ice pilot who later accompanied Amundsen on subsequent expeditions; Anton Lund, an experienced sealing captain; Peder Ristvedt, chief engineer; Gustav Juel Wiik, second engineer, a gunner in the Royal Norwegian Navy; and Adolf Henrik Lindstr\u00f8m, cook.Et liv i isen: Polarkokken Adolf H. Lindstr\u00f8m (by Jan Ove Ekeberg, 2000. Kagge. Gj\u00f8a left the Oslofjord on June 16, 1903, and made for the Labrador Sea west of Greenland. From there she crossed Baffin Bay and navigated the narrow, icy straits of the Arctic Archipelago. By late September Gj\u00f8a was west of the Boothia Peninsula and began to encounter worsening weather and sea ice. Amundsen put her into a natural harbour on the south shore of King William Island; by October 3 she was iced in.Kieran Mulvaneu, At the Ends of the Earth: A History Of The Polar Regions, Island Press, 2001, p. 179, , There she remained for nearly two years, with her crew undertaking sledge journeys to make measurements to determine the location of the North Magnetic Pole and learning from the local Inuit people. The harbour, known as Uqsuqtuuq (\"much fat\") in Inuktitut, has become the only settlement on the island\u2014Gjoa Haven, Nunavut, which now has a population of over a thousand people (1,279 at the 2011 census).Statistics Canada. 2012.

Gj\u00f8a arrives in Nome, August 1906 Gj\u00f8a left Gjoa Haven on August 13, 1905, and motored through the treacherous straits south of Victoria Island, and from there west into the Beaufort Sea. By October Gj\u00f8a was again iced-in, this time near Herschel Island in the Yukon. Amundsen left his men on board and spent much of the winter skiing 500 miles south to Eagle, Alaska to telegraph news of the expedition's success. He returned in March, but Gj\u00f8a remained icebound until July 11. Gj\u00f8a reached Nome on August 31, 1906. She sailed on to earthquake ravaged San Francisco, California, where the expedition was met with a hero's welcome on October 19. === San Francisco: deterioration and restoration === Rather than sail her round Cape Horn and back to Norway, the Norwegian American community in San Francisco prevailed on Amundsen to sell her to them. The ship was donated to the city of San Francisco, and the ship was dragged up the beachRoald Amundsen Marker -Historical Marker DatabaseThe Gjoa \u2013 Western Neighborhoods Project \u2013 San Francisco History \u2013 The Roald Amundsen Monument \u2013 Or The Ship That Isn't There100 years since \"Gj\u00f8a\" arrived in San Francisco \u2013 Norwegian Consulate General San Francisco to the northwest corner of Golden Gate Park, surrounded by low fence and put on display. Amundsen knew that because of the notoriety that his exploits aboard Gj\u00f8a had earned, he would be able gain access to Nansen's ship Fram which had been custom-built for ice work and was owned by the Norwegian state. Therefore, Amundsen left Gj\u00f8a in San Francisco. He and his crew traveled back to Norway by commercial ship. Of the original expedition members, only Wiik failed to return to Norway, since he had died of illness during the third Arctic winter. == Preservation == Gj\u00f8a at the Norwegian Maritime Museum in Oslo Over the following decades Gj\u00f8a slowly deteriorated, and by 1939 she was in poor condition. Refurbishment was delayed by World War II, and repairs were not completed until 1949. Being displayed outdoors and having faced 66 years of high winds, ocean salt and sand, the boat once again suffered deterioration, until in 1972, with the help of Erik Krag, a Danish American shipping company owner of San Francisco, Gj\u00f8a was returned to Norway. Erik Krag was knighted by the King of Norway for his efforts in shipping home Gj\u00f8a.100 years since \"Gj\u00f8a\" arrived in San Francisco (Norwegian Consulate General San Francisco \u2013 norway.org) The Gj\u00f8a was displayed in the Norwegian Maritime Museum (Norwegian: Norsk Maritimt Museum) in Bygd\u00f8y, Oslo. In May 2009 the Norwegian Maritime Museum and the Fram Museum (Norwegian: Frammuseet) signed an agreement for the Fram Museum of Bygd\u00f8y to take over the exhibition of the Gj\u00f8a. It is currently displayed in a separate building at Fram Museum. A bauta (memorial pillar) now stands near Gj\u00f8a's former home in San Francisco.Gjoa Monument | Atlas Obscura The Gj\u00f8a was also featured as a filming location in the 2005 documentary, The Search for the Northwest Passage, in which K\u00e5re Conradi played Amundsen. ==See also== * Arctic exploration * Hendrick van der Heul ==Sources== * Roald Amundsen told the story of the exploration of the Norwest Passage in two volumes entitled Die Nordwestpassage.
