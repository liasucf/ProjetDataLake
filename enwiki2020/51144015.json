Yusuf was said to have accepted bribe after two investigative reporters approached him to include two footballers in his squad at the 2018 African Championship (CHAN).

Salisu Yusuf subsequently denied any wrongdoing, stating that the inducement did not affect his decision to field the players. In November 2019 he became manager of Rangers International. ==Honours== *Nigerian FA Cup: 2003, 2013 *Nigeria Premier League: 2008 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:People from Kaduna State Category:Association football midfielders Category:Nigerian footballers Category:Enyimba International F.C. managers Category:Nigerian football managers Category:Nigeria national football team managers ",
