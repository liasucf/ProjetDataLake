It is the second album to appear in Zorn's Music Romance Series following Music for Children (1998).Tzadik catalogue Three of the tracks on this recording (Mayim, Zera'im, and Makkot) are from Zorn's Masada songbook.Masada World: Taboo & Exile, accessed January 6, 2020 ==Reception== The AllMusic review by Stacia Proefrock awarded the album 3\u00bd stars stating \"This is not a piece of classical movements; rather, it is like a film with constantly changing scenes. Before the end of the album, images are evoked of slow, metered tribal ritual, escape on an open road, cabaret, desert and dance. This is one of Zorn's most complex and beautiful pieces, showing that he is still constantly evolving as a composer.\"Proefrock, S.
