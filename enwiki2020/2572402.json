    "text": "Sigabong (loud explosion) is the longest-running rock extravaganza in Iloilo City, Philippines, which showcases local rock talents. The battle of the bands is held every first week of February just after the Dinagyang festival has been concluded. The history of the event dates back to 1988, which during that time was called Sigabong:\"the Clash\", thus, succeeding events were named \"the Clash 2\", \"the Clash 3\" and so on and so forth. The original \"Sigabong\" was first organized in 1975 not as a band competition but was just an ordinary night of rock and roll. It was joined by several amateur bands in the Province of Iloilo. This eventful annual celebration in Iloilo is being organized by the UP Hamili Brotherhood and UP Hamilia Sisterhood. Ever since its inception, it has established itself as the critically acclaimed number-one rock band competition in western Visayas. Through the years, \"Sigabong\" has achieved a lot of attention and followers not only in the Panay Islands but the whole country. ==Champions== *2017. A Shadow's Promise *2016. Trauma *2015.
