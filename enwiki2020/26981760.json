Abreu spent a lifetime studying languages. He travelled to Brazil and went on several journeys to Portuguese colonies in India. He was particularly interested in the ancient language of Sanskrit. He was involved with redesigning the Portuguese language in terms of its spelling. One of his students, Aniceto dos Reis Gon\u00e7alves Viana, led the commission that advised on how the spelling of Portuguese should be reformed.Aniceto dos Reis Gon\u00e7alves Viana, cvc.instituto-camoes.pt. Retrieved April 2010. This change was successfully made, but created a rift with Brazil who continued to use the traditional spelling. He was elected to the Portuguese Academy of Sciences on 9 February 1887.ACADEMIA DAS CI\u00caNCIAS DE LISBOA. Retrieved April 2010. A book he wrote in 1902 consisted of translations from ancient books, including the Sutta-pitaka, Ramayana and the Mahabharata.
