He was equally powerful as the P\u0159emyslid dynasty in his time, for example, he was able to mint his own money. When he was in Germany, the P\u0159emyslids massacred his family. Then Sob\u011bslav went to Boleslav the Brave to obtain sanctuary in Poland. In 1004, Sob\u011bslav led the Charv\u00e1ts tribe and died on a bridge over the Vltava river in Prague, when Polish troops tried to occupy the city. ==Notes== Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1004 deaths Category:10th-century rulers in Europe Category:10th-century Bohemian people Category:11th-century rulers in Europe Category:11th-century Bohemian people Category:Slavn\u00edk dynasty ",
