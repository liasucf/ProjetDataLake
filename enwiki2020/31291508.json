    "text": "AD-1211 is an opioid analgesic drug invented in the 1970s by Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. It is chemically a 1-substituted-4-prenyl-piperazine derivative, which is structurally unrelated to most other opioid drugs. The (S)-enantiomers in this series are more active as opioid agonists, but the less active (R)-enantiomer of this compound, AD-1211, is a mixed agonist\u2013antagonist at opioid receptors with a similar pharmacological profile to pentazocine, and has atypical opioid effects with little development of tolerance or dependence seen after extended administration in animal studies. ==See also== * Diphenidine * Diphenpipenol * Ephenidine * Fluorolintane * Lanicemine * Lefetamine * Methoxphenidine (MXP) * MT-45 * Remacemide * AH-7921 == References == Category:Synthetic opioids Category:Piperazines Category:Mu- opioid agonists Category:Diarylethylamines Category:Designer drugs ",
