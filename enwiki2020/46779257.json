He moved to Rome in 1865 in order to commence his studies for the priesthood. He underwent philosophical studies under the Dominicans at the Collegio Angelico, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome.

He made his final profession in 1868 and assumed the name of \"Placido\". As a deacon on 5 November 1870 he was arrested due to the fact that he dodged conscription and he was imprisoned in Florence and then sent as a soldier in Livorno after his release from prison on 24 December 1870. After that debacle he returned to Rome to resume his studies. He was ordained to the priesthood on 25 March 1871. His students included the future cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster.

He served as a spiritual director in Perugia from 1882 and served as a rector to the Benedictines in Rome in 1887. He served as the rector of the Basilica of Santa Maria di Farfa in Rome in 1894 and lived in hermitage near San Fiano. He served as a confessor to a convent of Poor Clares he lived near. He died on 25 March 1915 in Rome at the church of San Paolo fuori le Mura. ==Beatification== The beatification process commenced in Rome on 3 March 1935 under Pope Pius XI and the two local process ensured.
