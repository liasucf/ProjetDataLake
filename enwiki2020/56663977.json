In the second season of intercollegiate football at the pre-flight school, the team compiled a 9\u20131 record, outscored opponents by a total of 277 to 98, and was ranked No. 2 in the final AP Poll. In July 1943, Don Faurot\u2014previously the head football coach at Missouri and recently enlisted in the Navy with a rank of lieutenant\u2014was assigned to take over from Bernie Bierman as the team's head coach. Upon arriving in Iowa City in August, 100 candidates tried out at Faurot's first football practice session. Faurot said he would use a T formation and promised at the time that \"we will have a fighting squad and a fighting team.\" Four Iowa Pre-Flight players were named to the Associated Press' 1943 AP Service All-America team. Center Vince Banonis and back Dick Todd were named to the first team. End Perry Schwartz and guard Nick Kerasiotis were named to the second team. ==Schedule== ==Rankings== ==Roster== Players who started at least half of the games are shown in bold.Statistics for games started based on box scores from each game, as reflected in game coverage cited above. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
