    "text": "Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) () was formed on 1 April 2019 and is responsible for managing and promoting the National Forest Estate in Scotland. The national forest estate owned by FLS covers 6,400 km2, being roughly 8 % of the land area of Scotland. Around two-thirds of this land is forested, with the remaining land consisting of a mixture of agricultural land and open areas such as moorland. As of January 2020 there were 307 individual forests listed on the FLS website; there are also 6 designated forest parks. ==List of Forests== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\" |- ! scope=\"col\" width=\"20%\" | Name ! scope=\"col\" width=\"15%\" | Location ! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" | Size (hectares) ! scope=\"col\" width=\"55% | Description ! scope=\"col\" width=\"5%\" | References |- |Aberfoyle Forest |Stirling | |Part of the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park. | |- |Achnabreac |Argyll and Bute | |An area of open woodland close to the prehistoric sites of Kilmartin Glen. | |- |Achnashellach Forest |Highland |1,535 |Achnashellach Forest does not have recreational facilities that many other FLS forests have.
