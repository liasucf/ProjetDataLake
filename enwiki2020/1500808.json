    "text": "Libby Kennedy (also Kennedy-Fitzgerald) is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Kym Valentine. She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 3 October 1994. Valentine auditioned for the role when she was 15, and upon being cast as Libby, she relocated from Sydney to Melbourne, where the show is filmed. Libby was introduced along with her parents and brothers during a period of low ratings for the show. Valentine departed on 5 November 2004, returning briefly for a single episode on 27 July 2005, before returning on 12 November 2007. Libby's storylines have included being involved in a motorbike accident, the loss of her husband Drew Kirk, giving birth to Ben Kirk, marrying Daniel Fitzgerald and subsequently separating from him. In 2008, Valentine was forced to take sick leave for one month and executive producer, Susan Bower, made the decision to temporarily recast McLeod's Daughters actress Michala Banas in the role for a month. Valentine took temporary leave from Neighbours in 2010 due to ill health. A few months later, Valentine took indefinite leave from Neighbours to focus on her health and Libby made an off-screen departure on 26 May 2011. Valentine reprised the role for a three-week guest appearance in June 2014. ==Creation and casting== In 1994, Neighbours' storyliners decided to introduce the \"solid\" Kennedy family. They felt that they needed to take the show back to its roots when it seemed that all the houses on Ramsay Street were populated with misfits and distant relatives. The show was also suffering from low ratings, and the Kennedys were brought in to \"bring a fresh burst of energy\". Alan Fletcher and Jackie Woodburne were cast as Karl Kennedy and Susan Kennedy, with Benjamin McNair and Jesse Spencer cast as brothers Malcolm Kennedy and Billy Kennedy. The role of the Kennedy's daughter went to actress Kym Valentine. She first auditioned for the role of Libby when she was 15 in her home town of Sydney. She recalled: \"I'd been in Home and Away, and in a sitcom called My Two Wives, but Neighbours was a much bigger thing. For starters, it is filmed in Melbourne, so getting the part meant that I had to move there. I didn't know anyone at all, so it was pretty terrifying.\" Valentine began working on Neighbours when she was 17. She admitted that leaving her family behind in Sydney was the hardest part about joining the show, but she \"seized\" the role of Libby and was determined to be a success. The Kennedys were described as a believable family, and Valentine thought it down to the actors' close bond off-screen. She said they were \"like a surrogate family to me, and still are.\" Discussing her longevity in 2000, Valentine explained that she stayed with Neighbours as it provided her with work, and she felt she was still learning and being challenged by the role. ==Character development== ===Characterisation=== Upon her introduction to Neighbours, Libby was described as an opinionated girl who makes a stand on \"any and every issue.\" She is as a communist and her political views frustrate her father. She initially wants to go into a government job, but she studies journalism at university instead. The teenage Libby was said to be bright, inquisitive and \"prim and proper.\" Her \"wise beyond her years\" side has followed her into adulthood and Libby is now a \"passionate and idealistic\" woman. She is hard working, honest, headstong and focused on her career and life goals. Libby has a humorous and quirky side, which Valentine loves acting out. The BBC said \"there's no keeping that irrepressible sense of humour down. She loves a good laugh.\" On Valentine's return to the Neighbours set in January 2011, she decided to cut her long hair off in favour of a short hairstyle. It was also revealed that Libby would return with a new attitude to life. She has spent time at a health retreat, learnt the \"art of Zen\" and now refuses to judge anyone. Valentine said that Libby wants \"to detach from negativity.\" She added \"She looks at her situation \u2013 single mum, still living with her parents \u2013 and starts to focus on her career at the school.\" ===Departure and return=== Valentine decided to depart Neighbours in 2004, so she could pursue other acting roles and spend time with her daughter. However, she did make a brief return in 2005 for the show's 20th anniversary episode, \"Friends for Twenty Years\". In 2007, Neighbours suffered a decline in ratings and plans were made to take storylines \"back to basics\", so they would be less controversial and focus more on relationships and family dynamics. It was then announced that Valentine would be reprising her role of Libby. Of her comeback Valentine said \"I really felt like I was coming home and it was very easy to slip back into the role of Libby, she's like an old friend. Plus she was older and the writers were able to do a lot more with her so it was a great time to return.\" Valentine initially intended to return to Neighbours for a brief time. ===Temporary recast=== On 4 July 2008, Valentine collapsed on a flight home from New York and was diagnosed with pneumonia and a collapsed lung. Valentine was told that she needed to rest for a month and that she could not return to work on Neighbours. news.com.au initially reported that Libby would be written out of scenes for a week. However, as the character was involved in too many storylines, executive producer Susan Bower, realised that she could not be suddenly written out of the show and she took the decision to temporarily recast the role of Libby. Bower called McLeod's Daughters actress Michala Banas and asked her to take over the role. Banas only had four days to research Libby's history on the show and learn the scripts before she began filming. Banas told the Herald Sun \"It was crazy, a whirlwind. I spent the first week of filming really stressing about it \u2013 am I doing this right, is this what Libby would do, am I making the right choices? I felt this real sense of responsibility to Kym and to the character and to the show. I just wanted to do the best job I could for everyone.\" Banas explained that Libby is a strong woman with a lot of energy and she tried to keep the essence of the character in her portrayal. However, she said that the only way she could \"tackle\" the role was to make Libby her own. She added \"I came to the realisation that I can't be the same Libby as Kym is \u2013 it's impossible.\" Banas was reunited with Brett Tucker, her co-star from McLeod's Daughters, for Libby's storylines. Of her character being recast, Valentine said \"It is like handing over a child to be looked after by somebody else\". She later returned to the set on 15 September 2008. In May 2009, a short video was created which made light of the recast. The clip, featuring Valentine, Fletcher and Woodburne, saw Susan and Karl questioning Libby over why she changed her head. ===Marriage to Daniel Fitzgerald and surrogacy=== Libby's relationship with Darren Stark (Todd MacDonald) comes to an abrupt end after he kisses Janae Timmins (Eliza Taylor-Cotter), but Libby soon finds romance again with Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker). Valentine told TV Week that Libby decides that she has had enough of Darren and their relationship is over for good. Then over the next few months there is a hint of romance for Libby and Dan. Tucker said that there is \"an immediate attraction\" for Dan when it comes to Libby. Dan hides some secrets from Libby and when she discovers them, there is \"an emotional upset.\" Valentine explained \"Libby will begin to feel like she's being constantly let down by men. She can't seem to take a trick. Guys just keep disappointing her.\" Tucker added that it was never planned for Libby and Dan to have a trouble free relationship, although he previously thought otherwise. When she was asked to choose between Dan and Drew, Valentine chose Dan and she explained \"I do honestly think that Dan is more her match. [...] I just think Dan and Libby are very similar like with their careers \u2013 they've got a lot more in common, they're both teachers and they're both very articulate and educated. I think maybe Libby and Dan can entertain each other a little bit more, in many different ways, than Libby and Drew could.\" Libby and Dan's relationship does not run smoothly and Dan's ex-wife Samantha (Simone Buchanan) causes problems for them. Sam lies to Dan that she is pregnant with his child and when the lie is exposed, Libby sees Dan is upset that he does not have a child. Valentine told Digital Spy; \"when Libby sees how upset Dan is about it all, she desperately wants him to have his own child. So for the next few months, we've got this long-term storyline based around Libby wanting to have a baby with Dan which we all know is incredibly risky because she could die if she has another baby.\" Libby and Dan later marry. During an interview, Susan Bower said that there is nothing interesting in watching an on-screen marriage that is working and she highlighted her plans for the couple; \"It's a very, very slow, long burn and there's some wonderful humour and the fact there's the Brady Bunch a bit. We are making stories about what happens in people's lives and there's the good and the bad.\" Libby and Dan decide to have a child via surrogacy. Libby's mother, Susan offers to become the surrogate after Libby is unable have any more children. Following a fight with the hospital board, Susan becomes pregnant. However, this causes friction between her and Dan. Following a fall, Susan loses the baby. Alan Fletcher said he was pleased at the way the surrogacy scenes were handled and he added \"The notion of a mother being a surrogate for their daughter is something you can't pretend is not controversial. The writers embraced that and showed how Susan's decision divided the community, and has potential to divide the family\". The show's timeslot presented difficulties for the storyline and the writers were forced to tone the plot down to comply with guidelines. The surrogacy saga puts pressure on Libby and Dan's marriage and it falls apart. Valentine drew on her own experience of going through a divorce to film the scenes. She revealed that she was \"really really proud\" of how they portrayed the end of Libby and Dan's marriage and she said that she put her \"heart and soul\" into the storyline. She added \"It was the most intimate storyline I've ever done in my life. I got the chance to really exorcise some demons.\" ===Second departure and return=== In 2010, Valentine took three months off from Neighbours due to ill health. In July of that year, she spent a week in hospital with a lung problem and in December she checked herself into a clinic as she was suffering from exhaustion. Valentine said \"I'm very grateful to the producers for allowing me time off to get healthy again and this year is already looking fantastic.\" Valentine returned to the set in January 2011. A few months after her return to filming, Valentine took indefinite leave from Neighbours. Fiona Byrne of the Herald Sun reported the actress was undergoing treatment in hospital for a depressive illness. Susan Bower said Valentine had the support of the production team and her character would be written out of the show in a \"nice and neat way.\" Byrne added \"It has been done so when she is ready to return she (Libby) can walk straight back into the show.\" Byrne's colleague, Luke Dennehy reported Valentine's contract was up for renewal at the end of 2011. In September 2011, Byrne said Valentine was unlikely to return to Neighbours, though this was not confirmed by the show. On 11 March 2014, it was announced that Valentine would be returning to Neighbours as part of a storyline to celebrate 20 years of Karl and Susan Kennedy. The actress will film a three-week guest appearance. Valentine's return comes a few months after she filed a complaint against FremantleMedia. She told Sarah Thomas from The Sydney Morning Herald, \"I'm really looking forward to catching up with old friends at Neighbours as well as getting to know many of the new cast. Playing Libby was a very important part of my life and I can't wait to reintroduce audiences to her.\" Libby returned on 11 June 2014. ==Storylines== ===1994\u20132005=== Following her arrival, Libby meets Brett Stark (Brett Blewitt) and they become best friends.

The books were available to buy at some Australia Post outlets and on the internet. Libby and Darren Stark were the focus of one of the books entitled Facing Tomorrow. It explains what happened after the couple left Erinsborough in 2004 and followed their new life together. Of the books, a spokeswoman said \"It's different to what happens in the show; it's more like a fantasy of what happens, might have happened, in the show, they would take about an hour to read if you're a quick reader\". ==Reception== For her portrayal of Libby, Valentine has earned various awards nominations. In 2008, she was nominated for Sexiest Female at the Inside Soap Awards. The following year she received a nomination for Best Actress and in 2010 was nominated for Best Daytime Star. Libby and Susan's surrogacy storyline was nominated for Best Baby Drama at the 2010 All About Soap Bubble Awards. In June 2002, Libby came third in a poll run by Newsround to find viewer's favourite Neighbours character. She received 19.33% of the vote. In January 2009, Ruth Deller, of television website Lowculture included Libby in her monthly list of best and worst soap characters. Libby was placed at number ten on the worst characters list. Deller said \"Libby's always had the tendency to be a bit smug and self-absorbed, but she's taking it to ridiculous levels at the moment. And her and Fitzy (or her and Lucas) is clearly a wrong thing indeed\". Virgin Media compiled a list of their sexiest soap couples, Libby and Dan were featured and they stated that they believed the couple were a \"match made in soap heaven\" and that \"nothing can stand in the way of their love apart from Sam\". Soap opera reporting website Holy Soap opined that Libby's most memorable moment was collapsing at her wedding, finding out she was pregnant and subsequently losing the baby. To celebrate Neighbours' 25th anniversary Sky, a British satellite broadcasting company profiled 25 characters of which they believed were the most memorable in the series history. Libby is in the list and describing her they state: \"When Libby first joined the programme, she seemed to spend most of her time trying to out-do Ruth Wilkinson in the ugly short-wearing stakes. Then she got all curvy sexy, and as an adult Libby has seen three of the hottest Ds in the Greater Erinsborough area: Darren, Drew and Dan. Her feisty newshound days are long behind her too as she's become a teacher, which apparently in Australia requires no formal training. Interesting.\" British newspaper, The Guardian, included Libby in a feature called \"Soaps' most bizarre recasts\". Of the character's temporary recast, they said \"A staple of Neighbours since 1994, we've watched Libby Kennedy get married, get widowed, get married again, get divorced and \u2013 for one confusing month \u2013 turn into a completely different person. They added that the recast was the \"most confusing Neighbours moment since that time Bouncer got married in his dreams\". British weekly magazine NOW compiled a special gallery to decide whether Libby was best played by Valentine or Banas. They describe Libby has never having any luck in her love life and since Drew's death has been doomed it's got worse. In June 2014, Kerry Barrett from All About Soap was pleased to see Libby return, saying \"We were just as thrilled as the Kennedys were to see lovely Lib back in Erinsborough. And when Karl asked if she had anything to go home to, we thought how brilliant it would be if she stayed.\" ==References== ==External links== * Libby Kennedy on the Official AU Neighbours website * Libby Kennedy on the Official UK Neighbours website Category:Neighbours characters Category:Fictional schoolteachers Category:Television characters introduced in 1994 Category:Kennedy family (Neighbours) Category:Female characters in television ",
