    "text": "Heligolandic (Halunder) is the dialect of the North Frisian language spoken on the German island of Heligoland in the North Sea.W. B. Lockwood, A Panorama of Indo-European Languages, London: Hutchison University Library, 1972, p. 107 It is spoken today by some 500 of the island's 1,650 inhabitants and is also taught in schools. Heligolandic is closely related to the insular North Frisian dialects of Fering and \u00d6\u00f6mrang because medieval fishery around Heligoland attracted Frisians from F\u00f6hr and Amrum, and close contacts have been maintained ever since. In fact Fering and \u00d6\u00f6mrang are closer in linguistic aspects to the dialect of Heligoland than to that of their neighbouring island Sylt, S\u00f6l'ring. Heligolandic also contains a variety of loanwords from 19th-century Modern English due to the 83-year British control of the island. James Kr\u00fcss is probably the most notable author of poems and narrations in Heligolandic while Maria Leitgeber (1906\u20131979) wrote the most substantial prose. On 24 December 2004, a state law became effective in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein that recognises the North Frisian language for official use in the Nordfriesland district and on Heligoland. ==References== == See also == * North Frisian (insular) * Frisian languages Category:North Frisian language Category:Heligoland ",
