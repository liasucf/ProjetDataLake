Some ladies burned the bails and placed the resultant ashes in a small urn. This was presented to England's captain, Ivo Bligh, who had promised to \"recover those ashes\". The urn is kept in a glass case at Lord's but England and Australia have been playing for the Ashes ever since. * 25 May \u2013 Surrey, in a season that marked their revival from a lowly position since 1866 to the champion eleven of the late 1880s and early 1890s, break the record highest team total in county cricket by scoring 650 against Hampshire.Webber, Roy; The Playfair Book of Cricket Records; p. 18. Published 1951 by Playfair Books. * George Harrison became the first bowler to take 100 wickets in the season in which he made his debut in first-class cricket.Webber; The Playfair Book of Cricket Records; pp. 176\u2013177 * George Ulyett scored 1,562 runs with a highest score of 84. Not until Charles Harris in 1935 did a player scoring no centuries score more runs in a season. ** Ulyett's feat of getting within eleven runs of the leading scorer with no centuries has been approached since only by David Green in 1965.First Class Batting in England in 1883 (by Runs)First Class Batting in England in 1965 (by Runs) ==Notes== An unofficial seasonal title sometimes proclaimed by consensus of media and historians prior to December 1889 when the official County Championship was constituted. Although there are ante- dated claims prior to 1873, when residence qualifications were introduced, it is only since that ruling that any quasi-official status can be ascribed. ==References== ==Annual reviews== * John Lillywhite's Cricketer's Companion (Green Lilly), Lillywhite, 1884 * James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual (Red Lilly), Lillywhite, 1884 * John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack, 1884 ==External links== * CricketArchive - season summaries Category:1883 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1864 to 1889 ",
