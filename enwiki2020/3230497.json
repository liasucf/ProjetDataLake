    "text": "The initial seat distribution of the 19th Canadian Parliament William Lyon Mackenzie King was Prime Minister during the 18th Canadian Parliament. The 19th Canadian Parliament was in session from May 16, 1940, until April 16, 1945. The membership was set by the 1940 federal election on March 26, 1940, and it changed only somewhat due to resignations and by-elections until it was dissolved prior to the 1945 election. It was controlled by a Liberal Party majority under Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and the 16th Canadian Ministry. The Official Opposition was the so-called \"National Government\" party (the name which the Conservatives ran under in the 1940 election), led in the House by Richard Hanson and Gordon Graydon consecutively as the three successive national leaders of the party, Robert Manion, Arthur Meighen and John Bracken did not have seats in the House of Commons. With the selection of Bracken as national leader in December 1942, the party became known as the Progressive Conservatives. The Speaker was James Allison Glen. See also List of Canadian electoral districts 1933-1947 for a list of the ridings in this parliament. There were six sessions of the 19th Parliament: {|class=\"wikitable\" !Session !Start !End |- | 1st | May 16, 1940 | November 5, 1940 |- | 2nd | November 7, 1940 | January 21, 1942 |- | 3rd | January 22, 1942 | January 27, 1943 |- | 4th | January 28, 1943 | January 26, 1944 |- | 5th | January 27, 1944 | January 31, 1945 |- | 6th | March 19, 1945 | April 16, 1945 |} == List of members == Following is a full list of members of the nineteenth Parliament listed first by province, then by electoral district.
