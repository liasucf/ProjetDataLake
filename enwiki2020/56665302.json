Some video releases were retitled The Man in the Steel Mask or Roboman. ==Plot== An enigmatic individual with a metal face is returned from East Germany and claims to be Lucas Martino, an American scientist who was working on a top-secret project but was severely injured and scarred in a car crash. American authorities hold him in custody while they try to establish whether the man is the real Martino \u2013 or an impostor. ==Cast== *Elliott Gould as Sean Rogers *Trevor Howard as Colonel Azarin *Joseph Bova as Lucas Martino ==Release== Although one 1983 British source stated that the film was shelved for five years after its completion in 1974, contemporary sources indicate the film was screened theatrically in the U.S. in 1975, and broadcast on British television in 1976. ==Reception== Contemporary U.S. reviews were mixed to negative. The Iowa Gazette described it as \"distinctly average but better than mediocre\". The Kentucky Courier-Journal dismissed it as a \"clinker\", calling it an \"inane... funereal mess\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:1974 films Category:1970s science fiction films Category:British science fiction films Category:Allied Artists films Category:1970s mystery films Category:Films based on science fiction novels Category:Films directed by Jack Gold Category:Films scored by John Cameron Category:British mystery films Category:British films Category:British Lion Films films Category:Films based on American novels ",
