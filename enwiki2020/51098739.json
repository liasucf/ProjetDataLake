She became member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong for New Territories East in 2016. ==Early life== Yung was born in Hong Kong in 1977 and was educated at St. Francis' Canossian College and Rosaryhill School. She went on to study computer science at the University of British Columbia (UBC) and graduated in 2001. Unsuccessful in her bid to begin her chosen career as a gaming programmer, she stayed on as a research assistant and helped develop a journal research programme at UBC. After she returned to Hong Kong in the summer of 2003, she studied law at the City University of Hong Kong and qualified as a barrister in 2008. ==Political career== Yung became a volunteer legal consultant of the New Home Association, a pro-Beijing non- governmental organisation that helps mainland Chinese immigrants and ethnic minorities integrate into Hong Kong society. She was also founding member of the Hong Kong Professionals and Senior Executives Association, a pro-Beijing professionals' association where she broadened her social circle by meeting with political and business figures. In 2015, she founded the Youth and Professional Network to help young people with start-ups. Yung joined Civil Force (CF), a pro-Beijing Sha Tin-based political group that formed an alliance with the New People's Party (NPP) in February 2014, effecting the expansion of Regina Ip's party from Hong Kong Island to New Territories East. In 2016, Yung became the NPP\u2013CF candidate in the Legislative Council election, leading a seven-member ticket in New Territories East and won a seat with 36,183 votes. ==Political views== In securing her Legislative Council seat, Yung is widely considered to have received support from the central government's liaison office based in Sai Wan, with which she has confessed a \"working relationship\", earning her the nickname, \"Goddaughter of Sai Wan\". She is best known for her interest in the promotion of e-sports and her statement that \"there should not be too much politics inside or outside of the legislature\". She considers Regina Ip her political mentor. In May 2018, Eunice Yung caused controversy by stating that domestic workers in Hong Kong often gather in large groups in public areas, thus they affect the hygiene and daily lives of other members of the public and nearby shops. She suggested the government should segregate them by providing additional activity centres for them. Several groups representing Hong Kong\u2019s domestic workers including The International Migrants Alliance, Asian Migrants Coordinating Body and Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions condemned the remarks as racist against migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong, saying it contributed to discrimination against ethnic minorities.https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/05/24/group-slams- lawmaker-saying-hygiene-issues-arise-domestic-workers-public- gatherings/http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/community/article/2147803/hong- kongs-foreign-domestic-workers-plan-protest-march-over A few days later, around 150 people from the same groups held a protest outside the New People's Party Headquarters calling Yung to retract her remarks and apologise. Yung met with the protesters briefly and apologised for her remarks causing 'disrespect'.http://www.scmp.com/news/hong- kong/politics/article/2148011/lawmakers-brief-apology-hong-kongs-domestic- workers-just-not ==Personal life== Yung is an avid gamer, describing herself as a \"tech girl\".

Her daughter was born 23 January 2019, making Yung the first sitting Hong Kong legislator to give birth. ==References== Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:University of British Columbia alumni Category:Alumni of the City University of Hong Kong Category:Barristers of Hong Kong Category:New People's Party (Hong Kong) politicians Category:Civil Force politicians Category:HK LegCo Members 2016\u20132020 Category:Members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong Category:Hong Kong women in politics ",
