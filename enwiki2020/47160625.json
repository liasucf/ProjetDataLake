The book centers around a Jewish lesbian teenager named Esme who starts a hip-hop group with her friends in the fictional town of Holyhill, Minnesota. Goode was inspired to write the book because of her \"love for young people, and my frustration with the lack of strong literary role models for young women of all different cultural backgrounds and sexual identities.\" Sister Mischief was a 2012 Best of the Bay pick by the San Francisco Bay Guardian, a top 10 selection of the American Library Association's Rainbow List for excellence in GLBTQ YA literature, and a selection of the ALA's Amelia Bloomer List for excellence in feminist YA literature.

Farah Goes Bang premiered at the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival, where it was awarded the inaugural $25,000 Nora Ephron Prize by Tribeca and Vogue. Farah Goes Bang also won the Comcast Narrative Competition at CAAMFest. Goode designed and executed a Kickstarter campaign for the movie, which raised $81,160 for production of the film.
