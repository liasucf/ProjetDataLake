With numerous Collaborative Research Centres (CRC) of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft it is one of Germany's most research-intensive medical institutions. From 2012 to 2020, it was ranked by Focus as the best of over 1000 hospitals in Germany. In 2019 and 2020 Newsweek ranked the Charit\u00e9 as fifth best hospital in the world and best in Europe. More than half of all German Nobel Prize winners in Physiology or Medicine, including Emil von Behring, Robert Koch and Paul Ehrlich, have worked at the Charit\u00e9. Several politicians and diplomats have been treated at the Charit\u00e9, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who underwent meniscus treatment at the Orthopaedic Department, Yulia Tymoshenko from Ukraine, and, more recently, Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has been receiving treatment at the hospital since his August 2020 poisoning. In 2010/11 the medical schools of Humboldt University and Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin were united under the roof of the Charit\u00e9. The admission rate of the reorganized medical school was 3.9% for the 2019/2020 academic year. QS World University Rankings 2019 ranked the Charit\u00e9 Medical School as number one for medicine in Germany and ninth best in Europe. ==History== Historic and modern buildings at Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte (CCM) Locations of the four campuses of Charit\u00e9 in Berlin Complying with an order of King Frederick I of Prussia from 14 November 1709, the hospital was established north of the Berlin city walls in 1710 in anticipation of an outbreak of the bubonic plague that had already depopulated East Prussia. After the plague spared the city, it came to be used as a charity hospital for the poor. On 9 January 1727, Frederick William I of Prussia gave it the name Charit\u00e9, French 'charity'. The construction of an anatomical theatre in 1713 marks the beginning of the medical school, then supervised by the collegium medico-chirurgicum of the Prussian Academy of Sciences. In the 19th century, after the University of Berlin (today Humboldt University) was founded in 1810, the dean of the medical college Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland integrated the Charit\u00e9 as a teaching hospital in 1828. During this time it became home to such notable medical pioneers as Rudolf Virchow, known as \"the father of modern pathology\"\"Virchow\". The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. and whose name is given to the eponymous \"Virchow's Method\" of autopsy; the Swiss Psychiatrist and Neurologist Otto Binswanger, whose work in vascular dementia led to the discovery of Binswanger's Disease\u2014so coined by his colleague Alois Alzheimer; Robert Koch, who identified the specific causative agents of Tuberculosis, Cholera, and Anthrax; and Emil von Behring, widely known as a \"saviour of children\" nobelprize.org (Retrieved by \"The Internet Archive\") for his 1894 discovery of a Diphtheria antitoxin at a time when diphtheria was a major cause of child death (among many others). In the 20th century, at the end of the Second World War the Charit\u00e9 had endured the Battle of Berlin, with Berlin having been taken by the Red Army on 2 May 1945. Though the majority of its original and pre-War structure was damaged or destroyed during the War, it nevertheless was used as a Red Army hospital. Subsequent to Victory in Europe, in the period of denazification and the Nuremberg trials, the Charit\u00e9 remained in the Soviet Sector of Berlin until the formation of the German Democratic Republic, the GDR\u2014(German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR)\u2014in 1949, more commonly called East Germany. Under the Communists, standards were largely maintained, and it became a showpiece for East Bloc propaganda during the Cold War. Finally, in 1990 with the Reunification of Germany, and in the years following, it once again became one of the world's leading research- and teaching-hospitals. ==Organization== Campus Charit\u00e9 Mitte (CCM) main building Campus Virchow Klinikum (CVK), German Heart Center Berlin (Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin) Campus Benjamin Franklin (CBF) The Charit\u00e9 has four different campuses across the city of Berlin with a total of 3,001 beds:Coordinates from Google Maps * Campus in Mitte, Berlin * Campus Benjamin Franklin (CBF) in Lichterfelde, Berlin * Campus Virchow Klinikum (CVK) in Wedding, Berlin * Campus Berlin Buch (CBB) in Buch, Berlin In 2001, the Helios Clinics Group acquired the hospitals in Buch with their 1,200 beds. Still, the Charit\u00e9 continues to use the campus for teaching and research and has more than 300 staff members located there. The Charit\u00e9 encompasses more than 100 clinics and scientific institutes, organized in 17 different departments, referred to as Charit\u00e9 Centers (CC): * CC 1: Health and Human Sciences * CC 2: Basic Sciences (First Year) * CC 3: Dental, Oral and Maxillary Medicine * CC 4: Charit\u00e9-BIH Center for Therapy Research * CC 5: Diagnostic Laboratory and Preventative Medicine * CC 6: Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology and Nuclear Medicine * CC 7: Anesthesiology, Operating-Room Management and Intensive Care Medicine * CC 8: Surgery * CC 9: Traumatology and Reconstructive Medicine * CC 10: Charit\u00e9 Comprehensive Cancer Center * CC 11: Cardiovascular Diseases * CC 12: Internal Medicine and Dermatology * CC 13: Internal Medicine, Gastroenterology and Nephrology * CC 14: Tumor Medicine * CC 15: Neurology, Neurosurgery, Psychiatry * CC 16: Audiology/Phoniatrics, Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology * CC 17: Gynecology, Perinatal, Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine with Perinatal Center & Human Genetics Overall, 13 of those centers focus on patient care, while the rest focuses on research and teaching. The Medical History Museum Berlin has a history dating back to 1899. The museum in its current form opened in 1998 and is famous for its pathological and anatomical collection. ==Notable people== Rudolf Virchow, by Hugo Vogel Robert Koch and the beginnings of microbiology Paul Ehrlich and the introduction of antimicrobial chemotherapy at Charit\u00e9 Paul Ehrlich Emil von Behring Theodor Billroth operating Many famous physicians and scientists worked or studied at the Charit\u00e9. Indeed, more than half of the German Nobel Prize winners in medicine and physiology come from the Charit\u00e9. Forty Nobel laureates are affiliated with Humboldt University of Berlin and five with Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin. * Selmar Aschheim \u2013 gynecologist * Heinrich Adolf von Bardeleben \u2013 surgeon * Ernst von Bergmann - surgeon * August Bier \u2013 surgeon * Max Bielschowsky \u2013 neuropathologist * Theodor Billroth \u2013 surgeon * Otto Binswanger - psychiatrist and neurologist * Karl Bonhoeffer - neurologist * Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt \u2013 neurologist and neuropathologist * Johann Friedrich Dieffenbach \u2013 surgeon * Christian Drosten \u2013 virologist * Friedrich Theodor von Frerichs \u2013 pathologist * Robert Froriep \u2013 anatomist * Wilhelm Griesinger \u2013 psychiatrist and neurologist * Hermann von Helmholtz \u2013 physician and physicist * Joachim Friedrich Henckel \u2013 surgeon * Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle \u2013 physician, pathologist and anatomist * Eduard Heinrich Henoch \u2013 pediatrician * Otto Heubner \u2013 pediatrician * Rahel Hirsch \u2013 first female medical professor in Prussia * Erich Hoffmann \u2013 dermatologist * Anton Ludwig Ernst Horn \u2013 psychiatrist * Gero H\u00fctter \u2013 hematologist * Friedrich Jolly \u2013 neurologist and psychiatrist * Friedrich Kraus \u2013 internist * Bernhard von Langenbeck \u2013 surgeon * Karl Leonhard \u2013 psychiatrist * Hugo Karl Liepmann \u2013 neurologist and psychiatrist * Leonor Michaelis \u2013 biochemist and physician * Hermann Oppenheim \u2013 neurologist * Samuel Mitja Rapoport \u2013 biochemist and physician * Moritz Heinrich Romberg \u2013 neurologist * Ferdinand Sauerbruch \u2013 surgeon * Curt Schimmelbusch \u2013 physician and pathologist * Johann Lukas Sch\u00f6nlein \u2013 physician and pathologist * Theodor Schwann \u2013 zoologist * Ludwig Traube \u2013 physician and pathologist * Rudolf Virchow \u2013 physician, founder of cell theory and modern pathology * Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal \u2013 neurologist and psychiatrist * Carl Wernicke \u2013 neurologist * August von Wassermann \u2013 bacteriologist * Caspar Friedrich Wolff \u2013 physiologist * Bernhard Zondek \u2013 endocrinologist ===Nobel laureates=== * Emil Adolf von Behring \u2013 physiologist (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1901) * Ernst Boris Chain \u2013 biochemist (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1945) * Paul Ehrlich \u2013 immunologist (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1908) * Hermann Emil Fischer \u2013 chemist (Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1902) * Werner Forssmann \u2013 physician (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1956) * Robert Koch \u2013 physician (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1905) * Albrecht Kossel \u2013 physician (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1910) * Sir Hans Adolf Krebs \u2013 physician and biochemist (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1953) * Fritz Albert Lipmann \u2013 biochemist (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1953) * Hans Spemann \u2013 embryologist (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1935) * Otto Heinrich Warburg \u2013 physiologist (Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1931) ==Medical school== In 2003 the Berlin city and state House of Representatives passed an interim law unifying the medical faculties of both Humboldt University and Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin under the roof of the Charit\u00e9. Since 2010/11 all new medical students have been enrolled on the New Revised Medical Curriculum Programme with a length of 6 years. Referred to the points needed in the German Abitur to get directly accepted, the Charit\u00e9 is together with Heidelberg University Medical School Germany's most competitive medical school (2020). 3,17% of all Charit\u00e9 Medical School students are supported by the German Academic Scholarship Foundation, the highest percentage of all public German universities. The Erasmus Exchange Programme offered to Charit\u00e9 Medical School students includes 72 universities and is the largest in Europe. Charit\u00e9 students can spend up to a year at a foreign medical school with exchange partners such as the Karolinska Institute, University of Copenhagen, Sorbonne University, Universit\u00e0 di Roma La Sapienza, University of Amsterdam, and the University of Z\u00fcrich. Students are also encouraged to participate in research projects, complete a dissertation, or join Charit\u00e9 affiliated social projects. In 2019, it was announced that the Berlin Institute of Health will become part of the Charit\u00e9, marking a change in the German university system by making the Charit\u00e9 the first university clinic which will receive direct and annual financial support by the federal state of Germany. Together with private charity donors like the Johanna Quandt's private excellence initiative (BMW) or the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, as well as financing by the State of Berlin, the new direct federal investments will become the third financial fundament for research at the Charit\u00e9. In addition, it is part of the Berlin University Alliance, receiving funding from the German Universities Excellence Initiative in 2019. == International partner universities == * UK: Oxford University * UK: London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine * US: Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore * US: Northwestern University, Chicago * Canada: Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al * Australia: Monash University, Melbourne * Japan: Chiba University * Japan: Saitama Medical School * Brazil: Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo * China: Tongji University, Shanghai * China: Tongji Medical College, Wuhan ==Einstein Foundation== The Charit\u00e9 is one of the main partners of the Einstein Foundation, which was established by the city and state of Berlin in 2009.
