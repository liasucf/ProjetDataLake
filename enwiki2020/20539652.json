    "text": "The Train is a 1970 Indian Hindi-language thriller film starring Rajesh Khanna and Nanda. The film is recorded as a \"Hit\" at Box Office India. Khanna stars as Police Inspector Shyam Kumar, who sets out to solve a series of murders which have all taken place on a train. Complicating the situation are his girlfriend Neeta (Nanda), who has been acting mysteriously ever since she began her new job, and hotel dancer Miss Lily (Helen), who tries to seduce the good police inspector, but may find that she loses her heart instead. This movie was co-produced by Rajendra Kumar and it was Nanda who suggested Rajendra to cast Rajesh Khanna in the main lead. This film is counted among the 17 consecutive hit films of Rajesh Khanna between 1969 and 1971, by adding the two-hero films Marayada and Andaz to the 15 consecutive solo hits he gave from 1969 to 1971.http://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/eight-lesser-known- facts-about-rajesh-khanna-on-his-death-anniversary/story- eMKmVMlFkKlbSLqAFAf7qI.html It is the remake of the 1967 Malayalam movie Cochin Express starring Prem Nazir, which was subsequently remade in 1968 in Kannada as Bangalore Mail , in Telugu as Circar Express and in Tamil as Neelagiri Express. The film is famous for ever green song \"kis liye maine pyar kiya\" sung by Lata Mangeshkar and the peppy number \"Gulabi Aankhen\", sung by Mohammed Rafi, which continues to get remixed and recreated to this day.
