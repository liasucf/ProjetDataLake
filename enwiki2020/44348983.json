    "text": "G\u00fcl\u015fah Hatun (; died 1487) was a consort of Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror of the Ottoman Empire. ==Early years== She married Mehmed in 1449, when he was still a prince and the governor of Manisa. Just before Sultan Murad II's death, she gave birth to her only son, \u015eehzade Mustafa, who was to be his father's favourite. According to Turkish tradition, all princes were expected to work as provincial governors as a part of their training. Mustafa was sent to govern Konya and later Kayseri, and G\u00fcl\u015fah accompanied him. ==Mustafa's death== Mustafa died in June 1474 of natural causes. It was rumored that Mustafa had approached Mahmud Pasha's wife and thus making him the person behind Mustafa's murder. There are speculations that G\u00fcl\u015fah Hatun may have been a party to the illicit relations between the prince and wife of Mahmud Pasha. Giovanni Maria Angiolello, a Venetian traveler, author of an important historical report on the Aq Qoyunlu and early Safavid Persia, who was in the service of Mustafa, and who with the rest of Mustafa's household accompanied the prince's cortege from his post his Kayseri to Bursa, where he was buried, denied any role for Mahmud Pasha in Mustafa's death; nevertheless Mehmed II had the man executed shortly thereafter. G\u00fcl\u015fah Hatun had not been informed of his death, and with the wagon with her dead son stopped outside the palace, she and the women of her train began to wail. Babinger wrote that Mustafa's only child, Princess Nergiszade, shared her grandmother's grief, and the lamentations went on endlessly. Mehmed sent word that she should remain in Bursa with those maidens whom she required. Mehmed also had a good provision made for her, where she might live there honorably. He ordered that Mustafa's daughter and her mother and rest of the ladies together with all others belonging to the court of his decreased son should come to Istanbul. All the women were lodged in the palace where women of Mehmed's harem stayed, and after several days the maidens were married to courtiers. Nergiszade married her cousin \u015eehzade Abdullah, eldest son of \u015eehzade Bayezid (future Bayezid II) in 1480. ==Last years and death== In 1479, G\u00fcl\u015fah Hatun was granted the village of S\u0131\u011f\u0131rcalu in Dimetoka, its revenues were converted into m\u00fclk so that G\u00fcl\u015fah could turn it into an endowment for the eventual upkeep of her tomb in Bursa. G\u00fcl\u015fah Hatun died in 1487, and was buried in Bursa in the tomb she had built for herself near that of Mustafa. The tomb of G\u00fcl\u015fah Hatun has an entrance with elegant jogged voussoirs, and marble cenotaphs inside, newly made from old pieces. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * Category:1433 births Category:1487 deaths Category:15th-century people of the Ottoman Empire Category:Ottoman dynasty Category:People from Bursa Category:Wives of Ottoman Sultans Category:Princesses Category:Mehmed the Conqueror ",
