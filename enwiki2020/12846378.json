    "text": "Down the Shore is an American sitcom television series created by Alan Kirschenbaum, which aired on Fox from June 21, 1992 to May 27, 1993. ==Synopsis== The series revolves around three childhood friends, Aldo, Zack, and Eddie. In hopes of meeting women at the Jersey Shore over the summer, they decided to get a beach house in Belmar, New Jersey. To cover expenses, they share the beach house with three female co-workers, Donna, Miranda, and Arden. At the start of the second season, Miranda was written out of the series by having a job that was too demanding, and the new female occupant of the beach house was a woman named Sammy, whom Aldo once had a fling with. Although the show was largely comedic in nature, it did have one notable episode where Aldo, a noted Lothario, had been briefly hospitalized and was awaiting the result of an AIDS test. This made all the renters of the beach home, while supportive of Aldo awaiting the results, mull over the fact that casual sex can come with an expensive price. The show ran for 29 episodes over two seasons. The first episode aired Sunday at 9:30 pm and the rest of the first season aired at 10:00 pm. The second season aired Sunday at 10:30 pm for the first two episodes and Thursday at 9:30 pm for the remaining episodes. ==Cast== * Louis Mandylor as Aldo Carbone * Cathryn de Prume as Donna Shipko * Anna Gunn as Arden * Tom McGowan as Eddie Cheever * Lew Schneider as Zack Singer * Nancy Sorel as Sammy (15 episodes, 1992\u20131993) * Pamela Adlon as Miranda Halpern (13 episodes, 1992) ==Episodes== ===Season 1 (1992)=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\" |- ! style=\"background:#;\"| No. overall ! style=\"background:#;\"| No. in season ! style=\"background:#;\"| Title ! style=\"background:#;\"| Directed by ! style=\"background:#;\"| Written by ! style=\"background:#;\"| Original air date |} ===Season 2 (1992\u201393)=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\" |- ! style=\"background:#;\"| No. overall ! style=\"background:#;\"| No. in season ! style=\"background:#;\"| Title ! style=\"background:#;\"| Directed by ! style=\"background:#;\"| Written by ! style=\"background:#;\"| Original air date |} ==External links== * * Category:1990s American sitcoms Category:1992 American television series debuts Category:1993 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:Fox Broadcasting Company original programming Category:Television shows set in New Jersey Category:Television series by 3 Arts Entertainment Category:Television series by HBO Independent Productions ",
