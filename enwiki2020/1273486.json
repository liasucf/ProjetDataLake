    "text": "Heli (, H\u0113l\u00ec, Eli in the New American Standard Bible) is an individual mentioned in the Gospel of Luke as the grandfather of Jesus. In Luke's genealogy of Jesus, Heli is listed as the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, and the son of Matthat (). Heli is not mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, the only other canonical gospel to include a genealogy; that genealogy instead identifies \"Jacob\" as Joseph's putative father. ==Two genealogies of Jesus== The New Testament provides two accounts of the genealogy of Jesus, one in the Gospel of Matthew and another in the Gospel of Luke.; Matthew starts with Abraham, while Luke begins with Adam. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Matthew has twenty-seven generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has forty-two, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.\u2060 Notably, the two accounts also disagree on who Joseph's father was: Matthew says he was Jacob, while Luke says he was Heli.; Traditional Christian scholars (starting with Africanus and EusebiusEusebius Pamphilius, Church history, Life of Constantine \u00a7VII.) have put forward various theories that seek to explain why the lineages are so different,R. T. France, The Gospel According to Matthew: An Introduction and Commentary (Eerdmans, 1985) pages 7172. such as that Matthew's account follows the lineage of Joseph, while Luke's follows the lineage of Mary. Some modern critical scholars like Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan state that both genealogies are inventions, intended to bring the Messianic claims into conformity with Jewish criteria.Marcus J. Borg, John Dominic Crossan, The First Christmas (HarperCollins, 2009) page 95. Another possibility is that since both Heli and Jacob have a similar name listed as their father (Matthan in Matthew, Matthat in Luke), a discrepancy that can easily be accounted for by error, that the names Heli and Jacob refer to the same person. Matthew relied heavily on fitting existing prophecy to the narrative; in the Old Testament, Jacob (the last of the biblical patriarchs) also had a son named Joseph.Spong, John Shelby. Jesus for the non-religious. HarperCollins. 2007. . This explanation fits for Heli/Jacob himself, but not for the earlier genealogies. ==The curse on the Solomonic line== If Matthew's genealogy is that of Mary, and Luke's of Joseph, then there is a problem with the curse on the Solomonic line, dating from the time of Jeconiah where Jeremiah pronounced that no descendant of Jeconiah would again sit on the throne of David or rule Judah.ed. Allen Paul Wikgren Early Christian origins: studies in honor of Harold R. Willoughby 1961 \"The tracing of Jesus through Nathan rather than Solomon may have been promoted by the curse of Jeremiah against Jechoniah\" Although Israel had at least one Solomonic descendant, Zerubbabel, as governor under the Achaemenid Empire, he was neither crowned king nor related by blood to Jeconiah.John F. MacArthur John 1-11 MacArthur New Testament Commentary 2006 Volume 25 - Page 138 \"descendants, the wicked king Jeconiah (also called \u201cConiah\u201d or \u201cJehoiachin\u201d) was cursed by the Lord: \"Thus says the Lord, 'Write.... He was descended from the royal, Solomonic line through his legal (though not biological) father, Joseph.\" ==Saint Joachim and Saint Anne== The apocryphal Protoevangelium of James gives the story of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne as the parents of Mary. This is largely followed in Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican tradition. ==References== Category:Gospel of Luke Category:Family of Jesus ",
