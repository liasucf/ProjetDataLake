    "text": "Likee (formerly LIKE) is a Singapore-based short video creation and sharing platform, available for iOS and Android operating systems. It is owned by Singapore-based BIGO Technology, whose parent company is JOYY, a Chinese company listed on the NASDAQ. The founder of Likee is Jason Hu, who previously worked for JOYY. The app's capabilities include visual effects, including 4D Magic and Dynamic Stickers, as well as video shooting and editing. ==History== Likee was originally known as LIKE until mid-2019, when it was rebranded and redesigned. As of the second quarter of 2019, Likee's mobile monthly active users had reached 80.7 million. On 25 September 2019, the Indian political party Aam Aadmi Party created an official account on Likee. On 30 September 2019, a parental controls feature was introduced, allowing parents and guardians of Likee users to remotely control or restrict access to the app's content. In 2017, Likee was rated as one of Google Play's Best Entertainment Applications. ==Features== The Likee mobile app allows users to easily create and edit videos using a variety of augmented reality effects. ==Privacy concerns== As with other video apps, Likee is condemned by the international community for privacy and inappropriate content. People say it could expose children to sexual predators. Because of that, the 'Enable Parental Controls' feature on Likee allows parents and guardians to control or restrict young users' access to content in Likee. == Ban in India == In June 2020, the Government of India banned Likee along with 58 other Chinese origin apps, citing data and privacy issues, and added that it was a threat to the sovereignty and security of the country. The border tensions in 2020 between India and China might have also played a role in the ban. == See also == * TikTok * Triller ==References== ==External links== * Category:Android (operating system) software Category:IOS software Category:Video software Category:Singaporean social networking websites Category:Video hosting ",
