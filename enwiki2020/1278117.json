Unlike the earlier experimental gas-turbine APT-E unit, these units were powered by 25 kV AC overhead electrification and were used on the West Coast Main Line between London Euston and Glasgow Central. The APT-P is the most powerful domestic train to have operated in Britain, the eight traction motors fitted to the two central Motor Cars giving a total output of . This enabled the train to set the UK rail speed record of in December 1979, a record that stood for 23 years until broken by a Eurostar Class 373 on the newly-completed High Speed 1. ==History== The APT-P was unveiled to the public on 7 June 1978 and continued to be used for testing into 1986. Due to ongoing technical problems with these pre-production units, and a lack of cash or political will to take the project forward, the planned APT-S (Advanced Passenger Train Squadron Service) production-series units were never built, but did influence the design of the later InterCity 225 sets designed for the East Coast Main Line electrification. The influence is strongest with the Class 91 locos which took many features from the APT powercars. The technology was later sold to Fiat Ferroviaria and used for improving their second generation Pendolino trains which have been used worldwide, including the West Coast Main Line as the Class 390. ===Numbering=== Units were numbered 370001-370006 (plus two spare cars labelled 370007) and were formed as follows: *48101-48107 - Driving Trailer Second *48201-48206 - Trailer Second *48401-48406 - Trailer Restaurant Second Buffet *48301-48306 - Trailer Unclassified *48501-48506 - Trailer First *48601-48607 - Trailer Brake First *49001-49006 - Non-Driving Motor A full train was made up of two units running back-to-back, with the two motor cars adjoining. The motor cars had no seating accommodation or through-gangway, so the two halves of the train were unconnected for passengers. ===Withdrawal and preservation=== All six units were withdrawn during 1985-1986, and most cars were quickly scrapped. The remaining cars are exhibited at Crewe Heritage Centre, a museum located next to Crewe station. * Of these, six cars are formed into a single train: **48103 - Driving Trailer Second **48404 - Trailer Restaurant Second Buffet **48603 - Trailer Brake First **49002 - Non-Driving Motor **48602 - Trailer Brake First **48106 - Driving Trailer Second * A single Non-Driving Motor car does not form part of the train and is exhibited separately: **49006 - Non-Driving Motor (not part of the above train) was on loan to the Electric Railway Museum in Coventry from July 2011 until its closure in October 2017 and moved back to Crewe Heritage Centre in March 2018. == Models == In 1980 Hornby Railways produced a OO gauge 5-car set model available as a train set with plain yellow fronts, which was released as a 5-car train pack with black fronts and window surrounds in 1981, until appearing in the 1983 catalogue when the train set was last produced. In 1984 it was discontinued from the Hornby range.However it was featured in the 1985 catalogue although no new models were produced that year. In 2020 Hornby Railways announced that as part of their centenary year range a newly tooled OO Gauge model of the BR Class 370 Advanced Passenger Train would be launched. The APT-P will be available as part of a five-car train pack consisting of sets 370 003 and 370 004 with plain yellow fronts included are DTS, TFB, NDM (motorised), TFB and DTS and a seven-car train pack included is the APT U Development coach, consisting of sets 370 001 and 370 002 with DTS, TBF, NDM (motorised), NDM (dummy), TBF and DTS in APT livery with black front and window surrounds with the additional SKU' coaches available separately in eight sets of two including TS, TU, TRBS, and TF with the additional NDM (motorised) and the APT U Development coach,(for the 5 car pack) for each set to form a realistic complete full rake train for both train packs. == See also == *British Rail Class 390 *British Rail Class 91 *List of high speed trains == References == ===Sources=== * ===Literature=== *APT-P: The Intercity Development Train Publisher: British Railways *The Shape of Travel to Come Publisher: British Railways *British Rail's Advanced Passenger Train Publisher: British Railways *APT Course Notes Publisher: British Railways Scottish Region ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * * * == External links == * Testing the APT-P * APT-P.com * Wickens, A., (1988) APT - With Hindsight Newsletter of the Friends of the National Railway Museum, No.84, Summer 1988 * The Manufacturer (24, February 2004) The great train robbery Category:High-speed trains of the United Kingdom 370 370 Category:Experimental and prototype high-speed trains Category:Abandoned trains of the United Kingdom Category:Train-related introductions in 1980 ",
