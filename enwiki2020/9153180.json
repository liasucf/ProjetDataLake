    "text": "In mathematics, an Albert algebra is a 27-dimensional exceptional Jordan algebra. They are named after Abraham Adrian Albert, who pioneered the study of non-associative algebras, usually working over the real numbers. Over the real numbers, there are three such Jordan algebras up to isomorphism.Springer & Veldkamp (2000) 5.8, p.153 One of them, which was first mentioned by and studied by , is the set of 3\u00d73 self-adjoint matrices over the octonions, equipped with the binary operation :x \\circ y = \\frac12 (x \\cdot y + y \\cdot x), where \\cdot denotes matrix multiplication. Another is defined the same way, but using split octonions instead of octonions. The final is constructed from the non-split octonions using a different standard involution. Over any algebraically closed field, there is just one Albert algebra, and its automorphism group G is the simple split group of type F4.Springer & Veldkamp (2000) 7.2 (For example, the complexifications of the three Albert algebras over the real numbers are isomorphic Albert algebras over the complex numbers.) Because of this, for a general field F, the Albert algebras are classified by the Galois cohomology group H1(F,G).Knus et al (1998) p.517 The Kantor\u2013Koecher\u2013Tits construction applied to an Albert algebra gives a form of the E7 Lie algebra. The split Albert algebra is used in a construction of a 56-dimensional structurable algebra whose automorphism group has identity component the simply-connected algebraic group of type E6. The space of cohomological invariants of Albert algebras a field F (of characteristic not 2) with coefficients in Z/2Z is a free module over the cohomology ring of F with a basis 1, f3, f5, of degrees 0, 3, 5.Garibaldi, Merkurjev, Serre (2003), p.50 The cohomological invariants with 3-torsion coefficients have a basis 1, g3 of degrees 0, 3.Garibaldi (2009), p.20 The invariants f3 and g3 are the primary components of the Rost invariant. ==See also== *Euclidean Jordan algebra for the Jordan algebras considered by Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner *Euclidean Hurwitz algebra for details of the construction of the Albert algebra for the octonions ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * ==Further reading== * * * Albert algebra at Encyclopedia of Mathematics.
