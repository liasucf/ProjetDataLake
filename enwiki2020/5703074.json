    "text": "John Alfred Williams (December 5, 1925 \u2013 July 3, 2015) was an African-American author, journalist, and academic. His novel The Man Who Cried I Am was a bestseller in 1967.Marnie Eisenstadt, \"Author John A. Williams dies; Syracuse University alum wrote best-selling novel\", Syracuse.com, July 7, 2015. ==Life and career== Williams was born in Jackson, Mississippi, and his family moved to Syracuse, New York. After naval service in World War II, he graduated in 1950 from Syracuse University. He was a journalist for Ebony (his September 1963 Ebony article \"Negro In Literature Today\" has been singled out for particular praise), Jet, and Newsweek magazines. His novels, which include The Angry Ones (1960) and The Man Who Cried I Am (1967), are mainly about the black experience in white America. The Man Who Cried I Am, a fictionalized account of the life and death of Richard Wright, introduced the King Alfred Plan - a fictional CIA-led scheme supporting an international effort to eliminate people of African descent. This \"plan\" has since been cited as fact by some members of the Black community and conspiracy theorists. In the early 1980s, Williams, and the composer and flautist Leslie Burrs, with the agreement of Mercer Ellington, began collaborating on the completion of Queenie Pie, an opera by Duke Ellington that had been left unfinished at Ellington's death. The project fell through, and the opera was eventually completed by other hands. In 2003, Williams performed a spoken-word piece on Transform, an album by rock band Powerman 5000. At the time, his son Adam Williams was the band's guitarist. ==Personal life== Williams married Lori Isaac in 1965 and moved in 1975 from Manhattan to Teaneck, New Jersey, as it was a place that \"would not be inhospitable to a mixed marriage\".Horner, Shirley. \"New Jersey Q & A: John A. Williams; A Novelist's Journey in Race Relations\", The New York Times, June 13, 1993. Accessed July 8, 2015. \"In an interview at his home in Teaneck, Professor Williams, 67, further talked about the relationship between blacks and whites in general, and blacks and Jews in particular; his interracial marriage and the experience of teaching at Rutgers.... In 1975, the Williamses left Manhattan for Teaneck; four years later, he accepted a full-time professorship at Rutgers.... Q. How did you come to Teaneck? A. We came here because we felt the town would not be inhospitable to a mixed marriage.\" Dear Chester, Dear John, a collection of personal letters between Williams and Chester Himes, who had met in 1961 and maintained a lifelong friendship, was published in 2008. ==Honorable recognitions== In 1970, Williams received the Syracuse University Centennial Medal for Outstanding Achievement, in 1983 his novel !Click Song won the American Book Award, and in 1998, his book of poetry Safari West also won the American Book Award.
