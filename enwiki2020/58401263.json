    "text": "The Leyland TX450 is a 17.5 tonne technology demonstrator concept truck developed by the British commercial vehicle company Leyland Trucks in 1986. The aerodynamic cab design by Ogle Design incorporated a new driver layout including a mix of analogue and CRT displays, onboard computer, disc drive and orunbter, axle weighing system and rear view camera. The TX450 is powered by a 165 hp Leyland 320 turbocharged engine coupled to a continuously variable transmission system. It has a 6x2 chassis layout with traction control and the trailing rear wheels steer to match the front ones, matching the manoeuvrability to that of a 7.5 tonne vehicle. ==References== Category:Leyland Trucks vehicles ",
