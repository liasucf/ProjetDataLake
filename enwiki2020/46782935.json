He has had a great deal to do with the organization of political Associations. For some years he acted as honorary secretary of the Christchurch (Hampshire) Conservative Association. After succeeding to the Windlesham property at the death of his uncle, Fyler accepted the office of Conservative agent in the Chertsey Division in 1898. In March 1903 Fyler, who was regarded as \"a keen sportsman and a Freemason,\" was elected as MP for Chertsey. Fyler was made bankrupt in May, 1904, with liabilities \u00a322,279, and stepped down as M.P.
