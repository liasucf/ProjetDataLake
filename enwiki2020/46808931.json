In 1786, he joined the choir of St. George's Chapel, Windsor, under Edward Webb and then Theodore Aylward Sr., and in Eton College Chapel under William Sexton. In 1797, he was appointed lay clerk in St. George's Chapel, and obtained a similar appointment at Eton two years later. Soon afterwards, he resigned those places and went to Cambridge, where he was admitted a member of the choirs of Trinity, St. John's, and King's Colleges. Afterwards, he became master of the choristers of King's College. He published several glees of his own composition, and The Rudiments of Singing, with about thirty solfeggi to assist persons wishing to sing at sight. ==References== ==References== * Category:English singers Category:Choristers Category:English choral conductors Category:British male conductors (music) Category:1778 births Category:1860 deaths ",
