Webber was born in Melbourne. Before becoming a Member of Parliament, Webber was actively involved in politics. She has been a member of the Labor Party since 1984 and held numerous positions within the party before her election to the Senate in 2001. Her term in the Senate began on 1 July 2002. In October 2006, she lost a preselection contest to then-state MP Louise Pratt and was relegated to the only marginally winnable third position on the Labor Senate ticket for the 2007 federal election. She was then defeated by Australian Greens candidate Scott Ludlam at the election. She was the sole incumbent Labor Senator at the 2007 federal election to lose her seat. In January 2015, Webber became Chief Executive Officer of Down Syndrome Australia, and resigned in June 2016. ==References== *Ruth Webber, Senate Biography Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Western Australia Category:Women members of the Australian Senate Category:21st- century Australian politicians Category:21st-century Australian women politicians ",
