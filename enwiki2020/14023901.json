    "text": "In enzymology, a 3-demethylubiquinone-9 3-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3-demethylubiquinone-9 \\rightleftharpoons S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + ubiquinone-9 Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 3-demethylubiquinone-9, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and ubiquinone-9. This enzyme participates in ubiquinone biosynthesis. == Nomenclature == This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L- methionine:2-nonaprenyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-1, 4-benzoquinone 3-O-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include 5-demethylubiquinone-9 methyltransferase, OMHMB-methyltransferase, 2-Octaprenyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-1,4-benzoquinone, methyltransferase, S-adenosyl-L-methionine:2-octaprenyl-3-methyl-5-hydroxy-6-methoxy-, and 1,4-benzoquinone-O-methyltransferase. == References == * * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
