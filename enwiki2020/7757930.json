Lady Sings the Blues, Hal Leonard Corporation, (1985) \u2013 Holiday indicated that an argument with her mother over money led to the song. She stated that during the argument her mother said \"God bless the child that's got his own.\" The anger over the incident led her to use that line as the starting point for a song, which she worked out in conjunction with Herzog. In his 1990 book Jazz Singing, Will FriedwaldFriedwald, Will. Jazz Singing: America's Great Voices from Bessie Smith to Bebop and Beyond, Da Capo, (1996) \u2013 describes the song as \"sacred and profane,\" as it references the Bible while indicating that religion seems to have no effect in making people treat each other better.Liner notes pages 6 and 7 in Billie Holiday's Greatest Hits ==Notes== Category:1939 songs Category:1941 singles Category:Billie Holiday songs Category:Aretha Franklin songs Category:Stevie Wonder songs Category:Blood, Sweat & Tears songs Category:Diana Ross songs Category:Barbra Streisand songs Category:Carmen McRae songs Category:Liza Minnelli songs Category:Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients Category:Songs written by Arthur Herzog Jr. Category:Songs written by Billie Holiday Category:Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B; Vocal Performance Category:Eva Cassidy songs Category:1930s jazz standards Category:Al Jarreau songs Category:Jill Scott songs Category:Okeh Records singles ",
