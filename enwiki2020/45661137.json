    "text": "GISIS was the seventh and final of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) series of satellites after IRNSS-1A, IRNSS-1B, IRNSS-1C, IRNSS-1D, IRNSS-1E and IRNSS-1F. This system of satellites will provide navigational services to the Indian region. The satellite was placed in geosynchronous orbit successfully on April 28, 2016 at 12:50\u2013pm IST. == Launch == The satellite was launched from the First Launch Pad (FLP) of Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota on board PSLV-C33. The countdown of the launch had begun 51:30 hours before at 9:20 a.m. IST on 25 April. After the launch of IRNSS-1G the Indian government named the IRNSS system as NAVIC (Navigation Indian Constellation). == Specifications == The satellite is designed for 12 years of life. It has a lift-off mass of and dry mass of . The ranging payload of IRNSS-1G consists of a C-band transponder (automatic receivers and transmitters of radio signals) which facilitates accurate determination of the range of the satellite. It would operate in L-5 and S band spectrums and also has a Rubidium atomic clock. Special thermal control systems are used for key components like this clock. Two panels of solar cells are used to generate 1660W of energy and one Lithium-ion 90A-hr battery is used. The satellite is placed in an orbit at an altitude of at 129.5 deg East longitude. It cost approximately . The \"XL\" version of PSLV was used with six strap-ons for the launch. Each strap-on used of propellant. ISRO has successfully used PSLV 34 times and the XL version 12 times before the launch of IRNSS-1G. ==See also== * Communication-Centric Intelligence Satellite (CCI-Sat) * GPS-aided geo- augmented navigation (GAGAN) * Satellite navigation == References == == External links == * ISRO Future Programmes Category:Spacecraft launched by India in 2016 Category:IRNSS satellites Category:Spacecraft launched by PSLV rockets ",
