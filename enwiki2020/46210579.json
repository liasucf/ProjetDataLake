The album was reissued on double vinyl format through Very Friendly in 2007, and was the first of a series of limited edition vinyl reissues of the band's catalog. IDM musician Aphex Twin once played a remixed version of the title track at the 2001 S\u00f3nar festival. He has also played the track \"Public\" during a special \"headphone\" set at Barbican, London, in which one reviewer of the show called the track \"unnecessary, exploitative, and cheap\". ==Track listing== All songs written by William Bennett, except for \"Public\", written by Peter Sotos ==Personnel== *William Bennett - vocals, synthesizer, production *Philip Best - vocals, synthesizer *Peter Sotos - synthesizer *Denis Blackham - mastering *Steve Albini - recording (on \"Public\") ==References== ==External links== * Category:2001 albums Category:Whitehouse (band) albums ",
