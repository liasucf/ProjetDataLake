The winery also produces an eau de vie style spirit from their Moscato, named Andrew Jackson Dollarhide: Spirit of St. Sup\u00e9ry. Founded by a long-established French winemaking family, Les vins skalli, the winery's history began in 1982 with the purchase of Dollarhide Ranch. Skalli Family Wines purchased an additional parcel in Rutherford in 1986, and began construction of a modern winery there. The winery officially opened its doors as St. Sup\u00e9ry in 1989. St. Sup\u00e9ry was acquired by Chanel in October, 2015. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Wineries in Napa Valley Category:1982 establishments in California ",
