Section: Diplomatic Relations. == Cooperation == The priority character that Niger currently has for Spanish cooperation is manifested in the fact that in the current IV Master Plan it remains one of the 23 countries of concentration of its cooperation. In this sense, the signing of the document of adoption of the Spanish-Nigerian Country Association Framework in September 2014 by the foreign ministers Margallo and Bazoum in Madrid, opens a new period of cooperation that extends until 2016 and in which there is the commitment of the Spanish cooperation to disburse more than 20 million euros in these three years, around two priority sectors: Rural Development and Food and Nutrition Security; and the Health sector. These commitments are consistent with the priorities of the Nigerian Government and are expressed in the Country Partnership Framework in Spain's proposal to \u201ccontribute to the improvement of Food and Nutrition Security of the most vulnerable Nigerian population, preventing their causes, intervening on their effects and building resilience at local, national and regional levels.\" Ficha de N\u00edger Office of Diplomatic Information.
