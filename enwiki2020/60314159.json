Bielinis was an active member of the Constituent Assembly and a member of the parliamentary commissions on local self- governments, finance and budget, and education.

Bielinis and other social democrats protested the coup d'\u00e9tat of December 1926 that brought President Antanas Smetona to power. In addition to parliamentary work, Bielinis and Steponas Kairys were the most prominent leaders of the Lithuanian social democrats. Bielinis was periodically reelected to the central committee of the Social Democratic Party, becoming its chairman in 1923 and 1925. From March 1921 to January 1923, he was also editor-in-chief of the social democratic newspaper Socialdemokratas (Socialdemocrat). After the dismissal of the Third Seimas in March 1927, political activities of the opposition parties were restricted until all parties except for the ruling Lithuanian Nationalist Union were banned in 1936. Bielinis and Kairys attended the 4th congress of the Labour and Socialist International in Vienna in 1931, but more active political work in Lithuania was difficult. They both were briefly arrested in April 1929 when police searched the headquarters of the Social Democratic Party and found copies of the illegal Pirmyn (Forward) newspaper published by the ple\u010dkaitininkai. On 1 January 1928, Bielinis became chief of accounting at the . He also became director of the craft section at the Chamber encouraging traditional crafts such as weaving, knitting, ceramics.

He managed to publish two of them about the Lithuanian press ban and the Russian Revolution of 1905 in 1958 and 1959. The third volume on World War I was published posthumously in 1971. The manuscript for the period between the revolution and World War I remained in Lithuania and was published by his nephew in 2012. ===Occupied Lithuania and United States=== Bielinis in 1930s During World War II, Bielinis was a member of the Lithuanian resistance. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Lithuanian social democrats reestablished their political organization, now known as the New Lithuania (). It was chaired by Steponas Kairys with Bielinis acting as vice-chairman. In May 1942, New Lithuania published a proclamation which denounced both Soviet and German occupations. It was followed by a proclamation that urged Lithuanians to conserve their resources and not to join the German war effort. Various Lithuanian groups understood the need for a unified organization. In 1942, two such umbrella organizations were created \u2013 the Catholic-minded National Council, chaired by Juozas Ambrazevi\u010dius, and the atheist Supreme Committee of Lithuanians. Bielinis became responsible for the finances of the Supreme Committee. In November 1943, the two organizations merged into the Supreme Committee for the Liberation of Lithuania (VLIK), chaired by Kairys. Bielinis continued to be responsible for the finances of the merged organization. In April\u2013May 1944, the Gestapo discovered VLIK and arrested a total of 27 VLIK members and supporters. Kairys went into hiding while Bielinis attempted to organize the \"small\" VLIK, which met six times in May\u2013June 1944. Bielinis decided to transfer VLIK to Germany where Rapolas Skipitis, Vaclovas Sidzikauskas, and Mykolas Krupavi\u010dius resided. In July, the small VLIK retreated to Suvalkija and published several proclamations urging Lithuanians to defend Lithuania's independence from the advancing Red Army, i.e. to organize the partisan warfare against the Soviet Union. Bielinis, as many other Lithuanian intellectuals, retreated west and in August 1944 arrived to Berlin. He joined VLIK and once again became responsible for its finances. He headed VLIK's finance committee which grew to become the Lithuanian National Foundation. Bielinis and others organized the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania in exile \u2013 they held a congress in September 1949 in Prien am Chiemsee, Germany, and sent out many declarations and memorandums to political leaders in Europe and United States concerning Lithuania's occupation, mass deportations, and other Soviet repressions He was also a member of the special commission organizing the Lithuanian World Community and preparing the Lithuanian Charter in 1949.. Bielinis moved to the United States in September 1949 and joined the cultural life of Lithuanian Americans, including the \u2013 he established the federation's Book Fund in 1953. In 1951, he was one of the founders of the Lithuanian-American Community and a member of the Committee for a Free Lithuania, which was related to the National Committee for a Free Europe and later joined the Assembly of Captive European Nations. When VLIK moved to the United States in 1955, Bielinis rejoined its activities and was briefly its acting chairman from 3 October to 29 November 1964. In November 1964, he was elected to the seven-person board of VLIK. He also contributed articles social-democratic Lithuanian press, including newspapers Keleivis (Traveler), Naujienos (News), magazines Darbas (Work) and Darbinink\u0173 balsas (Voice of Workers). In 1963, he published Teroro ir vergijos imperija soviet\u0173 Rusija (Soviet Russia, the Empire of Terror and Slavery) in which he calculated Lithuania's demographic losses of about 1 million people during World War II and post-war Soviet terror, described the Soviet Gulag system, and presented examples of living conditions of camps in Vorkuta and elsewhere.
