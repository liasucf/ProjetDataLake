    "text": "Boston City Council elections were held on November 2, 1993. All thirteen seats (nine district representatives and four at-large members) were contested in the general election, while ten seats (six districts and the four at-large members) had also been contested in the preliminary election held on September 21, 1993. The large number of preliminary candidates followed a reduction in the number of signatures required for a candidate to appear on the ballot, from 1500 to 500. Since the composition of the council changed in 1984, to four at-large seats and nine district representatives, no candidate who had run for re-election had lost. However, two incumbents\u2014Anthony Crayton and David Scondras\u2014were defeated by challengers in this election. ==At-large== Councillors John A. Nucci and Dapper O'Neil were re-elected. Councillors Bruce Bolling and Rosaria Salerno did not seek re-election, as they were running for Mayor of Boston; their seats were won by Richard P. Iannella and Peggy Davis- Mullen. Iannella was the son of former Council president Christopher A. Iannella, while unsuccessful candidate Michael Travaglini was the brother of outgoing District 1 Councillor Robert Travaglini. {| class=wikitable !colspan=1 rowspan=2 |Candidates !colspan=2 |Preliminary Election !colspan=2 |General Electionhttps://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=696452 |- !Votes !% !Votes !% |- | John A.
