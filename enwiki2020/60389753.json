The project took place focusing on women, water, and globalization with financial sponsorship. Juana Alicia wanted to highlight the issues underlying the conflicts of women around the world with the subject being La Llorona, foregrounding the exemplary Mexican legend of the lady who killed her children by drowning them in the river and is cursed to look for them. The blue mural also has other subjects such as women in Bolivia, India, and at the U.S. border. These women are featured in the mural for the challenges that they faced, such as water rights and unsolved homicides of women in Juarez. The La Llorona mural is located near Juana Alicia's Las Lechugeueras, also known as The Women Lettuce Workers, which portrays farmworkers' rights for better working conditions and pesticide harming in California. The mural was taken down due to the water damage done to the wall with a 90-day warning, and instead, Juana Alicia created the La Llorona mural to take its place. == Artworks == Family Expectations This artwork, created in 1993, shows figures of women whose appearances suggest family unification with a traditional and realistic composition. The women are wearing distinctive outfits with a vivid color scheme, representing different generations. The women are not smiling in the artwork except for one woman and her baby that are within a rectangular shape in the artwork. The intent was to emphasize on the freedom of self-prediction and interpretation. The medium of this artwork is oil on canvas, and the canvas size is 3 feet and 2 inches x 2 feet and 6 inches. Oil Spill This artwork, created in 1994, is a surrealist painting that features a dying bird symbolizing negligent homicide. The dying bird has a human head. With this artwork, Rivera wanted to expose the brutality to animal life and highlight mankind's apathy towards animals. The dark background highlights the misery of the occasion and makes a sharp differentiation between the winged animal and its natural surroundings. There is also a black swan in the environment that is covered in oil that symbolizes humanity\u2019s negligence for animals. Eye to We This artwork, created in 1994, is a surrealist painting that portrays an otherworldly presentation that consists of naked structures skipping about underwater. The naked structures have no heads, and they are swimming in the midst of a massive figure that has a single colossal eye. The massive figure with the eye is not peering at the headless naked structures which are swimming around but at the viewers themselves. This artwork mostly consists of overlapping headless naked figures that depict primarily female bodies and the blue water environment harmonizes with the figures. The medium of this artwork is oil on canvas, and the canvas size is 3 feet and 2 \u00bc inches x 4 feet. Oakland Bay Bridge This artwork, created in 1994, is a colorful display of a well-known landmark. Rivera uses her expressionistic and primitive approach for this artwork to make a dramatic rendition of the landmark. Although the artwork is titled Oakland Bay Bridge, the bridge is not the main subject of the painting. There is a progression of houses strewn across the bay, and there are hillsides in the red landscape. The medium of this artwork is oil on canvas, and the canvas size is 3 feet and 3 inches x 4 feet and 6 inches. Limbs This artwork, created in 1993, consists of many dots that are prevalent in her artwork. The background is an ultramarine blue sky, and clouds are concealed behind tree limbs. The atmosphere is full of clouds while the tree limbs overlap them. The limbs are in the form of human arms and legs, and the limbs seem to be grabbing upward as though trying to uncover one\u2019s presence. The Matador This artwork, created in 1992, depicts a matador with a red cape. There are folds and wrinkles of the matador\u2019s red cape, and its composition highlights them. There is also another matador on the right side. The medium of the artwork is oil on canvas, and the size of the canvas is 5 feet x 4 feet. == Exhibitions == Solo Exhibitions * 1994 - Open Studio in Oakland, California * 1995 - Ethnic Trip Studio in San Francisco, California Group Exhibition * 1995 - Somar Gallery in San Francisco, California == References == == Bibliography == *50 Balmy Law P.C., www.50balmy.com/. *Ancona, George.
