    "text": "Erik Martiny (born 11 June 1971) is a Franco-Irish-Swedish novelist, academic and journalist who teaches at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri IV in Paris. His reviews on art and literature have appeared in The Times Literary Supplement, The London Magazine, The Cambridge Quarterly, Whitewall Magazine and Aesthetica Magazine. ==Early life== Martiny was born in the city of Cork in Ireland, and grew up speaking French. ==Reception== Martinys' book The Pleasures of Queueing was widely and favourably reviewed. In 3AM Magazine, Peter Harris praised it as \u201chilarious and vivid\u201d, arguing that Martiny\u2019s \u201cwitty self-conscious distance allows him to contextualize the bizarre into familial banality. [\u2026] Martiny makes all of these graphic descriptions enjoyable rather than just gross by maintaining both a comic distance and linguistic virtuosity.\u201d He concluded that \u201cOne lovely quality of the novel is its generosity and compassion towards almost everyone\u201d. Eamon Maher in The Irish Times, wrote \u201cMartiny can definitely spin a yarn and has a gift for comedy\". Josephine Fenton in The Irish Examiner opined: \u201cLee Jenkins loves this novel saying that it is \u2018hilarious and heartfelt in equal measure\u2019 and that it is a \u2018story of bohemia and bountiful creation with the verve and verbal inventiveness of early Philip Roth\u2019. Some accolade. But hers is a brilliant assessment of the novel.\u201d Philip Coleman had this to say in Litro Magazine: \u201cone of the most candid literary autobiographies ever written [\u2026] it is undoubtedly one of the funniest narratives to be written in recent years about growing up and coming-of-age in the south of Ireland [\u2026] By the time the reader gets to this point in Martiny\u2019s highly entertaining and fast-paced narrative, one realises that it is, for all of its comic high jinks, an intellectually engaged and engaging work [\u2026] a novel that seems destined to become some kind of cult classic.\u201d In World Literature Today, Edward Ouesslin summarized Ne soyez pas timide in the following terms: \u201cThe writer and director Jean Cocteau takes center stage during much of the oversized subplot, initiating a young and very shy narrator into a world of drugs (mostly opium), sex, and bizarre social experiments (including living as a panhandler), all of which is presumably designed to shatter the narrator\u2019s bourgeois inhibitions and guide him, however harshly and awkwardly, toward his emergence as a full-fledged writer. The middle-aged Cocteau as a literary mentor and sexual initiator to inexperienced young men is more than plausible. The rest of the novel is an exercise in Rabelaisian humor, alternating between learned disquisitions and outlandishly disgusting sexual and/or scatological encounters. His last novel is maybe the one that brought him really in success with very judicious sentences like \"she peels him like a banana, slowly and meticulously\"\u201d ==Published works== ===Fiction=== * The Pleasures of Queueing (2018) * Ne soyez pas timide (2019) * Night of the Long Goodbyes (2019) * Crown of Beaks (2020) ===Academic works=== * Intertextualit\u00e9 et filiation paternelle dans la po\u00e9sie anglophone (2008) * Lolita: From Nabokov to Kubrick and Lyne (ed) (2009) * A Companion to Poetic Genre (ed) (2011) * Le commentaire de textes (2018) * L\u2019anglais en pr\u00e9pas (2019) == References == Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:French male novelists Category:21st-century French journalists Category:Irish male novelists Category:Swedish male novelists Category:French literary critics Category:Irish literary critics Category:Swedish literary critics Category:Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV teachers Category:21st-century French novelists Category:French male journalists Category:21st-century Irish novelists Category:Irish journalists Category:21st-century Swedish novelists Category:21st-century Swedish journalists Category:People from Cork (city) ",
