    "text": "The Borrowdale Fell Race is an annual fell race held in August, starting and finishing in Rosthwaite. It is considered to be one of the \"classic\" Lakeland races and the route initially heads over Bessyboot before climbing England\u2019s highest summit, Scafell Pike. Great Gable is then scaled before a descent to Honister Pass and the final climb up Dale Head. The distance is approximately seventeen miles and the route has around 6,500 feet of ascent.Angela Mudge, World\u2019s Ultimate Running Races (Glasgow, 2011), 297. ==History== The race, sponsored by Miles Jessop of the Scafell Hotel, Borrowdale, and the New Dungeon Ghyll Hotel, Langdale, was originally intended to link those two establishments. However, Chris Bland, Andy Ewing and others decided on the route via Bessyboot, Esk Hause, Scafell Pike, Great Gable, Honister Hause and Dale Head. The inaugural race was held in 1974 and in that year only, there was an extra checkpoint in Tongue Gill on the descent to Rosthwaite.Bill Smith, Stud Marks on the Summits (Preston, 1985), 182-85; \"Chris Bland Found Dead in Borrowdale Valley\", Cumberland & Westmorland Herald, 22 Mar 2003; \"MBE for Lakeland Hotelier\", Cumberland & Westmorland Herald, 3 Jan 2004. In 2001, a foot-and-mouth outbreak led to the cancellation of many fell races. Borrowdale was one of the first to take place as the access restrictions were reduced, and Prince Philip presented the prizes to the leading runners that year.Steve Chilton, It's a Hill, Get Over It (Dingwall, 2013), 85-87; The Times, 6 Aug 2001. In 2003, the route to the first checkpoint on Bessyboot was changed following concerns about the possibility of serious injuries due to falling rocks on the steep climb.The Fellrunner Magazine, Jun 2003, 20; The Fellrunner Magazine, Oct 2003, 66. The 2007 race was run over a shortened course due to inclement weather. After the climb up Bessyboot and traverse to Esk Hause, runners were directed to Sty Head, missing out Scafell Pike on which conditions were considered to be unsafe. From Sty Head, the usual route was rejoined with the ascent of Great Gable.Northumberland Fell Runners: 2007 Race Reports \u2013 Borrowdale Fell Race.
