    "text": "Markwarta street is located in the downtown district of Bydgoszcz, Poland. Situated in its path are two green areas and several villas built during the Polish interwar period. ==Location== East-west street track extends Krasi\u0144skiego Street to the east. It ends while meeting Ossoli\u0144ski Alley. ==History== The axis has long been visible on Prussian maps of Bydgoszcz, mainly as an eastbound track prolonging Fr\u00f6nerstra\u00dfe (today's Krasi\u0144skiego Street), but was never been associated with a naming. The first city book listing Markwarta street dates back to 1928, associated with the creation of the Idyll area (), set north of Markwarta street. In the 1910s, Sielanka area plans, designed as a city-garden, were drawn by German architect Josef St\u00fcbben, but due to WWI the project only took off in the 1920s, hence the appearance of Markwarta street on the maps at this time. The street is named after Ryszard Markwart (1868-1906), a Polish priest who was a nationalist activist and head of Bromberg parish from 1899 till his death. ==Main edifices== Square of Lieutenant Leszek Bia\u0142y This green area is what is left from Sielanka's urban plan developed in the 1910s by German architect Josef St\u00fcbben. At the time this part of the city had not been touched by urban growth, as Gda\u0144ska or Dworcowa streets could have been at the end of the 19th century. Sielanka district never included this square as, at the time, it was a property of Province of Posen () and not owned by the municipality. After the rebirth of Poland in 1918, the area was declared to be constructed, but no project was ever completed. In the 1960s, a memorial has been built up to celebrate the Millennium of the Polish State (). Designed by Polish artist Stanislaw Lejkowski on July 22, 1967, the project has never been entirely completed. In 2011, the city had even projects to demolish it, but it turned out to be too expensive. The site has been given the name Lieutenant Leszek Bia\u0142y in November 2013. Leszek Bia\u0142y was a hero of the Home Army during the Second World War. Under the code name Jakub, he was arrested in February 1945 by members of soviet controlled Ministry of Public Security and was murdered during interrogations on March 3, 1945. In October 1956, his remains were discovered in the basement of the UB building at No.4. A renovated stone memorial to honor Leszek Bia\u0142y and his heroic comrades has been unveiled in 2013.

In the years 1966-1967, a link was built between the No. 4 and 6. After the expansion of the late 1980s, the hospital had 127 beds. It provided medical care for the benefit of the Ministry of Interior employees until 1990. Since the fall of communism, it provides services to all patients without any professional restrictions. Today the facility provides medical services in the field of basic health care, such as Dental and Oral Medicine, rehabilitation, occupational medicine, laboratory diagnosis and medical imaging. The dark past of No.4 as UBP building has been highlighted in 2019, by the uncovering of a memorial plaque.

It was named in memoriam of Wincenty Witos. Ludowy Park (People's Park) was founded at the place of an ancient cemetery, dating back to 1778, the oldest and largest in the city. In 1838 was built a house for the administrator, with a separate room for the morgue. In 1884, a cemetery was erected and in 1898 a massive brick fence, which survived after the liquidation of the cemetery. Entrance was made through two wrought iron gates to Markwart street, leading to the chapel located in the middle of the graveyard. A large square with outgoing path, like spokes, divided the cemetery into quarters. A lot of different trees were growing there: oak, chestnut, European beech, downy oak, sessile oak, oak red, locust, birch, lime, common spruce, prickly spruce and white spruce, and near the house were 10 Catalpa bignonioides. In 1938, 66 species of trees and shrubs were growing in the cemetery where a majority of German tombs could be found. After Bydgoszcz's liberation in 1945, the old cemetery was closed and transferred to the Lutheran cemetery in Za\u015bwiat Street. The liquidation of the ancient graveyard was carried out in 1951-1952, the last bone exhumation to Za\u015bwiat street was held in 1956. Many tombstones have been destroyed during the liquidation, along with sculptures, reliefs and catacombs. It has been the case for some famous people's tombstones: * Theodor Gottlieb von Hippel the Younger (1775-1843); * Carl and William Blumwe, owners of Factory of Machine Tools, where a copy of the sculpture of \"Christ the Saviour\" by Bertel Thorvaldsen was standing. This sculpture has been moved to the square by the Lutheran Church of the Savior in Bydgoszcz, it is today one of the most impressive religious monuments in the city. Once the cemetery liquidated, a city park, named \"People's Park\" (), has been set up on the very place, using part of the remaining elements of the gone necropolis. In 1956, a concert shell has been erected with a capacity of 5000 people. This building replaced the amphitheatre erected in 1946 in Park Casimir the Great. In addition to the concert shell, three blocks of flats on the western edge of the park, and pavilions in the east were constructed. In 1974, at the southern edge of the park has been built the \"Youth Palace\". On June 3, 1984, at the initiative of People's Party, the park has been given the name of Wincenty Witos: his bust has been realised by Witold Marciniak and funded by Bydgoszcz Voivodeship's Polish People's Party. Between the monument and the concert shell, a round pool with a gushing summer fountain has been built. In 2007 have been performed renovations of parkways, concert shell and park greenery. On April 24, 2007, a black granite obelisk commemorating the existence of the old cemetery has been unveiled in the south-east corner of the park, bearing the inscription: \"In Binding Memory of the former Protestant cemetery. City of Bydgoszcz Lutheran Parish of Bydgoszcz Bydgoszcz 2007\" Since 2018, a heavy revitalisation of the park is in progress, it will end in November 2019.
