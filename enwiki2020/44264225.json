Joseph Owino had originally helped streamline and verify the Ugandan president's official Facebook and Twitter accounts. ===Arrest=== On October 26, 2014, Owino was arrested from his home in Kampala by police from the Special Investigations Unit. Sarah Kagingo, the Ugandan Special Presidential Assistant for Communications led the police to Owino's residence after accusing him of hacking into Yoweri Kaguta Museveni's social media profiles. Owino spent that night in jail at the Kireka \"Wembley\" Police Station, Special Investigations Unit in charge of Terrorism and serious crimes. The next day, Museveni tweeted through his official and verified Twitter account that his account had not been hacked, a position reiterated on Tuesday October 28 in an official press release from the President's Press Unit. Instead, the press release explained that the President himself had \"personally suspended\" Ms. Kagingo a month prior due to \"misconduct\". Further, the President called from Rome to call for the immediate release of Owino and an investigation into Kagingo and the police officers who took part in the unwarranted arrest. ==Personal life== Owino is married to his British wife, Daniella Boston with whom he lives in Kampala, Uganda. ==References== Category:Ugandan businesspeople Category:20th-century births Category:Young Achievers Award winners Category:Living people ",
