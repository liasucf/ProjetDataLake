    "text": "Mile Sterjovski ( ; born 27 May 1979) is a retired Australian football (soccer) player. Sterjovski played mainly as a right winger or as a second striker, but also played as a left winger and central midfielder. Sterjovski played youth football with Wollongong Wolves and the AIS before making his senior debut for Wolves in the National Soccer League. After also playing for Wollongong United, Sydney United and Parramatta Power, Sterjovski moved overseas to play for French club Lille OSC. He also spent time in Switzerland (with Basel) and Turkey (with Hacettepe) before joining Derby in the English Premier League. He eventually returned to Australia to play in the A-League for Perth Glory and Central Coast Mariners, separated by a period playing for Dalian Aerbin in the Chinese Super League. He then returned to the A-league to win the championship with the Central Coast Mariners. He played for the Australian national team from 2000 to 2010, making 43 appearances and scoring 8 goals, including 3 games at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and an international hat-trick against Tahiti. ==Club career== ===Junior Club=== Sterjovski began playing as a junior with the Wollongong Olympic Junior Soccer Club Lake Height Junior Football Club. ===Early career=== Sterjovski began his career in Australia at Wollongong Wolves and briefly played for Illawarra Lions before making a name for himself with successful spells at Sydney United and Parramatta Power. ===Lille OSC=== Sterjovski's performances and record of 31 goals in 68 games in three National Soccer League (NSL) seasons earned him a move to French Ligue 1 side Lille in 2000. After 4 seasons at Lille, Sterjovski moved to Swiss side FC Basel. ===FC Basel=== Sterjovski remained at FC Basel for three seasons. In his first season at St. Jakob-Park, he won the Swiss Super League and in his second season was part of the team that reached the UEFA Cup Quarter-finals. Sterjovski moved to Turkey in the summer of 2007. ===Gen\u00e7lerbirli\u011fi=== On 2 September 2007, Sterjovski scored on his debut after coming off the bench for his new club Gen\u00e7lerbirli\u011fi OFTA\u015e (now called Hacettepe Spor Kul\u00fcb\u00fc) in their match against Fenerbah\u00e7e. ===Derby County=== On 9 January 2008, Sterjovski announced his plan to leave Turkey for personal reasons relating to his family. He announced that he was in negotiations with Premier League side Derby County and joined them after work permit problems on 24 January 2008. He made his debut as a substitute against Tottenham in a 3\u20130 defeat, and was a regular in the side towards the end of the season, usually playing out on the right wing. In the 2008\u201309 season, Sterjovski was largely frozen out of the Derby squad by manager Paul Jewell, his first appearance of the season coming on 21 October 2008 against Blackpool, in which he scored his first goal for Derby. However, following Jewell's departure, he produced an impressive performance against Manchester United in the first leg of the League Cup semi-final under caretaker manager David Lowe. New Derby manager Nigel Clough was watching in the stands. Following the match, Sterjovski said: \"Now I am glad there is a new manager. It\u2019s a new start for me and, hopefully, I will get more chances.\" Sterjovski went on to make 14 further appearances before the end of the season, scoring once and playing well in the middle of the injury-hit Derby midfield. ===Return to Australia: Perth Glory=== After initial speculation linking Sterjovski with a move to Gold Coast United, he moved to Perth Glory on 11 June 2009 for an undisclosed fee on a three-year contract as their marquee player. ===Central Coast Mariners=== On 6 July 2012 it was announced he had signed one-year deal to play for Central Coast Mariners. On 5 February 2014, Sterjovski announced that he will retire at the end of the season. ==International career== Sterjovski with Australia in 2007 Sterjovski made his Australian national team debut against Scotland in 2000.

In the finals he started in the games against Brazil and against Croatia. Sterjovski was selected for the first group match in Australia's 2007 Asian Cup campaign, starting against Oman and substituted in the 46th minute, which Australia drew 1\u20131. Due to illness Sterjovski did not feature further in Australia's failed campaign in its first Asian Cup. Sterjovski scored against Ghana during a friendly match at the Sydney Football Stadium, but was sent off in the 85th minute after receiving a second yellow card for a tackle on Ghana's Richard Manu. He scored again on 20 August in a friendly against South Africa in which the Socceroos drew 2\u20132.
