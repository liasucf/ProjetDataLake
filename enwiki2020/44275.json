Formerly, there was a U.S. Secretary of Commerce and Labor, who led this department along with the U.S. Department of Commerce as one department. Since the two departments split in 1913, the Department of Commerce is now headed by a separate U.S. Secretary of Commerce. Eugene Scalia, a son of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, has served as Secretary of Labor since September 30, 2019.
