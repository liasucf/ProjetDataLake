    "text": "{| |} Dupleix is a F70 type anti-submarine frigate of the French Navy. She is the fourth French vessel (beside also two French commercial ships) named after the 18th century Governor of Pondich\u00e9ry and Governor-General of the French possessions in India marquess Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix. Note: The French navy doesn't use the term \"destroyer\" for its ships; hence some large ships, referred to as \"frigates\", are registered as destroyers.
