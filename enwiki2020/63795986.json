    "text": "Lee Byung-il (1910-1978) was a South Korean film director and producer. He debuted with Spring on the Korean Peninsula in 1941, when Korea was still under the Japanese rule. His best known film, The Wedding Day (1956), was screened at the Berlin Film Festival - the first Korean film to do so. Today considered a classic, it has been listed as a Registered Cultural Property by the Korean Government in 2007 and chosen by Korea Post to be commemorated in a 2008 special stamps edition together with three other representative films from 1940-60s. His next film, The Love Marriage (1958), won a special comedy award at Asia-Pacific Film Festival. In his later years he was more active as a producer. ==Filmography as director== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Title !Hangul title !Romanization !Hanja title !Notes |- |1941 |Spring of Korean Peninsula |\ubc18\ub3c4\uc758 \ubd04 |Ban-do-ui bom | | |- |1956 |The Wedding Day |\uc2dc\uc9d1\uac00\ub294 \ub0a0 |Sijibganeun nal | | |- |1958 |The Love Marriage |\uc790\uc720\uacb0\ud63c |Ja-yugyeolhon |\u81ea\u7531\u7d50\u5a5a | |- |1959 |A Youth Diary |\uccad\ucd98\uc77c\uae30 |Cheongchun-ilgi | | |- |1962 |The Way to Seoul |\uc11c\uc6b8\ub85c \uac00\ub294 \uae38 |Seoullo Ganeun Gil | | |- |1963 |A Returning Ship |\uadc0\uad6d\uc120 |Gwigukseon | | |- |1964 |The Peacock Lady |\uacf5\uc791\ubd80\uc778 |Gongjakbu-in | |Co-directed with Lee Sang-eon (\uc774\uc0c1\uc5b8) |} == See also == *List of Korean film directors *Cinema of Korea == References == == External links == * * Category:1910 births Category:People from Hamhung Category:South Korean film directors Category:1978 deaths ",
