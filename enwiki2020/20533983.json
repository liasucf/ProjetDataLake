    "text": "The Tee Bird is the 94th animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on August 10, 1959, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. ==Plot== On the Pebbley Beach Golf Course, Dapper Denver Dooley and Woody Woodpecker are in a championship playoff. The prize: $25,000. After both contenders make holes in one, a psychological battle begins. Woody crunches celery. Dapper drives himself into a sand trap. Woody proves himself too light for quicksand; Dapper sinks. At every turn, Dapper proceeds to lure and trick poor Woody until Woody's game seems lost. All that Dapper needs to win is a short putt into the cup, but he's seized with a magnificent case of hiccups. Woody wins and hiccups dollar bills! ==Notes== The Tee Bird marked Dapper Denver Dooley's final appearance in a Woody theatrical \"cartune\". He had replaced Buzz Buzzard as Woody's main foil a few years back, and would eventually be replaced himself by Gabby Gator. ==References== *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \"1959\".
