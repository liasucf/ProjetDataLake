Baxter has achieved board certifications through the American Board of Surgery (2000) and the American Board of Colon and Rectal Surgery (2002). She is a Fellow of both the American College of Surgeons and the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. thumb She served as the Associate Dean, Academic Affairs at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health from 2016 through 2020.

She obtained her medical doctorate (1990) and PhD in Clinical Epidemiology (1998) from the University of Toronto. She completed her general surgery residency training at the University of Toronto from 1991\u20131999, followed by a fellowship in colorectal surgery at the Mayo Clinic in 2001. From 2002 to 2005, she held the rank of assistant professor of surgery at the University of Minnesota and a staff position as a colorectal surgeon at the University of Minnesota Fairview Hospital. Baxter relocated back to Toronto in 2006 with the academic rank of assistant professor at the University of Toronto and staff colorectal surgeon at St. Michael's Hospital. She was promoted to the rank of associate professor of surgery in 2008. In 2013 she was selected as the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Traveling Fellow to Australia and New Zealand (ANZ). She has been a full professor at the University of Toronto since 2015. In September 2016 Baxter was inducted as a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences. Fellows are elected to the Academy by their peers for their \"contributions to the promotion of health science (based on) demonstrated leadership, creativity, distinctive competencies and a commitment to advance academic health science.\" == Research == Baxter's primary research focus as a clinical epidemiologist and health services researcher is the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening, long-term survivorship of cancer survivors and quality of surgical care. She also applies the use of linked health administrative data and cancer registry data to evaluate long-term consequences of cancer care for adults. She has published more than 200 peer- reviewed publications in journals such as New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), Journal of Clinical Oncology, Annals of Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal and the Canadian Medical Association Journal. In 2008 Baxter led a study that found colonoscopy was less effective at finding cancers on the right side and therefore reduced mortality only from left-side tumors. In 2014 the Canadian Cancer Society announced funding for a project led by Baxter to create a clinical decision-making tool designed to help young cancer patients make choices about preserving their fertility after cancer treatment. In 2015 Baxter led a study that showed that patients having elective surgery during the day fare no better or worse if the doctor operating has worked the night before. A 2016 study led by Baxter showed that organ transplant recipients have a higher-than-average risk of dying from cancer, possibly warranting increased prevention and screening measures. == References == == External links == * Nancy Baxter citations in PubMed * Nancy Baxter H-index on Google Scholar * Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences Category:Canadian surgeons Category:University of Toronto faculty Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ",
