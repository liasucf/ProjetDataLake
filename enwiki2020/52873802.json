The club's new chairman was Ernst-Alfred Thalmann, who took over the presidency from Charlie Volderauer at the AGM. He was the fourth chairman in the club's history. FC Basel played their home games in the Landhof in the Quarter Kleinbasel. == Overview == The first national championship in Switzerland took place in 1897\u201398. This championship is considered as unofficial because it was not organized by the Swiss Football Association (SFA; founded in 1895). FC Basel did not participate in this first championship. But they did in the second edition during the season 1898\u201399. The club did not compete in the following season either. But they have participated in every season since. The Serie A 1900\u201301 was divided into two groups, an east and a west group. Basel were with three teams from Z\u00fcrich, Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich, FC Z\u00fcrich, Fire Flies Z\u00fcrich and two other teams from Basel, Old Boys and Fortuna Basel. There were four teams in the west group. Basel ended the season with two victories, two draws and six defeats in 5th position in their group. From this east group the Grasshoppers qualified themselves for the finals against FC Bern, who were the winners of the west group. == Players == == Results == === Serie A === ==== Group east league table ==== ==See also== * History of FC Basel * List of FC Basel players * List of FC Basel seasons == Sources == * Rotblau: Jahrbuch Saison 2014/2015.
