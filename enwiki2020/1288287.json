It specializes in obscure and rare recordings from the 1950s to the 1970s.Discogs - Sundazed Music In 2000, Sundazed had a staff of 15 and two mixing studios, including a vintage audio equipment collection. ==History== Label founders Bob Irwin and his wife Mary started the label in 1989. Irwin's skill at restoring old vinyl records for the (then new) CD format, attracted the attention of major labels, who increasingly solicited him to help them re- issue material from their back catalogs. He helped Sony Music release their archival Legacy Records label. Later, his restoration work included early material by the likes of Bob Dylan, Nancy Sinatra, and the Byrds. Irwin also worked at Arista for a time. The first Sundazed releases were 1960s recordings by the Knickerbockers and the Five Americans, and reflected Irwin's personal preference for garage rock and surf music. Later releases included the albums of the Turtles, the Challengers, Liverpool Five, and Jan and Dean's long-lost album Save for a Rainy Day. The company reissued the complete catalog of LPs by New Orleans funk pioneers the Meters on vinyl and CD. The label later ventured into country music, including extensive reissues of Capitol Records albums by Buck Owens and other acts including Jimmy Bryant. Sundazed also issued vintage jazz guitar albums through their Euphoria label. ==Reissues== In 1995, Sundazed released a 20 track CD by The Pyramids, Penetration! The Best of the Pyramids. Bob Irwin worked closely with John Hodge the manager and producer for the Pyramids. Hodge owned the masters for the original recordings which included the unissued music. Hodge also had a strong love of the music. Irwin was also planning a second release of their work. It was to be a \"Lost Pyramids\" album of unreleased material.Billboard, August 10, 1995 - Page 87 REVERSE TAKEOFF: SURF'N'ROD MUSIC REVIVALS INTENSIFIES He also did the same for The Revels, the Impact Records recording artists who had a hit with \"Church Key.Real Life Rock: The Complete Top Ten Columns, 1986-2014, By Greil Marcus - Page 403Billboard, August 10, 1995 - Page 87 REVERSE TAKEOFF: SURF'N'ROD MUSIC REVIVALS INTENSIFIESBecoming the Beach Boys, 1961-1963, By James B.
