    "text": "Oxycodone/paracetamol, sold under the brand name Percocet among others, is a combination of the opioid oxycodone with paracetamol (acetaminophen), used to treat moderate to severe short-term pain. ==History== The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first approved Percocet in 1976, under application ANDA 085106. ==Formulation== As of August 2014, Endo International produces Percocet in the following dosages. Percocet tablets are available in four combinations of oxycodone hydrochloride with 325 mg of paracetamol (acetaminophen), each having different appearances and usual maximum daily doses: Due to the liver toxicity of paracetamol, the manufacturer and FDA dosage guidelines suggest no more than 4,000 mg total of paracetamol be taken per day, which would be 12 or fewer Percocet tablets per day as each one contains 325 mg. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !

In December 2009, the Canadian Medical Association Journal reported a study finding a fivefold increase in oxycodone- related deaths in Ontario (mostly accidental) between 1991 and 2007 that led to a doubling of all opioid-related deaths in Ontario over the same period. In March 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump initiated the Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission. In July 2017, an interim report was published.
