Wren, her works included the Conan Flagg Mystery series, the Phoenix Legacy, a space opera trilogy, and A Gift Upon the Shore (1990), a post-apocalyptic novel. Publishers Weekly in its review of A Gift Upon the Shore described Wren's descriptions of \"the subsistence-level daily life \u2013 the triumphs, the losses and the desperation\" \u2013 as \"compelling depictions.\" A Los Angeles Times review called Wren\u2019s writing of the same book as \"clear and concise for the most part, though bordering on the mystic when it comes to her descriptions of the woods, and especially the ocean in its many moods.\" The New York Times included it in its overview of recently released crime/suspense novels in its \"Criminal At Large\" column, describing Wren's A Multitude of Sins as \"an artificial and pretentious formula mystery about an heiress who is a pianistic genius.\" The Conan Flagg mysteries were translated into German and released by M\u00fcnchen Goldmann publisher in the late 1970s in Germany. == Personal life == Renfroe was a longtime resident of Lincoln City, Oregon. She was also an artist whose artwork showed in galleries and at juried and invitational shows. == Bibliography == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Title !Publisher !Date !ISBN |- |A Gift Upon the Shore |Ballantine Books | | |- |Neely Jones: The Medusa Pool |Minotaur Books | | |- |The Shadow of Light (unpublished) | colspan=\"3\" | |} === A Conan Flagg Mystery (1973\u20131994) === {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !Title !Publisher !Date !ISBN |- |1 |Curiosity Didn't Kill the Cat | rowspan=\"6\" |Doubleday |January 1973 | |- |2 |A Multitude of Sins |January 1975 | |- |3 |Oh, Bury Me Not |January 1976 | |- |4 |Nothing's Certain but Death |January 1978 | |- |5 |Seasons of Death |April 1981 | |- |6 |Wake Up, Darlin' Corey |January 1984 | |- |7 |Dead Matter | rowspan=\"2\" |Fawcett | | |- |8 |King of the Mountain | | |} === Phoenix Legacy (1981) === {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !Title !Publisher !Date !ISBN |- |1 |Sword of the Lamb | rowspan=\"3\" |Berkley |February 1981 | |- |2 |Shadow of the Swan |July 1981 | |- |3 |House of the Wolf |October 1981 | |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:20th- century American novelists Category:American mystery writers Category:American science fiction writers Category:American women novelists Category:Pseudonymous writers Category:Pseudonymous women writers Category:Novelists from Oregon Category:Novelists from Texas Category:People from Amarillo, Texas Category:1938 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Women science fiction and fantasy writers Category:Women mystery writers Category:20th-century American women writers Category:Lesbian writers ",
