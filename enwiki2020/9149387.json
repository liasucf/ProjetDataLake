    "text": "Dickey Betts & Great Southern is the second studio album by Dickey Betts of The Allman Brothers Band. It was recorded with his band Great Southern in 1977. The standout tracks are \"Sweet Virginia\" and the extended-jam \"Bougainvillea\", which was co-written by Don Johnson of Miami Vice fame. ==Critical reception== On AllMusic, Tom Jurek wrote, \"Attempting to capture the loose, easy feel of Highway Call and combine it with the more blues-driven sound of the Allmans, Betts was largely successful though the record does suffer a tad from overly slick production.... Great Southern is a very fine album that despite its polish holds a wealth of fine songs and truly astonishing playing within its grooves.\" ==Track listing== #\"Out to Get Me\" (Dickey Betts) \u2013 4:45 #\"Run Gypsy Run\" (Betts, Curtis Buck, Jim Paramore) \u2013 3:34 #\"Sweet Virginia\" (Betts) \u2013 3:44 #\"The Way Love Goes\" (Betts) \u2013 5:03 #\"Nothing You Can Do\" (Betts) \u2013 5:05 #\"California Blues\" (Betts) \u2013 5:04 #\"Bougainvillea\" (Betts, Don Johnson) - 7:16 ==Personnel== Great Southern *Dickey Betts \u2013 electric guitar, slide guitar, lead vocals *\"Dangerous Dan\" Toler \u2013 electric guitar, acoustic guitar, background vocals *Tom Broome \u2013 keyboards, background vocals *Ken Tibbets \u2013 bass *Jerry Thompson \u2013 drums, percussion *Donnie Sharbono \u2013 drums, percussion Additional musicians *Don Johnson \u2013 background vocals on \"Bougainvillea\" *Topper Price \u2013 harmonica on \"Out to Get Me\", \"Run Gypsy Run\" *Mickey Thomas \u2013 background vocals on \"Nothing You Can Do\" Production *Produced by Dickey Betts *Recording, production assistant: Steve Klein *Assistant engineer: Stephen Hart *Mixing: Johnny Sandlin, Buddy Thornton *Mastering: George Marino *Art Direction: Bob Heimall *Photography: Benno Friedman ==References== Category:Dickey Betts albums Category:1977 albums Category:Arista Records albums ",
