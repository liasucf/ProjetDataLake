    "text": "New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) are pollution control standards issued by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The term is used in the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970 (CAA) to refer to air pollution emission standards, and in the Clean Water Act (CWA) referring to standards for water pollution discharges of industrial wastewater to surface waters. == Introduction == Some pollution control laws are organized with varying degrees of stringency. The different standards may be based on several factors, including whether the pollution source is an existing facility at the time the standard is published, or is constructed after publication. The standards for new sources may be more stringent than that for existing facilities, on the principle that a new plant can be designed with the latest and most advanced control technologies. == Clean Air Act == The Clean Air Act NSPS dictate the level of pollution that a new stationary source may produce. These standards are authorized by Section 111 of the CAAUnited States. Clean Air Act, section 111, . and the regulations are published in 40 CFR Part 60.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). \"Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources.\" Code of Federal Regulations, . NSPS have been established for a number of individual industrial or source categories. Examples: * Air emissions from chemical manufacturing wastewater 40 CFR Part 60, Subpart YYY. * Boilers 40 CFR Part 60, Subparts D-Dc. * Landfills 40 CFR Part 60, Subparts Cc and WWW. * Petroleum refineries 40 CFR Part 60, Subparts J & Ja. * Stationary gas turbines. 40 CFR part 60, Subpart GG. ===Basic process for establishing standards=== #Identify type of emitting facility. #For each type of facility, identify the type of pollutant control technology that is appropriate. #From a study of all the plants and all the information available about the plants and their technologies, establish an allowed concentration of the criteria pollutants that is the upper limit of what can be emitted. == Clean Water Act == Under the Clean Water Act, NSPS set the level of allowable wastewater discharges from new industrial facilities. EPA issues NSPS for categories of industrial dischargers, typically in conjunction with the issuance of effluent guidelines for existing sources. In developing NSPS, the CWA requires that EPA determine the \"best available demonstrated control technology\" (BADCT) for the particular industrial category. BADCT may be more stringent than the best available technology economically achievable standard used for existing dischargers. This consideration may include setting a \"no discharge of pollutants standard\" (also called a \"zero discharge\" standard) if practicable.U.S. Clean Water Act, section 306(a), . NSPS regulations are published at 40 CFR Subchapter N (Parts 405-499). NSPS issued by EPA include the following categories: * Coal MiningEPA, Coal Mining Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. . * Dairy ProductsEPA, Dairy Products Processing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. . * Inorganic Chemicals Manufacturing (including a zero discharge requirement for several subcategories)EPA, Inorganic Chemicals Manufacturing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. . * Iron and Steel ManufacturingEPA, Iron and Steel Manufacturing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. . * Oil and Gas ExtractionEPA, Oil and Gas Extraction Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. . * Petroleum RefiningEPA, Petroleum Refining Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. . * Pulp, Paper and PaperboardEPA, Pulp, Paper and Paperboard Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. . * Sugar Processing (including a zero discharge requirement for one subcategory)EPA, Sugar Processing Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. . * Textile Mills.EPA, Textile Mills Point Source Category Effluent Guidelines and Standards. . EPA has published a general definition of \"new source\" in the federal wastewater permit regulations. \"EPA Administered Permit Programs: The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.\" Code of Federal Regulations, . More specialized definitions of \"new source\" are included in some of the individual category regulations, e.g., the definition for the Pulp, Paper and Paperboard category.EPA, Pulp, Paper and Paperboard Point Source Category.
