    "text": "Manoel Nunes (March 7, 1895 \u2013 May 31, 1977), also known as Neco, was an association football midfielder. With great skill and tenacity, he was the first idol of Corinthians, being the first player to get a statue in the team's gardens (in 1929). As of 2006, Neco is the player who played the longest for Corinthians: 17 years. Called often to the Brazilian national team, he won two South American Championships: 1919 (team's top scorer) and 1922 (top scorer). Playing for Corinthians, he won the Paulista League eight times as a player (being top scorer in 1914 and 1920) and once as a coach (1937). Neco had a quick temper and frequently got involved in fights; his second stint as a manager occurred because he was suspended as a player for 18 games when he beat a referee. He started in the third team of Corinthians at the age of 16 and joined the first team in 1913 (the first year Corinthians participated in official competitions). In 1915, Corinthians did not play official games because of political issues and almost went bankrupt; this year, Neco played friendlies for Corinthians and the official games for Mackenzie. During this time, he broke into the Corinthians building to retrieve books that the landlord had locked inside due to non-payment of the rent. After scoring two goals playing for Brazil against Uruguay in the 2x2 tie valid for the 1919 South American Championship in Rio de Janeiro, Neco returned to his regular job as a carpenter in S\u00e3o Paulo and was fired for missing work. ==Statistical career overview== ===Player=== Teams: * 1917\u20131922: Brazil (14 matches / 9 goals / official internationals only) * 1913\u20131914: SC Corinthians Paulista * 1915: AA Mackenzie College * 1916\u20131930: SC Corinthians Paulista Honours: * Copa Am\u00e9rica: 1919, 1922 * Campeonato Paulista: 1914, 1916, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1928, 1930 Top Scorer: * Copa Am\u00e9rica: 1919 (4 goals) * Campeonato Paulista: 1914 (12 goals) * Campeonato Paulista: 1920 (24 goals) ===Coach=== Clubs: * SC Corinthians Paulista : 1920, 1927, 1937\u201338 Honours: * Campeonato Paulista: 1937 ==External links== *Profile at cbf.com.br Category:1895 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Sportspeople from S\u00e3o Paulo Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazil international footballers Category:Sport Club Corinthians Paulista players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Brazilian football managers Category:Sport Club Corinthians Paulista managers Category:Copa Am\u00e9rica-winning players Category:Association football forwards ",
