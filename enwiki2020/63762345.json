    "text": "Holly Gibney is a fictional character created by American author Stephen King. Originally appearing in the Bill Hodges trilogy of novels (Mr. Mercedes, Finders Keepers and End of Watch), she later appears as a major supporting character in The Outsider and as the main character in If It Bleeds, a novella included in the collection of the same name. She has been portrayed on screen by Justine Lupe in the television adaptation of the Hodges trilogy and by Cynthia Erivo in the miniseries adaptation of The Outsider. == Character biography == === Mr. Mercedes === === Finders Keepers === === End of Watch === === The Outsider === === If It Bleeds === == Characterization in The Outsider miniseries == Richard Price, the developer and showrunner of the miniseries adaptation of The Outsider reworked the character to some extent, without keeping the continuity with the Mr. Mercedes TV series or Bill Hodges novels (Price did not watch the series or read the novels), and asked Stephen King to rename the character, but King insisted on keeping the name Holly Gibney. == Reception == King has gone on record as loving the character, saying in a 2020 NPR interview: \"I just love Holly, and I wish she were a real person. [...] She just walked on in the first book she was in, Mr. Mercedes, and she more or less stole the book, and she stole my heart.\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/08/829298135/stephen-king-is-sorry-you- feel-like-youre-stuck-in-a-stephen-king-novel == References == == External links == Category:Stephen King characters Category:Fictional characters introduced in 2014 ",
