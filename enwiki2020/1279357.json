Other notable clients include: * Winona Ryder \u2013 In December 2002, Geragos defended Academy Award-nominated actress Winona Ryder on charges of stealing more than $5,500 worth of merchandise from a Beverly Hills, California store in 2001. With the help from Geragos, she was only sentenced to three years' probation and ordered to undergo psychological and drug counseling. * Michael Jackson \u2013 In the early stages of the Michael Jackson molestation case, Geragos simultaneously handled this case and the Scott Peterson's case, two of the best-known U.S. trials at that time. Geragos's \"crushingly busy calendar\" in the courtroom earned him a rebuke by a judge in an embezzlement case Geragos was also representing.Judge Grills Geragos On Workload On April 26, 2004, Jackson removed Geragos as his attorney, replacing him with Thomas Mesereau. In a public statement provided by his spokesperson, Raymone Bain, Jackson stated, \"It is imperative that I have the full attention of those who are representing me. My life is at stake...\" suggesting that Geragos may not have had enough time to handle his case because of his workload. Geragos later said that he was dismayed to see Jackson climb atop an SUV to the cheers of his fans after leaving the Santa Barbara County, California courthouse in January 2004, when he was first arraigned on the initial complaint.Waxman, Sharon. \"Jackson Says 'Full Attention' Of Legal Team Was Lacking.\" The New York Times, April 27, 2004, p. A-23 Geragos's co-counsel, Benjamin Brafman, also expressed disapproval of Jackson's actions. \"Although [in January] the lawyers explained the behavior as 'Michael being Michael',\" The New York Times reported, \"they are said to have privately expressed consternation at the display of frivolity in the face of serious charges.\" * Roger Clinton Jr. \u2013 Geragos won dismissal of all alcohol-related charges against former President Clinton's brother. * Carradine family \u2013 He assisted the family of actor David Carradine in the aftermath of his accidental death.\"Carradine mystery deepens, family seeks FBI help\" By loy Chitsomboon and Bob Tourtellotte (Reuters) Geragos had previously represented a class of plaintiffs that had included actor Keith Carradine, his spouse, actress , attorney Stephen Kolodny, and designer Donna Dubrow in a class-action lawsuit related to private investigator Anthony Pellicano's illegal wiretapping conspiracy and subsequent conviction. * Greg Anderson \u2013 In 2006, Geragos represented Anderson, who was most notably the personal trainer of Barry Bonds. On July 5, 2006, Anderson was found in contempt of court by U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who jailed Anderson for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury investigating perjury accusations against Bonds. Geragos announced that he would file an appeal based on his assertion that the subpoena to testify violated Anderson's July 2005 plea bargain agreement in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative case. Anderson was to be held until he agreed to testify or until the grand jury's term expired. Geragos insisted that his client would not testify.news.yahoo.com The grand jury expired on July 20, 2006, and Anderson was released from prison two weeks later. On August 28, 2006, Anderson was again found in contempt of court for refusing to testify before a newly convened grand jury and sentenced to prison.

Anderson was later sent back to jail on November 16, 2006. * Cameron Brown \u2013 He was the attorney for Brown, who was charged with murdering his four-year-old daughter by throwing her off a Rancho Palos Verdes cliff. The twelve-week trial ended in August 2006 without a verdict. The jury deliberated for over nine days but was hopelessly deadlocked and a mistrial was declared by Judge Mark Arnold of the Torrance Superior Court. The case was retried in the fall of 2009 by Pat Harris, an associate at Geragos's firm. The second trial also ended with a hung jury. A third trial saw him convicted. After the second trial resulted in a hung jury, Geragos and his firm turned the case over to attorney Herbert Barrish. While Geragos typically never leaves a client after a hung jury, him and his firm had to leave the case due to economic hardships. * Victor Willis \u2013 In September 2006, Geragos represented the Village People front man on charges of drug and weapons possession. Facing jail time, Geragos successfully negotiated a sentence of three years probation and treatment for drug addiction at the Betty Ford Clinic. * Amphit Dhaliwal and Kulbir Dhaliwal \u2013 In December 2007, the two survivors of the tiger attack at the San Francisco Zoo, hired Geragos to represent them against potential criminal charges, and also with the anticipation of filing a lawsuit against the zoo. Despite pressure from city officials, the local police inspector made it clear that there were no grounds for filing criminal charges against the Dhaliwal brothers related to the tiger attack. Geragos filed a federal suit against the Zoo and the City of San Francisco for violation of the Dhaliwal brothers' civil rights, including the Dhaliwals' being subject to search and seizure without probable cause, and for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Geragos settled the civil suit in the early phase of the court process for $900,000. * Kazuyoshi Miura \u2013 In 2008, he joined the defense of Japanese businessman Miura, who committed suicide before his trial. * Chris Brown \u2013 Geragos represented Brown, who pleaded guilty to the assault of his then-girlfriend, Rihanna. On February 8, 2009 Geragos brought Chris Brown to surrender to the LAPD. Later, Brown was arrested, and his court date was set to be on March 5, 2009. Geragos and Brown attended the court date, but did not plea and asked for arraignment until the next court date, April 6, 2009. On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to one count of felony assault and was sentenced to 5 years' probation and 6 months' community service. However, Brown\u2019s inability to adhere to the rules of his probation \u2013 ultimately led to his dismissal from rehab and the singer was thrown in jail from March 2014 to June of that year. Under counsel from Geragos, Brown was once again released under probation. Early in 2015, Brown's probation was revoked after he was present in two nightclubs where shootings took place. His probation officer had a problem with the singer traveling to San Jose, to perform at the nightclub where an incident occurred leaving five people shot and injured. Brown was aware his probation could end with the hearing, and before entering the courthouse, he tweeted: \u201cHopefully this is my last day in court\u2026. Pray for me.\u201d However, at Brown\u2019s scheduled March 20th court date, with the help of Geragos, Brown\u2019s probation officer reversed course, saying in a positive review that Brown had completed his community service sentence. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James R. Brandlin concurred, ruling the singer would no longer be under the watchful eye of the judicial system. Geragos said this of his client, \u201cHe is in a spot right now and a place right now that I couldn\u2019t be prouder of him,\u201d adding that the end of Brown\u2019s probation is \u201ca monumental feat for him.\u201d * Colin Kaepernick - Former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first filed a grievance against the NFL in October 2017, claiming that the NFL tried to keep him from playing after he chose to kneel during the national anthem. The quarterback opted out of his contract with the 49ers in March of the same year and was not picked up later in free agency. Kaepernick began kneeling during the 2016 season to protest racial inequality and police brutality. Safety Eric Reid and several other NFL players eventually joined him. Reid, a former teammate of Kaepernick's, was also a member of the grievance Kaepernick filed. After several months of ongoing dialogue with representatives of the NFL, both Kaepernick and Reid withdrew their collusion cases against the National Football League. On Feb. 15, both Geragos and co-counsel Ben Meiselas released a joint statement with the NFL, declaring the resolution of the matter was subject to a confidentiality agreement. * Jussie Smollett \u2013 Geragos represented Smollett in the 2019 alleged false police report. On March 12, 2019, it was reported that Chicago prosecutors had dropped all 16 criminal charges against EMPIRE star Jussie Smollett as part of a deferred prosecution agreement against him. As part of the conditions of the deal, Smollett did 16 hours of community service and forfeited his $10,000 bond to the city. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced he wanted Jussie Smollett to cover the cost \u2013amounting to $130,000\u2013 for the Chicago police department\u2019s investigation. Smollett\u2019s attorneys responded in a statement via NBC News that \u201cJussie has paid enough.\u201d Geragos and his firm also filed a motion to seal the case, which was granted by a judge. On April 23, 2019, Geragos was sued, along with Tina Glandian (another member of Smollett's legal team), under claims of defamation and false light by the Osundairo brothers (originally arrested in connection with an alleged attack on the actor.) However, a defamatory quote the Osundairos attributed to Glandian and Geragos in their lawsuit was in fact, said by their own attorney, Gloria Schmidt. The Osundairo brothers also paraphrased statements they claimed Geragos said on the podcast REASONABLE DOUBT (which Mark co-hosts with comic Adam Carolla), alleging Geragos dragged their reps through the mud by indicating the brothers had attacked Jussie, committed perjury and conspired to make false statements to clear their names. Geragos submitted transcripts of his podcast during the time of the criminal legal proceedings, noting he never said the brothers' names, nor did he say or indicate what they attributed to him. The case was dismissed by the judge. * Partridge v. Benton - In March of 2018, Chief U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted the city of Benton, Arkansas a motion to dismiss a lawsuit that Keagan Schweikle's parents, Piper Partridge and Dominic Schweikle, had filed against the city\u2019s officer,Kyle Ellison, and its police chief at the time, Kirk Lane. However, on July 3, 2019, a federal appeals court reinstated a lawsuit filed in 2017 against Benton police by the parents of the suicidal 17-year-old boy (Keagan) who was shot and killed while complying with an officer's order (Kyle Ellison) to move a gun away from his head. Filed by Geragos, (and Little Rock attorney Rick Holiman), the lawsuit alleged that Ellison used excessive force when he fired three shots at Schweikle as he stood on a bank facing the river and holding a gun in his right hand after threatening to shoot himself. Miller said that after Ellison ordered Schweikle to drop the gun and the boy moved it away from his head, the intention behind his actions was ambiguous, leaving the officer little choice but to shoot. Miller noted, \"Keagan could have quickly pointed the gun at Ellison and opened fire almost instantaneously. ... Ellison had a right to protect himself.\" A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis said Miller ruled on the matter too early in the process. And Holiman and Geragos argued the case. When Schweikle's parents were told the lawsuit was moving forward again, the parents broke down in tears. Holiman added, \"We think it's the right decision.\" * Scottie Pippen - In February of 2014, Scottie Pippen hired Geragos to file a countersuit against a Malibu man who alleged the former NBA All-Star assaulted him at a restaurant last year. Camran Shafighi filed a $4-million lawsuit against Pippen, accusing him of a \u201cbrutal and unjustified physical attack\" that allegedly occurred outside upscale Nobu restaurant after Shafighi had sought a picture with the former Chicago Bull. In the cross- complaint filed by Geragos earlier in February, alleged Shafighi cursed at Pippen using racial slurs, spat on him and his children and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d The cross-complaint also alleged that Shafighi was \u201cextremely aggressive and noticeably intoxicated\u201d and calls for unspecified damages \u201caccording to proof.\u201d * Keagan Schweikle - In 2019, an 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court finding that a Benton police officer Kyle Ellison had acted reasonably when he fatally shot a suicidal teen, Keagan Schweikle, in October 2016. In March of 2018, Chief U.S. District Judge Brian Miller granted the city's motion to dismiss the lawsuit that Keagan Schweikle's parents, Piper Partridge and Dominic Schweikle, had filed against the city, officer Kyle Ellison and its police chief at the time, Kirk Lane. Filed by Little Rock attorney Rick Holiman and Los Angeles attorney Mark Geragos, the lawsuit alleged that Ellison used excessive force when he fired three shots at Schweikle as he stood on a bank facing the river and holding a gun in his right hand after threatening to shoot himself. A panel of federal judges has restored the lawsuit over the officer-involved shooting death of 17-year-old Keagan Schweikle of Benton. * Aron Petrosian - In 2014, Aron Petrosian, who was 17 years old at the time, was speeding in his Chevrolet Camaro at 103mph in Hacienda Heights, Ca. The car crashed into another vehicle resulting in the death of Alicia Rosales and severe injuries to her 10 and 13 year old sons. Despite him being 17, Petrosian was charged in adult criminal court. In August of 2020, a Los Angeles Superior Court Judge reversed and remanded his sentence. Represented by Mark Geragos, Cliff Gardner and Daniel Buffington, after winning the murder case in 2018, he will be re-sentenced for vehicular manslaughter and reckless driving. * Jorge Ramirez - Geragos took on this case in Bakersfield, California in 2014. Jorge Ramirez, a 34-year-old man, was working closely with the Bakersfield Police Department as an informant, when he was shot multiple times by officers Sept. 16 outside the Four Points Sheraton Hotel. Ramirez was unarmed. The fugitive Ramirez was with, Justin Bryan Harger, 32, was also killed after officers confronted them. According to police, Harger first began firing at officers, with one bullet grazing the head of Officer Daniel Brewer, who was hospitalized but released a few hours later. Ramirez\u2019s family and Gergos filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city of Bakersfield. * Travelers Insurance - Mark Geragos and his law firm \u2014 along with multiple clients \u2014 are suing Travelers Insurance for initially denying coverage of their pandemic-related claims. The firm says that while it's technically an essential business and not subject to a mandated shutdown, access to its downtown L.A. office has been \"greatly limited\" and the company has \"been forced to deal with a substantial loss in business traffic and client/law-related business activities.\" ==Media appearances== Geragos occasionally appears as both guest and legal commentator on TV.
