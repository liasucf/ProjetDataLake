The single elimination tournament was played at The Pyramid in Long Beach, California during May 2001. BYU defeated UCLA in the final match, 3\u20130 (30\u201326, 30\u201326, 32\u201330), to win their second national title. The Cougars (23\u20134) were coached by Carl McGown. BYU's Mike Wall was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Wall, along with five other players, comprised the All- Tournament Team. ==Qualification== Until the creation of the NCAA Men's Division III Volleyball Championship in 2012, there was only a single national championship for men's volleyball. As such, all NCAA men's volleyball programs, whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III, were eligible. A total of 4 teams were invited to contest this championship. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team ! Appearance !
