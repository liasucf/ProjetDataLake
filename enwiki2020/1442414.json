    "text": "Marketplace is an American radio program that focuses on business, the economy, and events that influence them. The program was first broadcast in 1989. Hosted by Kai Ryssdal since 2005, the show is produced and distributed by American Public Media. Marketplace is produced in Los Angeles with bureaus in New York, Washington, D.C., Portland, Baltimore, London, and Shanghai. It won a Peabody Award in 2000.60th Annual Peabody Awards, May 2001. ==History== Marketplace was founded in 1989 by James Russell in Long Beach, California. It was initially affiliated with KLON-FM at Cal State\u2014Long Beach and distributed by American Public Radio, later renamed Public Radio International. The show nearly ran out of funding its first year, which Russell described, saying, \"We were within three days of laying off our small staff and closing down.\" The program survived through the help of the University of Southern California (USC), who acquired the show, and later, in 1990, with the underwriting of General Electric. USC became the only university in the US at the time to produce a daily news program distributed nationally. In 2000, Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) acquired Marketplace Productions from USC. This acquisition was the subject of a lawsuit by Public Radio International. In 2004, American Public Media was founded as the production and distribution arm of MPR, and is currently the producer and distributor of Marketplace. ==Demographics== As of 2014, Marketplaces programs reached upwards of 12 million listeners with an average income of $101,000. == Companion programs == A sister program, the Marketplace Morning Report, offers seven unique seven-minute, thirty-second morning broadcasts that replace the business news-oriented \"E\" segment of NPR's Morning Edition on many public radio stations. Since September 2014, Marketplace Morning Report has been incorporated into Morning Edition as a segment in the latter program's second hour. The Marketplace brand also took over the money advice program Sound Money, which was renamed Marketplace Money in 2005, with content oriented toward a personal finance theme. The three shows share reporters and editorial staff. Marketplace Money was replaced with Marketplace Weekend in June 2014. Marketplace Weekend was cancelled in 2018. ===Podcasts=== All four radio programs are made available as free podcasts, along with a podcast combining all shows. In 2015, Marketplace began to offer digital-only (non-broadcast content) podcasts: Actuality, Codebreaker, and Corner Office. In 2016, The Uncertain Hour and Make Me Smart with Kai and Molly were added. ==Awards== Marketplace has been the recipient of multiple awards, including: * Emmy (2013): Big Sky, Big Money * Edward R. Murrow Prize (2012): The Chinese Student Syndrome * National Headliner Award (2007): Labor Shortage * Peabody Award (2000): Radio ==Staff== ===Hosts=== * Kai Ryssdal \u2013 Marketplace, Corner Office, Make Me Smart with Kai and Molly * David Brancaccio \u2013 Marketplace Morning Report * Lizzie O'Leary \u2013 Marketplace Weekend * Molly Wood \u2013 backup host, Silicon Valley/Senior tech correspondent, Make Me Smart with Kai and Molly * Sabri Ben-Achour, Tim Fernholz \u2013 Actuality * Krissy Clark \u2013 The Uncertain Hour * Anu Anand \u2013 Marketplace Morning Report from the BBC World Service * Reema Khrais \u2013 This Is Uncomfortable ===Contributors=== * Stephen Beard \u2013 Bureau Chief, London * Nancy Marshall-Genzer \u2013 Senior Reporter, Washington * Kimberly Adams \u2013 Reporter, Washington * Scott Tong \u2013 Sustainability Correspondent, Washington * Amy Scott \u2013 Education Correspondent, Baltimore * Annie Baxter \u2013 Senior Reporter, St. Paul * Rob Schmitz \u2013 Bureau Chief, Shanghai * Krissy Clark \u2013 Wealth and Poverty Senior Correspondent, Los Angeles * Adriene Hill \u2013 Correspondent, Los Angeles * Andy Uhler \u2013 Reporter, Los Angeles * Mitchel Hartman \u2013 Entrepreneurship Senior Reporter, Portland * Dan Gorenstein \u2013 Health Senior Reporter, Philadelphia * Mark Garrison, Reporter, New York * Sabri Ben-Achour \u2013 Reporter, New York *Meghan McCarty Carino \u2013 Workplace Culture Reporter * Molly Wood \u2013 Senior Tech Correspondent, San Francisco Bay Area ===Former lead anchors=== * David Brown (2003\u20132005) * David Brancaccio (1993\u20132003) * Jim Angle (1990\u20131993) == References == == External links == * Category:American Public Media programs Category:Peabody Award-winning radio programs Category:Audio podcasts Category:Programs of the University of Southern California Category:Business and finance podcasts Category:1989 radio programme debuts ",
