    "text": "Deuces are Wild is an ongoing concert residency by American hard rock band Aerosmith that runs from April 2019 through July 2020, with 50 concerts at the Park Theater in Las Vegas, nine concerts at three MGM venues on the East Coast (three shows at the MGM National Harbor in Maryland, two shows at the Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and four shows at the MassMutual Center in Massachusetts), as well as festival performances in Minnesota and Ontario. This marks Aerosmith's first concert residency. The residency originally consisted of 18 Las Vegas concerts scheduled from April through July, but 17 additional Vegas concerts and the nine East Coast concerts were added due to high demand. An additional 15 shows in 2020 were added due to continued demand. The band announced a six week European leg will take place during the summer of 2020. Aerosmith announced the residency at an appearance on NBC's Today show on August 15, 2018. The name of the residency, \"Deuces are Wild\", is a reference to both Las Vegas casino gambling and their 1994 single of the same name. ==Shows== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+ List of concerts, showing date, city, and venue |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\" |Date ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" |City ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\" |Venue |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Leg 1 |- |April 6, 2019 |rowspan=\"9\"|Las Vegas |rowspan=\"9\"|Park Theater |- |April 8, 2019 |- |April 11, 2019 |- |April 13, 2019 |- |April 16, 2019 |- |April 18, 2019 |- |April 21, 2019 |- |April 23, 2019 |- |April 26, 2019 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Leg 2 |- |June 19, 2019 |rowspan=\"9\"|Las Vegas |rowspan=\"9\"|Park Theater |- |June 22, 2019 |- |June 24, 2019 |- |June 27, 2019 |- |June 29, 2019 |- |July 2, 2019 |- |July 4, 2019 |- |July 7, 2019 |- |July 9, 2019 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Festivals |- |July 14, 2019 |Clearview, Ontario |Roxodus at Evendale Aerodrome (Cancelled due to weather) |- |July 19, 2019 |Shakopee, Minnesota |Twin Cities Summer Jam at Canterbury Park |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Leg 3 |- |August 8, 2019 |rowspan=\"3\"|Oxon Hill, Maryland |rowspan=\"3\"|The Theater at MGM National Harbor |- |August 10, 2019 |- |August 13, 2019 |- |August 16, 2019 |rowspan=\"2\" |Atlantic City, New Jersey |rowspan=\"2\" |Borgata Event Center |- |August 18, 2019 |- |August 21, 2019 |rowspan=\"4\" |Springfield, Massachusetts |rowspan=\"4\" |MassMutual Center |- |August 24, 2019 |- |August 26, 2019 |- |August 29, 2019 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Leg 4 |- |September 21, 2019 |rowspan=\"8\"|Las Vegas |rowspan=\"8\"|Park Theater |- |September 23, 2019 |- |September 26, 2019 |- |September 28, 2019 |- |October 1, 2019 |- |October 3, 2019 |- |October 6, 2019 |- |October 8, 2019 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Leg 5 |- |November 14, 2019 |rowspan=\"9\"|Las Vegas |rowspan=\"9\"|Park Theater |- |November 16, 2019 |- |November 19, 2019 |- |November 21, 2019 |- |November 24, 2019 |- |November 26, 2019 |- |November 29, 2019 |- |December 1, 2019 |- |December 4, 2019 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Leg 6 |- |January 29, 2020 |rowspan=\"8\"|Las Vegas |rowspan=\"8\"|Park Theater |- |January 31, 2020 |- |February 3, 2020 |- |February 5, 2020 |- |February 8, 2020 |- |February 10, 2020 |- |February 13, 2020 |- |February 15, 2020 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Leg 7 |- |May 20, 2020 |rowspan=\"7\"|Las Vegas |rowspan=\"7\"|Park Theater |- |May 23, 2020 |- |May 25, 2020 |- |May 28, 2020 |- |May 30, 2020 |- |June 2, 2020 |- |June 4, 2020 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Leg 8 |- |June 13, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |Milan |rowspan=\"1\" |I-Days Festival |- |June 16, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |Zurich |rowspan=\"1\" |Hallenstadion |- |June 21, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |Dessel |rowspan=\"1\" |Graspop Metal Meeting |- |June 24, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |Prague |rowspan=\"1\" |O2 Arena (Prague) |- |June 30, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |Paris |rowspan=\"1\" |AccorHotels Arena |- |July 3, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |Madrid |rowspan=\"1\" |Wanda Metropolitano |- |July 6, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |Lisbon |rowspan=\"1\" |Altice Arena |- |July 9, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |Vienna |rowspan=\"1\" |Wiener Stadthalle |- |July 12, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |Krakow |rowspan=\"1\" |Tauron Arena Krak\u00f3w |- |July 15, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |London |rowspan=\"1\" |The O2 Arena |- |July 18, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |Manchester |rowspan=\"1\" |Manchester Arena |- |July 21, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |Middelfart |rowspan=\"1\" |Rock under the Bridge |- |July 24, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |Budapest |rowspan=\"1\" |Pusk\u00e1s Ar\u00e9na |- |July 27, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |M\u00f6nchengladbach |rowspan=\"1\" |Warsteiner HockeyPark |- |July 30, 2020 |rowspan=\"1\" |Moscow |rowspan=\"1\" |VTB Arena |- |} Source: ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 concert residencies Category:Concert residencies in the Las Vegas Valley Category:Aerosmith concert tours Category:Park MGM ",
