This is part of the Northern service link between Preston and Manchester. Until 1960 Adlington was also served by a station named White Bear (on the Lancashire Union Railway). ==History== On 15 June 1837 by act of Parliament, the Bolton and Preston Railway Company constructed a link with the Manchester line comprising nine and a half miles of railway to a temporary terminus at Rawlinson Lane. By December 1841 the line had reached Chorley and Adlington station opened to take over from Rawlinson Bridge. The line would pass into the hands London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced, the station was served by Regional Railways until the Privatisation of British Rail. ==Facilities== The station has a staffed ticket office, open from start of service until 13:10 Mondays to Saturday. Outside these hours, tickets must be bought in advance or from the conductor on the train. A waiting room is available in the main building when the booking office is open and there are shelters on each platforms. Train running information is provided by timetable posters and telephone.
