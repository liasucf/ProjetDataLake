    "text": "The Romanian Social Party (, PSRO) is a centre-left political party in Romania. It was founded in March 2015 by a number of former Social Democratic (PSD) MPs led by Mircea Geoan\u0103, who had been excluded from the PSD earlier in the year. Geoan\u0103 and his supporters claim that the PSD under Victor Ponta \"deviated from its left-wing identity\" and supported a motion of no confidence launched by the opposition against the Ponta government in June 2015. ==References== Category:2015 establishments in Romania Category:Non-registered political parties in Romania Category:Political parties established in 2015 Category:Progressive parties Category:Social democratic parties in Romania ",
