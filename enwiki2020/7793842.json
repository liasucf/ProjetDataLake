    "text": "{| |} The Learjet 55 \"Longhorn\" is an American business jet manufactured by Learjet. ==Development and design== The Learjet 50 series was first announced at the 1977 Paris air show with larger cabins than the existing Learjets. The series was to have three variants, the Learjet 54, 55 and 56 but only the Learjet 55 was built. The Learjet 55 was a low-wing cantilever monoplane with NASA developed winglets, the winglets gave rise to the nickname Longhorn. The aircraft has a T-tail and is powered by two Garrett TFE731 turbofans mounted each side of the rear fuselage. It has a retractable tricycle landing gear and an enclosed cabin for up to ten passengers and a cockpit for the two crew. Construction of the Learjet 55 began in April 1978 after extensive testing and work on the wing design which came, initially, from the Learjet 25. The Learjet 55 first flew on 19 April 1979. The first production aircraft were produced starting 18 March 1981. 147 Learjet 55 aircraft were delivered. By 2018, a Learjet 55 can be had for $1 million or less. ==Variants== ;Learjet 54 :Proposed 11-seat variant, not built. ;Learjet 55 :Production variant, 126 built. ;Learjet 55B :1986 - Improved version with a glass cockpit, improved take-off performance and increased range, 8 built. ;Learjet 55C :1987 - New rear underfuselage design, delta fins to increase stability and reduced the landing speed. ;Learjet 55C/ER :Extended-range version of the Learjet 55C. ;Learjet 55C/LR :Long-range version of the Learjet 55C, fitted with an extra tank, carrying an extra of fuel in the tail cone. ;Learjet 56 :Proposed eight- seat version, not built. ==Operators== ; * Servicios A\u00e9reos Profesionales ==Specifications (Learjet 55)== ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * * ==External links== 55 Category:1970s United States business aircraft Category:Twinjets Category:T-tail aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1979 ",
