The square hole in the middle of cash coins served to allow for them to be strung together in strings, the term would later also be used on banknotes and served there as a superunit of w\u00e9n (\u6587). Prior to the Song dynasty strings of cash coins were called gu\u00e0n (\u8cab), su\u01d2 (\u7d22), or m\u00edn (\u7de1), while during the Ming and Qing dynasties they were called chu\u00e0n (\u4e32) or di\u00e0o (\u540a).Chinesecoins.lyq.dk Weights and units in Chinese coinage Section: \u201cGuan \u8cab, Suo \u7d22, Min \u7de1, Diao \u540a, Chuan \u4e32.\u201d by Lars Bo Christensen.

Because the strings were often accepted without being checked for damaged coins and coins of inferior quality and copper-allots these strings would eventually be accepted based on their nominal value rather than their weight, this system is comparable to that of a fiat currency. Because the counting and stringing together of cash coins was such a time consuming task people known as qi\u00e1np\u00f9 (\u9322\u92ea) would string cash coins together in strings of 100 coins of which ten wouldn form a single chu\u00e0n. The qi\u00e1np\u00f9 would receive payment for their services in the form of taking a few cash coins from every string they composed, because of this a chu\u00e0n was more likely to consist of 990 coins rather than 1000 coins and because the profession of qi\u00e1np\u00f9 had become a universally accepted practice these chu\u00e0ns were often still nominally valued at 1000 cash coins.Lloyd Eastman, Family, Fields, and Ancestors: Constancy and Change in China's Social and Economic History, 1550-1949, Oxford University Press (1988), 108-112.Village Life in China: A study in sociology door Arthur H. Smith, D.D. New York, Chicago, Toronto. Uitgever: Fleming H. Revell Company (Publishers of Evangelical Literature) Auteursrecht: 1899 door Fleming H. Revell Company The number of coins in a single string was locally determined as in one district a string could consist of 980 cash coins, while in another district this could only be 965 cash coins, these numbers were based on the local salaries of the qi\u00e1np\u00f9.Wang Y\u00fc-Ch\u2019\u00fcan, Early Chinese coinage, The American numismatic society, New York, 1951.Guttag\u2019s Foreign Currency and Exchange Guide (1921) Uitgegever: Guttag Bros. Numismatics New York, U.S.A. Accessed: 3 October 2017. During the Qing dynasty the qi\u00e1np\u00f9 would often search for older and rarer coins to sell these to coin collectors at a higher price. The number of cash coins which had to be strung together to form a string differed both from region to region as time period or by the materials used to manufacture the cash coins, for example under the reign of the T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c Emperor of the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty one string of cash coins included 600 zinc coins,Art-Hanoi CURRENCY TYPES AND THEIR FACE VALUES DURING THE T\u1ef0 \u0110\u1ee8C ERA.

In Vietnam a string of cash coins had the nominal value of 1 Mexican peso or 1 French Indochinese piastre.Dr. R. Allan Barker. (2004) The historical Cash Coins of Viet Nam. During the late 19th century in Qing China some currency systems were named after how many cash coins made up a string such as the Jingqian (\u4eac\u9322, \"metropolitan cash\") or Zhongqian (\u4e2d\u9322)\u201cSilver, Copper, Rice, and Debt: Monetary Policy and Office Selling in China during the Taiping Rebellion,\u201d in Money in Asia (1200\u20131900): Small Currencies in Social and Political Contexts, ed. by Jane Kate Leonard and Ulrich Theobald, Leiden: Brill, 2015, 343-395. which was an exchange rate that was used in the capital city of Beijing, the Jingqian system allowed a nominal debt of 2 w\u00e9n (\u6587) could be paid out using only one physical cash coins instead of two, in this system a string of Beijing cash coins (\u540a) required only 500 cash coins as opposed to the majority of China which used 1000 cash coins for a string (\u4e32). Meanwhile, in the Dongqian (\u6771\u9322, \"Eastern cash\") system, an exchange rate used for cash coins in the Fengtian province, only 160 cash coins were needed to make up a string. During the Qing dynasty period the term chu\u00e0n was used to designate long strings while the term di\u00e0o was used to design short strings. Although the term appeared frequently on banknotes the only cash coin to have ever had the currency unit \"String of cash coins\" as a part of its inscription was the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty era T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c B\u1ea3o Sao (\u55e3\u5fb7\u5bf6\u9214) 1 qu\u00e1n cash coin (\u6e96\u7576\u4e00\u8cab, chu\u1ea9n \u0111ang nh\u1ea5t qu\u00e1n), which was worth 600 v\u0103n (or 60 m\u1ea1ch).Fran\u00e7ois Thierry de Crussol, Catalogue des monnaies Vietnamiennes, Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, 1987. (in French) == Background == Much like how cash coins are counted in w\u00e9n (\u6587), until the Qin dynasty, China used cowry shells and bronze cowry shells which were denominated in b\u00e8i (\u8c9d) and a string of cowry shells was called a p\u00e9ng (\u670b). However, it is currently not known how much b\u00e8i was in a p\u00e9ng. == Strings of cash coin units during the Qing dynasty == During the Qing dynasty different number of cash coins were used to make up strings of cash coins. * 1 chu\u00e0n (\u4e32) = 1000 w\u00e9n (\u6587) * 1 metropolitan di\u00e0o (\u540a) = 1000 metropolitan cash (\u4eac\u9322) * 1 metropolitan di\u00e0o (\u540a) = 500 pieces of \"standard cash coins\" (\u5236\u9322, before 1853) * 1 metropolitan di\u00e0o (\u540a) = 50 pieces of \"big cash coins\" (\u5927\u9322, after 1861) In actual circulation, however, cash coins throughout Chinese history were put on strings in 10 groups of (supposedly) 100 coins each, these strings were separated by a knot between each group.Frank H. H. King - \"Money and Monetary Policy in China 1845-1895\". Published: 1965. Publisher: Harvard University. During the Qing dynasty period strings of cash coins rarely actually contained 1000 cash coins and usually had something like 950 or 980 or a similar quantity, these amounts were due to local preferences rather than being random in any form. In the larger cities cash shops would make specific strings of cash coins for specific markets. The cash shops existed because at the time there were many different kinds of cash coins circulating in China including old Chinese cash coins from previous dynasties (\u53e4\u9322), Korean cash coins, Japanese cash coins (\u502d\u9322), Vietnamese cash coins, large and small genuine Qing dynasty cash coins, and different kinds of counterfeits, such as illegally private minted cash coins. Some of these strings would contain exclusively genuine Zhiqian, while other strings could contain between 30% and 50% of counterfeit and underweight cash coins. The actual number of cash coins on a string and the percentage of counterfeits in a string was generally known to everyone who resided in that town by the type of knots that were used. Each of these different kind of strings of cash coins fulfilled different functions. For example one string of cash coins was acceptable to be used in a local grain market while it would not be accepted at a meat market, while another type of string was able to be used in both markets while not to pay for taxes. The cash shops sorted all cash coins into very specific categories, then they would make up appropriate kinds of strings that were intended for use in specific markets or to pay for taxes to the government. == Banknotes == A banknote from the Republic of China of 1 chu\u00e0n w\u00e9n (\u4e32\u6587, or a string of cash coins) issued by the Da Sheng Chang in the year 1919. Hansatsu local banknote of 1 kanmon (\u8cab\u6587) issued during the Edo period in Japan from the British Museum. During the Song dynasty the first series of standard government Jiaozi notes were issued in 1024 with denominations like 1 gu\u00e0n (\u8cab, or 700 w\u00e9n), 1 m\u00edn (\u7de1, or 1000 w\u00e9n), up to 10 gu\u00e0n. In 1039 only banknotes of 5 gu\u00e0n and 10 gu\u00e0n were issued, and in 1068 a denomination of 1 gu\u00e0n was introduced which became forty percent of all circulating Jiaozi banknotes. The Huizi also continued to use these currency units. Between the years of 1161 and 1166 the government of the Song dynasty had produced 28,000,000 d\u00e0o (\u9053, equal to a gu\u00e0n or 1000 w\u00e9n) in Huizi notes. The exchange rate between Guanzi banknotes and copper cash coins was 1 gu\u00e0n for 770 w\u00e9n while huizi notes of the eighteenth production period were valued at 3 gu\u00e0n for 1 w\u00e9n.ResearchGate Study of the corrosion from the printing plates of `Guan Zi' by Raman spectroscopy by Jilong Shi, Tao Li, Min Feng, Zhenwei Mao, and Changsui Wang. Received 22 April 2005; Accepted 13 December 2005; Retrieved: 06 February 2018. During the last days of the Southern Song dynasty China was suffering from inflation to the poiint that the value of the Huizi had lowered so much that a gu\u00e0n was only accepted at between 300 and 400 cash coins, which caused people to start hoarding these coins and remove them from circulation which had a devastating effect on the economy. As the Mongols continued marching south the Chinese military required more money causing the government to print an excessive amount of Huizi banknotes. The gu\u00e0n currency unit would later also be used by the Jurchen Jin dynasty and the Mongol Yuan dynasty on their Jiaochao banknotes, though due to hyperinflation these currencies would not be able to be exchanged with any real cash coins and under Mongol rule non-paper forms of currency were abolished. From the early fourteenth century to the early sixteenth century in Japan banknotes which were known as \"saifu\" were used for transactions, payments, and the transfer of funds between remote regions. Most of these saifu banknotes had a value of 10 kanmon (10,000 mon, or 10 strings of 1000 copper coins), these notes also circulated among the general public. Under the Ming dynasty the Da-Ming Baochao would also continue using gu\u00e0n as a currency unit for its denominations. The 1 gu\u00e0n Da-Ming Baochao banknote was originally good for 1,000 copper-alloy cash coins and had a size of 36.4\u00d722 cm, thus made it the largest Chinese paper banknote ever produced. In the middle of its design was an image of a string of cash coins (\u9322\u8cab) to show what it was worth. At the bottom of the Da-Ming Baochao banknote was a text which explained that it was issued by the Zhongshusheng (\u4e2d\u66f8\u7701, \"Palace Secretariat\"), and that it was a valid type of currency used concurrently with copper-alloy cash coins, and that counterfeiters would face a penalty, and those who notified the authorities of counterfeiting would be highly rewarded. Despite originally circulating concurrently with cash coins the Da-Ming Baochao became a fiat currency and would later no longer be able to be exchanged for any actual cash coins. Privately produced banknotes of the Qing dynasty, as is usual for China, had a great variety of names designating them across the country with names being used such as Zhuangpiao (\u838a\u7968), Pingtie (\u6191\u5e16), Duitie (\u514c\u5e16), Shangtie (\u4e0a\u5e16), Hupingtie (\u58fa\u74f6\u5e16), or Qitie (\u671f\u5e16). The denominations used on them varied greatly with some reaching as high as 5 di\u00e0o (\u540a). During the early days of the Republic of China the currency units of chu\u00e0n w\u00e9n and di\u00e0o w\u00e9n were still being used on banknotes and zhuangpiao. The Hupeh Provincial Bank (\u6e56\u5317\u5b98\u9322\u5c40, Hubei Guan-Qianju), a provincial government-owned qianzhuang created by Zhang Zhidong, issued their own banknotes denominated both in taels and in chu\u00e0n (\u4e32), which were known as the Hubei Guanpiao (\u6e56\u5317\u5b98\u7968), until 1927. == Bamboo tallies == Some Chinese bamboo tallies, which circulated in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong from the 1870s until the 1940s,Charm.ru Bamboo tallies by Vladimir Belyaev with notes from Fran\u00e7ois Thierry and Sam Leung. Retrieved: 28 March 2018. used \"strings of cash coins\" as a currency unit, but also contained additional inscriptions stating that they would not be paid out in \"regular\" cash coins. For example, a bamboo tally with the text \"\u4e32\u9322\u58f9\u4edf\u6587\" (Chu\u00e0n qi\u00e1n y\u012bqi\u0101n w\u00e9n, \"a string of 1000 cash coins\") could contain the additional information that it if were to be redeemed that it would be paid out in Daqian (\u5927\u9322) of \"10 cash\" coins. This bamboo tally would then be paid out in a string of 100 Daqian of 10 w\u00e9n. Below their denominations many bamboo tallies had the Chinese characters xin hao (\u4fe1\u865f, \"warranty mark\") to indicate that the bamboo tally is trustworthy to be worth its stated (nominal) value. Another way to indicate what type of cash coins would be paid out is if the bamboo tally did or didn't contain the inscription 10 w\u00e9n (\u5341\u6587) below its top hole. It could then contain an inscription like \"\u4e32\u9322\u8cb3\u767e\u6587\" (Chu\u00e0n qi\u00e1n \u00e8rb\u01cei w\u00e9n, \"a string of 200 cash coins\") that would only have to be paid out in a string of 20 cash coins of 10 w\u00e9n rather than 200 cash coins of 1 w\u00e9n. The reason why the issuing authorities would do this has to do with the concept of \"token\" money that the Chinese employed at the time. As the Qing dynasty's government starting manufacturing Daqian since the Xianfeng period that contained high nominal values but had intrinsic values that were only slightly more valuable than the low denomination coinages, the issuer of the Bamboo tally would be able to make a profit off of this situation, this was because the bamboo tally in question would be valued more than the promised redeemed value. In general, bamboo tallies in the region were not always \"redeemed\" and would continue to circulate in their local areas as a type of alternative currency as long as the local populace would maintain their \"trust\" that the bamboo token had \"value\" or \"worth\". This situation translated into the profits of issuing the tally was kept by the issuing authority. And if the bamboo tally were to be redeemed the redeemer would receive a weight of bronze or brass much lower than the bamboo tally's nominal value. == Kan (weight unit) == The kan (Japanese \u8cab, alternatively kamme \u8cab\u76ee) as a Japanese unit of measurement is a bead weight for cultured pearls. kan equals one thousand monme or 3.75 kg. The modern kan was officially established in the Japanese Law of Weights & Measures of 1891. It is still used worldwide as a weight indicator for cultured pearls. == Contemporary Western commentaries on strings of cash coins == === Qing dynasty === William Sachtleben (right) with a Russian friend with enough strings of cash coins to pay for a meal at a restaurant in Ghulja in 1892. American bicyclist William Sachtleben visited the city of Ghulja in 1892 was preparing to cycle to Beijing but while preparing for his trip together with the Russian consul noted the difficulty in transporting strings of cash coins stating: Sachtleben noted how there were no money exchange banks in the Chinese interior, of the ability to use and exchange the cash coins Sachtleben noted: Eventually Sachtleben and the Russian consul managed to exchange the strings of cash coins for silver coins as they were easier to carry on their trip, but noted how the money that they had to carry was much heavier than their camera equipment.Thomas Gaskell Allen & William Lewis Sachtleben (1895) Across Asia on a Bicycle - The Journey of Two American Students from Constantinople to Peking - Wikimedia Commons.

British explorer Isabella Bird wrote of the annoyance that strings of cash coins caused to the Chinese she witnessed in her travels stating: === Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty (French Indochina) === During the colonial era in French Cochinchina Chinese sap\u00e8ques (known as l\u00fd) were exclusively used as casino tokens by gambling houses and weren't used for other purchases unless trade was being conducted with Qing China. The general conversion rate was 1000 l\u00fd = 1 l\u1ea1ng = 7.50 French francs. The sap\u00e8ques which circulated at the time of French Cochinchina were made from zinc and had a very distinctive square centre hole allowing for them to be strung into strings of 1000 zinc sap\u00e8ques or 600 copper-alloy sap\u00e8ques, these strings were known as qu\u00e1n ti\u1ec1n (\u8cab\u9322) in Vietnamese and as ligatures or chapalets in French. Each string is further subdivided into 10 ti\u1ec1n consisting of 60 sap\u00e8ques, these coins were valued in their quantity rather than in weight. These coins usually featured the reign or era title of the reigning Nguy\u1ec5n monarch and were extremely poorly manufactured with bad alloys causing the strings to often break with many sap\u00e8ques breaking resulting in considerable losses for their owners due to their brittleness. Charles Lemire described the heavy nature and difficult mobility of strings of sap\u00e8ques as \"a currency worthy of Lycurgus of Sparta\" and non numerantur, sed ponderantur (\"They are not counted but weighed\"). To the French zinc coinage also presented a huge in inconvenience since their colonisation of Cochinchina in 1859 as the exchange between French francs and zinc T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u00f4ng B\u1ea3o (\u55e3\u5fb7\u901a\u5bf6) v\u0103n meant that a large amount of zinc coins were exchanged for the French franc. Zinc cash coins often broke during transportation as the strings that kept them together would often snap the coins would fall on the ground and a great number of them would break into pieces, and these coins were also less resistant to oxidation causing them to corrode faster than other coinages. Prior to 1849 brass coins had become an extreme rarity and only circulated in the provinces surrounding the capital cities of Vietnam, but under T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c new regulations and (uniform) standards for copper cash coins were created to help promote their usage. Between 1868 and 1872 brass coins were only around 50% copper, and 50% zinc. Due to the natural scarcity of copper in Vietnam the country always lacked the resources to produce sufficient copper coinage for circulation.Art-Hanoi CURRENCY TYPES AND THEIR FACE VALUES DURING THE T\u1ef0 \u0110\u1ee8C ERA.
