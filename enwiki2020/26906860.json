It was revealed just hours later that Portsmouth had finally come out of administration. ==First-team squad== :Squad at end of season ===Left club during season=== ==Transfers== Portsmouth had stated that any contracts due to expire at the end of the 2009\u201310 season would not be renewed due to their financial problems, and that they hoped to sign a new squad on free transfers and sell their squad from last year. As it transpired, only five players were released on 19 May 2010; ten others were offered new contracts. ===In=== Since Portsmouth were under a transfer embargo, they were not allowed to buy players or sign free agents as they could not guarantee the PFA that the wages for the players could be paid. The embargo was later lifted. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Number ! Date ! Position ! Name ! Club ! Fee !
