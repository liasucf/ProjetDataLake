    "text": "A Possible Projection of the Future / Childhood's End is American musician Al Kooper's fifth album, recorded for and released by Columbia Records in 1972. Begun with a vague storyline that failed to survive beyond the two title tracks, the album was recorded in London, England at George Martin's AIR Studios with one outtake from New York City (You're A Woman). Six original tracks were surrounded by covers of Bob Dylan (\"The Man in Me\", which Kooper had originally produced), Smokey Robinson (\"Swept For You Baby\") and even Jimmy Cliff (\"Please Tell Me Why\"). The album cover showed Kooper as an eighty-year-old man, decrepit and clutching a Fender Jaguar guitar. ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Al Kooper; except where indicated # \"A Possible Projection of the Future\" \u2013 6:29 # \"The Man in Me\" (Bob Dylan) \u2013 3:42 # \"Fly On\" \u2013 3:15 # \"Please Tell Me Why\" (Guilly Bright, Jimmy Cliff) \u2013 4:40 # \"The Monkey Time\" (Curtis Mayfield) \u2013 3:20 # \"Let Your Love Shine\" \u2013 4:04 # \"Swept for You Baby\" (Smokey Robinson) \u2013 3:32 # \"Bended Knees (Please Don't Leave Me Now)\" \u2013 3:40 # \"Love Trap\" \u2013 4:04 # \"Childhood's End\" \u2013 3:33 ==Personnel== ===Musicians=== * Al Kooper \u2013 acoustic and electric pianos, organ, guitars, ARP, VCS3 and Moog synthesizers, Mellotron, tambourine, sitar, vocals * Harvey Brooks \u2013 electric bass tracks recorded in America * Herbie Flowers \u2013 electric bass tracks recorded in England * Barry Morgan \u2013 drums * Alan Parker \u2013 acoustic guitar * Claudia Lennear, Linda Lewis, Michael Gately and Robert John \u2013 backing vocals * Bobby West \u2013 electric bass (track 7) * Paul Humphrey \u2013 drums (track 7) * Bobbye Hall Porter \u2013 percussion on (track 7) * Clydie King, Venetta Fields, Oma Drake and Edna Wright \u2013 backing vocals on (track 7) * John Punter - spoken introduction (track 1) ===Technical=== * Al Kooper \u2013 producer * John Punter \u2013 engineer * Mark Levine \u2013 engineer * Ron Coro \u2013 design ==References== Category:1972 albums Category:Columbia Records albums Category:Al Kooper albums Category:Albums produced by Al Kooper Category:Albums recorded at Trident Studios ",
