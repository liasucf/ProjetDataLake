Located on the Longhai Railway, the station is one of the largest freight train stations in China. ==History== The station was established in 1953 as Zhengzhoudong railway station () when the freight yard of Zhengzhou railway station was separated from it. In 2011, since the high- speed railway station in Zhengzhou on the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen\u2013Hong Kong high-speed railway was named as Zhengzhoudong, this station was renamed to its current name to avoid ambiguity. ==References== Category:Railway stations in Henan Category:Railway stations in Zhengzhou Category:Stations on the Longhai Railway Category:Railway stations in China opened in 1953 ",
