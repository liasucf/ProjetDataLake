He is remembered for building churches in Liverpool, and as a founding benefactor of St Chad's College, Durham. == Early life and education == He was the second son of Robert Horsfall, and nephew of Thomas Horsfall, MP for Liverpool. The Horsfall family had a tradition of building churches: Douglas' grandfather, Charles, was a founder of St George's Church, Everton, and Charles' sons built Christ Church, Everton in his memory.Brown & de Figueiredo, Sarah & Peter (2008). Religion and Place: Liverpool's Historic Places of Worship. English Heritage. , p20 Douglas' father Robert had firm Anglo-Catholic convictions, and funded the building of the Church of St Margaret of Antioch, Liverpool, in 1868.Brown & de Figueiredo (2008), p21 He studied at Eton College (with William Johnson Cory as his tutor) in 1870-71, before entering his father's stockbroking firm. == Benefactions == === Churches === Like his father, Horsfall was a firm supporter of the Anglo-Catholic movement, and his benefactions reflected this aim. In 1883, Horsfall, with his mother, funded the building of the Church of St Agnes and St Pancras, Toxteth Park. It was designed by John Loughborough Pearson and described by Nikolaus Pevsner as \"by far the most beautiful Victorian church of Liverpool...an epitome of Late Victorian nobility in church design\". in 1975 it received the highest Grade I listing for historical significance. In 1900 he funded the building of St Faith's Church in Great Crosby. In 1913 he funded the building of the Church of St Paul, Liverpool, designed by Giles Gilbert Scott.Brown & de Figueiredo (2008), p22 It is Europe's largest brick-built church, and was used by Scott as a test bed for many ideas later used in Liverpool Cathedral. Horsfall was also a member of the original committee for the building of Liverpool Cathedral; though he did not make any donation to its building. === St Chad's College === In 1904, he became the major benefactor involved in the founding of St Chad's Hall at Durham University, to train Anglo-Catholic priests to serve in the Church of England. He retained this link and continued to give to the hall throughout his life, and was celebrated as \"Fundator Noster\" (our founder) in the college magazine (although in recent years the college has shared that title with Julia Warde-Aldam, benefactor of the predecessor institution St Chad's Hostel). In 1907, the University awarded Horsfall an honorary degree of Master of Arts in recognition of this support. The hall survives as St Chad's College, Durham, and Horsfall's portrait hangs over the high table in the dining hall. == Personal life == In 1887 he married Mabel, daughter of Egerton Parks Smith, and had two sons and two daughters, including Olympic and Oxford rower Major Ewart Horsfall M.C. == References == Category:1856 births Category:1936 deaths Category:St Chad's College, Durham Category:Businesspeople from Liverpool Category:People educated at Eton College Category:English Anglicans ",
