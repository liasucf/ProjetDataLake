The center is regarded as a public asset according to the Thai Ministry of Finance's Treasury Department. However, it has been managed by N.C.C. Management & Development Co., Ltd., a private firm, since its opening in 1991. The QSNCC was built to host events, especially conferences and exhibitions and has hosted numerous international events. The QSNCC is also home to the Plenary Hall, a theatre style hall, which has a capacity of 6,000 persons. ==History== In September 1987, Mr. Suthee Singhasaneh, the Minister of Finance, and Mr. Kamchorn Sathirakul, the Bank of Thailand Governor jointly signed a deal between the Royal Thai Government and the World Bank/International Monetary Fund (IMF) to host the 46th Annual Meeting of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank Group and IMF in Bangkok between 1 October to 15 October 1991. As a result, the QSNCC was constructed as a sign of Thailand's commitment to host this event. As for the architectural design, a leading Thai architectural firm was assigned to design a structure that reflected Thai culture and heritage for the QSNCC. To ensure that the center would be completed on time, a design-build delivery system was used and the construction started in late 1989. Construction began with 100 designers and more than 1000 construction workers. The bulk of construction was finished by June 1991, under budget and about two months before the scheduled date of August 1991. It was finished in only 16 months. Projects of this magnitude normally take 40 months. On 29 August 1991, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit officially opened the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center. The center was named after Queen Sirikit in honour of her 60th birthday. The convention center was closed for a 12 billion baht renovation on 26 April 2019 and is scheduled to reopen in May 2022 with three times the original venue space. ==Expo== * 1st ASEAN Seafood Expo & Conference * Miss Universe 1992 ==Gallery== Image:Bkksirikitconvcentr0905a.jpg|Queen Sirikit National Convention Center in 2010 Image:\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22\u0e01\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35 \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e43\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e18\u0e35\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e07\u0e32\u0e19 \"\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2a - Flickr - Abhisit Vejjajiva (14).jpg|In front of the Convention Center Image:\u0e19\u0e32\u0e22\u0e01\u0e23\u0e31\u0e10\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e35 \u0e40\u0e1b\u0e47\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e18\u0e32\u0e19\u0e01\u0e25\u0e48\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e14\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e38\u0e21\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e31\u0e0a\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e02\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e40 - Flickr - Abhisit Vejjajiva.jpg|Inside Convention Center ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Bangkok Category:Convention centers in Thailand Category:Tourist attractions in Bangkok Category:Khlong Toei District Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in Thailand ",
