Their original products were accordions that they initially imported from Germany and then Italy before opening their own facility in 1932. During the late 1950s, the company started making electric guitars and later amplifiers. The early guitars were heavily influenced by the accordion production and had a special look and feel. Hagstr\u00f6m were the first company to mass-produce 8 string bass guitars as well as the first to build a guitar/synthesizer hybrid (Swede Patch 2000). The company ceased production in 1983. In 2004 the brand was resurrected and is now in production in China. In 2008 Hagstr\u00f6m expanded their line of products and launched their own line of basses including a re-issue of their famous Hagstr\u00f6m H8, an 8 string bass. ==Accordions 1925 to 1970== Albin Hagstr\u00f6m began importing accordions from Germany and Italy in 1925 and founded \"Firma Albin Hagstr\u00f6m\". Albin expanded his business with shops in Sweden, Norway and Denmark and in 1932 he started manufacturing accordions himself in \u00c4lvdalen. In 1936, Hagstr\u00f6m hired two Italian accordion builders who helped to update and streamline the manufacturing process. In 1939 Hagstr\u00f6m started to establish themselves in USA by opening \"Hagstrom Music Company Inc.\" in Rockefeller Center in New York as well as \"Albin Hagstrom Inc.\" in Jamestown. However, in 1940 the launch was canceled due to World War II and the people hired to run the company disappeared with the company's funds. In 1946 Sven Hillring was sent over from Sweden to oversee a new launch of the new accordion factory in Jamestown, which was in business until 1949. Back in Sweden the brand continued to grow throughout the 1940s and 1950s and at one time had a total of forty-eight shops in northern Europe. In 1953 the accordion production reached its peak with 15,000 units being built. At this time the company also started a number of accordion schools; it is estimated that over 70,000 people have attended these schools. Founder Albin Hagstr\u00f6m died in 1952 at the age 47 and was succeeded by Erik Wis\u00e9n. In 1968 the Super Cromatic was introduced which came to be the last accordion built, with the last one made in 1970. In 1984 the company returned to its roots by once again importing accordions from Germany and Italy. The shops were sold, and employees were encouraged to venture out on their own, which resulted in two new companies in \u00c4lvdalen. Musitech was started by Hagstrom and sold to Rolf Lindhamn, who was the official Swedish retailer of Aria and Guild guitars. Per-\u00c5ke Olsson who participated in the development of the Super Swede founded Amtech which is producing PA systems and light rigs as well as computer equipment. The original \"AB Albin Hagstr\u00f6m\" company still exists to this day and still owns many of the facilities in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. === Hagstr\u00f6ms Accordions === * 1930s ** Excellent - The first accordions manufactured by Hagstr\u00f6m.. ** Granesso * 1940s ** 389-31 ** \"Granesso 70 ** Accordia Superior and Extra * 1950s ** Castello\" and Minor - Built in Italy. ** Skandia ** 773 and 813 ** Constellation, Marita and Rosella ** Master 4/5 ** Rigoletto I, II and III ** Rosita I and II ** Consul Maestro and Maestoso ** Constella II and Estrella ** Accordia Royal ** \"Diana\" Prod in \u00c4lvdalen ca 1955-1960. * 1960s ** Walter Special 40 - Named after Andrew Walter, well-known contemporary accordionist. ** Super Cromatic - The last accordion manufactured, widely considered to be one of the best accordions available. ==Guitars: 1958 to 1983== Kent II made in 1964 and a HIIN OT made in 1975 In 1958, Swedish-based Hagstr\u00f6m started manufacturing electric guitars, being one of the first to produce the instrument professionally outside of the United States. The early Hagstr\u00f6m Deluxe solid body guitars featured a distinctive sparkle and pearloid celluloid finish that was previously used on their line of accordions. Soon Hagstr\u00f6m expanded their line-up of guitars to include hollow bodies like the Viking and the Jimmy. In 1961 the first line of Hagstr\u00f6m basses was available to the public, this eventually came to include the groundbreaking 8 string bass. Models of electric guitar included the Hagstr\u00f6m 1, the H series (h II, h III, h II N), the Swede (Originally called The Hagstr\u00f6m LP, or Les Paul, due to the instrument's resemblance to the popular Les Paul manufactured by Gibson Guitars), the Super Swede, the Impala, the Corvette (called the Condor in the US), the Viking, the Swede Patch 2000 (one of the first synthesizer guitars) and the Jimmy (named for Jimmy D'Aquisto, a respected New York luthier brought in by Hagstr\u00f6m to design the guitar). Basses include The Swede Bass and the Hagstr\u00f6m H8 - the first ever mass-produced eight stringed bass guitar, which found fame when used by the likes of Noel Redding, Jimi Hendrix, Mike Rutherford, and others. Another innovation was the H-Expander Truss Rod, which gives the neck extra strength and allows it to be extra thin as well as allows the action to be set extra low. Beside their line of instruments Hagstr\u00f6m also produced amplifiers, speakers, effects units, guitar strings and mixing consoles, which were used by ABBA on their first world tour. A very small run of lap steels, banjos and mandolins were also built but are rare to come across. In 1962 Albin's son, Karl-Erik Hagstr\u00f6m returned from working five years in the US with establishing their Line O guitars. In 1967 he took over as CEO of the company. In their native Sweden, the company became well known not only for selling music hardware, but also for \"teach-yourself\" books and mail courses on electric guitar, bass, keyboards etc., learning tools that deliberately took in a rock and pop repertory, chord analysis and tuning apart from teaching how to read music. By recognizing the electric guitar as an instrument in its own right, and not just an amped-up version of the acoustic and by accepting the new repertory, Hagstr\u00f6m popularized the instrumental skills of the new music outside of the networks associated with rock clubs, and record shops, and at a time when rock music was barely ever being written about from a musical perspective. Production ended for Swedish-made Hagstr\u00f6ms in 1983 as the company were outpriced by other major guitar brands that had moved their stock production lines to Asia. Hagstr\u00f6m did make some Japanese prototypes; however, they were not pleased with the workmanship and would rather close down the company than cheapen the brand. The interest in the original Hagstr\u00f6m brand still has a cult following around the world and a Hagstr\u00f6m Festival takes place in \u00c4lvdalen, Sweden around the first week of June every year since 2006. ===Hagstr\u00f6m Guitars=== A vintage Hagstr\u00f6m leaning against a Hagstr\u00f6m amplifier combo * Standard, DeLuxe and DeLuxe A, 1958\u20131962 - Sold in America under the name Goya (not to be confused with Goya guitars, acoustic guitars by Levin).

They are marketing new versions of a great number of the more famous models from Sweden. The official Hagstr\u00f6m design team have taken certain liberties with the designs and made some improvements and other deviations from the original Swedish designs. Hagstr\u00f6m has again started the production of more exclusive Hagstrom guitars within Europe, which have been specially developed to reproduce the sounds of the originals. These models are called the Northen Series. ===Current Hagstr\u00f6m Guitars=== * Deluxe D2H and Deluxe-F D2F. The Deluxe models come with two humbuckers and are single cutaway guitars. They have simple wiring with two potentiometers for master volume and tone control. These models were some of the first made when manufacturing resumed in 2004; however, they are no longer in production.

Pat Smear is known for having one of the largest Hagstr\u00f6m collections in America and reportedly claimed that Hagstr\u00f6ms are the most roadworthy guitars he's ever used. The world's largest collection of Hagstr\u00f6m guitars was previously owned by Arne Johansson in \u00d6stersund, Sweden and consisted of more than 80 Hagstr\u00f6m guitars plus a number amplifiers and other instruments and Hagstr\u00f6m products. The entire collection was bought by the publicly owned museum of the Dalarna province, that owned a smaller collection of instruments, on 4 May 2012. Their collection now consists of more than 100 Hagstr\u00f6m guitars. The red Viking II that Elvis Presley used on Elvis Presley's '68 Comeback Special was sold in the early nineties for more than $50,000 and was on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. A 1981 Super Swede with custom blue and yellow graphics was sold for 60,100 Swedish kronor (approx. $8,850 USD), making it one of the most expensive Hagstr\u00f6ms ever sold. The Guitar Collection features a rare Hagstr\u00f6m Futurama Coronado automatic. ==Notable users== * Elvis Presley - 68 Comeback Special * Elias Bender R\u00f8nnenfelt - Iceage * Kurt Cobain - Nirvana * David Bowie - Rebel Rebel music video, and in various bands. * Pat Smear - Nirvana, Foo Fighters, and the Germs * Aaron North - The Icarus Line, Nine Inch Nails and Jubilee (band) * Noel Redding - The Jimi Hendrix Experience * Joe Walsh - Eagles, James Gang, Barnstorm * Rutger Gunnarsson - ABBA, played and designed the Hagstr\u00f6m Super Swede Bass * Stu Mackenzie - King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard * Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus - ABBA * Frank Zappa - The Mothers of Invention and Captain Beefheart * Dweezil Zappa- Zappa Plays Zappa * Bob Hardy - Franz Ferdinand * Nick McCarthy - Franz Ferdinand * Jimi Hendrix - The Jimi Hendrix Experience * Luis Alberto Spinetta * Ryan Ross - Panic! at the Disco and The Young Veins * Josh Homme - Kyuss, Queens of the Stone Age and Them Crooked Vultures * Frances McKee - The Vaselines * Kevin Parker - Tame Impala * Daryl Stuermer - Jean-Luc Ponty * Doc Forrester - Archie Bell & the Drells- and many more ==Media== * Hagstr\u00f6m - Allt i musik.
