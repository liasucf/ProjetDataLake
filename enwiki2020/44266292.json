She completed secondary school in Europe and moved to Dakar in Senegal. She earned a diploma in library science at Cheikh Anta Diop University and worked for several years as a librarian. In 1961, she married the film director Paulin Soumanou Vieyra. Several of her poems were published in the literary magazine Pr\u00e9sence Africaine in 1976.
