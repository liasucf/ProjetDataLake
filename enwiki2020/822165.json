    "text": "InterSystems Cach\u00e9 is a commercial operational database management system from InterSystems, used to develop software applications for healthcare management, banking and financial services, government, and other sectors. Customer software can use the database with object and SQL code. Cach\u00e9 also allows developers to directly manipulate its underlying data structures: hierarchical arrays known as M technology. ==Description== Internally, Cach\u00e9 stores data in multidimensional arrays capable of carrying hierarchically structured data. These are the same \u201cglobal\u201d data structures used by the MUMPS programming language, which influenced the design of Cach\u00e9, and are similar to those used by MultiValue (also known as PICK) systems. In most applications, however, object and/or SQL access methods are used. Cach\u00e9 ObjectScript, Cach\u00e9 Basic or T-SQL can be used to develop application business logic. External interfaces include native object binding for C++, Java, EJB, ActiveX, and .NET. Cach\u00e9 supports JDBC and ODBC for relational access. XML and web services are also supported. Cach\u00e9 Server Pages (CSP) technology allows tag-based creation of web applications that generate dynamic web pages, typically using data from a Cach\u00e9 database. Cach\u00e9 also includes InterSystems Zen, an implementation of AJAX that enables component-based development of rich web applications. ==History== InterSystems was founded in 1979 to commercialize MUMPS hierarchical databases. It launched Cach\u00e9 in 1997 as its flagship product and at that time ceased further development of its original MUMPS product line. ==Market== InterSystems claims Cach\u00e9 is the world's fastest object database. However, high performance is achieved only for transactional operations that have a significantly hierarchical nature. This database management system (DBMS) is used as part of hospital patient tracking, electronic medical record and medicine management systems, in products developed by companies such as Epic Systems as well as the VistA system used by the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. Sungard includes Cach\u00e9 in the AddVantage asset management software to finance industry customers such as banks. Telecommunications vendors BT Group and Vodacom also use Cach\u00e9.Interystems case study: Vodacom. http://www.intersystems.fr/page/fr/case_study_vodacom The DB-Engines website has ranked Cach\u00e9 as the most popular object-oriented DBMS every month since March 2013. ==Platforms== Cach\u00e9 runs on Windows, Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX, macOS and OpenVMS platforms. ==See also== GT.M, a related database system ==References== ==External links== *InterSystems Cach\u00e9 *InterSystems Developer Community Category:Relational database management systems Category:Object- oriented database management systems Category:Proprietary database management systems Category:MUMPS implementations ",
