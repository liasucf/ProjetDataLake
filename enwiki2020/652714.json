Blackhawk is known for its uniform McMansion architecture and suburban lifestyle, with the median household income being $167,875 and median home price of $1,117,500. ==Blackhawk Ranch, 1917 to 1979== Blackhawk Ranch was established in 1917 by Ansel Mills Easton and his son-in-law William Q. Ward, in an area east of the San Ramon and Sycamore Valleys. The name came from a famous Irish racehorse named Blackhawk that Easton's family had once owned. The land passed through the hands of several owners, including Raymond Force (the owner of the Caterpillar Tractor Company), the Hawaii-based sugar and pineapple company Castle & Cooke and Howard Peterson (owner of Peterson Tractor). In 1975, Peterson sold the land to Florida developer Ken Behring, who planned a housing development of 4800 dwelling units over 4200 acres (17 km) of land. Critics charged that the plan would have various negative impacts, related to urban sprawl, environmental damage and violations of the County General Plan. A group of environmentalists and local residents called Amigos de Diablo organized against the Blackhawk Development Corporation, but were sued for libel. The Blackhawk Development Corporation finally reduced the number of homes planned to 2400 and offered more than 2000 acres (8 km) of open space to Mount Diablo State Park. ==Communities== Blackhawk is divided into seven individual gated communities scattered along Blackhawk Road, connected by a long jogging trail. * Hidden Oaks consists of 206 homes and in 1978 was the first Blackhawk community to be completed. Most homes are on half-acre lots. * Oakridge consists of medium-sized homes ranging from 2000 to , though a few large estates reside on the top of a private court. * Saddleback, the second community completed, is home to some of the most lavish homes in the entire Blackhawk development, most lots being no less than in size. * Silveroak is an upscale condo complex. * Silver Maple is designed around one of the main Blackhawk Country Clubs's golf holes, though no roads connect it to the rest of the main Blackhawk Country Club.
