He served during the Second World War, from 1941 to 1945, as a sapper in the Royal Australian Engineers. For most of his career, he worked as a painter, although he maintained an avid interest in ornithology throughout his life. ==Ornithology== Many of Jack's ornithological findings were published in the journal Queensland Bird Notes. His first contribution to the ornithological journal Emu was about the territorial and nesting behaviour of the rufous whistler.Arnold McGill (1985) \"Obituary: Noel Morrison Jack.\" Emu, 85(2): p. 134, doi: 10.1071/MU9850134N.
