Juan Morelos=== * He was the first builder of the first church and the convent. ===Fr. Gregorio Giner=== * He built the new parish church with stronger materials in 1758. It was finished in 1773. ===Fr. Joaquin Calvo=== * He completed the facade in 1802 and was also responsible for the construction of the slender tower. ===Fr. Ignacio Manzanares=== * He restored the convent which was also damaged by the 1863 earthquake. ==Architectural features== Santa Monica de Angat Parish Church was designed in Baroque architectural style. This could be verified with the existence of 18 adobe posts, along with eight windows. Windows, statued niches, and spaces between horizontal string courses, dividing the front facade into three parts, were ornamented with floral carvings. Also, foliated crestings on the raking course of the pediment were used as an added ornamentation. ===Ceiling art paintings=== The ceiling paintings within the interiors of the parish church resemble the ceiling paintings of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican, Rome. History of Christianity in the Philippines and culture of Angat, Bulacan such as simbang gabi, Flores de Mayo, prusisyon ng Santissimo Sakramento, and fiesta were also incorporated within the ceiling paintings. The ceiling paintings were started by G. Rene Robles in 1998 and finished by G. Jess Robles in 2002, in accordance with the order of Fr. Memeng. ==Present condition== Several interventions were conducted under the administration of Rev. Msgr.
