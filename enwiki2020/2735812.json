    "text": "The Cherokee calendar is based upon a lunar year and defined by 13 cycles of moon phases. Each cycle was accompanied by a ceremony. In order to rectify the Cherokee calendar with that of the Julian calendar, these cycles were reduced to 12. The seasonal round of ceremonies was integral to Cherokee society. It was considered an important spiritual element for social cohesion and a way to bring all the Cherokee clans together. The Cherokee, like many other Native tribes, used a turtle\u2019s back pattern of scales to determine their calendar cycle. The scales around the edge added up to 28, the same number of days as in a lunar cycle, while the center contained 13 larger scales, representing the 13 moon cycles of a year. Turtle shell calendar ==Thirteen seasonal moon ceremonies== Cherokee priests, known as \u13a0\u13c2\u13ab\u13d4\u13c2 or A-ni-ku-ta-ni, defined the 13 ceremonies as listed below.
