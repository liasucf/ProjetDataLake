Vend\u00e9miaire is stationed in the French Pacific territories for patrol duties. ==Design and description== The s were designed in response to a demand for a cheap warship capable of operating in low threat areas and able to perform general patrol functions. As a result, the Flor\u00e9al class were constructed to mercantile standards in the areas of ammunition stowage, helicopter facilities and damage control, which significantly lowered the cost of the vessels. The Flor\u00e9al class were designed for using modular construction which shortened their building times. Vend\u00e9miaire has a standard displacement of and at full load. The frigate measures long between perpendiculars and overall with a beam of and a draught of . Due to the frigate's broad beam, the ship is equipped with fin stabilisers. The frigate is powered by a combined diesel and diesel (CODAD) system comprising four SEMT Pielstick 6 PA6 L280 BPC diesel engines driving two shafts each turning a LIPS controllable pitch propeller. The CODAD system is rated at The vessel is also equipped with one bow thruster. Due to the mercantile construction design, the four diesels are all located within one machinery room for ease of maintenance. Both diesel fuel and TR5 aviation fuel is brought aboard at a single location at the stern compared to naval-constructed vessels which sport two. The ship also has three diesel-electric generators located just fore and aft of the machinery room. Vend\u00e9miaire has a maximum speed of and a range of at .

The frigate was built using modular construction methods which reduced the vessel's construction time. Vend\u00e9miaire was launched on 23 August 1992 and commissioned into the French Navy on 21 October 1993.Gardiner, Chumbley & Budzbon have the ship launched on 29 August and commissioned on 20 October.
