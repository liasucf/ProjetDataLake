He displayed an early talent for art and left the family's millinery business to paint in the countryside. There, he was noticed by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Montenard, the noted Proven\u00e7al painter, who was impressed with his work and encouraged him to study in Paris.Brief biography @ the City of Toulon website. Squadron in Toulon Harbor, Mistral Effect (1895) In 1887, he enrolled at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian, where he studied with Tony Robert-Fleury. Two years later he won first prize at the Academy's exhibition and displayed his work at the Salon des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais. In 1890, his canvas \"La rade de Toulon : effet de mistral\" (The Harbor at Toulon, Mistral effect) was purchased by the French government and his career was launched. Over the next ten years, he was invited to participate in several international exhibitions, including the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The details of his life at this time are sketchy, but he appears to have divided his time between Toulon and his studios in Paris on Montmartre where he met with colleagues from the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. He was especially supportive of foreign artists studying in France, such as Emanuel Phillips Fox, E. Irving Couse and . In 1891, upon the recommendation of Montenard, he accepted the well-known Brazilian painter Giovanni Battista Castagneto as a student, showing him how to brighten his palette and paint maritime subjects. ===Final years=== The Port of Toulon (date unknown) He married in 1899, but soon experienced a series of misfortunes. Both his parents died and he lost his first child in the same year. In 1907, his daughter died from scarlet fever, at age five. In 1909, he suffered an attack of hemiplegia which restricted his ability to paint, especially outside of his studio. President Jean Jaur\u00e8s paid a visit during a campaign tour to offer his sympathy. Retiring to Toulon, he lost all interest in his old associates, exhibitions and honors of any sort, although he continued to paint and give art lessons to a few selected students. He returned to Paris only once, in 1931, at the urging of his friends, to participate in a show at the Salon des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais. But, by then, he was virtually forgotten. Five years later, he died in his studio. An elementary school in Toulon has been named after him.Ecole \u00e9lemetaire Fran\u00e7ois Nardi website ==References== == Further reading == * Jean-Baptiste Nardi and Brigitte Gaillard, Fran\u00e7ois Nardi et les paysagistes proven\u00e7aux: entre tradition et modernit\u00e9, Ville de Toulon, 2011 * Raymond Nardi, \"Fran\u00e7ois Fabi\u00e9 et Fran\u00e7ois Nardi\", in Bulletin des Amis de la Vieille Valette, #3, Winter 1980. * _______ \"Fran\u00e7ois Nardi, peintre des eaux profondes\", in Revue Marseille, #119, Fourth Quarter 1979. * _______ \"Fran\u00e7ois Nardi et son \u00e9poque\", in Bulletin des Amis du Vieux Toulon et de sa R\u00e9gion 1977. == External links == * Arcadja Auctions: more works by Nardi Category:1861 births Category:1936 deaths Category:19th-century French painters Category:20th- century French painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:French male painters Category:French marine artists Category:French people of Italian descent Category:People from Toulon ",
