It is run at Epsom over a distance of 5 furlongs (1,006 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in early June. The Epsom five furlongs course, which is downhill until the last 100 yards, is reputed to be the fastest of its kind in the world. The current world record for five furlongs, 53.69 seconds, was set by Stone of Folca in this race in 2012. The race was known as the Night Rider Handicap until 1993. As of 2019 it is sponsored by Investec and run as the Investec Dash Handicap. ==Winners since 1988== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border- collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! style=\"width:36px\" | Year ! style=\"width:160px\" | Winner ! style=\"width:30px\" | Age ! style=\"width:40px\" | Weight ! style=\"width:180px\" | Jockey ! style=\"width:180px\" | Trainer ! style=\"width:60px\" | Time |- | 1988 | Durham Place | 6 | 07-12 | Willie Carson | Kim Brassey | 0:55.59 |- | 1989 | Gallant Hope | 7 | 07-10 | Bill Shoemaker | Gerald Cottrell | 0:54.89 |- | 1990 | Miami Banker | 4 | 09-10 | Michael Roberts | P J Arthur | 0:56.22 |- | 1991 | Mertola's Pet | 5 | 07-07 | Nicky Carlisle | Gerald Cottrell | 0:54.28 |- | 1992 | Viceroy | 5 | 09-01 | Ray Cochrane | Ben Beasley | 0:55.68 |- | 1993 | El Yasaf | 5 | 10-01 | Darryll Holland | T J Naughton | 0:56.00 |- | 1994 | Mistertopogigo | 4 | 08-05 | Alan Munro | Ben Beasley | 0:54.79 |- | 1995 | Double Quick | 3 | 07-08 | Jason Weaver | Mark Johnston | 0:53.86 |- | 1996 | To The Roof | 4 | 08-03 | Gary Hind | Peter Harris | 0:54.21 |- | 1997 | Ya Malak | 6 | 09-02 | Alex Greaves | David Nicholls | 0:55.17 |- | 1998 | Bishops Court | 4 | 09-02 | Jimmy Fortune | Lynda Ramsden | 0:55.17 |- | 1999 | To The Roof | 7 | 09-01 | Jimmy Fortune | Peter Harris | 0:55.66 |- | 2000 | Astonished | 4 | 09-02 | Kieren Fallon | John Hammond | 0:55.59 |- | 2001 | Bishops Court | 7 | 09-04 | Robert Winston | Lynda Ramsden | 0:54.67 |- | 2002 | Rudi's Pet | 8 | 08-07 | Adrian Nicholls | David Nicholls | 0:56.68 |- | 2003 | Atlantic Viking | 8 | 08-07 | Seb Sanders | David Nicholls | 0:54.29 |- | 2004 | Caribbean Coral | 5 | 09-05 | Robert Winston | John Quinn | 0:54.86 |- | 2005 | Fire Up The Band | 6 | 09-09 | Richard Hughes | David Nicholls | 0:56.05 |- | 2006 | Desert Lord | 6 | 08-08 | Darragh O'Donohoe | Kevin Ryan | 0:54.49 |- | 2007 | Hogmaneigh | 4 | 09-04 | Saleem Golam | S C Williams | 0:55:16 |- | 2008 | Holbeck Ghyll | 6 | 08-07 | William Buick | Andrew Balding | 0:55.33 |- | 2009 | Indian Trail | 9 | 08-02 | P M Quinn | David Nicholls | 0:56.67 |- | 2010 | Bertoliver | 6 | 08-06 | Jack Mitchell | S C Williams | 0:54.22 |- | 2011 | Captain Dunne | 6 | 09-10 | David Allan | Tim Easterby | 0:54.30 |- | 2012 | Stone Of Folca | 4 | 08-12 | Luke Morris | John Best | 0:53.69 |- | 2013 | Duke Of Firenze | 4 | 09-00 | Ryan Moore | Michael Stoute | 0:55.22 |- | 2014 | Caspian Prince | 5 | 09-00 | Adam Kirby | A W Carroll | 0:54.75 |- | 2015 | Desert Law | 7 | 08-05 | Martin Lane | P T Midgley | 0:54.65 |- | 2016 | Caspian Prince | 7 | 09-10 | Robert Winston | Dean Ivory | 0:55.99 |- | 2017 | Caspian Prince | 8 | 09-08 | Tom Eaves | Tony Coyle | 0:54.92 |- | 2018 | Tanasoq | 5 | 08-00 | Paul Midgley | James Sullivan | 0:54.96 |- | 2019 | Ornate | 6 | 08-13 | Phil Dennis | David Griffiths | 0:54.00 |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" | data-sort-value=\"2020\" | | no race 2020 || || || || || | |} == See also == *Horse racing in Great Britain *List of British flat horse races ==References== * Paris-Turf: ** *Racing Post: **, , , , , , , , , **, , , , , , , , , **, , , , , , , , , **, Category:Flat races in Great Britain Category:Epsom Downs Racecourse Category:Open sprint category horse races ",
