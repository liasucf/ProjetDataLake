Wii, PlayStation 2, and PSP versions of the game were developed by Leamington Spa-based game developer SLAM Productions. A Nintendo DS version was also released. ==Gameplay== The object of the game is to get rid of all the fruit by spinning the puzzle frame in order to combine matching fruit into formations or 3 or more before the time runs out. ==Release== It was released for Wii in Australia on 7 December 2006, in the UK on 8 December 2006, and in the US it was released on the Nintendo DS on 15 November 2007. It was released for PSP in Europe as Super Fruit Fall Deluxe Edition on 7 July 2007. Super Fruit Fall was one of two Nintendo Wii launch titles developed by a UK developer. ==Reception== The Official Nintendo Magazine, praised the game for the addictiveness throughout the game, but criticized the fact that flicking the Remote and Nunchuk to move the grid feels very pointless, and even stated that while it was addictive, it also didn't have enough value for money, as the game could be downloaded on PC for half the price. ==References== Category:Puzzle video games Category:2006 video games Category:Nintendo DS games Category:Wii games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ",
