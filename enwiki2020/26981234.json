    "text": "The Academy of St Nicholas, more commonly known as ESLA, is a Christian Academy, joint Catholic and Church of England located in Garston, Liverpool. The school was coeducational from years 7 to 11 including sixth form (All Saints Sixth Form College) ages 16-19. The Academy opened inside of a school building costing \u00a323.4m in February 2013. It is a mixed-faith Academy that caters for students of all faiths and none. == Ofsted Reports == An Ofsted inspection in October 2012 found that ESLA \u201crequired improvement\u201d, they then went into special measures in October 2014. The school received \u00a31.2 million emergency funding in 2012 and in 2013/2014 - only \u00a3131,00 of which needs to be repaid. In 2014 Parklands High School in Liverpool closed down and ESLA agreed to take some of the students in, while their Ofsted report was Inadequate. In 2016, a number of sponsors of ESLA pulled away from the school including their main sponsor 'Enterprise' losing rights to the word in their school name. Since this time, ESLA/The Academy has risen back to the previous \"requires improvement\" score in Ofsted reporting. == Branding == === Logo === The Academy logo is an abstract depiction of a purple dove (purple being the school's signature colour) with five wings; the five wings represent the academy's five sponsors: Amey PLC, Liverpool City Council, both the Diocese and the Archdiocese of Liverpool, The University of Liverpool. === Name Change === From 2 February 2017 Enterprise South Liverpool Academy changed to The Academy of St Nicholas, due to adding more students from The Academy of St Francis of Assisi creating All Saints Sixth Form College and the aforementioned sponsor pullout. This new name is intended to be another chapter for the school and hopefully a better one in the making. == References == == External links == * http://www.esla.org.uk/ * http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/new-sixth-form-college- open-12483563 * https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find- inspection-report/provider/ELS/136119 *http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- merseyside-26576320 *https://schoolsweek.co.uk/sponsors-step-away-from- troubled-liverpool-academy/ Category:Academies in Liverpool Category:Secondary schools in Liverpool Category:Catholic secondary schools in the Archdiocese of Liverpool Category:Church of England secondary schools in the Diocese of Liverpool ",
