Due to his good results, he was rewarded with a journey to Norway. From 1937 to 1941 he studied at the School of English Studies at of The Department of Letters and Philosophy, University of Bucharest. His major was English language and literature, while his minor was aesthetics and literary criticism. During the Second World War, he was an interpreter and translator for the Romanian military. After the war, he started teaching English, first at high school level, and then at the University of Bucharest, where he ultimately became a professor. He retired in 1980. Alone, and with Dan Du\u1e6descu, he translated Eminescu's poems into English. Together with fellow researcher Andrei Banta\u0219, Levi\u021bchi edited in 1991 what is so far the most comprehensive English-Romanian dictionary on paper, with over 70,000 entries. The two had also previously published a bilingual Romanian-English edition of Mihai Eminescu's poems, translated into English by themselves. He had two daughters. ==Works (selection)== * Dic\u021bionar rom\u00e2n-englez, Bucure\u0219ti, Ed. \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103, 1960, 1965, 1973 (\"Romanian-English dictionary\") * Gramatica limbii engleze, Bucure\u0219ti, Ed. \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103, 1967 (with Ioan Preda) (\"English grammar book\") * \u00cendrumar pentru traduc\u0103torii din limba englez\u0103 \u00een limba rom\u00e2n\u0103.
