    "text": "Paul M\u00e9fano, nov. 2009 Paul M\u00e9fano (March 6, 1937 \u2013 September 15, 2020), was a French composer and conductor. ==Biography== Paul M\u00e9fano was born in Basra, Iraq. He pursued musical studies at the \u00c9cole Normale de Musique de Paris, and then later at the Paris Conservatory (CNSMP), where he was a student of Andr\u00e9e Vaurabourg-Honegger, Darius Milhaud, and Georges Dandelot. He completed his studies in Basel at the courses taught by Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Henri Pousseur. He regularly attended the concerts of the Domaine Musical, as well as the seminars at Darmstadt, and enrolled in Olivier Messiaen\u2019s class at the CNSMP. Messiaen described M\u00e9fano as \"restless, intense, and always in search of radical solutions\" . In 1965 his music was performed publicly for the first time, at the Domaine Musical under the baton of Bruno Maderna. From 1966 to 1968 he lived in the United States, and then in 1969 he moved to Berlin at the invitation of the German Academy of Cultural Exchange (DAAD). In 1970 he returned to France, signed a contract with Salabert, and devoted himself to composition, to conducting, and to musical life in general. In 1972 he founded the Ensemble 2e2m, a group which he regularly conducted, and with which he has premi\u00e8red more than five hundred works by young composers and with which he has made more than forty recordings. Amongst those younger composers are St\u00e9phane de G\u00e9rando, Laurent Mettraux, Thierry Blondeau, Marc Andr\u00e9, Michael Finnissy, James Dillon, Bruce Mather, and Claude Lef\u00e8vre, but he has also championed older composers such as Jean Barraqu\u00e9, Brian Ferneyhough, Franco Donatoni, Luigi Nono, Aldo Clementi, Philippe Boesmans, Morton Feldman, Edison Denisov, and John Cage, as well as participating in the rediscovery of Charles Valentin Alkan and the Czech composers who were interred at Terezienstadt in 1940. He is the founder of the Editions du Mordant for the publication of contemporary music, and of the Editions Musicales Europ\u00e9ennes (dedicated primarily to young composers), and he has produced a number of notable radio series . In 1972 he was appointed director of the Conservatory of Champigny-sur-Marne, a duty which he performed until 1988. He also was professor of composition and orchestration at the Paris Conservatory until 2002. One of his conducting students was the Canadian composer Claude Vivier. From 1996 until 2005 he directed the Conservatory of Versailles. The most important works of Paul M\u00e9fano are published and accessible at Babelscores. In 2007, Paul M\u00e9fano became the director of the CLSI ensemble (Circle for the Liberation of Sounds & Images) with various musicians and composers like Gerard Pape, Jacqueline M\u00e9fano, Olga Krashenko, Lissa Meridan, Michael Kinney, Martin Phelps, Rodolphe Bourotte, Stefan Tiedje, Jean-Baptiste Favory. ==Musical style== M\u00e9fano\u2019s compositional style has evolved considerably from his early serial work Incidences (1960) down to recent compositions which make extensive use of microtones, such as Speed (2000). His early serial style is clearly under the influence of Boulez, but the ardour of his employment of these traits \u201cconfounds the crystalline, the mirror-like and with it all suggestion of musical geometry\u201d . He has an essentially poetic conception of music, reflected in a lifelong interest in poets and poetry . This is manifested especially in his treatment of instrumental color and in his vocal writing. He also has a special feeling for drama, as manifested in La c\u00e9r\u00e9monie. At the beginning of the 1970s he experimented with electronics (La messe des voleurs), and with its real-time combination with instruments. Though he has shown interest in the music of the spectralist composers, his own compositions are not at all similar, and today he is regarded as a \"post-spectralist\" composer . Many of his works explore and develop contemporary techniques for the flute, such as in Captive, Eventails, Gradiva, Traits suspendus, or Ensevelie. His earliest works (Trois chants cr\u00e9pusculaires) maintain links with tonality, to which he returned in Microm\u00e9gas. Since this work he has remained faithful to serial technique . ==Awards== He has been awarded the following prizes and honors: * 1971 \u2013 Prix Enesco de SACEM. * 1980 \u2013 Chevalier de l'Ordre du M\u00e9rite. * 1982 \u2013 Grand prix national de la Musique. * 1985 \u2013 Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres. * 1989 \u2013 Prix SACEM de la musique symphonique. ==Catalog of works== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" style=\"background:#ffffff\" align=\"top\" class=\"sortable wikitable\" |+ align=\"center\" style=\"background:DarkSlateBlue; color:white\" |Catalog of Works by Paul M\u00e9fano |- ! width=\"60 px\" style=\"background:Lavender; color:Black\"|Year ! style=\"background:Lavender; color:Black\"| Title ! width=\"200 px\" style=\"background:Lavender; color:Black\" |Type of work ! width=\"60 px\" style=\"background:Lavender; color:Black\"|Duration |- | 1956 || Evocations \u00e0 l'usage des jeunes filles, for piano || solo (piano) || 03:00 |- | 1957 || Croquis pour un adolescent. 6 pieces for piano || solo (piano)|| 00:15 |- | 1958 || Involutive, for clarinet || solo (clarinet) || 06:00 |- | 1958 || Trois Chants cr\u00e9pusculaires (Text by Paul M\u00e9fano) [I.
