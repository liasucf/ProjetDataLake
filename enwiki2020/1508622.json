Inspiration came both from successful symphonic power metal band Nightwish and from the myth of Atlantis. ==History== ===Eternal Endless Infinity and Line-up changes (2000\u20132004)=== Fascinated by the myth of Atlantis, Werner Fiedler, Thomas Caser, Christian Stani, and Chris Kamper decided in August 2000 to work out a concept inspired by the secret of Atlantis. Late in summer mezzo-soprano Nicole Bogner joined the project, and this was the birth of Visions of Atlantis. A first demo, Morning in Atlantis was released in 2000. In 2001 they signed with TTS Media Music/Black Arrow Productions, and in 2002 their first album, Eternal Endless Infinity was released. In 2003, the band saw some changes in line-up, replacing Christian Stani with Mario Plank and Chris Kamper with Miro Holly. ===Cast Away and Nicole's departure (2004\u20132005)=== Now with Napalm Records, which released the band\u2019s second studio effort \u201dCast Away\u201c worldwide in November 2004. To mark the release, Visions of Atlantis produced their first official music video to the track \u201cLost\u201c, which received significant airplay on VIVA and MTV, and made it possible for the band to present the album. In early 2005, Visions of Atlantis did their tour across Europe, while being supported by labelmates Elis and Celtic rock based band Lyriel. In late 2005, Bogner left the band due to commitments elsewhere. ===New singer and 3rd studio album (2005\u20132007)=== After Nicole left the band, she was replaced by American soprano singer Melissa Ferlaak (formerly with Aesma Daeva) and Wolfgang Koch replaced Werner Fiedler. In 2006, Martin Harb, who already played with VoA on their tour in Mexico in 2003, replaced Miro Holly. In May 2007, VoA released their 3rd album Trinity, mastered at Finnvox Studios and recorded at Bavarian Dreamscape Studio). The following autumn brought Visions of Atlantis to the United States, where the band toured together with Epica for 6 weeks and won numerous new fans. ===Departure of Melissa Ferlaak and Wolfgang Koch (2007\u20132008)=== Upon returning, the band went through changes in the line-up. On November 28, 2007, a message was posted on the official VoA website saying that Melissa Ferlaak and Wolfgang Koch had left the band, both citing personal reasons. Following this Visions of Atlantis announced a few days later that their ex guitarist, Werner Fiedler, had rejoined the band. ===Joanna Nieniewska and Maxi Nil (2008\u20132009)=== After Melissa's departure, Visions of Atlantis not only looked for a replacement for a singer, but also wrote the song material for the fourth album. The band was advertising on their website the position for a female vocalist for several months, and on September 3, 2008, they finally announced that they had found a new female singer; however, her identity wasn't revealed until February 1, 2009, as the 20-year-old Austrian soprano vocalist Joanna Nieniewska. On July 29, 2009, VoA announced that because of health problems, Joanna Nieniewska is no longer in the band but will continue to support VoA behind the scenes. The band announced the replacement vocalist, Maxi Nil from Greece, and was also known for her work with On Thorns I Lay, guest with Moonspell and her former band Elysion. ===Delta and \"Maria Magdalena\" EP (2010\u20132011)=== On December 3, 2010, VoA announced the new title of their 4th studio album Delta which was released on February 25, 2011 worldwide. On July 18, 2011, bass player Mario Lochert left the band due to crucial internal differences. In a recent interview Harb said that the band is not planning on replacing him. Instead, they will continue without a bassist as a fixed band member. In August 2011, the band announced the title of their first EP Maria Magdalena, it was released on October 21, 2011. ===Death of Nicole Bogner and Ethera (2012\u20132013)=== On January 6, 2012, Visions of Atlantis announced on their Facebook and MySpace pages that former singer Nicole Bogner had died at the age of 27 after suffering from a severe disease over a long period of time. The band said that they were saddened to have lost their first vocalist, and expressed their gratitude to Bogner for her time with the band.Thedeadrockstarsclub.com - accessed January 8, 2012 On January 27, 2012, the band announced the title Ethera for their upcoming album, which was scheduled to be released in 2012. Ethera was released on March 22, 2013. It was the first album with guitarist Christian Hermsd\u00f6rfer and with no official bassist. It was dedicated to Bogner's memory. ===Line-up changes and The Deep & The Dark (2013\u20132019)=== Visions of Atlantis - Wacken Open Air 2018 On December 6, 2013, Visions of Atlantis announced on their Facebook page that most of the line-up was parting ways with Visions of Atlantis, leaving the only remaining and founding member Thomas Caser on drums. This decision was mostly because of a desire from the parting members to play their own style of music, whilst the band was orientating to go back to its classic style. Thus, it welcomed back some of its old members: Werner Fiedler (guitars), Chris Kamper (synths), and Michael Koren (bass). Maxi Nil was replaced by Cl\u00e9mentine Delauney, and Mario Plank by Siegfried Samer. Michael Koren was replaced by Herbert Glos on bass in late 2017, and Werner Fiedler by Christian Douscha at the same time. Chris Kamper left the band in 2015. Their new album The Deep & The Dark was released on February 16, 2018. ===Wanderers (2019)=== After extensive tours with Serenity and Kamelot as well as several festival shows in 2018, the band released their first live album The Deep & The Dark Live @ Symphonic Metal Nights on February 16, 2019, which featured new male lead singer Michele Guaitoli (from Italian symphonic metal band Temperance) sharing lead vocal duty with Siegfried Samer, the former having permanently replaced the latter at the end of the Symphonic Metal Nights IV tour in late 2018. The band then announced on July 1, 2019 that their seventh album Wanderers will be released on August 30, 2019 via Napalm Records. The album will again feature Cl\u00e9mentine Delauney and Michele Guaitoli sharing lead vocal duties. ==Band members== ;Current members * Thomas Caser \u2013 drums * Cl\u00e9mentine Delauney \u2013 lead vocals * Michele Guaitoli \u2013 lead vocals * Christian Douscha - guitars * Herbert Glos - bass ;Previous members *Christian Stani \u2013 vocals *Nicole Bogner \u2013 vocals *Miro Holly \u2013 keyboards *Mario Plank \u2013 vocals *Melissa Ferlaak \u2013 vocals *Wolfgang Koch \u2013 guitars *Martin Harb \u2013 keyboards *Joanna Nieniewska \u2013 vocals *Maxi Nil \u2013 vocals *Mario Lochert \u2013 bass *Christian Hermsd\u00f6rfer \u2013 guitars *Werner Fiedler \u2013 guitars *Chris Kamper \u2013 keyboards *Michael Koren \u2013 bass * Siegfried Samer \u2013 lead vocals ;Live members *Raphael Saini \u2013 drums *Babis Nikou \u2013 bass, vocals ===Timeline=== == Discography == Studio albums *Eternal Endless Infinity (2002) *Cast Away (2004) *Trinity (2007) *Delta (2011) *Ethera (2013) *The Deep & The Dark (2018) *Wanderers (2019) EPs *Maria Magdalena (2011) *Old Routes \u2013 New Waters (2016) Demos *Morning in Atlantis (2000) Singles *\"Lost\" (2004) Videos *\"Lost\" (2004) *\"New Dawn\" (2011) *\"Winternight\" (2016) *\"The Silent Mutiny\" (2018) *\"The Deep & the Dark\" (2018) *\"The Last Home\" (2018) *\"A Journey to Remember\" (2019) *\"Nothing Lasts Forever\" (2019) Lyric Videos *\"Return to Lemuria\" (2017) *\"Words of War (Live)\" (2019) *\"Heroes of the Dawn\" (2019) *\"A Life of Our Own\" (2019) ==References== ==External links== *Visions of Atlantis on Facebook *Visions of Atlantis at Napalm Records *Column by Melissa Ferlaak at ME Metalhour Category:Austrian symphonic metal musical groups Category:Austrian power metal musical groups Category:Austrian heavy metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2000 Category:Napalm Records artists ",
