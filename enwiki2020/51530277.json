    "text": "The Norway\u2013Russia border barrier is an international border barrier built by Norway on the Norway\u2013Russia border. Construction of the barrier began in September 2016 and took a few months. The intent of the project was to prevent the smuggling and illegal crossing of migrants from the Middle East, mainly from Syria, who have used Russia as a route of entry into Norway (and thus into the European Union's passport-free Schengen Area). ==Background== In 2016, 5,500 asylum-seekers illegally entered Norway from Russia. Because it is illegal to drive from Russia to Norway without proper legal permission, and crossing on foot is prohibited, the migrants make the crossing on bicycles. At the end of September 2016, it was discovered that some foundations have to be moved, since the border treaty says that there shall be no built object within from the border on each side, and some foundations were built up to too close to the border.M\u00e5 flytte deler av omstridt gjerde p\u00e5 Storskog \u00e9n centimeter ==Barrier== The barrier is located at the Storskog border crossing. It is built of steel and stands long and high. The fence includes a gate for the road traffic, built so people cannot walk through it when it is closed. ==Juxtaposed border control== An agreement is in place that the Russian border control do not allow people to cross the border if they do not have proper visas into Norway. This means that they cannot apply for asylum since they never reach Norway. In doubtful cases, Norwegian border police are allowed to see the passports while the bearer has to wait in the Russian station.Storskog: Nye \u00absykkelasyls\u00f8kere\u00bb p\u00e5 vei? (Human Rights Service, 6 Oct 2016, In Norwegian) This is the background for the barrier, preventing people from escaping the station and running to Norway. ==Incidents== On 15 August 2017, a Syrian citizen ran through the Russian border control and tried to climb over the fence. Russian Border Guards stopped him.Syrer pr\u00f8vde \u00e5 klatre over piggtr\u00e5dgjerde inn til Norge In July 2017 two persons were arrested by Russian guards for trying to pass the border outside the station. ==Old barrier== The Norwegian-Russian border, seen from Skafferhullet, Norway, with a Norwegian fence. There exists an older barrier at the old border control site at Skafferhullet near the Pasvik river 4 km west of Storskog. It was probably built around 1960 when the road was used for construction of the Borisoglebsky hydroelectric station, and only accessible for authorised traffic. This border crossing was passable for general public before 1940 and again in 1965. Furthermore, there are fences around the Pasvik River hydroelectric stations, of which some are located on the border. These fences are not considered to be border fences, but private installation fences. ==Russian barrier== There is a fence along the entire Russian border to Norway and Finland, built by the Soviet Union. It is located one or a few kilometres from the border, and has automatic alarms detecting if someone climbs over it. There is a simple gravel road along both entire borders,https://maps.google.com permitted only for border guards and other authorised people, enabling quick response if an alarm goes off. ==See also== * Border barrier for a list of border barriers * Norway\u2013Russia border * Austrian border barrier * Bulgarian border barrier * Greek border barrier * Hungarian border barrier * Macedonian border barrier * Slovenian border barrier * Removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria * Russia\u2013Ukraine barrier ==References== Category:Border barriers constructed during the European migrant crisis Category:Norway\u2013Russia border Category:2016 in Norway Category:2016 in Russia Category:2016 establishments in Norway ",
