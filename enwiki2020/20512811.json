    "text": "{| |} The U-27 class was a class of eight submarines or U-boats built for and operated by the Austro-Hungarian Navy ( or ) during World War I. The class was based upon the German Type UB II design of the German Imperial Navy and was constructed under license in Austria-Hungary. After the Austro-Hungarian Navy had filled its most urgent needs for submarines after the outbreak of World War I, they selected the German Type UB II design for its next group of submarines in mid 1915. Orders for the first six boats were placed in October 1915 with the Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino and the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius. Two more boats were ordered in 1916, bringing the class total to eight. The boats were just over long and were armed with two bow torpedo tubes, a deck gun, and a machine gun. For propulsion they were equipped with twin diesel engines for surface running and twin electric motors for subsurface movement. Although the class was based on the German design, the Austro-Hungarian U-boats were heavier and slightly faster underwater, but less heavily armed than their German counterparts All eight boats were commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy between 1917 and 1918 and saw active service during the war. and were the most successful in terms of ships sunk and gross register tonnage sunk, respectively. Two boats sank only one ship each, and a third, , sank no ships. U-30 was also the only boat of the class to be lost during the war. The remaining seven were ceded to France and Italy as war reparations and six were scrapped by 1920; the seventh sank while being towed to Bizerta for scrapping. == Background == Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of World War I.Gardiner, p. 341. The Austro-Hungarian Navy satisfied its most urgent needs by purchasing five Type UB I submarines that comprised the from Germany,Gardiner, p. 343. by raising and recommissioning the sunken French submarine as , had been caught in an anti-submarine net while trying to enter the harbor at Pola on 20 December 1914. See: Gardiner, p. 343. and by building four submarines of the that were based on the 1911 Danish .The plans for the Danish s, three of which were built in Austria-Hungary, were seized from Whitehead & Co. in Fiume. See: Gardiner, pp. 344, 354. After these steps alleviated their most urgent needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915.Halpern, p. 383. The Germans were reluctant to allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary. The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen.Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted here (reprinted and translated into English by Sieche). Retrieved 1 December 2008. == Design == 75 mm deckgun, here on board k.u.k SM U-5 The U-27-class boats were coastal submarines that displaced surfaced and submerged. The boats had a single hull with saddle tanks,Gardiner, p. 181. and were long with a beam of and a draft of . For propulsion, they featured two shafts, twin diesel engines of for surface running, and twin electric motors of for submerged travel. The boats were capable of while surfaced and while submerged. Although there is no specific notation of a range for the U-27 class, the German UB II boats, upon which the class was based, had a range of over surfaced, and at submerged. The U-27 class boats were designed for a crew of 23\u201324. The U-27-class boats were armed with two bow torpedo tubes and carried a complement of four torpedoes. They were also equipped with a 75 mm/26 (3.0 in) deck gun and an machine gun. === Differences from the Type UB II submarines === Although the U-27 design was based on the German Type UB II submarine, there were some differences between the two designs.The U-27 class was also similar to the Austro- Hungarian Navy's s, which consisted of two former German UB II boats purchased in July 1917. The Austro-Hungarian boats were slightly heavier than their German counterparts, by only while surfaced, but by while submerged. The UB II boats were shorter by about in length, but nearly identical in beam and draft. Both types of submarines were rated at the same on the surface, but the Austro-Hungarian boats were reported as over faster underwater even though the electric motors of the two classes had comparable power output. The German boats were more typically more heavily armed than their Austro-Hungarian cousins, and featured two larger torpedo tubes\u2014 vs. \u2014and many sported a larger deck gun\u2014 vs. .Gardiner, pp. 181 (German specifications), 344 (Austro- Hungarian specifications). == Chased, the Austro-Hungarian Navy began the intricate political negotiations to assign the six boats\u2014to be designated U-27 to U-32\u2014between Austrian and Hungarian firms.The Austro-Hungarian Navy was forced to do the same Austrian/Hungarian allocations for builders and subcontractors for the four s. See: Halpern, p. 382. Of the initial order of six boats, two were allocated to the Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT) operating out of the Pola Navy Yard,By this time, the CNT shipyards at Monfalcone had been overrun by the Italian Army. See: Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted here (reprinted and translated into English by Sieche). Retrieved 1 December 2008. and the balance to the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius in Fiume. The Navy ordered the first six boats of the class on 12 October 1915.Miller, p. 20. The first six boats were all laid down between late 1915 and early 1916. Later in 1916, the seventh boat of the class, , was laid down, after having been presented to the Navy as a gift by the \u00d6sterreichischen Flottenverein, and an eighth, , as a replacement for , which had been lost in May. The seventh and eighth boats were constructed by CNT at the Pola Navy Yard. Shortages of labor and materials plagued subcontractors and, consequently, the delivery dates for the boats were not met. However, the first six boats had all entered service by the middle of 1917. The first of the class to be launched was on 19 October 1916, followed closely behind by three days later. The final boat launched was U-41 on 11 November 1917. The U-27 class boats were the last domestically built submarines completed for the Austro-Hungarian Navy. == Service career == All the boats of the U-27 class, the most numerous of all the Austro-Hungarian submarine classes, saw active service, and all but one boat had wartime successes;Helgason, Gu\u00f0mundur. \"Ships hit during WWI: Ships hit by KUK U27\", \"KUK U28\", \"KUK U29\", \"KUK U30\", \"KUK U31\", \"KUK U32\", \"KUK U40\", \"KUK U41\", U-Boat War in World War I.

At the other end of the spectrum, U-27, the lead boat of the class, sank the largest number of ships, 33, and sank the greatest amount of tonnage, . At the end of the war, U-27 and were surrenderedvghola, while U-28 and U-40 were surrendered at Venice. All four of these boats were ceded to Italy as war reparations and were scrapped by 1920. U-29, U-31, and U-41 were half of the six submarines at Cattaro,The other three submarines were , , and . See: Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 388\u201389 and were all awarded to France. The boats were towed from Cattaro to Bizerta, but U-29 foundered en route; U-31, U-41, and the others were scrapped within twelve months of their arrival there.Gibson and Prendergast, pp. 388\u201389. == Class members == === SM U-27 === U-27, the lead boat of the class, was built by the Austrian firm of Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT) at the Pola Navy Yard and launched on 19 October 1916.

The boat, under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Friedrich F\u00e4hndrich, sailed from Cattaro on 31 March 1917 and was never heard from again.Grant, p. 163. U-30 sank no ships during her brief career. === SM U-31 === U-31 was built by Danubius at Fiume and launched on 28 March 1917. She was commissioned on 24 April 1917.

During the war, U-40 sank two ships and damaged two others, hitting a total of Commonwealth shipping. The Italian destroyer Ardea claimed to have sunk U-40 in a depth charge attack on 26 April 1918,Gibson and Prendergast, p. 268. but the boat was surrendered to Italy at Venice in 1919 and broken up. === SM U-41 === U-41 was ordered as a replacement for which had been sunk in May 1916. She was built by CNT at the Pola Navy Yard and launched on 11 November 1917. During construction, U-41 was lengthened about to accommodate the diesel engines on hand that were to have been installed in U-6. U-41 was commissioned on 19 February 1918, the last boat of the class, and the last Austro-Hungarian boat completed and commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy.
