Nadia Naked received positive reviews. == Background== In 2016, Nakai released her first EP, titled BRAGGA, and signed a new record deal with Family Tree Records. Three years later, she explained that she wanted to create a personal album rather than repeating her earlier party songs. ==Artwork and title== The artwork used for the album was shot by Jiten Ramlal and designed by Jabu Nkosi. The album cover features Nakai nude. On May 3, 2019, Nakai revealed the title and the release date of the album on Twitter. Nakai has said that the title combines her name and the idea that her performances are so emotionally revealing that she seems \"naked\". ==Critical reception== Stone of Joints noted that the \"production and song arrangement is on point\". Michael Highly of Dope Off The Press observed that Nakai \"feels seasoned and much more confident throughout the album\". ==Track list== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Allmusic website. ===Performers and writers=== *Nadia Kandava - Lead vocals,Composer *Stefflon Don - Composer, Lead Vocals (track 17) *Cassper Nyovest - Composer, Lead Vocals (track 7,10) *Khuli Chana - Composer, Lead Vocals (track 8) *Kwesta - Composer, Lead vocals (track 15) *Lady Zamar - Vocals (track 9) *Y.
