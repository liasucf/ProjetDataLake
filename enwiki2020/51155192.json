On 4 May 2009, he became the Minister of Public Works and Transport in the eighth Ero\u011flu cabinet and held his ministerial position until May 2010. During his tenure, the Cyprus Turkish Airlines faced a growing economic crisis, but Ta\u00e7oy said that he lacked the complete power to fix the problem. He was a candidate for UBP leadership in the extraordinary congress on 5 December 2010, but lost to \u0130rsen K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck, garnering 212 out of 1414 votes and coming third after K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck and Ahmet Ka\u015fif.

Ta\u00e7oy was one of the chief supporters of the then UBP leader Dervi\u015f Ero\u011flu in his opposition of the Annan Plan for Cyprus. Ta\u00e7oy believes Turkish Cypriot society to be in moral corruption and believes that religion should play a more prominent role in public life, for which Turkey should take a proactive stance. He has stated that he wants a \"society that prays and fasts\". He advocates that Northern Cyprus should have no friction with \"motherland Turkey\", has praised the Justice and Development Party of Turkey and stated that Northern Cyprus should move to an executive presidency. == References == Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:University of Wisconsin-Madison alumni Category:Government ministers of Northern Cyprus Category:Members of the Assembly of the Republic (Northern Cyprus) Category:National Unity Party (Northern Cyprus) politicians Category:Democratic Party (Northern Cyprus) politicians Category:T\u00fcrk Maarif Koleji alumni ",
