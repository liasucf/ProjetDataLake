Its everyday name in the local northeast Queensland Dyirbal language was miyabur, though a more general word gurru\u014bun \"oak tree\" (also applied to Darlingia ferruginea and Cardwellia sublimis) was used in the taboo [Dyal\u014buy] vocabulary. They grow naturally through New Guinea and in Australia in central and northeastern Queensland, Cape York Peninsula and the Northern Territory, from about altitude. They are threatened by habitat loss. They have been recorded growing up to about tall. ==References== australasica Category:Proteales of Australia Category:Flora of Papua New Guinea Category:Vulnerable flora of Australia Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Flora of the Northern Territory Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
