The building was designed by Sir Thomas Jackson (1835\u20131924), who also designed the cricket pavilion in the University Parks. The designs for the building were prepared in 1876 and it was completed in 1882, in Clipsham stone.Jennifer Sherwood and Nikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England: Oxfordshire. Penguin Books, 1974, pages 264\u2013266. . The Examination Schools building is Grade II listed. During the First World War, the Examination Schools together with Somerville College and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the War Office to create the 3rd Southern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. The headquarters of the hospital were at the Examination Schools. The main purpose of the Schools is for the organisation and administration of the university examinations. Many of the final and other examinations for the University's students take place in the building, especially during Trinity Term. There is access to the building from both the High Street and Merton Street. Traditionally there have been parties in the street by students who have finished their exams, although the University tries to take measures to prevent this. At their height, traffic has been disrupted in the High Street. In Michaelmas Term, the Examination Schools are host to the university's Freshers' Fair. The building provides a major lecturing facility for the University and is also used as a meeting and conference venue outside term time. It is one of the largest buildings owned by the University. The Ruskin School of Drawing & Fine Art is located at 74 High Street to the east of the Examination Schools and University College is to the west. == References == == External links == * Examination Schools website Category:School buildings completed in 1882 Category:Educational institutions established in 1882 Category:Buildings and structures of the University of Oxford Category:Grade II listed buildings in Oxford *Examination Schools ",
