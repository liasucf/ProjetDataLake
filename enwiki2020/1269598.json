    "text": "At\u00e2-Malek Juvayni (1226-1283) (), in full, Ala al-Din Ata-ullah (), was a Persian historian who wrote an account of the Mongol Empire entitled Tar\u012bkh-i Jah\u0101n-gush\u0101 (History of the World Conqueror). He was born in , a city in Khorasan in eastern Persia. Both his grandfather and his father, Baha al-Din, had held the post of sahib-divan or Minister of Finance for Muhammad Jalal al- Din and \u00d6gedei Khan respectively. Baha al-Din also acted as deputy c. 1246 for his immediate superior, the emir Arghun, in which role he oversaw a large area including Kingdom of Georgia. Juvayni too became an important official of the empire. He visited the Mongol capital of Karakorum twice, beginning his history of the Mongols conquests on one such visit (c. 1252-53). He was with Ilkhan Hulagu in the 1256 campaign at the taking of Alamut and was responsible for saving part of its celebrated library. He had also accompanied Hulagu during the sack of Baghdad in 1258, and the next year was appointed governor of Baghdad, Lower Mesopotamia, and Khuzistan. Around 1282, Juvayni attended a Mongol quriltai, or assembly, held in the Ala-Taq pastures northeast of Lake Van. He died the following year in Mughan or Arran in Azerbaijan. 150 years after the castle of Alamut became the headquarters of the Nizaris, \u02bfA\u1e6d\u0101-Malik Juwayn\u012b, who was H\u016bl\u0101g\u016b Kh\u0101n\u2019s attendant and historian, visited the well-known Alamut library. He tells us about the plethora of Ismaili religious books and texts he found there, writing about the extensive literary production. However, when the Mongols invaded Alamut and destroyed the Ismaili capital, the library of Alamut was burned. Only copies of the Qur\u02be\u0101n and a few other treatises were saved. Juvayni's brother was the powerful Shams al-Din Mohammad Sahib-Divan, who had served as Minister of Finance under Hulagu and Abaqa Khan. A skillful leader in his own right, Shams al-Din also had influential in-laws: his wife Khoshak was the daughter of Avag Mkhargrdzeli, Lord High Constable of Georgia, and Gvantsa, a noblewoman who went on to become queen of Georgia. Juvayni's own position at court and his family connections made him privy to information unavailable to other historians. For unknown reasons Juvayni's history terminates in 1260, more than twenty years before his death. The standard edition of Juvayni's history is published under the title Tar\u012bkh-i Jah\u0101n-gush\u0101, ed. Mirza Muhammad Qazwini, 3 vol, Gibb Memorial Series 16 (Leiden and London, 1912\u201337). An English translation by John Andrew Boyle The History of the World-Conqueror was republished in 1997. ==References== ==Sources== * * * ==External links== *History of the World Conqueror by Ala Ad Din Ata Malik Juvaini, translated by John Andrew Boyle, Harvard University Press 1958, on the Internet Archive * Category:Iranian historians Category:13th-century historians Category:1226 births Category:1283 deaths Category:13th-century Iranian people Category:Juvayni family Category:Ilkhanate historians Category:Officials of the Ilkhanate ",
