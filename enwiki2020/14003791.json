    "text": "An American Presence Post (APP) is a very small diplomatic facility of the United States government located abroad. It is usually staffed by a single Foreign Service Officer who carries the title of Consul. An American Presence Post is roughly equivalent to a Consulate, but lacks a regular consular section, and does not issue visas. These matters are referred to the closest full scale Consulate, or the Embassy which has jurisdiction over the APP. It is not uncommon to hear an APP casually referred to as a Consulate or Virtual Consulate. == List of American Presence Posts == === American Presence Posts in Africa === * Egypt ** Alexandria === American Presence Posts in Europe === * France ** Bordeaux (opened 10/2000) ** Lille (opened 10/2000) ** Lyon (opened 12/1998) ** Rennes (opened 1/2000) ** Toulouse (opened 12/1999) * United Kingdom **Cardiff, Wales (Virtual) === American Presence Posts in South America === * Brazil **Belo Horizonte ** Porto Alegre ==References== ==See also== *Honorary consul .
