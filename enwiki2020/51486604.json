He spent the most part of his professional life in Buenos Aires and his last ten years in La Paz. == Biography == His parents were \"Dr. Gregorio Caba, a distinguished Bolivian doctor, and Adelina Balsalia, an Italian lady of high culture and with a fine musical spirit\".See Samuel J.A. Salas, Pedro I. Pauletto, Pedro J.S. Salas (1938). Historia de la M\u00fasica. Second volume: Am\u00e9rica Latina. Buenos Aires: Editorial Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Araujo, pages 61-64. According to Salas and Pauletto (1938), Eduardo Caba's mother was his first music teacher.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. In 1926, he moved to Buenos Aires and completed his higher studies in harmony.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. There he attended the classes of the Argentinean composer Felipe Boero. In 1927, he obtained a scholarship by the Bolivian government allowing him to improve his skills in Madrid where he was the alumnus of Joaqu\u00edn Turina and of P\u00e9rez Casas.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit.See biografiasyvidas.com. However, the Bolivian government withdrew its commitment and Caba was forced to give up his studies.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. Shortly later, Caba returned to Buenos Aires and integrated into Argentinean society, where he made good friends.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. His reputation grew, and his works were played at the Teatro Col\u00f3n.Article by El\u00edas Blanco Mamani, elias-blanco.blogspot. In 1942, Caba moved from Buenos Aires to his home country after being appointed director of the National Conservatory of Music of La Paz.Article by Alfredo Sol\u00edz B\u00e9jar, Pentagrama del Recuerdo.com.Compositores bolivianos in biografiascompbolivia. He also lived for two years in Montevideo with his family.Article by Rey Gonz\u00e1lez dans LaRaz\u00f3n, 2015, La Paz, Bolivia. From the outset of his career Caba won the praise of the renowned Spanish musicologist Adolfo Salazar, as Salas and Pauletto underscores, citing Salazar's comments in his book M\u00fasica y m\u00fasicos de hoy (1928) as well as his articles in the Spanish journal El Sol.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. His compositions were interpreted at the La Revue musicale in Paris by the pianist Ricardo Vi\u00f1es, one of the most active promoters of Caba's works, and the French composer and founder of the Revue, Henry Pruni\u00e8res, considered Caba as one of the most important representatives of values in Latin America.See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. Ninon Vallin, the French soprano who often stayed in Buenos Aires and was present at twenty seasons of the Teatro Col\u00f3n, has also interpreted Caba's works. Other promoters of the music of Caba include Beatriz Balzi and Mariana Alandia. == Style == The musicologists Salas and Pauletto consider Caba as an \"intuitive composer with the vernacular motives of his homeland\".See Salas and Pauletto (1938), loc. cit. The vernacular aspects are probably the most characteristic of Caba's musical language. But the intuitive character of Caba's work is probably the most interesting, and it is interesting to understand the origin of this \"intuition\". Salas and Pauletto, who knew personally Eduardo Caba, explain it in the following way: A representative example of Caba's music is his dance Kollavina, recently interpreted by the Bolivian guitarist Marcos Pu\u00f1a, and presented in the book of the two aforementioned musicologists.See Samuel J.A. Salas, Pedro I. Pauletto, Pedro J.S. Salas (1938). Historia de la M\u00fasica. Second volume: Am\u00e9rica Latina. Buenos Aires: Editorial Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Araujo, page 28. == Private life == Eduardo Caba married Mar\u00eda del Carmen Huergo in Buenos Aires and had two sons, Gregorio et Mar\u00eda Adelia. == Main works == * 9 Aires indios (de Bolivia) * Aires indios de Bolivia: ** Andantino ** Con reposo ** Reposado muy expresivo ** Calmado y expresivo ** Andantino ** Allegretto * Ocho motivos folkl\u00f3ricos de los valles de Bolivia (eight folkloric motives from the valleys of Bolivia): ** Allegretto ** Alegre moderato y expresivo ** Alegre y ritmo justo ** Andante expresivo ** Allegretto expresivo ** Un poco lento y expresivo ** Moderato ** Alegre moderato * Flor de bronce * Kapuri (La Hilandera) * Flor de amor * Kollavina * Indiecita * Kori-Killa (Luna de oro) * Himno al Sol, (version for piano) * Potos\u00ed, Symphonic poem containing: ** Leyenda Kechua ** Mon\u00f3logo Kechua ** Danza Kechua * Danzata, containing four dances for lute quartet == Bibliography == * Adolfo Salazar (1928).
