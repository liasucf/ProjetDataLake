After his father's death he inherited half his estate and his art collection. At the end of the Crimean War he went on a trip to Europe, where he explored several museums and exhibitions and decided to expand his father's collection. He began to actively buy up contemporary paintings and sculptures, mainly from France and in large part directly from the artists or their dealers. In a very short time he managed to expand the collection significantly - despite (or perhaps because of) his lack of age, experience and knowledge he appreciated modern artists such as Theodore Rousseau, Jules Dupr\u00e9, Delacroix, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, Constant Troyon Courbet and Corot and brought the Barbizon school to the attention of Russian audiences. \u0411\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0412. \u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u044b \u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u044b XIX \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u042d\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0435. \u041d\u0430\u0443\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433. \u2014 \u041b.: \u0418\u0441\u043a\u0443\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e, 1983. \u2014 \u0421. 7. He died suddenly in 1862 and his artworks were added to the collections of the museum at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St Petersburg, forming a distinct Kushelevskaya Gallery of over 500 paintings and sculptures.
