    "text": "Holiday in Europe was a long-playing vinyl album recorded for Bing Crosby's own company, Project Records at Radio Recorders, Hollywood and issued by Decca Records (DL-4281) in 1962. The album consists of twelve European songs. The orchestral arrangements were by Bob Thompson and the orchestra was conducted by Malcolm Lockyer at Decca\u2019s West Hampstead, London studios in October 1960. Crosby had recorded four of the songs with Lockyer on October 15, 1960 in London but a decision was taken not to use these vocal tracks. Crosby subsequently over-dubbed his vocals on all of the orchestral tracks in May 1961. Malcolm Lockyer does not receive a credit on the album cover. The album was issued on CD by MCA Victor, Inc., Japan (MVCM-294) in 1993. The album was also reissued as \"Holiday In Europe (And Beyond!)\" released in February of 2019 by Sepia Records. The album included the original songs and along with other 14 songs. ==Reception== Variety magazine reviewed the album saying \u201cIn an indie master deal with Project Records, Bing Crosby comes under the Decca banner once again. The package peg is a global song roundup which has Crosby working his way through such entries as \u201cUnder Paris Skies,\u201d \u201cMorgen,\u201d \u201cNever on Sunday\u201d and \u201cDomenica\u201d. It\u2019s flavorsome and pleasing.\u201d Crosby Post liked the album too. \"Many of you must, like me, have wondered 'can Bing do it'? An album full of ballads, just six a side and with full orchestra backing? After the multi-tracked El Se\u00f1or Bing and the Singalongs we were bound to have worries - but we need not have had for this is Bing's best album yet released of new material. It's Bing 1962, right bang up-to-date.\" ==Track listing== == References == Category:1962 albums Category:Bing Crosby albums Category:albums arranged by Bob Thompson (musician) ",
