    "text": "G. G. Allen Steam Station is a 1.140 GW coal-fired electricity generating facility, located in South Point Township, Gaston County, North Carolina, on man-made Lake Wylie (part of the Catawba River). Units 1 and 2 (165 MW each) began operating in 1957; units 3, 4, and 5 (275 MW each) in 1959, 1960, and 1961 respectively. Named for George Garland Allen, a former president and first chairman of the board for Duke Power, the Allen facility is the only Duke Energy station with five units under one roof. The plant is equipped with a flue-gas desulfurization system, completed in 2009, that decreases the air emissions coming from the plant. ==Environmental impact== G. G. Allen Steam Station is still a major air and water polluter in the region.
