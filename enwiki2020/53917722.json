In 1996, she published her first book Qui est au bout du fil ?. Franek also created post cards, art cards and T-shirts, as well as painting backgrounds for the theatre. Her book ' was the target of criticism by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, at the time president of the Union for a Popular Movement, who was upset that the work was included in a list of books recommended for use by primary school teachers. The book had earlier received an award in Belgium for best French language book and the Prix Libbylit at the Salon du livre de la jeunesse de Namur. The book's creators stated that their intent was to provide an uninhibited look at nudity. The controversy helped generate new interest in the book. Franek died at the age of 49 following a long illness. == Selected works == * Le drame (2000) * Rendez-vous \u00e0 quatre heures et demie (2004) * Non-Non et Grand Ours blond, comics (2005) * Le facteur n'est pas pass\u00e9 (2007) * O comme (2008) * Tous \u00e0 poil (2011), illustrated by Marc Daniau * La fabrique \u00e0 th\u00e9atre (2011), illustrator, text by Ghislaine Beaudout * Tout le monde \u00e0 dos !
