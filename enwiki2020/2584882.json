Squire Ding sends tax collectors and boxers to Xiao's fishing vessel but the fisherman refuses because the tax is illegal and the river had run dry. There's no fish for him to be taxed on. Two swashbucklers named Li Jun and Ni Rong help Xiao En. The now bloodied Boxers escape and report to Squire Ding. For his transgression, Xiao is whipped. Angered, he and his daughter go to Squire Ding's residence \u2013 The Ding Mansion. They sneak in, his daughter wearing the Qing Ding Pearl to masquerade as a noble. Inside, the pair slays everyone inside. ==Music== The play is a xipi (\u897f\u76ae western skins) play. ==History== The twentieth-century Chinese actor Mei Lanfang frequently performed the role of the fisherman's daughter to great acclaim. ==References== Category:Chinese operas Category:Peking operas Category:Song dynasty in fiction Category:Works based on Water Margin ",
