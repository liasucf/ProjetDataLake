    "text": "The Tamar River, officially kanamaluka / River Tamar, is a estuary located in northern Tasmania, Australia. Despite being called a river, the waterway is a brackish and tidal estuary over its entire length. ==Location and features== Formed by the confluence of the North Esk and South Esk rivers at , kanamaluka / Tamar River flows generally north towards its mouth at Low Head, north of the settlement George Town and into the Bass Strait via Port Dalrymple. Kanamaluka / Tamar River has several minor tributaries including the Supply River. Low Head Lighthouse is located at the tip of a peninsula, on the east side of the mouth of the Tamar River. The only full crossing of the river is the Batman Bridge in the relatively remote area of Sidmouth, around halfway up the river. Although the Port of Launceston is now used very little in comparison to the past and the SeaCat Tasmania ferry no longer docks at George Town, the river still is used for shipping, with light and heavy industries at George Town including aluminium smelters as well as commercial boat cruises. ==Etymology== The Tamar River was named after the River Tamar in South West England by Colonel William Paterson in December 1804. ==See also== * Rivers of Tasmania * Tamar Wetlands Important Bird Area ==References== ==External links== * History of the Tamar River Conservation Area Category:Rivers of Tasmania Category:Bass Strait ",
