    "text": "Beniamino Schiavon (died 1968 in his 60s), generally known as Mr. Nino (of the Drake) was the ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel of the Drake Hotel in New York City from 1942 until 1967. He was said to have created Steak Diane. To celebrate his 25th anniversary of service at the Drake, two hundred regulars gave him a cocktail party; Perle Mesta called him \"America's No. 1 Host\" and J. Edgar Hoover sent a letter. Schiavon was born in Padova, Italy, and worked as a busboy, waiter, and eventually captain at the Caf\u00e9 Savoia (Padova), the Bauer-Gr\u00fcnwald Hotel (Venice), the Plaza Hotel (New York), and others. In 1942, he became the ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel at the Hotel St. Moritz and then joined the Drake. Steak Diane is often attributed to Schiavon,Pierre Franey, \"60-Minute Gourmet; Steak Diane\", New York Times, January 31, 1979 who was said to have created the dish with Luigi Quaglino at the Plage Restaurant in Ostend, Belgium, and named it after a \"beauty of the nineteen-twenties\"\"Beniamino Schiavon is Dead; Known as Mr. Nino of the Drake\", New York Times, November 19, 1968, p. 47 or perhaps \"a reigning lady of the European demimonde in the nineteen twenties\".Grace Glueck, \"Hotel gives f\u00eate for its Ma\u00eetre D'\", New York Times, October 26, 1967, p. 50 But there are other candidates. Schiavon presided over the Drake Room where he provided \"impeccable service\",Stanley Turkel, Great American Hotel Architects, 2019, , p. 311 and later over Shepheard's, the Drake's \"elegant, Egyptified cafe\". Schiavon was a member of the Chevaliers du Tastevin. ==Notes== Category:Restaurant staff Category:People from Padua Category:People from New York City Category:1968 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain ",
