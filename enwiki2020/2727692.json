He produced many works depicting the horrors of the First World War in the latter part of his career. ==Life== Ride of the Valkyries De Groux was the son of the painter and engraver Charles de Groux. Like his father, he trained at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. Henry was elected a member of les XX in 1886, but was expelled in 1890 when he refused to have his works displayed in the same gallery as Vincent van Gogh. De Groux subsequently moved to Paris, where he befriended \u00c9mile Zola. During the social unrest resulting from the Dreyfus affair, de Groux acted as one of Zola's bodyguards. In Paris he also rubbed shoulders with other artists such as Toulouse-Lautrec, Whistler, Gauguin, Ensor, Rodin and Debussy. He also frequented many writers, including his future son-in-law Emile Baumann, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Guillaume Apollinaire, Oscar Wilde, L\u00e9on Bloy - with whom he maintained a fusional friendship - Verlaine, Zola, Heredia, Gide, Milosz, Remy de Gourmont and Joris-Karl Huysmans.
