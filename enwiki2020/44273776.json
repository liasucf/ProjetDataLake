He was the first Israeli victim in the First Palestinian Intifada. ==Biography== Dov Kalmanovich was born and raised in Jerusalem. He is a member of the seventh generation of his family to live in Jerusalem. Kalmanovich trained as an accountant, and worked in accounting early in his career. Under his leadership, the Jewish Quarter Development Corporation rebuilt the Hurva Synagogue. The intifada began on 9 December 1987. Kalmanovich was driving from his home in the Israeli settlement of Beit El in the West Bank to Jerusalem when a molotov cocktail was hurled \"through the windshield\" of his car. According to the Chicago Tribune, reporting shortly after the attack, \"Kalmanovich is the first Israeli civilian to be seriously injured in the unrest since it began Dec. 9\". The skin of his face and a large part of his body was burned away. The firebombing of Kamanovich's car and the scarring injuries he sustained play a role in Naomi Ragen's 2007 novel about the First Intifada, The Covenant. ==Political career== Kalmanovich is a member of the Jewish Home party. He headed the Jewish Home Party list in the 2013 municipal elections in Jerusalem. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Deputy Mayors of Jerusalem Category:Israeli accountants Category:Israeli Orthodox Jews Category:Israeli settlers Category:Israeli terrorism victims Category:People from Jerusalem Category:Survivors of terrorist attacks Category:The Jewish Home politicians ",
