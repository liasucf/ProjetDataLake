Atl\u00e9tico and Barcelona came into the match occupying the top two positions in the league, separated by just three points, and thus both teams could still claim the title. It was the first time since 1951 and just the third time in league history the La Liga title came down to a head-to-head match on the final weekend of play. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid earned the point that won them their first league title in 18 years, and their tenth overall. ==Background== In the 36th round of La Liga, Atl\u00e9tico lost 0\u20132 to Levante at Estadi Ciutat de Val\u00e8ncia while Barcelona and Real Madrid only earned one point in their home games against Getafe and Valencia respectively. With two weeks to play, Atl\u00e9tico led the table with a 3-point advantage over Barcelona and one point more over Real Madrid. After these results, Atl\u00e9tico could have won the league in the 37th and penultimate round if they earned one more point than Barcelona and Real. In this round, Atl\u00e9tico had a home tie against M\u00e1laga while Barcelona visited relegation-threatened Elche and Real Madrid played at Bala\u00eddos against Celta Vigo. Despite both Barcelona and Real Madrid failing to win their respective games (Barcelona ended 0\u20130 and Real were out of the title race after losing 2\u20130), Atl\u00e9tico could not win the title at home as they only could earn one point after a 1\u20131 draw. These results meant that the title would be decided in a head-to-head game at Camp Nou between Barcelona and Atl\u00e9tico, with Atl\u00e9tico having the advantage with a 3-point lead. The reverse fixture ended 0\u20130 meaning Atl\u00e9tico needed to avoid defeat to clinch the title, otherwise Barcelona would successfully defend their La Liga crown due to having the better head-to-head record out of the two sides. ==Match== Atl\u00e9tico Madrid forwards Diego Costa and Arda Turan became injured within the first 30 minutes, and were substituted off. Five minutes before half time, Barcelona took the lead into the break thanks to a goal by Alexis S\u00e1nchez after receiving a chest-pass from Lionel Messi. In the 4th minute of the second half however, a header from Diego God\u00edn off a corner kick made the score 1\u20131. Eight minutes after the goal, Barcelona's Sergio Busquets could not continue playing. In the 63rd minute Messi scored, but Barcelona were denied the lead they needed as the goal was ruled out for offside. Eventually the game ended as a 1\u20131 draw, which handed the Colchoneros their first league title in 18 years, and their 10th overall. ===Match details=== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"40%\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=center |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||13 || Jos\u00e9 Manuel Pinto |- |DF ||22 || Dani Alves |- |DF ||3 || Gerard Piqu\u00e9 || || |- |DF ||21 || Adriano |- |DF ||14 || Javier Mascherano || || |- |MF ||4 || Cesc F\u00e0bregas || || |- |MF ||16 || Sergio Busquets || || |- |MF ||8 || Andr\u00e9s Iniesta (c) |- |FW ||10 || Lionel Messi || || |- |FW ||9|| Alexis S\u00e1nchez |- |FW ||7|| Pedro Rodr\u00edguez || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||25|| Oier Olaz\u00e1bal |- |MF ||6|| Xavi || || |- |FW ||11|| Neymar || || |- |DF ||15|| Marc Bartra |- |MF ||17|| Alex Song || || |- |DF ||18|| Jordi Alba |- |FW ||20|| Cristian Tello |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4| Gerardo Martino |} |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||13 || Thibaut Courtois |- |DF ||20 || Juanfran |- |DF ||3 || Filipe Lu\u00eds || |- |DF ||2 || Diego God\u00edn || |- |DF ||23 || Miranda |- |MF ||10 || Arda Turan || || |- |MF ||5|| Tiago || |- |MF ||6 || Koke |- |MF ||14|| Gabi (c) |- |FW ||19|| Diego Costa || || |- |FW ||9 || David Villa |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||1|| Daniel Aranzubia |- |MF ||4|| Mario Su\u00e1rez |- |FW ||7|| Adri\u00e1n || || |- |FW ||8|| Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda || || |- |DF ||12|| Toby Alderweireld |- |MF ||14|| Diego Ribas |- |MF ||24|| Jos\u00e9 Sosa || || |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4| Diego Simeone |} |} {| width=82% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | width=50% valign=top| |style=\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\"| Match rules *90 minutes. *Maximum of three substitutions. |} ==Aftermath== Atl\u00e9tico Madrid celebrated its 10th league title. It was the first time since the 2003\u201304 La Liga that a club other than Barcelona or Real Madrid won the title. It was also the first time in the 67-year history of the Camp Nou stadium that a visiting team had clinched the title in the stadium. The draw meant that Barcelona would finish second, regardless of Real Madrid's result against Barcelona's city rivals Espanyol, as Bar\u00e7a would at worst have the better head-to-head record over their Cl\u00e1sico rivals (winning 2\u20131 at home and 4\u20133 away). Nonetheless, Real Madrid won 3\u20131, meaning second place was instead decided on the head-to-head tiebreaker. Just after the game, Gerardo Martino resigned as Barcelona's manager after one season in charge. The club only won the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, they were eliminated by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in the quarter-finals of the Champions League and lost 2\u20131 against Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey Final. Two days later, Diego God\u00edn was named Player of the Month for May. After celebrating the league title in Madrid, Atl\u00e9tico played in the Champions League Final seven days later, against their local rivals Real Madrid. Despite a header from Diego God\u00edn in the first half of the game, Sergio Ramos equalised for Real Madrid in the 3rd minute of second half stoppage time. In extra time, the Atl\u00e9tico players were visibly exhausted and eventually lost 4\u20131.https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/27383593 ==References== ==External links== *Highlights and report Category:2013\u201314 La Liga Category:La Liga matches Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid matches Category:FC Barcelona matches Category:May 2014 sports events in Europe Category:2010s in Barcelona ",
