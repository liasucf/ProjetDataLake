The woman, Yumi Sakata, accepts on a whim but her expressive features\u2014in particular, her eyes\u2014make that particular low-budget production into an unexpected hit. Ry\u014d is attracted to her but feels there is something dangerous or evil about her and doesn't want to have anything more to do with her. However, it isn't that simple. Ry\u014d's girlfriend, Mayumi, is a dominatrix who services a very powerful man. Mayumi's client, Mr. Okonogi, wants Yumi to work in an S&M; show club he owns. Mayumi fears she may be \"sacrificed\" if Mr. Okonogi doesn't get want he wants and she begs Ry\u014d to find Yumi and persuade her to go to the S&M; club. Ry\u014d finally persuades Yumi to go to the club with him and Mayumi by telling her that he loves her and that Mayumi is an ex- girlfriend from a long time ago. Yumi becomes a star dominatrix (even through the film Ry\u014d made showed her being whipped rather than whipping submissives as she does at the club). Ry\u014d finds himself torn between his feelings for Mayumi and Yumi's expectations. He also stands to make a considerable amount of money as Yumi's \"manager\" and companion. Mr. Okonogi, who defines sadism and masochism as \"two sides of the same coin,\" and who enjoys watching as well as participating, refuses to let Mayumi retire. It appears that he has the power of life-and-death over her. One of Mayumi's female friends, Natsumi, commits suicide rather than continue working in the S&M; industry. Mayumi goes to the funeral. Ry\u014d does not. ==Cast== * Toshio Kakei () as Ry\u014d Masuda * Yoshiko Yura () as Yumi Sakata * Kumi Shiraishi () as Mayumi Yamane (dominatrix) * Y\u014dsuke Nakajima () as Dai * Renji Ishibashi () as Ry\u016bsaku Okunogi ==Background and availability== While in Paris as a foreign exchange student in the early 1990s, Issei Sagawa was arrested for the murder and cannibalization of his girlfriend.
