Founded in 1997, Paris Photo is held in November at the historic Grand Palais exhibition hall and museum complex located at the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in the 8th arrondissement in Paris, France. The annual event for photography collectors, professionals, artists, and enthusiasts, Paris Photo offers its visitors the most qualitative and diverse selection of photo-based artworks alongside an ambitious public programme of exhibitions, prizes, artists signature sessions and talks featuring leading figures in the field. The fair reunites over 180 leading galleries and book dealers showcasing the largest selection of premium quality artworks available on the market today from vintage and modern works to contemporary creations, as well as rare and limited editions, and avant-premiere book releases. Today, the Fair presents 4 exhibitor sectors: the main gallery sector featuring solo and group shows and thematic projects, the PRISMES sector devoted to large-format, series and installation works, the video sector highlighting moving images, and the Book sector bringing together both publishers and book dealers. ==History== Founded in 1997, Paris Photo presented 53 galleries for its first edition at the Carrousel du Louvre.
