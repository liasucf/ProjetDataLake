    "text": "Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse (born Albert-Ernest Carrier de Belleuse; 12 June 1824 \u2013 4 June 1887) was a French sculptor. He was one of the founding members of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and was made an officer of the Legion of Honour. ==Early life== Carrier-Belleuse was born on 12 June 1824 at Anizy-le-Ch\u00e2teau, Aisne, France. He began his training as a goldsmith's apprentice. Carrier-Belleuse was a student of David d'Angers and briefly studied at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. His career is distinguished by his versatility and his work outside France: in England between 1850 and 1855 (working for Mintons), and in Brussels around 1871. His name is perhaps best known because Auguste Rodin worked as his assistant between 1864 and 1870. The two travelled to Brussels in 1871, and by some accounts Rodin assisted Carrier-Belleuse's architectural sculpture for the Brussels Stock Exchange. ==Career== La Bacchante, 1863, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay Carrier-Belleuse made many terra cotta pieces, the most famous of which may be The Abduction of Hippodameia depicting the Greek mythological scene of a centaur kidnapping Hippodameia on her wedding day. He was made artistic director at the Manufacture nationale de S\u00e8vres in 1876. ===Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts=== In 1862 Carrier- Belleuse was one of the founding members of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux- Arts, and was made an officer of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. The bronzes he executed prior to 1868 were always signed \"Carrier\" or \"A. Carrier\", but after 1868 his signature was changed to \"Carrier-Belleuse\". ===Artistic style=== His work encompassed all manner of sculptural subjects and materials, and his naturalism incorporated a breadth of styles: unembellished Realism, neo- Baroque exuberance, and Rococo elegance. ==Family== His sons were the painters Louis-Robert Carrier-Belleuse and Pierre Carrier-Belleuse. ==Death and legacy== Carrier-Belleuse died on 4 June 1887 at S\u00e8vres, France. ==Works of art== * Pediment sculpture of Abundance, Pavillon de Flore, South fa\u00e7ade of the Great Galerie, Louvre palace, Paris, circa 1863 * Caryatids themed on the four seasons, Vichy Opera, for architect Charles Badger, 1865 * Architectural sculpture for the Tribunal de commerce de Paris (Commercial Court of Paris), on the \u00cele de la Cit\u00e9, for architect Antoine-Nicolas Bailly, completed 1865 * A silvered bronze chimney-piece for the H\u00f4tel de la Pa\u00efva, Paris, 1866The Grove encyclopedia of decorative arts, Volume 1 By Gordon Campbell * Monument to Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na, Nice, 1869 * Architectural work at the Brussels Stock Exchange, Brussels, circa 1870 * Mary Queen of Scots, Private Collection, ca. 1870 * Two elaborate multifigure torch\u00e8res for the base of grand staircase, Palais Garnier (Paris Opera), Pairs, 1873 * Tomb of Belgian photographer Louis Gh\u00e9mar, Laeken Cemetery, Brussels, 1873Encyclopedia of nineteenth-century photography, Volume 1 By John Hannavy * Architectural work for the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance, Paris, for architect Charles de Lalande, 1873 * Sea Nymph for the fountain at the Place du The\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais, Paris, for architect Gabriel Davioud, 1874 * Four Seasons fountain, Hotel de Ville, Fleurance * Mausoleum of Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn, Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral, Buenos Aires * Equestrian statue of Mihai Viteazul, University Square, Bucharest, Romania * Equestrian statue of Manuel Belgrano, Plaza de Mayo Square, Buenos Aires, Argentina * Equestrian statue of Bernardo O'Higgins, Alameda, Santiago de Chile, Chile * Statue for the victims of the La Compa\u00f1\u00eda fire, originally at the place of the fire, today in front of the General Cemetery in Santiago de Chile, Chile ==Gallery== File:Rodin Carrie-Belleuse p1070142.jpg|Bust of Carrier-Belleuse by Auguste Rodin File:Mihai Viteazul statue.jpg|Equestrian statue of Mihai Viteazul in Bucharest File:Marie Carrier-Belleuse.jpg|Marie Carrier-Belleuse, 1859, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay File:Albert carrier-belleuse, busto di donna con diadema, 1860-70 ca.JPG|Bust of a Woman with a Diadem, c. 1860\u20131870, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay File:Harmonie, Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse, Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten Gent, 1965-J.jpg|Harmony, Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent File:L\u00e9da et le cygne par Carrier-Belleuse.jpg|Leda and the Swan, c. 1870, Metropolitan Museum of Art File:Longchamp205a Carrier Psych\u00e9.jpg|Psyche, 1872 File:Sea nymph Carrier-Belleuse.jpg|Sea Nymph from a fountain on the Place du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais, Paris, 1874 ==References== ==External links== * The R.W.
