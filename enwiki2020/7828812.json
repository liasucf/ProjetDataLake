    "text": "TI Extended Basic cartridge TI Extended BASIC is a discontinued implementation of the BASIC programming language interpreter for the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A home computer. ==Features== TI produced an Extended BASIC cartridge that greatly enhanced the functionality accessible to TI BASIC users. Sprites could be generated and set up to move automatically with simple one-line commands. Custom \"CALL\" subprograms, access to memory expansion for larger programs, multiple statement lines (with the statement separator ::), Boolean logic in IF statements, assembly language linkage, as well as the ability to display text at any location on the screen, were all added while largely retaining compatibility with TI BASIC. ===Speech synthesis=== When equipped with the TI Speech Synthesizer, TI Extended BASIC users could also generate speech from a predefined vocabulary as easily as writing text on-screen. For example, the following line of text entered after the \">\" command-line prompt would cause the speech synthesizer to identify the computer: >CALL SAY(\"HELLO I AM A #TEXAS INSTRUMENTS# T I NINETY NINE FOUR A HOME COMPUTER\") Multi-word phrases are delimited with the # symbol, as `#TEXAS INSTRUMENTS#` in this example. Using a word not included in the speech synthesizer's built-in vocabulary of 338 words and phrases would cause it to slowly spell out the word. TI's Terminal Emulator II cartridge provided text-to-speech functionality. TI Extended BASIC also provided raw access to the speech synthesizer, but very few developers had the resources to generate the speech data and this function was rarely used. ==Elements of TI Extended BASIC== ===Statements=== TI Extended BASIC has several statements not present in TI BASIC: ACCEPT, IMAGE, LINPUT, ON BREAK, ON ERROR, ON WARNING, SUB, SUBEND, SUBEXIT ==References== ==External links== * Using Sprites In TI Extended BASIC * Extended BASIC Review * TI Extended BASIC for the TI-99/4 Home Computer (manual) at 99er.net Category:BASIC interpreters Category:Discontinued BASICs Category:Texas Instruments TI-99/4A ",
