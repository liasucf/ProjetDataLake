    "text": "Professional agrologist (abbreviated PAg) in Canada, also called agronome (abbreviated agr.) in Qu\u00e9bec, is the professional designation for the agrology profession in Canada. There are more than 10,000 professional agrologists and agronomes in Canada , registered in ten (10) provincial institutes of agrologists. In the United States the professional designation is Certified Professional Agronomist (abbreviated C.PAg) . ==Role of the agrologist== Agrologists are science based consultants, educated and specializing in areas such as animal science, food science, genetic engineering, soil science and environmental sciences. Professional agrologists may provide advice directly to farmers, vineyards, agricultural corporations., municipal and provincial governments, the fertilizer and seeds sector, consult on food processing, advise on range management, turf management and golf course operations, assess and provide remedial recommendations for brownlands (contaminated sites), watersheds, among many different areas of practice. ==Regulation and certification== In Canada, professional agrologists are accredited through provincial regulatory bodies, e.g. Saskatchewan Institute of Agrology, Nova Scotia Institute of Agrologists. The requirements to attain professional designation (PAg) are similar in each province. A prospective agrologist is typically required to have a four year undergraduate science degree directly related to agrology. If accepted by their provincial institute, the applicant is known as an articling agrologist (AAg) or agrologist-in-training (AIT) and will complete a two year educational and mentorship program before being considered for a professional designation. ==Alternate certifications== In Canada, a certification called Registered Technical Agrologist (RTag), or (PTag) is available, requiring a two-year college or university education in the agricultural sciences instead of a 4-year degree. These technologists designations require a two year mentorship and education program, and participate in same mentorship process as a professional agrologist. In the United States, the American Society of Agronomy is the regulatory organization responsible for certification. The American Society of Agronomy uses a sliding scale of education and experience to determine certification - it is required to have either a bachelor's degree in science and 5 years work experience, a master's degree related to agrology and 3 years work experience, or a Doctorate related to agrology and a single year of work experience. CPAgs are required to complete at least 50 hours of continuing education through the American Society of Agronomy every two years in order to retain their certification. The American Society of Agronomy also provides certifications for Certified Crop Advisors (CCA). To become a Certified Crop Adviser (CCA) an applicant must pass two exams that may both be written on the same day at the same location. The International exam is written by CCAs in North America. The Prairie region exam is written by individuals wishing to work as advisers in the three Prairie provinces of Canada or in the heartland states of the USA. ==See also== *Agronomy *Agricultural Science *Agricultural engineering *Horticulture *Animal Science *Botany *American Society of Agronomy *Forestry *Aquaculture *Forestry ==References== ==External links== * American Society of Agronomy * Agricultural Institute of Canada * Alberta Institute of Agrologists * British Columbia Institute of Agrologists * Manitoba Institute of Agrologists * New Brunswick Institute of Agrologists * Newfoundland and Labrador Institutes of Agrologists * Nova Scotia Institute of Agrologists * Ontario Institute of Agrologists * Prince Edward Island Institute of Agrologists * Saskatchewan Institute of Agrologists * l'Ordre des Agronomes du Qu\u00e9bec * British Columbia Institute of Agrologists Agrologist Category:Professional titles and certifications Agrologist ",
