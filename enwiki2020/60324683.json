Ginell said \"Benny Golson had not appeared on an American jazz label in a long time, so Bob Karcy of Arkadia Jazz stepped in where others feared to tread, issuing this live gig from a jazz club somewhere in Switzerland on the last day of a tour ... Stanley Crouch's liner notes are full of his usual respect-your- elders blather and the sound quality is boxy, but Golson's fans will feel fortunate to have this\". JazzTimes' Harvey Pekar observed \"In addition to being among the great jazz composer-arrangers, Golson\u2019s a superb tenor saxophonist ... The group takes a couple of tunes at a rapid clip but most are done at medium and slow tempos. On them Golson\u2019s warm tone and inventiveness come to the fore. And he can still cook\".Pekar, H., JazzTimes Review, accessed March 25, 2019 == Track listing == All compositions by Benny Golson except where noted # \"Up Jumped Spring\" (Freddie Hubbard) \u2013 8:48 # \"Stablemates\" \u2013 8:46 # Talk Intro \u2013 0:23 # \"Tiny Capers\" (Clifford Brown) \u2013 10:45 # Talk Intro \u2013 0:24 # \"I Remember Clifford\" \u2013 15:21 # \"For Old Times Sake\" (James Williams) \u2013 6:32 # \"Whisper Not\" \u2013 10:02 # \"Gypsy Jingle Jangle\" \u2013 10:25 == Personnel == *Benny Golson \u2013 tenor saxophone *Kevin Hays \u2013 piano *Dwayne Burno - bass *Carl Allen \u2013 drums ===Production=== *Michael Muller \u2013 producer *Heiri Wolf \u2013 engineer == References == Category:Benny Golson live albums Category:1997 live albums Category:Arkadia Jazz live albums ",
