In addition, several well-known BDSM performance artists appear, including Chaos Clowns, Luci the Axle Grinder, also known as \"Lucifire\", Miss Kimberly, The Fetisnonn, Suzi Woodroffe, and Tutu. The film was originally developed by the BBC, but they later dropped the script, believing it would never be suitable for broadcast on UK TV. However, in April 2004 the movie was shown on terrestrial TV in the UK on BBC One. The film was banned in the Republic of Ireland by then film censor Sheamus Smith on 28 October 1997; he also banned the subsequent video release of the film.http://www.preachingtotheperv.com/irish- censor-bans-both-film-and-trailer/ The trailer caused a mass recall of the rental VHS release of Donnie Brasco (which had been passed as an 18), because the trailer had not been classified. 3,300 copies of that cassette were withdrawn and replaced, with a potential fine of \u20ac1000 to stores providing it.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/trailer-to-video-of-gangster-movie-is- illegal-1.121254https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/monty-outstrips-them- all-1.123878 In 2013 the film became the first European feature film to be restored and remastered on crowd-funding site Kickstarter by its fans. The remastered Blu-ray became available in August 2013. The film also inspired the 2013 Edinburgh Fringe Show \"Darkest Fantasy\", based on the character Tanya's wedding fantasy. ==Plot== Henry Harding MP, a British government minister on a moral crusade, hires an inexperienced young computer whizzkid, Peter Emery who works for a Christian computer company called Holy Hardware, to infiltrate the United Kingdom BDSM scene. Harding is set on putting a club called \"House of Thwax\" run by Mistress Tanya Cheex out of business, and is sure that Peter's secretly videotaped evidence of the club's activities will do the trick. However, the virginal Peter takes a liking to Tanya Cheex and finds himself falling for the Mistress. Amongst the locations used Layer Marney Tower in Essex plays a pivotal role for a party scene. ==Cast== *Guinevere Turner .... Tanya Cheex *Christien Anholt .... Peter Emery *Tom Bell ....
