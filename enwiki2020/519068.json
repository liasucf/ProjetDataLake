In its usual form it consists of four p\u0101das or quarter-verses, of 8 syllables each,W. J. Johnson (2010), Oxford Dictionary of Hinduism. or (according to an alternative analysis) of two half-verses of 16 syllables each. The meter is similar to the Vedic anu\u1e63\u1e6dubh meter, but with stricter rules. The \u015bloka is the basis for Indian epic verse, and may be considered the Indian verse form par excellence, occurring as it does far more frequently than any other meter in classical Sanskrit poetry. The \u015bloka is the verse-form generally used in the Bhagavad Gita, the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, the Puranas, Smritis, and scientific treatises of Hinduism such as Sushruta Samhita and Charaka Samhita. The Mahabharata, for example, features many verse meters in its chapters, but 95% of the stanzas are \u015blokas of the anu\u1e63\u1e6dubh type, and most of the rest are tristubhs. One of the Vedic metres is called anushtubha. It has 32 syllables with particular accents. It is the literary ancestor of the shloka which also has 32 syllables but no particular rhyme or accent. A reason for the name shloka is that Maharshi Valmiki who wrote the Ramayana once observed a pair of birds singing to each other in a tree. A hunter came by and shot the male. On seeing the sorrow (shoka) of the widowed bird, he was reminded of the sorrow Sita felt on being separated from Shri Rama and began composing the Ramayana in shlokas. For this he is called the Adikavi (first poet.) The anu\u1e63\u1e6dubh is found in Vedic texts, but its presence is minor, and tri\u1e63\u1e6dubh and gayatri meters dominate in the Rigveda. A dominating presence of \u015blokas in a text is a marker that the text is likely post-Vedic. The traditional view is that this form of verse was involuntarily composed by V\u0101lm\u012bki, the author of the Ramayana, in grief on seeing a hunter shoot down one of two birds in love (see Valmiki). In a broader sense, a \u015bloka, according to Monier-Williams, can be \"any verse or stanza; a proverb, saying\". ==Difference between shloka and mantra== A Shloka has to be composed in a specific meter (chanDas), with a specific number of lines with a specific number of words per lin, each word could be a manTra. For example, vishNu sahasranAma is in anushtupchanDas (two lines of four words each). A manTra, on the other hand, is prefixed by omkAra (primordial sound) and suffixed by the essential nAma (name) and the salutary word nama (salutation) between the prefix and the suffix. No meter is prescribed. The lyrics in any Vaarnic or matric meters are shlokas. Stanzas from Vedic hymns are not shloka, despite a common mistake. ==Metrical pattern== Each 16-syllable hemistich (half-verse), of two 8-syllable p\u0101das, can take either a pathy\u0101 (\"normal\") form or one of several vipul\u0101 (\"extended\") forms. The form of the second foot of the first p\u0101da (II.) limits the possible patterns the first foot (I.) may assume. The scheme below shows the form of the \u015bloka in the classical period of Sanskrit literature (4th\u201311th centuries CE): Shloka scheme The pathy\u0101 and vipul\u0101 half-verses are arranged in the table above in order of frequency of occurrence. Out of 2579 half-verses taken from Kalidasa, Bharavi, Magha, and Bilhana, each of the four admissible forms of \u015bloka in this order claims the following share: 2289, 116, 89, 85;Macdonell, Arthur A., A Sanskrit Grammar for Students, Appendix II, p. 233 (Oxford University Press, 3rd edition, 1927) that is, 89% of the half- verses have the regular pathy\u0101 form. Macdonell's chart given above is too restrictive with regard the first four syllables in a vipul\u0101 verse. For example, the first quarter verse of the R\u0101maya\u1e47a (critical edition) contains a na-vipul\u0101 and scans \u23d1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u23d1 \u23d1 \u23d1 \u2013 (tapa\u1e25sv\u0101dhy\u0101yanirata\u1e43). Other examples are easy to find among classical poets, e.g., R\u0101macarita 1.76 manyur deh\u0101vadhir aya\u1e43 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u23d1 \u23d1 \u23d1 \u2013. In the ma-vipul\u0101, a caesura is not obligatory after the fifth syllable, e.g., \u015ai\u015bup\u0101lavadha 2.1a yiyak\u1e63am\u0101\u1e47en\u0101h\u016bta\u1e25 \u23d1 \u2013 \u23d1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013. Two rules that always apply are:Michael Hahn: \"A brief introduction into the Indian metrical system for the use of students\". :1. In both p\u0101das, in syllables 2\u20133, u u is not allowed. :2. In the second p\u0101da, in syllables 2\u20134, \u2013 u \u2013 is not allowed Noteworthy is the avoidance of an iambic cadence in the first p\u0101da. By comparison, syllables 5\u20138 of any p\u0101da in the old Vedic anu\u1e63\u1e6dubh meter typically had the iambic ending u \u2013 u x (where \"x\" represents an anceps syllable). In poems of the intermediate period, such as the Bhagavad Gita (c. 2000 BCE), a fourth vipul\u0101 is found. This occurs 28 times in the Bhagavad Gita, that is, as often as the third vipul\u0101.Morton Smith, R. (1961). \u015alokas and Vipulas. Indo-Iranian Journal Vol. 5, No. 1 (1961), pp. 19-35. When this vipul\u0101 is used, there is a word-break (caesura) after the fourth syllable: :| x x x \u2013, | \u2013 u \u2013 x || The various vipul\u0101s, in the order above, are known to scholars writing in English as the first, second, third and fourth vipul\u0101,Keith (1920), p. 421. or the paeanic, choriambic, molossic, and trochaic vipul\u0101 respectively.Morton Smith (1961), p. 19. In Sanskrit writers, they are referred to as the na-, bha-, ra-, and ma-vipul\u0101. A fifth vipul\u0101, known as the minor Ionic, in which the first p\u0101da ends | u u \u2013 x |, is sometimes found in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, although rarely.Hopkins, p. 222. Statistical studies examining the frequency of the vipul\u0101s and the patterns in the earlier part of the p\u0101da have been carried out to try to establish the preferences of various authors for different metrical patterns. It is believed that this may help to establish relative dates for the poems, and to identify interpolated passages.Morton Smith (1961).Brockington (1998), pp. 117\u2013130. ==Examples== A typical ' is the following, which opens the Bhagavad Gita: : : : : :| \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | :| u u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 || :| \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 \u2013 u | :| u u \u2013 u | u \u2013 u u || :\"(Dh\u1e5btara\u1e63\u1e6dra said:) In the place of righteousness, at Kuruk\u1e63etra, :gathered together and desiring battle, :my sons and the sons of Pandu, :what did they do, Sanjaya?\" From the period of high classical Sanskrit literature comes this benediction, which opens B\u0101\u1e47abha\u1e6d\u1e6da's biographical poem Har\u1e63acaritam (7th century CE): : : :| u \u2013 \u2013 u | u \u2013 \u2013 u | \u2013 u \u2013 u | u \u2013 u \u2013 || :| \u2013 \u2013 u u | u \u2013 \u2013 u | \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 | u \u2013 u \u2013 || :\"Praise be to \u015aambhu, beautified by the chowrie moon touching his lofty head; :like a foundation pillar of a city that is the universe.\"Translation from Daniel H. Ingalls (translator) (1965): Sanskrit Poetry, from Vidy\u0101kara's Treasury. (Harvard). When a \u015bloka is recited, performers sometimes leave a pause after each p\u0101da, at other times only after the second p\u0101da.
