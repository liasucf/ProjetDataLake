    "text": "The Dandenong Valley Parklands are a collection of public parks in south east Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The parks stretch from Boronia Road in the north to Wellington Road in the south, through the suburbs of Vermont South, Wantirna, Wantirna South, and Wheelers Hill. The parklands are separated into six individual parks, roughly following the path of Dandenong Creek for about 10 km. These include a range of landscapes including remnant bushland, semi- rural land, and open parkland. The Parklands form a large part of the habitat corridor of Dandenong Creek, along with some nearby public spaces such as the Police Road Retarding Basin, Tirhatuan Park, Dandenong Police Paddocks Reserve, and Churchill National Park. ==History== The land of the Dandenong Valley Parklands was reserved by the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works in 1973 as part of a plan to create more public open spaces. Plans for the Parklands were originally announced in 1975, and the first publicly accessible section, Jells Park, was opened in 1976. Management of the Parklands was transferred from Melbourne Water to the newly formed Melbourne Parks and Waterways in 1994. This organisation was absorbed by Parks Victoria in 1996, and ownership of the Parklands was formally transferred to Parks Victoria in 1997. Following the formal termination of Melbourne Parks and Waterways in 2001, the land was transferred to the State Government of Victoria, and now exists as crown land. (accessed through Mapshare) Two civic reports on the Dandenong Valley Parklands have been written, titled Future Directions Plans. They were released in 1995 (by Melbourne Parks and Waterways) and 2006 (by Parks Victoria). In 1989, the Friends of Dandenong Valley Parklands was formed, and continues to contribute to maintenance of the parks, including revegetation, weeding, installing nest boxes, and habitat monitoring. ==See also== Constituent parks *Koomba Park *Jells Park *Bushy Park Wetlands Nearby parks *Campbells Croft Reserve *Blackburn Lake Sanctuary *Ringwood Lake *Lysterfield Lake Park *Dandenong Police Paddocks Reserve *Churchill National Park Nearby trails *Dandenong Creek Trail *EastLink Trail *Blind Creek Trail ==References== ==External links== *Dandenong Valley Parklands at Parks Victoria *Map at Parks Victoria *Friends of Dandenong Valley Parklands Category:Parks in Melbourne ",
