In 1943 the Calypso Restaurant opened and James Baldwin was hired as a busser and dish washer. Early in Baldwin's career at the Calypso he met artists, writers, and activists such as Beauford Delaney (the modernist painter who introduced James Baldwin to Connie Williams in 1943), Marlon Brando (then an acting student), and labor organizerStan Weir. With the encouragement and support of Williams and Delaney the young Baldwin developed as a writer and intellectual. Williams remained friends with Baldwin throughout his life, hosting a birthday party for him on 20 May 1963 at her San Francisco restaurant on Fillmore Street.
