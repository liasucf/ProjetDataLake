(Patrice Lumumba, former Prime Minister of Congo, was her great uncle.https://sammusmusic.com/2012/07/02/happy-birthday-patrice-lumumba/) Her parents, both professors, moved her family to Ithaca, NY at an early age, her mother teaching at Cornell University and her father at Wells College. She began producing music in highschool under the name DJ Eno, first using the PlayStation program MTV Music Generator, and the digital audio workstation Reason to create beats. When she was trying to pick a new name for herself, a friend recommended the name Samus, after the main character of the Metroid series of games, since both are women in male dominated genres. == Education == Sammus holds a bachelor's degree from Cornell University. She then worked full-time as teacher, in Houston, Texas for Teach for America. Sammus then returned to Cornell in Fall 2011 to pursue a PhD in Science and Technology Studies. She has since received her MA in Science and Technology Studies in 2015.https://enongo-lk.com/ In 2019, she completed her degree in absentia while living in Philadelphia. She is currently a postdoctoral scholar at the Cogut Institute for the Humanities at Brown University. == Music == Sammus' influences started with her older brother Disashi (currently a member of Gym Class Heroes), who exposed her both to video games and alternative rock bands like Weezer and Nirvana. In addition, Sammus has stated that she has been heavily influenced by Kanye West, particularly his debut album The College Dropout: Sammus released her debut EP Fly Nerd in 2010. She followed up with the album M'Other Brain in 2012. After Mega Ran was exposed to Sammus' music, the two began collaborating. In 2013, within a few hours of releasing her second album, Prime, it became the bestselling rap album on Bandcamp. In December 2013, Sammus launched a Kickstarter campaign for her fourth album, a concept album based on Metroid. This album, Another M earned her fans of the nerdcore subgenre. In various interviews and social media, Sammus has clarified that she doesn't identify herself as a nerdcore rapper, and instead prefers the term \"Afrofuturism\" to refer to her video-game centered music because it requires an engagement with her Blackness. == Performances == Sammus has toured the U.S. with Mega Ran on the Rappers with Arm Cannons tour in 2015. She has performed at the SXSW Music Festival since 2015, the Penny Arcade Expo (PAX East) in 2015, Geek Girl Con in 2014 and 2015 with plans to return in 2016. She has also performed at the east coast's music and gaming festival, MAGfest, in 2015 and 2016. In June 2017 she performed at McCarren park in Greenpoint Brooklyn as part of the Northside Festival. == Discography == * 2010 - Fly Nerd (EP, self-released) * 2012 - M'Other Brain (NuBlack Music Group) * 2012 - Reset: Instrumentals (self-released) * 2013 - Prime (NuBlack Music Group) * 2013 - Nerdcore Instrumentals: Castlevania Edition (with DJ Cutman) * 2013 - Castlevania: The Nocturnal Cantata (Joypad Records) * 2014 - Another M (NuBlack Music Group) * 2014 - Nerdcore Instrumentals 2 (with DJ Cutman) * 2016 - InFusion (EP, NuBlack Music Group) * 2016 - Pieces in Space (Don Giovanni Records) == References == == External links == * Official Website * Sammus on Genius Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:American hip hop musicians Category:Cornell University alumni Category:American female rappers Category:African-American female rappers Category:Nerdcore artists Category:Musicians from Ithaca, New York Category:Rappers from New York (state) Category:Teach For America alumni Category:21st-century American rappers Category:21st-century American women musicians Category:Educators from New York City ",
