    "text": "Greatest Hits is the first compilation album by the American rock band Boston. The album, released on June 3, 1997, features songs originally released on both the Epic and MCA labels, as well as three previously unreleased recordings (\"Tell Me\", \"Higher Power\" and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"). Tom Scholz, the band's leader, felt that the album's sound quality was not up to his standards, so a remastered version of the album was released in 2009 with a slightly different track listing. Boston embarked on a tour for this album both times it was released. The album was certified double platinum by the RIAA on December 4, 2003, and it has sold 2,234,000 copies in the United States as of August 2014. The cover features the guitar-shaped spaceship flying low over a planet with turquoise rocks and a turquoise tower in the distance. The backside shows a personification of New York City. To this day it is still a mystery why they choose NYC instead of Boston, the city they are named after and which they usually show on their artwork. == Track listing == ==Personnel== * Tom Scholz \u2013 guitar, bass, organ, drums, clavinet, keyboards, hand clapping * Brad Delp \u2013 vocals, guitar * Barry Goudreau \u2013 guitar * Fran Sheehan \u2013 bass guitar * Sib Hashian \u2013 drums * Jim Masdea \u2013 drums * Gary Pihl \u2013 guitar * Fran Cosmo \u2013 vocals * David Sikes \u2013 bass guitar, vocals * Doug Huffman \u2013 drums * Michael Brinton \u2013 ukulele * Zachary Brinton \u2013 bass guitar, guitar, drums, background singer == Charts and certifications == ;Charts {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1997) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |Canadian Top Selling Albums |style=\"text-align:center;\"|61 |- |US Billboard 200 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|47 |- |} {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" !scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14.7em;\"|Chart (2014) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |US Catalog Albums |style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |} \"Higher Power\" Peaked at #17 on the Billboard Heritage Rock Chart on July 5, 1997.
