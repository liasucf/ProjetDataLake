On his deathbed, Lunalilo had requested a burial at Kawaiaha\u02bbo Church on the church's ground instead of Royal Mausoleum at Mauna \u02bbAla in Nu\u02bbuanu Valley, the burial site of most modern Hawaiian monarchs. Historians have speculated that the democratically elected king wanted to be buried in the cemetery to be closer to the common people. Another reasoning for his refusal to be buried alongside his predecessors was rooted in a feud between Lunalilo and the Kamehameha family over his mother Kek\u0101uluohi's exclusion from the list of royalty to be buried there in the 1860s. Kek\u0101uluohi's remains were buried at sea by Lunalilo. After his state funeral in 1874, Lunalilo's remains were temporarily interred at the Royal Mausoleum at Mauna \u02bbAla, awaiting the completion of the Lunalilo Mausoleum. The tomb was built under the instructions of his father Charles Kana\u02bbina, who survived him. Robert Lishman, an Englishman from Australia, designed and supervised the construction. On November 23, 1875, his remains were taken from the Royal Mausoleum to the almost completed tomb on the grounds of Kawaiaha\u02bbo Church. His father requested a second funeral and a 21-gun salute from King Kal\u0101kaua like during the first royal funeral. Kal\u0101kaua granted the second funeral but refused to allow the 21-gun salute. During this procession, eyewitness reports stated that a sudden storm arose, and that twenty-one rapid thunderclaps echoed across Honolulu which came to be known as the \"21-gun salute.\" The Mausoleum in the 19th-century The tomb was completed in 1876. His father Charles Kana\u02bbina was buried in the vault after his death in 1877. A maternal cousin of Lunalilo Miriam Auhea Kek\u0101uluohi Crowningburg served as kahu (caretaker) for the mausoleum until her death in 1899. In acknowledgement of her chiefly status, she was buried in the lot outside the vault of Lunalilo's Mausoleum. Her grandson William Bishop Taylor, who served as kahu for the Royal Mausoleum at Mauna \u02bbAla, would also later be buried within the same lot. The interior of the Mausoleum contains the two koa wood caskets of Lunalilo and his father on red-carpeted floors. Three k\u0101hili encased in Italian marble are set near the caskets. In 1917, Albert Gergbode and Paul Payne, two American naval sailors, broke into the tomb in search of burial goods and stole a silver crown and a silver plate inscribed with the biography of Lunalilo. The culprits melted down the silver objects and tried to pawn it in Key West, Florida, where they were arrested for the crime. ===Interments=== Interior of Lunalilo Mausoleum with Lunalilo's casket center and Kana\u02bbina's casket to the right *Lunalilo (1835\u20131874), sixth monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii *Charles Kana\u02bbina (1801\u20131877), father of Lunalilo *Miriam Auhea Kek\u0101uluohi Crowningburg (1839\u20131899), cousin of Lunalio, buried outside the tomb *William Edward Bishop Kaihe\u02bbekai Taylor (1882\u20131956), grandson of Crowningburg, buried outside the tomb ==See also== *Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii **List of burials in the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * Category:Buildings and structures in Honolulu Category:Burial sites of Hawaiian royal houses Category:Cemeteries in Hawaii Category:Landmarks in Hawaii Category:Mausoleums in the United States Category:Protected areas of Oahu Category:Royalty of the Hawaiian Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1876 Category:1876 establishments in Hawaii Category:House of Kalaimamahu ",
