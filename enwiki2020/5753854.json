The King James Version of this passage reads: :\"So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression. Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the subjects (netinim).\": King James Version Other versions, e.g. the New King James Version, make clear the scope of the book was the kings of Israel: :... they were inscribed in the book of the kings of Israel. But Judah was carried away captive to Babylon because of their unfaithfulness.: New King James Version The book is referred to again at , which reads: :\"Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.\" and refer to the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah: :\"The other events in Jotham's reign, including his wars and other things he did, are written in the book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.\" Basel theologian Hans-Peter Mathys considers the expressions to be \"factually identical\".Mathys, H.
