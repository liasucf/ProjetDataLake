    "text": "Dan Margalit (born March 6, 1976) is an American mathematician at the Georgia Institute of Technology. His research fields include geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology, with a particular focus on mapping class groups of surfaces. ==Education and career== Margalit earned his bachelor's degree from Brown University. He earned his doctorate from the University of Chicago in 2003, advised by Benson Farb. His thesis was titled Algebra versus Topology in Mapping Class Groups. Margalit was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Utah from 2003 to 2008. He was a faculty member at Tufts University from 2008 to 2010, before moving to the Georgia Institute of Technology. Margalit is known for his work in exposition of geometric group theory, particularly his book with Benson Farb, A Primer on Mapping Class Groups. ==Awards and honors== Margalit became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2019; he was recognized \"for contributions to low-dimensional topology and geometric group theory, exposition, and mentoring.\" Margalit was a 2009 Sloan Research Fellow. ==Selected publications== Books *Reviews of A Primer on Mapping Class Groups * * * * Translations * == References == Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:Tufts University faculty Category:Georgia Tech faculty Category:Brown University alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:Sloan Research Fellows Category:Topologists Category:Group theorists ",
