    "text": "Darby Pop Publishing is an American comic book publishing company founded in 2013 by multiple Emmy Award-winning writer/producer Jeff Kline (Transformers: Prime, G.I. Renegades, Jackie Chan Adventures) as an outlet for high-concept, high-quality visual storytelling. Kline recruited talent from a small circle of friends \u2014 writers and artists with whom he'd worked in both live-action and animation \u2014 by asking: \u201cHave you ever had an idea you were convinced would make a killer comic book?\u201d Darby Pop began as IDW\u2019s first creator-owned imprint. Sixteen original series and 100+ issues/TPs have been published to date. Creators have included Eric Garcia (City: The Mind in the Machine), John Raffo (The 7th Sword), Scott Marder/Rob Rosell/Jack Lambert (Doberman), Matthew Federman & Stephen Scaia (Dead Squad), and Kline himself (Indestructible). In July 2015, Darby Pop partnered with Magnetic Press and released Side-Kicked by Russell Brettholtz, Dead Man's Party by Jeff Marsick, Fake Empire by Eric Palicki, The Living Finger by Garth Matthams, and Sweet Lullaby by A.J. Scherkenbach. In October 2015, Darby Pop announced a collaboration with Bruce Lee Entertainment to produce Bruce Lee: The Dragon Rises, which chronicles the return of the beloved actor, philosopher, teacher, and \u2014 of course \u2014 martial artist in a present-day, all-ages comedy/action/adventure. In January 2018, Darby Pop announced another collaboration with Bruce Lee Entertainment: Bruce Lee: The Walk of the Dragon by Nicole Dubuc (Star Wars: Rebels, My Little Pony, Transformers: Rescue Bots). In 2017, Darby Pop Publishing went independent and over the next two years released Things You Shouldn't Remember by Luis Roldan, Bastard's Waltz by Mark Bertolini, Santa Claus: Private Eye by Jeremy Bernstein, and Frank N. Stein: Private Eye by Keith Champagne. ==Titles== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Series !! Release Date !! Writers!! Illustrators!!

City follows Ben Fischer, who helped build the world\u2019s most advanced surveillance system, \"Golden Shield\", which utilizes every camera, cell phone, and computer in San Francisco to battle crime. Unfortunately, Golden Shield operates in black and white, unable to prioritize threats or distinguish true danger amidst a sea of false alarms. In other words, the program can't properly function without a human mind to operate it. Against his will, Ben Fischer is chosen to be that \u201cmind\u201d, resulting in a controversial melding of man and machine. ===The 7th Sword=== The 7th Sword was created by John Raffo (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story).

Dead Squad was created by Matt Federman and Stephen Scaia (Jericho, Warehouse 13). ===Indestructible: Stingray=== It\u2019s tough enough being a mutant teenager, but imagine the challenges when you're also surrounded by role models driven wholly by power, money, fame, and antagonism.

Each of the five professional killers who participate have 30 days to collect the bounty on your head, adding your distinguished name to his or her resume. And the \"contract\" is wholly irrevocable. For the world's most feared executioner \u2013 known only as Ghost \u2013 arranging such a Party for himself is a last resort, a way to go out on his own terms and at the top of his game. ===Fake Empire=== Created by Eric Palicki. Fairies have always existed in secret, without a kingdom of their own, living side-by-side with humankind. But when one of his own children is murdered, King Oberon asks his surviving daughters \u2013 newly minted NYPD detective Charli and wingless black sheep Lucy \u2013 to find her killer amidst the citizenry of New York. As Charli and Lucy delve deeper into the mystery, they begin to discover the extraordinary measures their father has taken \u2013 some clever, some desperate \u2013 to keep an entire people hidden in an increasingly treacherous world. For Charlie and Lucy, unmasking their sister\u2019s executioner will mean confronting their own blood- drenched legacy. ===Bruce Lee: The Dragon Rises=== Bruce Lee never died. And he hasn't aged.

He names the digit \u201cWendy,\u201d learns to communicate with it via \u201ctap code,\u201d and discovers that the one thing Wendy wants more than anything else is a living, breathing human body to attach to. But, as soon as Jason helps Wendy secure an unwitting \u201chost,\u201d problems arise. Soon, Jason has collected a bathtub full of corpses, a rightly suspicious sister, and a best friend hellbent on selling Wendy to the highest bidder. Even worse, Jason is beginning to realize that he may have acted a bit rashly, especially with Wendy proudly displaying an unhealthy fascination with knives. Is there any way for Jason to set things right without becoming another casualty? ===Women of Darby Pop=== The Women of Darby Pop is a specially-priced, double-sized floppy collecting short stories written and drawn by the winners of Darby Pop Publishing\u2019s second \u201cBreaking Into Comics\u201d contest.
