    "text": "Leva Patel (Leuva Patidar) is a caste or community in India, situated mainly in Gujarat. They claim mythical descent from Lav, the son of Ram. They make varying claims to Kshatriya and Vaishya varna status. == Origin and Migration == Leva Patels originated from the Kheda district of Gujarat as Shudra Kanbis Quote: \"For instance, in western Maharashtra the Rigvedic Deshastha Brahmans are genetically closer to the local Shudra Kunbi castes than to the Chitpavan Konkanastha Brahmans (Karve and Malhotra 1968).\". There are a variety of popular legends regarding their origin, such as being migrants from Punjab, migrants fleeing the Kushans, migrants from Ayodhya, or descending from Hunas, Gujars, or Kurmis. However, these legends are of dubious reliability, and are an example of the invention of tradition. In the 19th and 20th centuries, many Leva Patels have immigrated to other countries, like South Africa, the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Within India, they have migrated from Gujarat to other states, like Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh. ==References== === Bibliography === * * Category:Indian castes ",
