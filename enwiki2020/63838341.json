He died in Poil Habili in modern-day Habiganj Sadar, where a dargah was built around his grave. This dargah also hosts the graves of Syed Nazirul Haq, Syed Abdul Haq and Syed Jahidul Haq. In 1989, the walls and dome of the dargah became quite damaged and so a refurbishment took place. ==References== Category:People from Habiganj Sadar Upazila Category:Bengali writers Category:Persian-language writers Category:Indian male writers Category:Indian Muslims Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ",
