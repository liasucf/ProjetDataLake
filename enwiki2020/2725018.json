    "text": "Jimmie Johnson, the 2006 Nextel Cup Series champion. This was the first of his five consecutive titles. Matt Kenseth finished second behind Johnson by 56 points. Denny Hamlin finished third in the championship and also won Rookie of the Year. The 2006 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series was the 58th season of professional Stock car racing in the United States and the 35th modern-era NASCAR Cup series season. It was started at Daytona International Speedway on Sunday, February 12 with the Budweiser Shootout and ended on Monday, November 20, with the Ford 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. The Chase for the Nextel Cup began with the Sylvania 300 on Sunday, September 17, at New Hampshire International Speedway. Tony Stewart, driver of the No. 20 Chevrolet for Joe Gibbs Racing, was the defending series champion, but lost out in defending his championship this year, having finished outside of the top 10 in the points standings after the Chevy Rock and Roll 400. He did, however, claim a $1 million (US) bonus as the best finisher outside the Chase for the Nextel Cup drivers, winning three of the ten Chase races. By the end of the season Chevrolet had captured 23 victories, and 270 points to win the NASCAR Manufacturers' Championship over Ford. The 2006 season was the first for Ford's all-new Fusion, which replaced the Taurus both in NASCAR and in showrooms. Also, a new version of the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, called the Monte Carlo Super Sport (SS for short) debuted on the circuit. Additionally, 2006 was the first Cup Series season since 1979 without Rusty Wallace and 1974 without Ricky Rudd, although Rudd made one appearance in relief and would return for one final year in 2007 before retiring. It was also the last season before Toyota joined NASCAR Cup Series as a manufacturer. ==Teams and drivers== ===Complete schedule=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- !Car(s) !Team ! !Driver(s) !Crew Chief |- ! rowspan=28 | Chevrolet | rowspan=2 | Dale Earnhardt, Inc. | 1 | Martin Truex Jr. (R) | Kevin Manion |- | 8 | Dale Earnhardt Jr. | Tony Eury Jr. |- | rowspan=4|Furniture Row Racing | rowspan=4|78 | Kenny Wallace | rowspan=4|Joe Garone |- | Jimmy Spencer |- | Travis Kvapil |- | Max Papis |- | rowspan=2 |MB2 Motorsports Ginn Racing | 01 | Joe Nemechek | Ryan Pemberton |- | 14 | Sterling Marlin | Doug Randolph |- | Haas CNC Racing | 66 | Jeff Green | Harold Holly |- | rowspan=2 |Hall of Fame Racing | rowspan=2 |96 | Terry Labonte | rowspan=2 |Phillipe Lopez |- |Tony Raines |- | rowspan=4 | Hendrick Motorsports | 5 | Kyle Busch | Alan Gustafson |- | 24 | Jeff Gordon | Steve Letarte |- | 25 | Brian Vickers | Lance McGrew |- | 48 | Jimmie Johnson | Chad Knaus |- | rowspan=3 | Joe Gibbs Racing | 11 | Denny Hamlin (R) | Mike Ford |- | 18 | J.

After winning back-to-back Busch Series championships in 2004 and 2005, Martin Truex Jr. drove the No. 1 Chevrolet for Dale Earnhardt, Inc. (DEI). Vacated by Michael Waltrip, their No. 15 car was driven by rookie Paul Menard and ran a part-time schedule of only seven races. Waltrip left DEI to drive Bill Davis Racing's new No. 55 car, but ownership was transferred to the newly merged (with the old No. 77 team) Waltrip-Jasper Racing to ensure that Waltrip would compete in the first five races. Despite the change, the No. 55 still received most of its equipment and crew from BDR. On January 23 in Charlotte, North Carolina, as part of the annual Media Tour, NASCAR announced that the Toyota Camry would be added to the series in 2007, meaning that Toyota would become the first non-American car manufacturer to run in the premier series since Jaguar in the mid-1950s. Waltrip-Jasper Racing and BDR became two of the first Toyota teams, although they raced Dodges. They did so without Dodge's support because BDR had raced Toyotas in the Craftsman Truck Series. The team hired Dave Blaney to take the wheel of the No. 22 Dodge. A third Toyota team, carrying the No. 83, was owned by Red Bull Energy Drink, with Brian Vickers as the driver. It was believed that they would also buy the No. 7 Jim Smith-owned team driven by Robby Gordon. 1988 series champion Bill Elliott attempted three races for Red Bull in a Dodge, as the 2006 Camry was not approved for racing. He didn't make any starts in the ride, nor did former Champ Car driver A. J. Allmendinger. With Blaney's departure, the No. 07 Chevy for Richard Childress Racing was driven by Clint Bowyer. 2004 Nextel Cup champion Kurt Busch, who was taken over by in Roush Racing's, replaced a retired Rusty Wallace in the No. 2 Dodge for Penske Racing. 2003 Rookie of the Year Jamie McMurray replaced Busch to drive Roush's No.26 (formerly 97) Ford. In addition, Mark Martin continued his \"Salute to You\" tour for their No.6 car. With the egressing of both McMurray and Sterling Marlin from Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates, Casey Mears became the senior driver and moved to No. 42 Dodge and Reed Sorenson took over his ride in the No. 41. David Stremme replaced Marlin in the No. 40 car. Sold to resort magnate Bob Ginn during the season and formerly numbered 10, Marlin drove the No. 14 car for MB2 Motorsports and Scott Riggs took the No. 10 car to Evernham Motorsports just as they switched from Chevy to Dodge. Jeremy Mayfield and Elliott Sadler were released from Evernham Motorsports and Robert Yates Racing. Sadler drove Evernham's No. 19, and David Gilliland replaced him in RYR's No. 38 car; that change took effect for the GFS Marketplace 400. Jeff Green replaced Mike Bliss in the No. 66 (formerly No. 0) car, which left Petty Enterprises' No. 43 Dodge open for former Joe Gibbs Racing driver Bobby Labonte to step in. His new teammate/team owner Kyle Petty brought sponsorships from Wells Fargo, NTB, and Schwan's to the No. 45 car, with Schwan's moving from the No. 49. Competitive Edge Motorsports ceased operations, and Marathon Petroleum Company sponsored Kyle Petty. J. J. Yeley took over for Labonte in JGR's No. 18 Chevrolet. Denny Hamlin, after scoring three Top 10 finishes at the end of the previous season, raced full-time in their newly entered No. 11 car, and he claimed rookie of the year honors, two checkered flags (both at Pocono Raceway, the first rookie to sweep both races in a single season) and third in the Championship standings. Hall of Fame Racing started operations in 2006. Two-time Cup series champion Terry Labonte drove their No. 96 car for the first five races utilizing the past champions provisional rule, and Tony Raines took over at Martinsville. Labonte wound down his career \"Texas Style\" in the No. 44 Hendrick Motorsports second car following the Dickies 500 race in November in his home state at Texas Motor Speedway, where he finished 34th. Brent Sherman took over for Ken Schrader in the No. 49 Dodge for BAM Racing, only to be replaced by Kevin Lepage, who started the season in the No. 61 (formerly No. 66) car for Peak Fitness Racing. Bliss replaced Sherman in the No. 49 as well. Front Row Motorsports hired Chad Chaffin to run for Rookie of the Year and Randy LaJoie (who was replaced by Chad Blount) to run full-time in their No. 34/92 car as well as buying Peak Fitness Racing's No. 61, suspending the 92's operations. Schrader replaced Ricky Rudd in the Wood Brothers No. 21 Ford. Starting this season, Wood Brothers made a partnership with JTG Racing (a Busch Series and Truck Series at that time) to field the No. 21 entry and the team was renamed to Wood Brothers/JTG Racing. Scott Wimmer took Mike Wallace's place in Morgan- McClure Motorsports's No. 4 Chevrolet but departed when 2002 Daytona 500 champion Ward Burton took over for him late in the season after sitting on the sidelines. Travis Kvapil moved from the Jasper team to Chevrolet for PPI Motorsports. Furniture Row Racing announced it would run full-time with Kenny Wallace driving their No. 78 Chevrolet. ==Schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" |- ! No. ! Race Title ! Track !

Even though he was classified as a rookie, Hamlin had qualified by winning the pole position for the Checker Auto Parts 500 held November 13, 2005 in Phoenix. Hamlin drove in only 7 Nextel Cup races in 2005. ===Daytona 500=== * Complete Results ====Qualifying and Gatorade Duels==== Jeff Burton won the pole for the race with a speed of over 189 mph, and would start alongside Jeff Gordon in an all-Chevy front row. Gordon would win the second Gatorade Duel (his third career victory in a Daytona qualifying race) after Elliott Sadler won in race 1, which was delayed by showers. ====The race==== The weather dawned cloudy and cold for the 48th running of the \"Great American Race\", when Jeff Burton led the field to the green at 2:45 pm, which at the time was the latest scheduled start in the history of the race (the reason for this was that NBC chose it as its lead-in program to the primetime portion of its day's coverage of the Winter Olympic Games from Turin). There were several lead changes in the early part of the race going, with a race record of 32. The first caution flew on lap 18 when Martin Truex Jr. hit the wall. During this caution, Burton was passed by Elliott Sadler for the lead a lap later. The race restarted on lap 20 and 4 laps later, Jeff Gordon took the led away from Sadler. Carl Edwards, a popular \"dark horse candidate\" for the Nextel Cup championship, had his day end early, as he was involved in a five-car pileup on lap 80 that collected Dale Jarrett, Kyle Petty, Jeff Green, J. J. Yeley and Joe Nemechek. This was the biggest crash of the day, since the \"Big One\" never occurred. This would also bring out the third caution flag. Because of this, Edwards finished 43rd. Tony Stewart was a \"magnet for controversy\", tangling with Jeff Gordon on lap 48 and Matt Kenseth on lap 106. The first incident (which left debris on the track) brought out the second caution, which ended when the race restarted four laps later, and the second one would bring out the fifth caution. Stewart was penalized for aggressive driving after the incident with Kenseth, in which he blocked the No.17 car into the grass, causing it to spin and hit the wall in turn 3. Kenseth took matters into his own hands and was black flagged for hitting Stewart's car in retaliation on pit road. The three drivers involved in these two incidents would repair their cars and get back into contention. Kenseth at first failed to answer the black flag, which resulted in NASCAR no longer continuing to score the 17 car for 1 lap. Kenseth would make up the lost lap and catch up to lead lap traffic. Jimmie Johnson had one of the strongest cars all day. He took the lead with 10 laps to go just as the ninth caution flag came out for an crash involving Gordon, Kurt Busch, Jamie McMurray, and Sterling Marlin. This set up a 10-lap battle for the win. The race was extended into \"overtime\" when McMurray and Burton collided on lap 197, bringing out yet the 10th caution. The green-white-checker finish ended when Casey Mears and Ryan Newman battled for second, leaving Johnson to take the victory. The race ended under caution when Greg Biffle crashed in turn 4, just before Johnson crossed the line. The 48th running of the Daytona 500 was the first win for the No. 48 car on a restrictor plate track. This was also Johnson's 19th career win and his first during his streak of five consecutive NASCAR Sprint Cup Championships from 2006 to 2010. One surprise of this race was Kirk Shelmerdine, who finished 20th. He had barely qualified for the Daytona 500 and his independently owned No. 27 was fielded with a car that had a borrowed engine and donated tires, as well as a team with a volunteer pit crew. Top Ten Results: (Race distance extended to 203 laps/507.5 miles due to green-white-checkered rule.) # No. 48 Jimmie Johnson # No. 42 Casey Mears # No. 12 Ryan Newman # No. 38 Elliott Sadler # No. 20 Tony Stewart # No. 07 Clint Bowyer * # No. 25 Brian Vickers # No. 8 Dale Earnhardt Jr. # No. 21 Ken Schrader # No. 88 Dale Jarrett Failed to qualify: Scott Riggs (No. 10), Kenny Wallace (No. 78), Scott Wimmer (No. 4), Mike Skinner (No. 23), Derrike Cope (No. 74), Larry Gunselman (No. 52), Chad Blount (No. 37), Larry Foyt (No. 50), Andy Belmont (No. 59), Randy LaJoie (No. 64), Morgan Shepherd (No. 89), Chad Chaffin (No. 92), Carl Long (No. 80), Paul Menard (No. 15), Stanton Barrett (No. 95) ===Auto Club 500=== * Complete Results Body styles and engines were the story for the second race of the Nextel Cup season, the Auto Club 500 at California Speedway on February 26. Kurt Busch won the pole (187.086 mph) using a 2004 Dodge Intrepid-styled body, as opposed to the new Dodge Charger, which his Penske Racing team believed was aerodynamically superior. Bobby Labonte and the No. 43 team drove the Intrepid as well. Others, including Evernham Motorsports drivers Jeremy Mayfield and Kasey Kahne, drove the Charger. On race day, Greg Biffle dominated, leading 168 of the first 218 laps. Biffle won the previous year's spring race at California, finished second in the fall, and had won the Busch race the day before. Tony Stewart was the fastest Chevy in the early going. He overcame the car falling off the jack on a pit stop and an unscheduled stop for a flat tire to claw his way back among the leaders only to have an engine failure at lap 215, ending a string of 30 straight races without a DNF. Biffle continued up front until lap 226. He reported to the crew that his engine had lost a cylinder and a few laps later, he retired to the garage. This left Matt Kenseth to take the lead and only a late-race caution kept him from pulling away. Smoke and oil from the No. 4 car of Scott Wimmer brought out a yellow with three laps to go. Kenseth easily held off Jimmie Johnson in the green-white-checker finish to earn his 11th career win. Top ten results: (Race distance extended to 502 miles/251 laps due to green-white checkered rule.) # No. 17 Matt Kenseth # No. 48 Jimmie Johnson # No. 99 Carl Edwards # No. 9 Kasey Kahne # No. 31 Jeff Burton # No. 26 Jamie McMurray # No. 42 Casey Mears # No. 18 J. J. Yeley * # No. 6 Mark Martin # No. 5 Kyle Busch Failed to qualify: Travis Kvapil (No. 32), Hermie Sadler (No. 00), Derrike Cope (No. 74), Randy LaJoie (No. 34), Morgan Shepherd (No. 89) ===UAW-DaimlerChrysler 400=== * Complete Results After a week off, the Nextel Cup series returned to action at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on March 12, 2006 for the UAW-DaimlerChrysler 400. Greg Biffle clocked the fastest lap in qualifying at 172.403 mph. In the third consecutive race to require a green-white-checker finish, Jimmie Johnson blew past Matt Kenseth on the last corner of the day to get his 20th career victory and second of the season. Kenseth looked like a good bet to cruise to victory before Denny Hamlin and Kenny Wallace wrecked three laps from the end, bunching the field and leading to the overtime finish. Before the lap 268 restart, Kenseth told his crew that his engine felt weak, but he was able to protect the lead until the last corner, where Johnson, who had not led all day, overtook the 17 car on the high side to take the win by a half a car length. This was the first time that a green-white-checkered finish occurred in the first three races of the season. Top Ten Results: (Race distance extended to 270 laps/405 miles due to green-white-checkered rule.) # No. 48 Jimmie Johnson # No. 17 Matt Kenseth # No. 5 Kyle Busch # No. 9 Kasey Kahne # No. 24 Jeff Gordon # No. 6 Mark Martin # No. 31 Jeff Burton # No. 16 Greg Biffle # No. 42 Casey Mears # No. 11 Denny Hamlin * Failed to qualify: Stanton Barrett (No. 95), Hermie Sadler (No. 00), Brandon Ash (No. 02), Mike Skinner (No. 37), Morgan Shepherd (No. 89), Randy LaJoie (No. 92) ===Golden Corral 500=== * Complete Results There were no extra laps in race four of the Nextel Cup season, the Golden Corral 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway, but there was an extra day, as rain showers forced the green flag to be moved to Monday, March 20 at 11 am Television coverage moved to cable's FX channel for the race (with some exceptions). Kasey Kahne sat on the pole with a speed of 192.553 mph, edging Ryan Newman by .002 seconds. Bill Lester qualified 19th in the No. 23 Dodge Charger, becoming the first African-American to start a NASCAR Nextel Cup race since 1986. He finished 38th, six laps down. Last year's Atlanta winner, Carl Edwards eliminated himself from contention early. He damaged the front end of the 99 car after hitting Dave Blaney on pit road on lap 45 during a caution to address the stopped car of Kyle Busch. Bobby Labonte ran in the top 10 for the first 50 laps before his engine failed on lap 55. Another scary incident took place on pit road during the sixth caution of the day (laps 189\u2013197), when Reed Sorenson hit John Slusher, catch can man for Robby Gordon's crew, as he pulled out of his pit stall. Slusher was attached to a backboard but was treated at the infield care center. Several rookies had good days at Atlanta. Paul Menard and Reed Sorenson finished in the top ten, and Denny Hamlin led 16 laps. He was forced to make an unscheduled pit stop because of a loose condition, and finished 31st. On the track, the 9 car was near the front all day. Kahne took the lead from Greg Biffle with 79 laps to go. Despite a charge from Mark Martin, Kahne was not seriously challenged down the stretch and visited victory lane for the second time in his career. Kahne was the first driver to win from the pole since Matt Kenseth in the 2005 Sharpie 500.

Qualifying was cancelled on March 24 due to snow, sleet and rain, and the field was set with top 35 owners points from 2005, the Champion's Provisional (for Terry Labonte) and seven others, based on qualifying attempts in 2006. As a result, 2005 champion Tony Stewart sat on pole. The race featured 18 cautions, and over 100 of the 500 laps were run under the yellow flag. Points leader Jimmie Johnson made contact with the car of Reed Sorenson which caused a flat tire and put the 48 car multiple laps down. He finished 30th. Lap 188 saw the most notable wreck of the first half of the race, as Clint Bowyer spun Dave Blaney, causing a chain reaction that collected David Stremme, Brian Vickers and Michael Waltrip and brought out a red flag to clean up. Jeff Gordon spun Martin Truex Jr. out on lap 415 in an incident that collected Jeff Burton, Robby Gordon and J. J. Yeley. Kurt Busch, who had made up two laps lost earlier in the day due to tire problems, used the \"bump-and- run\" to nudge Matt Kenseth out of the lead with four laps to go. Jeff Gordon used the same tactic to take third, but on the final lap, Kenseth used the bump and run to spin Gordon out as Busch raced to victory. Gordon finished 21st and was involved in a shoving match with Kenseth. The win was Busch's fifth in 11 career races at the Tennessee track and the fifteenth in his career. It was Dodge's first win at Bristol since Richard Petty in 1975.

Brandon Whitt * \u2013 Denotes rookie. ==Rookies== *Clint Bowyer, No. 07 Chevrolet (Richard Childress Racing) *Denny Hamlin, No. 11 Chevrolet (Joe Gibbs Racing) --winner of the Raybestos Rookie of the Year award *David Stremme, No. 40 Dodge (Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates) *Martin Truex Jr., No. 1 Chevrolet (Dale Earnhardt, Inc.) *Brent Sherman, released from No. 49 Dodge (BAM Racing) *Reed Sorenson, No. 41 Dodge (Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates) *J. J. Yeley, No. 18 Chevrolet (Joe Gibbs Racing) The battle for ROTY was not expected to be fierce, as many predicted that two time Busch Series Champion Martin Truex Jr. would handily win the award, and possibly be a Chase contender. However, this was not to be as Joe Gibbs Racing driver Denny Hamlin shocked the NASCAR world the previous year by winning his first career pole at Phoenix while driving a part-time schedule. Hamlin again got everyone's attention by not only having won the Bud Shootout in his first attempt, but became the first rookie to sweep a racetrack (Pocono Raceway) since Jimmie Johnson accomplished that same feat at Dover. As Hamlin ran away with ROTY, his other competitors had up and down years. Although Clint Bowyer scored a surprising top-ten finish at Daytona, he was not a factor. Hamlin's teammate, J. J. Yeley struggled mightily. Ganassi rookie Reed Sorenson had an up and down year, scoring his first top five at Michigan but was plagued by bad breaks. David Stremme was constantly fighting to stay within the top 35 in owners points throughout the year, and Brent Sherman was released from his ride with BAM Racing 1/3 into the year. ==NASCAR Hall of Fame== Until March 6, 2006, NASCAR was without a recognized Hall of Fame. Charlotte, North Carolina, where most NASCAR teams are based near, was chosen as the location over six other candidates, which included Atlanta, Georgia; Talladega, Alabama; Kansas City, Kansas; Detroit, Michigan; Richmond, Virginia and Daytona Beach, Florida. The NASCAR Hall of Fame is located in the Charlotte Convention Center, and opened in 2010. Unlike other sports' halls of fame, which are run mainly by nonprofit organizations, NASCAR will own and operate its HOF directly. Winston Kelley, a longtime motorsports broadcaster and vice president of Duke Energy, a Charlotte-based electrical provider, was named the hall's executive director on June 29. ==Television== The 2006 season marked the final year of television contracts with Fox / FX / Speed and NBC / TNT. NBC aired the Daytona 500 to officially start the season on February 19, with Fox/FX picking up coverage the following week in California up to the Pepsi 400 July 1. For 2007, Fox and TNT began new eight-year contracts while ESPN / ABC joined in, taking over for NBC. ==See also== *2006 NASCAR Busch Series *2006 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series ==References== ==External links== * Racing Reference Category:NASCAR Cup Series seasons ",
