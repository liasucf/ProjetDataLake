    "text": "The following is a list of national meetings of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (SKJ). This article defines national meetings as party congresses and territorial conferences. The SKJ congress was the party's highest decision-making body. It convened 14 congresses before its dissolution, and ninth since taking power in 1945. According to the party rules, the party congress was to be convened by the SKJ Central Committee (CC) every fifth year. It functioned as a forum that approved party policy (such as the five- year plans), amended the party's charter and program, and elected the Central Committee. The party leadership, through the Political Report of the Central Committee, briefed the party on its work in the period since the last congress, and set out future goals for the period in between the next congress. ==Keys== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Abbreviations |- |CC |Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia |- |FM |Full member (a member with voting rights). |- |AM |Alternate member (a member without voting rights). |- |Political Report |Political Report to the Central Committee, a document which briefs delegates about the period since the last congress and future work. |- |PMR |Party members represented at the congress by delegates (the party membership at the time). |} ==Convocations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Congress ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Duration (start\u2014end) ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Delegates ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | Election ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Political Report (presented by) ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | PMR |- | CC | CAC | CCC | CSC |- | align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | 1st Congress 4 days 1919 election | 20 April \u2013 23 April 1919 | 432 | 31 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | None | 130,000 |- | align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | 2nd Congress 6 days 1920 election | 20 June \u2013 25 June 1920 | ?
