    "text": "Stadio Artemio Franchi is a multi-purpose stadium in Siena, Italy. It is currently used mostly for football matches and the home of A.C. Siena. The stadium was built in 1923 and holds 15,373. It is named after former Italian Football Federation president Artemio Franchi. In summer 2007, A.C. Siena agreed to rename the stadium into Stadio Artemio Franchi \u2013 Montepaschi Arena, to include the name of their main sponsor, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena. The stadium hosted its first and so far only international match on 17 October 2010, a 2-0 friendly win for Italy over South Africa. During March 2011, A.C. Siena announced plans to build a new stadium on the southern outskirts of the city at Isola d'Arbia. The new stadium, with a capacity of 20,000, features a revolutionary below ground design which was honored with an MIPIM AR Future Projects Award. ==References== Artemio Franchi Artemio Franchi Category:Multi- purpose stadiums in Italy Category:Buildings and structures in Siena Category:Sports venues in Tuscany Artemio Category:1923 establishments in Italy ",
