    "text": "{| |} USS Cleburne (APA-73) was a Gilliam-class attack transport that served with the US Navy during World War II. Commissioned late in the war, she was initially assigned to transport duties and consequently did not participate in combat operations. Cleburne was named after counties in Arkansas and Alabama. She was launched 27 September 1944 by Consolidated Steel at Wilmington, California, under a Maritime Commission contract; acquired by the Navy 21 December 1944; and commissioned the next day, Lieutenant Commander Frank T. Callahan in command. ==Operational history== ===World War II=== From 12 February 1945 to 10 June, Cleburne made two voyages from west coast ports to conduct training in the Hawaiian Islands, returning each time with passengers and hospital patients. She sailed from San Francisco 28 June to transfer troops in the western Pacific, calling at Eniwetok, Guam, Ulithi, Okinawa, ports in the Philippines, and Jinsen, Korea. During this time the war ended. ===After hostilities=== Cleburne arrived at Portland, Oregon, from the Far East 13 November. On 7 December she sailed to carry men to Shanghai and Tsingtao, China, returning to San Francisco 13 February 1946. ===Operation Crossroads=== Cleburne arrived at Pearl Harbor 1 March 1946, and there was decommissioned 7 June 1946. After use in Operation Crossroads, the atomic weapons tests at Bikini Atoll, she was towed to San Francisco and transferred to the Maritime Commission 7 July 1947. She was sold for scrap in June 1965. ==References== *Cleburne (APA-73), DANFS Online. *APA-73 Cleburne, Navsource Online.
