    "text": "Rainmeter is a free and open-source desktop customization utility for Windows, released under the GNU GPL v2 license. It allows users to create and display user-generated customizable desktop widgets or applets called \"skins\" that display information. Ready to use collections of skins can be downloaded and installed in packages known as \"suites\". Common functionalities of Rainmeter skins include desktop clocks, RSS readers, system monitors, weather widgets, application launchers, and audio players. == Development == The Rainmeter project was originally founded by Kimmo 'Rainy' Pekkola, the developer of Rainlendar, in 2001. == Usage == Rainmeter skins are written in Rainmeter code using a text editor and stored as INI configuration files. System resource values and other information such as weather or time are stored through \"meter\" values within a skin, which can then be customized. == Reception == CNET gave Rainmeter a 4 out of 5 star rating. It praised the software's flexibility, wide variety of themes and \"enthusiastic community\", while noting the program \"isn't as intuitive as it could be.\" Softpedia gave Rainmeter a 4 out of 5 star rating, citing its comprehensive tutorials and low system resource usage, while criticizing its lack of cross-platform support. == References == == External links == * Official website * Category:Utilities for Windows Category:Windows-only software Category:Widget engines Category:Free software ",
