He played college football at Lamar. ==Professional career== On December 8, 2016, it was announced that Langley accepted his invitation to play in the 2017 Senior Bowl. Throughout the week leading up to the Senior Bowl, Langley was impressive in practice and showed fluid movement and an ability to break quickly to the ball, but was unable to hang on to receptions during receiving drills. On January 27, 2017, Langley appeared in the 2017 Reese's Senior Bowl as part of Chicago Bears' head coach John Fox's North team. Langley recorded three combined tackles and intercepted Tulane quarterback Antonio Pipkin as the North lost 16\u201315 to the South. Langley was one of 60 collegiate defensive backs to attend the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. He completed all of the combine drills and finished first among all defensive backs in the bench press and tenth in the 40-yard dash. On March 23, 2017, Langley attended Lamar's pro day, but opted to stand on his combine numbers and only performed positional and coverage skills for team representatives and scouts from ten NFL teams. During the draft process, he had private visits and workouts with multiple teams, including the New England Patriots, Denver Broncos, New York Jets, Arizona Cardinals, Minnesota Vikings, and the Oakland Raiders. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Langley was projected to be a fourth to sixth round pick by NFL draft experts and analysts. Langley was ranked as the 24th best cornerback prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com. The Denver Broncos selected Langley in the third round with the 101st overall pick of the 2017 NFL Draft. Langley was the 18th cornerback selected in 2017, was the highest draft pick from Lamar since Tom Smiley in 1968, and was the first player drafted from Lamar in over 25 years (Tyrone Shavers, 1990 NFL Draft). He was also only the 19th player selected from Lamar and the fourth highest draft pick in school history. On May 11, 2017, the Denver Broncos signed Langley to a four-year, $3.17 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $706,288. Throughout training camp, Langley competed for the job as the fourth cornerback on the depth chart against Taurean Nixon and Lorenzo Doss. Head coach Vance Joseph named Langley the fourth cornerback on depth chart and for the Broncos' dime packages. He made his professional regular season debut during the Denver Broncos' season- opening 24\u201321 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers. On November 26, 2017, Langely recorded his first two career tackles in a 21\u201314 loss at the Oakland Raiders. Langley was inactive for three games (Weeks 14\u201316) after he was surpassed on the depth chart by rookie undrafted free agent Marcus Rios. He finished his rookie season in season with three solo tackles in 11 games and zero starts, while playing mostly on special teams. On September 1, 2018, Langley was waived by the Broncos and was signed to the practice squad the next day. He was promoted to the active roster on November 20, 2018. On March 18, 2019, it was announced that Langley would be converting from cornerback to wide receiver. He was waived on August 31, 2019. Langley was drafted in the 7th round during phase four in the 2020 XFL Draft as a cornerback by the Houston Roughnecks. ===Seattle Seahawks=== On January 1, 2020, Langley was signed to the Seattle Seahawks practice squad. His practice squad contract with the team expired on January 20, 2020. ==References== ==External links== *Lamar Cardinals bio Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Players of American football from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Sportspeople from Marietta, Georgia Category:American football cornerbacks Category:American football wide receivers Category:Georgia Bulldogs football players Category:Lamar Cardinals football players Category:Denver Broncos players Category:Seattle Seahawks players ",
