    "text": "Burn is the third studio album by American country music artist Jo Dee Messina, released in August 2000 by Curb Records. Her first No. 1 Billboard album on the Top Country Albums charts, it also hit No. 19 on the Billboard 200. \"That's the Way\" served as the album's lead-off single, spending four weeks at the top of the Billboard country music charts and becoming a major pop hit, peaking at #25. \"Closer\" was supposed to be the first single but was switched last minute (they filmed a video for it and it's included on her DVD video collection). Following it was the title track (previously recorded by Tina Arena on her album In Deep) which became a #2 hit on the country music charts and Top 20 hit on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks, it gave Messina her first entry on the latter charts. \"Downtime\" peaked at #5 on the country music charts, followed by another Number One in the Tim McGraw duet \"Bring on the Rain\". Finally, \"Dare to Dream\" peaked at #23 in mid-2002. The album has sold over one million copies and was certified Platinum. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Lisa Bevill - background vocals (tracks 8,10) *Mike Brignardello - bass guitar *Larry Byrom - acoustic guitar (tracks 1,4,5,8,9,10) *Steve Conn - accordion on \u201cThese Are the Days\u201d *Paul Franklin - dobro, steel guitar *Ralph Friedrichson - background vocals (track 9) *Byron Gallimore - 12-string electric guitar on \u201cThese Are the Days\u201d *Aubrey Haynie - fiddle, mandolin, octave fiddle on \u201cThese Are the Days\u201d *Kirk \u201cJelly Roll\u201d Johnson - harmonica on \u201cThese Are the Days\u201d *Michael Landau - electric guitar *B.
