The elections were required to be held no later than 26 November 2018, four years after the previous elections on 27 November 2014, but Prime Minister Kim Kielsen chose to call the elections seven months early. His Siumut party remained the largest in Parliament, but lost two seats, whilst Inuit Ataqatigiit, the second-largest party, lost three seats. The smaller Democrats and Partii Naleraq gained seats, with the newly formed Cooperation Party and Nunatta Qitornai parties both entering Parliament. ==Background== The 2014 general elections saw Siumut receive a narrow plurality of the vote, but win the same number of seats as Inuit Ataqatigiit (11). A coalition government was formed by Siumut, Democrats and Atassut which lasted until 2016, when Siumut formed a new coalition with Inuit Ataqatigiit and Partii Naleraq. Kim Kielsen from Siumut has led both governments. During the 2014\u20132018 parliamentary term, both Atassut MPs defected to Simumut, while Michael Rosing left the Democrats to sit as an Independent.Inatsisartunut ilaasortat Inatsisartunut ==Electoral system== The 31 members of Parliament are elected by proportional representation in multi-member constituencies.
