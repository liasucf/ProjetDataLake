Livingston, Charan Raj, Ilavarasu, Seetha, Saranya Ponvannan, Mayilsamy, Chitti Babu and Delhi Kumar playing supporting roles. The film had musical score by Sabesh- Murali and was released on 28 January 2005. ==Plot== Hussain Bhai (J. Livingston) and Sundaram Pillai (Charan Raj) were best friends in Ayodhyapuri near Nagercoil, a place where Hindus and Muslims lived in harmony. Hussain and Sundaram bought land to build a factory at that place. Hussain was married to Jameela (Saranya Ponvannan), while Sundaram married Seetha (Seetha) under Hussain and Jameela's blessings. Jameela and Seetha then became pregnant. Jameela, who had suffered a miscarriage, feared to lose her baby. In the meantime, Sabapathy (Manivannan), who was a troublemaker, turned the friends into enemies for his own personal gain. This issue was taken by the villagers, and the village split into two with Muslims on one side and Hindus on the other side. Later, Seetha and Jameela gave birth in the same hospital the same day. Fearing that Jameela's baby may die, Seetha switched the babies in their cradles, but Jameela knew about it. 25 years later, the conflict intensified between Hussain and Sundaram, and they are in a legal fight over the factory with Sabapathy continuing to add fuel to the conflict. Seetha and Jameela want their husbands to make peace. Hussain's son grows up as Shankar (Ramana) in Sundaram's house, whereas Sundaram's son grows up as Ameer (Mohankumar) in Hussain's house. Ameer falls in love with Shankar's cousin Anu (Rekha Unnikrishnan), while Shankar falls in love with Ameer's relative Zarina (Ragini Nandwani). Thereafter, Ameer and Shankar become friends and decide to support their love. Sabapathy, who pulled strings to create conflicts between Muslims and Hindus, is ultimately killed. The film ends with Hussain and Sundaram making up after their quarrel, the lovers brought together, and Muslims and Hindus making peace. ==Cast== *Mohankumar as Ameer *Ramana as Shankar *Rekha Unnikrishnan as Anu *Ragini Nandwani as Zarina *Manivannan as Sabapathy *J.

Jayaprakash explained, \"The title is suggestive of the trouble that takes place in the story. Ayodhya is a holy place and for those living in the village, there is no controversy or the location of the temple. For the outsiders only the trouble. All the unrest in this town is due to outsiders. So is the case with the village and the two lovebirds\". Newcomer Mohankumar, Ramana, Rekha Unnikrishnan, and newcomer Ragini Nandwani signed to play the lead roles. Sabesh-Murali had scored music for the film, and two of the songs were shot in Ireland. ==Soundtrack== The film score and the soundtrack were composed by film composer Sabesh-Murali. The soundtrack, released in 3 December 2004, features 6 tracks with lyrics written by Na. Muthukumar, P. Vijay and Kalaikumar. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:95%;\" ! Track !! Song !!

But the director has complicated the romances so much that even he is unable to close things off cleanly\" and added, \"Mohankumar lacks the talent, looks, physique and voice to be a leading man [...] Ramanaa fares better compared to him\". Sify said, \"Even though Jayaprakash sets out to make a movie on Hindu-Muslim amity to spread communal harmony, he ends up making a distasteful film\". The film bombed at the box office. ==References== Category:2005 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:2000s Tamil- language films Category:2005 romantic drama films Category:Indian romantic drama films Category:Films shot in Ireland Category:Films featuring an item number ",
