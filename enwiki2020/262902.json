    "text": "Patrick Frank Friesen (born 5 July 1946) is a Canadian author. He has written many works, from poetry to stage plays. He began his works in 1970, writing books of poetry. This Canadian poet, who was born in Steinbach, Manitoba, studied at the University of Manitoba. While there, he received a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) degree and a teaching certificate. After being a resident of Winnipeg for thirty years, Friesen now lives in Victoria, BC and is a teacher of creative writing at the University of Victoria. Friesen often collaborates with dancers, choreographers, composers and musicians. Along with writing poetry, he also writes songs for musicians and texts to Improv Piano. Friesen grew up in a small religious community, and comes from a Mennonite background, but he broke away from that small community physically and spiritually at a young age. His Mennonite upbringing still influences his work such as, \u201cThe Shunning,\u201d which is about the persecution of a Mennonite farmer questioning his religion. The winner of Manitoba Book of the Year for his work on \u201cBlasphemer\u2019s Wheel,\" Friesen was also the runner up in Milton Acorn\u2019s People\u2019s Poetry Awards. In a 2004 interview Friesen has noted that, \u201cBeing Mennonite in background had all kinds of effects on [his] content.\u201d In 1997, his work, \u201cA Broken Bowl,\u201d was short listed for the Governor General\u2019s Award. Friesen collaborated with Per Brask on the translation from Danish of Ulrikka S. Gernes' Frayed Opus for Strings & Wind Instruments, which has been shortlisted for the 2016 Griffin Poetry Prize. ==Bibliography== *The Lands I Am \u2013 1976 *Bluebottle \u2013 1978 *The Shunning \u2013 1980 *Unearthly Horses \u2013 1985 *Flicker and Hawk \u2013 1987 *You Don't Get to Be a Saint \u2013 1992 *Blashphemer's Wheel: Selected and New Poems \u2013 1994 *A Broken Bowl \u2013 1997 (nominated for a Governor General's Award) *St. Mary at Main \u2013 1998 *Carrying the Shadow \u2013 1999 (nominated for the Dorothy Livesay Poetry Prize) *The Breath You Take from the Lord \u2013 2002 (nominated for the Dorothy Livesay Poetry Prize)\\ *Bordello Poems \u2013 2004 *Interim: Essays and Mediations \u2013 2005 *Earth's Crude Gravities \u2013 2007 *jumping in the asylum - 2011 *a dark boat - 2012 *a short history of crazy bone - 2015 *songen - 2018 ==Audio== *Blue Door \u2013 1997 (with Marilyn Lerner) *Small Rooms \u2013 2003 (with Marilyn Lerner) *Calling the Dog Home \u2013 2005 (with Marilyn Lerner) ==Anthologies== *An Anthology of Prairie Poetry \u2013 1981 (Draft) *Ride Off Any Horizon \u2013 1983 *Visions and Reality \u2013 1985 *Pieces of the Jigsaw: A Multicultural Anthology for Young Readers \u2013 1986 *Why I am a Mennonite \u2013 1988 *Section Lines: A Manitoba Anthology \u2013 1986 *A Labour of Love \u2013 1989 *A/long Prairie Lines: An Anthology of Long Prairie Poems \u2013 1989 *Liars and Rascals, anthology of Mennonite short stories \u2013 1989 *Prairie Fire: New Mennonite Writing \u2013 1989 *Mennonite/s Writing in Canada \u2013 1990 *The Perfect Piece, Monologues from Canadian Plays \u2013 1990 *Inscriptions, A Prairie Poetry Anthology \u2013 1992 *Let the Earth Take Note, First Anthology of the National Milton Acorn Festival from 1987 to 1991 \u2013 1994 *Poetry and Knowing, essays \u2013 1995 *Our Fathers, Poetry and Prose, by daughters and sons from the prairies \u2013 1995 *Instant Applause, Volume II, Thirty Very Short Complete Plays \u2013 1996 *Passeport: La Po\u00e9sie Moderne de Langue Anglaise au Canada \u2013 1998 *Following the Plough: Recovering the Rural \u2013 2000 *New Life in Dark Seas: Brick Books 25 \u2013 2000 *Mocambo Nights: Poetry From the Mocambo Reading Series \u2013 2001 *The New Long Line Anthology, 2nd Edition \u2013 2001 *15 Canadian Poets x 3 \u2013 2001 *Why I Sing the Blues' \u2013 2001 *Instant Applause: Twenty-nine Very Short Complete Plays \u2013 2004 ==Other works and collaborations== *The Shunning, the Play, staged in 1985 by Prairie Theatre Exchange in Winnipeg, in 1992 by Theatre & Co. in Kitchener, in 1992 by Trinity Theatre in Livonia, Michigan, in 1993 by MAUS Theatre in B.C., and in 1995 by Two Planks and a Passion in Nova Scotia. *Amanda, a short drama on CBC Radio Manitoba, 1986. *Anna, a dance/words collaboration with choreographer Stephanie Ballard, with guest artist Margie Gillis, performed in 1987 at the Gas Station Theatre in Winnipeg. *Noah, a multi-disciplinary collaboration, presented as a working piece in 1987 at Main Access Gallery, Winnipeg. *Singer, a docu-drama on Richard Manuel for CBC Radio Manitoba, 1989 (with Big Dave McLean). *The Shunning, a one-hour radio adaptation for CBC Radio Canada, 1990 (producer: John Juliani). *Second Birth, a short drama for CBC Radio Canada, 1991. *Handful of Rain, a multi- disciplinary collaboration with Dance Collective, and various artists, performed at Gas Station Theatre, Winnipeg, April 1991. *The Raft, an original play, performed January 1992 at Prairie Theatre Exchange in Winnipeg, in February 1995 by Theatre & Co. in Kitchener. *The Raft, adapted for CBC Radio Canada, by Nancy Trites Botkin (producer: Kathleen Flaherty), 1997. *Friday, 6:32 p.m., an original short play written for the Short Shots series, staged by the Manitoba Association of Playwrights, 1993. *Old Woman and the Bones, collaboration with composer Michael Matthews, the musical group Thira, and Primus Theatre, staged at the New Music Festival in Winnipeg in February 1993. *Madrugada (a longer version of Old Woman and the Bones), performed by Groundswell and Primus Theatre at the Franco-Manitoban Cultural Centre in Winnipeg, April 1995. *The Shunning, adapted, choreographed and performed by Motus O dance theatre at the Tarragon Theatre, Toronto, 13\u201317 Sept. 1995. * Broken Bowl (a segment from A Broken Bowl), created, performed with jazz pianist Marilyn Lerner, Sunstone Coffee, Winnipeg, 17 July 1996, at The Glass Slipper, Vancouver, 3 Oct 1996, four performances at the Atlantic Jazz Festival, Halifax, July 1997, and recorded by CBC Radio Manitoba, and called Blue Door (Producer: Andrea Ratuski), 1996. * Voice, a radio documentary (featuring Big Dave McLean and Tracey Dahl), by CBC Radio Manitoba (Producer: Andrea Ratuski), 1996. ==Film== *Esther Warkov: A Spy in the House;
