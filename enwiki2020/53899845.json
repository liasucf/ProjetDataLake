    "text": "Market Square Shopping Centre is a mall located in downtown Kitchener, Ontario, whose tenancy skews to services. ==History== Built between 1971 and 1973 on the grounds of the original Kitchener City Hall in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. It was home to an Eaton's (opened in 1973 and later became a Sears Canada retail store), and home to the Kitchener Farmer's Market from 1973 to 2004. A glass clock tower at the corner of King and Frederick Streets pays homage to the former city hall clock tower, which is now located at Victoria Park, Kitchener. ==Decline== The mall has since declined, through the 1990s (with a half empty food court with long time McDonald's leaving in 2015) as shoppers have fled to larger malls in Waterloo Region like Conestoga Mall in Waterloo or Fairview Park Mall or Cambridge Centre to the south. In January 2020, Conestoga College opened an campus in the building, occupying about of the centre's space. The other major tenants are triOS College and The Record, the latter of which occupies a former Sears Outlet store. Few retail stores remain in the mall, which is now primarily used as office space. Nordia Inc. operated a call centre on the uppermost floor of the former Eaton's until 2019. The mall has a multi-level indoor parking along Duke Street and a walkway across to Oxlea Tower (22 Frederick Street), a large office tower across Frederick Street. The mall is now owned by Europro Real Estate, which owns a number of buildings in the city's core. ==Tenants== * Grill Inn * Mr Wu's * Service Canada * triOS College * Laura Mae Lindo, MPP, constituency office * Conestoga College, campus for International Business, effective 2020 ==Transit Connections== Grand River Transit has a number of routes that have stops around the complex: Bus Routes * Route 1 Queen\u2013River via stop on Frederick Street * Route 3 Ottawa South via stop on Frederick Street * Route 4 Glasgow via stop on Frederick Street * Route 7 King via stops on King Street * Route 204 iXpress Highland\u2013Victoria via stops on Frederick Street Light Rail * ION light rail 301 at Frederick station ==References== Category:Shopping malls in Ontario Category:Buildings and structures in Kitchener, Ontario Category:Shopping malls established in 1973 ",
