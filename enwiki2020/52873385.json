It was built in 1936 as a Works Progress Administration funded project. The pool building is a roughly egg shaped, one-story Art Deco structure with a rectangular two-story entrance hall on the north. The building has two-toned brick walls and a concrete foundation. (includes 14 photographs from 1998) Friday, 5 October 2018 It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The Fayette City Park Swimming Pool is one of several above-ground swimming pools designed by architect Wesley Bintz between 1919 and the 1950s. Headquartered in Lansing, Michigan, Bintz patented his iconic \"Bintz Pool,\" which boasted efficiency and cost-effectiveness through the use of the \"ovoid\" shape and the above-ground design. While there were once about 135 \"Bintz\" swimming pools throughout the United States, today there are approximately 16 still standing, with even fewer still operating as swimming pools. ==References== Category:Works Progress Administration in Missouri Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Missouri Category:Art Deco architecture in Missouri Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1936 Category:Buildings and structures in Howard County, Missouri Category:National Register of Historic Places in Howard County, Missouri ",
