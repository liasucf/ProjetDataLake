Only a short stretch of water separates it from the island of Inchcruin. The connection between Inchcruin and Inchmoan is very shallow, only a foot or two, and it is possible to wade between the islands.Worsley, Harry Loch Lomond: The Loch, the Lairds and the Legends Lindsay Publications (Glasgow) 1988 Inchmoan is known for its large sandy beaches, and is low lying, and marshy. Wilson, Rev. John The Gazetteer of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1882) Published by W. & A.K. Johnstone There are shingle beaches on either side of the island, meaning that on a sunny day, at least one is sheltered. For this reason and others, it is popular with campers and picnickers. The island was once owned by the Colquhouns of Luss, and now owned by Luss Estates. A large 2 storey ruin stands at the western point but no record exists of any occupants. The name of the island stems from its use by the Luss people as a source of Peat fuel for the village fires. The beaches and bays are sandy and comparatively safe for bathing but the interior is, in places, totally impassable due to the dense growth of rhododendrons, gorse and other spreading trees. Privately owned, 1 mile long, highest point about 30 ft. The island was used for peat fuel for nearby Lusshttp://www.loch- lomond.net/islands/inchmoan.html Loch Lomond net.Garnett, T. (1800).

V.1. p. 42. ==History== Ruined cottage on Inchmoan Stone Age tools have been found on Inchmoan, suggesting it has had an occasional human presence for a number of years. There is also the ruin of a cottage on the island. ==Flora== Despite its peaty name, Inchmoan has a wide variety of plant life, including pear, blueberry, alder, gorse, birch, rhododendron, Scots pine and bog myrtle. == References == ==External links== * https://web.archive.org/web/20090710015304/http://lochlomond-islands.com/ *article which mentions it Moan Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Scotland Category:Uninhabited islands of Argyll and Bute ",
