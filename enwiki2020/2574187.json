He is originally from Mugamba commune in Bururi Province. Nduwimana was nominated by President Pierre Nkurunziza on 29 August 2005. He was endorsed by both chambers of parliament (National Assembly - 108 votes 'for', one abstention and 47 votes 'for', 1 'against' in the Senate) and immediately sworn in. According to the constitution, Burundi's First Vice-President is responsible for political and administrative affairs. Nduwimana announced on 7 November 2007 that he had resigned as First Vice- President and that Nkurunziza had accepted his resignation.\"Burundi vice president resigns, is replaced amid growing tensions\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 8 November 2007.
