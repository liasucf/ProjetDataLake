    "text": "Water Street is a small unincorporated village in the Canoe Valley of Morris Township, part of Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, United States. The Frankstown Branch Juniata River runs north along the west foot of the Tussey Mountain ridge to the village, before turning east along U.S. Route 22, crossing the ridge line through a water gap. The intersection of U.S. Route 22 and PA Route 453 is located in the village. The community was so named on account of its status as a shipping point in the canal era and because the nearby Juniata River was used as a passage through Tussey Mountain at this location. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania Category:Unincorporated communities in Pennsylvania ",
