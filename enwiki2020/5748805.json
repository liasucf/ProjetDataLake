    "text": "Strabane Lifford Development Commission is a cross-border body in Ireland, to develop cultural and economic development ties between Strabane in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland and Lifford in County Donegal, Republic of Ireland, just across the border marked by the River Foyle. In June 2006 the Strabane Lifford Development Commission awarded a \u00a31.3m cross-border waterways restoration contract to Doran Consulting of Belfast. The project was launched by President of Ireland, Mary McAleese, in Lifford and involves the restoration of one and a half miles of the Strabane Canal and two locks to working order. Work is due to start on the Lough Foyle side of the canal in the summer of 2006. In 2000 a sculpture group was erected at the border between Strabane and Lifford, close to the Lifford Bridge by Strabane Lifford Development Commission. It had been created by Maurice Harron and consists of 5 figures (a fiddler, a flautist, a drummer and two dancers) each 4 metres high, made of stainless steel and bronze and symbolising Music and Dance, two unifying art forms, representing a shared beginning for both communities, North and South. ==References== *The Belfast Telegraph 26 June 2006. * Category:All-Ireland organisations Category:County Donegal Category:County Tyrone Category:Organisations based in Northern Ireland Category:Organisations based in the Republic of Ireland ",
