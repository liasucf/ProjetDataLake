    "text": "Margot R\u00f6mer (born 1938 in Caracas, Venezuela) was a leader of radical experimental art, a teacher and a professional pilot. Her artwork reflected topics involving domesticity and sensuality of the human body. She emphasized topics of the female body by using objects to create irony. R\u00f6mer had diverse knowledge in many mediums including silkscreen, pencil, oil painting, and sometimes assemblages or collages involving found objects. == Biography == Born October 7, 1938 in Caracas, Venezuela and died in 2005. R\u00f6mer used conceptual language and objects in her work to refer to the human body. In 1976, R\u00f6mer became part of a curatorial team for the Galeria de Arte Nacional in Caracas. She was a director of Sala Mendoza art foundation. In the 1970s, R\u00f6mer focused on incorporating messages about violence and corruption awareness within her art. During the late 1980s, she turned her focus on environmental and social issues. She was an educator and art historian who wrote about Venezuelan art and the culmination of installation art and conceptual art. R\u00f6mer participated in group exhibitions and events including 1973 XII S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial and the 1981 S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial. R\u00f6mer's earliest teachers were Armando Lira and Lucio Rivas where she learned the importance of color. Later studied under Crist\u00f3bal Rojas at the school of Plastic and Applied Arts from 1969 to 1971.It was in 1973 that she entered an Engraving workshop of Luisa Palacios in which R\u00f6mer learned about pop art concepts and figuration. In 1974, she began using discarded objects and painting them vibrant colors to give them a sense of alternate meaning. Margot R\u00f6mer is most known for her urinal and nationality works in which she paints them in multicolor, often colors of the Venezuelan flag and gives them a smooth organic appearance. In 1978, she began her work on flags and nationality at \"The International Drawing Triennial\" in Poland. She began teaching at the Salon d'Automne in Paris in the Metropolitan university until 1982. R\u00f6mer left for the United States in 1982, and exhibited artwork in \"Artists from the Continent\" in Virginia. She volunteered at Museum of Modern Art in New York in the cataloging and graphic work for the department in prints and illustrated books. She returned to Venezuela in 1984, where she started artworks featuring mountains covered in national flags.WIKIHistoria del arte Venezolano.06-15-2016.http://vereda.ula.ve/wiki_artevenezolano/index.php/R%C3%B6mer,_MargotMargot R\u00f6mer,\"The Urinal of Marcel Duchamp\"2005.https://interpretacionmargotromer.wordpress.com/ == Art Works == Aparato reproductor de la mujer (Woman's reproductive system) Made in 1972 with acrylic paint over a wooden door and cactus in a flower pot placed within the window of the door.

The painting is of a urinal inside a see through box wrapped in a bow like a gift. The idea behind this piece was to take an everyday object and give it new meaning. In recognition of the iconography of the artist Marcel Duchamp. The urinal is painting with black and white stripes externally. While the inside is a mixture of blue, red and magenta. This painting comes from Dadaist influences because of the emphasis on the unpredictable and absurd importance of wasted objects.Margot R\u00f6mer,\"The Urinal of Marcel Duchamp\"2005.https://interpretacionmargotromer.wordpress.com/ Corte esquem\u00e1tico del abdomen (Schematic cut of the abdomen)1970 This artwork was shown in Henrique Faria, New York.
