Among others, the gallery showed the work of Barbara Rae, Jock McFadyen, Eileen Lawrence and John Houston. From 1974 it was based at 29 Market Street, occupying the upper floor (while The Fruitmarket Gallery occupied the lower floor). Alexander Moffat was Chairman of the Gallery from 1968 until 1978. Gareth Fisher followed him as Chairman. In 1984, the Gallery merged with The Fruitmarket Gallery, which came to occupy the whole of the building under the directorship of Mark Francis. The archives of the 57 and New 57 Gallery are held at the National Galleries of Scotland. ==References== Category:1957 establishments in Scotland Category:1984 disestablishments in Scotland Category:Art galleries established in 1957 Category:Art galleries disestablished in 1984 Category:Art museums and galleries in Edinburgh Category:History of Edinburgh Category:Artist-run centres Category:Collections of the National Galleries of Scotland ",
