It is the last exit of the French motorway A40 before the border and is thus well connected with the other cities of the region. It is also connected to Annecy via motorway A41. Local transport is done with 6 bus lines by the TP2A company (Transports publics de l'Agglom\u00e9ration d'Annemasse). A tram is under construction to the Swiss border, scheduled to be open in 2016. Annemasse has had a railway station since 1880. It is the second most important station of the department with 2,000 passengers a day.

Annemasse also has a small airport for small tourist and business planes. ==Administration== Christian Dupessey, 2009 The urban area of Annemasse (consisting of six cities or \"communes\") is the second largest agglom\u00e9ration in Haute-Savoie.

In 1903, 350 years after the dissident Michael Servetus was executed in Geneva at the instigation of John Calvin, a committee was formed to erect a monument in Servetus' honour - led by a French Senator, Auguste Dide, an author of a book on heretics and revolutionaries. The committee commissioned a local Geneva sculptor, Clothilde Roch, to do a statue showing a suffering Servetus. The work was three years in the making and was finished in 1907. However, supporters of Calvin were still strong in Geneva, and the statue was rejected. The committee then offered the statue to the neighboring Annemasse, which in 1908 placed it in front of the city hall, with the following inscriptions: > \u201cThe arrest of Servetus in Geneva, where he did neither publish nor > dogmatize, hence he was not subject to its laws, has to be considered as a > barbaric act and an insult to the Right of Nations.\u201d Voltaire > \"I beg you, shorten please these deliberations. It is clear that Calvin for > his pleasure wishes to make me rot in this prison. The lice eat me alive. My > clothes are torn and I have nothing for a change, nor shirt, only a worn out > vest.\u201d Servetus, 1553 In 1942, the pro-Nazi Vichy Government took down the statue, as it was a celebration of freedom of conscience, and melted it. In 1960, having found the original molds, Annemasse had it recast and returned the statue to its previous place.pp. 313-316 ==International relations== ===Twin towns - sister cities=== * Gaggenau, Germany * Sieradz, Poland ===Friendship pacts=== * Boisbriand, Canada * Torricella Peligna, Italy ==See also== *Communes of the Haute-Savoie department *Annemasse Aerodrome ==References== ==Gallery== File:Flag of Annemasse.png|Annemasse flag Image:Arve Annemasse.jpg|Arve River near Annemasse File:Gare SNCF, Annemasse, France.jpg|Annemasse Railway Station, main entrance File:Annemasse gare.jpg|Annemasse Railway Station, platforms File:H\u00f4tel de Ville d'Annemasse, France.jpg|City Hall File:\u00c9glise Saint-Andr\u00e9, Annemasse.jpg|Saint-Andr\u00e9 church File:Annemasse s. joseph 2.JPG|Saint-Joseph church ==External links== * Annemasse Flag * Annemasse Official Web site * Annemasse in pictures Category:Communes of Haute-Savoie ",
