Several unnamed waterfalls continue upstream until reaching Duncan Falls, approximately 1 mile from the Upper Linton tier. Linton Falls has high sinuosity, frequent terraces, sloping terrains and is surrounded by thick forests, all of which makes it impossible to see in its entirety from a single view point. Past the Lower Linton Falls, the trek upstream is unmarked and mostly inaccessible. == See also == * List of waterfalls in Oregon == References == Category:Waterfalls of Lane County, Oregon Category:Parks in Lane County, Oregon ",
