The company produced recorded programs and sold them directly to local television stations. The television syndication service proved lucrative during the late 1940s and early 1950s, as local television stations wanted to fill their schedules during hours outside of \"prime time\". By 1955, Ziv was producing more than 250 half-hour TV episodes a year. As the Big Three television networks began offering programs outside of prime time, Ziv's popularity and business began to decline. The market for first-run syndicated television programming began to dwindle, and the company, to attempt to save its business, began to produce programs which aired over the networks in 1956. In 1960, the company was purchased by United Artists and merged with their television unit to become Ziv-United Artists, but two years later, the name changed back to United Artists Television after the TV studio phased out Ziv Television Programs' operations. Today, most of the rights to Ziv's TV shows are distributed by MGM Television, SFM Entertainment, and the Peter Rodgers Organization; while some of them have fallen into the public domain. ZIV International, on the other hand, was established as an unrelated production company and distributor of Americanized anime shows in the 1970s and 1980s. This company was linked to this former organization only by the similarity of its name. ==Selected list of shows produced or distributed== * Acapulco ZIV- UA, 1961, starring Ralph Taeger & James Coburn (a brief reworking of Klondike) * Bat Masterson ZIV-UA, 1958\u20131961, starring Gene Barry * Bold Venture ZIV, 1959\u20131960, starring Dane Clark and Joan Marshall (adapted from Ziv's 1950\u20131952 radio program starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall) * Boston Blackie ZIV, 1951\u20131953, starring Kent Taylor (adapted from Ziv's earlier radio version) * Dial 999 ZIV, 1958\u20131959, starring Robert Beatty (this was a co- production with Britain's ABC, not to be confused with the US ABC).
