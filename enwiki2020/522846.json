    "text": "A community meal in progress at a Sikh langar In Sikhism, a langar (, 'kitchen'),Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech, 2014, The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies is the community kitchen of a gurdwara, which serves meals free of charge to all visitors\u2014without making a distinction of religion, caste, gender, economic status or ethnicity. The meals are always vegetarian.William Owen Cole and Piara Singh Sambhi (1995), The Sikhs: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, , page 148 The exception to vegetarian langar is when Nihang Sikhs serve meat in some Gurdwaras, on the occasion of Holla Mohalla, and call it Mahaprasad.\"The most special occasion of the Chhauni is the festival of Diwali which is celebrated for ten days. This is the only Sikh shrine at Amritsar where Maha Prasad (meat) is served on special occasions in a Langar.\" The Sikh review, Volume 35, Issue 409 - Volume 36, Issue 420, Sikh Cultural Centre, 1988. People sit and eat together, and the kitchen is maintained and serviced by Sikh community volunteers. ==Etymology== The word langar has origins in the Punjabi language. ==Origins== The langar concept was an innovative charity and symbol of equality introduced by the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak around 1500 CE. The roots of such community kitchen institutions and volunteer run charitable feeding is very old in the Sikh traditions. The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim I Ching (7th-century CE) wrote about monasteries with such volunteer run kitchens. A related concept emerged from the practices of Fariduddin Ganjshakar, a Sufi saint living in the Punjab region during the 13th century, who would redistribute sweets his visitors would bring to his khalifas and common devotees. This concept developed, over time, into langar-khana near his shrine, a practice documented in Jawahir al- Faridi compiled in 1623 CE. According to Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair, a professor of Sikh Studies, community kitchens were already operating in Punjab when Guru Nanak founded Sikhism, and these were run by Muslim Sufi orders. However, Guru Nanak developed it as a part of the institutional framework that helped evolve the community free of any prejudices. Similarly, Hindu temples of the Gupta Empire era had attached kitchen and almshouse called Dharma-shala or Dharma- sattra to feed the travelers and poor for free, or whatever donation they may leave. These community kitchens and rest houses are evidenced in epigraphical evidence, and in some cases referred to as Satram (for example, Annasya Satram), Choultry or Chathram in parts of India.[a] ; [b] Sanctuaries of times past The Hindu (June 27, 2010) ==History== In Sikhism, the practice of the langar, or free kitchen, is believed to have been started by the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak. It was designed to uphold the principle of equality among all people, regardless of religion, caste, colour, creed, age, gender or social status. The second Guru of Sikhism, Guru Angad, is remembered in Sikh tradition for systematizing the institution of langar in all Sikh temple premises, where visitors from near and far could get a free simple meal in a simple and equal seating. He also set rules and training method for volunteers (sevadars) who operated the kitchen, placing emphasis on treating it as a place of rest and refuge, and being always polite and hospitable to all visitors. It was the third Guru, Amar Das, who established langar as a prominent institution, and required people to dine together irrespective of their caste and class. He encouraged the practice of langar, and made all those who visited him attend langar before they could speak to him. ==Contemporary practice== Langar is a practice which promotes the idea of equality. People sit together on the floor as equals with no discrimination of class, race or income to have a vegetarian meal served by volunteers. Anyone can volunteer in langar, regardless of whether or not they are Sikh adherents. Langars are held in gurdwaras all over the world, most of which attract homeless population. The volunteers feed them without any discrimination, along with the other devotees who gather. Almost all gurdwaras operate langars where local communities, sometimes consisting of hundreds or thousands of visitors, join together for a simple vegetarian meal. ==See also== * Bhog * Prasad (Hinduism) ==Notes and references== ==External links== * Category:Indian cuisine Category:Punjabi words and phrases Category:Sikh practices Category:Sikh terminology Category:Vegetarian dishes of India Category:Free meals Category:Punjabi cuisine ",
