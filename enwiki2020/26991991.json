The following Pilish poem (written by Joseph Shipley) matches the first 31 digits of \u03c0: :But a time I spent wandering in bloomy night; :Yon tower, tinkling chimewise, loftily opportune. :Out, up, and together came sudden to Sunday rite, :The one solemnly off to correct plenilune. A full-length Pilish novel has been published, which currently holds the record of the longest Pilish text with 10,000 digits. ==Rule sets== In order to deal with occurrences of the digit zero, the following rule set was introduced (referred to as Basic Pilish): :In Basic Pilish, each word of n letters represents ::(1) The digit n if n < 10 ::(2) The digit 0 if n = 10 Since long runs of small non-zero digits are difficult to deal with naturally (such as 1121 or 1111211), another rule set called Standard Pilish was introduced: :In Standard Pilish, each word of n letters represents ::(1) The digit n if n < 10 ::(2) The digit 0 if n = 10 ::(3) Two consecutive digits if n > 10 :::(for example, a 12-letter word, such as \"sleepwalking,\" represents the digits 1,2) ==See also== * Cadaeic Cadenza * Constrained writing ==References== ==External links== *Writing in Pilish *Pilish Checker *Accidental Pilish Category:Constrained writing Category:Pi ",
