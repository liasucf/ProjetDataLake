    "text": "SNC-80 is an opioid analgesic drug that selectively activates \u03bc\u2013\u03b4 opioid receptor heteromers and is used in scientific research. It was discovered in 1994. SNC-80 was the first non-peptide drug developed that was regarded as a highly selective agonist for the \u03b4-opioid receptor. It has been shown to produce useful analgesic, antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in animal studies, but its usefulness is limited by producing convulsions at high doses, and so SNC-80 is not used medically, although it is a useful drug in scientific research. == References == Category:Opioids Category:Delta-opioid agonists Category:Benzamides Category:Piperazines Category:Phenol ethers Category:Allyl compounds Category:Receptor heteromer ligands ",
