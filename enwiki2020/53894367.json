Sue Album Discography, accessed April 25, 2017Ray Bryant catalog, accessed April 25, 2017Enciclopedia del Jazz Ray Bryant discography, accessed April 26, 2017 == Reception == The Allmusic review stated \"This LP concentrates primarily on standards, although one pop song of the period (Bob Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\") is thrown in, along with a pair of Bryant's originals. The piano is in decent shape, though Bryant is fairly conservative in his approach to most of the tunes, resulting in a somewhat uninspired treatment of \"C Jam Blues\" and a funky but lackluster \"Love for Sale.\" ... The audience, for the most part, seems more interested in talking among themselves than realizing they are witnessing the making of a live recording\". == Track listing == All compositions by Ray Bryant except where noted # \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" (Cole Porter) \u2013 3:40 # \"C Jam Blues\" (Barney Bigard, Duke Ellington) \u2013 3:30 # \"Sister Suzie\" \u2013 4:36 # \"This Is All I Ask\" (Gordon Jenkins) \u2013 2:28 # \"Love for Sale\" (Porter) \u2013 4:26 # \"Blowin' in the Wind\" (Bob Dylan) \u2013 4:15 # \"Satin Doll\" (Ellington, Billy Strayhorn, Johnny Mercer) \u2013 4:40 # \"Days of Wine and Roses\" )Henry Mancini, Johnny Mercer) \u2013 4:07 # \"Blue Azurte\" (Wild Bill Davis) \u2013 2:20 # \"All the Young Ladies\" \u2013 3:17 == Personnel == *Ray Bryant \u2013 piano *Jimmy Rowser \u2013 bass *Ben Riley \u2013 drums == References == Category:1964 live albums Category:Ray Bryant live albums Category:Sue Records live albums Category:Albums recorded at Basin Street East ",
