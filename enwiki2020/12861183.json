    "text": "Haemanthus avasmontanus Dinter is a South African bulbous geophyte in the genus Haemanthus. It is known from the type specimens only, which were collected by Kurt Dinter on 12 February 1923 from a single locality in the Auasberge near Tigerfontein on steep, south-facing, mica schist ledges, south- east of Windhoek in central Namibia. (Snijman, 1984). Despite thorough searches by a number of field botanists, no plants have been found since. This species produces two erect, strap-shaped leaves annually, 350\u2013400 x 40\u201345 mm, smooth and soft-textured. The flowerstalk is 250\u2013350 mm long, with a brush- like flowerhead 45 mm in diameter; the acutely tipped spathe segments or valves are about as long as the flowers. Flowers 15\u201320, pure white; pedicels 7\u201310 mm long (Snijman, 1984). ==References== *The Genus Haemanthus: A Revision - Deidr\u00e9 Snijman (National Botanic Gardens of South Africa 1984) avasmontanus Category:Flora of Namibia Category:Plants described in 1923 ",
