    "text": "Belfast Lanyon Place (formerly Belfast Central) is a railway station serving the city of Belfast in Northern Ireland. It is one of the four stations located in Belfast City Centre, the others being Great Victoria Street, City Hospital and Botanic. Located on East Bridge Street, off of the Albert Bridge, in the city, Lanyon Place is the northern terminus of the cross border Enterprise service to Dublin Connolly, which runs every two hours. As well as this service, Lanyon Place is also served by Northern Ireland Railways, which operates routes to other locations in Northern Ireland, including Derry, Bangor, Portadown and Larne. ==Description== There are two island platforms at Lanyon Place, each serving two tracks, capable of accommodating trains up to nine coaches long on each side. Platform 1 is usually only used at peak hours, as well as for special services run by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland. Platform 2 is the Enterprise platform. Platform 3 is the 'southbound platform', normally used for trains to Great Victoria Street, Portadown, Lisburn and Newry, with Platform 4 being the 'northbound platform' for trains along the Derry, Larne and Bangor lines. Regular services also operate between Lanyon Place and the city's other main station, Great Victoria Street which is located nearer to Belfast's city centre. 2.6 million people used the station in 2017. ==History== The station was opened as \"Belfast Central\" on Monday 26 April 1976, despite it being located further from Belfast city centre than Great Victoria Street station. The first station manager was Mr John Johnston. By the 1990s, it became clear that the station's facilities were in need of upgrading. A major refurbishment programme started in 2000 and was completed in 2003. In February 2018, Translink announced that Belfast Central would undergo a face-lift. This would see the entrance hall and East Bridge Street fa\u00e7ade completely redesigned, with the removal of the blast wall. Inside, the ticket hall would be rebuilt and new retail and dining facilities provided. A Belfast Bikes dock will also be included in the redesigned station. As part of the redesign, Belfast Central was renamed Lanyon Place on 1 September 2018. This is despite the fact that, strictly speaking, the station is not located there but on East Bridge Street. It is expected that the Enterprise will move from Lanyon Place to the new transport hub at Great Victoria Street once that project is completed. ==Service== Main hall of Belfast Central (prior to refurbishment as Lanyon Place) Train departing from Lanyon Place NIR Class 3000 (C3K) train in Lanyon Place ===Newry\u2013Belfast\u2013Bangor line=== From Monday to Saturday, there is a half hourly service from Bangor to Portadown, with some trains continuing on to Newry.
