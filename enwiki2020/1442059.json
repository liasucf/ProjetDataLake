He is a member of the: * Council of State of the Portuguese Republic as the President of the Regional Government of Madeira * State Defense Council of the Portuguese Republic * State Internal Defense Superior Council of the Portuguese Republic * Homeland Security Superior Council of the Portuguese Republic.

Due to his resignation, early elections had to be scheduled, which he won easily. The national government, nevertheless, announced that the law wouldn't be changed.

On 14 February 2015 during the carnival of Madeira which Alberto usually participated, he wore a Greek traditional hat, he stated that it was to show his solidarity for the people of Greece and Syriza. He also warned that the new government of Madeira that will replace him should be strong and not bow to the government of Lisbon, because the people of Madeira want strong leadership because Madeira has been robbed by Lisbon for 5 and half centuries, therefore justifying the financial hole that occurred during the later part of his Presidency and if they fail to deliver Je suis un Syriza (I am a Syriza) (It has been speculated that this could mean he would make a comeback if Madeira needed him). No desfile de Carnaval Jardim disse que est\u00e1 solid\u00e1rio com o povo grego, in RTP Madeira On 29 March 2015 regional elections were held and Alberto ruled himself out as he had said he would in 2011, Miguel Albuquerque won the election and became the new president on 20 April 2015. == Family == In 1968 he married Maria \u00c2ngela Andrade Martins (born 1940) and had three children: * Cl\u00e1udia Sofia Martins Gon\u00e7alves Jardim (born August 24, 1970), married to David Gomes and mother of Maria Carlota Jardim Gomes (born 1998) * Pedro Alberto Martins Gon\u00e7alves Jardim (born January 8, 1972), single * Andreia Lu\u00edsa Martins Gon\u00e7alves Jardim (born 1975), married to Jos\u00e9 Miguel Monteiro de Resende Tropa (born 1975) and mother of Pedro Afonso Gon\u00e7alves Jardim de Resende Tropa (born 2005), Maria Pilar Gon\u00e7alves Jardim de Resende Tropa (n. 2013) and Jo\u00e3o Francisco Gon\u00e7alves Jardim de Resende Tropa (2013). ==Controversies== A controversial personality, Jardim is usually seen as an outspoken populist, who is infamous for his often outspoken remarks about his political opponents, from left to right, including several journalists. As Madeira's democratically elected political leader for over 30 years, he has many supporters who view him as a responsible and proactive governor, particularly well regarded in the Archipelago of Madeira proper. Despite his confrontational, explosive and sometimes impolite personality, Jardim has claimed many benefits and privileges for Madeira, helping the region to improve in several fields throughout the years it has been under his leadership. However, the European Union assistance to its ultra-peripheral regions, which includes the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira, has played a major role in the region's development; Madeira's development has been massively aided by structural and cohesion funds allocated by the European Union to the regional government.Portugal-En In addition, Jardim's government of the autonomous region was financially supported, decade across decade, by massive public debt creation and wild over-expenditure. Jardim sobre Silva Lopes: \"Esse senhor \u00e9 um incompetente\" , Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias (September 13, 2011) An even more surprising scandal was reported on 16 September 2011, when Portugal's central bank said Madeira island had under-reported its debt since 2004, putting further pressure on the country to meet deficit targets under an international bailout. An evaluation conducted by the Bank of Portugal of Madeira's accounts showed it failed to report EUR1.1 billion ($1.53 billion) in debt from 2008 to 2010 alone. The Bank of Portugal called the omission \"grave,\" adding it doesn't know of any similar cases in the rest of the country.Island spending increases Portuguese debt load, CBS Moneywatch.com from September 16, 2011 The debt was finally totaled at \u20ac6 billion, \u20ac3 billion less than the total that Alberto said mainland Portugal owed Madeira. His name has been often associated with FLAMA, the archipelago's defunct far-right separatist terrorist organization that undertook 70 bombings in Madeira between 1975 and 1978. Although no FLAMA activists were ever brought to justice, Alberto Jo\u00e3o Jardim has often supported their cause, stating that \"they should receive a reward not a punishment, since they're defenders of democracy and of the homeland\".Fundadores da FLAMA asseguram que o ressuscitar do movimento separatista s\u00f3 interessa a Jardim , in P\u00fablico (Portugal) ==Other affiliations== * He was a fan of C.S. Mar\u00edtimo, a sports club from Funchal. In 1997 he tried to join together the three biggest teams from Funchal in one unified and governmental team. Then the popular Mar\u00edtimo's supporters denied that intention in a big demonstration. After that he has been seen on the Nacional side.
