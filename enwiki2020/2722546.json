    "text": "Mirror Mirror is the first extended play by American hip hop duo Twiztid. It was released on April 9, 2002 through Psychopathic Records. Production was handled by Fritz \"The Cat\" Vankosky and both Twiztid members. It features guest appearances from Blaze Ya Dead Homie and Violent J. The album peaked at #103 on the Billboard 200 and at #5 on the Independent Albums in the United States. In AllMusic's review, Bradley Torreano wrote that \"Songs like 'CNT' are teenage anthems that actually have more than a passing similarity to the juggalos' hated foe, Eminem. [...] Despite the fact that few outside the juggalo community will give this a chance, this might be one of the most accurate portrayals of the mood of most unhappy young people in 2002\" and concluded that \"This is hard to recommend to anyone outside of that fan base, but to dedicated fans this is one of the best albums to ever spew forth from the Detroit label\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Jamie \"Madrox\" Spaniolo \u2013 vocals (tracks: 1-6, 8-11), producer, mixing & recording *Paul \"Monoxide\" Methric \u2013 vocals, producer, mixing & recording *Chris Rouleau \u2013 vocals (track 4) *Joseph Bruce \u2013 vocals (track 7) *Fritz Vankosky \u2013 producer ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" ! scope=\"col\" |Chart (2002) ! scope=\"col\" |Peak position |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2002 EPs Category:Twiztid albums Category:Horrorcore albums Category:Psychopathic Records EPs ",
