It was the first in a series of four novels about Dr. Duca Lamberti. An English translation by Howard Curtis was published in 2012. The book was the basis for the 1970 film Safety Catch directed by Yves Boisset. ==Reception== Kirkus Reviews wrote in 2014 that \"the first volume in Scerbanenco\u2019s Milano Quartet is a blast from the past, a sleek, stripped-down reminder of the fast, brutal days of Continental noir\". ==References== ==External links== * Italian publicity page * American publicity page * British publicity page Category:1966 novels Category:Italian crime novels Category:Italian mystery novels Category:Italian novels adapted into films Category:Italian-language literature Category:Novels by Giorgio Scerbanenco Category:Novels set in Milan Category:20th-century Italian novels ",
