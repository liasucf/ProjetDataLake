    "text": "Axelson Point is a small cape along the shore of the East Bay in Navarre, Florida. The point is named after the Axelson Family, one of the first families permanently residing in Navarre. The point only extends less than a hundred meters into the bay. However, the point is historically significant, not only due to it being the home of the previously mentioned Axelson family, but also due it being one of the first landing spots for exploration in the area. Some of the Pensacola homes of the original Axelson family still stand today; however, none of the homes on Axelson Point are from the original family. == References == Category:Headlands of Florida Category:Navarre, Florida ",
