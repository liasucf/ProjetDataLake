    "text": "Flag of the Communist Party of Costa Rica, outlawed by the article. The Article 98 of the Constitution of Costa Rica is the article that regulates free citizen association in political parties. The article was controversial for decades as, in its original writing, prohibited the existence of the Costa Rican Communist Party. Prohibition that was in place from the promulgation of the Constitution on November 8, 1949 until its reform on June 4, 1975. ==Text== The original text said: Which can be translated as: The 5698 bill of June 4, 1975 changed the text to: Or: A further reform on July 2, 1995 by the bill 7675 added: \"Los partidos pol\u00edticos expresar\u00e1n el pluralismo pol\u00edtico, concurrir\u00e1n a la formaci\u00f3n y manifestaci\u00f3n de la voluntad popular y ser\u00e1n instrumentos fundamentales para la participaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica. Su creaci\u00f3n y el ejercicio de su actividad ser\u00e1n libres dentro del respeto a la Constituci\u00f3n y la ley. Su estructura interna y funcionamiento deber\u00e1n ser democr\u00e1ticos [The political parties will express political pluralism, will attend the formation and manifestation of the popular will and will be fundamental instruments for political participation. Its creation and the exercise of its activity will be free within the respect of the Constitution and the law. Its internal structure and functioning must be democratic.]\" ==History== After the Costa Rican Civil War of 1948, the agreements of the Pact of the Mexican Embassy signed by the leaders of the enemy sides Jos\u00e9 Figueres Ferrer of the National Liberation Army and Manuel Mora Valverde of the Costa Rican Communist Party, established that would be respected the lives, freedoms and right to political participation of all sides. This was not kept and the new Junta government chaired by Figueres, the Founding Junta of the Second Republic immediately persecuted and imprisoned the communists and their party was banned. The first antecedent that the article had was the decree with the rank of law (since the Junta had suspended the Constitution of 1871 and enjoyed absolute powers) No. 1056 that expressly outlawed the People's Vanguard Party. During the fierce persecution, Vanguardia Popular continued to organize in hiding. Mora goes into exile while Arnoldo Ferreto Segura is elected secretary general while in prison. Subsequently, a general political amnesty would be granted for communists and Calderonistas in the administration of Mario Echandi that would normalize the policy and promote the transition to democracy, but although free, the communists would continue to be banned and their attempts to reorganize were stopped by the application of the article 98 in the elections of 1953, 1958, 1962 and 1966. As time passes, the system would tolerate the existence of political parties that were a clear screen of the old Popular Vanguard. The Socialist Action Party was founded in 1969, successfully electing Manuel Mora and Arnoldo Ferreto as deputies, and other leftist groups exist before 1975 although none was officially communist. The discussion about the right of the communists to participate in elections began to be discussed since the 1970 election when Figueres himself (who was a presidential nominee) advocated for it. Christian Democratic candidate Jorge Arturo Monge Zamora did the same in 1974. During the 1974-1978 legislature under the presidency of Daniel Oduber Quir\u00f3s, who sponsored the reform, the article was changed in 1975 to allow the communists to officially return to political life. ==References== Category:Constitutions of Costa Rica Category:Anti-communism ",
