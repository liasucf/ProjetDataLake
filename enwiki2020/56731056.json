    "text": "? is the second studio album by American rapper XXXTentacion and his last studio album to be released before his death. It was released on March 16, 2018, by Bad Vibes Forever, Caroline Distribution, and Capitol Music Group. It succeeds the release of his debut studio album 17 (2017) and the extended play A Ghetto Christmas Carol (2017). The album was primarily produced by frequent collaborator John Cunningham, and includes guest appearances from PnB Rock, Travis Barker, Joey Badass, and Matt Ox. Featuring more live instrumentation than 17, ? features an array of genres, including acoustic, emo, alternative rock, trap, and cloud rap. XXXTentacion's vocals on parts the album are less restrained and lo-fi-ish compared to 17, with his vocals on introspective songs over piano and acoustic guitar chords being more projected. On other parts of the album, XXXTentacion's style resembles his underground sound, with him screaming. ? received generally positive reviews from critics, and became XXXTentacion's first US number-one album, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with 131,000 album-equivalent units earned in its first week. The album has since been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was supported by three singles: \"Sad!\", \"Changes\", and \"Moonlight\". Following XXXTentacion's death on June 18, 2018, \"Sad!\" topped the Billboard Hot 100, where XXXTentacion became the first act to earn a posthumous Hot 100 number-one single as a lead artist since The Notorious B.I.G. with \"Mo Money Mo Problems\" in 1997. At the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, ? was nominated for Top Billboard 200 Album, among other nominations. An anniversary deluxe edition of the album was originally going to be released on July 26, 2019 but was pushed back to September 6, 2019, featuring the album's instrumentals, A Ghetto Christmas Carol, voice memos from the recording sessions of the album, and new material featuring American rapper Rico Nasty and Japanese video game composer Yoko Shimomura. ==Background== XXXTentacion released his debut studio album, 17 in August 2017 to commercial success. Following the release of the album, he announced he was quitting music due to negativity and backlash, though he eventually signed a $6 million one-album deal with Caroline Distribution and released A Ghetto Christmas Carol EP on his SoundCloud on December 11, 2017. After the release of A Ghetto Christmas Carol, XXXTentacion announced he was preparing three new albums and eventually announced the titles of the albums as Bad Vibes Forever, Skins, and ?, after being released on house arrest on December 23, 2017. The track listing and release date was confirmed by XXXTentacion on March 12, 2018 via social media. ==Composition== A contrast to 17, the album features an array of genres, including alternative rock, emo, trap, acoustic, and cloud rap. The song \"I Don't Even Speak Spanish lol\" has been labelled as reggaeton pop, while \"Infinity (888)\" is a classic hip hop song. XXXTentacion's vocals on parts the album are less restrained and lo-fi-ish compared to 17, with his vocals over piano and acoustic guitar chords being more projected. On other parts of the album, XXXTentacion's style resembles his underground sound pre-\"Look at Me\", with him portraying anger through screaming. The album also features sounds similar to the Soundcloud rap scene, as XXXTentacion mumble raps over less serious themes. ==Promotion== The cover art was first shown on XXXTentacion's Instagram story on January 28, 2018, with the caption \"coming soon\". Later that day, he explained that: > \"This albums not about the words, it's about the feeling...it'll be very > hard to understand, but very easy to listen to...it's not what you're > expecting, even if you feel like you understand my music, be prepared to not > understand this music.\" XXXTentacion released the song \"Hope\" on his SoundCloud on February 21, 2018, dedicated to the survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. XXXTentacion later hosted a benefit show for the survivors on March 18, 2018 and offered condolences to the victims of the shooting. On February 25, 2018, after the release of \"Hope\", the rapper posted vague messages on social media accusing Canadian rapper Drake of threatening to murder him alongside crude photoshopped images of Drake. XXXTentacion proceeded to claim his accounts were hacked whilst there was speculation he was insulting the rapper for promotion of \"Sad!\" and \u201cChanges\u201d. ===Singles=== The lead singles \"Sad!\" and \"Changes\" were released March 2, 2018, for streaming and digital download. \"Sad!\" debuted at number 17, and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming XXXTentacion's first number-one song and his highest-charting single to date. XXXTentacion became the first act to earn a posthumous Hot 100 number-one single as a lead artist since The Notorious B.I.G. with \"Mo Money Mo Problems\" in 1997. \"Changes\" debuted at number 47 on the week beginning March 13, 2018, and peaked at number 18. The album's third single \"Moonlight\" was released posthumously to rhythmic radio on August 14, 2018. \"Moonlight\" peaked at 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 after XXXTentacion's murder. The Rico Nasty remix of \"#ProudCatOwner\" was released in August 2019 as a promotional single for the album's deluxe edition.https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip- hop/8527927/xxxtentacion-proudcatowner-remix-rico-nasty ==Critical reception== ? received mostly positive reviews from critics. In a positive review, online publication HotNewHipHop stated that \"Despite a sagging middle section, ? features some of X's most nuanced and impressive material to date\", adding that \"X's commitment to honoring his various influences is admirable, but it may have behooved him to spend a little bit more time on sequencing this artistic kaleidoscope.\" Sputnikmusic gave a negative review, saying that \"This exercise in granting credence to emotionally stunted, bad musicians is something that is truly stunning to bear witness to.\" XXL gave the album a positive review, and wrote \"The album sonically goes every which way\u2014a double- edge sword that can make for a dizzying, disjointed listen at times. Still, ? is X's most stimulating offering to date and with a little more focus on structure and cohesion, X's best work could very well be ahead of him.\" At the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, ? was nominated for Top Billboard 200 Album, among other nominations. ==Commercial performance== ? debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 131,000 album-equivalent units, with 20,000 pure album sales.
