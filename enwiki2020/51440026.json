    "text": "The Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna Batholith () is a group of plutons in the Chilean Coast Range of northern Chile. The plutons of the batholith formed (cooled) between the Early Jurassic and the Late Cretaceous (192\u201398 Ma). The magmas that formed the batholith originated in Earth's mantle and have not suffered any significant crustal contamination. A group of Early Cretaceous plutons were intruded syn-tectonically on the Atacama Fault. == Subdivision == Geologists Miguel Herv\u00e9 and Nicol\u00e1s Marinivic identify six major units. From the oldest to the youngest these are: * Barazate Unit (192-181 Ma) * Paranal Unit (ca. 170 Ma). This unit has the largest areal extent. It is composed of gabbronorite, gabbro, diorite, monzodiorite, monzogabbro and monzogabbronorite. * Ventarrones Unit (149-138 Ma) * Remiendos Unit (133-128 Ma) * Herradura Unit (108-98 Ma) == See also == * Coastal Batholith of Peru == References == Category:Batholiths of South America Category:Lithodemic units of Chile Category:Geology of Antofagasta Region Category:Geology of the Chilean Coast Range Category:Jurassic Chile Category:Cretaceous Chile Category:Jurassic magmatism Category:Cretaceous magmatism ",
