The older twin is a boy, Ramakrishna 'Ramky' (Allari Naresh) and the younger twin is a girl, Lakshmi 'Lucky' (Karthika Nair). Ramky is calm, seeking stability and focus while his sister Lucky is a streetwise tomboy who has grown up learning karate. The children grow up and Ramakrishna becomes an interior designer; content with a safe career and the approval of his family. Lakshmi grows up into a wild and headstrong young woman. Ramky falls in love with Shruthi (Monal Gajjar); another interior designer who works for a rival business. Shruti ends up working in Ramky's firm and after a series of incidents, returns his love, but his father declares he can only marry if he finds a husband for his sister first.

Ch Sushil Rao of The Times of India gave it 2.5/5 and stated that \"If you can enjoy the ridiculous, you will enjoy this. As far as performances are concerned, Naresh delivers quite well and Karthika's fights and dance are impressive. If you ignore some scenes that create confusion, it's an entertaining movie\". Great Andhra wrote: \"Not So Funny, Allari Naresh who has been struggling to get a hit for a very long time will have to wait longer\". 123Telugu wrote: \"On the whole, Brother of Bommali has the right mix of interesting story and some funny comedy. Complete first half, Naresh and Karthika\u2019s performance are huge plus points. On the flip side, if you do not mind seeing Brahmanandam\u2019s same old routine comedy and a predictable storyline, you can safely watch this film and would not be disappointed\" ==References== Category:2014 directorial debut films Category:Indian comedy films Category:Masala films Category:Telugu-language films Category:Indian films Category:2010s Telugu-language films ",
