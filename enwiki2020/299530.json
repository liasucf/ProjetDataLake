The school comprises a preparatory school, senior school and sixth form, as well as boarding provision for both boys and girls. The school is coeducational, and employs the \"Diamond Model\". The school is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, the IAPS, the AGBIS, and the AMDIS.

Situated on Ingrave Road, astride Middleton Hall Lane and Shenfield Road, the school is set in over of land in the centre of Brentwood. The current headmaster is Michael Bond. ==History== ===16th\u201318th century=== Brentwood School and the Martyr's Elm, 1847 The licence to found the school as The Grammar School of Antony Browne, Serjeant at the Law, in Brentwood was granted by Mary I to Sir Antony Browne on 5 July 1558 and the first schoolmaster, George Otway, was appointed on 28 July 1558. In 1568 the school moved to a purpose-built schoolroom, which is extant. The commemoration stone was laid by Browne's stepdaughter, Dorothy Huddleston, and her husband Edward, Browne himself having died in 1567.Historical Notes from Brentwood School, School Lists (AKA The Blue Book) The school room is beside the site of the execution of nineteen-year-old William Hunter, who was burned at the stake for denying the doctrine of transubstantiation. The Martyr's Elm grew, allegedly, on the spot of his immolation. It was Browne who, as a Justice of the Peace under Queen Mary, had sentenced Hunter. Some believe the school was founded as Browne's penance for Hunter's martyrdom when Queen Elizabeth I came to the throne; however, the school was already in operation under Mary's licence when Elizabeth succeeded. Although Browne had drawn up statutes for the school, they were never legally adopted and so were re-drawn in 1622 by his descendants and John Donne, Dean of St Paul's. ===19th century=== Brentwood School Combined Cadet Force (CCF) was founded in 1861 and so is one of the earliest CCFs in the country. ===20th century=== 300px 60 Old Brentwoods were killed on active service during the First World War and 173 during the Second World War. Their names are listed in the school chapel, and commemorated by the Memorial Hall for the first war and the pavilion for the second. The school was a direct grant grammar school from the 1960s until the abolition of the scheme in 1977. Brentwood was originally a boys' school, but the Governors made the decision to allow a small number of girls to enter the sixth form in 1974. By the early 1980s there were 23 girls in the sixth form. Initially based in Newnum House, the girls' school opened in 1988, admitting girls from ages 11 to 18. ===21st century=== In 2007, Brentwood School celebrated its 450th anniversary with a commemorative service in St Paul's Cathedral. The school's Combined Cadet Force (CCF) celebrated its 150th anniversary on 8 October 2011 by holding a special afternoon of events featuring a Guard of Honour by Lt General Brown CBE. The Royal British Legion Youth Band of Brentwood played at the start and end of the afternoon. In 2012, The Earl of Wessex visited the school to open the new sixth form centre, featuring a 400-seat auditorium, named The Wessex Auditorium in his honour. In 2016, work finished on a new academic centre in the heart of the School, named the Bean Academic Centre after former Headmaster Edwin Bean, quadrupling the size of the original library. ==Traditions== ===School motto=== The school has two mottoes: Virtue, learning and manners, derived from the school statutes of 1622, and Incipe, a Latin (lang-la|to begin) motto added in the 19th century. The school promotes Incipe as make a good start, especially to first year senior school pupils and in the preparatory school, which has a publication named after it. It is recognised, though, that Virtue, learning and manners is the official whole school motto. ===School arms=== The arms of Brentwood School are derived from those of the founder, Sir Antony Browne, and his wife. As part of the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the school's founding, a special variant of Sir Antony Browne's Coat of Arms was granted by the Honourable Sir George Rothe Bellew, Garter Principal King of Arms and Sir John Dunamace Heaton-Armstrong, Clarenceux King of Arms on 19 July 1957. A red border was added to the arms to distinguish them as the school's, as opposed to those of Browne.Christe-Murray, David. The Arms of Brentwood School. Middlesex; Hubners Ltd. ===Houses=== There are five-day houses, named North Town, South Town, East Town, West Town, and Weald, and two boarding houses, Mill Hill for girls and Hough House for boys. The boarding houses together make up a sixth house, School house. The school was entirely boarding until the 1940s, but as Brentwood grew into the large commuter town that it is today, demand for day education increased and the number of boarding houses was reduced accordingly. The boarding houses are home to c.60 pupils, many from countries such as Hong Kong, China, Russia, India, Germany, Italy and South Korea. Competitions in sport, music, drama, debating and other activities are held on a regular basis between the houses. Pupils' house membership can be determined by the style of their tie; yellow for North, red for South, light blue for East, dark blue for West and claret for Weald. The boarding boys wear a maroon tie with a double silver stripe and boarding girls wear green ties with a double silver stripe. ===Praepostors=== The school elects a group of sixth form students to become praepostors (praes) each year. These are usually students with academic or sporting strengths and those involved in the local community. Being appointed a praepostor means increased responsibility in the school. Praes return to school outside normal school hours to help organize and facilitate events, and they are the main representatives of the pupil body throughout the school. Senior praes are praepostors with a greater level of responsibility and are typically asked to contribute more. They are also expected to delegate work to other praes and students. The Head of School is elected by the staff. ==The school today== ===Academic=== The school is separated into three sections: the preparatory school (ages 3 to 11), the senior school (ages 11 to 16) and the sixth form (ages 16 to 18).

The senior school teaches pupils from the age of 11 until the end of GCSE courses at 16+. Many pupils move into the senior school from the preparatory school, but others are drawn from other local primary and preparatory schools; around 1/3 of pupils join the school from the maintained sector. Admission to the senior school is by entrance examination. In addition to core subjects (English, mathematics, sciences, MFL), pupils' GCSE and IGCSE options include computer science, drama, DT, food technology, geography, Greek, history, Latin, music, RS The sixth form is for pupils aged 1618 who are studying for 'A' levels and the International Baccalaureate.

Recent shows have included My Fair Lady and Habeas Corpus, Les Mis\u00e9rables and West Side Story and into the Woods also. Every year the school holds inter- house music and drama competitions, often with guest adjudicators. The school has a long musical tradition, and a close association with Brentwood (Roman Catholic) and Chelmsford (Anglican) cathedrals; a number of pupils and staff sing in the choir of each cathedral. The music department has 4 full-time teaching staff and 20 visiting teachers. In 1996, Brentwood was the first school in the country to use Sibelius software and ever since has been an integral part of the Music departments GCSE, A-level and IB music courses.

In the same year, a cantata The Old Red Wall, composed by the former Director of Music David Pickthall, was premiered at the 450th Anniversary Festival at the Brentwood Centre. The cantata was based on the school song The Old Red Wall and featured new text by David Dunn. ===Model United Nations=== Since 2013, Brentwood has hosted an annual Model United Nations (BMUN) conference.

Princess Anne visited the School in November 2012. ===RIBA Award=== In 2012, Brentwood School's sixth form centre was winner of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) East of England Award. The institute described the development as having drawn \"inspiration from the existing Victorian vicarage\" and that \"the new design is expressed in a language that is both contextual and contemporary. The sculpting of the roofs creates non-standard, domestic-scaled classrooms filled with natural light, reminiscent of the gabled roofs of the Victorian vicarage, but with an added measure of playfulness.\" ==Sexual abuse allegations== In 1997 Gareth Stafford-Bull, who taught fencing at the school (and was also an under-20s coach for the England fencing team), went missing and was sacked by the school in his absence following allegations that he had indecently assaulted pupils. The 41-year-old was later found dead in his car at Brighton. ==Notable former pupils== The official alumni logo for the Old Brentwoods community Old Brentwoods are those who have attended the school (preparatory, senior school or sixth form) for any length of time.

A crown was added to the logo in 1957 to celebrate The Queen's visit to the school. The colours of Old Brentwoods are dark blue, light blue and gold. Light blue and dark blue were traditionally featured as stripes on the blazers of Old Brentwoods and are still used today to represent the alumni community.
