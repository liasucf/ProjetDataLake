The bulletin first aired in 1996. Unlike all Nine News bulletins, the Gold Coast bulletin runs for thirty minutes every weeknight. It comprises mainly local news, as well as sport, weather and boating. Nine Gold Coast News is a regional news service for the Gold Coast, presented by Bruce Paige and Eva Milic, sport is presented by Michael Atkinson and weather is presented by Jayde Cotic. The bulletin airs at 5:30pm on weeknights as an opt-out broadcast on QTQ-9's Gold Coast transmitters, before the main 6pm Brisbane edition of Nine News. Produced from the network's studios at Surfers Paradise, Nine Gold Coast News is also simulcast on local Gold Coast radio station Juice107.3. ==Current presenters== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+Current presenters ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" |Role ! colspan=\"5\" scope=\"col\" |Bulletins |- ! scope=\"col\" |Monday ! scope=\"col\" |Tuesday ! scope=\"col\" |Wednesday ! scope=\"col\" |Thursday ! scope=\"col\" |Friday |- ! scope=\"row\" |News | colspan=\"5\" |Bruce Paige (2012\u2013present) Eva Milic (2018\u2013present) |- ! scope=\"row\" |Sport | colspan=\"5\" |Dominique Loudon (2017\u2013present) |- ! scope=\"row\" |Weather | colspan=\"5\" |Luke Bradnam (2013\u2013present) |- ! scope=\"row\" |Beach | colspan=\"5\" |Glen Rawlings (2016\u2013present) |} ==Past presenters== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !
