    "text": "Yaakov Yitzchak HaLevi Horowitz (), known as \"the Seer of Lublin\" (), ha- Chozeh MiLublin; c. 1745 - August 15, 1815) was a Hasidic rebbe from Poland. \"Rabbi Yaacov Yitzchak, the Chozeh of Lublin, is one of the truly beloved figures of Chassidism. He merited the title of Chozeh, which means seer or visionary ...\" A leading figure in the early Hasidic movement, he became known as the \"seer\" or \"visionary\" due to his purported ability to gaze across great distance by supernatural means. He was a disciple of the Maggid of Mezritch. He continued his studies under Shmelke of Nilkolsburg and Elimelech of Lizhensk. He lived for a while in Lantzut before moving to Lublin. After Horowitz moved to Lublin, thousands of Hasidim flocked to learn from him. Among his disciples were such Hasidic luminaries as Yaakov Yitzchak Rabinowicz (\"the Holy Jew\"), Simcha Bunim of Peshischa, Meir of Apta, David of Lelov, Moshe Teitelbaum, Tzvi Elimelech of Dinov, Naftali Zvi of Ropshitz, and Shalom Rokeach of Belz. Horowitz also gained a reputation as a miracle-worker who could accomplish the tikkun, or repair of the soul, of those who sought his assistance and guidance. During his stay in Lublin, Horowitz was opposed by a prominent mitnaged rabbi, Azriel Horowitz. Horowitz was a descendant of Isaiah Horowitz, a prominent rabbi and mystic, and his maternal grandfather, Yaakov Koppel Likover, also a prominent rabbi and scholar, as well as a contemporary of the Ba'al Shem Tov. He was injured in a fall from a window on Simchat Torah night, following the ritual hakafos dancing, and died almost a year later on Tisha B'av'Codex Judaica' M.Kantor, p.261 from injuries relating to this fall. He is buried in the Old Jewish Cemetery, Lublin. ==Works== His writings are contained in four books: *Divrei Emet *Zot Zikaron *Zikaron Zot *Zikaron Tov In a compilation of these works, entitled Torat HaChozeh MiLublin, his commentaries are arranged alphabetically according to topics and according to the weekly Torah portion. ==References== * Category:1740s births Category:1815 deaths Category:Hasidic rebbes Category:History of Lublin ",
