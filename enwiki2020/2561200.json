    "text": "Above is a map which shows where the name Jack is most popular in green. Jack is a given name. Since the late 20th century, Jack has become one of the most common names for boys in many English-speaking countries. While Jack is now a proper name in its own right, in English, it was traditionally used as a diminutive form of John. It can also be used as a diminutive for: Jacob, Jason, Jonathan, Jan, Johann, Johannes, Joachim and sometimes for James, from its French form Jacques, from the Latin Jacobus. It is also used as a female given name (often a shortened version of Jacqueline or Jackie) and as a surname to a lesser extent. The word jack is also commonly used in other contexts in English for many occupations, objects and actions, linked to the use of the word as a metaphor for a common man. ==Origin== 'Jackie' has been used among men (Jackie Coogan, Jackie Cooper, and Jackie Gleason were all formally named John). This diminutive of Jack is thought by some to have hailed from the earlier Jackin (from the name Jankin). Alternatively, it may be derived from the name Jacques, the French form of the name James or Jacob. There is also a theory that it is Celtic in origin, meaning \"healthy, strong, full of vital energy\" (compare the Welsh word iach, \"health\"), from a putative Ancient British Yakkios. Whatever its origins, both the name and the word \"jack\" were long used as a term to refer to any man, especially of the common classes. ==Frequency== ===Given name=== Jack has become increasingly used as a formal, registered name, rather than a nickname, for boys in several English- speaking countries. It is now more popular in its own right than John, James and Jacob where it is originally derived from. In recent years, Jack has been the most common given name for baby boys in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, and has grown in popularity in the United States. Jack was also the most popular baby boy's name in Scotland from 1999\u20132002, again in 2006, and from 2008 to the present; where it continues to be the most popular boy's name. From 2003\u201305 and again in 2007, Jack was reduced to second place after Lewis took the #1 spot. Although the use of Jack as a formal given name is a recent phenomenon, John \u2013 from which Jack was often derived \u2013 was, along with William, the most frequent male name throughout the nineteenth century and in the first half of the twentieth century. Jack was included on lists of the most frequently used male baby names in the UK for 2003\u20132007. In 1994, Jack was the most popular name in London but was not among the 10 most popular in the preceding 970 years. A survey in December 2008 showed that Jack was the most popular name in the UK for the fourteenth consecutive year, since it overtook Thomas in 1994. In 2014, Jack was again the most popular name for baby boys in Ireland. In 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2013, Jack was the most common name given to boys in Australia. According to the United States Census of 1990, \"Jack\" is an uncommon American name, the given name for 0.315% of the male population and 0.001% of the female population.The male, female, and total populations of the United States in the 1990 census were 121,239,418; 127,470,455; and 248,709,873, respectively. Information from However, the frequency of Jack as a baby name has steadily increased from the 160\u2013170 rank prior to 1991 to a rank of 35 in 2006.Popular baby names Jock is a common diminutive of the name John in Scotland. ===Surname=== The occurrence of Jack as a surname is much less frequent than its use as a male forename. In 1990, in the United States, this surname is shared by about 0.007% of the population, though the geographical distribution of the surname has been broad since at least 1840, at which time there was a modest concentration of Jacks in Pennsylvania. Within the United Kingdom, the surname is considered almost exclusively Scottish.Retrieved 08\u201324\u201311 In the late-nineteenth century, the geographic distribution of Jacks in England was also broad, with concentration in North East England, Yorkshire and the Humber, and southern North West England. In 1891, the highest concentration of Jacks in the United Kingdom appeared in Scotland. ==Other uses in English== The name Jack is unusual in the English language for its frequent use as a noun or verb for many common objects and actions, and in many compound words and phrases. Examples include implements, such as a car jack, knucklebones (the game jacks), or the jack in bowls. The word is also used in other words and phrases such as: apple jack, hijack, jack of clubs (playing card), jack straw (scarecrow), jack tar (sailor), jack-in-the-box, jack-of-all-trades, jack o'lantern, jackdaw, jackhammer, jackknife, jackpot, lumberjack, union jack, etc. The history of the word is linked to the name being used as a by-name for a man. ==People with the given name== *Jack Abel (1927\u20131996), American comic book artist *Jack Abramoff (born 1959), American former lobbyist, businessman, movie producer, and writer, convicted of corruption *Jack Adams (disambiguation), multiple people *Jack Agazarian (1915\u20131945), British spy *Jack Aker, American former Major League Baseball pitcher *Jack Albertson (1907\u20131981), American actor *Jack Angel, American actor *Jack Arute, American former sportscaster *Jack Asher, English cinematographer *Jack Avery, American singer in boy band Why Don't We *Jack Barakat, lead guitarist for punk rock band All Time Low *Jack Benny, American comedian, vaudevillian, actor, and violinist *Jack Black, American actor *Jack Blott, All-American football center and place kicker *Jack Brabham, Australian racing driver *Jack Brickhouse, American sportscaster *Jack Brisco, American professional wrestler *Jack Bruce (1943\u20132014), Scottish musician, composer, and vocalist *Jack Buck, American sportscaster *Jack Cade, the leader of a popular revolt against the government of England in 1450 *Jack Bridger Chalker, British artist and teacher *Jack L.
