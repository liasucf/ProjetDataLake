Bucknell is a member of the Patriot League. Bucknell won the first Orange Bowl, 26\u20130, over the Miami Hurricanes on January 1, 1935. ==History== The Bucknell football team was established in 1883 after a group of students from Lafayette College journeyed west to play a group of students from the University at Lewisburg, as Bucknell University was then called. The Lewisburg students lost the game, 59\u20130, and did not play another game until 1887. In 1918, Bucknell had its first of its three undefeated seasons. On October 10, 1925, Bucknell played George Washington at home on the day that Christy Mathewson was buried in Lewisburg. In his honor, there was no cheering in the first quarter. In 1931 Clarke Hinkle led Bucknell to a 6\u20130\u20133 record. In 1960, the team won its first Lambert Cup. In 1989, the newly renovated Christy Mathewson\u2013Memorial Stadium was renamed in Mathewson's honor. In 1996, Bucknell won its first conference championship. Bucknell football celebrated its seventh-straight winning season in 2001. ===Classifications=== *1937: NCAA College Division *1938\u20131947: NCAA University Division *1948\u20131972: NCAA College Division *1973\u20131977: NCAA Division II *1978\u2013present: NCAA Division I\u2013AA/FCS ===Conference memberships=== *1881\u20131957: Independent *1958\u20131969: Middle Atlantic States Collegiate Athletic Corporation *1970\u20131972: Independent *1973\u20131977: Division II Independent *1978\u20131985: Division I\u2013AA Independent *1986\u2013present: Patriot League ==Individual award winners== ===College Football Hall of Fame=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Player !!
