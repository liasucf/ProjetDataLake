    "text": "Wiktor Wojtas, (born June 6, 1986) known as TaZ, is a Polish Counter-Strike player who was the in-game leader for Virtus.pro. He is one of the \"Golden Five\" group of Polish CS players who won many tournaments with a number of different esports teams. He has also played for AGAiN, Universal Soldiers, ESC Gaming, Frag eXecutors, Vitriolic, Wicked eSports, Meet Your Makers, and Pentagram G-Shock. Wojtas has been playing professionally since 2004. TaZ and Virtus.pro famously won EMS One Katowice 2014, which was the first major to be held in Poland. They defeated Ninjas in Pyjamas 2-0 in the grand final. Over the years, TaZ and co. would rack up many tournament wins, giving them the famous nickname of \"Virtus plow\", notoriously having the ability to chain rounds together against their opponents in a momentum-driven playstyle. TaZ is considered one of the greatest Polish players to play Counter-Strike, alongside NEO, pasha, Loord, and LUq. TaZ and Virtus.pro won ELeague Season 1 over fnatic in the finals on July 30, 2016, ending the slump Virtus pro had been in. This would be one of the final victories VP would enjoy, and the roster which had held together since late 2013 disbanded in early 2018. As of October 2016, TaZ has won $476,809, the largest single prize being $80,000 from winning ELeague Season 1. ==Tournament results== :Bold denotes a CS:GO Major ===Pentagram=== * 1st \u2014 2006 Cyberathlete Professional League Championship Finals ===PGS Gaming=== * 1st \u2014 World Cyber Games 2006 ===AGAiN=== * 1st \u2014 World Cyber Games 2009 ===Frag-Executors=== * 3rd \u2014 World Cyber Games 2010 ===PGS Gaming=== * 1st \u2014 World Cyber Games 2011 === Universal Soldiers === * 9th-12th \u2014 DreamHack Winter 2013 ===Virtus.pro=== * 1st \u2014 EMS One Katowice 2014 * 3\u20134th \u2014 DreamHack Winter 2014 * 3-4th \u2014 ESL One Katowice 2015 * 3-4th \u2014 ESL One Cologne 2015 * 5-8th \u2014 DreamHack Open Cluj-Napoca 2015 * 5-8th \u2014 Intel Extreme Masters Season X \u2013 World Championship * 5-8th \u2014 MLG Major Championship: Columbus * 3\u20134th \u2014 ESL One Cologne 2016 * 1st \u2014 ELeague Season 1 * 1st \u2014 DreamHack ZOWIE Open Bucharest 2016 * 3rd \u2014 WESG 2016 World Finals * 2nd \u2014 ELEAGUE Major 2017 * 1st \u2014 DreamHack Masters Las Vegas 2017 * 7-8th \u2014 Intel Extreme Masters Season XI - World Championship ==References== Category:1986 births Category:Polish esports players Category:Counter-Strike players Category:MeetYourMakers players Category:Virtus.pro players Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
