Muntashir wrote the Nazm in his diary at Dal Lake in Kashmir while thinking of his wife. The song was then forgotten for years until music composer Ankit Tiwari heard about it and insisted that he use it. Muntashir was hesitant to use it in films, but later submitted on the insistence of film director Mohit Suri. As Mohit Suri believed if produced properly the song would be a \"Historical\". According to Muntashir, \"Mohit told Mithoon to compose the music and it was beautiful. The credit has to go to Mithoon for bringing it to Mohit's notice.\" ==Pre-Release== The track registered over 4 million views through unofficial versions and remixes, even before the song's official release. Muntashir said, \u201bhe can't believe how much of an impact just two lines of the song have created.\u2019 ==Reception== India Today wrote that \"Phir Bhi Tumko Chaahunga\" is \"sung in the soulful voice of Arijit Singh\" and that it \"has romance written all over it.
