The agency was dissolved in 1994, and its responsibilities transferred to three institutions, the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, the Robert Koch Institute and the Federal Institute for Health Consumer Protection and Veterinary Medicine.Hans-Joachim Weise, Bundesgesundheitsamt \u2013 BGA; 100 Jahre Forschung f\u00fcr die Gesundheit, 1976 ==References== Category:German federal agencies Category:Medical and health organisations based in Berlin Category:1876 establishments in Germany ",
