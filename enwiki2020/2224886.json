This is the only species assigned to the genus Atelocynus. ==Other names== It has many names in the local languages where it is endemic, such as: cachorro-do-mato-de-orelha-curta in Portuguese, zorro de oreja corta in Spanish, nomensarixi in the Chiquitano language, and u\u00e1laca in Yucuna. Other names in Spanish are zorro ojizarco, zorro sabanero, zorro negro. ==Evolution and systematics== After the formation of the Isthmus of Panama in the latter part the Tertiary (about 2.5 million years ago in the Pliocene), canids migrated from North America to the southern continent as part of the Great American Interchange. The short-eared dog's ancestors adapted to life in tropical rainforests, developing the requisite morphological and anatomical features. Apart from its superficial resemblance to the bush dog, the short-eared dog seems not to be closely related to any fox-like or wolf-like canid.(R. Burton; International Wildlife Encyclopedia, 2002). It is one of the most unusual canids. Two subspecies of this canid are recognized: *A. m. microtis *A. m. sclateri ==Occurrence and environment== thumb|Rare sight of short-eared dog The short-eared dog can be found in the Amazon rainforest region of South America (in Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and possibly Venezuela). There is a single report of \"three slender, doglike animals\" of this species sighted in the Darien region of Panama in 1984 by German biologist Sigi Weisel and a native Embera nation Panamanian; this rare species' presence in Panama is possible because of \"the continuous mass of forest habitat that covers this region\". It lives in various parts of the rainforest environment, preferring areas with little human disturbance. It lives in both lowland forests known as Selva Amaz\u00f3nica and terra firme forest, as well as in swamp forest, stands of bamboo, and cloud forest. It is a solitary animal and prefers moving in trees away from human and other animal interactions. ==Appearance== Bundes-Pelzfachschule, Frankfurt/Main, Germany Short-eared dog skull The short-eared dog has short and slender limbs with short and rounded ears. It has a distinctive fox-like muzzle and bushy tail. It ranges from dark to reddish-grey, but can also be nearly navy blue, coffee brown, dark grey, or chestnut-grey to black, and the coat is short, with thick and bristly fur. Its paws are partly webbed, owing to its partly aquatic habitat. It moves with feline lightness unparalleled among the other canids. It has a somewhat narrow chest, with dark color variation on the thorax merging to brighter, more reddish tones on the abdominal side of the body. ==Diet== This wild dog is mainly a carnivore, with fish, insects, and small mammals making up the majority of its diet. An investigation led in Cocha Cashu Biological Station in Peru into the proportions of different kinds of food in this animal's diet produced the following results: fish 28%, insects 17%, small mammals 13%, various fruits 10%, birds 10%, crabs 10%, frogs 4%, reptiles 3%. ==Reproduction and behavior== This species has some unique behaviors not typical to other canids. Females of this species are about one- third larger than males. The excited male sprays a musk produced by the tail glands. It prefers a solitary lifestyle, in forest areas. It avoids humans in the natural environment. Agitated males raise the hairs on their backs.ebcc Lifespan and gestation period are unknown, although sexual maturity is reached at three years of age, which is relatively late compared to other canid species. ==Threats, survival, and ecological concerns== Feral dogs pose a prominent threat to the population of short-eared dogs, as they facilitate the spread of diseases such as canine distemper and rabies to the wild population. Humans also contribute to their extermination by degradation of the species' natural habitat and the destruction of tropical rainforests. Man\u00fa National Park, Madre de Dios, Peru ==Status of conservation== The short-eared dog is currently considered near threatened by IUCN. No comprehensive ecological and genetic research has been carried out on the species. ==References== ==Further reading== *M.R.P Leite Pitman and R.S.R. Williams.
