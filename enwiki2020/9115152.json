The house is built of local Cotswold stone, dating from the late 16th century onwards. In the early 18th century a 9-bay baroque fa\u00e7ade of some elegance was added by the squire, John Parsons III (1649-1722). Thomas White of Worcester and the Smiths of Warwick have been variously suggested as the architects. It is a Grade II* listed building. Kemerton Court is set in parkland and is surrounded by a farming estate of around . It is owned by conservationist Adrian Darby, president of Plantlife and former chairman of the RSPB. He is married to Lady Meriel Darby, daughter of the former Prime Minister, Alec Douglas-Home, 14th Earl of Home, who was a frequent visitor to the Court. ==History== The manor was granted by King Henry III to Sir Robert de Musgrove (or Mucegros) in 1240. Since that time, apart from the brief period 1918-1949, it has remained in the possession of his descendants and relatives, passing through the families of Musgrove, Beauchamp, Lygon of Madresfield, Parsons-Hopton and Darby. The current owner is 24th in direct descent from Sir Robert de Musgrove. A notable 15th century owner was John Beauchamp, 1st Baron Beauchamp of Powick, Lord High Treasurer of England. ==References== * Lees-Milne, J. (1985).
