He and his son Robert Reinstein, along with helpers John Ream and his son Fred J. Ream Sr., planted 30,000 trees, and constructed 19 ponds, marshes, and swamps during the early 1960s. His dedication to nature conservation went as far as cleaning the ponds out every year by draining them. Every time a pond was drained he would keep the fish inside his home. When the harsh winters reached their peak Victor and his two sons would gather up geese and ducks to keep them dry and healthy. After Reinstein's 1984 death, his widow, Julia Boyer Reinstein donated the reserve as per her husband's wishes from the Reinstein Estate to The State of New York, which assumed control of the property in 1986. The Dr. Victor Reinstein Woods Nature Preserve was officially dedicated on August 23, 1989. In 2007 the Environmental Education Center was completed and opened to the public. == Friends of Reinstein Nature Preserve, Inc. == Friends of Reinstein Nature Preserve, Inc. is a volunteer-led, nonprofit organization that supports the environmental education programs offered by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation at Reinstein Woods.
