    "text": "Guilherme 'Gui' Khury (born December 18, 2008, in Curitiba, Brazil) is a Brazilian skateboarder known for being the first person to land a 1080 (three full revolutions) on a vertical ramp. Khury also holds the record for being the youngest person ever to land a 900, which he landed at age 8, as well as for being the youngest person to compete at the X Games at the age of 10 years and 7 months. In 2020, he was officially awarded two Guinness World Records for being the Youngest X Games Athlete and for the first 1080 on a vertical ramp. ==Early life== Khury was born in Curitiba, Brazil in 2009. In 2011, his family moved to Carlsbad, California, when he was two years old. He started training at young age, being encouraged by his father. He started training at the YMCA in Encinitas, California, at the age of four. In 2015, the family moved back to Brazil, where his father built an indoor ramp for him to practice. He completed his first 540 at the age of 7. Three months later, he had landed his first 720 and became the youngest in the world to land it. ==Skateboarding highlights== ===900=== In 2017, at the age of 8, Khury became the youngest person in the world to land a 900, a 2\u00bd-revolution (900 degrees) aerial spin performed on a skateboard ramp. Tony Hawk popularized this move when he was the first to achieve this feat, in 1999. ===X Games=== Khury was invited to his first X Games at the 2019 X Games Summer Event in Minneapolis. By participating in the event, he became the youngest ever competitor at an X Games at the age of 10 years and 7 months, breaking the previous record set by Jagger Eaton seven years earlier. At the same time, he became the youngest athlete to land a 900 at an X Games. ===1080=== On May 8, 2020, at age 11, Khury became the first person to land a 1080 (three full revolutions) on a vertical ramp, breaking Tony Hawk\u2019s record 900 on a vertical ramp set in 1999. (Tom Schaar landed the first-ever 1080 at the age of 12 in 2012 on a mega ramp, which allows a skater to build up more momentum than on a standard vert ramp.) He achieved it in after 10 attempts. Khury performed the feat \u201cin an indoor skateboard training facility built at his home in Curitiba, Brazil, by Green Box,\u201d a Brazilian company. Khury\u2019s father, Ricardo Khury Filho, credited school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic with providing his son extra time and energy to practice the technique. Professional skateboarders Bob Burnquist and Tony Hawk called him to congratulate him on the accomplishment. ==Guinness World Records== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Record !! Feat !! Date !!
