Between 1934 and 1951, he undertook part-time architecture studies, before switching to town planning studies, while working as a draftsman at AGL, the Commonwealth Department of the Interior, Commonwealth Department of Works and Housing, and the Cumberland County Council. He was appointed senior lecturer in town planning at the University of Sydney in 1951. Harrison was a member of the Royal Australian Planning Institute committee which argued in a submission to the Senate Select Committee on the Development of Canberra in 1955 that the Griffin Plan for the national capital should be adopted. == Professional life in Canberra == The Menzies Government established the National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) in 1958, and in early 1959 appointed Harrison its first Chief Town Planner. From this position Harrison strongly advocated for development consistent with the Griffin Plan developed by Walter Burley Griffin. Harrison devised the 'Y plan', adopted by NCDC in 1967, which allowed for the expansion of Canberra consistent with the preservation of the open character of a city separated by bushland. In 1967 Harrison was appointed Senior Research Fellow at the Urban Research Unit at the Australian National University in Canberra. ANU Urban Research Unit colleague Pat Troy recalled one of Harrison's tools, in response to challenging planning proposals, was to apply the \"mother test\", \"Would my mother live in it?\". Fellow Urban Research Unit colleague Max Neutze described Harrison's influence there as \"pervasive\" with many theses and publications produced by staff and students there influenced by him. \"Peter believed strongly that large city centres were inefficient creations of speculative development,\" Neutze wrote. \"He always insisted that development should serve the needs of people, not just line the pockets of investors.\" The Papers of Peter Harrison are held at the National Library of Australia, Canberra. The suburb of Harrison, ACT, is named in his honour. He was awarded a life fellowship of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 1971, which he resigned in 1990 in protest at the RAIA ACT Chapter's position on Canberra's development. He was awarded life membership of the Royal Institute of Planning Australia in 1979. He was awarded an AM in 1980, which he returned in 1985 in protest against trends in Canberra's development. To the end he was a staunch advocate of the Griffin plan and intervened publicly to defend it. == Selected publications == * Post-war planning in the capital cities of the mainland states (Canberra: Metropolitan Research Trust, 1972). * Walter Burley Griffin, Landscape Architect (Canberra: National Library of Australia, 1995). == References == Category:1918 births Category:1990 deaths Category:University of Sydney faculty Category:Australian urban planners Category:Former Members of the Order of Australia ",
