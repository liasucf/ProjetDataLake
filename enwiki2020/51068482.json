    "text": "Armando Le\u00f3n Bejarano Valadez (April 11, 1916 \u2013 July 6, 2016) was a Mexican orthopedic surgeon, physician, politician, and member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He served as the Governor of Morelos from 1976 until 1982. Bejarano was born in Cuautla, Morelos, on April 11, 1916, to Jes\u00fas Bejarano Nu\u00f1ez and Carmen Marcia Valadez Lizarraga. He was the youngest of his brothers. Bajarano studied at the medical school of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) from 1933 to 1938 and received his degree on July 18, 1939, becoming a surgeon and midwife. He specialized in orthopedics and trauma. Bejaranos was the medical director of the Olympic Village during the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. Bejarano was appointed the PRI candidate for Governor of Morelos to succeed outgoing Governor Felipe Rivera Crespo. His candidacy proved controversial, as Bejarano had no political experience in Morelos at the time. Bejarano's friendship and connections with then-President of Mexico Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Portillo allowed him to jump from a position at the Office of Food and Beverages at the federal Secretariat of Health directly to the gubernatorial candidacy of Morelos state without opposition. Bejarano, a candidate for the governing PRI, was elected Governor and served in that office May 1976 until 1982. He was succeeded by Lauro Ortega Mart\u00ednez, a former President of PRI. Bejarano later served as a judge within the Morela state judiciary. Armando Le\u00f3n Bejarano died at his home in Cuernavaca, Morelos, on July 6, 2016, at the age of 100 due to old age. His survivors are his son and daughters Armando Berjarano Almada, Gloria Bejarano Almada and Mar\u00eda de Lourdes Bejarano Almada ==References== Category:1916 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Governors of Morelos Category:Mexican centenarians Category:Mexican surgeons Category:Institutional Revolutionary Party politicians Category:National Autonomous University of Mexico alumni Category:People from Cuernavaca Category:People from Cuautla Category:Politicians from Morelos Category:Mexican judges ",
