    "text": "Trinity Bay State High is a co-educational school with an enrolment in 2015 around 1650 students, across Year levels 7 to 12. The school draws from the surrounding \u201cthree M\u201d suburbs of Manoora, Manunda and Mooroobool in addition to populations in surrounding mortgage belt suburbs. Trinity Bay SHS continues to grow with students attracted by the excellent programs offered at the school. The student population reflects the multicultural nature of the greater city of Cairns and supports just over 100 students in an Intensive English Language program. Approximately 30% of students identify themselves as being indigenous, the majority of these being Torres Strait Islander. The current principal is Martin Woodcock. The school's motto was formerly \"Endeavour\", named after the ship on which Captain Cook sailed into Trinity Bay. This was also the name of an incentive scheme at the school, which encouraged the students to set themselves goals and endeavour to achieve them. The current motto is \"Academic, Innovative, Caring.\"Trinity Bay State High School website, http://trinitybayshs.eq.edu.au, Accessed 16 July 2014 == See also == * List of schools in Far North Queensland * Queensland state high schools ==External links== * Trinity Bay State High School website * Facebook page == References == Category:Educational institutions established in 1960 Category:Public high schools in Queensland Category:Schools in Cairns Category:1960 establishments in Australia ",
