He is primarily identified with the house music scene in San Francisco, California. Farina resides in Dallas, Texas, but DJs widely around the world. == Biography == Shortly after Mark befriended Derrick Carter in 1988 at a record store in Chicago, he developed an interest in House music. Mark experimented with a deeper style, dropping De La Soul, disco classics and other styles not being played in the main rooms of nightclubs. While exploring purist forms of House Music, Mark developed his trademark style, known as \"Mushroom Jazz\": acid jazz infused with the West Coast's jazzy, organic productions along with urban beats. Fans embraced Mark's downtempo style, and he started in 1992 a weekly Mushroom Jazz club night in San Francisco with Patty Ryan. In 3 years at the club, Farina and Mushroom Jazz established a following. When the club closed, Farina continued the tradition by releasing a series of CDs under the same name, Mushroom Jazz. Since then, Mark has been performing hundreds of shows worldwide each year. His House sets have been described as the jazzy side of Chicago House mixed San Francisco style. Some of his sets have been known to last up to 8 hours. Farina has been known to play two different rooms at the same party. URB, MUZIK and BPM Magazines have all had him on their Top DJs in the World lists. ==Discography (selected releases)== * Geograffiti EP (Great Lakes Audio) * Mushroom Jazz series ** Mushroom Jazz 8 (Innercise/MRI) ** Mushroom Jazz 7 (Innercise/MRI) ** Mushroom Jazz 6 (Om) ** Mushroom Jazz 5 (Om) ** Mushroom Jazz 4 (Om) ** Mushroom Jazz 3 (Om) ** Mushroom Jazz 2 (Om) ** Mushroom Jazz 1 (Om) * Fabric 40 (Fabric) * Live in Tokyo (Om) * House of OM (Om) * Sessions (MOS) * Seasons (Moonshine) * Imperial Dub (Imperial) * United DJs of America (DMC) * San Francisco Sessions (Om) * Connect (Om) * Live at Om w/Derrick Carter (Om) * Air Farina (Om) * Bes' Enatainment EP (Great Lakes Audio) == References == ==External links== *Website *Om Records biography *Early 1990s Mark Farina Mixtapes Category:1969 births Category:American DJs Category:Musicians from Chicago Category:DJs from Chicago Category:Living people Category:Club DJs Category:American house musicians Category:Musicians from the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Deep house musicians Category:Acid jazz musicians Category:Electronic dance music DJs ",
