    "text": "Edward Stephen Waitkus (September 4, 1919 \u2013 September 16, 1972) was a Lithuanian American first baseman in Major League Baseball who had an 11-year career (1941, 1946\u20131955). He played for the Chicago Cubs and Philadelphia Phillies in the National League and for the Baltimore Orioles of the American League. He was elected to the National League All-Star team twice (1948 and 1949). ==Early career== Waitkus, the son of Lithuanian immigrants, grew up in Boston and attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School and Boston College. He began his professional career in 1938 playing for the Worumbo Indians, a semi- professional team sponsored by Worumbo Woolen Mill in Lisbon Falls, Maine. As a rookie, he was known as \"the natural,\" which gave the title to the book loosely based on his life. He saw some of the bloodier fighting of World War II with the U.S. Army in the Philippines, and was awarded four Bronze Stars. Upon his return to baseball he quickly became a star for the Chicago Cubs. He also became a popular media figure, as he was well-educated and was fluent in Lithuanian, Polish, German, and French. Following the 1948 season, the Cubs traded Waitkus with Hank Borowy to the Philadelphia Phillies for Monk Dubiel and Dutch Leonard. ==Shooting== Just a few years into the start of what seemed a very promising career, Ruth Ann Steinhagen, an obsessed fan, shot Waitkus at Chicago's Edgewater Beach Hotel on June 14, 1949, in one of the earliest recognized cases of criminal stalking. Steinhagen had become infatuated with him when he was a Cub, but seeing him every day in-season may have kept her obsession in check. Once he was traded to the Phillies, Steinhagen's obsession grew to dangerous proportions. She checked into the hotel using the alias of a former high school classmate of his and left a note at the desk, asking him to come to her hotel room on an urgent matter. When he arrived in her room, she shot him with a .22 caliber rifle, the bullet barely missing his heart. She immediately called the desk to report the shooting and was found cradling his head in her lap. Waitkus was taken to the Illinois Masonic Hospital,Associated Press, \u201cEddie Waitkus, Major League Player, Shot,\u201d The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 15 June 1949, Volume LV, Number 247, page 1. where he nearly died several times on the operating table before the bullet was successfully removed. Steinhagen never stood trial but instead was briefly confined to a mental institution. ==Return to action== After being shot in Chicago, Waitkus did not play again in the 1949 season, in which he compiled a .306 batting average with 27 RBI and 41 runs scored in 54 games played. However Waitkus did return in uniform, although not to action, on August 19, 1949 for \"Eddie Waitkus Night\" at Shibe Park, at which he was feted by the Phillies and showered with gifts. Waitkus returned to play in the 1950 Philadelphia Phillies season as the leadoff hitter for the Whiz Kids team that won the 1950 National League pennant. Waitkus led the team in scoring with 102 runs.https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/PHI/1950.shtml Waitkus made his only post-season appearance in the 1950 World Series. After the 1950 season, Waitkus was named the Associated Press Comeback Player of the Year. ==Later life== Prior to the 1954 season, the Baltimore Orioles purchased Waitkus from the Philadelphia Phillies for $40,000 (). Released by the Orioles in 1955, he returned to the PhilliesPhillies sign Eddie Waitkus for the remainder of the season. After the 1955 baseball season was complete, the Phillies released Waitkus.Phillies release Waitkus, Lowrey; Sell Bob Kuzava Waitkus taught at Ted Williams' baseball camp before dying of esophageal cancer at age 53.Munich tragedy has happened before ==The Natural== Author Bernard Malamud may have woven the basic elements of the Waitkus story \u2014 including that some called Waitkus \"The Natural\" because of his natural swing \u2014 and other baseball legends (notably that of Joe Jackson) into The Natural. The book was published in 1952 and was made into a Hollywood film starring Robert Redford and Glenn Close released in 1984. However, it is unclear if Malamud was solely inspired by the shooting of Waitkus, or if he instead or also had borrowed from the life of Cubs shortstop Billy Jurges, who was shot by his ex-girlfriend in 1932 at the Chicago hotel in which they lived. ==References== ==External links== *Jack Bales,\"The Shootings of Billy Jurges and Eddie Waitkus\" *Baseball Library * Life And Times Of Eddie Waitkus * Category:1919 births Category:1972 deaths Category:American people of Lithuanian descent Category:American shooting survivors Category:Baltimore Orioles players Category:Baseball players from Massachusetts Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Deaths from esophageal cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in Massachusetts Category:Major League Baseball first basemen Category:National League All-Stars Category:Philadelphia Phillies players Category:Sportspeople from Cambridge, Massachusetts Category:Moline Plow Boys players Category:Tulsa Oilers (baseball) players Category:Los Angeles Angels (minor league) players ",
