This was the last time a non-NHL team would contest for the Cup \u2013 the WHL folded following the 1926 Finals leaving the Cup to be contested solely by NHL clubs thereafter. ==Paths to the Finals== The Cougars finished the 1925\u201326 WHL regular season in third place, but eventually upset the Edmonton Eskimos in the WHL championship by a combined score of 5\u20133 to reach the Stanley Cup Finals. Meanwhile, the Maroons finished the NHL regular season in second place. Montreal went on to beat the third seed Pittsburgh Pirates and then defeated the first place Ottawa Senators 2 goals to 1 in a two-game total goals series, thus capturing the Prince of Wales Trophy and the right to play Victoria for the Cup. ==Game summaries== All of the games in the 1926 Cup Final were played at the Montreal Forum. Aided by three future Hockey Hall of Famers, the Maroons ended up dominating the series. Goaltender Clint Benedict, who previously helped Ottawa in three Cup championships, recorded three shutouts. Rookie Nels Stewart scored 6 of Montreal's 10 overall goals in the 4 games. Punch Broadbent also recorded a goal for the Maroons. The Cougars' lone win came in game three, 3\u20132. Nels Stewart scored both goals in the fourth game to win the series. Stewart had given his stick to a fan after the playoff series against Ottawa. He asked for and retrieved the stick back from the fan prior to the fourth game. He then gave back the stick to the fan after game four. ==Stanley Cup engraving== The 1926 Stanley Cup was presented to Maroons captain Dunc Munro by the trophy's trustee William Foran, following the Maroons 2\u20130 win over the Cougars in game four.
