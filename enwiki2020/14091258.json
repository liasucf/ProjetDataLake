Chart Attack, October 1995. by Sean Plummer This group were early signees to the Sonic Unyon label. ==History== The band formed in 1994, calling themselves \"Sian\", which is a Hindi word meaning \"intelligent\" or \"bright,\" and it is a common surname in places where Hindi is spoken. They signed with the then-fledgling record label Sonic Unyon. The original members were singer and guitarist Sean Ramsay, bassist Jay Patterson, Ryan Ferguson on guitar and synthesizer, and drummer Matthew Durrant.\"How Hamilton's SIANSpheric Conquered an Unsure Future\".Noisey, by Cam Lindsay, Oct 26 2016 The following year, Somnium, their debut album, was released.\"Sianspheric \u2014 Somnium (Sonic Unyon SUNCD021, 1995, CD)\". Expos\u00e9, by Peter Thelen, 1997-02-01 The band has been compared to Slowdive, The Verve, and Boards of Canada. SIANspheric gigged frequently, mostly in Canada, through most of the late 1990s and early 2000, including a tour with Canadian shoegazers Southpacific in 2000. The band has also worked with Toshack Highway on a split album titled Magnetic Morning/Aspirin Age. A CD with ten tracks, Toshack Highway contributed the first five tracks, and SIANspheric did the remaining five. In 2000, the band broke up. Sianspheric reformed in Toronto in 2005, and put out a new 7\" single, \"I Wouldn't Expect You to Understand\". They followed this up with a DVD+CD release titled RGB, released on Sonic Unyon. The DVD contained live footage of the band recorded between 1997 and 2001, music videos, and short clips based on or featuring the band's music. The CD featured surround sound remastered versions of some of their long ambient pieces and fan-favourite songs, demos, and one previously unreleased song, \"D'Yer Wanna Be P. Kember?\".\"Sianspheric RGB\". AllMusic, Review by Ned Raggett As of 2006, SIANspheric band members were Ramsay, Patterson, Durrant and Locksley Taylor (additional guitars, backing vocals). All four members contribute to the band's ambient programming/sampling. In 2011, SIANspheric regrouped with members Ramsay, Patterson and Durrant and with Ryan Ferguson (a.k.a. Electroluminescent) returning to provide additional guitars and synthesizers. They began recording new material. Three songs from the album Somnium were used in the TV series \"La Femme Nikita\".
