The family's progenitors were the brothers John Spata and Sgouros Spata. It is possible that the name \"Spata\" is derived from the Latin and Greek spatha meaning \"long sword\",. which is found in Albanian as shpat\u00eb meaning \"sword\". In the first half of the 14th century, mercenaries, raiders and migrants known in Greek as \u0386\u03bb\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af (Albanoi or \"Albanians\") flooded into Greece (specifically raiding Thessaly in 1325 and 1334).. In 1358, Albanians overran the regions of Epirus, Acarnania and Aetolia and established two principalities under their leaders, John Spata and Peter Losha.. Naupactus (Lepanto) was later taken in 1378. The Spata family frequently collaborated with Ottomans and saw them as protectors of the Spata family.
