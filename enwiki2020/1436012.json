    "text": "Thomas Seaton Scott (16 August 1826 - 15 or 16 June 1895) was an English-born Canadian architect. Born in Birkenhead, England he immigrated to Canada as a young man first settling in Montreal. He was hired by the Grand Trunk Railway and worked for them on a number of structures including the Union Station in Toronto and Bonaventure Station in Montreal. In 1871 he was hired by the Department of Public Works and he designed a number of Ottawa's new government buildings in the years after Canadian Confederation. Among his works are the West Block of the Parliament of Canada, the Cartier Square Drill Hall, and the now demolished Dominion Post Office. From 1872 to 1881 he held the position of Chief Dominion Architect and thus played at least a supervisory role in all major government projects. He is considered one of the creators of the Dominion Style that dominated Canadian institutional architecture in the nineteenth century. He was a founding member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts He was succeeded as Chief Architect by Thomas Fuller. == Works == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:lightblue;\" !width=28%|Building !width=8%|Year Completed !width=20%|Builder !width=10%|Style !width=32%|Location !width=7%|Image St Luke's Church !width=32%|Notes |- | Aurora Armoury | 1874 | Thomas Seaton Scott | Dominion Style Neo-Gothic style | 89 Mosley Street at Larmont Street, Aurora, Ontario | | Still in use by the military. |- | Mackenzie Tower, West Block | 1878 | Thomas Seaton Scott | | Parliament Hill, Ottawa, Ontario | | Provided design in 1874 |- | Second Supreme Court of Canada building | 1874 | Thomas Seaton Scott | Gothic Revival architecture | | | Demolished 1955-56 and now parking lot |- | Cartier Square Drill Hall | 1879-80 | Thomas Seaton Scott | Dominion Style Neo-Gothic style | 2 Queen Elizabeth Driveway, Ottawa, Ontario | 100px | Still in use. |- |Truro Armoury |1874 |Thomas Seaton Scott |Dominion Style Neo-Gothic style | 126 Willow Street, Truro, Nova Scotia | | Still in use. |- | St. Bartholomew's Anglican Church (Ottawa) | 1868 | Thomas Seaton Scott | Dominion Style Neo- Gothic style | 125 MacKay Street, Rideau-Rockcliffe Ottawa, Ontario | 100px | Still in use. |- | Summer House/Summer Gazebo, Parliament Hill | 1877 | Thomas Seton Scott | Carpenter Gothic | Parliament Hill, Ottawa, Ontario | | Built for the Speaker of the House of Commons and demolished 1956.
