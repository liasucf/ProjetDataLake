It runs 12.5 miles (20 km) from Chester Avenue in the north, crossing U.S. Highway 56 a couple of miles from the northern end and continuing south to the intersection of 135th St. in Kansas, Missouri Route 150 in the South. It continues north as Eaton St. and continues south as Kenneth Rd., both in Kansas. Its northernmost point is roughly 3/4 mile (1.25 km) south of Interstate 35. It is the dividing line between Kansas and Missouri for most of the Kansas City metro area south of the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers.Visual inspection of Google Maps and Google Earth, 2016-06-28 Cities along the road include Kansas City, Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas, and several smaller communities in Kansas such as Leawood, Mission Hills, Prairie Village, and Westwood Hills.
