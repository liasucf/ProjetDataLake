    "text": "Soho Radio is an independent online radio station based in Soho, London. It was created in 2014 by Adrian Meehan, Dan Gray and Finlay Morten, to showcase Soho's vibrant and diverse culture. The station streams programmes from a property on Great Windmill Street with a small coffee and merchandise shop in the front and the on-air DJ visible through glass in the rear; the location was chosen in part to allow passers-by to see the DJs at work. Live shows are streamed from its website, and archived shows are released on Mixcloud. In November 2016, Soho Radio was named the World's Best Internet Radio Station in the Online Radio Awards. ==Presenters== Soho Radio has a varied presenter line-up, covering \"musicians, artists, film makers, chefs, poets and the generally curious\". As such, shows vary from traditional music-heavy DJ sets to those more of a chatshow format. The line-up includes: * Aldo Zilli, celebrity chef and restaurateur * Andy Lewis (producer) * Barry Ashworth, of the Dub Pistols * Beans On Toast, folk musician * Danny Briottet (Renegade Soundwave) * Eddy Temple-Morris, DJ and musician * Ghostpoet, musician * Mark Jones, founder of the music label Wall of Sound * Norman Jay MBE, DJ * Rob da Bank, DJ and founder of music festivals Bestival and Camp Bestival * Shawn Lee, American musician and music producer * Simone Butler, bass player for Primal Scream * Sink the Pink, drag-cabaret act * Eli Silverman, British DJ and actor * The Cuban Brothers, musicians * William Sitwell, food critic and writer * Nina Davis, \"What's Offstage\" * Charlie Carter, actor/musician * Victor Hall and Ollie Levy, \"Radio Juan\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:Internet radio stations Category:Internet radio stations in the United Kingdom Category:Radio stations in London ",
