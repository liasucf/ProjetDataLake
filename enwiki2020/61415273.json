    "text": "Heather Margaret Halcrow Nicholson (n\u00e9e Halcrow, 19 June 1931 \u2013 9 July 2019) was a New Zealand geologist and writer. Her book, The Loving Stitch: a History of Knitting and Spinning in New Zealand, was judged best non-fiction book at the 1999 Montana Book Awards. ==Biography== Nicholson was born Heather Margaret Halcrow in Hamilton on 19 June 1931, the daughter of Amy and Tom Halcrow, and was raised at Galatea. She studied geology at Auckland University College, where she was the first woman whose thesis, on the geology of Waiheke Island and supervised by Arthur Lillie, was primarily based on fieldwork. She graduated MSc with second-class honours in 1954. The following year, she married Ian Nicholson, and the couple went on to have twin daughters. Heather Nicholson worked as a secondary-school science teacher, and rose to become head of science at Westlake Girls High School in Takapuna. However, she retired in the 1970s due to ill health, and became active as a practitioner and adult-education teacher of craftwork. In 1988, her instructional book Knitters Know-How was published. In 1993, she was awarded a grant by the Suffrage Centennial Trust to write a history of knitting, resulting in the publication of The Loving Stitch: a History of Knittting and Spinning in New Zealand in 1998. The book won Montana Medal for non-fiction at the Montana Book Awards the next year. By now in her late 60s, Nicholson returned to the University of Auckland to undertake doctoral studies on the history of geological understanding in New Zealand. She completed her PhD thesis, titled The New Zealand greywackes: a study of changing geological concepts to 1985, supervised by Bernhard Sp\u00f6rli, in 2003, and is thought to be one of the oldest people in New Zealand to have earned a postgraduate degree in geology. Nicholson died in Orewa on 9 July 2019. ==References== Category:1931 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from Hamilton, New Zealand Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:New Zealand women scientists Category:New Zealand geologists Category:Women geologists Category:New Zealand schoolteachers Category:New Zealand women writers Category:New Zealand non- fiction writers ",
