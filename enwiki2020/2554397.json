Visitors are encouraged to interact with most of the approximately 250 exhibits. It receives on average 450,000 visitors annually. ==History== The Universum Bremen opened in September 2000 near to the University of Bremen, Germany. Covering over 4,000 m\u00b2 the exhibition contains exhibits related to one of the three topics: mankind, earth and the cosmos. The science center building, with its 40,000 stainless steel scales, resembles a mixture between a whale and mussel. It was designed by the Bremen architect Thomas Klumpp. The company Universum Managementges. mbH runs the science center as a private enterprise. About 3.4 million people visited the Universum in the first seven years since it opened. In 2007 the Universum opened a large outdoor area, the EntdeckerPark, and a new building, the SchauBox. In contrast to the curved metallic older building, the SchauBox, developed by Haslob Kruse and Partner and Schwanzlutscher & Co., is cubic with a rust-red exterior. It is used for additional exhibitions, which change annually. The EntdeckerPark, the 5,000 m\u00b2 outdoor area developed by Planungsguppe Gr\u00fcn, offers a number of hands-on exhibits, landscape elements and a 27m-high tower, called the Turm der L\u00fcfte. The concept of the exhibits and the interior design were realized by Kunstraum GfK mbH, Hamburg and Archimedia, Stuttgart. ==References== ==External links== * Official Homepage * Category:Museums established in 2000 Category:Science museums in Germany Category:Museums in Bremen (city) ",
