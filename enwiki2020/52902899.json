    "text": "Hot Thoughts is the ninth studio album by American rock band Spoon. It was released on March 17, 2017, through Matador Records. It is also the first Spoon album since 2002's Kill the Moonlight to not feature multi- instrumentalist Eric Harvey, who quietly left the band after finishing a world tour in support of 2014's They Want My Soul. ==Reception== Hot Thoughts received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 82, based on 30 reviews. Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork wrote \"Spoon stay in their well-earned lane but tweak the formula just enough on their ninth album, keeping their reliably great songwriting and adding new, electronic textures.\" ==Accolades== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !
