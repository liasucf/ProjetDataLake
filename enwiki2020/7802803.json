    "text": "Salt equivalent is usually quoted on food nutrition information tables on food labels, and is a different way of defining sodium intake, noting that salt is chemically sodium chloride. To convert from sodium to the approximate salt equivalent, multiply sodium content by 2.5: \\frac{m_\\mathrm{NaCl}}{m_\\mathrm{Na}} = \\frac{m_\\mathrm{Na}+m_\\mathrm{Cl}}{m_\\mathrm{Na}} \\approx \\frac{23\\mathrm{u} + 35.5\\mathrm{u}}{23\\mathrm{u}} = \\frac{58.5}{23} \\approx 2.5 (see: atomic mass and molecular mass). ==Sources== * British Nutrition Foundation article on salt == Further reading == * Category:Nutrition Category:Equivalent units ",
