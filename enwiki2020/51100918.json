    "text": "Amadinone (INN), also known as 19-norchlormadinone, is a steroidal progestin of the 19-norprogesterone and 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone groups that was synthesized and characterized in 1968 but was never marketed. It has antigonadotropic properties, and for this reason, is a functional antiandrogen. An acetate ester, amadinone acetate, also exists, but similarly was never marketed. == See also == * Chlormadinone * Chlormadinone acetate == References == Category:Norpregnanes Category:Organochlorides Category:Progestogens Category:Abandoned drugs ",
