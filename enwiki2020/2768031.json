Monastic life had declined to a low ebb in England in the ninth century, partly because of the ravages caused by Viking attacks, and partly because of a preference for secular clergy, who were cheaper and were thought to serve the spiritual needs of the laity better. Kings from Alfred the Great onwards took an interest in the Benedictine rule, but it was only in the middle of the tenth century that kings became ready to commit substantial funds to its support. \u00c6thelwold became the leading propagandist for the monastic reform movement, although he made enemies by his ruthless methods, and he was more extreme in his opposition to secular clergy than his fellow reformers, Saint Dunstan and Oswald of Worcester. He is nevertheless recognised as a key figure in the reform movement, who also made a major contribution to the revival of learning and the arts. He was an important political figure, backing \u00c6thelred the Unready against Edward the Martyr, and playing a major advisory role during \u00c6thelred's minority.Yorke \"\u00c6thelwold\"Barrow The Ideology of the Tenth-Century English Benedictine Reform pp. 141\u2013154. ==Early life== \u00c6thelwold was born to noble parents in Winchester. From the late 920s he served in a secular capacity at the court of King Athelstan, and according to \u00c6thelwold's biographer, Wulfstan, \"he spent a long time in the royal burh there as the king's inseparable companion, learning much from the king's witan that was useful and profitable to him\".Quoted in Foot, \u00c6thelstan, p. 107 The king arranged for him to be ordained a priest by \u00c6lfheah the Bald, Bishop of Winchester, on the same day as Saint Dunstan. After a period in the late 930s studying under \u00c6lfheah at Winchester, \u00c6thelwold moved to Glastonbury Abbey, where Dunstan had been made abbot. Here \u00c6thelwold studied grammar, metrics and patristics, subsequently being made dean. During the reign of King Eadred (946\u2013955), \u00c6thelwold wished to travel to Europe to learn more about the monastic life, but Eadred refused permission, and instead appointed him abbot of the former monastic site of Abingdon, Oxfordshire, which was then served by secular priests. The years he spent in Abingdon were extremely productive, and he undertook the building of a church, the rebuilding of the cloister and the establishment at Abingdon of the Benedictine Rule. When Eadred died, he was succeeded by his nephew, Eadwig, who drove Eadred's chief advisor, Dunstan, into exile. However, \u00c6thelwold attended Eadwig's court in at least some of the years of his reign, 955\u201359. The future King Edgar had been taught from boyhood by \u00c6thelwold, who evidently inspired his pupil to take an interest in the rule of Saint Benedict. When Eadwig died, \u00c6thelwold naturally backed Edgar's succession.Barrow The Ideology of the Tenth-Century English Benedictine Reform p. 145 He seems to have been in the personal service of King Edgar in 960\u2013963, as he wrote many of the charters of this period. ==Bishop of Winchester== The Entry into Jerusalem from the Benedictional of Saint \u00c6thelwold (British Library) On 29 November 963, \u00c6thelwold was consecrated Bishop of Winchester, and the following year, with the connivance of King Edgar and the support of an armed force led by a royal official, he had the clerics of the Winchester Old and New Minsters expelled and replaced by monks from Abingdon. The king had sought the permission of the pope for the expulsion the previous autumn. Between 964 and 971, \u00c6thelwold refounded monasteries at Chertsey, Milton Abbas, Peterborough, Ely and Thorney, and the Nunnaminster nunnery in Winchester. He was also zealous in recovering land which he believed had once belonged to religious communities and subsequently been alienated, and if necessary charters were forged to prove claims to title. \u00c6thelwold was one of the principal advocates for the Benedictine reform movement during Edgar's reign, the author of all the major works of propaganda produced in England. He had the strong support of Edgar and his wife, \u00c6lfthryth, and his works emphasise the role of Edgar, who he saw as Christ's representative, in restoring the monasteries. He envisaged a major role for Edgar in supervising monasteries, and for Queen \u00c6lthryth supervising Benedictine nunneries.Barrow The Ideology of the Tenth- Century English Benedictine Reform pp. 146\u2013150 However, he was more extreme in his espousal of monasticism than Dunstan and Oswald, the other great leaders of monasticism in the reign of King Edgar. They followed continental practice in maintaining both monks and secular priests in their households, and did not follow \u00c6thelwold in his dramatic expulsions of secular clerks and replacement by monks. \u00c6thelwold links the terms 'filth' and 'clergy' several times in his writings, regarding them (like other Benedictines) as impure and unfit to serve altars or engage in any form of divine service, because many of them were married and they did not follow a monastic rule.Barrow The Ideology of the Tenth-Century English Benedictine Reform p. 150. To \u00c6thelwold's admirers, the epithets \"father of monks\" and \"benevolent bishop\" summarize his character as reformer and friend of Christ's poor;Catholic Online Saints and Angels: St. Ethelwold accessed on 5 September 2007 though he suffered much from ill- health, his life as scholar, teacher, prelate and Royal counsellor was ever austere, and he was said to be \"terrible as a lion\" to the rebellious, yet \"gentler than a dove\" to the meek. He is said to have written a treatise on the circle and to have compiled the \"Regularis Concordia\".Walsh A New Dictionary of Saints p. 184 The Benedictines were greatly superior to the secular clergy in their learning and their schools. \u00c6thelwold personally taught the older pupils at Winchester, and their works show that they regarded him with great respect and affection. His surviving works in both Latin and Old English show that he was a great scholar, and his vernacular writings are believed to have played an important role in the development of Standard Old English. Some of the wealth he accumulated was used to rebuild churches, and he was also a major patron of ecclesiastical art, although unfortunately none of his works survive, and only written accounts remain. The artistic workshops he established continued to be influential after his death, both at home and abroad. A century later \u00c6thelwold had acquired a great reputation as a goldsmith, and was credited with the production of a range of metal objects at Abingdon, including many figures and objects in precious metal, bells and even a pipe organ. While his later, disreputable successor at Abingdon Spearhafoc clearly was, like Dunstan, a significant artist, that Wulfstan's contemporary Life of \u00c6thelwold mentions him undertaking other forms of manual work, in the gardens and in building, but nothing about metalwork, suggests this legend was a later elaboration, though one that shows the high status of goldsmithing at the time.Wulfstan of Winchester Life of St. \u00c6thelwold, Lapidge, M. & Winterbottom, M. (eds.), OUP, 1991; Dodwell: 49\u201350. \u00c6thelwold was certainly bishop during the period when the Winchester school of manuscript illumination reached its peak, and the most important surviving manuscript of the school, the Benedictional of Saint \u00c6thelwold (British Library), was commissioned by him. He also rebuilt the Old Minster at Winchester, completed in 980. ==Political role== \u00c6thelwold also played an important political role. When the succession became an issue late in Edgar's reign, \u00c6thelwold supported the claim of \u00c6thelred, the son of his major patron, \u00c6lfthryth, whereas Dunstan and Oswald appear to have supported Edgar's son by an earlier wife, Edward the Martyr, who succeeded to the throne. After Edward was murdered in 978, \u00c6thelwold seems to have played a major advisory role in \u00c6thelred's minority. It is significant that it was only after \u00c6thelwold's death in 984 that \u00c6thelred started acting against the interests of some of the reformed monastic houses. One victim was Abingdon Abbey, and in a charter restoring its privileges in 993 the king acknowledged that \u00c6thelwold's passing had deprived the country \"of one whose industry and pastoral care ministered not only to my interest but also to that of all the inhabitants of the country.\"Keynes \u00c6thelred II ==Death and reputation== \u00c6thelwold died on 1 August 984Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 223 at Beddington in Surrey. He was buried in the crypt of the Old Minster at Winchester, but twelve years later \u00c6lfhelm, a citizen of Wallingford, claimed to have been cured of blindness by visiting \u00c6thelwold's tomb. This was taken as the necessary sign for his formal recognition as a saint, and his body was translated from the crypt to the choir. By the 12th century, Abingdon Abbey had acquired an arm and a leg.Royal Berkshire History, Abingdon Relics One of \u00c6thelwold's pupils, Wulfstan of Winchester, wrote a biography which seems to have played a major role in promoting his cult, and in about 1004 \u00c6lfric, another disciple and abbot of Eynsham, abridged Wulfstan's work in Latin and Old English.Lapidge, M. et al. (eds.), The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England, Blackwell, 2004, pp.19, 494. For \u00c6lfric's Vita S. \u00c6thelwoldi, see Winterbottom, M. (ed.), Three Lives of English Saints, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, Toronto, 1972, and Stevenson, J. (ed.), Chronicon Monasterii de Abingdon, Rolls Series, London, 1858, II, 255\u2013266 (online at Google Books. Retrieved 1 March 2010). However, the \u00c6thelwold of Wulfstan's life inspired respect rather than devotion, and his cult never seems to have achieved great popularity. Wulfstan's saint is a formidable authoritarian, who, for instance, commands a monk to show his devotion by plunging his hand into a pot of boiling stew. He has a reputation for ruthless insensitivity which is not shared by the other tenth-century monastic reformers. His importance to the reform movement has always been appreciated, but the range of his contributions to scholarship has only been recognised in recent years. \u00c6thelwold's liturgical feast is kept on 1 August,Farmer, David Hugh, The Oxford Dictionary of Saints, 1987, pp. 150-2, or on 19 May in the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter.Divine Worship: The Missal p. 734 ==Notes== ==Citations== ==References== *Anglo- Saxons.net Charter S567 accessed on 5 September 2007 *Barrow, Julia, The Ideology of the Tenth-Century English Benedictine 'Reform', in Patricia Skinner (ed.), Challenging the Boundaries of Medieval History: The Legacy of Timothy Reuter, 2009, Brepols, *Catholic Encyclopedia, 1909: St. Ethelwold * *Catholic Online Saints and Angels: St. Ethelwold accessed on 5 September 2007 *Foot, Sarah (2011) \u00c6thelstan: The First King of England, Yale University Press * *Lambertson, Reader Isaac.
