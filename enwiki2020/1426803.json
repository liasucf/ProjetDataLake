    "text": "The Theatre on the Balustrade (Divadlo Na z\u00e1bradl\u00ed) is situated in Prague, Czech Republic. The theatre was founded in 1958. Its founders - Helena Philipov\u00e1, Ivan Vysko\u010dil, Ji\u0159\u00ed Such\u00fd and Vladim\u00edr Vodi\u010dka named their professional theatre after a street leading from the square to the river. Its first production, a musical collage titled If a Thousand Clarinets (Czech: Kdyby tis\u00edc klarinet\u016f), was premiered on 9 December 1958. Three months later Ladislav Fialka and his mime group joined the company with their production Pantomime on the Balustrade, and brought back fame to the almost forgotten theatre genre. Drama and mime companies coexisted at the theatre till Fialka's death in 1991. In the early 1960s, with the arrival of director Jan Grossman, set designer Libor F\u00e1ra and a stage hand and later dramaturg and playwright V\u00e1clav Havel, the Theatre on the Balustrade became the centre of the Czech form of the absurd theatre (V. Havel: The Garden Party, Memorandum, Alfred Jarry: King Ubu, Franz Kafka: Process). Despite the fact that the theatre established itself abroad (or maybe because of it) as well as in Czechoslovakia, Jan Grossman and V\u00e1clav Havel were forced to leave the theatre in 1968. In the 1970s and 1980s the theatre became a refuge for film directors of the 1960s \"new wave\", whose film work was thwarted by the normalisation process. Apart from productions directed by J. Jire\u0161, J. Krej\u010d\u00edk, J. Menzel and J. Herz, it was mainly Evald Schorm who regularly co-operated with the theatre since 1976 (e.g. The King Stag, Hamlet, The Karamazov Brothers, Marathon) and managed to group around himself a number of brilliant actors (J. Barto\u0161ka, K. He\u0159m\u00e1nek, J. Preissov\u00e1, P. Zedn\u00ed\u010dek, L. Mrkvi\u010dka). In 1989 Jan Grossman returned to the theatre as a director and later its managing director, and after his untimely death in 1993 new management of the theatre was named - managing director Doubravka Svobodov\u00e1 and artistic director Petr L\u00e9bl. Petr L\u00e9bl was one of the most talented young directors with distinctive imagination who provoked with his interpretations of classics (J. Genet: The Maids, L. Stroupe\u017enick\u00fd: Our Our Swaggerers, N. V. Gogol: The Government Inspector, A. P. Chekhov: The Seagull, Ivanov, Uncle Vanya). After L\u00e9bl's death in 1999 the theatre continued its seeking, novel course of the present Theatre on the Balustrade with its new artistic direction of Ivana Sl\u00e1mov\u00e1, Ji\u0159\u00ed Ornest and Jan Anton\u00edn Pit\u00ednsk\u00fd. From the start of the season 2002/2003 a young director and playwright Ji\u0159\u00ed Pokorn\u00fd became, together with Ivana Sl\u00e1mov\u00e1, the new artistic director of the theatre. With arrival of new artistic director David Czesany in 2010 the Divadlo Na z\u00e1bradl\u00ed (Theater on the Balustrade) started off with a program of theme-based seasons. The first was named \u201cWho will be let through heaven\u2019s gates?\u201d, the current one (2011/2012) will be focused on public space and the city as a place for living and will be called \u201cWhose city?\u201d. Programming decisions as well as other projects of the theatre will be based on this topic: the upcoming season will bring exhibitions and meetings with witnesses to the changes that parts of the city have gone through. The topic of the city will also be tackled by students of art schools as a part of the Eliade Library project that introduces new creative projects, final works of art school graduates and works for children. With the new director the ensemble has grown as well, with the introduction of new members Ivan Lupt\u00e1k, Nat\u00e1lie \u0158eho\u0159ov\u00e1 and Ond\u0159ej Vesel\u00fd. ==External links== *Official site *Ivan Vyskocil\u00b4s site Category:Theatres in Prague ",
