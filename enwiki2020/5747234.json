    "text": "\"Never Again\" is a song written in 1982 by Swedish singer and songwriter Tomas Ledin. Although Ledin was a well known figure in Sweden, he was relatively unknown outside of the country. Stig Anderson, the owner of Polar Music and manager of the band ABBA, believed in Ledin's singing ability and wanted to promote him across the continent. Upon hearing \"Never Again\", Anderson thought this song would make a good duet, and suggested ABBA's Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog to record the song with him. Although a duet, Ledin and F\u00e4ltskog were not together in the studio when they laid down their vocal tracks. The resultant \"Never Again\" peaked at No.2 in Sweden and was also a Top 10 hit in Norway and Belgium. Ledin and F\u00e4ltskog also recorded a Spanish version of the song entitled \"Ya Nunca M\u00e1s\", which was a big hit in Chile and South America. ==Charts== {| class = \"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1982) !
