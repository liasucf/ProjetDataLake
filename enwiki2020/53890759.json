    "text": "The Barry Troglodyte Village is an archaeological site near Boll\u00e8ne, northwestern Vaucluse, France. It is located on a forested hill that overlooks the Rh\u00f4ne valley. A group of caves and stone buildings comprise an ancient village that is historically interesting because it was inhabited continuously from the neolithic until the early 20th century. Most remaining buildings date from the 17th until the 19th century, including a chapel from 1706 that was partly built in a cave.Patrimoine, Ville de Boll\u00e8ne ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Vaucluse Category:Tourist attractions in Vaucluse Category:Stone Age sites in France Category:Caves of France Category:Villages in Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur Category:Neolithic sites ",
