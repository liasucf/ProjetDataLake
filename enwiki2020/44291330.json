The future Duke was however baptised in 1650 in the Chapel at Ash, which had been licensed by the Bishop of Exeter in 1387.Listed building text, Chapel at Ashe House Ash was \"burnt and demolished\" during the Civil War and \"lay long in ruins\" during which time the family moved one mile away to Trill, Axminster.Prince, p.330 John Drake (1625\u20131669), the wartime occupant who had suffered so greatly for the Royalist cause received some recompense at the end of the troubles by being created a baronet by King Charles II on the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660.Vivian, p.297 Ash was rebuilt \"to a greater perfection than it was of before\" by Sir John Drake, 2nd Baronet (1647\u20131684).Prince, p.330 The last in the male line was Sir William Drake, 6th Baronet (ca. 1695\u20131733), who died without children and bequeathed all his estates to his widow Anne Williams (died 1793), who remarried to George Speke, MP, and had by him a daughter Anne Speke (before 1741\u20131797), who brought the Drake estates, including Ash and the advowson of Musbury, to her husband Frederick North, 2nd Earl of Guilford (1732\u20131792), who sold them piece-meal to various persons.Prince, p.331, footnote 2 (1810) Ash House survives today as a grade II* listed private residence in much the same form as depicted by Swete in 1795.Listed building text, Ashe House, Musbury; Listed building text, Chapel at Ashe House The Drake family of Ash rejected a claim by Admiral Sir Francis Drake (c. 1540 \u2013 1596) of Buckland Abbey, whom they considered to be below the rank of gentry, that he was descended from their ancient Drake family of Ash, and a famous physical confrontation broke out in the court of Queen Elizabeth I between Admiral Sir Bernard Drake (c. 1537 \u2013 1586) of Ash and Admiral Sir Francis Drake of Buckland Abbey when the latter made claim to the armorials of Drake of Ash.Prince, John, (1643\u20131723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London, p.329 ==Descent== The estate of Ash was a member of the manor of Musbury, itself a member of the feudal barony of Okehampton, the lords of which from about 1190 were the Courtenay family, later Earls of Devon.Pole, p.122 The descent of the estate of Ash was as follows: ===de Ash=== *Quardus de Ash is the earliest holder of Ash according to Pole (died 1635),Pole, p.122 from the Courtenay overlords. *Henry de Esse (a common variant of \"de Ash\"See for example the history of the manors of Roseash and Ashreigney), whose relationship to the foregoing holder Quardus is unknown, was granted the estate by \"John, Lord Courtenay\", according to Pole.Pole, p.122 ===Orwey=== *John de Orwey, of Orwey in the parish of Kentisbeare, Devon, whose wife was Juliana de Esse, heiress of Ash, having been given it by Henry de Esse.Pole, p.122 The arms of Orwey of Orwey and Ash were: Argent, on a chief indented sable three crosslets fitchee or.Pole, p.495 The arms Ermine, on a chief indented sable three crosslets fitchee or are shown in the 4th quarter of the escutcheon in the oil painting of Richard Drake (1535\u20131603) by George Gower (1540\u20131596) in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich.:File:Richard Drake George Gower 1577.jpg *Thomas de Orwey (son)Pole, p.122 *John de Orwey (son), who died without children.Pole, p.122 ===Strech=== *John Strech, husband of Jone de Orwey, sister and co-heiress (with her sister Phillipa de Orwey, wife of Warren (alias Warin) Hampton) of John de OrweyPole, p.122 The arms of Strech of Ash were: Argent, a bend engrailed sable between three martlets gules.Pole, p.503 *John Strech, son, who died without childrenPole, p.122 ===Hampton=== *Warin Hampton, son of Phillipa de Orwey, wife of Warren (alias Warin) Hampton.

Gilded inscribed biographical tablets appear under each couple of kneeling figures The earliest record of the Drake family of Devon is in an undated \"very old deed\" in Latin quoted by Westcote to have been witnessed by \"Walterus Draco\" and \"Wymondus de Dennex\" and others.Quoted in Prince, p.328 Thus Draco (from Greek \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd (drakon))Cassel's Latin Dictionary: \"Draco -onis, a kind of snake, dragon\" was the Latinized form of the name \"Drake\", meaning in Latin \"dragon\", referred to in the family's canting arms of a wyvern displayed gules. *John Drake of Axmouth,Drake of Exmouth per Pole, p.123; of Axmouth per Vivian, p.292 2 1/2 miles south-west of Ash, son and heir of John Drake of Otterton (13 miles south-west of Ash) by his wife Agnes Kelloway. He was called by Risdon (died 1640) \"A man of very great estate\".Risdon, p.24 He recovered Ash from Symon Francheney by exercise of a writ of Formedon,Pole, p.123 a writ of right for claiming entailed property.\"Formedon, a writ of right for claiming entailed property\" as stated in Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.)

Byrne states however that Roger had a daughter named Amy (Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.) The Lisle Letters, 6 vols, University of Chicago Press, Chicago & London, 1981, vol.3, p.303) lord of the manors of Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall and of Bideford in Devon.Or possibly she was a daughter of Roger I's grandson Roger Grenville (died 1545), Captain of the Mary Rose when it sank in Portsmouth Harbour in 1545, by his wife Thomasine Cole, daughter of Thomas Cole of Slade. She would thus have been a sister of Sir Richard Grenville (1542\u20131591), captain of the Revenge.(Vivian, Heralds' Visitations of Cornwall, pedigree of Grenville) The tablet under his effigy in Musbury Church is inscribed thus: ::Heer lieth the body of John Drake of Aish Esq.r and Amie his wife whoe was the daughter of Sr Roger Graynfeild Kt. by whom hee had issue six sones where of lived three at his death viz Barnard, Robart and Richard. He died the 4th of October 1558 and she died the 18th of Februarie 1577 :His third son as mentioned above was Richard Drake (1535\u20131603) of Esher , MP, an Equerry of the Stable and Groom of the Privy Chamber to Queen Elizabeth I. *Admiral Sir Bernard Drake (c. 1537 \u2013 1586), eldest son and heir.Vivian, p.297 The only Drake heir of Ash in ten generations not to bear the name John. He is said by Prince \"greatly to have exhausted his estate\", but for a noble cause \"for the honor and safety of his country\" and \"in the discovery of foreign regions, and such other vertuous achievements as purchase glory and renown\".Prince, p.330 He was \"a person of high spirit\" who stood up to the great Admiral Sir Francis Drake, of no provable family relationship to himself, when he tried to usurp the armorials of Drake of Ash, and in the royal court of Queen Elizabeth I gave him \"a box on the ear\", \"for which offence he incurred her Majesty's displeasure\".Prince, p.329 Sir Francis thereupon was awarded by the Queen his own coat of arms to a new design, to which Sir Bernard replied \"that though her Majesty could give him a nobler, yet she could not give an antienter coat than his\".Prince, p.329 Sir Francis however had the last laugh. A small detail in his new crest was a tiny image of the Drake of Ash wyvern gules hung up by the heels (sic) from the rigging of a ship.Prince, p.329 He died at Ash having struggled to return home very sick from gaol fever he had contracted whilst serving as a magistrate at the Black Assize of Exeter (1586), which claimed the lives of several other magistrates and occupants of the infected court house. The foreign prisoners who were the source of the infection had by co-incidence been captured at sea by Sir Bernard himself.Prince, pp. 329\u201330 He married Gertrude Fortescue (died 1601), daughter of Bartholomew Fortescue of Filleigh, North Devon, and sister of Richard Fortescue (died 1570) (ancestor of Earl Fortescue of Castle Hill, Filleigh) in memory of the latter of whom he erected a monumental brass showing his own portrait and arms in Filleigh Church. The tablet under his effigy in Musbury Church is inscribed thus: ::Heer is the monument of Sr Barnard Drake Kt. who had to wife Dame Garthrud the daughter of Bartholomew Fortescue of Filly Esqr. by whom hee had three sonnes and thre daughters where of whear five living at his death viz John, Hugh, Marie, Margaret and Helen.

His sister Elizabeth Drake married Sir Winston Churchill (1620\u20131688) of Glanville Wotton in Dorset and was mother of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough (1650\u20131722),Vivian, p.297 who on account of the Churchill residence having been destroyed during the Civil War, and the Churchill family having been heavily fined for its Royalist support, was born at Ash, his mother's family home. Ash too was shortly thereafter \"burnt and demolished\" by Parliamentarian troops, and \"lay long in ruins\" during which time the family moved one mile away to Trill.Prince, p.330 The Duke's early childhood was thus spent in comparative poverty. *Sir John Drake, 2nd Baronet (1647\u20131684), son.Vivian, p.297 In the words of Prince he \"enlarged and beautified\" Ash \"to a greater perfection than it was of before, enclosed a park adjoyning to the house with a good wall; made fish ponds, walks, gardens well furnished with great variety of choice fruits etc., so that now it may vye, for beauty and delight, with most other seats in those parts\" Prince, p.330 Having lived for a long time beneath his station in a tenant's house on the estate, he was happy again to reside at \"this sweet and pleasant place which with so much care and cost he had finished\", but died soon after. He had argued with his next half-brother and heir apparent Bernard Drake (?-1687), the future 3rd Baronet, (eldest son of his father by his second wife Dionis Strode, 8th daughter of Sir Richard Strode (1584\u20131669), MP, of Newnham, elder brother of William Strode (1594\u20131645), MP, one of the Five Members whose attempted unconstitutional arrest by King James I in the House House of Commons sparked the Civil War) whom \"having very highly disoblig'd him by an indigestible extravagance\" he cut-off from the entail on the family estates which thus prevented him from inheriting.Prince, p.331 Sir Bernard thus never owned Ash and lived instead at Herebeare in Bickington.Vivian, p.297 *Sir William Drake, 4th Baronet (1658\u20131716), younger sonVivian, p.297 The 2nd Baronet had died having broken the entail, but without having reassigned it as he had intended onto his youngest half-brother William Drake, the future 4th Baronet, and thus on his death was effectively intestate. His heir at law was his sister Elizabeth Drake (1648\u20131694), who in the words of Prince \"to her immortal honor\" and generosity re-settled the estates as her brother had wished onto William.Prince, p.331 *Sir John Drake, 5th Baronet (ca. 1689\u20131724), sonVivian, p.297 *Sir William Drake, 6th Baronet (ca. 1695\u20131733), younger sonVivian, p.297 Last in the male line, on whose death the Drake Baronetcy became extinct.

His watercolour painting of the house and corresponding journal entry survives, in the Devon Record Office. He was familiar with Prince's text and noted that the door and windows of the chapel were then blocked up and in contrast to Prince's description wrote: :\"We find all its beauty passed away - the park destroy'd, the ponds filled up - except in one long parallelogram at the entrance, and the garden more abundant in weed than flowers or choice fruit.\" ==References== ==Sources== *Gray, Todd & Rowe, Margery (Eds.), Travels in Georgian Devon: The Illustrated Journals of The Reverend John Swete, 1789-1800, 4 vols., Tiverton, 1999, vol.2, pp. 121\u20132 *Vivian, Lt.Col.
