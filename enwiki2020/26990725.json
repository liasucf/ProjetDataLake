    "text": "Holy Mission is a medieval fantasy MUD based in Linz, Austria. Founded in 1992 and still online, it is one of the longest-running MUDs. It uses the LPMud server software, and has been seen as typifying the \"LPMud genre\". (LPMud is properly a technical infrastructure, not a game genre, but some elements are popularly considered characteristic of games based on it.) Its name does not reflect any particular religious themes. It is most notable in that, following extended political disagreements with the Arch-Wizards on the direction of the game, Sarah Eaglesfield (who was an Elder named \"Redsexy\" and guild master of both the Summoner and the Jedi guild at the time) deleted all files from the MUD server in 1998 (with aid from fellow elders, \"Tatsuo\" and \"Wilbie\"). Despite her keeping a backup of all the game files, the original driver could not be found, and the MUD was never fully restored. Redsexy was promoted to a \"Lord\" for her work on the restoration project. \"Holy Mission Restoration Project\".Redsexy's Profile Holy Mission Restoration Project Former Arch- Wizard \"Kiri\" is still actively involved in attempting to restore the original MUD.\"Holy Mission Restoration Project\".Holy Mission Restoration Project \"Holy Mission Restoration Project\".Holy Mission Restoration Project One version of Holy Mission can still be reached at telnet://wildsau.holy-mission.org:81. ==References== ==External links== * Official web site * Holy Mission Recreation Project Site * Holy Mission 99 - Resurrected MUD Category:MUD games Category:Fantasy video games Category:1992 video games Category:Video games developed in Austria ",
