    "text": "The Georgia Southern\u2013Georgia State rivalry, also known as Modern Day Hate, is a college athletics rivalry between the Georgia Southern Eagles and Georgia State Panthers. Both schools are members of the Sun Belt Conference. While the teams have only met six times in football (due to Georgia State beginning their program in 2010), the rivalry dates back to the 1970s in basketball and other sports. ==History== Georgia Southern and Georgia State have only competed against each other in football since 2014. They played annually in basketball from the 1971\u201372 to 1980\u201381 seasons, 1995\u201396 and 1996\u201397, and 2009\u201310 to 2013\u201314 out-of-conference and as conference mates from the 1985\u201386 to 1991\u201392 seasons in the Trans America Athletic Conference (which is now the Atlantic Sun Conference) and since the 2014\u201315 season in the Sun Belt Conference. As of 2017, Georgia Southern has a 35\u201318 lead in the all-time series.Georgia State 2015\u201316 Men's Basketball, p. 153. Since both schools can be abbreviated GSU, a point of conflict between the two is the claim by either fan-base that their university is, in fact, the real GSU. Georgia State lays claim to the initials as it became a university (and therefore GSU) in 1969 while Georgia Southern didn't achieve university status until 1990. However Georgia Southern is, as an institution, the older of the two schools. Both schools are referred to as GSU colloquially in their region of the state, though Georgia State is the only one of the two that officially brands itself \"GSU.\" For Georgia Southern, the initials were tied to their storied athletics history. Georgia Southern's athletics began as Georgia Southern College or GSC and used the initials in several traditions and fixtures of campus life. As Georgia Southern gained university status in 1990, several of these fixtures were updated to use the initials GSU, most notably the famous GSU bushes at the entrance to the campus and gameday rituals including the \"G-S-U Scramble.\" When Georgia Southern joined the Sun Belt Conference in 2014 (the conference Georgia State had joined the year prior), Georgia Southern updated its branding and media guidelines to explicitly state the school was to be referred to as \"Georgia Southern\" or \"GS\" to avoid confusion in the media, however, the initials GSU are still a part of campus life at both universities. The football rivalry began after the hire of former Appalachian State (a major rival of Georgia Southern) athletic director Charlie Cobb to the same position at GSU. During Georgia State's press release introducing Cobb, he revealed that Georgia Southern's athletic director Tom Kleinlein told him \"welcome, now the war is on.\" The two teams met on the gridiron during the 2014 football season at the Georgia Dome. During the run up to the game, fans from both teams expressed their dislike for the other over social media outlets such as Twitter. Students at the time used the hashtags \"SouthernNotState\" and \"StateNotSouthern\" in their tweets to differentiate which GSU they attended. Both schools adopted the phrases as a slogan that defined their side of the rivalry. During the period before the game, a beat writer for the AJC dubbed the matchup as \"Modern Day Hate,\" a play on the rivalry between Georgia Tech and UGA, Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. Georgia Southern beat Georgia State by a final score of 69\u201331 in the Georgia Dome in front of 28,427 mostly Georgia Southern fans. After the game, Georgia Southern fans unrolled a banner saying \"Paulson Stadium North\" claiming the stadium as their own and cementing the rivalry. The next season, Georgia State beat Georgia Southern 34\u20137 to give the worst home defeat for Georgia Southern in school history. Currently, the series is even at 3\u20133. ==Rivalry series== On October 1, 2015, both schools' athletic directors at the time announced the beginning of an annual \"rivalry series\" in which the winner takes home the Rivalry Series trophy and bragging rights at the following year's football game. The trophy was awarded to the school that defeats the other in a points- based system that encompasses all sports. Most wins counted as 1 point with football counting as 2 points. 2 points total were awarded to community service projects, and 1 to the school with the highest departmental GPA. See external links section for full points explanation and scoreboard. 1 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, the Sun Belt Conference announced that all remaining spring sporting events after March 16th of that year would be cancelled. Men's and Women's Tennis, Men's and Women's Golf, Baseball, Softball, and Women's Outdoor Track and Field were omitted from the point totals for the 2019-2020. On September 12th, 2020, new Georgia Southern athletic director Jared Benko made a public statement that the Rivalry Series Point-based System will be discontinued in favor of a different approach. ==Football game results== ==Men's basketball game results== Table shows results since both teams officially entered NCAA basketball competition with one another. == Men's soccer results == Georgia State leads Georgia Southern 27\u201311\u20137 in men's soccer competitions. ==References== ==External links== *Rivalry series point system *Rivalry series scoring page Category:College sports rivalries in the United States Category:Georgia Southern Eagles Category:Georgia State Panthers Category:1972 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) ",
