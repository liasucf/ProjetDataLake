He also habilitated there that year for psychiatry and neurology, and in 1915 for racial research and racial biology. For his doctoral dissertation, Lundborg researched one of the genetic progressive myoclonus epilepsies first described by Heinrich Unverricht in 1891. Besides giving an account of the disease, he traced an affected family back to the 18th century, an analysis unique for that time. He concluded that the family had genetically degenerated because of \"unwise marriages\".Lundborg, H. B. (1903). \"Die progressive Myoklonus-Epilepsie (Unverricht's Myoklonie)\". The study has been described as \"of considerable historic interest in human genetics\".Johns Hopkins University. \"Myoclonic epilepsy of Unverricht and Lundborg\". NCBI. Over the years, the form of epilepsy became known as the Unverricht\u2013Lundborg disease. He was on the editorial board of the Hereditas journal, founded 1920, with the scope on genetics. Lundborg was strongly involved with the ideology of racial hygiene. In the beginning of the 20th century, the idea that eugenics could improve the biological basis of society was widely held by academics and lawmakers, particularly in northern Europe and the United States. In 1922 Sweden established a eugenic governmental agency, the State Institute of Racial Biology, of which Lundborg was appointed as the head. Under his leadership, the institute began gathering copious statistics and photographs to map the racial make-up of about 100,000 Swedish people. ==References== Category:1868 births Category:1943 deaths Category:People from Karlstad Municipality Category:Swedish eugenicists Category:Swedish neurologists Category:Burials at Uppsala old cemetery ",
