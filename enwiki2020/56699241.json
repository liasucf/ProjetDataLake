    "text": "Harley Quinn is an American adult animated television series based on the DC Comics character of the same name created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm. The series is written and executive produced by Justin Halpern, Patrick Schumacker, and Dean Lorey, and follows the misadventures of Harley Quinn and her best friend/partner-in-crime Poison Ivy after leaving her ex-boyfriend, the Joker. The show premiered on November 29, 2019 on DC Universe to critical success, with critics praising its animation, humor, dark tone and voice acting. The show's second season premiered on April 3, 2020. On September 18, 2020, the series was officially renewed for a third season, along with the announcement that the show would permanently move to HBO Max, following the restructuring of DC Universe. ==Overview== The series follows Harley Quinn's adventures after she breaks up with the Joker and her attempt to join the Legion of Doom, forming her own crew consisting of Poison Ivy, Clayface, Doctor Psycho, King Shark, and Sy Borgman. When she finally achieves this goal however, she inadvertently distances herself from her newfound friends and continues to face problems from the Joker, who refuses to accept the idea of Harley becoming a supervillain on her own. In the season one finale, the Joker manages to take over Gotham, only to be defeated by Harley and her crew. In a final act of retaliation, he destroys the entire city, resulting in the apparent deaths of both him and Batman. In the second season, Gotham City has become isolated from the rest of the United States, allowing the newly-formed Injustice League to take over Gotham's ruins and divide it between them. After they refuse to let Harley join, she works with her crew to take them down one by one in order to claim Gotham for herself, in the process unwittingly inspiring Barbara Gordon to become Batgirl. Meanwhile, both the Joker and Batman are revealed to have survived, the former now sane and with no memory of his old self while the latter, unable to fight crime due to his injuries, names Batgirl his temporary replacement as Gotham's defender until he recovers. Following the Injustice League's defeat, Commissioner Gordon restores order to Gotham while Harley begins to develop feelings for Ivy. Concurrently, Doctor Psycho leaves the crew and attempts to conquer the world on his own, taking control of a Parademon army. To stop him, Harley joins forces with the Justice League, Gordon, and the Joker; reluctantly restoring the Joker back to his former self in the process. While the League defeat the Parademons, Harley and Ivy defeat Psycho, but he reveals a memory of them sleeping together, right before Ivy's wedding with Kite Man. Though Ivy and Kite Man attempt to continue on, after Gordon busts the wedding, Kite Man realizes Ivy does not love him and breaks up with her. While running from Gordon together, Ivy finally admits her feelings for Harley. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Kaley Cuoco as Harley Quinn * Lake Bell as Poison Ivy, Cheryl * Alan Tudyk as Joker, Clayface, Calendar Man, Doctor Trap, Condiment King * Tony Hale as Doctor Psycho, Felix Faust * Ron Funches as King Shark * Jason Alexander as Sy Borgman * J.

Veja o Trailer! On December 8, 2019, the first episode was shown as a special presentation on TBS. Season 1 started airing on Syfy on May 3, 2020. The series airs on Adult Swim in Canada, with new episodes airing a week after their American premiere. The series started airing on E4 in the United Kingdom and Ireland on May 7, 2020. The series debuted on HBO Max on August 1, 2020. An original short featuring Harley answering questions from fans was released online during DC FanDome in 2020. ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, season 1 has an approval rating of 88% based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 8.25/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"A strong voice cast and an even stronger grasp of what makes its titular antiheroine so beloved make Harley Quinn a violently delightful\u2014and surprisingly insightful\u2014addition to the DC animated universe.\" Season 2 has an approval rating of 100% based on 16 reviews with an average rating of 9.0, and a critical consensus stating, \"Harley Quinn maintains its frenetic energy and humor while doubling down on the shenanigans and giving its titular anti-heroine even more room to play.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Caroline Framke of Variety wrote: \"The animation feels like that of a typical Saturday morning cartoon, but its acidic scripts and shocking bursts of gore reminds you that Harley Quinn is taking full advantage of airing on a streaming service without censors. [...] Sharp voice performances across the board from actors clearly relishing the chance to play in this world also prove too fun to resist. [...] Most importantly, Harley gets to be an entire person all her own, as heartbreakingly naive as she is wickedly strange and funny.\" Robyn Bahr of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"It's one of the best surprises of the year. [...] 13 zippy, violent and irreverent half-hour episodes. [...] The writing is frequently uproarious, chock full of Millennial nostalgia and cerebral gallows humor (the former may be low-hanging, rapidly-perishable fruit, but at least the show knows how to embrace its audience).\" ==Home media== The first season was released on DVD on June 2, 2020 by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. The first two seasons will also be released on Blu-ray in a box set by Warner Archive Collection.https://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Harley-Quinn-The-Complete- First-and-Second-Seasons-Blu-ray/275071/ Digitally, the first two seasons are also available for digital purchase on Prime Video and iTunes. ==References== ==External links== * Harley Quinn at DC Universe * Category:2010s American adult animated television series Category:2010s American black comedy television series Category:2010s American LGBT-related television series Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:2020s American adult animated television series Category:2020s American black comedy television series Category:2020s American LGBT-related television series Category:American adult animated action television series Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:American adult animated superhero television series Category:American adult animated web series Category:Animated Batman television series Category:Animated television shows based on DC Comics Category:DC Universe (streaming service) original programming Category:HBO Max original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Harley Quinn in other media Category:LGBT-related animated series Category:LGBT-related animated web series Category:Supervillain television shows Category:Television series about abuse Category:Television series by Warner Bros.
