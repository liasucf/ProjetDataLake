    "text": "Evangeline is a song and the 12th EP by Scottish alternative rock band Cocteau Twins. It was recorded and mixed at September Sound in London, and released in September 1993 by record label Fontana. The song was a moderate hit in several countries and was very popular in Portugal. It was included on the band's seventh studio album, Four-Calendar Caf\u00e9. ==Critical reception== David Beran from Gavin Report commented, \"Headphones are a must for this sonic picnic and first single from the upcoming album. Drop into background landscapes of milky way-out keyboards and slivers of airy guitar. Oh, did I mention that the foreground vocals are patent 'Teau Twin ringlets of bliss?\" He added that the song \"slowly plunges as Frazer's voice soars into a firmament crowded with spacey snippets of computerized sound.\" Chuck Campbell from Knoxville News- Sentinel described \"the gorgeous strains\" as \"typical Cocteau Twins triumphs, aural massages of magical quality.\" He said that \"the instruments supply an air of dreamy melancholia that both chills and warms.\"Campbell, Chuck (November 10, 1993). \"COCTEAU TWINS HYPNOTIZE AGAIN WITH NEW MAGIC\". Knoxville News-Sentinel. Retrieved March 25, 2020. Lennox Herald called it \"a fine effort\".\"COCTEAU TWINS Evangeline\". Lennox Herald. October 1, 1993. page 28. Retrieved March 28, 2020. Musician noted its \"sly pop appeal\" and said that \"the candyland blur of the Cocteaus' sound has never been so alluring\". R.S. Murthi from New Straits Times wrote that a song like \"Evangeline\" \"evince concerns that go beyond the ordinary. And the combination of surreal verbal imagery and atmospheric music makes for an engaging mystique.\" In his review of Four-Calendar Caf\u00e9, Alec Foege from Spin magazine picked it as one of the album's three most successful songs. He said that \"...\"Evangeline\" swells with the effects-treated grandeur of Simon Raymonde and Robin Guthrie's accompaniment\". In his book The Da Capo Companion to 20th-century Popular Music, Phil Hardy described it as \"dreamy\". Eric Weisbard and Craig Marks commented in their Spin Alternative Record Guide, that \"Evangeline\" is \"a song so adult-sounding it could have come from Prefab Sprout.\" ==Music video== The music video for \"Evangeline\" was directed by German film director Nico Beyer. ==Track listing== ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1993) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |align=\"center\"|89 |- |align=\"left\"|Portugal (AFP) |align=\"center\"|4 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles (The Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|34 |- |} ==Personnel== ; Cocteau Twins * Elizabeth Fraser \u2013 vocals * Robin Guthrie \u2013 guitar, drum machine * Simon Raymonde \u2013 bass guitar ; Production * Engineer [additional] \u2013 Lincoln Fong * Photography [original] \u2013 Walter Wick * Writer, composer and producer \u2013 Cocteau Twins ==References== Category:Cocteau Twins albums Category:1993 EPs Category:1993 singles Category:1993 songs Category:Music videos directed by Nico Beyer ",
