    "text": "The University of Paris () is a public university created by decree on 20 March 2019 and resulting from the merger of Paris Descartes (Paris V) and Paris Diderot (Paris VII) universities established following the division of the University of Paris (c. 1150\u20131793, 1896\u20131970), and the integration of Institut de physique du globe de Paris as a component institution. As of January 1, 2020, the universities of Paris Descartes and Paris Diderot have fully relinquished their rights and bonds at Universit\u00e9 de Paris. == Organization == Universit\u00e9 de Paris is a scientific, cultural and professional experimental public institution. It is multidisciplinary and comprises four main areas of training: legal, economic and management disciplines; humanities and social sciences; science and technology; and health disciplines. == Governance == On 21 June 2019, Christine Clerici was elected President of Universit\u00e9 de Paris. On proposals, she appointed the following Faculty Councils: Alain Zider, Dean of the Faculty of Science, Xavier Jeunemaitre, Dean of the Faculty of Health and Sylvain Moutier, Dean of the Faculty of Societies and Humanities. The Academic Senate of Universit\u00e9 de Paris, meeting on 8 October 2019, elected Edouard Kaminski, Vice-President for Research, Philippe Roussel-Galle, Vice-President for Training and Emylie Lentzner, Student Vice-President. On 11 October 2019, the Board of Directors elected Clarisse Berthez\u00e8ne as Vice-President. The governance of Universit\u00e9 de Paris is ensured by a President, an Executive Board, and an Academic Senate that deliberate, by academic and technical bodies that give opinions and orientations. The President is elected by the Executive Board for a four-year term, renewable once, from among teacher-researchers, researchers, professors or lecturers, associates or guests. The President is assisted by a Vice- President of the Executive Board, a Vice-President of Research, a Vice- President of Education and a Vice-President of Student Affairs. The Executive Board comprises twenty-eight members: sixteen representatives elected by and from among the staff and students of Universit\u00e9 de Paris and the IPGP, four ex officio members (Chairman of the Board of Directors of the IPGP, Chairman of the CNRS, Chairman of Inserm, Director General of Assistance Publique \u2013 H\u00f4pitaux de Paris), and eight qualified personalities. == History == The Universities of Paris-III, Paris-V, and Paris-VII have been moving closer together since the mid-2000s as part of the establishment of research and higher education clusters (PRES) and the Campus Plan. An initial understanding bringing them together took place in January 2006 with the creation of the association Paris Centre Universities, which then brought together the university with those of Paris 1, Paris 5, and Paris 13, whereas the other Parisian universities had united around the Paris Universitas project the previous year. The projects put forward by these initial meetings of institutions were not retained in the first phase of the campus plan of April 2008, and new links are being formed. Paris 7 subsequently became part of the Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 project, which also brings together the universities of Paris 3, Paris 5 and Paris 13, as well as other higher education institutions such as SciencesPo, and the PRES was officially created on 13 February 2010. In 2017, Paris-III and Sciences Po withdrew from the merger project but the universities of Paris-V and Paris-VII decided on a merger scheduled for 1 January 2019. Universit\u00e9 de Paris is created as a university grouping on 20 March 2019. The Universities of Paris-V and Paris-VII were dissolved on 1 January 2020 while the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, as a \"component-institution\", retains its legal personality. On 21 June 2019, Christine Clerici was elected President of Universit\u00e9 de Paris. On proposals, she appointed the following Faculty Councils: Alain Zider, Dean of the Faculty of Science, Xavier Jeunemaitre, Dean of the Faculty of Health, and Sylvain Moutier, Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. The Academic Senate of Universit\u00e9 de Paris, meeting on 8 October 2019, elected Edouard Kaminski, Vice-President for Research, Philippe Roussel-Galle, Vice-President for Training. == Nobel and Fields laureates == *George Fitzgerald Smoot - Professor - Nobel in Physics - 2006 *Jean Dausset - Professor - Nobel in Physiology or Medicine - 1980 * Artur Avila - Professor - Fields Medal - 2014 == References == == External links == * Category:2019 establishments in France Category:Educational institutions established in 2019 Category:Universities in Paris Category:Universities and colleges formed by merger in France ",
