    "text": "' is a trans-Neptunian object and retrograde damocloid on a highly eccentric, cometary-like orbit. It was first observed on 3 June 2006 by the Mount Lemmon Survey at the Mount Lemmon Observatory in Arizona, United States. The orbit of is highly uncertain as its observation arc is only spans 2 days. measures approximately in diameter, assuming a low albedo of 0.09. == Orbit == The orbit of has a high eccentricity of 0.88 and a semi-major axis of 32.2 AU. Its perihelion distance is 3.7 AU from the Sun and its aphelion distance is 60.7 AU. Its orbit is inclined 172 degrees to the ecliptic plane, meaning that it orbits the Sun in a retrograde (backwards) motion compared to the planets in the Solar System. Because of 's highly eccentric and inclined orbit, it is classified as a damocloid, a group of minor planets with long period comet- like orbits. == References == == External links == * Category:Trans- Neptunian objects Category:Damocloids Category:Minor planet object articles (unnumbered) Category:Astronomical objects discovered in 2006 Category:Lost minor planets ",
