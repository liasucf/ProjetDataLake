Upon the death of Prince Friedrich G\u00fcnther in 1971, a claim to the headship of the house passed under Semi-Salic primogeniture to his elder sister, Princess Marie Antoinette of Schwarzburg who married Friedrich Magnus V, Count of Solms-Wildenfels.The House of Schwarzburg on Heraldica.orgJames, John Almanach de Gotha, Volume I, 2013. Reigning over the County of Schwarzburg and founded by Sizzo I of Schwarzburg (died 1160), the family split in the 16th century into the lines of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen and Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, with the Sondershausen dying out in 1909. ==Family history== The County of Schwarzburg was a state of the Holy Roman Empire from 1195 to 1595, when it was partitioned into Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. It was ruled by counts from the House of Schwarzburg. Schwarzburg Castle was first mentioned in a 1071 deed. In 1123 Count Sizzo III of K\u00e4fernburg (Kevernburg), mentioned by the medieval chronicler Lambert of Hersfeld and according to the Annalista Saxo a grandson of Prince Yaropolk Izyaslavich of Turov by his mother, rebuilt the castle calling himself a \"Count of Schwarzburg\". Sizzo also established Georgenthal Abbey and in 1157, he accompanied Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa during his campaign against High Duke Boles\u0142aw IV the Curly of Poland. In 1197, Sizzo's grandson Henry II divided the common heritage with his brother G\u00fcnther III and made Schwarzburg Castle his residence. His territory then also comprised the nearby castle of Blankenburg. The most famous family member is G\u00fcnther XXI von Schwarzburg. In 1349, he was elected as German king by the majority of electors. But, due to waning support, he renounced some months later and died shortly after. The Schwarzburg lands were again divided among his successors until in 1538 when Count G\u00fcnther XL the Rich was able to unite the territories including Frankenhausen and Rudolstadt under his rule. He was succeeded by his eldest son G\u00fcnther XLI. However, after his death in 1583, his younger brothers again divided the county: John G\u00fcnther I received the territory around Arnstadt, later called Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, while Albrecht VII inherited the lands of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. The partition was finally confirmed by the 1599 Treaty of Stadtilm. ==Counts of Schwarzburg and K\u00e4fernburg== ===House of Schwarzburg=== ====Partitions of Schwarzburg under Schwarzburg rule==== {|align=\"center\" style=\"border-spacing: 0px; border: 1px solid black; text- align: center;\" |+ |- | colspan=9 style=\"background: #fff;\" |County of Schwarzburg (1030-1275/8) |- | colspan=2 style=\"background: #abc;\" |County of K\u00e4fernburg (1st creation) (1070-1118) | colspan=7 style=\"background: #fff;\" | |- | colspan=9 style=\"background: #fff;\" | |- | colspan=2 style=\"background: #abc;\" |County of K\u00e4fernburg (2nd creation) (1160-1184) | colspan=7 style=\"background: #fff;\" | |- | colspan=9 style=\"background: #fff;\" | |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #acb;\" |County of Hallermund (1197-1411) (inherited) | colspan=2 style=\"background: #abc;\" |County of K\u00e4fernburg (3rd creation) (1197-1386) | colspan=6 style=\"background: #fff;\" | |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #acb;\" | | colspan=1 style=\"background: #cab;\" |County of K\u00e4fernburg-Wiehe (1223-1319) | colspan=1 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=6 style=\"background: #fff;\" | |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #acb;\" | | colspan=1 style=\"background: #cab;\" | | colspan=1 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=4 style=\"background: #cba;\" |County of Schwarzburg-Wachsenburg (1275/8-1450) | colspan=2 style=\"background: #bac;\" |County of Schwarzburg-Blankenburg (1275/8-1444), renamed County of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt (1st creation) (1444-1564) |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #acb;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=4 style=\"background: #cba;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #bac;\" | |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #acb;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #abc;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #bca;\" |County of Schwarzburg-Leutenberg (1333-1564) | colspan=2 style=\"background: #cba;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #bac;\" | |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #acb;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #eee;\" |Annexed to Meissen | colspan=2 style=\"background: #bca;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #cba;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #bac;\" | |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #eee;\" |Sold to Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel | colspan=2 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #bca;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #cba;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #bac;\" | |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #bca;\" | | colspan=4 style=\"background: #bac;\" | |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=6 style=\"background: #fff;\" |County of Schwarzburg (1564-1571) (Arnstadt line) |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=1 style=\"background: #ec6;\" |County of Schwarzburg-Frankenhausen (1571-1597) | colspan=2 style=\"background: #fed;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #def;\" | | colspan=1 style=\"background: #bac;\" |County of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt (2nd creation) (1571-1583) |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=1 style=\"background: #ec6;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #fed;\" | | colspan=3 style=\"background: #def;\" | |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=3 style=\"background: #fed;\" |County of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt (1571-1710) renamed Principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt (1710-1909) | colspan=3 style=\"background: #def;\" |County of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen (1571-1666) renamed Principality of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen (1666-1909) |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=3 style=\"background: #fed;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #def;\" | | colspan=1 style=\"background: #bac;\" |County of Schwarzburg-Arnstadt (3rd creation) (1643-1716) |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=3 style=\"background: #fed;\" | | colspan=3 style=\"background: #def;\" | |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=3 style=\"background: #fed;\" | | colspan=3 style=\"background: #def;\" | |- | colspan=1 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=2 style=\"background: #eee;\" | | colspan=6 style=\"background: #fff;\" |Principality of Schwarzburg (1909-1918) (Rudolstadt line) |} ====Table of rulers==== (Note: There are two manners for numbering the rulers of this noble family: birth numbers or regnal numbers.
