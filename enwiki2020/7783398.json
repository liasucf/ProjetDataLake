Griffith,\" Los Angeles Times, July 7, 1919 \"It must be made a place of rest and relaxation for the masses, a resort for the rank and file, for the plain people,\" Griffith told the Los Angeles City Council when he donated the land. \"I consider it my obligation to make Los Angeles a happy, cleaner, and finer city. I wish to pay my debt of duty in this way to the community in which I have prospered.\" Griffith Park narrative , Department of Recreation and Parks, City of Los Angeles Griffith later donated another along the Los Angeles River.\"Griffith Park To Be Considered For Monument Status\"; Walton, Alice, City News Service, August 21, 2008 ===Crime=== While vacationing in Santa Monica on September 3, 1903, Griffith shot his wife in the presidential suite of the Arcadia Hotel, as she knelt on the floor before him. The shot did not kill her, but she was left disfigured and lost her right eye. Griffith was charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to commit murder. The prosecution was led by Henry T. Gage, former governor of California. Griffith was defended by attorney Earl Rogers, whose cross-examination of the veiled Mrs. Griffith revealed that her husband\u2014generally thought to be a teetotaler\u2014was in fact a secret drunk who was subject to paranoid delusions. Griffith was convicted of a lesser charge, assault with a deadly weapon. The judge sentenced him to two years in San Quentin State Prison, instructing that he be given \"medical aid for his condition of alcoholic insanity\".St. Johns, Adela Rogers, Final Verdict. Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Company, Inc., 1962, pp. 220\u2013239. \"That was where Earl Rogers began the first alcoholic insanity defense,\" St. Johns wrote. \"Perhaps the first\u2014certainly one of the first\u2014times that alcohol was called to account in an American courtroom as a disease, a mental illness, not just a sin or a crime or an indulgence\". (Final Verdict, p. 232.) On November 4, 1904, while he was in prison, Mrs. Griffith was granted a divorce on the grounds of cruelty, and she was awarded custody of their 16-year-old son Vandell.
