    "text": "S\u00f8nderjyskE is a Danish sport club. They have two handball teams (one male based in S\u00f8nderborg, one female based in Aabenraa), two football teams (one professional male club and one professional female club, both based in Haderslev) and an ice hockey team based in Vojens. All the teams play in Southern Jutland. The name is short for S\u00f8nderjysk Elitesport (English language: Southern Jutlandic Elite Sport). ==History== S\u00f8nderjyskE was created as a club for the whole region of South Jutland as it was obvious that it was impossible to create elite teams able to compete in the top leagues on the former basis of city teams. The men's football team used to be solely based in the city of Haderslev under the name Haderslev FK. In 2004 all the elite teams in football, ice hockey and handball merged into S\u00f8nderjyskE, enabling the clubs to represent not only a city but the whole region of South Jutland (S\u00f8nderjylland), which drew more attention to the teams from sponsors, fans and media and made it easier to keep talents in South Jutland. As of 2009-07-01 4 of the 5 teams in the club play in the best Danish leagues: Men's football (Latest position: 6th), women's football (latest position: relegated to second-best league), women's handball (latest position: 12th) and the ice hockey team (latest position: 1st). The male handball team finished 1st in the second-best Danish league. ==Team (Men)== ===Staff=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" !valign=center |Pos.||Name |- |- |Head Coach|| Jan Pytlick |- |Assistant Coach|| Rasmus Glad Vandb\u00e6k |- |Team Leader|| Sonny Johansen |- |Team Leader|| Poul Hansen |- |Team Leader|| Mona Blank |- |Physiotherapist|| Finn Zachariassen |- |} ===Current squad=== :Squad for the 2020-21 season ;Goalkeeper * 1 Kristian Dahl Pedersen * 12 Josip Cavar ;Wingers ;LW * 22 Mikkel Hansen * 67 Tobias M\u00f8ller ;RW * 10 Nikolai Vinther * 18 Alec Smit ;Pivots * 5 Sveinn J\u00f3hannsson * 14 Frederik Ladefoged * 18 Morten Bj\u00f8rnshauge ;Back players ;LB * 7 Oliver N\u00f8ddesbo Eggert * 66 Noah Gaudin ;CB * 2 Thomas Mogensen * 17 Jesper Clausen ;RB * 6 Jon Lindenchrone Andersen * 24 Marcus Dahlin ===Transfers=== :Transfers for the 2020-21 season ;Joining * Jan Pytlick (Head coach) (from Odense H\u00e5ndbold) * Tobias M\u00f8ller (LW) (from Aarhus H\u00e5ndbold) * Noah Gaudin (LB/CB) (from Pays d'Aix Universit\u00e9 Club) * Thomas Mogensen (CB) (from Skjern H\u00e5ndbold) * Marcus Dahlin (RB) (from Mors-Thy H\u00e5ndbold) * Nikolai Vinther (RW) (from Aarhus H\u00e5ndbold) * Morten Bj\u00f8rnshauge (P) (from Skjern H\u00e5ndbold) ;Leaving * Mikkel Kj\u00e6r M\u00f8ller (LW) (to GOG H\u00e5ndbold) * Aaron Mensing (LB) (to TTH Holstebro) * Kasper Olsen (LB) (to Team Sydhavns\u00f8erne) * Rasmus Bertelsen (LB) (to Stavanger IF) * Lasse Hamann- Boeriths (CB) (to TMS Ringsted) * Arnar Birkir Halfdansson (RB) (to EHV Aue) * Christian Jensen (RW) (to TTH Holstebro) * Steffan H\u00f8i (RW) (to 2. team) * Frederik B\u00f8rm (P) (to Aarhus H\u00e5ndbold) * Oskar Sunnefeldt (CB) (to THW Kiel) ==Team (women)== ===Staff=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" !valign=center |Pos.||Name |- |- |Head Coach|| Peter Nielsen |- |Assistant Coach|| Mikael Jensen |- |Team Leader/Video|| Erik J\u00f8rgensen |- |Team Leader|| Lillian Jensen |- |Physiotherapist|| Jannik Duus Jensen |- |} ===Current squad=== :Squad for the 2020-21 season ;Goalkeeper * 1 Alberte Stenderup * 16 Johanne Graugaard ;Wingers ;LW * 7 Kathrine Kubicki * 20 Jackie Moreno ;RW * 11 Pernille Johansen * 71 Nina Bech 14px ;Pivot * 5 Nanna Viuff * 18 Camilla Aastrup * 88 Alberte Kristensen ;Back players * 2 Cecilie Bjerre * 3 Cecilie L\u00f8vdal * 77 Leonora Demaj 14px ;CB * 6 Louise Andresen * 13 Sofie Schelde- Rasmussen * 29 Rebecca S\u00f8nderskov ;RB * 4 Celina Hansen (Pregnant) * 8 Clara Skyum Thomsen * 19 Eline Osland ===Transfers=== :Transfers for the 2020-21 season ;Joining * Alberte Stenderup (GK) (from Gudme HK) * Jackie Moreno (LW) (from Skuru IK) * Kathrine Kubicki (LW) (from HH Elite) * Cecilie Bjerre (LB) (from Gudme HK) * Cecilie L\u00f8vdal (LB) (from Ajax K\u00f8benhavn) * Rebecca S\u00f8nderskov (CB) (from Ringk\u00f8bing H\u00e5ndbold) * Eline Osland (RB) (from Bjerringbro FH) * Clara Skyum Thomsen (RB) (from Gudme HK) * Pernille Johannsen (RW) (from Team Esbjerg) * Alberte Kristensen (P) (from DHG Odense) ;Leaving * Dragana Petkovska (GK) * Rikke Hoffbeck Petersen (LW) (to EH Aalborg) * Sara Mitova (LW) * Helena \u00d6rvarsd\u00f3ttir (LB) * Caroline Rasmussen (RB) (to Skanderborg H\u00e5ndbold) * Sandra Wrede (RW) * Ljubica Pavlovi\u0107 (P) ==References== Category:Danish handball clubs Category:Handball clubs established in 2004 Category:2004 establishments in Denmark Category:S\u00f8nderjyskE ",
