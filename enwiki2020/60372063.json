It is located in the village of Uchail Shankarpasha, Rajiura Union, Habiganj. It is located in the village of Shankarpasha in Rajiura Union Parishad, very close to Uchail Bazar. ==History== From engraved inscriptions, it can be found that the mosque was completed in 1208 by Sultan Alauddin Husain Shah's administrative officer, Majlis Amin. Amin took part in Shah Jalal's Conquest of Gour and one of the 12 to accompany Syed Nasiruddin's expedition in Taraf. Amin's mazar is located next to the mosque. As years passed, the area became entrapped in dense vegetation and forest land. Recently, this mosque has been discovered again. == Description == It is a one-storey building.
