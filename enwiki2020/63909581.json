    "text": "\u1e0cha (also romanized as Ddha) is a consonant of Indic abugidas. In modern Indic scripts, \u1e0cha is derived from the early \"Ashoka\" Brahmi letter ng after having gone through the Gupta letter 13px. As with the other cerebral consonants, \u1e0dha is not found in most scripts for Tai, Sino-Tibetan, and other non-Indic languages, except for a few scripts, which retain these letters for transcribing Sanskrit religious terms. ==\u0100ryabha\u1e6da numeration== Aryabhata used Devanagari letters for numbers, very similar to the Greek numerals, even after the invention of Indian numerals. The values of the different forms of \u0922 are: *\u0922 = 14 (\u0967\u096a) *\u0922\u093f = 1,400 (\u0967 \u096a\u0966\u0966) *\u0922\u0941 = 140,000 (\u0967 \u096a\u0966 \u0966\u0966\u0966) *\u0922\u0943 = 14,000,000 (\u0967 \u096a\u0966 \u0966\u0966 \u0966\u0966\u0966) *\u0922\u0962 = 1,400,000,000 (\u0967 \u096a\u0966 \u0966\u0966 \u0966\u0966 \u0966\u0966\u0966) *\u0922\u0947 = 14 (\u0967\u096a\u00d7\u0967\u0966\u0967\u0966) *\u0922\u0948 = 14 (\u0967\u096a\u00d7\u0967\u0966\u0967\u0968) *\u0922\u094b = 14 (\u0967\u096a\u00d7\u0967\u0966\u0967\u096a) *\u0922\u094c = 14 (\u0967\u096a\u00d7\u0967\u0966\u0967\u096c) ==Historic Ddha== There are three different general early historic scripts - Brahmi and its variants, Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b, and Tocharian, the so-called slanting Brahmi. Ddha as found in standard Brahmi, Ddha was a simple geometric shape, with variations toward more flowing forms by the Gupta Ddha. The Tocharian Ddha Ddha did not have an alterante Fremdzeichen form. The third form of ddha, in Kharoshthi (Ddha) was probably derived from Aramaic separately from the Brahmi letter. ===Brahmi Ddha=== The Brahmi letter Ddha, Ddha, is probably derived from the altered Aramaic Dalet 13px, and is thus related to the modern Latin D and Greek Delta. Several identifiable styles of writing the Brahmi Ddha can be found, most associated with a specific set of inscriptions from an artifact or diverse records from an historic period.Evolutionary chart, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal Vol 7, 1838 As the earliest and most geometric style of Brahmi, the letters found on the Edicts of Ashoka and other records from around that time are normally the reference form for Brahmi letters, with vowel marks not attested until later forms of Brahmi back-formed to match the geometric writing style. {|class=\"wikitable\" |+Brahmi Ddha historic forms |- !Ashoka (3rd-1st c.

It ultimately arose from the Brahmi letter ka, after having gone through the Gupta letter 13px. Letters that derive from it are the Gujarati letter \u0aa2, and the Modi letter \ud805\ude1b. ===Devanagari-using Languages=== In all languages, \u0922 is pronounced as or when appropriate. Like all Indic scripts, Devanagari uses vowel marks attached to the base consonant to override the inherent /\u0259/ vowel: {|class=\"wikitable\" |+ Devanagari \u0922 with vowel marks |- ! \u1e0cha !! \u1e0ch\u0101 !! \u1e0chi !! \u1e0ch\u012b !! \u1e0chu !! \u1e0ch\u016b !! \u1e0chr !! \u1e0chr\u0304 !! \u1e0chl !! \u1e0chl\u0304 !! \u1e0che !! \u1e0chai !! \u1e0cho !! \u1e0chau !! \u1e0ch |-style=\"font-size: 150%;\" |\u0922 |\u0922\u093e |\u0922\u093f |\u0922\u0940 |\u0922\u0941 |\u0922\u0942 |\u0922\u0943 |\u0922\u0944 |\u0922\u0962 |\u0922\u0963 |\u0922\u0947 |\u0922\u0948 |\u0922\u094b |\u0922\u094c |\u0922\u094d |} ===Conjuncts with \u0922=== Devanagari exhibits conjunct ligatures, as is common in Indic scripts. In modern Devanagari texts, most conjuncts are formed by reducing the letter shape to fit tightly to the following letter, usually by dropping a character's vertical stem, sometimes referred to as a \"half form\". Some conjunct clusters are always represented by a true ligature, instead of a shape that can be broken into constituent independent letters. Vertically stacked conjuncts are ubiquitous in older texts, while only a few are still used routinely in modern Devanagari texts. \u1e0cha however, does not have a vertical stem to drop for making a half form, and either forms a stacked conjunct/ligature, or uses its full form with Virama. The use of ligatures and vertical conjuncts may vary across languages using the Devanagari script, with Marathi in particular preferring the use of half forms where texts in other languages would show ligatures and vertical stacks. ====Ligature conjuncts of \u0922==== True ligatures are quite rare in Indic scripts. The most common ligated conjuncts in Devanagari are in the form of a slight mutation to fit in context or as a consistent variant form appended to the adjacent characters. Those variants include Na and the Repha and Rakar forms of Ra. Nepali and Marathi texts use the \"eyelash\" Ra half form Ra for an initial \"R\" instead of repha. * \u0930\u09cd (r) + \u0922 (\u1e0d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature r\u1e0d\u02b1a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0930 (ra) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1ra: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0928 (na) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1na: 100px * \u092a\u09cd (p) + \u0922 (\u1e0d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature p\u1e0d\u02b1a: 100px * \u0937\u09cd (\u1e63) + \u0922 (\u1e0d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature \u1e63\u1e0d\u02b1a: 100px ====Stacked conjuncts of \u0922==== Vertically stacked ligatures are the most common conjunct forms found in Devanagari text. Although the constituent characters may need to be stretched and moved slightly in order to stack neatly, stacked conjuncts can be broken down into recognizable base letters, or a letter and an otherwise standard ligature. * \u091b\u09cd (c\u02b0) + \u0922 (\u1e0d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature c\u02b0\u1e0d\u02b1a: 100px * \u0921\u09cd (\u1e0d) + \u0922 (\u1e0d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u1e0d\u02b1a: 100px * \u0926\u09cd (d) + \u0922 (\u1e0d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature d\u1e0d\u02b1a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u092c (ba) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1ba: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u092d (b\u02b0a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1b\u02b0a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u091a (ca) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1ca: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u091b (c\u02b0a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1c\u02b0a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0926 (da) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1da: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0921 (\u1e0da) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1\u1e0da: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0922 (\u1e0d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1\u1e0d\u02b1a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0927 (d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1d\u02b1a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0917 (ga) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1ga: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0918 (\u0261\u02b1a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1\u0261\u02b1a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0939 (ha) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1ha: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u091c (ja) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1ja: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u091d (j\u02b0a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1j\u02b0a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u091c\u09cd (j) + \u091e (\u00f1a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1j\u00f1a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0915 (ka) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1ka: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0916 (k\u02b0a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1k\u02b0a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0915\u09cd (k) + \u0937 (\u1e63a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1k\u1e63a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0932 (la) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1la: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0933 (\u1e37a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1\u1e37a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u092e (ma) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1ma: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0919 (\u014ba) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1\u014ba: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0923 (\u1e47a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1\u1e47a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u091e (\u00f1a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1\u00f1a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u092a (pa) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1pa: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u092b (p\u02b0a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1p\u02b0a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0938 (sa) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1sa: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0936 (\u0283a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1\u0283a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0937 (\u1e63a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1\u1e63a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0924 (ta) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1ta: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0925 (t\u02b0a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1t\u02b0a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u091f (\u1e6da) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1\u1e6da: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0920 (\u1e6d\u02b0a) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1\u1e6d\u02b0a: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u0935 (va) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1va: 100px * \u0922\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u092f (ya) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1ya: 100px * \u0919\u09cd (\u014b) + \u0922 (\u1e0d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature \u014b\u1e0d\u02b1a: 100px * \u091f\u09cd (\u1e6d) + \u0922 (\u1e0d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature \u1e6d\u1e0d\u02b1a: 100px * \u0920\u09cd (\u1e6d\u02b0) + \u0922 (\u1e0d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature \u1e6d\u02b0\u1e0d\u02b1a: 100px ==Bengali Ddha== The Bengali script \u09a2 is derived from the Siddha\u1e43 13px, and is marked by a similar horizontal head line, but less geometric shape, than its Devanagari counterpart, \u0922. The inherent vowel of Bengali consonant letters is /\u0254/, so the bare letter \u09a2 will sometimes be transliterated as \"ddho\" instead of \"ddha\". Adding okar, the \"o\" vowel mark, gives a reading of /d\u0333\u02b1o/. Like all Indic consonants, \u09a2 can be modified by marks to indicate another (or no) vowel than its inherent \"a\". {|class=\"wikitable\" |+ Bengali \u09a2 with vowel marks |- ! ddha !! ddh\u0101 !! ddhi !! ddh\u012b !! ddhu !! ddh\u016b !! ddhr !! ddhr\u0304 !! ddhe !! ddhai !! ddho !! ddhau !! ddh |-style=\"font-size: 150%;\" |\u09a2 |\u09a2\u09be |\u09a2\u09bf |\u09a2\u09c0 |\u09a2\u09c1 |\u09a2\u09c2 |\u09a2\u09c3 |\u09a2\u09c4 |\u09a2\u09c7 |\u09a2\u09c8 |\u09a2\u09cb |\u09a2\u09cc |\u09a2\u09cd |} ===\u09a2 in Bengali-using languages=== \u09a2 is used as a basic consonant character in all of the major Bengali script orthographies, including Bengali and Assamese. ===Conjuncts with \u09a2=== Bengali \u09a2 exhibits a few conjunct ligatures, as is common in Indic scripts. * \u09a2\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u09b0 (ra) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1ra, with the ra phala suffix: 100px * \u09a2\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u09af (ya) gives us the ligature \u1e0d\u02b1ya, with the ya phala suffix: 100px * \u09a3\u09cd (\u1e47) + \u09a2 (\u1e0d\u02b1a) gives us the ligature \u1e47\u1e0d\u02b1a: 100px * \u09b0\u09cd (r) + \u09a2\u09cd (\u1e0d\u02b1) + \u09af (ya) gives us the ligature r\u1e0d\u02b1ya, with the repha prefix and ya phala suffix: 100px ==Javanese Ddha== ==References== Category:Indic letters ",
