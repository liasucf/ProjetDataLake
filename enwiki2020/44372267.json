    "text": "The 1952 IRFU College Draft was an unofficial sports draft held by the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union, a predecessor of the East Division of the Canadian Football League, in the spring of 1952. The concept was first developed at a meeting between Eastern officials on April 6, 1952. In the meeting, the delegates agreed, in principle, that eligible college athletes would be selected by member clubs with the last place team selecting first in each round. While the draft was unofficial, players selected in this draft were indeed added to the rosters of the clubs that had drafted them. 17 players were chosen from among eligible players from five eastern universities, McGill University, Queen's University, University of Toronto, University of Western Ontario, and McMaster University.Draft History The Montreal Alouettes had the first selection, as well as the most, since they also had the last selection. ==Round one== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%\" |- !style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\" width=7%| Pick # !!width=40% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| CFL Team !!width=20% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| Player !!width=13% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| Position !!width=20% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| College |- |align=center| 1 || Montreal Alouettes || Harry Lampman || E || Queen's |- |align=center| 2 || Toronto Argonauts || Marsh Haymes || G || Toronto |- |align=center| 3 || Hamilton Tiger-Cats || Bill Berezowski || C/G || McMaster |- |align=center| 4 || Ottawa Rough Riders || Bob Garside || HB || Toronto |} ==Round two== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%\" |- !style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\" width=7%| Pick # !!width=40% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| CFL Team !!width=20% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| Player !!width=13% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| Position !!width=20% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| College |- |align=center| 5 || Montreal Alouettes || Dawson Tilley || G/T || McGill |- |align=center| 6 || Toronto Argonauts || Al Dancey || C || Toronto |- |align=center| 7 || Hamilton Tiger-Cats || Mel Hawkrigg || HB || McMaster |- |align=center| 8 || Ottawa Rough Riders || Walt Bashak || G/T || McMaster |} ==Round three== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%\" |- !style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\" width=7%| Pick # !!width=40% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| CFL Team !!width=20% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| Player !!width=13% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| Position !!width=20% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| College |- |align=center| 9 || Montreal Alouettes || Gene Robillard || HB/QB || McGill |- |align=center| 10 || Toronto Argonauts || Ross McKelvey || HB || Queen's |- |align=center| 11 || Hamilton Tiger-Cats || Bob McMonagle || HB ||Western Ontario |- |align=center| 12 || Ottawa Rough Riders || Alex Lawson || E/QB || Toronto |} ==Round four== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%\" |- !style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\" width=7%| Pick # !!width=40% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| CFL Team !!width=20% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| Player !!width=13% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| Position !!width=20% style=\"background:#A8BDEC;\"| College |- |align=center| 13 || Montreal Alouettes || Bob McLelland || G/T || McGill |- |align=center| 14 || Toronto Argonauts || Jack Roberts || G/T || Toronto |- |align=center| 15 || Hamilton Tiger-Cats || Gerry Fitzgerald || E || Western Ontario |- |align=center| 16 || Ottawa Rough Riders || Al Brown || E || Toronto |- |align=center| 17 || Montreal Alouettes || Ken Wagner || HB || McGill |} ==References== Category:Canadian College Draft Category:1952 in Canadian football ",
