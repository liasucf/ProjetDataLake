    "text": "Nephilengys papuana is a species of araneid spider. N. papuana with egg sac and spiderlings The species was previously included in Nephilengys malabarensis as the subspecies N. m. papuana, but is now recognized as a separate species. Female body length is about 17 mm, male length less than 5 mm. Male spiders apparently self-emasculate after copulation. > \"At least in Nephilengys, this strategy enables remote copulation, a > continuation of sperm transfer after males are detached from copula, which > is an additional mechanism to secure eunuch paternity (Li et al. 2012). > Although Nephilengys papuana eunuchs have not been subject to experimental > testing, early research reported incidents of post-mating emasculation in > this species (Robinson and Robinson 1980) and thus its behavior is likely to > closely resemble that of its sister species.\"Kuntner, Matja\u017e, et al. \"Eunuch > supremacy: evolution of post-mating spider emasculation.\" Behavioral Ecology > and Sociobiology 69.1 (2015): 117-126. ==Name== The species name is derived from Papua. ==Distribution== The species occurs in New Guinea and tropical Australia (Queensland). ==References== Category:Araneidae Category:Spiders of Asia Category:Spiders of Australia Category:Arthropods of New Guinea Category:Spiders described in 1881 ",
