    "text": "Oswego is an unincorporated community in Valley County, Montana, United States. It is located along U.S. Route 2 between the cities of Frazer and Wolf Point. Oswego is located on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. ==History== Settled sometime in the 1890s, the village was named after Oswego, New York, the hometown of some early-day settlers. A post office was located there from 1896 until 1971. On September 11, 1971 one of the worst prairie fires in northeastern Montana destroyed much of Oswego, leaving only 4 homes untouched. The entire population of Oswego was forced to evacuate, and of those 75 residents only about 40 of them returned to live and rebuild. ==References== ==External links== *MTLinks - Oswego, Montana Category:Unincorporated communities in Montana Category:Unincorporated communities in Valley County, Montana ",
