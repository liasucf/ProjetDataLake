    "text": "Joseph Haydn's Piano Trio No. 41 in E-flat minor, Hob. XV/31, was written in 1795/1796, though not published until 1803 in Vienna. It has the nickname \"Jacob's Dream\" because of its second movement. On publication it was dedicated to Magdalena von Kurzb\u00f6ck (1767\u20131845), a Viennese pianist and composer.Brauner, J\u00fcrgen: Studien zu den Klaviertrios von Joseph Haydn. W\u00fcrzburg. 1995. (pp. 302\u2013306, pp. 348\u2013357) The trio is in two movements, which were composed in reverse order: the second in 1795 and the first a year later:Robert Philip, Notes to Hyperion CD CDA67757 (2009) 1\\. Andante cantabile. This long and contemplative movement combines the features of variations and rondo.'Haydn, Piano Trios Volume 1', reviewed by Oleg Ledeniov, MusicWeb International, December 2011 It is notable for its use of piano chords deep in the bass register, influenced by the sonorous English pianos Haydn came to appreciate while in London. 2\\. Allegro (ben moderato). This short and cheerful movement (in sharp contrast to the first) has the scheme A\u2013B\u2013A\u2013Coda. Unusually, the violin takes a more important role than the piano. The nickname \"Jacob's Dream\" comes from Haydn's inscription on the original manuscript, later removed.Joseph Haydn, Piano Trio No. 41 in E-flat minor, Hob. XV:31 Holograph manuscript, 1795, via IMSLP This reads: Jacob's Dream! by Dr. Haydn. It refers to the biblical story of Jacob's Ladder ascending to heaven, as the movement features difficult passages in the upper register of the violin. Haydn intended this as a practical joke directed at a German violinist who had particular difficulties playing high notes. Haydn sent the movement to the pianist Therese Jansen who played it with the violinist, to comic effect.Albert Christoph Dies, Biographical Accounts of Joseph Haydn, Vienna, 1810 ==See also== *List of piano trios by Joseph Haydn *Haydn and folk music ==References== ==External links== * * *, Beaux Arts Trio: Menahem Pressler (piano), Isidore Cohen (violin), Bernard Greenhouse (violoncello) 41 Category:Music dedicated to ensembles or performers Category:1796 compositions Category:Compositions in E-flat minor ",
