The name derives from the high iron content of the water. The iron was supposed to come from a small tributary which rinsed iron out of Langenfelde meadows into former Isebek.Horst Beckershaus: Die Hamburger Stra\u00dfennamen. Woher sie kommen und was sie bedeuten, 5. ed., Hamburg 2002 Originally, the stream flowed from its source near Bahrenfeld into the pond of Diebsteich (which was located at the street of Kieler Stra\u00dfe) and from there into the Alster. The street names Isebekstra\u00dfe and Isebekstieg (near today Diebsteich station) remind of the former stream. ==References== Category:Canals in Hamburg Category:Eimsb\u00fcttel Category:Hamburg-Nord CIsebekkanal ",
