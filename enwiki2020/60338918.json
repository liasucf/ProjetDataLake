Page at the Weblio.jp site, accessed on 2019-03-26. is a small river in the towns of K\u014dta and Nishio in the Aichi Prefecture, Japan. The K\u014dda river starts in K\u014dta about 4 km southwest of the town hall, makes a broad loop through K\u014dta and Nishio (towards east, north, west, and southwest), runs alongside the Yahagifuru River in Nishio for about 6 km, and finally joins it at about .Google Maps \" Kota River, Aichi, Japan\".Accessed on 019-03-26. The town changed its name from K\u014dda (\u5e83\u7530) to K\u014dta (\u5e78\u7530) in 1954, and for that reason, the river is sometimes called K\u014dta too. The transliterations as Koda, Kouda, Kota, or Kouta may also occur, with or without the Japanese suffix gawa (\"river\"). (Moreover, the kanji \u5e83\u7530 can also be read as Hirota, and this misreading seems to be commonly made by automatic translators.) ==References== Category:Rivers of Aichi Prefecture Category:Rivers of Japan ",
