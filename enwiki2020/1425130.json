    "text": "In chemistry the term stannate refers to compounds of tin (Sn). Stannic acid (Sn(OH)4), the formal precursor to stannates, does not exist and is actually a hydrate of SnO2. The term is also used in naming conventions as a suffix for example the hexachlorostannate ion is . In materials science, two kinds of tin oxyanions are distinguished: *orthostannates contain discrete units (e.g. K4SnO4) or have a spinel structure (e.g. Mg2SnO4) *metastannates with a stoichiometry MIISnO3, MSnO3 which may contain polymeric anions or may be sometimes better described as mixed oxides These materials are semiconductors.\"Preparation, characterization and structure of metal stannates: a new family of photocatalysts for organic pollutants degradation.\" Handbook of Photocatalysts (2010), pp. 493\u2013510.
