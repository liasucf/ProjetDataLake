He later co-founded LLEGO (Latina/o Lesbian and Gay Organization) in California as well as National LLEGO, which were both organizations dedicated to the overall empowerment of all who were a part of the greater LGBT community.

TWAATF was founded in 1985 in an effort to address the distinct ways men of color accessed AIDS prevention and treatment resources. This included an understanding of \"the historical reality of racial discrimination in gay institutions,\" venues that AIDS service organizations like SFAF mainly targeted. Their mission was to \"[assist] existing AIDS organizations with providing educational material that is relevant, culturally sensitive, and can be understood by our communities\". === San Francisco City Clinic === Tavera worked at the San Francisco City Clinic as an HIV/AIDS interventions specialist.From the description of Hank M.
