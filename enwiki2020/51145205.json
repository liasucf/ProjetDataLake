    "text": "Montigyra is a monotypic genus of stony coral which is a type of coral that lives on the seabed and builds a hard skeleton. It is represented by a single species, Montigyra kenti. Like all coral, this one is composed of animals called polyps, and the polyps of this species are large compared to those of other coral. ==Description== It has a hemispherical and submeandroid skeleton with groups of septa fused into monticules or hydnophores, a trait typically attributed to Hydnophora. Its septae are thin and compact. ==Distribution & habitat== Its habitat is not recorded. The genus Montigyra and species Montigyra kenti are both described from a single specimen found in northwest Australia. It was collected in turbid water. == References == Category:Scleractinia genera Category:Monotypic cnidarian genera Category:Euphylliidae ",
