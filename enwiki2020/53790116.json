Its charter provided that no student could be refused admission \u201con account of the religious opinions he may entertain.\u201d Three Jesuit instructors and 22 students, all males mostly from Boston's marginalized Irish Catholic immigrant community, made up the college when it opened its doors on September 5, 1864.https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/publications/factbook/pdf/03_04/2003_04_brief_history.pdf Robert Fulton, S.J., an alumnus of Georgetown University, served as Morrissey College's first dean and later president.https://library.bc.edu/finding- aids/BC1986-020B-finding-aid.pdf Nine students received A.B. degrees, the first bachelor's degrees awarded, in 1877.http://bcm.bc.edu/index.html%3Fp=788.html Morrissey College was originally located in the block between Harrison Avenue and James Street in Boston's South End neighborhood. It shared quarters with its preparatory school, Boston College High School that became separately incorporated in 1927. By the turn of the century, the college had outgrown its urban setting and a new location was selected in mostly rural Chestnut Hill. The Boston firm of Maginnis and Walsh broke ground at the highest point of Chestnut Hill on June 19, 1909, for the construction of Gasson Hall. It was the first of several buildings designed in one of the earliest examples of collegiate gothic architecture in North America. Claver, Loyola, and Xavier were the first residential halls constructed on the university's upper campus in 1955.https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/files/publications/factbook/pdf/98_99/fb99mission- history.pdf Boston College remained an exclusively liberal arts institution, with emphasis on the Greek and Latin classics, English and modern languages, philosophy and religion, for the first several decades after its founding. In 1925, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences was formed, followed by programs at the doctoral level in 1952, establishing Boston College's role as a leading research university. In September 1933, Casper Augustus Ferguson enrolled in Morrissey College and four years later became the first black student to graduate from Boston College.https://bcheights.com/magazine/index.php/2019/my-presence-here-does- not-mean-anything/ By 1970 all Boston College undergraduate programs, including at Morrissey College, had become coeducational. Stokes Hall, a humanities building that houses several arts and sciences departments, was completed in 2013.https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/03/11/name-college- arts-and-sciences-after-donor-morrissey/9mhi6E4vivrHxDuVSzuG5L/story.html In 2015, the School of Arts & Sciences and Graduate School of Arts & Sciences were renamed Morrissey College of Arts & Sciences in honor of benefactor and alumnus Robert J.
