    "text": "Mary Ann Hoberman is an American author of over 30 children's books. == Biography == === Early life === Hoberman was born in August 1930, in Stamford, Connecticut, but because her father changed jobs frequently, her family moved to New York City, New Jersey, New Haven, Connecticut, and eventually back to Stamford. Hoberman had a love for books from a young age, although she had few growing up during the Great Depression. In high school, Hoberman worked on the school's newspaper and was the editor of the yearbook. The first woman in her family to attend college, Hoberman attended Smith College, majoring in History, where she worked on the school's newspaper. During her senior year at Smith College, she married Norman Hoberman. Their son Chuck Hoberman invented the Hoberman sphere === Professional life === Hoberman co-founded a children\u2019s theatre group called \u201cThe Pocket People\u201d, as well as a group that performed dramatized poetry readings called \u201cWomen\u2019s Voice\u201d before she published her first book, All My Shoes Come in Twos, in 1957. Many of Hoberman's books have been reviewed in multiple Academic Journals, Magazines, and Trade Publications. From elementary to college level, Hoberman has visited schools and libraries throughout the country to teach literature and writing. One of Hoberman\u2019s main concerns is literacy, which she furthers not only through her volunteer work with Literacy Volunteers of America, but also through her You Read to Me, I\u2019ll Read to You series. In 2003, Hoberman was named the second US Children\u2019s Poet Laureate (now called the Young People's Poet Laureate) by the Poetry Foundation, where she served from 2008 to 2011. Hoberman currently lives in Greenwich, Connecticut and has four children and five grandchildren with her husband Norman. == Awards == *1978 National Book Award (A House Is a House for Me) *2003 National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) Award for Excellence in Poetry for Children * 2004 National Outdoor Book Award (Whose Garden Is It?) == Books == === Author === * All My Shoes Come in Twos (1957) * How Do I Go?
