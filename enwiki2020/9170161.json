    "text": "Tr\u00e4d, Gr\u00e4s & Stenar (\"Trees, Grass and Stones\") is a Swedish rock band formed in 1969, from previous incarnations P\u00e4rson Sound, International Harvester and Harvester. The group was one of the front acts of the Swedish progg scene, although noticeably less political than their contemporary counterparts. Their sound has been described as raw, psych rock jam, by the writer David Pescovitz, who also notes the band would invite their audiences to improvise and collaborate. ==Background== ===P\u00e4rson Sound, International Harvester and Harvester=== The band P\u00e4rson Sound was formed during the summer of 1967 by members of progg band Mecki Mark Men. Then original line up consisted of Bo Anders Persson (guitar), Thomas Tidholm (vocals, saxophone, flute), Arne Ericsson (cello), Urban Yman (violin), Torbj\u00f6rn Abelli (bass) and Thomas Mera Gartz (drums). Inspired by the minimalist music of Terry Riley, the plan explored drones, heavy repetition and use of tape loops. This constellation, which were playing an experimental style of psychedelic rock never released any official records, although a collection of recordings from 1967-1968 were released as the double CD P\u00e4rson Sound (1967-68) in 2001 and as a 3 LP deluxe box set on the record label,Subliminal Sounds in 2010. In August 1968 the band changed their name to \"International Harvester\" and later the same year their debut album Sov gott Rose-Marie was released. In 1969 the name was shortened to \"Harvester\", under which the album Hem\u00e5t was released. In addition to music, the band was involved with Happenings, art and theater as part of a larger group collective. ===Tr\u00e4d, Gr\u00e4s & Stenar=== In the summer of 1969 the band reformed as Tr\u00e4d, Gr\u00e4s & Stenar, now consisting of Bo Anders Persson, Torbj\u00f6rn Abelli, Arne Ericsson and Thomas Mera Gartz. 1970 saw the release of their self-titled debut Tr\u00e4d, Gr\u00e4s & Stenar, sometimes called \"the green album\", which included cover versions of Bob Dylan's \"All Along the Watchtower\" and The Rolling Stones' hit song \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\". Thomas Tidholm left the band before recording began, as he deemed the new material too commercial. Tr\u00e4d, Gr\u00e4s & Stenar, then consisting of Bo Anders Persson, Torbj\u00f6rn Abelli, Thomas Mera Gartz, and Jakob Sj\u00f6holm, toured the United States in 2004 and 2005. Reine Fiske joined in 2008, on guitar. Abelli and Gartz died in 2010 and 2012, respectively, and were replaced by Sigge Krantz (bass, 2010) and Nisse T\u00f6rnqvist (drums, 2012). Tr\u00e4d, Gr\u00e4s & Stenar, now consisting of Jakob Sj\u00f6holm (guitar), Reine Fiske (guitar), Sigge Krantz (bass), and Hanna \u00d6sterberg (drums), are touring as Tr\u00e4den in Scandinavia and the United States in 2018. ==Discography== ===As \"P\u00e4rson Sound\"=== * P\u00e4rson Sound (1967\u201368) (CD \u2013 2001) * P\u00e4rson Sound 3 LP Box Set (LP \u2013 2010) ===As \"International Harvester\"=== * Sov gott Rose-Marie (LP \u2013 1968) ===As \"Harvester\"=== * Hem\u00e5t (LP \u2013 1969) ===Tr\u00e4d, Gr\u00e4s & Stenar=== * Tr\u00e4d, Gr\u00e4s & Stenar (1970 \u2013 LP; reissued by Anthology Recordings with bonus tracks) * Djungelns Lag (The Law of the Jungle) (live; 1971 \u2013 LP; reissued 2016 by Anthology Recordings with bonus tracks) * Rock f\u00f6r Kropp och Sj\u00e4l (1972 \u2013 LP) * Mors Mors (Hi, How Are You?)
