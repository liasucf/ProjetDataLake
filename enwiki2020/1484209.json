Retrieved on 6 December 2008. is a poem by Lord Byron first published in 1815 in his Hebrew Melodies (in which it was titled The Destruction of Semnacherib).Ashton (1972), p. 180 The poem is based on the biblical account of the historical Assyrian siege of Jerusalem in 701 BC by Assyrian king Sennacherib, as described in the Bible (2 Kings 18\u201319, Isaiah 36\u201337). . The rhythm of the poem has a feel of the beat of a galloping horse's hooves (an anapestic tetrameter) as the Assyrian rides into battle.Paul Fussell (1979), Poetic Meter and Poetic Form. ==Biblical story== Jerusalem Delivered from Sennacherib, 1860 woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld The poem relates to the Biblical account of Sennacherib's attempted siege of Jerusalem. According to the Bible record in 2 Kings 18:13, the Assyrian army came \"against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took them.\" When the Assyrians were besieging Jerusalem, Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah in the Temple, and Isaiah sent the reply from Jehovah to Hezekiah: \"I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David's sake\" (2 Kings 19:34), and during the following night the Angel of the Lord () \"smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand\" (i.e. 185,000), so by morning most of the Assyrian army was found \"as dead corpses\u201d (2 Kings 19:35), and Sennacherib went back to Nineveh. The Assyrian annals do mention tribute paid by Hezekiah to Sennacherib (as recorded in 2 Kings 18), and the Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem (dated 701 BC), but omits any mention of its failure or the loss of the army. ==Reception== The poem was popular in Victorian England and, when the first Australian cricket team to tour England defeated a strong MCC team, including W G Grace, at Lord's on 27 May 1878, the satirical magazine Punch celebrated by publishing a parody of the poem including a wry commentary on Grace's contribution: ::The Australians came down like a wolf on the fold, ::The Marylebone cracks for a trifle were bowled; ::Our Grace before dinner was very soon done, ::And Grace after dinner did not get a run.Altham, p.135. Mark Twain has references to this poem throughout his works, from his early newspaper sketches to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and it is mentioned often in biographies of him, making it clear that it was important to him.twainquotes.com. Retrieved on 6 December 2008. Ogden Nash's \"Very Like a Whale\", a humorous complaint about poetical metaphors, uses this poem for its inspiration: ::...Now then, this particular Assyrian, the one whose cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold, ::Just what does the poet mean when he says he came down like a wolf on the fold? ::In heaven and earth more than is dreamed of in our philosophy there are great many things. ::But I don't imagine that among them there is a wolf with purple and gold cohorts or purple and gold anythings. ::No, no, Lord Byron, before I'll believe that this Assyrian was actually like a wolf I must have some kind of proof; ::Did he run on all fours and did he have a hairy tail and a big red mouth and big white teeth and did he say Woof Woof?... The poem was memorably translated into Russian by Count Aleksey K. Tolstoy in 1858. ==In popular culture== * The character Pam Poovey in the animated sitcom Archer has the poem's third stanza tattooed on her back. * Sara Paretsky's short story \"The Case of the Pietro Andromache\" refers to the poem. \"A touch here, a word there, and the guests disappeared like the hosts of Sennacherib. ==References== ==Sources== Ashton, Thomas L.
