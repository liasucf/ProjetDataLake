    "text": "Renee Ginsberg Rabinowitz (1934- May 19, 2020) was an American-Israeli psychologist and lawyer. She was born to an Orthodox Jewish family in Belgium, but fled with her family to the United States in 1941, following the outbreak of World War II, and grew up in New York City. She earned a doctorate in educational psychology at the University of Chicago, and a law degree at Notre Dame University. She taught psychology at Indiana University, and later served as in-house legal counsel at Colorado College. In 2016, Rabinowitz was included in the BBC 100 Women list of most influential women. In 2017, she successfully sued El Al, after the airline forced her to move her seat on a Newark\u2013Tel Aviv flight at the request of a Haredi Jewish man who refused to sit beside her due to his religious beliefs. == Early life and education == Rabinowitz was born in Belgium in 1934. Her family fled The Holocaust in 1941 to the United States. She grew up in New York City, before leaving the city to attend the University of Chicago, where she earned masters and doctoral degrees in educational psychology. Her 1969 Master's thesis was titled, The perceived locus of control of reinforcements among sixth-grade Negro children. Her 1974 dissertation was titled, Personal Causation, Role-Taking, and Effectiveness with Peers: A Study of Social Competence in Elementary School Children. She also earned a law degree from Notre Dame Law School. == Career == Rabinowitz taught psychology at Indiana University. She later served as in- house legal counsel at Colorado College, and as a professional volunteer at the Israel Center for the Treatment of Psychotrauma. ==El Al discrimination lawsuit== In December 2015, Rabinowitz was flying business class on an El Al flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Tel Aviv, Israel. After being seated next to a Haredi Jewish man, the man complained to an onboard flight attendant that he did not want to sit next to a woman because of his religious beliefs. As a result, Rabinowitz was forced to move seats. After speaking to Anat Hoffman, director of the Israel Religious Action Center (IRAC), the organization filed a court case on her behalf for unlawful discrimination. IRAC represented Rabinowitz at the trial. In June 2017, Rabinowitz was awarded 6,500 shekels (about $1,800). The trial also ruled that El Al's practice of requiring unwilling passengers to accommodate Haredi religious mores violated the country's Prohibition of Discrimination in Products law. The court required El Al to update its policy within six months to comply with Israeli discrimination law. After the verdict, IRAC lawyer Riki Shapira Rosenberg said they expected this to be extended to other airlines. === Related incidents === In 2018, the Israel Religious Action Center attempted to run an advertising campaign reminding Israeli women that they were not required to change seats at the request of men. The proposed advertisements were blocked by the authorities. In the same year, NICE Ltd. CEO Barak Eilam criticised El Al after they forced women to move seats at the request of Haredi men. Speaking about the incident, IRAC said that the incident was a violation of Rabinowitz's court decision. ==Personal life== Rabinowitz had three children from her first marriage. She was divorced from her first husband in 1986, and married Rabbi Stanley M. Wagner of Denver, Colorado, in November 1990. She gained two stepchildren through her marriage to Wagner. Rabinowitz and Wagner made Aliyah to Israel in 2006, but frequently visited the United States. She lived the final years of her life in an assisted-living facility in Jerusalem. Rabinowitz died on May 19, 2020, in Jerusalem. == Awards and honors == In 2016, Rabinowitz was included in the BBC 100 Women list of most influential women. == Selected works == * * ==References== Category:Belgian women lawyers Category:1934 births Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Holocaust survivors Category:20th-century Belgian women Category:Belgian emigrants to the United States Category:20th-century Belgian lawyers Category:21st-century Belgian lawyers Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:21st-century American lawyers Category:Indiana University faculty Category:20th-century psychologists Category:21st-century psychologists Category:American women psychologists Category:Belgian psychologists Category:20th-century Israeli lawyers Category:21st-century Israeli lawyers Category:Colorado College faculty Category:Notre Dame Law School alumni Category:Lawyers from New York City Category:American emigrants to Israel Category:Israeli people of Belgian-Jewish descent Category:Israeli people of American-Jewish descent Category:American people of Belgian-Jewish descent Category:People with acquired American citizenship Category:Naturalized citizens of Israel Category:Israeli psychologists Category:20th-century Israeli women Category:21st-century Israeli women Category:20th-century American women Category:21st-century American women Category:21st-century Belgian women Category:BBC 100 Women Category:Jewish American social scientists Category:2020 deaths Category:20th-century American women lawyers Category:21st-century American women lawyers ",
