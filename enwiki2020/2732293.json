    "text": "The former Royal Air Force Germany (RAFG) was a command of the Royal Air Force and part of British Forces Germany. It consisted of units located in Germany, initially as part of the occupation following the Second World War, and later as part of the RAF's commitment to the defence of Europe during the Cold War. The commander of RAFG doubled as commander of NATO's Second Allied Tactical Air Force. ==History== Hawker Hunter F.6 in No. 4 Squadron RAF colours at Luftwaffe Museum, Gatow-Berlin Phantom FGR Mk 2 of No. 92 Squadron landing at RAF Wildenrath in the mid-1980s From 1954 Canberra bombers equipped 69 (briefly), 102, 103, 104, 149 Squadrons, and later 59 Squadron at RAF G\u00fctersloh. This force was under Bomber Command control from Britain and had been moved to Germany because of overcrowding of suitable airfields in the UK. With the establishment of the British nuclear bomber forces in the context of NATO's strategy of massive retaliation the Canberra bomber squadrons were again withdrawn from Germany. After 1955, the majority of the airfields were handed over to the newly established German Air Force and RAF B\u00fcckeburg to the army of the German Armed Forces. The number of RAF squadrons were reduced. This was both because of the nuclear strategy of NATO and for financial reasons after the fiasco of the Suez crisis. From 1 January 1959 the command was officially called Royal Air Force Germany, the RAF Second Tactical Air Force (2TAF) renamed. At this time the focus was the flying units already on just six main use airfields RAF Bruggen, RAF Geilenkirchen, RAF Gutersloh, RAF Jever (No. 2 Squadron, Swifts), RAF Laarbruch and RAF Wildenrath. Important aircraft types at this time were the Canberra as night fighting-suited fighter bombers to three and the Hunter as a day fighter stationed at two airports. From 1960 around the clock there were two on alert Canberra loaded with tactical nuclear weapons who were ready within 15 minutes. In addition there were two seasons that the Swift used them as scouts and four squadrons of Gloster Javelin all-weather interceptors. Two English Electric Lightning squadrons - No. 92 Squadron RAF and No. 19 Squadron RAF - arrived in Germany from 1965. RAF Jever was transferred in 1961 and RAF Geilenkirchen in 1968, reducing the command to four flying airfields. When Geilenkirchen closed, it appears there were two flying squadrons at the station. No. 3 Squadron RAF moved to RAF Laarbruch and No. 92 Squadron RAF moved to RAF Gutersloh. RAF Germany was disbanded as a separate command in 1993 as part of the reduction of British Armed Forces presence in Europe at the cessation of the Cold War. The remaining RAF forces in Germany ceased to be a separate command, and instead became No 2 Group RAF, part of RAF Strike Command. No 2 Group was then disbanded on 1 April 1996 by being absorbed into No 1 Group RAF. == Flying units in 1989 == * Royal Air Force Germany, RAF Rheindahlen, doubles as commander of NATO's Second Allied Tactical Air Force ** 4 Wing, administrative control of RAF Regiment Rapier squadrons based in West Germany ** 33 Wing, administrative control of RAF Regiment Light Armour squadrons based in West Germany ** RAF Bruggen, FRG *** No. 9 Squadron, 12\u00d7 Tornado GR.1note 1 *** No. 14 Squadron, 12\u00d7 Tornado GR.1note 1 *** No. 17 Squadron, 12\u00d7 Tornado GR.1note 1 *** No. 31 Squadron, 12\u00d7 Tornado GR.1note 1 *** No. 37 Squadron RAF Regiment, (Air Defence, 8\u00d7 Rapier launch stations) *** No. 51 Squadron RAF Regiment, (Light Armour, 15\u00d7 Spartan, 6\u00d7 Scorpion) ** RAF G\u00fctersloh, FRG *** No. 3 Squadron, 16\u00d7 Harrier GR.5 *** No. 4 Squadron, 16\u00d7 Harrier GR.5 *** No. 18 Squadron, 16\u00d7 CH-47 Chinook (supporting British Army of the Rhine) *** No. 230 Squadron, 16\u00d7 Puma HC.1 (supporting British Army of the Rhine) *** No. 63 Squadron RAF Regiment, (Air Defence, 8\u00d7 Rapier launch stations) ** RAF Laarbruch, FRG *** No. 2 Squadron, 12\u00d7 Tornado GR.1A (Reconnaissance) *** No. 15 Squadron, 12\u00d7 Tornado GR.1note 1 *** No. 16 Squadron, 12\u00d7 Tornado GR.1note 1 *** No. 20 Squadron, 12\u00d7 Tornado GR.1note 1 *** No. 1 Squadron RAF Regiment, (Light Armour, 15\u00d7 Spartan, 6\u00d7 Scorpion) *** No. 26 Squadron RAF Regiment, (Air Defence, 8\u00d7 Rapier launch stations) ** RAF Wildenrath, FRG *** No. 19 Squadron, 16x Phantom FGR.2 *** No. 92 Squadron, 16x Phantom FGR.2 *** No. 60 Squadron, Andover CC.2 transport planes *** No. 16 Squadron RAF Regiment, (Air Defence, 8\u00d7 Rapier launch stations) Note 1: Unit with nuclear strike role with 18x WE.177 tactical nuclear weapons. ==RAFG Stations & Establishments== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
