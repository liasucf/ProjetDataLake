It became a fully accredited university and one of the government-funded degree-granting tertiary institutions in 1994. PolyU consists of 8 faculties and schools, offering programmes covering applied science, business, construction, environment, engineering, social science, health, humanities, design, hotel and tourism management. The university offers over 160 taught programmes for more than 25,800 students every year. It is the largest public tertiary institution in terms of number of students. As of 2020, the university ranks 25th in Asia by THE, 15th in young universities by THE, and 75th internationally by QS. ==History== The Government Trade School was founded in 1937. Situated at Wood Road, Wan Chai, the school was the first publicly funded, post-secondary technical institution in Hong Kong. After World War II, the school became the Hong Kong Technical College in 1947, and opened new premises in Hung Hom in 1957. In 1972, the Hong Kong Polytechnic was formally established. Its mandate was to provide professional-oriented education to meet the need for qualified workers. It gained approval from the University and Polytechnic Grants Committee (UGC) for self-accreditation of degree programmes on 25 November 1994, granting full university status and changing its name to The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. ==Campus== === Main campus === PolyU's main campus, in Hung Hom, Kowloon, was designed by a team led by James Kinoshita from P&T; Group in 1972. It has over 20 buildings with red-brick walls, many of which are inter- connected and raised one floor above the podium, creating sheltered open-air spaces for multi-purposes such as logistics and parking. Apart from buildings named after donors, the rotundas which connects the buildings are identified in English letters (from cores and blocks A to Z, without K, O and I). It is one of the largest and densest educational campus in the world. alt= Block Z is the eighth phase of the campus expansion project. It is situated across the northwestern side of the main campus, separated by Chatham Road. It can be accessed through a pedestrian tunnel or a 80-meter-long footbridge, which was proposed in 2016 and built in 2019. In addition to classrooms, laboratories and other academic facilities, the university provides a multi-purpose auditorium, recreational and catering facilities, medical facilities, as well as a bookstore and banks. The Jockey Club Auditorium began operation in 2000. Its balcony and main floor seating accommodate up to 1,084 persons.

The students had posted messages in commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the \"Umbrella Movement\" democracy occupation protests of 2014 and calling for Hong Kong independence from the CCP-ruled People's Republic of China. Another two students were ordered to serve terms of community service. The students had been ordered by management to take them down. The evidence called at the disciplinary committee hearing, at which the students were denied legal representation, included video footage in which the students were observed shouting and knocking on doors. It was alleged that they had made defamatory comments, assaulted a staff member and damaged property, all of which accusations were denied by the students. The university described their behaviour as \"unruly\". Among them were a former student union leader, an elected member of the school's governing council and a former external vice-president of the student union. No avenue for appeal from a decision of the committee is available. Numerous pro-democracy groups, including more than a dozen legislators and 19 student organisations, protested the decision of the committee. The 90,000-strong Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union described the punishments as excessive. === 2019 campus siege === In November 2019, the university was occupied by protesters as part of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests, confrontation with the Hong Kong Police Force occurred from 17 November to 19 November. On 16 November, police attempted to enter the campus, but failed as protestors used road blocks and petrol bombs to attack them.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/17/fire-rocks-and-teargas-fly- in-day-of-battle-at-hong-kong-university The police then blocked all exits of the university campus and requested all protesters inside to surrender. On 18 November, the police attempted to enter the campus again using tear gas, rubber bullets, bean bags, and sponge grenades. Protestors responded by throwing petrol bombs at police. The university has been described as being a battleground during the conflict. The university was later sealed off by police, only several protesters managed to escape. This resulted to a 3-days long stand off. More than 280 protesters were injured while more than 1,000 persons were arrested. ==Notable alumni== ==References== == External links == * Category:Educational institutions established in 1937 Category:Universities in Hong Kong Category:1937 establishments in Hong Kong ",
