    "text": "The Health Insurance Organisation is a state agency which runs the healthcare system in Cyprus. It administers the funds which pays for the Gesy system. It negotiates with the Cyprus Medical Association. It was criticised by the official audit in 2018 which said that \u201cExecution of important projects that are necessary for the implementation of the Gesy like reorganization/autonomy of state hospitals, which should have been handled as a matter of priority have been greatly delayed.\u201d No criteria were in place for selecting overseas centres to which patients would be sent for treatments not available on the island. Most patients were sent to UK, Germany, Greece, and Israel but the financial arrangements were unsatisfactory. In 2016 276 patients were sent to Germany at a cost of about \u20ac5.2 million, and 426 to Greece at a cost of about \u20ac3 million. ==References== Category:Medical and health organisations based in Cyprus Category:Health insurance ",
