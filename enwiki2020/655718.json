    "text": "Isabella (1400 - 28 February 1453) was suo jure Duchess of Lorraine, from 25 January 1431 to her death in 1453. She was also Queen of Naples by marriage to Ren\u00e9 of Anjou. Isabella ruled the Kingdom of Naples and her husband's domains in France as regent during his imprisonment in Burgundy in 1435-1438. ==Life== Isabella was the eldest daughter of Charles II, Duke of Lorraine and Margaret of the Palatinate. By the death of her brothers, it was made apparent in 1410 that she would be the successor of her father in Lorraine. She was given a careful education, and described as beautiful, witty, brave and with the ability to be careful and make hard decisions in difficult circumstances. On 24 October 1420, she married Ren\u00e9 of Anjou. In the marriage contract, it was specified that she would inherit Lorraine, as he would inherit Bar and Pont-\u00e0- Mousson, and that their child and heir would inherit all their domains, thereby uniting them. On 25 January 1431, Isabella inherited the duchy from her father upon his death, and ruled jointly with her husband as her co-ruler, as was customary for a female monarch at that time. Her right to rule was questioned by her cousin, count Antoine de Vaud\u00e9mont, who captured Rene in the Battle of Bulgn\u00e9ville and had him imprisoned with his ally, the Duke of Burgundy. She led an army to rescue her husband from Philip III, Duke of Burgundy. She managed to secure a ceasefire, and the Emperor recognized her right to rule 24 April 1434. On November 1434, her imprisoned spouse inherited the domains of Anjou, Provence and Maine from his brother as well as the position of heir to the throne of Naples, and on 2 February 1435, her inherited the throne of Naples. Rene appointed her to act as his general governor until his release, and a Napolese embassy asked her to come to Naples to assume the post of regent until her spouse could do so in person. She left with her son Louis and a fleet. The mid-16th century Chronicle of Gaspare Fuscolillo records that Isabella arrived in Naples on 15 October 1435. As regent of Naples, was to face the struggle with the other competitor to the throne of Naples, Alfonso of Aragon. She was given military support from the pope, but could not cooperate well with its commander, Jacopo Caldora. Rene was released in 1437, and arrived in Naples to take over the rule from Isabella in May 1438. Isabella left with Louis to return to Lorraine in August 1440. In Lorraine, she finally defeated Antoine de Vaud\u00e9mont 27 March 1441. When Charles VII of France visited in Nancy, they introduced Agnes Sorel to him, who was one of Isabella's ladies-in-waiting. She soon afterwards became the king's influential mistress. In July 1445, Isabella appointed her son John to be her governor general in Lorraine, and retired to her manor Launay in Saumur. Isabella died on 28 February 1453 at the age of 53. Her son John succeeded her as Duke of Lorraine. She was buried in Angers Cathedral. Ren\u00e9 then married, on 10 September 1454, Jeanne de Laval, but this marriage was childless. ==Issue== Ren\u00e9 and Isabella had the following children: *John II (2 August 1424 \u2013 16 December 1470), Duke of Lorraine and King of Naples, married Marie de Bourbon, daughter of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon, by whom he had issue. He also had several illegitimate children. *Louis (16 October 1427 \u2013 between 22 May and 16 October 1444), Marquis of Pont-\u00e0-Mousson and Lieutenant General of Lorraine. At the age of five, in 1432, he was sent as a hostage to Dijon with his brother John in exchange for their captive father. John was released, but Louis was not and died of pneumonia in prison. *Nicholas (2 November 1428 \u2013 1430), twin with Yolande. *Yolande (2 November 1428 \u2013 23 March 1483), married Frederick \u0399\u0399 of Lorraine, count of Vaudemont; mother, among others, of duke Ren\u00e9 II of Lorraine. *Margaret (23 March 1430 \u2013 25 August 1482), married King Henry VI of England, by whom she had a son, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales. *Charles (1431 \u2013 1432), Count of Guise. *Isabelle (died young). *Ren\u00e9 (died young). *Louise (1436 \u2013 1438). *Anne (1437 \u2013 1450, buried in Gardanne). ==See also== * Dukes of Lorraine family tree ==References== ==Sources== * Bernhard R\u00f6se: Isabella (Herzogin von Lothringen).
