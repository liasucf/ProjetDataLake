The trail then begins to switchback for several miles, crossing Maxwell Creek. Here the trail has no bridge and the climber is forced to find another means to cross. Though somewhat shallow in the summer and fall, Maxwell Creek can be fairly deep in the spring time.http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.aspx?trailid=HGW277-074 Retrieved on 12/05/08 The trail straightens for the last mile, but gains elevation quickly. This part of the trail may be difficult for some climbers. ==Images== Image:MaxwellLake.jpg|The West Side of Maxwell Lake Image:Maxwell lake.jpg|Maxwell Lake == References == Category:Lakes of Oregon Category:Lakes of Wallowa County, Oregon Category:Eagle Cap Wilderness ",
