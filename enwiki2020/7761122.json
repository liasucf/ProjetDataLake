    "text": "Chinguacousy Township within Peel County. Chinguacousy Township is a former municipality and present day geographic township in the Regional Municipality of Peel, Ontario, Canada. In 1973, when Peel County became the Regional Municipality of Peel, the township was split in half, with the northern half becoming part of the town of Caledon, and the southern half, along with the township of Toronto Gore, joining the city of Brampton. Several villages were once located within Chinguacousy Township. In most cases only small remnants like churches and cemeteries of many of these former villages exist. Cheltenham is the largest preserved village, while Terra Cotta and Huttonville both have some historic buildings. The name lives on in Brampton in Chinguacousy Park, Chinguacousy Road, the Chinguacousy Concert Band, and Chinguacousy Secondary School, among other things. Chinguacousy Township spanned from what now is Winston Churchill Boulevard to Airport Road, Olde Base Line Road to Steeles Avenue. ==People from Chinguacousy== * Nathaniel Currie ==See also== *List of townships in Ontario ==References== * * Category:History of Brampton Category:Former municipalities in Ontario Category:Caledon, Ontario Category:Geographic townships in Ontario Category:Former townships in Ontario Category:1973 disestablishments in Ontario Category:Populated places disestablished in 1973 ",
