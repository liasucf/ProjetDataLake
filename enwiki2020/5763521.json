She was an External Member of the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee (FPC), joining the new statutory body and macroprudential regulator in April 2013 and standing down in October 2016. She was a non-executive Director of Nomura Holdings from June 2010 to March 2017. Until April 2017, she was also the lead independent director of the UK's Department for Work and Pensions.

Very strong growth followed a major technology upgrade to 'TradElect' and an international focus to its listings business, which prompted a record five unsolicited or hostile bids in under two and half years from late 2004 to early 2007. Deutsche Boerse, Euronext, Macquarie, and Nasdaq (who twice failed to acquire the exchange despite garnering nearly 30% of the stock), launched bids at prices from \u00a35.30 to \u00a312.43. The Exchange conducted an unprecedented number of successful bid defenses before completing its merger with Borsa Italiana in October 2007, which provided the foundation for a diversification into derivatives, fixed income, clearing and settlement. ==Fortis== Furse was a non-executive director of Fortis when the Belgian bank, in partnership with Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander, purchased ABN Amro in 2008.
