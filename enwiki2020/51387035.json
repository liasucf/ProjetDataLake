The site consensus reads, \"\"Do Not Disturb\" gains ground by focusing on Travis and Chris' father/son relationship, but also struggles to successfully introduce a new potential villain to the proceedings.\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/fear_the_walking_dead/s02/e10 Matt Fowler of IGN gave \"Do Not Disturb\" a 7.4/10.0 rating stating; \"Fear the Walking Dead has some good, quieter things going on related to character and family, but its larger violence-related beats are faltering - especially when it comes to an over-reliance on cliffhangers and off-camera saves. It's a trite gimmick that The Walking Dead took a long time to finally land on so it's disappointing to see this show tap the vein so early on.\" === Ratings === \"Do Not Disturb\" was seen by 2.99 million viewers in the United States on its original air date, below the previous episodes rating of 3.66 million. ==References== Category:2016 American television episodes Category:Fear the Walking Dead (season 2) episodes ",
