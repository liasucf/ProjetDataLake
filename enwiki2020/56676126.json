    "text": "Iron Gates gorge today, flooded by the \u0110erdap Lake The Sip Canal () was a ship canal on the Danube, in eastern Serbia. It was constructed as part of a massive international effort to make the navigation through the most dangerous sections of the Iron Gates gorge safer and easier. Open in 1896, with participation of three royal heads of state, the Sip Canal was flooded in 1969 when the artificial \u0110erdap Lake was formed after the dam of the Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station on the Danube was built. In terms of navigation, it was the most important of all 7 canals cut through the gorge. == Origin == The Iron Gate gorge was notorious for the riverbed boulders and river rapids, which were hard to navigate through even for the most seasoned ferrymen. During the Ottoman rule, the ships were guided through by the local navigators who were familiar with the routes. They were called kalauz (from Turkish kalavuz, meaning guide, travel leader). During the rule of prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107, local Serbs gradually took over from the Ottomans. The Serbian navigators were officially appointed by prince Milo\u0161. To alleviate the Ottomans, the prince named Serbian navigators by a Turkish name, dumend\u017eiba\u0161a, from d\u00fcmen (rudder) and ba\u015f (head, chief, master). The navigation fee was divided in three parts, among dumend\u017eiba\u0161a, loc (river pilots) and the local municipalities. The local navigators were described in the works of Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107 and Mateja Nenadovi\u0107. At the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Serbia was recognized as a fully independent state, while Austria-Hungary was given a task of constructing the future Sip Canal. The task was then relegated to the Hungarian government. Hungarian government has been drafting the projects already in 1831. Several plans were later made by the Austrio-Hungarian government and the Austro-Ottoman commission, but the Hungarian government formed its own commission for the navigation project which finished its work in 1883. == Construction == Hungarian government enlisted a large number of workers and engaged a numerous and heavy machinery. The construction was a massive enterprise which resulted in construction of several canals: * Stenka, long, with 10 navigational signals (originally, the balloons were used) * Izlaz-Tahatlija, , with 7 signals * Svini\u021ba, , with 4 signals * Juc, , with 5 signals * Mali \u0110erdap, , as an extension of the Sip Canal In total, 15,465 m (50,738 ft) of navigable canals was created. Total length of all canals was while of embankments were also built. They were flooded when the artificial Lake \u0110erdap was created (circa 1970). Works in the gorge section were done by the Hungarian Technical Administration, over the period of 11 years, starting in 1889. The works were divided in two sectors, the upper and the lower Iron Gates. The canals in the upper section, at the town of Or\u0219ova (the tripoint between Austria-Hungary, Romania and Serbia at the time) were up to 60 m (197 ft) wide and 2 m (7 ft) deep, at the zero water level in Or\u0219ova. In the southern section, the canals were 60 m (197 ft) wide and 3 m (10 ft) deep, except for the Sip Canal, which was wider and deeper. Construction of the canal began on 17 September 1890. It was cut in the right bank of the Danube and cost 10 million golden dinars at the time. Some of high quality stone was used. The canal was ceremonially open on 27 September 1896, with cannon salvo. The ceremony was attended by the king Alexander I of Serbia, emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and king Carol I of Romania. == Characteristics == The Sip Canal had a total length of , it was wide and up to deep. At the lowest water level it was still deep, which allowed the navigation of large river ships. Unlike other canals, which were dug into the rocky riverbed of the Deanube, the Sip Canal was cut into the bank. The upstream navigation lasted for 24 minutes, while downstream it took only 3 minutes to pass through the canal. As the canal was located close to the village of Sip, it was named after it. The village was flooded in 1969 and the new settlement, called Novi Sip (\"New Sip\") was built instead. It is located northwest from Kladovo. == History == The first boat which navigated through the Sip Canal was a 600 hp tugboat. Among the first ships on the opening day was also a steamboat \"Franz Joseph I\". An elegant, long ship was built in 1873. A technical marvel of its day, as of 2016 it was still in use. It operated on the Wolfgangsee, at St. Gilgen in Austria. It soon became evident that the planners miscalculated. The river flow was still fast, actually it increased to and remained an obstacle for the ships navigating upstream. In order to make the navigation easier, a steam- powered tugboat \"Va\u0161kap\" was employed in 1899 to tug the boats upstream. The \"Va\u0161kap\" was specifically built by Austria-Hungary for this purpose and the steam engine was winding the cable on the winch. During the World War I, German occupational forces in Serbia constructed a railway next to the canal, on the embankment. It was long and the locomotives began tugging the boats instead of the tugboat. Open in 1916, the rail was originally served by three switcher locomotives which used the steel cables for tugging. Each had 400 hp. During their withdrawal in 1918, Germans disabled the railway.\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0443 \u041c\u0435\u0452\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0458 \u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0458 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0438\u0458\u0438, \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433 \u0438\u0437\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0431\u0435, \u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0432 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0435, \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434, 2016, \u0408\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0402\u0443\u0440\u0438\u0448\u0438\u045b (Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the International Danube Commission, exhibition catalogue by Jelena \u0110uri\u0161i\u0107, Archive of Yugoslavia, Belgrade, 2016) After the war, the canal and the railway were reconstructed, with the rail being extended for additional . A total of 11 locomotives was used during the period when the rail was operational. Locomotives were followed by a steam wagon, which had its own operator. The wagon had a steam operated winch on which the ship cables were hooked. In the Second World War the strategic importance of the canal was significant because much of the Romanian oil shipments to Germany passed through it. After the Yugoslav coup d'\u00e9tat that toppled the pro-German government the Yugoslavs prepared to block the canal by sinking concrete- filled barges that were to be maneuvered into position by a tugboat and to demolish the railway and other canal facilities in case Germany attacked Yugoslavia. Informed of this through their spy network the Germans actually opened the Invasion of Yugoslavia in the night between 5th and 6th of April 1941. by capturing the Yugoslav Army company guarding the canal with an elaborate surprise attack by a platoon of Brandenburgers in civilian clothes who entered Yugoslavia by crossing the Danube in boats and which involved distracting the Yugoslav company's officers with a party organized by the Mayor of Kladovo, who was secretly working for the Germans, where the Germans surprised them and killed them. The Germans then removed the demolition charges, but the alarm was raised by the Yugoslavs nevertheless and the tugboat sprung into action, meeting a hail of German bullets as it approached the canal which compelled its captain to withdraw prematurely and the barges ended up not being sunk in correct positions to block the canal. A mock re- staging of the attack by fully uniformed troops in broad daylight was later shot for the German propaganda newsreel of 2nd of May 1941. about the Balkans campaign. The profession of loc, a river pilot, survived until the area was flooded. At one point, there were 29 of them in Sip. At the entrance into the gorge, regardless of the flag under which the ship navigates, the captains were handing over the ship commands to the loc. They were so esteemed, that insurance companies were not paying for the damages on the ships which had no loc. Bad calculations followed the ending of Sip Canal, too. The Sip Locomotive Tugging facilities were flooded by the rising \u0110erdap Lake in 1969, six months before it was projected. The water rushed one morning into the facility, flooding everything. The entire railway and the last two locomotives are today on the bottom of the lake. The locomotives, J\u017d class 30 locomotive 30-031 and 30-034, called berlinke (\"she-Berliners\"), were built in 1930. They had three-cylinder steam engines and were produced in the in Berlin. For a while, some German institutions were interested into dragging the locomotives out of the water, as they are the last remaining locomotives of this design today, and to exhibit them in some of the Berlin's museums. Today, with the artificial lake and flooded gorge, the navigation through Danube is easy and safe. == References == Category:Canals in Serbia Category:Water transport in Serbia Category:Danube ",
