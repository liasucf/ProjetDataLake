    "text": "In Greek mythology, Daulis (Ancient Greek: \u0394\u03b1\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03c2) and at a later stage Daulia (Ancient Greek: \u0394\u03b1\u03c5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1) and Daulion (Ancient Greek: \u0394\u03b1\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) was the name of a mythological figure and Davleia, the city in Phocis, is named after her. According to Homer, it was said to be named either in reference to the woody character of the area or after a nymph Daulis, a daughter of the river-god Cephissus. Daulis was the hometown of Tereus, Thracian king and also the city at the end of the road not taken by Oedipus.Pausanias. Description of Greece 10.4.7-10 with an English Translation by W.H.S. Jones, Litt.D., and H.A. Ormerod, M.A., in 4 Volumes. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1918. == Mythology == === Nymph === > \"They say that the name of the city is derived from Daulis, a nymph, the > daughter of the Cephisus.

The hoopoe, > into which the legend says Tereus was changed, is a bird a little larger > than the quail, while the feathers on its head rise into the shape of a > crest. > It is noteworthy that in Phocis swallows neither hatch nor lay eggs; in fact > no swallow would even make a nest in the roof of a house. The Phocians say > that even when Philomela was a bird she had a terror of Tereus, and so kept > away from his country. At Daulis is a sanctuary of Athena with an ancient > image. The wooden image, of an even earlier date, the Daulians say was > brought from Athens by Procne. > In the territory of Daulis is a place called Tronis. Here has been built a > shrine of the Founder hero. This founder is said by some to have been > Xanthippus, a distinguished soldier; others say that he was Phocus, son of > Ornytion, son of Sisyphus. At any rate, he is worshipped every day, and the > Phocians bring victims and pour the blood into the grave through a hole, but > the flesh they are wont to consume on the spot.\" == References == Category:Children of Potamoi ",
