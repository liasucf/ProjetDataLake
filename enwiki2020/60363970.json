    "text": "The FIA-Certified Gran Turismo Championships (also referred to as the FIA GTC) is a series of professional Gran Turismo Sport world championship esports tournaments, managed directly by Japanese game development studio Polyphony Digital and by France-based international motorsport governing body FIA. The series uses Polyphony Digital's latest racing game Gran Turismo Sport, and the championship contains two series that are held concurrently throughout the year: the Nations Cup (entrants from their respective countries will represent them) and the Manufacturers Series (entrants will race for and represent their chosen manufacturer). The winners of each series are given a TAG Heuer watch, and a glass plaque, and are also honoured at the FIA Prize Giving Ceremony. All virtual races in the tournament take place in specified locations all around the globe. In addition to the live studio audiences at the specified locations, the tournaments are streamed live in YouTube through several languages. The series is currently sponsored by Toyota, TAG Heuer, and Michelin, and the series is provided with clothing by Puma and peripherals by Thrustmaster. The series has since made an impact in real-world motorsport, serving as a basis for virtual players in terms of possibly starting a career in esports before jumping into real-world motorsport. == Format == Before the \"Online Series\" is started, every season begins with a \"World Tour\" event, containing the top drivers from the season prior. The winner from the World Tour event gains direct access to the \"World Final\" event. A phase dubbed as the \"Online Series\", which is essentially a qualification phase to decide the participants that will race in the live events of the championship tournament, kicks off every season. The Online Series is divided into four stages, with each stage hosting ten rounds. By the end of each stage, another World Tour event is hosted, which includes the top players from that stage instead of the top drivers from the previous season. The top players who are selected after the series must sign an application form in order to be able to participate for the World Tour events, and they must also be over 18. The Online Series goes on for five to seven months. The \"Live Events\" begin after the Online Series. The Nations Cup category includes the top 90 players (30 per region) with the highest points across all four stages. Three different live events occur, with each live event carrying a specific world region. The top 10 players from those regions enter the \"World Final\" event, a championship stage to decide the number one player. The Manufacturer Series category includes the top 48 players (three players per region) and 16 manufacturers with the highest points across all four stages. The top players and manufacturers participate in the \"World Final\" event, to decide the top three players and the number one manufacturer. The winners of their respective series at the \"World Final\" are crowned either Nations Cup champion or Manufacturer Series champion. == Media coverage == The FIA GTC races are usually streamed live in YouTube under the official Gran Turismo channel, and is available to watch through several languages. The commentator duos for the livestreams are Jimmy Broadbent and Tom Brooks (English coverage), Rene Buttler and Florian Strauss (German coverage), Donald Reignoux and Pierre-Oliver Valette (French coverage), Emilio Cozzi and Andrea Facchinetti (Italian coverage), Alberto Perez and Lucas Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez (Spanish coverage), and Duarte F\u00e9lix da Costa and Filipe Albuquerque (Portuguese coverage). == Event winners == There have been several event winners since the start of the FIA GTC at the \"GT World Tour\" event at the N\u00fcrburgring. Giorgio Mangano was the first Nations Cup event winner, and Philippe Nicolay, Matthew Thomas, and Anthony Duval, representing BMW, were the first Manufacturers Series Cup regional event winners. Formula Regional driver and former USF2000 driver Igor Fraga became the first ever FIA Certified Nations Cup World Champion, and Kanata Kawakami, Vincent Rigaud, and Tyrell Meadows became the first ever FIA Certified Manufacturer Series World Champions for Lexus at the \"World Final\" event in Monaco 2018. Fraga is the only FIA GTC event winner who has won both the Nations Cup and Manufacturer Series championships. He is also the only event winner to have won a championship in both FIA GTC and in real world motorsport. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\" |+ !Season !Title !Location !Date !Nations Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Manufacturer Series !Ref |- ! rowspan=\"6\" |2018 |World Tour 2018 - N\u00fcrburgring | N\u00fcrburg |10-13 May | Giorgio Mangano | Philippe Nicolay Matthew Thomas Anthony Duval | BMW | |- |World Tour 2018 - Red Bull Hangar-7 | Salzburg |22 September | Benjamin Bader Patrik Blazs\u00e1n Adam Tapai | Mikail Hizal Andrew McCabe | Nissan | |- |Nations Cup Asia/Oceania Final 2018 | Odaiba |06-07 October | Ryota Kokubun | colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"3\" |Not held | |- |Nations Cup European Final 2018 | Madrid |19-20 October | Mikail Hizal | |- |Nations Cup Americas Final 2018 | Las Vegas |31 October | Igor Fraga | |- |World Finals 2018 | Monaco |16-18 November | Igor Fraga | Kanata Kawakami Vincent Rigaud Tyrell Meadows | Lexus | |- ! rowspan=\"6\" |2019 |World Tour 2019 - Paris | Paris |16-17 March | Nicolas Rubilar | Yoshiharu Imai Thomas Compton-McPherson Christopher Marcell | Aston Martin | |- |World Tour 2019 - N\u00fcrburgring | N\u00fcrburg |21-22 June | Igor Fraga | Tomoaki Yamanaka Rick Kevelham Simon Bishop | Toyota | |- |World Tour 2019 - New York | New York City |24-25 August | Igor Fraga | Cody Nikola Latkovski Bernal Valverde Anthony Felix | Mercedes-Benz | |- |World Tour 2019 - Red Bull Hangar-7 | Salzburg |14-15 September | Mikail Hizal | Cody Nikola Latkovski Tom Lartilleux Anthony Felix | Mercedes-Benz | |- |World Tour 2019 - Tokyo | Tokyo |26-27 October | Ryota Kokubun | Angel Inostroza Tristan Bayless Matt Simmons | Porsche | |- |World Finals 2019 | Monaco |23-24 November | Mikail Hizal | Tomoaki Yamanaka Rayan Derrouiche Igor Fraga | Toyota | |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |2020 |World Tour 2020 - Sydney | Sydney |15-16 February | Takuma Miyazono | Coque L\u00f3pez Nicolas Rubilar Randall Haywood | BMW | |- |World Tour 2020 - N\u00fcrburgring | N\u00fcrburg |22-23 May | colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"1\" |Cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic and postponement of 2020 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring race | |} == References == Category:F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile Category:Gran Turismo (series) competitions ",
