Viracor Eurofins works with medical professionals, transplant teams, reference labs and bio-pharmaceutical companies to deliver test results to help clinicians make diagnostic decisions for their patients. Viracor-IBT has CLIA clinical laboratory certification as both an Infectious Disease Laboratory and as an Allergy & Immunology Laboratory. ==History== Viracor-IBT was created through the merger of two specialty diagnostic testing labs, Viracor Laboratories and IBT Laboratories. Founded by Drs. Konstance Knox and Donald Carrigan in Milwaukee County in 2000, Viracor set the benchmark for the diagnostic industry by providing exceptional turnaround times for patient results. Through its commitment to research and development in infectious disease testing, Viracor was among the first to commercially offer real-time quantitative PCR assays to diagnose patients with Adenovirus, BK virus and JC virus, among others. Founded in 1983, IBT's deep expertise in the fields of immunology and allergy enabled the company to become a leader in translational science - bridging the gap between research and clinical practice. IBT was the first laboratory to offer a test to definitively diagnose autoimmune causes of chronic hives and developed the first commercially available test to measure pneumococcal antibodies. On 1 July 2014, Ampersand Capital Partners completed the sale of Viracor-IBT Laboratories to Eurofins Scientific for $255 million. The company continued to be known as Viracor-IBT. ==Expertise== The core areas of expertise for Viracor-IBT are: * Custom Assay Development * Infectious Disease Testing * Immune Monitoring * Biomarkers & Bioanalyitics == References == ==External links== * Viracor Eurofins Clinical Diagnostics Category:Lee's Summit, Missouri Category:Biotechnology companies of the United States ",
