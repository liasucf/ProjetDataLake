Nicknamed \"Living King Yama\", he ranks 31st among the 36 Heavenly Spirits, the first third of the 108 Stars of Destiny. ==Background== The novel depicts Ruan Xiaoqi as having bulging eyes, pale yellow whiskers and dark patches on his skin, which make him look like a fearsome bronze statue. As this image is similar to that of the ruler of Hell in Chinese mythology, he is nicknamed \"Living King Yama\". Ruan Xiaoqi is the youngest of the three Ruan brothers (his seniors being Ruan Xiaoer and Ruan Xiaowu). They live in Shijie Village (\u77f3\u78a3\u6751; in present-day Liangshan County, Shandong), where they make a living by fishing in waters near the Liangshan Marsh. Like his brothers, Ruan Xiaoqi is a good swimmer and fights well under water. ==Becoming an outlaw== Wu Yong recommends involving the three Ruan brothers when Chao Gai, headman of Dongxi village in Yuncheng County, seeks his advice on whether to hijack valuables in transportation to the Grand Tutor Cai Jing in the imperial capital Dongjing. Visiting the Ruans in Shijie Village, Wu claims that he has come to buy some fish before proceeding to find out whether they are receptive to the bold proposal. Ruan Xiaoer, the oldest of the three, senses Wu is up to something else while the other two brothers, being less astute, are not suspicious. Nevertheless all three are unhappy with their poverty and resent being bullied by officials. So when Wu Yong comes to his point, they unanimously accept the invitation. The robbers, numbering seven including Liu Tang and Gongsun Sheng and with the help of Bai Sheng, who poses as a wine seller, succeed in seizing the valuables at the Yellow Mud Ridge by drugging the escorts of the gifts led by Yang Zhi. But the authorities soon track down essential clues and an arrest party is sent to seize Chao Gai at his house. Chao, Wu Yong, Gongsun Sheng and Liu Tang flee to Shijie village. The Ruan brothers, familiar with the surrounding waters, lure the soldiers who have come for them into the waterways and wipe them out. The seven men then seek refuge in the bandit stronghold of Liangshan Marsh.\u6c34\u6ef8\u50b3\u7b2c\u5341\u516b\u56de\u300c\u7f8e\u9aef\u516c\u667a\u7a69\u63d2\u7fc5\u864e\uff0c\u5b8b\u516c\u660e\u79c1\u653e\u6641\u5929\u738b\u7db1\u300d\u3002See wikisource:zh:\u6c34\u6ef8\u50b3 (120\u56de\u672c)/\u7b2c018\u56de Wang Lun, the leader of Liangshan, tries to send them away with gifts fearing that they might usurp his position. Wu Yong, sensing Lin Chong's unhappiness with Wang, instigates him to kill the leader. Chao Gai is then elected the new chief of Liangshan, with Ruan Xiaoqi taking the eighth position. The Ruan brothers are appointed commanders of the Liangshan flotilla. When Guan Sheng leads an imperial force to attack Liangshan, Zhang Heng launches a raid on his camp with a small band without informing any of the chieftains except Ruan Xiaoqi.

He is reprimanded by Song Jiang for the lese majeste offence. Back in Dongjing the remaining Liangshan heroes are each conferred a position. When it comes Ruan Xiaoqi's turn, Grand Marshal Gao Qiu and Grand Tutor Cai Jing raise objection citing his offence of putting on Fang La\u2018s \"illegal\" articles.
