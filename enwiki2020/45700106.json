The Human Rights center has conducted investigations or research focusing on sexual violence, human trafficking, torture, public health among vulnerable populations, accountability for war criminals, child soldiers, family reunification, and the applications of advanced technologies to human rights work. The Center's reports have examined human rights issues in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and South America, Southeast Asia, the Balkans, the Middle East, and the United States.
