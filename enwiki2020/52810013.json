    "text": "Saint Burchard of Meissen (d. 25 September 969the year 970 is also often given) was the first Bishop of Meissen, from 968.S\u00e4chsische Biographie (Peter Neumeister): Burchard, Bischof von Mei\u00dfen Archbishop Adalbert of Magdeburg consecrated him in Magdeburg as the first Bishop of Meissen, where he established the first cathedral chapter of Meissen. The only documented facts about him are his name, the details of his consecration and the date of his death.His successor Volkold was in post by 970/971 (S\u00e4chsische Biographie (Peter Neumeister): Burchard, Bischof von Mei\u00dfen). In his article on Volkold in the ADB, Uhlirz worked out the year of death as 969. In the absence of facts a traditional account of his death developed, to the effect that he died on 14 June in either 970 or 972 from a fall from his horse, but this is not supported by any evidence. He is sometimes saidfor example, in Friedrich Wilhelm Ebeling: Die deutschen Bisch\u00f6fe bis zum Ende des sechzehnten Jahrhunderts (Band 2), Wiegand, Leipzig 1858, p. 223 (Google books) to have been a Benedictine monk from St. Emmeram's Abbey, Regensburg, or St. John's Abbey, Magdeburg (Kloster Berge), but there is no documented evidence of this either. He is venerated as a saint; his feast day is 14 June.\u00d6kumenisches Heiligenlexikon ] ==Notes and references== == Literature == * Machatschek, Eduard: Geschichte der Bisch\u00f6fe des Hochstiftes Meissen in chronologischer Reihenfolge: Zugleich ein Beitrag zur Culturgeschichte der Mark Meissen und des Herzog und Kurf\u00fcrstenthums Sachsens.
