    "text": "You're Back in the Room is a British television game show that was broadcast on ITV from 14 March 2015 to 9 April 2016. The show was hosted by Phillip Schofield and starred Keith Barry. The premise consists of contestants who have to complete a series of normally straightforward tasks after being subject to \"deep hypnosis\", causing them to be compelled to develop various distracting tics or quirks that hinder their ability to compete. A second series consisting of four episodes was announced on 21 July 2015 and began airing on 12 March 2016. On 7 October 2016, it was announced that the show had been axed. ==Episodes== ===Series 1 (2015)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
