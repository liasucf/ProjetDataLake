    "text": "The Hailey Methodist Episcopal Church, also known as Hailey Community Baptist Church, in Hailey, Idaho, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. It is a wood frame vernacular Gothic Revival church that is in plan. It has an entrance through its -plan belfry tower inset into the building's gable front. Front extension of the roof is supported by purlins. An open-sided bell tower, holding a metal bell and four all-weather speakers, tops the tower. It was built in 1886 and survived numerous fires in Hailey, probably due to relatively wide separation from its neighbors. ==See also== *Emmanuel Episcopal Church (Hailey, Idaho) (1885) ==References== Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Idaho Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Idaho Category:Episcopal church buildings in Idaho Category:Blaine County, Idaho ",
