The Body Politic, Vol. 10 (1983). ==Saskatoon Gay Action== He soon received two responses, and the three men soon established a Saskatoon chapter of the Gay Liberation Front. As membership increased, the group expanded its activities to include both political lobbying and social activities. In 1972 the group formally incorporated as the Zodiac Friendship Society, an umbrella organization which was parent to the Gemini Club for social events and Saskatoon Gay Action for the political work. The social events raised funds toward the creation of a gay community centre in the city, which was established in 1973 as only the second such institution in all of Canada. In a 1973 interview with The Body Politic, Hellquist said that \"I really believe that Gay Lib will be won in the smaller centres of Canada. In a small city they can't ignore you as easily.\" In 2005, the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal relied on expert testimony from Hellquist in finding that four pamphlets which had been publicly distributed in Regina and Saskatoon breached the hate publication provision of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code. Hellquist had been called as an expert witness by the Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission on the impact of the pamphlets on the gay community.Whatcott v. Saskatchewan (Human Rights Tribunal), 2010 SKCA 26, at paras 9,14,127,131, citing the Tribunal's reliance on Hellquist's evidence.
