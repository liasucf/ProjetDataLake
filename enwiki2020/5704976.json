    "text": "Sylviornis is an extinct genus of stem-galliform bird containing a single species, S. neocaledoniae, or erroneously, \"New Caledonian giant megapode\". Technically, the latter is incorrect because it has recently been found not to be a megapode, but one of two genera in the family Sylviornithidae; at the time of its description, it was believed to be a ratite. Sylviornis was never encountered alive by scientists, but it is known from many thousands of subfossil bones found in deposits, some of them from the Holocene, on New Caledonia and the adjacent \u00cele des Pins. Recent morphological studies indicate that it was a sister taxon of Megavitiornis, in a clade outside of the Galliformes crown group. ==Description== Skull Sylviornis was a huge flightless bird, long altogether, and weighing around on average. It is the most massive galliform known to have ever existed. It had a large skull with a high and laterally compressed beak surmounted by a bony knob. Its legs were rather short, but had strong toes with long nails. The skeleton has a number of peculiarities and differences that make Sylviornis stand apart from all other known birds: the clavicles were not fused to a furcula, the number of caudal vertebrae was very high, and the ribcage and pelvis were almost dinosaurian in appearance. The wings were reduced to small stubs. ==Behaviour== A large proportion\u2014up to 50% in some deposits\u2014of the remains found were from juvenile animals. Thus, it has been theorized that Sylviornis had a clutch of at least two, more probably closer to 10 eggs, and that the average lifespan was not much more than 5\u20137 years, which would be extremely low for such a large bird. It was thought that the bird did not incubate its eggs but built a mound similar to the megapodes. Tumuli on the \u00cele des Pins which were initially believed to be graves were found to contain no human remains or grave goods, and it has been hypothesized that they were in reality the incubation mounds of Sylviornis. As these mounds are up to high and wide even after nearly four millennia, they seem too large to have been made by the giant scrubfowl (Megapodius molistructor), an extinct New Caledonian species of megapode.

It was probably a slow-moving browser, and the structure of the bill and feet suggest that roots and tubers it dug up formed a major part of its diet. ==Extinction== The bird was hunted to extinction by the Lapita ancestors of the Kanak people, who settled New Caledonia around 1500 BC. Predation by feral dogs and pigs probably also played a part. The legacy of Sylviornis persists in Kanak oral history in the form of stories giving a rough description of the bird and some of its habits. The native name was du. ==See also== * Biodiversity of New Caledonia * Holocene extinction * Island gigantism * Late Quaternary prehistoric birds ==References== * * * * ==External links== *Article with reconstruction pictures of Sylviornis Category:Galliformes Category:Extinct flightless birds Category:Monotypic bird genera Category:Late Quaternary prehistoric birds Category:New Caledonia Holocene fauna Category:Holocene extinctions Category:Extinct birds of New Caledonia Category:Fossil taxa described in 1980 ",
