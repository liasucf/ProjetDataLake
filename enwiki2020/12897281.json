    "text": "College Swing, also known as Swing, Teacher, Swing in the U.K., is a 1938 comedy film directed by Raoul Walsh and starring George Burns, Gracie Allen, Martha Raye, and Bob Hope. The supporting cast features Edward Everett Horton, Ben Blue, Betty Grable, Jackie Coogan, John Payne, Robert Cummings, and Jerry Colonna. ==Plot== It's 1738, and Gracie Alden (Gracie Allen) of the powerful Alden family fails to graduate from the college founded by her grandfather for the ninth year in a row, so he leaves it in his will to the first female of the family to graduate within 200 years. At the deadline, in 1938, another Gracie Alden, the last girl of the line, is having trouble with her studies, so she hires fast-talking Bud Brady (Bob Hope) to help her. Her efforts are opposed by woman-hating professor Hubert Dash (Edward Everett Horton) and his secretary George Jones (George Burns), who don't want to see their beloved college fall into the hands of an empty-headed nit-wit like Gracie. When by hook and by crook Gracie manages to pass her exam and becomes the owner of the college, she does away with entrance exams, hires a bunch of incompetent but kooky teachers, and turns the place into a jumpin' jitterbugging joint complete with swing bands and remote radio broadcasts.Erickson, Hal Plot synopsis (Allmovie)TCM Full synopsis ==Cast== *George Burns as George Jonas *Gracie Allen as Gracie Alden *Martha Raye as Mable *Bob Hope as Bud Brady *Edward Everett Horton as Hubert Dash *Florence George as Ginna Ashburn *Ben Blue as Ben Volt *Betty Grable as Betty *Jackie Coogan as Jackie *John Payne as Martin Bates *Cecil Cunningham as Dean Sleet *Robert Cummings as Radio Announcer *Skinnay Ennis as Skinnay *Jerry Colonna as Prof. Yascha Koloski (uncredited) *The Slate Brothers as themselves *Robert Mitchell and St. Brendan's Choristers as themselves Cast notes: *Mary Livingstone, who became well known as the wife of Jack Benny, appears in a small uncredited part as an usherette. *Jackie Coogan and Betty Grable were married at the time they made this film together. ==Production credits== * Raoul Walsh - director * Lewis E.
