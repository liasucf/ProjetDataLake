    "text": "Mashina Vremeni (, and known as Time Machine in English music sources) is a Russian rock band founded in 1969. Mashina Vremeni was a pioneer of Soviet rock music and remains one of the oldest still-active rock bands in Russia. The band's music incorporates elements of classic rock, blues, and bard's song. Mashina Vremeni's best known members are Andrei Makarevich (founder, principal singer-songwriter, public face of the band), Alexander Kutikov (bass player and producer/sound engineer), and Evgeny Margulis (guitarist/songwriter). ==History== Andrei Makarevich Alexander Kutikov Evgeny Margulis Mashina Vremeni meet Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in 2008. L-R: Medvedev, Yefremov, Margulis, Makarevich Mashina Vremeni performing at the band's 40th anniversary concert Andrei Makarevich's musical career can be traced to a school band called The Kids, which was made up of two male guitarists and two female vocalists. The group sang mostly English-language folk songs and performed primarily at talent shows put on in Moscow schools. According to Makarevich, the momentous event in his musical career came when the Soviet group VIA Atlanty () visited his school and allowed him to play a couple of songs on their equipment during a break in the performance. On the heels of this experience, Makarevich joined with other musically talented students from his school and another school to form Mashiny Vremeni ( - in plural form imitating The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, etc.). The most significant founding members included Sergey Kavagoe and Andrey Makarevich. The band's repertoire consisted of eleven songs in English, now lost. Mashina Vremeni started playing during the last years of the Brezhnev era, but could not get official bookings as a professional band.Leslie Woodhead How the Beatles Rocked the Kremlin 2013 - 1408840421 \"But Time Machine were still totally unofficial, with no possibility of becoming a professional group. \u201cSoviet officials understood that something was happening,\u201d Andrei said, \u201cbut they didn't know what to do about it.\u201d \" In 1979 Makarevich signed the band up with Rosconcert, becoming legitimate in the State music system.Woodhead 2013 \"... proceeds from their cassettes, Makarevich signed up with the state promotion agency, Rosconcert. After a decade of surviving on the edge, Time Machine became legitimate. It meant they could rely on national publicity and a steady income.\" ===Timeline=== * 1971 - Alexander Kutikov becomes the bass player, introducing more of buoyant rock-n-roll into the band's material * 1972 - Line-up losses in the band as several members are drafted into service (which to this day is compulsory in Russia) * 1973 - Tensions between Sergey Kavagoe and Alexander Kutikov; the latter leaves the band for a hard rock outfit Visokosnoe Leto (Leap Year Summer) * 1974 - Sergey Kavagoe leaves, Alexander Kutikov returns.

Contributions to song composition have been made by almost every band member, and often reflect each member's particular stylistic preferences. Makarevich is a fan of The Beatles, and many of his songs reflect the Beatles' influence. He is also influenced by blues music and Soviet singers-songwriters, the so-called \"bards\". Kutikov is a quintessential rocker, he composes guitar-oriented hard rock. Margulis is one of the Russia's best known bluesmen, and his songs are usually blues rock ballads. The majority of the band's lyrics are written by Makarevich. They were often metaphorical fables that made allegorical puns relating to life in the Soviet and Post-Soviet eras. ==Albums== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Year ! Russian ! Translit ! English !
