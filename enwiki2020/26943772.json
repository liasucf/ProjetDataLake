    "text": "Yuchi () is a Chinese compound surname which originated from Xianbei and Khotan. The imperial family name of the Kingdom of Khotan Vi\u015ba was translated as Yuchi. There is no consensus on whether the two Yuchi are related. The well known military general Yuchi Gong was descended from the Xianbei Yuchi. Yuchi is the 419th surname in Hundred Family Surnames. Since compound surname is not common in China, some descendants of Yuchi changed their name to single surname Yu or Chi (\u9072). ==Notable Yuchi== ===Xianbei=== * Yuchi Chifan, concubine of Emperor Xuan of Northern Zhou * Yuchi Gong, military general in Tang Dynasty * Yuchi Jiong, general of Western Wei and Northern Zhou ===Khotan=== * Yuchi Yiseng, painter in the Tang dynasty Category:Chinese- language surnames Category:Individual Chinese surnames ",
