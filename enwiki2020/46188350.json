Out of desperation, Jaci decides to hire a model to act as her fianc\u00e9 during a meeting with the winegrower, only to have him invite her and her \"fianc\u00e9\" to his estate in the Cape Winelands, where she will have to compete with a rival company, led by her ex-fianc\u00e9, to secure the contract. Just as Jaci starts to feel as if she is in control of the situation, she discovers that her feigned fianc\u00e9 is actually the very same \"Jackal\" whom she was trying to prevent from taking over the company she works for. ==References== Category:Afrikaans- language films Category:South African films Category:2012 films Category:2012 romantic comedy films Category:South African romantic comedy films Category:2012 comedy films ",
