    "text": "Leones F.C., also known as Itag\u00fc\u00ed Leones, is a professional Colombian football team based in Itag\u00fc\u00ed playing in the Categor\u00eda Primera B starting from 2019. They play their home games at the Estadio Metropolitano Ciudad de Itag\u00fc\u00ed. == History == Founded as Deportivo Rionegro in 1957, Leones F\u00fatbol Club participated in all seasons of the Categor\u00eda Primera B from 1991 to 2017, when the team was runner-up of the tournament and was promoted to Categor\u00eda Primera A for the first time. The team played for almost forty years in the amateur league. The team's first president was Libardo Sanchez and his first manager was Alfonso Piedrahita. Thanks to its performances and achievements in the 80s the club was admitted in the first edition of the Categor\u00eda Primera B, the second-tier of the professional Colombian league, played in 1991. In 1993, with the direction of manager Carlos Augusto Navarrete, Rionegro managed to be among the five best of the tournament. The team got its best performance in 2001, when they were runners-up under the direction of manager Orlando Restrepo. In 2008 Deportivo Rionegro, with Ren\u00e9 Higuita as their captain and star and with \u00d3scar Aristiz\u00e1bal as manager, managed to win the first tournament of the year, defeating Uni\u00f3n Magdalena in the final, but in the second half failed to reach the final, so they had to fight for the title of the Primera B against Real Cartagena, losing on aggregate by 2-4. They played the promotion matches against Envigado F.C., but lost by a score of 3-1 on aggregate. In 2014 Deportivo Rionegro moved to Bello and changed its name to Leones F\u00fatbol Club. The following year they moved to Turbo where they stayed for another year before moving to Itag\u00fc\u00ed in 2016. Leones ended as runners-up in the 2017 Primera B, winning the Torneo Finalizaci\u00f3n and then going on to lose the final to Boyac\u00e1 Chic\u00f3 on penalty kicks. However, since they ended the season as the best team in the aggregate table, they earned promotion to the Categor\u00eda Primera A for the 2018 season, the first time the team will play in the first division. == Stadium == ==Honours== *Categor\u00eda Primera B: ::Runners- up (1): 2017 ==Players== ===Current squad=== ===Notable players=== * Iv\u00e1n C\u00f3rdoba (1993\u201395) * Samuel Vanegas (1996) * Vladimir Mar\u00edn (1999\u201301) * Neider Morantes (2005) * Ren\u00e9 Higuita (2008\u201309) * Jefferson Duque (2010\u201312) ==External links== *Leones FC page on DIMAYOR.com Category:Football clubs in Colombia Category:Association football clubs established in 1957 Category:1957 establishments in Colombia Category:Categor\u00eda Primera B clubs ",
