    "text": "Cannflavins are a group of chemical compounds found in Cannabis sativa. Chemically, they are prenylflavonoids and are unrelated to THC and other cannabinoids. Cannflavins A and B were first identified in the 1980s and cannflavin C was identified in 2008. Because cannflavins A and B are inhibitors of prostaglandin E2 production in vitro, the cannflavins have been studied for their potential use as anti-inflammatory agents. Cannflavins A and B are biosynthesized by prenylation of chrysoeriol. ==References== Category:Prenylflavonoids ",
