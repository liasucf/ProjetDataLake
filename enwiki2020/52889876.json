He has openly expressed his extreme views against atheism ---in November 2017, Asyraf stated that atheism was 'unconstitutional' and even suggested it is an offence under the Sedition Act. However, he reported that Facebook had rejected a joint government and Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission demand to shut down Atheist Republic's page and similar atheist pages, because the pages did not violate any of the company's community standards. == Family == Asyraf is the third son of Dusuki Ahmad, who was once President of YADIM, and Nik Nooraini Nik Yahya.
