    "text": "Chlorphentermine (trade names Apsedon, Desopimon, Lucofen) is a serotonergic appetite suppressant of the amphetamine family. Developed in 1962, it is the 4-chloro derivative of the better known appetite suppressant phentermine, which is still in current use. Chlorphentermine acts as a highly selective serotonin releasing agent (SRA). It is not a psychostimulant and has little or no abuse potential, but is classed as a Schedule III drug in the USA due mainly to its similarity to other appetite suppressants such as diethylpropion which have been more widely abused. It is no longer used due mainly to safety concerns, as it has a serotonergic effects profile similar to other withdrawn appetite suppressants such as fenfluramine and aminorex which were found to cause pulmonary hypertension and cardiac fibrosis following prolonged use. The plasma half-life is about five days. It was withdrawn from the market in the UK in 1974. == See also == * Aminorex * Cericlamine * Cloforex * Clortermine * Etolorex * Fenfluramine * Methylenedioxyphentermine * Phentermine == References == Category:5-HT2B agonists Category:Anorectics Category:Carbonic anhydrase activators Category:Chloroarenes Category:Serotonin receptor agonists Category:Serotonin releasing agents Category:Substituted amphetamines Category:Withdrawn drugs ",
