    "text": "The vision theory or vision hypothesis is a term used to cover a range of theories that question the physical resurrection of Jesus, and suggest that sightings of a risen Jesus were visionary experiences. It was first formulated by David Friedrich Strauss in the 19th century, and has been proposed in several forms by critical contemporary scholarship, including Helmut Koester, G\u00e9za Vermes, and Larry Hurtado, and members of the Jesus Seminar such as Gerd L\u00fcdemann. Christian apologists, scholars, and theologians object against the theory, taking the resurrection to be a literal, bodily phenomenon. ==Hypothesis== ===Subjective vision theory=== David Friedrich Strauss (1808-1874), in his \"Life of Jesus\" (1835), argued that the resurrection was not an objective historical fact, but a subjective \"recollection\" of Jesus, transfiguring the dead Jesus into an imaginary, or \"mythical,\" risen Christ. The appearance, or Christophany, of Jesus to Paul and others, was \"internal and subjective.\" Reflection on the Messianic hope, and , led to an exaltated state of mind, in which \"the risen Christ\" was present \"in a visionary manner,\" concluding that Jesus must have escaped the bondage of death. Strauss' thesis was further developed by Ernest Renan (1863) and Albert R\u00e9ville (1897).Rush Rhees (2007), The Life of Jesus of Nazareth: \"This last explanation has in recent times been revived in connection with the so-called vision-hypothesis by Renan and R\u00e9ville.\" These interpretations were later classed the \"subjective vision hypothesis\", and \"is advocated today by a great majority of New Testament experts.\" According to Ehrman, \"the Christian view of the matter [is] that the visions were bona fide appearances of Jesus to his followers\", a view which is \"forcefully stated in any number of publications.\" Ehrman further notes that \"Christian apologists sometimes claim that the most sensible historical explanation for these visions is that Jesus really appeared to the disciples.\" According to De Conick, the experiences of the risen Christ in the earliest written sources \u2013 the \"primitive Church\" creed of , Paul in and \u2013 are ecstatic rapture events. ====Exaltation of Jesus==== According to Hurtado, the resurrection experiences were religious experiences which \"seem to have included visions of (and/or ascents to) God's heaven, in which the glorified Christ was seen in an exalted position.\" These visions may mostly have appeared during corporate worship. Johan Leman contends that the communal meals provided a context in which participants entered a state of mind in which the presence of Jesus was felt. According to Ehrman, \"the disciples' belief in the resurrection was based on visionary experiences.\" Ehrman notes that both Jesus and his early followers were apocalyptic Jews, who believed in the bodily resurrection, which would start when the coming of God's Kingdom was near. Ehrman further notes that visions usually have a strong persuasive power, but that the Gospel-accounts also record a tradition of doubt about the appearances of Jesus. Ehrman's \"tentative suggestion\" is that only a few followers had visions, including Peter, Paul and Mary. They told others about those visions, convincing most of their close associates that Jesus was raised from the dead, but not all of them. Eventually, these stories were retold and embellished, leading to the story that all disciples had seen the risen Jesus. The belief in Jesus' resurrection radically changed their perceptions, concluding from his absence that he must have been exalted to heaven, by God himself, exalting him to an unprecented status and authority. ====Call to missionary activity==== According to Helmut Koester, the stories of the resurrection were originally epiphanies in which the disciples are called to a ministry by the risen Jesus, and at a secondary stage were interpreted as physical proof of the event. He contends that the more detailed accounts of the resurrection are also secondary and do not come from historically trustworthy sources, but instead belong to the genre of the narrative types. According to Gerd L\u00fcdemann, Peter had a vision of Jesus, induced by his feelings of guilt of betraying Jesus. The vision elevated this feeling of guilt, and Peter experienced it as a real appearance of Jesus, raised from dead. He convinced the other disciples that the resurrection of Jesus signalled that the endtime was near and God's Kingdom was coming, when the dead who would rise again, as evidenced by Jesus. This revitalized the disciples, starting-off their new mission.Gerd Luedemann in The Historical Jesus in Recent Research ed. James D. G. Dunn, Scot McKnight - 2005 Page 418: \"The thesis of an \u201cobjective vision\u201d has rightly found no echo in more recent scholarship, but Grass does more in his excellent book than provide a basis for the objective vision hypothesis.\" ===Cognitive dissonance reduction=== A further explanation is provided by the theory of cognitive dissonance. While Jesus' early followers expected the immediate installment of the Kingdom of God, the delay of this cosmic event led to a change in beliefs. According to a naturalistic explanation, in a process of cognitive dissonance reduction, Jewish scriptures were re-interpreted to explain the crucifixion and visionary post-mortem experiences of Jesus.Bart Ehrmann (June 4, 2016), Were Jesus\u2019 Followers Crazy? Was He? The belief that Jesus' resurrection signaled the imminent coming of the Kingdom of God changed into a belief that the resurrection confirmed the Messianic status of Jesus, and the belief that Jesus would return at some indeterminate time in the future, the Second Coming c.q. Parousia, heralding the expected endtime. The same process may have led to intensive proselytization, convincing others of the developing beliefs to reduce cognitive dissonance, explaining why the early group of followers grew larger despite the failing expectations. ==Criticism== Several Christian scholars such as Gary Habermas, William Lane Craig and Michael Morrison have argued against the vision explanations for the textual accounts of a physical resurrection.HabermasCraigMichael Morrison The Resurrection of Jesus: A History of Interpretation According to Habermas, most scholars on Christology are 'moderate conservatives', who believe that Jesus was raised from the dead, either physically or spiritually. While the vision theory has gained support among critical scholars since the last quarter of the 20th century,Gary Habermas (2001), The Late Twentieth-Century Resurgence of Naturalistic Responses to Jesus' Resurrection. Trinity Journal (TRINJ 22NS (2001) 179-196) \"the vast majority of scholars\" still reject the possibility of subjective visions or hallucinations as an explanation for the resurrection- experiences.Habermas, Gary, Resurrection Research From 1975 to the Present: What Are Critical Scholars Saying?. Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus 3, no. 2 (2005): 135-53. doi:10.1177/1476869005058192 Habermas himself views these critical approaches as \"efforts to dismiss the central event and doctrine of orthodox Christianity,\" Craig holds that the resurrection appearances are far too diverse to be classified as hallucinations; Craig and L\u00fcdemann entered a written debate on the subject in 2000.Charles Foster The Jesus Inquest: The Case For and Against the Resurrection of ... 2011 \"Gerd L\u00fcdemann in Paul Copan and Ronald K. Tacelli, ed., Jesus' Resurrection: Fact or Figment: A Debate Between William Lane Craig and Gerd L\u00fcdemann (Downers Grove, IL: IVP, 2000)\" British scholar NT Wright holds that visions of the dead were always associated with spirits and ghosts, and never with bodily resurrection. Thus, Wright argues, a mere vision of Jesus would never lead to the unprecedented belief that Jesus was a physically resurrected corpse; at most, he would be perceived as an exalted martyr standing at the right hand of God.Wright, N.T. \"Christian Origins and the Resurrection of Jesus: The Resurrection of Jesus as a Historical Problem.\" Sewanee Theological Review, 1998. Wright argues, \"precisely because such encounters [visions of the dead] were reasonably well known [...] they [the disciples] could not possibly, by themselves, have given rise to the belief that Jesus had been raised from the dead [...] Indeed, such visions meant precisely, as people in the ancient and modern worlds have discovered, that the person was dead, not that they were alive.\"Wright, N. T. Resurrection of the Son of God. Spck Publishing, 2003.690-691. Dale Allison has expressed similar criticisms, and has argued that visions alone would never lead to the belief in a bodily resurrection. He writes \u201cIf there was no reason to believe that his [Jesus's] solid body had returned to life, no one would have thought him, against expectation, resurrected from the dead. Certainly visions of or perceived encounters with a postmortem Jesus would not by themselves, have supplied such reason.\"Allison, Dale C. Resurrecting Jesus: the Earliest Christian Tradition and Its Interpreters. New York: T & T Clark, 2006. 324-325 German Biblical scholar Martin Hengel notes that L\u00fcdemann's theory transcends the limits of historical research, by providing an analysis which is not verifiable. ==See also== * Swoon hypothesis * Stolen body hypothesis * Historical Jesus * Historicity of Jesus ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== ;Printed sources * * * * * * * * * Gerd L\u00fcdemann, The Resurrection of Jesus, trans.
