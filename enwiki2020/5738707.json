    "text": "The Lynx reconnaissance vehicle (manufacturer's name: M113\u00bd Command and Reconnaissance Vehicle, abbr. M113 C&R;) is a United States-built tracked reconnaissance armoured fighting vehicle, which was employed by the armed forces of the Netherlands and Canada. Dutch vehicles were exported in the 1990s to BahrainFocus on: The Royal Bahraini Army (3): The M113 Family, WordPress. and Chile, according to SIPRI 35 and 8 vehicles respectively. The M113\u00bd was developed in 1963 as a private venture by FMC Corp., the manufacturer of the M113. It competed with the M114 but the US Army chose the M114 for production. The design was then offered to foreign buyers and gained the name Lynx when purchased by Canada. The Lynx was based on the M113, including its aluminum armor and many details of its construction. However, it is shorter in both length and height, and has four road wheels instead of five. This reduction in size led to a significant reduction in weight as well, dropping to about 8 tonne compared to over 12 for the original M113. The engine was moved to the rear and offered in gas and diesel versions. The Lynx is amphibious, propelled in the water by its tracks. Before swimming, a trim vane is erected at front, bilge pumps started, and covers mounted on the air intake and exhaust. In practice, crews would close hatches and ford shallow streams at high speed. ==Service history== The Royal Netherlands Army accepted 250 vehicles, beginning in 1966. The Dutch version of the Lynx has the driver front-left, radio operator/7.62mm machine gunner front-right, and a .50-calibre machine gun cupola centre. In the 1970s, the heavy machine gun was replaced by an Oerlikon-B\u00fchrle GBD-ADA turret mounting a 25mm KBA cannon. Dutch vehicles were later exported to Bahrain. The Dutch designated their vehicles the M113 C&V; Lynx of the Royal Canadian Hussars, installed in front of the C\u00f4te-des-Neiges Armoury, Montreal The Canadian Forces accepted 174 vehicles from 1968. Lynx's were issued to the reconnaissance squadron of an armoured regiment (D Sqn), as well as to squadrons of the armoured regiment assigned to the reconnaissance role, one squadron retaining the Ferret scout car. The squadron consisted of three troops, each equipped with five Lynxes, two two-vehicle patrols plus the troop leader's vehicle, four troops per squadron for the reconnaissance regiment. (Militia [reserve] armoured reconnaissance units trained for the role with Jeeps or Iltis 4\u00d74 trucks). In addition, nine Lynxes equipped the reconnaissance platoon of an infantry battalion's combat support company, as well as the reconnaissance sections of combat engineer field troops. In the Canadian Lynx, the crew commander's cupola is located middle-right, and the observer's hatch was rear-left. The commander operates the manually traversed M26 heavy machine gun cupola from inside the vehicle, but reloads it with the hatch open. The rear-facing observer operates the radio and fires the pintle-mounted 7.62mm machine gun. Behind the commander, on the floor, was a drop-down escape hatch. The Canadian Lynx was withdrawn from service in 1993, and replaced by 203 Coyote eight- wheeled reconnaissance vehicles by the end of 1996. ==Operators== * (M113 C&V; Status Unknown) * (Lynx; Former) Phased out in the 1990s * (M113 C&V; Status Unknown) * (M113 C&V; Former) Phased out in the 1990s * (Lynx; Tested Only) * (Both Variants; Tested only) ==Survivors== Canadian Forces College Existing Lynxes include several monuments and museum pieces, and a few running vehicles.
