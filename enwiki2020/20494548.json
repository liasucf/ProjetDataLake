    "text": "Sun Bear Concerts is a multi-concert album compilation of solo piano performances by Keith Jarrett that took place during his November 1976 tour in Japan. It was originally released as a ten-LP set and then as a six-CD box set containing 5 concerts plus encores, totalling 6:37:46 of music (applause included). The structures of the documented concerts follow a similar pattern: two very long non-stop improvisations (from 31 to 43 minutes approx) plus a possible encore. Accordingly, it was not until the 1989 CD release (ECM 1100, 843 028-2) that the full performances could be heard as a whole.Discogs Sun Bear Concerts accessed May 2020. ==November 1976 solo tour in Japan == All the music included in Sun Bear Concerts was recorded during Jarrett's solo tour in Japan which, according to www.keithjarrett.org, consisted of 8 concerts in 14 days:Keith Jarrett 1976 live concerts accessed May 16, 2020 * 5 - Kaikan Hall, Kyoto * 6 - Denki Hall, Fukuoka * 8 - Sankei Hall, Osaka * 10 - NHK Hall, Tokyo * 12 - Aichi Auditorium, Nagoya * 14 - Nakano Sun Plaza, Tokyo * 16 - Kanagawa Kenmin Hall, Yokohama * 18 - Hokkaido Kosei Nenkin Hall, Sapporo ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Richard S. Ginell awarded the album 4 stars, stating, \"While Sun Bear breaks little ground that his earlier solo piano albums had not already covered, it is nevertheless richly inventive within Jarrett's personal parameter of idioms. If price is not a barrier, the Jarrett devotee need not hesitate\".Ginell, R. S.
