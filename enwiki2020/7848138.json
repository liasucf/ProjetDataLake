    "text": "Pennsylvania Route 443 (PA 443) is an east-west state highway in the US state of Pennsylvania. The western terminus is at an intersection with State Route 3009 (SR 3009) at North Front Street on the east bank of the Susquehanna River in the community of Fort Hunter in Middle Paxton Township, just west of an interchange with the U.S. Route 22 (US 22)/US 322 freeway. The eastern terminus is at US 209 in Lehighton. The route runs through rural areas in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians in Dauphin, Lebanon, Schuylkill, and Carbon counties, serving Fort Indiantown Gap, Pine Grove, Schuylkill Haven, Orwigsburg, New Ringgold, and South Tamaqua. PA 443 intersects several major roads, including US 22/US 322 near its western terminus, PA 72 in Union Township, Interstate 81 (I-81) near Pine Grove, PA 61 between Schuylkill Haven and Orwigsburg, and PA 309 in South Tamaqua. PA 443 was designated in 1928 between PA 43 (Jonestown Road) in Harper Tavern and US 120 (now PA 61) in Schuylkill Haven. PA 925 was designated in 1928 to run between New Ringgold and PA 29 (now PA 309) in South Tamaqua. By 1930, the western terminus of PA 443 was moved to PA 43 west of Jonestown, heading south from Lickdale. In the 1930s, PA 443 was realigned at Green Point to run west to US 11/US 15/US 22/US 322 (North Front Street) on the east bank of the Susquehanna River, with the former alignment between Jonestown and Green Point becoming an extended PA 72, while PA 925 was extended west from New Ringgold to US 122 (now PA 61) west of Orwigsburg. In the 1940s, PA 443 was extended east from Schuylkill Haven to US 209/US 309 in Lehighton, replacing the entirety of PA 925 between Orwigsburg and South Tamaqua. North Front Street at the western terminus became unnumbered in 1977 when US 22/US 322 was shifted to a freeway a short distance to the east. ==Route description== ===Dauphin and Lebanon counties=== PA 443 begins at an intersection with SR 3009 (North Front Street) on the east bank of the Susquehanna River in the community of Fort Hunter in Middle Paxton Township, Dauphin County, heading northeast on Fishing Creek Valley Road, a two-lane divided highway. Shortly after beginning, the route comes to an interchange with the US 22/US 322 freeway and comes to a bridge over Norfolk Southern's Buffalo Line.

The road curves back to the east and runs between forested Blue Mountain to the north and farmland and homes to the south. PA 443 intersects Bow Creek Road, which heads south to provide access to I-81 and becomes PA 743 upon crossing US 22. Past this intersection, the route passes to the north of Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course as it continues northeast. PA 443 crosses into East Hanover Township in Lebanon County and continues through agricultural areas with some homes to the south of Blue Mountain, gaining a second westbound lane past the Pleasant View Road intersection.

The route narrows to two lanes and becomes Clement Avenue, passing to the northwest of Memorial Lake State Park before it enters the grounds of the Fort Indiantown Gap military reservation. PA 443 gains a second westbound lane again and curves east before it turns northwest onto two-lane Asher Miner Road. The road heads into forests within the Indiantown Gap in Blue Mountain and forms the border between East Hanover Township to the west and Union Township to the east before it fully enters Union Township and curves northeast as Moonshine Road, leaving the grounds of the military reservation. The route continues through forests with some fields and residences between Blue Mountain to the southeast and Second Mountain to the northwest.

After passing through the downtown area, PA 443 turns northwest onto Dock Street and runs through residential areas. The road bends north and comes to an intersection with PA 61. At this point, PA 443 turns east for a concurrency with PA 61 on Center Avenue, continuing past homes. The road leaves Schuylkill Haven for North Manheim Township and widens into a four-lane divided highway, running through business areas and passing to the south of the Penn State Schuylkill university campus. The two routes continues east-northeast past development before PA 443 splits from PA 61 at a jughandle-controlled intersection, with PA 443 heading northeast on two-lane undivided West Market Street, passing south of Blue Mountain High School. The route passes through the community of Bohrmans Mill and runs through a mix of farmland and residential and commercial development.

The route crosses the creek to fully enter Lehighton and curve northeast, passing more businesses. PA 443 comes to its eastern terminus at an intersection with US 209 on the west bank of the Lehigh River, where the road continues northeast as part of US 209 and crosses the river. ==History== When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, what would become PA 443 was designated as Legislative Route 141 between Harper Tavern and Lickdale and as Legislative Route 140 between Lickdale and Schuylkill Haven. PA 443 was designated in 1928 to run from PA 43 (Jonestown Road) in Harper Tavern northeast to US 120 (now PA 61) in Schuylkill Haven, following present-day PA 934 and Fisher Avenue northeast to Lickdale, present-day PA 72 north to Green Point, and its current alignment from Green Point to Schuylkill Haven. At this time, the route was paved between west of Pine Grove and Schuylkill Haven while the remainder was unpaved. PA 925 was designated in 1928 to run from New Ringgold northeast to PA 29 (now PA 309) in South Tamaqua along an unpaved road. The section of present-day PA 443 on West Market Street in Orwigsburg was part of US 120. By 1930, PA 443 was realigned at Lickdale to head south to a new western terminus at PA 43 (Jonestown Road) west of Jonestown. At this time, the entire length of PA 443 was paved. By 1930, the road running between Blue Mountain and Second Mountain along with the road between Orwigsburg and New Ringgold were both unnumbered, unpaved roads. In the 1930s, PA 443 was realigned at Green Point to head west to US 11/US 15/US 22/US 322 (North Front Street) on the east bank of the Susquehanna River north of Rockville along a paved road. The former alignment of the route between Jonestown and Green Point became a northern extension of PA 72. PA 925 was extended west from New Ringgold to US 122 (now PA 61) west of Orwigsburg in the 1930s; the route replaced the section of US 122 (which had replaced US 120) on West Market Street in Orwigsburg that was realigned to bypass the borough to the southwest. At this time, the entire length of PA 925 was paved. In addition, the highway between PA 29 south of South Tamaqua and Lehighton was constructed as an unnumbered paved road in the 1930s. In the 1940s, PA 443 was extended east from US 122 in Schuylkill Haven to US 209/US 309 in Lehighton along its current alignment. The route replaced the entire length of PA 925 between Orwigsburg and South Tamaqua. In addition, the route was widened to a multilane road between the border of Dauphin and Lebanon counties and Fort Indiantown Gap. In 1977, US 22/US 322 were shifted from North Front Street to a freeway a short distance to the east; the western terminus of PA 443 remained at unnumbered North Front Street a short distance to the west of an interchange with the US 22/US 322 freeway. The route was widened into a divided highway in the vicinity of the interchange. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== *Pennsylvania Route 443 Junction List *Pennsylvania Highways - Pennsylvania Route 443 443 Category:Transportation in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Lebanon County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Carbon County, Pennsylvania ",
