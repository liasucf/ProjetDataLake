    "text": "Violette Tr\u00e9panier (born March 14, 1945) is a Canadian politician in the province of Quebec. She was a Liberal member of the National Assembly of Quebec from 1985 to 1994 and was a minister in the governments of Robert Bourassa and Daniel Johnson. ==Early life and career== Tr\u00e9panier was born in Montreal. She studied at the normal school of Saint-Lambert and has a bachelor's degree in education from the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al (1966). She was a French teacher from 1966 to 1976. Tr\u00e9panier became a political attach\u00e9 to legislator Jean-Pierre Saintonge in 1981. She was chosen as vice-president of the Quebec Liberal Party the following year and served in this capacity until 1985. ==Legislator and cabinet minister== ;Bourassa government Tr\u00e9panier was elected to the Quebec legislature in the 1985 provincial election, defeating Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) incumbent Huguette Lachapelle in the Montreal division of Dorion. The Liberal Party won a majority government in this election, and Tr\u00e9panier entered the legislature as a backbench supporter of Robert Bourassa's administration. From December 13, 1985, to March 3, 1989, she was the parliamentary assistant to the minister of municipal affairs. She was promoted to the provincial ministry on March 3, 1989, serving as the junior minister responsible for cultural communities and immigration.Benoit Aubin, \"Ryan gets tough language post in Quebec's cabinet shuffle,\" Globe and Mail, 4 March 1989, A8. She assisted Monique Gagnon-Tremblay, who held the full cabinet portfolio for these files.Don McPherson, \"Cabinet shuffle makes a joke of war on pollution,\" Montreal Gazette, 7 March 1989, B3. Tr\u00e9panier was re- elected over PQ candidate Joseph Facal in the 1989 provincial election and was reassigned as the minister responsible for the status of women and minister responsible for the family on October 11, 1989. During ceremonies marking the fiftieth anniversary of women's suffrage in Quebec in April 1990, Tr\u00e9panier said that the greatest challenge of modern Quebec women was to create a society where family and work were compatible. \"What women need is day care, flexible work schedules, maternity leave, pay equity and a lot of vigilance because the gains we have made are very fragile,\" she said.Andre Picard, \"Celebration of Quebec suffrage marred by women's infighting,\" Globe and Mail, 26 April 1990, A10. Later in the same year, she introduced a bill allowing parents to take thirty-four weeks of unpaid parental leave after the birth or adoption of a child; she described the bill as the first step toward paid parental leave.Rheal Seguin, \"Parental leave extended,\" Globe and Mail, 15 November 1990, A11. She also ensured passage of a bill requiring that all divorcing couples in Quebec equally split the value of most shared assets developed during their relationship.\"Quebec makes divorcing couples share,\" Globe and Mail, 27 December 1990, A8. Tr\u00e9panier criticized the federal government of Brian Mulroney for cutting universal child care benefits and cancelling funding targeted to day care.Patricia Poirier, \"Quebec raps Ottawa in family feud,\" Globe and Mail, 14 April 1992, A7. She introduced legislation in April 1992 to guarantee mandatory child support payments in the event of a separation or divorce, create 7,500 new day care spaces in three years, and set aside $1.8 million for pilot projects to enhance family life. She also re- affirmed her support for Quebec's universal family allowance policy, intended to encourage couples to have more children, which was introduced shortly before she was appointed to cabinet.Rheal Seguin, \"Quebec to pay child support,\" Globe and Mail, 14 April 1992, A7. In late 1993, she introduced a new government policy document on women that proposed an employment equity law for all public sector and some private sector organizations with over one hundred employees. Some provincial groups representing women criticized the document as being for the most part vague and unspecific.Don Macdonald, \"Groups assail Quebec's new policy on women,\" Ottawa Citizen, 24 September 1993, A12. Tr\u00e9panier was the minister responsible for the status women at the time of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre, in which lone gunman Marc Lepine shot and murdered fourteen women at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al. In common with other female members of Bourassa's cabinet, Tr\u00e9panier cautioned against interpreting the massacre as anything other than the act of a single psychopathic individual.Robert McKenzie, \"Ontario, Quebec see massacre differently,\" Toronto Star, 12 December 1989, A21. ;Johnson government Tr\u00e9panier supported Daniel Johnson's successful bid to succeed Robert Bourassa as leader of the Quebec Liberal Party and premier of Quebec in January 1994.\"Bourassa's deputy won't seek top job,\" Toronto Star, 30 September 1993, A17. When Johnson became premier on January 11, 1994, he appointed Tr\u00e9panier to a full cabinet position as minister of revenue security. She also retained ministerial responsibility for the status of women and the family. In March 1994, Tr\u00e9panier and employment minister Serge Marcil announced a $17.2 million program to assist persons on social assistance in starting up small businesses. Critics charged that it would be ineffective as it required recipients to provide two thousand dollars in cash or goods toward their project; some argued this was an unrealistic sum.Dorothy Guinan, \"$17 million allotted to help poor start businesses,\" Montreal Gazette, 23 March 1994, A6. Tr\u00e9panier later announced the expansion of a program that encouraged social assistance recipients to accept temporary jobs for non-profit organizations.Elizabeth Thompson, \"Quebec expands welfare-work program,\" Montreal Gazette, 27 May 1994, A5. Tr\u00e9panier also announced in March 1994 that Quebec would increase its monthly breastfeeding subsidy from $15 to $37.50, while simultaneously reducing funds for milk formula, in an effort to encourage more low-income women to nurse their infants. This decision received international attention.Clyde H. Farnsworth, \"Montreal Journal; Quebec Bets on Subsidized Milk, Mother's Kind,\" New York Times, 5 April 1994, p. 4. Farnsworth's article was also covered in other American newspapers. She was not a candidate in the 1994 provincial election and formally resigned from cabinet on September 26, 1994. She became director of recruiting and financing for the Quebec Liberal Party in 2001 and still held this position as of 2010.\"Former staffers contradict Bellemare's testimony\", CTV Montreal, 13 September 2010, accessed 24 March 2011. ==Federal politics== Tr\u00e9panier supported Liberal Party of Canada parliamentarian Marcel Prud'homme in his successful bid for re-election in the 1988 federal election.Robert McKenzie, \"Bourassa-Mulroney compact is alive and well,\" Toronto Star, 10 July 1988, B1. The provincial and federal Liberal parties are not formally aligned, and many Quebec Liberals in this period supported the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. ==Electoral record== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Montreal Category:Quebec Liberal Party MNAs Category:Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al alumni Category:Women MNAs in Quebec ",
