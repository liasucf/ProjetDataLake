It was created in 1985 when Tenneco bought selected assets of the agricultural division from International Harvester and merged it into its J.I. Case Company (IH itself then became Navistar.) Today Case IH is owned by CNH Industrial, which in turn is financially controlled by the Italian investment company Exor, which belongs to the Agnelli family. ==Products== Case IH offers agricultural equipment, financial services, as well as parts and service support for farmers and commercial operators through a network of dealers and distributors. Productivity enhancing products include tractors; combines and harvesters; hay and forage equipment; tillage tools; planting and seeding systems; sprayers and applicators; and site-specific farming tools. Case IH has won many AE50 awards from the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers, ASABE, for their products. Some of Case IH's most famous equipment models include Axial-Flow combines, Magnum tractors, Steiger and Farmall. == History == Case IH history began when, in 1842, Jerome Case founded Racine Threshing Machine Works on the strength of his innovative thresher. In 1869 Case expanded into the steam engine business and, by 1886, Case was the world's largest manufacturer of steam engines. The company's founder died in 1891 at the age of 72. In 1892, Case was the first company to build a diesel-powered tractor. In 1911, The J.I. Case Company had three cars in the first Indianapolis 500. In 1967, Tenneco purchased J.I. Case, continuing to market the products under the Case name.

They changed their brand name to Case International at first, and then abbreviated that to Case IH. International Harvester had been in economic turmoil since 1980, but was still one of the largest tractor manufacturers in the world. Merging the two lines brought together the best of both traditions, offering a full line of agricultural equipment, and probably saved both companies from becoming a victim of the 1980s farming recession. In 1986, Case IH purchased Steiger Tractor and began producing their 4-wheel drive tractors under the Case IH name. In 1987, Case IH released the Case IH Magnum series, creating the first tractor to be built by Case and International Harvester together. In 1989, Case IH released the first Maxxum series tractor. In 1995, Case IH becomes the first agricultural manufacturer to release Advanced Farming Systems with global positioning system technology. In 1996, Case IH released the first Steiger Quadtrack. In 1997, Case IH took over Fortschritt. Fortschritt was an East German brand of tractors, combine harvesters and other agricultural machines made by VEB Fortschritt (part of the IFA) in Neustadt, Saxony. ;Merging with New Holland to create CNH Global In 1999, Case IH merged with New Holland Ag to form a new parent company, CNH Global. The majority owner of CNH Global is Fiat Industrial. In 2005, a STX500 Steiger Quadtrac tractor shattered the World Plowing Record, turning of farmland in just 24 hours.March 22, 2005 news release In 2006, the Case IH logo was displayed on a pair of Ferraris as part of the Ferrari Panamerican 20,000\u2014a journey that took new Ferraris through 16 countries and across 20,000 miles (32,000 km) during a 15-stage, 84-day tour.August 4, 2006 news release The International Harvester \"IH\" logo in Case IH represents the head-on view of a farmer driving a tractor. The \"I\" symbolizes the driver of a tractor and is known as the red driver \"I\". 2007 was the Steiger tractor's 50th anniversary. At present, CNH Global continues to manufacture the tractors branded Case IH. All Case IH equipment can use (B5) biodiesel from approved suppliers and nearly half of the models sold globally are approved, following proper protocols, for 100 percent biodiesel (B100).March 1, 2007 news release == Factory locations == * Benson, Minnesota - Cotton Harvesters, Application Equipment * Ferreyra, Argentina - Combine harvesters, Puma tractors * Curitiba, Brazil - Farmall, Maxxum and Magnum Tractors * Grand Island, Nebraska - Combines, Windrowers * Jesi, Italy - Tractors * Fargo, North Dakota - Tractors * Piracicaba, Brazil - Sugarcane harvesters, Sprayers, Coffee harvesters and Planters * Racine, Wisconsin - Tractors * Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - Crop Production Equipment * Sorocaba, Brazil - 7230, 8230 and 9230 Combines * St. Valentin, Austria - Tractors * Burlington, Iowa * Basildon, England - Tractors * Goodfield, Illinois - Tillage Equipment * New Holland, Pennsylvania - Round Balers, Square balers, Pull-type Forage Harvesters, Disc Mower Conditioners and Box Spreaders * T\u00fcrkTrakt\u00f6r, T\u00fcrkiye - Tractors * CNH Industrial (India) Pvt limited - Tractors and harvesting equipment * Burr Ridge, Illinois - Technical Center * Quer\u00e9taro, M\u00e9xico - Tractors * HEPCO, Iran - Sugarcane harvesters == Gallery == File:Case IH 3594 tractor.jpg|Case IH 3594 tractor File:Case IH Magnum 275.jpg|Case IH Magnum 275 AFS tractor File:CASE STX480.jpg|Case IH Steiger STX 480 tractor File:Case IH AFS 600 QuadTrac.JPG|Case IH AFS 600 QuadTrac File:Case combine.jpg|Case IH AFX 8010 combine File:CaseIH 9120 Combine.JPG|Case IH Axial-Flow AFX 9120 combine File:Case IH Steiger 435 tractor.jpg == References == ==External links== * Official Website * CASE Construction Equipment division of CNH Industrial * New Holland division of CNH Industrial * List of CaseIH tractor models Category:CNH Industrial Category:Engineering vehicles Category:Tractor manufacturers of the United States Category:Tractor manufacturers of Argentina Category:Lawn and garden tractors Category:Companies based in Racine, Wisconsin Category:American brands Category:Diesel engine manufacturers ",
