    "text": "Umberto Bottazzini (born 1947 in Viadana, Lombardy) is an Italian historian of mathematics, writing on the history of mathematics and the foundations of mathematics. ==Biography== Bottazzini graduated in 1973 with the Laurea degree from the University of Milan. He was an associate professor of matematiche complementari (an Italian academic discipline involving the history of mathematics, foundations of mathematics, and mathematical didactics) from 1977 to 1979 at the University of Calabria and from 1979 to 1990 at the University of Bologna. From 1990 to 2004 he was a professor ordinarius in the department of mathematics and computer science at the University of Palermo. He was for the academic year 1995\u20131996 a resident fellow at MIT's Dibner Institute for the History of Science and Technology. From 1996 to 1999 he was a fellow of the interdisciplinary Research Center Beniamino Segre of Rome's Accademia dei Lincei. From 2002 to 2006 he was a lecturer in the history of science at Trieste's Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati (SISSA), where he still maintains collaborative relations. From 2003 to 2004 he also taught at Milan's Vita-Salute San Raffaele University. Since 2004 he is a professor ordinarius of matematiche complementari at the University of Milan. Bottazzini's research deals with the development of mathematical analysis in the 19th century, especially the work of Bernhard Riemann, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, and Karl Weierstrass. Bottazzini was the editor, with added commentary, for a new edition of Cauchy's Cours d'analyse; the new edition was published in Bologna in 1990 by CLUEB (Cooperativa Libraria Universitaria Editrice Bologna). He has a wife and son. ==Awards and honors== * 1993 \u2014 Corresponding Member of the International Academy for the History of Sciences * 2002 \u2014 Invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Beijing arXiv preprint * 2012 \u2014 Fellow of the American Mathematical Society * 2015 \u2014 Albert Leon Whiteman Memorial Prize ==Selected publications== * * The Higher Calculus.
