He shot so much footage that he turned it into a documentary, Climbing the Matterhorn, which won an Oscar. He used color film from Ansco on the understanding that if the results were unsatisfactory the company could have the film back. However the results were so good Ansco did a deal with Allen for him to use three films in color. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1947 films Category:1947 drama films Category:1947 romantic drama films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American romantic drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Irving Allen Category:Films scored by Lyn Murray Category:Films set in Switzerland Category:Films set in the Alps Category:Foreign films shot in Switzerland Category:Monogram Pictures films Category:Mountaineering films ",
