The early-15th-century Glossary of Beszterce, the most ancient currently known Hungarian \"dictionary\", reveals that the ultimate ancestor of flat breads was the panis focacius attributed to the Romans (of which derives also the Italian flat bread called focaccia). In ancient Rome, panis focacius was a flat bread baked in the ashes of the fireplace (cf. Latin focus meaning \"fireplace\"). The modern l\u00e1ngos, despite its name, is not prepared near an open flame but rather by deep-fat frying, and among Hungarian foods it is instead the pog\u00e1csa which preserves the connection, both etymological and culinary, to the ancient panis focacius. Lalanga was present both in the Byzantine and Ottoman cuisines; whilst in the former it was only eaten as a sweet, in Ottoman Turkey it was eaten both as a sweet dish with honey or as a savoury, with cheese. Lalanga continues to exist in the Turkish cuisine, as well as in the Greek Cuisine (mostly in Peloponnese) as Lalagia (In Greek \u039b\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03b3\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1). ==Variations== L\u00e1ngos topped with grated cheese, sour cream, bacon, onion and parsley The dough for l\u00e1ngos is made of water or milk, flour, yeast, and salt. The ingredients are worked together either by hand or a kneading machine. As the yeast starts to metabolize the carbohydrates in the flour, carbon dioxide is released which causes the dough to rise, creating the air bubbles in the l\u00e1ngos. The dough is basically the same as pizza dough, but it is not baked but fried in oil. Adding sour cream, yoghurt or mashed potatoes to the dough is optional but highly encouraged, in the latter case it is called potato l\u00e1ngos (in Hungarian krumplis l\u00e1ngos). It is eaten fresh and warm, topped with sour cream and grated cheese, or Liptauer, ham, or sausages, or most frequently, without toppings, just rubbed with garlic or garlic butter, or doused with garlic water. Other ingredients and accompaniments can be mushroom, quark cheese, eggplant, cabbage, kefir, omelet, and a confectioner's sugar or jam. L\u00e1ngos being fried Traditionally l\u00e1ngos was baked in the front of the brick oven close to the flames. This is the basis for its name; \"l\u00e1ng\" which means \"flame\" in the Hungarian language. L\u00e1ngos was made from bread dough and was served as breakfast on the days when new bread was baked. Now that people no longer have brick ovens nor bake bread at home, l\u00e1ngos is virtually always fried in oil. L\u00e1ngos is popular all year long. As it is a rather affordable and simple food, it is often sold around bus stations, fairs, local markets and all over Eastern European countries during local celebrations or sport events. It is sold at many fast-food restaurants not only in Hungary but also in Austria. In Austria, especially in Vienna, l\u00e1ngos is very popular as a fast food at fairs and in amusement parks like the Prater. L\u00e1ngos is known in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Croatia as lango\u0161, in Serbia as langu\u0161 (although it is commonly called \"Mekike\"). In Slovenia is known as Langa\u0161. In Bulgaria it is known as Mekitsi. It is also popular in Romania (especially in Transylvania) as lango\u0219i. It is also extremely popular in Poland where it is known as \"langosz\" and in the UK where it's called \"langos\" or \"Hungarian Fried Bread.\" ==See also== * List of doughnut varieties * List of deep fried foods * Frybread * Shelpek * Bhatoora * Mekitsa * BeaverTails * National symbols of Hungary * ==References== ==External links== * Category:Hungarian cuisine Category:Flatbreads Category:Romanian breads Category:Ottoman cuisine Category:Street food Category:Doughnuts Category:Greek breads Category:Turkish breads ",
