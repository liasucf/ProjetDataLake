The prints were released as a limited edition of 5,000, of which the first 200 were signed, and retailed for $70. \"Progress,\" by Scott Hansen, was released on May 23, 2008 as a limited edition of 5,000, and retailed for $70. \"Yes We Can,\" by illustrator Antar Dayal, was the third print in the series.

The signed and numbered prints were sold by the Obama Inaugural Committee for $500, while the unsigned and unnumbered prints were sold for $100. == Resale == Many of the Artists for Obama prints were bought by investors who bought multiple copies of each poster. After the prints sold out, investors subsequently resold the prints, usually over eBay, at a several hundred percent profit. Immediately after Barack Obama won the 2008 presidential election, prices for the prints skyrocketed. The prices have since decreased and stabilized. ==References== == External links == * Category:Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign ",
