She was the second child and daughter of Queen Joan II of Navarre and King Philip III of Navarre.Marguerite Keane, Material Culture and Queenship in 14th-century France: The Testament of Blanche of Navarre (1331-1398), (Brill, 2016), 43-44. She belonged to the House of \u00c9vreux, a cadet branch of the House of Capet, and married into the House of Valois, another cadet branch of the House of Capet. ==Life== At first, the Kings of Navarre wanted to achieve an alliance with Castile by having Blanche marry Peter, eldest son and heir apparent of King Alfonso XI. However, Blanche was eventually betrothed to John, heir apparent to the throne of France. As the most beautiful princess of her time \u2014 she was nicknamed the \"Beautiful Wisdom\" (Belle Sagesse)\u2014 Blanche captivated the recently widowed King Philip VI of France, father of her intended husband and almost forty years her senior. Their marriage on 29 January 1350 at Brie-Comte-Robert alienated his son and many nobles from the king. The union was short-lived: King Philip VI died seven months later, on 22 August 1350, according to some chroniclers of exhaustion from constantly fulfilling his conjugal duties. Pregnant at that time, Blanche gave birth to a daughter, Joan (also named Blanche), in May 1351. After her husband's death, the dowager queen retired to Neaufles-Saint- Martin near Gisors in Normandy. Soon after, Peter, now king of Castile, asked her hand in marriage, but she refused the offer, saying that the queens of France never remarry. She appeared in the French court on rare occasions, especially during the solemn entry of Isabeau of Bavaria in Paris, which was organized by her. Queen Blanche also played a political role as a mediator between her brother King Charles II of Navarre and France. In 1371, her only daughter Joan was engaged with John, eldest son and heir of King Peter IV of Aragon; however, she died during the journey to Aragon for her marriage on 16 September 1371 in B\u00e9ziers.Marguerite Keane, Material Culture and Queenship in 14th-century France: The Testament of Blanche of Navarre (1331-1398), 2-3. ==Death== Blanche died on 5 October 1398 at Neaufles-Saint-Martin. She is buried next to her daughter in the Basilica of St Denis, the necropolis of the Kings of France, north of Paris. ==Ancestry== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1331 births Category:1398 deaths Category:Navarrese infantas Category:House of \u00c9vreux Category:French queens consort Category:14th-century French women Category:14th-century French people Category:Burials at the Basilica of St Denis ",
