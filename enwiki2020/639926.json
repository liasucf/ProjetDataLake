In Saxon, the name \"Feld\" describes 'a large area of pasture land' , while the term \"Dere\" refers to the deer which inhabited the forest. When combined, this gives the name Derefeld which later became Darfield.

Darfield remained an insignificant agricultural village for many centuries to come, until 1862.

Darfield Main colliery and Mitchell's Main were local mines, the population of the village quickly increased and it became a labour pool for the surrounding coalmines. By 1901, over 4,000 people lived there compared to just 600 inhabitants in 1851. Until June 1963, Darfield had a railway station on the Sheffield - Cudworth - Leeds line. The line itself closed in 1988 due to severe mining subsidence. ==Community== Darfield shops include a Co-op supermarket, a florist's, baker's, newsagent's, two hairdresser's, garage/MOT station, a post office, greetings card shop, and a hardware & homeware shop.
