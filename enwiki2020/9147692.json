    "text": "West-Souburg is a village in the Dutch province of Zeeland. It is part of the municipality of Vlissingen, and now almost completely surrounded by suburbs of the city of Vlissingen. Once one of the most important settlements on the Zeeland island of Walcheren, West-Souburg is now a very small place that some consider nothing more than a suburb of Vlissingen. West-Souburg was a separate municipality until 1835, when it was merged with Oost-Souburg to create the municipality of Oost- en West-Souburg which merged with Vlissingen in 1966. ==References== Category:Populated places in Zeeland Category:Former municipalities of Zeeland Category:Vlissingen ",
