    "text": "\"I Second That Emotion\" is a 1967 song written by Smokey Robinson and Al Cleveland. First charting as a hit for Smokey Robinson and the Miracles on the Tamla/Motown label in 1967, \"I Second That Emotion\" was later a hit single for the group duet Diana Ross & the Supremes and The Temptations, also on the Motown label. ==Song origin== One morning in 1967, Robinson and Cleveland were shopping at Hudson's, a Detroit department store. Robinson found a set of pearls for his wife, Claudette. \"They're beautiful.\" he said to the salesperson. \"I sure hope she likes them.\" Cleveland then added \"I second that emotion.\" Both songwriters laughed at Cleveland's malapropism; he had meant to say \"I second that motion.\" The two were immediately inspired to write a song using the incorrect phrase.The Complete Motown Singles Vol. 7: 1967, Motown/Hip-O Select B0008993-02, 2007, liner notes, p. 85. ==The Miracles' original version== The Miracles' original version of the song finds lead singer and co-writer Smokey Robinson courting a girl who, weary of the game of love, prefers to string her men along and not get romantically involved. Robinson \"wants no part\" in such a relationship, but promises that if the girl changes her mind, he'll be around (\"If you feel like lovin' me/if you've got the notion/I second that emotion.\") This version peaked for three weeks in the United States at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 1967. It became the Miracles highest charting popular single since \"Shop Around\". In this song, guitarists Eddie Willis and Robert White came up with their own guitar licks and riffs for this song based on a chord chart that was given to them by Robinson (this is a classic example of the creativity the Funk Brothers brought to the table during the recording sessions they participated in at the Snake Pit). Regular Miracles guitarist Marv Tarplin was also present on the song. The song also topped the Billboard Best Selling R&B; Singles chart\"Best Selling R&B; Singles\", Billboard, January 13, 1968. p. 31. Retrieved June 23, 2018. and was a million-selling hit for The Miracles, their sixth overall. The song was also a top 30 hit in the UK in 1967, reaching No. 27. === Personnel === The Miracles * Lead vocals by Smokey Robinson * Background vocals by Claudette Rogers Robinson, Pete Moore, Ronnie White, and Bobby Rogers. * Guitar by Marv Tarplin * Other instrumentation by The Funk Brothers === Charts === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1967\u201368) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report) |98 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada (CHUM) |2 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Soul Survey (RPM) |3 |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|US Cash Box Top 100 |3 |} ==Diana Ross & the Supremes and The Temptations version== The song was covered and released by a group duet of Motown labelmates Diana Ross & the Supremes and The Temptations in 1969.

In Japan, \"Quiet Life\" had been released as a single in 1979, so \"European Son\" was released as the B-side instead. In 1982, the song was remixed by Steve Nye and released as a single, with the B-side \"Halloween\" originally released on the album Quiet Life. In Australia, the single was released with the B-side as the 1978 re-recorded version of \"Adolescent Sex\", originally from the band's debut album of the same name. === Track listings === 7\": Ariola Hansa / AHA 559 (1980, UK) # \"Second That Emotion\" \u2013 3:45 # \"Quiet Life\" \u2013 3:51 7\": Ariola Hansa / VIPX-1501 (1980, Japan) # \"I Second That Emotion\" \u2013 3:46 # \"European Son\" \u2013 3:40 7\": Hansa / HANSA 12 (1982, UK) # \"I Second That Emotion\" \u2013 3:52 # \"Halloween\" \u2013 4:23 12\": Hansa / HANSA 12-12 (1982, UK) # \"I Second That Emotion\" (extended remix) \u2013 5:15 # \"Halloween\" \u2013 4:23 7\": RCA Victor / 104039 (1982, Australia) # \"I Second That Emotion\" \u2013 3:50 # \"Adolescent Sex\" \u2013 4:10 === Personnel === * David Sylvian \u2013 vocals, guitar, keyboards * Richard Barbieri \u2013 keyboards * Rob Dean \u2013 guitar * Mick Karn \u2013 fretless bass, saxophone * Steve Jansen \u2013 drums * John Punter \u2013 producer * Nigel Walker \u2013 engineer * Steve Nye \u2013 remixing (1982) === Charts === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1982) !Peak position |- |- |} ==In popular culture== In 1983, the song appeared on The Big Chill soundtrack Disc 1, Track 8. On June 18, 2012, American Songwriter named \"I Second That Emotion\" its \"Lyric of The Week\". The publication wrote: the song \"marches to the beat of its own drum, thanks to three stanzas of crafty doo-wop poetry and one punny one-liner\u2014a malapropism, if you want to get technical\u2014that never really loses its novelty appeal\". The song was often performed by The Jerry Garcia Band. Between the years 1976 to 1994, The Jerry Garcia Band performed the song 154 times, not including seven live performances by The Grateful Dead. ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * I Second That Emotion- by The Miracles - Joel Francis' song review for The Daily Record ==External links== * Category:1967 singles Category:1969 singles Category:1982 singles Category:1967 songs Category:Tamla Records singles Category:Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs number-one singles Category:Hansa Records singles Category:The Miracles songs Category:Motown singles Category:Song recordings produced by Smokey Robinson Category:Songs written by Al Cleveland Category:Songs written by Smokey Robinson Category:The Supremes songs Category:The Temptations songs ",
