    "text": "__NOTOC__ Oberscharf\u00fchrer of the Waffen-SS (Kurt Sametreiter) Oberscharf\u00fchrer (, ) was a Nazi Party paramilitary rank that existed between 1932 and 1945. Oberscharf\u00fchrer was first used as a rank of the Sturmabteilung (SA) and was created due to an expansion of the enlisted positions required by growing SA membership in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The SA rank of Oberscharf\u00fchrer was senior to Scharf\u00fchrer and junior to the rank of Truppf\u00fchrer. Since early ranks of the Schutzstaffel (SS) were identical to the ranks of SA, Oberscharf\u00fchrer was created as an SS rank at the same time the position was created within the SA. Initially, the rank of SS-Oberscharf\u00fchrer was equal to its SA counterpart; however, this changed in 1934 following the Night of the Long Knives. At that time, the SS rank system was reorganized and several new ranks established with older SA titles discontinued. The rank of SS- Oberscharf\u00fchrer was therefore \"bumped up\" and became equal to an SA- Truppf\u00fchrer. The insignia for the SS rank was changed, as well, becoming two silver collar pips in contrast to the SA insignia for Oberscharf\u00fchrer which was a single collar pip with silver stripe. Within the SA, an Oberscharf\u00fchrer was typically a squad leader, answering to a platoon non-commissioned officer. The responsibilities varied across a wider range in the SS, in particular between an Oberscharf\u00fchrer in the Allgemeine SS (general SS) and one holding the same position in the Waffen-SS (armed SS). After 1938, when the SS adopted field grey uniforms as the standard duty attire, SS-Oberscharf\u00fchrer displayed the shoulder insignia of a Wehrmacht Feldwebel. The rank of SS-Oberscharf\u00fchrer was junior to SS-Hauptscharf\u00fchrer. ==Insignia== SS-Oberscharf\u00fchrer h.svg|Shoulder strap SS-Oberscharf\u00fchrer (SS-Standartenjunker) NSFK-Oberscharf\u00fchrer.svg|NSFK Gorget patches NSKK- Oberscharf\u00fchrer.svg|NSKK Gorget patch SA-Oberscharf\u00fchrer.svg|SA Gorget patch SS-Oberscharf\u00fchrer.svg|SS Gorget patches HJ-Oberscharf\u00fchrer.svg|HJ shoulder strap Fw Oscha OR6 cam slv 1945.svg|SS smock insignia {| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.5em auto; clear: both;\" |- align=\"center\" |width=\"30%\"| Junior rank Scharf\u00fchrer !width=\"40%\"| SS rank Oberscharf\u00fchrer |width=\"30%\"| Senior rank Hauptscharf\u00fchrer |- align=\"center\" |width=\"30%\"| Junior rank Scharf\u00fchrer !width=\"40%\"| SA rank Oberscharf\u00fchrer |width=\"30%\"| Senior rank Truppf\u00fchrer |} ==See also== * Table of ranks and insignia of the Waffen-SS ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * * Category:SS ranks ",
