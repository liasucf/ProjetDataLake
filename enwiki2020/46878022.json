The series is broadcast on the internet and premiered on May 1, 2012. Season one includes eight episodes, with season two currently under development. Chop Socky Boom follows the adventures of misfit indie film actors cast in the fictional kung fu film, \u201cFinal Zodiac Warrior.\u201d CSB focuses on main character Khanh and her friends, Scottie, Paige, Daisy and Max, as they audition for a poorly run chop socky series created by Trick, an Ed Wood like Director with his own unique vision. == History == Chop Socky Boom was created by Sellers and Ward as a tribute to the adventures and misadventures of Seattle indie filmmaking. The first season was funded in part through a crowdfunding campaign and from a small grant awarded by 4Culture. In May, 2012 CSB premiered on YouTube and the Web Series Channel and was featured by Zombie Orpheus Entertainment (ZOE), a distribution company created by Dead Gentlemen Productions. In 2014, CSB was picked up for distribution by Frostbite Pictures and is currently available on JTS.TV. == Plot == Khanh is a talented, Seattle actress working hard to find her big break. She and eleven other local actors are cast in a new action show, \u201cFinal Zodiac Warrior.\u201d FZW is a cross between Enter the Dragon and Highlander and features twelve warriors based on the Chinese zodiac. Portraying the signs of Rat, Pig, Rabbit, Rooster and Dragon, Khanh and her friends survive the indie film making process, all the while doing battle with their own individual demons. Be it mistreatment from their fabulous and beautiful cast member counterparts, ambiguous direction from the director Trick, or even the threat of looming unemployment at the day job, the misfits boldly fight the demons. ==Production== Principal photography takes place in Seattle, Washington.
