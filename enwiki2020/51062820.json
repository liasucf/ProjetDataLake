As of 2016, it ranks as the world's 10th largest reinsurer in terms of gross written premiums. ==History== Founded in 1963 as a state-funded enterprise, Korean Re was privatised in 1978. In October 2002, it was nominated as 'Reinsurance Company of the Year' by Asia Insurance Review. In May 2010, Korean Re was selected as \"Emerging Market Player of the Year\" by Reinsurance Magazine. ==Business== Korean Re has a diversified underwriting portfolio that consists of personal business (long-term, motor, and life reinsurance) and commercial lines (property, marine, casualty, and bond reinsurance). Over the last decade Korean Re has expanded into overseas markets. As of 2015, more than 22% of its gross written premiums were generated from abroad.

This growth was driven by an increase in personal lines, such as long term and life insurance. A strong rebound in premium income from overseas property and casualty treaties also bolstered the overall top-line growth. Korean Re expected to see its net profit for 2016 hit a new high on growing demand for its reinsurance packages from top insurance companies.Korean Reinsurance Company, \"Turning Vision into action\", annual report 2015 p. 45Pulse by Maeil Business News Korea, \"Rosy earnings outlook for Korean Re in 2016\", http://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?no=426172&year;=2016 2016.6.14 Korean Re has been seeing an increase in the number of new contracts with top insurers after Standard & Poor's raised its credit rating by one notch to A from A- in 2014.
