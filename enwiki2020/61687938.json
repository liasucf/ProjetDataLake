    "text": "Mar\u00eda Elena \u00c1lvarez-Buylla Roces (born July 11, 1959) is a Mexican professor of molecular genetics at National Autonomous University of Mexico and the director of the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda. She was awarded the National Prize of Sciences and Arts of Mexico in 2017. == Early life and education == \u00c1lvarez-Buylla was born into a family of scientists in Mexico City in 1959. Her father Ram\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez-Buylla was a neurophysiologist and founder of the Department of Physiology at CINVESTAV. Her mother, Elena Roces Dorronsoro, is a biologist and researcher at the University of Colima. Her grandparents worked in aviation and her uncle is the economist Jos\u00e9 Carlos Roces Dorronsoro. Her brother, Arturo \u00c1lvarez-Buylla, is a neurobiologist. She attended the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where she studied biology and graduated in 1983. Her undergraduate dissertation involved ethnobotany, and was acknowledged by the Botanical Society of Mexico. She was awarded the Gabino Barreda medal for her educational performance. She remained at the National Autonomous University of Mexico for her Master's degree, where she investigated Cecropia from Los Tuxtlas. In 1986 \u00c1lvarez-Buylla moved to the University of California, Berkeley for her doctoral studies, where she worked with Montgomery Slatkin on rainforests. After earning her PhD \u00c1lvarez- Buylla was appointed a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Diego, where she worked in La Jolla on molecular genetics. == Research and career == She has investigated how genetic information is mapped onto a phenotype. She joined the Institute of Ecology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 1992. Here she leads the Laboratory of Genetics, Epigenetics, Development and Evolution of Plants. Her work is centred in developmental ecology, and she has looked to understand the mechanisms of cell differentiation and morphogenesis. She has focussed on the balance between proliferation and cell differentiation in the Arabidopsis thaliana. She has investigated the hormonal pathways in plants, as well as studying how they respond to different environments. \u00c1lvarez-Buylla has worked in both experimental and theoretical science, developing models that can predict phenotypic patterns, and monitor the role of the environment in complex feedback networks. She provided the framework for understanding of MADS-box genes, which act as regulators of plant and animal development. Following on from her early career studying rainforests, \u00c1lvarez-Buylla has continued to research biodiversity in Mexico. She has created demographic- genetic mathematical models to help with forest regeneration and predict the effects of harvest and species extinction. The models developed by \u00c1lvarez- Buylla are used in conservation and forest management worldwide. Her research has identified over 20 new scientific species. She has monitored the biosecurity of Lacandonia schismatica, a crop of immense importance to Mexican communities, as well as various pine populations. === Advocacy and academic service === \u00c1lvarez-Buylla is a member of the Mexican delegation for the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs. She founded the Mexico Union of Scientists Committed to Society, and has called for more research to be done into the impact of genetically modified crops. In 2018 \u00c1lvarez-Buylla became the first woman to be appointed the Director of the Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda (CONACYT). In this capacity, she is the primary scientific advisor to Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the President of Mexico, and in charge of the $1.5 billion budget. In 2019 she announced that the humanities were to become included into the council, and it would be renamed CONAHCYT. === Awards and honours === Her awards and honours include; * 1994 American Society of Naturalists Jasper Loftus-Hills Young Investigators Award * 1999 Mexican Academy of Sciences National Research Award * 2008 Mexico City Heberto Castillo Prize * 2010 National Autonomous University of Mexico National University Award * 2011 National Autonomous University of Mexico Faustino Miranda Medal * 2016 Elected to the Board of Directors of National Autonomous University of Mexico * 2016 Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de San Luis Potos\u00ed National Prize for Scientific-Technological Research * 2017 National Prize of Sciences and Arts === Selected publications === Her publications include; * * * * == References == Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:National Autonomous University of Mexico faculty ",
