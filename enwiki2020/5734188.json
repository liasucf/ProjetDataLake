    "text": "Central Crossing High School is a high school in Grove City, Ohio. It is one of four high schools in the South-Western City Schools district, the others being Franklin Heights High School, Grove City High School, and Westland High School. Central Crossing is the most recent high school to be built in the district. It first opened its doors for the 2002-03 academic year. The mascot for Central Crossing is the Comet, and its official colors are royal blue and silver. The school's motto is \"Excelling in Excellence\". == History == The history of Central Crossing High School began with the passage of Issue 7 on November 3, 1998. A $128,000,000 bond issue, Issue 7 included the building of four new fifth/sixth grade buildings, one new high school, a replacement building for Park Street Middle School, a replacement building for the Hayes Technical School, additions, renovations, demolition of various district facilities, and acquiring land for school facilities. The issue passed with 17,003 votes in favor of the bond issue and 14,914 against the bond issue. The groundbreaking for Central Crossing High School took place in 2000. The school officially opened its doors on August 28, 2002. Home to no seniors in its inaugural year, the school housed only 1,005 students. However, enrollment jumped to 1,415 the following school year after welcoming another freshman class. === 2009 levy failure === Due to a lack of funding stemming from the repeated failure to pass a proposed local tax levy, all extracurricular activities offered to the student body by the South-Western City Schools district were on hiatus. As of October 12, 2009 the district Board of Education approved a measure that allows for \"Pay to Play\" participation, where activities are open to enrollment by students that contribute directly to its funding, given that the appealed tax levy will eventually be approved by voters.\"Athletic and Club Pay-to-Participate Information For Parents and Students - Winter Clubs and Sports 2009-2010\" == Demographics == {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em;\" width=\"250px\" ! colspan=\"2\" !bgcolor=999999| CCHS Student Enrollment |- | Year || Enrollment |- | colspan=\"2\" | * * * |- | '02-03 || 1,005 |- | '03-04 || 1,415 |- | '04-05 || 1,547 |- | '05-06 || 1,635 |- | '06-07 || 1,582 |- | '07-08 || 1,683 |- | '08-09 || 1,636 |- | '09-10 || 1,593 |- | '10-11 || 1,652 |- | '11-12 || 1,618 |- | '12-13 || 1,593 |- | '13-14 || 1,655 |- | '14-15 || 1,634 |} As of the 2014-2015 school year, there were 1,634 students attending the school according to the Ohio Department of Education.

It lost in the first round both seasons, falling to league-rival Hilliard Davidson 17-9 in 2015 and Cincinnati St. Xavier 50-13 in 2014. ==== Results by year ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |- style=\"background:#DDDDDD; text-align:center\" !| Year || Overall || Conference || Standing|| Playoff || Head Coach|| Westland || Grove City |- |2002 |0-10 |0-7 OCC-Ohio |8th |None |Ted Papas |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |- |2003 |3-7 |2-5 OCC-Ohio |T-5th |None |Ted Papas |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |- |2004 |2-8 |1-4 OCC-Central |5th |None |Ted Papas |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |- |2005 |2-8 |2-5 OCC-Central |4th |None |Ted Papas |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |- |2006 |2-8 |1-4 OCC-Central |T-5th |None |Ted Papas |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |- |2007 |1-9 |0-5 OCC-Central |6th |None |Rick Vaughn |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |- |2008 |1-9 |1-6 OCC-Central |7th |None |Rick Vaughn |style=\"color:blue; text-align:center\" | Win |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |- |2010 |2-8 |1-6 OCC-Central |7th |None |Chris Harr |style=\"color:blue; text-align:center\" | Win |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |- |2011 |1-9 |1-6 OCC-Central |7th |None |Chris Harr |style=\"color:blue; text-align:center\" | Win |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |- |2012 |2-8 |1-6 OCC-Central |7th |None |Chris Harr |style=\"color:blue; text-align:center\" | Win |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |- |2013 |2-8 |1-6 OCC-Central |7th |None |Chris Harr |style=\"color:blue; text-align:center\" | Win |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |- |2014 |7-4 |5-2 OCC-Central |3rd |L vs. Cincinnati St. Xavier 13-50 |Chris Harr |style=\"color:blue; text- align:center\" | Win |style=\"color:black; text-align:center\" | DNP |- |2015 |7-4 |5-2 OCC-Central |2nd |L vs. Hilliard Davidson 9-17 |Chris Harr |style=\"color:blue; text-align:center\" | Win |style=\"color:black; text- align:center\" | DNP |- |2016 |2-8 |1-4 OCC-Central |5th |None |Chris Harr |style=\"color:blue; text-align:center\" | Win |style=\"color:blue; text- align:center\" | Win |- |2017 |3-7 |1-4 OCC-Central |5th |None |Trevor White |style=\"color:blue; text-align:center\" | Win |style=\"color:blue; text- align:center\" | Win |- |2018 |4-6 |1-4 OCC-Central |5th |None |Trevor White |style=\"color:blue; text-align:center\" | Win |style=\"color:blue; text- align:center\" | Win |- |2019 |2-5 |0-2 OCC-Central |6th |None |Trevor White |style=\"color:blue; text-align:center\" | Win |style=\"color:red; text- align:center\" | Loss |- |Total |43-126 |24-78 |N/A |2 (2014, 2015) |N/A |style=\"color:blue; text-align:center\" | 10-0 |style=\"color:blue; text- align:center\" | 3-1 |- | colspan=\"2\" |Notes |colspan = \"6\"|2009 season canceled by the BOE due to levy failure |- |} === Boys' basketball === The boys basketball team is currently coached by Neil Hohman. Coach Hohman played basketball for Otterbein College from 2001-2005. He is currently an intervention Specialist at Central Crossing High School. Hohman had previously coached the girls varsity program 2010-2014. Coach Hohman was selected as the Division I Co-Coach of the Year and the Central District Coach of the Year for the 2011-2012 season where he led his Varsity team to an 18-4 record. Comets alumni to go on to play college basketball include 2015 graduate Andrew Russell, who played four years at Division III Wilmington. The Comets have never won a Central District tournament game. The top source of Central Ohio basketball, 270hoops.com, was founded by two Central Crossing alumni. Zach Fleer (2011) and Jason Morrow (2010) founded the website in November 2015, which focuses on covering Central Ohio high school basketball and has grown to dominate the area in the years since. === Softball === === Rivalries === The Central Crossing athletic teams currently have an intense geographic rivalry with intra-district Westland High School. The two schools are separated by only 4.1 miles and have competed against one another regularly in every sport since both teams became members of the Ohio Capital Conference Central Division in the fall of 2008. The Comets also hold grudges with their cross- town neighbor Grove City High School. The Comets had their first football meeting with Grove City, beating the Dawgs 28-21 led by Sophomore quarterback Kameron Peck in his first start as a varsity athlete. It's always a heated match between the Comets and the Dawgs no matter which sport they meet in. At the beginning of the 2019 season, Central Crossing is undefeated all-time in football games against Westland and Grove City. ===Ohio Capital Conference championships=== * Girls Cross Country - 2004 * Girls Track - 2005 * Wrestling - 2006, 2008, 2009 * Girls Softball - 2011, 2012, 2017 ==References== ==External links== * Central Crossing Main Website * Central Crossing Band Website * Central Crossing Athletics Homepage * Comet Wrestling Website * Central Crossing Choirs Website * Central Crossing Theatre Website Category:High schools in Franklin County, Ohio Category:Public high schools in Ohio ",
