His father was in the service of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) from 1679 until his death in 1714, during which time he authored several standards texts of navigation. Thus Isaak grew up with a good grounding in with the principles of navigation and cartography. In 1691, he received a commission to produce ah Atlas of Africa and Asia for the VOC,which could then be used by their governing council when considering policy. After this was completed in 1705, he was appointed official cartographer for the VOC until his death in 1743. Isaac de Graaf married Sanderina de Brauw in Utrecht in 1708. They set up home on the Brouwersgracht in Amsterdam. ==de Graaf map discovered== In 2015 following the discovery of the wreck of the Diemermeer , further research revealed that one of de Graaf's maps was found in the National Library of Australia. This map was the original ship\u2019s navigational map, an example of a navigational aid of which very few survive. The map was drawn by de Graaf in 1735, shortly before the ship was built. The last voyage of the ship is recorded on the map. ==References== Category:1668 births Category:1743 deaths Category:17th-century Dutch cartographers Category:18th-century Dutch people Category:Dutch cartographers Category:People from Amsterdam ",
