The trains, with 4 carriages each, are manufactured by Shanghai Electric and Alstom. Like the Lexington Avenue Subway in New York City, passenger traffic has consistently exceeded the designed capacity of the line since its opening and causes severe strain to the services. The line was built to accommodate light metro narrow-bodied \"C size\" trains, which is not interchangeable with wide-body \"A size\" trains on other Shanghai Metro lines. This difference in loading gauge has made it impractical to upgrade the line to higher capacity \"A size\" trains to relieve demand. Line 6 was forecasted to carry 105,000 people/day. However within the first few days of operation the line has exceeded 150,000 people/day. Realizing the sheer miscalculation during construction, the municipal government have pledged to add new trains and shorten wait times starting in June 2008. However, Line 6 still suffers severe crowding and delays especially during rush hours. The busiest section of the line is running at 133% capacity. With the opening of Line 12 the Shanghai Metro advises passengers divert to the new line to relieve crowding. ==Interchanges== *Century Avenue is an interchange among Lines 2, 4, 6 and 9. *Lancun Road is an interchange between Lines 4 and 6. *West Gaoke Road is an interchange between Lines 6 and 7. *Oriental Sports Center, the final station of Line 6, opened in April 2011. It is an interchange among Lines 6, 8 and 11. *Jufeng Road is an interchange between Lines 6 and 12. *Dongming Road is an interchange between Lines 6 and 13. *Gangcheng Road, the other terminal station of Line 6, will be an interchange between Lines 6 and 10. *Yunshan Road will be an interchange between Lines 6 and 14. ==Rolling Stock== {|border=0 style=\"border:1px solid #999;background- color:white;text-align:left;font-size:90%\" |-align=center bgcolor=#cccccc !Type!!Time of manufacturing!!Series!!Sets!!Assembly!!Notes |- |Type C||2007\u20132008||06C01||21||Tc+Mp+Mp+Tc||Manufactured by Alstom |-bgcolor=#EFEFEF |Type C||2009\u20132010||06C02||11||Tc+Mp+Mp+Tc||Manufactured by CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles |- |Type C||2011\u20132012||06C03||18||Tc+Mp+Mp+Tc||Manufactured by CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles |-bgcolor=#EFEFEF |Type C||2018\u20132020||06C04||26||Tc+Mp+Mp+Tc||Manufactured by CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles |} File:ShMetro Line 6 AC12 AC14.JPG|06C01 train on the left and 06C02 train on the right == References == Category:Shanghai Metro lines Category:Line 6, Shanghai Metro Category:Railway lines opened in 2007 Category:2007 establishments in China ",
