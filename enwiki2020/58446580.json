He served between 2000 and 2005. == Regent == During his tenure, he initiated a tourism project in which the government created a replica of a Majapahit-era explorer ship, meant to undergo an expedition to promote the regency. However, the ship sank. Under his term, the construction of Blimbingsari Airport was initiated. == Corruption case == In 2007, he was arrested and convicted of corruption regarding the construction of Blimbingsari Airport, a floating dock, and the purchase of LCTs operating in the Bali Strait. He was sentenced to six years in prison in 2008 for the LCT case. Due to his old age, he was not transferred to the usual prison for corruption, but was held at Banyuwangi instead. He was convicted once more in 2010 for the airport case, adding an additional 6 years to his sentence. == Death == During his time in prison, he fell down in a bathroom. Samsul passed away two days later on 15 September 2014, 01.30 WIB following a hospital treatment. He was survived by his wife and three children. Initially meant to be buried in a public cemetery, he was instead buried in a burial complex for Banyuwangi's Regents. == References == {| class=\"wikitable succession-box\" style=\"margin: 0.5em auto 12px; font-size: 95%; clear: both;\" ! colspan=\"3\" id=\"97\" style=\"border-top: 5px solid #ccccff;\" |Political offices |- id=\"100\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | align=\"center\" id=\"101\" rowspan=\"1\" width=\"30%\" |Preceded by: Turyono Purnomo Sidik | id=\"104\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"40%\" |Regent of Banyuwangi 2000\u20132005 | align=\"center\" id=\"107\" rowspan=\"1\" width=\"30%\" |Succeeded by: Ratna Ani Lestari |} Category:1959 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Javanese people Category:People from Banyuwangi Regency Category:Indonesian politicians convicted of corruption Category:Regents of Banyuwangi ",
