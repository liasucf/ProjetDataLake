    "text": "Central () is an MTR station located in the Central area of Hong Kong Island. The station's livery is firebrick red but brown on the Tsuen Wan Line platforms. The station is the southern terminus of the Tsuen Wan Line, a stop on the Island Line, and connects to Hong Kong Station, which serves the Tung Chung Line and the Airport Express. The station was originally named Chater Station. It was initially conceived to cater for 330,000 passengers daily and was planned to be long \u2013 one of the longest stations in the world. More than 200,000 passengers use this station daily. The longest distance between two exits is approximately 700m. ==History== ===Early plans=== Central station was included in the Hong Kong Mass Transport Study, a system proposed in September 1967.Freeman, Fox, Wilbur Smith & Associates (1967), Hong Kong Mass Transport Study. Together with Western Market station, it was to serve as an interchange station of the Kwun Tong Line and Island Line. In the recommended system, the Tsuen Wan Line would end at Admiralty. The station was originally planned to be located under Des Voeux Road Central between Jubilee Street and Pedder Street. In 1970, in the Hong Kong Mass Transit Further Studies, the station was proposed as two separate but connected stations: Chater Station () under Chater Road and Pedder Station () under Pedder Street), which would serve the Kong Kow Line (now Tsuen Wan Line) and Island Line respectively. ===Modified Initial System and opening=== The station first opened as Chater Station on 12 February 1980 as the terminus of the Modified Initial System (MIS, now Kwun Tong Line). Only a portion of the station came into operation as the Island Line had not been opened yet. The station was named Chater in English but \u4e2d\u74b0 (Central) in Chinese. This would be misleading as many thought that the Chinese name would be \u906e\u6253, a transliteration. When the Island Line between Admiralty and Chai Wan opened on 31 May 1985, MTR renamed Chater to Central together with the renaming of some other stations on the Tsuen Wan line. Construction for the Island Line was carried out in early 1983 and connected the new platforms with the original structure. The Island Line began servicing Central on 23 May 1986 when it was extended beyond Admiralty to Sheung Wan and the Island Line platforms came into service. ===Passageway to Hong Kong Station=== One component of the Airport Core Programmewww.info.gov.hk/napco/index-e.html between 1991 and 1998 was a railway connecting the new Hong Kong International Airport to the city centre. To link Central with the nearby Hong Kong Station, the southern terminus of the Tung Chung Line and the Airport Express, a passageway was built under Connaught Road to connect the two stations. The passageway starts at the Pedder Street concourse and was refurbished with a design similar to that of Hong Kong Station. ==Station layout== Central Station has four platforms on three levels. The top level includes platform 3 and is built beneath Des Voeux Road Central at the intersection of Pedder Street, stretching from World-Wide House to Alexandra House, on the northern side of the road. The platform serves Chai Wan-bound trains on the Island Line and this level includes the connecting walkway to Hong Kong Station. The middle level includes platforms 1 and 2 using a shared island. They serve the Tsuen Wan Line and were built directly under Chater Road, extending from Des Voeux Road Central to Club Street. The bottom level, two levels from the top level, is platform 4, for Island Line trains in the direction of Kennedy Town. Passengers from platform 3 transferring to platforms 1 or 2 use the regular escalators on the Chater Road concourse. There are designated escalators from platforms 1 and 2 to platform 4 for the sole purpose of transfer. The Tsuen Wan Line platforms are straight and were built by cut-and-cover. Most of the length of the Island Line platforms is the same, although the eastern part (towards Admiralty Station) is curved and the gap is large, as they are located in sections of bored tunnels and have the curved walls typical of most other stations on the Island Line. {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- style=\"vertical- align:top;\" | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;width:50px;\" |G | style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:100px;\" |Street level | style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;width:380px;\" |Exits |- | style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" |P | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Chater Road concourse | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |\u2013 |- | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" rowspan=\"2\" |L1 | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" |Pedder Street concourse | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Customer Service, MTRShops Hang Seng Bank, vending machines Octopus promotion machine |- | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical- align:top;\" |Chater Road concourse | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Customer Service, MTRShops ATM |- | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" rowspan=\"4\" |L2 | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" |Chater Road concourse | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Customer Service, MTRShops Hang Seng Bank, vending machines |- | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" |Pedder Street concourse | style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Customer Service, MTRShops Subway to Hong Kong Station for & Octopus promotion machine, i-centre internet service |- | style=\"border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |Side platform, doors will open on the left |- | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Platform 3 | style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" | towards Chai Wan (Admiralty) \u2192 |- | style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" rowspan=\"3\" |L3 |Platform 1 | towards Tsuen Wan (Admiralty) \u2192 |- | style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |Island platform, doors will open on the left or right |- | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Platform 2 | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" | towards Tsuen Wan (Admiralty) \u2192 |- | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;vertical-align:top;\" rowspan=\"2\" |L4 | style=\"border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border- bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" |Side platform, doors will open on the right |- | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |Platform 4 | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" |\u2190 towards Kennedy Town (Sheung Wan) |} ==Entrances and Exits== Central Station stretches underneath Chater Road from Statue Square in the east and underneath Des Voeux Road to Li Yuen Street East in the west.
