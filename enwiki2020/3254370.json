    "text": "Llandudno railway station serves the seaside town of Llandudno in North Wales, and is the terminus of a long branch line from on the Crewe to Holyhead North Wales Coast Line. The station is managed by Transport for Wales, who operate all trains serving it. Llandudno Victoria station, the lower terminus of the Great Orme Tramway, is a 15-minute walk from the main station. ==History== London Midland & Scottish Railway monogram Llandudno railway station pictured in 1894 The first station and the branch line was constructed by the St. George's Harbour and Railway Company and opened on 1 October 1858. The trains at first ran to and from Conwy station until the completion of Llandudno Junction station. The line was soon absorbed by the London and North Western Railway, which in turn became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Vaughan Street in Llandudno was also laid out in 1858 as the station approach road. As the first station had become inadequate to cope with increasing usage, the present Llandudno station buildings and frontage together with five platforms and an extensive glass roof were erected in 1892 and the station still has the Victorian carriage road between the two principal platforms. Platforms 4 & 5 had been disused since 1978 with the tracks to the platforms being disconnected and eventually dismantled in 2012. The southernmost half of the glass roof was removed some decades ago, and the remainder was substantially cut back again in 1990. Half of the station frontage (including the former waiting and refreshment rooms) that had been disused for years was demolished in May 2009. The station retains its semaphore signalling and manual signal box. ==Facilities== Signal Box In recent years, plans were unveiled for the transformation of the station into a Transport Interchange, which would involve the demolition of the disused part of the frontage and the introduction of new passenger facilities. Following the provision of funding, reconstruction began in 2013 and the \u00a35.2 million scheme was completed in the summer of 2014.\"Llandudno's new \u00a35.2m railway station\"North Wales Daily Post article 23 July 2014; Retrieved 13 January 2017 The work included a 130 space car park (on the site of the former Platforms 4 & 5), a glazed concourse, a bus interchange, new taxi rank, and a shop/cafe. There are also a new entrance and improvements to the platforms. The ticket office is staffed on a part-time basis. A self-service ticket machine is also provided for use and for collecting advance purchase tickets. There are also toilets and a waiting room on the concourse. Train running information is provided by digital information screens, posters and automated announcements.
