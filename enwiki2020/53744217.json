The three saints are noted as opponents of Arianism who fled from Africa to Sicily to escape persecution. They were active in the area of Fragalata, near Messina. Calogerus is commemorated on the same day in the Catholic Church. Calogerus is also held to have worked as a missionary on Lipari in the Aeolian Islands, before retiring to live as a hermit on Monte Kronio, which is now sometimes called in () in his honor, as is another mountain near Palermo. Saint Calogerus is venerated at Agrigento more than Saint Gerland, who is the patron of Agrigento. Other centres in which Saint Calogero is particularly venerated are Porto Empedocle, Naro, Sciacca, Frazzan\u00f3, San Salvatore di Fitalia, Cesar\u00f3, Petralia Sottana and Campofranco. In iconography, he is usually identifiable as a bearded hermit with olive complexion wearing eastern (Syriac) hooded vestments. ==References== Category:Sicilian saints Category:Saints of medieval Greece Category:5th-century Christian saints Category:Monks ",
