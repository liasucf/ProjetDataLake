    "text": "In mathematics, the Property P conjecture is a statement about 3-manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere. A knot in the 3-sphere is said to have Property P if every 3-manifold obtained by performing (non- trivial) Dehn surgery on the knot is not simply-connected. The conjecture states that all knots, except the unknot, have Property P. Research on Property P was started by R. H. Bing, who popularized the name and conjecture. This conjecture can be thought of as a first step to resolving the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, since the Lickorish\u2013Wallace theorem says any closed, orientable 3-manifold results from Dehn surgery on a link. If a knot K \\subset \\mathbb{S}^{3} has Property P, then one cannot construct a counterexample to the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture by surgery along K. A proof was announced in 2004, as the combined result of efforts of mathematicians working in several different fields. ==Algebraic Formulation== Let [l], [m] \\in \\pi_{1}(\\mathbb{S}^{3} \\setminus K) denote elements corresponding to a preferred longitude and meridian of a tubular neighborhood of K. K has Property P if and only if its Knot group is never trivialised by adjoining a relation of the form m = l^{a} for some 0 e a \\in \\mathbb{Z}. ==See also== * Property R conjecture ==References== * * * * * * Category:3-manifolds Category:Conjectures ",
