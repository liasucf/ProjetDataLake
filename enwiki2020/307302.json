    "text": "Map of Killarney Killarney (; ; ) is a town in County Kerry, southwestern Ireland. The town is on the northeastern shore of Lough Leane, part of Killarney National Park, and is home to St Mary's Cathedral, Ross Castle, Muckross House and Abbey, the Lakes of Killarney, MacGillycuddy's Reeks, Purple Mountain, Mangerton Mountain, Paps Mountain, the Gap of Dunloe and Torc Waterfall. Its natural heritage, history and location on the Ring of Kerry make Killarney a popular tourist destination. Killarney won the Best Kept Town award in 2007, in a cross-border competition jointly organised by the Department of the Environment and the Northern Ireland Amenity Council. In 2011, it was named Ireland's tidiest town and the cleanest town in the country by Irish Business Against Litter. ==History== Killarney has featured prominently in early Irish history, with religious settlements playing an important part of its recorded history. Its first significantly historical settlement was the monastery on nearby Innisfallen Island founded in 640 by St. Finian the Leper, which was occupied for approximately 850 years. Innisfallen or Inishfallen (from Irish: Inis Faithlinn, meaning \"Faithlinn's island\")[1] is an island in Lough Leane; one of the three Lakes of Killarney in County Kerry, Ireland. It is home to the ruins of Innisfallen Abbey, one of the most impressive archaeological remains dating from the early Christian period found in the Killarney National Park. The monastery was founded in 640 by St. Finian the Leper, and was occupied for approximately 850 years. Over a period of about 300 of these, the monks wrote the Annals of Innisfallen, which chronicle the early history of Ireland as it was known to the monks. The monks were dispossessed of the abbey on 18 August 1594, by Elizabeth I, Queen of England. The location of the monastery on the island is thought to have given rise to the name Lough Leane (Irish Loch L\u00e9in), which in English means \"Lake of Learning\". According to tradition the Irish High King Brian Boru received his education at Innisfallen under Maelsuthain O'Carroll.[2] Maelsuthain has been credited as the possible originator of the Annals.[3] It is possible for tourists to visit the island during the summer months, with boats leaving from Ross Castle throughout the day. Aghadoe, the local townland which overlooks present day Killarney, may have begun as a pagan religious site.Long, Tom. \"Tracing Our Faith.\" Fossa & Aghadoe: Our Heritage and History. ed. Jim Larner. Fossa Historical Society. 2007. . p 1. The site has also been associated with the 5th century missionary St. Abban, but 7th century ogham stones mark the first clear evidence of Aghadoe being used as an important site.Long, 1. According to legend, St. Finian founded a monastery at Aghadoe in the 6th or 7th century. The first written record of a monastery dates from 939 AD in the Annals of Innisfallen where the Aghadoe monastery is referred to as the \"Old Abbey.\" Following the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, the Normans built Parkavonear Castle, also at Aghadoe. The castle was perhaps intended as an early warning outpost due to its views of the entire Killarney valley and lakes region. Ross Castle was built on the lake shore in the late 15th century by local ruling clan the O'Donoghues Mor (Ross). Ownership of the castle changed hands during the Desmond Rebellions of the 1580s to the Mac Carty Mor. Muckross Abbey was founded in 1448 as a Franciscan friary for the Observantine Franciscans by Donal McCarthy Mor. The abbey was burned down by Cromwellian forces under General Ludlow in 1654, and today remains a ruin. Killarney was heavily involved in the Irish War of Independence. The town, and indeed the entire county, had strong republican ties, and skirmishes with the British forces happened on a regular basis. The Great Southern Hotel was for a while taken over by the British, both as an office and barracks, and to protect the neighbouring railway station. One notable event during the war was the Headford Ambush when the IRA attacked a railway train a few miles from town. However, divisions among former colleagues were quick to develop following the truce and treaty, and Killarney, like many other areas, suffered in the rash of increasing atrocities during the Civil War. A day after the Ballyseedy Massacre, five Republican prisoners were murdered in Killarney by Free State forces. == History of tourism == Plaque commemorating the coming of the Railway to Killarney Killarney's tourism history goes back at least to the mid 18th century, when Thomas, fourth Viscount Kenmare (Lord Kenmare), began to attract visitors and new residents to the town. The date of 1747 was used in recent 250-year celebrations to honour the history of Killarney tourism. A visit by Queen Victoria in 1861 gave the town some international exposure. Killarney benefited greatly from the coming of the railway in July 1853. British trade directory publisher Isaac Slater noted that there were three hotels in the town in 1846Slater, Isaac. Slater's Directory. 1846. but by 1854, one year after the coming of the railway, James Fraser named seven hotels and described their locations: > the Railway Hotel opposite the Railway Station; the Kenmare Arms and > Hibernia which are on the main street and immediately opposite the church... > the Victoria which is about a mile to the west of the town on the shores of > the Lower Lake; the Lake View which is about the same distance to the east > of the town and also on the shore of the Lower Lake; the Muckross about two > and a half miles away and near the Muckross Lake and the Torc which occupies > an elevated site about a mile and a half from the town on the hill which > rises immediately over the Lake Hotel.Fraser, James. Guide to Killarney. > 1854 In 1858, Irish born Victorian journalist, Samuel Carter Hall named O'Sullivan's Hotel and the Innisfallen rather than the Hibernia and Torc, but Isaac Slater also named the Hibernia in 1846. At the time he was writing, tours of the Ring of Kerry were already an industry and Killarney was considered the starting point of the hundred and ten mile circuitous route. He was fascinated by the horses' endurance on the two-day trip, and leaves clear advice for other travellers; > It is a common and wise custom of those who make this tour, and are not > pressed for time, to hire the carriage at the hotel in Killarney and > continue with it 'all the way round.' It is absolutely marvellous what these > mountain bred horses can get through \"thinking nothing\" of thirty miles for > days together or even fifty miles in a single day.Hall, Carter. A Week in > Killarney. 1858 As part of the trip, he noted that there were hotels in Glenbeigh and Waterville along with a \"comfortable inn\", which is now The Butler Arms Hotel. ==Transport== ===Road=== Killarney is served by National Primary Route N22 (north to Tralee and Castleisland and east to Cork); the National Secondary Routes N72 (west to Killorglin) and the N71 (south to Bantry). ===Rail=== Killarney railway station (operated by Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann) has direct services to Tralee, Cork and Dublin, with connections to the rest of the rail network. ===Bus=== Bus \u00c9ireann provides bus services to Limerick (and onwards to Dublin), Tralee, Cork, Kenmare and Skibbereen. ===Air=== Kerry Airport (17 km), in Farranfore between Tralee and Killarney, provides a number of air services with connecting trains running from Farranfore railway station to Killarney railway station.
