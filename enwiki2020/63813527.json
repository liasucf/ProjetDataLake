    "text": "The vice governor of Jakarta is an elected politician who, along with the governor and 106 members of Regional People's Representative Council (DPRD), is accountable for the strategic government of Jakarta. Jakarta is administratively equal to a province with special status as the capital of Indonesia. Hence, the executive head of Jakarta is a governor, instead of a mayor. == List of vice governors == === 1960\u20131964 === The first vice governor, Henk Ngantung, was inaugurated alongside with his Governor, Soemarno Sosroatmodjo.
