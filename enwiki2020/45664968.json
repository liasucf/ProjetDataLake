It is found in the Cocos Islands, Moluccas, Lesser Sunda Islands, New Guinea, New Caledonia, Australia and the western Pacific. Since 2005, Tramea loewii has also been recorded in New Zealand. ==Description== Tramea loewii is a medium to large dragonfly (wingspan 85 mm, length 45 mm). Its synthorax is striped yellowish to brown on a purplish background. Males have a red abdomen, and the last two segments have black markings. Females are a dull brown colour. Dark patches at the base of their hindwings are a characteristic feature of this species; males have red patches and females have brown. Tramea loewii is very similar to Tramea stenoloba which has a darker synthorax, and larger genital dimensions. ==Habitat== Tramea loewii inhabits a wide range of still waters, ponds and swamps, and may breed many times in a year. In Australia it is widespread except for the far south-west of the continent. ==Gallery== Common Glider Dragonfly. Tramea loewii (Trapezostigma loewii).
