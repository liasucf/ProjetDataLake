    "text": "The Reitwallstra\u00dfe is a street in Hanover, Germany, near the pedestrianised Am Steintor. It is part of the red-light district, which is bounded by Reuterstra\u00dfe, Goethestra\u00dfe, Reitwallstra\u00dfe and Am Marstall and is crossed by Scholvinstra\u00dfe. The street is known for prostitution and strip clubs. ==History== The name of the street derives from the riding facilities it contained and the proximity to the city wall. On an 1834 map it is shown as the \"riding by Hanover's walls of fortification\" and ran from Steintor towards the Leine (A tributary of the river Aller). There was a riding school, a riding arena and stables, which belonged to the court stables of the Leineschloss. Around the middle of the 19th century, the street was renamed Schillerstra\u00dfe (later renamed Am Marstall), and the name Reitwallstra\u00dfe given to the side street that currently bears the name. No. 15 Reitwallstra\u00dfe was the location of the printing and publishing house called Berenbergsche Buchdruckerei, which published, amongst others, the 1846 court and state handbook for the Kingdom of Hanover. ==Modern times== The street now extends between Goethestra\u00dfe and Am Marstall. The situation in Reitwallstra\u00dfe is rated by the police as \"delicate\". 300 crimes occurred in this area alone between early 2009 and 2010. Reitwallstrasse is considered a retreat for drug dealers and thugs. The road was declared a \"dangerous place\" for the purposes of the Lower Saxony law on public order and safety. The entertainment area of the red light district with brothels, strip clubs, clubs, bars and tattoo shops was under the control of the Hells Angels for many years. The \"King\" of the area was Frank Hanebuth up until 2011. Hanebuth was the leader of the Bones outlaw motorcycle club, which in 1999 amalgamated with the Hells Angels. In 2010, the Hells Angels met with rivals, the Bandidos, in the restaurant Little Italy and under lawyer G\u00f6tz von Fromberg agreed a \"peace treaty\". The Hanover Hells Angels were dissolved in 2012 and the following year the Black Jackets attempted to control the district. The Reitwallstra\u00dfe has declined as a red- light district in recent years. A plan for a new 167 room hotel on the street was proposed in 2019 and also im 2019 the laufhaus Sexworld was closed and converted into 20 apartments. ==See also== * Prostitution in Germany ==References== Category:Hanover Category:Streets in Germany Category:Red-light districts in Germany ",
