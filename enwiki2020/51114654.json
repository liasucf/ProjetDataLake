They may alternatively be known as mass timber buildings. ==Materials== The use of cross-laminated timber (CLT), a type of mass timber, gives high fire resistance, because when exposed to fire, CLT forms a surface char layer, which protects its interior from fire damage. As they are made of wood, they lock up carbon during construction, and are sustainable if the timber they are made from is replanted. Plyscrapers, may, besides using wood (often cross- laminated timber), also use concrete. These plyscrapers are called \"hybrids\".The rise of skyscrapers made of wood Concrete may, for example, be used for making the columns. As an alternative to concrete columns, \"glulam\" is sometimes also used. With this type of laminated wood, the boards are not glued cross-wise, but rather glued while pointing the same direction.Kijk magazine, 12, 2019 ==Tallest plyscrapers== Until 2017, the tallest habitable building made of timber was the Brock Commons on the campus of the University of British Columbia near Vancouver, Canada. In 2019 the Mj\u00f6sa Tower in Brumunddal, Norway, was completed, taking over the title with its 85.4 metres (280 ft). Several proposals for taller timber buildings have been made, including a tower in Tokyo. Although quite high buildings can be made using cross-laminated timber, and/or other materials, building high with current techniques does have its drawbacks. For example, walls and columns get so thick then that the size of the usable interior space gets heavily reduced. This issue does not occur with shorter buildings.Kijk magazine, 12, 2019 ==See also== * Skyscraper design and construction ==References== ==External links== *Wood Skyscrapers, Home to Tall Wood Architecture *2016: The year in wood construction TreeHugger, 2016 Category:Wooden architecture ",
