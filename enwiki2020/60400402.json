Freddie Redd Leader Entry accessed April 3, 2019 == Reception == Allmusic states, \"Due to his timeless style and relatively few recordings, Freddie Redd is a legend. A fine bop pianist who was an associate of his idols Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, Redd (62 at the time of this set) will probably always be best-known for his work on the play The Connection. Although maintaining a low profile, Redd had been playing continuously through the decades ... Redd is an unrecognized giant. Bassist Al McKibbon and drummer Billy Higgins offer short solos and sympathetic support on this highly recommended trio set\". == Track listing == All compositions by Freddie Redd except where noted # \"I'm Gonna Be Happy\" \u2013 7:09 # \"I'll Remember April\" (Gene de Paul, Patricia Johnston, Don Raye) \u2013 8:09 # \"I'll Keep Loving You\" (Bud Powell) \u2013 4:37 # \"Don't Lose the Blues\" \u2013 5:53 # \"'Round Midnight\" (Thelonious Monk, Cootie Williams, Bernie Hanighen) \u2013 6:28 # \"Waltzin' In\" \u2013 6:53 # \"For Heaven's Sake\" (Elise Bretton, Sherman Edwards, Donald Meyer) \u2013 4:10 # \"All the Things You Are\" (Jerome Kern, Oscar Hammerstein II) \u2013 9:24 == Personnel == *Freddie Redd \u2013 piano *Al McKibbon \u2013 bass *Billy Higgins \u2013 drums == References == Category:Freddie Redd albums Category:1990 live albums ",
