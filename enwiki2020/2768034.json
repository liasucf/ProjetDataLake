In September 1990, they opened a recording studio and created Avex Trax as a music label. In the same year, they created \"Musique Folio Inc.\", a music publishing company, which became \"Prime Direction Inc.\" During their early years, Avex operated as an indies label, but had an especially close relationship with the Sanwa keiretsu; 2.8% of shares of Avex were held by Sanwa Bank, in turn 1.15% of shares of Sanwa Bank were held by Hitachi. In 1993, they transferred to Aoyama, Tokyo and created a U.S. branch, called \"AV Experience America Inc.\" The year also marked the first of Avex's yearly events. It was held in Tokyo Dome under the name \"avex rave '93\" and attracted 50,000 attendees. This led to the creation of the Cutting Edge label. In 1994, they formed two UK subsidiaries, \"Rhythm Republic Limited\" and \"Avex U.K. Limited.\" Later that year, they opened a disco, claimed on their website to be \"the world's largest scale disco\", named Velfarre. In 1997, they opened a series of concert halls called \"Zepp\" with Sony Music Entertainment Japan. In early 1999, they signed an agreement with Walt Disney Records and Hollywood Records to handle the companies' Japanese CD releases.

Tom Yoda==== In August 2004, a feud between Max Matsuura and co-founder Tom Yoda affected the group. It started because of Yoda's ambition to expand Avex into other entertainment- related ventures, especially producing movies. In addition, he accused Ryuhei Chiba, the company's executive director and president of Avex Inc. (now Avex Planning and Development), of pursuing personal profit from a few big artists. July 30: In a board meeting, Yoda introduced a resolution calling on Chiba to resign because of an alleged conflict of interest. A source says the disagreement arose because Chiba had signed an artist managed by a member of his family. The board backed Yoda's resolution in a 6-1 vote. However, Matsuura \u2014 described by insiders as a close ally of Chiba \u2014 introduced a second resolution demanding that Yoda step down due to \"a difference of opinion in management principles\". Matsuura's motion was defeated 5-2. He and Chiba resigned the next day. August 2: Matsuura and Chiba announced their resignations in a meeting with employees of Avex. Chiba denied any fault, while Matsuura complained that Avex had lost its love of music and said he wanted to start over. They had the support of many staff who also said they would quit. More significantly, the label's top star, Ayumi Hamasaki, said she would leave. As a result, Avex's stocks in the TSE fell by 16 percent that day. August 3: Due to pressure by employees and artists and to save the company from bankruptcy, Yoda resigned and was replaced by Toshio Kobayashi. ===2010\u2013present=== AGHD is listed at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and B\u00f6rse M\u00fcnchen of Germany under the ticker symbol AX8.
