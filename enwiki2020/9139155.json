    "text": "\"The Thunderer\" is a march composed by John Philip Sousa in 1889. The origin of the name is not officially known, though it is speculated that it gets its name from the \"pyrotechnic [effects] of the drum and bugle in [the] score.\" It is also one of Sousa's most famous and is one of the more difficult compositions to perform. ==The music== The piece is in much the same manner as most of Sousa's music; however, it is one of his first \"distinctly American- sounding marches.\". The march follows the standard form (IAABBCDCDC) that is used in many of his other works. As is common, his themes are contrasting. During the repeat of the B section, Sousa introduces new countermelodic ideas. The trio is songlike. There is a ritardando leading into the repeat of the final theme, segueing to the piece's conclusion. ==Appearances== \"The Thunderer\" was the election theme for ABC News from 1968 to 1972. The song is also used in the Columbo episode Make Me a Perfect Murder, as well as being the main theme from the movie Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze. The song is also used in Regimental Reviews at the United States Coast Guard Academy. ==References== Category:1889 compositions Category:Sousa marches Category:Parlor songs Category:American military marches Category:Concert band pieces ",
