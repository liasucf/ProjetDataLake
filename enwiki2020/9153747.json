    "text": "Oregon Route 182 was an Oregon state highway running from Devils Punch Bowl State Park in Lincoln County to US 101 near Newport, Oregon, United States. OR 182 was known as the Otter Rock Highway No. 182 (see Oregon highways and routes). It was long and ran east-west, entirely within Lincoln County. It primarily functioned as a spur route to the state park. OR 182 was established in 2002 as part of Oregon's project to assign route numbers to highways that previously were not assigned, and, as of July 2007, was unsigned. OR 182 was transferred from ODOT jurisdiction September 26, 2005 and is no longer part of the Oregon state highway system, though it may be maintained as a highway class roadway by either county or local government. == Route description == OR 182 began at Devils Punch Bowl State Park. It headed east to an intersection with US 101 approximately four miles north of Newport, where it ends. == History == OR 182 was assigned to the Otter Rock Highway in 2002.
