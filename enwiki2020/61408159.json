    "text": "This is a list of France women Twenty20 International cricketers. A Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) is an international cricket match between two representative teams. A T20I is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket. In April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full international status to Twenty20 women's matches played between member sides from 1 July 2018 onwards. France women played their first WT20I on 31 July against Jersey during the 2019 France Women's T20I Quadrangular Series. The list is arranged in the order in which each player won her first Twenty20 cap. Where more than one player won her first Twenty20 cap in the same match, those players are listed alphabetically by surname. ==Key== {| |- | valign=\"top\" style=\"width:26%\" | General * \u2013 Captain * \u2013 Wicket-keeper * First \u2013 Year of debut * Last \u2013 Year of latest game * Mat \u2013 Number of matches played | valign=\"top\" style=\"width:25%\" | Batting * Runs \u2013 Runs scored in career * HS \u2013 Highest score * Avg \u2013 Runs scored per dismissal * * \u2013 Batsman remained not out * 50 \u2013 Number of half centuries | valign=\"top\" style=\"width:25%\" | Bowling * Balls \u2013 Balls bowled in career * Wkt \u2013 Wickets taken in career * BBI \u2013 Best bowling in an innings * Ave \u2013 Average runs per wicket | valign=\"top\" style=\"width:24%\" | Fielding * Ca \u2013 Catches taken * St \u2013 Stumpings affected |} ==Players== Statistics are correct as of 3 August 2019. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |+France women T20I cricketers |- align=\"center\" ! scope=\"col\" colspan=5 class=\"unsortable\"| General ! scope=\"col\" colspan=4 class=\"unsortable\"| Batting ! scope=\"col\" colspan=4 class=\"unsortable\"| Bowling ! scope=\"col\" colspan=2 class=\"unsortable\"| Fielding ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=2 class=\"unsortable\"| Ref |- align=\"center\" ! scope=\"col\"|No. ! scope=\"col\"|Name ! scope=\"col\"|First ! scope=\"col\"|Last ! scope=\"col\"|Mat ! scope=\"col\"|Runs ! scope=\"col\"|HS ! scope=\"col\"|Avg ! scope=\"col\"|50 ! scope=\"col\"|Balls ! scope=\"col\"|Wkt ! scope=\"col\"|BBI ! scope=\"col\"|Ave ! scope=\"col\"|Ca ! scope=\"col\"|St |- align=\"center\" | 1 ! scope=\"row\" | | 2019 || 2019 || 6 || || || || 0 || || || || || 3 || 0 || |- align=\"center\" | 2 ! scope=\"row\" | | 2019 || 2019 || 5 || || || || 0 || || || || || 0 || 1 || |- align=\"center\" | 3 ! scope=\"row\" | | 2019 || 2019 || 6 || || || || 0 || || || || || 3 || 0 || |- align=\"center\" | 4 ! scope=\"row\" | | 2019 || 2019 || 6 || || || || 0 || || || || || 2 || 0 || |- align=\"center\" | 5 ! scope=\"row\" | | 2019 || 2019 || 5 || || || || 0 || || || || || 1 || 0 || |- align=\"center\" | 6 ! scope=\"row\" | | 2019 || 2019 || 6 || || || || 0 || || || || || 5 || 0 || |- align=\"center\" | 7 ! scope=\"row\" | | 2019 || 2019 || 5 || || || || 0 || || || || || 0 || 0 || |- align=\"center\" | 8 ! scope=\"row\" | | 2019 || 2019 || 4 || || || || 0 || || || || || 0 || 0 || |- align=\"center\" | 9 ! scope=\"row\" | | 2019 || 2019 || 6 || || || || 0 || || || || || 3 || 0 || |- align=\"center\" | 10 ! scope=\"row\" | | 2019 || 2019 || 6 || || || || 0 || || || || || 1 || 0 || |- align=\"center\" | 11 ! scope=\"row\" | | 2019 || 2019 || 6 || || || || 0 || || || || || 2 || 3 || |- align=\"center\" | 12 ! scope=\"row\" | | 2019 || 2019 || 5 || || || || \u2013 || || || || || 2 || 0 || |} ==References== France ",
