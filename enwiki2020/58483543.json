During his service in this band, Akhundzade participated in the 1971 and 1983 October Revolution Parades on Moscow's Red Square. In 1979, a group of students from Guinea came to study at the school. As the cadets did not know the Russian language, they could not verbally communicate what the national anthem of Guinea (Libert\u00e9) sounded like (the sheet music was not in the files at the time) to Akhundzade in time for the visit of Guinean delegation. Akhundzade later aksed one of the cadets to hum the anthem, after which he transcribed it and orchestrated it the next day. This made an impression on the school administration, which resulted in Akhundzade being awarded the honorary title of Honored Cultural Worker shortly after this event.https://azertag.az/xeber/Yusif_Axundzade_Resmi_qarsilanma_merasimlerinde_dovletlerin_himnlerini_notsuz_ifa_etmeyimiz_her_zaman_teeccuble_qarsilanib-1096010 Some musicians of the Band of the Caspian Higher Naval School who served under the direction of Akhundzade later became teachers, artists and conductors in various cities and countries including one who is a director of military band in Russia.http://uzeyirbook.musigi-dunya.az/ru/data.pl?id=122\u27e8=RU === Post- independence === He began teaching at the academy of music in 1989 before being invited to lead the newly formed Military Band Service of the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan in 1992.
