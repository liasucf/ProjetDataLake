The car is positioned below the T-Roc, making it the smallest SUV model from Volkswagen. It was unveiled on 25 October 2018 in Amsterdam, Shanghai and S\u00e3o Paulo. == Overview == The T-Cross started as a replacement for a cancelled project of a small SUV based on the Volkswagen Taigun concept which was showcased in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2012. It is an SUV based on the Volkswagen Up! with a length of under 3.9 m destined for Europe, Brazil and India, and was planned to be on sale in 2016 after the project was green-lit in 2012. In 2016, Volkswagen cancelled the plan of producing the Taigun after an internal study concluded that its dimension is too small. Volkswagen shifted its focus on developing a Polo-based small SUV instead, which eventually spawned the T-Cross. The Taigun nameplate is being reused as a rebadged long-wheelbase T-Cross for the Indian market.Volkswagen T-Cross Breeze conceptIn March 2016, the T-Cross was previewed as a concept car called the VW T-Cross Breeze at the Geneva Motor Show. This vehicle is, in contrast to the production version, a four-seater convertible with a fabric top. The T-Cross Breeze is long, wide and high. The concept vehicle is powered by a 1.0-litre TSI engine with and of torque. The production version of the T-Cross was officially launched on 25 October 2018 in three cities located in three different continents simultaneously, in Amsterdam, Shanghai and S\u00e3o Paulo, which demonstrates the importance of the T-Cross as a global product. The model is produced in China and Brazil with a modified length of 4.2 m and a longer wheelbase of 2.65 m shared with the \u0160koda Kamiq and Volkswagen Virtus, with the goal of improving interior space and cargo volume.
