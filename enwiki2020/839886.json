There is no chain of narration. The last few pages were left empty, Sharif Razi says in case he came across new Sermons; highlighting that Sharif Razi wrote down anything he came across. Sharif Razi did not follow the same level of scrutiny as followed by Hadith collectors therefore Nahj al-Balagha was not regarded as Sahih (authentic or correct) to the level of the Hadiths collections. Several scholars have sought to trace back the sources of different utterances and letters collected in Nahj al-Balaghah to the works compiled centuries before the birth of Sharif Razi. The most painstaking research in this context was done by an Indian Sunni scholar Imtiyaz Ali Arshi, who died in 1981. He succeeded in tracing back the early sources of 106 sermons, 37 letters and 79 dispersed sayings of Ali ibn Abi Talib in his book Istinad-e Nahj al-balaghah, originally written in Urdu, subsequently translated into Arabic in 1957, then into English and Persian. Besides this work, some others deserve special mention such as Abd al-Zahra al-Husayni al-Khatib's Masadir Nahj al-balaghah, Hibat al-Din al-Hussaini al-Shahristani's Ma huwa Nahj al-balaghah, Sayyid Ali al-Naqawi al-Nasirabadi's introduction to the Urdu translation of Nahj al- balaghah by Mufti Jafar Husayn, and al-Mujam al-mufahras li alfaz Nahj al- balaghah, a joint work of al-Sayyid Kazim al-Muhammadi and al-Shaykh Muhammad Dashti. Sayyid Mohammad Askari Jafery and Sayyid Ali Reza also dealt with the issue of basic sources of Nahj al-balaghah in their prefaces to their separate translations of the book into English. ===Shia=== The collection is regarded by the Shia as authentic.Is the Nahjul-Balaghah an authentic Islamic source in the view of scholars? islamquest.net Retrieved 30 Sep 2018The authenticity of Nahj al-Balaghah makarem.ir Retrieved 30 Sep 2018Is Nahjol Balagha an authentic book? pasokhgooyan.ir Retrieved 30 Sep 2018 ===Sunni=== There can be found diverse views from Sunni perspective regarding the authenticity of Nahj al-Balagha.

Ibn Abi al-Hadid then said that many people claim that sermon to be Sharif al-Radhi\u2019s. He answered by saying that neither Sharif al-Radhi nor anyone else was capable of producing such an eloquent sermon. He continued by saying, \"We have studied Sharif al-Radhi\u2019s writings and are familiar with his style.

Besides, Sheikh Muhammad Abdah (the Egyptian Mufti) confirms that Nahj al-Balagha is the words of Ali.Knowing Nahj al-Balagha ghadeer.org Retrieved 9 Oct 2018 On the other hand, as with the majority of posthumous works of (Sunni and) Shia theology that emerged centuries after the life of Prophet Muhammad, Sunni scholars do not regard the Nahj al-Balagha as authentic. According to one Shi\u2018i source, the first person to raise doubts about its attribution to Ali was Ibn Khallikan, a Sunni scholar (d. 1211/1282).

The following is an incomplete list of summaries on each sermon in the collection. * Sermon 1 In this sermon Ali mentions the genesis of creation of the Universes, Earth and Adam. * Sermon 2 (some consider this part of the previous sermon). In this sermon the creation of Adam is mentioned. * Sermon 3 Known as the \"Sermon of the roar of a camel\" (ash-Shiqshiqiyyah). Ali talks about the period after Muhammad's death about how \u201chis inheritance\u201d (excerpt directly from passage) was taken by the son of Abu Qahahfa (Abu Bakr), manner it was passed to Ibn al-Khattab (Umar), and how Ali felt about it as the caliphate was then designated to the \u201cthird man\u201d (likely referring to the third caliph, Uthman). This Sermon is considered authentic by Shi\u2019a and controversial by Sunni, as it would imply that the rule of the first 3 Caliphs were illegitimate. * Sermon 4, was delivered by Ali on his return from the Battle of Siffin. In this sermon Ali explained the condition of Arabs in pre-Islamic days and the corrupt conditions in which Islamic society had fallen again. * Sermon 5, (some consider this part of the previous sermon), is in praise of Ahl al-Bayt (the progeny of Muhammad). In this sermon Ali mentions that the Ahl al-Bayt are the strong holds of God's commands, and are the ones that can interpret His commands. * Sermon 6, is about the hypocrites. * Sermon 7, is the famous speech of Shaqshaqiyyah (Sermon of the roar of a camel), in this sermon Ali again mentions about the caliphate being snatched from him. \"By Allah, that man, Abu Bakr, snatched away the caliphate (from me) as it was an insignia...\" * Sermon 8, in this sermon Ali has depicted the mentality of Quraysh and what the Ahl al-Bayt have done to teach them Islam and to reform their minds. He finished it with an advice to them to accept religion sincerely. * Sermon 9, After the death of Muhammad when `Abbas ibn `Abd al-Muttalib (uncle of Muhammad) and Abu Sufyan came to Ali to swear allegiance, he advised them in this sermon. * Sermon 10, Talhah and Az Zubayr rebelled against Ali and raised an army to occupy the provinces of Kufa and Basra. Ali resolved the issue instead of fighting. Some people tried to dissuade Ali against his decisions, in reply to the dissuation Ali delivered Sermon 10. * Sermon 11, In sermon 11 Ali describes the mental conditions of those Muslims who in reality were hypocrites and had in their inner hearts no place for truth, justice and Islam. To serve their purpose they stooped to every vice and evil and Shaitan (Satan) was their guide and lord. * Sermon 12, Ali warns Az Zubayr (who turned against Ali). * Sermon 13, Ali replies to the propaganda of the opponents. * Sermon 14, Ali delivered this speech after Talha and Az Zubayr broke their oath of allegiance to Ali. Ali realized that Muawiyah I was behind this and delivered Sermon 14, Followers of truth and religion! Beware that the Satan (Referring to Muawiyya) has amassed his followers \u2026 * Sermon 15, Ali instructs Muhammad Ibn Hanafiya (commander of Ali's army at the Battle of Basra (also called the Battle of the Camel or the Battle of Jamal). * Sermon 16, Speech given after the victory at the Battle of Basra. * Sermon 17, Ali condemned the activities of the people of Basra (Ayesha who had fought against him at the Battle of Basra). * Sermon 18, In this sermon Ali again condemned the actions of the people of Basra. * Sermon 19, is in context of the conquest of Armenia, where the Khums income had been transferred from the state to Marwan I (Marwan ibn Hakam), (a process that Ali would later reverse).{fact} * Sermon 20, this sermon was delivered after the death of caliph Uthman Ibn Affan, when Ali was being offered the caliphate. In it Ali told people what to expect under his Caliphate. * Sermon 21, Ali describes three kind of people found in society and also the best course to be followed in life. * Sermon 22, Ali condemns people who assume the status/title of a Qadi (Judge) without having qualification or enough knowledge for this kind of responsible work. * Sermon 23, remarks of Ali on differences of opinions amongst jurists on the same question of Sharia (Islamic law). * Sermon 24, While Ali was delivering a speech in the mosque of Kufa, Ash'ath ibn Qays (who was the chief of Muawiya's army at the Battle of Siffin) intervened saying that such a speech was harmful to Ali. Sermon 24 was a reply to Ash'ath; \"You a wicked son of a depraved father, a hypocrite, son of an infidel, do you know which part of my speech is harmful and which part is beneficial to me? \u2026\" * Sermon 25, Ali explains how and from whom we can take lessons to mould and reform our lives. In it Ali also reminds people of the hereafter; \"If you had only a true conception of what would happen after death, you would have screamed with horror and trembled with fright \u2026\" * Sermon 26, Ali tells that this life is just a journey and by reducing our sins we could make this journey easy; \"Reduce the burden of your sins and vices so that you may carry on the journey with ease\". * Sermon 27, Talhah and Az Zubayr had wanted to take over the caliphate and therefore murdered Caliph Uthman Ibn Affan, the only obstacle remaining in their way was Ali. They decided to falsely accuse and implicate Ali for the murder. In Sermon 27, Ali tells Talhah and Az Zubayr to be afraid of Allah. * Sermon 28, Ali advises the poor not to envy the rich and the rich to support and help the poor. * Sermon 29, Ali advises people to follow Allah's commands, as that is the only way one can enjoy the hereafter; And, if you are not rewarded in this life, I guarantee for your reward in the hereafter. * Sermon 30, was delivered in the context of Muawiyah I's seizure of some provinces (previously under the control of Ali's caliphate) and the subsequent flight of Ali's Governors. * Sermon 31, believed to be given before Sittin, Ali highlights three points. He illustrates the condition of Arabs in pre-Islamic days, the reasons why he did not take serious steps to defend his causes before the Battle of Bassorah, and how Muawiyah I allegedly purchased the allegiance of 'Amr ibn al-'As. * Sermon 32, This sermon is in praise of Jihad, it shows what it means that is real Jihad is battling with inner self against sins and worldly pleasures and what one can achieve from it. * Sermon 33, Ali advises people to abandon corrupt ways of life and try to achieve salvation. * Sermon 34, Ali criticized those people who said that they were ready to fight for Islam, but practically used excuses, whenever Islam needed defense. * Sermon 35, Ali explains the causes of the murder of Caliph Uthman Ibn Affan and also clarifies himself of not having any connection with the incident. \"If I had ordered him to be killed I undoubtedly would have been his murderer, and if I had prevented people from killing him I would have been his helper. But I have no connection whatsoever with that affair.\" * Sermon 36, in this sermon Ali gives advice to `Abd Allah ibn `Abbas when he is sent to Az Zubayr before the Battle of Bassorah. * Sermon 37, Ali advises people to lead an honest and pious life, he also explained the condition in which people were living in at that time. Ali also describes four main types of people: :** \"Firstly there are those, who abstain from vice, villainy and violence because they are timid and cowards, and have neither means nor enough wealth.\" :** \"Then there are those, who have drawn their swords, have openly declared their evil intentions and have gathered armies around them.\" (Referring to Muawiya(Father Of Yazid) I) :** \"And there are some, who instead of trying to gain blessings of Allah with sincere good deeds, want to secure a high place in this World with pretense of piety and holiness.\" :** \"Lastly there are people weak in mind and depraved in character. They can neither create resources, nor can secure assistance from others, and thus find themselves deprived of wealth and social status. \u2026 cover their humility and poverty under the guise of a religious and contended life \u2026\". Then Ali mentions a fifth group of people: :** \"\u2026there is also an insignificant minority of those pious people, whom the true conception of His Divine Greatness and Might does not allow to be cruel, villainous, and haughty; and whom the fear of the Day of Judgment does not permit to lead a frivolous life.\" * Sermon 38, Ali tells people that his mission is the same as it was in Muhammad's time, My mission today is the same as it was during the time of Muhammad. I shall thrive till I eradicate impiety and injustice, and till I establish a rule of justice and truth, - a humane and divine regime. * Sermon 39, in this sermon Ali has expressed his sorrow over the mental condition of Iraqis, warning them of the results of negligence of duty and indifference to religion. * Sermon 40, when Muawiyah I 's army was on verge of a defeat at the Battle of Siffin, his commander 'Amr ibn al-'As bribed some of Ali's Army officers. Some of the officers came back to Ali and apologised for their betrayal. On this occasion Ali delivered Sermon 40. * Sermon 41, the Battle of Nahrawan took place between Ali and the Kharijites. Before the battle began Ali warned the Kharijites in Sermon 41, I want to warn and advise you against this battle, for you may be killed in it, and the next day sun may shed its morning light upon your mutilated and blood-stained bodies \u2026 * Sermon 42, Ali describes his sincere efforts, courage and fortitude for the cause of Islam. * Sermon 43, is a very short sermon, in which he talks about how pious people \"walk through the darkness\", but because of their strong believe in Allah stay on the right path. * Sermon 44, talks about Malik ibn Ka'ab, who was the Governor of Aynut Tamr (a province), he only had an army of about 100 men to guard this province. Without any prior warning Muawiyah I sent an army to invade the province. When Ali found out, he urged the Muslims to go help Malik ibn Ka'ab. The Muslims were timid and unwilling to go help Malik ibn Ka'ab, seeing this Ali gave Sermon 44. After this sermon finished, Adi ibn Hatim came to Ali with a 1000 soldiers from the Bani Hatim. Ali made Adi the commander of the army. Adi was preparing to depart to Aynut Tamr, when news reached that Malik ibn Ka'ab and his small army of 100 men had defeated Muawiya's horde of a thousand soldiers. * Sermon 45, After breaking away from Ali, the Kharijites used the slogan \"Only Allah is the judge\". Ali in this sermon throws light upon this slogan and the false meaning they wanted to derive from it, the slogan they repeat is true indeed but they deduce wrong meaning and infer from it conclusions which are harmful to mankind. * Sermon 46, To be edited * Sermon 47, Ali tells his people that inordinate cravings and bad deeds would only bring harm. He also points out that good deeds, do not necessarily mean a reward in this life, but will definitely be rewarded in the hereafter. * Sermon 48, Ali delivered this sermon when he got informed that Muawiyah I was getting ready for a war. \"I find that no choice has been left to me; either I have to crush the rebellion by force (therefore go on war) or submit to paganism (do nothing and let Muawiyah I takeover power). * Sermon 49, was delivered when Ali found out that Masqala ibn Hubayra Shaybani, had run away to Muawiyah I with some money of state treasury. \"May Allah not forgive Masqala. In the beginning he acted like a chieftain, but in the end he fled like a slave.\" * Sermon 50, Admixture of right and wrong * Sermon 51, was delivered by Ali on his journey to Syria. * Sermon 52, Ali's prediction on the future of Kufa. * Sermon 53, was delivered at a place called Nukhayla, while he was on his journey to Syria. * Sermon 54, Ali explains the theory of accepting the existence of God. \"\u2026those who have not seen Him physically cannot deny his existence \u2026\" * Sermon 55, throws light on the causes of people going astray. \"Surely the causes of discord and rebellion against religion are that people follow the dictates of their minds and introduce innovations and schisms against the explicit orders of the Book of Allah.\" * Sermon 56, delivered at the Battle of Siffin, when Muawiya's forces had occupied the Euphrates and stopped the supply of water to Ali and his army. Ali's forces re-captured the river and allowed Muawiya's army to use as much water as they'd like. Before the Battle for the re-capturing of The Euphrates began, Ali delivered this sermon. * Sermon 57, is a warning to those people that do not attach any importance to the hereafter. * Sermon 58, Ali explains what kind of animals can be sacrificed on the occasion of Eid al-Adha. * Sermon 59, delivered just before the Battle of Siffin, when the forces of Ali were asking permission to fight. * Sermon 60, Ali was trying to delay the war (at the Battle of Siffin). Some people thought that Ali was afraid of death, this sermon was a reply to those people. \"It is not right for you to say that I am hesitating to start the war because I am afraid of death. By Allah I never delayed war even for a day but with the hope that some rebels might come back to me and through to me they might be guided towards religion \u2026\" * Sermon 61, as mentioned in the previous sermon, Ali was trying to delay the war, some people started complaining, saying that they could wait no longer. But when war broke out, these same people started acting cowardly. This sermon was for these people. * Sermon 62, this is a prediction of Ali about the rule of Muawiyah I after him. The tells that Muawiyah I will force people to calumniate and dishonour him (Ali). In this sermon Ali advises people what to do then. \"Certainly after my death you will be overpowered and ruled by a pot- bellied glutton (Muawiyah I). Beware! He will ask you to calumniate me and to disown me. So far as calumniation is concerned you can obey his orders because it will save you from his wrath and tyranny\u2026 but so far as disowning me is concerned you should not do so, because I am a Muslim by birth and I was the first to testify \u2026\" * Sermon 63, was given when Muawiyah I violated the terms of the Treaty of Siffin and started getting ready to invade Kufa, Ali decided to invade Shaam first. He asked the Kharijites to come for help, they refused because of the arbitration in the Battle of Siffin. In the reply of the refusal, Ali delivered Sermon 63. \"May you be punished by Allah \u2026 Beware! Your misguided policy will bring death and destruction to you.\" * Sermon 64, was delivered when Ali got informed that the Kharijites were trying to invade Basra. * Sermon 65, was delivered when Ali was informed that some people were planning to assassinate him. In this sermon he declared: \"Allah's protecting shield is still protecting me. On the day which is fixed for my death, the shield will disappear and hand me over to death. On that day death will not miss its target and the mortal wound will not heal.\" * Sermon 66, is believed to be part of Sermon 57, by some commentators. In it Ali has recounted the realities of life, what one has to face and how to deal with it. * Sermon 67, Ali warns people of certain basic facts about life. He also advises people to lead a pious life. * Sermon 68, to be edited * Sermon 69, is regarding the Battle of Siffin. One day both the armies fought continuously for 24 hours, the fighting in the night was terrible and is known as Laylatul Harir. The next morning the delivered sermon 69, in this sermon Ali refers to the Battle of Siffin as Jihad. \"Remember that Allah is watching you and you are fighting under command of the cousin and son-in-law of the [Muhammad]\u2026 do not accept the shame and disgrace of a defeat or a rout, for which you shall be punished on the Day of Judgement, because yours is a Jihad in defence of Islam, truth and justice.\" * Sermon 70, refers to Abu Bakr's claim to caliphate and the incident of Saqifah. * Sermon 71, Sermon delivered on the death of Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr (who was killed by Muawiyah I's forces). * Sermon 72, directed to some of the companions of Ali. * Sermon 73, Ali narrated this dream on the eve of his martyrdom. Next morning he received a mortal wound during the morning prayers. \"As I was sitting I fell asleep and dreamt that Prophet Muhammad came in front of me. I told him of intrigues, enmities and suffering that fell to my lot from the hands of his followers. He (Muhammad) told me to curse them. And I prayed to Allah to give me better companions than they and to them a tyrant ruler in my place.\" * Sermon 74, to the people of Iraq. * Sermon 75, is regarding the way to supplicate for peace and blessings on Muhammad. * Sermon 76, was given after the Battle of Bassorah. Marwan I (one of the chiefs of the enemy forces) was taken prisoner. Marwan requested Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali (the two sons of Ali and Fatimah) to request Ali to release him, in return he would pay his oath of allegiance to Ali. Ali released Marwan, but on the issue of the oath of allegiance, the delivered sermon 76. \"Did he not swear oath of allegiance to me after the death of Uthman Ibn Affan\u2026\" The sermon also contains a prophecy on the future of the Islamic World, \"Remember he (Marwan) is going to have a kingdom and it will last only so long as it takes a dog time to lick its nose.
