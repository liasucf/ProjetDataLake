    "text": "The white-bellied duiker (Cephalophus leucogaster) is a duiker found in central Africa. Little is known on the ecology of the species, and only some information on habitat and diet is available. Duikers are a fairly small species of antelope that originate from, and still reside in, sub-Saharan Africa. The white-bellied duiker ranges in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon,(Wilson & Reeder, 1993) while it is likely to have been extirpated in Uganda.(East, 1996) == References == white-bellied duiker Category:Fauna of Central Africa white-bellied duiker Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray ",
