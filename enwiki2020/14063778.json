One of the leading baritones of the 20th century and particularly associated with the French and Italian repertoires, he was considered a fine singing actor equally at home in dramatic or comic roles and gave regular song recitals. He was a long-term member of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique and the Paris Opera, but forged a long career internationally at leading opera houses in Europe and the U.S. His large discography spans five decades, and he was considered as \u201cthe ambassador of French song\u201d.Alain P\u00e2ris. Dictionnaire des interpr\u00e8tes et de l'interpretation musicale au XX si\u00e8cle. \u00c9ditions Robert Laffont, Paris, 1995, p197. ==Early life and studies== Born Gabriel Augustin-Raymond-Th\u00e9odore- Louis Bacquier in B\u00e9ziers, France, on 17 May 1924, he was the only child of railway employees.Oussenko, Sylvie. Gabriel Bacquier, le genie de l'interpretation. MJW F\u00e9dition, Paris, 2011, p16. As a young boy, he was fascinated by everything to do with singing: records, broadcasts and photos of singers.Segalini S. People 130: Gabriel Bacquier. Opera, June 1982. Leaving school aged 14, he worked at his uncle's print-shop, while studying in Montpellier to become a commercial artist, but during the Vichy regime, to avoid the round-ups and deportations by the Service du travail obligatoire, his parents arranged for him to do national service in the Chantiers de Jeunesse on the railways during the Occupation. As a teenager he took voice lessons with a Madame Bastard in B\u00e9ziers in his free time and made his operatic debut during the war as Ourrias in Gounod's Mireille in the town arena. After World War II, he entered the Paris Conservatoire, receiving a scholarship because of his family's modest means,Oussenko, Sylvie. Gabriel Bacquier, le genie de l'interpretation. MJW F\u00e9dition, Paris, 2011, p20. and graduated in 1950. He was a contemporary of, and shared his student life with, future leading French singers R\u00e9gine Crespin, Xavier Depraz, Michel S\u00e9n\u00e9chal and Michel Roux.Crespin, R\u00e9gine. \u00c0 la sc\u00e8ne, \u00e0 la ville, Arles, Actes Sud, 1997, p47. () In his final year, the director of the Conservatoire, Claude Delvincourt, allowed him leave to work at the Op\u00e9ra de Nice in the 1949\u201350 season, singing small roles in operas and operettas; this along with regular singing spots in cinemas gave him important experience and income before his next career steps. Having already gained a first prize for op\u00e9ra comique in his penultimate year, he won first prize for singing and second prize for opera at the conclusion of his formal studies. Around this time he also took a course in dramatic art. ==Career in France and Belgium== He joined the opera company of Jos\u00e9 Beckmans in 1950, and was a member of La Monnaie in Brussels from 1953 until 1956, making his debut in the title role of Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia. There he sang the French repertory, both in opera (Gounod's Faust, Delibes' Lakm\u00e9, Massenet's Manon and Werther) and in operetta (Ang\u00e9lique, La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, Les Cloches de Corneville, Miss Heylett, Monsieur Beaucaire). He also appeared there in Puccini's La Boheme and Madame Butterfly, and in Smetana's The Bartered Bride.The digital opera archives of La Monnaie. Accessed 11 September 2008. While at the Monnaie, the French soprano Martha Angelici, whose husband was Fran\u00e7ois Agostini, director of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique at the time, sang in Les p\u00eacheurs de perles with him; she suggested that he audition for the Paris company, which accepted him. Bacquier made his debut at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in Paris in 1956, as Sharpless in Madama Butterfly, soon followed by Alfio in Cavalleria Rusticana and Albert in Werther. Having stood in at short notice to sing Verdi's Rigoletto at the Paris Opera,{Oussenko, p37} after his transfer to that house he made his official debut at the Palais Garnier on 21 September 1959 as Germont in Verdi's La traviata, and was soon seen as Valentin, Mercutio and again as Rigoletto. In 1960 he sang as Scarpia in Puccini's Tosca opposite Renata Tebaldi, and went with the company to Venice, appearing as Ramiro in L'Heure espagnole. In 1960, he made his first appearance at the Aix-en-Provence Festival as Mozart's Don Giovanni, and the first time an opera from the festival had been broadcast around Europe by Eurovision. Seen in Vienna and London, these performances led to engagements outside France and the start of his international career.Bury, Laurent.

At the New York Met in 1982, a critic noted that the \"best performance [in Il Barbiere di Siviglia] came from Gabriel Bacquier as a classic Bartolo. Every phrase, every gesture, every note, was beautifully timed and projected. It seemed improbable that last season's Covent Garden Golaud could be so marvellous a Bartolo\".Rosenthal, Harold.

In 1975 a critic reviewing Donizettis's L'elisir d'amore commented that \"broad humour is quite foreign to Bacquier's nature ... his doctor [Dulcamara] is a serious Archie Rice type, no caricature but a real man weighed down by his own charlatanism and basically sad that mankind is so gullible\".Pitt, Charles.
