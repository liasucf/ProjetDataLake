    "text": "Forest Hills is a station on the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens, New York City. Like other LIRR stations within New York City, passengers may take advantage of the CityTicket program on weekends. It is lightly used compared to other stations in the city, with only 1,967 weekday riders; many residents opt for the subway because of its increased service and direct express trains to Midtown Manhattan. The station is wheelchair accessible. ==Location== Located in the Queens neighborhood of the same name, Forest Hills is situated on 71st Avenue (also known as Continental Avenue) between Austin and Burns Streets. It is also the northern boundary of Station Square, a historic Tudor town center, which was across from a building known as the \"Forest Hills Inn.\" The station is also just east of the West Side Tennis Club. Two blocks to the north along 71st Avenue is the Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue subway station, one of the busiest in Queens. ==History== Built in 1910, the Forest Hills station is one of the oldest operating passenger railway stations in New York City, predating IND subway expansion to the area in the mid 1930s. Being subsequently remodeled for handicapped accessibility with ramps, it is one of two LIRR stations without standard blue and white signage (the other is Nostrand Avenue). Instead there are plaques and antique signs that complement the surrounding area. On July 4, 1917, former President Theodore Roosevelt made his \"Unification Speech\" from the steps of this station. In November 1963, the LIRR announced a plan to shorten the platforms at Forest Hills and Kew Gardens by . The railroad's justification was that ridership at the stations was low, and did not warrant repairing the crumbling concrete. These sections of platforms had been installed in about 1929 to allow the stations to accommodate full-length trains. This move was opposed by civic groups, and resulted in an investigation by the Public Service Commission. However, the platform extensions were removed in 1965 or 1966. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), in its 2010\u20132014 capital program, proposed lengthening the four-car-long platforms at Forest Hills and Kew Gardens to allow additional train cars to board at the station. The platform extensions would reduce waiting time at the station while allowing for more efficient operations between Jamaica and Penn Station. Although $4.5 million was allocated for the project, the money was ultimately redistributed to other projects. On July 26, 2018, it was announced that the LIRR planned to extend the platforms at Kew Gardens and Forest Hills by to accommodate six-car trains. The platform extensions will consist of fiberglass decking supported by steel scaffolding structures, allowing the extensions to be completed quickly, and at a low cost, while allowing the LIRR to plan for a permanent solution. Preparation work began during the week of July 23 and the new extensions went into service the week of September 12, 2018. ==Station layout== A local station, Forest Hills has two side platforms, both six cars long, and four tracks. The relatively flat and straight stretch of track at Forest Hills has been used for PATH PA-1 and R44 speed tests. {| cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" rowspan=6 valign=top|P Platform level |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\" colspan=2|Platform A, side platform |- |style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 3 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 services toward () |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 1 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 services does not stop here \u2192 |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 2 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 services does not stop here \u2192 |- |Track 4 | services toward and Points East () \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text- align:center;\" colspan=2|Platform B, side platform |- |style=\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50|G |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Street level |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=550|Entrances/exits |} ==Gallery== File:Forhillirrjeh.jpg|Seen from Station Plaza File:ForestHills-StationSq.jpg|At Station Square File:Forest Hills.jpg|Station Square from Greenway Terrace File:Forest Hills (LIRR).jpg|A station sign at the Forest Hills station; this sign design is limited to the Forest Hills station. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Forest Hills Station (The SubwayNut) * Burns Street entrance from Google Maps Street View * Continental Avenue entrance from Google Maps Street View * Platforms from Google Maps Street View Category:Long Island Rail Road stations in New York City Category:Railway stations in Queens, New York Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1911 Category:Forest Hills, Queens Category:1911 establishments in New York (state) ",
