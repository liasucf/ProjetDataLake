The mayor of Lockhart Shire is yet to be determined following the 2012 local government election. ==Proposed amalgamation== A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the Lockhart Shire merge with the Corowa and Urana shires to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 16,000. In May 2016 the Minister for Local Government announced that following an independent review of merger proposals, the Government decided that the Corowa and Urana shire councils merge to form the Federation Council; while the Lockhart Shire would not amalgamate. ==Heritage listings== Lockhart Shire has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: *Chinese Crossing *The Rock railway station == Council == ===Current composition and election method=== Lockhart Shire Council is composed of nine councillors elected proportionally as three separate wards, each electing three councillors.
