Records discography accessed April 4, 2011 In the album's liner notes, Rudd says that \"the idea for this album, i.e. what players and compositions to use, came to me while in San Francisco with Archie Shepp's band in February of 1966.\"Rudd, Roswell. Statement in Everywhere, Impulse 9126 album liner note. A preceding Impulse! release, Archie Shepp Live in San Francisco featured that group's February 19, 1966 performance at the Both/And Club. Since the time of the album's initial release it has been re-issued once in the United States: on the 1998 compilation CD Mixed, joined with October 1961 performances by the Cecil Taylor Unit (originally released as part of Gil Evans' album Into the Hot). The album had only previously been issued on CD (catalog # MVCI-23046) with its original title and artist name, in 1991 by MCA Victor, Japan. ==Reception== The Allmusic review written in the 1990s by Scott Yanow awarded the album 2\u00bd stars calling it \"An intriguing but far from essential date\".Yanow, S. Allmusic Review accessed April 4, 2011 However, Yanow qualifies the \"far from essential\" remark in his other review of Everywhere's four tracks on the 1998 compilation CD Mixed, where he states \"Although not Roswell Rudd's greatest album, there are enough fascinating ensembles on this set for it to nearly hold its own with Cecil Taylor's more essential session\".Yanow, S.
