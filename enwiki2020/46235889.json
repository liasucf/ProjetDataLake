The park includes varied flora areas and emphasized the use of natural flora matching the existing coastal flora of the area. Furthermore, in the park there are wide lawns for public use. The park addresses a diverse target of users: families, children, adults, open air sports, bicycle riders, joggers etc. The park is located along the southern entry to the city and was built by the initiative of Haifa Municipality, in co-operation with Hecht Foundation. === Shikmona Coastal Park and Promenade, Haifa === Shikmona Coastal Park and Promenade Haifa Shikmona coast is a narrow strip of about 80 dunam, divided by the rail way from park Hecht. Shikmona coast is a National Park and a Marine Nature Reserve. Tel Shikmona is located at the north end of the park. Much effort was taken to preserve the existing coastal flora, as well as to reintroduce the local flora which had been typical of this area in the distant past. The coastal complex of Hecht Park and Shikmona Coastal Park is designated to respond to the ever- growing needs for recreation activities, exposing the city residents and its visitors to the ecological, landscape and archaeological values of this unique shore. Shikmona Coastal Park includes a pedestrian promenade of about 1 km and a bicycle path of 1.6 km. The park was erected by the initiative of Haifa Municipality, with the assistance of a contribution of the Electric Company. ===Israel Cross Highway (no. 6), Ramot Menashe section=== Israel Cross Highway (no. 6) This section of the Israel Cross Highway passes through a highly sensitive landscape of Oak hills. The road crosses also 11 river beds some of which are Nature Reserves. The landscape restoration concept was of an ecological-landscape, reconstructing the landscape, which had existed prior to carrying out the road, and blended into the natural and agricultural landscapes around the road. The plant restoration complements the \"external\" landscape and \"interweaves\" the patterns of the landscape around. Seeds, and geophytes were gathered, prior to carrying out the works, for sprouting local habitats. The use of local flor enables to reduce the water quantity required for irrigation and emphasizes the seasonal change experience of the country's landscapes. Greenstein Har-Gil Firm \"accompanied\" the engineering planning from its early stages. The landscape design included a landscape analysis, participating in determining the horizontal and vertical road route in order to minimize the environmental damage, examining the various alternatives and determining the location and length of the bridges and tunnels as well as planning the interchanges. Due to the landscape sensitivity of the area and the nature of the planning process, the landscape and environmental aspects received particularly great emphasis and importance and affected significantly the engineering of the road. Erecting the road was managed by Cross Israel Highway Company. == Awards and Competitions == Over the years the firm staff has gained recognition and appreciation for many projects: * Karavan Award for landscape architecture, Tel-Aviv municipality, 2009, for Hecht Park in Haifa * Azrieli Urban Planning Prize, Council for a Beautiful Israel, 2006, for the German Colony, Haifa in Haifa * The Magshim Award, the Council for a Beautiful Israel, 2001, for the German Colony in Haifa * A.
