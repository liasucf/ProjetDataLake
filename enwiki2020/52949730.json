He was subsequently awarded a PhD in Developmental Neurobiology by University College London.\"LMB welcomes Radu Aricescu at new Group Leader\", MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, 2 May 2017. Retrieved 6 June 2017. In 2002, Aricescu worked at the Neural Development Unit in the University of London's Institute of Child Health.A. R. Aricescu, I. W. McKinnell, W. Halfter, A. W. Stoker, \"Heparan sulfate proteoglycans are ligands for receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma\", Molecular and Cellular Biology, vol. 22, issue 6 (2002), pp. 1881\u20131892. By 2006, he was part of the Cancer Research UK Receptor Structure Research Group in the Division of Structural Biology (STRUBI) at the University of Oxford's Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics.A.

Already a fellow at the Wellcome Trust Centre, in December 2010 he was appointed Senior Research Lecturer and in 2016 the University awarded him the title of Professor of Molecular Neuroscience.The University of Oxford Gazette, 27 January 2011, no. 4941, vol. 141.

In 2017, Aricescu relocated to the Neurobiology Division of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, as a group leader. == Research == Aricescu's research focuses on the molecular bases for way the brain acquires and stores information through learning and memory; more specifically, he has studied the \"structural and functional characterisation of synaptic receptors\". This has applications in understanding ageing, and a wide range of neurological and psychiatric problems.\"Professor A. Radu Aricescu\", Nuffield Department of Medicine. Retrieved 22 January 2017.
