    "text": "Infante Fernando of Portugal (), or Ferdinand in English, was a Portuguese infante (prince), son of King Afonso II of Portugal and his wife Urraca of Castile, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile. Fernando was born in the summer of 1217 and was made Lord of Serpa and Lamego in 1223. It is known that he travelled to Rome in 1237 to beg for a pardon from Pope Gregory IX for his violence against certain clerics. He died January 19, 1246. ==Marriage and offspring== He married Sancha Fern\u00e1ndez de Lara, daughter of Fernando N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Lara and wife Mayor Gonz\u00e1lez, without any documented issue. He had, however, a bastard son by an unknown woman named Sancho Fernandes de Serpa, who was a Prior at Santo Esteban de Alfama, but had illegitimate issue, being the ancestor of the de Serpa family. ==Coat of arms== In a study from the Spanish historian Faustino Men\u00e9ndez-Pidal de Navascu\u00e9s,Published in \"A Monarquia Portuguesa\", Reader's Digest, Lisbon, April 1999, page 368, the infante Fernando should have used a Coat of Arms representing a Wyvern (Serpe in Portuguese), the symbol of his Lordship of Serpa, in south Alentejo, with a border where, alternately, are represented the arms of Portugal (paternal ancestry) and those of Castile (maternal ancestry). ==Ancestors== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * Category:1217 births Category:1246 deaths Category:Portuguese infantes Category:House of Burgundy-Portugal Category:Portuguese royalty Category:13th-century Portuguese people ",
