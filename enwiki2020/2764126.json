It connects Sm\u00e5landsfarvandet in the north with the Bay of Mecklenburg in the south. It is navigable for craft of up to 6 metres draught in its northern part and is used for commercial traffic to Nyk\u00f8bing Falster. The southern part is much shallower with a minimum depth of approximately 2 metres, and can only be used by yachts and other small craft. Guldborgsund is crossed by two bascule bridges, Frederick IX Bridge at Nyk\u00f8bing and Guldborgsund Bridge at Guldborg, at the northern end of the strait. There is also a modern tunnel carrying euro route E47 from Copenhagen. Nyk\u00f8bing Falster, Guldborg and Sundby have all have marinas in Guldborgsund. Furthermore, the open-air museum Middle Ages Centre has got a museum harbour which was dug out in the mid 1990s.
