In 1993 all colleges in the post-16 sector ceased to be controlled by their local education authorities and Stanmore College became a Corporation funded by the Further Education Funding Council, and since 2001 by the Learning and Skills Council, which has been replaced by successor organisations: the Skills Funding Agency and the Young People\u2019s Learning Agency. The College facilitates learning from Further Education (the Sixth Form) to Part-Time (Courses for Adults) and Employer Training. Its Sixth Form provides education to an average of 1,500 16- to 19-year-old school leavers.
