It has been designated a District Centre for Al-Shahaniya Municipality, meaning that it is being developed to serve the needs of nearby communities, such as Al Suwaihliya. ==Etymology== The name derives from the Arabic word 'jamila', which means 'beauty'. It was so named because of its relative abundance of vegetation.

Al Jemailiya is in north-west Qatar. The village of Al Qa'iya is to the north-east. The town is made up of two adjacent villages which formed around the Al Jemailiya well. Transport between the two sections is facilitated by Al Jemailiya Road and Lebsayyer Road. The two villages are: *Al Jemailiya Al Naeem (), the northern section which was named after the Na'im tribe. *Al Jemailiya Al Shahwan (), the southern and main section which was named after the Shahwan tribe. ==History== In J.G. Lorimer's 1908 publication Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, he makes mention of \"Jimal\u012byah\" as a nomadic outpost situated \"16 miles east- north-east of the foot of Do\u1e29at Faishsh\u0101kh\". He stated that the inhabitants received good water from a masonry lined well at a depth of 18 fathoms. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.
