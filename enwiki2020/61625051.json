Particularly important for Tina, riding high as she is > currently following her \"Acid Queen\" role in \"Tommy\". This tune is a super > rocker, with driving rhythm, screamin\u2019 vocals by Tina and the man. Fine > break with some funky piano, guitar and vocal interplay between this super > duo. What a way to break out into the top ten for one of Americas fave > ensembles. == Chart performance == ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1975) !Peak position |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | align=\"center\" |88 |- |US Billboard Hot Soul Singles | align=\"center\" |31 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 | align=\"center\" |70 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 R&B; | align=\"center\" |35 |- |US Record World Singles | align=\"center\" |64 |- |US Record World R&B; Singles | align=\"center\" |34 |- |Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) | align=\"center\" |20 |- |Netherlands (Single Top 100) | align=\"center\" |9 |- |UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|53 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1975) !Rank |- |Netherlands (Single Top 100) | align=\"center\" |79 |} == References == Category:1975 songs Category:1975 singles Category:Ike & Tina Turner songs Category:Songs written by Ike Turner Category:Song recordings produced by Ike Turner Category:United Artists Records singles Category:Songs about sexuality Category:Male\u2013female vocal duets ",
