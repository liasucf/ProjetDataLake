    "text": "The status of religious freedom in North America varies from country to country. States can differ based on whether or not they guarantee equal treatment under law for followers of different religions, whether they establish a state religion (and the legal implications that this has for both practitioners and non-practitioners), the extent to which religious organizations operating within the country are policed, and the extent to which religious law is used as a basis for the country's legal code. There are further discrepancies between some countries' self-proclaimed stances of religious freedom in law and the actual practice of authority bodies within those countries: a country's establishment of religious equality in their constitution or laws does not necessarily translate into freedom of practice for residents of the country. Additionally, similar practices (such as having religious organizations register with the government) can have different consequences depending on other sociopolitical circumstances specific to the countries in question. Every country in North America includes provisions for the freedom of religion or freedom of conscience in its constitution. Several countries also have formally outlawed discrimination on religious grounds,International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Jamaica US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Nicaragua, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Bahamas, The, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. and according to US State Department reports many countries in the region have no outstanding issues regarding breaches of religious freedom due to government intervention or societal pressure.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Antigua and Barbuda, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Dominica, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Seven countries have blasphemy laws which have been part of their legal codes since the British colonial era, but which are not currently enforced. Rastafarians face discrimination and obstacles to religious practice in many countries in the region, often due in part to countries outlawing cannabis, which is used in Rastafarian religious rituals.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Barbados, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Roman Catholicism is the state religion of a few countries in North America,International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Costa Rica, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Dominican Republic, US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. and a couple more provide preferential treatment to the Catholic Church despite not officially establishing it as a state religion.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Guatemala, US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Haiti, US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. == Antigua and Barbuda == The constitution of Antigua and Barbuda establishes the freedom of religious belief in the country. Members of clergy are not allowed to run for political office. Representatives of the Rastafari community have complained that legal restrictions such as the criminalization of cannabis and mandatory vaccination policies are contrary to their religious beliefs, although the government is also reportedly working with the community to reach a compromise on these issues. As of 2017, there have been no reports of significant societal breaches or abuses of the freedom of religion in Antigua and Barbuda according to the United States Department of State. == The Bahamas == The constitution of the Bahamas provides for the freedom of religion and prohibits discrimination based on belief. The country has no state religion, although the preamble to its constitution mentions \"Christian values\". Obeah is illegal in the Bahamas, punishable by a jail sentence. This law, however, is traditionally unenforced. Similarly, laws prohibiting the publication of blasphemy (with exceptions for opinions \"expressed in good faith and in decent language\") are also unenforced. As of 2017, there have been no reports of significant societal breaches or abuses of the freedom of religion in the Bahamas according to the United States Department of State. == Barbados == The constitution of Barbados provides for the freedom of religion and prohibits discrimination based on creed. There is a law against \"blasphemous libel\" but it is unenforced. Religious groups are allowed to establish private schools and provide religious instruction, with some support from the government. Religious groups are not required to register with the government, but may do so for tax purposes. Rastafarians are unable to perform some religious rituals due to the illegality of cannabis. Representatives of the community have also objected to mandatory vaccinations for schoolchildren, and reported that Rastafarians face disproportionate scrutiny at security checkpoints, as well as facing some social discrimination. Muslims in Barbados have objected to being forced to pose without head coverings for identification and passport photographs. According to the government, these measures are purely for security reasons. == Belize == The Constitution of Belize establishes the freedom of religion. Discrimination on religious grounds is illegal. A law against blasphemy is unenforced. The Belize Council of Churches, a body which includes representatives from several Christian denominations, appoints one senator to the senate of Belize with the approval of the Governor-General. The law also establishes that prisoners in jails must have their religious beliefs respected and accommodated.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Belize, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Religious groups are required to register with the government in order to operate in the country. Religious groups are exempt from certain taxes. Missionaries are required to register with the government and purchase a religious worker's permit. The public school curriculum for primary schools includes nondenominational \"spirituality\" classes that introduce world religions, as well as ethics and morals associated with religion. Most public schools are managed by Christian churches. A few schools are run by non-Christian religious groups. ==Canada== Religious freedom in Canada is a constitutionally protected right as part of Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, allowing believers the freedom to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. There is no established church, however religious groups can qualify for tax-exemption. The amount of funding religious schools receive varies from province to province. In many provinces religious schools are government funded in the same way other independent schools are. In most parts of Canada there is a Catholic education system alongside the secular \"public\" education system. They all run on Catholic principles and include religious activities and instruction as a matter of course. They are not exclusively attended by practicing Catholics. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which is entrenched in the Constitution, states in the preamble that Canada \"is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law.\" Freedom of religion as also guaranteed. The Supreme Court of Canada, in the case of Her Majesty The Queen in Right of Canada v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., [1985] (1 S.C.R. 295) ruled that a 1906 statute that required most places to be closed on Sunday did not have a legitimate purpose in a \"free and democratic society,\" and was an unconstitutional attempt to establish a religious-based closing law (see Blue law.) == Costa Rica == The constitution of Costa Rica establishes Roman Catholicism as the state religion and provides it with special privileges and funding. The constitution also prohibits the government from interfering with the free practice of religion, a provision that is respected in practice. Religious groups with at least ten members may register with the government in order to be able to raise funds and own property. There is no penalty for not being registered, other than a lack of access to these privileges. Religious marriage ceremonies other than those conducted by the Catholic Church are not recognized by the government. Couples married through such ceremonies must also obtain a civil union from a public notary in order to have their marriage legally recognized. The government provides funding to private religious schools regardless of religion. == Cuba == The constitution of Cuba establishes the freedom of religion and prohibits religious discrimination.Oliva, Enrique Lopez. \"Religious reawakening: stirrings in Cuba.\" \"> Following the Cuban Revolution, in the 1960s Cuba's government polemicized against the Catholic Church, which was accused of being Francoist and anti-communist, and priests were imprisoned and harassed by the government. Additionally, the Communist Party of Cuba did not allow non-atheists to become party members. Since the 1980s, the government of Cuba has taken an increasingly permissive stance towards religious practice, first thawing relations with Protestant groups which were encouraged to practice their religion, and then later inviting the Pope John Paul II in the 90s to visit the country (all subsequent popes have made official visits to Cuba since then).Jim Yardley, \"Praising Pope, Cuban President says he might return to Church.\" New York Times May 11, 2015 A4. The government, however, continues to restrict the Catholic Church's communications and only allows it to receive funding from sources that it approves. == Dominica == The constitution of Dominica provides for the freedom of religion and thought. This is enforced by the government, although the Rastafarian community objects to the illegal status of cannabis in Dominica, as cannabis plays an important role in their religious practice. The government subsidizes the salaries of teachers at private religious schools. Public schools typically include optional non-denominational prayers in morning assemblies. Religious groups may register with the government in order to receive non-profit status. According to the US Department of State, there have been no significant societal breaches of religious freedom in Dominica. == Dominican Republic == The constitution of the Dominican Republic provides for the freedom of religion. Catholicism is the state religion and the Catholic Church receives special privileges, such as subsidies for clergy salaries and the transfer of property to the Church. Non-Catholic religious groups can register with the government in order to receive tax exemptions and to be allowed to officiate marriages. Public schools include religious studies classes with curricula that are overseen by the Catholic Church. Parents can choose to have their children skip such classes, and private schools are not required to provide them. Private religious schools may offer their own religious curricula. == El Salvador == The constitution of El Salvador provides for the freedom of religion and prohibits religious discrimination. Publicly offending others' religious beliefs or damaging religious objects is punishable by imprisonment. Members of the clergy may not hold senior government positions, and are forbidden from joining political parties.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 El Salvador, US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Religious groups may register with the government for the purposes of tax-exemption and acquiring building permits. Special visas are required for individuals who wish to travel to El Salvador to engage in proselytizing. Public school education is secular. Private schools may include religious content in their curricula, but do not receive government support. Since 2016, clergy have limited access to prisons, due to concerns that some members of the clergy were using prison visits to smuggle items into prisons. == Grenada == The constitution of Grenada establishes the freedom of religion. The country's legal code bans the publication of blasphemy, but this is not enforced in practice.International Religious Freedom Report 2017, US State Department, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Religious groups may register in order to receive tax exemption and to sponsor missionaries from outside the country. The government subsidizes religiously affiliated private schools. As of 2017, members of minority religious groups reported being able to practice their religions openly without interference. == Guatemala == The constitution of Guatemala establishes the freedom of religion. While it is not a state religion, the Catholic Church is recognized as \"a distinct legal personality\" that receives certain privileges. According to the constitution, no member of the clergy of any religion may serve as president, vice president, government minister, or as a judge. Registration for religious groups is not required, but provides access to property purchase and tax exemptions. The constitution includes a commitment to protect the rights of indigenous Maya groups to practice their religion. Mayan religious groups are allowed to use historical sites on government-owned property for ceremonies. However, representatives of Mayan groups have complained that their access is limited and subject to other obstacles, such as being required to pay fees. Public schools may choose to offer religious instruction, but there is no national framework for such classes. Private religious schools are allowed to operate as well. == Haiti == The constitution of Haiti establishes the freedom of religion. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs oversees and monitors religious groups and laws affecting them. While Catholicism has not been the state religion since 1987, a 19th century concordat with the Holy See continues to confer preferential treatment to the Catholic Church, in the form of stipends for clergy and financial support to churches and religious schools. The Catholic Church also retains the right to appoint certain amounts of clergy in Haiti without the government's consent. Religious groups are not required to register with the government, but may do so in order to receive special standing in legal proceedings, tax exemptions, and civil recognition for marriage and baptismal certificates. The government has continually failed to recognize marriages performed by Haitian Vodou practitioners, despite it being a registered religion. Government officials claim that they are working with the Vodou community to establish a certification process for their clergy in order to resolve this issue. Additionally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has continually not approved a request from the Muslim community to register as a religious group, which has been outstanding since the 1980s. According to the government, this was due to not having received necessary financial documentation as part of the registration process. According to the government, Muslims in jail do not reliably have access to halal food and Muslim clergy due to a lack of resources. Protestant and Catholic clergy have reported good relations with the government. Representatives of the Vodou and Muslim communities have reported social stigma against their communities, and discrimination in employment. == Honduras == The constitution of Honduras establishes the freedom of religion. The National Congress of Honduras has the power to legally recognize religious groups, which confers to them tax-exempt status and other privileges. The Catholic Church is the only organization legally recognized as a religious group, although other religious groups can register with the government as NGOs. Some religious groups have criticized this as constituting preferential treatment for the Catholic Church at the expense of other groups.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Honduras, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The constitution prohibits religious leaders from holding elected office or publicly making political statements. Despite this, some Protestant pastors have been elected to government positions and serve on government advisory bodies. The government also frequently includes Catholic or Protestant prayers as part of official events and ceremonies, which has been criticized by representatives of other religious groups. Clergy are provided exemptions from being required to testify in court about information acquired from religious confessions. Vicars, bishops, and archbishops of the Catholic Church, as well as similarly high ranking members of other religions, are not required to appear in court if subpoenaed. Public schools are required to teach secular curricula. Private religious schools also operate in Honduras. Foreign missionaries must register with the government. Some religious groups have reached agreements with the government to expedite this process. Conscientious objection to military service is protected by law, including objection on religious grounds. Some politicians, generally from opposition parties, have regularly used antisemitism rhetoric in their political statements. == Jamaica == The constitution of Jamaica establishes the freedom of religion and outlaws religious discrimination. A colonial-era law criminalizing Obeah and Myal continues to exist, but has rarely been enforced since Jamaica's independence from the United Kingdom in 1962. Registration with the government is not mandatory for religious groups, but provides groups with some privileges, such as being able to own land and enter legal disputes as an organization. Groups seeking tax-exempt status must register separately as charities. The public school curriculum includes nondenominational religious education. Some public schools are run by religious institutions, but are required to hold to the same standard as other public schools. Religious private schools also operate in Jamaica. While Rastafarians were once persecuted by the government of Jamaica and routinely harassed by police looking for then-illegal cannabis, the government has since taken steps to accommodate Rastafarians, including the decriminalization of the possession of small amounts of cannabis for religious purposes in 2015, and formal apologies coupled with financial reparations for past actions against the Rastafarian community, such as the Coral Gardens incident. Rastafarians still face some societal discrimination, particularly when seeking employment, but community representatives have stated that incidences of discrimination have sharply decreased since 2015. Representatives of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim communities in Jamaica have described Jamaican society as being tolerant of religious diversity, and identified the high level of interfaith dialogue as evidence to support this claim. ==Mexico== The Constitution of Mexico and other laws establish and protect the freedom of religion in Mexico. A precedent of limiting the rights of the church \u2013 especially the Roman Catholic Church\u2013 was set by President Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas in 1833. Later, President Benito Ju\u00e1rez enacted a set of laws that came to be known as the Leyes de Reforma (or Reform laws) between 1859 and 1863 in the backdrop of the Reform War. These laws mandated, among other things, the separation of church and state, allowed for civil marriages and a civil registry, and confiscated the church's property. Tensions also existed between the Roman Catholic Church and the post-Revolution Mexican government. Severe restrictions on the rights of the Church and members of the clergy were written into the country's 1917 constitution that led to the eruption of the Cristero War in 1926. In 1992 the government reestablished diplomatic relations with the Holy See and lifted almost all restrictions on the Catholic Church. This later action included granting all religious groups legal status, conceding them limited property rights, and lifting restrictions on the number of priests in the country. However, the law continues to mandate a strict separation of church and state. The constitution still bars members of the clergy from holding public office, advocating partisan political views, supporting political candidates, or opposing the laws or institutions of the state. The constitution provides that education should avoid privileges of religion, and that one religion or its members may not be given preference in education over another. Religious instruction is prohibited in public schools; however, religious associations are free to maintain private schools, which receive no public funds. Religious groups may not own or administer broadcast radio or television stations. Government permission is required for commercial broadcast radio or television to transmit religious programming. == Nicaragua == The constitution of Nicaragua prohibits religious discrimination and establishes the freedom of religion. It declares that Nicaragua has no state religion, but it also empowers government controlled, community-level organizations called Family Committees to promote \"Christian values\" at a community level. Religious groups may register with the government through a process similar to that which is used by NGOs. Registration allows organizations to enter legal contracts and provides some tax exemptions. According to the United States International Religious Freedom Report, Nicaragua's government gives preferential treatment to religious organizations with pro-government political stances, and uses bureaucratic measures to impede the activities of religious groups that have been critical of the government. Some representatives of Christian groups have also made statements that are critical of the government's usage of Catholic rhetoric and its incorporation of Catholic traditions as government-backed celebrations. Religious education is included as part of a civics curriculum in schools. ==Panama== The Constitution of Panama provides for freedom of religion, with some qualifications, and other laws and policies contribute to the generally free practice of religion. The law at all levels protects this right in full against abuse, either by governmental or private actors. The Government generally respects religious freedom in practice. In 2007, the US government received no reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice. The Constitution dictates that Catholicism be taught in public schools; however, parents have the right to exempt their children from religious instruction. The numerical predominance of Catholicism and the consideration given to it in the Constitution generally have not prejudiced other religious groups.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Panama: International Religious Freedom Report 2008. == Saint Kitts and Nevis == The constitution of Saint Kitts and Nevis establishes the freedom of religion and prohibits discrimination.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Saint Kitts and Nevis, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Religious organizations are not required to register with the government, but doing so adds them to a database through which the government sends up to date information about policies regarding religion, and allows them to operate as charities. Public schools include Christian religious instruction and daily prayers, which are optional for students who do not wish to attend them. Religious groups are allowed to establish their own private schools. According to the Organization for Rastafarians in Unity, Rastafarians in Saint Kitts and Nevis face discrimination. Cannabis, a Rastafarian religious sacrament, is illegal in Saint Kitts and Nevis. While dreadlocks are not illegal, many private businesses do not allow their employees to wear them, and prisoners in jail are forced to have their dreadlocks shaved off. The ORU has also reported police harassment of Rastafarians and limited access to public spaces for religious purposes, as well as stating that Rastafarians face employment discrimination in the private sector. == Saint Lucia == The constitution of Saint Lucia establishes the freedom of religion, and prohibits religious instruction without consent in schools, prisons, and the military. An anti- blasphemy law remains part of the legal code of Saint Lucia but is not enforced.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Saint Lucia, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The government requires religious organizations with more than 250 members to register with the government. Upon registering, the groups can further apply for concessions such as tax breaks. Public schools include optional nondenominational religious education courses for students. Religious groups can run private schools where they are allowed to teach their religion; the government provides about 50% of the funding for these schools. There are no restrictions on foreign missionaries, although they are required to register with the government to receive a labor permit before entering the country. Rastafarians in Saint Lucia have criticized the government's prohibition of cannabis, as this discourages them from engaging in certain religious rituals. Rastafarians are also subject to police harassment in connection with cannabis. The government only began recognizing Rastafarian marriages (and thus their children's inheritance rights) in 2017. Muslims in Saint Lucia have been subjected to harassment, especially when wearing religious attire. == Saint Vincent and the Grenadines == The constitution of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines states that the country \"is founded on the belief in the supremacy of God\". It further establishes the freedom of conscience and the right to free religious practice in public or private. An anti-blasphemy law is part of the legal code but is not enforced.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Public schools include nondenominational religious curriculums based on Christianity, as well as optional Christian prayer in assemblies. Religious groups are allowed to set up their own schools. Cannabis is illegal, including for religious use. Rastafarians have criticized this law, as it impedes their ability to practice their religion. == Trinidad and Tobago == The constitution of Trinidad and Tobago establishes the freedom of religion and prohibits religious discrimination. An anti-blasphemy law is part of the legal code but is not enforced.International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Trinidad and Tobago, US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Religious groups may register with the government in order to be able to perform marriages, sponsor missionaries, or accept tax-exempt donations. Voluntary religious instruction is available as part of the public school curriculum. The government subsidizes religious private schools affiliated with Christian, Muslim, and Hindu groups. In 2017, Trinidad and Tobago set a uniform minimum marriage age of 18 years. Previously, different age limits were enforced for different religious groups. While many organizations (and particularly religiously affiliated women's organizations) welcomed this change, some religious organizations such as the orthodox Hindu organization Sanatan Dharma Maha Saba stated that they would oppose the law on the grounds that it infringes on religious freedom. The government of Trinidad and Tobago hosts the Inter-Religious Organization, an interfaith coordinating committee with representatives from 25 religious groups, including Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Orisha and Bah\u00e1'i groups. Chaplains from the various religious denominations present in Trinidad Tobago are able to provide religious services to inmates in prisons. ==United States== The principle of freedom of religion is officially protected by the US constitution. US Supreme Court rulings have re-stated and expanded upon the legal individual right of freedom of religion within the United States of America. In the 17th and 18th centuries, many Europeans emigrated to what would later become the United States. For some this was driven at least partly by the desire to worship freely in their own fashion. These included a large number of nonconformists such as the Puritans and the Pilgrims as well as English Catholics. However, with some exceptions, such as William Penn of Pennsylvania or the Roman Catholic Lord Baltimore in Maryland, most of these groups did not believe in religious toleration and in some cases came to America with the explicit aim of setting up an established religion. === Treatment of Native American religions === Despite the historical protection of the freedom of religion in the US body of law, these rights were not extended to Native Americans for much of US history. With the practice of the Americanization of Native Americans, Native American children were sent to Christian boarding schools where they were forced to worship as Christians and traditional customs were banned.Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools -Andrea Smith writing for Amnesty International Magazine on the historic government policy of forcing over 100,000 Native American children to attend Christian boarding schools, and the subsequent social reverberations of \"widespread sexual and physical abuse\" suffered at the hands of school administrators. Until the Freedom of Religion Act 1978, \"spiritual leaders [of Native Americans] ran the risk of jail sentences of up to 30 years for simply practicing their rituals.\"http://www.religioustolerance.org \u2013 Native American Spirituality The traditional indigenous Sun Dance was illegal from 1904 to the 1980s. Peyote, a hallucinogenic plant used in some Native American religious ceremonies, is illegal in the US,Kahn, Paul W. \"Putting Liberalism In Its Place.\" Princeton University Press, 2005. P. 76 and access to other items used for ceremonies, such as eagle feathers, is restricted.Stokes, DaShanne. 2007. \"Time for New Eagle Feather Law.\" Indian Country Today, February 21, pp. A2.Stokes, DaShanne. 2008. \"Eagle Feathers and the Imperialist Conquest of State Recognized Tribes.\" Indian Country Today, August 13, pp. 5. Ancestral remains and lands also have a significant role in Native American religions, and access to both the land and physical remains (many of which are being held in museums) is limited.Carrillo, Jo (1998). Readings in American Indian Law: Recalling the Rhythm of Survival Temple University Press, Philadelphia. === Treatment of Jews === In 2016, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that 54.2% of hate crimes motivated by religious bias targeted Jews.2016 Hate Crime Statistics, Federal Bureau of Investigation Cultural changes from the 1960s onward into the 21st century have caused a large shift in general attitudes such that, in recent years, most Americans surveyed express positive viewpoints regarding Jews, whereas previously antisemitism was more common in American society. An ABC News report in 2007 recounted that about 6% of Americans reported some feelings of prejudice against Jews. According to surveys by the Anti-Defamation League in 2011, antisemitism is rejected by clear majorities of Americans, with 64% of them lauding Jews' cultural contributions to the nation in 2011, but still a minority holding hateful views of Jews remain, with 19% of Americans supporting the antisemitic canard that Jews co-control Wall Street. Holocaust denial has also only been a fringe phenomenon in recent years; 96% of Americans believe the Holocaust occurred. === Treatment of Muslims === While discrimination along religious lines is officially illegal, discrimination and prejudice against Muslims is common in American society. Muslims face discrimination in the workplace, discrimination at airport security checkpoints, immigration hearings.Figueroa, Tiffani B. \"All Muslims are Like That: How Islamophobia is Diminishing Americans' Right to Receive Information.\" Hofstra L. Rev. 41 (2012): 467. Additionally, Muslims are subjected to harassment, and there have been incidents of deadly violence perpetrated against Muslims due to their religion. As a consequence of the Patriot Act, various bodies of the American government have explicitly engaged in the targeted surveillance and infiltration of Muslim communities.Pitt, Cassady . \"U.S. Patriot Act and Racial Profiling: Are There Consequences of Discrimination?\" Michigan Sociological Review 25:53-69. Accessed September 26, 2017. JSTOR. Keyword: Patriot Act. Studies have noted that Muslims are disproportionately negatively portrayed as violent in American media.Media Tenor International. 2011. A New Era for Arab-Western Relations \u2013 Media analysis. New York: Media Tenor. === Treatment of atheists === In the United States, seven state constitutions include religious tests that would effectively prevent atheists from holding public office, and in some cases being a juror/witness, though these have not generally been enforced since the early twentieth century. As of 2013 there were no publicly atheist legislators in the federal government, although Pete Stark had previously held office in Congress as a public atheist, and it is alleged that several other legislators are atheists but keep their religious beliefs private. Few politicians have been willing to acknowledge their lack of belief in supreme beings, since such revelations have been considered \"political suicide\". A 2015 Gallup survey found that 40% of Americans would not vote an atheist for president, and in polls prior to 2015, that number had reached about 50%. ==References== Category:Religion in North America Category:Religion and politics Category:Irreligion North America Category:Human rights in North America ",
