    "text": "Dastg\u0101h () is a musical modal system in traditional Persian art music. Persian music consists of a number of principal musical modal systems or ; in spite of 50 or more extant , theorists generally refer to a set of twelve principal ones. A is a melody type that a performer uses as the basis of an improvised piece. == Summary == Each consists of seven basic notes, plus several variable notes used for ornamentation and modulation. Each is a certain modal variety subject to a course of development () that is determined by the pre- established order of sequences, and revolves around 365 central nuclear melodies known as (each of these melodies being a ), which musicians come to know through experience and absorption. This process of centonization is personal, and it is a tradition of great subtlety and depth. The full collection of in all is referred to as the radif. During the meeting of The Inter-governmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Heritage of the United Nations, held between 28 September - 2 October 2009 in Abu Dhabi, radifs were officially registered on the UNESCO List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.The Radif of Iranian music: Inscribed in 2009 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, UNESCO.Noruz and Iranian radifs registered on UNESCO list, Tehran Times, 1 October 2009, .Persian music, Nowruz make it into UN heritage list, Press TV, 1 October 2009, .Nowruz became international, in Persian, BBC Persian, Wednesday, 30 September 2009, . The system has been a major influence in the maqam system in the Arabic music, both of which are deeply rooted in the Sassanid Persia's melodies, which entered into the Islamic world following the Arab conquest of Iran in the 7th century. The system of twelve and has remained nearly the same as it was codified by the music masters of the nineteenth century, in particular M\u00eerz\u0101 Abdoll\u0101h Far\u0101h\u0101ni (1843\u20131918). No new or large has been devised since that codification. When in the modern times an \u0101v\u0101z or a has been developed, it has almost always been through borrowings from the extant and , rather than through unqualified invention. From this remarkable stability one may infer that the system must have achieved \"canonical\" status in Iran. == Terminology == The term has often been compared to the musical mode in Western musicology, but this is inaccurate. A is usually the name of the initial mode of a piece, which the music returns to\u2014and moreover, a identifies a group of modes grouped according to tradition. In short, a is both the collective title of a grouping of modes and the initial mode of each group. According to musicians themselves, the etymology of the term is associated with \"the position () of the hand () [on the neck of the instrument]\". The Persian term can be translated as \"system\", and is then \"first and foremost a collection of discrete and heterogeneous elements organized into a hierarchy that is entirely coherent though nevertheless flexible.\" In conventional classifications of Persian music, Ab\u016b \u02bfA\u1e6d\u0101, Da\u0161t\u012b, Af\u0161\u0101r\u012b, and Bay\u0101t-e Tork are considered sub-classes of \u0160ur . Likewise, Bay\u0101t-e Esfah\u0101n is a sub-class of Hom\u0101yun, reducing the number of principal to a total of seven. A sub-class in the conventional system is referred to as . === Distinguished pitches === Koron (quarter flat) sign. A is more than a set of notes, and one component of the additional structure making up each is which pitches are singled out for various musical functions. Examples include: * Finalis, so named because it usually functions as the goal or destination tone that melodic cadences end on when they have a conclusory feel. This is also sometimes referred to as \"tonic\" but some authors avoid that usage because \"tonic\" is associated with Western tonality. * \u0100q\u0101z, meaning \"beginning\", the pitch on which an improvisation in a usually begins. In some it is different from the finalis while in others it is the same pitch. * Ist (\"stop\"), a pitch other than the finalis which often serves as the ending note for phrases other than final cadences. * \u0160\u0101hed (\"witness\"), a particularly prominent pitch. * Moteqayyer (\"changeable\"), a variable note \u2013 one that consistently appears as two distinct pitches, which can be used alternately in different contexts or at the performer's discretion. ==The Seven Dastgahs== See also: Koron (music) for information about Persian quarter tones. Chahargah Homayoun Mahur (the same notes as the western Ionian mode or Major Scale. Segah Dashti Most scholars divide the traditional Persian art music to seven , although some divide them into 12 (by counting Abu Ata, Dashti, Afshari, Bayat-e Kord and Bayat-e Esfahan as separate rather than subcategories of other ). Those who categorize the traditional Persian art music into seven often also list seven (, which means songs) in conjunction with these . The following is a list of the seven and seven : ===List of common Dastgah and Avaz=== Listed in order as per the Radif of Mirza Abdollah.
