He then was a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome from 1936 to 1938. He first taught at Hunter College (part of the City University of New York) from 1940 to 1941, and then at the University of Richmond from 1941 to 1943. During World War II, he served as an officer in the US Naval Reserve. After training in the Japanese language and cryptography, he rose to the rank of Lieutenant Commander and served in the Pacific Theater with the Seventh Fleet. After the end of World War II, he returned to the University of Richmond where he earned tenure. He then joined the History Department at Clarion State College (now Clarion University) in 1967 as a full professor and taught there until his retirement in 1978. Snyder's work focused on problems of chronology in Roman imperial history. He co-published a study of the papyrus from Dura-Europos known as the Feriale Duranum (with Robert O. Fink & Allan S. Hoey) with Yale University Press in 1940. In the same volume, he also published a study of Public Anniversaries in the Roman Empire. Additionally, he published an array of articles in leading journals on topics of historiography in Cassius Dio as well as on the Alexandrian Calendar. He was an esoteric (and extemporaneous) classroom lecturer who established the ancient history curriculum at Clarion University. ==Selected publications== *Walter F. Snyder, R.O. Fink, and Allan S.
