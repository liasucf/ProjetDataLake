    "text": "Sonnet 39 is one of 154 sonnets written by the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. ==Structure== Sonnet 39 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, composed of three quatrains and a final rhyming couplet for a total of fourteen lines. It follows the rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. It is written in iambic pentameter, a metre based on five pairs of syllables accented weak/strong. The second line is one example of a line of regular iambic pentameter: \u00d7 / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / O, how thy worth with manners may I sing :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = nonictus. The fifth line can be scanned with an initial reversal: / \u00d7 \u00d7 / x / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / Even for this, let us divided live, (39.5) ==Themes== Sonnet 39 continues with sonnets 35\u201337 the theme of the poet and the young man being united in love as one person and the suggestion of being separated (twain): \u201cHow can I praise you properly when we are so combined? I would be praising, in a sense, myself.\u201d The poet suggests that a separation will help him praise the young man while thinking of his admirable aspects in absence. Beginning with line 9 the poet addresses not the youth, but \u201cabsence\u201d: \u201cOh absence, you would be torment, except that you provide a pleasant opportunity to think on love, and, absence, you teach one to be not solitary but to be two, by praising the young man where I am, though he continues to be elsewhere (hence).\u201dShakespeare, William.
