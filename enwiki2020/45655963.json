    "text": "The 2017 Women's Cricket World Cup was an international women's cricket tournament that took place in England from 24 June to 23 July 2017. It was the eleventh edition of the Women's Cricket World Cup, and the third to be held in England (after the 1973 and 1993 tournaments). The 2017 World Cup was the first in which all participating players were fully professional. Eight teams qualified to participate in the tournament. England won the final against India at Lord's on 23 July by 9 runs. ==Qualification== The 2014\u201316 ICC Women's Championship, featuring the top eight ranked teams in women's cricket, was the first phase of qualifying for the World Cup, with the top four teams qualifying automatically. The remaining four places were decided at the 2017 World Cup Qualifier, a ten-team event that was held in Sri Lanka in February 2017. This featured the bottom four teams from the ICC Women's Championship and six other teams. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Team !

This format was last used in the 2005 tournament. The top four sides following the conclusion of the league matches progressed to the semi-finals with the winners meeting at Lord's on 23 July. Therefore, a total of 31 matches were played during the 28-day tournament. The full fixtures for the tournament were announced by the ICC on 8 March 2017, to coincide with International Women's Day. Ahead of the group stage fixtures there were eight practice matches, played between 19 and 22 June 2017. Teams tied on equal points in the group stage of the tournament were decided by number of wins, followed by net run rate. If both of those were still the same, then the head-to-head match between the two sides was used to determine who progresses to the semi-finals. ===Round 1=== \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Round 2=== \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Round 3=== \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Round 4=== \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Round 5=== \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Round 6=== \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Round 7=== \\---- \\---- \\---- ==Knockout stage== ===Semi- finals=== \\---- ===Final=== It was announced on 8 February 2016 that Lord's would host the Final on 23 July 2017. ==Broadcast== In May 2017, the ICC announced that 10 games would be shown live on television, while the remaining 21 matches would be streamed live via the ICC website.
