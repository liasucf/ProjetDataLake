In 1914 the family returned to Frankfurt am Main for a holiday. They were interned on the outbreak of World War I.

Jacobson and his mother subsequently moved to London where he attended Strand School and studied journalism at King's College London. He started out on local newspapers but by 1934 was assistant editor of The Statesman newspaper in Calcutta. On his return to England he became assistant editor of the pocket-sized literary and humour magazine Lilliput (magazine) in October 1937. == Wartime years == During World War II Jacobson served with the Middlesex Regiment (Duke of Cambridge's Own) and rose to the rank of major. He was awarded the Military Cross in 1944 in recognition of his exemplary gallantry. == Journalism == Metal printing plate from the election-issue Daily Mirror of 10 October 1974 After the war he returned to journalism and worked as a feature writer on the pioneering photojournalistic magazine Picture Post under its influential editor Tom Hopkinson.

By 1974 Jacobson was deputy chairman of IPC working under his friend and colleague of many years Hugh Cudlipp. During one of the two General Elections that year Jacobson was responsible for at least two of the Daily Mirror 's best-known front pages - one bore nothing but a photograph of the then Prime Minister Edward Heath and the words, \"AND NOW HE HAS THE NERVE TO ASK FOR A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE.\" The other read, \"FOR ALL OUR TOMORROWS VOTE LABOUR TODAY.\" == Latter years == On 16 July 1975, Jacobson was made a life peer as Baron Jacobson of St Albans in the County of Hertfordshire.

He was survived by his wife, June, their daughter Ruth and sons Colin and Philip, also a journalist.
