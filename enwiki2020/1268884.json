    "text": "The cluster of rocks that is Barrett Reef (often known as Barrett's Reef) is one of the most hazardous reefs in New Zealand. It lies on the western side of the entrance of Wellington Harbour, on the approaches to the city of Wellington, at coordinates . The reef is named after Richard (Dicky) Barrett (1807\u20131847), a whaler and trader. Its Maori name is Tangihanga-a-Kupe. It is popular with recreational divers. ==Dangerous entrance== Wellington Harbour entrance showing Barrett Reef The reef, much of which is exposed even at high tide, is located to the west of the two-kilometre-wide channel that links Cook Strait with Wellington Harbour, close to the shore of the Miramar Peninsula. Due to the channelling effect of Cook Strait, which lies between the Pacific Ocean and the Tasman Sea, the currents are strong and fickle and gales are common. Add to this the volume of traffic which uses the channel (including several crossings daily of the inter-island ferries to Picton), and it is not surprising that the reef has a lengthy roll-call of shipwrecks. ===History of vessels damaged, stranded, or wrecked on Barrett Reef=== * 1848 Sobraon, barque, bound for Sydney on Barrett's Reef.
