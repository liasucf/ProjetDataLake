At the 1992 Summer Olympics he entered the 5000 metres but he did not finish the race, so did not progress to the final. Four year later at the 1996 Summer Olympics in the 5000 metres he finished 11th in his heat but it still was not good enough to qualify for the next round. ==References== Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Mauritanian male long-distance runners Category:Olympic athletes of Mauritania Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1996 Summer Olympics ",
