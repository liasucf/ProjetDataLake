    "text": "The 2018 Cotton Bowl Classic was a college football bowl game played on December 29, 2018, at AT&T; Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The 83rd Cotton Bowl Classic was a College Football Playoff semifinal with the winner to compete in the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship. It was one of the 2018\u201319 bowl games concluding the 2018 FBS football season. Sponsored by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, the game was officially known as the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic. ==Teams== The game featured second-ranked Clemson of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) against third-ranked Notre Dame, an FBS independent. This was the first time that the two programs met in a bowl game; their more recent regular season meeting had been in 2015, won by Clemson. The only prior Cotton Bowl to feature two undefeated teams had been the 1948 edition, which ended in a 13\u201313 tie between Penn State and SMU. ===Clemson Tigers=== Clemson defeated Pitt in the 2018 ACC Championship Game on December 1, then received their bid to the Cotton Bowl with the release of final CFP rankings on December 2. The Tigers entered the bowl with a 13\u20130 record (8\u20130 in conference). On December 27, it was confirmed that three Clemson players, including starting defensive lineman Dexter Lawrence, would be suspended from playing in the game by the NCAA, due to drug testing showing \"trace amounts of a banned substance\", which was identified as ostarine. This was Clemson's second Cotton Bowl bid in school history, following its appearance in the 1940 edition. It was also the first Cotton Bowl appearance by an active ACC member since Maryland's appearance in the 1977 edition. ===Notre Dame Fighting Irish=== Notre Dame received their bid to the Cotton Bowl with the release of final CFP rankings on December 2. The independent Fighting Irish entered the bowl with a 12\u20130 record. This was Notre Dame's first Cotton Bowl berth since the 1994 edition and its eighth overall. ==Game summary== ===Scoring summary=== ===Statistics=== ==References== ==External links== * *Box score at ESPN Cotton Bowl Classic Category:2018\u201319 College Football Playoff Category:Cotton Bowl Classic Cotton Bowl Classic Category:21st century in Arlington, Texas Cotton Bowl Classic Category:Clemson Tigers football bowl games Category:Notre Dame Fighting Irish football bowl games ",
