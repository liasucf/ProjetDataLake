    "text": "The Leticia Incident, also called the Leticia War or the Colombia\u2013Peru War (1 September 1932 \u2013 24 May 1933), was a short-lived armed conflict between Colombia and Peru over territory in the Amazon rainforest. In the end, they reached an agreement to divide the disputed area between them. ==Background== ===Civilian takeover=== The Colombia\u2013Peru War was the result of dissatisfaction with the Salom\u00f3n-Lozano Treaty and the imposition of heavy tariffs on sugar. The war started with an internal insurrection in Peru and a civilian takeover of the city of Iquitos. On 1 September 1932, President Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez dispatched two regiments of the Peruvian Army to Leticia and Tarapac\u00e1; both settlements were in the Amazonas Department, now in southern Colombia. Those actions were then mostly ignored by the Colombian government. ===Colombian patriotism=== It was not until 17 September that the Colombian government took notice. The Peruvian forces, which were encamped on the banks of the Putumayo River, stopped several large trade ships from traveling to Leticia. The result was an explosion of Colombian patriotism. Laureano G\u00f3mez, the head of the Senate minority, proclaimed, \"Peace, peace, peace in inner Colombia; war, war, war on the border against our despicable enemy.\" On 19 September, El Tiempo reported that it had received over 10,000 letters calling for war and control of Leticia. The same day, thousands of Colombian students marched through the streets of Bogot\u00e1 chanting, \"S\u00e1nchez Cerro will die and Colombia will defy!\" V\u00e1squez Cobo was declared the general of the Colombian Amazonian Navy, and 10 million dollars were approved by the Senate to fund his venture. Over 400 kg of gold were donated by the Colombian cities as a symbol of gratitude to the Huilan engineer C\u00e9sar Garc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez. War Memorial in Tarapac\u00e1, Colombia. The plaque reads, \"To the Heroes of the Colombian Air Force; who with true courage gave the best of themselves; flying with their noble aircraft over river and jungle. Declaring over our Amazonia with the sound of their motors the sovereignty of our country during the war with Peru.\" ==Hostilities== S\u00e1nchez believed that Colombia had no chance of defending itself since it lacked roads and a proper navy, and the Amazon region had no Colombian military presence. It was not until December 1932 that General Alfredo V\u00e1squez Cobo reached the mouth of the Amazon River with a fleet of old ships that he acquired in Europe. Within 90 days, Colombia organised a respectable military response to the Peruvian invasion. Herbert Boy and other German aviators of SCADTA, which later became Avianca, fitted their commercial planes for war as a temporary Colombian Air Force. The first attack by the Colombian Navy was on Tarapac\u00e1. The city was chosen because Leticia was on the border with Brazil, and the Colombian Forces preferred to attack a softer target rather than the well-defended Peruvian positions in and around the city. The retaking of Tarapac\u00e1 was bloodless due to the fact that once the Colombian troops disembarked, the Peruvians fled the place abandoning their meager supplies, which included weapons stationed for defense, and to old cannons. The garrison was in terrible condition; letters and notes left by the soldiers attested to the despair in which they were due to the weather and the lack of food. Demoralized, without air defense, faced with the threat of bombers from the Colombian Air Force, the commander of the plaza ordered the withdrawal. In the Colombian ranks there was not a single casualty. The only skirmish took place at the site called Buenos Aires, when a picket of Colombian soldiers ran into a company of Peruvian troops who also left the area and force marched towards Leticia. On March 26, 1933, the Colombian Army attacked the Peruvian base at Guepi. The attack took by surprise the ill- prepared Peruvian troops who were unable to resist the attack. After prolonged combat in which the commander of the garrison withdrew from the zone, the Colombians claimed the position. There were 27 dead, 14 wounded and 24 prisoners. The Colombian ranks had 16 casualties and 13 wounded. The persecution in the jungle had to be suspended the next day due to the fatigue of the troops and the lack of proper marching rations. The advance on Iquitos seemed difficult, given the resistance that was predicted on the road to Iquitos and the state of the Colombian troops that already accused the rigor of the jungle, while a longer delay could benefit the sending of more reinforcements to Putumayo. This discussion was settled by a decision of the League of Nations that ordered a cease-fire at a time when, in any case, the military advance Colombian seemed to have favorable points: a Peruvian company composed of 93 men under the command of Captain Manuel Balderrago, surrendered without fire a single shot before a small scouting party with a dozen soldiers who worked in the vicinity of the G\u00fcep\u00ed-Pantoja trail under the orders from Captain Pompilio Duarte and Second Lieutenant Guillermo Aldana. Intimidated by the Colombian picket, the Peruvians handed over 58 rifles, 3 machine guns and their ammunition. After doubts and consultations, Benavides agreed to evacuate the port of Leticia and hand over its administration to the League of Nations. An armistice interrupted the war and the way was opened to diplomacy. The end took place in Rio de Janeiro. The Colombian negotiating commission, composed of Roberto Urdaneta, Guillermo Valencia and Luis Cano, signed the agreement through which Leticia was recovered on June 19, 1934. On 14 February 1933, the Peruvian Air Force had attempted to bomb the Colombian Fleet, but most bombs had missed their targets.von Rauch 1984, p.6 The Peruvian forces in Leticia could not be forced to withdraw, but the events in Lima and the assassination of the Peruvian president changed the situation. The new Peruvian president ordered the undefeated Peruvian troops to leave Leticia. Part of Peru's Pacific fleet came through the Amazon River to engage in combat. ==Rio de Janeiro Protocol== On the same day, Colombian President Enrique Olaya broke off all relations with Peru because of the aerial attack. He ordered an attack on Leticia, but it was repelled by Peruvian troops. On 30 April 1933, Peruvian President S\u00e1nchez was shot dead; 15 days later, his successor, \u00d3scar Benavides, met with the head of the Colombian Liberal Party, Alfonso L\u00f3pez Pumarejo, to secure an agreement to turn Leticia over to a League of Nations commission. Colombia and Peru met in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to sign a peace treaty. In the Rio de Janeiro Protocol, Peru stated, \"We sincerely deplore the events that occurred starting September, 1932. Specifically those that damaged our relationship with Colombia.\" The Salom\u00f3n-Lozano Treaty was also reaffirmed by the treaty. ==References== *von Rauch, Herbert. \"A South American Air War...The Letcia Conflict.\" Air Enthusiast.
