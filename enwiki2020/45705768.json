    "text": "Greg Edwards (born 24 December 1947) is a radio broadcaster and DJ. He is well known as the founder of Capital Radio's 'Soul Spectrum' programme (from 1975 onwards) and for the promotion of PIR records and associated artists when it was formed in 1971. ==Early career== Edwards was born in Grenada and raised in New York City although he moved to the UK in 1971 in order to assist in the running of the newly formed Philadelphia International record label which was founded by writer-producers Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff. He worked as an Executive at CBS records during this time, where he was responsible for the marketing and promotion of soul music, with acts such Earth, Wind and Fire, Lou Rawls and Johnny Nash. ==BBC and Capital Radio== Whilst still working for CBS, Edwards was approached by BBC radio producer Dave Price to stand in for the Emperor Rosko radio show in 1972. (Rosko had to return to Los Angeles, as his father Joe Pasternak was ill). It is here that Edward's radio career began, working for BBC Radio 1 on the Saturday noon3pm slot. It was Edwards' intention to promote soul and jazz music which had very little UK airplay at that time. He also presented three editions of the long-running music show Top of the Pops, during March and April 1974. However, he decided to leave the BBC and work for the new Independent Radio Station set up in October 1973, called Capital Radio. It was at Capital Radio that Edwards worked alongside DJs such as the late Kenny Everett, Dave Cash (disc jockey) and Chris Tarrant. Edwards was well known for promoting record labels on his station. He once said, \"Buy anything that is issued on the Prelude label\". The station even issued a 'soul spectrum playlist' each Saturday which was available from the station, located in Euston Tower, London. ==Lyceum Ballroom - \"The Best Disco in Town\"== From the late 1970s through to the early 1980s, Edwards was one of a rotation of DJs to present Capital Radio\u2019s \u201cBest Disco in Town\u201d, each Friday night, from the Lyceum Ballroom in the Strand, London. The event was also broadcast live, from 11pm to midnight. ==Later years - DJ work== He has been a guest DJ at the Caister Soul Weekender events held twice each year. ==Current work== Edwards works as a DJ, travelling to venues around the UK on a regular basis. He also has a show on internet station \"Mi Soul\" on Sundays from 1pm to 3pm, called 'Soul Spectrum'. He has lived in Hampshire since 1995. His hobbies include gardening, architecture, history and ten-pin bowling. == References == * Mi- Soul Radio Presenter Profiles Greg Edwards * UK Community Eye TV interviews Greg Edwards by Natalie Taylor * George Kay interviews Greg Edwards at Mi-Soul Radio Category:Living people Category:1947 births Category:BBC Radio 1 presenters ",
