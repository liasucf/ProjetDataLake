It has since enjoyed critically acclaimed runs off-West End in London, again off-Broadway in New York, and at theatres around the United States. The Los Angeles Times writes that in The Lion, \"the vibe of casual, unrehearsed immediacy masks the narrative complexity of a novel or an opera.\" In 2015 Scheuer and The Lion won the 2015 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance. In 2015 the Huffington Post called The Lion \"the best new musical this year\" The show's first version, called The Bridge, ran in the 2013 Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Scheuer has given more than 500 performances THE LION at theatres including DC's Arena Stage, San Francisco's ACT, Portland Center Stage in Oregon, The Williamstown Theatre Festival, and San Diego's The Old Globe. Scheuer gave the final performance of THE LION at The Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles on February 19, 2017. In 2007 Jihad! The Musical, for which Scheuer wrote the music and lyrics, was performed at the Edinburgh Fringe, and in 2010 it transferred to Jermyn Street Theatre in London.

The video, according to the NYTimes, \"depicts the chemicals striking like lightning, as if to shock the body or map it with bombed roadways, tracking a jagged terrain. The speed of the tattooing brings to mind the words \u201cinvasive\u201d and \u201csystemic.\u201d We are looking at a representation of cancer treatment, but the video evokes terror at the disease\u2019s malevolent capacity to spread quickly.\" Baynton's four videos have featured at various international animation and children's film festivals, and have won awards at the Annecy Film Festival, The British Animation Awards, The Crystal Palace Festival, and the Encounters Film Festival. === Music Releases === \"I Am Samantha\" was released, alongside a music video, on March 31 2020 by Atlantic Records.https://lgbtqmusicchart.uk/2020/04/14/benjamin-scheuer-i-am-samantha/ Scheuer wrote the song for a transgender friend of his.
