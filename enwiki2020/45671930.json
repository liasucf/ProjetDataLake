    "text": "Implantation bleeding is the idea that a small amount of vaginal bleeding can occur in early pregnancy due to the fertilized egg attaching to the inside of the uterus. However, there is no support for the notion that implantation produces vaginal bleeding. Bleeding and spotting are common during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle as well as during early pregnancy, and for reasons unrelated to implantation. ==References== Category:Human pregnancy Category:Obstetrics ",
