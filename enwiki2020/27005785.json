    "text": "Cumbernauld (; http://theses.gla.ac.uk/5270/1/2014DrummondPhD.pdf#233 Peter Drummond PhD 2004 pg 233 ; ) is a large town in North Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is the ninth most-populous locality in Scotland and the most populated town in north Lanarkshire, positioned in the centre of Scotland's Central Belt. Geographically, Cumbernauld sits between east and west, being on the Scottish watershed between the Forth and the Clyde; however, it is culturally far more weighted towards Glasgow and the New Town's planners thought to fill 80% of its houses from Scotland's largest city to reduce housing pressure there. Cumbernauld was marked by the Romans in antiquity. Traces of this are still visible today for example at Westerwood and, less conspicuously, north of the M80 where the legionaries surfaced what would later be called the Auld Cley Road. This is acknowledged in Cumbernauld Community Park, also site of Scotland's only visible open-air Roman altar, in the shadow of the imposing Carrickstone Water Tower. For many years Cumbernauld was chiefly populated around what is now called The Village with the medieval castle a short walk away surrounded by its own park grounds. The castle frequently hosted visiting royalty and the grounds were famous for their white cattle which were hunted in the oak forest. The town began to spread as the weaving industry of the village was supplemented by mining and quarrying as travel across Scotland became easier due to the Forth and Clyde Canal and the railways being constructed. Cumbernauld railway station, though some distance from the village, improved communications with Glasgow, Falkirk and Stirling. Cumbernauld was designated as the site for a New Town on 9 December 1955. This led to rapid expansion and building for about 40 years until the town became established as the largest in North Lanarkshire. At the UK census in 2011, the population of Cumbernauld was approximately 52,000, housed in more than a dozen residential areas. Cumbernauld's economy is a mixture of some manufacturing, mainly on its industrial estates, as well as service industries in the Town Centre and in sites close to the M80. ==History== ===Early history=== Forts and Fortlets associated with the Antonine Wall from west to east: Bishopton, Old Kilpatrick, Duntocher, Cleddans, Castlehill, Bearsden, Summerston, Balmuildy, Wilderness Plantation, Cadder, Glasgow Bridge, Kirkintilloch, Auchendavy, Bar Hill, Croy Hill, Westerwood, Castlecary, Seabegs, Rough Castle, Camelon, Watling Lodge, Falkirk, Mumrills, Inveravon, Kinneil, Carriden Roman propaganda on a distance slab? Subdued native as depicted on Roman engraving. This sandstone slab was found at Arniebog Farm, Westerwood in 1868 It has been scanned and a video produced. Cumbernauld's history stretches at least to Roman times, as Westerwood was a Roman fort on the Antonine Wall, the furthest and most northerly boundary of the Roman Empire. Two Roman temporary camps have been discovered and digitally reconstructed east of the fort, at Tollpark (now covered by Wardpark North) and at Garnhall, similar to the two at Dullatur. One of the most discussed Roman finds from Cumbernauld is a sandstone slab depicting Triton and a naked, kneeling captive. It was found on a farm at Arniebog (between the runway of Cumbernauld Airport and Westerwood Golf Course). The slab can now be viewed at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow along with an uninscribed altar from Arniebog and other artefacts like the inscribed altar, and statuette found at Castlecary and an older copy of the Bridgeness Slab. In addition to these, an altarstone to Silvanus and the Sky dedicated by a centurion named Verecundus and his wife has been found. Cumbernauld also has the only Roman altar still in the open air in Scotland: the Carrick Stone. The stone has also been linked with Robert Bruce, being the place where he reportedly set up his standard on his way to Bannockburn. There is some evidence that coffins were laid on top of the stone on their way to the cemetery in Kirkintilloch and that the stone has been somewhat worn away. Cumbernauld's name probably comes from the Gaelic comar nan allt, meaning \"meeting of the burns or streams\". There are differing views as to the etymology of this. One theory is that from its high point in the Central Belt, its streams flow both west to the River Clyde and east to the Firth of Forth so Cumbernauld's name is about it being on a watershed. Another theory ascribes the name to the meeting point of the Red Burn and Bog Stank streams within Cumbernauld Glen. 'Cumbernauld' is generally considered to be a Gaelic name. However, early forms containing Cumyr- hint at a Cumbric predecessor derived from *c\u00f6mber, 'confluence' (c.f Welsh cymer, 'confluence'), synonymous with Aber. This seems to be suffixed with Cumbric *-\u00efn-alt, a topographical suffix perhaps referring to a hill or slope (Welsh yn allt, 'at a hill').

Retrieved July 2016 The Flemings took possession of Cumbernauld Castle and its estate (1306) after Robert the Bruce murdered the Red Comyn. Robert Fleming was a staunch supporter of Bruce, and one of his companions that day. To provide proof that Comyn was dead, Fleming cut off his head in order to \"let the deed shaw\", a Fleming family motto ever since.https://flemish.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/2014/05/19/the-flemings-of- cumbernauld-castle/ The Fleming Family and the Castle On 1 October 1310 Robert the Bruce wrote to Edward II of England from Kildrum trying, unsuccessfully, to establish peace between Scotland and England. Abercromby describes Malcolm Fleming as returning home to Inverbervie with the formerly exiled 21-year-old King David II. Around 1371, the family built a second castle where the Cumbernauld House now stands.flemish.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/2014/05/19/the- flemings-of-cumbernauld-castle St. Andrews conference \u2013 The Fleming Family and the Castle One castle wall exists but most of the stonework was recycled for the House or other buildings. King Robert III knighted Malcolm and granted Sir Malcolm Fleming and his heirs the charter to Cumbernauld Castle on 2 April 1406, just two days before the king's death.https://archive.org/stream/kirkintillochtow00wats#page/14/mode/2up Kirkintilloch, Town and Parish pg 15 Malcolm (and his heir in 1427) were used as hostages to ransom James I back from the English. He also seems to have been arrested by James and imprisoned briefly in Dalkeith Castle. In 1440, this Malcolm Fleming attended the Black Dinner along with his 16-year-old friend Earl William Douglas and his 11-year-old brother David Douglas at Edinburgh Castle. Immediately after the dinner, at which a black bull's head was served, there was a trial on trumped-up charges and the brothers were beheaded in front of the 10-year-old King James II. Malcolm shared their fate three days later. Malcolm was succeeded by his son Robert. \u2620 Skull & Crossbones Headstone in Old Parish cemetery from 1654. The oldest local engraving is from 1625.

James IV (1473\u20131513) wooed Margaret Drummond at Cumbernauld Castle, where Margaret's sister was married to Lord Fleming. The Drummond sisters lie buried in Dunblane Cathedral following their poisoning, possibly by a government determined to marry an unwilling King James to the sister of Henry VIII of England, Margaret Tudor. The murders made James IV a frequent visitor to Cumbernauld, Margaret Tudor accompanying him on one occasion. It is recorded that during this James' reign in 1500, the Black Death led to a special plea from the surviving people of Cumbernauld to the church authorities in Glasgow to allow them to establish their own cemetery rather than taking all their dead to St. Ninian's in Kirkintilloch.Dane Love, 1989, Scottish Kirkyards. pg 90-9 quoted in \"Excavations at 3\u201311 Main Street, Cumbernauld\" pdf They were granted permission to do so, and used the ground at the existing Comyns' chapel which dates from the end of the 12th century. ===Post Reformation history=== Cumbernauld House and Grounds James V is recorded as staying for a couple of days at the castle around 14 December 1529. In November 1542, Malcolm Fleming, Lord Chamberlain of Scotland to King James V, was taken prisoner by the English at the Battle of Solway Moss, but released at a ransom of 1,000 marks, paid on 1 July 1548. Mary, Queen of Scots visited the castle and reportedly planted a sweet chestnut tree in the grounds in 1561; she's also said to have planted a yew tree at Castlecary Castle, only a mile or two away, which still grows there. The whole great hall collapsed while the queen was staying at Commernalde on 26 January 1562, and 7 or 8 men were killed. Most of the queen's party were out hunting. Mary was not hurt and visited the relatives of those who were injured or killed in the village below.http://www.derelictplaces.co.uk/main/residential- sites/10294-cumbernauld-house-april-2009-a.html#.V5o72aJGQ6o Historic Timeline Royalty often visited the town to hunt the rare Scottish ox, or white cattle, which roamed in the woods around Cumbernauld. These woods were a surviving fragment of the ancient Caledonian Forest, in which the oxen abounded at least till 1571 and probably until the building of the new house. Many of these were deliberately killed by Regent Lennox's men and a plaintiff complains: \"And amonges others greite enormyties perpetrated be th' erles men of werre they have slayne and destroyed the dere in John Fleming's forest of Cummernald and the quhit ky and bullis, to the gryt destructione of polecie and hinder of the commonweil.

He was staying there during the Shotts Revival on Monday 21 June 1630 when he preached and 500 people in one day had \"a discernible change wrought upon them.\" In 1640, eighteen Scottish noblemen met at Cumbernauld to sign the Cumbernauld Bond to oppose the policies of the Earl of Argyll who controlled the dominant political faction in Scotland. Cumbernauld may have been created a Burgh of barony in 1649, although there is some dispute from Hugo Millar. The Earl of Wigton was ordered to garrison the castle in 1650.https://archive.org/stream/royallettersinst00mait#page/130/mode/1up Wigton papers pg 130 Cumbernauld Castle was besieged and largely destroyed by Cromwell's General Monck in 1651. Irvine records that the old castle was burned to the ground by \"a party of Highlanders during the rebellion of 1715.\"https://archive.org/stream/bookdumbartonsh04irvigoog#page/n442/mode/1up The Book of Dunbartonshire pg 397 Sundial from 1725 Cumbernauld House Cumbernauld House, which still survives, was designed by William Adam and built in 1731 near the older castle. In 1746, the retreating Jacobite army was billeted for a nighthttp://www.rbwf.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1963.pdf Kirkintilloch, Town and Parish pg188 in Cumbernauld village. Rather than stay in Cumbernauld House, the commander, Lord George Murray, slept in the village's Black Bull Inn, where he could enforce closer discipline on his soldiers. After the new house was built, the castle was converted to stables, but was accidentally burnt down by dragoons posted there in 1746. The House's grounds, located in the Glen, are used today as a park, known as Cumbernauld Park. ===Post-Industrial Revolution=== Cumbernauld fire-clay works Workers laboured on about 40\u201350 farms and details from 1839 have been recorded for both arable and livestock farming. Some of them were said to make a \"very considerable income\" for their owners.https://archive.org/stream/newstatisticalac08edin#page/n176/mode/1up Farming Stats 1839 Weaving was an important part of the town's industry particularly during the Industrial Revolution. Irvine records that in 1841 a fifth of the whole population of 4501 people worked on about 600 hand looms.https://archive.org/stream/bookdumbartonsh04irvigoog#page/n443/mode/1up The Book of Dunbartonshire pg 398 Cotton weaving was not a lucrative profession; in fact cottage workers struggled to make ends meet especially when competing with ongoing industrialisation.https://archive.org/stream/newstatisticalac08edin#page/n175/mode/1up Weavers' Pay In October 1878, this was compounded by the failure of the Bank of Glasgow in which much of the village's money was invested. Many lowland workers migrated and Groome's Gazetteer 1896 records a dwindling population and states \"Handloom weaving of checks and other striped fabrics is still carried on, but mining and quarrying are the staple industry.\"http://www.gazetteerofscotland.org.uk/ Groome's \u2013 search for Cumbernauld There tended to be plenty of work but even for skilled labourers like the nearby Calton weavers, times were very hard. Entrance to disused fireclay mine at Glencryan The mining and quarrying industries flourished after the completion of the Forth and Clyde Canal in 1790. Quarrying of limestone, coalhttps://archive.org/stream/newstatisticalac08edin#page/n203/mode/1up coal mine at Holland Hirst pg 176 Map: http://maps.nls.uk/view/74400286 and clay took place in Cumbernauld, for example at Glencryan, where adits to the old fireclay mines are still clearly visible. Groome's Gazetteer (1882\u201386) states: \"A colliery is at Netherwood [just north of the airporthttp://cameron.dinastee.me.uk/Netherwood.php Netherwood near airport and Antonine Wall]; ironstone has been mined to a small extent by the Carron Company [at Westerwood farmhttps://archive.org/stream/newstatisticalac08edin#page/n163/mode/1up iron mine Westerwood]; and limestone, brick-clay, sandstone, and trap are all of them largely worked, the sandstone for building, the trap for road-metal, paving, and rough masonry.\" The mine at Netherwood was hand-pumped, although other mines in Cumbernauld had machine pumps to clear them of water.https://archive.org/stream/newstatisticalac08edin#page/n163/mode/1up mining pumps pg 136 There was a fire clay works at Cumbernauld owned by the Glenboig Union Fireclay Company Limited. Cumbernauld railway station was built by the Caledonian Railway and opened in August 1848 on their line from Gartsherrie (on the former Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway) to Greenhill on the Scottish Central Railway. It closed within a year but re-opened in the 1870s. Parish records give a snapshot of heads of family's occupations in 1835 and 1839 including several bakers, servants, shoemakers and wrights.http://www.oldscottish.com/cumbernauld.html Cumbernauld Parish Records 1835, 1839 The Ordnance Survey Name Books of 1860 provide land-use information from around the same period. a pool at Fannyside locally known as Jean's HoleCumbernauld was long a staging-post for changing horses between Glasgow and Edinburgh and there were several inns and a smiddy as well as half a dozen coaches a day to various towns.https://archive.org/stream/newstatisticalac08edin#page/n178/mode/1up Coaches and Boats Old maps like the 1899 O.S. map show other employment like a gas works and a stocking factory in The Village and a corn millhttp://www.scottish-places.info/features/featurefirst16491.html Lenziemill historic employment at Lenziemill close to the old brick and pipe works.http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=16\u2aab=55.9477&lon;=-3.9881&layers;=1&b;=1 Great Old Mapshttp://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/ordnance-survey-map- series/list/os6inch2nd/dunbartonshire/cumbernauld more auld maps Three schools were run but the teachers were not always paid by the heritors.

The forensic experts, professors at Glasgow and Edinburgh, appeared as witnesses on opposing sides and a not proven verdict was returned.Hugo B. Millar, Historical Cumbernauld (1st edn) pg 26 Historically Cumbernauld has variously been in several administrative jurisdictionshttps://archive.org/stream/newstatisticalac08edin#page/n167/mode/2up Stirlingshire and Dumbartonshire including Stirlingshire, Dunbartonshire (sometimes spelled Dumbartonshire), and the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth District of Strathclyde region. Since 1995 it has been part of North Lanarkshire. The arms of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth District Council featured the white cattle and the Vulcan sounding motto of \"Daur and Prosper\" boldly asserting Dare and Prosper. However the open Bible and the miner's lamp were the only symbols which were carried on to the North Lanarkshire coat of arms. ===New Town history=== Hillcrest. Cumbernauld was designated a New Townhttps://archive.org/details/new_town_TNA Early cartoon showing thinking from 1948 on 9 December 1955. This being in the post-war era there are abundant film, photographic and paper records of this which are now being digitised. There was an inaugural ceremony on 28 June 1957 with Viscount Muirshiel, Secretary of State for Scotland of which some silent, colour footage survives. See the On film and TV section for link to this and other footage from this period. After the Second World War, Glasgow was suffering from a chronic shortage of housing and those that did survive the German bombing, were often of poor quality and had residents living in unsafe conditions; particularly in areas such as the Gorbals. As a direct result, the Clyde Valley Regional Plan 1946 allocated sites where satellite new towns were to be built to alleviate the problem through an overspill agreement. Glasgow would also undertake the development of its peripheral housing estates. Cumbernauld was designated as a New Town in 1955, the third to be designated in Scotland. The others were East Kilbride, Glenrothes, Livingston and Irvine (Cowling 1997). South Carbrain viewed from Cumbernauld railway station The development, promotion and management was undertaken, until 1996, by the Cumbernauld Development Corporation (CDC). This was a quango appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland (Cowling 1997). The area allocated was 4,150 acres (1,680 ha) lying between and incorporating the existing villages of Condorrat and Cumbernauld. The first new housing became available in 1958. An additional 3,638 acres (1,472 ha) was added to the designated town area on 19 March 1973 to accommodate a revised target population of 70,000. Cumbernauld is the clearest example of a modernist new town vision in the UK. Housing was originally built in a series of satellite neighbourhoods clustered around the hilltop town centre. Separation of people and cars was a major element of the first town master plan, and this was carried through for much of the development of the town. Cumbernauld pioneered designs for underpasses and pedestrian footbridges as well as segregated footpaths. This seemed strange to many settlers arriving from Glasgow, and the town's nickname of Noddy Land (Glaswegian sometimes Noddytown) was coined. Early neighbourhoods were designed by the CDC and were constructed at Ravenswood, Muirhead, Seafar and Kildrum, north of the Town Centre and Carbrain to the south. Other neighbourhoods were later developed at the Village, Greenfaulds, Condorrat, and Abronhill. Much of the housing in these areas won awards for their innovative designs. The Snake Bridge (and its shadow) to Stuart House Cumbernauld town centre's lead designer was Geoffrey Copcutt. Phase 1 was opened by Princess Margaret in 1967, of which some footage survives. When originally designated as a New Town, the target population was 50,000. In 1961, only five years after becoming a new town, the area to the north of the A80 was added to the town's area with new planned neighbourhoods at Westfield, Balloch, Westerwood and Carrickstone. As a result, a revised target population of 70,000 was set. However, the 2011 UK Census still only shows about 52,000 residents. St Enoch's station clock When Raymond Gillies, a local businessman, gifted Cumbernauld the St. Enoch's station clock, in 1977, the Queen was celebrating her Silver Jubilee. To mark the occasion, the Queen started the clock using the pendulum motion and unveiled a commemorative plaque at Cumbernauld Town Centre, at the staircase joining the upper mall area with the old Woolco store. The clock is featured in Gregory's Girl and is now in the Antonine Centre. After the creation of the new town, diverse industries such as high-tech, electronics, and chemical and food processing became large employers, along with the Inland Revenue (now Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs). The main industrial estates were developed to the east and west along the A80 at Wardpark and Westfield. Areas at Blairlinn and Lenziemill to the south of the town have also been developed for industry. The Cumbernauld Development Corporation (C.D.C.) disbanded in 1996.https://cumbernauldhousetrust.wordpress.com/about/ End of the C.D.C. ===Modern times=== Entrance to Cumbernauld Shopping Centre Concrete Sculpture \u2013 Glenhove Road, Carbrain The Modern era for the town can be dated from the disbanding of the C.D.C. in 1996. Since then, the outlook has changed dramaticallyhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/history/scotlandonfilm/forum/newlife/thread1.shtml testimony of decline and the New Town has won a number of very unflattering awards including Urban Realm's \"Plook on a Plinth\" in both 2001, and 2005. In December 2005, the entire Town Centre won a public nomination for demolition in the Channel 4 series Demolition, where it was voted \"the worst building in Britain\". As a result of this, it was featured on the BBC Radio 2 comedy programme It's Been a Bad Week, where it won the show's fictional \"Worst Week of the Week Award, Awarded Weekly, on a Week-By-Week Basis\" in 2003. The intended core of Cumbernauld remains the Town Centre buildings, all of which is essentially contained within one structure, segmented into \"phases\", the first of which was completed in 1967, the latest of which began construction in May 2003 for completion around September 2004. Initially the basic groundwork for the new shops began in 1997 and were finally completed in summer 2007. Designed to be a commerce centre, an entertainment and business venue and a luxury accommodation site, it was widely accepted as Britain's first shopping centre and was the world's first multi-level covered town centre. However, the town never developed to its planned size, and the town centre has never had the life envisaged by town planners. Wealthy occupiers for the penthouses situated within the \"Alien's Head\" (locals' acerbic moniker for the top section of the building) never materialised. Further expansion has been primarily to provide further space for shops. A substantial portion of the original Shopping Centre was demolished due to structural damage and has been redeveloped as a new shopping and leisure complex. Phase 1 from 2010 West Elevation, Cumbernauld Shopping Centre 2005 An underpass in Abronhill Westway Retail Park, Wardpark near CastlecaryAs well as the unfulfilled ambitions for the town, the passage of time has exposed serious defects in post-war concepts of centrally-planned retail and civic centres developed in the absence of proper community consultation or sensitivity to local environmental and economic conditions. This has been reflected in a country-wide backlash against brutalist architecture in general. Cumbernauld's Town Centre is widely regarded as one of the ugliest and least- lovedhttps://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zrIC4jRVTSkC&lpg;=PA175&ots;=skBd- lPdRn&dq;=cumbernauldian&pg;=PA168#v=onepage&q;&f;=false You Are Awful (But I Like You): Travels Through Unloved Britain examples of post-war design in Scotland. The confusing layout is an abiding source of frustration for both visitors and residents, many of whom are the descendants of skilled workers who aspired to escape the frequently appalling social and housing conditions of the Glasgow conurbation in the 1960s and 1970s. Despite its bad press, from a purely aesthetic standpoint Cumbernauld is regarded as representing a significant moment in town design, and in 1993 it was listed as one of the sixty key monuments of post-war architecture by the international conservation organisation DoCoMoMo. The residential structure of Cumbernauld is noteworthy in that there were no pedestrian crossings, i.e. zebra or pelican crossings \u2013 pedestrians originally traversed roads by bridge or underpass. These underpasses could collect litter, sometimes smelled like public toilets, or were used by local youths trying to keep out of the rain. These are not issues the original planners anticipated, but mean that pedestrians sometimes choose to avoid them, especially at night or if they feel vulnerable. Some efforts have been taken to redress some of these matters but the problem is ongoing. ==Industry== Barr's soft drinks factory Westfield Some well-known companies use Cumbernauld as a base including Mackintosh, and Farmfoods who operate in Blairlinn. Cumbernauld in the last few years has seen a surge of business activity with the OKI UK headquarters moving across town to Westfield close to Yaskawa Electronics. Irn-bru makers A.G. Barr also has its world headquarters in the Westfield part of the town. The old Isola-Werke factory in the Wardpark area has been converted into film studios and production facilities for the TV series Outlander which frequently films within the town's greenspaces. In particular, the Scottish Wildlife Trust's Cumbernauld Glen reserve, has been used as a backdrop whose ancient oak forest remnant provides a convenient stand-in for 18th Century Highlands' scenes. In May 2016, North Lanarkshire Council agreed to the expansion the Wardpark site if funding could be found. Another industrial estate Lenziemill is home to Dow Waste Management and furniture maker Aquapac amongst others. ==Environment== Cumbernauld consists of more than 50% green space, and was designed to incorporate green spaces as a resource for the community. The Scottish Wildlife Trust owns four wildlife reserves in the town \u2013 Cumbernauld Glen, Luggiebank Wood, Forest Wood, and Northside Wood. These habitats include ancient Oak forest (with attendant bluebell displays in early summer) and large areas of Scots Pine coverage. Bridge over the Bog Stank at the Glen The Bog Stank at the Glen Viaduct over the Red Burn in the Vault Glen Cumbernauld (like Ben Lomond) lies on the Scottish watershed, the drainage divide which separates river systems that flow to the east from those that flow to the west. There are two main waterways which flow out of Cumbernauld: the Red Burn (from which the town's Gaelic name is derived) and the Luggie Water (immortalised by David Gray). The Red Burnhttps://archive.org/stream/castlecaryandgr00bairgoog#page/n28/mode/2up possibly derivation of Red Burn flows through the Glen and there are walkways alongside this and the Bog Stank. Fannyside LochsTrack to Palacerigg from FannysideThere is also a footpath along the Glencryan Burn with miles of pathways up towards Pallacerigg and Fannyside Lochs. Fannyside Muir, to the south of the town, is part of the Slamannan plateau, an area of 183 hectares of lowland bog. This habitat is being restored by a variety of organisations including the national insect charity Buglife. The plateau is designated as a SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) and an SPA (Special Protection Area), partly because of its nationally important population of Taiga Bean Geese (Anser fabialis fabialis). Broadwood LochPalacerigg Country ParkThere are a large number of parks, and there are also LNRs (Local Nature Reserves) and SINCs (Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation) owned and managed by North Lanarkshire Council. For example St. Maurice's Pond as a SINC and Ravenswood has a LNR. In 1993 Broadwood Loch, a balancing lake, was created by damming the Moss Water and using a plastic waterproof membrane, and a wall to hold back the water.http://www.scottish- places.info/features/featurefirst18072.html Broodwood Loch This was primarily to prevent flooding downstream but also for recreation. A landscape scale conservation partnership led by the Scottish Wildlife Trust, the Cumbernauld Living Landscape (CLL), operates in the town with the aim of enhancing, connecting and restoring the greenspaces and improving people's perceptions of and access to them. In 2014, the CLL obtained camera trap footage of Pine martens living in the woods within Cumbernauld and the return of this species (formerly extinct across the Central belt of Scotland) has become a central plank of the organisation's strategy to improve perceptions of nature in the town. ==Awards== In 1967 the Institute of American Architects voted Cumbernauld the world's best new town conferring the Reynold's Memorial Award.http://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/record/rcahms/70556/cumbernauld- seafar-general/rcahms Reynold's Aware Cumbernauld is a two-time winner of the Carbuncle Awards in 2001 and 2005. The town has since received the award of 'Best Town' at the Scottish Design Awards 2012.
