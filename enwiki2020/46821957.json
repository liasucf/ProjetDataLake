The first round of the playoffs, or Conference Semi-Finals, consisted of two match-ups in each conference based on the seedings (1-4 and 2-3). The two winners advanced to the second round, or Conference Finals, with a match-up between the 1-4 and 2-3 winners. At the conclusion of the Conference Finals, the winners of these series advanced to the WNBA Finals. The Conference Semi-Finals and the Conference Finals are each best-of-three series. Series are played in a 1-1-1 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage (better record) hosts games 1 and 3, while their opponent hosts game 2. The WNBA Finals are a best-of-five series played in a 2-2-1 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage hosts games 1, 2, and 5 while their opponent hosts games 3 and 4. ===Tiebreak procedures=== ====Two- team tie==== # Better record in head-to-head games. # Better winning percentage within own conference. # Better winning percentage against all teams with .500 or better record at the end of the season. # Better point differential in games head-to-head. # Coin toss. ====Three or more-team tie==== # Better winning percentage among all head-to-head games involving tied teams. # Better winning percentage against teams within conference (for first two rounds of playoffs) or better record against teams in the opposite conference (for Finals). # Better winning percentage against all teams with a .500 or better record at the end of the season. # Better point differential in games involving tied teams. # Coin toss. ==Playoff qualifying== ===Eastern Conference=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=2|Seed !!rowspan=2|Team !!rowspan=2|Record !!colspan=3|Clinched |- !Playoff berth !!
