The duo are known for their work on Hindi film soundtracks, with many evergreen songs being composed by them. Some of their best-known works are Don, Bairaag, Saraswatichandra, Qurbani, Muqaddar Ka Sikandar, Laawaris (film), Tridev, Safar, etc. They won the 1975 Filmfare Award for Best Music Director for Kora Kagaz.They also won National Award for best music for the film Saraswati chandra.Awards ==Career== Kalyanji and Anandji were children of a Kutchi businessman who migrated from Kundrodi village in Kutch to 'Bombay' (now Mumbai) to start a grocery and provision store. Their younger brother and his wife are the husband and wife duo Babla & Kanchan. The brothers began to learn music from a music teacher, who taught them in lieu of paying his bills to their father. One of their great-grandparents was a folk musician of some eminence. They spent most of their formative years in the Mumbai locality of Girgaum amidst Marathi and Gujarati environs and among some eminent musical talent that resided in the vicinity. Kalyanji started his career as a musician, with a new electronic instrument called the clavioline. which was used for the famous \"Nagin Been,\" used in the film Nagin (1954) which had the music of Hemant Kumar.Carlo Nardi (July 2011). \"The Cultural Economy of Sound: Reinventing Technology in Indian Popular Cinema\". Journal on the Art of Record Production, Issue 5 , . Kalyanji then, with his brother Anandji, started an orchestral group called Kalyanji Virji and Party which organised musical shows in Mumbai and outside. This was the first attempt made for holding live musical shows in India. Kalyanji Anandji's arrival in the Bombay film industry as music composers was a turning point. When big music directors like S.D. Burman, Hemant Kumar, Madan Mohan, Naushad , Shankar Jaikishan and O.P Nayyar were ruling the Hindi film music world \u2013 and it was a golden period of film music \u2013 it was very tough to make a place amongst them. They still managed to attain success amongst the competition. The Bharat Bhushan\u2013 Nirupa Roy hit Samrat Chandragupta (1959) was his first film as Kalyanji Virji Shah. Songs like \"Chahe Paas Ho\" (Lata\u2013Rafi) that are remembered to this day were what made the movie a commercial success. This was followed by his composing music scores for more films like Post Box 999 before Anandji who was assisting him, joined him officially to form the Kalyanji Anandji duo in Satta Bazaar and Madari (1959). Chhalia (1960) was their earliest major hit. In 1965, two decisive scores, Himalay Ki God Mein and Jab Jab Phool Khile, established them as composers to reckon with. Both Kalyanji and Anandji worked as music composers for over 250 films, 17 of which were golden jubilees and 39 silver. They organised many charitable concerts for NGOs and several charitable institutions in India and abroad with some of the biggest names in Bollywood, like Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, Vinod Khanna, Rekha and Sridevi. Manhar Udhas, Kumar Sanu, Anuradha Paudwal, Alka Yagnik, Sadhana Sargam, Sapna Mukherjee, Udit Narayan, Sunidhi Chauhan, now very popular names, were nurtured as singers and got their first breaks from Kalyanji Anandji. Laxmikant Pyarelal worked as music assistants to Kalyanji Anandji before composing Music independently for Hindi films. They helped introduce or gave career defining breaks to lyricists like Qamar Jalalabadi, Anand Bakshi, Gulshan Bawra, Anjaan, Verma Malik and M G Hashmat. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, their work was introduced to a young Western audience by three albums. Bombay the Hard Way: Guns, Cars and Sitars was a mix album put together by US DJ Dan The Automator; Bollywood Funk was an Outcaste compilation album put together by Sutrasonic DJs Harv and Sunni; while The Beginners Guide To Bollywood was compiled by John Lewis from Time Out magazine. All three of these records concentrated on Kalyanji Anandji tracks from 1970s films that featured funk breakbeats, wah-wah guitars and Motown- style orchestrations. In 2005, The Black Eyed Peas's \"Don't Phunk with My Heart\" used music pieces from two of their songs: \"Ae Naujawan\" from the 1972 film Apradh and \"Yeh Mera Dil\" from the 1978 film Don, which won the American hip-hop group a Grammy Award. On 24 August 2000, Kalyanji breathed his last. The composers composed some popular songs rendered by Kishore Kumar such as \"Jeevan se bhari teri aankhe\", \"Zindagi ka safar hai ye kaisa Safar\", \"Pal Pal dilke paas\", \"Neele Neele Ambar Par\". Their composition called \"Pal bharke liye\" was used in an episode of The Simpsons. Remixed version of the song \"Apni Toh Jaise Taise,\" originally from the 1981 film Laawaris was used in 2010 Bollywood film Housefull. The Calcutta High Court restrained producer Sajid Nadiadwala from the cinematic use of the song. They used playback of Mohammad Rafi for Dilip Kumar in \"Bairaag \" and Kishore Kumar for Shammi Kapur in \"Vidhata \".BairaagVidhaata ==Trivia== # \"Neele Neele Ambar Par\", sung by Kishore Kumar was a copy of the original song \"Ilaya Nila\" song composed by Ilaiyaraaja ==Collaboration with singers== ; Mohd Rafi The duo composed many songs for Mohd Rafi. At their initial stage as music director, Mohd Rafi was their first choice of singer. They made numerous popular song with him. Film Jab Jab Phool Khile rise them to fame and there was no looking back after that. All songs of Jab Jab Phool Khile was huge hit. Beside Jab Jab Phool Khile, there many popular song with Mohd Rafi from film like Qurbani (Kya Dekhte Ho), Bluff Master (Govinda Ala Re Ala), Raaz ( Akele Hain Chehle Aao), Sacha Jhutha (Yuhi Tum Mujhse Baat Karti Hoo), Maryada (Tum Bhi Aja Ke), Haat Ki Safai (Vadaa Karle Sajna), Gopi (Sukh Ki Hai Saab Sathie), Qatilon Ka Qatil ( Yeh To Allah Ko Khabar & Oh Mere Chorni), Geet (Aja Tujh Ko Pukare Mere Geet) & Bairaag (Sare Shaher Mein App Sa) to named a few of the popular song. In film Muqaddar Ka Sikandar where most song was playbacked by Kishore Kumar, they used Mohd Rafi to sing Kishore Kumar Rote Hua Ate Saab some lines on the sad version of the song.

Lata's influence on their music in the initial years can be gauged from the fact that in their first musical score Samrat Chandragupt (1958),Lataji was the only female playback singer, having sung 8 out of 8 numbers in the movie. However, since 1979 they started using Lata mangeshkar's voice very sparingly, even though they kept on offering songs to other senior singers like Asha Bhosle and Kishore Kumar.
