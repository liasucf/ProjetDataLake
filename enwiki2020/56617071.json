NRGI promotes the implementation of the Natural Resource Charter and provides policy advice with regard to this implementation process. The Natural Resource Charter consists of the following 12 Precepts, which are organised into three parts based on the chain of decisions involved in natural resource management:NRGI (2018). Natural Resource Charter (2nd ed.). Retrieved February 23rd, 2018. * Domestic foundations for resource governance :(1) Resource management should secure the greatest benefit for citizens through an inclusive and comprehensive national strategy, clear legal framework and competent institutions. :(2) Resource governance requires decision makers to be accountable to an informed public. * Economic decisions required to manage resources for prosperity :(3) The government should encourage efficient exploration and production operations, and allocate rights transparently. :(4) Tax regimes and contractual terms should enable the government to realize the full value of its resources consistent with attracting necessary investment, and should be robust to changing circumstances. :(5) The government should pursue opportunities for local benefits, and account for, mitigate and offset the environmental and social costs of resource extraction projects. :(6) Nationally owned companies should be accountable, with well-defined mandates and an objective of commercial efficiency. :(7) The government should invest revenues to achieve optimal and equitable outcomes, for current and future generations. :(8) The government should smooth domestic spending of revenues to account for revenue volatility. :(9) The government should use revenue as an opportunity to increase the efficiency of public spending at the national and sub-national levels. :(10) The government should facilitate private sector investments to diversify the economy and to engage in the extractive industry. * International foundations for resource governance :(11) Companies should commit to the highest environmental, social and human rights standards, and to sustainable development. :(12) Governments and international organizations should promote an upward harmonization of standards to support sustainable development. == Resource Governance Index == The Resource Governance Index, developed by NRGI, measures the quality of countries' resource governance and ranks them accordingly. The index is constructed by sending a 149-item questionnaire to 150 experts in 81 countries, who research the issues raised in the questionnaire, compile documentation and complete the questionnaire. The quality of the survey data is then assessed by NRGI and enriched by further data on countries \"enabling environments\".NRGI (2017). 2017 Resource Governance Index. Retrieved February 23rd, 2018. Finally, NRGI calculates the index as a composite score out of the: * Value realization score; * Revenue management score; * Enabling environment score; with higher scores indicating a better resource governance process. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right\" !rowspan=\"2\"| Country/territory !colspan=\"1\"| Assessed sector !colspan=\"1\"| RGI 2017 score !colspan=\"1\"| RGI
