    "text": "Coronene (also known as superbenzene) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) comprising seven peri-fused benzene rings. Its chemical formula is . It is a yellow material that dissolves in common solvents including benzene, toluene, and dichloromethane. Its solutions emit blue light fluorescence under UV light. It has been used as a solvent probe, similar to pyrene. The compound is of theoretical interest to organic chemists because of its aromaticity. It can be described by 20 resonance structures or by a set of three mobile Clar sextets. In the Clar sextet case, the most stable structure for coronene has only the three isolated outer sextets as fully aromatic although superaromaticity would still be possible when these sextets are able to migrate into the next ring. ==Occurrence and synthesis== Carpathite Coronene occurs naturally as the very rare mineral carpathite, which is characterized by flakes of pure coronene embedded in sedimentary rock. This mineral may be created from ancient hydrothermal vent activity.Karpatite. luminousminerals.com In earlier times this mineral was also called karpatite or pendletonite.Carpathite. mindat.org Coronene is produced in the petroleum- refining process of hydrocracking, where it can dimerize to a fifteen ring PAH, trivially named \"dicoronylene\" (formally named benzo[10,11]phenanthro[2',3',4',5',6':4,5,6,7]chryseno[1,2,3-bc]coronene or benzo[1,2,3-bc:4,5,6-b'c']dicoronene). Centimeter-long crystals can be grown from a supersaturated solution of the molecules in toluene (ca. 2.5 mg/ml), which is slowly cooled (ca. 0.04 K/min) from 328 K to 298 K over a period of 12 hours. ==Structure== Coronene is a planar circulene. It forms needle-like crystals with a monoclinic, herringbone-like structure. The most common polymorph is \u03b3, but \u03b2 form can also be produced in an applied magnetic field (ca. 1 Tesla) or by phase transition from \u03b3 decreasing the temperature below 158 K.

For example, coronene molecules evaporated onto a copper surface at 1000 degrees Celsius will form a graphene lattice which can then be transferred onto another substrate. ==See also== * Cyclooctadecanonaene, the compound consting of just the outer ring without the benzene core * Hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene and hexa-cata-hexabenzocoronene, consisting of additional benzene rings fused around the periphery == References == Category:Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ",
