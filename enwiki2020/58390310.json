Equine doctor, Andrew Mclean believed Chautauqua was not suffering by constantly racing. Mclean believed Chautauqua's behaviour was being caused by a 'freeze response' which was being initiated by a large adrenalin surge as the barriers opened. After Chautauqua refused to jump for the sixth consecutive trial, Racing NSW considered banning him from racing as there was no current rule to govern horses did not leave the starting barriers. However, Chautauqua was instead retired by owners and trainers on his 7th consecutive incident at the start box in a trial during 2019. == Statistics == Chautauqua retired as Australia's 3rd greatest stakes-earning sprinter behind sprinters Winx and Redzel.
