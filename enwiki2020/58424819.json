    "text": "an engraving by Abraham Bosse, depicting the Troupe Royale at the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne in ParisDeierkauf-Holsboer 1954, p. 56 and plate IV (opposite p. 49). Charles Le Noir or Lenoir (first active 1618; died 9 August 1637) was a French actor-manager, who was a member of the troupe of the Prince of Orange from at least 1622, sometimes named as a co-founder with the actor Montdory of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais in 1634, and a member of the Troupe Royale at the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne from 1634 to 1637.Mongr\u00e9dien 1972, p. 114. ==Life== The first record of Charles Le Noir shows he was the leader of a troupe in Bordeaux in 1618.Forman 2010, p. 152. He then appears as the leader of a troupe in Lille in 1620.Lefebvre 1907, p. 141; cited by Mongr\u00e9dien 1972, p. 114. Le Noir and Montdory were both members of the troupe of the Prince of Orange at the H\u00f4tel de Bourgogne in Paris in July and August 1622.Wiley 1960, p. 101; Mongr\u00e9dien 1972, p. 114. The Prince of Orange died in 1625, but the company continued to perform under his name, appearing regularly in alternation with the troupe of Robert Gu\u00e9rin at the Bourgogne.Wiley 1960, p. 102; Howe 2006, p. 522. According to W. L. Wiley, Montdory joined a different troupe in April 1624.Wiley 1960, pp. 101\u2013102 Le Noir was in the cast, when the company presented Pierre Corneille's first play, M\u00e9lite, in Paris around 1629 to 1630. The play may have been presented at the Bourgogne before it was given at the jeu de paume de Berthault, located on the cul-de-sac Beaubourg, where Montdory rejoined the company.Howe 2006, pp. 521\u2013524. Le Noir also appeared in their production of Corneille's Clitandre (1630\u20131631).Howe 2006, p. 541. From 15 December 1631, the company began performing at the tennis court known as La Sph\u00e8re, located on the rue Vieille-du-Temple,Howe 2006, p. 521. and on 10 February 1632, Le Noir and his troupe were sentenced at the Ch\u00e2telet and required to pay a fine of 405 livres for having given 120 performances at the Berthault.Mongr\u00e9dien 1972, p. 114; Souli\u00e9 1863, p. 163. After about three months at La Sph\u00e8re, the company moved to yet another tennis court, La Fontaine, on the rue Michel-le-Comte, where they were to remain for two years. During this period Le Noir appeared in other plays by Corneille, including, La Veuve (1632\u20131633), La Galerie du Palais (1632\u20131633), La Suivante (1633\u20131634), La Place royale (1633\u20131634), and possibly M\u00e9d\u00e9e (1634\u20131635).Howe 2006, p. 542. On 8 March 1634 the troupe leased a jeu de paume on the rue Vieille-du-Temple with a sign on it reading \"Les Marestz\", which was soon to be their permanent home and eventually become known as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais.Wiley 1960, p. 171. According to Deierkauf-Holsboer, the theatre's opening and founding occurred on 1 April 1634.Deierkauf-Holsboer 1954, p. 32. Soon, however, Le Noir would have to leave the troupe: according to the Gazette de France of 30 November 1634, King Louis XIII transferred Le Noir along with 5 other actors: L'Espy, Jodelet, Jaqueman Jadot, Alizon, and Mlle Le Noir (Isabelle Mestivier), to the company of Bellerose at the Bourgogne.Howarth 1997, p. 103. Very little is known about Le Noir's career during his time there.Hartnoll 1983, p. 482. Charles Le Noir married the actress Isabelle Mestivier, and they had five children, including the actor Fran\u00e7ois Le Noir.Mongr\u00e9dien 1972, pp. 114\u2013115; Deierkauf-Holsboer 1970, p. 150. According to Mongr\u00e9dien, she is also called Fran\u00e7oise or Elisabeth. Her father, Fran\u00e7ois Mestivier, was a member of the troupe of the Prince of Orange from at least 1622 until the end of 1634.Deierkauf-Holsboer 1954, pp. 19, 43. Charles Le Noir died on 9 August 1637 at his home on the rue Beaurepaire, parish of Saint-Sauveur, Paris.Deierkauf-Holsboer 1954, p. 56. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * Deierkauf- Holsboer, S.
