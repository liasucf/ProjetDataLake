Born to an amateur musical family in a district town in Ayeyarwady delta, he was not a stranger to music since he was young. His father was an amateur traditional guitar player and his mother was an amateur singer. His maternal grandfather was a traditional trumpet player. ==Career== ===Beginning and competition=== Phyo Myat Aung started singing mono songs along with his parents in street performances since he was 8 years old. At the age of ten, he was introduced Rock music by one of his uncles and he fell in love with this genre instantly. Since then he inspired to become a rock singer. The adolescent years were very harsh for him as the family fell into financial hardship. He used to have just a pair of school uniform and even barely had meals during lunch time. Those unfortunate things led him into engaging street fights. He finally ended his education as a high school dropout. Despite those spiral-downward personal hardship, his affection to music and inspiration to become a singer had never gone away. He started stage singing with a local band in the vicinity of his home town since he was 14. He adopted a stage-name Agni which means \u2018born from fire\u2019 to echo his harsh life. He had limited success with his local band and performed in various local events. But he barely made living by his singing career and faced immense pressure to abandon his passion of singing and start a more stable career as a driver, etc. He faced many backlashes in social and professional life due to his relatively poor social and financial background. He ordained into monkshood following the tradition of a Burmese male. This made him to expose more to the teaching of Buddha about life, and refresh thoughts about his life and ambitions. He changed his way of life gradually since then. A breakthrough moment came when a friend suggested to enter audition for Myanmar Idol Season 3. He borrowed money to travel to a nearby town for Myanmar Idol audition. He was the first contestant from that audition session to go for the next level of competition. He passed through several stages of the competition to become one of Top 11 finalists. His frankness and child-like naiveness appealed to the wider range of TV viewers around the country during the live broadcasts of Myanmar Idol.
