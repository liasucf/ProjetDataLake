    "text": "The 2000 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain was a tour by the New Zealand national rugby league team to compete at the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. New Zealand dominated Group 1 of the tournament thrashing Lebanon, the Cook Islands and Wales with a combined score of 206\u201328, before winning their quarter-final against France and their semi-final against England to qualify for the final. In the final, they lost to defending champions Australia 12-40 to finish runners-up in a World Cup tournament for the second time. ==Background== Alongside Australia and France, New Zealand had competed at all eleven previous World Cups. New Zealand finished runner up in 1988. The twelfth World Cup was scheduled to be held in Great Britain, Ireland and France in 2000, following on from the successful 1995 Rugby League World Cup. New Zealand was granted automatic entry into the 2000 World Cup. ==Build up== In the twelves months prior to the World Cup, New Zealand had finished second at the 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations, losing to Australia 20\u201322 in the final, before losing the 2000 Anzac test match by a record margin of 0-52. For the first, and to date only, time, the New Zealand M\u0101ori rugby league team were invited to compete in the World Cup as Aotearoa M\u0101ori. Their squad included several past New Zealand representatives who were not selected for the final squad. ==Staff== *Head Coach: Frank Endacott *Manager: Gary Cooksley (Auckland)John Coffey and Bernie Wood, The Kiwis: 100 Years of International Rugby League, Hodder Moa, Auckland, 2007, p. 371. ==Squad== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#fff;\" !!width=25%|Player !width=5%|Games !width=5%|Tries !width=5%|Goals !width=5%|Points !width=5%|Position !width=35%|Club |- |Richie Barnett (captain) | 6 | 6 | 0 | 24 |FE |Sydney Roosters |- |Richie Blackmore | 2 | 1 | 0 | 4 |CE |Leeds Rhinos |- |Tonie Carroll | 5 | 4 | 0 | 16 |CE |Brisbane Broncos |- |Nathan Cayless | 6 | 1 | 0 | 4 |PR |Parramatta Eels |- |Brian Jellick | 2 | 2 | 0 | 8 |WG |North Queensland Cowboys |- |Stacey Jones | 5 | 2 | 6 | 20 |HB |Auckland Warriors |- |Stephen Kearney | 6 | 2 | 0 | 8 |SR |Melbourne Storm |- |Ali Lauitiiti | 2 | 2 | 0 | 8 |SR |Auckland Warriors |- |Tasesa Lavea | 2 | 2 | 14 | 36 |HB |Melbourne Storm |- |Henry Paul | 5 | 1 | 25* | 53 |HB |Bradford Bulls |- |Robbie Paul | 5 | 5 | 0 | 20 |HB |Bradford Bulls |- |Quentin Pongia | 5 | 2 | 0 | 8 |PR |Sydney Roosters |- |Tony Puletua | 2 | 1 | 0 | 4 |SR |Penrith Panthers |- |Matt Rua | 5 | 1 | 0 | 4 |SR |Melbourne Storm |- |Craig Smith | 6 | 1 | 0 | 4 |PR |St. George Illawarra Dragons |- |Richard Swain | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 |HK |Melbourne Storm |- |Logan Swann | 4 | 2 | 0 | 8 |SR |Auckland Warriors |- |Willie Talau | 5 | 6 | 0 | 24 |CE |Canterbury Bulldogs |- |David Vaealiki | 1 | 2 | 0 | 8 |CE |Parramatta Eels |- |Joe Vagana | 6 | 0 | 0 | 0 |PR |Auckland Warriors |- |Nigel Vagana | 5 | 3 | 0 | 12 |CE |Auckland Warriors |- |Lesley Vainikolo | 5 | 9 | 0 | 36 |WG |Canberra Raiders |- |Ruben Wiki | 6 | 3 | 0 | 12 |PR |Canberra Raiders |} * Note*: includes a field goal. ==Fixtures== ===World Cup Group 2=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=165|Team !width=40|Played !width=40|Won !width=40|Drawn !width=40|Lost !width=40|For !width=40|Against !width=40|Diff !width=40|Points |- style=\"background:#cfc; text-align:center;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"| ||3||3||0||0||206||28||+178||6 |- style=\"background:#cfc; text-align:center;\" |style=\"text-align:left;\"| ||3||2||0||1||80||86||\u22126||4 |- align=center |style=\"text-align:left;\"| ||3||0||1||2||44||110||\u221266||1 |- align=center |style=\"text-align:left;\"| ||3||0||1||2||38||144||\u2212106||1 |} ====Lebanon==== New Zealand: 1\\.

At the start of the second half, Nathan Hindmarsh scored to take the lead to 12-0 before Lesley Vainikolo pounced on a loose ball to dive over on 49 minutes. When Henry Paul landed the conversion, the deficit was back down to six points. Soon after, Australian halfback, Brett Kimmorley, made a break down the right before feeding the ball inside to fullback Darren Lockyer, who crossed for another try. Rogers' third successful kick made it 18\u20136 to the defending champions. However, the Kiwis quickly struck back when Tonie Carroll beat several Australian defenders to score. Henry Paul's conversion made it 18\u201312. New Zealand then made several crucial errors and Australia were able to capitalise. Sailor grabbed two tries in the space of five minutes to take his tally for the tournament to 10 tries. The first of them came on 63 minutes courtesy of a reverse pass from Gidley. Rogers missed the second of the two quick conversions. Skipper Fittler then breached the New Zealand defence on 73 minutes to score his first try of the final which was converted by Rogers. Substitute Trent Barrett then finished the scoring, with a try that was converted by Rogers. ==Aftermath== The tournament was coach Frank Endacott's last in charge of New Zealand, and he was replaced by Gary Freeman for the 2001 season. Tonie Carroll later switched his eligibility to Australia and played seven tests for the Kangaroos. New Zealand next toured Great Britain in 2002. The next World Cup was held in Australia in 2008, and was won by New Zealand. ==References== 2000 World Cup 2000 Category:2000 Rugby League World Cup ",
