He was also president of the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the vice-president of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR), two positions he assumed in 2004. He was the President of the Senate, second position in the Romanian state, from 10 March 2014 until he resigned on 2 September 2019, having previously resigned from the PNL party, becoming an independent senator. In July 2014, he established the Liberal Reformist Party. ==Personal life== Calin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu was born in Bucharest. His mother, Alexandrina Louiza, was of Greek ancestryPress Releases-\"The perception about Romania has improved in the last months\", have said to the Prime Minister Calin Popescu-Tariceanu the representatives of the Hellenic Association from Romania and those of the Romanian Orthodox Community \"Stefan cel Mare si Sfant\", that he met to Athena, in the evening \u2013her mother was fully Greek while her father was half-Romanian, half-Greek.\"Premierul Tariceanu preocupat de romanii emigrati in Grecia \", Ziua, 7 July 2005. He has been married five times and has two children. Popescu-T\u0103riceanu is a graduate of the Technical University of Civil Engineering of Bucharest and has a master's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. ==Early political career== Between 1996 and 1997, he served as Minister of Industries and Commerce in Victor Ciorbea's government. Between 1996 and 2004 he was a member of the Chamber of Deputies of Romania, representing Bucharest. Between 2000 and 2004, he was vice president of the PNL group in Parliament, as well as vice president of the Budget, Finances and Insurance Committee in the Chamber of Deputies.Calin Popescu-Tariceanu, Vicepresedinte al Partidului National Liberal, Membru al Camerei Deputatilor ==Prime Minister== Traian B\u0103sescu (left) and T\u0103riceanu in 2005 Following the victory of Traian B\u0103sescu in the 2004 presidential election, B\u0103sescu appointed Popescu-T\u0103riceanu as Prime Minister, in line with a pre-electoral agreement between the two parties of the Justice and Truth Alliance. The new government took office on 29 December; it was approved by Parliament by a vote of 265 for and 200 against. He became the first National Liberal prime minister since 1937. The T\u0103riceanu government oversaw a number of major reforms, such as the introduction of a flat tax, the revaluation of the leu, the abolition of conscription and professionalization of the Romanian Armed Forces, and the accession of Romania to the European Union in 2007. It also coincided with a considerable economic boom in Romania. However, economists criticized several of T\u0103riceanu's policies, such as the introduction of a \"first registration tax\" for motor vehicles, faulty management of over 2 billion euros acquired following the privatization of BCR, and, most prominently, an increase in the number of public servants and their salaries, which resulted in a major increase in public spending on the eve of the financial crisis. On 7 July 2005, Popescu-T\u0103riceanu announced that he and his cabinet would resign in order to trigger early elections. The announcement of the resignation was prompted by the Constitutional Court's decision to block a set of laws designed to reform the judicial system. President Traian B\u0103sescu had been pushing for early elections since his victory in the 2004 elections. On 19 July, Popescu-T\u0103riceanu reversed the decision and announced he would not resign, citing the severe floods that hit the country (for example the Com\u0103ne\u015fti floods). Floods killed 66 people in Romania that year, leaving thousands homeless.EurMonitor Guvernare: Inundatii dezastruoase Transparenta Guvernare europeana: Integrare uniunea europeana stiri UE eveniment finantari aderare joburi \u2013 EurActiv.ro At that point, relations began to publicly sour between Popescu-T\u0103riceanu and President B\u0103sescu, who refused to meet with the Prime Minister in the days following the announced reversal. In the view of former President Emil Constantinescu, however, relations between Popescu-T\u0103riceanu and President B\u0103sescu started to become strained following allegations of B\u0103sescu's past membership in the Securitate (during Communist Romania). In September 2005, a newspaper alleged that on 9 April 2004, T\u0103riceanu bought 10 million shares of the Rompetrol company based on insider information, shares that were sold later that year after he became Prime Minister. Several other publicly known persons were cited to testify about their involvement in questionable transactions with Rompetrol shares, including the company's CEO, Dinu Patriciu. On 5 April 2006 Basescu stated that he regrets naming Tariceanu Prime-Minister, and accused him of partnership with other groups.Cotidianul:Basescu: Regret ca l-am numit pe Tariceanu premier On 29 June 2006, T\u0103riceanu officially announced that the National Liberal Party supports the withdrawal of Romanian troops from international battle zones where they are deployed without a mandate from the United Nations, NATO, or the European Union. This mainly concerns the Romanian troops in Iraq (present there following the Iraq War). This position is strongly opposed by President B\u0103sescu. On 14 March 2007, Popescu-T\u0103riceanu postponed the elections for the European Parliament claiming that the political environment was too unstable due to discussions regarding President's impeachment, the subsequent referendum, and the fact that President Basescu asked for a referendum regarding uninominal elections. The media also pointed out that Popescu-T\u0103riceanu's National Liberal Party stood to perform poorly in the elections if they were held at the time. T\u0103riceanu at a cabinet meeting in 2007 On 21 March 2007, he assumed ad interim the office of Minister of Foreign Affairs, 43 days after Ungureanu's resignation, because President B\u0103sescu refused to accept the nomination of Adrian Cioroianu. On 5 April 2007, the Constitutional Court decided \"The Romanian President's refusal to name a member of Government at the proposal of Prime Minister started a jurisdictional conflict of a constitutional nature.[...] The Romanian President has no right to veto, but he can ask the Prime Minister to renounce his proposal, if he observes that the proposed person does not meet the legal conditions required to be a member of Government\".Antena 3: Comunicat de presa al Curtii constitutionale The same day, Cioroianu assumed the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. On 1 April 2007, Tariceanu dismissed the ministers of the pro-B\u0103sescu Democratic Party and formed a minority government with the Democratic Union of Hungarians;\"Romania's prime minister names new Cabinet of minority government\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 2 April 2007. the government was approved by Parliament on 3 April, with the support of the Social Democratic Party.Adam Brown, \"Romanian Lawmakers Approve New Cabinet in First Test of Support\", Bloomberg.com, 3 April 2007. Popescu-T\u0103riceanu's government survived a no-confidence vote on 3 October 2007, following a motion brought by the Social Democratic Party. Although 220 members of parliament voted in favor of the motion and only 152 voted against it, the motion fell short of the necessary 232 votes.\"Romania's government survives no-confidence motion\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 3 October 2007. == Late political career == On 26 February 2014, T\u0103riceanu left PNL due to their intention to leave the Social-Liberal Union and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) to join the European People's Party. One day later, he announced that he would launch a new political party, the Liberal Reformist Party (PLR). The party's first congress was held on 1\u20132 August 2014. Popescu-T\u0103riceanu was elected president of the new party. On 4 March, PNL leader Crin Antonescu stepped down his position as President of the Senate. On 10 March, Popescu-T\u0103riceanu was elected as the new President of the Senate, with the votes of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and serving as independent senator.Senatorul independent C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu a fost ales pre\u0219edinte al Senatului , Agerpres.ro, 10 March 2014. In late July 2014, Popescu-T\u0103riceanu launched his candidacy for the 2014 presidential elections.Tariceanu candideaza la alegerile prezidentiale, Ziare.com, 27 June 2014 Due to problems with registering his new political party, he ran as independent.Specimenul buletinului de vot , bec2014.ro T\u0103riceanu placed third in the election's first round, with 5,36%, behind Klaus Iohannis and Victor Ponta. Later, he announced that he would support Ponta in the second round of the elections. However, in the run-off, Ponta was defeated by Iohannis by a 54.5%-45.5% margin. In July 2015, PLR announced its merger with the Conservative Party (PC), to form a new party, Alliance of Liberals and Democrats (ALDE), T\u0103riceanu becoming its co- president. In 2017, T\u0103riceanu, claimed that he was a staunch Monarchist and \"Constitutional monarchy has the advantage of placing the monarch over political games, which is not our case: the president, instead of being an arbitrator, prefers to be a player. \"http://adevarul.ro/news/politica/monarhia-salveaza-psd-presedintele-executiv- psd-vorbeste-posibil-referendum-tema-monarhiei-loc- acesta-1_5a37a9f95ab6550cb8531ab9/index.html ==Controversies== T\u0103riceanu has been accused by President B\u0103sescu of interfering with justice in Dinu Patriciu's benefit. On 24 January 2006, Monica Macovei, then Minister of Justice, made public a meeting with T\u0103riceanu which took place 7 months before (in June 2005), and to which T\u0103riceanu invited Dinu Patriciu. Patriciu complained to Macovei about alleged procedural problems regarding his case. Macovei accused T\u0103riceanu of interfering with justice. On 20 February 2006 T\u0103riceanu declared on TVR1:\" I recognise my fault. I didn't act correctly. But I didn't influence justice.\" \"\u00cemi recunosc vina. Nu am procedat corect. Dar nu am influen\u0163at justi\u0163ia\"Tariceanu despre intalnirea din 2005 cu Macovei si Patriciu: Nu am procedat corect \u2013 Realitatea TV \u2013 Politic\u0103 Elena Udrea recalled that, while she was Presidential Counsellor, she saw a note written by T\u0103riceanu. In a few days President B\u0103sescu found the note and made it public, saying that \"The Prime Minister suggested to me a partnership, but, unfortunately, with our oligarchies\" \"Domnul prim-ministru imi propunea un parteneriat, dar, din pacate, cu oligarhiile noastre\". The note was about a complaint from Petromidia about the 27 May procedure problems: > Dear Traian, > 1\\. I send you annexed a document released by Petromidia, regarding the > ongoing investigations. > 2\\. If you have the opportunity to speak at the Prosecuting Magistracy about > the subject? In May 2007, Patriciu won a lawsuit against the Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI), which illegally tapped his phones for two years. He received from SRI 50,000 RON as moral prejudice.BBC:Dinu Patriciu c\u00e2\u015ftig\u0103 procesul \u00eempotriva SRI ==Electoral history== ===Mayor of Bucharest=== {| class=wikitable width=100% ! rowspan=2|Election ! rowspan=2|Affiliation ! colspan=3|First round |- !Votes !Percentage !Position |-align=center !2020 | || 9,892 || || |} ===Presidential elections=== {| class=wikitable width=100% ! rowspan=2|Election ! rowspan=2|Affiliation ! colspan=3|First round ! colspan=3|Second round |- !Votes !Percentage !Position !Votes !Percentage !Position |-align=center !2014 | 1 || 508,572 || || || bgcolor=lightgrey colspan=3|not qualified |-align=center |} Notes: 1 His party, PLR, did not manage to register in time for the elections, therefore he was forced to file his candidacy as an independent. ==References== ==Bibliography== *Evenimentul Zilei, 14 December 2005, \"Emil Constantinescu a adus documente despre care spune c\u0103 atest\u0103 colaborarea pre\u015fedintelui Traian B\u0103sescu cu Securitatea\" *Jurnalul National, 9 February 2006. \"Urmeaz\u0103 T\u0103riceanu?\" |- |- |- Category:1952 births Category:Chairpersons of the National Liberal Party (Romania) Category:Living people Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies (Romania) Category:Presidents of the Senate of Romania Category:Members of the Senate of Romania Category:People from Bucharest Category:Prime Ministers of Romania Category:Romanian Ministers of Foreign Affairs Category:Candidates for President of Romania Category:Romanian people of Greek descent Category:Romanian Roman Catholics Category:Romanian monarchists ",
