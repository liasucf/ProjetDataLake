It staged 50 first-class and 29 List A matches from 1982 to 1998. The ground was at the Montgomery Biscuit Factory, which was the largest employer in Sahiwal.Shahid Javed Burki, Pakistan Under Bhutto, 1971\u20131977, St Martin's Press, New York, 1980, p. 143. The factory's owner, Basharat Shafi, a former first-class cricketer and the president of the Multan Cricket Association, developed the ground to a high standard.Wisden 2012, p. 186. Apart from domestic matches, the ground also staged the only warm-up match of the Zimbabwean tour of 1996-97. While playing a first-class match at Zafar Ali Stadium in Sahiwal on their 1987-88 tour of Pakistan the England players were accommodated in the dormitories at the Montgomery Biscuit Factory, much to their displeasure. ==References== ==External links== * Montgomery Cricket Club Ground, Sahiwal at CricketArchive Category:Sahiwal District Category:Cricket grounds in Pakistan ",
