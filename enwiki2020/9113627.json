In 1949, she started caring for the poorest of the poor in her convent's chicken yard in Salvador, Bahia. Today, more than 3,000 people arrive every day at this same site (where the Santo Ant\u00f4nio Hospital now stands) to receive free medical treatment. She also established CESA, a school for the poor in Sim\u00f5es Filho, one of the most impoverished cities in the state of Bahia. At the time of her death in 1992, Sister Dulce had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize,Four women to be canonized alongside John Henry NewmanDulce Lopes Pontes: From serving the sick to Nobel nominee she had received two personal audiences with Pope John Paul II, and she had, almost single-handedly, created one of the largest and most respected philanthropic organizations in Brazil. She was named the most admired woman in the history of Brazil by O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper and the most influential religious person in Brazil during the 20th century, by ISTO\u00c9 magazine. In 2011, she was beatified with papal approval by Cardinal Geraldo Majella Agnelo, the first step toward sainthood. In May 2019, Pope Francis, during an audience given to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints Prefect Giovanni Angelo Becciu, recognized the second miracle needed to officially canonize her as a saint. She was formally canonized on 13 October 2019,Dulce Lopes Pontes: From serving the sick to Nobel nominee, Vatican News (October 2019). making her the first Brazilian female saint.Angela Giuffrida, Victorian priest and scholar John Henry Newman to be made a saint in Rome, The Guardian (13 October 2019). == Early life == Born in Salvador, Bahia, the second daughter of Augusto Lopes Pontes and Dulce Maria de Souza, as Maria Rita de Souza Pontes, she entered religious life when she was 18 years old. When she was thirteen years old, her aunt had taken her on a trip to the poor area of the city. The sight of the misery and poverty she encountered there made a deep impression on the young girl, who came from an upper middle-class background. She began to care for the homeless and beggars in her neighborhood, giving them free haircuts and treating their wounds. By that time, she had already shown interest in following religious life. Her father, however, did not like the idea and insisted that she become a teacher . == Graduation and religious life == She graduated from high school at the age of 18. She, then, asked her father to allow her to follow her religious calling. He agreed and she joined the Congregation of the Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of the Mother of God, in Our Lady of Carmel Convent, in Sergipe. A year later, she received the religious habit of that Congregation and was given the name Dulce, in memory of her mother (who had died when she was 6 years old). == Social works == During the same year, she founded the \"S\u00e3o Francisco's Worker's Union\", the first Christian worker's movement in Bahia. A year later, she started welfare work in the poor communities of Alagados and Itapagipe. It was then that they started calling her the \"Angel of Alagados\". In 1937, she transformed the Worker's Union into the Worker's Center of Bahia. Determined to house sick people who came to her for help, in 1939 Sister Dulce started to shelter them in abandoned houses in Salvador's 'Ilha dos Ratos' (rats' island) district. Then she would go in search of food, medicine and medical care. Later, when she and her patients were evicted from the neighborhood, she started housing them in an old fish market, but City Hall denied her the use of the space and told her to leave. Facing a big problem and already taking care of over 70 people, she turned to the Mother Superior of her convent and asked her permission to use the convent's chicken yard as an improvised hostel. The Superior reluctantly agreed, so long as Sister Dulce could take care of the chickens (which she did, by feeding them to her patients). That improvised hostel gave rise to the Hospital Santo Antonio, the center of a medical, social and educational complex which continues to open doors for the poor in Bahia and throughout Brazil. == The foundation of OSID == There, in 1960, the Santo Ant\u00f4nio Hospital, consisting of 150 beds, was inaugurated. On 26 May 1959 the Charitable Works Foundation of Sister Dulce was born, a result of the determination of a religious sister who was tireless in her attendance to the sick and to the beggars who lived on Salvador's streets. Sister Dulce's work impressed the President of Brazil, Jos\u00e9 Sarney, who in 1988 nominated her for the Nobel Peace Prize, with support of Queen Silvia of Sweden. The organization she founded, known by its Portuguese acronym as OSID (Obras Sociais Irm\u00e3 Dulce), is one of the most well-known and respected philanthropic organizations in Brazil. == OSID == The Charitable Works Foundation of Sister Dulce is a private charity chartered under Brazilian law. It is accredited at federal, state and municipal levels and registered by the National Welfare Council and the Federal Ministry of Education. OSID provides health, welfare and education services, with a strong commitment to medical education and research. The Santo Ant\u00f4nio Hospital is the largest completely free hospital in Brazil, according to the Federal Ministry of Health. It has over 1,000 beds and receives more than 3,000 patients every day. OSID also established CESA (Santo Ant\u00f4nio Educational Center), a school for the poor in Sim\u00f5es Filho, one of the most impoverished cities in the Metropolitan Area of Salvador and in the State of Bahia. There, OSID provides free educational programs for approximately 800 children and young people ranging in age from 6 to 19 years old. CESA offers basic education in accordance with the guidelines of the Brazilian Federal Ministry of Education. In addition, CESA has developed a complementary program of educational, physical and professional development activities to help students learn more effectively and enrich their lives. It also operates a commercial bakery and an orthopedic production center, staffed by professional workers, which produce and sell their products in many regions of Brazil and internationally, following the idea of self-sustainability which is part of the work concept created by Sister Dulce. == Health problems, death and burial == During the last 30 years of her life, Sister Dulce's lungs were highly impaired and she had only 30% breathing capacity. In 1990, her respiratory problems began to worsen and she was hospitalized. It was in her sick bed that she received the visit of Pope John Paul II (whom she had met, for the first time, in 1980). After being hospitalized for 16 months, Sister Dulce died on 13 March 1992, at the age of 77, in Santo Ant\u00f4nio's Convent, and she was buried at the Basilica of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. On 26 May 2000, her body was transferred to the Chapel of Santo Ant\u00f4nio Convent. On 9 June 2010, Sister Dulce was finally buried at the Imaculada Concei\u00e7\u00e3o da Madre de Deus church, in Salvador, Bahia. It was discovered that her body was naturally incorrupt and even her clothes were still preserved 18 years after her death. ==Canonization== Sister Dulce received the title Servant of God under Pope John Paul II with the beginning of the cause for her beatification in January 2000 under the Archbishop of Salvador da Bahia and Primate of Brazil, Geraldo Majella Agnelo. who examined her virtues, fame of sainthood and the tireless determination of a life dedicated to the needy. In June 2001 the process continued in the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints. In June 2003 the Congregation received the positio. At that same time, the Vatican formally recognized a miracle performed by the intercession of Sister Dulce. On 10 May 2007, in a meeting with Pope Benedict XVI during his visit to Brazil, the Governor of S\u00e3o Paulo and former Presidential candidate Jos\u00e9 Serra said he would send a letter to the Vatican in favor of Sister Dulce's beatification. On 20 January 2009, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints unanimously recommended to Pope Benedict XVI that he proclaim Sister Dulce's heroic virtue. Pope Benedict XVI approved and on 3 April 2009 granted her the title Venerable. Sister Dulce's body was exhumed and examined on 9 July 2010 as part of the beatification process, and was found to be still incorrupt. On 27 October 2010, the Archbishop of Salvador announced that the Congregation for the Causes of Saints had recognized a miracle attributed to her intersession, paving the way for her to be beatified. The pope officially approved on 10 December 2010. Sister Dulce was beatified in a Mass on 22 May 2011, in Salvador, Bahia. The Mass was presided over by the Archbishop of Salvador and the Primate of Brazil, Cardinal Geraldo Majella Agnelo, who conducted the beatification by mandate of Pope Benedict XVI; the service was attended by about 70,000 people. President Dilma Rousseff and Governor Jaques Wagner also attended. On 13 May 2019, Congregation of Saints Prefect Angelo Becciu approved a miracle needed to make her a saint. The decree recognizing the second miracle was then signed by Pope Francis, thus ensured that Sister Dulce would be canonized. It was announced on 1 July 2019 that Dulce would be canonized with four others on 13 October 2019.Irma Dulce, Nun of the Poor, Becomes 1st Brazilian Woman Saint making her the first Brazilian female saint. ==See also== == References == == Further reading == * Gaetano Passareli: Irm\u00e3 Dulce, o Anjo Bom da Bahia (Editora Record; ) * Nathan A Haverstock: Give us this day; the story of Sister Dulce, the angel of Bahia (Appleton-Century) == External links == * OSID's Website \u2013 Obras Sociais Irm\u00e3 Dulce - OSID * Video about Irm\u00e3 Dulce and OSID \u2013 Irm\u00e3 (Sister) Dulce - The Angel of Bahia & OSID Category:1914 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Brazilian Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Brazilian Roman Catholics Category:Brazilian philanthropists Category:Brazilian Roman Catholic saints Category:Franciscan saints Category:Incorrupt saints Category:Third Order Regular Franciscans Category:Roman Catholic activists Category:People from Salvador, Bahia Category:20th-century venerated Christians Category:Beatifications by Pope Benedict XVI Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope Benedict XVI Category:Canonizations by Pope Francis ",
