Previously, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also warned that Russia is interfering in the 2018 midterm election. In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on February 13, Coats noted that voting in some elections will begin as early as March 2018 for primaries. He stated: \"We need to inform the American public that this is real, that this is going to happen.\" At the same hearing, CIA Director Mike Pompeo told the committee that Russia has already been observed engaging in such tactics. ===March=== During a press conference in the White House on March 6, 2018, President Trump was questioned on the topic of possible interference in the upcoming midterm election, responding \u201cWe won\u2019t allow that to happen.

A July 15 Business Insider article revealed a new Russian intelligence-linked \"news\" site, USAReally,Roose, Kevin, Is a New Russian Meddling Tactic Hiding in Plain Sight?, New York Times, September 25, 2018 which follows in the footsteps of previous Russian IRA-backed troll farms, and appears to be an attempt to \"test the waters\" ahead of the mid-terms.
