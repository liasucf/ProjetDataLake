    "text": "Colwich railway station is a disused railway station in Staffordshire, England. Authorisation for a railway line between and was obtained in 1845 by the Trent Valley Railway. By 1847, the Trent Valley Railway company had been incorporated in the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) and the line was opened. A station opened at Colwich in September of that year and, like most of the stations on the Trent Valley Railway, it was designed by the architect John William Livock. In 1849, the railway line between Stone and Colwich was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR). At Colwich, the LNWR and NSR agreed to own and operate the station jointly; a situation that remained until both railways became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Local passenger services over the former NSR route were withdrawn in 1947 and all other services were withdrawn from Colwich in 1958, when the station was closed. The former stationmaster's house remains and is now a Grade II listed building. ==See also== *Colwich rail crash, which took place at the site of the station in 1986. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * * * * ==Further reading== * Category:Disused railway stations in Staffordshire Category:Former London and North Western Railway stations Category:Former North Staffordshire Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1958 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1847 Category:1847 establishments in England Category:John William Livock buildings ",
