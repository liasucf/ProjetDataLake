(\"May Our Daughters Return Home, Civil Association\") is a non-profit organization composed of mothers, family members, and friends of victims of the female homicides in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. The mothers claim that their cases have gone unsolved in some cases for over 12 years. Their hope is to get the murderers of their daughters arrested and hopefully convicted. ==Founding and purpose== The organization was co-founded by Norma Andrade, mother of Lilia Alejandra Garcia Andrade, who was kidnapped on February 14, 2001, and found dead 10 days later. The other founder of NHRC is Marisela Ortiz Rivera, Lilia's high school teacher turned activist. Many of the victims have been found to be poor working mothers employed in factories in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, which is located in the northwestern Mexican state of Chihuahua, and is located across the Rio Grande from the U.S. city of El Paso, Texas. Since 1993, female bodies have been found in the City of Juarez, and most of the cases remain unsolved. The group's mission is to put pressure on the Mexican government to fight impunity, solve the murders and counter-act the prevalence of femicide. ==Reception and danger== Norma Andrade was shot at 5 times in an attempt to silence her. As prominent advocate and President and co-founder of NHRC, her and other women live in danger in Ciudad Juarez.
