Koda Kumi is the second single released by Japanese DJ and music producer JHETT a.k.a YAKKO for AQUARIUS on March 9, 2005, and featured singer-songwriter Koda Kumi. The single was only released as a CD, which contained four songs, including a remix of the title track, along with its instrumental. JHETT had worked predominately in the underground hip hop scene, mainly with the group AQUARIUS. While having only released two singles, Just Go and the previous single Get Ready -Nite 2 Remember-, JHETT would go on to release three albums under the Avex label: JHETT, My Hood Iz... and Jhett Black Edition, all of which were released throughout 2005. The single contained two coupling tracks. It held the COLDFEET remix of \"Just Go\" and the song \"Leave It To Fate ~ubiquitous~\", which featured sample vocals from American funk and soul artist Roy Ayers. Along with the two b-sides, the single also held the instrumental for the title track. \"Just Go\" would be placed on the first disc of the album JHETT. The COLDFEET remix and the music video would be placed on the album Jhett Black Edition. In 2010, Koda Kumi would release the song on her fourth compilation album, Out Works & Collaboration Best as track No. 6. ==Background and composition== \"Just Go\" was written and composed by both JHETT and Lori Fine. The lyrical portion, however, was a collaborative effort between Fine and the featured artist, Koda Kumi. The song would be placed on JHETT's self- titled album. JHETT and Fine also composed the coupling track \"Leave It To Fate ~ubiquitous~\", while sampling vocals from funk and soul artist Roy Ayers. The remix of \"Just Go\" was performed by COLDFEET, and mixed by Yoshiaki Onishi. The remix would be placed on JHETT's third album, JHETT Black Edition (stylized as JHETT BLACK EDITION). \"Leave It To Fate\" would also receive a remix on the album.
