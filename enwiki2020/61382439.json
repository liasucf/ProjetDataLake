Margaret, Margery, or Madge Croft was a daughter of Sir Herbert Croft of Croft Castle and Mary Bourne, daughter and heiress of Anthony Bourne of Holt Castle. Worcestershire. Her father converted to Catholicism and died either in 1622 or in 1629, at Douai. Her brother Herbert Croft also converted but returned to the Church of England and became Bishop of Hereford. Margaret Croft or her sister Mary replied to her father's Catholic pamphleteering, and he responded in print with, Reply to the Answer of his Daughter M. C. which she made to a Paper of his sent to her concerning the Rom. Church (1619).James Doelman, King James I and the Religious Culture of England (Cambridge, 2000), pp. 109-10, supplies \"Mary Croft\". Her sister Mary Croft (b. 1598) married Richard Tomkyns of Monnington, and a letter of her cousin Brilliana Harley records a rumour she was involved in drafting an anti-Parliamentarian pamphlet of 1642, The Declaration or Resolution of the County of Hereforde.Rachel Adcock, Sara Read, Anna Ziomek, Flesh and Spirit: An anthology of seventeenth- century women's writing (Manchester, 2014), p. 130: Timothy Taylor Lewis, Letters of the Lady Brilliana Harley (Camden Society, London, 1854), pp. 182, 263. Lucy Croft married Sir Dudley Carleton, a diplomat at The Hague. Elizabeth Croft (d. 1622) married Sir Thomas Cave, and her portrait is shown at Croft Castle.Owen George Scudamore Croft, House of Croft of Croft Castle (Hereford, 1949), pp. 85, 88, 92-4. ==Working for the Queen of Bohemia== Croft was said to be the mistress of Philipp Moritz, Count of Hanau-M\u00fcnzenberg Croft became a maid of honour or lady in waiting to Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia in 1623. She was often known as \"Mrs Crofts\".Mary Anne Everett Green, Elizabeth Electress Palatine and Queen of Bohemia (London, 1909), pp. 260, 352. In 1625 Elizabeth wrote letters to John, Earl of Mar and Marie, Countess of Mar about one of their sons, perhaps Henry or Alexander, who had asked her if he could marry Croft, after she noticed their relationship. Elizabeth recommended Croft as \"an honest discreet woman and doth carie herself very well\".Mary Anne Everett Green, Elizabeth Electress Palatine and Queen of Bohemia (London, 1909), p. 423: HMC Mar & Kellie, vol. 1 (London, 1914), p. 179: HMC 4th Report, p. 527. No marriage ensued, Mar wrote to the queen in May 1626 that he could not have Alexander (or his seven brethren) marry according to her wishes.HMC Supplementary Treport Mar & Kellie (London, 1930), pp. 174-5, 240. Mar gave no particular reason in the letter, Lisa Jardine points to a disparity in status. Thereafter Croft became linked with members of the Dutch court, especially Constantijn Huygens.Lisa Jardine, Temptation in the Archives (UCL: London, 2015), pp. 4-6, 102-118: A. Worp (ed.), De Briefwisseling van Constantijn Huygens, Deel I, 1608-1634 (The Hague, 1911), nos. 364, 369, 463, 695, 823. Croft was probably the author of a humorous account of a tour of North Holland taken by Elizabeth and Amalia van Solms in the summer of 1625. The account, written in French, was said to have been taken from a letter written in cipher from a maid of honour to her cousin in England.The French text is printed in Martin Royalton-Kisch, Adriaen Van de Venne's Album: In the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum (London, 1988), and with an English translation in Lisa Jardine, Temptation in the Archive (London, 2015), pp. 108-119. The narrative is very different from formal accounts of royal progresses, and Elizabeth Dudley, Countess of L\u00f6wenstein, a daughter of John Dudley, features in several comic episodes.Lisa Jardine, Temptation in the Archives (UCL: London, 2015), pp. 6-15: Mary Anne Everett Green, Elizabeth Electress Palatine and Queen of Bohemia (London, 1909), pp. 245-247. Croft has been identified as the mistress of \"H\", Philipp Moritz, Count of Hanau-M\u00fcnzenberg, described in Frederick's letters.Nadine Akkerman, The Correspondence of Elizabeth Stuart Queen of Bohemia, vol. 2 (Oxford, 2012), pp. 126-8, 142-3: Lisa Jardine, 'In Search of the \"Real\" Doroth\u00e9e van Dorp', De Zeventiende Eeuw, 25 (2009), pp. 44-6. Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine, Elizabeth's son, put in a good word for Croft's brother Herbert Croft with the Archbishop of Canterbury at Oxford in August 1636.Nadine Akkerman, The Correspondence of Elizabeth Stuart Queen of Bohemia, vol. 2 (Oxford, 2012), pp. 519-520. ==Disgrace and Death== She returned to England in 1637. She had offended Elizabeth, who wanted the exact reasons for her dismissal kept secret, partly because they would prejudice Croft's chances of getting a reward from King Charles and partly to prevent their public airing, and told them to Sir Richard Cave, rather than put them in a letter.Nadine Akkerman, The Correspondence of Elizabeth Stuart Queen of Bohemia, vol. 2 (Oxford, 2012), pp. 594, 643. Charles Louis wrote to Elizabeth, his mother, on 24 May 1637 from Whitehall Palace, mentioning an old quarrel he had with Croft, that she had fallen out with his sister Elisabeth of the Palatinate and that recently she had told Lord Craven he was rude to her. In a second letter of 12 June 1637 from Greenwich Palace he described how Croft in conversation with Lady Carlisle had \"well stitched\" most the characters of Elizabeth's court at The Hague with \"censure sharp enough\". He wanted her to stay in London where she could do less harm. There was already a troublesome rumour that another lady in waiting, Elizabeth Dudley, Countess of L\u00f6wenstein, had boxed his sister Elisabeth's ear in the Prince of Orange's garden.Mary Anne Everett Green, Elizabeth Electress Palatine and Queen of Bohemia (London, 1909), p. 352: George Bromley, A Collection of Original Royal Letters (London, 1787), pp. 85, 87-9: Nadine Akkerman, The Correspondence of Elizabeth Stuart Queen of Bohemia, vol. 2 (Oxford, 2012), pp. 602-3, 605-6, suggests the censure was in verses. She died in London in 1637 and was buried in Westminster Abbey on 14 December 1637. In her will she hoped the Queen of Bohemia would settle her debts at The Hague amounting to \u00a3100. In London she owed Mr Berry in Paternoster Row for white satin for a waistcoat and mohair for a gown.Joseph Lemuel Chester, Westminster Abbey Registers: Harleian Society, vol. 10 (London, 1869), pp. 64, 132, citing 'Will of Margery Crofts', TNA PROB 11/177/290: Owen George Scudamore Croft, House of Croft of Croft Castle (Hereford, 1949), p. 92-3 quoting TNA PROB 11/177/290. ==References== * Portrait of Margaret Croft's sister, Elizabeth Croft, Lady Cave, at Croft Castle, National Trust * Huygen's letters to Margaret Croft, Huygens ING Category:1637 deaths Category:16th-century English people Category:17th- century English people Category:Burials at Westminster Abbey Category:British maids of honour Category:English courtiers Category:17th-century English women writers Category:People from Herefordshire ",
