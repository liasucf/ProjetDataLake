Otakar took his first musical lessons from educator and forester Franti\u0161ek Du\u0161ek, who taught him the violin for five years, and the piano for a year. His father doubted his son's talent and sent him to the Higher Industrial School in Brno, where Otakar failed in the second year. So he started to learn brewing in Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto na Morav\u011b. After training, he became a brewer in the brewery in Maffersdorf near Liberec (today Vratislavice nad Nisou). In the brewery he started a band, with great success. During his work in the brewery, he enrolled in the first year of the Prague Conservatory. He studied Pipe organ and composition, where his teachers were Josef Kli\u010dka and Karel Stecker. He continued to master the piano with Josef Jir\u00e1nek, and in 1911 he passed the state exam in piano. Then, he taught piano privately, and harmony, and became a choirmaster of the \"\u0160kroup\" choir. He married Libu\u0161i Ichov\u00e1. In 1919 he became a teacher of theoretical subjects at the Conservatory. A year later in 1920, he was appointed a professor of theory at the Conservatory. One of his students was Stefania Turkewich. His composer's work is based on the music of V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nov\u00e1k and Josef Suk. Studying the scores of these masters led him to the theoretical problems of harmony in 20th century music. He produced several theoretical writings in which he published significant theoretical discoveries, the textbooks Upln\u00e1 nauka o harmonii na z\u00e1klad\u0115 melodie a rytmu (A Complete Harmony Course on the Basis of Melody and Rhythm; 1922; 6th ed., rev., 1949), Nauka o kontrapunktit, imitaci a fuge (Counterpoint, Imitation and Fugue; 1936; second ed., 1945), and V\u0161eobecn\u00e1 nauka o hudb\u00e9 (A General Music Course; 1949; completed by F. Barto\u0161 and K. Jane\u010dek). For his theoretical and musical work he was elected a full member of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Art in 1928 and twice won the State Prize (1930 and 1937). He died in Prague on 21 January 1943. He was buried in the Fry\u0161avsk\u00fd cemetery. ==Compositions== ORCH.: 2 symphonic poems: Tillotama (1908) and King Menkera (1916\u201318); Radio Overture (1936); 3 CzechDances for Orch.
