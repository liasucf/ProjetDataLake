He appeared in 41 NHL games, recording an assist and 14 penalty minutes. Prior to making his NHL debut Bartel played for the Canadian national team at the 1984 Winter Olympics. ==Playing career== A stay-at-home defender, Bartel played at the University of Saskatchewan before joining the Canadian National Team for the 1983\u201384 season and representing Canada at the 1984 Winter Olympics. Never drafted, Bartel signed with the Calgary Flames and spent two seasons in their organization, appearing in a single NHL game for the Flames in 1985\u201386. Released by the Flames, Bartel signed as a free agent with the Vancouver Canucks for the 1986\u201387 season and stuck with the team as a depth defender, appearing in 40 games and recording a single assist. However, he would lose his spot the following year and spend the entire season in the minors. After another stint with the Canadian National Team and a year in Britain, Bartel retired in 1990. He played two games in the American Hockey League with the St. John's Maple Leafs during the 1993\u201394 AHL season. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| ! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| ! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season ! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| ! colspan=\"5\"|Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
