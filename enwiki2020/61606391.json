Established in 1891, it is on the grounds of Sebastian County's first poor farm, purchased by the county in 1890. It remained in use at least into the 1940s, and is the only surviving visible element of the poor farm. The cemetery contains several hundred graves, although only seven have markers. The cemetery is about in size, and is an unbounded open field in a suburban residential area. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Sebastian County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Cemeteries on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1891 Category:Buildings and structures in Fort Smith, Arkansas Category:Protected areas of Sebastian County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Sebastian County, Arkansas ",
