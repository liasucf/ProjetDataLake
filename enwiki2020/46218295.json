Probably his father was also named Juan de Talavera, and he was a nephew of Andr\u00e9s de Talavera, both working in the Cathedral of Seville circa 1450. Juan de Talavera married Maria Gutierrez, daughter of Egas Coeman or Egas of Brussels and he was probably also a nephew of Juan Guas by his wife.(with English abstract).

Juan de Talavera belonged to the \"Toledo School of Architecture\". His most valuable work is the facade of the University of Salamanca, also called the Puerta Rica (Rich Door) or Royal Facade, probably made with other partners on behalf of the Queen Joanna of Castile called \"the Mad\".
