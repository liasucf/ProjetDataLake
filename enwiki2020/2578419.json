    "text": "\"The Ballroom Blitz\" (often called \"Ballroom Blitz\") is a song by the British glam rock band The Sweet, written by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman. The song reached number one in Canada, number two in the UK Singles Chart and the Australian Chart, and number five on the US Billboard Hot 100. ==Background== \"The Ballroom Blitz\" was inspired by an incident on 27 January 1973 when the band were performing at the Grand Hall in Kilmarnock, Scotland, and were driven offstage by a bottling. == History and description == The song was recorded at Audio International Studio, 18 Rodmarton Street, London, and released as a single in September 1973. The song appeared on the US and Canadian versions of Desolation Boulevard but never appeared on a Sweet album in the UK, other than hits compilations. The initial guitar and drum riff of the song has similarity to a 1963 song by Bobby Comstock called \"Let's Stomp\". ==Cover versions== The first cover of \"The Ballroom Blitz\" was by the Les Humphries Singers in 1974, the first German single to reach #1 in New Zealand. In 1979, the song was covered by the Damned, which featured Lemmy from Mot\u00f6rhead on bass guitar. It was released as a B-side to \"I Just Can't Be Happy Today\" and featured as a bonus track on their CD reissue of Machine Gun Etiquette. Other covers include Krokus in 1984, the Surf Punks on their 1988 album Oh No! Not Them Again (in the lyrics jacket it just says, \"You should know the words by now\"), Japanese glam rock band Scanch on their 1991 album Ultra Romantic Bombers for Unlimited Lovers under the title of \"R&R; Dynamite Kyoujidai\", thrash metal band Nuclear Assault on their 1991 album Out of Order, Tia Carrere featuring a back track featuring Tommy Nickerson on the soundtrack to Wayne's World in 1992, and Christian rock band Calibretto 13 on their album Enter the Danger Brigade in 2000. In 2016, The Struts recorded it for the soundtrack of film The Edge of Seventeen. In 2017, the Featherz covered the song on their debut album Five Year Itch.
