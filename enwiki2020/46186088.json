    "text": "Mitochondrial import inner membrane translocase subunit TIM16 also known as presequence translocated-associated motor subunit PAM16, mitochondria- associated granulocyte macrophage CSF-signaling molecule, or presequence translocated-associated motor subunit PAM16 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PAM16 gene. == Structure == The PAM16 gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 16 at position 13.3 and it spans 11,150 base pairs. The PAM16 gene produces a 15.1 kDa protein composed of 137 amino acids. The structure has been found to contain a 21-residue mitochondrial targeting leader sequence. == Function == The PAM16 gene encodes for a mitochondrial protein with multiple functions. It is responsible for the regulation of ATP- dependent protein translocation into the mitochondrial matrix, inhibition of DNAJC19 stimulation of HSPA9/Mortalin ATPase activity, and granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling. Furthermore, PAM16 plays a role in the import of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins into the mitochondrial matrix and may be important in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. ==Clinical Significance== Mutations in the PAM16 gene has been shown to cause mitochondrial deficiencies and associated disorders. It is mainly associated with Megarbane-Dagher-Melike type spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, which is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by pre- and postnatal short stature, developmental delay, dysmorphic facial appearance, narrow chest, prominent abdomen, platyspondyly, short limbs, and other abnormalities of the skeleton. == Interactions == PAM16 has been known to interact with PAM18, DNAJC19, TIMM17A, FEZ1, TRIM25, MARC1, and other proteins. == References == == Further reading == * * * ",
