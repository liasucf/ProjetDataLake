    "text": "The National Student Drama Festival (or NSDF) was founded in 1956 by the Sunday Times arts columnist Kenneth Pearson, the Sunday Times theatre critic Harold Hobson, and National Union of Students president Frank Copplestone. Pearson became the organisation's first artistic director. Early supporters also included Sunday Times Editor Harry Hodson and Professor Glynne Wickham, a leading pioneer of the academic discipline of drama based at the University of Bristol. NSDF is an annual festival of theatre from young people across the country. It is for anyone aged between 16 - 25. 14 productions are presented, selected through the year from across the country. There are over 100 workshops, led by practitioners and industry professionals from leading theatre companies (such as Frantic Assembly, Complicite, and the RSC), drama schools (such as LAMDA, Rose Bruford and Bristol Old Vic), and independent artists (such as Chris Thorpe, Alexandra Spencer Jones, Project O, Tinuke Craig and Brigitte Aphrodite). The festival is supported by 60 young people on the technical team, providing hands on experience and training and 30 on the management team, developing skills in producing, venue and FoH management and arts administration. A daily magazine, Noises Off, written by FestGoers, both online and in print is also a key part of the festival. Late night entertainment, like the Cabaret (where anyone at the Festival can perform), parties and a pub quiz. An important part of the festival is providing relaxed social spaces long into the evening, where students can meet and talk with each other and network with the visiting artists and professionals. ==Key Figures== ===Festival Directors=== * 1971 to 2000 - Clive Wolfe * 2001 to 2003 - Nick Stimson * 2004 to 2006 - Andrew Loretto * 2007 to 2012 - Holly Kendrick * 2013 to 2018 - Michael Brazier * 2019 - James PhillipsNSDF Team https://www.nsdf.org.uk/about-us/the-team ===Noises Off Editors=== * 1980 to 1990 - Stephen Jeffreys (latterly in tandem with Nick Phillips) * 1991 to 2002 - Ian Shuttleworth * 2003 to 2004 - Andrew Haydon and Rachel Smyth * 2005 to 2009 - Andrew Haydon * 2010 - Phil Mann and Claire Tr\u00e9vien * 2011 - Andrew Haydon, Phil Mann and Claire Tr\u00e9vien * 2012 - Phil Mann, Andrew Haydon, and Claire Tr\u00e9vien * 2013 to 2014 - Andrew Haydon * 2015 - Jake Orr * 2016 to 2017 - Richard Tzanov * 2018 - Kate Wyver ===Notable Participants=== * Erica Whyman * Rosemary Squire * Stephen Fry * Abbi Greenland and Helen Goalen (RASHDASDH) * Carrie Cracknell * Ruth Wilson * Lena Headey * Wole Soyinka * Sandi Toksvig * Caryl Churchill * Tim Fountain * Nick Hern * Biyi Bandele * Terry Hands * Nona Shepphard (director) * Michael Boyd * Robin Duval * Sam Steiner (playwright) * Braham Murray * Olivia Vinall (actor) * Khalid Abdalla * Nikki Amuka-Bird * Michael Attenborough * Van Badham * Patrick Barlow * Simon Russell Beale * Lorna Bennett * Michael Billington * David Farr * Mark Gatiss * Buzz Goodbody * Robert Hewison * Harold Hobson * Angus Imrie * Stephen Jeffreys * Martin Jenkins * Alex Jennings * Daniel Kitson * Roger Michell * John Nettles * Cyril Nri * Steve Pemberton * Ronald Pickup * Tim Pigott-Smith * Harold Pinter * Pete Postlethwaite * Lucy Prebble * Mark Ravenhill * Jan Sayer * Prunella Scales * Tim Supple * Meera Syal * Polly Teale * Richard Thomas * Glen Walford * Timothy West * Clive Wolfe * Alan Yentob * Dmytro Morykit == Prize Winners == At the end of the festival there is a Closing Ceremony where prizes are presented.
