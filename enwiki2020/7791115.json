    "text": "The Village at Orange is a shopping mall located in Orange, California, formerly called The Mall of Orange and at first, officially (and later, popularly) the Orange Mall. The mall is currently anchored by Sears on the south side and a Walmart on the north side. == History == A standalone Sears store opened at the location, Tustin at Meats, in 1967. In 1970, plans for a mall to be added to the Sears emerged. The center, on a 63-acre site, would cost $30 million and would be called the Orange Mall. The developer was Harry Newman, Jr., president of Newman Properties (Long Beach) and president of the International Council of Shopping Centers. The architect was Ainsworth & McClellan (Pasadena). The Broadway would be 167,500 sq. ft. and the Sears, 273,500 sq. ft. in size, with the mall's total size being 900,000 sq. ft., 80 retail stores, and parking for 4,700 cars. It was the first mall in Southern California with carpeting throughout it. The mall opened on August 16, 1971. In 1977, the Woolworth's store closed and was replaced by a small JCPenney store. The Broadway closed in 1996 due to the chain being purchased by Macy's and the site was torn down for a Walmart. The center completed a $57 million renovation in 2003. The densely populated trade area has over 1.6 million people residing in a radius. A Sprouts Farmers Market opened in July 2009, replacing the Linens 'n Things store that went out of business as part of the chain's nationwide store closings. There is a nearby Target but is not part of the Village. A renovation began in 2015.http://www.ocregister.com/articles/mall-671859-vestar-axtell.html JCPenney closed on July 31, 2017 as part of the chain's plan to close 138 under-performing stores. == References == == External links == * Category:Shopping malls in Orange County, California Category:Buildings and structures in Orange, California Category:Economy of Orange, California Category:Shopping malls established in 1971 ",
