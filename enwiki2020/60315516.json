Francisco Moraz\u00e1n's regime was toppled by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Alfaro Zamora. Zamora as interim ruler, on April 5, 1843, convened a Constitutional Assembly that was officially established on June 1 of that year and drafted the Constitution that would be in force until 1847 when, Alfaro again, summons a new Constituent. It was the first constitution to expressly establish ministries, these were; of Office, of Interior, Foreign and Interior Relations and of Treasury and War. Although it does not specified its functions. The Legislative Branch was bicameral and the Head of State will be replaced by the President of the Senate in case of death, illness or destitution. It also institutes the San Juan de Dios Hospital and its Charity Board that would eventually be transformed into the Social Protection Board. It also establishes education as a right of Costa Ricans and as a duty of the State to grant it by putting all the means at its disposal to provide it. The dissatisfaction with the Constitution of 1844 by the military led to the coup of 1846 and this in turn to the drafting of the Constitution \"corrected\" of 1847. ==References== Category:Constitutions of Costa Rica ",
