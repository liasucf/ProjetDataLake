    "text": "The Gj\u00f8vik Line () is a Norwegian railway line between Oslo and Gj\u00f8vik. It was originally named the North Line (Nordbanen) and ran between Grefsen and R\u00f8ykenvik. The line was completed to Gj\u00f8vik in 1902. The Gj\u00f8vik Line was one of the first lines of the Norwegian railway system which was to be contracted on public service obligation, but it was the state owned Norges Statsbaner which won it through its subsidiary NSB Anbud. ==The line== The lines is the smallest and least trafficked railway line from Oslo, and the only single track line in the capital. Like most other Norwegian railway lines, the entire 124 km long line is electrified at . It serves some of the northern neighborhoods of Oslo, and has a few stations in the woods of Nordmarka. Further north the line serves the municipality of Nittedal. At Roa, the Roa\u2013H\u00f8nefoss Line branches off to H\u00f8nefoss, where it continues as the Bergen Line. Formerly, most trains between Oslo and Bergen used this route, but nowadays most passenger trains run on the route through Drammen, which is slightly longer but which runs through more densely populated areas. Freight trains use the line over Roa, and sometimes passenger trains also use this line as a reserve line if the route from H\u00f8nefoss to Oslo via Drammen is temporarily closed. Further north, the Gj\u00f8vik Line runs through the district of Toten before ending at Gj\u00f8vik. The Gj\u00f8vik Line formerly had three branch lines, the R\u00f8ykenvik Line, the Valdres Line and the Skreia Line. All these lines are now closed. Most of the service on the Gj\u00f8vik Line is provided by electric multiple units. The passenger routes are served by the newly (2006) redesigned Type 69D multiple units named Type 69G, rebuilt in Denmark by Danske Statsbaner (DSB). ==External links== *The Norwegian National Rail Administration's list of stations on the Gj\u00f8vik Line Nygard Station Raufoss Station Lunner Station Grefsen Station Category:Railway lines in Innlandet Category:Railway lines in Oslo Category:Railway lines in Viken Category:Railway lines opened in 1902 Category:Electric railways in Norway Category:1902 establishments in Norway ",
