    "text": "Tomiris is a 2019 Kazakhstani feature film directed by Akan Sataev, which tells the story about the queen of the Massagetae Tomyris and the king of Persia Cyrus the Great. The premiere of the film took place in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan on September 25, 2019. == Plot == The film is based on the story of Herodotus about the death of the Persian King Cyrus the Great during the war with Massagetae, which was commanded by the queen Tomiris. == Cast == * Almira Tursyn - Tomiris * Aizhan LighG - Sardana * Gassan Massoud - Cyrus * Berik Aitzhanov - Kurtun * Adil Akhmetov - Argun * Erkebulan Dayirov - Kharasp * Azamat Satibaldi - Kavaz Almira Tursyn, a psychologist, was chosen from 15 thousand people to play the role of Tomyris. She took professional lessons of horseriding, archery and also learned to use swords and knives. == Production == The film was ordered by the Ministry of Culture and Sports. The idea of a film about Queen Tomiris was come up by Aliya Nazarbayeva. Filming began in December 2017 and scenes were shot in different parts of Kazakhstan. The Massagetae heroes speak the ancient Turkic language, while the Persian heroes speak ancient Persian in the film. ==Release== The film was theatrically released in Kazakhstan on October 1, 2019. The distribution rights of the film were sold to Blue Swan for Italy, SND Films for France, Art Mood for Spain, AT Entertainment for Japan, Gulf Film for Middle East, Challan for South Korea, Paradise/MGN for CIS, Shaw for Singapore, Program 4 Media for Romania, Siyah Bayez Movies for Turkey, and Well Go USA for the United States. == Critical response == The film received mixed reviews. This is probably because Herodotus's version of events is not generally accepted by historians and researchers, and unlike in the film, Massagetae are not considered Turkic, but Iranian-speaking people. Criticism came from both the Kazakh and Iranian public. Some observers believed that the film was aimed to make Dariga Nazarbayeva\u2019s potential presidential bid in the future, the daughter of Kazakhstan\u2019s former leader Nursultan Nazarbayev, more acceptable among ordinary Kazakhs. The film won the Nouveau Genre Great Prize at France\u2019s 2020 L\u2019\u00c9trange Festival. ==References== ==External links== * * * *Tomyris at The Numbers Category:2019 films Category:2019 drama films Category:2010s historical drama films Category:Kazakhstani films ",
