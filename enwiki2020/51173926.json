    "text": "DC's Young Animal is a \"pop-up\" imprint of DC Comics started in 2016.\"DC Expands Beyond Superheroes with Young Animal,\" Comic Vine. Retrieved August 15, 2016 It was developed in collaboration with Gerard Way, an American musician and comic book writer, author of The Umbrella Academy. Its main focus is to relaunch characters and settings from the DC Universe in stories for mature readers, done with a more experimental approach than DC's primary line of superhero comics. The line has been overseen by Vertigo group editor Jamie S. Rich and executive editor Mark Doyle. Gerard Way has said that a shared theme of the Young Animal comics is \"relationships between parents and children.\" Other themes he has cited are alienation, fame, change (\"self- actualization and becoming something else\"), as well as bullying, teenagers and drug use (in Shade, the Changing Girl), and eventually \"a lot of personal stuff for me in Doom Patrol that deals with mature themes\". == History == The imprint launched in late 2016 with four ongoing series: Doom Patrol, Shade the Changing Girl, Cave Carson Has a Cybernetic Eye, and Mother Panic; followed in 2017 by a 6-issue limited series Bug! The Adventures of Forager. In the middle of 2018 was a five-part crossover involving members of the Justice League, which was called Milk Wars. Three of the series were then relaunched as Shade the Changing Woman, Cave Carson Has an Interstellar Eye, and Mother Panic: Gotham A.D., running for 6 issues under those names, along with the new title Eternity Girl, which also ran for 6 issues. The line was placed on hold in August 2018, with the 12th issue of the delayed Doom Patrol series going on sale the following October. In April 2019, DC announced that Doom Patrol would resume in July, and would then be joined by two new titles. == Titles == * Shade, the Changing Girl \u2013 by Cecil Castellucci and Marley Zarcone \u2013 is based on the earlier Vertigo series Shade, the Changing Man. It is about an alien who is obsessed with a discontinued line of missions to Earth using a \"Madness Cloak\".
