The CCC provided work for the unemployed young men of the Great Depression. Camp S-75-PA was one of many such camps spread throughout Pennsylvania. The young men of CCC Company 310 worked to clear the regrowing forests of brush to prevent forest fires. They also constructed roads throughout the forests, built state park facilities, constructed bridges on the state roads, planted trees for reforestation, and cleaned streams. Camp S-75-PA was built by the men in the summer, fall and winter of 1933. The camp was in such a remote area that electricity was not available. Later, a generating plant was installed to provide the camp with electricity and a reservoir was built to supply the camp's water needs. Much of the camp was destroyed by the extensive flooding of the West Branch Susquehanna River in 1936, but some traces remain as a reminder of the days of Camp S-75-PA. Hyner Run State Park was opened to the public in 1958. It originally included a swimming pool and bathhouse. As well as a concession area, picnic facilities and restrooms. The camping area was opened in 1975. ==Recreation== ===Fishing and hunting=== Hyner Run is stocked annually by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission with brook and brown trout.
