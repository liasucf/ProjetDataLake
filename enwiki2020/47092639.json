    "text": "The 2015 Graz attack occurred on 20 June 2015, when the perpetrator, identified as Alen Rizvanovi\u0107, drove a sports utility vehicle at high speeds through the center of Graz, Austria, killing three people in a matter of minutes and injuring 36 others, some of them seriously. At one point during the attack, Rizvanovi\u0107 got out of the vehicle and stabbed passers-by. He was later arrested by police. == Attack == On 20 June 2015, a vehicular attack occurred at 12:15 p.m. in the center of the Austrian city of Graz. Alen Rizvanovi\u0107, the driver, intentionally killed and injured pedestrians and cyclists by hitting them with a green SUV-type Daewoo Rexton, which he was driving at an estimated speed of up to per hour. According to a spokesperson, the rampage started in Zweiglgasse, where one victim died. Rizvanovi\u0107 then drove through the city, passing over the Sch\u00f6naugasse bridge and entering Herrengasse, where he killed two more people. He then crashed into a caf\u00e9 seating area in the Hauptplatz (main square), where an event related to the 2015 Austrian Grand Prix was being held. During his attack, Rizvanovi\u0107 jumped briefly out of his car, ran up to an elderly couple in front of a grocery shop, and stabbed them with a knife, wounding the man severely. He then drove to a police station at Schmiedgasse and was arrested by police without resistance. A witness compared the sounds of chairs and tables being knocked over by the vehicle to a \"gunfight\". The attack lasted for five minutes. Sixty ambulances and four helicopters were sent to transport injured victims to hospitals. === Victims === Three people were immediately killed in the attack and a total of 36 others, including three children, were wounded, six of them seriously and one critically. All of the casualties were hit by Rizvanovi\u0107's car, with the exception of a couple, who were stabbed by Rizvanovi\u0107 when he got out of the car. == Perpetrator == Alen Rizvan Rizvanovi\u0107, was 26-year-old when he carried out the attack. At the age of four he had fled along with his parents to Austria during the Bosnian War as a refugee and he later became an Austrian citizen. Rizvanovi\u0107 eventually found employment as a truck driver. He was under a restraining order filed on 28 May, which kept him away from the home of his wife and two young children following a domestic violence report being filed against him a month prior. As a result of the restraining order, police revoked Rizvanovi\u0107's weapon's licence and confiscated a semiautomatic firearm and ammunition belonging to him. The motive was not immediately clear, but a few hours after the attack, police ruled out any religious or ideological motives. When he was arrested, Rizvanovi\u0107 claimed that he felt persecuted by \"Turks\". On 23 June, a remand was imposed on him. The previous day, it was reported by Austrian newspaper Die Presse that the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism is \"interested in Rizvanovi\u0107\". There are claims that Rizvanovi\u0107 had shifted to a stricter interpretation of Islam. Prior to the attack, he had more than 2,500 followers on Twitter, many of them from Arab countries and at least one a suspected neo- Nazi, but he deleted all of the tweets and messages on his online accounts, except for one, which indicated that the crime was premeditated and not the deed of a mentally ill person. ==Conviction== Perpetrator was tried and convicted in 2016. == Reactions == A place for condolences in the Herrengasse, in front of the Grazer Stadtpfarr Church (22. June 2015). Austrian President Heinz Fischer issued a statement and said he was \"deeply shocked\" by the attack. Johanna Mikl-Leitner, the Austrian Interior Minister, said during a visit to the scene of the attack, \"What happened here is unthinkable. There is no excuse for it.\" Styria governor Hermann Sch\u00fctzenh\u00f6fer issued a statement, saying, \"We are shocked and dismayed...here is no explanation and no excuse for this attack.\" Graz mayor Siegfried Nagl, who witnessed the rampage unfold, ordered events in Graz to be canceled and black flags of mourning to be raised above municipal buildings. == References == Category:2015 in Austria Category:Attacks in 2015 2015 attack Category:Murders by motor vehicle Category:June 2015 crimes Category:June 2015 events in Europe Category:Murder in Austria Category:Vehicular rampage in Europe Category:2015 crimes in Austria Category:2015 murders in Europe Category:2010s murders in Austria ",
