    "text": "Abba Gumel is a Foundation Professor of Mathematics at Arizona State University. His main research interests are in mathematical biology, nonlinear dynamic systems and computational mathematics. He held administrative positions such as the Deputy Director of Mathematical and Computational Modeling Sciences Center, Arizona State University, Director, Institute of Industrial Mathematical Sciences and the Secretary of Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematical Society. ==Biography== Gumel received B.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Bayero University (Kano, Nigeria) and Brunel University London (England), respectively. He was a Full Professor in the Department of Mathematics, University of Manitoba, before becoming Foundation Professor of Mathematics at Arizona State University in 2014. He uses mathematical theories and methodologies to gain insights into the qualitative behaviour of non- linear dynamical systems arising from the mathematical modelling of phenomena in the natural and engineering sciences, with emphasis on the transmission dynamics and control of emerging and re-emerging human (and other animal) diseases of public health and socio-economic interest. Gumel was elected Fellow of the African Academy of Sciences in 2009. He was also elected Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Science in February 2010. He received the 2009 Dr. Lindsay E. Nicolle Award for excellent paper published in the Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases & Medical Microbiology. Professor Gumel has written over 150 peer-reviewed research publications, numerous book chapters and edited three books. ==Books== * Abba B. Gumel.

He was appointed as an extraordinary Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, University of Pretoria, South Africa for 2015-2018 and re- appointed for 2019-2021. == Awards and recognition== *Appointed Founding Fellow, ASU-Santa Fe Institute Center for Biosocial Complex Systems (January 2015). *Appointed Extraordinary Professor, Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, University of Pretoria, South Africa (2015-2021). *Merit Award for research excellence in 2011, given by the University of Manitoba and the University of Manitoba Faculty Association (given in May 2012). Eight awards are given each year, under the research category, throughout the campus. *Merit Award for research excellence in 2010, given by the University of Manitoba and the University of Manitoba Faculty Association (given in June 2011). *Elected Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Science (FAS): 2010. *Elected Fellow of the African Academy of Sciences (FAAS): 2009. *Received the 2009 Lindsay E. Nicolle Award for the best paper published in the Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases and Medical Microbiology. June 2009, Toronto, Canada. (The award, given annually, is for an author who has made a significant contribution to infectious diseases and medical microbiology, as demonstrated by the impact of their original research published in the journal). *Merit Award for research excellence in 2008, given by the University of Manitoba and the University of Manitoba Faculty Association (given in June 2009). *University of Manitoba award for Outstanding Outreach, December 2008 (one award is given each year). *Merit Award for research excellence in 2007, given by the University of Manitoba and the University of Manitoba Faculty Association (given in June 2008). *Rh.
