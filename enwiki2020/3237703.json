    "text": "Albert (Latin Albertus; - 22 September 1318), called the Fat (pinguis), was duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. The second son of Albert the Tall, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, Albert was a boy when his father died in 1279. He was first under guardianship of his uncle, Conrad, Prince-Bishop of Verden, and then of his elder brother, Henry I, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. In 1286 the three brothers divided their father's Principality of Wolfenb\u00fcttel; Albert received the areas around G\u00f6ttingen, Minden, Northeim, Calenberg, and Hanover. He made G\u00f6ttingen his residence, thus Principality of G\u00f6ttingen. In 1292, the third brother, William, died childless, and Albert and Henry, who had received the Principality of Grubenhagen, quarrelled about William's share, the remaining belittled areas around Brunswick and Wolfenb\u00fcttel; Albert finally prevailed. ==Family== Albert married Rixa, daughter of Henry I, Prince of Werle and Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow, and Rikissa Birgersdotter from Sweden, in 1284.
