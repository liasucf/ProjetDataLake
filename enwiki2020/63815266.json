    "text": "{| |} Emu (II), later Brightside, was an iron paddle steamer that operated on the Brisbane River, Moreton Bay, and on Sydney Harbour. The vessel was originally built in 1865 as Emu by A & J Inglis of Glasgow. She was imported in sections and assembled at Kangaroo Point, Brisbane. She had two inverted diagonal steam engines, providing 70 hp and capable of pushing her to 10 knots. ==Service history== Emu was originally owned by Queensland Steam Navigation Company and used on the Brisbane River and Moreton Bay. She was later used on Port Phillip and was brought to Sydney in 1868. She was run by the Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company on Sydney Harbour on the Manly run from January 1877 serving alongside ferries PS Brighton, Sydney's biggest paddle steamer, and Fairlight. The company renamed her Brightside in 1887. In June 1897, she sank at Neutral Bay and was returned to service that year after being converted to a cargo vessel in 1902. She continued working the Manly route until 1908 when she was gutted by fire. The hull was converted to a lighter, and broken up in 1909. Her engines were used in a sawmill. ==Gallery== File:Brisbane and Sydney ferry EMU later BRIGHTSIDE at Ipswich Queensland 1865 - 1877.jpg|As Emu in Ipswich, between 1865 and 1877 File:South end Circular Quay Sydney N.S.W.
