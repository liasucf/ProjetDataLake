Flitwick was summoned to Parliament for the Bedfordshire constituency on 8 Jul 1313 and again on 23 Sep 1313. The Inquisition post mortem held in 1353 found Flitwick to have been in possession of the manor of Flitwick in Bedfordshire and another in 1355 determined he also held Brendhall manor in Harlow, Essex and Ringstead (Ringstone?) and Leasingham manors in Lincolnshire and parcels of land at Anwick, Haconby and Killingholme. ==Family== Flitwick was succeeded by Eleanor. His sister, Lucy, married William Marmion. ==References== Category:English people of the Wars of Scottish Independence Category:People knighted at the Feast of the Swans Category:Knights of the Bath Category:English knights Category:13th-century English people Category:English MPs 1313 Category:1281 births Category:People from Flitwick Category:1353 deaths ",
