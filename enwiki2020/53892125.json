She is perhaps best known as a performer in the 1921 Broadway hit, Shuffle Along, the show that launched the careers of Josephine Baker and Florence Mills. ==Biography== Lottie Gee was born in Millboro, Virginia, United States. Her career began as a dancer in Aida Overton Walker's shows. She appeared in The Red Moon by Aida Overton Walker in 1904 and later toured the vaudeville circuit in various acts. In 1910, composer Ford Dabney (1883\u20131958) formed several touring vaudeville groups, among which, he and violinist Willie Carroll (n\u00e9 William Thomas Carroll; 1881\u20131943) conceived and produced Dabney's Ginger Girls, a duet composed of Gee, as dancer and soprano, and Effie King, as dancer and contralto. They initially performed at Dabney's Theater in Washington, D.C., before going on the road. Effie King was the stage name of Anna Green (maiden; 1888\u20131944), who in 1907, married actor Frank Henry Wilson (1885\u20131956). Gee sang the song \"I'm Just Wild About Harry\" in the musical Shuffle Along in 1921. Gee appeared in The Chocolate Dandies (1924).
