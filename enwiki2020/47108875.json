    "text": "Each clue in a Jumble word puzzle is a word that has been \u201cjumbled\u201d by permuting the letters of each word to make an anagram. A dictionary of such anagrams may be used to solve puzzles or verify that a jumbled word is unique when creating puzzles. ==Computerized solution== Algorithms have been designed to solve Jumbles, using a dictionary. Common algorithms work by printing all words that can be formed from a set of letters. The solver then chooses the right word. First algorithm: # Begin # Input: J, all the jumbled letters that form an unknown W word(s) # Sort the letters of J in alphabetical order, preserving duplicates # Look up sorted letters in a hash table, initialised with a dictionary, that maps a sorted set of letters to unscrambled words # Print the set of words, which is W # End Second algorithm: #Begin #Input: J, all the jumbled letters that form an unknown W word(s) #Frame a word list Y with all permutations of J #For each word in Y check if the word is existing in the dictionary #If a match is found then collect it in word list W #Print the words in W # End Algorithm to find the permutations of J: #Begin #Initialize a string with first character of J denoted by J(1) #Add the second character of J denoted by J(2) on either side of J(1) to get two strings J(1)J(2) J(2)J(1) #Add the third character of J denoted by J(3) on either side and in between the above 2 strings to get 6 strings J(1)J(2)J(3) J(1)J(3)J(2) J(3)J(1)J(2) J(2)J(1)J(3) J(2)J(3)J(1) J(3)J(2)J(1) #In the same way add J(4) to each of the above strings in either sides and between two characters to get 24 strings #Continue this until all the characters are completed Though the algorithm looks complex it is easy to program. Douglas Hofstadter developed a program called Jumbo that tries to solve Jumble problems as a human mind would. The program doesn't rely on a dictionary and doesn't try to find real English words, but rather words that could be English, exploiting a database of plausibilities for various combinations of letters. Letters are combined non-deterministically, following a strategy inspired by chemical reactions and free associations. Category:Algorithms Category:Word puzzles ",
