The building itself dates back to the 1840s, the house retains many of its original features and today it holds the status as \"Monument of Culture\" in Albania. Since the time of its construction, the building has been mostly in public function towards the society. The building was the home of the patriot of Kor\u00e7\u00eb, Diamanti T\u00ebrpo, who donated the building to the Albanian school. From 1887 to 1902 there was \"M\u00ebsonj\u00ebtorja\", where it was later administered by Ottoman authorities, which used the building as a prison until the Young Turk Revolution, where local Albanians took over again the administration of the building, to reopen the Albanian school and to set up the musical and patriotic band called \"Banda e Liris\u00eb\" on 1 October 1908. As a school, the building continued until 1967, the year when it was given the function as a museum space with the name of National Museum of Education, as well as still called today. == Exhibits and Collections == The museum offers interesting material for visitors, the historic journey of the first Albanian school, such as photographic portraits of the founders, contributors, directors and its pupils in years. There are also exposed books and texts used by its pupils and alumni at \"M\u00ebsonj\u00ebtorja\" time, objects used by Albanian patriots and linguists who have been part of school history. In the museum is improvised the office of the Director of M\u00ebsonj\u00ebtorja, which is documented in the manuscript memoirs of one of its firstest directors, Nu\u00e7i Na\u00e7i. The office room serves as a separate pavilion and there it is also placed the \"Libri i Vizitor\u00ebve\" () where visitors and tourists can leave their notes on their impressions to the museum. In the museum there are exhibited two of the firstest editions of the Albanian alphabet (in 1844 and 1845), published by Naum Haxhi Llazar Bredhi or more commonly known as Naum Veqilharxhi. These alphabets were distributed in Southern Albania, especially in the Kor\u00e7\u00eb and P\u00ebrmet areas. == See also == *List of museums in Albania *History of Albania *Tourism in Albania == References == == External links == Category:Museums in Albania Category:Buildings and structures in Kor\u00e7\u00eb Category:Education museums ",
