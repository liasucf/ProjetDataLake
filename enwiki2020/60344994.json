    "text": "David C. Toland is an American government official currently serving on the Kansas State Cabinet as the Kansas Secretary of Commerce. Prior to his appointment to the position by Governor Laura Kelly, Toland served as President and CEO of the Thrive Allen County, a community health-improvement and economic development organization based in Iola, Kansas. ==Career== Following his graduation from the University of Kansas with a B.A. and an M.P.A., Toland joined the Government of the District of Columbia in the office of Planning and Economic Development, where he served as Deputy COO. After a brief stint with The Minkiti Group, a real estate services company, Toland joined Thrive Allen County as President and CEO. Toland also previously worked in city management in Reno, Nevada and Bonner Springs, Kansas. ==Kansas Secretary of Commerce== On January 11, 2019, Kelly announced that she would appoint Toland as Kansas Secretary of Commerce following her inauguration on January 14, 2019. Anti-abortion activists attempted to prevent Toland's confirmation due to what they perceived as ties to George Tiller, an assassinated abortion provider from Wichita, Kansas who was killed while ushering in his church in 2009 by anti-abortion extremist Scott Roeder. Supporters of Toland noted that the only tie between the two is a small grant that Thrive Allen County obtained from a memorial fund posthumously established in Tiller's name and that Toland's position as Secretary of Commerce would have nothing to do with healthcare services or abortion. The grants in question had been made to assist pregnant women to stop smoking and to provide contraceptive services to low-income women intending to postpone or avoid becoming pregnant. In a hearing by the Commerce Committee held on March 20-21, 2019, Toland expansively answered probing questions from anti-abortion Senators Mary Pilcher-Cook, who is considered one of the most vocal opponents of abortion in the Kansas legislature,Kansas lawmaker wants to make surrogate motherhood illegal, Washington Post, January 29, 2014.

He received support from all 11 Democratic senators, 11 Republicans, and the Senate's lone independent.
