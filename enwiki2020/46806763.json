    "text": "Sceptridium oneidense, the blunt-lobed grapefern, is a fern species in the family Ophioglossaceae. ==Description== The leaf blades of S. oneidense are ternately compound. The spores mature in late fall in panicles that rise above the sterile fronds. ==Taxonomy== At first, S. oneidense was considered a variety of Botrychium dissectum, then a form of it, then possibly a hybrid species. However, after a more detailed study by Wagner in 1961, it was considered its own species. ==Distribution and habitat== S. oneidense grows in moist woodlands in eastern United States and Canada from New Brunswick to Ontario and south to North Carolina. In Canada, it is a relatively rare species, usually only found in large groups of Botrychium obliquum. ==References== Category:Ophioglossaceae Category:Ferns of the United States Category:Ferns of Canada Category:Plants described in 1901 ",
