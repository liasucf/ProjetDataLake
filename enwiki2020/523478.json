Woleai is also the name of the largest of the islets constituting the atoll, lying to the northeast. The population of the atoll was 1,081 in 2000,Yap State Census Report, 2000 (PDF) on an area of 4.5 km2. ==Geography== The islands constitute a double atoll forming the number eight, with a total length of and up to wide; however, most of reef on the southern rim is submerged or poorly developed. The northern and eastern rims have several relatively large islets. The western lagoon is deeper and larger than its eastern counterpart. Both components are part of the same seamount. The total land area for both components combined is only . ==History== Woleai is culturally unique because a script was in use among some speakers of the Woleaian language prior to 1913. As with all of the Caroline Islands, sovereignty passed to the Empire of Germany in 1899. The atoll came under the control of the Empire of Japan after World War I, and was subsequently administered under the South Seas Mandate. In 1944, as the Allied forces closed in on the Mariana Islands, Woleai was heavily fortified by a contingent of 6,426 troops from the Imperial Japanese Army\u2019s IJA 50th Independent Mixed Brigade and Imperial Japanese Navy\u2019s 44th Base Guard Unit and 216th Base Construction Unit. Wolfe Islet was completely leveled, and made into an airfield with a single runway and taxiway. A seaplane anchorage was also constructed off the south-west corner of Woleai Islet. The island and its military facilities were bombed on numerous occasions through the end of 1944 until the middle of 1945, driving its defenders underground, and isolating them from supplies or reinforcements. By the surrender of Japan, only 1,650 survivors remained, the rest having perished by starvation or disease. The survivors were recovered by on September 17, 1945.http://www.desausa.org/images5/uss_sloat_de_245_woleai_surrender.htm Surrender of Woleai Following World War II, the atoll came under the control of the United States of America.
