    "text": "Otani Nobutomo (a.k.a. Otani Shimosa no Kami Seiichiro, Otani Shintaro) (1798 - 1864) was a Japanese martial artist. He was adopted into the Otani family by Otani Hikoshiro in 1817. A master of the Kashima Shinden Jikishinkage-ry\u016b of kenjutsu, he also studied H\u014dz\u014din-ry\u016b s\u014djutsu and the ky\u016bjutsu of the Yoshida- ryu. At the age of 57, Otani was appointed as a commissioner of the K\u014dbusho military academy. Otani was well-regarded for his decorous behaviour in challenge matches, earning the nickname Kunshi no ken, the Gentleman's Sword. He was known to allow opponents to score hits against him on purpose. He would often engage in multiple matches against challengers, allowing himself to be defeated in the first engagement so as to gauge his opponent's response to an easy victory. A repeat match would then see Otani trounce the challenger with ease. This tactic worked to great effect in securing the discipleship of Shimada Toranosuke, who would become one of Otani's most noted students. He also taught Sakakibara Kenkichi. ==References== Category:Japanese swordsmen Category:1798 births Category:1864 deaths ",
