In an interview with MTV, Sheeran revealed that the song is about his late grandmother. He said \"She was in a hospital near my house where I was making the album so I saw her quite a lot while making the album and she passed away while I was in the studio. So that's my first reaction for anything that happens to me, good or bad, pick up a guitar.\" He also said that the song is supposed to \"really make you cry\". Sheeran had not intended to put the song in the album 'Divide' as it was simply a personal tribute to his grandmother that was written from the viewpoint of his mother. His father first suggested that he should play the song at her funeral, which he did, and his grandfather then urged that it should be included in the album after hearing it at the funeral. Sheeran said: \"My grandfather just turned to me [at the funeral], he was like you have to put that out, that has to go on the record. It's such a good memory, that's why it\u2019s ended up on there.\" ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017\u201318) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (Tracklisten) | 26 |- ! scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP) | 109 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italy (FIMI) | 43 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Philippines (Philippine Hot 100) | 29 |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Singles (Official Charts Company) | 90 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 1177 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2017 songs Category:Ed Sheeran songs Category:Songs written by Ed Sheeran Category:Songs written by Johnny McDaid Category:Songs written by Benny Blanco Category:Song recordings produced by Benny Blanco ",
