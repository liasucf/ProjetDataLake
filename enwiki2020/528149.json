    "text": "Saint Mary\u2019s Basilica () is a Brick Gothic church adjacent to the Main Market Square in Krak\u00f3w, Poland. Built in the 14th century, its foundations date back to the early 13th century and serve as one of the best examples of Polish Gothic architecture. Standing 80 m (262 ft) tall, it is particularly famous for its wooden altarpiece carved by Veit Stoss (Wit Stwosz). In 1978 it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site alongside the Historic Centre of Krak\u00f3w. On every hour, a trumpet signal\u2014called the Hejna\u0142 mariacki\u2014is played from the top of the taller of Saint Mary's two towers. The plaintive tune breaks off in mid- stream, to commemorate a famous 13th century trumpeter who was shot in the throat while sounding the alarm before a Mongol attack on the city. The noon- time hejna\u0142 is heard across Poland and abroad broadcast live by the Polish national Radio 1 Station.Let's go: Europe, 1979 by Harvard Student Agencies page 553 Micha\u0142 Malinowski 2008 Polish folktales and folklore page 69 Saint Mary's Basilica also served as an architectural model for many of the churches that were built by the Polish diaspora abroad, particularly those like Saint Michael's and Saint John Cantius in Chicago, designed in the Polish Cathedral style. The church is familiar to many English-speaking readers from the 1929 book The Trumpeter of Krakow by Eric P. Kelly. == History == According to chronicler Jan D\u0142ugosz, Saint Mary's Basilica in the Main Square in Krak\u00f3w was founded in by the Bishop of Krak\u00f3w, Iwo Odrow\u0105\u017c. The building was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Poland. Between 1290\u20131300 the new early Gothic church was built on the remaining foundations. It was consecrated twenty years later, in 1320. The church was completely rebuilt during the reign of Casimir III the Great between 1355 and 1365 with substantial contributions from wealthy restaurateur Miko\u0142aj Wierzynek. The presbytery was elongated and tall windows added. The main body of the church was completed in 1395\u201397 with the new vault constructed by master Nicholas Wernher from Prague. However, the vault over the presbytery collapsed in 1442 due to a possible earthquake, which has never happened before nor since in Krak\u00f3w. In the first half of the 15th century, the side chapels were added. Most of them were the work of master Franciszek Wiecho\u0144. At the same time the northern tower was raised and designed to serve as the watch tower for the entire city. In 1478 carpenter Maciej Heringh (or Heringk) funded a helmet for the tower. A gilded crown was placed on it in 1666, which is still present today. At the end of the 15th century, Saint Mary's church was enriched with a sculptural masterpiece, an Altarpiece of Veit Stoss (O\u0142tarz Mariacki Wita Stwosza) of late Gothic design. In 1536/37, King Sigismund I. declared that the sermons in the church should be changed from German to Polish. The large German community of Krak\u00f3w were relocating their place of worship to the smaller Saint Barbara's church.Andrew Spicer (Ed.), Lutheran Churches in Early Modern Europe (Farnham 2012) p.378 In the 18th century, by the decision of vicar Jacek Augustyn \u0141opacki, the interior was rebuilt in the late Baroque style. The author of this work was Francesco Placidi. All 26 altars, equipment, furniture, benches and paintings were replaced and the walls were decorated with polychrome, the work of Andrzej Radwa\u0144ski. At the beginning of the 19th century, the city decided that a cemetery near the Basilica was to be shut down and replaced by a public square. Today, it is known as Plac Mariacki (Marian Square). In the years 1887\u20131891, under the direction of Tadeusz Stryje\u0144ski, the neo-Gothic design was introduced into the Basilica. The temple gained a new design and murals painted and funded by Jan Matejko, who worked with Stanislaw Wyspianski and J\u00f3zef Mehoffer - the authors of stained glass in the presbytery. Since the beginning of 1990s, the Basillica underwent an extensive renovation. In 2003, in the final stage of the works, the roof of the church was replaced. On 18 April 2010, in Saint Mary's Basilica, a funeral ceremony for Polish President Lech Kaczy\u0144ski and his wife Maria was held. The coffins were later transported and buried in one of the crypts of Wawel Cathedral. == Gallery == == See also == * O\u0142tarz Wita Stwosza (Altarpiece of Veit Stoss) * Jan Matejko 19th century design contribution * Polish Cathedral style * Roman Catholicism in Poland * Roman Catholic Marian churches == Notes and references == == External links == * official website * 360\u00b0 virtual tour of St Mary's church at night in Krakow * Krakow: everything about St. Mary's Church * Marek Strzala, Kosciol Mariacki - the basilica of the Virgin Mary in Krakow Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1347 Mary Category:Brick Gothic Mariacka Category:Gothic architecture in Poland Category:Terminating vistas Category:14th-century Roman Catholic church buildings ",
