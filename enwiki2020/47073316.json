    "text": "WoongSan (born Kim Eun Young) is an award-winning South Korean musician, actress and TV show host. She has been a leading figure in the jazz music scene in Korea and Japan for over a decade, having performed live over 500 times since her 1998 Japanese debut. She is the first Korean-born musician to perform at New York City's historic Blue Note Jazz Club and has collaborated with many other well-known jazz musicians including Benny Green, Lonnie Plaxico, Rodney Green, Conrad Herwig and Suzuki Hisatsugu. She is also well known for training Ali (South Korean singer), a popular K-pop singer. ==Biography== When she was 18, WoongSan spent a year and a half at a Buddhist temple in the Korean countryside. During her training she had a powerful realization: her calling in life was music. Initially she played in a college rock band, but after a friend played her a Billie Holiday record, she began to dedicate herself to jazz. She spent several years performing as a solo artist then released her first album accompanied by a jazz ensemble in 1996. By the end of 1998 she was a recognizable figure in both Korea and Japan, and since then, she has released six albums, garnered numerous awards and critical acclaim, and continues to tour prolifically. She has also written many songs for films. Last year, she proved her career was an ongoing path as a music performer on the stage collaborated with Lee Ritenour. ==Style== WoongSan's style is a distinctive blend of jazz, blues, Latin and funk style. Her mid-low voice does not span as much tonal ground as other famous singers, but what she lacks in range she more than makes up for in creativity and malleability. As an independent lyricist, Woong San has penned powerful ballads, cozy love numbers and everything in between. Buddhism has played a prominent role in her life, and it shines through in her songwriting: she often explores the themes of freedom, mindfulness and the beauty of change in her songs. Her work has been described as \"soulful, fearless, sultry.\" ==Albums== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\" width:75px;\"|Year ! style=\"width:150px;\"|Title ! style=\"width:320px;\"|Details ! style=\"width: 290px;\"|Track listing |- |2003. 12.12. |Love Letters |1st album released both in Korea and Japan |style=\"font- size:85%;\"| |- |2005. 11. 7. |The Blues |2nd album released in Korea |style=\"font-size:85%;\"| |- |2007. 7. 24. |Yesterday |3rd album released in Korea |style=\"font-size:85%;\"| |- |2008. 9. 16. |Fall in Love |4th album released both in Korea and Japan |style=\"font-size:85%;\"| |- |2009. 10. 6. |Miss Mister |1st special gift album for fans |style=\"font-size:85%;\"| |- |2010. 3. 17. |Close Your Eyes |5th album released both in Korea and Japan |style=\"font-size:85%;\"| |- |2011. 10. 4. |Once I Loved |2nd special gift album |style=\"font-size:85%;\"| |- |2011. 10. 4. |Tomorrow |6th album released in Korea and Japan |style=\"font-size:85%;\"| |- |2013. 10. 2. |I Love You |7th album released in Korea and Japan |style=\"font-size:85%;\"| |- |2014. 12.13. |THE BEST WOONG SAN |THE BEST album released in Korea |style=\"font-size:85%;\"| |- |2015. 8. 12. |Temptation |8th album released in Korea and Japan |style=\"font-size:85%;\"| |- |2016. 11. 1. |JAZZ IS MY LIFE |MINI ALBUM VOL.1 released in Korea |style=\"font-size:85%;\"| |- |2018. 9. 5. |I'm Alright |9th album released in Korea and Japan |style=\"font-size:85%;\"| |- |2020. 11. 8. |\uac00\uc81c: Nothing Compares To You | 10th album\uc744 \uae30\ub2e4\ub9ac\uba70\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318d\u318d \ub728\uac70\uc6b4 \ud654\uc0b4\ucc98\ub7fc \ub124\uac8c\ub85c \uac00\ub9ac(WoongSanLOVE) P.S. \uc6c5\uc0b0 \ub2d8\uc758 \ub178\ub798\ub97c \uc88b\uc544\ud558\uace0 \uc6c5\uc0b0 \ub2d8\uc5d0\uac8c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \uac16\uace0 \uc790\ub8cc\uc218\uc815\uc694\uccad\uc744 \ud574\uc8fc\uc2e0 \ud070\uc0b0 \uac1d \ub2d8\uc5d0\uac8c\ub3c4 \uac10\uc0ac\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4. |style=\"font-size:85%;\"| |} ==Awards== #1993 MBC Korean Popular Music Festival's \"Best Singer' award # 2001 MM Jazz's (jazz magazine), \"best Artist\" award # 2003 MM Jazz's \"Best Musician\" award # 2008 Korean Popular Music Awards' \"Best Jazz & Crossover Album\" award # 2008 Reader Poll magazine's \"best Vocalist\" award # 2010 Swing Journal's \"Gold Disc\" award for her album # 2011 Jazz Criticism's \"Jazz Disc Grand Prize\" award ==Soundtracks== # \"Elegy\" for Korean TV show, Kyungsung Scandal # \"I Think I Loved You\" for Korean TV show, Mother, Sister # Participated in OST for Korean TV show, Lema Lee, the Sun # \"Destiny\" for Korean TV show, Ill Ji Mae # \"In the Mood\" for Korean film, Who Slept With Her? # \"Pierro's Mask\" for Korean film, The Shadow Murder # \"Outrageous Love\" on soundtrack for Korean TV show, Chuno ==References== Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Blues musicians Category:K-pop singers Category:South Korean female pop singers Category:South Korean jazz singers Category:King of Mask Singer contestants Category:20th-century South Korean singers Category:21st-century South Korean singers Category:20th-century women singers Category:21st-century women singers Category:South Korean Buddhists ",
