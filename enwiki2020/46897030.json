    "text": "Bose\u2013Einstein Condensate: The Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model's fitness concept can be used to explain the Bose\u2013Einstein condensate. Here the peaks show that as the temperature goes down, more and more atoms condense to the same energy level. At lower temperature when the \"fitness\" is higher, this model predicts that more atoms will be connected to the same energy level. The Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model is a model in network science that explains the growth of complex evolving networks. This model can explain that nodes with different characteristics acquire links at different rates. It predicts that a node's growth depends on its fitness and can calculate the degree distribution. The Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model is named after its inventors Ginestra Bianconi and Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si. This model is a variant of the Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert model. The model can be mapped to a Bose gas and this mapping can predict a topological phase transition between a \"rich-get-richer\" phase and a \"winner- takes-all\" phase. ==Concepts== The Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert (BA) model uses two concepts: growth and preferential attachment. Here, growth indicates the increase in the number of nodes in the network with time, and preferential attachment means that more connected nodes receive more links. The Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model, on top of these two concepts, uses another new concept called the fitness. This model makes use of an analogy with evolutionary models. It assigns an intrinsic fitness value to each node, which embodies all the properties other than the degree. The higher the fitness, the higher the probability of attracting new edges. Fitness can be defined as the ability to attract new links \u2013 \"a quantitative measure of a node's ability to stay in front of the competition\". While the Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert (BA) model explains the \"first mover advantage\" phenomenon, the Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model explains how latecomers also can win. In a network where fitness is an attribute, a node with higher fitness will acquire links at a higher rate than less fit nodes. This model explains that age is not the best predictor of a node's success, rather latecomers also have the chance to attract links to become a hub. The Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model can reproduce the degree correlations of the Internet Autonomous Systems. This model can also show condensation phase transitions in the evolution of complex network. The BB model can predict the topological properties of Internet. ==Algorithm== The fitness network begins with a fixed number of interconnected nodes. They have different fitness, which can be described with fitness parameter, \\eta_j which is chosen from a fitness distribution \u03c1(\u03b7). === Growth=== The assumption here is that a node\u2019s fitness is independent of time, and is fixed. A new node j with m links and a fitness \\eta_j is added with each time-step. ===Preferential attachment=== The probability \u03a0i that a new node connects to one of the existing links to a node i in the network depends on the number of edges, k_{i}, and on the fitness \\eta_{i} of node i, such that, : \\Pi_i = \\frac{\\eta_i k_i}{\\sum_j \\eta_j k_j}. Each node\u2019s evolution with time can be predicted using the continuum theory. If initial number of node is m, then the degree of node i changes at the rate: : \\frac{\\partial k_i}{\\partial t} = m\\frac{\\eta_i k_i}{\\sum_j \\eta_j k_j} Assuming the evolution of k_i follows a power law with a fitness exponent \\beta(\\eta_i) : k(t,t_i,\\eta_i) = m\\left(\\frac{t}{t_i}\\right)^{\\beta(\\eta_i)}, where t_i is the time since the creation of node i. Here, \\beta(\\eta) = \\frac{\\eta}{C}\\text{ and }C = \\int \\rho(\\eta)\\frac{\\eta}{1-\\beta(\\eta)} \\, d\\eta. ==Properties== ===Equal fitnesses=== If all fitnesses are equal in a fitness network, the Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model reduces to the Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert model, when the degree is not considered, the model reduces to the fitness model (network theory). When fitnesses are equal, the probability \\Pi_i that the new node is connected to node i when k_i is the degree of node i is, : \\Pi_i = \\frac{k_i}{\\sum_j k_j}. ===Degree distribution=== Degree distribution of the Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model depends on the fitness distribution \u03c1(\u03b7). There are two scenarios that can happen based on the probability distribution. If the fitness distribution has a finite domain, then the degree distribution will have a power-law just like the BA model. In the second case, if the fitness distribution has an infinite domain, then the node with the highest fitness value will attract a large number of nodes and show a winners-take-all scenario. ===Measuring node fitnesses from empirical network data=== There are various statistical methods to measure node fitnesses \\eta_i in the Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model from real- world network data. From the measurement, one can investigate the fitness distribution \u03c1(\u03b7) or compare the Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model with various competing network models in that particular network. ===Variations of the Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model=== The Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model has been extended to weighted networks displaying linear and superlinear scaling of the strength with the degree of the nodes as observed in real network data. This weighted model can lead to condensation of the weights of the network when few links acquire a finite fraction of the weight of the entire network. Recently it has been shown that the Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model can be interpreted as a limit case of the model for emergent hyperbolic network geometry called Network Geometry with Flavor. The Bianconi\u2013Barab\u00e1si model can be also modified to study static networks where the number of nodes is fixed. ==History== In 1999, Albert- L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si requested his student Bianconi to investigate evolving networks where nodes have a fitness parameter. Barab\u00e1si was interested in finding out how Google, a latecomer in the search engine market, became a top player. Google\u2019s toppling of previous top search engines went against Barab\u00e1si's BA model, which states that first mover has an advantage. In the scale-free network if a node appears first it will be most connected because it had the longest time to attract links. Bianconi's work showed that when fitness parameter is present, the \"early bird\" is not always the winner. Bianconi and Barab\u00e1si's research showed that fitness is what creates or breaks the hub. Google's superior PageRank algorithm helped them to beat other top players. Later on Facebook came and dethroned Google as Internet's most linked website. In all these cases fitness mattered which was first showed in Bianconi and Barab\u00e1si's research. In 2001, Ginestra Bianconi and Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1si published the model in the Europhysics Letters. In another paper, substituting fitness for energy, nodes for energy level and links for particles, Bianconi and Barab\u00e1si were able to map the fitness model with Bose gas. ==See also== *Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert model *Bose\u2013Einstein condensation: a network theory approach == References == == External links == * Networks: A Very Short Introduction * Advance Network Dynamics Category:Social networks Category:Graph algorithms Category:Random graphs ",
