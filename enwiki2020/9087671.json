Sto\u00ebbel was the pseudonym he used as a painter. ==Biography== Born on 21 December 1909 in Frenda, Algeria, died in December 2001 in Paris, France. From a very young age, he was attracted to music and graphic art, and these two art forms were closely linked throughout his life, giving his art a musical, rhythmic dimension. In Oran, he founded a small music school with 17 musicians, and conducted an orchestra, but he soon felt that he would not make any progress unless he went to Paris. In 1931, he arrived in Paris to work on his music and studied with Professor L\u00e9on Eug\u00e8ne Moreau, Grand prix de Rome, who taught him harmony, counterpoint, fugue and the piano until the declaration of war in 1939, when he left to rejoin his infantry corps. In 1940, faced with the rise in Nazism, he returned to Algeria where he painted, drew and conducted an orchestra until 1942. There are collections in Algeria which contain figurative works from this period. In 1942, the Americans landed in Oran, meaning that Jews no longer had to wear the yellow star there. This was the start of Edgar Sto\u00ebbel\u2019s deep sympathy for the Americans and their wonderful organisational skills. He became aware that the Americans would have a long-lasting impact on the course of history in the 20th century. Due to the frequent contact he had with them, he ended up joining the Americans and the 7th Algerian Infantry Regiment of the French Expeditionary Corps in the Italy Campaign. In December 1942, he was very proud to be part of General Clark's 1st Army, which landed in Naples and fought the Italy campaign as far as Rome and Taranto. He landed in Provence on 19 August 1943, at Saint-Tropez and Port-Vendres and took part in military operations until 1945. He continued to draw scenes of daily life throughout the Italy campaign, and began producing imaginary drawings that prefigured the Figurasyntheses. After the Armistice, he returned to Paris and founded the Editions Sto\u00ebbel publishing house, writing music and songs which he produced in 78 rpm until the arrival of fine groove records. From 1945-46 onwards, he gradually left behind music to concentrate more on painting and drawing. Between 1946 and 1950 he painted a number of figurative landscapes of Montmartre, Place Clichy and Place Pigalle. From 1950 onwards, he frequented the artists\u2019 area of Montparnasse and became friends with the enigmatic artist Anton Prinner, a friend of Veira da Silva, Pierre Loeb and Picasso. This lively band would invade the cafes of Montparnasse until very late at night, the evening often starting in La Coupole, a spot he frequented until the 1970s. He was also friends with the artists in Rue de la Grange-Bateli\u00e8re: Goetz, Mondzain, Michonze, Meyer-Lazar. In the 1970s, he met an Irish woman in Montparnasse who took him to Pub Olympia, where there was a fantastic atmosphere. He sang his own songs there: \"Le beau Paulo\", \"La fille du marinero\", \"La Joconde \u00e0 Paulo\", which met with great success. The crowd loved him, and the wonderful contact he made with young people, by singing and drawing on the tables, took him back there every night until dawn. For several years he would return home in the early hours and then get up to draw and paint in the afternoon. Jacques Martin made a film on the life of Sto\u00ebbel, the painter and singer at the Pub Olympia. Music was a constant theme of his life, closely linked to his painting, the source of his art, the colourful rhythm of his canvases and part of his happiness. Happiness was a very important word in his work each of his canvases conveys the notion that every moment of life is a marvel. Edgar Sto\u00ebbel is a painter who symbolises happiness, the search for completeness and balance. In 1960, he invented his own style which he christened \u201cFigurasynthese\u201d. \u201cFigurasynthese is the image one makes of an object, not the object in the form in which it appears to us: it is subjectivised and represents an unreal form in every way. The relationship between the forms is what makes the Figurasynthese.\u201d This work is rooted in a deep philosophy. This idea of the balance of the world is always present in this artist's work. A Painter with a recognisable style. Emmanuel David, a major international art dealer, and one of the greatest collectors, who discovered Bernard Buffet, says: \u201cWhen faced with the artist\u2019s canvas, you are struck by the personality evident in the design and execution of the work. The sincerity of emotion, the height of the tone and colour, the sensitivity and simplicity of the \u201csummarised\u201d composition, create a balance of volume, a poetry, in which dreams and music give this work total originality and quality.\u201d With Figurasynthese, he invented a recognisable style that makes his canvases easily identifiable. Sto\u00ebbel\u2019s painting in the 1960s was part of the post-war concrete abstract movement, or concrete art, also known as Constructive Art. Pigeonholed by art critics for too long as something that happened in Paris and especially in New York, concrete abstract art was actually a worldwide movement that spread from South America to Northern Europe, and cannot simply be reduced to the French easel painting of Bazaine, Manessier, Hartung, Est\u00e8ve or Gischia. This movement, as referred to by V\u00e9ronique Wiesinger in her introduction to the remarkable Catalogue \u201cAbstract Art in France and Italy 1945-1975, focusing on Jean Leppien\u201d at the Strasbourg Museum from November 1999 to February 2000, is \u201cfar from being the phoney echo of the pre-war Ecole de Paris, or a response to American abstract expressionism, abstraction was in fact, until the middle of the 1970s, the last firework of the modern movement, lighting all the fires that still burn today\u201d. The following non-exhaustive list of painters, important figures in the history of art in this period, shows that the school of concrete abstraction was one of the most important contributors to 20th century Art: Josef Albers, Aagaard Andersen, Jean Arp, Jean-Michel Atlan, Willy Baumeister, Andr\u00e9 Bloc, Andr\u00e9 Bruy\u00e8re, Busse, Marcelle Cahn, Antonio Carderara, Fernando Chevrier, Jean Couy, Heinrich Davring, Sonia Delaunay, Jean Deyrolle, Domela, Piero Dorazio, Adolphe Richard Fleishmann, Nato Frasc\u00e0, G\u00fcnter Fruhtrunk, Paolo Ghilardi, Gilioli, Hajdu, Johannes Itten, Joseph Jarema, Lapique, Jean Leppien, Anselmo Legnagni, Henri Lhotellier, Alberto Magnelli, Willy Maywald, Fran\u00e7ois Morellet, Robert Mortensen, Bruno Munari, Aur\u00e9lie Nemours, Henri Nouveau, Vera Pagava, Penalba, Edgar Pillet, Serge Poliakoff, Hans Reichel, Hans Richter, Michel Seuphor, Atanasio Soldati, Ferdinand Springer, Edgar Sto\u00ebbel, Gunta St\u00f6lzl, Nicolas Warb. At the end of the 1940s, Edgar Sto\u00ebbel created the first Figurasyntheses, at a time when many artists in the Ecole de Paris were working in abstraction, which saw its peak in the 1950s. Sto\u00ebbel did not sacrifice his art for the abstract fashion, but instead developed his own style which saw its peak in the 1960s. ==Museums== * Mus\u00e9e du Montparnasse, Paris, France * Beit Uri and Rami Nechustan Museum, Israel * Dimona Museum, Israel * Eilat Museum, Israel ==Bibliography== * Edgar Stoebel, Monograph by Lydia Harambourg, Editions du Cercle d'art, . * Benezit, Dictionary of Painters, Sculptors, Artists and Engravers ==Exhibitions and Salons== * Member of the Association of Jewish Painters, Sculptors and Engravers in France * Salon des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais * Salon d\u2019Automne * Salon de l\u2019Art Libre * 1955: Awarded the Deauville Grand Prix International * 1958: Personal exhibition, Galerie Briard, Marseille * 1960: Villa Robioni, Promenade des Anglais, Nice ** Studio sale at Public Auction in Orl\u00e9ans ** Studio sale at Public Auction in Angers * 1961: Public Auction organised by The Montpelier Galleries, at Bonham & Sons Ltd, London ** Public Auction at Philips and Neal & Sons, London ** XXXVI Salon Berruyer under the Presidency of Mr Lucien Lautrec at the Ecole Nationale des Beaux Arts, Bourges * 1963: Galerie Bernard Ch\u00eane, Paris ** Galerie Montpensier at the Palais Royal, Paris ** Galerie Louisa Carri\u00e8re, Paris ** Galerie Jory, Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9, Paris * 1963: Galerie La Gal\u00e8re, Paris * 1964: Studio sale at Public Auction in Angers * 1964: Studio sale at Ma\u00eetre Robert, Drouot * 1969: Galerie Waldorf, Copenhagen, Denmark * 1972: Centre Culturel d\u2019Art Juif, Paris [Paris Centre for Jewish Art] * 1973: Galerie Claude Jory, Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9, Paris ** Winner of poster competition organised by WIZO * 1974: Beit Uri and Rami Nechushtan Museum, Ashdot Ya\u2019Aqov, Israel ** Hakibutz Hameuhad, Israel ** P.N Emek Hajarden, Israel * Dimona Museum, Israel * Eilat Museum, Israel * 1982: City of Paris Silver Medal for a Figurasynthese * 2001/2003: Galerie Le Mus\u00e9e Priv\u00e9, Paris * 2006: Montparnasse Museum, Paris * 2007: various exhibitions in museums and galleries. ==External links== * Edgar Stoebel Category:1909 births Category:2001 deaths Category:People from Frenda Category:Pieds-Noirs Category:French Jews Category:French male painters Category:Jewish painters Category:Modern painters Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th-century male artists ",
