    "text": "All Hail the Silence is an electronic music duo comprising American electronic musician BT and English singer-songwriter Christian Burns. The band was informally announced on March 8, 2012, but live shows and project announcements did not commence until the second half of 2014. All Hail the Silence and the subsequent album are notable in that they were created using analog synthesizers without the aid of a computer. ==History== In 2012, Transeau contacted Burns, who collaborated with him on albums such as the These Hopeful Machines (2010) and A Song Across Wires (2013), inquiring on the formation of a band, to which Burns accepted. Before the band's informal announcement, the duo recorded 17 songs in the basement of a synth store called AnalogLand in Baltimore without the use of a computer. Transeau stated that the record was inspired by the teen angst of listening to synthpop bands from the 1980s and 1990s such as Depeche Mode, Yaz, The Human League, OMD, and The Blue Nile. He describes it as \"synth wave\". One of the seventeen songs, called \"Looking Glass\", was available for download as a \"Tweet for a Track\" song in connection to Twitter and Facebook. The duo's first album was expected for release in the second half of 2012, but the project was postponed so that both artists could finish their remaining solo projects. In October 2013, it was announced that musician Vince Clarke would work with All Hail the Silence on their forthcoming project. On July 21, 2014, Transeau and Burns announced that their band would be touring with Erasure in the fall of 2014 for the album The Violet Flame. On August 24, 2016, the band announced that they would release a four-track limited edition colored 12\" vinyl collectible extended play with Shopify on September 19, 2016, and the four songs were released on iTunes on December 16, 2016, with more songs to be released later. On December 24, 2016, the duo released the song \"All Hail the Silent Night\" for free to celebrate Christmas. On September 28, 2018, the band released their first official single, \"Diamonds in the Snow\", along with its accompanying music video. Billboard then revealed that the band's forthcoming album, Daggers, would release on January 18, 2019. ==Members== * BT (Brian Transeau) \u2013 synthesizers, drum machines * Christian Burns \u2013 vocals ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" !style=\"width:10em;\" rowspan=\"1\"|Title !style=\"width:22em;\" rowspan=\"1\"|Album details |- !scope=\"row\"| Daggers | *Released: January 18, 2019 *Label: KSS3TE Recordings *Format: Digital download, vinyl |- |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" !style=\"width:10em;\" rowspan=\"1\"|Title !style=\"width:22em;\" rowspan=\"1\"|Album details |- !scope=\"row\"| AHTS-001 | *Released: September 19, 2016 *Label: Self-released, Black Hole Recordings *Format: Digital download, vinyl |- |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Diamonds in the Snow\" | rowspan=\"2\" | 2018 | Daggers |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Christmas Upon Winter Hill\" (featuring Tony Burns) | |- |} ===Music videos=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Director(s) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Time\" | 2016 | rowspan=\"2\" | rowspan=\"3\" | Daggers |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Broken Satellite\" | 2017 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Diamonds in the Snow\" | rowspan=\"4\" | 2018 | Histibe |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Diamonds in the Snow (Jody Wisternoff Remix)\" | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Temptation\" | | Daggers |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Christmas Upon Winter Hill\" | | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"The Alarm\" | 2019 | | Daggers |} ==References== == External links == * Category:Musical groups established in 2012 Category:Electro house musicians Category:Electronic music duos Category:Synthpop groups ",
