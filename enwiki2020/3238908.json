He led thirteen expeditions to Africa starting in 1922. Broke after the financial disaster of his 7th African expedition, Gatti settled in the US in 1930. His second spouse Ellen Ellen Morgan Waddill Gatti (b. 1893 (or 1894) in Missouri, USA - d. 24.09.1962 in Ticino, Switzerland, 69 years old) accompanied him on his 8th expedition. They did the 10th (in Belgian Congo, 1938-1940) and 11th expeditions (\"To the Mountains of the Moon\" i.e. the Rwenzori Mountains at the border of Uganda, 1947-1948) with a caravan of motor vehicles including a 9-ton \"Jungle Yacht\", custom built by International Harvester in Chicago.https://www.hobbydb.com/catalog_items/intenational-trucks-chosen-for- commander-gatti-s-jungle-yachts Gatti became one of the first Europeans to see and capture the fabled okapi and bongo, a brown lyre-horned antelope with white stripes. He was an enthusiastic amateur radio operator using callsign OQ5ZZ. Known by the Africans as \"Bwana Makubwa\", he was very familiar to the Pygmy tribe. He photographed them as well as the Watussi and Masai. He met an important female python shaman and became experienced with African magic. His books, articles, and some 53.000 photos have become invaluable scientific and anthropological resources. ==Books== * Tom-Toms in the Night. 1932 (includes: The King of the Gorillas. 1932) * Black Mist. 1933 * Hidden Africa. 1933 * Musungu. 1933 * Great Mother Forest. 1936 * Saranga the Pygmy. 1939 (trad. in Italian: Saranga il cacciatore. 1941) * Kamanda: An African Boy. 1941 (with ill. by Ellen Gatti) * The Wrath of Moto. 1941 * Adventure in Black and White. 1943 * Here Is Africa. 1943 (with Ellen Gatti) * Killers All!. 1943 * Mediterranean Spotlights. 1944 * South of the Sahara: Perilous Encounters with Big Game and Strange Peoples in the African Wilds. 1945 * Here Is the Veld. 1948 * Kamanda on Safari.
