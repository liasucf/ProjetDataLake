Goa Prant of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was formed under the leadership of Velingkar. He launched Bharatiya Bhasha Suraksha Manch an organization which promotes Konkani and Marathi in schools and the withdrawal of grants to English medium schools in the state of the Goa. Velingkar oppose the decision of the Digambar Kamat-led government to provide grants to primary level English schools which was opposed by Manohar Parrikar and other opposition leaders. After Bharatiya Janata Party-Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party alliance emerged victorious in the 2012 Goa Legislative Assembly election, they continued the grants which Velingkar opposed and subsequently dropped from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh as the Goa chief due to his decision to float a political party. In protest 400 volunteers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh resigned. On October 2, 2016, Velingkar officially Goa Suraksha Manch but Velingkar neither held any post and did not contest 2017 Goa Legislative Assembly election.
