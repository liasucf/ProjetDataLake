In: Antiquity, a quarterly review of world archaeology, ISSN 0003-598X, V. 10, 38 (1936), pp. 175\u2013178. ==Description== The cave is four m high and 15 m wide. About half a meter above the ground there are rock paintings of a herd of differently drawn cattle and a farmstead representing a rare example of cattle paintings in the Gilf Kebir that otherwise are abundant in the nearby Jebel Ouenat.Rudolph Kuper: Archaeology of the Gilf Kebir National Park Retrieved 2020/04/20. These Neolithic rock paintings testify the favorable climatic conditions of life during the African humid period much different from the present one.Yves Gauthier and Giancarlo Negro, Magharat el-kantara (Shaw\u2019s Cave) revisite : art rupstre du sud Gilf Kebir (Egypte de sud-ouest).
