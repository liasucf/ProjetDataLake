Ptolemy's Geography (2nd century AD) described a point called \u0399\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (Hieron, \"sacred promontory\") which probably referred to Carnsore Point.http://www.romaneranames.uk/essays/ireland.pdf It is famous for being the proposed location of the Nuclear Energy Board power plant which was to be built in the 1970s. The plan would have produced electricity for the Electricity Supply Board. Originating in 1968, the Irish Government gave renewed effort to the plans after the 1973 energy crisis. The plan envisaged one, and eventually four, nuclear power stations, but was (discreetly) dropped in the late 1970s after opposition by environmental groups, including the Wexford group the Nuclear Safety Association and others. The campaign against the proposed plant also gained some international support, including that of Petra Kelly, who gave a speech at Carnsore.Women on War: an international anthology of Women's Writings from Antiquity to the Present edited by Daniela Gioseffi. Feminist Press, 2003 (pg.340) One activist against the plant who later became notable was Adi Roche. Roche focused on the relief of suffering experienced by children in the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, and founded Chernobyl Children International.Going Nuclear: Ireland, Britain, and the campaign to close Sellafield by Veronica McDermott. Irish Academic Press, 2008 (pg.263) The anti-nuclear groups organised a series of rallies and concerts at Carnsore Point from 1978 (18\u201320 August) to August 1981. Titled \"Get To The Point\" and \"Back To The Point\" respectively, and featuring Christy Moore as lead act, the concerts were a massive success and served to bring to public notice the whole question of nuclear power in Ireland. The British and Irish Communist Organisation, who believed nuclear power was necessary to achieve socialism in Ireland, picketed the first concert.Comment magazine, 8 September 1978, pgs 1-3. ==Notes== ==External links== * Nuclear Energy (An Bord Fuinnimh N\u00faicl\u00e9igh) Act, 1971 * Carnsore: Why Ireland never got nuclear power * ESB to open wind farm at Carnsore Point Category:Headlands of County Wexford Category:Power stations in the Republic of Ireland Category:Wind farms in the Republic of Ireland Category:Cancelled nuclear power stations ",
