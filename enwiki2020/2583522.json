This association has the ambition of promoting the organic agriculture and green tourism. Its domicile is situated in El General in Costa Rica. The members are mostly campesinos, who husband small fields at the Talamanca mountains. Meanwhile the community has grown and now embraces deputies of forty villages, one of them indigenous. UNAPROA has cooperated for several years with the Austrian magazine Gr\u00fcnen Bildungswerkstatt. == See also == * Austrian Service Abroad * Austrian Social Service ==External links== *http://www.sonador.info/html/en/unaproa/projekt.html Category:Nature conservation in Costa Rica ",
