    "text": "Elektrenika is the third studio album by Polish singer Reni Jusis. Most of the lyrics and half of compositions were written by Jusis herself. Micha\u0142 Przytu\u0142a is composer of the other half of material. Przytu\u0142a who worked with Jusis on her previous projects as a record engineer gets a producer credit with this album. Elektrenika marked Jusis musical metamorphosis. While her two previous albums were heavily influenced by R&B; and Hip-Hop music, Elektrenika was an 80's inspired, electronic record with mostly house and club rhythms. It was her first attempt at a dance music scene. \"Electrenic Night Tour\" helped Jusis to promote the album and herself as a dance artist. The album spawned two hits Nic o mnie nie wiecie and \"Nigdy Ciebie Nie Zapomn\u0119\" (\"Jakby Przez Sen\") which is now known as a Polish club classic. In 2001 Elektrenika was nominated to Fryderyk Award in Album of the Year Techno/Elektronic/Dance category. ==OLiS== Although heavy promotion Elektrenika sold rather poorly. Album debuted at #23 on Polish Album Chart and it was its highest position on the list. ==Track listing== #\"Czuj\u0119, \u017ce czuj\u0119 si\u0119 dobrze\" #\"Nic o mnie nie wiecie\" #\"Dla Ciebie wyjd\u0119 z siebie\" #\"Nie dokazuj, nie dokazuj mi\u0142y\" #\"Pozw\u00f3l, \u017ce zabior\u0119 Ci\u0119 do domu\" #\"\u015ani\u0142o mi si\u0119\" #\"Jutro odpowiem\" #\"Tylu tu ludzi\" #\"Czy czujesz jak p\u0142on\u0119\" #\"A nie m\u00f3wi\u0142am\" #\"Jakby przez sen\" #\"Nic o mnie nie wiecie\" (Renix) ==Singles== #\"Nic o mnie nie wiecie\" #\"Nigdy Ciebie Nie Zapomn\u0119\" Category:2001 albums Category:Reni Jusis albums ",
