    "text": "Miami Lyric Opera (MLO) is an opera company in Miami-Dade County, Florida, United States. The company was founded by the Italian tenor Raffaele Cardone, establishing itself as a non-profit organization in 2004. It attempted to take advantage of a small niche market for opera in the region. After having an inaugural concert of arias in October 2004, the company \"presented its first fully staged production\" in April 2005, with a performance of La traviata by Giuseppe Verdi. This was followed by an August performance of Cavalleria Rusticana by Pietro Mascagni.Beth Feinstein-Barti, \"Hallandale Soprano Takes Lead at Miami Opera\", South Florida Sun Sentinel (August 17, 2005), Arts&Culture; page 1.
