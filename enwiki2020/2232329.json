    "text": "Taautus of Byblos, according to the Phoenician writer Sanchuniathon, was the inventor of writing and son of Misor who was bequeathed the land of Egypt by Cronus. Sanchuniathon's writings, through the translation of Philo, were transmitted to us by Eusebius in his work Praeparatio evangelica. Eusebius says that Philo placed Sanchuniathon's works into nine books. In the introduction to the first book he makes this preface concerning Sanchuniathon: > \u201cThese things being so, Sanchuniathon, who was a man of much learning and > great curiosity, and desirous of knowing the earliest history of all nations > from the creation of the world, searched out with great care the history of > Taautus, knowing that of all men under the sun Taautus was the first who > thought of the invention of letters, and began the writing of records: and > he laid the foundation, as it were, of his history, by beginning with him, > whom the Egyptians called Thoyth, and the Alexandrians Thoth, translated by > the Greeks into Hermes.\u201d Philo further says that Taautus wrote the work Commentaries, in which he discussed the creation.
