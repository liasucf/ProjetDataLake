It was founded in 1939 as an unofficial AM carrier current campus radio station in the basement of Clark Hall. Upon gaining recognition, the station operated under the unofficial call sign WES. In the 1950s, the call sign became WESU. Then on February 25, 1961, it began operating an FM station at 88.1 MHz, eventually abandoning the AM station.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 Between 1967 and 1990, WESU was owned and operated by an independent student group, the now-defunct Wesleyan Broadcast Association, Inc. Today, it is owned by the Trustees of Wesleyan University, and operated by students and community volunteers. In 1999, the station moved offices and studios from the basement of Clark Hall to its current location next the Wesleyan Argus on 45 Broad Street. Asked in 2020 whether WESU is not the oldest college radio station in the United States, its station manager Benjamin Michael gave an explanation of the complexities of what counts as a \"college radio station\" and then stated that WESU is \"the last of the original student-owned and student-operated stations.\" WESU operates 24 hours a day. Until 2004, WESU's format had been entirely freeform, with DJs and student staff having complete freedom to program what they wanted. The university then announced its intention to seek an affiliation with National Public Radio (NPR), and to change the station's daytime format.23 November 2004 WESU press release, originally on the WESU-FM site; archived on the Internet Archive, 30 April 2008, retrieved 21 February 2011.
