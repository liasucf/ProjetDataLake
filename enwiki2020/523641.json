Najib Razak was the chairman of the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition from April 2009 to May 2018 and the president of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) from November 2008 to May 2018, which had maintained control of Malaysia's government with a parliamentary majority for more than sixty years until the coalition's defeat in the 2018 general election. Najib was elected to the Parliament of Malaysia in 1976, at the age of 23, replacing his deceased father in the Pahang-based seat of Pekan. In the same year, he was appointed the head of UMNO Youth's Pekan branch and became a member of the youth wing's Executive Council. In the early years of his political career, Najib took on a deputy prime minister role in 1976, and between 1982 and 1986, he was the Menteri Besar of Pahang. Thereafter, until 2009, he was rotated throughout the Cabinet of Malaysia, taking on various ministerial portfolios in defence, education, culture, youth and sports, and finally finance. Between 1993 and 2009, Najib was a vice-president of UMNO. Najib's tenure as prime minister, between 2009 and 2018, was marked by economic liberalisation measures, such as cuts to government subsidies, loosening of restrictions on foreign investment, and reductions in preferential measures for ethnic Malays in business. After the 2013 election his government was marked by the pursuit of a number of its critics on sedition charges, the imprisonment of opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim following a conviction for sodomy, the implementation of a Goods and Services Tax (GST), and an ongoing scandal involving state investment firm 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) which led to rallies calling for Najib's resignation, spearheaded by the grassroots movement Bersih.Arrests at rally calling for Najib's resignation .

On 16 July 2010, subsidies for petrol, diesel and LPG were cut as part of Malaysia's general programme of reducing and rationalising subsidies per the 10th Malaysia Plan and the New Economic Model. The government believes it will save RM 750 million by the end of 2010 through these measures with little negative impact on most citizens. Sugar and fuel subsidies were selected for reform because they disproportionately benefit the wealthy and foreigners, encourage over-consumption and create opportunities for fraud and smuggling.

He said, \"there is no logic in the government allocating subsidies worth almost RM1 billion on a commodity that could endanger the people's health\".Subsidy cuts my solve sugar 'shortages', Malaysia Insider, 22 July 2010 Responding to concerns about how these reforms might affect the poor, the Prime Minister's Office pointed out that Malaysia will still be spending RM 7.82 billion per year on fuel and sugar subsidies and that prices for these commodities would remain the lowest in Southeast Asia.

The approval of these licenses is a sharp break from Malaysia's history of domestically dominated and tightly regulated markets for financial services. The International Institute for Management Development responded to these and other reforms by increasing Malaysia's ranking to the 10th-most competitive economy in the world in 2010 from 18th in 2009. Malaysia, which is now ranked fifth in the Asia Pacific region, scored well in business and government efficiency. Economists attributed the rise of Malaysia's ranking to the efforts of the Malaysian government to improve the country's business environment such as the New Economic Model, the Government Transformation Programme and the Economic Transformation Programme.Top ten: Malaysia rises up competitiveness ranking, By Jagdev Singh Sidhu, The Star, 20 May 2010 ====Stimulus packages==== The Malaysian government passed two stimulus packages to mitigate the effects of the global economic downturn.

During the summit, the ASEAN-Korea Investment Agreement was signed to boost economic and trade relations between ASEAN and South Korea After the summit, Najib said Malaysia is keen on emulating South Korea in developing a small-scale nuclear reactor for power generation, as well as South Korea's other low-carbon green technology.\"Signing of FTA signifies success of ASEAN- Korea Summit\", Bernama, 3 June 2009 ====China==== Najib made a four-day visit to China on 2\u20135 June 2009. During the visit, Najib mentioned his family's special relationship with China, noting that his father, and Malaysia's second Prime Minister, first established diplomatic relations with China in 1974. During the visit, several substantive issues were discussed in meetings between Najib and Chinese President Hu Jintao and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. The two sides signed an endorsed strategic action plan covering 13 major areas, which will serve as the guideline for relations between Malaysia and China. Najib described the trip as most fruitful. Najib also received an honorary doctorate in international relations from the Beijing Foreign Studies University.\"Najib's visit marks milestone in Malaysia-China friendship\". The Star, 4 June 2009 ====Indonesia==== Najib with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in Putrajaya on 18 December 2012. Najib made a visit to Indonesia on 22\u201324 April 2009. Several issues were discussed, including co-operation in the tourism, oil and gas, and high-technology industries, as well as electricity supply from the Bakun dam to Kalimantan. Najib and his entourage also attended an official dinner hosted by Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and his wife Ani Yudhoyono. ====New Zealand==== Under Najib's government, Malaysia signed a free-trade agreement (FTA) with New Zealand on 26 October 2009 to take effect 1 August 2010. The agreement will reduce or eliminate tariffs on thousands of industrial and agricultural products. The two countries have also agreed to reciprocate most-favoured nation status in private education, engineering services, environmental protection, mining services and information technology. ====Myanmar==== In a protest rally in December 2016, Najib criticized the Myanmar authorities for military crackdown on Rohingya Muslims, and described the ongoing persecution as \"genocide\". ====Philippines and the Moro people of Mindanao==== President Rodrigo Duterte and his delegation meeting with Najib and other Malaysian ministers in Perdana Square, Putrajaya, 10 November 2016. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front has always favoured Malaysia as a mediator in their effort of becoming an autonomous state. On 15 October 2012, the Moro rebel and the Philippines authority has devised a peace agreement to maintain the safety and security of the nation. Malaysia plays an important part in making this particular notion to be accepted by both parties. During the official ceremony of signing the agreement, the Malaysian government was invited as a witness to the long due treaty. Malaysia plays an important part, not just as a mediator but also as a confidante for both the Philippines government and also the rebel. == 14th Malaysian general election == Malaysia held its 14th general election in May 2018. Barisan Nasional was dealt a surprising defeat, failing to win a majority for the first time in the country's history. Observers credited the unpopular Goods and Services Tax as well as the swirling 1MDB corruption scandal as key factors in the defeat. ==Election results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\" |+ Pahang State Legislative Assembly !Year !Constituency !colspan=2| !Votes !Pct !colspan=2|Opponent(s) !Votes !Pct !Ballots cast !Majority !Turnout |- | 1982 | Bandar Pekan | | | (UMNO) | align=\"right\" |3,820 | 72.50% | | | Mohamed Rusdi Arif (PAS) | align=\"right\" |1,449 | 27.50% | 5,377 | 2,371 | 73.37% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\" |+ Parliament of Malaysia !Year !Constituency !colspan=2| !Votes !Pct !colspan=2|Opponent(s) !Votes !Pct !Ballots cast !Majority !Turnout |- |1976 |rowspan=\"2\"|P71 Pekan, Pahang | | | (UMNO) |align=\"right\" | None |None | colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"dcdcdc\"|Unopposed |- |1978 | | | (UMNO) |align=\"right\" |13,876 |76.16% | | |Mohamed Rusdi Arif (PAS) |align=\"right\" | 4,343 |23.84% | |9,533 | |- |1986 |rowspan=\"2\"|P76 Pekan, Pahang | | | (UMNO) |align=\"right\" |16,431 |74.50% | | |Ali Abdullah Lee (PAS) |align=\"right\" |5,623 |25.50% |22,748 |10,808 |66.87% |- |1990 | | | (UMNO) |align=\"right\" |21,262 |66.33% | | |Othman Hitam (S46) |align=\"right\" |10,795 |33.67% |33,414 |10,467 |71.36% |- |1995 |rowspan=\"3\"|P80 Pekan, Pahang | | | (UMNO) |align=\"right\" |17,004 |73.25% | | |M.

On 12 May 2018, three days after he lost the general elections, a flight manifest stated that Najib and his wife, Rosmah were taking a private jet to Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport in Jakarta. In response, the Immigration Department, upon the orders of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, imposed a travel ban barring their exit from the country. Amidst the country's mood turning against him, Najib resigned as the leader of UMNO and Barisan Nasional on the same day. The newly elected Pakatan Harapan government swiftly reopened investigations into the 1MDB scandal. Since 16 May 2018, the Malaysian police have searched six properties linked to Najib and Rosmah as part of the investigation into the 1MDB scandal. They have seized 284 boxes filled with designer handbags, 72 large luggage bags containing cash in multiple currencies, and other valuables. The Malaysian police commissioner confirmed that the police seized goods with an estimated value of between US$223 and US$273 million. The police described it as the biggest seizure in Malaysian history. In January 2019, a 7-second video clip of Najib uttered \"Malu Apa Bossku\" ( \"What\u2019s there to be ashamed of my boss\") went viral on the internet. Najib later released a picture of him posed on a Yamaha Y150 motorcycle with the registration plate 8055KU (BOSSKU). The catchphrase and the picture went viral on social media, especially with Malay youths, and inspired videos, memes, t-shirts, caps, vehicle stickers and a music video. The phenomenon has contributed to Najib's rise in popularity. Najib also claimed that his \"Bossku\" phenomenon has contributed to a victory for his party in 2020 Kimanis by-election. == Controversies == === The Altantuyaa Affair === The French courts are investigating allegations of corruption in the purchases of two submarines, by the Malaysian Ministry of Defence in 2002, at a time when Najib was the minister of defence. The allegations are that Abdul Razak Baginda, an aide of Najib, received \"commission\" payments from the French submarine builder DCNS. Shaariibuugiin Altantuyaa, a Mongolian woman hired as a French translator to facilitate the purchase of the submarines and mistress to Baginda, subsequently tried to blackmail Baginda for a $500,000 cut and was subsequently murdered. 2 policemen, who were bodyguards posted to Najib, were charged and found guilty. === 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal === Najib is the chairman of 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a state- owned investment firm that was established on Najib's initiative in 2009 as part of the government's Economic Transformation Programme. However, 1MDB has reportedly incurred debts of MYR 42 billion (about US$11.1 billion) after only six years of operations, prompting a negative outlook on the country's economic growth.Malaysian leader faces risk of criminal charges over fund . ABC News, 5 July 2015. Retrieved 7 July 2015. On 2 July 2015, The Wall Street Journal ran an expos\u00e9 alleging that MYR 2.672 billion (US$700 million) had been channelled from 1MDB into Najib's personal bank accounts, triggering widespread calls for his resignation.Zaid: Najib's finest hour when he steps down.

Retrieved 7 July 2015. Najib has denied any wrongdoing and has announced plans to sue the newspaper for libel but eventually failed to do so. On 6 July 2015, amid the 1MDB scandal, the ringgit fell to 3.8050 against the US dollar, the first time it slid beyond the 3.80 currency peg, which was lifted in 2005.Ringgit slides through Mahathir's peg as Najib's finances probed . The Malay Mail Online, 6 July 2015. Retrieved 7 July 2015. To back up the allegations, on 7 July 2015, The Wall Street Journal released a batch of partially redacted documents that purportedly show how nearly US$700 million (RM2.6 billion) was moved from 1MDB into Najib's personal bank accounts. These documents relate to transactions in March 2013, December 2014 and February 2015. The multi-agency task force investigating these allegations reported on 10 July 2015 that Najib's bank accounts at AmBank Islamic were closed before The Wall Street Journal reported the transfers of billions of ringgit to those accounts thereby confirming that Najib had two accounts at that bank. The task force also confirmed that the six accounts it had just frozen did not belong to Najib but did not name the holders of those accounts Najib's handling of the corruption scandal was criticised by, among others, former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and then Deputy Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin. During Najib's mid-term Cabinet reshuffle on 28 July 2015, Najib dropped Muhyiddin from his position as Deputy Prime Minister, as well as other Ministers who had been critical of his leadership. Najib stated that the reason for this was to create a more \"unified team\". On 1 August 2015, Najib addressed UMNO delegates in Seremban and in a clear reference to the Sarawak Report, the London-based whistleblower site founded and operated by journalist Clare Rewcastle-Brown, demanded that \"white people\" stay out of Malaysia's affairs and stressed that he valued loyalty above all, and not smart people. On 3 August 2015, the Malaysian Anti- Corruption Commission stated that the RM 2.6 billion that had been banked into Najib's personal account came from donors, not 1MDB, but did not elaborate on who the donors were or why the funds were transferred, nor why this explanation had taken so long to emerge since the allegations were first made on 2 July 2015. Umno Kuantan division chief Wan Adnan Wan Mamat later claimed that the RM 2.6 billion is from Saudi Arabia as thanks for fighting ISIS. He further claimed that the Muslim community in the Philippines as well as southern Thailand had also received similar donations, and that since the donations were made to Najib personally as opposed to UMNO, the funds were deposited into Najib's personal accounts. The scandal took a dramatic twist on 28 August 2015 when a member of Najib's own party, Anina Saaduddin, UMNO's Langkawi Wanita (women's) representative, filed a civil suit against him alleging a breach of duties as trustee and that he defrauded party members by failing to disclose receipt of the donated funds, and account for their use. This suit was filed in the Kuala Lumpur High Court and also named party Executive Secretary Abdul Rauf Yusof. Expressing fear that Najib would wield influence to remove any member of UMNO \"for the sole purpose of avoiding liability\" the court was also being moved for an injunction to restrain UMNO, its Supreme Council, state liaison body, divisions and branches from removing the nominal plaintiff as a party member pending the determination of the suit. The plaintiff is also seeking a repayment amounting to US$650 million, the amount allegedly deposited by Najib to a Singapore bank, an account of all monies that he had received in the form of donations, details of all monies in the AmPrivate Banking Account No 2112022009694 allegedly belonging to Najib, along with damages, costs, and other reliefs. On 21 September 2015, the New York Times reported that US investigators were investigating allegations of corruption involving Najib as well as people close to him. In particular, investigators were focused on properties in the United States that were purchased in recent years by shell companies owned by Najib's stepson Riza Aziz or connected to a close family friend, as well as a $681 million payment made to what is believed to be Najib's personal bank account. The claimed MYR 2.6 billion \"donation\" into Najib's personal accounts led the opposition to table a no-confidence motion against Najib, on 18 October 2015. On 26 January 2016, Malaysia's Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali announced that the investigation into the $681 million payment into Najib's personal bank account had been closed. The Anti-Corruption Commission investigating the gift, led by Apandi, concluded that no laws had been broken and that the gift did not amount to graft. Apandi was appointed attorney general by Najib in August 2015 after the previous attorney general, Abdul Gani Patail, was abruptly dismissed by Najib. Although Bernama, Malaysia's state-run news service, reported that Abdul Gani was removed for health reasons many speculated that his dismissal was related to the 1MDB corruption investigation. The Attorney General then said that the [Saudi Royal Family] was the source of the $681 million gift, although doubts remain as the Saudi ministries of foreign affairs and finance had no information on said gift. The previously unidentified investor Najib was reported to have returned $620 million to the Saudi royal family in 2013, but no explanation was given as to the reason for the investment or what happened to the $61 million Najib did not return. Najib hailed the results of the investigation and reiterated his denial of any wrongdoing. On 28 March 2016, the Australian television programme Four Corners in an episode called State of Fear: Murder and Money in Malaysia, aired new allegations about the large sums of money that have flowed into the bank accounts of Najib Razak. On 30 March 2016, the Wall Street Journal, Time and several other news agencies reported that Prime Minister Najib Razak and his wife, Rosmah Mansor had spent $15 million on luxury goods and extravagant travel expenses. During Najib Razak's golf diplomacy with U.S. President Barack Obama on 24 December 2014, Malaysian investigation documents show that Rosmah Mansor had purchased items amounting to $130,625 at a Chanel store in Honolulu, Hawaii. The allegation was confirmed when a store employee at the Chanel store in the upscale Ala Moana Center recalls Mr. Najib's wife shopping there just before 25 December 2014. In April 2016, Mohd Nazifuddin Najib, the son of Najib Razak, has been named in the Panama Papers. In July 2016, the United States Department of Justice launched a civil lawsuit to seize American assets worth over US$1 billion (4.1 billion MYR) allegedly obtained from US$3.5 billion (14.38 billion MYR) of misappropriated 1MDB funds. Within the civil lawsuit, a government official of high rank who had control over 1MDB was referred to as \"Malaysian Official 1\", and mentioned over 30 times. \"Malaysian Official 1\" was alleged to have received around US$681 million (2.797 billion MYR) of stolen 1MDB money via Falcon Bank, Singapore on 21 and 25 March 2013, of which US$650 million (2.0 billion MYR) was sent back to Falcon Bank on 30 August 2013. In September 2016, Najib was identified as \"Malaysian Official 1\" by Datuk Abdul Rahman Dahlan, Minister in the Prime Minister's Department and the Barisan Nasional strategic communications director. Dahlan also claimed that Najib was not named because he was \"not part of this investigation\". On 15 June 2017, The United States Department of Justice followed up on its July 2016 lawsuit by issuing a civil action in rem to forfeit assets involved in and traceable to an international conspiracy to launder money misappropriated from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (\"a strategic investment and development company wholly-owned by the government of Malaysia\"). The writ provided detailed justifications for seeing to forfeit specific items and property located in the United States and abroad, including in the United Kingdom and Switzerland. As a consequence of the 15 June 2017 writ, on 28 February 2018 Indonesian authorities seized the luxury yacht linked to the 1MDB investigations in waters off Bali, on behalf of the FBI. Additionally, on 7 March 2018 in Californian courts, the producers of the 'Wolf of Wall Street' agreed to pay $60m to settle Justice Department claims it financed the movie with money siphoned from 1MDB. On 3 July 2018, Najib was arrested by Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission at his residence in Jalan Duta, Kuala Lumpur. The arrest was carried out in relation to the commission's investigation into the SRC International issue. While under investigation, Najib claimed that the Barisan Nasional government actually left behind a country which had a strong and solid economy to Pakatan Harapan. The strong economy, said the former prime minister, was achieved through transformative policies and comprehensive economic management, recognised by the World Bank and World Economic Forum (WEF). On 10 September 2018, Najib posted a copy of the letter that purportedly came from Prince Saud Abdulaziz Al-Saud of Saudi Arabia on his Facebook account, as a proof of the alleged financial donation of US$100mil (RM304.5mil) given to him in 2011. He said he decided to reveal the documents in a bid to clear his name of various accusations and slander, and will continue to do so on his social media accounts. ====Subsequent arrest, legal proceedings and conviction==== On 3 July 2018, Najib was arrested by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC). The MACC is investigating how RM42 million (US$10.6 million) went from SRC International into Najib's bank account. The following day, Najib was indicted in the High Court in Kuala Lumpur on three counts of criminal breach of trust and one count of abuse of power in connection with SRC International funds totalling RM42 million. He was granted bail at RM1 million after pleading not guilty with his trial set for 18 February 2019. On 8 August 2018, Najib was charged with three further counts of money laundering as part of the MACC's investigation into the 1MDB scandal. Najib has denied making three transfers totaling RM42 from SRC International into his bank accounts. On 19 September 2018, Najib was arrested following two hours of questioning by the MACC, believed to be in relation to the RM2.6 billion donation he received in year 2013. Najib was charged on 20 September 2018 at the Sessions Court in Jalan Duta. However, he pleaded not guilty and was released on bail after his court appearance. On 21 September, he made a brief appearance at the Sessions Court registry to sign his bail at RM3.5 million for 25 counts of money laundering and abuse of power charges in relation to 1MDB. He has posted RM1 million for his bail, while the remaining RM2.5 million will be settled in instalments by the following week. In August 2019, during his second trial, Najib faces four charges of abuse of power and 21 charges of money laundering for receiving illegal transfers of RM 2.3 billion between 2011 and 2014. On 28 July 2020, the High Court convicted Najib guilty on all seven counts of abuse of power, money laundering and criminal breach of trust in relation to the SRC International case, becoming the first Prime Minister of Malaysia to be convicted of corruption. High Court judge Mohamad Nazlan bin Mohamad Ghazali has delivered the verdict regarding the misappropriation of RM42 million (US$10 million) from SRC International, a former subsidiary of 1MDB. In total, Najib faces 42 charges, of which 35 are yet to be decided on. On the day of his conviction, Najib was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment and a fine of RM210 million (for the first charge). He was also given six concurrent sentences of 10 years' imprisonment for the other six charges. If he fails to pay the fine, he will be serving another five years in prison. He would be appealing against the verdict of the High Court. He also faces another four trials for the rest of the charges he has yet be tried for. The High Court granted a stay of execution of the conviction with an increase bail of RM 2 million with reporting to the police on the first and the fifth day of every month. ==Honours== ===Honours of Malaysia=== * : ** 50px Member of the Supreme Order of Sri Mahawangsa (DMK) \u2013 Dato' Seri Utama (2008) * : ** 50px Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Crown of Kelantan (SPMK) \u2013 Dato' (2004) * : ** 50px Knight Grand Commander of the Order of Malacca (DUNM) \u2013 Datuk Seri Utama (2007) * : ** revoked 26 October 2018) * : ** 50px Grand Knight of the Order of Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang (SSAP) \u2013 Dato' Sri (1985) ** 50px Member 2nd class of the Family Order of the Crown of Indra of Pahang (DKII) (2010) * : ** 50px Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Defender of State (DUPN) - Datuk Seri Utama (2009) * : ** 50px Ordinary Class of the Perak Family Order of Sultan Azlan Shah (SPSA) \u2013 Dato' Seri Diraja (2004) * : ** 50px Knight Grand Companion of the Order of the Gallant Prince Syed Sirajuddin Jamalullail (SSSJ) \u2013 Dato' Seri Diraja (2007) * : ** 50px Grand Commander of the Order of Kinabalu (SPDK) \u2013 Datuk Seri Panglima (2002) * : ** 50px Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of Sarawak (PNBS) \u2013 Dato' Sri (1990) ** 50px Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak (DP) \u2013 Datuk Patinggi (2008) * : ** suspended 6 May 2019) ** suspended 6 May 2019) ===Foreign honours=== * : ** 50px Family Order of Brunei 1st Class (DK) \u2013 Dato Laila Utama (2010) ==Notes and references== ==External links== * * * |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:People from Pahang Category:Malaysian people of Bugis descent Category:Malaysian people of Malay descent Category:Malaysian Muslims Category:Children of Prime Ministers of Malaysia Category:Leaders of political parties in Malaysia Category:United Malays National Organisation politicians Category:Members of the Dewan Rakyat Category:Prime Ministers of Malaysia Category:Deputy Prime Ministers of Malaysia Category:Government ministers of Malaysia Category:Defence ministers of Malaysia Category:Education ministers of Malaysia Category:Finance ministers of Malaysia Category:Members of the Pahang State Legislative Assembly Category:Chief Ministers of Pahang Category:Pahang state executive councillors Category:People educated at Malvern College Category:Alumni of the University of Nottingham Category:Grand Commanders of the Order of Kinabalu Category:Knights Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of Sarawak Category:Knights Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak Category:20th-century Malaysian politicians Category:21st-century Malaysian politicians ",
