One-term incumbent Democrat Stephen Mallory II was therefore appointed to begin the term, pending a special election. === Florida (Special) === Democratic incumbent Stephen Mallory II was elected April 22, 1903 to finish the term. == Georgia == == Idaho == == Illinois == == Indiana == == Iowa == There were two elections due to the death of John H. Gear in 1900. === Iowa (Regular) === Senator William B. Allison Five-term William B. Allison was re-elected to a sixth term January 22, 1902. He was Chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, effectively the leader of the Senate. === Iowa (Special) === Senator Jonathan P. Dolliver First-term Republican John H. Gear had died July 14, 1900 and Republican Jonathan P. Dolliver had been appointed August 22, 1900 to finish the term ending in 1901 and to the term beginning thereafter, pending a special election. Dolliver was elected January 22, 1902 to finish the term that would end in 1907. == Kansas == == Kentucky == == Louisiana == == Maryland == == Michigan (Special) == == Missouri == == Nevada == == New Hampshire == == New Jersey (Special) == == New York == The election in New York was held on January 20, 1903 by the New York State Legislature. Republican Thomas C. Platt had previously been re- elected to this seat in 1897, and his term would expire on March 3, 1903. At the State election in November 1902, 28 Republicans and 22 Democrats were elected for a two-year term (1903-1904) in the State Senate; and 89 Republicans and 61 Democrats were elected for the session of 1903 to the Assembly. State Senator Patrick F. Trainor who had been re-elected, died on December 25, 1902, and his successor Peter J. Dooling was elected only after the senatorial election, on January 27. The 126th New York State Legislature met from January 6 to April 23, 1903, at Albany, New York. The Republican caucus met on January 19. 25 State senators and 84 assemblymen attended, and State Senator William W. Armstrong presided. The caucus re-nominated the incumbent U.S. Senator Thomas C. Platt almost unanimously. A single vote was cast for U.S. Secretary of War Elihu Root by Assemblyman William A. Denison, of Jefferson County. Besides Denison voting against Platt, a small number of anti-Platt men did not attend the caucus. Boss Platt had forced the nomination of Attorney General John C. Davies to the New York Supreme Court in the 5th District, against the local Republican organization's wishes who accused Davies of incompetence. Davies was defeated in a landslide by Democrat Watson M. Rogers although the 5th District was heavily Republican. Thus boss Platt's power began to wane. {| class=wikitable |+1903 Republican caucus for United States Senator result ! Candidate ! First ballot |- | \u221a Thomas C. Platt | align=\"right\" | 108 |- | Elihu Root | align=\"right\" | 1 |} The Democratic caucus met also on January 19. All 62 State legislators attended, and Assemblyman Charles W. Hinson, of Erie County, presided. They nominated John B. Stanchfield unanimously. Stanchfield had been Mayor of Elmira, and was defeated when running for Governor of New York in 1900 by Republican Benjamin B. Odell, Jr. Thomas C. Platt was the choice of both the Assembly and the State Senate, and was declared elected. Three Republican anti-Platt men, State senators Edgar T. Brackett (28th D.), Elon R. Brown and Nathaniel A. Elsberg (15th D.), voted for Elihu Root. {| class=wikitable |+1903 United States Senator election result !
