    "text": "Paul Bonga Bonga (born 25 April 1933 in Ebonda) was a Congolese footballer of the 1950s and 1960s. A midfielder, he rose to prominence during his time in Belgium at Standard Liege and was perhaps best remembered as the first African footballer to be selected in the World Soccer Magazine world XI, when he was chosen in 1962. Bonga started playing football barefoot, in 1948 for the Golden Lion and then for Sporting, St. Anne College team. In 1950, he joined Union and put on his first boots. He was transferred in 1952 to Daring Club Motema Pembe. In 1956, while on a European tour, he was noticed by sports journalists, particularly for his match against the Standard Liege. In late 1957 he was invited to Standard, and became Belgian champion in the seasons of 1958\u20131960. In 1962, he became the second European player, after Paul van Himst. After playing for more than 10 years in Belgian clubs, Bonga retired in 1970 and became a coach at FC Tubize. After returning home in 1972, Bonga led Daring Club Motema Pembe before assuming the post of President Sportif. In 1991, he was appointed National Technical Director of the Leopards (present- day Simba). ==Career== *1948 \u2013 1951 : Lion d'or, puis Sporting Club *1952 \u2013 1954 : Union *1954 \u2013 1957 : Daring Club Motema Pembe *1956: M\u00e9daille d'or de l'association \"Royale Sportive Congolaise\" *1957 \u2013 1963 : Standard de Li\u00e8ge (Belgique) *1961: Plaquette + prix de l'effort Sportif de la ville de Li\u00e8ge *1962: **M\u00e9daille d'or troph\u00e9e Pappaert (Journal les sports de Bruxelles) **M\u00e9daille de bronze du Minist\u00e8re de la sant\u00e9 et de la famille de Li\u00e8ge **Soulier d'argent (2\u00e8me meilleur joueur Europ\u00e9en) *1963 \u2013 1967 : Sporting de Charleroi *1968 \u2013 1970: Moteur brevet\u00e9/Ecole des entra\u00efneur \u00e0 Heysel 1972 \u2013 1973 : Entra\u00eeneur DCMP *1976: M\u00e9daille d'or / m\u00e9rite sportif Congolais *1981: Pr\u00e9sident du DCMP *1984 \u2013 1991: Directeur Technique National et Membre de la Fecofa ==See also== *L\u00e9on Mokuna ==References== Category:1933 births Category:Living people Category:People from Mongala Category:Belgian Congo people Category:Association football midfielders Category:Democratic Republic of the Congo footballers Category:Democratic Republic of the Congo expatriate footballers Category:Daring Club Motema Pembe players Category:Standard Li\u00e8ge players Category:R.
