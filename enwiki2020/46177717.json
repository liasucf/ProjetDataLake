Headquartered in Germany under the name MEVA Schalungs-System GmbH, the MEVA group has 40 subsidiaries, plants and logistics centers on 5 continents. == Business == MEVA designs, constructs, produces and markets frame formwork systems for all types of in-situ concrete applications in the building industry. MEVA\u2019s product portfolio is completed by the company\u2019s service and consulting packages for formwork users. == History == MEVA was founded in 1970 by Gerhard Dingler. The idea of developing a formwork system that would be re- usable led to the company\u2019s foundation and to the first frame-based panelised formwork system with a facing integrated into a metal frame, the so-called formwork panel. The panels are produced in different sizes and can be freely combined, hence the name modular formwork system. In the course of its history, MEVA developed several innovations, part of which have become standard features in the industry. The milestones:About MEVA *1971 \u2013 MEVA presents the first modular panelised formwork system. *1977 \u2013 MEVA invents the formwork clamp that connects panels tightly and firmly. *1978 \u2013 The frame with hollow profiles and grooves is presented. It is lighter than previous frames, supports a higher fresh concrete pressure and is easier to clean as no dirt can enter the closed hollow profiles.MEVA frame profile *1981 \u2013 The first crane-independent formwork system for walls and slabs is marketed. *1982 \u2013 MEVA\u2019s Mammut wall formwork system is the first heavy-duty system offering a fresh concrete load capacity of 97 kN/m\u00b2. *1989 \u2013 MEVA develops the aluminium wall formwork system. *1992 \u2013 The crane-independent MevaDec slab system offers 3 methods for all types of slabs. *2000 \u2013 MEVA presents the first all-plastic facing and is the first formwork producer to use this kind of facing in all formwork systems. Contrary to wooden facing, the all-plastic facing lasts as long as the panel frame, can be cleaned with high-pressure cleaners and repaired with identical material on the construction site and delivers a consistently high-quality concrete surface. MEVA\u2019s all-plastic facing alkus alkus product information comes with a 7-year long term warranty that so far has never been claimed.history of alkus - milestones *2012 \u2013 MEVA\u2019s automatic climbing system MAC is used on sites in Europe after several years of use in Australia and the Far East.MEVA Automatic Climbing MAC ==Product and Service Portfolio== MEVA offers standard formwork systems for all types of in-situ concrete applications and also designs and produces special formwork and solutions for special requirements such as irregular building geometries or surfaces without joints. The systems are highly compatible and use identical accessories wherever possible.
