The company has captured a major chunk of market share in Bollywood Music in a short span of time. == History == During the launch of the company in 2014, Punit Goenka, CEO and Managing Director of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, the parent company of Zee Music Company said- \" the music industry is a large playing field and there is scope to explore the opportunity in this market. Technology has also emerged as a key transformer of the music industry and digital revenues are driving growth in the market. Since we are a content company, it is essential to own intellectual property as content is the king.\" Since then, it has entered stiff competition against T-Series. The journey began with Hawaa Hawaai and since then, it has extended itself to various reprise and acoustic cover versions of its own songs. Some of its most successful music rights deals include those with Fox Star Studios, UTV Software Communications, Balaji Motion Pictures, Excel Entertainment, Viacom 18 Motion Pictures and Bhansali Productions. In 2018, Zee Music Company and other music label Sony Music India has decided to have negotiations of merging companies still by the name of Zee Music Company. They would take the rights of half of the Dharma Productions and other studios movies music rights. == Soundtracks under acquisition == ;Hindi Some of the company's most popular Bollywood albums include: ===1989 (Zee Music Rewind)=== *Maine Pyar ha *ChaalBaaz' ===1994 (Zee Music Rewind)=== * Dushman Duniya Ka ===1997 (Zee Music Rewind)=== *Pardes ===1999 (Zee Music Rewind)=== *Taal *Hum Saath Saath Hain *Kaala Samrajya ===2000 (Zee Music Rewind)=== * Khiladi 420 ===2001 (Zee Music Rewind)=== * Gadar: Ek Prem Katha * One 2 Ka 4 * Aks ===2003 (Zee Music Rewind)=== * Kuch Naa Kaho * Chori Chori ===2004 (Zee Music Rewind)=== * Kyun!
