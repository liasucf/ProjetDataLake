    "text": "Agatheira was a town of ancient Lydia, inhabited during Hellenistic times. Its site is located near Halitpa\u015fa in Asiatic Turkey. This colony was called a katoikiai, along with Magnesia-by-Sipylus, Hyrcanis, and Thyateira. They were separated from one another by about fifteen kilometers. Evidence show that Macedonians settled in this town such as an inscription at Hyrcanis, which contained insights regarding the settlers' organizational structure. There was also a record that cited Macedonian settlers honoring a certain Seleukos son of Menekrates during the reign of Eumenes II (188-158 BC). This event transpired during a period of \"polisification\" of the non-polis colonial settlements in west Anatolia. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Lydia Category:Former populated places in Turkey Category:History of Manisa Province ",
