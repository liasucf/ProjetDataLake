The cholera outbreak originated in Glenview, a suburb in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital city, and then spread to the following provinces in Zimbabwe: Manicaland, Mashonaland East, Mashonaland West, Bulawayo, Mashonaland Central, Midlands, Masvingo and Matebeleland South. The last report from the World Health Organization (WHO) Afro regional office has listed the outbreak as a closed event with the outbreak running from 6 September 2018 to 12 March 2019.World Health Organization, 2019.

These shortages led to sanitation issues as people began to use unregulated wells and boreholes, leading people in Harare drinking contaminated water. The deteriorating sanitation infrastructure is leading to issues such as raw sewage flowing in areas of Harare. Another sanitation issue was the informal traders selling items such as fruit exacerbating the outbreak. Four cholera treatment centers were set up in Harare to deal with the initial outbreaking cholera. The WHO began a campaign to vaccinate 1.4 million people in Harare against cholera for people living in areas at most risk of contracting the disease in October 2018.World Health Organization, 2018a.
