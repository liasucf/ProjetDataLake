St Peter's Church has a 15th-century tower, a 17th-century lychgate and a Norman font. The church tenor bell was recently restored through donations from the village and can now be heard every Sunday morning during the church service. Berrynarbor has won many awards including Best Kept Village and Britain in Bloom. The community shop which opened in 2008 won the 2008 Countryside Alliance Award for the best village shop/post office in the South West of England. Every year the village hosts a show which involves some of the locals and primary school children. In July the school hosts a fete in the Manor hall and park. This helps raise money for various charities. ==History== Mural monument to Richard Berrie, Berrynarbor Church The Berrie family were lords of the manor of \"Berrie Nerbert\" in the 17th century, as the inscriptions on the two tablets under the Berrie mural monument witness. The manor later came into the possession of the Bassett family, previously seated at Heanton Punchardon, which in the 19th century built Watermouth Castle within the manor, for their principal residence. ==Historic estates== The parish contains the following historic estates: ;Lee :Directly adjoining the village to the north is the neighbourhood or locality of Lee, divided into Lee Wood and three main estates, few of which are subdivided as each is a relatively small mixed residential/agricultural holding Middle Lee, North Lee and South Lee. ;Hagginton Hill and Goosewell :Contiguous to Lee, climbing the road to Ilfracombe in a long northern curve is a line of property forming these settlements.
