Now unemployed and broke in France, he encounters the wealthy widow of a French general. Anne de Villemont is attracted to Reno, and he to her, but she keeps him at arm's length. She also hires him to tutor her eight-year-old son Paul. The real reason she wants Reno is for protection. Reno is led to believe that Anne's husband was killed in the Algerian conflict, and he is troubled by Anne's intense fear that Paul will be kidnapped. He then discovers the family has ties to a fascist organization that plans to take over all of Europe. He takes on the shady psychiatrist Morillon and mysterious family friend Leschenhaut, both of whom frighten Anne whenever they are around. Reno is framed for his best friend's murder as he and Anne become the targets of the ambitious and maniacal schemers who wish to rule Europe. Reno and Anne are hunted around France while protecting Paul from being abducted. The chase ends at the Colosseum in Rome, where Reno and the villains engage in a showdown. ==Cast== * George Peppard as Reno Davis * Inger Stevens as Anne de Villemont * Orson Welles as Charles Leschenhaut * Keith Michell as Morillon * Maxine Audley as Mathilde Rosier * William Job as Bernard Bourdon * Peter Bayliss as Edmond Vosier * Patience Collier as Gabrielle de Villemont * Barnaby Shaw as Paul de Villemont * Ave Ninchi as Signora Braggi * Renzo Palmer as The Monk * Francesco Mul\u00e9 as Trevi policeman * Rosemarie Dexter as Daniella Braggi * Raoul Delfosse as Louis Le Buc * Perrette Pradier as Jeanne-Marie * Genevi\u00e8ve Cluny as Veronique * James Mishler as Jesse Hardee * Jean Louis as Driot * Jacques Roux as Maguy * Jean H\u00e9bey as French conductor ==Production== The film was based on a novel by Stanley Ellin.
