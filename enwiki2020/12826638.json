Vastag, Science News Vol.172 No.3, 21 July 2007 One variation of HCP5 appears to provide some delay or resistance to the development of AIDS when a person is infected with HIV. This variation of HCP5 frequently occurs in conjunction with a particular version of an immune system gene called HLA-B. HCP5 has been reported to become upregulated after human papillomavirus infection and may promote the development of cervical cancer. ==Notes and references== Category:Genomics Category:Endogenous retroviruses ",
