Also known as Burger King Drive-Inn, it was founded by former Imperial Oil executives William R. Jarvis (1926-21 July 2014) and James Duncan Rae (3 September 1923 - 17 December 2014) in 1956. Among the first American-style fast food restaurants in Edmonton, it was not related to the worldwide Burger King chain. Company headquarters were in offices above one of the restaurants, at 9501 111 Avenue. Its signature items included a mushroom burger and a \"Canadian Burger\". The restaurant was inspired by a visit Jarvis paid to Great Falls, Montana in 1953, when he stayed next to a Dairy Queen drive-in. After the chain turned down his request for a franchise, he and Rae formed their own Dairy Drive-In at 8705 118 Avenue. Two years later, when their lease expired, they hauled the building to a site at 112 Avenue, where it would become the first Burger King. It opened one year before the first outlet of what would become its main rival, A&W.; The US chain entered the Canadian market in 1969 with a store in Windsor, Ontario. In 1973, Jarvis and Rae reached an agreement that granted their rival the rights to the \"Burger King\" name for all of Canada except Alberta north of the 52nd parallel, passing through Innisfail, which was reserved in perpetuity for the local chain. By 1975, when McDonald's opened its first Edmonton restaurant near Capilano Mall, Burger King had 12 outlets. At the time, the company held a franchise for Kentucky Fried Chicken in Edmonton, with its outlets using dual branding. However, as the market became more competitive, the relationship between the two companies deteriorated, with KFC attempting legal action to end the partnership. The matter was ultimately resolved in 1990, when KFC, then under the ownership of PepsiCo, refused to extend the franchise, and Jarvis and Rae instead sold their remaining dual-branded restaurants to them. In August 1995, when two non-KFC Burger King restaurants were still in operation, they sold the naming rights for northern Alberta for $1 million to the US company. It immediately announced its intention to enter the market, the last region of North America where it had been unable to operate, other than Mattoon, Illinois, where another restaurant uses the name. Several Burger King restaurants became Burger Barons. ==See also== * Burger King legal issues * Hungry Jack's * List of hamburger restaurants ==References== Category:Defunct restaurants in Canada Category:Burger King Category:Organizations based in Edmonton Category:1956 establishments in Alberta Category:Drive-in restaurants Category:Fast-food chains of Canada Category:Fast-food hamburger restaurants Category:Restaurants established in 1956 Category:Restaurants disestablished in 1995 ",
