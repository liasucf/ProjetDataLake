She breaks into a top-secret SHIELD facility looking for proof and finds that Fury's bullet-ridden \"body\" is actually an LMD. Carter takes the head of the LMD to Tony Stark. He admits to having helped build it for Fury, and uses the circuitry within to gather a clue: \"Fallen Angel.\" The clue leads Carter to explore Fury's private office in a sunken SHIELD Helicarrier. However, SHIELD's arranged for security to protect the tech in the sunken Helicarrier, and they comes after her. She escapes and uses the data gained to find an energy portal hidden under the site of the original SHIELD building. She jumps through the portal, which turns out to be a time portal. Carter runs into Fury in the middle of WWII, and after holding him at gunpoint, reluctantly helps him fight off Nazis and link up with the other Howling Commandos. Fury explains that they're not actually in the past, but in a pocket-dimension shaped by the willpower of those within it. He says he had received coded messages from Fallen Angel, the supposedly-dead original director of SHIELD. When he reached the location, Fallen Angel pushed him through the portal and then committed suicide. Fury tells Carter that they have to find another portal in this pocket-dimension in order to get back to reality. As the two work together to make it home, Fury explains to Carter that the reason he left her out in the cold was that he assumed she really was dead. After that they reach a portal back to reality. ==Prints== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=100% border=\"1\" | align=\"center\" | No. | align=\"center\" | Title | align=\"center\" | Cover date | align=\"center\" | Comic Book Roundup rating | align=\"center\" | Estimated sales (first month) | align=\"center\" | Estimated sales (second month) |- | #1 | \"Search...\"http://www.comics.org/issue/85985/ | June 1998 | N/A | 24,550, ranked 97th in North American | 23,451, ranked 85th in North American |- | #2 | \"...and Destroy!\"http://www.comics.org/issue/85986/ | July 1998 | N/A | 20,869, ranked 113th in North American | |- |} ==See also== * 1998 in comics ==References== ==External links== * Fury/Agent 13 at the Comic Book DB Category:Nick Fury titles Category:Marvel Comics one-shots ",
