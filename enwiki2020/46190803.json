Bethany is the granddaughter of Lebanese attorney, author and poet (1904-2002) Kehdy Farhoud Kehdy who was appointed Officer of the National Order of the Cedar in 1995. Bethany grew up in the Achrafieh district of Beirut, Lebanon and during the more turbulent Lebanese Civil War years, moved with her family to their village of Baskinta, where her father set up a dairy farm. Her parents divorced when she was very young and Bethany lived with her father and his family in Lebanon. Bethany recounts watching her grandmother, aunties and father in the traditional food preparation and preservation as a child and being immersed in the culinary heritage. She began experimenting on her own in the kitchen at 14 years old. ==Career== In 2001, Bethany competed in the Miss Lebanon pageant in an effort to win the monetary prize and secure funds to continue her studies at American University of Beirut. She came in as 1st runner up. Due to political instability, the pageant was not hosted in 2002 and Bethany became queen by default and was asked to represent Lebanon in the Miss World 2002 pageants. In 2003, Bethany moved to Miami, Florida where she worked in real estate and mortgages. Disgruntled with the ethics in the business, Bethany took a holiday to Maui Hawaii to visit her sisters.

A year later she moved to London, England in 2008 with her British husband where she discovered online publishing and began penning her blog.
