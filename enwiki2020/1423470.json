It lies in the traditional Slovenian province of Carinthia,\u010crna na Koro\u0161kem municipal site close to the border with Austria. Since 2005 it has been part of the larger Carinthia Statistical Region. ==Name== The settlement was first attested in written sources in 1309 under the German name Swarzenpach (and as Swartzenpach in 1318 and Swarczenpach in 1470)\u2014all literally 'black creek'. The Slovene name \u010crna (literally, 'black') arose through ellipsis from *\u010crna (voda/reka) 'Black Creek'. The designation \"black\" may have referred to water with dark silt, water that flowed through a spruce woods, or deep water with no visible bottom. The stream in question is known as Javorje Creek () today.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo\u0161ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo\u017eba ZRC, p. 101. The name of the settlement was changed from \u010crna to \u010crna na Koro\u0161kem in 1970.Spremembe naselij 1948\u201395. 1996. Database. Ljubljana: Geografski in\u0161titut ZRC SAZU, DZS. In the past the German name was Schwarzenbach. ==History== A chapel at \u010crna in the Duchy of Carinthia was first mentioned in an 1137 deed. The settlement has a long ironworking history. A foundry was established by one Mehior Puc, who moved to \u010crna from the Lavant Valley in 1620, started mining iron ore and built two smelting furnaces, which were among the first in the Eastern Alps. This operation was sold to the Counts of Thurn-Valsassina from nearby Bleiburg in 1624, who built a new ironworking operation on the Me\u017ea River at Mu\u0161enik to the north of the town in the 18th century. After the Austrian Southern Railway company had built a railway connection to Klagenfurt and Villach at Ravne na Koro\u0161kem a few miles down the Me\u017ea River, the Counts of Thurn moved operations there and abandoned their ironworks in \u010crna around 1880. The parish church in the town is dedicated to Saint Oswald. It is a Neo-Romanesque building that was erected in 1868 after the old church burned down in a fire.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number 2934 ==Notable people== Notable people that were born or lived in \u010crna na Koro\u0161kem include: *Ale\u0161 Gorza (born 1980), skier *Mitja Kunc (born 1971), skier *Nata\u0161a La\u010den (born 1971), skier *Tina Maze (born 1983), skier *Irma Pavlini\u010d-Krebs (born 1963), politician *Miro Petek (born 1959), journalist and politician *Danilo Pudgar (born 1952), skier *Drago Pudgar (born 1949), skier *Katju\u0161a Pu\u0161nik (born 1969), skier ==References== ==External links== *\u010crna na Koro\u0161kem on Geopedia *Official website *\u010crna na Koro\u0161kem - Info page, unofficial info page Category:Populated places in the Municipality of \u010crna na Koro\u0161kem ",
