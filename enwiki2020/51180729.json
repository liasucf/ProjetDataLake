The remaining 32 places went to players from three qualifying events - 20 from the UK Qualifier (held in Barnsley on 5 August), eight from the European Qualifier and four from the Host Nation Qualifier (both held on 15 September). Daryl Gurney who had to withdraw from the last two European Tour events due to a broken finger on his throwing hand, also pulled out of this event after failing to recover. Third seed Dave Chisnall also withdrew due to an neck injury, moving seeds 4-16 up a place, and promoting UK Qualifier Steve Beaton to 16th seed. Arron Monk also withdrew due to personal reasons the day the tournament began, thus giving Robbie Green a bye to the second round. The remaining places were filled with two additional Host Nation Qualifiers.
