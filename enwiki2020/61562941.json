In 1955, he was transferred to serve in the Sarawak administrative service where he had his first encounter with law and legal work. On 1 June 1965, Jemuri became a stipendiary magistrate. He was then appointed assistant Attorney-General of Sarawak on 8 November 1966. In 1973, Jemuri was promoted as Attorney-General (A-G) and held that office until his retirement in 1984. It was during his period in office that the infamous 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis took place which resulted in the removal of Stephen Kalong Ningkan as Chief Minister of Sarawak. However, he was later re- engaged on a contract basis and continued serving as A-G until 31 December 1989, following which he was appointed a judge of the Supreme Court of Malaysia. Finally, Jemuri was appointed the Chief Justice of Borneo on 11 March 1991, an office which he held until shortly after it was renamed the Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak before his retirement on 9 September 1994. == Honours == * : ** 50px Companion of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (JMN) (1975) ** 50px Commander of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (PMN) - Tan Sri (1992) * : ** 50px Grand Commander of the Order of Kinabalu (SPDK) - Datuk Seri Panglima (1994) * : ** 50px Distinguished Service Medal-Gold (PPC) ** 50px Companion of the Order of the Star of Sarawak (JBS) ** 50px Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of Sarawak (PNBS) - Dato Sri ** 50px Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak (DA) - Datuk Amar (1992) == See also == * 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis == References == Category:1929 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sarawak Category:People from Kuching Category:21st-century Malaysian people Category:20th-century Malaysian people Category:Malaysian people of Malay descent Category:Malaysian Muslims Category:Malaysian judges Category:Commanders of the Order of the Defender of the Realm Category:Companions of the Order of the Defender of the Realm Category:Knights Commander of the Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak Category:Grand Commanders of the Order of Kinabalu Category:Knights Commander of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of Sarawak ",
