This glacier was named by Robert Peary after Chief Engineer George W. Melville (1841 \u2013 1912), Chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering.Robert Neff Keely, Gwilym George Davis, In Arctic Seas: the Voyage of the Kite with the Peary Expedition, 2011 p. 373 ==Geography== The Melville Glacier discharges from the Greenland Ice Sheet and has its terminus in the northern side of the head of the Inglefield Fjord just north of Josephine Peary Island. Its last stretch lies between two nunataks: Mount Lee in the east separates it from the Farquhar Glacier to the east, and Mount Asserson, in the west, separates it from the Sharp Glacier to the west. The Melville Glacier flows roughly from NE to SW. In the same manner as its neighboring glaciers, it has retreated by approximately in the period between the 1980s and 2014.Ice front and flow speed variations of marine-terminating outlet glaciers along the coast of Prudhoe Land, northwestern Greenland {| |- valign=\"top\" |Map of Northwestern Greenland |19th century map of the Inglefield Gulf. |} ==See also== *List of glaciers in Greenland *Inglefield Fjord ==References== ==External links== *Identifying Spatial Variability in Greenland's Outlet Glacier Response to Ocean Heat *The recent regimen of the ice cap margin in North Greenland Category:Glaciers of Greenland ",
