Regardless of which unit one is a member of, one must pass the Keahlian (Tenderfoot) test before being eligible for any other badges. This test examines one on one's qualifications to become a Scout, testing one on the Scout uniform, Scout emblems, Scout oath, Scout laws, Scout salute and sign, the history of Scouting, and basic knot-tying, such as tying a reef knot. For Pengakap Kanak-Kanak (Cub Scouts), one may receive the Keris Gangsa (Bronze Dagger) badge, Keris Perak (Silver Dagger) badge and Keris Emas (Gold Dagger) badge. The dagger or Keris is a Malay dagger used as an official weapon by the royalty. One must attain all preceding badges before qualifying for the next one. Besides that, one may also receive various merit badges throughout the course of receiving the three Keris badges. Someone who has achieved the Keris Emas badge with certain merit badges is entitled to wear the Rambu Pengakap Kanak-Kanak (Cub Scout Cord), which is blue in colour. For Pengakap Muda (Junior Scout), one may receive the Usaha (Third Class) badge, Maju (Second Class) badge and Jaya (First Class) badge. One must attain all preceding badges before qualifying for the next one. Same as the previous stage, one can also receive a total of eight merit badges; two for hobbies, three for knowledge, and another three for service. Someone who achieves the First Class badge with the eight other merit badges is entitled to wear the Rambu Pengakap Muda (Junior Scout Cord), which is green in colour. For Pengakap Remaja (Senior Scout), one earns Jaya Diri (Independence) badge, Kemahiran (Skills) badge, Kegiatan (Activities) badge, Ekspedisi (Expedition) badge and Perkhidmatan (Service) badge. These badges are known as the Five Highest Badges (Lima Lencana Tertinggi), and a pre-requisite before being assessed as a Pengakap Raja (King's Scout). ==King's Scout Award== See also: King's Scout (Scouts Association of Malaysia) The qualified candidate will hand in his/her application form to the district commissioner together with his/her logbooks and certs (of all badges received). He/she will be evaluated and assessed during Kem Ujian Pra-Penarafan Pengakap Raja (Pre-King's Scout Assessment Camp), which has these components: Tanggungjawab (Responsibility), Pengembaraan (Expedition), Perkhidmatan Masyarakat (Community Service), Kegiatan (Activity), and Berdikari (Independence). Once a candidate completes and passes the Kem Ujian Pra-Penarafan Pengakap Raja, he/she is recognised and allowed to wear a royal yellow \"Rambu Pengakap Remaja\" or Senior Scout's Cord, and therefore has all the requirements ready for King's Scout certification. King's Scout badge The candidate then progresses to attend the Kem Penarafan Pengakap Raja (King's Scout Assessment Camp), a three-day two-nights organised by his/her respective Lembaga Penaraf Pengakap Raja Negeri (State King's Scout Assessment Council). Such an assessment follows the national scheme and involves camping, campcraft, pioneering, first aid, estimation, knots and lashing, map reading, foot and stave drills, backwoods' man cooking, songs, personal and group interviews, handicraft making and more. Upon passing all the required tests, the candidate is accorded and allowed to wear a royal yellow coloured Bushman's Thong, which is self-made. After all documentation has been completely vetted at headquarters, the candidate will have earned the yellow, blue and green \"Lencana Pengakap Raja\" (King's Scout Badge) which is worn on their left sleeve. They will also be invited to the Royal Palace of their respective state and bestowed the prestigious Sijil Pengakap Raja (King's Scout Certificate), by the Royal Ruler of that state, representing His Majesty Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia, the Patron of the PPM. The certificate is unique as it bears 10 signatures, lead foremost by the current Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia and the 9 State Rulers. There are, thus far, no other certificates in such a similar manner. If in a non-Royal state, His Majesty's signature is present first and foremost. Junior Scouts who receive the King's Scout Certificate and Badge while in their age level are required to have the Pre-King's Scout Assessment Camp and the state Lembaga Penaraf Pengakap Raja Negeri if so needed should all the requirements be accomplished. ==Troop organization== A troop is divided into several patrols, each with its own patrol leader and assistant patrol leader. A committee called the Patrol Leaders' Council plans all the troop's activities, with guidance from the troop's Scoutmaster(s). The Patrol Leaders' Council consists of all the patrol leaders and their assistants. From the Patrol Leaders' Council, Patrol Leaders are elected to become the Troop Leader, Assistant Troop Leader, Troop Secretary, Troop Treasurer and Troop Quartermaster. This committee is called the Court of Honour (COH) and is the most exclusive committee in a troop. The posts mentioned are the least a troop can have. Besides the above-mentioned posts, other posts such as Discipline Officer, Den warden, Librarian, IT Director, Historian and much more can be added if the need should arise. A patrol itself, besides its patrol leader and assistant patrol leader, has a secretary for taking down the details of a patrol meeting, has a treasurer for recording the financial matters and has a quartermaster for taking care of the patrol's equipment. During camp, the quartermaster becomes the equipment quartermaster, and a food quartermaster is appointed. The secretary becomes assistant patrol leader if the patrol leader or assistant patrol leader does not show up for a meeting. ==Malaysian Scout Jamborees== The Malaysian Scout Jamboree is the national jamboree and held since 1966. Each state takes turns to host this event.
