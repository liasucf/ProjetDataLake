Knud Rasmussen described the fjord entrance in the following terms: ==Geography== Petermann Fjord stretches roughly from southeast to northwest for about 110 km. Its mouth opens in the Kennedy Channel and Hall Basin area, between Cape Lucie Marie, located east of Cape Morton, and Cape Tyson in the north, near Offley Island.
