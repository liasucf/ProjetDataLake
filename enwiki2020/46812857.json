It was originally released for the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Indie Games service in 2011 and was later ported as a budget title for the PC Windows (Steam and Desura), Windows Phone 7 and iPhone / iPad platforms. ==Plot== The game's protagonist Akane is a kunoichi who secretly loves her feudal master Goro. When he is kidnapped, Akane goes off to rescue him from the evil Hiromi and her minions. ==Reception== Akane the Kunoichi was met with mostly favourable critical reception, including being a finalist at Dream Build Play 2012 in the Windows Phone category. Game Informer described the Xbox 360 version as a \"fine\" example of an \"old-school platformer\" for \"one measly dollar\". Daniel Douvris of AppAdvice commented on the iOS version of the game: \"Akane the Kunoichi is a fun action platformer. Its platforming elements, as well as its artwork, are reminiscent of retro games of the past. Put simply, it is a breath of fresh air from the endless piles of junk that line the App Store these days.\" ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Akane the Kunoichi at MobyGames *Akane the Kunoichi at Hardcore Gaming 101 Category:2011 video games Category:Fantasy video games Category:IOS games Category:Indie video games Category:Video games about ninja Category:Side-scrolling platform games Category:Single-player video games Category:Steam Greenlight games Category:Video games developed in Italy Category:Video games featuring female antagonists Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Video games set in feudal Japan Category:Windows games Category:Windows Phone games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Xbox 360 Live Indie games Category:Platform games Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture ",
