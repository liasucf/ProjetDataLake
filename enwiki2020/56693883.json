In the final showdown to become world champions lifelong hopes, dreams and even lives, are at stake. ==Cast== ==Soundtrack== The original soundtrack was produced by Frank Fitzpatrick and released on Hip Hop Connect, an independent label and production company specializing in socially conscious rap, hip hop and film soundtracks. * KRS-One * K'Naan * Ziggy Marley * Nneka * Les Nubians * MV Bill * Talib Kweli * Sway * Lina A portion of the proceeds were donated to the Debbie Allen Dance Academy through EarthTones. ==Reception== Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes shows five critic reviews with a tomatometer rating of 0% rotten with an average critic score of 3.4/10. Paula Citron of The Globe and Mail found the film to be predictable and the dance sequences to be over- edited, commenting: \"... if the audience is not there for the story - which is clearly just a hat to hang the dance on - they must be there for the dance. Unfortunately, because Adetuyi's film is actually one very long music video, the dance portions are shot in 30-second bites, so one never gets a sense of an entire routine. All we get is fast-cut teasers.\" In his review for NOW Toronto, Norman Wilner criticised the acting skills of the accomplished dancers and found the plot to be hackneyed, concluding:\" ... It's all just atrociously acted filler between the dance sequences, which Adetuyi shoots so haphazardly that it's impossible to appreciate the artists or choreography.\" Bruce DeMara, reviewing for the Toronto Star found the plot, dialogue and theme of beating the world to be clich\u00e9d. He praised the dance performances but criticised their editing. He concluded: \" ... there are a couple of decent performances that shine through, notably Brown as Yuson and Ray Johnson as his friend, Easy, both of whom have solid onscreen presence but need a better film to demonstrate it in. Adetuyi has the makings of a decent filmmaker. He just needs to stick to the basics: believable dialogue and characters and a storyline that takes a few chances.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2011 films Category:Canadian films Category:English-language films Category:American dance films Category:American films Category:Canadian musical drama films Category:Hip hop dance Category:2010s hip hop films Category:2010s musical drama films Category:American musical drama films Category:Films directed by Robert Adetuyi Category:Films scored by Andrew Lockington Category:2011 drama films Category:Sony Pictures direct-to-video films ",
