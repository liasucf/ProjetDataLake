Lewis is a transgender rights activist, educator, and musician. ==Activism== In 1998, Jamison Green referred to Lewis as a \"rising star\" among trans men activists, placing him at the vanguard of visibility and political action for trans men. Lewis' work only grew in prominence, impact, and nuance since Green's statement. As an activist for transgender healthcare, Lewis served on the National Advisory Board for the Center of Excellence for Transgender Health. In 2013, Lewis was an honoree of the inaugural Trans 100 List for his health education work. Lewis has served on the boards of the Woodhull Freedom Foundation, Unid@s, and the National LGBTQ Task Force. Lewis has described himself as a \"shit-stirrer\" who interrupts complacency. ==Art== Lewis is a founding member of \"The TransAms,\" an all-transgender barbershop quartet. He has been featured in documentaries including Trappings of transhood (1997), Transgender revolution (1998), The believers (2006), and Diagnosing difference (2009). He is also a poet. His poem \"I wish i looked like matthew shepard\" highlights the tragic ironies and racial and socioeconomic aspects of anti-LGBT hate crimes. Lewis sees his art and activism as interconnected, saying that \"there can be no art without activism and no activism without art.\" ==References== Category:Living people Category:Transgender and transsexual men Category:LGBT singers Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
