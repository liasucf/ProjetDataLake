In 1999, a jury in federal district court in Florida awarded $1.8 million compensatory damages and $31 million punitive damages against the company for asbestos products.

Owens Corning partnered with DuPont in 2011 to create a steel and foam energy reduction (SAFER) barrier around auto racetracks. In July 2015, the company announced it would be moving a manufacturing center for mineral wool insulation into an empty plant west of Joplin, Missouri. == Products == In 1939, the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships made Owens-Corning insulation standard in new warship construction. Warship insulation, called Navy Board, was a permanent form- board insulation covered with woven continuous fiber cloth. Owens-Corning produced a prototype boat hull constructed of fiber glass-reinforced plastic in 1944. In 1945, the company worked with an automaker to produce the first fiberglass-reinforced plastic car body. In 1953, General Motors used this type of body in the Chevrolet Corvette. In 1954, the company invented a process to make centrifugally-spun fiberglass wool, which became the standard process for producing fiberglass insulation. In 1955, Owens-Corning introduced its Perma- Ply roofing material for built-up room insulation covering. The company created its first all fiber (AF) fiberglass wool in 1956. To distinguish its product, the company dyed their insulation pink by adding red dye to the AF wool. However, considering that the coloring made the insulation look pink, the company was concerned that the color would discourage the predominate male-oriented market for the material. As such, they decided to withdraw the coloring from its insulation, only to receive customer requests for the coloring to be restored. The company resumed the coloring in the face of such customer interest to the point of licensing the United Artists cartoon character, the Pink Panther, in 1979 as its mascot for the product. Furthermore, the coloring became an official company trademark in court 1987, which became first time a color was used for that purpose. After the January 27, 1967, Apollo 1 fire which killed three astronauts, NASA worked with Owens- Corning and Du Pont to develop beta cloth, a fireproof cloth of woven fiberglass coated with Teflon, as a replacement for the nylon outer layer of the Apollo/Skylab A7L space suit.Space.com: Everyday Tech From Space: Fiberglass Fibers for Fabric RoofsExtreme Textiles: Designing for High PerformanceCrew Patch reference guide In February 2017, Owens Corning received the Asthma and Allergy Friendly certification for its Pure Safety\u2122 high- performance insulation. \u201cOwens Corning now joins a select group of manufacturers that are focused on product innovation to address people\u2019s exposure to allergens and irritants in their homes,\u201d said Julian Francis, president of insulation, Owens Corning.

The joint effort between Owens Corning and Ripple Glass is helping to greatly reduce the amount of glass that would have been deposited in local Kansas City landfills.Environmental Leader 2009 The Owens Corning Roofing and Asphalt Shingle Recycling Program was launched in 2009 to keep shingles out of landfills. In 2013, Constellation Energy built a 2.7-megawatt solar power system at an Owens Corning insulation plant in Delmar, New York. The power system, which is leased to Owens Corning, can produce 3.3 million kilowatt hours of electrical energy in a year.
