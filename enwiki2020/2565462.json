    "text": "Sophie Scholl \u2013 The Final Days () is a 2005 German historical drama film directed by Marc Rothemund and written by Fred Breinersdorfer. It is about the last days in the life of Sophie Scholl, a 21-year-old member of the anti-Nazi non-violent student resistance group the White Rose, part of the German Resistance movement. She was found guilty of high treason by the People\u2019s Court and executed the same day, 22 February 1943. The film was presented at the 55th Berlin International Film Festival in February 2005 and won Silver Bear awards for Best Director and Best Actress (Julia Jentsch). It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. ==Plot== In wartime Munich, Sophie Scholl joins members of the White Rose student organization, including Sophie's brother Hans, who are preparing copies of their sixth leaflet. They have mimeographed more than they can distribute through the mail. Hans proposes distributing the extras at university the next day; despite Willi arguing that the risks are unacceptable, Hans says that he will take full responsibility, and Sophie volunteers to assist. The next day, at the main building of Munich University where classes are in session, Hans and Sophie set about putting down stacks of leaflets near the doors of lecture rooms. With only minutes left until the period ends, Sophie runs to the top floor, where she impulsively pushes a stack of leaflets over the edge of the balustrade. A janitor who saw Sophie scatter the leaflets detains the pair until police arrive and arrest them. The siblings are taken to the Munich Stadelheim Prison, where Sophie is interrogated by Gestapo investigator Robert Mohr. Claiming initially to be apolitical, she presents an alibi: she and her brother had nothing to do with the fliers. She noticed them in the hall and pushed a stack off the railing because it is in her nature to play pranks, and she had an empty suitcase because she was going to visit her parents in Ulm and planned to bring back some clothes. She is dismissed, but as her release form is about to be approved, the order comes not to let her go. She is placed in a prison cell with fellow prisoner Else Gebel. The investigation has found incontrovertible evidence that Sophie and Hans were indeed responsible for the distribution of anti-Nazi leaflets. Sophie concedes her involvement, as has Hans. However, determined to protect the others, she steadfastly maintains that the production and distribution of thousands of copies of leaflets in cities throughout the region were entirely the work of both. Mohr admonishes her to support the laws that preserve order in a society that has funded her education. Scholl counters that before 1933 the laws preserved freedom of speech and describes atrocities committed by the Nazis that she has seen and has heard of. Sophie and her brother, as well as a married friend with three young children, Christoph Probst, are charged with treason, troop demoralization and abetting the enemy. In the subsequent show trial, Probst is the first to be examined by President of the People's Court Roland Freisler, whose prosecutorial zeal makes the nominal prosecutor superfluous. Freisler contemptuously dismisses Probst's appeals to spare his life so that his children can have a father. Hans maintains his composure in the face of Freisler's increasingly impatient questioning. Declining to answer only what he is asked, he argues that the defeat of the Nazi state has been made inevitable by the Allies; all Hitler can do is prolong the war. In her own examination, Sophie declares that many people agree with what she and her group have said and written, but they dare not express such thoughts. Freisler pronounces the three defendants guilty and calls on each to make a brief final statement. Sophie tells the court that \"where we stand today, you [Freisler] will stand soon.\" All are sentenced to death. Sophie, who had been told that everyone had 99 days after conviction before they were executed, learns that she is to be executed that day. After a visit by her parents, who express their approval of what she has done, Mohr comes to the prison and sadly watches Sophie taken away. Soon after, she is led into a cell where Christoph Probst and Hans await. Probst remarks that what they did was not in vain. As Sophie is led into a courtyard, she says, \"The sun is still shining\". She is brought to the execution chamber and placed in a guillotine. The blade falls and the picture goes black. Hans exclaims, \"Es lebe die Freiheit!\" (\"Long live Freedom!\") before the blade falls again. Probst is brought in next before the blade falls once more. In the closing shot, thousands of leaflets fall from the sky over Munich. A title explains that copies of the White Rose manifesto were smuggled to the Allies, who printed millions of copies of the \"Manifesto of the Students of Munich\" that were subsequently dropped on German cities. ==Cast== * Julia Jentsch as Sophia Magdalena 'Sophie' Scholl * Fabian Hinrichs as Hans Fritz Scholl * Alexander Held as Robert Mohr * Johanna Gastdorf as Else Gebel * Andr\u00e9 Hennicke as Dr. Roland Freisler * Florian Stetter as Christoph Hermann Probst * Maximilian Br\u00fcckner as Willi Graf * as Alexander Schmorell * Lilli Jung as Gisela Schertling * as Magdalena Scholl * J\u00f6rg Hube as Robert Scholl * Franz Staber as Werner Scholl ==Awards and recognition== * 55th Berlin International Film Festival, 2005 ** Nominated for Golden Bear ** Silver Bear: Best Director \u2013 Marc Rothemund ** Silver Bear: Best Actress \u2013 Julia Jentsch * European Film Awards, 2005 ** Best European Actress \u2013 Julia Jentsch ** Audience Award * Bernhard-Wicki-Filmpreis, 2005 * German Film Awards (Lolas) ** Audience Award ** Best Film, Silver Prize ** Best acting performance (female main role) \u2013 Julia Jentsch * 78th Academy Awards, 2006 ** Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film ==See also== * Die Wei\u00dfe Rose (film) (1982) * The Nasty Girl (1990) * Jud Newborn ==References== ==External links== * Sophie Scholl \u2013 The Final Days film website (in English) * Sophie Scholl \u2013 Die letzten Tage film website (in German) * * * * * * Sophie Scholl - The Final Days at YouTube Category:2005 films Category:2005 biographical drama films Category:German biographical drama films Category:Films about capital punishment Category:Films about the German Resistance Category:Films about Nazi Germany Category:Films set in 1943 Category:Films set in Germany Category:Films set in Munich Category:German films Category:German-language films Category:White Rose Category:World War II films based on actual events Category:European Film Awards winners (films) Category:Films scored by Reinhold Heil Category:Films scored by Johnny Klimek Category:Cultural depictions of Hans and Sophie Scholl Category:2005 drama films ",
