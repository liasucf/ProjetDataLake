    "text": "Frank Haydock (born 29 November 1940) is an English former footballer who played at centre-half for several clubs, including Manchester United, Charlton Athletic and Portsmouth. His brother, Billy, was also a professional footballer who played for Manchester City, Crewe Alexandra and Stockport County. ==Career== Born in Eccles, Lancashire, Haydock began his football career as an amateur with Blackpool in 1956. A year later, he signed amateur forms with Manchester United, before turning professional in December 1959. He made his Manchester United debut on 20 August 1960, playing at centre half in a 3\u20131 home defeat to Blackburn Rovers. He also played in the same position in the next three matches, before the number 5 jersey was usurped, first by Ronnie Cope and then Bill Foulkes, a convert from right-back. It was more than a year before Haydock returned to the United first team, filling in for Foulkes for a home game against Birmingham City on 14 October 1961. He only made one more appearances for the first team after that, a 3\u20132 away defeat to Nottingham Forest on the final day of the 1962\u201363 Football League season. Haydock was sold to Charlton Athletic for \u00a310,000 in August 1963. He played for Charlton for two-and-a-half years, making 84 appearances and scoring four goals before a transfer to Portsmouth in December 1965. In a Portsmouth career spanning just over three years, Haydock made 72 appearances and scored one goal. He was then transferred to Southend United in February 1969, spending a year there before moving to Fleetwood. ==External links== *Profile at Neil Brown's Post-War Football League Players Database *Profile at StretfordEnd.co.uk *Profile at MUFCInfo.com Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:People from Eccles, Greater Manchester Category:English footballers Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Fleetwood Town F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Charlton Athletic F.C. players Category:Portsmouth F.C. players Category:Southend United F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football defenders ",
