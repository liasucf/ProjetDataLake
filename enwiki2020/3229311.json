    "text": "The Red Line () is one of the two lines of Dublin's Luas light rail system. The Red Line runs in an east-west direction through the city centre, north of the River Liffey, before travelling southwest to Tallaght, with a fork to Citywest and Saggart. The Red Line opened on 26 September 2004. ==History== Construction work began in March 2001 on the Tallaght to Connolly line, as well as the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green section of the second line, with Ansaldo of Italy and MVM of Australia getting the contract to build the system. The St. Stephen's Green to Dublin Airport section was dropped before construction began, as it was decided to serve the area by a metro instead. The contract to maintain operate the system was awarded to Transdev Ireland (formerly known as Connex). The extension from Connolly to The Point opened in 2009, with the extension from Belgard to Saggart opening in 2011. Interchange with the Green Line began in December 2017 with its extension crossing the Red Line either side of the Abbey Street stop. ==Rolling Stock== The Luas Red Line is operated using Citadis trams. ==Depot== The tram depot for the Red Line is located at Red Cow where the main control room for the entire Luas system is also located. ==Route== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left\" |- ! style=\"color: white; background-color: red;\"| Image !style=\"color: white; background-color: red;\"|Name Name in Irish ! style=\"color: white; background-color: red;\"|Branch ! style=\"color: white; background-color: red;\"|Zone ! style=\"color: white; background-color: red;\"|Location ! width=23% style=\"color: white; background- color: red;\" |Transport interchange ! style=\"color: white; background-color: red;\"|Serves |- |200px |The Point Iosta na Rinne |Docklands (Terminus) |Red 1 | Mayor Street Upper | Dublin Port Dublin Bus routes dublinbikes | 3Arena |- |200px |Spencer Dock Duga Spencer |Docklands |Red 1 | Mayor Street Upper | Docklands Dublin Bus routes dublinbikes | Convention Centre Dublin |- | 200px |Mayor Square \u2014 NCI Cearn\u00f3g an Mh\u00e9ara \u2014 CN\u00c9 |Docklands |Red 1 | Mayor Street Lower | Dublin Bus routes dublinbikes | National College of Ireland |- | 200px |George's Dock Duga Sheoirse |Docklands |Red 1 / Central | George's Dock | Dublin Bus routes dublinbikes | Jeanie Johnston |- |200px |Connolly Conghaile |Connolly (Terminus) |Red 1 / Central | Amiens Street | Dublin Connolly Dublin Bus routes dublinbikes | National College of Ireland |- |200px |Bus\u00e1ras | Main line |Red 1 / Central | Store Street | Dublin Bus routes Bus \u00c9ireann routes dublinbikes | Bus\u00e1ras The Custom House International Financial Services Centre |- |200px |Abbey Street Sr\u00e1id na Mainistreach | Main line |Central | Lower Abbey Street | Luas Green Line Marlborough southbound (walk 100 m / 110 yds) Luas Green Line O'Connell -
