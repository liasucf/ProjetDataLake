    "text": "Jonathan King (born Kenneth George King, 6 December 1944) is an English singer-songwriter, record producer, music entrepreneur, and former television and radio presenter. King first came to prominence in 1965 when \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\", a song that he wrote and sang while still an undergraduate, achieved chart success. The Guardian reported in 2002 that he had sold over 40 million records in his career. As an independent producer, he discovered and named Genesis in 1967, producing their first album From Genesis to Revelation. He founded his own label, UK Records in 1972. He released and produced songs for 10cc and the Bay City Rollers. In the 1970s King became known for hits that he performed and/or produced under different names, including \"Johnny Reggae\", \"Loop di Love\", \"Sugar, Sugar\", \"It Only Takes a Minute\", \"Hooked on a Feeling\" and \"Una Paloma Blanca\"; between September 1971 and 1972 alone he produced 10 top 30 singles in the UK.\"King Forms U.K. Records,\" Billboard, 9 September 1972, 32. Rod Liddle described him as someone who could \"storm the pop charts at will, under a hundred different disguises\".Liddle, Rod (11 April 2010). \"McLaren was no cultural genius just a lucky punk\", The Sunday Times. London. While living in New York in the 1980s, King appeared on radio and television in the UK, including on the BBC's Top of the Pops and Entertainment USA. In the early 1990s he produced the Brit Awards, and from 1995 he selected and produced the British entries for the Eurovision Song Contest, including the winning entry in 1997, \"Love Shine a Light\" by Katrina and the Waves. In September 2001, King was convicted of child sexual abuse and sentenced to seven years in prison, for having sexually assaulted five boys, aged 14 and 15, in the 1980s. In November 2001 he was acquitted of 22 similar charges. He was released on parole in March 2005.\"Jonathan King freed from prison\", BBC News, 29 March 2005. A further trial for sexual offences against teenage boys resulted in several not guilty verdicts and the trial being abandoned in June 2018. ==Early life== ===Family background=== Ewhurst King was born in a nursing home in Bentinck Street, Marylebone, London, the first child of Jimmy King (d. 1954) and his wife, Ailsa Linley Leon (1916\u20132007), a former actress.\"Ailsa Linley\", www.kingofhits.co.uk; King, Jonathan (2009). 65 My Life So Far, London: Revvolution Publishing Ltd., chs. 1, 25. Originally from New Jersey, Jimmy King had moved to England when he was 14. He attended Oundle School and Trinity College, Cambridge, before joining the American Field Service during World War II and later Tootal Ties and Shirts as managing director. King's birth was a forceps delivery and a muscle on his upper lip was affected during it, giving him his slightly crooked smile.King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 1. After he was born, the family lived in Gloucester Place, Marylebone, then moved to Surrey, where King and his younger brothers, James and Anthony (\"Andy\"), were raised in Brookhurst Grange, a mansion near Ewhurst. ===Stoke House and Charterhouse=== King was sent to boarding school, first as a weekly boarder to pre-prep school in Hindhead, Surrey, then, when he was eight, to Stoke House Preparatory School in Seaford, East Sussex.King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 2. A year later, in 1954, after his father died from a heart attack, Brookhurst Grange was sold and the family moved to Cobbetts, a cottage in nearby Forest Green.King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 3. Music became his passion around this time. King would save his pocket money for train trips to London to watch My Fair Lady, The King and I, Irma la Douce, Salad Days, Damn Yankees and Kismet from the cheap seats in the balcony. He also discovered pop music and bought his first single, Guy Mitchell's \"Singing the Blues\" (1956).King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 4. In 1958 King became a boarder at Charterhouse in Godalming, Surrey. He wrote that he \"loved Charterhouse immediately\", with its history and \"every possible area of encouragement from sport to intellectual pursuits.\" Unlike at Stoke House, there were other boys there who appreciated pop music. He bought a transistor radio and earphones and joined the \"under the bedclothes\" club, listening to Tony Hall, Jimmy Savile, Don Moss and Pete Murray on Radio Luxembourg, and keeping track of the New Musical Express charts. The music, particularly Buddy Holly, Adam Faith, Roy Orbison and Gene Pitney, made him \"ache with desire\": > Since \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" swept me off my feet, I had become a > raving pop addict, desperate for a fix every few seconds. I kept thick > notebooks packed with copies of the weekly charts, adverts for new products, > pages of predictions of future hits, reviews and comments about current > artistes. Looking at them now, there was no way I could ever have avoided a > future in the music industry. ===Gap year=== King left Charterhouse in 1962 to attend Davies's, a London crammer, for his A levels. With his wages from a job stacking shelves in a supermarket, he made a demo of himself the following year singing \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" and \"Fool's Paradise\" Eden Kane song with the Ted Taylor Trio, a professional group in Rickmansworth. Wearing a pinstripe suit and trainers, he approached John Schroeder of Oriole Records and told him he could make a hit record. \"I have been studying the music industry for the last three years and it is one big joke,\" Schroeder reported him as saying. \"Anyone can make it if they're clever and can fool a few people.\" After hearing King's demo, Schroeder booked a studio session with an orchestra but suspected that King could not sing in tune.Schroeder, John (2016). All for the Love of Music, Matador, 66\u201368. King also joined a local band in Cranleigh, the Bumblies, as manager/producer and occasional singer, sometimes wearing thigh-length boots and long black gloves, during the band's appearances at birthday parties and similar.King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 6. Despite the cramming, King failed the scholarship exam for Trinity College, Cambridge, but he was offered a place in 1963 after an interview. He accepted, but first took a gap year and spent six months travelling with a round-the-world ticket from his mother. Staying mostly in youth hostels, he visited Greece, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and the United States, including Hawaii, where, in June 1964, he met the manager of the Beatles, Brian Epstein. They spent hours together in Honolulu discussing the music industry, King wrote.King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 7. In October that year King began to study for his degree in English literature at Cambridge, lodging in Jesus Lane. ==Career== ===Early success=== In London, 1969 (photograph by Allan Warren) Around the time King began at Cambridge, the Bumblies (featuring Terry Ward) recorded a song he had written and produced, \"Gotta Tell\", which King persuaded Fontana Records to release. It appeared in April 1965 and \"rightly sank without trace\", King writes, but the experience of taking it from label to label, and then trying to find people to play it, taught him how to promote a record. He called DJs and television producers to ask them to listen to it and, because it was Easter, delivered hundreds of vinyl singles to music critics complete with Easter eggs he had painted himself. King and the Bumblies recorded another of his songs, \"All You've Gotta Do\", with producer Joe Meek, but nothing came of it.\"The Joe Meek Story\", 8 February 1991, 00:08:02. Keen to break into the music business, King contacted Tony Hall of Decca Records, who put him in touch with the Zombies' producers Ken Jones and Joe Roncoroni. King played them one of his songs, \"Green is the Grass\", and they asked him to write a B side. He offered them six songs, including \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\", which became the A side. They also suggested he change his name.King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 8. Decca released \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\" in August 1965. Relying on the contacts he had made while promoting \"Gotta Tell\", King plugged it relentlessly to radio stations to get it on their playlists. DJ Tony Windsor of Radio London, a pirate station broadcast from the MV Galaxy, was the first to play it, not only once, but three times in a row. (Windsor later said he did this only because of a problem with his other turntable.) It sold 26,000 copies the next day.King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 9. When the song made number 18 in the charts, King was invited onto the BBC's Top of the Pops, introduced by Jimmy Savile. The following day it sold 35,000 copies.King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 9; \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\", Top of the Pops, BBC, 1965. It peaked at number four in the UK (the Beatles were at number one with \"Help!\") and 17 in the US, and was awarded a gold disc.Lazell, Barry (1989). Rock movers & shakers, Billboard Publications, 279.For number three, Melody Maker, 21 August 1965, cited in King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 9.Warwick, Neil; Kutner, Jon; and Brown, Tony (2004).

Nina Simone, Bette Midler, and Marlene Dietrich all covered it. Dietrich sang \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\" and its B side, \"Summer's Coming\", at the Golders Green Hippodrome in October 1966, with an arrangement by Burt Bacharach.\"Marlene Dietrich sings \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\" (Live, 1966)\", YouTube. The single reached No. 17 in the US Billboard Hot 100 and was one of the songs carried on the Apollo 11 moon mission. In 2019, the track was included in the soundtrack of the Hollywood film In The Shadow of the Moon over the closing credits.In the Shadow of the Moon Soundtrack From his second year at university, King split his time between Cambridge and London, moving into a three-bedroom apartment, owned by his mother, at 20 St Andrews Mansions, Dorset Street, Marylebone, driving there from classes in his white MGB GT.King, 65 My Life So Far, chs. 2, 9. His next release, \"Green is the Grass\", flopped, but the third (which he wrote and produced, but did not perform), \"It's Good News Week\" by Hedgehoppers Anonymous, was a hit. It was released in September 1965 through Decca and credited to King and his new publishing company, JonJo Music Co. Ltd, which was named after King, Ken Jones and Joe Roncoroni and based in Jones' and Roncoroni's office at 37 Soho Square.:File:Its Good News Week.jpg, image courtesy of Wikipedia\"JonJo Music Ltd\", Discogs. Retrieved 31 July 2016King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 11. Briefly banned by the BBC because of its lyrics about birth control, the song made the top five in the UK and top 50 in America. Also in 1965, King began contributing a column to Disc and Music Echo, a weekly magazine edited by Ray Coleman. King adopted a deliberately provocative style, promoting new acts but also publishing criticism of the music industry and particular artists.King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 10. Michael Wale described him as \"the butterfly who stamped its foot\".Vale, Michael (1972). VoxPop, Larousse Harrap Publishers, 78. ===Discovery of Genesis=== In early 1967, King attended an old boys' reunion at Charterhouse. He said he went there to show off, \"oust[ing] Baden Powell as their most famous Old Boy.\"Thompson, Dave (2004). Turn It On Again, Hal Leonard Corporation, 11. When they heard he was going to be there, a school band recorded a demo tape for him, and a friend, John Alexander, left the cassette in King's car with a note, \"These are Charterhouse boys. Have a listen\".Rutherford, Mike (2014). The Living Years, Constable, 45. Calling themselves Anon, the band consisted at that point of Peter Gabriel, Tony Banks, Anthony Phillips, Chris Stewart and Mike Rutherford, then all aged 15 to 17.Welch, Chris (1995). The Complete Guide to the Music of Genesis. Omnibus Press, 1\u20133. King liked several songs such as \"She is Beautiful\" (which became \"The Serpent\" on the band's first album) and, according to Philips, they got the deal with King on the basis of that song. King signed the band to JonJo Music and licensed the short-term rights to Decca Records. He paid them \u00a340 for four songs, and came up with their name, Genesis, to mark the start of his own career as a record producer.Banks, Tony, et al. (2007). \"Charterhouse (1963\u20131968),\" in Philip Dodd (ed.), Genesis: Chapter and Verse, St. Martin's Griffin, 27\u201328. According to Phillips, King was \"hugely patient and indulgent\" with the band. John Silver, drummer on the first album, wrote in 2007: > We would be pretending to rehearse or simply waiting around and somehow > somebody would bring a message to the flat, \"Quick, get over to Jonathan > King's flat, because Paul McCartney's turning up.\" We would scurry over as > quickly as possible because the art was to be there, looking casual, before > the next famous person arrived, so that Jonathan King could say, \"Hey, these > are my new prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\" I trusted him as a god, because he knew these people. > It wasn't celebrity like it is now. There were only a few famous people and > he knew them. If Jonathan said jump or stand backwards or stand on your > head, basically you did it. This was the nature of the relationship; he was > completely omnipotent, in a decent way.Banks, et al. (2007), \"Christmas > Cottage (1968\u20131970)\", 57. King produced their first three singles, including \"The Silent Sun\" (1968) and an album, From Genesis to Revelation (1969). Banks and Gabriel wrote \"The Silent Sun\" as a late-1960s Bee Gees \"pastiche\" to please King; Robin Gibb's voice was apparently King's favourite at the time.Banks 2007, 29. The records made little impact; the album sold just 649 copies \"and we knew all of those people personally,\" wrote Banks. King slowly lost interest in the band. Their next demo was even less \"poppy\"; the more complicated the songs, the less King liked them.Banks 2007, 52. Genesis left King in 1970 for Tony Stratton-Smith's Charisma Records, were joined by Phil Collins and Steve Hackett\u2014and, after another two unsuccessful albums, released Foxtrot (1972) to critical acclaim.White, Timothy (1986). \"Gabriel,\" Spin magazine (50\u201363),54. King retained the rights to the first album and re-released it several times under different titles. Rutherford said in 1985 that, \"for all his faults\", King had given the band an opportunity to record, which at that time was hard to come by. ===Broadcasting, Decca Records=== When King graduated from Cambridge in June 1967, the press covered his graduation ceremony: \"Jonathan King becomes M.A. (Cantab.)\".\"Jonathan King becomes M.A. (Cantab.)\", Londoner's Diary, London Evening Standard, 23 June 1967. Shortly afterwards Tony Firth, an ATV producer and Trinity graduate, asked King to present Good Evening, a weekly television show that ran nationally on ATV at 6:30 pm on Saturdays from October 1967 to 1968.Billboard, 14 October 1967, 64; for ATV, London Magazine, 7, 1967, 59.For 1968, Wale, Michael (1972). Voxpop: Profiles of the Pop Process, Larousse Harrap Publishers, 85. The following year he began broadcasting for BBC Radio 1, including a \"blast off\" slot on the Stuart Henry show.King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 12. Tired of living in the Dorset Street apartment, King bought a three-storey mews house near Porchester Terrace, Bayswater, in which he still lived as of 2019, for \u00a318,650.King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 11; King, Jonathan (2014). 70 FFFY, London: Revvolution Publishing Ltd, 158. Around this time, he was recruited by Sir Edward Lewis, the founder of Decca Records and another Trinity graduate, to be his unpaid (expenses only) personal assistant. King writes that Lewis recruited him twice for this position, once not long after graduation and again in the late 1970s. ===Early 1970s=== \"It's Good News Week\" (1965) was the last big hit King had for four years. Then his cover of \"Let It All Hang Out\" (1969) made the top 30 in January 1970, and he went on to become the top singles producer of 1971 and 1972,\"UK Producer King Launches Own Label\", Billboard, 27 May 1972, 51. beginning with \"It's the Same Old Song\". Released by B&C; Records in December 1970 under a pseudonym, the Weathermen, it moved into the charts a month later. Using pseudonyms meant more airtime: radio producers might play several songs by the same artist during a programme without realizing they had devoted so much airtime to one person. King's 1971 releases included a version of Bob Dylan's \"Baby, You've Been On My Mind\", released as Nemo, which failed to chart; The Sun Has Got His Hat On, also as Nemo; \"Sugar, Sugar\" as Sakkarin; \"Leap Up and Down (Wave Your Knickers in the Air)\" by St Cecelia (this one a real band, rather than a pseudonym), which went to number 12; and \"Lazy Bones\", \"Flirt\" and \"Hooked on a Feeling\" \u2013 all released under his own name. Bell Records asked King to produce four songs for the Bay City Rollers, including their first hit, \"Keep on Dancing\", on which King sang the 13 backing vocals himself. Released in May 1971, the single reached number nine. \"Hooked on a Feeling\", a country song that King had turned into a pop hit, adding \"ooga chaka ooga ooga\" to the intro, was a Top Thirty hit. King's arrangement later gave Swedish group Blue Swede a US number one in April 1974.Bronson, Fred (2003). The Billboard Book of Number One Hits, Billboard Books, 361. The arrangement featured in Reservoir Dogs (1992), at least one episode of Ally McBeal, where it provided the music for the Dancing Baby (1998), and Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), although King writes that he made no money from the Blue Swede version.King, '65 My Life So Far, ch. 12; King, FFFY, 13. Years later the track still garners coverage. Another top three 1971 hit was \"Johnny Reggae\", a ska pop song about a skinhead, written by King after he was introduced to a Johnny Reggae at the Walton Hop disco in Surrey. It was sung by King and middle-aged session singers pretending to be teenagers, credited to The Piglets and released by Bell.\"Record Details\", www.45cat.com. John Stratton writes that \"Johnny Reggae\" was the \"first British hit with a ska beat to have been written by a white Englishman ... and performed by white English singers and musicians.\"Stratton, John (2016). \"The Travels of Johnny Reggae: From Jonathan King to Prince Far IFrom Skinhead to Rasta,\" When Music Migrates: Crossing British and European Racial Faultlines, 1945\u20132010. Routledge (59\u201379), 59\u201360. While, according to Lloyd Bradley, the BBC was reluctant to play reggae by black Jamaican artists, \"Johnny Reggae\", which Bradley described as \"lamentable [and] audibly jarring\", reached number three in the UK in November 1971 (when Slade's \"Coz I Luv You\" was number one) and stayed in the top 50 for 12 weeks.Stratton 2016, 59\u201360; Bradley, Lloyd (2001). Bass Culture: When Reggae Was King. Penguin, 256 (also published as This is Reggae Music). It has been reported that, under various different names and in assorted formats, he sold around 40 million records. ===UK records=== 10cc in 1974. Clockwise from left: Eric Stewart, Kevin Godley, Graham Gouldman and Lol Creme In 1972 King set up a record label, UK Records, distributed by Decca and later Polygram in the UK and London Records in the US. Chris Denning left Bell to run the UK office and Fred Ruppert, formerly of Elektra Records, the US office. Don Wardell then took over the US office, Denning left and Wardell moved back to run the UK company. King's brother Andy was hired in 1974 as the promotion manager.\"International Turntable,\" Billboard, 22 June 1974, 52. Clive Selwood, who had helmed John Peel's label Dandelion, then took over as manager. The label's first hit was \"Seaside Shuffle\" by Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs, followed by King's \"Loop di Love\", which reached number four, released under the pseudonym Shag.\"Shag\", www.45cat.com.

Roy C, the First Class and Lobo. The label also released King's cover of \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" (1974) under the name Bubblerock, described as a \"Grateful Dead\"-style country version\", which met the approval of Mick Jagger.\"Jonathan King \u2013 Satisfaction\", YouTube. In June 1973, after seeing The Rocky Horror Show on its second night, King invested a 20% stake in it, making him one of its two original backers, along with Michael White, and produced and released The Rocky Horror Show Original London Cast.Thompson, Dave (2016). The Rocky Horror Picture Show FAQ, Hal Leonard Corporation. The label's most significant signing was 10cc. Eric Stewart, one of the band members, had known King since 1965, when Stewart was with The Mindbenders and King had wanted to manage them. The band had planned to release \"Donna\" as a B side, but decided it could be a hit: \"We only knew of one person who was mad enough to release it,\" Stewart said, \"and that was Jonathan King.\"Tremlett, George (1976). The 10cc Story Futura.Thompson, Dave (2012). The Cost of Living in Dreams: The 10cc Story, CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, p. 61\u201362. King gave the band its name and released two of the group's albums (10cc and Sheet Music) and eight singles. \"Donna\" (1972) and \"Rubber Bullets\" (1973), reached number two and one respectively, followed by \"The Dean and I\" (1973) and \"The Wall Street Shuffle\" (1974).Davis, Sharon (2012). Every Chart Topper Tells a Story: The Seventies, Random House. The band only dented the American market, with \"Rubber Bullets\" making 73 on the Billboard Hot 100. 10cc left UK Records in 1975 for Mercury Records, after which they achieved success in America, particularly with \"I'm Not in Love\" (1975). ===Move to New York=== King in 1982 In April 1978 King stood for parliament as an independent in the Epsom and Ewell by-election, calling himself the Royalist party. He gained 2,350 votes.\"1978 By Election Results\", by-elections.co.uk A year later he decided to leave the music industry and closed UK Records. He wrote to the charts committee of the British Phonographic Industry in August 1979 alleging that the lower levels of the charts reflected \"clever promotion and marketing rather than good records\", and suggesting that only information about the top 30 should be made available. The idea was that this would force programmers to base their airplay decisions on something other than the lower charts.\"King Advocates Chart Cuts,\" Billboard, 25 August 1979, 68. The UK Records New York office on 57th Street was turned into an apartment, and King set about building a new career in writing and broadcasting. He was given a weekly five- minute slot on BBC Radio 1 called \"A King in New York\", a \"Postcard from America\" slot in Radio 4, and he reported for Radio 1 on the 1980 presidential election.King, 65 My Life So Far, ch. 15. In December 1980, watching television in bed, he heard there had been a shooting outside the Dakota Apartments. He called and woke up BBC producer Tom Brook, who was living in New York; Brook became the first to announce to the UK that John Lennon had died.Brooks, Tom (8 December 2010). \"Lennon's death: I was there\", BBC News. Throughout 1980 and 1981 King presented a radio talk show on New York's WMCA from 10\u201312 weekday mornings, and regularly reported from the United States on Top of the Pops.

The following year he founded The Tip Sheet (1993\u20132002), an influential weekly trade magazine promoting new acts. King's media work included finding and producing the Eurovision Song Contest entrant for the BBC from 1995. He selected several songs for them. Love City Groove's song, \"Love City Groove\", came tenth in 1995. Gina G's \"Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit\" came eighth the following year, and was number one in the UK. \"Love Shine A Light\" by Katrina and the Waves came first in 1997. His entry for 1998, when the UK hosted the event in Birmingham, was by Imaani and came second. His writing continued. His second novel, The Booker Prize Winner, was published that year.

King continued to maintain his innocence throughout, protesting, among other things, that the lack of a statute of limitations in the UK for sex offences meant he had been unable to defend himself adequately because of the many years that had passed. The National Criminal Intelligence Service had begun investigating King for child sexual abuse in 2000, when a man told them he had been assaulted by King and others 30 years earlier.Hall, Sarah (22 November 2001). \"Victim's angry email led to downfall\".

King was arrested in November that year and bailed on \u00a3150,000, \u00a350,000 of which was put up by Simon Cowell.Walker, Tim (27 November 2011). \"Jonathan King: 'My book's an online hit, millions click on my videos. How about lifting the media ban on me?'\", The Independent. He was arrested again in January 2001 on further allegations.\"Second arrest for Jonathan King\", The Guardian, 24 January 2001.\"King faces fresh charges\". BBC News. 25 January 2001. Twenty-seven men told police that King had sexually assaulted them during the period 1969\u20131989. Police found pictures of teenagers in a search of King's home. King admitted having approached thousands of people with questionnaires about youth interests, doing market research. The questionnaires asked recipients to list topics according to importance including music, sport, friends and family; the prosecution claimed that boys who listed sex high in their list of priorities were then targeted by King.\"King's path to shame\". BBC News. 21 November 2001. After the second trial at the Old Bailey on 21 November 2001, Judge David Paget QC sentenced King to 7 years in prison using the first trial verdict as a sample for \"all previous sexual behaviour\". In addition, King was placed on the Sex Offenders Register, prohibited from working with children, and ordered to pay \u00a314,000 costs.Clough, Sue; O'Neill, Sean (22 November 2001). \"Pop veteran Jonathan King given seven years for abusing schoolboys\". The Daily Telegraph. London. In 2003 the Court of Appeal rejected his application to appeal both the conviction and the sentence; he had argued that the conviction was unsafe and the sentence, with guidelines of two years, had been \"manifestly too severe\". He appealed twice unsuccessfully to the Criminal Cases Review Commission,Tryhorn, Chris (15 April 2003). \"King makes fresh appeal bid\", The Guardian and was released on parole in March 2005, strongly proclaiming his innocence. King has complained about his media coverage since his 2001 conviction. In 2005 he went to the Press Complaints Commission about an article in the News of the World that said he had gone to a park to \"ogle\" boys. In fact he had gone there at the request of a documentary maker. The complaint was not upheld, but Roy Greenslade argued that King had a good case.Greenslade, Roy (4 July 2005). \"King had cause for complaint\", The Guardian. In October 2011 then BBC Director-General Mark Thompson apologised to King for the removal of King's performance of \"It Only Takes a Minute\" from a repeat, on BBC Four, of a 1976 episode of Top of the Pops. King described the cut as a \"Stalinist revision approach to history\". When asked by a newspaper in 2012 if he believed he had anything to apologise for, to anybody from his past, King replied, \"The only apology I have is to say that I was good at seduction. I was good at making myself seem attractive when I wasn't very attractive at all\". He appeared in front of the Leveson Inquiry. On 20 June 2020 King posted on Twitter a photo of a letter from the Metropolitan Police confirming that he had been removed from the Sex Offenders Register the previous day.https://twitter.com/KingOfHits/status/1274310333641957376/photo/1 ===After prison=== Journalist Robert Chalmers wrote that King's creative output after he left prison \"resembled a primal scream of rage\". Two novels appeared: Beware the Monkey Man (2010), under the pen name Rex Kenny, and Death Flies, Missing Girls and Brigitte Bardot (2013), under his real name, Kenneth George King. He also published a diary, Three Months (2012), and two volumes of his autobiography, Jonathan King 65: My Life So Far (2009) and 70 FFFY (2014). King maintained an interest in prison issues and writes a column for Inside Time, the national newspaper for prisoners.\"Jonathan King\", Inside Time. He released Earth to King in 2008. One of the new songs on the album, \"The True Story of Harold Shipman\" was about the serial killer Dr. Harold Shipman, in which King suggested that Shipman may have been a victim of the media.\"Families' anger over Shipman song\", BBC News, 12 July 2007. He also produced three films. Vile Pervert: The Musical (2008), available for free download, is a 96-minute film in which King plays all 21 parts and presents his version of events surrounding his prosecution. He portrays his viewpoint of the events responsible for his troubles. In one scene King, dressed as Oscar Wilde, sings that there is \"nothing wrong with buggering boys\". Rod Liddle called it \"a fantastically berserk, bravado performance\". Me Me Me (2011) was described at the Cannes Film Festival as \"a re-telling of Romeo and Juliet\".Sharp, Rob (12 May 2011). \"Cannes Diary: From disgraced D-listers to ex-drug dealing singers, festival embraces them all\", The Independent. The Pink Marble Egg (2013) is a spy story; for publicity King drove down the Promenade de la Croisette in Cannes with a pink papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 egg on top of his Rolls Royce during the Cannes Film Festival. ===2018 trial=== In August 2015, King wrote an article for The Spectator magazine concerning Sir Edward Heath, the subject of the now-discredited Operation Midland. In September 2015, King was arrested as part of Operation Ravine, a further investigation into claims of sexual abuse at the Walton Hop disco in the 1970s. He was later released on bail.\"Jonathan King freed on bail over sex offence claims\". BBC News. 10 September 2015.\"Ex-DJ Denning charged with child sex offences\". BBC News. 7 June 2016. On 25 May 2017, he was charged by Surrey Police with 18 sexual offences, relating to nine boys aged between 14 and 16, allegedly carried out between 1970 and 1986. He was released on bail and appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 26 June, where he was released on conditional bail to appear at Southwark Crown Court on 31 July. His trial began on 11 June 2018, and on 27 June the jury was discharged for legal reasons. On 6 August 2018, King received an apology for the collapse of the trial, with Judge Deborah Taylor saying that Surrey Police had made \"numerous, repeated and compounded\" errors during the investigation, describing the situation as a \"debacle\". In her ruling she said \"I have concluded that this is a case where even if it were possible to have a fair trial, it is in the rare category where the balance, taking account of the history, the failures and misleading of the Court, is in favour of a stay on the basis that following what has occurred, continuation would undermine public confidence in the administration of justice\".Further ruling on application for a stay R v Kenneth King. Retrieved 9 September 2018. Taylor said that the case against King had been motivated by \"concerns about reputational damage to Surrey Police\" following the allegations of sexual abuse against Jimmy Savile. Surrey Police \"wholeheartedly apologised\" to King, saying: \"We deeply regret that despite these efforts we did not meet the required standards to ensure a fair trial.\" King refused to accept the apology, and criticised Surrey Police for \"deep, institutional faults\". He urged both the Chief Constable and the Police and Crime Commissioner to go. After the \"debacle\", as Judge Taylor described the 2018 trial, many respected commentators started to question the verdict of the 2001 trial including Bob Woffinden in his book The Nicholas Cases and Daniel Finkelstein in The Times; the Criminal Cases Review Commission announced it was reopening an investigation into it, after fresh evidence emerged during the 2018 prosecution. In August 2019 Chief Constable Stephens, who had replaced Ephgrave, announced that, in the year since King's acquittal, the Surrey Police success rate for convictions in sex abuse cases had dropped from 20% to \"under 4%\". On 22 November 2019, an independent review into the police investigation leading to the trial was published. It was critical of the handling of disclosure of documents to King's defence prior to the trial, and questioned whether some of the staff involved had been qualified or experienced enough to handle the case.Operation Ravine Peer Review Report Surrey Police, 22 November 2019. ==Selected works== ===Singles discography=== ====As performer==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text- align:left; float:center; margin-left:10px;\" |- ! colspan=5 | As performer or producer/performer |- ! || Single (A and B side)|| UK \"Jonathan King\", officialcharts.com.|| Credited to|| Label |- | rowspan=\"4\"|1965 || \"Gotta Tell\" / \"When I Come to You\" || || Terry Ward with the Bumblies || Fontana\"Record Details\", 45cat.com. |- || \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\" / \"Summer's Coming\" ||4||Jonathan King || Decca\"Jonathan King \u2013 Discography\", 45cat.com. |- || \"Green is the Grass\" / \"Creation\" || || Jonathan King || Decca |- || \"Where the Sun Has Never Shone\" / \"Don't Talk to Me of Protest\" || || Jonathan King || Decca |- | rowspan=\"2\"|1966 || \"Just Like a Woman\" / \"The Land of the Golden Tree\" || ||Jonathan King || Decca |- ||\"Icicles (Fell From the Heart of a Bluebird)\" / \"In a Hundred Years From Now\" || || Jonathan King || Decca |- | rowspan=\"2\"|1967 || \"Seagulls\" / \"Take a Look At Yourself Babe\" || || Jonathan King || Decca |- || \"Round, Round\" / \"Time and Motion\" || || Jonathan King || Decca |- |1969 ||\"Let It All Hang Out\" / \"Colloquial Sex (Legend of Today)\" || 26 || Jonathan King || Decca |- | rowspan=\"2\"|1970 || \"Million Dollar Bash\" / \"City of Angels\" || || Jonathan King || Decca |- || \"Cherry, Cherry\" / \"Gay Girl\" || || Jonathan King || Decca |- | rowspan=\"7\"|1971 || \"It's the Same Old Song\" || 19 || Weathermen || B&C; |- || \"Baby, You've Been on My Mind\" || || Nemo || B&C; |- || \"The Sun Has Got His Hat On\" || || Nemo || B&C; |- || \"Sugar Sugar\" || 12 || Sakkarin || RCA |- || \"Lazy Bones\" / \"I Just Want to Say Thank You'\"||23|| Jonathan King|| Decca |- || \"Johnny Reggae\" ||3 || The Piglets || Bell |- || \"Hooked on a Feeling\" / \"I Don't Want to Be Gay\" ||23|| Jonathan King || Decca |- | rowspan=\"4\"|1972 || \"Who's Been Polishing the Sun\" || || Nemo || Parlophone |- || \"Flirt!\" / \"Hey Jim!\" || 22 || Jonathan King || Decca |- || \"Loop di Love\" || 4 || Shag || UK |- || \"It's a Tall Order for a Short Guy\" / \"Learned Tax Counsel\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- | rowspan=\"4\"|1973 || \"Be Gay\" / \"S*p*rsh*t***\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- || \"Mary, My Love\" / \"A Little Bit Left of Right\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- || \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\" (UK Solid Gold) / \"Summer's Coming\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- || \"A Modest Proposal (Swift's Song)\" / \"The Kung Fu Anthem\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- | rowspan=\"3\"|1974 || \"Hooked on a Feeling\" / \"I Don't Want to Be Gay\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- || \"Help Me Make It Through the Night\" (with Eiri Thrasher) / \"Colloquial Sex (Lawrence's Song)\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- || \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" || 29 || Bubblerock || UK |- | rowspan=\"5\"|1975 || \"A Free Man in Paris\" / \"The True Story of Molly Malone\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- || \"Chick-A-Boom (Don't Ya Jes' Love It)\" || 36 || 53rd and 3rd featuring the Sound of Shag || UK |- || \"The Way You Look Tonight\" / \"The True Story of Molly Malone\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- || \"Una Paloma Blanca (White Dove)\" / \"Inpraiseofuk\" (spoken word) || 5 || Jonathan King || UK |- || \"Baby, the Rain Must Fall\" / \"A Very, Very Melancholy Man\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- | rowspan=\"7\"|1976 || \"The Happy People Song\" / \"I've Never Seen a Woman\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- || \"Little Latin Lupe Lu\" / \"Sex Appeal\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- || \"He's So Fine\" / \"The King of the Hooks\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- || \"In the Mood\" || 46 || Sound 9418 || UK |- || \"It Only Takes a Minute\" || 9 || One Hundred Ton and a Feather || UK |- || \"Mississippi\" / \"The Littlest Greatest Love\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- || \"When I Was a Star\" / \"The Littlest Greatest Love\" || || Jonathan King || UK |- | rowspan=\"3\"|1978 || \"Old DJ's (Playing New Sounds)\" / \"I'm the One\" || || Jonathan King || Epic |- || \"One for You, One for Me\" / \"Cryin' Again\" || 29 || || GTO |- || \"Lick a Smurp for Christmas (All Fall Down)\" || 58 || Father Abraphart and The Smurps || Magnet |- | rowspan=\"2\"|1979 || \"You're the Greatest Lover\" / \"The Death of the Last Unicorn\" || 67 || Jonathan King || UK |- || \"Gloria\" / \"Mental Diseases\" ||65 || Jonathan King || Ariola |- |1980 || \"It's Illegal, It's Immoral, It's Unhealthy, but It's Fun\" / \"Sing Your Own Immorality\" || || Jonathan King || WEA |- |1982 || \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\" / \"Summer's Coming\" || || Jonathan King || Old Gold |- |1983 || \"I'll Slap Your Face (Entertainment U.S.A.
