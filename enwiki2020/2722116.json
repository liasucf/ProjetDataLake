    "text": "Schloss in Weimar where Bach was court organist. The organ loft is visible at the top of the picture. The Orgelb\u00fcchlein (Little Organ Book) BWV 599\u2212644 is a set of 45 chorale preludes for organ \u2014 one of them is given in two versions \u2014 by Johann Sebastian Bach. All but three were written between 1708 and 1717 when Bach served as organist to the ducal court in Weimar; the remainder and a short two-bar fragment came no earlier than 1726, after the composer\u2019s appointment as cantor at the Thomasschule in Leipzig. The plan was for a collection of 164 settings of chorale tunes sung during the Church year so that each part of the year was represented. Although this number was not to be, the Orgelb\u00fcchlein does span the calendar and more importantly signals a maturity and new breadth in Bach\u2019s compositional style, not only with regard to this instrument. Each setting takes an existing Lutheran chorale, adds a motivic accompaniment, and quite freely explores form. Many of the preludes are short and in four parts, requiring only a single keyboard and pedal, with an unadorned cantus firmus. Others involve two keyboards and pedal. These include several canons, four ornamental four-part preludes with elaborately decorated chorale lines, and one prelude in trio sonata form. Indeed the Orgelb\u00fcchlein manages to be a collection of music for church services, a treatise on composition, a religious statement, and an organ-playing manual! ==Title page== Title page of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein.

1708-09 specifications, with a third keyboard and 26 bell glockenspiel. Example of a possible registration for BWV 605 with glockenspiel. Bach's formal training as a musician started when he was enrolled as a chorister at the Michaelskirche in L\u00fcneburg in 1700-1702\\. Manuscripts in Bach's hand recently discovered in Weimar by the Bach scholars Peter Wollny and Michael Maul show that while in L\u00fcneburg he studied the organ with Georg B\u00f6hm, composer and organist at the Johanniskirche. The documents are hand copies made in B\u00f6hm's home in tablature format of organ compositions by Reincken, Buxtehude and others. They indicate that already at the age of 15 Bach was an accomplished organist, playing some of the most demanding repertoire of the period.See: * * After a brief spell in Weimar as court musician in the chapel of Johann Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, Bach was appointed as organist at St. Boniface's Church (now called the Bachkirche) in Arnstadt in the summer of 1703, having inspected and reported on the organ there earlier in the year. In 1705-1706 he was granted leave from Arnstadt to study with the organist and composer Dieterich Buxtehude in L\u00fcbeck, a pilgrimage he famously made on foot. In 1707 Bach became organist at St. Blasius' Church in M\u00fchlhausen, before his second appointment at the court in Weimar in 1708 as concertmaster and organist, where he remained until 1717. During the period before his return to Weimar, Bach had composed a set of 31 chorale preludes: these were discovered independently by Christoph Wolff and Wilhelm Krunbach in the library of Yale University in the mid-1980s and first published as Das Arnstadter Orgelbuch. They form part of a larger collection of organ music compiled in the 1790s by the organist Johann Gottfried Neumeister (1756\u20131840) and are now referred to as the Neumeister Chorales BWV 1090-1120\\. These chorale preludes are all short, either in variation form or fughettas.See: * * Only a few other organ works based on chorales can be dated with any certainty to this period. These include the chorale partitas BWV 766-768 and 770, all sets of variations on a given chorale.See: * * During his time as organist at Arnstadt, Bach was upbraided in 1706 by the Arnstadt Consistory \"for having hitherto introduced sundry curious embellishments in the chorales and mingled many strange notes in them, with the result that the congregation has been confused.\" The type of chorale prelude to which this refers, often called the \"Arnstadt type\", were used to accompany the congregation with modulating improvisatory sections between the verses: examples that are presumed to be of this form include BWV 715, 722, 726, 729, 732 and 738. The earliest surviving autograph manuscript of a chorale prelude is BWV 739, Wie sch\u00f6n leuchtet der Morgenstern, based on an Epiphany hymn. It dates from 1705 and possibly was prepared for Bach's visit to L\u00fcbeck.See: * * File:BWV739-autograph-manuscript.png|Autograph manuscript of BWV 739 File:Herderkirche Weimar Cranach Altarpiece.jpg|Cranach altarpiece in St Peter und Paul, where Bach played the organ File:Weimar Christoph Riegel 1686.jpeg|View of Weimar, 1686: Wilhelmsburg in centre, St Peter and Paul behind, Rote Schloss over footbridge on left File:Weimar_Wilhelmsburg_1730.jpg|Wilhelmsburg, Weimar, c 1730, built in the 1650s and destroyed by fire in 1774 ==Purpose== ==Compositional style== Although there are a few important departures, the chorale preludes of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein were composed with a number of common stylistic features, which characterise and distinguish the so-called \"Orgelb\u00fcchlein style:\" *They are harmonisations of a cantus firmus which is taken by the soprano voice. *They are in four parts, with three accompanying voices. *The harmonies are filled out in the accompanying voices by motifs or figures derived from the cantus and written imitatively. *They begin directly with the cantus, either with or without accompaniment. *There are no breaks between the lines of the cantus for ritornellos or interludes in the accompanying voices. *The notes ending verse lines in the cantus are marked by fermata (pauses). Exceptions include: * BWV 611, ', where the cantus is in the alto voice * BWV 600, 608, 618, 619, 620, 624, 629 and 633/634 where the soprano cantus is in canon with another voice. * BWV 615, In dir ist Freude, where the cantus is heard in canon in all the voices over the accompanying motifs. * BWV 599, Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, and BWV 619, Christe du Lamm Gottes, which are written for five voices. * BWV 639, Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, which is written for three voices. * BWV 617, 618, 619 and 637, where the accompaniment starts before the cantus. ==Chorale Preludes BWV 599\u2013644== :The brief descriptions of the chorale preludes are based on the detailed analysis in and . The metrical English translations of the texts of the Lutheran chorales are mostly taken from ; more literal translations can be found in and have been provided in the text below when appropriate. :To listen to a MIDI or ogg recording, please click on the link. :To listen to an MP3 recording of James Kibbie on the 1717 Trost organ, St. Walpurgis, Gro\u00dfengottern, Germany, please right click on the external link. ===Advent BWV 599\u2013602=== The melody and words of \"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\" from the Erfurt Enchiridion, 1524 * BWV 599 Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland [Come now Saviour of heathens] \u2022 play MP3 500px Below is the first verse of Luther's advent hymn \"Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland\" with the translation in English of George MacDonald. {| |- | ::Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, ::der Jungfrauen Kind erkannt! ::dass sich wundre alle Welt, ::Gott solch' Geburt ihm bestellt. | ::Come, Saviour of nations wild, ::Of the maiden owned the Child, ::Fill with wonder all the earth, ::God should grant it such a birth. | |} Although it has often been suggested that this opening advent chorale prelude resembles a French overture, in construction, with its texture of arpeggiated chords, it is more similar to the baroque keyboard preludes of German and French masters, such as Couperin. The accompanying motif in the lower three or sometimes four parts is derived from a suspirans in the melodic line, formed of a semiquaver (16th note) rest\u2014a \"breath\"\u2014followed by three semiquavers and a longer fourth note. Some commentators have seen this falling figure as representing a descent to earth, but it could equally well reflect a repetition of the words \"Nun komm\" in the text. The suspirans is made up of intervals of a rising second, a falling fourth following by yet another rising second. It is derived from the first line of the melody of the cantus firmus and often shared out freely between voices in the accompaniment. The mystery of the coming of the Saviour is reflected by the somewhat hidden cantus firmus, over harmonies constantly reinventing themselves. It is less predictable and regular than other settings of the same hymn by Bach or predecessors like Buxtehude, only the second and third lines having any regularity. The last line repeats the first but with the suspirans suppressed and the dotted rhythms of the bass replaced by a long pedal note, possibly reflecting the wonder described in the third and fourth lines of the first verse. * BWV 600 Gott, durch deine G\u00fcte [God, through your goodness] (or Gottes Sohn ist kommen [The Son of God is come]) \u2022 play MP3 St John the Baptist with the Lamb of God, early 16C stained glass from Mariawald Abbey near Cologne 500px Below is the first of three verses of Johann Spannenberg's advent hymn with the translation in English of Charles Sanford Terry. {| |- | ::Gott, durch deine G\u00fcte, ::wolst uns arme Leute ::Herze, Sinn und Gem\u00fcte ::f\u00fcr des Teufels W\u00fcten ::am Leben und im Todt ::gn\u00e4diglich beh\u00fcten. | ::God of grace and mercy, ::Glance in pity on me; ::Heart and mind and spirit, ::Keep them through Thy merit. ::Satan every hour ::Waiteth to devour. | |} It is set to the same melody as Johann Roh's advent hymn Gottes Sohn ist kommen, the first verse of which is given here with the English translation of Catherine Winkworth. {| |- | ::Gottes Sohn ist kommen ::uns allen zu Frommen ::hier auf diese Erden ::in armen Geb\u00e4rden, ::da\u00df er uns von S\u00fcnde ::freiet' und entb\u00fcnde. | ::Once He came in blessing, ::All our ills redressing; ::Came in likeness lowly, ::Son of God most holy; ::Bore the cross to save us, ::Hope and freedom gave us. | |} This chorale prelude is a canon at the octave in the soprano and tenor voices, with the tenor entering one bar after the soprano. The stops for the canonic parts were explicitly marked by Bach in the autograph score, with the high tenor part in the pedal, written at the pitch Bach intended and also within the compass of the Weimar organ. Bach left no indication that the manualiter parts were to be played on two keyboards: indeed, as points out, the autograph score brackets all the keyboard parts together; in addition technically at certain points the keyboard parts have to be shared between the two hands. The accompaniment is a skillful and harmonious moto perpetuo in the alto and bass keyboard parts with flowing quavers (eighth notes) in the alto, derived from the first four quaver suspirans figure, played above a walking bass in detached crotchets (quarter notes). The hymn was originally written in duple time but, to facilitate the canonic counterpoint, Bach adopted triple time with a minim beat, at half the speed of the bass. The bass accompaniment at first is derived directly from the melody; during the pauses in the soprano part, a second motif recurs. The continuous accompaniment in quavers and crotchets is an example of the first of two types of joy motif described by , used to convey \"direct and naive joy.\" In the words of Albert Riemenschneider, \"the exuberance of the passage work indicates a joyous background.\" * BWV 601 Herr Christ, der einge Gottes- Sohn [Lord Christ, the only Son of God] (or Herr Gott, nun sei gepreiset [Lord God, now be praised]) \u2022 play MP3 The Annunciation, early 16C German stained glass roundel 500px Below are the first and last verses of Elisabeth Cruciger's hymn for Epiphany Herr Christ, der einig Gotts Sohn with the English translation of Myles Coverdale. {| |- | ::Herr Christ, der ein'ge Gottes-Sohn ::Vaters in Ewigkeit, ::aus sein'm Herzen entsprossen, ::gleichwie geschrieben steht, ::er is der Morgensterne, ::sein Gl\u00e4nzen streckt er ferne ::vor andern Sternen klar. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Ert\u00f6t uns durch dein G\u00fcte, ::erweck uns durch dein Gnad; ::den alten Menschen kr\u00e4nke, ::da\u00df der neu' leben mag ::wohl hie auf dieser Erden, ::den Sinn und all Begehren ::und G'danken hab'n zu dir. | ::Christ is the only Sonne of God, ::The Father Eternall: ::We have in Jesse founde this rod, ::God and Man natural! ::He is the mornynge star; ::His beames sendeth He out farre ::Beyonde other starres all. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Awake us, Lorde, we praye The; ::Thy Holy Spirite us gave, ::Which maye oure olde man mortifie, ::That oure new man maye lyve. ::So wyll we alwaye thanke The, ::That shewest us so great mercye, ::And oure synnes dost forgeve. | |} The same melody was used in the postprandial grace Herr Gott, nun sei gepreiset, the first verse of which is given below with the English translation of Charles Sanford Terry. {| |- | ::Herr Gott, nun sei gepreiset, ::wir sagen frohen Dank, ::da\u00df du uns Gnad' erwiesen, ::gegeben Speis' und Trank, ::dein mildes Herz zu merken, ::den Glauben uns zu st\u00e4rken, ::da\u00df du seist unser Gott. | ::O God in heaven we praise Thee ::And yield Thee gratitude ::For all Thy generous bounty, ::For all our daily food, ::For all the love showered on us. ::For all the grace poured on us, ::By Thee, our loving Lord. | |} According to the chronology of , this chorale prelude was probably the first to be entered by Bach in the autograph manuscript. Already it shows with beguiling simplicity all the features typical of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein preludes. The cantus firmus is presented unadorned in the soprano line with the other three voices on the same keyboard and in the pedal. The accompaniment is derived from the suspirans pedal motif of three semiquavers (16th notes) followed by two quavers (eighth notes). For this particular motif signified \"beatific joy\", representing either \"intimate gladness or blissful adoration.\" Although the chorale prelude cannot be precisely matched to the words of either hymn, the mood expressed is in keeping both with joy for the coming of Christ and gratitude for the bountifulness of God. The motif, which is anticipated and echoed in the seamlessly interwoven inner parts, was already common in chorale preludes of the period. Easy to play with alternating feet, it figured in particular in the preludes of Buxtehude and B\u00f6hm as well as an earlier manualiter setting of the same hymn by Bach's cousin, Johann Gottfried Walther. Bach, however, goes beyond the previous models, creating a unique texture in the accompaniment which accelerates, particularly in the pedal, towards the cadences. Already in the opening bar, as points out, the subtlety of Bach's compositional skills are apparent. The alto part anticipates the pedal motif and, with it and the later dotted figure, echos the melody in the soprano. This type of writing\u2014in this case with hidden and understated imitation between the voices, almost in canon, conveying a mood of intimacy\u2014was a new feature introduced by Bach in his Orgelb\u00fcchlein. * BWV 602 Lob sei dem allm\u00e4chtigen Gott [Praise be to God Almighty] \u2022 play MP3 Adoration of the Trinity, Albrecht D\u00fcrer 500px Below are the first two verses of Michael Weisse's advent hymn with the English translation of John Gambold. {| |- | ::Lob sei dem allm\u00e4chtigen Gott, ::der unser sich erbarmet hat, ::gefandt sein allerliebsten Sohn, ::aus ihm geborn im h\u00f6chsten Thron, ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::auf da\u00df er unser Heiland w\u00fcrd, ::uns freiet von der S\u00fcndenb\u00fcrd ::und durch sein Gnade und Wahrheit ::f\u00fchret zur ewigen Klarheit. | ::To God we render thanks and praise, ::Who pitied mankind's fallen race, ::And gave His dear and only Son ::That us, as children, He might own. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::He came to seek and save the lost; ::We sinned, and He would bear the cost. ::That we might share eternal bliss; ::O what unbounded love was this! | |} The cantus firmus for this chorale prelude originates in the Gregorian chant Conditor alme siderum. Although in the phrygian mode, Bach slightly modifies it, replacing some B\u266ds by B\u266es in the melody, but still ends in the key of A. The accompaniment is composed of two motifs, both suspirans: one in the inner parts contains a joy motif; and the other, shared between all three lower parts, is formed of three semiquavers (16th notes) and a longer note or just four semiquavers. In the pedal part this prominent descending motif has been taken to symbolise the \"coming down of divine Majesty.\" Some commentators have suggested that the motion of the inner parts in parallel thirds or sixths might represent the Father and Son in the hymn. Albert Riemenschneider described the lower voices as creating \"an atmosphere of dignified praise.\" ===Christmas BWV 603\u2013612=== * BWV 603 Puer natus in Bethlehem [A boy is born in Bethlehem] \u2022 play MP3 Wildungen altarpiece of Konrad von Soest 500px Below is the first verse of the traditional Latin carol Puer natus in Bethlehem with the English translation of Hamilton Montgomerie MacGill. {| |- | ::Puer natus est in Bethlehem, ::unde gaudet Ierusalem! ::Alleluia, alleluia! | ::A Child is born in Bethlehem; ::Exult for joy, Jerusalem! ::Allelijah, Allelujah! | |} Treble part of Puer natus in Bethlehem, Lossius 1553 The cantus firmus in the soprano voice of this chorale prelude is a slight variant of the treble part of a four-part setting of Puer natus by Lossius. The chorale prelude is in four parts for single manual and pedals. It is unusual in that in most published versions no repeats are marked. However, in the autograph score there are markings by Bach at the end of the score which might indicate that a repeat of the whole prelude was envisaged with first and second time versions for the last bar. Some recent editions have incorporated this suggestion. The two inner voices and pedal follow the usual Orgelb\u00fcchlein pattern, providing a harmonious accompaniment, with gently rocking quavers in the inner voices and a repeated motif in the pedal, rising first and then descending in crotchet steps. Various commentators have proposed interpretations of the accompanying motifs: the rocking motif to suggest the action of swaddling; and the pedal motif as symbolising either the \"journey of the Magi\" to Bethlehem () or Christ's \"descent to earth\" (). On a purely musical level, a mood of increasing wonder is created as the accompaniment intensifies throughout the chorale with more imitative entries in the inner parts. * BWV 604 Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ [Praised be you, Jesus Christ] a 2 Clav. et Ped. \u2022 play MP3 The Nativity, Albrecht Altdorfer 500px Below is the first verse of Martin Luther's version \"Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ\" (1524) of the traditional Christmas hymn Gratis nunc omnes reddamus, with the English translation of Myles Coverdale. {| |- | ::Gelobet seist du, Jesu Christ, ::dass du Mensch geboren bist ::von einer Jungfrau, das ist wahr; ::des freuet sich der Engel Schar. ::Kyrieleis! | ::Now blessed be Thou, Christ Jesu; ::Thou art man borne, this is true: ::The aungels made a mery noyse, ::Yet have we more cause to rejoyse. ::Kirieleyson. | |} Bach used the same hymn in other organ compositions as well as in the cantatas BWV 64, 91 and 248, parts I and III (the Christmas Oratorio). The chorale prelude is scored for two manuals and pedal, with the cantus firmus in the soprano voice on the upper manual. On the lower manual the two inner voices provide the harmonic accompaniment, moving stepwise in alternating semiquavers. The pedal part responds throughout with a constantly varying motif involving octave semiquaver leaps. The chorale prelude is in the mixolydian mode. Combined with the unadorned but singing melody and its gentle accompaniment, this produces a mood of tenderness and rapture. * BWV 605 Der Tag, der ist so freudenreich [The day is so full of joy] a 2 Clav. et Ped. \u2022 play MP3 The Nativity, early 16C stained glass from Mariawald Abbey near Cologne 500px Below is the German version of the Christmas hymn Dies est latitiae with the English translation by Charles Sanford Terry. {| |- | ::Der Tag, der is so freudenreich ::aller Kreature, ::denn Gottes Sohn vom Himmelreich ::\u00fcber die Nature ::von einer Jungfrau is geboren, ::Maria, du bist auserkoren ::das du Mutter w\u00e4rest. ::Was geschah so wunderlich? ::Gottes Sohn vom Himmelreich, ::der is Mensch geboren. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Ein Kindelein so l\u00f6belich ::ist uns geboren heute ::von einer Jungfrau s\u00e4uberlich ::zu Trost uns armen Leuten. ::W\u00e4r uns das Kindein nicht geboren, ::so w\u00e4ren wir allzumal verloren; ::das Heil is unser aller. ::Ei du s\u00fcsser Jesu Christ, ::dass du Mensch geboren bist, ::beh\u00fcttet uns vor der Holle! | ::O hail this brightest day of days, ::All good Christian people! ::For Christ hath come upon our ways, ::Ring it from the steeple! ::Of maiden pure is He the Son; ::For ever shall thy praise be sung, ::Christ's fair mother Mary! ::Ever was there news so great? ::God's own Son from heaven's high state ::Is born the Son of Mary! ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::This day the wondrous Child is born, ::Lent to earth from heaven. ::He comes to cheer a world forlorn, ::Its heavy sin to leaven. ::So, sing ye all the glorious birth ::Which doth redeem our fallen earth, ::And works our salvation. ::Laud to Thee, Child Jesu Christ! ::With mankind Thou'st kept the tryst ::Thou Star of every nation. | |} The melody, medieval in origin, was published with the text in 1529. Apart from BWV 606, Bach composed a harmonisation of the hymn in BWV 294 and set it as a chorale prelude, BWV 719 in the Neumeister Collection. The chorale prelude BWV 605 is written for two manuals and pedal with the cantus firmus in the soprano part. The frequent F\u266es are a hint of the mixolydian mode. The accompanying motif is shared between the two inner voices on the second manual which together provide a continuous stream of semiquavers with two hemidemiquavers on the second semiquaver of each group. The pedal provides a rhythmic pulse with a semiquaver walking bass with sustained notes at each cadence. suggests that the relative simplicity of BWV 605 and the uniformity of the accompaniment could be signs that it was one of the earliest composed pieces in Orgelb\u00fcchlein. Dissonances in the pedal in bars 3 and 5, however, could also be signs of Bach's more mature style. Ernst Arfken and Siegfried Vogels\u00e4nger have interpreted some of the dissonant F\u266es as references to elements of foreboding in the text (for example Ei du s\u00fcsser Jesu Christ in the second verse). The accompanying figure in the inner voices has been interpreted as a joy motif by ; as an evocation of rocking by ; and as symbolising the miracle of virgin birth by Arfken. Many commentators have agreed with that the lively and rhythmic accompaniment conveys \"Christmas joy\". * BWV 606 Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her [From Heaven on high I come here] \u2022 play MP3 Three angels, early 16C stained glass from Germany 500px Below are the first, second and last verses of the Christmas hymn Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her by Martin Luther with the English translation of Catherine Winkworth. {| |- | ::Vom Himmel hoch, da komm ich her. ::ich bring' euch gute neue M\u00e4r, ::der guten M\u00e4r bring ich so viel, ::davon ich singn und sagen will. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 :: Euch ist ein Kindlein heut' geborn ::Von einer Jungfrau auserkorn, ::Ein Kindelein, so zart und fein, ::Das soll eu'r Freud und Wonne sein. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Lob, Ehr sei Gott im h\u00f6chsten Thron, ::Der uns schenkt seinen ein'gen Sohn. ::Des freuen sich der Engel Schar ::Und singen uns solch neues Jahr. | ::From Heaven above to earth I come ::To bear good news to every home; ::Glad tidings of great joy I bring ::Whereof I now will say and sing: ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::To you this night is born a child ::Of Mary, chosen mother mild; ::This little child, of lowly birth, ::Shall be the joy of all your earth. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Glory to God in highest Heaven, ::Who unto man His Son hath given! ::While angels sing with pious mirth ::A glad New Year to all the earth. | |} Cantus firmus, \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\", Lutheran hymnbook, 1539. The melody of Vom Himmel hoch was published in 1539. The hymn was performed throughout the Christmas period, particularly during nativity plays. Many composers set it to music for both chorus and organ: closest to Bach's time, Pachelbel and Johann Walther wrote chorale preludes. Bach's use of the hymn in his choral works includes the Magnificat, BWV 243 and 3 settings in the Christmas Oratorio, BWV 248. Apart from BWV 606, his organ settings include the early chorale preludes BWV 701 and 702 from the Kirnberger Collection and BWV 738 from the Neumeister Collection; the five Canonic Variations, BWV 769 were composed towards the end of his life. The chorale prelude BWV 606 is written for single manual and pedal with the cantus firmus in the soprano part. As in all his other organ settings, Bach changed the rhythmic structure of the melody by drawing out the initial upbeats to long notes. This contrasts with Bach's choral settings and the chorale preludes of Pachelbel and Walther, which follow the natural rhythm of the hymn. In BWV 606, the rhythm is further obscured by the cadences of the second and final lines falling on the third beat of the bar. The accompaniment on the keyboard is built from semiquaver motifs, made up of four-note groups of suspirans semiquavers (starting with a rest or \"breath\"). These include turning figures and ascending or descending scales all presented in the first bar. The semiquaver figures, sometimes in parallel thirds or sixths, run continuously throughout the upper parts, including the soprano part, further obscuring the melody. Below the upper voices, there is a striding pedal part in quavers with alternate footing. In the two closing bars, there is a fleeting appearance of figures usually associated with crucifixion chorales, such as Da Jesu an dem Kreuzer stund, BWV 621: semiquaver cross motifs Similar to the Bach motif but with different pitches, this is a four-note figure with the first and fourth notes having the same pitch, but the second and third notes higher and lower (or lower and higher); so named because the two lines joining the end notes and the middle notes form a cross. in the upper parts above delayed or dragging entries in the pedal. The predominant mood of the chorale prelude is one of joyous exultation. The semiquaver motifs, in constant motion upwards and downwards, create what called \"a charming maze,\" symbolising angels heralding the birth of Christ. As Anton Heiller and others have observed, the brief musical allusions to the crucifixion in the closing bars bring together themes from Christmas and Easter, a momentary reminder that Christ came into the world to suffer; in the words of , \"Christ's Incarnation and Passion are inseparable, and Bach tried to express this through musical means.\" * BWV 607 Vom Himmel kam der Engel Schar [From Heaven came the host of angels] \u2022 play MP3 Annunciation to the shepherds, 15C book of hours, Mainz 500px Below are the first and fourth verses of Martin Luther's Christmas hymn Vom Himmel kam der Engel Schar with the English translation of Catherine Winkworth. {| |- | ::Vom Himmel kam der Engel Schar, ::erschien den Hirten offenbar; ::sie sagten ihn'n: ein Kindlein zart, ::das liegt dort in der Krippe hart ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Was kann euch tun die S\u00fcnd' und Tod? ::Ihr habt mit euch den wahren Gott. ::la\u00dft zuernen Teufel und die H\u00f6ll' ::Gott's Sohn ist worden eu'r Gesell. | ::From heaven the angel-troop come near, ::And to the shepherds plain appear: ::A tender little child, they cry, ::In a rough manger lies hard by. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::What can death do to you, or sin? ::The true God is to you come in. ::Let hell and Satan raging go \u2014 ::The Son of God's your comrade now. | |} Tenor part of Puer natus in Bethlehem, Lossius 1553 The cantus firmus of this chorale prelude is in the soprano voice and is drawn from the tenor part of the four-part setting of Puer natus by Lossius. It is the only time Bach that used this hymn tune. Although there is some ambiguity in the autograph manuscript, the crossing of parts suggests that the intended scoring is for single manual and pedals. The motifs in the intricately crafted accompaniment are descending and ascending scales, sometimes in contrary motion, with rapid semiquaver scales shared between the inner voices and slower crotchet scales in the walking bass of the pedal part following each phrase of the melody. The mood of the chorale prelude is \"ethereal\" and \"scintillating\", veering elusively between the contemplative harmonised melody and the transitory rushing scales: towards the close the scales in the inner voices envelope the melody. The semiquaver motifs have been taken to represent flights of angels in the firmament: for , \"Bach's music rushes down and up again like the descending and ascending messengers of heaven.\" * BWV 608 In dulci jubilo [In sweet joy] \u2022 play MP3 500px Below is the traditional fourteenth century German/Latin Christmas carol In dulci jubilo with the English/Latin translation of Robert Lucas de Pearsall.

Prior to Bach, there had been settings of the carol as a canon by Fridolin Sicher and Johann Walther for organ and by Michael Praetorius for choir. Bach's chorale prelude is written for single manual and pedals, with the leading voice in the soprano. The canon\u2014normally in the tenor part in the carol\u2014is taken up one bar later in the pedal. As was Bach's custom, it was notated in the autograph manuscript at the pitch at which it should sound, although this fell outside the range of baroque pedalboards. The desired effect was achieved by using a 4\u2032 pedal stop, playing the pedals an octave lower. The two accompanying inner voices, based on a descending triplet motif, are also in canon at the octave: such a double canon is unique amongst Bach's organ chorales. Following baroque convention, Bach notated the triplets in the accompaniment as quavers instead of crotchets, to make the score more readable for the organist. The accompaniment also has repeated crotchets on the single note of A, which, combined with the A's in the main canon, simulate the drone of a musette sounding constantly through the chorale until the A in bar 25. At that point the strict canon in the accompaniment stops, but the imitative triplet motif continues until the close, also passing effortlessly into the soprano part. Over the final pedal point, it sounds in all three of the upper voices. There is some ambiguity as to whether Bach intended the crotchets in the accompanying motif to be played as a dotted rhythm in time with the triplets or as two beats against three. The deliberate difference in spacing in the autograph score and the intended drone-like effect might suggest adopting the second solution throughout, although modern editions often contain a combination of the two. The piping triplets above the musette drone create a gentle pastoral mood, in keeping with the subject of the carol. For the constant sounding of A major chords, gently embellished by the accompaniment, suggest unequivocally the festive spirit of the dulci and jubilo in the title; already described the accompanying triplets as representing a \"direct and naive joy.\" Williams further suggests that the F\u266f major chord at bar 25 might be a reference to leuchtet als die Sonne (\"shines like the sun\") in the first verse; and the long pedal point at the close to Alpha es et Omega (\"You are the Alpha and the Omega\") at the end of the first verse. The mood also reflects the first two lines of the third verse, \"O love of the father, O gentleness of the newborn!\" Bach often used canons in his chorale preludes to signify the relation between \"leader\" and \"follower\" as in his settings of Dies sind die heil'gen zehn Gebot (\"These are the Ten Commandments\"); considers that this was unlikely to be the case here, despite the words Trahe me post te (\"Draw me to thee\") in the second verse. * BWV 609 Lobt Gott, ihr Christen, allzugleich [Praise God, you Christians all together] \u2022 play MP3 Adoration of the Magi, Wildungen altarpiece of Konrad von Soest 500px Below are the first and last verses of Nikolaus Herman's Christmas hymn with the English translation by Arthur Tozer Russell. {| |- | ::Lobt Gott, ihr Christen, allzugleich, ::in seinem h\u00f6chsten Thron, ::der heut schlie\u00dft auf sein Himmelreich ::und schenkt uns seinen Sohn. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Das aus seinem Stamm entsprie\u00dfen sollt ::in dieser letzten Zeit, ::durch welchen Gott aufrichten wollt ::sein Reich, die Christenheit. | ::Let all together praise our God ::Upon His lofty throne; ::He hath His heavens unclosed to-day, ::And given to us His Son. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::The glorious gates of Paradise ::The cherub guards no more; ::This day again those gates unfolds! ::With praise our God adore! | |} The melody first appeared with this text in a 1580 hymnbook. Prior to Bach, there were choral settings by Michael Praetorius and Samuel Scheidt and a setting for organ in the choral prelude BuxWV 202 by Dieterich Buxtehude. Apart from BWV 609, Bach set the hymn in the cantatas BWV 151 and 195, the two harmonisations BWV 375 and 376 and the chorale prelude BWV 732. The chorale prelude BWV 609 is scored for single manual and pedal with the cantus firmus unembellished in the soprano voice. The accompaniment in the inner voices is a uniform stream of semiquavers shared between the parts, often in parallel sixths but occasionally in contrary motion. It is built up from several four- note semiquaver motifs first heard in the opening bars. Beneath them in the pedal is a contrasting walking bass in quavers with sustained notes at the end of each phrase. Unlike the inner voices, the pedal part has a wide range: there are two scale-like passages where it rises dramatically through two octaves, covering all the notes from the lowest D to the highest D. The four voices together convey a mood of joyous exultation. speculates that the passages ascending through all the notes of the pedalboard might symbolise the word allzugleich (\"all together\"); and suggest that the widening intervals at the start between the cantus and the descending pedal part might symbolise the opening up of the heavens (schlie\u00dft auf sein Himmelreich). * BWV 610 Jesu, meine Freude [Jesus, my joy] \u2022 play MP3 Adoration of the Christ Child, early 16C Germany stained glass panel 500px Below are the first two verses of Johann Frank's hymn Jesu, meine Freude with the English translation by Catherine Winkworth. {| |- | ::Jesu, meine Freude, ::meines Herzens Weide, ::Jesu, meine Zier, ::ach, wie lang, ach lange ::ist dem Herzen bange ::und verlangt nach dir! ::Gotteslamm, mein Br\u00e4utigam, ::au\u00dfer dir soll mir auf Erden ::nichts sonst Liebers werden! ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Unter deinem Schirmen ::bin ich vor den St\u00fcrmen ::aller Feinde frei. ::La\u00df den Satan wittern, ::la\u00df die Welt ersch\u00fcttern, ::mir steht Jesus bei. ::Ob es jetzt gleich kracht und blitzt, ::obgleich S\u00fcnd' und H\u00f6lle schrecken, ::Jesus will mich decken. | ::Jesu, priceless treasure, ::Source of purest pleasure, ::Truest Friend to me; ::Ah! how long I've panted, ::And my heart hath fainted, ::Thirsting, Lord, for Thee! ::Thine I am, O spotless Lamb, ::I will suffer nought to hide Thee, ::Nought I ask beside Thee. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::In Thine arm I rest me, ::Foes who would molest me ::Cannot reach me here; ::Though the earth be shaking, ::Every heart be quaking, ::Jesus calms my fear; ::Sin and hell in conflict fell ::With their bitter storms assail me; ::Jesus will not fail me. | |} The melody was first published with the text in Johann Cr\u00fcger's hymnal Praxis pietatis melica of 1653. In later hymnbooks the hymn became associated with Christmas and Epiphany; it was also frequently included amongst the so-called Jesuslieder, devotional hymns addressed to Jesus, often for private use. One of the earliest settings of the hymn was Dieterich Buxtehude's cantata BuxWV 60 for four voices, strings and continuo, composed in the 1680s. Bach's friend and colleague Johann Walther composed an organ partita on the hymn in 1712. Apart from BWV 610, Bach's organ settings include the chorale preludes BWV 713 in the Kirnberger Collection, BWV 1105 in the Neumeister Collection and BWV 753 composed in 1720. Amongst his choral settings are the harmonisation BWV 358, the motet BWV 227 for unaccompanied choir and cantatas BWV 12, 64, 81 and 87. The chorale prelude BWV 610 is scored for single manual and pedal, with the cantus firmus unadorned in the soprano voice. Marked Largo, the cantus and accompanying voices in the two inner parts and pedal are written at an unusually low pitch, creating a sombre effect. The accompaniment is based on semiquaver motifs first heard in their entirety in the pedal in bar one; the inner parts often move in parallel thirds followed by quasi-ostinato responses in the pedal. The rich and complex harmonic structure is partly created by dissonances arising from suspensions and occasional chromaticisms in the densely scored accompanying voices: the motifs are skillfully developed but with restraint. Both and concur with the assessment of that \"fervent longing (sehnsuchtsvoll Innigkeit) is marked in every line of the exquisite labyrinth of music in which the master has involved one of his favourite melodies.\" As has pointed out, when composing this chorale prelude Bach might have had in mind one of the alternative more intimate texts for the melody such as Jesu, meine Freude, wird gebohren heute, available in contemporary Weimar hymnbooks and reprinted later in Schemellis Gesangbuch of 1736. * BWV 611 Christum wir sollen loben schon [We should indeed praise Christ] Choral in Alto \u2022 play MP3 Marienalter, Albrecht D\u00fcrer 500px Below is the first verse of Martin Luther's hymn Christum wir sollen loben schon with the English translation of Richard Massie (1854). Luther's text was his version of the Latin hymn A solis ortus cardine, part of the fifth century abecedarius of Coelius Sedulius; it has been inserted between the two. Another extract from Sedulius' poem became the Latin Hymn Hostis herodes impie. The first verse is given below with Luther's German version Was f\u00fcrchtst du, Feind Herodes, sehr to the same melody.

It was used in settings by Scheidt, Scheidemann, Walther and de Grigny, the latter two employing the Latin title. Apart from BWV 611, Bach set the hymn earlier in BWV 696, a chorale prelude from the Kirnberger Collection, and later in his cantata Christum wir sollen loben schon, BWV 121. BWV 611, marked Adagio, has several unusual and novel features. In contrast to the densely scored chorale prelude BWV 610, the four parts\u2014augmented to five by the double pedal in the last two bars\u2014are widely spaced employing the full range of the baroque organ. Apart from chorale preludes that are canons, this is the unique Orgelb\u00fcchlein prelude where the cantus firmus is in the \"middle\" alto voice. Scored for single manual and pedal, the accompanying voices are the soprano (right hand), the tenor (left hand) and the bass (pedal). The cantus firmus alto part is in a dotted rhythm shared between the two hands, as if hidden. The accompanying motif derives from a suspirans figure, a four note descending or ascending semiquaver scale starting off the beat; this flowing motif is possibly derived from the hymn melody, moving as it does in steps, albeit much slower. The motif is first heard high up in the soprano voice which is placed in bare relief by the sustained notes and slow-moving melody in the lower parts. In particular the pedal point in the first note of the bass heightens the dramatic effect of the opening by briefly abandoning the usual motivic Orgelb\u00fcchlein pattern. After the opening, the four note motif is extended throughout in the bass part to five notes by preceding it by a dotted quaver: the slow tempo facilitates semiquaver scales in the pedal. In the sixth bar the soprano and the bass play the highest and lowest notes in the Weimar organ's register, the two C's above and below middle C. The Bach scholar Hermann Keller has described the resulting musical texture as the most ethereal in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein. The \"hidden\" alto hymn tune, occasionally tinged with chromaticism, imparts a further sense of mystery. Above and below it the scale figures in the three accompanying parts are heard meandering in parallel and sometimes contrary motion. In the eleventh bar the bass's motivic accompaniment pauses for a second pedal point after which it resumes by unexpectedly taking up the cantus firmus in canon\u2014two beats after and two octaves below the alto\u2014until the end of the twelfth bar. At the same time in the eleventh bar the soprano and tenor parts play semiquaver motives in canon separated by a quaver and two octaves, before playing in more transparent imitation in bars 12 and 13. After the cadence at bar 14 from D minor to A minor, the accompaniment is augmented to four voices with a second voice in the pedal, first with motivic semiquaver figures in all the parts in the penultimate bar; and then imitative dactylic joy motifs in the soprano and tenor parts during the closing bar. There is a precursor of the musical style of BWV 611\u2014the plainchant melody A solis ortus cardine/Hostis herodes impie accompanied by polyphonic scale motifs\u2014in the 1667 Deuxi\u00e8me Livre d\u2019Orgue of Nivers. Commentators have suggested how the musical form echos the themes of the hymn\u2014the cantus firmus reflecting the mystery of the incarnation, Christ hidden in Mary's womb, and its chromaticism the purity of the virgin. The widely spaced polyphonic texture has been taken as a musical depiction of Sedulius' poetic lines A solis ortus cardine, ad usque terr\u00e6 limitem\u2014\"From the hinge of the rising sun, To the farthest edge of the earth\". For the opening motivic accompaniment \"entwines the chorale melody in a consummately effective way and embraces a whole world of unutterable joy\", the adagio is a \"mystical contemplation\", and the motifs \"a joyous exaltation in the soprano\". * BWV 612 Wir Christenleut [We Christians] \u2022 play MP3 Adoration of the Magi, early 16C stained glass from Steinfeld Abbey 500px Below are the first and third verses of the hymn of Caspar Fuger with the English translation of Catherine Winkworth first published in 1592 with the melody, which predates it. {| |- | ::Wir Christenleut ::haben jetzund Freud, ::weil uns zu Trost Christus ist Mensch geboren, ::hat uns erl\u00f6st. ::Wer sich des tr\u00f6st', ::und glaubet fest, soll nicht werden verloren. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Die S\u00fcnd macht Leid; ::Christus bringt Freud, ::weil er zu uns in diese Welt ist kommen. ::Mit uns ist Gott ::in dieser Not: ::Wer ist, der jetzt uns Christen kann verdammen? | ::We Christians may ::Rejoice to-day, ::When Christ was born to comfort and to save us; ::Who thus believes ::No longer grieves, ::For none are lost who grasp the hope He gave us. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Sin brought us grief. ::But Christ relief, ::When down to earth He came for our salvation; ::Since God with us ::Is dwelling thus. ::Who dares to speak the Christian's condemnation? | |} Wir Christenleut in the second edition of the Lutheran Hymnbook of Johann Hermann Schein, 1645 Autograph manuscript of BWV 612, with final bars entered at bottom of the page in organ tablature (also added on 2 clefs by unknown scribe at end of MS). The hymn was previously set as the chorale prelude BWV 710 in the Kirnberger Collection; and it also appears as BWV 1090 in the Neumeister Collection. The autograph manuscript of Orgelb\u00fcchlein contains the original composing score for BWV 612. As with the most of the collection, Bach had allotted one page for the chorale prelude. Due to lack of space, he entered the final two and a half bars in more compact tablature notation. The dots indicating the second half could be repeated\u2014an unusual feature in Orgelb\u00fcchlein\u2014first appeared in print in the 1983 Neue Bach-Gesellschaft edition of Heinz-Harald L\u00f6hlein. BWV 612 is written for single manual and pedal with four voices. The plain cantus firmus is in the soprano part. The accompaniment\u2014striding quavers in the pedal like an ostinato bass and dance-like semiquavers in the inner parts\u2014s formed from two short motifs. Both motifs are related as can be seen when they are first heard together in the alto and bass parts in the last two beats of bar 1 and first beats of bar 2: separated by an octave plus a third, the bass motif (a rest followed by six notes) can be seen as a simplified form of the alto motif (a rest followed by two five-note figures). At the same time the motif in the inner parts is derived from descending scale D, C, B-flat, A that recurs in the cantus. Both accompanying motifs serve to propel the chorale prelude forwards, the bass line having a similar function to that in the last movement of the fourth Brandenburg concerto. Although the cantus itself repeats more of its lines than most Lutheran hymns, Bach avoids repetitiveness in the chorale prelude by varying the harmonies and rhythmic texture in the accompaniment for each phrase. In addition what sounds like an interlude for alto and tenor during a two and a half bar rest in the pedal part creates further variety. The resolute striding bass has been seen by as representing firmness in faith, a reference to the last two lines of the first verse Wer sich des tr\u00f6st', und glaubet fest, soll nicht werden verloren: \"whosoever trusts in Him and firmly believes shall not be lost.\" The same type of bass line was used much later by Bach in the chorale prelude Wir glauben all an einen Gott\u201d, BWV 664 in Clavier-\u00dcbung III.

The hymn tune is on the first line of the first page and the first three lines of the second. Autograph manuscript of Das alte Jahre vergangen ist, BWV 614 Customarily sung on New Year's Day, the hymn addresses thanks for the past year and prayers for the coming year to Christ. Although primarily a supplication looking forwards to the future, the hymn also looks back at the past, reflecting on the perils facing man, his sins and his transitory existence. The version of the hymn that Bach used for BWV 614 only emerged gradually. The first two verses of the hymn text were first published in Clemens Stephani's Nuremberg hymnbook of 1568; the entire six verses of the text appeared in Johann Steuerlein's Erfurt hymnbook of 1588. An early version of the melody also appeared in Steuerlein's hymnbook, but set to different words (Gott Vater, der du deine Sonn). That melody first appeared with the text in Erhard Bodenschatz's Leipzig hymnbook of 1608. One of the earliest known sources for the version of the hymn used by Bach is Gottfried Vopelius's Leipzig hymnbook of 1682. Prior to modern scientific methods for dating Bach's autograph manuscripts, scholars had relied on identifying hymnbooks available to him to determine exactly when Orgelb\u00fcchlein was written. erroneously assigned a date after 1715, because the earliest source for Das alte Jahr he had been able to locate was Christian Friedrich Witt's Gotha hymnbook, first published in 1715. As is now known, Bach set Das alte Jahr early in his career as BWV 1091, one of the chorale preludes in the Neumeister Collection; he also composed two four-part harmonisations, BWV 288 and 289. The chorale prelude BWV 614 is written for two manuals and pedal with the cantus firmus in the soprano voice. Despite starting starkly with two repeated crotchets\u2014unaccompanied and unembellished\u2014in the cantus, BWV 614 is an ornamental chorale prelude: the highly expressive melodic line, although restrained, includes elaborate ornamentation, coloratura melismas (reminiscent of Bach's Arnstadt chorale preludes) and \"sighing\" falling notes, which at the close completely subsume the melody as they rise and fall in the final cadence. The accompaniment is built from the motif of a rising chromatic fourth heard first in the response to the first two notes of the cantus. The motif is in turn linked to the melodic line, which later on in bar 5 is decorated with a rising chromatic fourth. Bach ingeniously develops the accompaniment using the motif in canon, inversion and semiquaver stretto. The three lower voices respond to each other and to the melodic line, with the soprano and alto voices sighing in parallel sixths at the close. The chromatic fourth was a common form of the baroque passus duriusculus, mentioned in the seventeenth century musical treatise of Christoph Bernhard, a student of Heinrich Sch\u00fctz. The chromaticism creates ambiguities of key throughout the chorale prelude. The original hymn melody is in the aeolian mode of A (the natural form of A minor) modulating to E major in the final cadence. analyses the mysteries of the key structure in BWV 614. In addition to giving a detailed Schenkerian analysis, he notes that the cadences pass between D minor and A until the final cadence to E major; that the modal structure moves between the Dorian mode on D and the Phrygian mode on E through the intermediary of their common reciting note A; and that the key changes are mediated by the chromatic fourths in the accompaniment. Since the nineteenth century successive commentators have found the mood of the chorale prelude to be predominantly sad, despite that not being in keeping with the hymn text. The chromatic fourth has been interpreted as a \"grief motif\". It has been described as \"melancholic\" by ; as having \"the greatest intensity\" by ; as a \"prayer\" with \"anxiety for the future\" by Ernst Arfken; and as a crossroads between \"the past and the future\" by Jacques Chailley. suggests that the grieving mood might possibly reflect tragic events in Bach's life at the time of composition; indeed in 1713 his first wife gave birth to twins who died within a month of being born. takes a different approach, suggesting that Bach's choice of tonal structure leads the listener to expect the E's that end the chorale prelude to be answered by A's, the notes that start it. To Renwick such \"cyclicity\" reflects the themes of the hymn: \"a turning point; a Janus- like reflection backward and forward; regret for the past and hope for the future; the place between before and after.\" *BWV 615 In dir ist Freude [In you is joy] \u2022 play MP3 St Christopher with the Christ Child, early 15C Book of Hours, Ghent 500px Below is the first verse of this hymn of Johann Lindemann with the English translation by Catherine Winkworth. {| |- | ::In dir ist Freude ::in allem Leide, ::o du s\u00fc\u00dfer Jesu Christ! ::Durch dich wir haben ::himmlische Gaben, ::du der wahre Heiland bist; ::hilfest von Schanden, ::rettest von Banden. ::Wer dir vertrauet, ::hat wohl gebauet, ::wird ewig bleiben.

In the generation prior to Bach, organ settings had mainly been made by composers in Southern Germany like Kindermann, Pachelbel and Fischer. Unlike most of the other chorale preludes in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein, Bach did not use the chorale in any of his cantatas\u2014BWV 621 is his unique setting of the hymn. BWV 621 is scored for single manual and pedal, with the cantus firmus in the soprano voice almost entirely in plain crotchets. The accompaniment below the cantus creates an unusually dense texture. There are three accompanying voices, often closely scored: the alto and tenor voices in the keyboard between them weave a continuous and complex pattern of rising and falling semiquavers, sometimes in parallel thirds; and below them the bass voice in the pedal moves in steady quavers and syncopated crotchets. The accompaniment in each lower voice is constructed from its own separate motifs, each having its own characteristic rhythm. Although the longer figures in the two lowest voices are heard several times throughout the piece, Bach's ingenious writing gives no sense of artifice or mechanical repetition. In addition, as notes, the outer and inner voices are naturally paired: the pedal with\u2014or in opposition to\u2014the cantus; and the alto voice with the tenor. The pedal starts off with a cross motif in quavers, which recurs throughout the composition. The cross motifs are followed by suspended crochets, falling in steps. These create constant dissonances with the cantus which are resolved only by the cadence at the close. The syncopated crotchets in the pedal also interrupt the fermatas at the end of each cantus line, giving a further sense of restlessness. The alto part is characterised by falling anapaests; while the tenor line is made up of two parts, the first a rising semiquaver figure and the second shorter semiquaver cross motifs descending in sequence. As the piece progresses the motifs become more concentrated, with the alto taking up some of the tenor motifs towards the close. These novel features mark a departure from the more standard settings of the hymn by Bach's predecessors such as Fischer which conform more closely to the stile antico. Many commentators have interpreted the compositional form and motifs of BWV 621 in terms of the themes of the Passiontide hymn, primarily concerned with the crucifixion. wrote that Christ's hanging on the cross \"is represented by the heavy, syncopated notes\" and takes this as \"evidence of a wonderfully true aesthetic feeling\" [in Bach], since \"that enforced quietude of direst anguish was no real calm.\" Similarly for , the pedal line symbolises \"the drooping of the exhausted body of Jesus on the cross.\" describes the dissonant suspensions as fitting for \"the tragic subject matter.\" For the syncopated bass line is a \"masterful\" way of evoking the dragging of the cross. Similar motifs and handling of voices occur at the close of Von Himmel hoch, da komm ich her, BWV 606: although that Christmas hymn primarily concerns the incarnation of Christ, later parts of the text foreshadow the crucifixion. * BWV 622 O Mensch, bewein dein S\u00fcnde gro\u00df [Oh Man, bewail your great sins] a 2 Clav. et Ped. \u2022 play MP3 Autograph score of BWV 622, O Mensch, bewein dein S\u00fcnde gro\u00df Twelve scenes from the life of Christ, 15C painting from Cologne 500px Below is the text of the first stanza of the hymn O Mensch, bewein dein S\u00fcnde gro\u00df by Sebald Heyden with the English translation of Catherine Winkworth. {| |- | ::O Mensch, bewein dein S\u00fcnde gross, ::darum Christus seins Vaters Schoss ::verliess und kam auf Erden. ::Von einer Jungfrau rein und zart ::f\u00fcr uns er hier geboren war: ::er wollt der Mittler werden. ::Den Toten er das Leben gab, ::und legt dabei all Krankheit ab! ::Bis sich die Zeit herdrange ::da\u00df er f\u00fcr uns geopfert w\u00fcrd ::trug unser S\u00fcnd ein schwere B\u00fcrd ::wohl an dem Kreuze lange. | ::O man, thy grievous sin bemoan, ::For which Christ left His Father's throne, ::From highest heaven descending. ::Of Virgin pure and undefiled ::He here was born, our Saviour mild, ::For sin to make atonement. ::The dead He raised to life again. ::The sick He freed from grief and pain. ::Until the time appointed ::That He for us should give His Blood, ::Should bear our sins' o'erwhelming load, ::The shameful Cross enduring. | |} \"O Mensch\" is one of the most celebrated of Bach's chorale preludes. The cantus firmus, composed in 1525 by Matthias Greitter and associated with Whitsuntide, was also later used with the same words for the closing chorale of the first part of the St Matthew Passion, taken from the 1725 version of the St John Passion. Bach ornamented the simple melody, in twelve phrases reflecting the twelve lines of the opening verse, with an elaborate coloratura. It recalls but also goes beyond the ornamental chorale preludes of Buxtehude. The ornamentation, although employing conventional musical figures, is highly original and inventive. While the melody in the upper voice is hidden by coloratura over a wide range, the two inner voices are simple and imitative above the continuo-style bass. Bach varies the texture and colouring of the accompaniment for each line of what is one of the longest melodies in the collection. 500px In the penultimate line, accompanying the words \"ein schwere B\u00fcrd\" (a heavy burden), the inner parts intensify moving in semiquavers (16th notes) with the upper voice to a climax on the highest note in the prelude. The closing phrase, with its mounting chromatic bass accompanying bare unadorned crotchets (quarter notes) in the melody to end in an unexpected modulation to C\u266d major, recall but again go beyond earlier compositions of Pachelbel, Frohberger and Buxtehude. It has been taken by some commentators as a musical allusion to the words kreuze lange in the text: for Spitta the passage was \"full of imagination and powerful feeling.\" As comments, however, the inner voices, \"with their astonishing accented passing-notes transcend images, as does the sudden simplicity of the melody when the bass twice rises chromatically.\" * BWV 623 Wir danken dir, Herr Jesu Christ [We give thanks to you, Lord Jesus Christ] \u2022 play MP3 Man of Sorrows, early 16C stained glass from Steinfeld Abbey 500px Below is the German text of the 1568 Lutheran hymn by the Bohemian theologian Christoph Fischer, with the English translation of Benjamin Hall Kennedy. {| |- | ::Wir danken dir, Herr Jesu Christ, ::da\u00df du f\u00fcr uns gestorben bist ::und hast uns durch dein teures Blut ::gemacht vor Gott gerecht und gut, ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Und bitten dich, wahr'r Mensch und Gott, ::durch dein' heilig' f\u00fcnf Wunden rot, ::erl\u00f6s' uns von dem ew'gen Tod ::und tr\u00f6st uns in der letzten Not! ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Neh\u00fct uns auch vor S\u00fcnd' und Schand', ::reich uns dein' allm\u00e4chtige Hand, ::da\u00df wir im Kreuz geduldig sei'n ::uns tr\u00f6sten deiner schweren Pein ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Und draus sch\u00f6pfen die Zuversicht, ::da\u00df du uns werd'st verla\u00dfen nicht, ::sondern ganz treulich bei uns stehn, ::bis wir durchs Kreuz ins Leben gehn. | ::We bless Thee, Jesus Christ our Lord; ::For ever be Thy name adored: ::For Thou, the sinless One, hast died ::That sinners might be justified. ::\u2218\u2218 ::O very Man, and very God, ::Redeem us with Thy precious blood; ::From death eternal set us free, ::And make us one with God in Thee. ::\u2218\u2218 ::From sin and shame defend us still. ::And work in us Thy stedfast will, ::The Cross with patience to sustain, ::And bravely bear its utmost pain. ::\u2218\u2218 ::In Thee we trust, in Thee alone; ::For Thou forsakest not Thine own: ::To all the meek Thy strength is given, ::Who by Thy Cross ascend to heaven. | |} * BWV 624 Hilf, Gott, da\u00df mir's gelinge [Help me, God, that I may succeed] a 2 Clav. et Ped. \u2022 play MP3 The Transfiguration, early 16C stained glass from Mariawald Abbey near Cologne 500px Below is the text of the hymn from the Ballad of the Passion (1527) by Heinrich M\u00fcller The initial letters of the thirteen verses spell Heinrich M\u00fcler with a 16th-century translation from The Gude and Godlie Ballatis. {| |- | ::Hilf, Gott, da\u00df mirs gelinge, ::du edler Sch\u00f6pfer mein, ::die Silben reimweis zwinge ::Lob und Ehren dein, ::da\u00df ich mag fr\u00f6hlich heben an, ::von deinem Wort zu singen. ::Herr, du wollst mir beistan. | ::Help, God, the formar of all thing. ::That to Thy gloir may be my dyte; ::Be baith at end and beginning, ::That I may mak ane sang perfyte ::Of Jesus Christis Passioun, ::Sinnaris onlie Saluatioun, ::As witnes is Thy word in write. | |} 16C hymn of Heinrich M\u00fcller in 1662 Frankfurt version of Lutheran hymnbook Praxis Pietatis Melica of Johann Cr\u00fcger ===Easter BWV 625\u2013630=== * BWV 625 Christ lag in Todesbanden [Christ lay in the bonds of death] \u2022 play MP3 Entombment of Christ, early 16C painting from Cologne 500px Below are the first and fourth verses of Martin Luther's Easter hymn Christ lag in Todesbanden with the English translation of Paul England.

The sharp on the second note was a more modern departure, already adopted by the composer-organists Bruhns, B\u00f6hm and Scheidt and by Bach himself in his early cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4. The chorale prelude is in four parts for single manual and pedals, with the cantus firmus in the soprano voice. It closely follows the four voices of Bach's earlier harmonisation in the four-part chorale BWV 278, with virtually no changes in the cantus firmus. The two accompanying inner parts and pedal are elaborated by a single motif of four or eight semiquavers descending in steps. It is derived from the final descending notes of the melody: :::300px The semiquaver motif runs continuously throughout the piece, passing from one lower voice to another. Commentators have given different interpretations of what the motif might symbolise: for it was \"the bonds of death\" (Todesbanden) and for Hermann Keller \"the rolling away of the stone\". Some have also seen the suspensions between bars as representing \"the bonds of death\". These interpretations can depend on the presumed tempo of the chorale prelude. A very slow tempo was adopted by the school of late nineteenth and early twentieth century French organists, such as Guilmant and Dupr\u00e9: for them the mood of the chorale prelude was quiet, inward-looking and mournful; Dupr\u00e9 even saw in the descending semiquavers \"the descent by the holy women, step by step, to the tomb\". At a faster tempo, as has become more common, the mood becomes more exultant and vigorous, with a climax at the words Gott loben und dankbar sein (\"praise our God right heartily\"), where the music becomes increasingly chromatic. suggests that the motif might then resemble the Gewalt (\"power\") motif in the cello part of BWV 4, verse 3; and that the turmoil created by the rapidly changing harmonies in some bars might echo the word Krieg (\"war\") in verse 4. * BWV 626 Jesus Christus, unser Heiland, der den Tod \u00fcberwand [Jesus Christ, our Saviour, who conquered death] \u2022 play MP3 Resurrection, Wildungen Altarpiece, Konrad von Soest 500px Below is the first verse of Martin Luther's Easter hymn Jesus Christus, unser Heiland, der den Tod \u00fcberwand with the English translation by George MacDonald. {| |- | ::Jesus Christus unser Heiland, ::der den Tod \u00fcberwand, ::ist auferstanden, ::die S\u00fcnd' hat er gefangen. ::Kyrie eleison!

Johann Gottfried Walther, Bach's distant cousin and the organist in the Stadtkirche in Weimar, also set the hymn as a chorale prelude and as a partita with many variations. BWV 632 is written for single keyboard and pedal with the cantus firmus in the soprano part: it starts with a characteristic triad, at first concealed by the intermediate notes of the legato dotted rhythm. The same suspirans triad motif, like a broken chord or arpeggio, forms the basis of the accompaniment in the two inner voices: the imitative responses between the parts providing a steady flow of semiquaver figures, rising and falling, melifluous and sweet. More than a simple accompaniment, the push the harmonies forward, revealing it unexpectedly at every turn. Below them the pedal bass provides a distinctive accompaniment in quavers and crotchets, starting off with a quaver triad. Although largely moving in steps, like a walking bass, the pedal plays a type of canon two octaves below the cantus. The canon is itself disguised, in crotchets in the first half with the same rhythm as the soprano; but in the second half it is heard in fragmentary form at double the speed in quavers. The accompanying arpeggio motifs in the inner parts are not dissimilar to figurations in settings of the hymn by Georg B\u00f6hm and Walther (the 6th variation in his partita). But the light and airy texture of the keyboard writing has more in common with the harpsichord allemande, such as BuxWV 238/1 below, from the thirteenth keyboard suite of Dieterich Buxtehude: the introductory upbeat; the repeats of binary dance form; and the arpeggiated accompaniment at the cadences. 900px The reprise of the second part differs from the hymn as it appears in hymnbooks; but the stream of repeated triadic motifs\u2014which interpreted as constant repetitions of Herr Jesu Christ\u2014add to the mood of supplication in the chorale prelude. Hermann Keller has suggested that Bach might have employed the canon as musical iconography for the plea to be \"led\" at the end of the first verse: und uns den Weg zu Wahrheit f\u00fchr (\"and lead us on the path of truth\"). * BWV 633 Liebster Jesu, wir sind hier (distinctius) [Dearest Jesus, we are here] in Canone alla Quinta, a 2 Clav. et Ped. \u2022 play MP3 Supper at Emmaus, early 16C German stained glass 500px * BWV 634 Liebster Jesu, wir sind hier [Dearest Jesus, we are here] in Canone alla Quinta, a 2 Clav. et Ped. 500px Below is the first verse of Tobias Clausnitzer's Lutheran hymn Liebster Jesu, wir sind hier with the English translation of Catherine Winkworth. {| |- | ::Liebster Jesu, wir sind hier, ::dich und dein Wort anzuh\u00f6ren; ::lenke Sinnen und Begier ::auf die s\u00fc\u00dfen Himmelslehren, ::da\u00df die Herzen von der Erden ::ganz zu dir gezogen werden. | ::Blessed Jesu, at Thy word ::We are gathered all to hear Thee; ::Let our hearts and souls be stirred ::Now to seek and love and fear Thee, ::By Thy teachings sweet and holy ::Draw from earth to love Thee solely. | |} ===Catechism hymns BWV 635\u2013638=== * BWV 635 Dies sind die heil'gen zehn Gebot [These are the ten commandments] \u2022 play MP3 Albrecht D\u00fcrer: Moses receiving the Ten Commandments, stained glass panel, Jakobskirche, Straubing 500px Below are the first and last two verses of the Lutheran catechism hymn Dies sind die heil'gen zehn Gebot (the Ten Commandments) with an English translation by George MacDonald. {| |- | ::Dies sind die heil'gen Zehn Gebot', ::die uns gab unser Herre Gott ::durch Moses, seinen Diener treu, ::hoch auf dem Berg Sinai. ::Kyrieleis! ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Die Gebot all' uns geben sind, ::da\u00df du dein' S\u00fcnd', o Menschenkind, ::erkennen sollst und lernen wohl, ::wie man vor Gott leben soll. ::Kyrieleis! ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Das helf' uns der Herr Jesus Christ, ::der unser Mittler worden ist; ::es ist mit unserm Tun verlor'n, ::verdienen doch eitel Zorn. ::Kyrieleis! | ::These are the holy ten commands, ::Which came to us from God's own hands, ::By Moses, who obeyed His will, ::On the top of Sinai's hill. ::Kyrioleis. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::To us come these commands, that so ::Thou, son of man, thy sins mayst know. ::And with this lesson thy heart fill, ::That man must live for God's will. ::Kyrioleis. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::May Christ our Lord help us in this, ::For He our mediator is; ::Our own work is a hopeless thing, ::Wrath alone all it can bring. ::Kyrioleis. | |} hymnbook of Luther and Walter The Lutheran Erfurter Enchiridion of 1524 contains the text with the melody, which was also used for In Gottes Nahmen fahren wir, a pilgrims' hymn. Bach wrote a four-part chorale on the hymn tune in BWV 298; he used it for the trumpet canon in the opening chorus of cantata BWV 77; and much later he set it for organ in the first two of the catechism chorale preludes, BWV 678 and 679, of Clavier-\u00dcbung III. The chorale prelude BWV 635 is in the mixolydian mode with the cantus firmus in the soprano voice in simple minims. The accompaniment in the three lower voices is built up from two motifs each containing the repeated notes that characterise the theme. The first motif in quavers is a contracted version of the first line of the cantus (GGGGGGABC), first heard in the pedal bass in bars 1 and 2. It also occurs in inverted form. This emphatic hammering motif is passed imitatively between the lower voices as a form of canon. The second motif, first heard in the alto part in bars 2 and 3, is made up of five groups of 4 semiquavers, individual groups being related by inversion (first and fifth) and reflection (second and third). The pivotal notes CCCDEF in this motif are also derived from the theme. The second motif is passed from voice to voice in the accompaniment\u2014there are two passages where it is adapted to the pedal with widely spaced semiquavers alternating between the feet\u2014providing an unbroken stream of semiquavers complementing the first motif. The combined affekt of the four parts, with 25 repetitions of the quaver motif, is one of \"confirming\" the biblical laws chanted in the verses of the hymn. There is likewise a reference to \"law\" in the canon of the quaver motif. For the motif had \"an inherent organic connection with the chorale itself.\" Some commentators, aware that the number \"ten\" of the Ten Commandments has been detected in the two chorale preludes of Clavier-\u00dcbung III, have endeavoured to find a hidden numerology in BWV 635. The attempts of have been criticised: Harvey Grace felt that Bach was \"expressing the idea of insistence, order, dogma\u2014anything but statistics.\" points out, however, that if there is any intentional numerology, it might be in the occurrences of the strict form of the motif, with tone and semitone intervals matching the first entry: it occurs precisely ten times in the chorale prelude (b1 \u2013 bass; b1 \u2013 tenor; b2 \u2013 bass; b4 \u2013 bass; b9 \u2013 tenor; b10 \u2013 bass; b11 \u2013 tenor; b13 \u2013 tenor; b15 \u2013 alto; b18 \u2013 tenor). * BWV 636 Vater unser im Himmelreich [Our Father who art in Heaven] \u2022 play MP3 Hans Brosamer, 1550: woodcut in Luther's Small Catechism of Christ teaching His disciples the Lord's Prayer 500px Below are the first and last verses of the Lutheran version of the Lord's Prayer with the English translation of George MacDonald. {| |- | ::Vater unser im Himmelreich, ::der du uns alle hei\u00dfest gleich ::Br\u00fcder sein und dich rufen an ::und willst das Beten von uns hab'n, ::gib, da\u00df nicht bet' allein der Mund, ::hilf, da\u00df es geh' von Herzensgrund! ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Amen, das ist, es werde wahr! ::st\u00e4rk unsern Glauben immerdar, ::auf da\u00df wir ja nicht zweifeln dran, ::was wir hiermit gebeten hab'n ::auf dein Wort in dem Namen dein; ::so sprechen wir das Amen fein. | ::Our Father in the heaven Who art, ::Who tellest all of us in heart ::Brothers to be, and on Thee call, ::And wilt have prayer from us all, ::Grant that the mouth not only pray, ::From deepest heart oh help its way. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Amen, that is, let this come true! ::Strengthen our faith ever anew, ::That we may never be in doubt ::Of that we here have prayed about. ::In Thy name, trusting in Thy word. ::We say a soft Amen, O Lord. | |} Following the publication of the text and melody in 1539, the hymn was used in many choral and organ compositions. Amongst Bach's immediate predecessors, Dieterich Buxtehude wrote two settings of the hymn for organ\u2014a freely composed chorale prelude in three verses (BuxWV 207) and a chorale prelude for two manuals and pedal (BuxWV 219); and Georg B\u00f6hm composed a partita and two chorale preludes (previously misattributed to Bach as BWV 760 and 761). Bach himself harmonised the hymn in BWV 416, with a later variant in one of the chorales from the St John Passion. He used it in cantatas BWV 90, 100 and 102 with a different text. Amongst the early organ compositions on Vater unser attributed to Bach, only the chorale prelude BWV 737 has been ascribed with any certainty. After Orgelb\u00fcchlein, Bach returned to the hymn with a pair of chorale preludes (BWV 682 and 683) in Clavier-\u00dcbung III. In the chorale prelude BWV 636 the plain cantus firmus is in the soprano voice. The accompaniment in the inner parts and pedal is based on a four-note semiquaver suspirans motif (i.e. preceded by a rest or \"breath\") and a longer eight-note version; both are derived from the first phrase of the melody. In turn Bach's slight alteration of the melody in bars 1 and 3 might have been dictated by his choice of motif. The two forms of the motif and their inversions pass from one lower voice to another, producing a continuous stream of semiquavers; semiquavers in one voice are accompanied by quavers in the other two. The combined effect is of the harmonisation of a chorale by arpeggiated chords. Hermann Keller even suggested that Bach might have composed the chorale prelude starting from an earlier harmonisation; as points out, however, although the harmonic structure adheres to that of a four-part chorale, the pattern of semiquavers and suspended notes is different for each bar and always enhances the melody, sometimes in unexpected ways. described the accompanying motifs as representing \"peace of mind\"(qui\u00e9tude). * BWV 637 Durch Adams Fall ist ganz verderbt [Through Adam's fall are wholly ruined] \u2022 play MP3 Marriage, Temptation and Fall of Adam, sixteenth century stained glass from Steinfeld Abbey 500px Below are the first and seventh verses of the hymn written in 1524 by Lazarus Spengler with an English translation by John Christian Jacobi. {| |- | ::Durch Adams Fall ist ganz verderbt ::menschlich Natur und Wesen, ::dasselb Gift ist auf uns errebt, ::da\u00df wir nicht mocht'n genesen ::ohn' Gottes Trost, der uns erl\u00f6st ::hat von dem gro\u00dfen Schaden, ::darein die Schlang Eva bezwang, ::Gotts Zorn auf sich zu laden. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Wer hofft in Gott und dem vertraut, ::wird nimmermehr zu Schanden; ::denn wer auf diesen Felsen baut, ::ob ihm gleich geht zuhanden ::wie Unfalls hie, hab ich doch nie ::den Menschen sehen fallen, ::der sich verl\u00e4\u00dft auf Gottes Trost, ::er hilft sein Gl\u00e4ub'gen allen. | ::When Adam fell, the frame entire ::Of nature was infected; ::The source, whence came the poison dire, ::Was not to be corrected: ::The lust accursed, indulged at first, ::Brought death as its production; ::But God's free grace hath saved our race ::From misery and destruction. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::But, who makes God his Hope and trust, ::Shall never be confounded: ::No Cleaver to this Rock is lost, ::Thou' ev'ry where surrounded ::With daring foes and trying woes; ::His Faith yet stands unshaken. ::Who loves the Lord shall by no sword ::Or woe be overtaken. | |} Durch Adams Fall in Luther's Geistliche Lieder, Wittenberg 1535 The penitential text, written in the Nuremberg of Hans Sachs and the Meistersingers where Spengler was town clerk, is concerned with \"human misery and ruin,\" faith and redemption; it encapsulates some of the central tenets of the Lutheran Reformation. The melody, originally for a Reformation battle hymn of 1525, was first published with Spengler's text in 1535. Bach previously set it as a chorale prelude in the Kirnberger Collection (BWV 705) and Neumeister Collection (BWV 1101); the seventh verse also recurs in the closing chorales of cantatas BWV 18 and BWV 109. Dieterich Buxtehude had already set the hymn as a chorale prelude (BuxWV 183) prior to Bach. The chorale prelude BWV 637 is one of the most original and imaginative in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein, with a wealth of motifs in the accompaniment. Scored for single manual and pedal, the unadorned cantus firmus is in the soprano voice. Beneath the melody in a combination of four different motifs, the inner parts wind sinuously in an uninterrupted line of semiquavers, moving chromatically in steps. Below them the pedal responds to the melodic line with downward leaps in diminished, major and minor sevenths, punctuated by rests. Bach's ingenious writing is constantly varying. The expressive mood is heightened by the fleeting modulations between minor and major keys; and by the dissonances between the melody and the chromatic inner parts and pedal. The abrupt leaps in the pedal part create unexpected changes in key; and halfway through the chorale prelude the tangled inner parts are inverted to produce an even stranger harmonic texture, resolved only in the final bars by the modulation into a major key. The chorale prelude has generated numerous interpretations of its musical imagery, its relation to the text and to baroque affekt. records that the dissonances might symbolise original sin, the downward leaps in the pedal the fall of Adam, and the modulations at the close hope and redemption; the rests in the pedal part could be examples of the affekt that the seventeenth century philosopher Athanasius Kircher called \"a sighing of the spirit.\" points out that the diminished seventh interval used in the pedal part was customarily associated with \"grief.\" The twisting inner parts have been interpreted as illustrating the words verderbt (\"ruined\") by Hermann Keller and Schlang (\"serpent\") by Jacques Chailley. described the pedal part as \"a series of almost irremediable stumbles\"; in contrast Ernst Arfken saw the uninterrupted cantus firmus as representing constancy in faith. For Wolfgang Budday, Bach's departure from normal compositional convention was itself intended to symbolise the \"corruption\" and \"depravity\" of man. also preferred to view Bach's chorale prelude as representing the complete text of the hymn instead of individual words, distinguishing it from Buxtehude's earlier precedent. Considered to be amongst his most expressive compositions\u2014 describes it as \"imbued with sorrow\"\u2014Buxtehude's setting employs explicit word-painting. * BWV 638 Es ist das Heil uns kommen her [Salvation has come to us] \u2022 play MP3 \"Es ist das Heil uns kommen her\" in the Erfurt Enchiridion, 1524 500px The first verse of the Lutheran hymn Es ist das Heil uns kommen her of Paul Speratus is given below with the English translation of John Christian Jacobi. {| |- | ::Es ist das Heil uns kommen her ::von Gnad' und lauter G\u00fcte, ::die Werke helfen nimmermehr, ::sie m\u00f6gen nicht beh\u00fcten, ::der Glaub' sieht Jesus Christus an ::der hat g'nug f\u00fcr uns all' getan, ::er ist der Mittler worden. | ::Our whole salvation doth depend ::On God's free grace and Spirit; ::Our fairest works can ne'er defend ::A boast in our own merit: ::Derived is all our righteousness ::From Christ and His atoning grace; ::He is our Mediator. | |} The text treats a central Lutheran theme\u2014only faith in God is required for redemption. The melody is from an Easter hymn. Many composers had written organ settings prior to Bach, including Sweelinck, Scheidt and Buxtehude (his chorale prelude BuxWV 186). After Orgelb\u00fcchlein, Bach set the entire hymn in cantata Es ist das Heil uns kommen her, BWV 9; and composed chorales on single verses for cantatas 86, 117, 155 and 186. In the chorale prelude BWV 638 for single manual and pedal, the cantus firmus is in the soprano voice in simple crotchets. The accompaniment in the inner voices is built on a four-note motif\u2014derived from the hymn tune\u2014a descending semiquaver scale, starting with a rest or \"breath\" (suspirans): together they provide a constant stream of semiquavers, sometimes in parallel sixths, running throughout the piece until the final cadence. Below them the pedal is a walking bass in quavers, built on the inverted motif and octave leaps, pausing only to mark the cadences at the end of each line of the hymn. The combination of the four parts conveys a joyous mood, similar to that of BWV 606 and 609. For Hermann Keller, the running quavers and semiquavers \"suffuse the setting with health and strength.\" and speculate that this chorale prelude and the preceding BWV 637, written on opposite sides of the same manuscript paper, might have been intended as a pair of contrasting catechism settings, one about sin, the other about salvation. Both have similar rhythmic structures in the parts, but one is in a minor key with complex chromatic harmonies, the other in a major key with firmly diatonic harmonies. ===Miscellaneous BWV 639\u2013644=== Autograph manuscript of Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV 639 * BWV 639 Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ [I call to you, Lord Jesus Christ] a 2 Clav. et Ped. \u2022 play MP3 500px Below is the first verse of Johann Agricola's hymn with the English translation of John Christian Jacobi. {| |- | ::Ich ruf zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, ::ich bitt, erh\u00f6r mein Klagen; ::verleih mir Gnad zu dieser Frist, ::la\u00df mich doch nicht verzagen. ::Den rechten Glauben, Herr, ich mein, ::den wollest du mir geben, ::dir zu leben, ::meim N\u00e4chsten n\u00fctz zu sein, ::dein Wort zu halten eben. | ::Lord, hear the voice of my complaint, ::To Thee I now commend me, ::Let not my heart and hope grow faint, ::But deign Thy grace to send me. ::True faith from Thee, my God, I seek, ::The faith that loves Thee solely. ::Keeps me lowly, ::And prompt to aid the weak, ::And mark each word that Thou dost speak. | |} \"Ich ruf zu dir\" is amongst the most popular chorale preludes in the collection. Pure in style, this ornamental chorale prelude has been described as \"a supplication in time of despair.\" Written in the meantone key of F minor, it is the unique prelude in trio form with voices in the two manuals and the pedal. It is possible that the unusual choice of key followed Bach's experience playing the new organ at Halle which employed more modern tuning. The ornamented melody in crotchets (quarter notes) sings in the soprano above a flowing legato semiquaver (16th note) accompaniment and gently pulsating repeated quavers (eighth notes) in the pedal continuo. Such viol-like semiquaver figures in the middle voice already appeared as \"imitatio violistica\" in the Tabalutara nova (1624) of Samuel Scheidt. The instrumental combination itself was used elsewhere by Bach: in the third movement of the cantata Schm\u00fccke dich, o liebe Seele, BWV 180 for soprano, violoncello piccolo and continuo; and the 19th movement of the St John Passion, with the middle voice provided by semiquaver arpeggios on the lute. A close variant of BWV 639 is catalogued as BWV Anh. 73, an expanded arrangement for organ, attributed to the composer's son C.P.E. Bach. * BWV 640 In dich hab ich gehoffet, Herr [In you have I put my hope, Lord] \u2022 play MP3 Raising of Lazarus, early 16C stained glass from Mariawald Abbey near Cologne 500px Below is the first verse of the Lutheran hymn In dich hab ich gehoffet, Herr of Adam Reissner with the English translation of Catherine Winkworth. {| |- | ::In dich hab' ich gehoffet, Herr, ::hilf, da\u00df ich nicht zuschanden werd' ::noch ewiglich zu Spotte! ::Das bitt' ich dich, ::erhalte mich ::in deiner Treu', mein Gotte! | ::In Thee, Lord, have I put my trust, ::Leave me not helpless in the dust, ::Let not my hope be brought to shame, ::But still sustain, ::Through want and pain. ::My faith that Thou art aye the same. | |} Melody and text of hymn from Das Gros Kirchen Gesangbuch, Strasbourg 1560 The text of the hymn is derived from the first six lines of Psalm 31 and was associated with two different melodies, in major and minor keys. The hymn tune in the major key was used many times by Bach, most notably in the funeral cantata BWV 106, the Christmas Oratorio and the St. Matthew Passion. BWV 640 is the only occasion he used the melody in the minor key, which can be traced back to an earlier reformation hymn tune for Christ ist erstanden and medieval plainsong for Christus iam resurrexit. In Bach's chorale prelude BWV 640, the cantus firmus is in the soprano voice, several times held back for effect. Beneath it the two inner voices\u2014often in thirds\u2014and the pedal provide an accompaniment based on a motif derived from the melody, a falling three-note anapaest consisting of two semiquavers and a quaver. The motif is passed imitatively down through the voices, often developing into more flowing passages of semiquavers; the motif in the pedal has an added quaver and\u2014punctuated by rests\u2014is more fragmentary. The harmonies resulting from the combined voices produce a hymn-like effect. described the anapaest as a \"joy\" motif; to Hermann Keller it symbolised \"constancy\". For , the angular motifs and richer subdued textures in the lower registers are consonant with the \"firm hope\" of the text, in contrast to more animated evocations of joy. * BWV 641 Wenn wir in h\u00f6chsten N\u00f6ten sein [When we are in the greatest distress] a 2 Clav. et Ped. \u2022 play MP3 Adriaen Isenbrandt, Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows 500px Below are the first two verses of the hymn of Paul Eber with the English translation of Catherine Winkworth. {| |- | ::Wenn wir in h\u00f6chsten N\u00f6ten sein ::und wissen nicht, wo aus noch ein, ::und finden weder Hilf' noch Rat, ::ob wir gleich sorgen fr\u00fch und spat: ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::So ist dies unser Trost allein, ::da\u00df wir zusammen insgemein ::dich rufen an, o treuer Gott, ::um Rettung aus der Angst und Not. | ::When in the hour of utmost need ::We know not where to look for aid, ::When days and nights of anxious thought ::Nor help nor counsel yet have brought, ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Then this our comfort is alone, ::That we may meet before Thy throne, ::And cry, O faithful God, to Thee, ::For rescue from our misery. | |} The cantus firmus of this ornamental chorale prelude was written by Louis Bourgeois in 1543. It was used again the last of the Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes, BWV 668. The accompaniment in the two middle voices, often in parallel sixths, and the pedal is derived from the first four notes of the melody. The highly ornate ornamentation is rare amongst Bach's chorale preludes, the only comparable example being BWV 662 from the Great Eighteen. The vocal ornamentation and portamento appoggiaturas of the melody are French in style. Coloratura passages lead into the unadorned notes of the cantus firmus. describes this musical device, used also in BWV 622 and BWV 639, as a means of conveying \"a particular kind of touching, inexpressible expressiveness.\" The prelude has an intimate charm: as Albert Schweitzer commented, the soprano part flows \"like a divine song of consolation, and in a wonderful final cadence seems to silence and compose the other parts.\" * BWV 642 Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4\u00dft walten [He who allows dear God to lead him] \u2022 play MP3 Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes, early 16C Flemish stained glass 500px Below are the first and last verses of the hymn Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4\u00dft walten of Georg Neumark with the English translation of Catherine Winkworth. {| |- | ::Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4\u00dft walten ::und hoffet auf ihn allezeit, ::den wird er wunderlich erhalten ::in allem Kreuz und Traurigkeit. ::Wer Gott, dem Allerh\u00f6chsten, traut, ::der hat auf keinen Sand gebaut. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Sing, bet und geh auf Gottes Wegen, ::verricht das Deine nur getreu ::und trau des Himmels reichem Segen, ::so wird er bei dir werden neu; ::denn welcher sine Zuversicht ::auf Gott setzt, den verl\u00e4\u00dft er nicht. | ::If thou but suffer God to guide thee, ::And hope in Him through all thy ways, ::He'll give thee strength, whate'er betide thee. ::And bear thee through the evil days. ::Who trusts in God's unchanging love ::Builds on the rock that nought can move. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Sing, pray, and keep His ways unswerving. ::So do thine own part faithfully. ::And trust His word ; though undeserving, ::Thou yet shalt find it true for thee \u2014 ::God never yet forsook at need ::The soul that trusted Him indeed. | |} The melody was also composed by Neumark: it and the text were first published in his hymn book of 1657. The hymn tune was later set to other words, notably \"\" (\"Who knows how near is my end?\"). Neumark originally wrote the melody in time. Bach, however, like Walther, B\u00f6hm and Krebs, generally preferred a version in time for his fourteen settings in chorale preludes and cantatas: it appears in cantatas BWV 21, BWV 27, BWV 84, BWV 88, BWV 93, BWV 166, BWV 179 and BWV 197, with words taken from one or other of the two hymn texts. In the chorale prelude BWV 642, the unadorned cantus firmus in time is in the soprano voice. The two inner voices, often in thirds, are built on a motif made up of two short beats followed by a long beat\u2014an anapaest\u2014often used by Bach to signify joy (for example in BWV 602, 605, 615, 616, 618, 621, 623, 627, 629, 637 and 640). The pedal has a walking bass which also partly incorporates the joy motif in its responses to the inner voices. For the accompaniment symbolised \"the joyful feeling of confidence in God's goodness.\" BWV 642 has similarities with the earlier chorale prelude BWV 690 from the Kirnberger collection, with the same affekt of a delayed entry in the second half of the cantus firmus. The compositional structure for all four voices in BWV 642 is close to that of BWV 643. * BWV 643 Alle Menschen m\u00fcssen sterben [All mankind must die] \u2022 play MP3 Martin Schongauer, Noli me tangere 500px Below are the first and last two verses of the funeral hymn of Johann Georg Albinus with the English translation of Catherine Winkworth. {| |- | ::Alle Menschen m\u00fc\u00dfen sterben, ::alles Fleisch vergeht wie Heu; ::was da lebet, mu\u00df verderben, ::soll es anders werden neu. ::Dieser Leib, der mu\u00df verwesen, ::wenn er anders soll genesen ::zu der gro\u00dfen Herrlichkeit, ::die den Frommen ist bereit. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::O Jerusalem, du Sch\u00f6ne, ::ach, wie helle gl\u00e4nzest du! ::Ach, wie lieblich Lobget\u00f6ne ::h\u00f6rt man da in sanfter Ruh'! ::O der gro\u00dfen Freud' und Wonne! ::Jetzund gehet auf die Sonne, ::jetzund gehet an der Tag, ::der kein Ende nehmen mag. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Ach, ich habe schon erblicket ::diese gro\u00dfe Herrlichkeit! ::Jetzund werd' ich sch\u00f6n geschm\u00fccket ::mit dem wei\u00dfen Himmelskleid ::und der goldnen Ehrenkrone, ::stehe da vor Gottes Throne, ::schaue solche Fruede an, ::die kein Ende nehmen kann. | ::Hark! a voice saith, All are mortal, ::Yea, all flesh must fade as grass, ::Only through Death's gloomy portal ::To a better life ye pass, ::And this body, formed of clay, ::Here must languish and decay. ::Ere it rise in glorious might, ::Fit to dwell with saints in light. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::O Jerusalem, how clearly ::Dost thou shine, thou city fair! ::Lo ! I hear the tones more nearly ::Ever sweetly sounding there! ::Oh what peace and joy hast thou! ::Lo the sun is rising now, ::And the breaking day I see ::That shall never end for me! ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Yea, I see what here was told me. ::See that wondrous glory shine. ::Feel the spotless robes enfold me. ::Know a golden crown is mine; ::So before the throne I stand. ::One amid that glorious band, ::Gazing on that joy for aye ::That shall never pass away! | |} BWV 643 is one of the most perfect examples of Bach's Orgelb\u00fcchlein style. A mood of ecstasy permeates this chorale prelude, a funeral hymn reflecting the theme of heavenly joy. The simple cantus firmus sings in crotchets (quarter notes) above an accompanying motif of three semiquavers (16th notes) followed by two quavers (eighth notes) that echoes between the two inner parts and the pedal. This figure is also found in the organ works of Georg B\u00f6hm and Daniel Vetter from the same era. describes its use by Bach as a motif of \"beatific peace\", commenting that \"the melody of the hymn that speaks of the inevitability of death is thus enveloped in a motif that is lit up by the coming glory.\" Despite the harmonious thirds and sixths in the inner parts, the second semiquaver of the motif produces a momentary dissonance that is instantly resolved, again contributing to the mood of joy tinged by sadness. As comments, \"What tender melancholy lurks in the chorale, Alle Menschen m\u00fc\u00dfen sterben, what an indescribable expressiveness, for instance, arises in the last bar from the false relation between c\u266f and c', and the almost imperceptible ornamentation of the melody!\" * BWV 644 Ach wie nichtig, ach wie fl\u00fcchtig [Oh how fleeting, oh how feckless] \u2022 play MP3 Bartholom\u00e4us Bruyn, Memento Mori 500px Below are the first and last verses of Michael Franck's 1652 Lutheran hymn Ach wie fl\u00fcchtig, ach wie nichtig with the English translation of Sir John Bowring. {| |- | ::Ach wie fl\u00fcchtig, ::ach wie nichtig ::ist der Menschen Leben! ::Wie Ein Nebel bald enstehet ::und auch wie der bald vergehet ::so ist unser Leben sehet! ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::Ach wie nichtig, ::ach wie fl\u00fcchtig ::sind der Menschen Sachen! ::Alles, alles was wir sehen, ::das mu\u00df fallen und vergehen. ::Wer Gott f\u00fcrcht', wird ewig stehen. | ::O how cheating, ::O how fleeting, ::Is our earthly being! :: 'Tis a mist in wintry weather, ::Gathered in an hour together, ::And as soon dispersed in ether. ::\u2218\u2218\u2218 ::O how fleeting, ::O how cheating, ::All\u2014yes! all that's earthly! ::Everything is fading, flying, ::Man is mortal, earth is dying. ::Christian! live on Heaven relying. | |} The verses of Franck's hymn alternate the order of the words nichtig and fl\u00fcchtig in their opening lines. Bach's title conforms to a later 1681 hymnbook from Weimar which inverted the order throughout. The chorale prelude is in four voices for single manual with pedals. The cantus firmus in the soprano voice is a simple form of the hymn tune in crotchets. The accompaniment, intricately crafted from two separate motifs in the inner voices and in the pedal, is a particularly fine illustration of Bach's compositional method in the Orgelb\u00fcchlein. The motif in the pedal is a constant three-note quaver figure, with octave leaps punctuated by frequent rests. Above this bass, the inner voices weave a continuous pattern of descending and ascending scales in semiquavers, constantly varying, sometimes moving in the same direction and sometimes in contrary motion. This texture of flowing scales over a \"quasi-pizzicato\" bass captures the theme of the hymn: it is a reflection on the transitory nature of human existence, likened to a mist \"gathered in an hour together, and soon dispersed.\" Similar semiquaver figures had been used in other contemporary settings of this hymn, for example in a set of variations by B\u00f6hm ::4th variation of Georg B\u00f6hm's partita on Ach wie nichtig and in the first chorus of Bach's cantata BWV 26, but without conveying the same effect of quiet reflection. To the scales \"hurry by like misty ghosts.\" Hermann Keller saw the bass motif as representing \"the futility of human existence.\" Others have suggested that the rests in the pedal part might symbolise the nothingness of ach wie nichtig. Exceptionally Bach scored the final chord of this nebulous piece without pedal. A similar device has been used by Bach for the word inanes (\"empty\") in the ninth movement of his Magnificat. also sees similarities with Bach's omission of a bass part in Wie zittern und wanken from cantata BWV 105, an aria concerned with the uncertainties in the life of a sinner. == Reception == Marienkirche in Halle which Bach played in 1713 in an audition for organist and subsequently evaluated in 1716 The Orgelb\u00fcchlein was originally passed from teacher to student and was not published in its entirety until Felix Mendelssohn edited an edition. Notable editions have been made by Robert Clark and John David Peterson, Quentin Faulkner, Albert Riemenschneider, and Albert Schweitzer. ==Transcriptions== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background-color:#E0E0E0;\" !
