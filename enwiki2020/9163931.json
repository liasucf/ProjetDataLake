He was successively the headmaster of Shrewsbury School and Eton College. He also served as chaplain to King George V and as Dean of Durham. ==Early life== Dr Alington was the second son of the Rev. Henry Giles Alington, an inspector of schools, and his wife Jane Margaret Booth (d. 1910), daughter of Rev. Thomas Willingham Booth. His father came from a long line of clerics, a branch of the landed gentry Alington family of Little Barford Manor House, St Neots, Huntingdonshire, and was descended from the Alingtons of Horseheath, an ancient Cambridgeshire family, from which also descended the Barons Alington.Burke's Landed Gentry, 18th edition, ed. Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, 1972, Alington of Little Barford pedigree He was educated at Marlborough College and Trinity College, Oxford, and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in 1896. He was ordained as an Anglican priest in 1901. ==Career== Alington's educational career began as a sixth-form master at Marlborough College in 1896. He moved to Eton College in 1899, but left to become headmaster of Shrewsbury School in 1908. In 1917 he returned to Eton to succeed his brother-in-law, Edward Lyttelton, as headmaster; he remained there until his retirement from teaching in 1933. He served as chairman of the Headmasters' Conference, 1924\u201325. At Eton, a building which houses much of the English department is now named after him, as is Shrewsbury's school hall.

Pfaff, Montague Rhodes James, Scolar Press 1980, p;260 ==Marriage and family== In 1904, Alington married Hester Margaret Lyttelton (CBE; died 1958), the youngest daughter of George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton. The couple had four daughters and two sons. Their eldest daughter, Kathleen, died at the age of 30, and their youngest son Patrick Alington was killed in World War II at Salerno in 1943. Their eldest son, Giles Alington, became Dean and Senior Tutor of University College, Oxford. The three surviving daughters all married Etonians. Lavinia married Sir Roger Mynors, academic and classical scholar; Elizabeth married Sir Alec Douglas-Home, British prime minister; and Joan married Rev. John Wilkes, Master in College and later housemaster at Eton, Warden of Radley College and later vicar of Marlow. Alington died at the age of 82 and was buried at Durham Cathedral, where there is a memorial in the north transept. ==Literary works== Alington wrote more than 50 books, including works on religion, biography, history, poetry, and a series of detective novels.
