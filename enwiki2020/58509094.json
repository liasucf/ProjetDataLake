    "text": "A Daughter's Deadly Deception: The Jennifer Pan Story is a 2016 book written by Jeremy Grimaldi and published by Dundurn Press, discussing the Jennifer Pan affair, in which she conspired in the murder of her mother and the attempted murder of her father. The book is almost 350 pages long. The author, a White Canadian, served as a journalist covering criminal issues in the York Region for the Metroland Media network of publications. ==Background and contents== Grimaldi attended court proceedings for the Pan case in a period of ten months. His research included court documents, police records, photographs, text messages, transcripts, and videos, as well as interviews of psychologists. The first part of the book chronicles the investigation into the murders, while Pan's childhood is discussed in a subsequent chapter. Joyce Lau of the South China Morning Post stated \"Some of Grimaldi's best writing comes in his description of the police questioning of Pan.\" He discusses Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother and Why Chinese Parents Don't Say I Love You in regards to the cultural backgrounds of Asian Canadian parents and why they put pressure on their children to succeed. ==Reception== The director of sales and marketing at Dundurn, Margaret Bryant, stated that A Daughter's Deadly Deception had many e-book sales to places outside of Canada. Lau gave the book four of five stars. She concluded that it \"might not be Truman Capote\u2019s In Cold Blood, but this thorough exploration of what leads seemingly decent people to horrific actions is no tawdry crime paperback, either.\" The book won the 2017 Arthur Ellis non-fiction award. ==References== ==External links== * A Daughter's Deadly Deception - Dundurn Press * - An excerpt of the book * - An excerpt of the book Category:Canadian non-fiction books Category:2016 non- fiction books Category:Books about murder ",
