    "text": "Reading Rainbow is an American half-hour educational children's television series that premiered nationally on PBS Kids on July 11, 1983 and broadcast until August 28, 2009. (It was first seen in a preliminary broadcast in Nebraska and Buffalo, New York.) New episodes were broadcast through November 10, 2006, with a total of 155 half-hour episodes spanning over 21 seasons followed by reruns until August 28, 2009. The show encouraged children to read. In 2012, an iPad and Kindle Fire educational interactive book reading and video field trip application was launched bearing the name of the program. The public television series garnered over 200 broadcast awards, including a Peabody Award and 26 Emmy Awards, 10 of which were in the \"Outstanding Children's Series\" category. The concept of a reading series for children originated with Twila Liggett, PhD who in partnership with Cecily Truett Lancit and Larry Lancit, at Lancit Media Productions in New York created the television series. The original team also included Lynne Brenner Ganek, Ellen Schecter, and host LeVar Burton. Each episode centered on a topic from a featured children's book which was explored through a number of on-location segments or stories. The show also recommended books for children to look for when they went to the library. It is the third-longest running children's series in PBS history, after Sesame Street and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. It was also one of the first PBS shows to be broadcast in stereo. After the show's cancellation on November 10, 2006, reruns aired until August 28, 2009, when it was pulled off from the schedule. On June 20, 2012, the Reading Rainbow App was released for the iPad and, within 36 hours, became the #1 most-downloaded educational app in the iTunes App Store. Built from the ground up by LeVar Burton and his company, RRKIDZ, the app allows children to read unlimited books, explore video field trips starring Burton, and earn rewards for reading. The week of June 11, 2013, Reading Rainbow celebrated its 30th anniversary. In May 2014, a Kickstarter campaign was launched to raise funds to make the app available online, Android, game consoles, smartphones, and other streaming devices along with creating a classroom version with the subscription fee waived for up to 13,000 disadvantaged classrooms. The effort met its initial fundraising goal of $1,000,000 in 11 hours. The campaign met its second goal of $5 million in the last 24 hours, triggering a matching $1 million from Family Guy creator/animator Seth MacFarlane; the final amount raised on Kickstarter is $5,408,916 from 105,857 backers.Project Updates. Kickstarter. Retrieved July 2, 2014. ==Show details== Reading Rainbow was hosted by actor and executive producer LeVar Burton, who at the time was known for his role in Roots. The show was produced first by Lancit Media Entertainment (1983-2001), and then, by On-Screen Entertainment (2002-2006). Every episode featured a different book, often narrated by a celebrity. The featured story's illustrations were scanned by the camera in a technique known as \"iconographic animation\" of each page shown in succession, although on certain occasions the shots would be animated. After the featured story, Burton visited many places relating to the episode's theme, often featuring interviews with guests. One episode featured a behind-the-scenes look at Star Trek: The Next Generation. The last segment of each show, called Book Reviews, recommended by children, began with Burton's introductory catchphrase, \"But you don't have to take my word for it,\" and featured children giving capsule reviews of books they liked. At the end of each episode, Burton was known for saying something akin to; \"I'll see you next time.\" The series' pilot, which aired as the show's 8th episode in 1983, featured the book Gila Monsters Meet You at the Airport by Marjorie Weinman Sharmat and was narrated by Doug Parvin. It was created and produced in 1981. The daughters of producer Larry Lancit, Shaune and Caitlin Lancit, were often featured in the series, notably as the children thanking the sponsors at the beginning and end of the show. ===Theme song and opening sequence=== The show's theme song was written by Steve Horelick, Dennis Neil Kleinman, and Janet Weir; Horelick also served as the series' music director and composer and received an Emmy nomination in 2007 for his work on the series. Over the show's 23-year run, it went through three different versions of the theme song. The original theme (used from 1983-1998) was performed by Tina Fabrique and featured one of the first uses of the Buchla synthesizer in a TV theme song. The original opening sequence, which consisted of an animated butterfly transforming the surroundings of young children reading books into animated fantasy lands, was used until August 1999. The introductory animation was drawn at Oldfather Studios in Lawrence, Kansas on the University of Kansas campus and animated by the late Michael Sporn. In September 1999, episodes began using a new live-action opening sequence and featured CGI in a space-themed world, with a rerecorded version performed by Johnny Kemp. A third intro was used starting in May 2000, with a rerecorded version performed by R&B; artist Chaka Khan. This opening sequence is mostly the same as the second one, but features footage of Burton in place of some of the animated elements. ===Final years as TV series (2005\u201306)=== The Reading Rainbow logo used between 1983 and 1999. Original production was to have ended after April 4, 2005, with the show continuing to air in reruns, but host LeVar Burton said on February 7, 2006, that five new episodes of the show would be shot in 2006 despite the continuing financial issues of PBS. The show aired its final episode original on November 10, 2006 and continued in re-runs until 2009. ==Relaunch as an app== ===Announcement and early developments (2010\u201314)=== Former executive producer LeVar Burton announced on his Twitter feed on March 19, 2010, that \"Reading Rainbow 2.0 is in the works.\" On March 4, 2012, he announced that it was the \"last day of shooting before launch!\" On June 13, 2012, in a special presentation at Apple Inc's annual World Wide Developers Conference, Burton and his business partner, Mark Wolfe, introduced the new Reading Rainbow iPad App. It became available in Apple's iTunes Store on June 20, 2012, and within 36 hours was the #1 educational app. In January 2014, the Reading Rainbow App surpassed 10M books read and video field trips watched by children in 18 months. ===Kickstarter revival campaign and aftermath (2014\u201317)=== On May 28, 2014, LeVar Burton started a Kickstarter fund to revive the show and materials. In under 12 hours the show had reached its $1 million goal. The new goal is to create an educational version for schools to use, free of cost to those schools in need, and help America get back to high literacy rates. They are also going to create a website for students to use to assist them with learning how to read. The following day, May 29, 2014, they reached two million dollars (double their goal) at 1:15 pm. PST. The campaign raised $5,408,916 on Kickstarter with another one million from Family Guy creator/animator Seth MacFarlane, and $70,000 raised via direct contributions. The grand total was $6,478,916. With 105,857 backers, the campaign holds Kickstarter's record for most backers and is the 8th highest amount raised on Kickstarter (as of June 1, 2015).Discover Projects >> Most Funded \u2013 Kickstarter. Retrieved June 10, 2015 In March 2016, Burton launched a new online educational service called Reading Rainbow Skybrary for Schools that follows the same mission of the television series, while expanding to integrate into classroom curriculums. In August 2017, WNED filed a wide- ranging lawsuit against Burton and RRKidz that demands Burton's company hand over administrative access to other websites and social media accounts. The lawsuit also seeks to enjoin Burton from using the Reading Rainbow catchphrase, \"But you don't have to take my word for it,\" on his podcast. As of October 2017, visiting the official Reading Rainbow website provides a page which states that \"Recent legal disputes between WNED and LeVar Burton/RRKIDZ have been resolved and RRKIDZ no longer licenses the Reading Rainbow brand from WNED. WNED is currently working on the next chapter of Reading Rainbow and will continue its mission of fostering education for a new generation.\" ==Accolades== ==Animation producers== ===Feature Book filming=== The photographing of the Feature Book segments was by: * Centron Films (1983\u201387; renamed in 1986 to \"Centron Productions Inc.\") * Loren Dolezal (1988\u201398; renamed in 1995 to \"Dolezal Animation\"); Take Ten Animation teamed up with Dolezal from 1995\u201398. * On Screen Entertainment (2000\u201306) * Roger Holden, designer of the digital animation photography system used by Centron Films to film the Feature Book segments (1983\u201387) ==Guest readers and contributors== * Marv Albert * Jason Alexander (Pet Stories You Don't Have to Walk) * Maya Angelou (All the Colors of the Race) * Michael Ansara (The Gift of the Sacred Dog, Sheila MacGill-Callahan's and Barry Moser's And Still the Turtle Watched) * Lucie Arnaz (When Aunt Lena Did the Rhumba) * Edward Asner (Dinosaur Bob and His Adventures with the Family Lazardo) * James Avery (Berlioz the Bear, Game Day) * Hoyt Axton (Meanwhile Back at the Ranch) * Julia Barr (Raccoons and Ripe Corn, Deer at the Brook, Come Out, Muskrats) * Angela Bassett (The Wonderful Towers of Watts) * Orson Bean (The Runaway Duck) * Philip Bosco (Desert Giant: The World of the Saguaro Cactus) * Reizl Bozyk (Mrs. Katz and Tush) * Wayne Brady (Mr. George Baker) * Jeff Bridges (The Tin Forest) * Fran Brill (Dive to the Coral Reefs) * Matthew Broderick (Owen) * Ruth Buzzi (Miss Nelson is Back) * David Canary (Work Song) * Jose Canseco * Diahann Carroll (Show Way) * Dixie Carter (Come a Tide) * Lacey Chabert (Snowy Day: Stories and Poems) * Julia Child (Florence and Eric Take the Cake) * Roy Clark (Barn Dance) * Kevin Clash (Elmo from Sesame Street) * Imogene Coca (Imogene's Antlers) * James Coco (Perfect the Pig) * Tim Conway (The Secret Shortcut) * Bill Cosby (Arthur's Eyes, Dennis Nolan's Big Pig) * Denise Crosby * Jim Cummings (Frog and Toad) * Jane Curtin (Duncan and Dolores) * Tyne Daly (Amazing Grace) * Keith David (Follow the Drinking Gourd) * Ossie Davis (Summer) * Ruby Dee (Simon's Book, Tar Beach, Badger's Parting Gifts) * Josie de Guzman (Saturday Sancocho) * Brian Dennehy (Kate Shelley and the Midnight Express) * Phyllis Diller (Ludlow Laughs) * Michael Dorn * Ann Duquesnay (Hip Cat) * Eliza Dushku (Unique Monique) * Buddy Ebsen (Steven Kellogg's Paul Bunyan) * Georgia Engel (Chickens Aren't the Only Ones) * Hector Elizondo (Brush) * Fernando Escandon (Hill of Fire) * Lola Falana (Sophie and Lou) * Peter Falk (The Robbery at the Diamond Dog Diner) * Jamie Farr (The Sign Painter's Dream) * Barbara Feldon (The Life Cycle of the Honeybee) * Tovah Feldshuh (The Piggy in the Puddle) * Ron Foster (My Little Island) * Jonathan Frakes * Vincent Gardenia (Louis the Fish, The Adventures of Taxi Dog) * Richard Gere * Jack Gilford (The Purple Coat) * Whoopi Goldberg * Jane Goodall * Robert Guillaume (My Shadow) * Lorne Greene (Ox-Cart Man) * Ed Harris (Enemy Pie) * Jo Hayden (Martha Speaks) * Jim Henson (Kermit the Frog from The Muppets) * William Hickey (Dennis Nolan's Monster Bubbles: A Counting Book, Willi Glasauer's (Greetings from the Surreal) * Gregory Hines (Zin!
