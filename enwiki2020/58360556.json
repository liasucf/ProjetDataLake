    "text": "Paul Derrez (born 20 February 1950) is an Amsterdam-based visual artist. He has established himself as a jewelry designer, gallery owner and collector. He has worked as a teacher in the arts education sector and as an author. Derrez was a founder and for six years a board member of the Dutch Association of jewelry designers and makers (\"Vereniging van Edelsmeden en Sieraadontwerpers\"). == Life == Paul Derrez was born in Sittard, a small former mining town a short distance to the north of Maastricht in Limburg. His parents ran a jewelry shop in Sittard. He attended the Academy for Industrial Design in Eindhoven between 1968 and 1970, and the School of Arts (as it is now known) in Utrecht from 1970 till 1972. He then studied for his degree between 1972 and 1975 at the Vocational Academy (\"Vakschool\") at nearby Schoonhoven. The expectation had been that he would take over his family's business in Sittard. However, after an internship at the \"Galerie Sieraad\" (jewelry gallery) in Amsterdam he decided to settle permanently in that city. A crucial factor in this decision was his friendship with Willem Hoogstede. In 1975 he launched himself as a freelance gold/silversmith working in the basement in the house where he was living in the city centre. He produced several much admired silver pieces (\"wisselring\" & \"wisselarmband\"). In 1975 the Sieraad Gallery where he had been working closed down. It had been the first gallery in Amsterdam specialising in jewelry. A year later, in 1976, Derrez set up the Ra Gallery which in some ways took on the mantle of the Sieraad. The new gallery was named after the ancient Egyptian sun god. It provided a showcase for Dutch silversmiths and jewelry designers and, from 1978, also welcomed the work of international artists. In 1980 Derrez became the first winner of the (subsequently biennial) Fran\u00e7oise van den Bosch Prize for stimulating international interest in jewelry. The cash element of the prize was worth 4,000 Guilders. The 1980s were a decade of rapid internationalisation in the jewelry business. In 1984 Derrez was a co- organiser of the Australian \"Cross Currents\" exhibition, featuring pieces from Australia, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands. Several more exhibitions followed to which Derrez contributed as conservator or organiser. He started working with cork in 1985, producing necklaces as well as bowls and other utensils. In 1986 an exhibition was opened at Sittard using the jewelry collection of Paul Derrez and his friend Willem Hoogstede. It remained on display for ten years. Around 2000 he spent three months as artist in residence at the \"Objects-studio\" in Sydney, Australia. In 2005 he produced his \"Condoommonstrans\", wishing to present the piece at an exhibition in Legnica (Poland). However, the centrality of a condom in the design and the surrounding \"halo of hearts and spermatozoids\" made the design controversial, and he withdrew his design from the exhibition in order to \"avoid a riot\". The \"Condoommonstrans\" is now preserved in the \"church-critical collection\" at the Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht. On 1 November 2015 an exhibition opened featuring approximately 100 Derrez pieces at the CODA (culture centre) in Apeldoorn in celebration of the artist's forty years as a designer and pioneer in the world of jewelry. Derrez was a board member of the Dutch Association of jewelry designers and makers (\"Vereniging van Edelsmeden en Sieraadontwerpers\") between 1976 and 1981, serving during the latter part of the part of that period as chairman. Between 1991 and 2000 he chaired the Fran\u00e7oise van den Bosch Foundation For some years, starting in 1995, he taught at the Arts Academy in Maastricht. In addition, from 2008 till 2010 he lectured at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam-Zuid. == Work == The early work of Derrez has a gender-neutral character. It is marked by clear shapes and the use of silver and acrylate. Midway through the 1990s his output acquired a homo-erotic character. The jewelry series \"Risky business\" includes references to leather straps.Liesbeth den Besten (1997) Paul Derrez, Cool Creator. Amsterdam: Galerie Ra. Derrez insists that jewelry should not always be harmonious: often it is more exciting when pieces also highlight discrepancies and rougher elements. When, in 1993, he was invited to make male jewelry for fashion shows, as a self-aware homosexual himself, he took inspiration from subcultures, fetishism and \"adult toys\". He himself likes to wear jewelry from his \"Tools and Toys\" series. For this series he used materials from the estate of Fran\u00e7oise van den Bosch and it is therefore sometimes referred to as his \"aristocratic aluminium\" (\"adellijk aluminium\") collection. During the present century the focus of his work has increasingly been on silverware: spoons, bowls, jugs and containers, occasionally with a humorous or provocative character, as in the case of his \"Conversation bowl\". In 2012 Derrez started applying so-called \"confetti\" on some of his jewelry and tableware. This involved applying dots of transparent acrylate, often tinted in bright or fluorescent colours. Later he applied a similar decorative effect \"monumentally\", at the CODA (culture centre) in Apeldoorn and at his own gallery. == Personal == Paul Derrez married his longstanding partner, Willem Hoogstede, in 2006. == References == Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Sittard Category:People from Amsterdam Category:Dutch metalsmiths Category:Dutch jewelry designers Category:Dutch art dealers ",
