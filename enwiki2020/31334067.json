    "text": "The city of C\u00f3rdoba in al-Andalus, under the rule of Umayyad Caliph Hisham II al-Hakam, was besieged, pillaged, and attacked by Berbers twice: from 1009 to 1010 and from 1010 to 1013. The siege, and the massacres and sacking that followed have been linked to the decline and end of Umayyad rule.\"By 1013 the power of C\u00f3rdoba was broken and the Umayyad pretenders who struggled for the title of caliph from 1013 to 1031 had neither the military backing nor the resources to extend their transient power.\" From 1011 to 1013, the Berbers engaged in raids on the countryside as well as maintaining a blockade of C\u00f3rdoba from a base at the Medina Azahara. They took control of the Madinat az-Zahra and \"established a base for [Sulayman's] Berber troops. From there he blockaded the city for the next two and a half years.\" () Historian Elizabeth Nash reports that, \"Berber mercenaries from North Africa stationed in C\u00f3rdoba rebelled and sacked Medina Azahara, hauled down its columns, horseshoe arches and soaring vaults, demolished its elaborate water channels, bathhouses and aqueducts, plundered the ruins, then set fire to them.\" During the sacks, C\u00f3rdoba was looted and its citizens were massacred, including many Jews.Benny Morris cites the killing of approximately two thousands Jews Prominent Jews in C\u00f3rdoba, such as Samuel ibn Naghrela, were forced to flee the city in 1013. ==See also== *Fitna of al-Andalus *Timeline of Jewish History *List of massacres in Spain *Timeline of antisemitism *Timeline of the Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula == References == Category:Anti-Jewish pogroms by Muslims Category:1009 in Europe Category:1010 in Europe Category:1011 in Europe Category:1012 in Europe Category:1013 in Europe Category:11th century in Al-Andalus Category:Looting ",
