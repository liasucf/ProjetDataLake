    "text": "We're Lalaloopsy is an animated children's television series co-produced by MGA Entertainment, Splash Entertainment, and Netflix. The series is based on the Lalaloopsy dolls from MGA Entertainment, and is a reboot of the American animated television series Lalaloopsy on Nickelodeon. It debuted on Netflix on January 10, 2017. ==Premise== This Netflix Original series is a reboot of Lalaloopsy, a Nick Jr. series that first aired in 2013. While they both share the basic premise of rag dolls having adventures in Lalaloopsy Land, the exact details of each series are very different. 48 unique lalaloopsies appeared in the original series. In contrast, We\u2019re Lalaloopsy only features 10 characters, a significant downgrade from 48. The Netflix series also offers a more continuity based structure as opposed to the previous series\u2019s more episodic structure. We\u2019re Lalaloopsy mainly focuses on Storm E. Sky (who previously appeared in Lalaloopsy Girls: Welcome to L.A.L.A Prep School) gradually becoming accepted in Lalaloopsy Land. Another difference from the original series is that We\u2019re Lalaloopsy contains a slightly different art style that emphasizes the dolls\u2019 mouths more. Unlike Lalaloopsy, the lalaloopsies are now voiced by adults. ==Characters== ===Main=== * Jewel Sparkles (voiced by Kazumi Evans) is a girly princess who loves tiaras and primping. Her pet is a pink cat named Cat. * Storm E. Sky (voiced by Mariee Devereux) is a punky, tomboyish guitar player who has stage fright and thus doesn't like to sing in front of an audience, and is the newest resident of Lalaloopsy Land. She has a rivalry with Jewel, though they later become friends near the end of the series. Her pet is a purple cat with a black lightning bolt tail named Cool Cat. * Crumbs Sugar Cookie (voiced by Jocelyne Loewen) is a baker.
