    "text": "MicL RNA (mRNA-interfering complementary RNA regulator of Lpp) is a \u03c3 E transcription factor-dependent small non-coding RNA. It was discovered in E. coli. Together with MicA and RybB sRNAs, MicL sRNA down-regulates the synthesis of abundant outer membrane proteins in response to stress. MicL specifically targets mRNA of lipoprotein Lpp, preventing its translation. == References == Category:Non-coding RNA Category:RNA Category:RNA-binding proteins ",
