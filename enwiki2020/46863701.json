    "text": "Volatolomics is a branch of chemistry that studies volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by a biological system, under specific experimental conditions. == Etymology == According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the suffix \u2018omics\u2019 refers to \u2018the totality of some sort\u2019. In biology, \u2018omics\u2019 techniques are used for the high-throughput analysis of DNA sequences and epigenetic modifications (genomics), mRNA and miRNA transcripts (transcriptomics), expressed proteins (proteomics), as well as synthesised metabolites (metabolomics) in a biological system (cell, tissue, organism, etc.) under a given set of experimental conditions. Due to the high number of variables that are measured simultaneously, these techniques provide large and complex datasets that require adapted tools for data analysis and interpretation.Pielaat, A. et al.

Metabolomics: the apogee of the omics trilogy. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 13, 263\u2013269 (2013). == Key concepts == The European Council directive 1999/13/EC defines volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as \u201cany organic compound having at 293.15 K a vapor pressure of 0.01 kPa or more, or having a corresponding volatility under the particular conditions of use\u201d. In our daily life, these molecules are notably responsible of the flavor of food products, as well as of the fragrance of essential oils used in the cosmetics industry.Brokl, M. et al. Improvement of ylang-ylang essential oil characterization by GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS. Molecules 18, 1783\u20131797 (2013). In nature, these molecules are produced by bacteria and fungi.Insam, H. & Seewald, M. S. A. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soils. Biol. Fertil. Soils 46, 199\u2013213 (2010). They are also synthesized by plants (flowers, fruits, leaves and roots) Dudareva, N., Negre, F., Nagegowda, D. A. & Orlova, I. Plant volatiles: recent advances and future perspectives. CRC. Crit.

Breath Res. 8, 014001 (2014). insects,Fassotte, B. et al. First evidence of a volatile sex pheromone in lady beetles. PLoS One 9, e115011 (2014). etc.). The profiling of VOCs emitted by living organisms takes an increasing importance in various scientific domains like in medicine, in food sciences or in chemical ecology. For instance, in medicine, non-invasive diagnosis techniques of cancer based on the profiling of VOCs from the exhaled breath have been developed.Shehada, N. et al. Ultrasensitive silicon nanowire for real-world gas sensing: noninvasive diagnosis of cancer from breath volatolome. Nano Lett. 15, 1288\u20131295 (2015).
