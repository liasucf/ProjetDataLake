    "text": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Clarinet Quintet, K. 581, was written in 1789 for the clarinetist Anton Stadler. A clarinet quintet is a work for one clarinet and a string quartet. Although originally written for basset clarinet,Oxford Music Online, \"Basset clarinet\", Nicholas Shackleton in contemporary performances it is usually played on a clarinet in A. It was Mozart's only completed clarinet quintet, and is one of the earliest and best-known works written especially for the instrument. It remains to this day one of the most admired of the composer's works. The quintet is sometimes referred to as the Stadler Quintet; Mozart so described it in a letter of April 1790.Einstein (1945), p. 194 Mozart also wrote a trio for clarinet, viola and piano for Stadler, the so-called Kegelstatt Trio, in 1786. ==Composition and premiere== The composer indicated that the work was finished on 29 September 1789.Quintett in A KV 581: Score, Neue Mozart-Ausgabe It received its premiere on 22 December of the same year, in one of the four annual Vienna performances of the Tonk\u00fcnstler-Societ\u00e4t, an organization that existed to fund pensions for widows and orphans of musicians. The main item on the program was a cantata, Il natale d'Apollo, by Vincenzo Righini; Mozart's work was performed between the two halves of this work. The solo clarinet part was taken by Stadler, the first violin part by Joseph Zistler (1744\u20131794). ==Structure== The work consists of the following four movements and, with the intended repetitions, has a duration of between 31 and 38 minutes, usually around 35 minutes. 1st movement: Allegro,The C. F. Peters Leipzig edition of the score marks the movement as Allegretto A major, time = 4/4, 197 bars, where bars 1 to 79 and bars 80 to 197 are repeated. This movement shows the typical sonata form with exposition, development and recapitulation. 2nd movement: Larghetto, D major, time = 3/4, 85 bars 3rd movement: Menuetto with Trio I in A minor and Trio II in A major, time = 3/4, 31 + 41 + 51 bars. Here, too, the individual sections are repeated. 4th movement: Allegretto con variazioni, A major (Variation III in C major), time = 2/2. The presentation of the theme with 16 bars is followed by four variations with three times 16 and one time 20 bars. This is followed by two basically independent small movements: an Adagio with 21 bars and an Allegro with 36 bars. Here, too, repetition of the individual sections. ===First movement=== The first movement sets the mood for the entire piece. It has beautiful moving lines in all of the parts and in the second half there is a virtuoso run that is passed throughout the strings, based on material from the second section of the exposition. : \\relative c { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\" \\tempo \"Allegro\" \\tempo 4 = 126 \\key a \\major \\time 4/4 e2( cis | b a) | b4( cis d b) | gis2( a) | fis4( a e a) | e2 d4.(\\startTrillSpan cis16\\stopTrillSpan d) | cis4 } :Main theme ===Second movement=== The second movement opens with a six-bar transition in place of a central development section, which opposes a first section consisting mostly of a clarinet melody over muted strings against a second group of themes in which \u2013 as in the first movement \u2013 several upward runs of scales are given to the first violin, alternating with brief phrases of clarinet melody. These scales are given to the clarinet in the recapitulation (bar 51). In the last few bars of the movement, more chromatic than the rest, the scales turn into triplet arpeggios traded between the strings under the closing clarinet phrases. ===Third movement=== The third movement consists of a minuet and, unusually, two trios. The first trio is for the strings alone, with a theme that has a signature acciaccatura every few notes. The second trio is a clarinet solo over the strings, whereas in the minuet the roles are distributed more evenly. ===Fourth movement=== The finale is in variation form, unexpectedly substituting for the more conventional rondo.Warrack, p. 3 There are five variations. The theme is in two repeated halves, with the clarinet joining in but only for a few of its bars. As often with Mozart, phrase structure is generally the same throughout the variations even if other qualities change \u2013 the theme consists of four four-bar phrases (Mozart is often more irregular in his phrasing than this), the first going harmonically from A to E, the second back from E to A, etc. and likewise with the variations. The first of its variations gives the clarinet a new theme, in counterpoint with the theme of the variations divided amongst the quartet. The second alternates phrases for quartet only with phrases for full quintet, the latter answering the former. The third, in A minor, also begins without clarinet, with a viola melody \u2013 also with signature acciaccatura \u2013 but the clarinet joins in to finish. The major mode returns for the fourth variation, as does the main theme to the accompaniment of semiquaver virtuosity \u2013 given to the clarinet only in the first repeated half, first violin and clarinet in the second. There are four bars of dramatic interruption leading to a pause; the next variation is a lyrical Adagio. A transition brings us to an Allegro coda, containing much of a variation itself. : \\relative c { \\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\"violin\" \\key a \\major \\time 2/2 \\tempo \"Allegretto con Variazioni\" \\tempo 4 = 109 e4-.\\p e-. cis-. cis-. d8.

Both are in the key of A major and were written for the same soloist, Anton Stadler. Both pieces are written for the basset clarinet, which has an extended lower range. Also, the first theme of the first movement of each piece begins with a falling minor third. Both the second movements are in the same key (D major) and have similar characters and many similar phrases, although they have different tempo markings. There is a direct quotation of two bars in the second movement of the Quintet of the clarinet line in the Concerto's second movement. Alfred EinsteinEinstein (1945), p. 194 notes that while the clarinet \"predominates as primus inter pares\" (first amongst equals) this is nonetheless \"chamber music work of the finest kind\" and the roles are distributed more equally than they would be in a more concertante quintet for wind and strings. ==Fragment second Clarinet Quintet== A score fragment exists for a second (though possibly written first) clarinet quintet in B-flat major, of which a complete exposition survives. It is possible that Mozart completed the movement, as the score continues into the development section on the last surviving page. This fragment is unlikely to be a sketch, as it bears no marks of correction. Nevertheless, the quintet K. 581 in A major is Mozart's sole surviving complete work for clarinet quintet. ==In popular culture== In \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", the final episode of the American television series M*A*S*H, Charles Winchester learns that five Chinese soldiers who surrendered to him are musicians, one of whom plays a theme from the Clarinet Quintet, and Winchester proceeds to teach them the entire piece. ==References== Notes Sources *Einstein, Alfred. translated by Mendel, A. and Broder, N.
