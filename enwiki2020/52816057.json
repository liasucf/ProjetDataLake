Gallivan, \"Some Comments on the Fasti for the Reign of Nero\", Classical Quarterly, 24 (1974), p. 291, 310 Apronianus was afterwards proconsular governor of Africa;Tacitus, Histories, I.76 he was also a member of the Arval Brethren. The cognomen Apronianus poses uncertainty. In the words of Ronald Syme, his name indicates he was \"either an Apronius adopted by a Lucius Vipstanus, or a Vipstanus whose father had married an Apronia\", then implies the woman's father could have been the consul of 39, Lucius Apronius Caesianus.Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford: Clarendon Press: 1986), p. 242 His further relationship to other Vipstani is unknown. Apronianus was co- opted into the Arval Brethren in 57; he remained a member of the religious college until his death 34 years later, which made him one of the longest- serving members of the Brethren.Syme, Some Arval Brethren (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), p. 16 ==References== Category:Imperial Roman consuls Category:Roman governors of Africa Category:Year of birth unknown Category:91 deaths Category:1st-century Romans Apronianus ",
