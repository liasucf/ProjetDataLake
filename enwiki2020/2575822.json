    "text": "Flash and the Pan was Flash and the Pan's 1978 debut album release. The album covers differed between the Australian, the international and United States, and UK releases (UK pictured). The track \"And The Band Played On (Down Among the Dead Men)\" -- about the sinking of the Titanic -- was released as a UK single, reaching No. 54 in September 1978 . \"Hey St. Peter\" was released as a single in the United States in 1979, and reached number 76 on Billboard Hot 100. \"Walking in the Rain\" was later covered by Grace Jones, as part of her 1981 Nightclubbing album. The song was also recorded by South African icon Johannes Kerkorrel, who included it on his album Die Ander Kant in 2000. ==Critical reception== Reviews of Flash and the Pan\u2019s 1978 self-titled album are ambivalent about the vocal style and lyrics, fascinated by the weirdness, but upbeat and sometimes glowing in their overall assessment. Alan Niester in The Globe and Mail calls the album \u201csurrealistic in its detachment at times\u201d, and \u201cone of the strangest but ultimately finest records to surface in the seventies\u201d. Niester concludes that the album is \"the closest thing to a masterpiece we're likely to get this year, and you have to have it\". Niester, Alan. \u201cFlash and the Pan.\u201d The Globe and Mail. 16 June 1979, sec. Inside the Sleeve: Pop. David Fricke in Rolling Stone notes unfavourably the \u201crampant punning\u201d and \u201cmind games\u201d of the lyrics, but says that the songwriters, Vanda & Young, \u201cnever underestimate the simple joy of a good hummable tune\u201d. The same reviewer goes on to say that the album is a \u201cflawlessly executed operetta of applied rock & roll knowledge\u201d Fricke, David. \u201cFlash and the Pan\u201d Rolling Stone, 12 July 1979. Steve Simels in Stereo Review calls the album a \u201cminor pop masterpiece\u201d but says that the synthesiser sound \u201cverges on Eurodisco, with some tacky New Wave organ\u201d. Simels describes the lyrics as \u201cfrankly melodramatic [\u2026] declaimed (in the verses) more often than sung\u201d. Simels, Steve. \u201cFlash and the Pan: Two Rock-\u2019N\u2019-Roll Oddballs Drop Their Aliases\u201d Stereo Review, 1979. But Simels gives up trying to pigeonhole the record with, \u201cLet\u2019s just say that it\u2019s excellent music and let it go at that.\u201d Jon Pareles, writing for Creem says Flash and the Pan\u2019s songs are \u201cincorrigibly catchy\u201d but he earlier notes the detachment of the vocal style and the insincerity of lyrics; like Simels, he counters his own criticism, saying, \u201c[If] You want sincerity, go watch Merv Griffin.\u201d Pareles, Jon. \u201cFlash and the Pan\u201d Creem 11 (1979): 55. Simon Frith in Melody Maker factors the experience of Vanda & Young into the album\u2019s \u201cpop mastery, [which is] evident in the hooks, the minor chords, the insidious orchestrations\u201d. Frith, Simon. \u201cFlash and the Pan\u201d Melody Maker, 21 July 1979. When Frith goes on to express doubts about the \u201cbland monotone\u201d of the vocals, saying that it \u201cadds to the joke, but I\u2019m not sure it adds to the pleasure\u201d, he later adds, \u201cBut then I\u2019m still listening to this LP, and Vanda and Young may be cleverer than I think, and make easy listening out of this robotic sound\". Reviews compared Flash and the Pan\u2019s debut album to the group 10CC, albeit \u201cearly 10CC, before they took themselves seriously\u201d, and \u201c10CC gone maniac\u201d. Alan Niester adds more comparisons: \u201ca hungover Lou Reed\u201d and \u201cTom Waits with a Jack the Ripper fetish\u201d. Jon Pareles says the music is arranged \u201cBrian Eno-style\u201d. David Fricke notes the \u201cshameless pirating\u201d of The Kinks' You Really Got Me on the song, \u201cThe Man Who Knew the Answer\u201d, and compares the vocal narrative in \u201cCalifornia\u201d to that in The Beach Boys\u2019 \u201cSloop John B\u201d \u2013 the result sounding like \u201can outtake from David Bowie\u2019s Low\". ==Track listing== All songs written by Harry Vanda and George Young except where noted. ===European release=== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1978/79) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |Australian (Kent Music Report)||95 |} ==Personnel== * Harry Vanda - producer, guitar, vocals * George Young - producer, synthesizer, lead vocals * Les Karski - bass * Ray Arnott - drums * Warren Morgan - piano == References == Category:Flash and the Pan albums Category:1979 debut albums ",
