    "text": "\"The Red Wheelbarrow\" is a poem by American modernist poet and physician William Carlos Williams (1883\u20131963). The poem was originally published without a title and was designated as \"XXII\" as the twenty-second work in Williams' 1923 book Spring and All, a hybrid collection which incorporated alternating selections of free verse poetry and prose. It is one of Williams' most frequently anthologized poems, and is considered a prime example of early twentieth-century Imagism. ==Writing and publication== The pictorial style in which the poem is written owes much to the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and the precisionist style of Charles Sheeler, an American photographer-painter whom Williams met shortly before composing the poem. The poem represents an early stage in Williams' development as a poet. It focuses on the objective representation of objects, in line with the Imagist philosophy that was ten years old at the time of the poem's publication. The poem is written in a brief, haiku-like free-verse form. With regard to the inspiration for the poem, Williams wrote: > [\"The Red Wheelbarrow\"] sprang from affection for an old Negro named > Marshall. He had been a fisherman, caught porgies off Gloucester. He used to > tell me how he had to work in the cold in freezing weather, standing ankle > deep in cracked ice packing down the fish. He said he didn\u2019t feel cold. He > never felt cold in his life until just recently. I liked that man, and his > son Milton almost as much. In his back yard I saw the red wheelbarrow > surrounded by the white chickens. I suppose my affection for the old man > somehow got into the writing.Quoted in In 2015, research identified the man who had inspired the work as Thaddeus Lloyd Marshall Sr., who lived a few blocks away from Williams in Rutherford, New Jersey and is buried in Ridgelawn Cemetery in neighboring Clifton. When the poem was originally published in Spring and All, it was simply titled \"XXII\", denoting the poem's order within the book. Referring to the poem as \"The Red Wheelbarrow\" has been frowned upon by some critics, including Neil Easterbrook, who said that such reference gives the text \"a specifically different frame\" from that which Williams originally intended. Prior to the revelation about Mr. Marshall, some critics and literary analysts believed that the poem was written about one of Williams' patients, a little girl who was seriously ill: > This poem is reported to have been inspired by a scene in Passaic, New > Jersey, where Williams was attending to a sick young girl. Worried that his > patient may not survive, Williams looked out the window and saw the > wheelbarrow and chickens.Robert A. Troyer, \"So Much Depends Upon > Linguistics\".

Troyer cites Lezlie > Couch's 1987 essay \"So Much Depends\" (English Journal, v76 n7 p. 29-35, > November 1987) for this information. > At the time, I remember being mystified by the poem.

What is left out of Williams' poem is the > fact that when he conceived that image he was sitting at the bedside of a > very sick child (Williams was a medical doctor). The story goes that as he > sat there, deeply concerned about the child, he looked out the window, saw > that image, and penned those words.G.

Vision and Resonance: Two Sense of Poetic Form. Copyright \u00a9 1975 by Oxford UP. cited here The editors of Exploring Poetry believe that the meaning of the poem and its form are intimately bound together. They state that \"since the poem is composed of one sentence broken up at various intervals, it is truthful to say that 'so much depends upon' each line of the poem. This is so because the form of the poem is also its meaning.\"Exploring Poetry, Gale. \u00a9 Gale Group Inc. 2001 This viewpoint is also argued by Henry M. Sayre who compared the poem to the readymade artwork of Marcel Duchamp.Sayre, Henry. The Visual Text of William Carlos Williams. Copyright 1983 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois. Peter Baker analyzed the poem in terms of theme, writing that \"Williams is saying that perception is necessary to life and that the poem itself can lead to a fuller understanding of one's experience.\"Modern Poetic Practice: Structure and Genesis. New York: Peter Lang, 1986. Kenneth Lincoln saw humor in the poem, writing \"perhaps it adds up to no more than a small comic lesson in the necessity of things in themselves.\"Lincoln, Kenneth.Sing with the Heart of a Bear: Fusions of Native and American Poetry, 1890\u20131999. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999. ==In popular culture== * \"The Red Wheelbarrow\" is a recurring reference in Mr. Robot.
