It is noted as being the first film to handle the subject of male homosexuality and the status of homosexuals in Egypt.

Thursday 26 June 2008 (Arabic calendar: Thursday Jumada al-Thani 1429). Though he expressed desire for the film to be suppressed and held from film festivals, it was screened at various film festivals around the world in such cities as San Francisco, New York, Athens, Melbourne, Sydney, Bangalore and Ljubljana. Dr. Zeyn il-Abedyn, Egypt's Anti-AIDS Program Director, said that the film was \"a painful blow to all our efforts to combat the spread of HIV.\" In an interview with Arabiya.net, he stated that \"Unnatural sexual practices are second only to blood transfusions as probable causes for infection with this disease\", which the Egyptian Underground Film society replied is a \"clear implication that HIV/AIDS only infect male homosexuals.\" The EUFS continued, stating: \"By implying this, he completely ignores scientific fact; statistics have shown that AIDS is also widespread among heterosexuals and children. Instead of raising public awareness about safe sex, such statements are misleading and create a false sense of security; they create a popular belief that HIV/AIDS only infects a certain class of people, leading to the illusion of safety which, in turn, leads to the spread of the disease.\" Regarding responses of conservative Muslim figures, Maher Sabry said \"I\u2019m not surprised that this happened. It was expected, yet it\u2019s still painful to me, because it\u2019s an indication of just how backward we\u2019ve become. We\u2019re now living in an age of cultural regression, an age where dissidents, presidential candidates and religious minorities are thrown into jail. We claim to be emulating Islamic civilization; but if the people who built that civilization were alive today, there would have been fatwas pronounced against them, and their books and other works would have been burned.\" ===Awards=== In 2011, All My Life earned the Audience Award in the category of Narrative Feature at the 7th FACE \u00e0 FACE film festival. The festival is based in St Etienne, France, with the mission to promote positive attitudes towards homosexuality through art and Culture. ==See also== * Cinema of Egypt * Pleasure and Suffering ==References== ==Further reading== * Mustapha, Tariq (\u0637\u0627\u0631\u0642 \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u064a). \"\u0645\u0634\u0627\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062b\u0644\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u0641\u064a\u0644\u0645 \u0633\u064a\u0646\u0645\u0627\u0621\u0649 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0623\u063a\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0647\u0627\u062f.\" (.\" () Rose el Yousef. - Article about the film ==External links== * * Category:2008 films Category:Arabic-language films Category:Egyptian films Category:Egyptian LGBT- related films Category:LGBT-related drama films Category:2008 LGBT-related films Category:Gay-related films Category:Egyptian drama films ",
