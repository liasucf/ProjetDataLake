The design featured numerous improvements including a redesigned wing with a new low drag section, a larger fuselage and bonded rather than riveted construction. It also replaced the radial piston engines with turboprops. The prototype was followed by about 30 production Y-12 (I) aircraft before a revised version was produced. This was designated the Y-12 (II), which featured more powerful engines and removal of leading edge slats, first flying on 16 August 1984 and receiving Chinese certification in December of the following year.JWR Taylor 1988, p.38. The power plants are two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-27 turboprops with Hartzell propellers. The Y-12 has a maximum takeoff weight of 5,700 kg (12,600 lb) with seating for 17 passengers and two crew. The aircraft is operated as a light commuter and transport aircraft. The latest development is the Y-12F, which is almost a new design with many improvements: new wings, new landing gear, new fuselage, with more powerful engines from Pratt & Whitney Canada and extended payload and range. The Y-12F made its maiden flight on December 29, 2010, received CAAC type certification on December 10, 2015, and FAA type certification on February 22, 2016. In 2015 Kenmore Air announced that they would begin development of floats for the Y-12 for FAA certification. The Y-12 completed the FAA evaluation flight tests for its automatic flight control system on June 30, 2018, with its performance meeting the requirements, said AVIC Harbin Aircraft Industry Company Ltd (AVIC HAFEI). ==Variants== Harbin Y-12 (II) at China Aviation Museum, Beijing Harbin Y-12E Harbin Y-12F * Y-12 (I): Twin-engined STOL utility transport aircraft, powered by two 500-shp (373-kW) Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-11 turboprop engines. Prototype version. * Y-12 (II): Fitted with more powerful PT6A-27 engines. * Y-12 (III): Planned version to be fitted with WJ-9 turboprop. Evolved to Y-12C because of IV's success when WJ-9 development was completed. * Y-12 (IV): Improved version. Revised wingtips (span increased to 19.2 m (63 ft)) and increased takeoff weight. 19 passenger seats. This version is the first aircraft in the series certified by the FAA in 1995.FAA Y-12 IV and Y-12E Type Certificate retrieved 17 August 2013. * Y-12C: Basically a (IV) version with WJ-9 turboprop, used by PLAAF for aerial survey. * Y-12D: Domestically deployed military version with upgraded engines driving four- bladed propellers, used by PLA Airborne Corps for parachute training. * Y-12E: Variant with 18 passenger seats. PT6A-135A engines of equal horsepower but increased torque driving four-bladed propellers. This version was certified by the FAA in 2006.FAA Y-12 IV and Y-12E Type Certificate retrieved 12 November 2009. * Y-12F: The latest development with almost everything redesigned: wider fuselage, new wings, retractable landing gear and more powerful PT6A-65B engines.Francis, Leithen. \"Harbin Y-12 turboprop to be bigger\" Flight International 20 September 2007 (online version) retrieved 12 November 2009 The Y-12F has higher cruise speed, longer range and can accommodate 19 passengers or 3x LD3 containers. Design started in April 2005 and the maiden flight was on 29 December 2010. CAAC type certification was received on 10 December 2015 and FAA certification on 22 February 2016. The Y-12F passed flight tests for its automatic flight control system by the FAA on 30 June 2018. It was demonstrated during the 2012 Zhuhai Airshow. * Y-12G: Proposed cargo version of Y-12F. * Turbo Panda: Export name for (II) version, marketed by England and Japanese companies. No real order due to airworthiness certification. * Twin Panda: Originally (II) version for export. Later a modified Y-12 (IV) powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-34 turboprop engines and fitted with uprated undercarriage, upgraded avionics and interior. Thirty-five orders reportedly received by 2000 but production not proceeded with. ==Operators== ===Military operators=== ; * Royal Cambodian Air ForceHoyle Flight International 6\u201312 December 2016, p. 32. ; * People's Liberation Army Air Force ; * Djibouti Air Force - 2 as of December 2016.Hoyle Flight International 6\u201312 December 2016, p. 34. ; * Eritrean Air ForceHoyle Flight International 6\u201312 December 2016, p. 35. ; * Ghana Air ForceHoyle Flight International 6\u201312 December 2016, p. 36. ; * Guyana Air Force Harbin Y-12 II of the Sri Lanka Air Force ; * Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Air ForceHoyle Flight International 6\u201312 December 2016, p. 37. ; * Kenya Air ForceHoyle Flight International 6\u201312 December 2016, p. 39. ; *Mali Air Force \u2013 2 ; * Mauritanian Air ForceHoyle Flight International 6\u201312 December 2016, p. 40. ; * Myanmar Air Force - 2 as of December 2016.Hoyle Flight International 6\u201312 December 2016, p. 41. ; * Namibian Air Force ; * Pakistan Air ForceHoyle Flight International 6\u201312 December 2016, p. 43. * Pakistan ArmyHoyle Flight International 6\u201312 December 2016, p. 44. ; * Polic\u00eda Nacional del Per\u00faJackson 2003, p. 82. * Peruvian Air ForceHoyle Flight International 11\u201317 December 2012, p. 57. ; * Sri Lanka Air ForceHoyle Flight International 6\u201312 December 2016, p. 47. ; * Tanzanian Air ForceHoyle Flight International 6\u201312 December 2016, p. 48. ; * Zambian Air ForceHoyle Flight International 6\u201312 December 2016, p. 53. ===Government operators=== ; * Air Vigilance Service (2) ; * China Marine Surveillance (3) ; * Ministry of Transport (2) ; * Federated States of Micronesia (1) ; * Republic of Seychelles (2) ===Civil operators=== An Air Vanuatu Harbin Y-12 with revised wingtips ; * China Flying Dragon Aviation * China Heilongjiang Longken General Aviation * Donghua General Aviation * Jiangnan General Aviation * Ordos General Aviation Co.
