As of 1 October 2019, the ward has an estimated population of 90,918 and a population density of 9,693 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 9.38 km\u00b2. ==Geography== Naka Ward is located in the center of Nagoya city. Largely hemmed in by Sakura-d\u014dri (\u685c\u901a\u308a), \u014ctsu-d\u014dri (\u5927\u6d25\u901a\u308a), Fushimi-d\u014dri (\u4f0f\u898b\u901a\u308a) and Tsurumai-d\u014dri (\u9db4\u821e\u901a\u308a), it contains the main shopping area of Sakae which includes a massive air-conditioned 5 square-kilometer underground mall and the 'after-five' semi-red light districts of Nishiki and Shin-sakae. ===Surrounding municipalities=== *Chikusa Ward *Kita Ward *Higashi Ward *Nishi Ward *Nakamura Ward *Sh\u014dwa Ward *Atsuta Ward *Nakagawa Ward ==History== Naka Ward was one of the original four wards of the city of Nagoya, established on April 1, 1908. On February 1, 1944 a portion of Naka Ward was divided out to become , but was merged back into Naka Ward on November 3, 1945. Most of the area was completely destroyed during the bombing of Nagoya in World War II. After the war, the layout of the streets was changed to a grid pattern, with wide streets serving as firebreaks. The city is especially proud of Sakae's 100-meter road (100\u30e1\u30fc\u30c8\u30eb\u9053\u8def) so named because of its width. There are small parks and areas for public performances in the area between two four-lane roads that service the city centre. The road is about in width, and in length. Until the 1980s, town-planners were not allowed to build structures more than six stories in height outside of the business districts. ==Economy== In addition the Sakae shopping area, there is also \u014csu, a sprawling old-style small-trader shopping area spreading out from the large \u014csu Kannon (\u5927\u9808\u89b3\u97f3), a Buddhist temple that holds flea markets. The covered streets housing numerous restaurants and stores selling fashion garments, electronics and alternative medicine give a small taste of what Japan might have been like before modernization. Between \u014csu and Sakae in Shirakawa Park are the city's Science and Modern Art museums. South of \u014csu is Kanayama Station (straddling the border with Atsuta-ku and Nakagawa-ku), Nagoya's second-most important rail transportation hub after Nagoya Station and a major access point for the Central Japan International Airport. Many izakayas and pachinko parlors can be found in its vicinity. Naka-ku is also home to the city's Opera House and the main government offices, including the Nagoya City Hall and the Aichi Prefectural Government Office. When Matsuzakaya was an independent company, its headquarters were in Naka-ku.\"\u5f79\u54e1\u30fb\u4f1a\u793e\u6982\u8981.\" Matsuzakaya. May 17, 2001.
