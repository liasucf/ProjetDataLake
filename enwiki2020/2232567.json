L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis is regarded as the Latvian national epic. ==Synopsis== Latvian postage stamp depicting L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis as the protector of Riga The poem recounts the life of the legendary hero L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis, chosen by the gods to become a hero of his people. His name means \"Bear-slayer\", because as a young man, living as the adopted son of the Lord of Lielv\u0101rde, he kills a bear by ripping its jaws apart with his hands. At the castle of Lord Aizkrauklis, he spies on the activities of the witch Sp\u012bdala, who is under the control of the Devil, and the holy man Kangars, who is in reality a traitor plotting with crusaders to replace the old gods with Christianity. Sp\u012bdala tries to drown L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis by throwing him into the whirlpool of Staburags in the Daugava, but he is rescued by the goddess Staburadze and taken to her underwater crystal castle. There L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis meets and falls in love with the maiden Laimdota. Shortly afterwards, L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis becomes friends with another hero, Koknesis (\"Wood-bearer\"), and they study together at the Castle of Burtnieks, Laimdota's father. Kangars provokes a war with the Estonians, and L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis sets out to fight the giant Kalapuisis ( (the \"Kalapuisis\" name is derived from kalapoiss), probably refers to the hero of the Estonian epic poem Kalevipoeg), to win the hand of Laimdota. He defeats the giant, and the two make peace and decide to join forces to fight their common enemy, the German missionaries, led by the priest Dietrich (D\u012btrihs). L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis performs another heroic deed by spending the night in a sunken castle, breaking the curse and allowing the castle to rise into the air again. Laimdota and L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis are engaged. In the following episodes, Laimdota reads from the old books about the Creation and ancient Latvian teachings. Laimdota and Koknesis are kidnapped and imprisoned in Germany. Sp\u012bdala convinces L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis that Laimdota and Koknesis are lovers. L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis returns home to Lielv\u0101rde, then sets sail for Germany. His ship becomes lost in the Northern Sea, and he is welcomed by the daughter of the North Wind. In the meantime, Dietrich and the Livonian prince Caupo of Turaida meet with the Pope in Rome to plan the Christianization of Latvia. L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis begins his dangerous journey home from the Northern Sea. He fights monsters with three, six, and nine heads on the Enchanted Island. Finally, he encounters Sp\u012bdala on the island, and frees her from her contract with the Devil. L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis is reunited with Laimdota and Koknesis, who escaped from Germany but were then trapped on the Enchanted Island. Koknesis declares his love for Sp\u012bdala, and the four friends return to Latvia. A double wedding is celebrated during the J\u0101\u0146i (Midsummer festivities), but the heroes soon set off to fight the German crusaders. After several battles, the Germans are pushed back, and their leader, Bishop Albert, brings reinforcements from Germany, including the Black Knight. At Dietrich's bidding, Kangars finds out the secret of L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis' strength and treacherously reveals it to the Germans: L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis' mother was a she-bear, and his superhuman strength resides in his bear ears. The German knights come to Lielv\u0101rde offering to make peace. L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis organizes a friendly tournament, during which he is goaded into fighting the Black Knight. The knight cuts off L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis' ears. L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis, still, having not yet completely lost his strength, explodes in anger and lifts the Knight, to throw him in the river from a cliff. But the two combatants fall into Daugava river, because the Knight, when thrown, grabs L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis, and they both disappear into the water. In the same moment Laimdota's life ends. ;Canto I: The council of the gods \u2013 L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis' destiny revealed ;Canto II: The first heroic deed of L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis \u2013 L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis sets out to Burtnieki castle \u2013 Meeting with Sp\u012bdala \u2013 In the Devil's pit \u2013 In Staburadze's palace \u2013 Return and meeting with Koknesis ;Canto III: The conspiracy of Kangars and Sp\u012bdala \u2013 War with the Estonians \u2013 The sunken castle \u2013 The Creation \u2013 The Latvians tricked by the Christians ;Canto IV: Kaupa in Rome \u2013 Koknesis and Laimdota in Germany \u2013 L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis in the northern sea \u2013 L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis' return ;Canto V: On the bewitched island \u2013 Meeting with Sp\u012bdala \u2013 Homecoming \u2013 L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis, Laimdota and Koknesis reunited ;Canto VI: Midsummer festival \u2013 Battle begins \u2013 L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis' wedding \u2013 Death of L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis ==Contemporary background== From the time of the Northern Crusades in the early 13th century, most of the land in Courland was owned by nobles descended from the German invaders. In 1863, the Russian authorities issued laws to enable Latvians, who formed the bulk of the population, to acquire the farms which they held, and special banks were founded to help them. By this means, some occupants bought their farms, but the great mass of the population remained landless, and lived as hired laborers, occupying a low position in the social scale. This was the situation prevailing at the time of writing \u2013 thus, the strongly negative presentation of these German invaders had clear contemporary implications for the writer's own time. ==See also== *Latvian mythology *L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis (rock opera) *Laimdota (given name) *Order of L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis *Latvian War of Independence *Latvian literature *L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113\u0161a Day ==Further reading== * Guntis Smidchens, \"National Heroic Narratives in the Baltics as a Source for Nonviolent Political Action,\" Slavic Review 66,3 (2007), 484\u2013508. * Kruks, Sergei. 2004. \u201cThe Latvian epic L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis: Passe-partout ideology, traumatic imagination of community.\u201d Journal of Folklore Research 41(1): 1\u201332. ==External links== *Full text of L\u0101\u010dpl\u0113sis *Verse translation from Project Gutenberg *The Bear Slayer Category:Epic poems Category:Latvian literature ",
