    "text": "Neve Shalom Synagogue (, ; lit. \"Oasis of Peace\" or \"Valley of Peace\") is a synagogue in the Karak\u00f6y quarter of Beyo\u011flu district, in Istanbul, Turkey. The synagogue was built in response to an increase in the Jewish population in the old Galata neighborhood (today encompassed by Beyo\u011flu district) in the late 1930s. A Jewish primary school was torn down in 1949 for that purpose and the synagogue was built on its ruins. The construction completed in 1951. Its architects were Elyo Ventura and Bernar Motola, young Turkish Jews. The inauguration of the synagogue was held on Sunday, March 25, 1951 (17 Adar 5711, Hebrew calendar), in the presence of the Chief Rabbi of Turkey of the time, Hahamba\u015f\u0131 Rav. Rafael David Saban. Neve Shalom is the central and largest Sephardic synagogue in Istanbul, open to service especially on Shabbats, High Holidays, Bar Mitzvahs, funerals and weddings. Neve Shalom suffered three terrorist attacks: *On September 6, 1986, gunmen opened fire during a Shabbat service, which resulted in the death of 22 people. This attack is attributed to the Palestinian militant Abu Nidal. *On March 1, 1992, a bomb attack was carried out by two men, causing no damage or casualties. *On November 16, 2003, the synagogue was hit by one of four car bomb attacks carried out in Istanbul that week (see 2003 Istanbul bombings). Even though a local Turkish militant group, the Great Eastern Islamic Raiders' Front, claimed responsibility for the attacks, police claimed the bombings were \"too sophisticated to have been carried out by that group\", with a senior Israeli government source saying: \"the attack must have been at least coordinated with international terror organizations\". ==See also== * History of the Jews in Turkey * List of synagogues in Turkey ==References== ==External links== * Chief Rabbinate of Turkey * Neve Shalom Synagogue Official Website * Shalom Newspaper - The main Jewish newspaper in Turkey Category:Synagogues in Istanbul Category:Beyo\u011flu Category:Orthodox synagogues Category:Synagogues completed in 1951 Category:1951 establishments in Turkey Category:Massacres in religious buildings and structures Category:Palestinian terrorist incidents in Europe Category:20th-century attacks on synagogues and Jewish communal organizations Category:21st-century attacks on synagogues and Jewish communal organizations Category:Terrorist incidents in Europe in 1986 Category:Terrorist incidents in Europe in 1992 Category:Terrorist incidents in Europe in 2003 Category:Terrorist incidents in Asia in 1986 Category:Terrorist incidents in Asia in 1992 Category:Terrorist incidents in Turkey in 2003 Category:Terrorist incidents in Turkey in the 1980s Category:Terrorist incidents in Turkey in the 1990s Category:Abu Nidal attacks ",
