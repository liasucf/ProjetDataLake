He got his career underway with Deportivo Mor\u00f3n in 2012. He made his professional debut in Primera B Metropolitana against Central C\u00f3rdoba on 30 October, which was the first of thirty-five total appearances across the 2012\u201313 and 2013\u201314 seasons in all competitions. Estudiantes completed the signing of Orihuela on 7 July 2014. However, he departed the club less than two years later after featuring in just two first-team fixtures. January 2016 saw Orihuela join fellow Primera Divisi\u00f3n side Quilmes. He scored his first senior goal in his second match, netting versus San Lorenzo on 20 March at home. He remained with Quilmes until mid-2017, when he departed following their relegation to Primera B Nacional; subsequently signing for Tigre. He played in two games in the first part of 2017\u201318 with Tigre, facing Chacarita Juniors and Temperley; a team who then signed Orihuela in January 2018. A Temperley debut at La Bombonera against Boca Juniors on 11 February was followed by seven further appearances in a season that ended with the club being relegated. On 18 August 2018, Orihuela joined Superleague Greece club Apollon Smyrnis. He appeared twenty times as they were relegated with just ten points; his last game was against Lamia. On 22 July 2019, Newell's Old Boys announced terms had been agreed with Orihuela. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Deportivo Mor\u00f3n |2012\u201313 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera B Metropolitana |9||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||9||0 |- |2013\u201314 |25||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||26||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !34!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!35!!0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Estudiantes |2014 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- |2015 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !2!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Quilmes |2016 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |5||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||5||1 |- |2016\u201317 |28||1||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||29||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !33!!2!!1!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!34!!3 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Tigre |rowspan=\"2\"|2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"2\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||2||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Temperley |8||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||8||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Apollon Smyrnis |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1\"|Superleague Greece |20||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||21||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Newell's Old Boys |2019\u201320 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !99!!2!!3!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!102!!3 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Greece Category:Primera B Metropolitana players Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Super League Greece players Category:Deportivo Mor\u00f3n footballers Category:Estudiantes de La Plata footballers Category:Quilmes footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Tigre footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Temperley footballers Category:Apollon Smyrnis F.C. players Category:Newell's Old Boys footballers ",
