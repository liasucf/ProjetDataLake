It is run at Punchestown over a distance of about 2 miles and 6\u00bd furlongs (2 miles 6 furlongs and 140 yards, or 4,554 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in November. The race is named in honour of Florida Pearl, who won a record four Irish Hennessy Gold Cups for Willie Mullins in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The race was known as the Irish Field Novice Chase until 2006. It was awarded Grade 3 status in 2003 and then raised to Grade 2 in 2011. ==Winners since 1988== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border- collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! style=\"width:36px\" | Year ! style=\"width:160px\" | Winner ! style=\"width:30px\" | Age ! style=\"width:180px\" | Jockey ! style=\"width:180px\" | Trainer |- | 1988 | Wolf Of Badenoch | 7 | Tommy Carmody | John Mulhern |- | 1989 | Maid Of Money | 7 | Anthony Powell | John Fowler |- | 1990 | Larchmont | 9 | Tom Taaffe | Michael Purcell |- | 1991 | Firions Law | 6 | M Flynn | Victor Bowens |- | 1992 | General Idea | 7 | Brendan Sheridan | Dermot Weld |- | 1993 | no race 1993 | | | |- | 1994 | Buck Rogers | 5 | C N Bowens | Victor Bowens |- | 1995 | An Maineach | 6 | J M Donnelly | Capt Donald Swan |- | 1996 | Dorans Pride | 7 | Shane Broderick | Michael Hourigan |- | 1997 | Hill Society | | Paul Carberry | Noel Meade |- | 1998 | Gutteridge | | Tommy Treacy | P D Evans |- | 1999 | Feathered Leader | 7 | Conor O'Dwyer | Arthur Moore |- | 2000 | Limestone Lad | 8 | Barry Cash | James Bowe |- | 2001 | Michael Mor | 7 | Paul Carberry | Noel Meade |- | 2002 | Barrow Drive | 6 | Barry Geraghty | A Mullins |- | 2003 | Satco Express | 7 | Shay Barry | E Sheehy |- | 2004 | Forget The Past | 6 | Barry Geraghty | Michael O'Brien |- | 2005 | Slim Pickings | 6 | David Casey | Robert Tyner |- | 2006 | Purple Shuffle | 8 | Barry Geraghty | P A Fahy |- | 2007 | Santa's Son | 7 | J L Cullen | J F O'Shea |- | 2008 | Trafford Lad | 6 | T J Doyle | E Sheehy |- | 2009 | Aranleigh | 7 | Mark Walsh | Anthony Mullins |- | 2010 | Thegreatjohnbrowne | 6 | Davy Condon | Noel Meade |- | 2011 | Last Instalment | 6 | Davy Russell | Philip Fenton |- | 2012 | Back In Focus | 7 | Ruby Walsh | Willie Mullins |- | 2013 | Morning Assembly | 6 | Ruby Walsh | P A Fahy |- | 2014 | Shanahan's Turn | 6 | Johnny Burke | Henry de Bromhead |- | 2015 | Shantou Flyer | 5 | Mr B O'Neill | Colin Bowe |- | 2016 | A Toi Phil | 6 | Ruby Walsh | Gordon Elliott |- | 2017 | Jury Duty | 6 | Robbie Power | Gordon Elliott |- | 2018 | Some Neck | 7 | David Mullins | Willie Mullins |- | 2019 | Battleoverdoyen | 6 | Davy Russell | Gordon Elliott |} ==See also== * Horse racing in Ireland * List of Irish National Hunt races ==References== *Racing Post: **, , , , , , , , , ** , , , , , , , , , ** , , , , , , , , , Category:National Hunt races in Ireland Category:National Hunt chases Category:Punchestown Racecourse ",
