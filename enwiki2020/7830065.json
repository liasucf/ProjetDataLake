    "text": "Jeff Linsky (born April 12, 1952) is an American fingerstyle guitarist who plays Latin and Brazilian jazz. ==Career== Linsky was born in Whittier, California. When he was ten, he began playing guitar. During the following year, he played at a church dance and attended a concert by classical guitarist Andr\u00e9s Segovia. In his teens he often went to a jazz club in Hermosa Beach, but because he was too young to enter, he remained outside to listen to the music. A solo performance by saxophonist Sonny Stitt made a strong impression on him. He took lessons from Joe Pass and Vicente Gomez. From the early 1970s to the late 1980s, he lived in Hawaii. He toured as a solo musician in the U.S. and Europe, then moved to San Francisco in 1988, and his music began to get more attention. ==Discography== * Compositions (Insight 1977) * Up Late (Concord Picante, 1988) * Simpatico (Kamei, 1991) * Solo (GSP 1992) * Rendezvous (Kamei, 1992) * Angel's Serenade (Concord Picante, 1994) * In the Enchanted Garden with Kevin Kern (Real Music, 1996) * California (Concord Vista, 1996) * Passport to the Heart (Concord Vista, 1997) * Guitarra Latina Romantica (2013) ==DVD== * Fingerstyle Jazz Guitar Solos (Mel Bay, 2003) * Latin Jazz Gutar (Mel Bay, 2008) ==References== Category:American acoustic guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American jazz guitarists Category:Fingerstyle guitarists Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:American male jazz musicians ",
