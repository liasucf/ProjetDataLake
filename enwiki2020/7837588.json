He was Life President of Bovis Lend Lease, the leading global construction management company that he created from the British building firm Bovis during a 15-year period as Chairman and CEO. ==Career== Lampl was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, into a cultured Jewish land-owning family. He was the son of prominent Austrian lawyer Otto Lampl (1887\u20131934) and his wife, Olga Jelinek Lamplov\u00e1. His mother was murdered in Auschwitz in 1944. Lampl was the only member of his family to survive the war. He spent his teenage years as a prisoner in the Theresienstadt ghetto and Auschwitz and Dachau Nazi concentration camps, and his first construction job was as a slave labourer on an underground camp in Kaufering auxiliary camp of Dachau. After World War II, Frank Lampl resumed his studies in Brno(Br\u00fcnn) and inherited property from his murdered family. But after the communist takeover he was denounced as a bourgeois undesirable and sentenced to imprisonment in the uranium mines of Jachymov. He married Blanka Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1, and they had one son. Frank Lampl benefited from a general amnesty on Joseph Stalin\u2019s birthday and was released in 1953 on condition that he take up work in either mining or construction. Having tired of mining he returned to construction. By 1963 he was managing director of the Pozemni Stavby Zavod Opava state construction company and won a place at Brno University.
