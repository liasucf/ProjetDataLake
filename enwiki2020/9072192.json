    "text": "Batman Forever is a pinball machine released in June 1995 by Sega Pinball. It is based on the motion picture of the same name. == Features == The game uses the 192x64 \"supersize\" dot matrix display with a Motorola 68000-based 16-bit controller. It features several electric-green wireform ramps with the \"Batcave\" escape ramp extending down behind the flippers and over the playfield apron, releasing balls up the playfield during multi ball. The \"Batwing\" cannon rotates & aims across the playfield and fires the ball with a pistol grip on front of the machine. Speech clips from the film are used. Additionally, the game had a video mode in which the Batwing is guided over rooftops, dodging obstacles to earn bonus points. == References == ==External links== *Internet Pinball Database entry for Batman Forever Category:1995 pinball machines Category:Arcade and video games based on Batman films Category:Batman (1989 film series) Category:Pinball machines based on films Category:Sega pinball machines ",
