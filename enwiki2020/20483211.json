West as the architect of the building. The El Tovar Apartment building is an excellent example of Spanish Moorish/Art Deco style.

Messiah Housing also owns the nearby Saint Paul Manor Apartments and Kingston Arms Apartments. ==References== ==External links== *Church of the Messiah Housing Corporation Category:Apartment buildings in Detroit Category:National Register of Historic Places in Detroit Category:Residential buildings completed in 1928 Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Historic district contributing properties in Michigan Category:Art Deco architecture in Michigan ",
