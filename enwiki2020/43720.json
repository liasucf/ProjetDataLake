The \"hammer\" used in this sport is not like any of the tools also called by that name. It consists of a metal ball attached by a steel wire to a grip. The size of the ball varies between men's and women's competitions (see Competition section below for details). Men's Hammer Throw Final - 28th Summer Universiade 2015 Safety net for hammer throw ==History== With roots dating back to the 15th century, the contemporary version of the hammer throw is one of the oldest of Olympic Games competitions, first included at the 1900 games in Paris, France (the second Olympiad of the modern era). Its history since the late 1960s and legacy prior to inclusion in the Olympics have been dominated by European and Eastern European influence, which has affected interest in the event in other parts of the world. The hammer evolved from its early informal origins to become part of the Scottish Highland games in the late 18th century, where the original version of the event is still contested today. While the men's hammer throw has been part of the Olympics since 1900, the International Association of Athletics Federations did not start ratifying women's marks until 1995. Women's hammer throw was first included in the Olympics at the 2000 summer games in Sydney, Australia, after having been included in the World Championships a year earlier. ==Competition== The men's hammer weighs and measures in length, and the women's hammer weighs and in length. Like the other throwing events, the competition is decided by who can throw the implement the farthest. Although commonly thought of as a strength event, technical advancements in the last 30 years have evolved hammer throw competition to a point where more focus is on speed in order to gain maximum distance. The throwing motion involves about two swings from stationary position, then three, four or very rarely five rotations of the body in circular motion using a complicated heel-toe movement of the foot. The ball moves in a circular path, gradually increasing in velocity with each turn with the high point of the hammer ball toward the target sector and the low point at the back of the circle. The thrower releases the ball at the side of the circle as the hammer's velocity tends upward and toward the target. the men's hammer world record is held by Yuriy Sedykh, who threw at the 1986 European Athletics Championships in Stuttgart, West Germany on 30 August. The world record for the women's hammer is held by Anita W\u0142odarczyk, who threw during the Kamila Skolimowska Memorial on 28 August 2016. ==All-time top 25 hammer throwers== ===Men=== *Updated August 2015 {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Rank !Mark !Athlete !Location !Date !Ref |- !1 | |align=left| |Stuttgart |30 August 1986 | |- !2 | |align=left| |Dresden |3 July 1986 | |- !3 | |align=left| |Minsk |21 July 2005 | |- !4 | |align=left| |Prague |29 June 2003 | |- !5 | |align=left| |Seville |6 June 1992 | |- !6 | |align=left| |Grodno |9 July 2008 | |- !7 | |align=left| |Lausanne |12 July 1990 | |- !8 | |align=left| |Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica |9 September 1984 | |- !9 | |align=left| |Szombathely |10 August 2003 | |- !10 | |align=left| |Szczecin |9 August 2015 | |- !11 | |align=left| |Zalaegerszeg |19 September 1998 | |- !12 | |align=left| |Sochi |26 May 1990 | |- !13 | |align=left| |Adler |10 February 2002 | |- !14 | |align=left| |Athens |16 May 1988 | |- !15 | |align=left| |Edmonton |5 August 2001 | |- !16 | |align=left| |Lahti |14 July 2004 | |- !17 | |align=left| |Frankfurt |29 June 1997 | |- !18 | |align=left| |Saint-Denis |4 June 1998 | |- !19 | |align=left| |Dortmund |26 June 1999 | |- !20 | |align=left| |Z\u00fcrich |16 August 2014 | |- !21 | |align=left| |Dresden |3 August 1985 | |- !rowspan=2|22 | |align=left| |Zalaegerszeg |30 May 1998 | |- | |align=left| |Kyiv |27 April 2002 | |- !24 | |align=left| |Celje |2 September 2009 | |- !25 | |align=left| |Krasnodar |13 May 1992 | |} ====Notes==== Below is a list of all other throws equal or superior to 86.50 m: *Yuriy Sedykh 86.66 (1986).
