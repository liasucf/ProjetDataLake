He played as a centre. ==Playing career== He debuted for the Spain national rugby union team in a test match against Japan in Tokyo, on 20 August 1999. He played in the 1999 Rugby World Cup and also in the 2001 Rugby World Cup Sevens in Mar del Plata. His last international match was against Slovenia at Ljubljana, on 27 March 2005. At the time of his World Cup cap, despite being the only squad member to play for a Spanish second division club, Moraleja Alcobendas, Alfonso Feijoo had included him primarily because of his speed and potential despite having yet to score for Spain. ==Coaching career== From 2008, Inchausti was named as coach of the Spain national rugby sevens team. He was named again as coach of the Spain national rugby sevens team in 2015, replacing Alberto Soc\u00edas. He also coached Spain during the 2016 Summer Olympics.
