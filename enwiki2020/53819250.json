But little did Bruhn know he had a short stint left in his life going from South to North away from Taylor, Cutmore and his beloved Fitzroy Gang. Bruhn after moving north ran into a well known face. That face being they crazy thug criminal known as John \"Snowy\" Cutmore. Cutmore who then joined gangs with Bruhn as they went on rampage against Kate Leigh and Tilly Devine.
