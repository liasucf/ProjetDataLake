    "text": "2015 Ballabhgarh riot refers to the attacks on 400 Muslim villagers of Atali village, Ballabhgarh, Haryana, India by a Hindu mob. ==Background== The incident took place May 25, 2015 in the village of Atali in Ballabgarh, Faridabad. According to the locals, the cause of the confrontation was a dispute over a 30-year-old mosque. In 2009 the Hindus of the village claimed that it was the property of the village Panchayat. The Muslims said the land belonged to the Waqf board. In March 2015, the Faridabad court ruled in favour of the Muslim community. The Hindus however, continued to raise objections, with some advocating the demolition of the mosque because it stood adjacent to a temple.[1][4] ==Aftermath== A mass of 2000 people attacked the village using swords, bricks, and fire as weapons of choice. The mosque was torched and the Muslims of the village fled. Muslims believe that they were selectively targeted, citing instances such as the only shop burned in a vendor's market belonged to Muslim merchants and only the homes of Muslims were looted. An estimated 400 Muslims were displaced from their homes, many of them slept in the police station in the neighboring village of Ballabgarh. The following day, Muslims began to protest at the Ballabgarh police station because no one had been arrested in relation to the crimes. One month later, still no charges have been brought upon those who committed the attacks. ==References== \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930-\u092e\u0938\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0926 \u0915\u093e \u092b\u0938\u093e\u0926, \u0905\u091f\u093e\u0932\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0928\u092b\u0930\u0924 \u0915\u0940 \u0906\u0917 - \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0923 \u0936\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0932 \u0915\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937 \u0930\u093f\u092a\u094b\u0930\u094d\u091f, \u0924\u0938\u094d\u0935\u0940\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0915\u0947 \u0938\u093e\u0925-3 \u091c\u0942\u0928,2015 \u0915\u0940 \u0930\u093f\u092a\u094b\u0930\u094d\u091f Category:2015 riots Ballabhgarh Category:Persecution by Hindus ",
