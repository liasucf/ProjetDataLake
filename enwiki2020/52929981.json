It has been featured on Android Police, Fast Company, Make Use Of, and Android and Me. Users can choose to have their text files created with JotterPad saved locally, or synced with a Cloud service (Dropbox, Google Drive, or Microsoft OneDrive). JotterPad has features such as Dark Theme, Phrase Search, Markdown, Extended Keyboard, Word Count, Typewriter Scrolling, Snapshots, Night Vision, and even a \u201cResearch\u201d function, which is a built in Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Rhyming Dictionary. Users are able to create their own writing space with customizable Typography with JotterPad\u2019s collection of typefaces. The built-in Dictionary in JotterPad helps users to search for word definitions instantly. The Thesaurus and Rhyming Dictionary gives new ways to express commonly used phrases and words. The application is currently only available on Android and Chrome through Google Play Store. To date, JotterPad has 1,400,000 total installs, and an average rating of 4.5. == Icon == The JotterPad icon consists of a Pilcrow Symbol with the letter \u201cJ\u201d and an inverted letter \u201cP\u201d. == History of JotterPad == === JotterPad HD (2011 \u2013 2014) === JotterPad was first released on Android Honeycomb (3.2.6), and only available on tablets. It was featured on Google Play Store: Editor\u2019s Pick. JotterPad HD featured cloud synchronization to Dropbox, Dark Themes, Time Machine, as well as Typography customization. JotterPad HD was subsequently discontinued in 2014. === JotterPad X (2015 \u2013 2016) === JotterPad was redesigned after its discontinuation in 2015. It underwent a complete transformation, with a brand new interface, available on both Mobile and Tablet Devices. Though cloud synchronization services only supported Dropbox, JotterPad X added brand new features, which includes switching between list and thumbnail views of their file list, Markdown support, dictionary, and thesaurus. === JotterPad 11 (2016 \u2013 2017) === In 2016, JotterPad was given a new face-lift to incorporate Google\u2019s Material Design, which gives users a more seamless interface. Typewriter Scrolling and a Rhyming Dictionary were added to this update. JotterPad 11 was discontinued in early 2017 after Dropbox announced its deprecation of API 1.0. === JotterPad 12 (2017 \u2013 Present) === In March 2017, JotterPad 12 was updated to support Dropbox API 2.0, as well as a new cloud integration system, which supports multiple cloud hosts. Users could now backup their files to Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, and Dropbox. This new integration also allowed users to add multiple cloud services. To improve the navigation between folders, Breadcrumb was added in JotterPad 12. Alternatively, users can swipe right to return to the enclosed folder. In previous versions of JotterPad, the dark theme applied only to the editor. However, in JotterPad 12, the dark theme was upgraded to display throughout the app. JotterPad 12 includes Fountain support, which allows them to export their files to Final Draft Pro (FDX). == Main Features == 1\\. Multi-Functional Themes JotterPad offers features such as Markdown, night vision, extended keyboard, and dark theme. 2\\. Research The research function incorporates a built in Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Rhyming Dictionary so that users are able to lookup words easily. 3\\. File Export Formats Users can convert their text files into TXT, DOCX, RTF, PDF, and HTML using the export function. 4\\. Cloud Integration The Pro Cloud Subscription allows the synchronization of cloud services, including Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, and Dropbox. 5\\. Manage Screenplay JotterPad Pro supports writing in Fountain, and converts the script into a professional screenplay when exported as Final Draft (FDX). The Screenplay Management function makes it easier to make changes to character names and scene placements; simply drag and rearrange. 6\\. Snapshots JotterPad can take snapshots periodically as users work. If an unintended change is made, users can look through past snapshots and restore their work to a previous version. 7\\. Night Vision The Night Vision adds a subtle orange- yellow tint to the screens, making reading and writing easy on the eyes. This decrease in blue light may help to ease Digital Eye Strain. 8\\. Typewriter Scrolling When the typewriter scrolling mode is activated, active texts will always remain in the center of the screen. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Basic Features !Creative !Pro Cloud (Subscription) |- |Local Directory Export to PDF with watermark Export to HTML, RTF, and TXT Extended Keyboard Fonts from Hoefler & Co. |Markdown preview and Syntax highlighting Universal Dark Theme Typewriter Mode Add Custom Typeface Research: Dictionary, Thesaurus, Rhyming Dictionary Snapshots (Version Control) Remove PDF Watermark Export to DOCX (Beta) |Sync to Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive Fountain Preview and Syntax Highlighting Split Screen Management of Screenplay Character and Syntax Prompt Print Fountain Script to PDF Import and Export Final Draft 10 (FDX) Includes all features in Creative |} == Supported Extensions and Encoding == === Extensions === \u00b7 .txt \u00b7 .md \u00b7 .markdown \u00b7 .fountain === Encoding === JotterPad saves text files in UTF-8 by default.
