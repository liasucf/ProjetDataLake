She received her B.A. with honors and J.D. cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania, and then worked as a lawyer with the Washington, D.C., firm of Caplin and Drysdale. She co-founded the National Women's Law Center with Nancy Duff Campbell; they are now its co-presidents. The National Women's Law Center was founded by them to fight for gender equality in economic security, education, health, and jobs. It began when female administrative staff and law students at the Center for Law and Social Policy demanded that their pay be improved, that the center hire female lawyers, that they no longer be expected to serve coffee, and that the center create a women's program. Greenberger was hired in 1972 to start the program and Campbell joined her in 1978. In 1981, the two decided to turn the program into the separate National Women's Law Center. In 2015 Greenberger was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. She is married to Michael Greenberger. ==References== Category:American women lawyers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
