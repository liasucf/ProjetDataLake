    "text": "Mariano Zabaleta (born 28 February 1978) is a retired professional male tennis player from Argentina. He had an unusual but effective service motion. His best shot was his forehand and his favourite surface was clay. Zabaleta's career highlights include reaching the quarter-finals of the 2001 US Open and the final of the 1999 Hamburg Masters. He achieved a career-high singles ranking of World No. 21. ==Tennis career== ===Juniors=== Zabaleta was an outstanding junior in 1995 and finished the year as No. 1 with a junior career singles record of 84\u20137 (also reaching as high as No. 10 in doubles), with his only loss in 1995 being to Peter Wessels in the quarter-finals of the US Open. Zabaleta won three of the major junior events in 1995. The Italian Open juniors without losing a set against Martin Lee in the final 6\u20134, 6\u20132 and followed that up with French Open juniors which was also achieved without dropping a set and he defeated compatriot Mariano Puerta 6\u20132, 6\u20133 as he had done four times in 1995 and not losing a set in the process. Zabaleta finished his junior career with victory in the Orange Bowl over Tommy Haas 6\u20132, 3\u20136, 6\u20131 and that was the only set he dropped in the tournament. ===Pro tour=== Zabaleta struggled initially with the transition from juniors to seniors. In 1996 he won his first Challenger event in Birmingham, Alabama over Bill Behrens 6\u20134, 6\u20134 and his quarter final performance in Bournemouth was his best showing on the main tour. In 1997, he made the final of the Guayaquil Challenger losing to Tomas Nydahl. In 1998 Zabaleta reached the third round of the French Open as a qualifier and defeated the number 2 player in the world and reigning Australian Open champion Petr Korda 6\u20130, 6\u20132, 3\u20136, 4\u20136, 6\u20133 before losing to Hicham Arazi. Later in the year Zabaleta made his first semifinal in Amsterdam losing to Magnus Norman and then in November he won his first ATP title as a senior at Bogot\u00e1 defeating Ram\u00f3n Delgado 6\u20134, 6\u20134 in the final. In 1999, Zabaleta was a finalist on three occasions without winning a title, his best performance was reaching the final of the Hamburg Masters against Marcelo R\u00edos. Zabaleta had matchpoint in the fourth set and lost the set in the tiebreak and lost the match 7\u20136(5), 5\u20137, 7\u20135, 6\u20137(5), 2\u20136. Zabaleta lost to Rios again in St P\u00f6lten and in Amsterdam to Younes El Aynaoui. Zabaleta reached the third round of the 2000 Australian Open his best ever showing at the event before losing to Andre Agassi, but he was involved in an Americas Zone Group Davis Cup tie with rivals Chile in Santiago when Zabaleta was leading 7\u20135, 2\u20136, 7\u20136(1) 3\u20131, when sections of the Chilean crowd incensed by what was perceived to be bad calls against Nicol\u00e1s Mass\u00fa threw missiles, fruits, coins, bottles, plastic chairs among other things. Zabaleta's father was hurt in the disturbances and required 10 stitches and the Argentines did not complete the tie after they were escorted from the court by police. Zabaleta reached the third round of the Olympics in Sydney defeating Marcelo R\u00edos and Jeff Tarango before losing to Max Mirnyi. While there were no titles in 2001 and 2002 for Zabaleta, he achieved his best ever Grand Slam performance surprisingly at the US Open where he made the quarter finals on a fast hardcourt, whereas most of success has come on the clay. He defeated S\u00e9bastien Grosjean who was in the top 10 at the time, in the first round, then Taylor Dent, Greg Rusedski and Xavier Malisse were beaten before Marat Safin ended his run. He also reached the fourth round of the 2002 French Open defeating top 10 player Yevgeny Kafelnikov and falling to \u00c0lex Corretja. 2003 was Zabaleta's best year overall with a 33\u201325 record and for the first time a positive record on both hardcourt 12\u201311 and on clay 20\u201311. He made the semis in Auckland and Scottsdale losing to Gustavo Kuerten and Mark Philippoussis respectively, he made first his final since 1999 at Acapulco in the process avenging the defeat in Auckland by Gustavo Kuerten in the semi finals before losing to Agust\u00edn Calleri. Zabaleta matched his fourth round showing from the previous year at the French Open losing to Guillermo Coria in a match that lasted over 4 hours and 41 minutes and went to 5 sets. Then Zabaleta won his second title in B\u00e5stad defeating Nicol\u00e1s Lapentti 6\u20133, 6\u20134. At the after match presentation the organisers played a recording of the ABBA song \"Money, Money, Money\" that Zabaleta made with Younes El Aynaoui which the crowd enjoyed and had a good laugh about. Zabaleta followed up with a semi final in Kitzb\u00fchel losing to reigning French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero. In 2004, Zabaleta had defended his title in B\u00e5stad against childhood friend and French Open champion Gast\u00f3n Gaudio 6\u20131, 4\u20136, 7\u20136(4). He made the semi finals of the Italian Open defeating Tim Henman and Nicol\u00e1s Mass\u00fa who were both in the top 15 at the time, before losing to Carlos Moy\u00e0. He also had quarter final appearances in Vi\u00f1a del Mar, Buenos Aires and Kitzb\u00fchel. Zabaleta started 2005 with quarter final appearances in Vi\u00f1a del Mar losing to Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez. After pushing the world number 1 Roger Federer to 3 sets in Miami Masters. In the third round of the Monte Carlo Masters, Zabaleta was leading David Ferrer by a set and had to be carried off the court with a foot injury which kept him out for two months and he missed the French Open in the process. He came back to play in B\u00e5stad and lost in the quarter finals to Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych and made the semi finals in Kitzb\u00fchel and after a series of poor results, then he had surgery on his knee.

Zabaleta won the Bermuda Challenger and with this victory took him back inside the top 100 in the ATP rankings. In 2008, Zabaleta suffered very poor results, which led to him dropping beyond top 1000. In March 2009, he lost the 2009 Challenger de Providencia final in Santiago de Chile against countryman M\u00e1ximo Gonz\u00e1lez. After playing on the Challenger circuit in 2009, Zabaleta retired from tennis in 2010 and is now taking part on a TV show on ESPN == Personal and miscellaneous == In 2004 he started his own show called Tenis Pro in which he takes the video camera with him to all the tournaments and highlights life on tour in a light hearted manner and along with Juan Ignacio Chela conduct various interviews with other players, along with other various skits.
