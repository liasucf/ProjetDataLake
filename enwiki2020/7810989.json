    "text": "\"The Silent Cartographer\" is a level in the first-person shooter (FPS) video game Halo: Combat Evolved. Taking place on the Halo ringworld, it follows the Master Chief and a group of UNSC Marines as they wage a daytime beachfront assault on the Covenant alien race in search of an ancient Forerunner installation known as The Silent Cartographer. The level has received critical praise for its visuals and level design, as well as its use of vehicles to enhance gameplay. Called one of the most iconic levels in the Halo series, and one of the best FPS levels of all time by PC Gamer, it is credited as a genre- defining level that changed how FPS levels would be designed in future games from linear, corridor-heavy designs to open spaces emphasizing player freedom. == Level content == The player, in the role of Master Chief, starts out flying towards an island on a Pelican dropship, piloted by the character Foehammer. After Master Chief and his fellow Marines touch down on the beach, combat immediately begins against the enemy Covenant. The enemies are too far away to hit effectively, forcing the player to charge up the beach and into the battle. After eliminating a group of hostile aliens, Foehammer drops a Warthog jeep for the player to ride. The player is encouraged to drive further down the beach, where they fight more aliens who have been dropped off by their own ship. The aliens lock the door of a Forerunner facility, forcing the player back down the beach to find the unlocking system. The player continues until they encounter a new type of powerful Covenant known as the Hunters. Following the player's unlocking of the door, they are also forced to contend with Covenant Elites equipped with active camouflage. Following this, the player retrieves a rocket launcher from a downed Pelican. Getting in a new Warthog, the player unlocks the previously sealed door and enters an interior area with more vertical combat. There, the player must fight their way to the Cartographer and past a powerful sword-wielding Elite and their other squad members. When this is complete, they are evacuated via Pelican. == Development == According to Marcus Lehto, the art director of Halo: Combat Evolved, The Silent Cartographer's design was first inspired by the \"amazing beauty\" of the Pacific Northwest, when developers at Bungie moved to Seattle after Microsoft acquired the studio in June 2000. The level was created while Halo was still being planned as an RTS, therefore having wide open spaces that were conducive to such gameplay. However, the fact that the Warthog was so \"fun\" to drive, led to the team changing the game's genre to an action game. The multiple paths and wide-open areas featured in the level's design forced the team to design missions that did not have to be done in a linear order. The level was planned to be featured in the cancelled Halo film. It influenced the design of future games in the series, such as the level design of Halo: Reach, due to its combination of on-foot and vehicle action, forcing players to board and exit vehicles as they traversed the level. Reach featured a level called The Long Night of Solace which was said to be \"a retread of The Silent Cartographer\", but which was praised by IGN for being more \"epic\" and \"apocalyptic\". The level also received a \"spiritual successor\" in the Warzone multiplayer mode of Halo 5: Guardians, with a level called Raid on Apex 7 that features a similar environment. == Reception == GB Burford of Kotaku called the level \"superb\", with a \"constant sense that you're making progress as you proceed through the level\". He states that while the level's generous use of checkpoints gives the impression of the player being on the attack, they are also vulnerable due to being alone for a large part of the level. Alex Dale of GamesRadar+ called the level one that bucked the trend of \"tight, claustrophobic corridors\" and \"blew the walls wide open\", \"offering the kind of freeform, tactical warfare fans could only dream about at the time.\" David Houghton of the same website called the level's design \"bogglingly non-linear brilliance\", saying that 13 years later free-roaming shooter series were still trying to catch up. Matt Whittaker of Hardcore Gamer called the level \"one of the most iconic missions in the entire series, as it blends Warthog play, labyrinthine interior sections and a blend of every type of Covenant enemy present in Halo: Combat Evolved\", praising the improved visual clarity of the Hunter aliens as the best improvement to the level in Halo: The Master Chief Collection. Jonathon Dornbrush of Entertainment Weekly ranked The Silent Cartographer the best level in Halo: Combat Evolved, calling it \"an impressively long but rarely tedious mission that employs all of Halo's best elements, while also introducing the brutality of Hunters.\" Speedrunner Andrew \"Goatrope\" Halabourda noted that in 2004, \"The Silent Cartographer\" was the most popular single level in Halo to speedrun. == References == Category:Video game levels Category:Halo (franchise) ",
