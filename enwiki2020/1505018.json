    "text": "The Commission on Higher Education () of the Philippines, abbreviated as CHED, is a government agency attached to the Office of the President of the Philippines for administrative purposes. It covers both public and private higher education institutions as well as degree-granting programs in all post- secondary educational institutions in the country. ==History== The CHED was established on May 18, 1994 through Republic Act No. 7722 or the Higher Education Act of 1994 which was authored by Senator Francisco Tatad. The creation of CHED was part of a broad agenda for reforms in the country's education system, outlined by the Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM) in 1992. Part of the reforms is the trifocalization of the education sector. The three governing bodies in the education sector are the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for tertiary and graduate education, the Department of Education (DepEd) for basic education, and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) for technical-vocational and middle level education. ==Chairman== The Chairman of CHED is also the Chairperson of the Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines System. Carlito Puno was the chairman from 2005. In 2007, Romulo Neri was appointed Chairman. He was the Director General of the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and Socioeconomic Secretary and a former Budget Secretary.

Centers of Development (COD) on the other hand, are educational disciplines that have been considered to significantly improve over the course of the previous year. These provide institutional leadership in all aspects of development in specific areas of discipline in the various regions by providing networking arrangements to help ensure the accelerated development of Higher Educational Institutions in their respective service areas. ==Dissemination of Information by CHED== CHED disseminates information by a variety of means. For information specific to a particular institution, a letter is sent to that institution, or an officer is invited to collect it at CHED main office. The institution may then place a copy of the order on one of its own noticeboards, if the order is favorable. CHED also maintains a website where some of its policy documents are made available. CHED issues CMOs \u2013 CHED Memorandum Orders. These are often of national significance.CHED Policies and Guidelines ==See also== *Higher education in the Philippines *Professional Regulation Commission ==External links== * Category:Higher education in the Philippines Category:Government agencies under the Office of the President of the Philippines Category:Government agencies established in 1994 Category:Higher education authorities Category:Regulation in the Philippines ",
