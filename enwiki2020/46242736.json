    "text": "Assassination () is a 2015 South Korean espionage action film co-written and directed by Choi Dong-hoon. The film is currently the eighth-highest-grossing movie in Korean film history with over 12.7 million admissions. ==Plot== In 1911, during Japan's rule over Korea, a resistance fighter named Yem Sek-jin tries but fails to murder the governor-general along with a pro-Japanese businessman named Kang In-guk. That evening, Kang discovers that his own wife was helping Yem, and kills her. In response, the wet nurse runs off with one of Kang's twin daughters. By 1933, there are over 30 Korean independence factions operating in Korea, China, and Manchuria. Yem has become a captain in one of these factions, but his colleagues are unaware that he is secretly reporting to the Japanese, since back in 1911 he was tortured by the Japanese into submission. Yem meets with some Korean politicians in Hangzhou, including Kim Koo and Kim Won-bong, and is asked to gather three delinquent resistance members\u2014Big Gun, Duk-sam, and Ahn Okyun\u2014so they can enter Seoul and assassinate Kang, along with a general named Kawaguchi Mamoru. After bringing them to Shanghai, however, Yem sells this information to the Japanese. The Japanese attempt to find Ahn, but a skilled contract-killer named Hawaii Pistol decides, on the spur of the moment, to pretend that Ahn is his wife, allowing her to elude the soldiers. The members travel to Seoul and gather at Cafe Anemone. They plan to ambush their targets at a gas station, where they can avoid heading on with military escorts. Ahn heads to a department store to buy a pair of spectacles. Kang's daughter Mitsuko, who is engaged to Kawaguchi's son Shunsuke, happens to see Ahn and gives chase, but fails to catch up to her. She relays the incident to the family butler, who insists that her twin sister had died years ago. Even so, he goes to the department store and learns of Ahn's address from the spectacle shop. Kim Koo questions Yem's loyalty, and tells two subordinates, Myung-woo and Se-gwang, to follow him around, and to kill him if he is a spy. However, when they follow him to his meeting with Hawaii Pistol, Yem manages to kill them in the ensuing gun fight. Yem meets with Hawaii Pistol and hires him to intercept and kill the three resistance members, lying to Hawaii Pistol by saying that they are Japanese spies. Yem anticipates a great reward from the Japanese. As Hawaii Pistol and his assistant Buddy travel to Seoul, they befriend Shunsuke, who is a lieutenant in the Kwantung Army. In Seoul, Hawaii Pistol locates Big Gun and shoots him as he is running. With Big Gun missing, Duk-sam and Ahn proceed with the operation. To their misfortune, the car is a decoy and both Duk-sam and Korean sympathizer Kimura are killed in the attempt. In the ensuing chaos, Ahn is ambushed by Hawaii Pistol, who recognizes her and fails to kill her. Ahn finds Mitsuko struggling to escape the car, and freezes on the spot upon seeing that she looks exactly like her. At this moment, she suffers a gunshot to her arm and is knocked out by a soldier. Ahn wakes up locked up in a truck, and handcuffed with Hawaii Pistol, who was also caught while trying to leave the scene. She questions his motive in ruining their mission, and he replies that he was hired to kill her, Mitsuko. Ahn recognizes the name as Kang's daughter, and realizes that she is Kang's missing twin daughter. They decide to share a kiss to provoke the soldiers into unlocking the gate, and successfully fight off the soldiers. Buddy arrives on a motorbike and shoots down the other police cars. Hawaii Pistol takes over the wheel and drives to a hospital to treat Ahn's wound. There, she learns of Yem's betrayal from Hawaii Pistol. Hawaii Pistol learns of Ahn's identity and decides to spare her, sympathizing with her mission since he himself is a Korean. Yem visits Kang, and informs him that the assassin who attempted to kill him was his missing daughter. The family butler informs Kang of Ahn's address. Meanwhile, Mitsuko visits Ahn's apartment and meets Ahn. She offers Ahn new clothes, telling her she was glad to meet her despite wishing she was not an independence fighter, and asks her to reunite with the family. As they hear the sound of footsteps, Mitsuko tells Ahn to hide and that she has the authority to protect her as Shunsuke's fianc\u00e9e. Her father Kang, Yem and a group of soldiers enter and Kang kills her. The latter are none the wiser and believe they have successfully killed Ahn. After watching this in horror, Ahn escapes through the window. At this point, Ahn assumes Mitsuko's identity. In the Kang family's home, Ahn attempts to take one of the guard's guns one night but is caught by the butler. Sensing something amiss, he enters Mitsuko's bedroom and they engage in a fight. The butler gains the upper hand and tries to report Ahn, but she strangles him and hides the body under the bed. The following morning, Shunsuke introduces Hawaii Pistol to his wife and invites him to their wedding. Hawaii Pistol recognizes her as Ahn through her signals. Under the guise of casual talk, Ahn tells him in Korean of her plan to carry out the assassination during the wedding. Hawaii Pistol promises to attend the wedding. A few days later, Ahn enters the wedding as the bride, with a gun hidden in her bouquet. As she points the bouquet to Kang, Big Gun\u2014who survived his injuries\u2014 appears and carries out an attack on the wedding. In the confusion, Ahn kills Kawaguchi, which is witnessed by Big Gun, thus learning that the bride was in fact Ahn. Big Gun sees Yem, who was in attendance, and lets down his guard, not knowing of Yem's betrayal. Yem takes the chance and shoots him. Hawaii Pistol kills Kang when Ahn hesitates to do so, revealing that he killed his father, a Japanese sympathizer, and did not want Ahn to live with that and become a mercenary like him. Before they leave, Big Gun tells Ahn that she looked pretty in the dress, and dies from his injuries. As they leave while taking Shunsuke hostage, they are hemmed in by army reinforcements. Buddy arrives in a car and they escape to Cafe Anemone. Hawaii Pistol kills Shunsuke, and they decide to escape through an underground tunnel. Hawaii Pistol, realizing that she can still pose as her twin, shares a kiss with Ahn, promising to meet her again in the cafe they met in Shanghai. Ahn walks out and is rescued by the Japanese soldiers\u2014she later absconds back to Shanghai. Hawaii Pistol and the Buddy attempt to escape but Yem kills them. For his services to Japan, Yem is made head of the secret police. However, the Japanese are defeated in World War II and Korea is liberated. In 1949, a commission for war crimes investigates Yem\u2014now a senior officer with the Korean police\u2014who protests his innocence and points to his resistance service. The only witness to Yem's guilt is found murdered, so the charges are dropped. Even so, Yem is cornered on the streets by Ahn and Myung-woo, who survived his injuries earlier in the film but was rendered mute and slightly disfigured. They proceed to shoot Yem until he dies. Ahn sadly recalls her friends in the Resistance, Hawaii Pistol and Buddy before the screen fades out. ==Cast== *Jun Ji-hyun as dual roles Ahn Okyun and Mitsuko *Lee Jung-jae as Yem Sek-jin *Ha Jung-woo as \"Hawaii Pistol\" *Oh Dal-su as \"Buddy\" *Cho Jin-woong as Chu Sang- ok AKA \"Big Gun\" *Choi Deok-moon as Hwang Duk-sam *Lee Geung-young as Kang In- guk *Kim Eui-sung as Butler of Kang family *Park Byung-eun as Kawaguchi Shunsuke *Jin Kyung as Ahn Seong-sim *Heo Ji-won as Myung-woo *Kim Hong-pa as Kim Koo *Jung Gyu-soo as Hunchback *Kim Kang-woo as Special investigator *Shim Cheol-jong as Kawaguchi Mamoru *Han Dong-gyu as Police chief *Jeong Gi-seop as Military police leader *Jung In-gyeom as Sasaki *Lee Hwan as Se-gwang *Tamura Hiroto as Kimura *Lee Young-seok as Terauchi Masatake *Shim Hee-seop as Public prosecutor *Yoon Jong-gu as Anti-National Crimes Special Committee investigator *Hong Won-gi as Judge *Heo Jeong-do as Consulate employee *Woo Sang-jeon as Ye Wanyong *Cho Seung-woo as Kim Won-bong (special appearance) *Kim Hae-sook as Cafe Anemone owner (special appearance) *Hong Seong-deok as Dentist *Kim Joon-woo as Sontag Hotel manager ==Production== With a budget of (or ), Assassination filmed in both Shanghai and Seoul for five months.

The film earned at the Chinese box office. ===Critical reception=== Assassination has received mixed to positive reviews, holding an 88% \"Certified Fresh\" on Rotten Tomatoes, most reviews of which praises the film's entertainment value but criticizes its length and complicated narrative. Village Voices Simon Abrams found the film's highlights to be during its lighthearted scenes, and summarized Assassination as \"the kind of overstuffed historical mega-production that Hollywood doesn't make anymore.\" Although lamenting the film's characters and running time, Screen Daily's Jason Bechervaise praised Choi Dong-hoon's direction and his execution of the movie's action sequences. The Washington City Paper praised the film as a \"revelation for Korean cinema and a rediscovery of form.\" The New York Times Jeanette Catsoulis also praised the film's action scenes, but argued that its screenplay contained too many characters and surmised that \"it's possible to follow [Assassination] without taking notes, but I wouldn't recommend it.\" Similarly, The Hollywood Reporters Clarence Tsui admired the high production values of the film, but heavily disapproved of its poor characterizations and Choi's approach to the historical film genre, particularly labeling the film's ending as \"half-baked commentary.\" ==Plagiarism lawsuit== On August 10, 2015, novelist Choi Jong-rim filed a lawsuit against director Choi Dong-hoon, production company Caper Film and distributor Showbox, alleging that various elements from Assassination, including the setting and the female protagonist, highly resemble those of his book Korean Memories, published in 2003. Choi is seeking ( (exchange rate 2016.05.04)) in damages. Caper Film denied those claims, rebutting that the female character in Choi's novel is not a sniper, and that assassination schemes were common in the anti-Japanese movement. Seoul Central District Court rejected Choi's request for an injunction to stop the film from being shown in theaters, ruling on August 19, 2015 that an abstract summary cannot be protected by copyright laws, the female protagonists in the novel and the film are \"depicted in completely different ways\" with the assassination plan not a major plot point in the novel, and that supporting characters Kim Koo and Kim Won-bong are real historical figures and hence cannot be viewed as a source of similarity between the two works. ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
