    "text": "Yod\u014fk County is a county in South Hamgy\u014fng province, North Korea. Originally part of Y\u014fngh\u016dng county (now K\u016dmya County), it became a separate entity as part of the 1952 reorganization of local government. ==Physical features== Most of the county is mountainous. Yod\u014fk is traversed by the Rangrim and Puktaebong ranges. The chief river is the Ryongh\u016dng. The highest point is Raganbong. Roughly 90% of the county's area is forestland. ==Administrative divisions== Yod\u014fk county is divided into 1 \u016dp (town) and 21 ri (villages): {| |- | valign=\"top\" | * Yod\u014fk-\u016dp * Ch'\u014fnh\u016dng-ri * H\u016dngsang-ri * Hyangbong-ri * Inh\u016dng-ri * Inhwa-ri * Ku\u016dp-ri * Kwanp'y\u014fng-ri * Misam-ri * Mun'am-ri * P'y\u014fngj\u014fl-li | valign=\"top\" | * P'y\u014fngw\u014fl-li * Rips\u014fng-ri * Ryangsu-ri * Ryongp'y\u014fng-ri * S\u014fng-ri * S\u014fngch'\u014fl-li * Songdo-ri * Taesung-ri * Tongsal-li * Unh\u016dng-ri * Wansal-li |} ==Economy== Due to the rugged terrain, agriculture is nearly impossible.
