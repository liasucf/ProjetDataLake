His brother is Hugh Sebag-Montefiore, and his great-great- uncle, is Sir Moses Montefiore. His mother, Phyllis April Jaff\u00e9, comes from the Lithuanian branch of the Jaffe family. Her parents fled the Russian Empire at the beginning of the 20th century. They bought tickets for New York City, but were cheated, being instead dropped off at Cork, Ireland. Due to the Limerick boycott in 1904 Montefiore's maternal grandfather Henry Jaff\u00e9 left the country and moved to Newcastle upon Tyne, England. The Montefiore family are descended from a line of wealthy Sephardi Jews who were diplomats and bankers all over Europe and who originated from Morocco and Italy. After the Alhambra Decree was issued against the Jews in Spain of 1492, some of Montefiore's ancestors stayed in the country whilst remaining secretly Jewish. During the reign of Philip II of Spain, one of them became governor of a province of Mexico, where he and his family were denounced by a political rival and tortured by the Inquisition. Two teenaged girls were burned alive in Mexico City while a son escaped to Italy and changed his name to Montefiore. Montefiore was educated at Ludgrove School and Harrow School where he was editor of the school newspaper, The Harrovian; he interviewed Margaret Thatcher for The Harrovian in the autumn of 1983. He won an Exhibition to read history at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge where he received his Doctorate of Philosophy (PhD). ==Career== Montefiore worked as a banker, a foreign affairs journalist, and a war correspondent covering the conflicts during the fall of the Soviet Union.
