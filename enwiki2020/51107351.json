    "text": "Professor Patrick Joseph Nolan (11 August 1894 \u2013 28 December 1984) was an Irish physicist. Like his older brother, physicist John James Nolan, he specialised in atmospheric physics. In 1971, he was awarded the Boyle Medal by the Royal Dublin Society.Boyle Medal Laureates Royal Dublin SocietyNational Library Of Australia Catalogue Award of the Boyle medal to Patrick J. Nolan He was born in Omagh, County Tyrone, and educated at University College Dublin. He earned a BSc in 1914, coming first in his class, and an MSc followed in 1915. A National University of Ireland travelling studentship in experimental physics (awarded in 1917) facilitated his spending some time doing research at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge\u2013at that time led by Ernest Rutherford.The Royal Dublin Society: Patrick J. Nolan In 1922, he married Una Hurley from near Bantry, County Cork, a younger sister of his brother John's wife. The couple had no children. He was an uncle of abstract painter Evin Nolan. From 1921 to 1928 he held the post of Lecturer on Experimental Physics at St Patrick's College in Maynooth. He spent the rest of his career at UCD, having been awarded his PhD there in 1922. In the 1930s and 1940s, he worked alongside his brother John, and numerous post graduate students, studying ionization, and atmospheric electrical parameters. He was appointed Professor of Geophysics in 1954, and retired in 1964.University Review University College Dublin, Vol 1, No 3 (Winter, 1954/1955), pp. 93-96, Published by: Edinburgh University Press His publications included papers on the charge equilibrium of nuclei as it relates to the Boltzmann law, the combination of ions and nuclei, and the determination of the recombination coefficient of small ions.McCartney and Whitaker (2003), p. 182: These investigations set in train a line of research on atmospheric electricity and aerosols that was continued by the Nolan brothers, and had a profound influence on physics research in Ireland in the twentieth century. Patrick J. Nolan is best remembered for the 1940s development of the Photoelectric Nucleus Counter with his UCD colleague L. W. Pollak.O'Connor (2001) This counter was long the standard instrument for the measurement of cloud condensation nuclei.National Library of Australia Catalogue The photoelectric nucleus counter / Patrick J.
