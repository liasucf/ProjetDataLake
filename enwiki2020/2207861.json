    "text": "Power density is the amount of power (time rate of energy transfer) per unit volume. In energy transformers including batteries, fuel cells, motors, etc., and also power supply units or similar, power density refers to a volume. It is then also called volume power density, which is expressed as W/m3. In reciprocating internal combustion engines, power density\u2014power per swept volume or brake horsepower per cubic centimeter \u2014is an important metric. This is based on the internal capacity of the engine, not its external size. ==Examples== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! Storage material !!
