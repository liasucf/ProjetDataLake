    "text": "was a lakeside castle in the Sengoku period, located in \u014ctsu, Shiga Prefecture, Japan. Akechi Mitsuhide was the commander of the castle. ==History== After the Siege of Mount Hiei, Sakamoto was given to Akechi Mitsuhide who built Sakamoto Castle under orders from the warlord Oda Nobunaga because Sakamoto was a strategically important place to rule. Lu\u00eds Fr\u00f3is described the castle as the second best castle in Japan at the time. After the loss of Battle of Yamazaki, Mitsuhide tried to return to the castle but he was killed on the way. Surrounded by Toyotomi's army, Mitsuhide's adopted son Akechi Hidemitsu set fire to the castle and killed himself. In 1583, Sakamoto castle was given to Niwa Nagahide and he rebuilt the castle. In 1586, Asano Nagamasa abandoned the castle and moved to \u014ctsu Castle by Toyotomi Hideyoshi's order. (Stones and materials were transferred to \u014ctsu Castle.) Nowadays nothing remains of the original castle, and a statue of Akechi Mitsuhide stands in Sakamoto Castle's park. (Low stone wall remains in the Lake Biwa and can be seen when the water level drops.) A gate from Sakamoto Castle was relocated to Saiky\u014d-ji Temple near the castle. (Akechi clan's tombs are also at Saiky\u014d-ji Temple.) ==Gallery== Sakamotojo01.jpg|Monument of Sakamoto Castle Sakamotojo05.jpg|Monument of Sakamoto Castle Honmaru base Sakamotojo06.jpg|Monument of Sakamoto Castle Ninomaru base Saikyoji02.jpg|Former Sakamoto Castle's gate (Gate of Saikyo-ji Temple) Sakamotojo08.jpg|View from Sakamoto Castle park ==References== ==External links== * Sakamoto Castle by Otsu city official Category:Castles in Shiga Prefecture Category:Former castles in Japan Category:Ruined castles in Japan Category:Oda clan Category:Water castles Category:Akechi clan Category:1570s establishments in Japan ",
