    "text": "The Second Genoese\u2013Savoyard War (1672-1673) was a short war fought between the Duchy of Savoy and the Italian Republic of Genoa. The war was launched by Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy, in 1672,Geoffrey Symcox, Victor Amadeus II: absolutism in the Savoyard State, 1675-1730. International Crisis Behavior Series (University of California Press, 1983), 80. but an exiled Genoese named Rafaello della Torre had initially prompted Charles Emmanuel into declaring war.Edmund Ludlow, The memoirs of Edmund Ludlow, lieutenant-general of the horse in the army of the commonwealth of England, 1625-1672, Volume 2. Editor: Charles Harding Firth (Clarendon Press, 1894), 438n. Charles Emmanuel believed that Spain, engaged in hostilities with France in the Franco-Dutch War, would not assist Genoa.Ciro Paoletti, A military history of Italy. (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008), 34. Charles Emmanuel\u2019s declaration of war was based on pretexts that were \u201cslight and trivial,\u201d and it was evident that his reasons for going to war were to gain the seaport of Savona. The Savoyards initially had the upper hand, as the attack on Genoa was unexpected,Joseph Sayer, Samuel Pufendorf (Freiherr von), Antoine Augustin Bruzen de La Martini\u00e8re, An introduction to the history of the principal states of Europe, Volume 2 (Publisher: Printed for A. Wilde, 1764, 27. and the Savoyards occupied Pieve di Teco \u201cand some other Places; but these were soon recovered.\u201d Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy Despite Charles Emmanuel's predictions, the Genoese did receive aid from Spain. The Savoyards under the Marquis of Catalan marched to Castelvecchio di Rocca Barbena with plans to fortify it. The Genoese opposed them with a force of 9,000 men and seized all the roads, before the Savoyards could provision themselves. As a result, about 300 Savoyard officers and men departed from Castelvecchio. The remaining forces were overrun on August 15, 1672 by the Genoese. Some inconclusive battles followed, including a struggle for control of Oneglia. The Genoese advanced towards Oneglia with plans to attack by sea and land, but the Savoyards prevented them. ==End of war and aftermath== Louis XIV of France intervened diplomatically in the war to protect French interests. Louis XIV wanted to end the war between Savoy and Genoa before Charles Emmanuel could be completely defeated and a new front of the Franco-Dutch War could be opened in Italy. Under the mediation of France, peace was concluded at the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint- Germain-en-Laye on January 18, 1673. Both sides returned whatever conquests that they had made. According to George Procter, the war \u201cscarcely merits our notice, for its circumstances and its conclusion were alike insignificant.\u201dGeorge Procter, The history of Italy: from the fall of the Western empire to the commencement of the wars of the French revolution, Volume 2. (G. B. Whittaker, 1825), 506. However, the war had deleterious effects on the Duchy of Savoy. Since the war ended in defeat for Savoy, \u201ca bitter search for scapegoats followed,\u201d including Marchese di Pianezza, who had a prominent role in this war and was the duke's chief advisor. Pianezza was accused of treason and fled to France.Geoffrey Symcox, Victor Amadeus II: absolutism in the Savoyard State, 1675-1730. International Crisis Behavior Series (University of California Press, 1983), 85-6. Savoy\u2019s 1672 war with Genoa also caused civil unrest: it had disrupted trade and resulted in the Savoyard government\u2019s program to levy tolls on goods entering the territory of Mondov\u00ec. In 1684, French naval forces would bombard Genoa for its support of Spain. ==See also== *First Genoese\u2013Savoyard War == References == Category:Wars involving the Republic of Genoa Category:History of Savoy Category:Conflicts in 1672 Category:Conflicts in 1673 Category:1670s conflicts Category:1672 in Europe Category:1673 in Europe Category:History of Liguria Category:1672 in Italy Category:1673 in Italy ",
