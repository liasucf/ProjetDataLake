Freelance models are sometimes frowned upon in the model building community, although the adopted material is in reduced scale, they are not models of existing items, but are designed by the model builder. Due to the lower cost (no licensing fees etc.), this type of model is quite popular in the United States. In Europe, it has yet to catch on, although there are a few companies with freelance model lines. == Freelance Companies == === Railway === * FTL - Ferrovie e Tranvie Locali - Local Railroads and Tramways * Beetrains * SAFF - Societ\u00e0 Anonima Ferrovie Federate - Joint-stock company Federate Railroads * So.Ge.R.I.T. * SITAV Societ\u00e0 Intermodale Trasporti Alta Valle - High Valley Intermodal Society Transport * FRA Ferrovie Regionali dell'Appennino - Regional Railways of Apennine === Bus === * SAFF - Societ\u00e0 Anonima Ferrovie Federate - Joint-stock company Federate Railroads Category:Scale modeling ",
