Over ten years Kara collected specimens. Exploring, alone, deep into the Tarra Valley vegetation and frequently into dangerous areas where the best-unspoilt specimens were and the egg laying nests of the lyrebird could be found. Kara became one with the natural environment around her. By 1961 Kara had collected over 160 specimens which included types of toadstool and fungi. Significantly, two new types of fungi were named after her \u2013 Poria healeyi and Lambertella healeyi. Poria healeyi,Scientific Publication \"Transactions of the British Mycological Society\".

Further, Kara collected animal and insect specimens using dead animals that she found and forwarded those as well. In total over 500 specimens were collected which also included 80 species of moss.

Travel Extra 13 Article title:- Love Affair with a Valley. Written by Mary Ryllis Clark Kara also contributed specimens to the National Museum of Victoria, the University of Melbourne and the National Herbarium. Kara became quite a celebrity through newspaper articles about her and her work, and she was acquainted with many of the leading naturalists of the day. Walters and a colleague visited Mrs Healey, as she was known, had vivid memories of her little cottage. The scientists and Kara had endless conversations regarding the natural flora and fauna of the area and Kara showed the scientists examples of where specimens were collected. Kara observed and noted the activities of the birds and animals within the park. Particularly the mating habits of the Lyrebird where the male lyre bird constructs mounds by scratching the earth, sticks and other debris into areas where he then performs his dance with his magnificent tail feathers on display to attract a female. Kara sketched all the specimens, animals and birds within the park. Photography was also used in latter years to record the specimens in their natural state. Kara had the films made into \"slides\" which was state of the art at the time. All of Kara's specimens and photographic libraries were handed over to Parks Victoria who have since restored, converted to digital and archived all salvageable items. At times Kara's house was an animal hospital as she rescued orphaned wombats, possums, birds and other animals, which were returned to the wild when they recovered or grew old enough to fend for themselves. Her duties at the Park included sweeping the tracks daily as the animals and birds plus the natural fall a debris covered the tracks. Visitors were greeted and the parking fee collected. As word spread in the naturalist world car loads and bus loads of people came to the park. Kara delivered a nature talk describing the plants and animals within the park. Occasionally she would summon a wild bird from high up in the tree to fly to her hand to collect a reward.Publication - Book. Triumph over the Heartbreak Hills 1880 - 2009. Published 7 February 2009.
