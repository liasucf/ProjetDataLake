So he wanted to bring Marimar from the island to his family and introduce her as his bride. They were married by fake marriage by a judge, but soon married for real in a church. Eventually, Sergio fell for Marimar. When Sergio left for a business project, Angelika plotted and made her assistant, Nicandro burn down Pancho and Cruz's seaside hut. Through Marimar's eyes, she thinks Sergio abandoned her because of the fake picture, letter, and lies that Angelika, Antonia, and Nicandro planned.

She decides to go find the former mayordoma of the Santiba\u00f1ez hacienda and her close friend Corazon, who is now working in a jewelry manufacturer company after Angelika fired her. She entered the jewelry factory as well. When the boss of the company, Esperanza, found out that Marimar is pregnant, she tried to fire Marimar. But, she discontinued it after Marimar saved her from a fake pearl scam. Then, the strict and bad daughter of Esperanza, Innocencia (LJ Reyes), came when Marimar accidentally spilt the pearls when she was coming. Innocencia slipped and blamed Marimar even though she didn't plan it. Next came Mia, who unknown to Marimar was her mother.

After coming back to the Philippines, her revenge started. But as Sergio still believe it is Marimar, he stalked her all the time. Bella even say he's crazy but he doesn't care. In the day they were kidnapped, Sergio saved Bella where their lives get even closer. In the Santiba\u00f1ez mansion, Nicandro and Angelika were having sex and caught by Renato (Ricardo Cepeda). Then Renato was shot in the head by Nicandro who was told to do so by Angelika. Meanwhile, Mia and Gustavo got back to each other and Bella was very happy. In the hospital, Renato miraculously survived the incident but was comatosed and he was being tried to kill by Nicandro but Sergio arrived and the crime did not get pushed through. Angelika's credit card were all denied so she could not buy a cake, then the gorgeous Bella Aldama whom Angelika did not know is Marimar arrived. Angelika wanted Bella to die so he asked Nicandro to plant a bomb in Bella's car. Accidentally, Mia and Gustavo were inside the car and they were the ones who died. Bella then accused her ex-step mother Brenda who ordered it. Bella knew that Brenda is not that bad to kill a person, when Angelika came in the funeral, she attacked Bella and got a scar in her face. Then Angelika plans revenge on Bella by telling Nicandro her evil plan. But Bella had also planned a big plan to bring Angelika down. She asked Rodolfo (James Blanco) to kidnap Nicandro. Nicandro has been tortured and forced to admit if he was the one who killed Mia and Gustavo and who asked him to do that evil plan. To be free, he tells Rodolfo that Angelika is the one. Meanwhile, The Santiba\u00f1ez lose their money and Bella bought the Isla Santiba\u00f1ez, Angelika's resort and named it to Isla Aldama. And as part of Bella's revenge, she also dropped the key of the resort on the mud and ask Angelika to get it just using her mouth in exchange of bringing the resort back to them. Bella did not bring it back to her still. In the other hand, Cappuccina (Solenn Heussaff) and Rodolfo broke up thinking that it's because of Bella. Capppuccina got drunk and accidentally told Antonia that Marimar and Bella is only one. Cruzita is getting closer to her tito and while she is sleeping, Corazon and Bella were talking about getting Cruzita far away from Sergio and Cruzita heard that her tito is her biological father. Cruzita escapes from the mansion and fell down into a hole then some men found her and brought her to the hospital. There, Cruzita and Sergio met once again. Sergio saw Fulgoso (Boobay) with Corazon which makes him approach Bella and while Sergio and Bella were talking to each other, she was forced by him to say that she and Marimar is only one because Sergio saw Natalia (Maricris Garcia), Choi (Mikoy Morales), Corazon, Padre Sito (Cris Villanueva), and now Fulgoso. As Bella was being forced, she can't hide the truth and revealed the fact. Meanwhile, Sergio already knows the truth about Angelika and Nicandros affair so he threw Angelika, Nicandro, Perfecta (Candy Pangilinan) and Antonia away. Angelika then went to Renato's room to say sorry to be his wife again so that they can have money to use but their plan did not work. Bella fakes the truth by going to another hospital but just in a different room, Sergio saw Corazon go to Cruzita's room. While Corazon was gone, Sergio meets Cruzita and she calls him daddy, then the truth was out. Bella tells Sergio that when she was still an island girl, Marimar, Angelika tortured her in the mansion. She gets mad at Sergio again and was betrayed by Antonia then told Sergio to get out of their lives forever. Angelika vowed revenge to Bella with the help of Nicandro, her affair. They planned to put a hole with a tiger inside it, but the plan fails. Angelika herself was the one who got bitten by the tiger, which caused her to lose her right hand. After that, Antonia got angry and now plans to revenge out of what Bella has done to Angelika, her mother. On the other hand, Rodolfo wants Bella back to her. But his plan fails when Sergio again proposed with Marimar, now as Bella Aldama. As the story continues, Antonia got pregnant and told Sergio that he is the father. She uses her baby to make Sergio back to him, but Bella did not let that happen. Antonia follows them to the mall to see Sergio. But Bella was the only one in the mall. Meanwhile, Bella and Antonia had an intense catfight until Antonia fall on the stairs. In that case, the doctor told them that Antonia is not really pregnant. All people are surprised because Antonia passed the pregnancy test and the doctor then told them that it's just an illusion pregnancy. After that, they kidnapped Cruzita just to revenge of what happen to her believing that they killed her \"so-called imaginary baby\". They got Cruzita back to them. Bella accidentally put the bomb on the helicopter Angelika and Antonia rides on. They thought the remote was with them and the bomb was left with the ground. But what they thought is a big BLUFF. The remote was left in the ground and the bomb was inside their helicopter. Fulgoso accidentally switched the remote on and caused the two to explode with the helicopter.
