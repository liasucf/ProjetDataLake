    "text": "Alexander James Mellor (born 22 July 1991) is an English cricketer who most recently played for Warwickshire. He is a left-handed batsman who also plays as a wicket-keeper. ==Cricket career== Mellor joined Warwickshire from Staffordshire at the end of the 2015 season. On 28 July 2016, Mellor joined Derbyshire on loan from Warwickshire, after regular wicket-keeper Harvey Hosein fractured his thumb. He made his Twenty20 debut for Derbyshire, on 29 July 2016, against Durham. During the 2017 season, Warwickshire recalled Mellor as back up to the injured Tim Ambrose. However, having also been promoted to open the batting he was unable to take his opportunity, and averaged just 9.83 across three country championship matches. Mellor is best known for his role in the famous cricket incident \u201cThe Prediction\u201d. This is where Stephen Gribble predicted his downfall on the 7th ball of his innings. Gribble underestimated his own ability and took him down on the 6th ball with help of an absolute screamer in second slip from Nick Jensen ==References== ==External links== * * * Alex Mellor at Warwickshire County Cricket Club Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:English cricketers Category:Staffordshire cricketers Category:Warwickshire cricketers Category:Derbyshire cricketers Category:Sportspeople from Stoke-on-Trent ",
