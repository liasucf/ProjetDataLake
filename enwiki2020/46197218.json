    "text": "The American International School of Jeddah (AISJ; ), or the \"American School\" in short, is an international school with American curriculum in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Established in 1952, the American International School of Jeddah is a U.S. accredited Pre-K - 12 college preparatory institution.\" \" ( ). ==History== It opened in 1952 as the Parent Cooperative School (PCS), with an initial class of 40 students. The school opened to serve children of Trans World Airlines (TWA) employees brought to Saudi Arabia to establish Saudia Airlines, as well as other children. The lack of a formal American curriculum school in Jeddah was an issue TWA employees faced because they needed schools for their children. Parents then formed the Parents Cooperative School (PCS, founded in 1952), in which they volunteered to teach students using a home school curriculum. When the expatriate community kept expanding with time, the school began to notice a rapid growth, and therefore built a new facility in 1968, and again in 1975. In 1976, the North Campus (NCS) was built (by the Raytheon compound) in order to accommodate the rising number of students. By 1985 the school changed its name to Saudi Arabian International School (SAIS), and by the year 2000\u20132001, it had its first 12th grade graduation, becoming the first international school in Jeddah that had a diploma program. Until 2004, the school was under the direct auspices and sponsorship of Saudia Airlines, children whose parents are expatriate workers for Saudia Airlines such as pilots and engineers go to school at SAIS where mostly live in Saudia City, Khaledeyah district, as the housing compound of Saudia Airlines expatriates. After 2004, The school changed its name once again to the American International School of Jeddah (AISJ) after Saudia officially announced that they would no longer continue their sponsorship of the school, due to their need to focus solely on the airline business. Since 2005, the school has been run as an independent not-for-profit entity. ==Accreditation and affiliations== As of 2020, the school is accredited and/or in partnership with the following associations: *The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Education *Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools (MSA-CESS) *Near East South Asian Council of Overseas Schools (NESA) *American School Counselor Association (ASCA) *Principals Training Center (PTC) ==Facilities== In January 2019, AISJ moved to its new purposefully-built campus in the up-and-coming Mohammadiyah District.
