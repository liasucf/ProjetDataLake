    "text": "Harold Becker (born September 25, 1928) is an American film and television director, producer, and photographer from New York, associated with the New Hollywood movement and best known for his work in the thriller genre. His body of work includes films like The Onion Field, Taps, The Boost, Sea of Love, Malice, City Hall and Mercury Rising. ==Biography== Early life Becker was born on September 25, 1928 in The Bronx, New York City. His father, who had emigrated from Russia as a boy, worked as a tailor following his service in the U.S. Calvary during World War I. His mother, also a Russian immigrant, was a homemaker. Becker was the second of three children, and their only son. From his earliest memories, he had always wanted to be an artist, and exhibited a talent for drawing at an early age. After high school, Becker attended the Pratt Institute to study Fine Art, but his education wasn\u2019t limited to school alone. Post-war New York had replaced Paris as the capital of the art world. It was home of the international avant-garde, and the birthplace of an emerging movement, later known as Abstract Expressionism, which would revolutionize Western art. This was a stimulating environment for young artists like Becker. He was part of a generation of young New Yorkers who, in the coming decades, would be at the center of American art, photography, and design. Graduating with a degree in Fine Art in 1949, he briefly taught school before finding work as a freelance illustrator. Many of his earliest jobs were designing book jackets and magazine covers for such luminaries as Herb Lubalin, Gene Frederico, Lou Dorfsman, Art Kane, and Henry Wolf at Esquire. His work caught the attention of New York fashion photographer Jerry Plucer- Sarna, who paired Becker with experienced assistant, and gave him access to his studio and equipment. It was an invaluable experience, and changed the trajectory of his career. After remaining with Plucer-Sarna for two years, he felt sufficiently skilled and confident to strike out on his own. Becker quickly made a name for himself as both a commercial and editorial photographer. His Madison Avenue clients included Young & Rubicam, Doyle Dane, Bernbach, Ogilvy, Benson & Mather, and BBDO. where he would meet, and befriend, a very young Jerry Bruckheimer. It was during this period that Becker also began making short, experimental films that played at the city\u2019s art house theaters. The art houses were the main venues for the new European cinema that was causing a sensation with post-war audiences for its realism and dramatic intensity. Films by Italian neorealists such as Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio De Sica, Luchino Visconti, and later, Pier Paolo Pasolini, had a powerful impact upon Becker as a young man and would later inform his mature film work. Despite this growing interest film, Becker had yet to consider it as a career. But the shorts did pave the way for his later documentary work, as well as help him prepare for his next move into the emerging field of television commercials. His first jobs in commercial production were as a \u201clighting consultant.\u201d In television\u2019s early years, there were as yet no established commercial directors; the commercials were often helmed by industrial filmmakers with little experience in advertising. Initially, Becker was brought in to help add polish and a sense of visual design to their work. But it quickly became apparent to the agencies that the young photographers who shot their print ads, people like Becker and his friend Howard Zieff, were in fact a much better fit for the new medium. In these early days of commercial production, there was still considerable creative freedom and room for experiment-ation. Becker used this opportunity to further develop his filmmaking skills, directing dozens of commercials each year. By the early 1960s, he was at the top of the profession, shooting commercials for Volkswagen, General Motors, Pepsi-Cola, Revlon, and winning the first of many subsequent Clio Awards. Throughout the 1960\u2019s, Becker alternated between making commercials and the cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9-style documentaries Blind Gary Davis, Sighet, Sighet, and Ivanhoe Donaldson, which won the Gold Prize for short film at the Mannheim-Heidelberg International Film Festival. His commercial work often took him to England, which was in the midst of a social and cultural revolution. London, its epicenter, was exploding with creativity in music, fashion, and art. It was here that Becker decided to make his first feature film. ==Filmography== === Feature films === *The Ragman's Daughter (1972) - also producer *The Onion Field (1979) *The Black Marble (1980) *Taps (1981) *Vision Quest (1985) *The Big Town (1987) *The Boost (1988) - also co-executive producer *Sea of Love (1989) *Malice (1993) - also producer *City Hall (1996) - also producer *Mercury Rising (1998) *Domestic Disturbance (2001) - also producer *Vengeance: A Love Story (2017) - executive producer only The Ragman\u2019s Daughter (1972) Becker was living and working in England when he came across Alan Sillitoe\u2019s novella The Ragman\u2019s Daughter. Becker optioned the rights and hired Sillitoe to adapt the story into a screenplay. Produced in 1972, the film is a working-class drama about the daughter of a wealthy scrap merchant, who defies the rules of bourgeois society by venturing into a life of crime. The film was Victoria Tennant\u2019s screen debut, and the first of Becker\u2019s four collaborations with cinematographer Michael Seresin. The Ragman's Daughter would go onto win the Giovanni award for \u201cBest First Feature\u201d at the Venice Film Festival. Becker was in the middle of planning his next film, an adaptation of Jean Rhys' After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie starring Susannah York, when Britain went into recession and the domestic film market collapsed. It would be six more years before he got the opportunity to direct another feature. The Onion Field (1979) Becker\u2019s breakthrough film was The Onion Field, based on Joseph Wambaugh\u2019s best-selling account of the fatal kidnapping of two Los Angeles police detectives in 1963. It was the third of his books to be adapted for the screen. Unhappy with the two earlier efforts, Wambaugh made the decision to produce The Onion Field himself, and offered the film to Becker to direct. Initially, Becker was not entirely sure if the project was right for him. However, any misgivings he may have had were quickly dispelled by Joseph Wambaugh\u2019s great passion for the project. He was, he said, \u2018put on this Earth to write The Onion Field.' And with that, Becker committed to the film that would establish his career as a director in Hollywood. The Onion Field also helped launch the careers of Ted Danson, Franklyn Seales, and James Woods, who received Best Supporting Actor nominations from both the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor. The Black Marble (1980) Becker and Joseph Wambaugh\u2019s next collaboration was The Black Marble (1980), an off-beat black comedy about an alcoholic police detective having a mid-life crisis (Robert Foxworth), his high-strung partner (Paula Prentiss), and a cash-strapped veterinarian (Harry Dean Stanton), who stages a dog-napping to pay off gambling debts. While receiving some of the best reviews of Becker\u2019s career, The Black Marble did not meet with the same success as The Onion Field. Over the years, however, it has become something cult film, as well as a personal favorite of director Quentin Tarantino, who owns a personal copy of it. Taps (1981) In 1981, Becker directed Timothy Hutton, Sean Penn, Tom Cruise and George C. Scott in Taps, a tense, Darryl Ponicsan-scripted drama about young military cadets who take over their academy when they discover it is to be shuttered and sold to developers. The film was Hutton\u2019s first since receiving an Academy Award for Ordinary People. Taps also marked the feature film debuts of both Sean Penn and Tom Cruise. Originally, Cruise had been cast as an extra, but Becker was so impressed by his talent, and the intensity he brought to the rehearsals, that he offered the untried actor a leading role in the film. Vision Quest (1985) Following the success of Taps, where he demonstrated his skill working with young actors, Becker was hired to direct Vision Quest, a coming-of-age drama based on Terry Davis\u2019 1979 novel. Matthew Modine stars as a Spokane, Washington high school student, who is training for the state wrestling championship while he pursues a relationship with an older woman, played by Linda Fiorentino in her professional debut. The film is also notable for being Madonna\u2019s first appearance in a major motion picture. She plays a singer at a local nightclub, and performs the songs \"Gambler\u201d and \u201dCrazy for You,\u201d both of which were commissioned specifically for the film. Though still not widely known to the public when she was initially signed, Madonna\u2019s career was in full flight by the time of the film\u2019s release in 1985. To capitalize on her sudden fame, a number of foreign distributors changed the film\u2019s title to Crazy for You. Costumes for the film, including Madonna\u2019s fad-setting headband, were designed by Susan Becker, the director\u2019s wife, who would later serve as costume designer on such films as St. Elmo's Fire, The Lost Boys, Days of Thunder, Flatliners, Father of the Bride, and True Romance. The Boost (1988) - also co- executive producer Nearly a decade after they made The Onion Field, Becker and actor James Woods re-united to make The Boost (1988). Set in the boom economy of the Reagan Era, the film is an unflinching look at cocaine addiction, American materialism, and the destruction they wreak. In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert described it as \u201ca modern day Death of a Salesman.\" Sea of Love (1989) Sea of Love (1989) is both a thriller and dark love story. Becker felt that it was the love story, in fact, \u2018that made the film work.\u2019 The chemistry between stars Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin is palpable, and Sea of Love went on to become one of the year\u2019s biggest hits. Returning to the screen after a four year absence, Pacino earned some of his best reviews since the 1970\u2019s, and helped to resurrect his career as a bankable star. Malice (1993) - also producer In 1993, Becker made Malice, a clever, tightly-plotted thriller starring Nicole Kidman. Bill Pullman, and Alec Baldwin as an egotistical surgeon, who when asked if he has a god complex, memorably replies, \u201clet me tell you something\u2026 I am God.\u201d Aaron Sorkin's brilliant screenplay is full of sharp plot twists, character reversals, red-herrings, and other Hitchockian flourishes. The suspense is heightened further still by Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s evocative score and Gordon Willis\u2019 moody, muted cinematography. City Hall (1996) - also producer Based on a mid-1980s bribe and kickback scandal that exposed the dark underbelly of New York City politics, City Hall (1996) remains one of Becker\u2019s most complex and ambitious films. Becker hired Academy Award-winning screenwriter Bo Goldman to write the script. To research it, the two spent three months interviewing city officials, such as Rudolph Guiliani and former mayor Ed Koch, as well as members of the city's underworld and others familiar with intricacies of the scandal. The film boasts a stellar cast that includes John Cusack, Bridget Fonda, Danny Aiello, Martin Landau, and most notably, Al Pacino as New York\u2019s great, but flawed mayor. Goldman\u2019s script cuts a wide swath through the city\u2019s power structure, revealing a landscape of compromise and corruption. Nothing is black or white. Everything is painted in \u2018shades of gray, full of ambiguities.\u2019 Mercury Rising (1998) Mercury Rising (1998) was brought to Becker by its star, Bruce Willis. Though ostensibly an action thriller, the project appealed to Becker because of its unusual twist on formula. Willis plays a FBI agent trying to protect a nine year old autistic savant who is being hunted down by government agents after he cracks a top secret NSA code. Wanting to depict autism in a non-exploitative manner, Becker hired a child psychiatrist from the Child Mind Institute to tutor actor Miko Hughes. Domestic Disturbance (2001) Becker\u2019s last feature film as a director was the psychological thriller Domestic Disturbance (2001), starring John Travolta, Teri Polo, and Vince Vaughn. The film is buoyed by strong performances by Vaughn, young Matt O\u2019Leary, and Steve Buscemi, whose appearance in the film is comparatively brief but impactful. === Documentaries === * Eugene Atget (1963) * Blind Gary Davis (1964) *Ivanhoe Donaldson (1964) *Interview With Bruce Gordon (1964) *Sighet, Sighet (1967) Blind Gary Davis (1964) Reverend Gary Davis was a blind blues singer and guitarist, who had been living in relative obscurity in New York City until he was rediscovered in the early 1960s. In Blind Gary Davis (1964) Becker captures the legendary bluesman as he performs a pair of songs from his one room apartment. The performance is intercut with shots of his threadbare flat, as well as the surrounding Harlem neighborhood. As Becker\u2019s camera glides through it (he was shooting through the doors of VW microbus), the locals are either indifferent, or stare back with deep suspicion. Ivanhoe Donaldson (1964) Ivanhoe Donaldson follows a young field secretary for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) as he travels below the Mason\u2013Dixon line at the height of the tumultuous Civil Rights era. Becker\u2019s cinema v\u00e9rit\u00e9 camera follows Donaldson and other SNCC staffers as they organize demonstrations, voter drives and attempt to bring an end to segregation in the South. The film won Gold Prize at the Mannheim- Heidelberg International Film Festival. Interview With Bruce Gordon (1964) Simply staged and beautifully-lit, the short film features Bruce Gordon, a 22-year-old organizer for the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee addressing issues of race and inequality in America. Shot in 1963 at SNCC headquarters in Selma, Alabama, the film premiered the following year at the Lincoln Center in New York City. Sighet, Sighet (1967) In Sighet, Sighet (1967), Nobel laureate and activist Elie Wiesel, returns to the town of Sighet, Romania, where he was born. Sighet is also where Wiesel and thousands of other Eastern European Jews were deported to the Auschwitz extermination camp three decades earlier. The modern city of Sighet presents a facade of progress and order. Becker\u2019s camera explores a city filled with sleek buildings, sharp angles, and well-planned streets. But it is all slightly unreal. For Wiesel, the city exists only in his memory. Everyone he ever knew there, all his family and friends, are gone. The result is a haunting juxtaposition of memory and place. ==References== ==External links== * Harold Becker Official Website * Filmreference.com * Category:Film producers from New York (state) Category:1928 births Category:Living people Category:Film directors from New York City Category:Pratt Institute alumni ",
