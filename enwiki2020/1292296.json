The stadium's bowl site size is 48,000 m2. The stadium was built in 1999 by Fletcher Construction and is situated close to major transport facilities (such as Wellington railway station) one kilometre north of the CBD. It was built on reclaimed railway land, which was surplus to requirements. The stadium also serves as a large- capacity venue for concerts and is known colloquially as \"The Cake Tin\". ==History== The stadium was built in 1999 by Fletcher Construction and was the first bowl stadium built in New Zealand. It was built to replace Athletic Park, which was no longer considered adequate for international events due to its location and state of disrepair. The stadium was also built to provide a larger-capacity venue for One Day International cricket matches, due to the Basin Reserve ground losing such matches to larger stadiums in other parts of the country. ==Naming Rights== Westpac Trust, later known as just Westpac, signed on to be the naming sponsor for the stadium when it opened in 2000. Continuing that relationship for twenty years before it ended on 31 December 2019. On 22 August 2019, it was announced that Sky had signed a six-year agreement to take over as the naming sponsor of the stadium from 1 January 2020. ==Tenants== The stadium is a multi-purpose facility, though used mainly for sporting events.
