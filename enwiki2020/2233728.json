    "text": "Berghaus Limited is an outdoor clothing and equipment manufacturer headquartered in Sunderland, Tyne & Wear, UK. \"Berghaus Ltd, 12 Colima Avenue, Sunderland Enterprise Park, Sunderland, SR5 3XB\" It is based in the North East of England and distributes worldwide. It was founded in 1966 by climbers and mountaineers Peter Lockey and Gordon Davison, initially as an importer and distributor of outdoors products. Lockey and Davison's outdoor store in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK, went by the name of the LD Mountain Centre. In 1972 they began designing and manufacturing their own products for sale in their shop. They gave their brand the German name 'Berghaus' which translates as 'mountain house'. Berghaus offers a range of men's, women's and children's outdoor clothing and equipment, including waterproof jackets, fleeces, baselayers and legwear. They also produce a selection of outdoor specific accessories and footwear. ==History== \"It all began when climbers and mountaineers Peter Lockey and Gordon Davison from the North East of England, frustrated by what they saw as a lack of decent outdoor gear, decided to import and sell their own. Their specialist outdoor store in Newcastle-upon- Tyne, England, went by the name of the LD Mountain Centre and quickly gained a reputation for selling the very best in high-performance outdoor products from the likes of Atomic Skis, Marker Bindings and Nordica Ski.\" ===1970s=== The first Berghaus rucksacks were launched in 1970 \u2013 the Berg 172 and Berg 272 models had external frames and basic single compartments. These more traditional sacks were followed two years later in 1972 by the Cyclops rucksack \u2013 arguably the world\u2019s first rucksack with an internal frame. In 1977 Berghaus became one of Europe's pioneer users of Gore-Tex\u00ae fabric, a new waterproof and breathable fabric. This was followed in 1979 by the development of the Yeti Gaiter, whose distinctive rubber rands were initially made from old tractor inner tubes. ===1980s=== In the 1980s the Gemini jacket was introduced, and is still in production today; it allowed a walking jacket to have a zip-in fleece. It was also in the early 1980s that mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington, 'officially' wore Berghaus. It was also around this time that Alan Hinkes \u2013 who would go on to become the UK's most successful extreme altitude mountaineer \u2013 began working with the company. In 1986 the Extrem range was launched and included the Trango Jacket. The Attak sole unit was introduced the following year and exported around the world. Berghaus were awarded the Queen's Award for Export in 1988 and the Northern Business Award for Exporter of the Year. ===1990s=== 1993 saw a significant development in Berghaus' history as Pentland Group PLC, home to sports brands Speedo and Ellesse, acquired Berghaus. The early 1990s also saw Berghaus turn its attention to footwear, launching its very first footwear collection. The collection included the Storm boot, a three-season fabric hiking boot. As a new century approached Berghaus introduced the Simplex concept in 1997: the idea was that by minimising the layers of fabric in a garment and getting rid of any unnecessary styling you achieve a more breathable, lightweight product. 1999 saw the introduction of new lightweight and packable outerwear available at the time \u2013 Gore-Tex PacLite, a waterproof, windproof and breathable range of clothing. The Nitro rucksack, introduced by Berghaus in 1998, was awarded the Millennium Product Award by the Design Council of Great Britain. ==2000s\u2013present== ===MtnHaus=== In 2011 Berghaus unveiled its new design and development team, MtnHaus, to the world. The MtnHaus team works with Berghaus- sponsored athletes, such as Leo Houlding and Mick Fowler, to produce kit for specific challenges, which means extended design, development and testing periods. So far the MtnHaus team have produced five products including the Asgard Smock, which went through 18 prototypes before the design was finalised. In 2013, the team developed the award-winning Vapour Storm Jacket. ===Berghaus-sponsored athletes=== Berghaus now have a team of over 21 athletes from all over the globe, including: *Climber Leo Houlding *Mountaineer Mick Fowler *Hand biker Karen Darke Berghaus now also has several stores throughout the UK, including Bristol, Manchester, Covent Garden in London, Dalton Park in County Durham, Bridgend and Gretna. ==References== ==External links== *Berghaus Website Category:Outdoor clothing brands Category:Clothing brands of the United Kingdom Category:British brands Category:Mountaineering equipment manufacturers Category:Clothing companies of the United Kingdom ",
