    "text": "Washburn Guitars is an American manufacturer and importer of guitars, mandolins, and other string instruments. The original company was established in 1883 in Chicago, Illinois. The modern Washburn is a division of US Music Corp., in turn now owned by JAM Industries USA. ==Corporate history== ===1864-1940=== Washburn Banjorine (1892). Lyon & Healy began in 1864 as a partnership of businessmen George W. Lyon and Patrick J. Healy, acting as the Chicago outlet for Boston sheet music publisher Oliver Ditson and Company. By 1865, Lyon & Healy had expanded into reed organs and some small instruments. The company achieved independence by 1880, and around 1888 the company launched fully into fretted and plucked instruments (guitars, mandolins, banjos, and zithers) under the George Washburn brand, which was Lyon's first and middle name. Lyon & Healy 1898 catalog listed 28 different styles of \"Washburn\" guitars, ranging from $15 to $145. Tracing the history of any particular instrument of this period presents many obstacles. Not only did the Lyon & Healy company often change designs to follow the rapidly evolving consumer demand, but the company also repaired instruments, and offered engraving services, including decorating instruments that it retailed but did not actually manufacture. As well, they built instruments for other retailers and distributors under various house brands, and outsourced construction of some models. In 1912, Washburn introduced the Lakeside Jumbo guitar, which some consider the first dreadnought-sized guitar. It bridged the gap between smaller-bodied \"parlor\" guitars of the late 19th and early 20th century and modern-day dreadnought and jumbo acoustic guitars. George Lyon retired from the company in 1889 (died 1894). Patrick Healy then led the company into a period of major expansion, beginning with a larger new factory and improved mass-production techniques, and soon dominated the domestic market. Their 1892 catalog claimed to manufacture 100,000 instruments annually. Healy died 1905. By the 1920s, Lyon & Healy faced growing competition from other instrument manufacturers as well as from the rise of other forms of entertainment, particularly film and the gramophone. Lyon & Healy gradually shifted manufacturing chores onto wholesaler Tonk Brothers, to whom they sold the guitar portion of the business in 1928, continuing to produce their own lines of harps, pianos, and organs. Tonk Brothers turned to manufacturer J.R. Stewart Company to purchase and operate the massive factory, but this transition proved problematic and Stewart went bankrupt in 1930. Some of the Stewart assets were acquired by the Regal Musical Instrument Company, which had purchased the \"Regal\" brand name in 1908 from Lyon & Healy (who acquired it in 1905). Regal was chosen to reopen the Washburn factory (producing Regal instruments as well). Though the Washburn brand was preserved, it never regained its preeminence, and by the early 1940s had declined to nothing. ===Modern era=== An unbroken lineage is often alluded to by Washburn International, in press releases and advertising materials, and on the company website: There is no direct connection between the original Washburn brand and the modern Washburn International. In the early 1960s, retail store The Chicago Guitar Gallery hired Rudolf \"Rudy\" Schlacher, a young German violin builder, as a repair technician. A few years later, Schlacher opened The Sound Post, heading of \"Rudy Schlacher\" video in NAMM Oral History video project.\"Grand Piano Haus: The history of Grand Piano Haus\" (in Evanston, Illinois) to focus on guitars. He soon realized the sales potential for lower- cost quality instruments. Tom Beckmen and his wife Judy Fink Beckmen in 1972 left careers as music salesman and teacher (respectively) to launch a wholesale music business in Los Angeles, Beckmen Musical Instruments. It was Beckmen Music that resurrected the Washburn name, and beginning in 1974 applied it to a series of quality imported acoustic guitars, made in Japan by Terada, as well as a selection of mandolins and banjos. Fritz Tasch, Rudy Schlacher and Rick Johnstone, as Fretted Industries, Inc., acquired the Washburn name in 1977 (for $13,000) when the Beckmens took their business a different direction,:Beckmen Music became Roland's distributor for the western United States in 1976, and in 1978 a 50% partner in founding Roland USA. The Beckmens sold their share back to Roland in 1993 and bought a vineyard in the Santa Ynez Valley. and so the Washburn name was returned to Chicago. With assistance from Ikutaro Kakehashi (founder of Roland Corporation), Schlacher was able to find instrument factories in Japan that could meet the desired standards. Fretted Industries acquired other lines as well, such as Oscar Schmidt autoharps. Schlacher bought out Johnstone in 1987, and changed the company name to Washburn International. A stateside manufacturing operation was opened in 1991 for higher-end, short-run, and one-off instruments, as well as development and prototyping. That year, a Chicago Tribune article\"Guitar- maker Strikes Comeback Chord: Washburn Hits The Top 3 On 15 Years Of Growth\", February 17, 1991 confidently places Washburn \"among the top three guitar manufacturers in the world,\" behind only Fender and Gibson. On December 15, 2002, Washburn International announced that it had completed acquisition of U.S. Music Corporation, Hoovers.com, entry: U.S. MUSIC CORPORATION Company Profile and would be rolling its assets into that company in a reverse merger. U.S. Music press release, 12/15/2002 Schlacher remained as CFO, appointing Gary Gryczan to COO; Gryczan had been Washburn's CFO from 1995 through 1998. The new USM's headquarters were in Mundelein (440 E. Courtland Street), which also housed the stateside Washburn luthiery, often referred to as \"the USA Custom Shop.\" The USA Custom Shop was previously located at Elston Ave. and Springfield Ave in the 1990s in an old factory that was used as an icehouse after the great Chicago fire, it was rumored to be haunted by the victims whose bodies had been stored there. Schlacher announced completion of selling USM to JAM Industries on August 24, 2009, and that he would be stepping away from his company after fully four decades.\"Schlacher Says Farewell\" As R S Consulting he remained a consultant to the musical-instrument industryLinkedIn entry \"Rudy Schlacher\" and was an executive producer for a small-budget filmIMDB entry: Steel Panther: The British Invasion The corporate offices of U.S. Music were relocated to Buffalo Grove, Illinois in 2012. ==Production== Very few modern Washburn instruments have been built by the company itself. It has relied on outside factories and luthiers to fulfill their designs and meet public demand. The first modern Washburn instruments were full-size acoustic guitars imported from Japan by Beckmen Music. The 1974 range included one folk-style guitar (W-200) and eight dreadnoughts of increasing quality and decoration: W-240-12, W-250, W-260, W-280, W-300, W-300-12, W-500, W-600. Under Rudy Schlacher, most Washburn models were ordered in runs of 200 units, rather than ongoing production; if sales went well, a further run might be ordered. This application of just-in-time manufacturing (or lean manufacturing) kept the company from needing to warehouse and liquidate overproduction, improving profitability. As a result, many Washburn instruments (acoustic or electric) are difficult to locate once out of production, and are scarcer than the \"limited editions\" of other manufacturers. The first Washburn electric guitars were the Wing Series models, offered 1978-1984. These instruments featured innovative push-pull split humbuckers, brass hardware and inlays, and neck-through construction. Most of the Wing Series models were produced by Yamaki, a Japanese manufacturer of Washburn acoustic guitars as well as their own Daion brand (late 1970s to early 1980s). By 1991, production of Washburn instruments had shifted almost entirely to Korea, built by Samick. When Samick opened their Cileungsi, Indonesia, facility in 1992, this factory also began to produce Washburn-branded instruments, generally identifiable by an \"SI-\" serial number prefix. From 1992 to 2000 Washburn housed the USA Custom Shop in a factory at Elston Ave. and Springfield Ave. Grover Jackson ran production for the first half of the 90\u2019s and Larry English ran production for the second half of the 90\u2019s. The building was so old it was used as an icehouse after the great Chicago fire and rumored to have been haunted. At least two guitar heists occurred there when thieves backed a box truck through a wall and loaded the truck with guitars getting away cleanly. Between 1994 and 2001, ten models of acoustic guitar were built for Washburn in the United States, five by Tacoma Guitars (Tacoma, Washington) and five by Bourgeois Guitars (Lewiston, Maine). Washburn brought out a line of four USA-made dreadnoughts, available from 2002 to 2008. These were the D-78, D-80, D-82, and D-84. (All had the \"-SW\" suffix, for \"solid wood,\" indicating that no laminate wood was employed.) In 2012, when JAM Industries declined to renew the lease on the Mundelein facility, the Washburn luthiery closed. At the time, the Washburn facility was the ninth- largest employer in the village (the third-largest business), providing 180 jobs.Village of Mundelein 2011 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report The stated intent was to reopen at a smaller building in Buffalo Grove (1000 Corporate Grove Drive), Guitar maker leaves Mundelein. but this did not materialize. A few Washburn models (particularly the N4) are produced in Cincinnati. As of 2017, primary production has largely shifted from Korea to factories in Indonesia and China. ==Innovations== Most widely known for its guitars (both electric and acoustic), Washburn also makes electric basses, acoustic basses, banjos, mandolins, travel guitars, ukuleles, and amplifiers, as well as accessories including guitar cases, clothing, tuners, and straps. In the 1980s, Washburn introduced the Festival Series of acoustic/electric guitars (the EA series, for \"electrified acoustic\"). They were thinner than standard acoustic guitars and less acoustically resonant by design, thereby reducing susceptibility to feedback, a significant problem using acoustic or electrified acoustic guitars in large-venue performances. The addition in later models of sound slots (rather than the traditional round soundhole), a patented innovation, further reduced the possibility of feedback, and the guitars quickly became the go-to stage acoustic for artists such as Jimmy Page, George Harrison, and Bob Dylan. In the early 1990s when MTV introduced their Unplugged series, hardly a show went by without seeing a Festival Series guitar. The design also lent itself well to acoustic basses, and Washburn's AB Series quickly became popular both for its look and its tone, whether amplified or unplugged. Headstock of a Washburn RB2802 eight-string bass. In recent years, Washburn licensed several guitar construction features: * the Buzz Feiten Tuning System -- a corrected-temperation tuning formula, using a compensated nut and saddle to minimize the inherent intonation problems of the Western tuning formula. The BFTS was first used by Washburn in 1995 on a very few models, then increasingly with the introduction of the WI-64 (1999), and was entirely phased out after the 2010 production year. At its peak, this system came standard on U.S.-made Washburn guitars and basses and the better imports. * Stephen's Extended Cutaway -- a unique bolt-on neck joint invented by luthier Stephen Davies to allow greater unrestricted access for a guitarist's fretting hand. Used primarily with the Nuno Bettencourt signature models, the SEC has also been employed with acoustic guitars, and remains on some current (2017) models of the Parallaxe line. * Voice Contour Control (VCC) -- a special potentiometer and wiring, intended to allow access to the entire range of tones \"between\" the one-coil (\"single-coil\" mode) and two-coil sounds of a humbucking pickup, rather than one or the other. ::VCC is similar to coil splitting, in that it changes the tone of a humbucking pick-up to that of a single coil, but it does it by turning the tone knob \u2026 without the hum normally associated with single coils. :Designed by Trevor Wilkinson, the VCC is no longer in use by Washburn, but is available in various models of Vintage (UK) guitar as the \"Roll Control\" knob. ==Model number suffixes== Over the past 40 years, Washburn has accreted a system of identifying some of the most pertinent features in many of its acoustic instruments and some of the electric. Additional letters may be used to indicate the instrument's finish. While imperfectly applied, and sometimes awkwardly long, this can often be useful in identifying a given guitar. ;suffix \u2014 * C - cutaway * DL - deluxe (generally, a standard model with a few upgraded features) * E - electric (i.e., built-in pickup) * K - kit (i.e., includes case or gig bag) * LH - left-handed * M - mahogany top * Q - quilt maple top * R - rosewood * S - solid-wood top (rather than laminate) * SP - spalt maple top * SW - solid wood used throughout * V - vibrato (on electric guitars) This often combines with the prefix to tell a guitar's story. For example, the WLG110SWCEK indicates that it's part of the Woodline series (WL-), likely top of the line (110), Grand Auditorium (G) size, all solid wood, cutaway, piezo pickup, and originally included a case. == Past and present models == Any given series may have as few as only one model. === Electric guitars === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! prefix !
