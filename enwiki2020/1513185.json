Manchukuo was a puppet state set up by the Empire of Japan in Manchuria which existed from 1931 to 1945. The Manchukuo regime was established four months after the Japanese withdrawal from Shanghai with Puyi as the nominal but powerless head of state to add some semblance of legitimacy, as he was a former emperor and an ethnic Manchu. == Government == Manchukuo was proclaimed a monarchy on 1 March 1934, with former Qing dynasty emperor Puyi assuming the Manchukuo throne under the reign name of Emperor Kang-de. An imperial rescript issued the same day, promulgated the organic law of the new state, establishing a Privy Council, a Legislative Council and the General Affairs State Council to \"advise and assist the emperor in the discharge of his duties\". The Privy Council was an appointive body consisting of Puyi's closest friends and confidants, and the Legislative Council was largely an honorary body without authority. The State Council was therefore the center of political power in Manchukuo. == Political parties and movements == During his administration, the Kangde Emperor, in an interview with foreign journalists, mentioned his interest in forming a political party with Confucian doctrines. The Japanese \"native\" establishment, however, organized some right-wing and nationalist parties, in the Militarism-Socialism mould. Such movements, which had official status, were: *Concordia Association (State-sponsored political party) *Northeast Administrative Committee (Manchukuo nationalist local party) *Russian Fascist Organization (the White Russian fascist association in Manchukuo) *White Russian Fascist Party (later the Russian Fascist Party; White Russian anticommunist party in Manchukuo, used the swastika as symbol, guided by a Russian fascist \"Duce\") *Bureau for Russian Emigrants in Manchuria (BREM) led by General Vladimir Kislitsin *Monarquic Party (White Russian Tsarist Monarchic party with Japanese approval) *Betarim Jew Zionist Movement (Jewish rights movement in Manchukuo) *Far Eastern Jewish Council (Jewish Zionist council in Harbin, Manchukuo led by Dr. Abraham Kaufman, with Japanese Army support) == Notable people == === The Imperial Manchu Court === Puyi as Emperor of Manchukuo * Aisin Gioro Henry Puyi (Kangde Emperor and head of state) * Elizabeth Wanrong (Empress and first wife of the Kangde Emperor) * Prince Aisin Gioro Pujie (brother of Puyi, possible heir of Manchukuo Throne) * Prince Aisin Gioro Puren (brother of Puyi) * Prince Aisin Gioro Yuyan (nephew of Puyi) * Hiro Saga (Japanese sister-in-law of the Kangde Emperor) * Wenxiu (first concubine of the Emperor) * Tan Yuling (2nd Wife of the Kangde Emperor) * Li Yuqin (4th Wife of the Kangde Emperor) * Princess Aisin Gioro Huisheng (daughter of Pu-Chieh and Hiro Saga) * Princess Aisin Gioro Xianyu (distant relative) === Others (local) === * Zheng Xiaoxu, prime minister * Zhang Jinghui, next prime minister until 1945 * Xi Xia (Xi Qia), cabinet minister * Ma Zhanshan, former warlord, and cabinet minister * Xie Jishi, cabinet minister * Zang Shiyi, cabinet minister * Zhang Yangqing, cabinet minister * Yu Zhishan, cabinet minister * Yuan Jinkai, cabinet minister * L\u00fc Ronghuan, cabinet minister * Ding Jianxiu, cabinet minister * Li Shaogeng, cabinet minister * Ruan Zhenduo, cabinet minister * Ling Sheng, cabinet minister * Sun Qichang, cabinet minister * Bao Guancheng, Manchukuo's first ambassador in Tokyo * Yuan Cheng-Tse, Manchukuo ambassador in Tokyo * Li Shao- Keng, Manchukuo ambassador in Tokyo * Gen.
