Shakur-Still's work includes designing and conducting clinical trials, as well as developing ways to communicate the work to clinicians, policy makers, and the public. Shakur-Still ran the WOMAN Trial which looked the blood clot stabilising drug tranexamic acid for post-delivery bleeding, which is the largest cause of maternal mortality around the world. This trial involved over 20,000 patients from 21 countries. In 2017 the World Health Organisation updated their guidance from 2012 to recommend the use of tranexamic acid within three hours of birth when postpartum haemorrhage is diagnosed. In February 2018 the WOMAN project was the third winner of the European Commission's Horizon Birth Day Prize, and was awarded a \u20ac500,000 prize by the MSD for Mothers. == Selected scientific publications == * Roberts, I., H.
