The Cornish for \"churchtown\" is Treneglos, although only one settlement kept the Cornish name, the rest converting to the English, or not being a settlement before English overtook Cornish and became the main language of that part of Cornwall. The churchtown will not necessarily be the main settlement in the parish. ==External links== For other examples in Cornwall, see: * Cornovia: An Index to the Historical Place Names of Cornwall (A Cornish Sourcebook) Category:Geography of Cornwall Category:English toponymy ",
