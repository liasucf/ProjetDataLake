Raag Sorath (\u0a38\u0a4b\u0a30\u0a20\u0a3f) \u2013 Sorath conveys the feeling of having such a strong belief in something that you want to keep repeating the experience. In fact this feeling of certainty is so strong that you become the belief and live that belief. The atmosphere of Sorath is so powerful, that eventually even the most unresponsive listener will be attracted. The following represents the order of notes that can be used on the ascending and descending phase of the composition and the primary and secondary notes: * Arohana: Sa Re Ma Pa Ni Sa * Avarohana: Sa Re Ni Dha, Ma Pa Dha Ma Ga Re Ni Sa * Vadi: Re * Samavadi: Dha The melodies are characterized by sweeping phrases with glides connecting all leaps, even the shorter ones. Movement is moderately fast.
