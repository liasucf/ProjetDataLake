    "text": "Jos\u00e9 Edm\u00edlson Gomes de Moraes (born 10 July 1976), known simply as Edm\u00edlson, is a Brazilian former professional footballer. Either a defensive midfielder or a central defender, he played in three countries in his professional career, representing with team and individual success S\u00e3o Paulo, Lyon and Barcelona (four seasons each in the last two clubs). Having won 39 caps with Brazil, Edm\u00edlson represented the nation at the 2002 World Cup, helping it win the tournament. ==Club career== ===S\u00e3o Paulo, Lyon=== Born in Taquaritinga, S\u00e3o Paulo, Edm\u00edlson signed for S\u00e3o Paulo FC in 1995, winning two Campeonato Paulista titles during his spell. In 2000 he joined Olympique Lyonnais in France at the same time as compatriot Ca\u00e7apa, also a stopper, both being important as the club won the League Cup in his first season. In the ensuing off-season, Juninho Pernambucano also made the move to the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, and often partnered Edm\u00edlson in central midfield as they went on to win three consecutive Ligue 1 titles. ===Barcelona=== In July 2004, Edm\u00edlson signed with FC Barcelona for a reported \u20ac10 million. He made his La Liga debut on 19 September in a 1\u20131 away draw against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, and finished his debut campaign with only six matches as the Catalans won the national championship; on 3 October, after having come on as a substitute for Samuel Eto'o during a home fixture against CD Numancia, he himself had to be substituted after only five minutes on the pitch, going on to be sidelined for several months. Edm\u00edlson recovered fully for 2005\u201306, playing an important part in Frank Rijkaard's team as they won the league and the season's UEFA Champions League. In the latter competition, he appeared in nine matches \u2013 six complete \u2013 including the first half of the final against Arsenal. After a poor 2007\u201308 campaign, both individually and collectively, 32-year-old Edm\u00edlson left Barcelona as his contract was not renewed. ===Later years=== On 23 May 2008, Edm\u00edlson signed for one year with Villarreal CF. After only a couple of months, however, he returned to his country, joining Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras on a two-year deal and scoring his first goal in the first stage of the Copa Libertadores against Club Real Potos\u00ed, on 29 January 2009, just eight days after his arrival. After not having appeared in the S\u00e3o Paulo championship in 2010, Edm\u00edlson cut ties with Palmeiras and, on 31 January, returned to Spain, agreeing to a five-month contract with struggling Real Zaragoza \u2013 at that time, he was already the bearer of an Italian passport, thus not counting as a foreign player. He appeared regularly during the remainder of the campaign, as the Aragonese managed to finish out of the relegation zone, and saw his link being extended for another year. On 12 September 2010, Edm\u00edlson scored his first goal for Zaragoza, who lost 3\u20135 at home against M\u00e1laga CF. In June 2011, after having contributed with only 12 games to the club's final escape from relegation, he returned to his country and joined Cear\u00e1 Sporting Club. ==International career== Edm\u00edlson made his debut for the Brazil national team on 18 July 2000, against Paraguay. Selected to the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea, he helped the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o win their fifth tournament, appearing in six out of seven games and scoring his first (and only) international goal in the 5\u20132 group stage win over Costa Rica. Originally selected to the 2006 World Cup in Germany, Edm\u00edlson was forced to withdraw from the squad after sustaining a knee injury in training before the tournament. ===Internationals goals=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! # !!
