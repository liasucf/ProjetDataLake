    "text": "\"Rings of Gold\" is a single by American country music artists Dottie West and Don Gibson. Released in February 1969, it was the first single from their album Dottie and Don. The song peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. It also reached number 1 on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada. The duet \u2013 a mid-tempoed country pop-flavored song about a failing relationship \u2013 became the first of two duets pairing West and Gibson to reach the top 10 of the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart, the other being the No. 7 hit \"There's a Story (Goin' 'Round)\" in January 1970. \"Rings of Gold\" was West's biggest hit to that point in her career, and her 1973 solo hit \"Country Sunshine\" would match it; both remained her biggest hits until \"Every Time Two Fools Collide,\" her 1978 No. 1 duet with Kenny Rogers. For Gibson, it was his first top 10 hit in two years, the last coming with 1967's \"Funny, Familiar, Forgotten, Feelings\" (No. 8), and his biggest hit since \"Lonesome Number One,\" a No. 2 hit in early 1962. ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1969) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles |align=\"center\"|2 |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Country Tracks |align=\"center\"|1 |} ==References== Category:1969 singles Category:Dottie West songs Category:Don Gibson songs Category:RPM Country Tracks number-one singles Category:Vocal duets Category:Song recordings produced by Chet Atkins Category:1969 songs ",
