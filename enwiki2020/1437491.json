    "text": "Windir (\"Warrior\" in English) was a black metal band from Sogndal, Norway. The band was formed in 1994 by vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Terje \"Valfar\" Bakken, and released its debut album S\u00f3knardalr in 1997. Windir combined black metal with Scandinavian folk music, folklore and mythology, and many of the band's lyrics are written in Sognam\u00e5l. Windir produced four albums in their almost ten years of existence. The band broke up in March 2004 after frontman Valfar died of hypothermia after becoming caught in a blizzard on his way to his family's cabin in Norway. Following his death, the remaining band members went on to form a number of new bands including Vreid, Mistur, and Cor Scorpii. Most of the band's early albums featured lyrics written in frontman Valfar's native dialect, Sognamal. The band had an \"intense affinity for traditional music and Norwegian texts, drawing much of its lyrical content from local sagas, using traditional folk tunes in its music, and singing in an archaic rural dialect.\" With the coining of the term, the genre \"Sognametal\" as established by Windir has inspired many bands from the small region of Sogn og Fjordane, most of whom are ex-members of Windir or friends of them. These bands include: Vreid, Cor Scorpii, Mistur, Sigtyr and Feigd. ==Valfar's death== On January 14, 2004, Terje \"Valfar\" Bakken went to his family's cabin at Fagereggi, Norway, by foot. On January 17, his body was found at Reppast\u00f8len in the Sogndal valley. He died from hypothermia after being surprised by sudden inclement weather en route.Rivadavia, Eduardo. [ \"AllMusic ((( Windir > Biography )))\"]. AllMusic. Retrieved July 21, 2013. He was buried on January 27 at Stedje Church in Norway. In March 2004, Windir officially disbanded. A compilation album containing Windir outtakes and B-sides, Valfar, ein Windir, was released in 2004 as a tribute to Valfar. On September 3, 2004, in Oslo, Windir's remaining members performed their last concert to go back to their roots and keep base with what they thought was real. Enslaved, Finntroll, Notodden All Stars, Weh, E-Head and Mindgrinder were the guest bands. == Band members == ===Final line-up=== *Terje \"Valfar\" Bakken \u2013 vocals, guitars, bass, keyboards, accordion (1994-2004, instruments are studio-only since 2001) *J\u00f8rn \"Steingrim\" Holen \u2013 drums (1994-2004, studio-only until 2001) *Jarle \"Hv\u00e0ll\" Kv\u00e5le \u2013 bass guitar (2001-2004) *Sture Dings\u00f8yr \u2013 rhythm guitar (2001-2004), vocals (2004) *Stian \"Strom\" Bakketeig \u2013 lead guitar (2001-2004) *Gaute \"Righ\" Refsnes \u2013 keyboards (2001-2004) ===Past members=== *Sorg \u2013 guitars (1994 - 1996) and choir (on Det gamle riket) *Lars Stian \"Invictus\" Havraas - bass (session) ===Session members=== ====Arntor==== *Steinarson - clean vocals *I.
