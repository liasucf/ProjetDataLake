Administratively it lies in the Northeast Greenland National Park zone. The area where the glacier flows is remote and uninhabited. ==History== This glacier was first mapped in 1931 by the H\u00f8ygaard and Mehren expedition. It was named after Adolf Hoel (1863\u20131933), Norwegian geologist and chairman of the Arctic Trading Co.. ==Geography== The Adolf Hoel Glacier originates in the eastern side of the Greenland ice sheet around the area of Hobb Land, with J. L. Mowinckel Land to the south and Arnold Escher Land to the north. It is joined by the Skr\u00e5br\u00e6 from the north. Then it flows along the northern edge of Andr\u00e9e Land in a roughly WNW/ESE direction until its terminus in the Nunatak Glacier to the east. It has a flow of per year.Ice flow in Greenland for the International Polar Year 2008\u20132009 The Eyvind Fjeld Glacier flows to the north and the Wilkins Nunataks rise to the NW. The Jakob Kj\u00f8de Bjerg, a large high nunatak, rises off the northeastern side of the glacier, beyond which flows the Waltershausen Glacier.Deeply incised submarine glacial valleys beneath the Greenland iceOcean forcing of the Greenland Ice Sheet {| |- valign=\"top\" |Map of Northeastern Greenland |} ==Bibliography== *A.
