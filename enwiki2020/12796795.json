    "text": "\"Officially Missing You\" is a song by Canadian R&B; recording artist Tamia, taken from her third studio album, More (2004). Released as the album's lead single, it was written by Marcus Vest, better known by his stage name Seven Aurelius. The song is marked by its acoustic style featuring acoustic guitar and Tamia's vocals most prominently in the mix. ==Background== \"Officially Missing You\" was written and produced by 7 Aurelius. A melancholic lament that is built around an acoustic guitar, it marked a departure for Aurelius who was primarily known for his hop hop productions up to then. In an interview with Billboard remarked that she was initially nervous about working with him, saying: \"It was different than what I thought he was going to bring. But when we met in the studio, we instantly clicked. The song was very bare \u2014 just a guitar and a click track. That's the best way to record, because you can really put emotion in there.\" ==Music video== The music video for \"Officially Missing You\" was filmed by American director Paul Hunter. ==Track listing== # \"Officially Missing You\" [Album Version] # \"Officially Missing You\" [MIDI Mafia Remix] # \"Officially Missing You\" [Dinavon B.
