Guinea's trade unions and opposition parties called on President Lansana Cont\u00e9 to resign, accusing him of mismanaging the economy and abusing his authority. The strikers also accused Cont\u00e9 of personally securing the release of Mamadou Sylla and Fod\u00e9 Soumah, both accused of corruption, from prison.\"Guinea police clash with strikers\", BBC News, January 22, 2007. The strike ended on January 27 with an agreement between Cont\u00e9 and the unions, according to which Cont\u00e9 would appoint a new prime minister; however, Cont\u00e9's choice of Eug\u00e8ne Camara as prime minister was deemed unacceptable by the unions, and the strike resumed on February 12. Martial law was imposed on the same day. Nearly two weeks later, Cont\u00e9 agreed to choose a prime minister acceptable to the unions, and on February 26 he named Lansana Kouyat\u00e9 as prime minister. The strike ended on February 27, and Kouyat\u00e9 was sworn in on March 1. ==Background== Two general strikes had been held in 2006, but these were limited to Conakry. The 2007 protests were first visible in Conakry, where workers stayed at home and businesses were shut. The government responded by threatening to sack striking civil servants.\"'Dead City' Protests Continue in Guinea into Second Day\" , VOA News, January 11, 2007.

This was rejected by union leaders, who were then arrested but soon released.\"Guinea anger over dead strikers\", BBC News, January 18, 2007. ==January events== A general strike was called by the United Trade Union of Guinean Workers (the USTG) in an attempt to force the president to resign. Strike leaders said that Cont\u00e9, who had ruled Guinea since seizing power in a 1984 coup, had become increasingly erratic. They cite repeated scares about his health, sudden and chaotic cabinet reshuffles and his recent personal intervention to free from jail two former allies accused of graft. The two main opposition parties in the nation, the Rally for the Guinean People and the Union of Republican Forces supported the strike, as did the National Council of Civil Society Organisations group of NGOs and the newly formed Civic Alliance.\"GUINEA: Civil society crystallising around unions\", IRIN Africa, January 11, 2007. Police were ordered to disperse crowds of protesters, numbering as many as 5,000, with tear gas. On January 17, two deaths from bullet wounds were reported in Conakry, and one in Lab\u00e9.
