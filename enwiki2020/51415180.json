His focus on the upper registers and the polyester tone of his five-string bass guitar will continue to annoy those who prefer to hear the bass played dark, low and woody, but there's no denying the consistent inventiveness of his playing or the charm of these compositions\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Steve Swallow. # \"Bite Your Grandmother\" - 4:40 # \"Second Handy Motion\" - 4:47 # \"Wrong Together\" - 5:19 # \"Outfits\" - 5:52 # \"Thinking Out Loud\" - 5:04 # \"Let's Eat\" - 5:38 # \"Better Times\" - 3:49 # \"Willow\" - 4:13 # \"Muddy in the Bank\" - 3:20 # \"Ponytail\" - 6:26 ==Personnel== *Steve Swallow - 5 string bass guitar *Tom Harrell - trumpet, flugelhorn *Joe Lovano - tenor saxophone *Mulgrew Miller - piano *Jack DeJohnette - drums ==References== Category:Steve Swallow albums Category:1994 albums ",
