    "text": "Dark Intervals is a live solo piano album by American pianist Keith Jarrett recorded on April 11, 1987 at Tokyo's Suntory Hall and released on the ECM label in 1988.. For a change in Jarrett's solo career on stage, it contains eight short pieces (from 2:55 to 12:53), each with a title and accompanied by applause. Shaping the whole performance as a formal concert, it does not have the pianist signature free-form and long impromptus feel of previous recordings of its kind and it is the first time that the tunes are not tagged with the venue's name and the date of the concert. ==Original notes== The following minimalistic note can be found (no author stated, possibly by Keith Jarrett) in the CD release: ==1987 solo concerts== According to www.keithjarrett.org, in 1987 Jarrett played a total of 9 solo concerts in the U.S., Japan and Brazil:Keith Jarrett 1987 live concerts accessed May 13, 2020.
