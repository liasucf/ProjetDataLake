To accommodate for the expanding business after the turn of the 20th century, the Toof Building was planned by architect G. M. Shaw to serve as the new production and administrative site for the company in downtown Memphis. The building was designed in the architectural style of the Chicago School. The Chicago School utilized new technologies of steel-frame construction with masonry cladding and plate-glass window areas. Focusing on the function of the building rather than its appearance, the style also limited the amounts of ornament on the exterior. Construction of the building was completed in 1913. S. C. Toof & Co. is the oldest printing company in the Memphis area and is still in existence in 2008 under the name Toof Commercial Printing Co., with a business address on S Cooper St in Memphis. In 1982, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The Toof Building is located west of and adjacent to AutoZone Park, a minor league baseball stadium and home of the Memphis Redbirds. In the mid-1990s, plans emerged to establish a minor league baseball museum in the vacant building. Lack of financial support for the museum let the supporters abandon the plans. The privately owned structure is still vacant in 2008, windows and doors are boarded. Since August 2008, the eastern side of the building, facing the AutoZone Park baseball stadium, was prepared for a large-scale mural. The mural was completed in April 2009. ==See also== * Chicago School (architecture) * National Register of Historic Places listings in Shelby County, Tennessee ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Memphis, Tennessee Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1912 Category:1912 establishments in Tennessee Category:National Register of Historic Places in Memphis, Tennessee Category:Chicago school architecture in the United States ",
