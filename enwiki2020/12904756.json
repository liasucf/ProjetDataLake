A New Species of Passiflora (Passifloraceae) from Ecuador with notes on the natural history of its herbivore, Heliconius (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Heliconiiti). Novon 162-166. This species is a member of the subgenus Decaloba. This plant was first described to science in 1998. It was discovered in Ecuador during a 1993 observation of local butterfly fauna. A male telesiphe longwing (Heliconius telesiphe) was noted hovering about a plant, and the eggs and pupae of the species were found on it. The new plant was then named after the butterfly. So far this plant is known only from Zamora-Chinchipe Province. It is found in low Andean forest habitat at around 1700 meters in elevation. ==References== telesiphe Category:Endemic flora of Ecuador Category:Data deficient plants Category:Plants described in 1998 Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
