After moving to Italy, Sylvestre rose to fame winning the 15th series of Italian talent show Amici di Maria De Filippi. His debut extended play, Big Boy, topped the charts in Italy and was certified gold by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry. In 2017, Sylvestre competed in the 67th Sanremo Music Festival and performed \"Con te\", a song co-written by Giorgia, which was included in his self-titled debut album. ==Biography== Sergio Sylvestre was born in Los Angeles to a Mexican mother and a Haitian father. In 2012, Sylvestre visited Southern Italy as a tourist. He later decided to move to Salento, and became the singer of the band Samsara Beach in Gallipoli. Between 2015 and 2016, Sylvestre rose to fame as a contestant of the 15th series of Italian talent show Amici di Maria De Filippi, eventually becoming the series' winner, beating runner-up Elodie. In May 2016, Sylvestre released his debut extended play, Big Boy, composed of four new songs and four cover versions of international hits. Big Boy reached the top spot of the Italian Albums Chart, and was later certified gold by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry. The single with same name was also certified gold in Italy. In Autumn 2016, Sylvestre should have embarked on the Big Boy Live Tour, including ten concerts throughout Italy, but the tour was later canceled due to other projects. He later recorded the song \"Prego\", Italian end credit version of the song \"You're welcome\", in a duet with Italian rapper Rocco Hunt, featured on the soundtrack of Oceania, the Italian version of the animated film Moana. In February 2017, Sylvestre competed in the Big Artists section of the 67th Sanremo Music Festival, performing the song \"Con te\", co-written by Italian singer-songwriter Giorgia.
