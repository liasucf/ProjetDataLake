The campaigns were led by Jiang Wei, a prominent Shu general. Unlike the previous Northern campaings led by Zhuge Liang, which added Wudu and Yinping commanderies to Shu Han state territories, Jiang Wei's campaigns ended up being unpopular in both the military and civil circles in Shu. Also unlike Zhuge Liang's campaigns which often featured 60,000 to sometimes even 100,000 Shu Troops, Jiang Wei's were often much smaller rarely exceeding 30,000 even after the death of Fei Yi, where Jiang Wei assumed control of the military. The Zhuge Liang campaigns did suffer from logistical and supplly issues for their large army. Zhuge's successor Jiang Wan, believed that it was the Hanzhong's mountainous terrain itself that were to blame for the campaigns failures and attempted to switch the route thru the Han river. Fei Yi, who succeeded Jiang Wan, agreed, and never allowed any large campaigns to be launched by Hanzhong. Jiang Wei however overlooked these concerns and used Hanzhong as his home base as Zhuge Liang did. Each campaign was ultimately aborted due to inadequate food supplies, heavy losses on the battlefield, or other reasons. The campaigns drained Shu's already limited resources and preceded the eventual fall of Shu in 263. In popular culture and the 14th- century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the campaigns were erroneously referred to as the \"nine campaigns on the Central Plains\" (\u4e5d\u4f10\u4e2d\u539f). This description is inaccurate because there were actually eleven campaigns instead of nine, and the battles were fought in locations far from the Central Plains. ==Prelude== In 227, China was divided into three competing regimes \u2013 Cao Wei, Shu Han and Eastern Wu \u2013 each with the purpose of reunifying the territories of the fallen Han dynasty under its own control. Between 228 and 234, Zhuge Liang, the chancellor-regent of Shu, had led a series of five campaigns to attack Wei, but each campaign ultimately proved unsuccessful and the overall result was a stalemate. Zhuge Liang died of illness during the fifth campaign in 234. After Zhuge Liang's death, Jiang Wan and Fei Yi, who consecutively succeeded him as the regents of Shu, discontinued his aggressive foreign policy towards Wei and focused more on domestic policies and internal development. There was a six-year-long period of relative peace between Shu and Wei until 240, when the Shu general Jiang Wei decided to follow-up on Zhuge Liang's legacy and continue launching attacks on Wei. ==First expedition (240)== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:5px; float:right; width:45%; font- size: 80%\" ! colspan=3 | Timeline of Jiang Wei's Northern ExpeditionsSanguozhi vols. 26, 33 and 44, and Zizhi Tongjian vols. 75\u201378. |- !

In response, the Wei general Guo Huai led his forces to attack the enemy and drove them towards territory controlled by the Qiang tribes. Jiang Wei withdrew his troops and returned to Shu. In the meantime, Guo Huai attacked the Qiang tribes led by Midang (\u8ff7\u7576) and defeated them. He also received the surrender of over 3,000 Di tribal clans, whom he relocated to the Guanzhong region (present-day central Shaanxi).(\u6b63\u59cb\u5143\u5e74\uff0c\u8700\u5c07\u7f8c\u7dad\u51fa\u96b4\u897f\u3002\u6dee\u9042\u9032\u8ecd\uff0c\u8ffd\u81f3\u5f4a\u4e2d\uff0c\u7dad\u9000\uff0c\u9042\u8a0e\u7f8c\u8ff7\u7576\u7b49\uff0c\u6848\u64ab\u67d4\u6c10\u4e09\u5343\u9918\u843d\uff0c\u62d4\u5f99\u4ee5\u5be6\u95dc\u4e2d\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 26. ==Second expedition (247)== In 247, the Qiang tribes, led by Ehe (\u9913\u4f55), Shaoge (\u71d2\u6208), Fatong (\u4f10\u540c), Ezhesai (\u86fe\u906e\u585e) and others, started a rebellion against Wei in four commanderies: Longxi (around present-day Dingxi, Gansu), Nan'an (\u5357\u5b89; around present-day Wushan County, Gansu), Jincheng (\u91d1\u57ce; around present-day Lanzhou, Gansu) and Xiping (\u897f\u5e73; around present-day Xining, Qinghai). They attacked several cities and towns in the area, and called for Shu forces to support them.(\u516b\u5e74\uff0c\u96b4\u897f\u3001\u5357\u5b89\u3001\u91d1\u57ce\u3001\u897f\u5e73\u8af8\u7f8c\u9913\u4f55\u3001\u71d2\u6208\u3001\u4f10\u540c\u3001\u86fe\u906e\u585e\u7b49\u76f8\u7d50\u53db\u4e82\uff0c\u653b\u570d\u57ce\u9091\uff0c\u5357\u62db\u8700\u5175\uff0c\u6dbc\u5dde\u540d\u80e1\u6cbb\u7121\u6234\u5fa9\u53db\u61c9\u4e4b\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 26. Baihuwen (\u767d\u864e\u6587) and Zhiwudai (\u6cbb\u7121\u6234), two influential tribal kings in Liang Province, responded by rebelling against Wei. When Jiang Wei led Shu forces into Liang Province to support the Qiang rebels, Baihuwen and Zhiwudai submitted to him.(\u662f\u6b72\uff0c\u96cd\u3001\u6dbc\u7f8c\u80e1\u53db\u964d\u6f22\uff0c\u6f22\u59dc\u7dad\u5c07\u5175\u51fa\u96b4\u53f3\u4ee5\u61c9\u4e4b\uff0c\u8207\u96cd\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u90ed\u6dee\u3001\u8a0e\u8700\u8b77\u8ecd\u590f\u4faf\u9738\u6230\u4e8e\u6d2e\u897f\u3002\u80e1\u738b\u767d\u864e\u6587\u3001\u6cbb\u7121\u6234\u7b49\u7387\u90e8\u843d\u964d\u7dad\uff0c\u7dad\u5f99\u4e4b\u5165\u8700\u3002\u6dee\u9032\u64ca\u7f8c\u80e1\u9918\u9ee8\uff0c\u7686\u5e73\u4e4b\u3002) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 75. The Wei imperial court ordered Xiahou Ba to lead troops to garrison at the flank. When Guo Huai and his forces showed up at Didao (\u72c4\u9053; around present-day Lintao County, Gansu), his advisers suggested that they should attack Fuhan County (\u67b9\u7f55\u7e23; in present-day Linxia County, Gansu) and pacify the Qiang tribes first before dealing with the invading Shu forces. Guo Huai predicted that Jiang Wei would attack Xiahou Ba's position, so he headed south to reinforce Xiahou Ba. As he expected, Jiang Wei did attack Xiahou Ba at the west of the Tao River, but retreated when Guo Huai and his reinforcements showed up. Guo Huai then moved on to attack the Qiang rebels, killed Ehe and Shaoge, and forced the thousands of Qiang tribal clans to surrender.(\u8a0e\u8700\u8b77\u8ecd\u590f\u4faf\u9738\u7763\u8af8\u8ecd\u5c6f\u70ba\u7fc5\u3002\u6dee\u8ecd\u59cb\u5230\u72c4\u9053\uff0c\u8b70\u8005\u50c9\u8b02\u5b9c\u5148\u8a0e\u5b9a\u67b9\u7f55\uff0c\u5167\u5e73\u60e1\u7f8c\uff0c\u5916\u6298\u8cca\u8b00\u3002\u6dee\u7b56\u7dad\u5fc5\u4f86\u653b\u9738\uff0c\u9042\u5165\u6e22\u4e2d\uff0c\u8f49\u5357\u8fce\u9738\u3002\u7dad\u679c\u653b\u70ba\u7fc5\uff0c\u6703\u6dee\u8ecd\u9069\u81f3\uff0c\u7dad\u9041\u9000\u3002\u9032\u8a0e\u53db\u7f8c\uff0c\u65ac\u9913\u4f55\u3001\u71d2\u6208\uff0c\u964d\u670d\u8005\u842c\u9918\u843d\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 26.(\u5341\u5e74\uff0c ... \u53c8\u51fa\u96b4\u897f\u3001\u5357\u5b89\u3001\u91d1\u57ce\u754c\uff0c\u8207\u9b4f\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u90ed\u6dee\u3001\u590f\u4faf\u9738\u7b49\u6230\u65bc\u6d2e\u897f\u3002\u80e1\u738b\u6cbb\u7121\u6234\u7b49\u8209\u90e8\u843d\u964d\uff0c\u7dad\u5c07\u9084\u5b89\u8655\u4e4b\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44. ==Third expedition (248)== In 248, Ezhesai (\u86fe\u906e\u585e) and the Qiang rebels occupied fortresses in Heguan (\u6cb3\u95dc; in the vicinity of present-day Dingxi, Gansu) and Baitu (\u767d\u571f; in present-day Minhe County, Qinghai) counties and used them as defences against Wei forces across the Tao River. Guo Huai pretended that he was going to attack from upstream, but actually secretly ordered his troops to cross the river downstream to attack Baitu. The assault was successful and the rebels were defeated. Zhiwudai (\u6cbb\u7121\u6234) led his tribal forces to attack Wuwei Commandery but left his family in Xihai Commandery (\u897f\u6d77\u90e1; near the Juyan Lake Basin, Inner Mongolia). When Guo Huai learnt about it, he led his troops to attack Xihai Commandery, but encountered Zhiwudai and his forces, who were on their way back from Wuwei Commandery. The two armies clashed at the north of Longyi County (\u9f8d\u5937\u7e23; west of present-day Huangyuan County, Qinghai), with the Wei forces emerging victorious and Zhiwudai's forces retreating.(\u4e5d\u5e74\uff0c\u906e\u585e\u7b49\u5c6f\u6cb3\u95dc\u3001\u767d\u571f\u6545\u57ce\uff0c\u64da\u6cb3\u62d2\u8ecd\u3002\u6dee\u898b\u5f62\u4e0a\u6d41\uff0c\u5bc6\u65bc\u4e0b\u6e21\u5175\u64da\u767d\u571f\u57ce\uff0c\u64ca\uff0c\u5927\u7834\u4e4b\u3002\u6cbb\u7121\u6234\u570d\u6b66\u5a01\uff0c\u5bb6\u5c6c\u7559\u5728\u897f\u6d77\u3002\u6dee\u9032\u8ecd\u8da8\u897f\u6d77\uff0c\u6b32\u63a9\u53d6\u5176\u7d2f\u91cd\uff0c\u6703\u7121\u6234\u6298\u9084\uff0c\u8207\u6230\u65bc\u9f8d\u5937\u4e4b\u5317\uff0c\u7834\u8d70\u4e4b\u3002\u4ee4\u5c45\u60e1\u865c\u5728\u77f3\u982d\u5c71\u4e4b\u897f\uff0c\u7576\u5927\u9053\u6b62\uff0c\u65b7\u7d55\u738b\u4f7f\u3002\u6dee\u9084\u904e\u8a0e\uff0c\u5927\u7834\u4e4b\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 26. Jiang Wei led Shu forces from Shiying (\u77f3\u71df; northwest of present-day Xihe County, Gansu) to Qiangchuan (\u5f4a\u5ddd; west of present-day Lintan County, Gansu) to rendezvous with Zhiwudai and his retreating troops. He left Liao Hua behind in Chengzhong Mountain (\u6210\u91cd\u5c71; west of present-day Lintao County, Gansu) to build a fortress and gather the remaining Qiang forces and keep them as hostages in the fortress. When Guo Huai heard about Jiang Wei's advances, he wanted to divide his forces into two groups to attack the enemy. His officers, however, had a different opinion. They expected to Jiang Wei to head west to meet Zhiwudai and combine their forces, while Liao Hua would remain behind to defend the Shu position at Chengzhong Mountain. If they split their army into two, their attacking power would be greatly reduced, and they might end up in a situation where they were able to neither resist Jiang Wei nor capture Liao Hua's position. They urged Guo Huai to concentrate on advancing westward to attack Jiang Wei and Zhiwudai separately before they could meet up.(\u59dc\u7dad\u51fa\u77f3\u71df\uff0c\u5f9e\u5f4a\u5ddd\uff0c\u4e43\u897f\u8fce\u6cbb\u7121\u6234\uff0c\u7559\u9670\u5e73\u592a\u5b88\u5ed6\u5316\u65bc\u6210\u91cd\u5c71\u7bc9\u57ce\uff0c\u6582\u7834\u7f8c\u4fdd\u8cea\u3002\u6dee\u6b32\u5206\u5175\u53d6\u4e4b\u3002\u8af8\u5c07\u4ee5\u7dad\u8846\u897f\u63a5\u5f4a\u80e1\uff0c\u5316\u4ee5\u64da\u96aa\uff0c\u5206\u8ecd\u5169\u6301\uff0c\u5175\u52e2\u8f49\u5f31\uff0c\u9032\u4e0d\u5236\u7dad\uff0c\u9000\u4e0d\u62d4\u5316\uff0c\u975e\u8a08\u4e5f\uff0c\u4e0d\u5982\u5408\u800c\u4ff1\u897f\uff0c\u53ca\u80e1\u3001\u8700\u672a\u63a5\uff0c\u7d55\u5176\u5167\u5916\uff0c\u6b64\u4f10\u4ea4\u4e4b\u5175\u4e5f\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 26. Guo Huai stood by his initial plan and said: \"If we attack Liao Hua, we can catch the enemy off guard. Jiang Wei will then definitely turn back to save Liao Hua. By the time he returns, we would have already defeated Liao Hua. By doing so, we can make Jiang Wei and his men weary from travelling forth and back. If Jiang Wei does not meet the barbarians, the barbarians will retreat on their own. This is the best approach.\" He then instructed Xiahou Ba to lead one detachment to pursue Jiang Wei towards Tazhong (\u6c93\u4e2d; northwest of present-day Zhugqu County, Gansu), while he led the other group to attack Liao Hua. As Guo Huai foresaw, Jiang Wei did turn back to save Liao Hua and failed to meet up with Zhiwudai.(\u6dee\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u4eca\u5f80\u53d6\u5316\uff0c\u51fa\u8cca\u4e0d\u610f\uff0c\u7dad\u5fc5\u72fc\u9867\u3002\u6bd4\u7dad\u81ea\u81f4\uff0c\u8db3\u4ee5\u5b9a\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7dad\u75b2\u65bc\u5954\u547d\u3002\u5175\u4e0d\u9060\u897f\uff0c\u800c\u80e1\u4ea4\u81ea\u96e2\uff0c\u6b64\u4e00\u8209\u800c\u5169\u5168\u4e4b\u7b56\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u4e43\u5225\u9063\u590f\u4faf\u9738\u7b49\u8ffd\u7dad\u65bc\u6c93\u4e2d\uff0c\u6dee\u81ea\u7387\u8af8\u8ecd\u5c31\u653b\u5316\u7b49\u3002\u7dad\u679c\u99b3\u9084\u6551\u5316\uff0c\u7686\u5982\u6dee\u8a08\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 26. ==Fourth expedition (249)== In the spring of 249, the Wei regent Cao Shuang was deposed and executed in a coup launched by his co-regent Sima Yi, who then held full control of the Wei government. Xiahou Ba was then a subordinate of Xiahou Xuan, who held the position of General Who Attacks the West (\u5f81\u897f\u5c07\u8ecd). Xiahou Xuan was a relative of both Xiahou Ba and Cao Shuang. After Cao Shuang's death, Sima Yi summoned Xiahou Xuan back to the capital, Luoyang, and replaced him with Guo Huai. Guo Huai thus became Xiahou Ba's new commanding officer. Xiahou Ba had all along not been on good terms with Guo Huai, so he feared that he would end up like Cao Shuang, hence he fled and defected to Shu.(\u5341\u4e8c\u5e74\u6625\u6b63\u6708\uff0c\u9b4f\u8a85\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u66f9\u723d\u7b49\uff0c\u53f3\u5c07\u8ecd\u590f\u4faf\u9738\u4f86\u964d\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 33.(\u521d\uff0c\u53f3\u5c07\u8ecd\u590f\u4faf\u9738\u70ba\u66f9\u723d\u6240\u539a\uff0c\u4ee5\u5176\u7236\u6df5\u6b7b\u65bc\u8700\uff0c\u5e38\u5207\u9f52\u6709\u5831\u4ec7\u4e4b\u5fd7\uff0c\u70ba\u8a0e\u8700\u8b77\u8ecd\uff0c\u5c6f\u65bc\u96b4\u897f\uff0c\u7d71\u5c6c\u5f81\u897f\u3002\u5f81\u897f\u5c07\u8ecd\u590f\u4faf\u7384\uff0c\u9738\u4e4b\u5f9e\u5b50\uff0c\u723d\u4e4b\u5916\u5f1f\u4e5f\u3002\u723d\u65e3\u8a85\uff0c\u53f8\u99ac\u61ff\u53ec\u7384\u8a63\u4eac\u5e2b\uff0c\u4ee5\u96cd\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u90ed\u6dee\u4ee3\u4e4b\u3002\u9738\u7d20\u8207\u6dee\u4e0d\u53f6\uff0c\u4ee5\u70ba\u798d\u5fc5\u76f8\u53ca\uff0c\u5927\u61fc\uff0c\u9042\u5954\u6f22\u3002) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 75. In autumn, Jiang Wei led Shu forces to attack the Wei- controlled Yong Province, had two fortresses constructed at Qushan (\u9eb4\u5c71; southeast of present-day Min County, Gansu), and ordered his officers Ju An (\u53e5\u5b89) and Li Xin (\u674e\u6b46) to guard them. He also contacted the Qiang tribes and requested assistance from them in harassing the commanderies in Yong Province. Guo Huai discussed with Chen Tai, the Inspector of Yong Province, on how to deal with the Shu invasion. Chen Tai said: \"The fortresses at Qushan may be well-defended, but the roads leading into Shu are difficult to travel, so they will require a sufficient amount of supplies. The Qiang tribes are worried about this weakness of the Shu army, so they may not be willing to help Shu. If we surround the fortresses and attack them, we can easily capture them. Even if Shu reinforcements arrive, the dangerous mountainous terrain will cause them to be worn out.\"(\u79cb\uff0c\u6f22\u885e\u5c07\u8ecd\u59dc\u7dad\u5bc7\u96cd\u5dde\uff0c\u4f9d\u9eb4\u5c71\u7bc9\u4e8c\u57ce\uff0c\u4f7f\u7259\u9580\u5c07\u53e5\u5b89\u3001\u674e\u6b46\u7b49\u5b88\u4e4b\uff0c\u805a\u7f8c\u80e1\u8cea\u4efb\uff0c\u4fb5\u506a\u8af8\u90e1\uff1b\u5f81\u897f\u5c07\u8ecd\u90ed\u6dee\u8207\u96cd\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u9673\u6cf0\u79a6\u4e4b\u3002\u6cf0\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u9eb4\u57ce\u96d6\u56fa\uff0c\u53bb\u8700\u96aa\u9060\uff0c\u7576\u9808\u904b\u7ce7\uff1b\u7f8c\u5937\u60a3\u7dad\u52de\u5f79\uff0c\u5fc5\u672a\u80af\u9644\u3002\u4eca\u570d\u800c\u53d6\u4e4b\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0d\u8840\u5203\u800c\u62d4\u5176\u57ce\uff1b\u96d6\u5176\u6709\u6551\uff0c\u5c71\u9053\u963b\u96aa\uff0c\u975e\u884c\u5175\u4e4b\u5730\u4e5f\u3002\u300d) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 75.(... \u6cf0\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u9eb4\u57ce\u96d6\u56fa\uff0c\u53bb\u8700\u96aa\u9060\uff0c\u7576\u9808\u904b\u7ce7\u3002\u7f8c\u5937\u60a3\u7dad\u52de\u5f79\uff0c\u5fc5\u672a\u80af\u9644\u3002\u4eca\u570d\u800c\u53d6\u4e4b\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0d\u8840\u5203\u800c\u62d4\u5176\u57ce\uff1b\u96d6\u5176\u6709\u6551\uff0c\u5c71\u9053\u963b\u96aa\uff0c\u975e\u884c\u5175\u4e4b\u5730\u4e5f\u3002\u300d) Sanguozhi vol. 22. Guo Huai then ordered Chen Tai, Xu Zhi and Deng Ai to lead Wei forces to attack the fortresses at Qushan and cut off their food and water supplies. Ju An and Li Xin led their men to taunt Deng Ai to attack them, but Deng Ai ignored them. As time passed, the two fortresses gradually ran out of supplies. Jiang Wei led his troops from Mount Niutou (\u725b\u982d\u5c71; west of present-day Zhaohua District, Guangyuan, Sichuan) to reinforce the fortresses. They encountered Chen Tai and his troops along the way. Chen Tai said: \"The Art of War says that the best way to win a battle is to win without fighting. If we manage to occupy Mount Niutou, Jiang Wei's return route will be sealed off and he can be easily captured by us.\" He then ordered his troops to build forts to resist Jiang Wei's forces but refrain from engaging the enemy. At the same time, he also wrote to Guo Huai and requested his help in attacking Mount Niutou. Guo Huai did so and led his troops across the Tao River in preparation for attacking Mount Niutou.(\u6dee\u5f9e\u6cf0\u8a08\uff0c\u4f7f\u6cf0\u7387\u8a0e\u8700\u8b77\u8ecd\u5f90\u8cea\u3001\u5357\u5b89\u592a\u5b88\u9127\u827e\u7b49\u9032\u5175\u570d\u4e4b\uff0c\u65b7\u5176\u904b\u9053\u53ca\u57ce\u5916\u6d41\u6c34\u3002\u5b89\u7b49\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u4e0d\u8a31\uff0c\u5c07\u58eb\u56f0\u7a98\uff0c\u5206\u7ce7\u805a\u96ea\u4ee5\u7a3d\u65e5\u6708\u3002\u7dad\u679c\u4f86\u6551\uff0c\u51fa\u81ea\u725b\u982d\u5c71\uff0c\u8207\u6cf0\u76f8\u5c0d\u3002\u6cf0\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5175\u6cd5\u8cb4\u5728\u4e0d\u6230\u800c\u5c48\u4eba\u3002\u4eca\u7d55\u725b\u982d\uff0c\u7dad\u7121\u53cd\u9053\uff0c\u5247\u6211\u4e4b\u79bd\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u52d1\u8af8\u8ecd\u5404\u5805\u58d8\u52ff\u8207\u6230\uff0c\u9063\u4f7f\u767d\u6dee\uff0c\u6b32\u81ea\u5357\u6e21\u767d\u6c34\uff0c\u5faa\u6c34\u800c\u6771\uff0c\u4f7f\u6dee\u8da3\u725b\u982d\uff0c\u622a\u5176\u9084\u8def\uff0c\u53ef\u5e76\u53d6\u7dad\uff0c\u4e0d\u60df\u5b89\u7b49\u800c\u5df2\u3002\u6dee\u5584\u5176\u7b56\uff0c\u9032\u7387\u8af8\u8ecd\u8ecd\u6d2e\u6c34\u3002\u7dad\u61fc\uff0c\u9041\u8d70\uff0c\u5b89\u7b49\u5b64\u7e23\uff0c\u9042\u7686\u964d\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 22.(\u6dee\u4e43\u4f7f\u6cf0\u7387\u8a0e\u8700\u8b77\u8ecd\u5f90\u8cea\u3001\u5357\u5b89\u592a\u5b88\u9127\u827e\u9032\u5175\u570d\u9eb4\u57ce\uff0c\u65b7\u5176\u904b\u9053\u53ca\u57ce\u5916\u6d41\u6c34\u3002\u5b89\u7b49\u6311\u6230\uff0c\u4e0d\u8a31\uff0c\u5c07\u58eb\u56f0\u7a98\uff0c\u5206\u7ce7\u805a\u96ea\u4ee5\u5f15\u65e5\u6708\u3002\u7dad\u5f15\u5175\u6551\u4e4b\uff0c\u51fa\u81ea\u725b\u982d\u5c71\uff0c\u8207\u6cf0\u76f8\u5c0d\u3002\u6cf0\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5175\u6cd5\u8cb4\u5728\u4e0d\u6230\u800c\u5c48\u4eba\u3002\u4eca\u7d55\u725b\u982d\uff0c\u7dad\u7121\u53cd\u9053\uff0c\u5247\u6211\u4e4b\u79bd\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u6555\u8af8\u8ecd\u5404\u5805\u58d8\u52ff\u8207\u6230\uff0c\u9063\u4f7f\u767d\u6dee\uff0c\u4f7f\u6dee\u8da3\u725b\u982d\u622a\u5176\u9084\u8def\u3002\u6dee\u5f9e\u4e4b\uff0c\u9032\u8ecd\u6d2e\u6c34\u3002) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 75.

Deng Ai remained behind and garrisoned at the north of Baishui (\u767d\u6c34; in present-day Qingchuan County, Sichuan). Three days later, Jiang Wei sent Liao Hua to lead a force to approach Deng Ai's camp from the south of Baishui. Deng Ai told his officers: \"Jiang Wei has turned back to attack us. We have few troops. Ideally, we should cross the river and not build a bridge. I believe Jiang Wei must have sent Liao Hua to hinder us so that we are forced to remain here, while he would attack Taocheng (\u6d2e\u57ce; northeast of present-day Min County, Gansu) from the east.\" Taocheng was located north of the river and was about 60 li away from Deng Ai's position. Deng Ai immediately dispatched troops to travel overnight to Taocheng to defend the fortress. As he expected, Jiang Wei crossed the river to attack Taocheng, but failed to capture the fortress because Deng Ai had already strengthened its defences. Faced with no other viable options, Jiang Wei withdrew his forces back to Shu.(\u65bc\u662f\u7559\u827e\u5c6f\u767d\u6c34\u5317\u3002\u4e09\u65e5\uff0c\u7dad\u9063\u5ed6\u5316\u81ea\u767d\u6c34\u5357\u5411\u827e\u7d50\u71df\u3002\u827e\u8b02\u8af8\u5c07\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u7dad\u4eca\u5352\u9084\uff0c\u543e\u8ecd\u4eba\u5c11\uff0c\u6cd5\u7576\u4f86\u6e21\u800c\u4e0d\u4f5c\u6a4b\u3002\u6b64\u7dad\u4f7f\u5316\u6301\u543e\uff0c\u4ee4\u4e0d\u5f97\u9084\u3002\u7dad\u5fc5\u81ea\u6771\u8972\u53d6\u6d2e\u57ce\u3002\u300d\u6d2e\u57ce\u5728\u6c34\u5317\uff0c\u53bb\u827e\u5c6f\u516d\u5341\u91cc\u3002\u827e\u5373\u591c\u6f5b\u8ecd\u5f91\u5230\uff0c\u7dad\u679c\u4f86\u6e21\uff0c\u800c\u827e\u5148\u81f3\u64da\u57ce\uff0c\u5f97\u4ee5\u4e0d\u6557\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 28. ==Fifth expedition (250)== In 250, Jiang Wei led Shu forces to attack the Wei-controlled Xiping Commandery (\u897f\u5e73\u90e1; around present-day Xining, Qinghai).

Jiang Wei prided himself on his familiarity with the cultures and customs of the Qiang and other non-Han Chinese tribes living in western China. As such, he often thought of inducing these tribal peoples to ally with Shu and launch a coordinated attack on the Wei-controlled territories in present- day Gansu. However, Fei Yi, the Shu regent, strongly disapproved of Jiang Wei's warmongering behaviour towards Wei, and attempted to rein Jiang Wei in by limiting the number of troops he led into battle each time to no more than 10,000. He once told Jiang Wei that they should stop attacking Wei and focus on policies promoting internal stability and prosperity in Shu.(\u6f22\u59dc\u7dad\u81ea\u4ee5\u7df4\u897f\u65b9\u98a8\u4fd7\uff0c\u517c\u8ca0\u5176\u624d\u6b66\uff0c\u6b32\u8a98\u8af8\u7f8c\u3001\u80e1\u4ee5\u70ba\u7fbd\u7ffc\uff0c\u8b02\u81ea\u96b4\u4ee5\u897f\uff0c\u53ef\u65b7\u800c\u6709\u3002\u6bcf\u6b32\u8208\u8ecd\u5927\u8209\uff0c\u8cbb\u7995\u5e38\u88c1\u5236\u4e0d\u5f9e\uff0c\u8207\u5176\u5175\u4e0d\u904e\u842c\u4eba\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u543e\u7b49\u4e0d\u5982\u4e1e\u76f8\u4ea6\u5df2\u9060\u77e3\uff1b\u4e1e\u76f8\u7336\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b9a\u4e2d\u590f\uff0c\u6cc1\u543e\u7b49\u4e4e\uff01\u4e0d\u5982\u4e14\u4fdd\u570b\u6cbb\u6c11\uff0c\u8b39\u5b88\u793e\u7a37\uff0c\u5982\u5176\u529f\u696d\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdf\u80fd\u8005\uff0c\u7121\u70ba\u5e0c\u5180\u5fbc\u5016\uff0c\u6c7a\u6210\u6557\u65bc\u4e00\u8209\uff1b\u82e5\u4e0d\u5982\u5fd7\uff0c\u6094\u4e4b\u7121\u53ca\u3002\u300d) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 76.

After Fei Yi's death, Jiang Wei gained greater control over Shu's armed forces and could do as he wished. In the summer of that year, after learning of the Wu attack on Wei in the east, Jiang Wei led tens of thousands of Shu troops from Shiying (\u77f3\u71df; northwest of present-day Xihe County, Gansu) to besiege Didao (\u72c4\u9053; around present-day Lintao County, Gansu).([\u5341\u516d\u5e74]\u590f\uff0c\u7dad\u7387\u5c07\u6578\u842c\u4eba\u51fa\u77f3\u71df\uff0c\u7d93\u8463\u4ead\uff0c\u570d\u5357\u5b89\uff0c\u9b4f\u96cd\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u9673\u6cf0\u89e3\u570d\u81f3\u6d1b\u9580\uff0c\u7dad\u7ce7\u76e1\u9000\u9084\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44.(\u53ca\u7995\u6b7b\uff0c\u7dad\u5f97\u884c\u5176\u5fd7\uff0c\u4e43\u5c07\u6578\u842c\u4eba\u51fa\u77f3\u71df\uff0c\u570d\u72c4\u9053\u3002) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 76. The Wei regent Sima Shi summoned Yu Song (\u865e\u677e) to seek his opinion on how to deal with the Wu and Shu incursions in the east and west respectively. Yu Song analysed the situation and said that the defences at Hefei were strong enough to resist the Wu attack for some time and that the Wu forces would eventually withdraw once they lost momentum. He suggested that they launch a swift counterattack on the Shu invaders to catch them off guard and drive them back. Sima Shi agreed and ordered Guo Huai and Chen Tai to lead the Wei forces stationed in the Guanzhong region to attack Jiang Wei and lift the siege on Didao. Chen Tai attacked the enemy at Luomen (\u6d1b\u9580; in present-day Wushan County, Gansu).

Li Jian (\u674e\u7c21), the Wei official in charge of Didao (\u72c4\u9053; around present-day Lintao County, Gansu), surrendered to Jiang Wei. Jiang Wei then pressed further to attack Xiangwu County (\u8944\u6b66\u7e23; southeast of present-day Longxi County, Gansu) and engaged the Wei general Xu Zhi in battle. Xu Zhi was defeated and killed, but the Shu army also lost a general, Zhang Ni. The victorious Shu forces then occupied three counties \u2013 Didao, Heguan (\u6cb3\u95dc; in the vicinity of present-day Dingxi, Gansu) and Lintao \u2013 and forced the residents to relocate to Shu-controlled territory.(\u660e\u5e74\uff0c\u52a0\u7763\u4e2d\u5916\u8ecd\u4e8b\u3002\u5fa9\u51fa\u96b4\u897f\uff0c\u5b88\u72c4\u9053\u9577\u674e\u7c21\u8209\u57ce\u964d\u3002\u9032\u570d\u8944\u6b66\uff0c\u8207\u9b4f\u5c07\u5f90\u8cea\u4ea4\u92d2\uff0c\u65ac\u9996\u7834\u6575\uff0c\u9b4f\u8ecd\u6557\u9000\u3002\u7dad\u4e58\u52dd\u591a\u6240\u964d\u4e0b\uff0c\u62d4\u6cb3\u9593\u3001\u72c4\u9053\u3001\u81e8\u6d2e\u4e09\u7e23\u6c11\u9084\uff0c ...)

Jiang Wei ignored him and led a Shu army comprising tens of thousands of troops, with Zhang Yi and Xiahou Ba as his deputies, to attack Wei. Between 18 September and 17 October, the Shu army reached Fuhan County (\u67b9\u7f55\u7e23; northeast of present-day Linxia County, Gansu) and prepared to attack Didao (\u72c4\u9053; present-day Lintao County, Gansu).(\u6f22\u59dc\u7dad\u5fa9\u8b70\u51fa\u8ecd\uff0c\u5f81\u897f\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u5f35\u7ffc\u5ef7\u722d\uff0c\u4ee5\u70ba\uff1a\u300c\u570b\u5c0f\u6c11\u52de\uff0c\u4e0d\u5b9c\u9ef7\u6b66\u3002\u300d\u7dad\u4e0d\u807d\uff0c\u7387\u8eca\u9a0e\u5c07\u8ecd\u590f\u4faf\u9738\u53ca\u7ffc\u540c\u9032\u3002\u516b\u6708\uff0c\u7dad\u5c07\u6578\u842c\u4eba\u81f3\u67b9\u7f55\uff0c\u8da8\u72c4\u9053\u3002) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 76.(\u6642\u7dad\u7b49\u5c07\u6578\u842c\u4eba\u81f3\u67b9\u7f55\uff0c\u8da3\u72c4\u9053\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 22. In the meantime, Wang Jing, the Wei-appointed Inspector of Yong Province, reported the Shu invasion to the general Chen Tai. After Guo Huai died in 255, Chen Tai had succeeded him as General Who Attacks the West (\u5f81\u897f\u5c07\u8ecd) and was now in charge of military affairs in Yong and Liang provinces.(\u6dee\u85a8\uff0c\u6cf0\u4ee3\u70ba\u5f81\u897f\u5c07\u8ecd\uff0c\u5047\u7bc0\u90fd\u7763\u96cd\u3001\u6dbc\u8af8\u8ecd\u4e8b\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 22. Wang Jing reported to Chen Tai that the Shu forces had split into three groups to separately attack Mount Qi (\u7941\u5c71; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu), Shiying (\u77f3\u71df; northwest of present-day Xihe County, Gansu) and Jincheng Commandery (\u91d1\u57ce\u90e1; around present- day Yuzhong County, Gansu). He then requested permission from Chen Tai to lead troops to attack the enemy at Fuhan County and Mount Qi. Chen Tai analysed the situation and concluded that the Shu army's power would be reduced if they split into three groups to attack Liang Province, so he replied Wang Jing and told him to wait and closely observe the enemy's movements first, and then later they would launch a pincer attack on the enemy from the east and west.(\u5f8c\u5e74\uff0c\u96cd\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u738b\u7d93\u767d\u6cf0\uff0c\u4e91\u59dc\u7dad\u3001\u590f\u4faf\u9738\u6b32\u4e09\u9053\u5411\u7941\u5c71\u3001\u77f3\u71df\u3001\u91d1\u57ce\uff0c\u6c42\u9032\u5175\u70ba\u7fc5\uff0c\u4f7f\u6dbc\u5dde\u8ecd\u81f3\u67b9\u7f55\uff0c\u8a0e\u8700\u8b77\u8ecd\u5411\u7941\u5c71\u3002\u6cf0\u91cf\u8cca\u52e2\u7d42\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e09\u9053\uff0c\u4e14\u5175\u52e2\u60e1\u5206\uff0c\u6dbc\u5dde\u672a\u5b9c\u8d8a\u5883\uff0c\u5831\u7d93\uff1a\u300c\u5be9\u5176\u5b9a\u554f\uff0c\u77e5\u6240\u8da3\u5411\uff0c\u9808\u6771\u897f\u52e2\u5408\u4e43\u9032\u3002\u300d) Sanguozhi vol. 22.(\u5f81\u897f\u5c07\u8ecd\u9673\u6cf0\u6555\u96cd\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u738b\u7d93\u9032\u5c6f\u72c4\u9053\uff0c\u9808\u6cf0\u8ecd\u5230\uff0c\u6771\u897f\u5408\u52e2\u4e43\u9032\u3002) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 76. When Chen Tai and his reinforcements reached Chencang (\u9673\u5009; east of present-day Baoji, Shaanxi), Wang Jing had already been defeated by Jiang Wei at Gu Pass (\u6545\u95dc) and retreated across the Tao River. Chen Tai was worried that Wang Jing might not be able to defend the Wei position at Didao, so he led his troops to reinforce Didao. Wang Jing clashed with Jiang Wei at the west bank of the Tao River and was defeated. Left with about 10,000 men, Wang Jing retreated to Didao while his remaining troops were scattered or killed.(\u6cf0\u8ecd\u9673\u5009\uff0c\u7d93\u6240\u7d71\u8af8\u8ecd\u65bc\u6545\u95dc\u8207\u6f22\u4eba\u6230\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u7d93\u8f12\u6e21\u6d2e\u6c34\u3002\u6cf0\u4ee5\u7d93\u4e0d\u5805\u64da\u72c4\u9053\uff0c\u5fc5\u6709\u4ed6\u8b8a\uff0c\u7387\u8af8\u8ecd\u4ee5\u7e7c\u4e4b\u3002\u7d93\u5df2\u8207\u7dad\u6230\u65bc\u6d2e\u897f\uff0c\u5927\u6557\uff0c\u4ee5\u842c\u9918\u4eba\u9084\u4fdd\u72c4\u9053\u57ce\uff0c\u9918\u7686\u5954\u6563\uff0c\u6b7b\u8005\u842c\u8a08\u3002) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 76.(... \u5f8c\u5341\u516b\u5e74\uff0c\u5fa9\u8207\u8eca\u9a0e\u5c07\u8ecd\u590f\u4faf\u9738\u7b49\u4ff1\u51fa\u72c4\u9053\uff0c\u5927\u7834\u9b4f\u96cd\u5dde\u523a\u53f2\u738b\u7d93\u65bc\u6d2e\u897f\uff0c\u7d93\u8846\u6b7b\u8005\u6578\u842c\u4eba\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44.

As he expected, the Wei defenders in Didao experienced a surge in their morale, and the Shu forces were taken by surprise. Jiang Wei ordered his troops to retreat.

When Chen Tai was retreating back to Longxi Commandery, he predicted that Jiang Wei would attempt to make use of the mountainous terrain along the way to lay an ambush, so he took a southern detour back to Longxi.

Deng Ai had a different opinion. He said: \"The defeat at the west of the Tao River wasn't an insignificant loss. The loss of troops and officers, depletion of stores and reserves, and displacement of refugees are signs pointing towards imminent destruction. I shall explain the situation. First, the enemy is riding on a wave of victories, while we're actually weak. Second, the enemy forces are well-trained and battle-ready, while ours are newly recruited and not well- equipped. Third, the enemy is less tired than us because we travel by land while they travel by water. Fourth, the enemy focuses on attacking Didao only, while we spread our defences across four locations \u2013 Didao, Longxi, Nan'an (\u5357\u5b89; around present-day Wushan County, Gansu) and Mount Qi (\u7941\u5c71; the mountainous regions around present-day Li County, Gansu).

In the autumn of 256, as Deng Ai predicted, Jiang Wei led troops from Zhongti to attack Mount Qi but was repelled by the defences set up by Deng Ai earlier. Jiang Wei then headed to Dong Village (\u8463\u4ead; south of present-day Wushan County, Gansu) while Deng Ai stationed his troops at Mount Wucheng (\u6b66\u57ce\u5c71; in present-day Chencang District, Baoji, Shaanxi). Jiang Wei tried to seize control of the mountainous terrain from Deng Ai, but was driven back. That night, Jiang Wei attempted to cross the Wei River to attack Shanggui (\u4e0a\u90bd; present-day Tianshui, Gansu).

Deng Ai was promoted to General Who Guards the West (\u93ae\u897f\u5c07\u8ecd) and put in charge of overseeing military affairs in the region. The reason for Jiang Wei's defeat at Shanggui was the failure of the Shu general Hu Ji to show up in time with reinforcements to assist Jiang Wei. The failure of this ninth expedition resulted in Shu sustaining heavy losses of lives and resources; the people of Shu resented and hated Jiang Wei even more. Jiang Wei wrote a memorial to the Shu imperial court, requesting to be demoted as punishment. The court approved and demoted him to the position of General of the Guards (\u885e\u5c07\u8ecd).

Jiang Wei wanted to take advantage of the situation to stage another invasion of Wei so he led Shu forces through Luo Valley (\u99f1\u8c37) and Shen Ridge (\u6c88\u5dba), both located south of present-day Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi, to attack the Wei garrisons near the Great Wall. Around the time, the Wei garrisons had much supplies stored there but were weakly defended.

In winter, Jiang Wei occupied Taoyang County (\u6d2e\u967d\u7e23; in present-day Lintao County, Gansu) and attacked the Wei general Deng Ai at Houhe County (\u4faf\u548c\u7e23) but lost the battle.

In the years after the death of the Shu chancellor Dong Yun in 246, the eunuch Huang Hao came to power and indirectly controlled the Shu government. Huang Hao wanted to remove Jiang Wei from his position of power and replace him with Yan Yu (\u95bb\u5b87), whom he favoured. When Jiang Wei heard about it, he wrote to the Shu emperor Liu Shan to accuse Huang Hao of corruption and treachery, and urge Liu Shan to execute Huang Hao. However, Liu Shan replied, \"Huang Hao is merely a minor official. In the past, I hated it when he got into conflict with Dong Yun. Why should you mind him?\" Jiang Wei saw that Huang Hao had many supporters in the imperial court and realised that he had gotten himself into trouble when he openly denounced Huang Hao. Hence, he decided to retreat to Tazhong and garrison there instead of returning to the capital, Chengdu.(\u521d\uff0c\u7dad\u4ee5\u7f88\u65c5\u4f9d\u6f22\uff0c\u8eab\u53d7\u91cd\u4efb\uff0c\u8208\u5175\u7d2f\u5e74\uff0c\u529f\u7e3e\u4e0d\u7acb\u3002\u9ec3\u7693\u7528\u4e8b\u65bc\u4e2d\uff0c\u8207\u53f3\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u95bb\u5b87\u89aa\u5584\uff0c\u9670\u6b32\u5ee2\u7dad\u6a39\u5b87\u3002\u7dad\u77e5\u4e4b\uff0c\u8a00\u65bc\u6f22\u4e3b\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u7693\u59e6\u5de7\u5c08\u6063\uff0c\u5c07\u6557\u570b\u5bb6\uff0c\u8acb\u6bba\u4e4b\uff01\u300d\u6f22\u4e3b\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u7693\u8da8\u8d70\u5c0f\u81e3\u8033\uff0c\u5f80\u8463\u5141\u6bcf\u5207\u9f52\uff0c\u543e\u5e38\u6068\u4e4b\uff0c\u541b\u4f55\u8db3\u4ecb\u610f\uff01\u300d\u7dad\u898b\u7693\u679d\u9644\u8449\u9023\uff0c\u61fc\u65bc\u5931\u8a00\uff0c\u905c\u8fad\u800c\u51fa\u3002\u6f22\u4e3b\u6555\u7693\u8a63\u7dad\u9673\u8b1d\u3002\u7dad\u7531\u662f\u81ea\u7591\u61fc\uff0c\u8fd4\u81ea\u6d2e\u967d\uff0c\u56e0\u6c42\u7a2e\u9ea5\u6c93\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u6562\u6b78\u6210\u90fd\u3002) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 78.(\u4e94\u5e74\uff0c\u7dad\u7387\u8846\u51fa\u6f22\u3001\u4faf\u548c\uff0c\u70ba\u9127\u827e\u6240\u7834\uff0c\u9084\u4f4f\u6c93\u4e2d\u3002\u7dad\u672c\u7f88\u65c5\u8a17\u570b\uff0c\u7d2f\u5e74\u653b\u6230\uff0c\u529f\u7e3e\u4e0d\u7acb\uff0c\u800c\u5ba6\u81e3\u9ec3\u7693\u7b49\u5f04\u6b0a\u65bc\u5167\uff0c\u53f3\u5927\u5c07\u8ecd\u95bb\u5b87\u8207\u7693\u604a\u6bd4\uff0c\u800c\u7693\u9670\u6b32\u5ee2\u7dad\u6a39\u5b87\u3002\u7dad\u4ea6\u7591\u4e4b\u3002\u6545\u81ea\u5371\u61fc\uff0c\u4e0d\u5fa9\u9084\u6210\u90fd\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 44.(\u83ef\u967d\u570b\u5fd7\u66f0\uff1b\u7dad\u60e1\u9ec3\u7693\u6063\u64c5\uff0c\u555f\u5f8c\u4e3b\u6b32\u6bba\u4e4b\u3002\u5f8c\u4e3b\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u7693\u8da8\u8d70\u5c0f\u81e3\u8033\uff0c\u5f80\u8463\u5141\u5207\u9f52\uff0c\u543e\u5e38\u6068\u4e4b\uff0c\u541b\u4f55\u8db3\u4ecb\u610f\uff01\u300d\u7dad\u898b\u7693\u679d\u9644\u8449\u9023\uff0c\u61fc\u65bc\u5931\u8a00\uff0c\u905c\u8fad\u800c\u51fa\u3002\u5f8c\u4e3b\u52d1\u7693\u8a63\u7dad\u9673\u8b1d\u3002\u7dad\u8aaa\u7693\u6c42\u6c93\u4e2d\u7a2e\u9ea5\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u5167\u903c\u723e\u3002) Huayang Guo Zhi annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 44. In 262, the Wei regent Sima Zhao had the intention of launching a campaign to conquer Shu. In 263, three separate Wei armies led by Zhong Hui, Deng Ai and Zhuge Xu invaded Shu. While Jiang Wei led Shu forces to hold off Zhong Hui and Zhuge Xu's forces at the mountain pass Jiange (\u528d\u95a3; in present-day Jiange County, Sichuan), the Wei army led by Deng Ai took a more dangerous route across mountainous terrain, bypassed Shu's defences, and showed up at the Shu capital, Chengdu. The Shu emperor Liu Shan, having been taken by surprise, voluntarily surrendered to Deng Ai, thus bringing an end to the Shu state's existence. ==In Romance of the Three Kingdoms== The expeditions are covered in chapters 107, 109\u2013115 in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which dramatises and romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. They were referred to as the \"nine campaigns on the Central Plains\" (\u4e5d\u4f10\u4e2d\u539f). This description is inaccurate because historically there were eleven campaigns instead of nine, and the battles were fought in locations far from the Central Plains. ==In popular culture== Some of the expeditions are featured as playable stages in the seventh instalment of Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game series. However, the battles are not necessarily in chronological order. ==Notes== ==References== ;Citations from the Sanguozhi ;Citations from the Sanguozhi zhu ;Citations from the Zizhi Tongjian * Chen, Shou.
