For drug discovery and development scientists, Eurofins DiscoverX is the trusted product solutions provider that accelerates research and drug discovery programs with confidence for cytokine receptors, checkpoint receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), kinases, ion channels, epigenetics, nuclear receptors, and other target families. Eurofins DiscoverX develops and manufactures cutting edge assays, stable cell lines, ready-to-use kits (including bioassays), membrane preps, enzymes, and reagents for small molecule and biologic immuno-oncology, cytotoxicity, compound-target engagement, potency and QC lot release, pharmacotrafficking, and many other applications. These products are developed from 3 R&D; and manufacturing centers of excellence \u2013 San Francisco Bay Area (Fremont, California); St. Louis area, St. Charles, Missouri; and Poitiers, France. The company is built around a proprietary technology called enzyme fragment complementation or EFC which forms the basis of the assays that they design and market. In EFC, two \u03b2-galactosidase fragments are employed which are themselves inactive. One fragment (EA) has an inactivating deletion while the second fragment (ED) has a complementing fragment; in solution where both EA and ED are present, certain pairs of fragments combine spontaneously to form active complexes. Some pairs of fragments interact only weakly and combine to produce enzyme activity only when forced into close proximity by virtue of their attachment to proteins which bind to each other. This property permits evaluation of intracellular protein interactions for use in high throughput screening of drug candidates for their effect on specific cellular pathways. The company offers a wide variety of cell lines that produce such fusion products.
