It lies to the northwest of the crater Vavilov and east of the Tsander\u2013Kibal'chich crater pair. This is a circular crater with a slightly eroded outer rim. The interior floor is nearly featureless, with only a few tiny craterlets marking the surface. It is named after the writer Geoffrey Chaucer. ==Satellite craters== By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Chaucer. {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Chaucer !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Latitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Longitude !width=\"25%\" style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Diameter |- |align=\"center\"|B |align=\"center\"|6.5\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|137.4\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|27 km |- |align=\"center\"|P |align=\"center\"|1.8\u00b0 N |align=\"center\"|141.3\u00b0 W |align=\"center\"|13 km |} ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
