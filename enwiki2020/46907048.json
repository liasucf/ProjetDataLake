He was loaned to Modena, Gorica, Den Bosch and Ascoli over the next three seasons. He left Juventus in July 2017, signing a three-year contract with Hibernian. He scored his first goal for Hibernian on 12 August, in a 3-2 win against Rangers. Slivka missed over two months of the 2017-18 season due to a hamstring injury. In his first appearance after the injury, Slivka scored the second goal for Hibs in a 2-1 win against Celtic. During the following season Slivka maintained an unusual streak of only scoring goals for Hibs against either half of the Old Firm, scoring in the first minute of a 2-0 win at home to Celtic. Slivka was one of three first team players released by Hibs at the end of the 2019-20 season. On 31 August 2020, Slivka signed for Super League Greece club Apollon Smyrnis. https://www.tv3.lt/m/naujiena/sportas/1056996/vykintas-slivka-karjera-tes- graikijoje ==International career== On 5 June 2015, Slivka made his debut for Lithuania in a friendly match against Hungary.
