Not much else is known about Herbert's early life except that his father's name was Herbert and that he was most likely a mobster working for Jewish mob boss Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel (due to the fact that he moved to Los Angeles at the same time Siegel did). == Los Angeles == When his boss, Benjamin Siegel, moved out to Los Angeles, California, Herbert did the same. When he moved to L.A., he worked as an enforcer for the Siegel-Cohen crime family. On June 20, 1947, Siegel was murdered by an apparent East Coast Mafia hitman with a .30 Caliber military M1 Carbine.
