After they kiss, Jos\u00e9 arrives and the narrator flees only to hear, as he is running away, the young woman using on Jos\u00e9 the exact enticing words she used on him, suggesting she lures every suitor she meets with the same \"script\". ==References== Category:1964 singles Category:Jay and the Americans songs Category:RPM Top Singles number-one singles Category:Songs written by Bobby Hart Category:Songs written by Tommy Boyce Category:1964 songs Category:Songs written by Wes Farrell Category:United Artists Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Billy Sherrill Category:Johnny Duncan (country singer) songs Category:Janie Fricke songs Category:Song recordings produced by Artie Ripp ",
