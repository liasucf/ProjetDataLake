    "text": "Robert Lee Oliver (February 8, 1943 \u2013 April 19, 2020) was an American professional baseball first baseman and outfielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates (1965), Kansas City Royals (1969\u201372), California Angels (1972\u201374), Baltimore Orioles (1974), and New York Yankees (1975). He batted and threw right-handed. ==Career== ===Minor leagues=== Born in Shreveport, Louisiana, Oliver lettered in baseball and basketball at Highlands High School in North Highlands, California, a suburb of Sacramento. After graduating in 1961, he played college baseball at American River College, where he was heavily scouted. Signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates before the 1963 season, Oliver played in the Pirates' farm system for four seasons, with a late call-up in 1965, during which he made his major league debut. Oliver was traded to the Minnesota Twins and spent two more seasons in Minor League Baseball (MiLB). ===Major leagues=== Oliver made the big leagues for good in 1969, having been selected by the Kansas City Royals in the previous October's expansion draft. Playing on a young team that included fellow rookies Pat Kelly and Lou Piniella \u2014 the eventual American League (AL) Rookie of the Year \u2014 Oliver batted .254, with 13 home runs, and 43 runs batted in (RBI), in 118 games played. That year, he achieved two firsts in Royals history: 1) He was the first Royal to collect six hits in a nine- inning game (only two other Royals, Kevin Seitzer in 1987 and Joe Randa in 2004, have since accomplished this feat), with a 6-for-6 performance in a May 4 victory over the California Angels; and 2) He hit the Royals' first-ever grand slam, the shot coming off Jim Bouton in the first game of a July 4 doubleheader against the American League's other 1969 expansion team, the Seattle Pilots. 1970 was a breakout year for Oliver; he established career highs in home runs (27),RBI (99), and runs scored (83). Oliver enjoyed two more solid seasons: 1972 (during which he was traded to the California Angels), batting .269, with 20 home runs, and 76 RBI; and 1973, batting .265, with 18 home runs, and 89 RBI, while splitting his time as a utility player. The Baltimore Orioles acquired him for the 1974 stretch drive; Oliver appeared in nine games for the team. After the season, his contract was purchased by the New York Yankees, but Oliver only saw limited duty, in 1975. During his career, Oliver batted .256, with 94 home runs, and 419 RBI, in 847 games played. ==Other interests and death== While a member of the California Angels, Oliver moonlighted as a police officer for the Santa Ana Police Department. In the offseason he was a school resource officer. Oliver managed the Sacramento Steelheads, in 1999. He has also worked at two baseball schools in Sacramento County: operating his own Baseball Academy in Sacramento, as well as working as a hitting instructor at Dusty Baker's Baseball Camp in Rancho Cordova. Oliver's son Darren also played in MLB, from 1993\u20132013. Both father and son are former teammates of Nolan Ryan: Bob from 1972 to 1974, and Darren as a rookie with the Texas Rangers in 1993 (Ryan's final major league season). Oliver died on April 19, 2020, at the age of 77, in Rio Linda, California. ==See also== *List of Major League Baseball single-game hits leaders ==References== ==External links== *Bob Oliver at SABR (Baseball BioProject) *Bob Oliver at Pura Pelota (Venezuelan Professional Baseball League) * * Category:1943 births Category:2020 deaths Category:African-American baseball players Category:American expatriate baseball players in Mexico Category:American River Beavers baseball players Category:Angeles de Puebla players Category:Asheville Tourists players Category:Baltimore Orioles players Category:Baseball players from Louisiana Category:California Angels players Category:Cardenales de Lara players Category:Columbus Clippers players Category:Columbus Jets players Category:Criollos de Caguas players Category:Denver Bears players Category:Florida Instructional League Pirates players Category:Florida Instructional League Royals players Category:Gastonia Pirates players Category:Iowa Oaks players Category:Kansas City Royals players Category:Kinston Eagles players Category:Macon Peaches players Category:Major League Baseball first basemen Category:Major League Baseball outfielders Category:Navegantes del Magallanes players Category:New York Yankees players Category:Oklahoma City 89ers players Category:Omaha Royals players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Rojos del \u00c1guila de Veracruz players Category:Sportspeople from Shreveport, Louisiana ",
