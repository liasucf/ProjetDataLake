Mu\u00f1oz is widely considered to be one of the greatest offensive linemen in NFL history.https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/gallery/best-offensive-linemen-in-nfl- history-anthony-munoz-forrest-gregg-bruce-matthews-032315 He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1998. ==Early life and college career== Mu\u00f1oz went to Chaffey High School in Ontario, California. He played college football at the University of Southern California. He also played baseball there, pitching for USC's national championship team in 1978. ==NFL career== ===Cincinnati Bengals=== Mu\u00f1oz was the third overall pick in the 1980 NFL Draft by the Cincinnati Bengals. His selection was viewed as a major risk by many pundits since knee problems limited the 6 ft. 6 in., 280-pound Mu\u00f1oz to just a combined 16 games in his junior and senior seasons, though he did return for USC's 17\u201316 Rose Bowl win over Ohio State University on New Year's Day in 1980. However, Mu\u00f1oz became a starter in his rookie season and remained a fixture at left tackle for the Bengals for 13 seasons and is considered one of, if not the greatest offensive linemen in NFL history. Despite his history of injuries, Mu\u00f1oz missed just three games during his first 12 seasons. His rigorous workout routine included working out in the weight room he had installed in his home and running three to four miles every day. In addition to his talents as a blocker, Anthony Mu\u00f1oz was also a capable receiver, notching seven receptions for 18 yards and scoring four touchdowns on tackle- eligible plays, including one in 1984 from rookie quarterback Boomer Esiason against the Cleveland Browns in Cleveland. Mu\u00f1oz played both Bengals' Super Bowl appearances, XVI and XXIII, both narrow losses to the San Francisco 49ers. ===Tampa Bay Buccaneers/Retirement=== After missing much of the 1992 season battling knee and shoulder injuries, Mu\u00f1oz attempted to play a 14th season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but he was released before the season started and decided to retire shortly after. ===Legacy=== Mu\u00f1oz was the Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1981, and 1988, and was awarded the NFL Players Association Lineman of the Year honors in 1981, 1985, 1988, and 1989.profootballresearchers.org The NFL Alumni Association voted Munoz the Offensive Lineman of the Year four times (1987, 1989\u20131991). He won the Seagram's Seven Crowns of Sports award for Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1981 and 1986. At the time of his retirement, his Pro Bowl selections were tied with Tom Mack for the most ever by an offensive lineman in league history, and also set the Bengals franchise record as well. In 1994, Mu\u00f1oz was named to the National Football League 75th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 1999, he was ranked #17 on Sporting News list of the 100 greatest football players and was the highest-ranked offensive lineman.TSN Presents - Football's 100 Greatest Players In 2010, he was ranked #12 on the NFL Network's The Top 100: NFL's Greatest Players list and again was the highest-ranked offensive lineman. ==Movies and television== Mu\u00f1oz appeared in two motion pictures: 1980's Borderline as \"Guatemalan\" and 1983's The Right Stuff (an Academy Award nominee for Best Picture) as \"Gonzalez\".

The renaming ceremony was held on June 26, 1998, and was attended by Mu\u00f1oz, his family, city officials, and Ontario residents. The park is the place where Anthony Mu\u00f1oz met his wife DeDe after a pickup softball game during his youth.
