His articles about football would come much later. Panzeri's articles about football were notables for the way he dealt with the sport, with emphasis on analysing the game rather than writing a simple chronicle. By the late 1940s, Panzeri was one of the most renowned journalists of El Gr\u00e1fico along with Ricardo Lorenzo Rodr\u00edguez (mostly known for his nickname Borocot\u00f3) and F\u00e9lix Frascara. In the 1950s Panzeri became director of the magazine. During his tenure as director, he brought to the magazine sports journalists such as Pepe Pe\u00f1a, Osvaldo Ardizzone and former Boca Juniors player Ernesto Lazzatti. Panzeri opposed to the excessive use of tactics in football, with Juan Carlos Lorenzo, Osvaldo Zubeld\u00eda, Argentino Geronazzo and Jos\u00e9 D'\u00c1mico as some trainers that were accused of being excessively obsessed with tactics. Close to Ernesto Lazzatti and Adolfo Pedernera, Panzeri alleged that the use of tactics distorted the essence of the game.Hoy hubiese cumplio 99 a\u00f1os El Gr\u00e1fico by Ernesto Cherquis Bialo on Infobae, 30 Jan 2018 After the 1962 FIFA World Cup held in Chile, Panzeri left his charge in El Gr\u00e1fico, after he was pressed to publish advertisements of then Ministry of Economy, Alvaro Alsogaray.
