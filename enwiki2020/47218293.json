In the book she presents the story of Brazilian theatre through nine well-known female performers: *Bibi Ferreira *Eva Todor *Eva Wilma *Beatriz Lyra *Norma Blum *Laura Cardoso *Ruth de Souza *Nicette Bruno *Beatriz Segall In the book she painted a picture of Brazilian theatre against the backdrop of several centuries, where Jesuits used theatre in the 16th century to spread European civilisation among the indigenous population, theatrical revues started mid-19th century, and early 20th century witnessed new experimentation on stage. While authoring the book, she also noticed that this new generation of performers all tried to counter the norm of the ruling military dictatorship.R\u00e9, Adriana del (29 May 2011): \"Grandes damas do teatro\". estadao.com.br.
