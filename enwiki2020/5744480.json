    "text": "Glory of St Francis of Sales, Louvre Museum Lorenzo de Caro (baptised 29 May 1719 \u2013 2 December 1777) was an Italian painter, active in the late Baroque style in his native city of Naples. ==Biography== Decaro's biographical information is sparse, and many canvases refer to painter of Neapolitan origin, active between 1740 and 1761. His name was known only from the autograph on the canvases. Decaro is known to have married the 22-year-old Anna Mariana Bozza on 28 February 1743. The couple had 10 children. According to a \u201ccensus\u201d of the local parish in 1757, the painter\u2019s studio was in Vicolo della Porta piccola del Rosario, a narrow street between the areas of Chiaia and the Spanish Quarter. Decaro lived and worked at that address, according to recently discovered documentation in the archives of the Banco di Napoli, reflecting the \u201cpublic banks of Naples\u201d. The records of the Banco San Giacomo include receipts of rent payments made by the painter in 1768 and 1769 to his landlord, the Prince of Cannito, for \u201ctwo rooms and cellar on the ground floor of the house of the aforesaid Prince in the Sant\u2019Anna di Palazzo road\u201d. ==Works in Naples== *Church of SS Philip and James (San Gennaro Chapel): St Peter of Alcantara in Glory (known also as St Peter confessing Santa Teresa (1759), Santa Teresa of Avila in ecstasy (1758), Allegory of the faith, of St Januarius in glory, (known also as Decapitation of San Gennaro, St Francis receiving stigmata, and Glory of Angels; *Church of Santi Severino e Sossio: Paintings of Saint James (destroyed), and of St Jerome; *Church of San Bonifacio : Restoration of painting by Belisario Corenzio; *Church of Sant'Agostino alla Zecca: Autographed painting: Church closed and art moved elsewhere; *Church of the Annunziata: Restoration of painting by Belisario Corenzio, (1746). *Church of Santa Maria la Scala \u2013 Naples: Painting of the Virgin, restored; *Church of San Gerolamo : Virgin with Saints Jerome and Bartholomew (1750, lost from Madonna of the Carmine); *Church of San Diego all\u2019Ospedaletto: Apparition to St Pasquale de Baylon (first chapel on the right), and the Glory of the Saints; *Church of Jesus and Mary: Painting of the Calvary, stolen in 1979; *Church of Santa Caterina di Siena: Madonna of souls of purgatory and Mystical Marriage of St Catherine; *Church of Santa Maria della Neve, known today as San Giuseppe a Chiaia, Naples: Paintings of Saints Vincent Ferrer and Ludovic Bertrand (or St Louis); *Church of Holy Mary of Patience \u201calla Cesarea\u201d: Paintings of the allegory of faith (1761) and of the Ecstasy of Saint Pasquale de Baylon; *Church of Holy Mary of good counsel at Capodimonte: Painting of Our Lady of Sorrows; *Hospital of the Santissima Trinit\u00e0 dei Pellegrini: Ceiling fresco portraying St Philip Neri kneeling.

The work of the artist listed above, as well as other recent research, is proof of the fact that Lorenzo De Caro was Neapolitan, as were his forebears, and that he spent virtually his whole life in Naples. The only time he spent \u201cbeyond the city walls\u201d would have been to carry out a certain number of commissioned works: in the province of Frosinone, at San Germano (now Cassino) for paintings in the local cathedral in 1740 and for the church of the Virgin Mary dell\u2019Olivella in S. Elia Fiumerapido. He went to Bracigliano (in the province of Salerno) in order to paint the frescoes of the Calvary on one of the walls of the cloister of the convent of Saint Francis. ==References== *\u201cNapoli Nobilissima\u201d, (V series, volume III, parts I-II, January April 2002, Ediz.Arte Tipografica, Napoli) entitled Note archivistiche su Lorenzo De Caro, pittore napoletano del \u2018700 by Gustavo De Caro. *Lorenzo De Caro pittore del \u2019700 napoletano (edizioni O\u00e8dipus, Salerno/Milano, 2005). ==External links== Category:1719 births Category:1777 deaths Category:18th-century Neapolitan people Category:18th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Neapolitan painters Category:Rococo painters Category:Baroque artists ",
