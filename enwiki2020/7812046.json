O'Neill's parents moved around much in O'Neill's youth: O'Neill spent time in Mozambique as a toddler and in Turkey until the age of four, and he also lived in Iran. From the age of six, O'Neill lived in the Netherlands, where he attended the Lyc\u00e9e fran\u00e7ais de La Haye and the British School in the Netherlands. He read law at Girton College, Cambridge, preferring it over English because \"literature was too precious\" and he wanted it to remain a hobby. O'Neill started off his literary career in poetry but had turned away from it by the age of 24. After being called to the English Bar in 1987, he spent a year writing his first novel. O'Neill then entered full-time practice as a barrister in London, principally in the field of business law.\"Interview with Joseph O'Neill - Part 3\", The Elegant Variation, 15 July 2009. Since 1998 he has lived in New York City. ==Career== ===Writing=== O'Neill is the author of four novels. Netherland was published in May 2008 and was featured on the cover of the New York Times Book Review, where it was called \"the wittiest, angriest, most exacting and most desolate work of fiction we've yet had about life in New York and London after the World Trade Center fell\". It was also included in The New York Times list of the 10 Best Books of 2008. Literary critic James Wood called it \"one of the most remarkable postcolonial books I have ever read\". In an interview with the BBC in June 2009, US President Barack Obama revealed that he was reading it, describing it as \"an excellent novel.\" Among the books on the longlist, it was the favourite to win the Man Booker Prize. However, on 9 September 2008, the Booker nominee shortlist was announced, and the novel failed to make the list.
