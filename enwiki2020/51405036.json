He competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics without qualifying for the final. Ivanov won bronze medals at the 2017 Asian Championships and 2018 Asian Games. His personal bests in the event are 20.95 metres outdoors (Almaty 2019) and 20.51 metres indoors (Ust-Kamenogorsk 2016), both being the current national records. Ivanov took up shot put in 2006 following his brother. A month later, aged 14, he competed at his first national championships. He regularly trains in Portugal because his coach Vladimir Zinchenko is based in that country. ==International competitions== {| |- !colspan=\"6\"|Representing |- |rowspan=2|2009 |rowspan=2|World Youth Championships |rowspan=2|Brixen, Italy |32nd (q) |Shot put (5 kg) |16.53 m |- | \u2013 |Discus throw (1.5 kg) |NM |- |rowspan=2|2010 |rowspan=2|Asian Junior Championships |rowspan=2|Hanoi, Vietnam |5th |Shot put (6 kg) |16.12 m |- |6th |Discus throw (1.75 kg) |50.75 m |- |2012 |Asian Indoor Championships |Hangzhou, China |6th |Shot put |17.74 m |- |2013 |Asian Championships |Pune, India |7th |Shot put |18.34 m |- |2014 |Asian Beach Games |Phuket, Thailand |bgcolor=cc9966|3rd |Shot put |17.42 m |- |2015 |Asian Championships |Wuhan, China |7th |Shot put |17.78 m |- |2016 |Olympic Games |Rio de Janeiro, Brazil |33rd (q) |Shot put |17.38 m |- |rowspan=3|2017 |Asian Championships |Bhubaneswar, India |bgcolor=cc9966|3rd |Shot put |19.41 m |- |Universiade |Taipei, Taiwan |14th (q) |Shot put |17.22 m |- |Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games |Ashgabat, Turkmenistan |bgcolor=gold|1st |Shot put |19.60 m |- |rowspan=2|2018 |Asian Indoor Championships |Tehran, Iran |5th |Shot put |18.31 m |- |Asian Games |Jakarta, Indonesia |bgcolor=cc9966|3rd |Shot put |19.40 m |- |rowspan=2|2019 |Asian Championships |Doha, Qatar |bgcolor=cc9966|3rd |Shot put |19.09 m |- |World Championships |Doha, Qatar |30th (q) |Shot put |19.73 m |} ==References== Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Kazakhstani male shot putters Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Kazakhstan Category:People from Almaty Region Category:Medalists at the 2018 Asian Games Category:Asian Games bronze medalists for Kazakhstan Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2018 Asian Games Category:Asian Games medalists in athletics (track and field) ",
