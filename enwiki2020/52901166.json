It will be located within a development being erected by Cafritz in the Fort Totten neighborhood. A pre-opening exhibit, also called Explore!, will be held at the National Portrait Gallery. It will include portrait-related exhibits where children can make portraits with media, making self-portraits or portraying their caregivers with portraits involving selfies, or using art supplies. Sponsored by Jane Cafritz and Calvin Cafritz, Morton and Grace Bender, and Paul and Rose Carter, it is slated to run at the Portrait Gallery for a year. ==See also== * KID Museum ==References== Category:Museums in Washington, D.C.
