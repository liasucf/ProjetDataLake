When Gasperd goes to his mine he finds Benson's men in possession, he having acquired it through a legal technicality. Broken in health and spirit, Gaspard waits. Benson marries Thalie and, in the seven years that follow, she becomes ill and dies, leaving a son. Benson is thrown in jail for shooting a Swede, whom Gaspard had urged to fight Benson. Gaspard takes the child to his cabin and, knowing that Benson will come after his release from prison to claim his child, plans an awful revenge. He arranges a trap in his cabin that he hopes Benson will walk into and be eaten by a hungry wolf that has been penned up. The boy, however, walks into the trap, and Gaspard is nearly killed rescuing him. Then Benson comes, and Gaspard, having learned a lesson, turns the boy over to him and wishes them Godspeed. ==Cast== *Lon Chaney as Gaspard the Good *Alan Hale as Benson *Dagmar Godowsky as Thalie *Stanley Goethals as The Boy *Irene Rich as The Teacher *Spottiswoode Aitken as The Factor *Herbert Standing as The Priest *Frank Campeau as The Police Sergeant ==Production== The Trap was filmed in Yosemite National Park in California. ==Survival status== Several prints of The Trap exist and it is available on DVD.Progressive Silent Film List: The Trap at silentera.com ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1922 films Category:American films Category:American silent feature films Category:English-language films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Robert Thornby Category:1920s Western (genre) drama films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:American Western (genre) drama films Category:1922 drama films ",
