By the time, his father Yi Kang was already 62 while his mother, Lady Hong was 19. The place he was born, Sadong Palace (\uc0ac\ub3d9\uad81), was lost after 1945. The rising of the Syngman Rhee government also caused many of their family properties to be confiscated. After the outbreak of the Korean War, Yi Seok and his family had to leave their residence in Samcheong-dong and lived in poverty. At the beginning of the era of Republic of Korea, the Imperial family was banished from the Imperial palace, but their life became better after the president Park Chung Hee gained power. When studying Hankook University of Foreign Studies in Seoul, Yi Seok learned foreign languages, principally Spanish, as well as foreign relations and history, becoming fluent in them, and he prepared himself for the diplomatic service.

He said, \"There are many things to do in Jeonju since this is where the Joseon dynasty founded. I'm going to spread the culture of the royal family and re-illuminate Jeonju's history.\" On 16 July 2005, Yi Seok's cousin Yi Ku passed away without an heir, and the Jeonju Lee Royal Family Association announced, on July 22, that Yi Won would become Yi Ku's successor according to his will. During the funeral, Yi Seok was angered by the decision and commented that \"the funeral is yet ended, and it's inappropriate to discuss about adopting an heir by now\". Later, Yi Seok claimed that \"adopting a son after death doesn\u2019t make any sense,\" and he also claimed that Yi Bangja, his late aunt and the mother of Yi Ku, named him as \"first successor\" in her will.
