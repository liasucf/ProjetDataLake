    "text": "The Giles W. Dalby Correctional Institution is a privately operated prison located in Post, Garza County, Texas, operated by the Management and Training Corporation under contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The facility is owned by the county. It opened in 1999, houses federal \"deportable alien\" detainees, and has a working capacity of 1732. In August 2016, Justice Department officials announced that the FBOP would be phasing out its use of contracted facilities, on the grounds that private prisons provided less safe and less effective services with no substantial cost savings. The agency expects to allow current contracts on its thirteen remaining private facilities to expire. ==References== Category:Prisons in Texas Category:Buildings and structures in Garza County, Texas Category:Management and Training Corporation Category:1999 establishments in Texas ",
