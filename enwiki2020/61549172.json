    "text": "St Peter's Church (, ) is a 19th century church of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church located in Tartu, Estonia. ==St Peter's Parish== The parish separated from the St Mary's parish and was created on 27 October 1869. The congregation used St. John's Church, Tartu until the new church was built. ==Church building== The cornerstone of St Peter's Church was laid on 31 May 1883. The Neo-Gothic church was built between 1883 and 1884 on the design of architect Viktor Schr\u00f6ter. The church was consecrated on 16 September 1884. The church was finally completed in 1903 when the church's western tower was completed, on design of Georg Hellat. The cost of building the church was 110,000 rubles, and most of the money was raised through donations.EELK Tartu Peetri kirik, Visit Tartu, retrieved 19 August 2019 ==Interior== The interior of the church is also predominantly Neo-Gothic. The interior features a remarkable altar wall dating from 1900, the work of Gustav Beermann, an altar painting \"The Calling Christ\" dating from 1897, the work of Johann K\u00f6ler, and an organ with 22 pipes which was made in 1891 by Wilhelm M\u00fcllverstedt.Historical Overview, St Peter's Church, retrieved 19 August 2019 ==Soviet times== In 1948, after St Mary's parish lost their church property, St Peter's was also used by St Mary's congregation as their parish church, which remained in place till 1997. Church membership also declined drastically by the 1980s due to the atheistic propaganda of the Soviet state, from 22,378 in 1912 to 483 in 1985. However, membership started to increase again during the late 1980 and early 1990s, in the last few years of the Soviet Union. ==References== ==Gallery== File:PeetriKirikuOrel.jpg|Organ File:TartuPeetriKirikuSisevaade.jpg|Altar File:Narva mnt Tartus.JPG File:Peetri kirik1 2010-05-15.JPG|In 2010 Category:19th-century churches Category:Lutheran churches in Estonia Category:Buildings and structures in Tartu Category:Churches in Tartu ",
