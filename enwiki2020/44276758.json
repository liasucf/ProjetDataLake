    "text": "\"Lips Are Movin\" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Meghan Trainor for her major-label debut studio album Title (2015). It was co-written by Trainor and its producer, Kevin Kadish. MTV News premiered the song on October 15, 2014. Epic Records released \"Lips Are Movin\" to US contemporary hit radio as the second single from the album on October 21, 2014. A retro- tinged doo-wop and pop song, \"Lips Are Movin\" is about Trainor leaving her significant other after discovering he is cheating on her. Contemporary critics compared the song's musical styles and formula\u2014girl-group harmonies, bubblegum pop hooks\u2014to its predecessor, Trainor's debut single \"All About That Bass\" (2014). Some reviewers commented that the similarities paved a way for Trainor's signature retro-tinged sound and commercial success, while others were critical of the repetitiveness. \"Lips Are Movin\" reached number four on the US Billboard Hot 100, making Trainor the fifth female artist to follow her debut single which reached number-one with a second top-five entry. It reached the top 10 on charts in various countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand and received 4\u00d7 Platinum certifications in the US and Australia. Philip Andelman directed the music video for \"Lips Are Movin\", commissioned by technology corporate Hewlett- Packard. It features appearances by several social media influencers and portrays behind-the-scenes events during the music video's shoot. Following its release on November 19, 2014, Billboards Andrew Hampp described it as a \"historic milestone in the realm of YouTube creators\". Trainor performed \"Lips Are Movin\" on several shows such as Today, The Voice, and Dancing with the Stars, and included it on the 2015 That Bass and MTrain Tour, and The Untouchable Tour (2016) set lists. ==Background and release== alt=Kevin Kadish in a black shirt and unbuttoned checkered t-shirt wearing glasses Meghan Trainor began her career as a songwriter for other artists and signed a publishing deal with Nashville-based music publishing firm Big Yellow Dog Music in 2012. Kevin Kadish met her in June 2013 at the request of Carla Wallace, the co-owner of Big Yellow Dog. Kadish liked Trainor's voice and booked a writing session with her. They subsequently co-wrote Trainor's debut single \"All About That Bass\" (2014), and Kadish co-wrote and produced eight tracks on her major-label debut studio album Title (2015). After the album's completion, Trainor's A&R; suggested that the two keep writing more songs. Trainor overheard the track for \"Lips Are Movin\" through Kadish's headphone box and insisted they write it that day. Trainor started singing the song's verse after Kadish came up with the line \"I know you're lying, your lips are moving\", and they finished writing it within eight minutes. He spoke fondly about writing with Trainor: \"It's almost like we share a brain musically when we're writing a song. I've never had that with anyone before.\" MTV News reported the song \"Title\" (2014) would be released as Trainor's second single, in September 2014. Kadish went to New York to meet with L.A. Reid, the chairman of Epic Records, and voiced his regret at not having \"Lips Are Movin\" ready in time for the release of the Title EP (2014), and its release as the follow-up single. Reid announced at the meeting that he was going with it as the second single and scrapping \"Title\", and was quoted as saying, \"I think this song will do better.\" On October 14, 2014, a low-quality version of \"Lips Are Movin\", and its artwork leaked online. The song was made available on mobile application Shazam, on the same date and premiered on MTV News the following day. Epic Records serviced it to contemporary hit radio in the United States on October 21, and released it for digital download in various countries. The record label sent \"Lips Are Movin\" to radio stations in the United Kingdom on December 26, 2014, and Italy on January 16, 2015. In the UK, the song was made available to those who pre-ordered Title, with its digital release as a single being held back until January 18. Sony Music released a CD single exclusively for sale by US retailer Best Buy on December 30, 2014, and in Germany on February 13, 2015. ==Composition and lyrics== \"Lips Are Movin\" is 3:01 in length. Billboards Gary Trust characterized the song as doo-wop and pop. Composed in the key of G major it's tempo is 139 beats per minute. Kadish plays the acoustic bass, baritone saxophone, drums, guitar, and piano, while David Baron plays the organ. It has a retro sound, along with handclaps and a post-chorus chant reminiscent of \"All About That Bass\". The song's lyrics reference the latter with the line, \"I gave you bass/You gave me sweet talk.\" The use of girl-group harmonies and bubblegum pop hooks has also been a point of comparison; Trainor has admitted they \"follow the [same] formula\". On \"Lips Are Movin\", Trainor assumes a Southern-inflected patois and delivers half- sung, half-rapped vocals over its retro melody and saxophone beat. Trainor's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of B5 on it; the chord progression is G\u2013Am\u2013C\u2013G. VH1 described \"Lips Are Movin\" as \"a feisty, upbeat track\" that \"has some spunky lyrics\". According to James Cowan of Canadian Business, the song \"shares the same girl-group-influenced harmonies, wry lyrics and candy palette\" of \"All About That Bass\". Its lyrics are about Trainor leaving her significant other after discovering that he is cheating on her; they include, \"if your lips are movin', then you're lyin', lyin', lyin, babe\". Seventeens Megan Friedman identified the subject of \"Lips Are Movin\" as \"a cheating, lying, boyfriend\", but Kadish later claimed Trainor's frustrations with her record label inspired it: \"It was a point for [Trainor] because she had been dealing with stuff from her label. So, it wasn't technically about a guy; it was about her record label.\" ==Critical reception== \"Lips Are Movin\" received widespread comparisons to \"All About That Bass\" from music critics. They described it as an upbeat and catchy \"anthem\" for women\", \"another pop classic\", and \"a song that's going to rock the music world\". Critics noted positive similarities between \"Lips Are Movin\" and \u201cAll About That Bass,\u201d. One reviewer enjoyed the song's references to its predecessor, saying, \"when you need a pick-me-up song to help you brush off the haters, you can count on Meghan Trainor\". A Billboard magazine reviewer gave the song three-and-a-half stars, writing that it was helping to solidify Trainor \"as the self-proclaimed queen of her own genre, 'she-wop\". Reviewers complimented Trainor's \"considerable skill at pastiche and performance\", and its display of her versatility, confidence, vulnerability, and smartness. Riley Jones of Complex magazine included the song at number three on his list of \"The Most Motivating Songs to Get You to the Gym\", deeming it best for indoor cardio. A USA Today critic called it much better than \"All About That Bass\"; that it sounded like a remix of Trainor's debut single, but its sonic similarities to Christina Aguilera's \"What a Girl Wants\" (1999) saved it from being a \"complete mess\". A negative review said \"Lips Are Movin\" is \"whitewashed into a fairly anodyne mush ... the hip-hop bump and plush basslines that intrude ... are pure cosmetic window dressing\". Other critics felt the track sounded too similar to its predecessor, and concluded that it seems designed to milk the success of [Trainor's] breakout hit\", writing that it \"strictly adheres to the same beat sheet as its predecessor\", and that the two songs are \"nearly interchangeable\". Billboards , Carl Wilson complimented the lyrics, saying that Trainor is \"serving notice that she had more going on than a topical trifle\", but concluded that it was risking \"coming off as 'Bass, Part 2\". Another writer found \"Lips Are Movin\" as crafty as \"All About That Bass\", but also as vexing, and called it one of Titles dozens of variations of her debut single. In a review for Clash magazine, Alice Levine remarked: \"This is again the same factory produced sass and pseudo-feminist empowerment that we heard on her number one hit \u2013 but hearing it a second time round loses some of its novelty.\" Another critic derided \"Lips Are Movin\" for following \"the formula of 'All About That Bass' to a tee\", writing that Trainor \"steals from herself\" with the song and is \"a plunderer first and foremost\". Peter Robinson of The Guardian said \"Lips Are Movin\" sounded nearly identical to \"All About That Bass\", but was worse, whileSpin magazine's critic dismissed the song as \"the oldest-joke-in-the-book-ask-a-lawyer\". ==Chart performance== \"Lips Are Movin\" debuted at number 93 on the Billboard Hot 100 issued for November 8, 2014. On December 10, 2014, the song moved from number 13 to number eight and became Trainor's second consecutive top-10 entry, selling 110,000 digital downloads and earning 7.8 million streams. \"Lips Are Movin\" peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100 issued for December 27, it sold 116,000 digital downloads and received 8 million streams during the tracking week.

It premiered on Trainor's Vevo account on November 19, 2014. She told MTV News, \"Here's me being sassy and other people dancing with me and having just a good time and trying to get through this feeling of, Ugh he's cheating on me again.\" Information technology corporation Hewlett-Packard commissioned the video. It features several social media influencers\u2014actors, dancers and set designers with large social media followings. These include American actress Liza Koshy, French dancers Les Twins, American dancer Chachi Gonzales, and Pomeranian dog Barkley the Pom. Andelman suggested showcasing behind-the-scenes events occurring during a music video shoot, which was used as the video's theme. Trainor's team asked the ad agency 180LA to make the music video similar to that for \"All About That Bass\" and not stray too far from it. ===Synopsis=== The music video for \"Lips Are Movin\" featured many social media influencers. alt=Five people, surrounded by a huge pair of lips, dance. In the music video, Trainor, in a black leather jacket, sings into a red microphone in front of a pastel blue backdrop. She is sometimes with backup dancers, surrounded by television screens. Lips are used as a motif throughout the video; they appear as close-ups of Trainor's mouth and as a large drawing in the backdrop. Yahoo! Music writer Lyndsey Parker compared the latter to the aesthetic of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Trainor wears lip- shaped earrings and sunglasses in the video, and is seen lying on a lip-shaped sofa, which Parker compared to those in American television program So You Think You Can Dance. The video's set changes constantly; props are elevated on-and-off screen by workers throughout the clip. ===Reception=== The music video received over 2,500,000 YouTube views in less than two days. Billboards Andrew Hampp said its production was a \"historic milestone in the realm of YouTube creators\". James Cowan believed that \"cynics will view this as a decidedly stodgy brand trying to make itself hip by hanging out with cool kids. But a less-jaded eye might call it something else\u2014arts patronage for the 21st century.\" Mike Pell of MTV UK wrote that the clip continued the \"bubbly and bright\" theme of the \"All About That Bass\" video, and that Trainor's kitten-themed top in it resembled the one Katy Perry wore at the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards. Parker remarked about Trainor's fashion in the video; and said it \"seems to be an unofficial campaign to land her own M.A.C. Viva Glam endorsement deal\". Fuse's Hilary Hughes wrote that the video was a bold and sassy sentiment, and that its style shift from \"All About That Bass\" \"definitely made a statement\". She described the video's dance routine as \"fierce\", and called it \"a super-meta technicolor dance party\". Mashable's Brian Anthony Hernandez wrote that \"the visuals are what you would expect from a bouncy pop song: young dancers, colorful backgrounds, quirky outfits and exaggerated expressions\". ==Live performances== Jingle Ball Tour on December 10, 2014. Trainor performed \"Lips Are Movin\" live on NBC's Today on November 5, 2014, at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade on November 27, and on the finale of The Voices seventh season on December 16.
