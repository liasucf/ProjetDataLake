    "text": "Stewart Park is located in Aberdeen, Scotland. It is a site owned by Aberdeen City Council. The land was originally bought by the council in 1891, when Woodside was incorporated into Aberdeen, using \u00a3500 bequeathed by Mrs. Jane Taylor the widow of Mr. John Taylor, a merchant in the city \"for a playground for the children of Woodside\". The park was named after a former Lord Provost of the city, Sir David Stewart. The park contains whale jaw bones presented to the park in 1903 by the Captain of the Arctic whaler Benbow. There is an intricate fountain designed as a replica of an Italian lavabo which was sculptured by Arthur Taylor of Jute Street, Aberdeen and erected in 1903 and was dedicated to Mrs. Jane Taylor whose bequest had funded the purchase of the land for the park. There are nearby all weather tennis courts and bordered-off cricket and football pitches.
