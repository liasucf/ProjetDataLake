    "text": "Stephen Dunifer (born 1951/1952) is an American radio engineer, author and anarchist socialist who founded Free Radio Berkeley in 1993 Berkeley, California. == Free Radio Berkeley == Free Radio Berkeley, an unlicensed micropower pirate radio station, was an expression of Dunifer's socialist anarchist principles, and was inspired by Black Liberation Radio in Springfield, Illinois and by Japanese micropower radio stations. Free Radio Berkeley was involved in a protracted legal case with the Federal Communications Commission in the mid-1990s. At the time, it was illegal to broadcast on less than 100 watts. They were eventually acquitted of all charges. FRB eventually stopped broadcasting and turned their resources to developing new micropower technology and training activists in the use of pirate radio. They were replaced on the dial by Berkeley Liberation Radio, which has also been a target of the federal government. Dunifer is also the author of several books on the micropower movement. He was coeditor, along with Ron Sakolsky, of Seizing the Airwaves: A Free Radio Handbook. Dunifer offers a variety of radio broadcast kits and accessories for sale through his website. == References == ==External links== * www.FreeRadio.org Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American anarchists Category:American radio company founders ",
