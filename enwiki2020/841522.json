He led the efforts of Japan to develop an atomic bomb during World War II. ==Life== Yoshio Nishina, Llewellyn Thomas and Friedrich Hund, in Copenhagen in 1926 Nishina was born in Satosh\u014d, Okayama. He received a silver watch from the Emperor as he graduated at the top of his class at Tokyo Imperial University as an electrical engineer in 1918. He became a staff member at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (now RIKEN) where he became started studying physics under Hantaro Nagaoka. In 1921, he was sent to Europe for research. He visited some European universities and institutions, including Cavendish Laboratory, Georg August University of G\u00f6ttingen, and University of Copenhagen. In Copenhagen, he did research with Niels Bohr and they became good friends. In 1928, he wrote a paper on incoherent or Compton scattering with Oskar Klein in Copenhagen, from which the Klein\u2013Nishina formula derives. In 1929, he returned to Japan, where he endeavored to foster an environment for the study of quantum mechanics. He established Nishina Laboratory at RIKEN in 1931, and invited some Western scholars to Japan including Heisenberg, Dirac and Bohr to stimulate Japanese physicists. It was also in 1931 when he lectured about Direc theory in Kyoto, which was where he met and was attended by Hideki Yukawa and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga.p.94 of \"Quantum revolution: Qed: the jewel of physics\", Volume 2 by G. Venkataraman On 7 August 1945, Nishina led a team of scientists sent by the Japanese high command to confirm whether or not Hiroshima was attacked by an atomic bomb. After making the physical measurements necessary to confirm the bomb's nature, he wired his confirmation of an atomic bomb back to Tokyo on August 8.p.235 of \"Radioactivity: Introduction and History, From the Quantum to Quarks\" by Michael F. L'Annunziata His laboratory was severely damaged during World War II and most equipment had to be discarded and rebuilt after the war.Yoshio Nishina \u2013 Father of Modern Physics in Japan. Nishina Foundation The U.S. Army Occupation forces dismantled his cyclotrons on 22 November 1945 and parts were dumped into Tokyo Bay. The incident caused a huge furor in the U.S. in its aftermath.Yoshikawa, Hideo and Joanne Kauffman, Science Has No National Boundaries: Harry C. Kelly and the Reconstruction of Science and Technology in Postwar Japan. Cambridge: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press 1994, pp 6-9. Nishina later published an article on his reaction to the cyclotron's destruction.Nishina, Yoshio. \u201cA Japanese Scientist Describes the Destruction of his Cyclotron.\u201d Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists 3 (June 1947) American physicists Harry C. Kelly and Gerald Fox were recruited to the U.S. Occupation forces. Fox stayed a few months in Japan, but Kelly stayed until 1950 and became friends with Nishina, who spoke English. At one point, the US Army formulated a list of Japanese scientists to purge, which included Nishina's name. Asked to vet Nishina by US intelligence officers, Kelly took the file home and made the assessment that \u201cHe was an international scholar, respected all over the world. And he had spoken out against the war. I said it was against everyone\u2019s interests to purge that man.\u201dquoted in Boffey, Philip M. \u201cHarry C. Kelly: An Extraordinary Ambassador to Japanese Science.\u201d Science. New Series, vol. 169, no. 3944 (July 31, 1970) p. 451. Nishina sought to restart Japanese science following the war and found an ally in Kelly. Two issues were most important for Nishina, acquiring radio isotopes for research for a variety of non-military purposes and attempting to preserve Riken as an institution for scientific research. The U.S.Army Occupation forces were seeking to dismantle it on the basis of anti-monopoly concerns. Riken owned stocks of some large companies. When an interim agreement was worked out, Nishina became head of the reorganized Riken.Yoshikawa and Kauffman, pp. 79, 88-91. Nishina died from liver cancer in 1951.Sin-Itiro Tomonaga Yoshio Nishina, His Sixtieth Birthday , November 20, 1950 (updated January 11, 1951) Since Nishina's widow was ailing herself, help with care of Nishina's children, Yuichiro and Kojiro, came from Nishina's assistant at Riken, Sumi Yokoyama. Harry Kelly, Nishina's friend and colleague, remained close to the family after Nishina's death; his ashes were buried in a grave beside Nishina's in Tama cemetery in Tokyo, in a ceremony attended by Nishina's and Kelly's families.Yoshikawa and Kauffman,Science Has No National Boundaries,pp. 92-93, 105. The crater Nishina on the Moon is named in his honor. ==Work== Nishina co-authored the Klein\u2013Nishina formula. His research was concerned with cosmic rays and particle accelerator development for which he constructed a few cyclotrons at RIKEN. In particular, he detected what turned out to be the muon in cosmic rays, independently of Anderson et al. He also discovered the uranium-237 isotope and pioneered the studies of symmetric fission phenomena occurring upon fast neutron irradiation of uranium (1939\u20131940), and narrowly missed out on the discovery of the first transuranic element, neptunium. He was a principal investigator of RIKEN and mentored generations of physicists, including two Nobel Laureates: Hideki Yukawa and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga. During World War II, he was the head of the Japanese nuclear weapon program. ==In popular culture== Nishina appears as a character in Harry Turtledove's science fiction novel series Worldwar. He can also be selected as a \"Nuclear Scientist\" advisor for Japan in the grand strategy game Hearts of Iron IV. ==See also== *Nishina Memorial Prize ==References== Category:1890 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Hibakusha Category:Japanese scientists Category:Japanese physicists Category:Recipients of the Order of Culture Category:University of Tokyo alumni Category:People from Okayama Prefecture Category:Deaths from liver cancer Category:Riken personnel ",
