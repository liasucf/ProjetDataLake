    "text": "Carlo Gesualdo's Tenebrae Responsoria (1611) Responsories for Holy Week (Latin: Responsoria pro hebdomada sancta) are polyphonic settings for the matins responsories, not of the whole of Holy Week, but only of the last three days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday. Until the 1955 reform of the Holy Week ceremonies by Pope Pius XII, matins and lauds of these days were normally anticipated on the evening of the preceding day and were celebrated with the special ceremonies of Tenebrae.Thomas Pope, Holy Week in the Vatican (Dublin 1874), p. 70 As a result, the readings and the responsories are sometimes associated respectively with Holy Wednesday, Maundy Thursday and Good Friday, rather than with Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday. Also before 1955 the term Triduum Sacrum, which now includes Easter Sunday and takes in only the close of Maundy Thursday, was applied to the whole of Maundy Thursday, including its matins, and excluded Easter Sunday.Frederick Aquilina, Benigno Zerafa (1726-1804) and the Neapolitan Galant Style (Boydell & Brewer, 2016), p. 74 Composers who produced polyphonic settings for the responsories in question, which are known also as the Tenebrae responsories, include Carlo Gesualdo (Responsoria et alia ad Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae spectantia, 1611, Jean L'H\u00e9ritier, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, 19 settings (H 111 -119, H 126 - 134 and H 144), Joseph Haydn (Hob XXIIb), Jan Dismas Zelenka (ZWV 55), Max Reger, Francis Poulenc, Pierre Boulez. Composers generally set to music only some of the 27 responsories. == The responsories == Within the liturgy, each responsory followed a reading. Each day's matins was divided into three nocturns, each with three readings. Over the three days, therefore, the responsories, like the readings, came to a total of 27. They were originally sung in plainchant. Each day, the first nocturn had three readings from Jeremiah's Book of Lamentations, and the second nocturn three readings from one or other of Saint Augustine's commentaries on the Psalms. The three readings of the third nocturn were from the First Epistle to the Corinthians on Maundy Thursday, from the Epistle to the Hebrews on the other two days.Liber Usualis 1961, pp. 631\u2212773 == Maundy Thursday responsories == Maundy Thursday is called in Latin Feria V/Quinta in Cena Domini (an older spelling has Coena instead of Cena), meaning Thursday (fifth day of the week) of the Lord's Supper. Compositions for its nine responsories can therefore appear under such titles as Feria V \u2013 In Coena Domini. They can also be named by the day on which they were actually sung, as Charpentier's Les neuf r\u00e9pons du mercredi saint (\"The nine responsories of Holy Wednesday\"). ===Responsories of the first nocturn of Maundy Thursday=== The three readings of the first nocturn of Maundy Thursday are Lamentations 1:1\u20135, 1:6\u20139 and 1:10\u201314. ====In monte Oliveti==== The first Maundy Thursday responsory refers to the Agony of Christ in Gethsemane at the foot of the Mount of Olives. * ====Tristis est anima mea==== The second responsory represents Jesus speaking to his disciples in the garden of Gethsemane.
