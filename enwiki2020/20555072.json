It was first broadcast between 9 and 30 August 2004 on France 2. ==Synopsis== Antoine returns to his home near Aix-en-Provence after sailing around the world, only to learn that the girl he had loved twenty-five years earlier, Isaure Castella, has drowned in the lake 'Waters Mirrors'. Her drowning was suspicious and Antoine's return unveils a lot of mysteries. For some time, Gabrielle has had the feeling that Isaure is back. It started with the reopening of her bedroom that her mother had locked in order not to awaken the past. Additionally, Alice, the daughter of Alexandra, has visions and regularly sees Isaure in \"Water Mirrors\". Alexandra is the mistress of both Nicolas and Robin, the latter a police inspector whose relationship with Alexandra is rather strained. Fortunately, he meets Anna, a teacher, who is actually about to marry, but is confused and in search of her identity. To make matters worse, the niece of Antoine, Anais, drowns in the same way as Isaure. The inspector Robin is in charge of the inquiry, and the investigation will unveil secrets that had been buried with great care by the grandmother of the family, Suzanne Castella. ==Cast== * Line Renaud: Suzanne Castella * Christiana Reali: Gabrielle * Cl\u00e9mentine C\u00e9lari\u00e9: Jos\u00e9pha * Bernard Yerl\u00e8s: Antoine * Clio Baran: Elena * Jean-Claude Adelin: Nicolas Aubry * Thierry Neuvic: Robin * Ga\u00ebla Le Devehat: Anna * Didier Bienaim\u00e9: Paul Marange * Val\u00e9rie Mairesse: Jeanne * Caroline Baehr: Alexandra * Gabrielle Valli\u00e8res: Alice * Jean-Marie Juan: Emmanuel * Fran\u00e7ois Caron: Mathieu * Malcolm Conrath: Guillaume * Lizzie Brocher\u00e9: Ana\u00efs * Julien Bravo: Yann * Karina Testa: Isaure Category:French drama television series Category:Television shows set in France ",
