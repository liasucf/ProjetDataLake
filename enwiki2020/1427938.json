    "text": "The Indiana Ice was a Tier I junior ice hockey team and member club of the United States Hockey League (USHL) that was formed in 2004 when the Danville Wings were purchased and moved from their location in Danville, Illinois, to Indianapolis, Indiana. The Ice captured the regular season division titles in the 2007\u201308 and 2013\u201314 seasons and won the 2009 and 2014 Clark Cup titles. Before the 2012\u201313 season, the Ice played their home games at the Indiana Farmers Coliseum. From 2012 to 2014, the Ice split their home games between the Bankers Life Fieldhouse and the Pan American Arena. The Ice played in the Eastern Conference/Division of the United States Hockey League. The USHL has granted the team in dormancy status for the 2014\u201315 season while the organization focuses on development of a new facility. In January 2015, the USHL approved of the team's proposed future home, the Lyceum Pavilion, in the Indianapolis area. During this time, the Indiana Ice organization remained a member club in the USHL, with membership on its board and full rights to participate in the business and operations of the league. Since then, there have been no updates on the status of the team. ==Season-by-season record== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !
