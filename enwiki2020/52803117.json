    "text": "Dioscorea dumetorum, also known as the bitter yam, cluster yam, or three- leaved yam, is a species of yam in the genus Dioscorea that is found in Africa. ==Description== D. dumetorum has distinctive trifoliate leaves, similar to the Indian three-leaf yam Dioscorea hispida. Its wild form is highly toxic due to the high content of dihydrodioscorine, which is used for making arrow poison in some areas. In order to remove toxins, the wild form needs to be leached in water for days and thoroughly cooked. D. dumetorum is mainly cultivated in the Bight of Biafra region from southeast Nigeria to Gabon, as well in the Ubangi-Shari region of inland Central Africa. ==Vernacular names== Local names for D. dumetorum in West African languages: *Owere language (Igboid): \u0254\u0300n\u00e0 *Ibibio language: \u00e1n\u00eam *Tiv language: \u00edn\u00edmbe *Duala language: mb\u00e1 *Boyela language (Bantu): moma ==See also== *Yam production in Nigeria ==References== Category:Crops originating from Africa Category:Flora of West-Central Tropical Africa Category:Flora of Nigeria dumetorum ",
