    "text": "Christian Felix Wei\u00dfe (1769) by Anton Graff Christian Felix Wei\u00dfe (1726\u20131804) was a German writer and pedagogue. Wei\u00dfe was among the leading representatives of the Enlightenment in Germany and is regarded as the founder of German children's literature. ==Life== Wei\u00dfe was born as twin on 28 January 1726 in Annaberg in the Ore Mountains as the son of Christian Heinrich Wei\u00dfe and his wife, Christian Elisabeth. His father was rector at a Latin school and teacher for oriental and modern European languages. When Wei\u00dfe was one year old, the family moved to Altenburg, Thuringia, 45 km south of Leipzig, where he then attended the Gymnasium and made his first attempts at writing poetry. His father had died in 1730. His family moved then to Leipzig, where he studied philology and theology from 1745 until 1750 at the University of Leipzig. During this time, he became acquainted with Christian F\u00fcrchtegott Gellert, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Friederike Caroline Neuber, Gottlieb Rabener and Ewald Christian von Kleist. After he finished his studies, Wei\u00dfe became a private tutor to the Count Geyersberg, also a student in Leipzig. Friedrich Nicolai asked Wei\u00dfe in 1759 to become editor of the magazine Bibliothek der sch\u00f6nen Wissenschaften (Library of the Beautiful Sciences) which Nicolai had founded two years before; Wei\u00dfe published this magazine and its successor until 1788. The same year, 1759, Wei\u00dfe travelled to Paris; on his return, he relinquished the tutur position and became social companion to Count Schulenburg on the count's castle in Burgscheidungen. Wei\u00dfe became district tax collector in Leipzig in 1762 and married in the following year Christiane Platner, the daughter of a renowned Leipzig surgeon and sister of Ernst Platner. In 1790, the patronage of Count Schulenburg allowed him to acquire the castle in St\u00f6tteritz (today part of Leipzig). He redesigned it completely and established an English garden. The property changed from an estate to a summerhouse and garden where a salon sees guests like Christian Garve, Christoph Martin Wieland, Moritz August von Th\u00fcmmel and Jean Paul. Children's magazine Der Kinderfreund (part 11, 1781). Apart from his poetry and plays, Wei\u00dfe had great success with his magazine Der Kinderfreund (The Children's Friend) which he published from 1775 until 1782 in 24 volumes; it is regarded as the first magazine for children in Germany. Four of his poems were set to music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Wei\u00dfe was not appreciated by the literary representatives of the then new movement, Sturm und Drang. His most lasting success were the librettos to Johann Adam Hiller's Singspiele. Wei\u00dfe died on 16 December 1804 in St\u00f6tteritz; he is buried in the Alter Johannisfriedhof in Leipzig. He was survived by his wife who died in 1813. A notable child from this marriage was the historian and jurist Christian Ernst Wei\u00dfe. ==Works== ;Librettos Almost all of the works by Johann Adam Hiller are set to librettos by Wei\u00dfe, in particular: * Die verwandelten Weiber (1766) * Lottchen am Hofe (1767) * Die Jagd, (1770) Works by other composers include: * Der Dorfbarbier, music (1771) by Christian Gottlob Neefe and Johann Adam Hiller * Romeo und Julie by Georg Benda is based on Wei\u00dfe's translation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet ;Comedies * Die Freundschaft auf der Probe (1768) (Friendship Tested) * Collection in 3 volumes (1783) vignette to Briefwechsel der Familie des Kinderfreundes, by Daniel Chodowiecki ;Tragedies * Die Befreyung von Theben (1764) (The Liberation of Thebes) * Collection in 5 volumes (1776\u20131780) ;Children's books and non-fiction * Beytrag zum deutschen Theater (5 volumes, 1759\u20131768) (Contribution to the German Theatre) * Kleine Lieder f\u00fcr Kinder (1766) (Little Songs for Children) * Neues ABC-Buch (1772) (New Alphabet Book) * Der Kinderfreund (24 volumes, 1775\u20131782) (The Children's Friend) * Briefwechsel der Familie des Kinderfreundes (12 volumes, 1784\u20131792) (Letters from the Family of the Children's Friend) * Achthundert neue noch nie gedruckte R\u00e4thsel (1791) (Eight hundred Never-Before Printed Riddles) * Christian Felix Wei\u00dfens Selbstbiographie (1806) (Autobiography) ==References== * ==External links== * *Christian Felix Weisse at zeno.org *Poems Category:1726 births Category:1804 deaths Category:People from Annaberg- Buchholz Category:Writers from Leipzig Category:German children's writers Category:18th-century German poets Category:German opera librettists Category:German male poets Category:German male dramatists and playwrights Category:18th-century German dramatists and playwrights Category:18th-century German writers Category:18th-century male writers ",
