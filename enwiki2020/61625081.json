The Oracles of Agathagelos was also later republished by Rigas Feraios, promoting the revolutionary spirit of the enslaved Greeks, because they prophesied the future liberation of the Greeks.Dimitrios Michalopoulos, \u0391\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03ac\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2. \u0391\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7 \u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03cd\u03b3\u03c7\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 [Agathagelos.

(\u03c3\u03b5\u03bb.247) During his trips to Europe he visited Menorca, where he also served as a teacher and a pastor. All in all, Theoklitos came in contact with social, political, diplomatic and religious practices throughout Europe. He was concerned about the political implications of the Reformation and studied the problems that concerned the Greek diaspora. Sacra Tuba Fidei Apostolicae, Sanctae, Oecumenicae ac Orthodoxae Graecanae Orientalis Ecclesiae Christi, a work of Polyeidis in Latin He then attempted to mobilize the enslaved Greeks by verifying old prophecies of the Byzantine Empire. He wrote Agathangelos (el),Study of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki a well known prophetic work which was published, with minor variations, widely in Greece, either as a brochure (by Rigas Feraios) or as a book in Athens and Ermoupoli (1837-38). He dates the oracles back to the 13th century (1279), with the original author of the work being monk Ieronymus Agathagelus from Messina of Sicily. The latter narrates, through oracles, events of the following centuries, which the original author knows. As a result, it fascinates the popular masses, who are becoming more optimistic about their liberation. Thus, the supposed Latin translator of the prophetic work, Theocletus, remains under the shadow of Agathagelus. He stayed in Dresden (1741) and shortly afterwards settled, after an invitation of the inhabitants, in neighboring Leipzig, where he founded the first Orthodox chapel (then of the Holy Trinity, now of St. George). He died in 1759 in Leipzig. == References == == Sources == * * Encyclopedia \u00ab\u0394\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae\u00bb, vol. \u0399\u0393\u0384 \u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1:\u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae\u03c2, \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 Category:1698 births Category:1759 deaths Category:People from Edirne Category:Greek educators Category:Greek bishops Category:Greek scholars Category:Athonite Fathers Category:Scholars in Eastern Orthodoxy Category:18th-century Greek people ",
