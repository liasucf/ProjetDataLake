During the summer holidays, it runs summer camps for children and teenagers in the Rocky Mountain Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. It is owned and operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. == History == In 1980 a group of Adventist church leaders such as administrators and scholars met to discuss the future of controversial theologian Desmond Ford. This event, which is now known as the Glacier View controversy, resulted in Ford being removed from church employment because of his criticisms of the \"investigative judgment\" doctrine.L. R.
