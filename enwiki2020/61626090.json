    "text": "{| |} The Bristol Type 172 was a 1940s proposed British long range four- engined bomber project. Although work was carried out on designing experimental half-scale variants, none were built and the project was abandoned. == Design and development == In October 1946 the Bristol Aeroplane Company tendered a design to the British Air Ministry for a high-speed long- range bomber with four turbojet engines.Barnes 1988, pp.376-377 Designated Type 172, it was liked by Air Staff, who asked the company to build a smaller half-scale Rolls Royce Nene-powered single-seat aircraft, the Type 174, to the same geometric design with a 45 degree wing sweep. On 23 July 1947, the Air Ministry issued Specification E.8/47 (\"Prototype Flying Models to Operational Requirement 250\") to Bristol, who designated it the Type 174.Meekcoms/Morgan 1994, pp. 368-369 After investigation it was found that the high subsonic flow around the wing-body junction would not work, the wing leading edge would need to be swept. In November 1947 work on the Type 174 was stopped and the E.8/47 specification was revised. The revised specification was issued on 8 June 1948 and required a smaller 3/10th scale aircraft powered by a Rolls-Royce Avon engine. Work on the revised design, the Type 176, was started in February 1948. At a subsequent mock-up conference the company felt it could not support further work on the Type 176 as the company needed to concentrate on the Bristol Britannia turboprop airliner. ==Variants== ;Bristol Type 172 :Proposal for a four-engined long-range bomber, not built. ;Bristol Type 174 :Half-scale variant of the Type 172 for design evaluation powered by a Nene engine, not built. ;Bristol Type 176 :Revised 3/10th Scale development aircraft for the Type 172 powered by a Avon engine, mock-up only, not built. ==Specification (Type 172 as proposed)== == References == ;Notes == Bibliography == * C.H.
