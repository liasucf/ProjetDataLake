It was the second conflict of the medieval Bulgarian\u2013Serbian Wars. ==Prelude and the War== After the death of Prince Vlastimir of Serbia in 850, his state was divided between his sons. Vlastimir and Presian, Boris' father, had fought each other in the Bulgar-Serb War (839\u201342), which resulted in a Serbian victory. Boris sought to avenge that defeat, an in 853 or 854, the Bulgar army led by Vladimir-Rasate, the son of Boris I, invaded Serbia, with the aim to replace the Byzantine overlordship on the Serbs. The Serbian army was led by Mutimir and his two brothers, who defeated the Bulgars, capturing Vladimir and 12 boyars. Boris I and Mutimir agreed on peace (and perhaps an alliance), and Mutimir sent his sons Pribislav and Stefan to the border to escort the prisoners, where they exchanged items as a sign of peace. Boris himself gave them \"rich gifts\", while he was given \"two slaves, two falcons, two dogs, and 80 furs\".F.

Mutimir, however, kept a nephew, Petar, in his court for political reasons.\u0110eki\u0107, \u0110. 2009, \"Why did prince Mutimir keep Petar Gojnikovic?\", Teme, vol. 33, no. 2, pp. 683\u2013688.

Petar would later defeat Pribislav, Mutimir's son, and take the Serbian throne. ==See also== * Bulgarian\u2013Serbian medieval wars * Bulgar-Serb War (839\u201342) * Medieval Bulgarian Army * Medieval Serbian Army ==References== ==Sources== ;Primary sources * ;Secondary sources * * * * Category:9th century in Serbia Category:9th century in Bulgaria Category:Wars involving medieval Serbian states Category:Wars involving the First Bulgarian Empire Category:850s conflicts Category:Byzantine\u2013Bulgarian Wars Category:Bulgarian\u2013Serbian Wars Category:Principality of Serbia (early medieval) ",
