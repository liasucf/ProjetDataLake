He was promoted captain and later major in command of a battalion (the 3rd) in 1915, and lieutenant-colonel in 1918. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (D.S.O.) and a bar both in 1918, as well as the French Croix de Guerre. He continued his interest in the Territorial movement after the war, as honorary colonel of the 1st Battalion The London Regiment from 1923, the 5th Battalion West Yorkshire Regiment from 1937, and as president of the West Yorkshire Territorial Forces Association from 1928. He was also appointed in 1937 honorary air commodore of the 609 (West Riding) Bomber Squadron of the Auxiliary Air Force. ==Other interests== After the war, Lascelles remained interested in local Yorkshire issues and events, often contributing to the Leeds Board of Management. He was president of the Yorkshire Rural Community Council. He was Lord Lieutenant of the West Riding of Yorkshire from 1927 until his death. He was president of the Royal Agricultural Society of England in 1929 when that year's Royal Show was held at Harrogate.

In the three-cornered fight that also included a Labour candidate, he came second to Buckmaster by 878 votes. He did not seek election again, and his defeat led to a later distaste for politics. He declared in later life \"every war in which Britain had been involved had been due to the inefficiency of politicians, and they began what soldiers had to end\". On succeeding to his father's earldom, he became a member of the House of Lords. ==Death and legacy== Lord Harewood died of a heart attack on 24 May 1947 at the age of 64 at his home, Harewood House. He is buried in the Lascelles family vault at All Saints' Church, Harewood. Lady Harewood, the Princess Royal, survived him by almost eighteen years and died in 1965.

In the 2019 film Downton Abbey, Viscount Lascelles is played by Andrew Havill. ==Titles, styles, honours and arms== Coat of arms of Henry, 6th Earl of HarewoodImage of the quartered arms of the 6th Earl of Harewood, Find a Grave.
