    "text": "Malaa (not to be confused with pioneering dubstep DJ/producer Mala) is a French electronic music DJ and producer, who is signed to Tchami's label Confession. He broke onto the electronic music scene through his single \"Notorious\", which was the second release on Confession. His identity is unknown as he appears in public as a balaclava-wearing man. ==Identity== Malaa's identity is unknown. It is strongly suggested that Malaa consists of a duo with DJs DJ Snake and Tchami, as they are credited often on each other's track productions and are connected to the project via remixes. It is also speculated that Mercer is involved in Malaa, since the same management team is shared between the three artists. Through a Reddit post made on the topic, Redditors discovered a tweet on Twitter where a user wrote \"cant believe im opening for dj snake + tchami's side project next thursday\", while linking to a SoundCloud mix by Malaa. The tweet was then favourited by DJ Snake's Twitter account, which hints his participation on the topic. French DJ Sebastien Benett is also speculated to be Malaa, due to the quick removal of a Facebook comment from Mercer's profile which stated that Malaa was a nickname of Benett, and that the last posts by Benett on SoundCloud coincide with the first appearances of Malaa. ==Career== === 2015\u2013present === In September 2017, Malaa and French future house artist Tchami announced their \"No Redemption\" tour which was held in North America. To promote the tour event, they released a hip-hop influenced house track titled \"Summer 99\" on 29 September 2017. Malaa is known for his \"Who Is Malaa?\" continuous mixes which he releases through SoundCloud, which feature ghetto house and future house tracks. === Pardon My French === Pardon My French's Logo Malaa is currently part of the Pardon My French team, a collective of four French DJs composed of DJ Snake, Mercer, Tchami and himself. Throughout the year 2016 and early 2017, the collective went on a Pardon My French Tour in North America. ==Discography== === Compilation albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Illegal Mixtape | * Released: 17 April 2017 * Label: Confession * Formats: Digital download |- ! scope=\"row\"| Illegal Mixtape II | * Released: 8 November 2018 * Label: Confession * Formats: Digital download |} === Extended plays === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Details ! scope=\"col\"| Track Listing |- ! scope=\"row\" | Illicit | * Released: 5 July 2016 * Label: Confession * Format: Digital download | |- ! scope=\"row\" | No Redemption (with Tchami) | * Released: 4 April 2018 * Label: Confession * Format: Digital download | |} === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Album ! scope=\"col\"| Label |- | rowspan=\"2\" | 2015 ! scope=\"row\" | \"H+M\" | rowspan=\"4\" | Self-released |- ! scope=\"row\" |\"Pregnant\" | Fool's Gold Records |- | rowspan=\"5\" | 2016 ! scope=\"row\" | \"Fade\" | rowspan=\"8\" | Confession |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Arsenic\" (with Maximono) |- ! scope=\"row\" |\"Diamonds\" | Ilicit EP |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Notorious\" | rowspan=\"2\" |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Prophecy\" (with Tchami) |- | rowspan=\"7\" | 2017 ! scope=\"row\" |\"Bylina\" | rowspan=\"2\" | Illegal Mixtape |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Contagious\" |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Belleville\" | rowspan=\"3\" |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Paris 96\" | Self-released |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Hostyl\" (with Dombresky) | rowspan=\"4\" | Confession |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Summer 99\" (with Tchami] | rowspan=\"3\" | No Redemption EP |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"The Sermon\" (with Tchami) |- | rowspan=\"5\" | 2018 ! scope=\"row\" | \"Kurupt\" (with Tchami) |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Music Sounds Better With You\" (with Noizu) (by Stardust) | | Self-released |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Bling Bling\" | rowspan=\"3\" | Illegal Mixtape II | rowspan=\"4\" | Confession |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Cash Money\" |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"We Get Crunk\" |- | rowspan=\"3\" | 2019 ! scope=\"row\" | \"Addiction\" | rowspan=\"6\" |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Revolt\" (featuring Jacknife) | Premiere Classe Records |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Criminals\" (with Rezz) | Rezz Music / Confession |- | rowspan=\"4\"| 2020 ! scope=\"row\" | \"OCB\" | rowspan=\"3\"| Confession |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Don't Talk\" |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Hell\" (with Koos) |} ===Remixes=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+List of remixes, showing year released and original artists !
