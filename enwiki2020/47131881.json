    "text": "Ihor Yastrebov (born 7 November 1989), better known as Jimmy X Rose, is a Hungarian-Ukrainian musician and designer. He is the lead songwriter and guitarist of Oceans Red and former songwriter and guitarist of Make Me Famous. == Music career == ===2010-12: Make Me Famous=== The first major project Jimmy involved himself in was metalcore act Make Me Famous which he helped form in 2010 with members Denis Stoff on vocals and guitar, Serj Kravchenko on lead vocals, Sergei Hohlov on bass and Dusty Boles on drums. The band gained recognition on the video sharing website YouTube. After releasing the first music video for the song \"Make it Precious\", they submitted it to Ukrainian national Tuborg's VideoFun Music Contest in 2011. 167 bands from all over Ukraine with their music videos were involved in this contest project, but only Make Me Famous won the victory among them all by taking the first place. The band released their debut album in March 2012 via Sumerian Records and successfully charted in the US top 200, peaking at 151., No. 5 on the Heatseekers Chart. In late 2012 Make Me Famous was officially disbanded. The remaining four members went on to form a new band called Oceans Red. ===2012-present: Oceans Red=== The band wrote and self-produced their debut EP \"Hold Your Breath\" in early 2013. After the EP was released, lead vocalist quits the band due to health issues, two other members Dusty and Nick decided to split their ways with the band too. After almost a year since the debut EP was released the band with an updated line-up drops their single along with the video for \"Misguided\". The music video for this single were shot in 3 different countries at 4 different forests, since the band members were spread across the globe at that time. Jimmy had to combine and smooth the video between different forests at post-production stage, which he also did for the band for this music video. A few months later the band releases their second new single along with the video for \"Black Spot\". To keep things up, the band releases their acoustic version of the already existing song \"Riot\" on the New Year. On 8 October new single \"Home\" was exclusively released on KERRANG! website following Jimmy's quote, saying: \"I had goose bumps writing Home and everyone in the band passed this music through their hearts. That\u2019s why it came up so epic, it\u2019s pure emotions. Being different people from different countries we\u2019re an example of how music connects people better than any other thing in the world.\". On 6 November, the band premieres their debut album \"Anevidence\" on UTG website along with a short Q&A; with guitarist and songwriter Jimmy X Rose. ===2015-present: Solo career=== On 1 July Jimmy released his first solo acoustic single named \"Homesick\".
