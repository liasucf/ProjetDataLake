    "text": "Ancient map from Herodotus showing the area of Libya in north Africa, circa 450 BC Libya (Ancient Greek: \u039b\u03b9\u03b2\u03cd\u03b7) is the daughter of Epaphus, King of Egypt, in both Greek and Roman mythology. She personified the land of Ancient Libya in North Africa, from which the name of modern-day Libya originated. ==Greek mythology== In Greek mythology, Libya, like Ethiopia or Scythia was one of the mythic outlands that encircled the familiar Greek world of the Hellenes and their \"foreign\" neighbors. Personified as an individual, Libya was the daughter of Epaphus\u2014King of Egypt, and the son of Zeus and Io\u2014and Memphis. Libya was ravished by the god Poseidon to whom she bore twin sons, Belus and Agenor. Some sources name a third son, named Lelex. According to late accounts, Lybee (Libya) consorted instead with Zeus and became the mother of Belus.Pseudo-Clement, Recognitions 10.21\u201323 In Hyginus' Fabulae, Libye was called the daughter of Palamedes (corrected as Epaphus), who mothered Libys by Hermes.Hyginus, Fabulae, 160. ==Roman mythology== In Roman mythology, Libya was the daughter of Epaphus, King of Egypt, and his wife Cassiopeia. She married Neptune, a foreigner of much power whose real name is unknown. Libya and Neptune had a son called Busiris, who became a brutal tyrant of Upper Egypt.Virginia Brown's translation of Giovanni Boccaccio\u2019s Famous Women, pp. 24\u201325; Harvard University Press 2001; The territory that she ruled, Ancient Libya, and the country of modern-day Libya are named after her.Id., p. 25 ==Argive genealogy in Greek mythology== ==Notes== ==References== *Isidore, Etymologiae xiv.4.1, 5.1 *Augustine, De civitate dei xviii.12 *Lactantius Placidus, Commentarii in Sattii Thebaida iv.737 Category:Locations in Greek mythology Category:Libya in Greek mythology Category:Africa in Roman mythology ",
