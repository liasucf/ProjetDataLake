    "text": "Fat Larry's Band was an American R&B; and funk band from Philadelphia, which enjoyed some commercial success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, particularly in the United Kingdom. ==Career== Formed by drummer and vocalist \"Fat\" Larry James (August 2, 1949 \u2013 December 5, 1987) in 1976, the band included trumpeter/flautist Art Capehart, guitarists Ted Cohen and Tony Middleton, vocalists Freddie Campbell (1952 \u2013 January 19, 2013) and Darryl Grant, saxophonist Doug Jones, bassist Larry La Bes, trombonist/alto saxophonist Jimmy Lee, and keyboardist Erskine Williams. The band's biggest hits were \"Act Like You Know\" (which appears on the Grand Theft Auto: Vice City soundtrack) and \"Zoom\", which reached number 2 on the UK Singles Chart in October 1982. Fat Larry's Band had three other hits in the UK: \"Center City\", \"Boogie Town\", and \"Lookin' for Love\". On December 5, 1987, James died from a heart attack at the age of 38. As a result, the band folded. The opening drum break from \"Down on the Avenue\", from the band's first album, Feel It (WMOT Records, 1976), has been sampled by many musicians, including N.W.A, Ice-T, Jungle Brothers, Depeche Mode, and Run-D.M.C. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Feel It (1976) * Off the Wall (1978) * Spacin' Out (1978) * Lookin' for Love (1979) * Stand Up (1980) * Breakin' Out (1982) \u2013 No. 58 UK * Tune Me Up (1983) * Straight from the Heart (1983) * Nice (1986) * The Best of Fat Larry's Band (1994) * Fat Larry's Band \u2013 Greatest Hits (1995) * I Like Eating Chocolate \u2013 Greatest Hits (1999) * Memories (2019) ===Singles=== *1976: \"Center City\" - No. 31 UK *1976: \"Fascination\" - No. 39 U.S. Dance *1977: \"Peaceful Journey\" - No. 94 U.S. R&B; *1978: \"We Just Can't Get It Together\" *1979: \"Boogie Town\" - No. 43 R&B;, No. 46 UK *1979: \"Here Comes the Sun\" - No. 44 U.S. R&B;, No. 39 U.S. Dance *1979: \"Lookin' for Love\" - No. 47 U.S. R&B; *1979: \"Lookin' for Love Tonight\" - No. 46 UK *1980: \"Can't Keep My Hands to Myself\" *1980: \"How Good Is Love\" - No. 78 U.S. R&B; *1982: \"Act Like You Know\" - No. 67 U.S. R&B;/Funk, No. 24 U.S. Dance *1982: \"Be My Lady\" *1982: \"Traffic Stopper\" *1982: \"Zoom\" - No. 2 UK, No. 10 AUS No. 89 U.S. R&B; *1983: \"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\" - No. 83 UK *1983: \"Straight from the Heart\" - No. 88 UK *1983: \"Don't Let It Go to Your Head\" - No. 93 UK *1986: \"Nice\" *1986: \"Sunrise Sunset\" *1986: \"Teach Me (There Is Something About Love)\" ==See also== *List of disco artists (F-K) *Post-disco *Ultimate Breaks and Beats ==References== Category:Musical groups from Philadelphia Category:Musical groups established in 1976 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1987 Category:American funk musical groups Category:Stax Records artists ",
