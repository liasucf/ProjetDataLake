    "text": "Badme (, ) is a town in Gash-Barka region of Eritrea. Control of the town was at the centre of the Eritrean\u2013Ethiopian border conflict, which lasted from the end of the Eritrean\u2013Ethiopian War in 1998 to the signing of a joint statement at the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia summit in 2018, 20 years after the conflict started. == Disputed territory == The boundaries of Ethiopia and Eritrea follow a frontier defined by the Treaty of Addis Ababa between Ethiopia and Italy, which ruled Eritrea as a colony at the time. However, the frontier near Badme was poorly defined in the treaty, and since Eritrea became a separate nation in 1993, each nation has disputed where the boundary actually runs. The town of Badme was ceded by the TPLF (the predecessor of the EPRDF, Ethiopia's currently ruling party) to the EPLF (the predecessor of the PFDJ, Eritrea's ruling organization) in November 1977. In 2000, Eritrea and Ethiopia signed the Algiers Agreement, which forwarded the border dispute to a Hague boundary commission. In the agreement, both parties agreed in advance to comply with the ruling of the border commission. In 2002, the commission ruled on where the boundary ran, placing Badme inside Eritrean territory. Despite initially agreeing to abide by the terms of the Algiers Agreement, Ethiopia refused to withdraw to the border established by the Eritrea\u2013Ethiopia Boundary Commission and rejected its ruling. As a result, thousands of internally displaced people have remained in refugee camps and the threat of renewed war continues. Other disputed areas along the Eritrean\u2013Ethiopian border include Tsorona-Zalambessa and Bure. ==Ethiopian withdrawal== In June 2018, following a meeting of the executive council of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), the ruling party in Ethiopia, the government of Ethiopia announced plans to withdraw from Badme and cede it to Eritrea. ==Voting== In 2005, Badme residents voted in Ethiopian elections for the first time since Eritrean independence in 1991.Ethiopian general elections, January 2005 - Sudan Tribune == Demographics == The Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia in 2005 reported that this town has an estimated total population of 1,563, of whom 834 are men and 729 are women.CSA 2005 National Statistics, Table B.4 The Ethiopian government considered Badme as one of four towns in Tahtay Adiyabo woreda. ==Bibliography== * * == Notes == == External links == *Border a geographer's nightmare *Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission Category:Gash-Barka Region Category:Populated places in Eritrea ",
