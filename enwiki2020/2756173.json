He was killed in 802 at the Battle of Kempsford by Ealdorman Weohstan and the levies of West Saxon Wiltshire.Williams, Smyth & Kirby, A Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain (1991), pp. 24 \u00c6thelmund's predecessors had been kings, but he was a subject of the King of Mercia. However, in one source, the 14th century Chronicon Vilodunense or Chronicle of Wilton Abbey, he is referred to as \"King of the March\". Hence he may have also assumed the title of like his predecessors.Francis Pelgrave, History of the Anglo-Saxons (1876), pp. 101 ==Family== \u00c6thelmund was the son of Ingeld,.

They had at least one son named \u00c6thelric. ==Charter Evidence== \u00c6thelmund is attested in several Mercian and Hwiccian charters in the late 9th century, all thought to reference the same person..

In 796 Ecgfrith, King of Mercia and Offa's son, granted land to \u00c6thelmund, now styled princeps .

In the following battle, both the leaders were killed but victory rested with the men of Wiltshire. In 1670 a number of spearheads and iron bits were dug up in a field known as \"the Battlefield\" near Kempsford, which has led to speculation that this was the site of battle. After his death, Ealdorman \u00c6thelmund was interned to Deerhurst Abbey near Tewkesbury for burial. ==See also== *Hwicce ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:Anglo-Saxon ealdormen Category:Anglo-Saxon warriors Category:8th- century English people Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ",
