    "text": "Hyliidae is a family of passerine birds which would include the green hylia (Hylia prasina) and the tit hylia (Pholidornis rushiae). Physiological similarities and recent mitochondrial DNA evidence strongly support the creation of this family. Some taxonomic authorities place the entire family in the Macrosphenidae. Hylias are small, insectivorous songbirds found in tropical Africa. They frequent the understory of wet tropical forests. == Genera == * Pholidornis \u2013 tit hylia (formerly in Remizidae, then tentatively in Cettiidae) * Hylia \u2013 green hylia (formerly tentatively placed in Cettiidae) ==References== Category:Bird families ",
