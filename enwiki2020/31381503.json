As host of Sports Show, Macdonald is described as a \"gleeful, equal-opportunity offender who is back in his element making snarky asides at the absurd excesses of the sports biz,\" according to TVGuide's Matt Roush. ==History== The show premiered on April 12, 2011, on the American cable network Comedy Central, and on April 13, 2011, on the Canadian cable television channel The Comedy Network.

Ms. Allred alleged McDowell simulated gay sex using a baseball bat and his hand in front of her client and his two 9-year-old girls. She demanded that McDowell apologize for traumatizing the young girls; however, Ms. Allred then grabbed a baseball bat and, with the aid of the hand of the young girls' father, proceeded to reenact the simulated gay sex in front of the young girls, over and over again.

During the premiere episode, Los Angeles Clippers players DeAndre Jordan and Blake Griffin were featured in a sketch called \"Blake Like Me.\" The sketch also featured Macdonald, who hired a makeup artist to disguise him as Blake Griffin so he could go undercover in the NBA. Macdonald's undercover-Griffin then joins his teammate Jordan on the practice court, and Macdonald's voice is dubbed-in for the undercover-Griffin. Jordan can't understand why his teammate is playing so poorly (i.e. airballs, awkward moments and even a sky-hook), until the real Blake Griffin enters the practice court and the undercover- Griffin runs away when confronted.USA Today \"Blake Griffin and Norm Macdonald: Separated at birth\" by Reid Cherner w/video of 'Blake Like Me' sketch.by Tom Conroy, premiere review ==Running gags== Macdonald sometimes uses running gags during the show. *Medical Correspondent Burgess Meredith: After discussing a sports topic involving a leg injury, Macdonald says, \"We now go to Medical Correspondent Burgess Meredith,\" then turns to an image of Burgess Meredith and asks him for a diagnosis.

Meredith's diagnosis: \"Women weaken legs.\" *Sad Bill Cosby: After discussing a sports topic, Macdonald says, \"We now go to Legal Correspondent Sad Bill Cosby,\" then turns to an image of Bill Cosby and asks him yes-or-no questions.
