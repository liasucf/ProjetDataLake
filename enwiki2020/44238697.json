    "text": "The Mitsubishi R2000 farm tractor is a rice field tractor that was in limited production in the early- to mid-1970s. The power rating for Japanese tractors is taken from the PTO shaft output, and the R2000 is rated at 20 hp. The engine flywheel rating is 23 hp. These tractors are overbuilt for the originally-intended purpose and many are still running today on small farms. The \"R\" series included three models: R1500, R2000, R2500. Red and silver is the original color of all three models with some being shipped the U.S. in the late 1970s painted blue and white. The R series tractors share common parts with many Mitsubishi models, and engine parts can be found through several sources online. The 2-cylinder diesel engine designed for this tractor is robust and creates a large amount of torque for its size, and many aspects of this design were used in later models. All three models have a high and low range transmission as well as a high and low PTO range selector. High range should not be used when powering modern 540 rpm implements as this may result it implement gear damage. In all R series tractors, PTO low range should be used at 2000 engine rpm to create the desired 540 implement speed for modern implements.
