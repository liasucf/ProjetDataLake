It refers to the transmission of spiritual knowledge between two individuals without the need for physical interaction between them. The term Uwais\u012byaan refers to those Sufis who have gained the Sufi spiritual chain from another Sufi without physically meeting them in this world. It can refer to a school of Sufism, and its singular form, Uwaisi, refers to a single individual, who are Sunni Muslims. ==Background== In the science of spirituality of Islam (Tasawwuf) the Uwaisi Transmission occurs when the spirits of righteous believers (saliheen, awliya) meet in the world called `alam al-arwaah (the world of spirits) which is beyond `alam al-ajsam (the material plane). Whoever takes knowledge through spirituality from a master in `alam al-arwaah is called \"Uwaisi\". This means of transmission is considered as powerful and effective as the physical relation of master and disciple. The term \"Uwaisi\" is derived from the name of Uwais al-Qarni, who never met the Islamic prophet Muhammad physically, See Amazon page ASIN: B0000CQRGQ.
