The 1-1/2 story house is a simple gabled structure with an asymmetrically-placed porch framed in timbers. The residence is clad in large singles. A large window on the front elevation is divided in the middle by a heavy mullion, with transoms over both units and twelve lights divided by small muntins. Other windows are six-over-six double-hung sashes Rustic shutters with pine-tree cutouts frame the windows, echoing the USFS pine tree symbol. The house is consistent with the Forest Service's standard construction style, incorporating features of bungalow and rustic construction. The garage was also built in 1936.
