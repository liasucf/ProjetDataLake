    "text": "Looking north-east on Coppergate Coppergate is a street in the city centre of York, in England. ==History== The site of the street lay outside the walls of Roman Eboracum, but was used for glass-making.but it was re-occupied in the 9th-century, during the Jorvik period. Archaeological investigations have found remains of 11th-century houses which would have been on the street. It was first recorded some time between 1120 and 1135, at which time it was known as a centre for coopers, from which its name derives. Over time, the market in Pavement spread onto the street. The south-western end of the street was widened in 1900, leading to the replacement of most Mediaeval buildings. From 1976, major Viking remains were found immediately south of the street, following the demolition of a cinema and confectionery factory. The site was then into the Coppergate Shopping Centre, opened in 1984. ==Layout and architecture== View from the south-western end of the street The street runs north-east from the junction of Castlegate, Nessgate, King Street and Clifford Street, to end at the junction of Pavement, Piccadilly, Parliament Street and High Ousegate. The back of the church of All Saints, Pavement, lies on the north side of the street, followed by a row of shops with their main entrances on High Ousegate. Numbers 3-7 was built in two stages in the 1900s, and late-20th century was occupied by Habitat. On the south side, Galtres Chambers and the 16th-century Three Tuns pub are both listed buildings, as are two structures with 15th-century origins: 26 Coppergate (the former Market Tavern), and 28, 30 and 32 Coppergate. ==References== Category:Streets in York ",
