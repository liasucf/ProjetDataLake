Navin's work focuses on single cell sequencing, oncogenomics, bioinformatics and the genome evolution in cancer. Navin worked under the tutelage of Michael Wigler at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he helped to develop the first single-cell DNA sequencing method: single nucleus sequencing. This discovery effectively established the field of single-cell genomics.
