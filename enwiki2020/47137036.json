    "text": "Amute Stadium (Estadio de Amute in Spanish) was the football stadium of Real Uni\u00f3n, a main team in Spanish football before the Second World War. The club was formed in 1915 following the merger of Ir\u00fan Sporting Club and Racing Club de Ir\u00fan. Ir\u00fan Sporting Club played at the Campo de Amute, which was situated just to the north of town in the village of Hondarribia, not far from the current site of Irun\u2019s airport. The ground opened on 2 January 1910 and hosted the 1915 Copa del Rey Final when Athletic Bilbao defeated RCD Espa\u00f1ol with 5-0. Upon forming, Real Uni\u00f3n used Ir\u00fan Sporting\u2019s Campo de Amute. In 1926, at the peak of their powers, Real Uni\u00f3n moved to the other side of Irun and their current Stadium Gal. It was inaugurated 19 September with a match against FC Barcelona. There was a strong Anglo influence at the club in the early years, with England great Steve Bloomer, managing the club for several years in the 1920s. The original structure could have easily passed itself off as an English, that was until the local municipality installed a cycle track in 1950. The Anglo influence may be the reason the title \u201cstadium\u201d is used rather than estadio or campo. That or a Basque refusal to use castellano. http://www.estadiosdeespana.com/posts/irun-stadium-gal/ http://eldomingoalascinco.com/el-r-union-de-irun-4-veces-campeon-de-copa- entre-los-anos-10-y-los-anos-20/ http://lafutbolteca.com/tag/stadium-gal/ ==References== Category:Irun Category:Real Uni\u00f3n Category:Defunct football venues in Spain Category:Sports venues completed in 1910 ",
