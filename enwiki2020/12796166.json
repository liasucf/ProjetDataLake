    "text": "Dominique Regef Dominique Regef (b. Paris, 1947) is a French improvisor, composer, and musician specializing in stringed instruments: the cello, the rebec, the vi\u00e8le \u00e0 archet, and the Rajasthan dilruba. Dominique Regef is recognized as an exceptional soloist on the hurdy-gurdy; he is known for surprising and moving audiences with his sound on the instrument. His concerts, be it a solo recital or a small group performance, shock listeners from all over the world with their originality and their strength. He has performed in several well-known music festivals, including the International Baroque Music Festival, the Jazz \u00e0 Luz festival and the Grenoble Jazz Festival. He is cited as one of the best examples of modern hurdy-gurdy playing. His interest in contemporary and improvised music was confirmed after long experimentation and contribution in the world of classical, medieval and traditional music. His first instruments were classical cello and piano. His more traditional work followed a cyclical and organic logic. It made use of the element of brute strength and sonority as an essential part of his musical conversations. In reviews of his solo album, Eight Magazine claimed that Regef has \"transformed an instrument of antiquity into something utterly contemporary,\" while the Wire remarked that he \"creates an intense soundscape of whirling strings, buzzing drones, and strident polyphonic effects akin to an electronic keyboard.\"Harris, Craig.
