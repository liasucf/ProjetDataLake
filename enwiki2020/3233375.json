    "text": "Arioald was the Lombard king of Italy from 626 to 636. Duke of Turin, he married the princess Gundeberga, daughter of King Agilulf and his queen Theodelinda. He was, unlike his father-in-law, an Arian who did not accept Catholicism. Arioald deposed Agilulf's heir Adaloald with the support of the nobility, for Adaloald had gone mad. Upon becoming king, he had his wife locked up in a monastery, accusing her of plotting against him with Tasson, duke of Friuli. He also reestablished Arianism in the Lombard kingdom. His only recorded wars were against the Avars, whom he succeeded in repelling during an attempted invasion of northeast Italy. == Notes == Category:7th- century kings of Italy Category:7th-century Arian Christians Category:Lombard kings Category:Lombard warriors Category:7th-century Lombard people Category:7th-century monarchs in Europe Category:Arian Christians ",
