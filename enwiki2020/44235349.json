    "text": "The Special Forces Supply Unit's role is to oversee and maintain all logistical, technical and other equipment for Special Forces. This includes all equipment and material unique to Special Forces. ==History== In order to be able to maintain and store the parachute equipment according to regulations, the Special Forces Supply Depot also has a modern parachute packing, store and maintenance facility. In 1991, during the rationalisation and re-organisation within the Defence Force, the Special Forces Supply Depot was renamed 1 Maintenance Unit. When Special Forces Headquarters moved temporarily from Speskop to Defence Headquarters in 1992, 1 Maintenance Unit was relocated to Wallmanstal, north of Pretoria. == References == Category:Special forces of South Africa Category:Military units and formations of South Africa in the Border War ",
