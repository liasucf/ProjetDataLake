    "text": "The 2020 United States Senate special election in Georgia will be held on November 3, 2020, following Senator Johnny Isakson's resignation effective December 31, 2019. Governor Brian Kemp appointed Kelly Loeffler to serve as Isakson's replacement, effective January 6, 2020, until the special election. On November 3, 2020, per Georgia law, a special general election will take place on the same day as the regularly scheduled U.S. Senate election for the seat held by David Perdue. A primary election will not occur; instead, all candidates, regardless of party, will be placed on the same ballot. Party labels will be printed on the ballot and if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, the top two finishers will advance to a runoff election, to be held on January 5, 2021. ==Background== On August 28, 2019, Isakson announced that he would resign from the Senate effective December 31, 2019, due to his deteriorating health. This triggered a special election to fill the remainder of his term. On September 17, 2019, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp launched a website inviting Georgia citizens to submit their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to be considered for appointment. President Donald Trump advocated the appointment of Rep. Doug Collins. Kemp appointed Republican Kelly Loeffler to fill the seat until the 2020 special election; she took office on January 6, 2020. ==Democratic candidates== Despite the large number of candidates in the special election, the Democratic Party has largely consolidated around the candidacy of Raphael Warnock, and has pressured other Democratic candidates such as Matt Lieberman to drop out to avoid vote splitting. === Declared === *Deborah Jackson, former mayor of Lithonia and attorney *Jamesia James, businesswoman and U.S. Air Force veteran *Tamara Johnson-Shealey, businesswoman and frequent candidate *Matt Lieberman, businessman, activist, and son of Joe Lieberman, former U.S. Senator from Connecticut *Joy Felicia Slade, physician *Ed Tarver, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia and former state senator * Raphael Warnock, reverend and pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church *Richard Dien Winfield, professor and candidate for Georgia's 10th congressional district in 2018 === Declined === *Stacey Abrams, nominee for Governor of Georgia in 2018 and former minority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives (endorsed Raphael Warnock) *Sherry Boston, DeKalb County District Attorney *Jason Carter, nominee for Governor of Georgia in 2014, former state senator, and grandson of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter (endorsed Raphael Warnock) *Stacey Evans, candidate for Governor of Georgia in 2018 and former state representative (running for state house) *Jen Jordan, state senator *Lucy McBath, incumbent U.S. Representative for Georgia's 6th congressional district (running for re-election) *Michelle Nunn, CEO of CARE USA and nominee for U.S. Senate in 2014 *Jon Ossoff, documentary filmmaker and nominee for Georgia's 6th congressional district in 2017 (running for Class 2 seat) *Mike Thurmond, DeKalb County chief executive, former Labor Commissioner of Georgia, and nominee for U.S. Senate in 2010 *Teresa Tomlinson, former mayor of Columbus (running for Class 2 seat) *Nikema Williams, state senator and Chair of the Georgia Democratic Party *Sally Yates, former United States Deputy Attorney General === Endorsements === ==Republican candidates== === Declared === *Doug Collins, incumbent U.S. Representative for Georgia's 9th congressional district *Derrick Grayson, minister, network engineer, software developer, perennial candidate, U.S. Navy veteran *Annette Davis Jackson, businesswoman, 2016 Republican candidate for Georgia State Senate *Kelly Loeffler, incumbent U.S. Senator *Kandiss Taylor, student services coordinator for Appling County Board of Education === Withdrawn === *Ervan Katari Miller, perennial candidate *Wayne Johnson, former chief operating officer of the Office of Federal Student Aid (remained on ballot) === Declined === *Nick Ayers, former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence *Ashley Bell, regional administrator for the Small Business Administration *Paul Broun, former U.S. Representative for Georgia's 10th congressional district *Buddy Carter, incumbent U.S. Representative for Georgia's 1st congressional district *Geoff Duncan, incumbent Lieutenant Governor of Georgia *Stuart Frohlinger, finance expert *Tom Graves, incumbent U.S. Representative for Georgia's 14th congressional district *Karen Handel, former U.S. Representative and former Georgia Secretary of State (running for Georgia's 6th congressional district) *Scott Hilton, former state representative (endorsed Loeffler) *Jan Jones, Speaker pro tempore of the Georgia House of Representatives *Brian Kemp, incumbent Governor of Georgia (endorsed Loeffler) *Butch Miller, state senator *B.
