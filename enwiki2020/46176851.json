It has training features, including chess basics, tactics training, chess coordinates, a chess video library, an opening explorer, studies, and an analysis board. It also has a section where chess coaches can advertise their services to users. In addition to enabling blindfold chess, the website supports the following chess variants: * Antichess (Losing chess) * Atomic chess * Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) * Crazyhouse * Horde (a variant of Dunsany's chess) * King of the Hill * Racing Kings * Three-check chess Lichess was the first chess-site to have features to help visually impaired people play chess on a website. It also has a chess puzzle-based CAPTCHA system. Users can also play games against the Stockfish chess engine at a number of difficulty levels. They may also analyze specific positions from standard chess or any of the supported chess variants. The website implements a version of the Stockfish engine that runs on the user's local machine within the user's web browser for limited or infinite analysis, which will calculate best lines of play or major opponent threats. An opening book based on games played on the site or a database of two million games played by FIDE titled players is available. In the Antichess analysis board, users can utilize Mark Watkins's antichess solution database. For registered players, Lichess employs a Glicko-2 rating system, and grants the ability to compete in tournaments, post in the forums, and request a server-side full game analysis for any finalized game. The ratings for standard chess are categorized into Ultrabullet, Bullet, Blitz, Rapid, or Classical, depending on the game's total time or estimated total time (if using Fischer time control which increments time after each move). A Lichess mobile app is available for iOS and Android. == Media == File:Lichess puzzle.png|A chess puzzle ==See also== *List of Internet chess servers *Outline of chess (subject-wide table of contents) *Glossary of chess == References == == External links == * * Category:Internet chess servers Category:Chess websites Category:Free software programmed in Scala ",
