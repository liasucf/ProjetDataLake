    "text": "Wh-agreement refers to morphological changes triggered by wh-movement, usually in verbs or complementisers. It occurs in a number of Bantu languages, Austronesian languages including Chamorro and Palauan, Algonquin languages such as Ojibwe, as well as Hausa, French, Scottish Gaelic, and Irish.http://artsites.uottawa.ca/eajmathieu/doc/Lochbihler_Mathieu.pdf For example, in Chamorro, the infix -um- (labelled \"WH[nom]\") is attached to the verb to mark agreement with the nominative question phrase following subject extraction: :{| |- | (1) | Ha-fa'gasi | si | Juan | i | kareta. |- | | 3sSA- wash | PND | Juan | the | car |} ::'Juan washed the car.' :{| |- | (2) | Hayi | fuma'gasi | i | kareta? |- | | who? | WH[nom].wash | the | car |} ::'Who washed the car?' Additionally, some languages have distinct agreement morphology depending on the case of element being moved. In the case of object extraction in Chamorro, the verb fa'gasi instead becomes fina\u2019gas\u00e9se (marked with \"WH[obj]\"): :{| |- | (3) | Hafai | fina\u2019gas\u00e9se-n\u00f1a | si Juan | p\u00e4ra | hagu? |- | | what | WH[obj].wash.Prog-agr | Juan | for | you |} ::\u2018What is Juan washing for you?\u2019 In French and Scottish Gaelic, special complementisers are used in cases of wh-movement: :{| |- | (4) | Tu | as | dit | que | le | livre | \u00e9tait | tomb\u00e9 |- | | you | have | said | that | the | book | had | fallen |} ::\u2018You said that the book had fallen.\u2019 :{| |- | (5) | Qu'est-ce | que | tu | as | dit | qui | \u00e9tait | tomb\u00e9 |- | | what-is-this | that | you | have | said | that. | was | fallen |} ::\u2018Who did you say had fallen?\u2019 ==Notes== ==References== Category:Morphology ",
