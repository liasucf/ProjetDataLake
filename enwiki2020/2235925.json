    "text": "\"And Then There Was Silence\" is a song by the German power metal band Blind Guardian. It was released in November 2001 as the lead single from their album, A Night at the Opera. Written by singer Hansi K\u00fcrsch and composed by K\u00fcrsch and guitarist Andr\u00e9 Olbrich, the song is based on The Iliad by Homer and on the Aeneid by Virgil, and narrates the final days of Troy, as foreseen by Cassandra, daughter of the king of the destroyed city who foresaw the event. The song is so intricate and long with so many tracks that it alone required as much production time as the rest of the A Night at the Opera album. At over 14 minutes, it is the longest track recorded by Blind Guardian. It was re-recorded into a new version in 2012 as a part of the compilation album Memories of a Time to Come. ==Track listing== # \"And Then There Was Silence\" \u2013 14:06 # \"Harvest of Sorrow\" \u2013 3:40 # \"Born in a Mourning Hall\" (multimedia track) \u2013 5:17 ==Lineup== * Hansi K\u00fcrsch \u2013 vocals and backing vocals * Andr\u00e9 Olbrich \u2013 lead, rhythm and acoustic guitar * Marcus Siepen \u2013 rhythm guitar * Thomen Stauch \u2013 drums and percussion ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2001) !Peak position |- |- |Spain (AFYVE) |align=\"center\"|1 |- |} ==Personnel== * Anry Nemo \u2013 cover art ==References== Category:2001 singles Category:Blind Guardian songs Category:2001 songs Category:Virgin Records singles Category:Songs based on poems Category:Songs written by Hansi K\u00fcrsch Category:Songs written by Andr\u00e9 Olbrich Category:Works based on the Iliad Category:Works based on the Aeneid ",
