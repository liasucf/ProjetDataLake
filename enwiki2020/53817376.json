    "text": "Engaged Citizenship is the active participation of a citizen under the law of a sovereign nation discussing and educating themselves in politics. Engaged citizens are considered independent, and assertive, and concern themselves with others' problems. i.e.: Organizers of protests look for engaged citizens to be involved and rally behind their cause; often stalling or creating political changes. == Changes & Media Coverage == Developments in social media and media literacy have changed how scholars begin to look at, and define engaged citizenship. Engaged citizenship in politics can lead to an apparent consumption of the engaged person rather than offering people with an informed, active opinion. Social media sites let people spread information, and create events to provide opportunities for engaged citizenship. Social media and the internet provide a public access point to government affairs, and police, away from townhall meetings, creating communities with similar concerns to recognize the pitfalls of governments and government policies. ==See also== *Participatory democracy *Liquid democracy ==References== Category:Mass media Category:Citizenship ",
