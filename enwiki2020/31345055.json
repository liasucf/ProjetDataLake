    "text": "Manny Pacquiao vs. Shane Mosley, billed as The Undaunted, was a welterweight fight for the WBO Welterweight championship. The bout was held on May 7, 2011, at MGM Grand, in Las Vegas. Pacquiao defeated Mosley by unanimous decision and retained his WBO Welterweight Championship. The fight was Manny Pacquiao's first PPV fight on Showtime boxing due to HBO choosing not to air the fight. ==National Anthem singers== Charice sings Lupang Hinirang for the Philippines National Anthem. *Philippines (Lupang Hinirang) \u2013 Charice *United States (The Star-Spangled Banner) \u2013 Tyrese Gibson *United States (America the Beautiful) \u2013 Jamie Foxx ===Entrance performers=== In addition, rapper LL Cool J performed as Mosley entered the arena, while vocalist Jimi Jamison of the rock band Survivor sang \"Eye of the Tiger\" as Pacquiao approached the ring. ==Referee and judges== The referee for the fight was Kenny Bayless, and the judges were Nevadans Duane Ford, Dave Moretti, and Glen Trowbridge. Bayless had previously been referee for fights involving Pacquiao and Mosley before, including the Floyd Mayweather vs. Shane Mosley and Manny Pacquiao vs. Miguel Cotto fights. ==Promotion== Top Rank promoted the fight, which took place at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. Pacquiao's team turned down a fight with Mosley twice a year before, but they accepted the fight after Mosley had a lopsided loss to Floyd Mayweather Jr. and a draw to Sergio Mora.https://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/02/sports/la-sp-dwyre- pacquiao2-2010feb02 A Showtime series, Fight Camp 360\u00b0, documented Pacquiao's and Mosley's training preparations in the lead up to their bout. Shane Mosley stated that if he lost badly to Pacquiao he may retire. Pacquiao was heavily favored to win, as many fans and critics believed the 39-year-old Mosley was past his prime. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum stated that should Pacquiao win, it could set up a third fight with Juan Manuel Marquez in November. ==Fight summary== In the third round, Pacquiao knocked Mosley down, using a one-two capped with a left straight. Mosley was left dazed by the knockdown but managed to stand up. From that point on, Mosley backpedaled and seemed very reluctant to engage Pacquiao, throwing few combinations, trying to potshot with occasional counter right hands, and looking for one big punch. Mosley floored Pacquiao in the tenth round with a push, but referee Kenny Bayless ruled it a knockdown. None of the judges seemed to have agreed with this view, judging from the scores. Replays showed that Pacquiao was throwing a punch off balance, slipped and went down with a little help from Mosley's right hand and with his right foot trapped under Mosley's left foot. Bayless apologized for this mistake to Roach, Pacquiao's coach, after the fight. Pacquiao gained one- sided verdicts from all three judges \u2013 119\u2013108, 120\u2013108 and 120\u2013107. Pacquiao reported that he had a cramp in his legs. Freddie Roach said that Pacquiao had problems with cramping before, but usually only in training sessions and not in the middle of bouts. ==Main card== *Welterweight Championship Manny Pacquiao vs. Shane Mosley :Pacquiao defeated Mosley via unanimous decision (119\u2013108, 120\u2013108, 120\u2013107). *Super Bantamweight Championship bout: Jorge Arce vs. Wilfredo V\u00e1zquez, Jr. :Arce defeated V\u00e1zquez via technical knockout at 0:55 in the twelfth round. *Super Middleweight bout: Alfonso L\u00f3pez III vs. Kelly Pavlik :Pavlik defeated L\u00f3pez via majority decision (95\u201395, 98\u201392, 99\u201391). *Light Welterweight bout: Mike Alvarado vs. Raymond Narh :Alvarado defeated Narh via technical knockout at 3:00 in the third round. ===Preliminary card=== *Light Welterweight bout: Jos\u00e9 Benavidez vs. James Hope :Benavidez defeated Hope via technical knockout at 1:43 in the fifth round. *Lightweight bout: Aris Ambr\u00edz vs. Pier-Olivier C\u00f4t\u00e9 :Cote defeated Ambr\u00edz via technical knockout at 0:46 in the fourth round. *Super Flyweight bout: Javier Gallo vs. Rodel Mayol :Mayol defeated Gallo via majority decision (95\u201395, 98\u201392, 98\u201392). *Light Welterweight bout: Karl Dargan vs. Randy Arrellin :Dargan defeated Arrellin via unanimous decision (60\u201354, 60\u201354, 59\u201355). ==Reported fight earnings== The fight generated 1.3 million PPV buys.
