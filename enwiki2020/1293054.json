    "text": "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving is the tenth prime-time animated television special based upon the popular comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. It was originally aired on the CBS network on November 20, 1973, and won an Emmy Award the following year. Until 2019, the special continued to be aired annually in November in prime time on the ABC network in the United States. Beginning in 2020, Apple TV+ will become the exclusive home of all Peanuts specials. It was the third holiday special after A Charlie Brown Christmas in 1965 and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown in 1966. ==Plot== The special opens with Lucy again enticing Charlie Brown to kick a football she is holding - which again ends up with Charlie Brown missing the ball and landing flat on his back once again. Later, Charlie Brown and Sally are preparing to go to their grandmother's for Thanksgiving dinner when Charlie Brown gets a phone call from Peppermint Patty, who invites herself over to Charlie Brown's house for the holiday dinner. Two quick subsequent phone calls from Peppermint Patty add Marcie and Franklin to the guest list, but since Charlie Brown cannot get a word in edgewise with Patty, he quickly finds himself in a quandary with no easy solution, at least not until Linus shows up. Linus suggests to Charlie Brown that he could have two Thanksgiving dinners. It's revealed that the first one can be for himself, Peppermint Patty, and her friends, while the second one can be at his grandmother's house for his family. Charlie Brown says he cannot make a Thanksgiving dinner. He says that all he knows how to make is \"cold cereal and maybe toast\". Regardless, Linus recruits Snoopy and Woodstock to help. The guests arrive and make their way to the backyard for the Thanksgiving feast. Linus leads the group in prayer that details the First Thanksgiving in 1621, and then Snoopy serves up the feast which includes buttered toast, pretzel sticks, popcorn, jelly beans, and an ice cream sundae. Patty's initial shock at the unconventional Thanksgiving feast quickly turns to outrage, and when she loudly berates Charlie Brown he timidly leaves the table. Patty's tirade continues until Marcie quietly reminds her that she had invited herself along with Marcie and Franklin. Coming to her senses, Patty asks Marcie to apologize to Charlie Brown on her behalf; Marcie reluctantly agrees, but Patty soon follows and apologizes to him herself. Following this, Charlie Brown is reminded that he and Sally are due at their grandmother's house for dinner, so he calls her and explains his situation. When he mentions his friends are there, and that they have not yet eaten, his grandmother invites them all to Thanksgiving dinner, which is welcomed with cheers from everyone. After the kids leave singing, Snoopy and Woodstock go to the doghouse and cook up their own traditional Thanksgiving meal. They then pull the wishbone which Woodstock wins. Over the end credits, the two friends each devour a large piece of pumpkin pie then sit back with contented smiles as Woodstock pats his full stomach. ==Broadcast history== The special first aired on CBS on November 20, 1973, and continued to air every year on that network (skipping 1982, 1983 and 1988) until November 23, 1989. The Disney Channel and Nickelodeon revived the special for reairing in the 1990s and then, in 2001, it moved, along with the rest of the Peanuts specials, to ABC. From that year until 2019, ABC aired the special on Thanksgiving night, although it also had aired on various days in the week leading up to Thanksgiving. Beginning in 2020, the special will exclusively air on Apple TV+. As the special runs slightly over a half-hour with commercials, ABC typically fills the remaining portion of the full hour with other Peanuts programming. Since 2008, the remaining time has been filled by a slightly abridged edit of \"The Mayflower Voyagers,\" the premiere episode of the 1988 miniseries This Is America, Charlie Brown. The special has regularly won its time slot each year since at least 2017.TV Ratings Wednesday: \u2018A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving\u2019 wins the night, \u2018Survivor\u2019 dips.
