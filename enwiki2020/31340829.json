Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.p.196 He was shot dead by the Provisional IRA after they had broken into his home.CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths Bingham was one of a number of prominent UVF members to be assassinated during the 1980s, the others being Lenny Murphy, William Marchant, Robert Seymour and Jackie Irvine. ==Ulster Volunteer Force== Ballysillan, north Belfast, where John Bingham lived and commanded the Ballysillan UVF John Bingham was born in Northern Ireland around 1953 and was brought up in a Protestant family. Described as a shopkeeper, he was married with two children.\"These Cash Payments Don't Take Account of the Pain of the Victims\". The Belfast Telegraph. Eric Waugh. 27 January 2009. Retrieved 30-03-11 He lived in Ballysillan Crescent, in the unionist estate of Ballysillan in North Belfast, and also owned a holiday caravan home in Millisle, County Down.Belfast Telegraph. 27 January 2009 He was a member of the \"Old Boyne Island Heroes\" Lodge of the Orange Order.Taylor, p.151 On an unknown date, he joined the Ulster loyalist paramilitary organisation, the UVF, and eventually became the commander of its \"D Company\", 1st Battalion, Ballysillan,Taylor, p.196 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel.CAIN: Physical Memorials of the Troubles in North Belfast He was the mastermind behind a productive gun-running operation from Canada, which over the years had involved the smuggling of illegal weapons into Northern Ireland to supply UVF arsenals; however, three months after Bingham's death, the entire operation collapsed following a raid on a house in Toronto by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in December 1986.Taylor, p.189 Bingham was one of the loyalist paramilitaries named in the evidence given by supergrass Joe Bennett, who accused him of being a UVF commander.McKittrick. Lost Lives. p.1048 He testified that he had seen Bingham armed with an M60 machine gun and claimed that Bingham had been sent to Toronto to raise funds for the UVF.Steve Bruce, The Red Hand, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 140 These meetings opened contact with Canadian businessman John Taylor, who became involved in smuggling guns from North America to the UVF.Bruce, The Red Hand, p. 169 As a result of Bennett's testimony, Bingham was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment after being convicted of committing serious crimes.McKittrick,Lost Lives, p.1048 He publicly denounced the supergrass system before live television cameras outside Belfast's Crumlin Road Courthouse when he was released in December 1984 after his conviction had been overturned, having spent two and a half years in prison.H. McDonald & J. Cusack (1997). UVF. Poolbeg. p.232. Google Books. Retrieved 31-03-11 On one occasion, Bingham allegedly placed a loaded pistol inside journalist Martin Dillon's mouth because of the latter's offensive words he had used against him. In an attempt to make amends for his threat, Bingham invited Dillon to visit him at his home in North Belfast. Dillon accepted the invitation and after several whiskeys and brandishing a pistol, Bingham offered to show him his racing pigeons as he was an avid pigeon fancier. He then told Dillon that he shouldn't believe what people said about him claiming that he couldn't harm a pigeon.Dillon, Martin (1989). The Shankill Butchers: the real story of cold-blooded mass murder. New York: Routledge. pp.282\u2013283 As they said farewell at the front door, Bingham reportedly murmured in a cold voice to Dillon: \"You ever write about me again and I'll blow yer fuckin' brains out, because you're not a pigeon\". ==Killing== In July 1986, a 25-year-old Catholic civilian, Colm McCallan, was shot close to his Ligoniel home; two days later, he died of his wounds. The IRA sought to avenge McCallan's death by killing Bingham, the man they held responsible for the shooting. Bingham was also believed to have been behind the deaths of several other Catholic civilians.Dillon, p.262 At 1:30 am on 14 September 1986, Bingham had just returned to Ballysillan Crescent from his caravan home in Millisle. Three gunmen from the IRA's Ardoyne 3rd Battalion Belfast Brigade, armed with two automatic rifles and a .38 Special, smashed down his front door with a sledgehammer and shot Bingham twice in the legs. Despite his injuries, Bingham ran up the stairs in an attempt to escape his attackers and had just reached a secret door at the top when the gunmen shot him three more times, killing him.Taylor, pp.196\u201397David McKittrick. Lost Lives. p.1048 He was 33 years old. He was given a UVF paramilitary funeral, which was attended by politicians from the two main unionist parties, the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Members of his \"Old Boyne Island Heroes\" Orange Order (OO) Lodge formed the guard of honour around his coffin, which was covered with the UVF flag and his gloves and beret. Prominent DUP activist George Seawright helped carry the coffin whilst wearing his OO sash, and called for revenge.Brian Kennaway The Orange Order-A Tradition Betrayed p.49 In retaliation, the UVF killed Larry Marley, a leading IRA member from Ardoyne who was also a close friend of Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams. The IRA in their turn gunned down William \"Frenchie\" Marchant the following spring on the Shankill Road.Taylor, p.197 The deaths of three leading UVF members caused suspicion amongst the UVF leadership that someone within their ranks was setting up high-ranking UVF men by passing on pertinent information to the IRA; therefore, they decided to conduct an enquiry. Although it was revealed that the three men, Shankill Butcher Lenny Murphy, Bingham, and Marchant had all quarrelled with powerful UDA fund-raiser and racketeer James Pratt Craig prior to their deaths, the UVF did not believe the evidence was sufficient to warrant an attack against Craig, who ran a large protection racket in Belfast.Dillon, Martin (1989). The Shankill Butchers: the real story of cold-blooded mass murder. New York: Routledge. pp.262\u2013263. Google Books. Retrieved 30-03-11 Craig was later shot to death in an East Belfast pub by the UDA (using their \"Ulster Freedom Fighters\" covername) for \"treason\", claiming he had been involved in the assassination of South Belfast UDA brigadier John McMichael, who was blown up by a booby-trap car bomb planted by the IRA outside his Lisburn home in December 1987. In Ballysillan Road, there is a memorial plaque dedicated to the memory of Bingham. His name is also on the banner of the \"Old Boyne Island Heroes\" Lodge. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1953 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Deaths by firearm in Northern Ireland Category:Loyalists imprisoned during the Northern Ireland conflict Category:Overturned convictions in the United Kingdom Category:People from Belfast Category:People killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army Category:Ulster Volunteer Force members ",
