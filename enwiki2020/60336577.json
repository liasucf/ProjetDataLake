    "text": "Distributive ecological conflict is a term introduced by Joan Mart\u00ednez-Alier and Martin O'Connor to characterise the conflictive dynamics generated in the exercise of power, when using natural resources, where different social actors enter into dispute over territory. The study of distributive ecological conflicts is a field of study for Ecological Economics and Political Ecology. In the modern world, due to the great stress in which the planet is submitted, many distributive ecological conflicts have been generated. The oil industry, coal, mining in general and agro-industry are focal points of distributive ecological conflicts, where actors such as investors, the State and affected communities intervene. Claims for the rights of affected communities are cases that are studied within Environmental Justice. In many of these cases, a technical instrument known as Environmental Liabilities is used to claim payment of damages. ==References== Category:Social conflict ",
