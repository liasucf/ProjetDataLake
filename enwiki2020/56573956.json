    "text": "In the Japanese writing system are typographic ligatures in the kana writing system, both hiragana and katakana. These are now obsolete, and almost none are represented in standard character encodings. The only widely available ones are the hiragana and the katakana . They are also known as and . ==History== These characters were widely used until a spelling reform of 1900 decreed that each sound (mora) would be represented by one (kana) character. They were not represented in computer character encodings until JIS X 0213:2000 (JIS2000) added yori and koto. In the 21st century, in modern Internet slang, some ligatures are made using existing characters, such as for in for ( is not a word, but it would be pronounced takui, and mean \"entrust- adjective\") and for in for ( would be pronounced mor\u016bru). ==See also== * Ryakuji Category:Kana ",
