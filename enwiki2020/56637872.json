    "text": "The Industrial Ecology Programme, or IndEcol, in the Department of Energy and Process Engineering at NTNU (Trondheim, Norway) is an interdisciplinary research programme specialising in sustainable development, circular economy research and environmental issues. IndEcol's research areas are framed around the recently adopted United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and include: * Ecosystems and Bioresources * Energy, Transport and Buildings * Circular Economy and Resources * Sustainable Production and Consumption Research groups focus on Life Cycle Assessment, Material Flow Analysis, and global environmental input-output analysis. The Digital Laboratory of the Programme bundles the Research software engineering efforts of the group. The programme was initiated in 1994 and covers several research disciplines and a comprehensive educational curriculum. IndEcol established the world's first PhD programme in Industrial Ecology in 2003 and set up the international Master of Science in Industrial Ecology the following year. The IndEcol group consists of Professors, Researchers, Post-Doctoral Fellows and PhD candidates, and currently numbers around 45 people. Current academics include Helge Bratteb\u00f8, Anders Str\u00f8mman, Daniel M\u00fcller, Richard Wood, Francesco Cherubini, Francesca Verones, Johan Berg Pettersen, and Edgar Hertwich. Cherubini was a contributing author for Working Group 3's Chapter 7 (Energy systems) and Chapter 11 (Agriculture, Forestry, and other Land Use) 5th Assessment Report for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) == Specialist programmes == The Industrial Ecology Programme at NTNU offers both PhD and Master\u2019s study options == Partnerships == IndEcol is the home of the NTNU SUSTAINABILITY office, which represents one of four Strategic Research Areas of NTNU . IndEcol is also the home for the European Editorial Office of Journal of Industrial Ecology, a journal produced by Yale University for the International Society for Industrial Ecology. == Selected recent publications == *List of publications by IndEcol generated by Scopus *Vita., G., Lundstr\u00f6m, J.R., Hertwich, E.G., Quist, J., Ivanova, D., Stadler, K., Wood, R.
