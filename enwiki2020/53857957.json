    "text": "Pabell\u00f3n de Inca is a volcano in Chile. Located in the Tarapaca Region, it rises above the basement. Volcanic activity in the region during the Eocene had formed the Icanche Formation, about 45 million years ago. After a pause of about 33 million years, volcanic activity resumed during the Miocene and continues to the present day. The volcanism included the Uijna and Carcote ignimbrites and the stratovolcanoes on the border between Chile and Bolivia. Together with Irruputuncu and del Inca and Poru\u00f1ita it is considered to be a young volcano. Lava flows and craters are no longer recognizable but the volcano maintains a conical shape. Other volcanoes in the area are El Rojo Sur and Olca-Paruma. Pabell\u00f3n de Inca is not active. Pabell\u00f3n de Inca, Irruputuncu and Poru\u00f1ita have erupted andesite and dacite. They contain hornblende and pyroxene. The tree Polylepis tarapacana is found on Pabell\u00f3n de Inca. == References == === Sources === * Category:Volcanoes of Chile ",
