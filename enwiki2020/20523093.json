    "text": "Jim Fiala is a chef who owns two restaurants in the St. Louis, Missouri area. His restaurants are The Crossing in Clayton, Missouri and Acero in Maplewood, Missouri. Jim Fiala is a St. Louis area native, who grew up in the suburbs of Crestwood, Sunset Hills and unincorporated West County. He is a 1983 graduate of Parkway West High School. (He is a 2014 inductee into the Parkway Alumni Hall of Fame.) He has a degree in Finance from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. Fiala\u2019s parents introduced him to fine dining at an early age. For his 13th birthday he was taken to dinner at St. Louis\u2019 most elite restaurant, Tony\u2019s. When the family traveled to New York or Los Angeles, they always dined at the places that were highly rated in the Michelin guide. [1] ==Early Training== Upon graduation from S.M.U., Fiala worked briefly in the Dallas area for an agency that promoted professional wrestling in Texas. In early 1988, he joined Clipper Cruise Lines as a deckhand. When an opening occurred in the kitchen, he took the job and began his career in cooking. He says \u201cI got stuck in the galley for seven weeks and fell in love with cooking.\u201d [2] In late 1989, Fiala returned to St. Louis and worked for just over a year preparing food for Catering St. Louis. Fiala enrolled in the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco at the beginning of 1991. During his time in the Bay Area he worked for chef Jeremiah Trotter at Stars restaurant and for chef Patricia Unterman at Hayes Street Grill. == Chicago and New York == Upon graduation from California Culinary Academy in November, 1992, Jim Fiala returned to the Midwest and accepted a job offer from Chicago\u2019s Spiaggia restaurant in the Gold Coast area. He started at $6.50/hour and performed every aspect of kitchen work. [3] In 1994, Paul Bartolotta of Spiaggia called Daniel Boulud, owner of Restaurant Daniel in New York City, and asked if he needed staff. Boulud said yes and asked about Fiala \u201cCan he handle the pressure?\u201d Bartolotta assured him that Fiala was ready for the move to the Big Apple. Fiala\u2019s kitchen jobs in New York included \u201centrimitier\u201d (vegetable cook) and \u201cpoussioniere\u201d (fish cook). He also, for a time, made all the restaurant\u2019s pasta. During his tenure there, Restaurant Daniel earned its New York Times four star rating. [4] Following his time in New York City, Jim Fiala was recruited to cook at the Horned Dorsett Primavera resort in Puerto Rico. == Return to St. Louis == In late 1997, Fiala came back to St. Louis. On April 15, 1998, with then business partner Cary McDowell, Fiala opened The Crossing (7823 Forsyth Boulevard) in Clayton. The name of the restaurant represented a \u201ccrossing\u201d of Italian and French influences. The restaurant received several positive reviews early on and has enjoyed strong popularity as a leader of the \u201cnew breed\u201d of fine dining establishments in metro St. Louis. [5] R.W. Apple Jr. wrote about The Crossing in the New York Times: \u201cTwo chefs from Daniel in New York have set St. Louis on its conservative ear with this stylish bilevel establishment. A piece of poached skate that all but melted into a pile of mashed potatoes, formed the centerpiece of a satisfying meal that began with roasted beets and goat cheese and ended with perfectly simple, simply perfect vanilla ice cream.\u201d [6] Patricia Corrigan of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch named The Crossing 1998\u2019s Best New Restaurant and called The Crossing\u2019s Beef Tenderloin the year\u2019s best Beef Entr\u00e9e. [7] Joe Bonwich, then writing for the Riverfront Times, said of The Crossing: \u201cThe result is a truly unique and innovative style for St. Louis and we should all be hopeful that Fiala\u2019s youthful wanderlust has worn off and that he\u2019s come back to stay.\u201d He added: \u201cThis place certainly aspires to a national reputation.\u201d [8] John Garganigo of the Ladue News wrote: \u201cIn a short period of three months it (The Crossing) has become the darling of local movers and shakers.\u201d [9] As The Crossing grew into its position as an upscale, more formal, fine dining destination, Fiala and his partner sought to establish a more casual version of The Crossing in the Central West End. Liluma opened in 2002 and had a successful run until its closing in December, 2012. == Acero == Jim Fiala\u2019s Italian restaurant is Acero in suburban Maplewood, Missouri (7266 Manchester Road). Acero\u2019s opening on March 2, 2007, was followed by an overwhelming number of positive reviews. In a city famous for Italian restaurants, Acero stands out. Acero is distinctive because it features the regional cuisine of Tuscany and Emilia Romagna in Northern Italy. Acero is the Italian word for maple. Acero was featured in 2008 in the annual Restaurant issue of Bon Appetit magazine. \u201cThe Best Italian Food in America\u201d were the words on the cover of the issue (September, 2008). [11] Inside the magazine was a feature that included recipes from twelve different restaurants in the U.S. Acero\u2019s contribution was its cauliflower ravioli with guanciale. Acero was the only St. Louis restaurant included. [12] Fiala\u2019s concept for Acero is \u201cartisan.\u201d He says \u201cI want Acero to be recognized as an \u2018artisan\u2019 restaurant, a place that embraces the Italian artisans, the guys who\u2026have elevated our palates and now our expectations.\u201d [13] ==Personal Philosophy== Jim Fiala is a \u201chands on\u201d owner who spends time at each of his restaurants daily. His top priority is quality control. His mission: \u201cWe work on improving everyday.\u201d He has told his employees that their goal should be to make \u201cevery meal a great meal.\u201d [14] Jim Fiala visited Italy in February, 2009. While dining at a restaurant in the state of Abruzzo, Jim met a man named Luigi Cataldi Madonna. Jim says that Luigi summarized Jim's own cooking philosophy in these few words: \"Find the complexity in the simple.\" Fiala also visited Italy in 2011. Jim Fiala is married and has three children. ==References== [1,3] St. Louis Business Journal, March 23\u201329, 2001, \u201cThree Years and Counting.\u201d [2] St. Louis Post- Dispatch, March 20, 1999, \u201cSet Sail for a Dining Adventure.\u201d [4] New York Times, November 11, 1994, \u201cRestaurants.\u201d (Review of Restaurant Daniel.)
