    "text": "David Lincoln Rabinowitz (born 1960) is an American astronomer, discoverer of minor planets and researcher at Yale University. == Career == David Rabinowitz has built CCD cameras and software for the detection of near-Earth and Kuiper belt objects, and his research has helped reduce the assumed number of near- Earth asteroids larger than 1 km by half, from 1,000\u20132,000 to 500\u20131,000 He has also assisted in the detection of distant solar system objects, supernovae, and quasars, thereby helping to understand the origin and evolution of the solar system and the dark energy driving the accelerated expansion of the universe. Collaborating with Michael Brown and Chad Trujillo of the Quasar Equatorial Survey Team, he has participated in the discovery of several plutoids such as 90377 Sedna (possibly the first known inner Oort cloud object), 90482 Orcus, Eris (more massive than Pluto), , and , although he would not get credit for Haumea. Together with Tom Gehrels of the University of Arizona and his Spacewatch team, Rabinowitz discovered or co-discovered other astronomical objects including 5145 Pholus \u2013 a Centaur, credited by the MPC to Spacewatch\u2013 and the unnumbered Apollo near-Earth object 1991 BA, which remains uncredited.. == Awards and honors == The minor planet 5040 Rabinowitz, a Phocaea asteroid discovered by Tom Gehrels at Palomar Observatory in 1972, was named in his honor and for his work at Spacewatch. == List of discovered minor planets == David Rabinowitz is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery and co-discovery of 34 minor planets during 1989\u20132010. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 26em; margin- right: 1em; height: 280px; |- | 90377 Sedna || 14 November 2003 || |- | 90482 Orcus || February 17, 2004 || |- | ' || July 26, 2003 || |- | ' || October 3, 2004 || |- | 136199 Eris || October 21, 2003 || |- | 136472 Makemake || March 31, 2005 || |- | ' || August 7, 2004 || |- | || May 10, 2007 || |- | 225088 Gonggong || July 17, 2007 || |- | 229762 G\u01c3k\u00fan\u01c1\u02bch\u00f2md\u00edm\u00e0 || July 17, 2007 || |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 26em; margin-right: 1em; height: 280px; |- | || August 25, 2008 || |- | || March 9, 2010 || |- | ' || March 7, 2010 || |- | || December 19, 2009 || |- | || December 16, 2009 || |- | || September 9, 2010 || |- | ' || December 17, 2009 || |- | ' || November 11, 2010 || |- | || March 9, 2010 || |- | || March 13, 2010 || |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 26em; margin-right: 1em; height: 280px; |- | || March 17, 2010 || |- | || March 18, 2010 || |- | || March 19, 2010 || |- | || March 19, 2010 || |- | || April 14, 2010 || |- | || May 12, 2010 || |- | || August 14, 2010 || |- | || November 3, 2010 || |- | || October 27, 1989 || |- | || August 14, 2010 || |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 26em; margin-right: 1em; |- | || September 24, 2008 || |- | || September 11, 2007 || |- | || September 26, 2008 || |- | || September 24, 2008 || |- ! colspan=3 style=\"font-weight: normal; text-align: left; padding: 4px 12px;\" |Co-discovery made with: M.

It was discovered by Rabinowitz in 1992 and was officially named Pholus. Another body that he discovered in 1993 was named Nessus with an orbit of 123.2 years. This one orbits between Saturn and Pluto.Life After Grief: An Astrological Guide to Dealing with Loss, by Darrelyn Gunzburg, 2004 == References == Category:1960 births Category:American astronomers Category:Jewish American scientists Category:Michael E.
