There are several pubs in the area including the Mare Pool, Renato Lounge, Old School House and the Fox and Dogs. Mere Green is also home to Flints which is a bar that was very popular in the 1970s and 1980s It underwent changes in ownership and name in recent years before resorting back to its original name in 2018. Mere Green Library and Community Centre offers classes in such subjects as yoga and art, free internet access and facilities for tennis and lawn green bowls as well as hosting reading groups for adults and children and occasional exhibitions. The area made the news in 1983 when Italian Renato Pagliari, then co-owner of the La Gondola restaurant in Mere Green, scored a No 1 hit single in the UK as one half of the singing duo 'Ren\u00e9e and Renato' with the song 'Save Your Love'. ==Redevelopment== Plans were outlined for a major redevelopment of the Mere Green shopping area, which would involve the demolition of many of the smaller shops.http://www.suttoncoldfieldobserver.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=185916&command;=displayContent&sourceNode;=201320&home;=yes&more;_nodeId1=185918&contentPK;=16776673 The scheme, led by Spring Urban, was approved in August 2007. The development was however delayed by the recession and again when Spring Urban's parent company, Castlemore Securities, went into administration in February 2009. Work finally began on the \u00a315 million \"Mulberry Walk\" scheme in September 2015. The first new store on the development that opened was Boots, which opened on 17 August 2016.
