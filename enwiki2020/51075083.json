    "text": "The coastal cliff at La Portada near Antofagasta. The Coastal Cliff of northern Chile () stretches over a length of more than 1000 km along the Atacama Desert. It makes up a large part of the western boundary to the Chilean Coast Range in the regions of Arica y Parinacota, Tarapac\u00e1, Antofagasta, and Atacama. According to Roland Paskoff the modern cliff origined from a scarp retreat of a fault scarp, thus at present the cliff does not follow any fault.Paskoff, R. (1979). Sobre la Evoluci\u00f3n Geomorfol\u00f3gica del gran acantilado costero del Norte Grande de Chile. Norte Grande (in Spanish). Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile, Instituto de Geograf\u00eda, 6, 7-22. In some locations a series of coastal benches can be found below the cliff. Despite alternating uplift and subsidence of the continent at a decadal timescale the cliff and the whole western edge of the South American plate has faced a long- term uplift during the last 2.5 million years. ==See also== *Atacama Fault *Coastal plains of Chile ==References== Category:Cliffs of Chile Category:Geology of Chile Category:Landforms of Antofagasta Region Category:Landforms of Atacama Region Category:Landforms of Tarapac\u00e1 Region Category:Geology of the Chilean Coast Range Category:Geology of Antofagasta Region Category:Geology of Atacama Region Category:Geology of Tarapac\u00e1 Region Category:Coasts of Chile ",
