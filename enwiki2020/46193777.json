From 1630 he was taught by private tutors and attended the 1637 Academic Gymnasium Danzig. Because of the Thirty Years' War in Pomerania, which also impacted the estates of the family, his mother sent him 1640 the Sor\u00f8 Academy. Together with his brother in 1642, he went on tour to the Dutch Republic or France to enter into military service. Already in Hamburg he met the commander Gustaf Horn, who persuaded him to get in Swedish service, and took him to Stockholm. Matthias Palbitzki became Hofjunker of Christina, Queen of Sweden. In 1643 he was an ensign of the bodyguard and the same year was promoted to lieutenant commander.
