    "text": "A piano piece or piece for piano (, ; , ) is a piece of music for piano. It is a generic name for any composition for the instrument, but when capitalised (Piano Piece, Piece for Piano) the name is used to indicate a (usually) single-movement composition for solo piano that has not been given a more specific name (such as Sonatina, Allegro de concert or Le Bananier), for example: * Johannes Brahms's Sechs Klavierst\u00fccke (Six Piano Pieces), Op. 118 * Arnold Schoenberg's Drei Klavierst\u00fccke (Three Piano Pieces) * Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierst\u00fccke As the German word ' may indicate other keyboard instruments besides the piano, not all Klavierst\u00fccke are composed for the piano; for example, the pieces included in the Klavierb\u00fcchlein f\u00fcr Wilhelm Friedemann Bach are rather to be regarded as keyboard pieces than piano pieces. In 1768 Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach published his Kurze und leichte Klavierst\u00fccke, Wq 113\\. In this case each of the 11 pieces included in the volume has a separate title (Allegro, Arioso, Fantasia, etc.). For Mozart's compositions, Klavierst\u00fcck may refer to posthumously published pieces without a definite title (e.g. Klavierst\u00fcck in F, K. 33b), or, as in the Neue Mozart- Ausgabe, to various single-movement compositions for solo piano or other keyboard instrument.Wolfgang Rehm. Klavierst\u00fccke, Band 1 und 2, Work Group 27: Piano Pieces of Series IX: Piano Music of the Neue Mozart-Ausgabe at the B\u00e4renreiter website Schubert's F\u00fcnf Klavierst\u00fccke were published in 1843, 15 years after the composer's death: the first two pieces of this set belong to the same apparently unfinished piano sonata (), the last three () may have been conceived as independent piano pieces, although there is considerable speculation as to how they may be grouped in multi-movement sonatas in combination with various piano pieces by Schubert. Another set of three piano pieces by Schubert is also known as his last three Impromptus. Since the middle of the twentieth century auxiliary instruments, tape, or live- electronics may be employed without changing the basic idea of a solo piano piece, for example Stockhausen's Klavierst\u00fcck XVI. There are also multi- movement works titled in the singular, as for example Michael Gielen's Klavierst\u00fcck in sieben S\u00e4tzen \"recycling der glocken\" (Piano Piece in Seven Movements \"Recycling of Bells\") for prepared piano, bells, and tape. ==References== ",
