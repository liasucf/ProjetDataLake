    "text": "Special sciences are those sciences other than fundamental physics, that are presumed to be reducible to fundamental physics, at least in principle. In this view, chemistry, biology, and neuroscience\u2014indeed, all sciences except fundamental physics\u2014are special sciences. The status of the special sciences, and their relation to physics, is unresolved in the philosophy of science. Jerry Fodor, for instance, has argued for strong autonomy, concluding that the special sciences are not even in principle reducible to physics.Fodor, J. (1974): Special Sciences (Or: The disunity of science as a working hypothesis)\", Synthese, 28, pp. 97-115. As such Fodor has often been credited for having helped turn the tide against reductionist physicalismKim Jaegwon (2005).
