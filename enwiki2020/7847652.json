They also won a bronze medal in the team event at the 2014 Winter Olympics. Davis and White teamed up in 1997 and they are currently the longest-lasting dance team in the United States. They are the first American ice dancers to win the World title, as well as the first Americans to win the Olympic title. At the 2006 NHK Trophy, they became the first ice dancing team to receive level fours on all their elements. ==Personal life== White was born in the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, Michigan, the son of Jacqui and Charlie White Sr. He attended Roeper School in Birmingham, Michigan from nursery school through high school where he played violin in the school string quartet and was involved with the student government.

He quit skating singles following the 2005\u201306 season in order to focus on ice dancing. He began ice dancing when he was seven at his coach's advice, who hoped it would smooth out White's skating. He was partnered with Meryl Davis in 1997, by Seth Chafetz.

We've grown together and know each other so well.\" In their first season together, Davis/White won the silver medal at the Junior Olympics in the Juvenile division.
