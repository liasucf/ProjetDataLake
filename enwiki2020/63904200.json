Across four years at Boston University, Juron would put up 40 points in 141 games, winning Hockey East three times. After graduating, Juron took a year away from hockey before signing her first professional contract with the Buffalo Beauts in the NWHL. She scored 2 points in her first two games with the Beauts, before the team lost in the Isobel Cup semi-finals. At the beginning of the 2018-19 season, she suffered a spine injury that forced her to miss most of the year. In May 2019, Juron joined the PWHPA after the collapse of the CWHL, along with most of the Beauts' roster. She would spend most of the season with the organisation before returning to the NWHL in January 2020 with the Boston Pride. She was the first PWHPA to re-join the NWHL. She put up 3 points in 8 regular season games with Boston, as well as scoring a goal in the semi-finals before the playoffs were indefinitely postponed due to the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Boston Pride players Category:Buffalo Beauts players Category:Boston University alumni Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Ice hockey people from New York (state) Category:American women's ice hockey forwards Category:Professional Women's Hockey Players Association players ",
