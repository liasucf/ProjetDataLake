    "text": "Glorious is the title of English comedian Eddie Izzard's 1997 performance at the Hammersmith Apollo. The performance was released on VHS and covers topics such as the siege of Troy, Noah's Ark, the Royal Family, and the birth of baby Jesus. In many ways, the flow of topics follow from the Bible, starting with the beginning of time according to the Old Testament and ending with Armageddon according to the Book of Revelation, though they are covered in Izzard's usual surreal style. ==External links== *Glorious - article at The Official Eddie Izzard Site * *The Cake or Death Site Category:Eddie Izzard albums Category:Spoken word albums by English artists Category:Stand-up comedy concert films Category:1997 live albums Category:1997 video albums Category:Live video albums Category:1990s comedy albums ",
