For many years he was head of PE at Haberdashers' Aske's boys school in north London, where he also headed the Special Service Unit for those who elected not to join the school cadet corps. He still canoed into his 90s, though he had to switch to the Canadian style. He was born in Sheffield and died in Cambridge. One of his children is sound engineer, Phil Dudderidge. In 1936 he and his partner Alex Brearley finished ninth in the folding K-2 10000 m event. ==References== *Sports-reference.com profile Category:1906 births Category:2004 deaths Category:English male canoeists Category:Canoeists at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:British male canoeists Category:Olympic canoeists of Great Britain Category:Sportspeople from Sheffield ",
