The SAM's vehicle chassis is based on the Kato Works Ltd/Mitsubishi Heavy Industries NK series heavy crane truck. It uses a state-of-the-art active electronically scanned array radar. FUTURE POSSIBILITIES: A PRESENTATION OF THE CHU-SAM MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM ==Overview== The Chu-SAM air defense system is based on 8\u00d78 cross country unarmored trucks, including a command center, radar unit, launcher, and transloader, with each unit equipped with six missiles that travel at Mach 2.5. The system can track up to 100 targets simultaneously and target 12 at the same time, engaging fighter jets, helicopters, and cruise missiles.100 Percent of Targets Destroyed: Japan Is Testing New Missile in US - Thediplomat.com, 13 November 2015 == Upgrade == In 2014, the JGSDF began evaluation of the upgraded Chu-SAM Kai, which uses improved sensor and networking features for better range and targeting of more complex cruise and anti-surface missile threats. During the summer of 2015, 10 Chu-SAM Kai missiles were test fired at White Sands Missile Range in the United States and successfully intercepted various targets, including the GQM-163 Coyote supersonic target drone; White Sands hosted the launches because the location's large size and controlled airspace allowed for testing conditions unavailable in Japan. Operational tests of the Chu-SAM Kai are expected to take place, again at White Sands, in 2016.Japanese Test Engages Supersonic Target on WSMR - Army.mil, 5 November 2015 The Chu-SAM Kai missile also planned to be converted to the long-range ship-to-air missile with a separatable booster rocket.Defense Programs and Budget of Japan FY2017, page.31 - mod.go.jp, March 2017 ==Deployment== * since 2003 * at Camp Matsudo in Matsudo, Chiba since 2007 * in Ono, Hy\u014dgo since 2008 ==Gallery== image:JGSDF Type03 SAM (launcher) 04.jpg|Fire position image:JGSDF Type03 SAM (rader) 01.jpg|Radar vehicle with active electronically scanned array image:JGSDF Type03 SAM (transporter) 01.jpg|Ammo transporter image:JGSDF Type03 SAM (rader) 03.jpg|Power vehicle ==See also== * List of missiles * Anti-ballistic missile Comparable SAMs: *MIM-104 Patriot * Akash (missile) * S-300 * KS-1 * HQ-9 * NASAMS * KM-SAM ==Notes== ==External links== *JGSDF official(Japanese) \u9678\u4e0a\u81ea\u885b\u968a *03\u5f0f\u4e2d\u8ddd\u96e2\u5730\u5bfe\u7a7a\u8a98\u5c0e\u5f3e *TRDI Department of Guided Weapon Systems Development *Chu-SAM in Janes Land Based Air Defence *Chu-SAM in global security.org Category:Mitsubishi Electric products, services and standards Category:Surface-to-air missiles of Japan Category:21st-century surface-to-air missiles ",
