He was executed in the notorious Mokot\u00f3w Prison as one of anti- communist so-called Cursed soldiers following the Soviet takeover of Poland at the end of World War II. ==Life== Szendzielarz was born in Stryj (Austrian Partition, now Lviv Oblast, Ukraine), then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and from 1919 to 1939 in Poland, into the family of a railway worker. After graduating from primary school in Lw\u00f3w, he attended a biological-mathematical gymnasium in Lw\u00f3w and then Stryj. After graduating, he volunteered for the Polish Army and completed Infantry Non-commissioned officer School in Ostr\u00f3w Mazowiecka (1932), then Cavalry NCO School in Grudzi\u0105dz. He was promoted to lieutenant and transferred to Wilno, where he assumed command of a squadron in the 4th Uhlan Regiment. ===World War II=== The young Zygmunt Szendzielarz, before World War II With his unit he took part in the 1939 September Campaign. His unit was attached to the Wilno Cavalry Brigade under General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders, part of the Prusy Army. After retreating from northern Poland, the forces of Gen. Anders fought their way towards the city of Lw\u00f3w and the Romanian Bridgehead. However, in the area of Lublin Szendzielarz's unit was surrounded and suffered heavy losses. Soon afterwards Szendzielarz was taken prisoner of war by the Soviets, but he managed to escape to Lw\u00f3w, where he lived for a short period under a false name. He tried to cross the Hungarian border to escape from Poland and reach the Polish Army being formed in France, but failed and finally moved with his family to Wilno. In Wilno, Szendzielarz started working on various posts under false names. In mid-1943 he joined the Home Army under the nom de guerre \u0141upaszka, after Jerzy D\u0105browski,\"\u0141upaszka \u2013 the cursed soldier\", Pangea Magazine, June 8, 2014 and in August he started organizing his own partisan group in the forests surrounding the city. Soon the unit was joined by local volunteers and the remnants of a unit of Antoni Burzy\u0144ski (\"Kmicic\"), destroyed by Soviet Partisans and the Wehrmacht. By September, the unit was 700 men strong and was officially named the V Vilnian Home Army Brigade (V Wile\u0144ska Brygada Armii Krajowej). Soldiers of the 5th Wilno Brigade. From left: ppor. Henryk Wieliczko (\"Lufa\"), por. Marian Pluci\u0144ski (\"M\u015bcis\u0142aw\"), mjr Zygmunt Szendzielarz (\"\u0141upaszka\"), NN, por. Zdzis\u0142aw Badocha (\"\u017belazny\") \u0141upaszko's unit fought against the German army and SS units in the area of southern Wilno Voivodeship, but was also frequently attacked by the Soviet Partisans paradropped in the area by the Red Army. In April 1944, Zygmunt Szendzielarz was arrested by the Lithuanian police and handed over to the Gestapo. \u0141upaszko was free in the same month under circumstances that remain unclear. In reprisal actions his brigade captured several dozen German officials and sent several threatening letters to Gestapo but it remains unknown if and how these contributed to his release. ===Operation Ostra Brama=== In August, the commander of all Home Army units in the Wilno area, Gen. Aleksander \"Wilk\" Krzy\u017canowski, ordered all six brigades under his command to prepare for Operation Tempest \u2014 a planned all-national rising against the German forces occupying Poland. In what became known as Operation Ostra Brama, Brigade V was to attack the Wilno suburb of Zwierzyniec in cooperation with advancing units of the 3rd Belorussian Front. However, \u0141upaszko, for fear of being arrested with his units by the NKVD and killed on the spot, disobeyed orders and moved his unit to central Poland. Wilno was liberated by Polish and Soviet forces, and the Polish commander was then arrested by the Soviets and the majority of his men were sent to Gulags and sites of detention in the Soviet Union. It is uncertain why Szendzielarz was not court-martialed for desertion. Most likely it was in fact General \"Wilk\" himself who ordered \u0141upaszko's unit away the Wilno area, due to \u0141upaszko long having been involved in fighting with Soviet partisans and Wilk not wanting to provoke the Red Army. Regardless, after crossing into the Podlasie and Bia\u0142ystok area in October, the brigade continued the struggle against withdrawing Germans in the ranks of the Bia\u0142ystok Home Army Area. Zygmunt Szendzielarz, the commander of the 5th Brigade, was responsible for the massacres in the area on several Lithuanian and Belarussian Villages. \u0141upaszko's unit remained in the forests and he decided to await the outcome of Russo-Polish talks held by the Polish Government in Exile. Meanwhile, the unit was reorganized and captured enough equipment to fully arm 600 men with machine guns and machine pistols. ===After World War II=== Photo after arrest 1948 After the governments of the United Kingdom and United States broke the pacts with Poland and accepted the communist \"Polish Committee of National Liberation\" as the provisional government of Poland, \u0141upaszka restarted hostilities\u2014this time against the new oppressor, in the ranks of Wolno\u015b\u0107 i Niezawis\u0142o\u015b\u0107 organization. However, after several successful actions against the NKVD units in the area of Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest, it became apparent that such actions would result in a total destruction of his unit. In September 1945, Zygmunt Szendzielarz moved with a large part of his unit to Gda\u0144sk-Oliwa, where he remained underground while preparing his unit for a new partisan offensive against the Soviet-backed communist authorities of Poland. On April 14, 1946, Szendzielarz finally mobilized his unit and headed for the Tuchola Forest, where he started operations against the forces of the Internal Security Corps, Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa and the communist authorities. \u0141upaszko was hoping that in the spring of 1946 the former Western Allies of Poland would start a new war against the Soviet Union and that the Polish underground units could prove useful in liberating Poland. However, when he realized that no such war was planned he decided to disband his unit. He saw further fight as a waste of blood of his men and decided to retire from open fight against the communists. After several years underground, he was arrested by the UB on June 28, 1948, in Osielec near Nowy Targ. After more than two years of brutal interrogation and torture in Warsaw's Mokot\u00f3w Prison he was sentenced to death on November 2, 1950 by the Soviet-controlled court martial in Warsaw. He was executed on February 8, 1951, together with several other Home Army soldiers. Szendzielarz was 40 years old. His body was buried in an undisclosed location. During a 2013 exhumation Szendzielarz's remains were recovered and identified as one of roughly 250 bodies buried in a mass grave at the so-called Meadow at Warsaw's Pow\u0105zki Military Cemetery. ==Posthumous history== After \u0141upaszko's death, communist authorities accused him of many crimes, from the crimes against humanity to robbery and common theft. In 1988 Szendzielarz was posthumously promoted to rotmistrz and awarded the Virtuti Militari, Poland's highest military decoration, by Kazimierz Sabbat, the President of Poland in exile. After the fall of communism, in 1993, Szendzielarz was rehabilitated and declared innocent of all charges. On 2007 Polish president Lech Kaczy\u0144ski posthumously awarded Szendzielarz with the order of Polonia Restituta. 11.11.2007 ==Dubinki Massacre== ===The Course=== On June 23, 1944, the 5th Home Army Brigade of Vilnius attacked the fortified village of Dubinki, which was inhabited by Lithuanian military settlers, capturing a bunker defended by Lithuanian policemen by surprise. The resistance against Polish Partisans was also broken. Having the list of people who collaborated with the occupier they began action to avenge the death of the residents of Glinciszki. Wo\u0142konowski i \u0141ukomski |page=256 In Dubinki between 21 and 27 inhabitants of the village died, including women and children.Wo\u0142konowski i \u0141ukomski |page=256 The actions were done to avenge the deaths of Poles in the village of Glinciszki.Wo\u0142konowski i \u0141ukomski |page=256 On the 20 June 1944 a Lithuanian unit of the Schutzmannschaft murdered 39 Poles in Glinciszki, including women and children. The action was also provoked by the actions of Lithuanian units on the civilian population in Paw\u0142\u00f3w, Adamowszczyzna, and Sie\u0144kowszczyzna. Dubinki became the target of the attack due to many of the policemen, and their families, responsible for the Glinciszki crime living there. According to Pawe\u0142 Rokicki, the actions in Dubinki are a warcrime, and the deaths of the civilians were intentional. ===Crimes against Humanity=== The unit of Zygmunt Szendzielarz massacred civilians in 1944. The victims of the 5th AK Brigade were primarily women and children (about 75% of all those killed). They were shot as a result of the deliberate action of \"Lupaszka.\" During the action in Dubinki, there was no fight, in particular with the Lithuanian police, which simply was not there. Findings from the Polish Institute of National Remembrance(IPN) leave no doubt that the retaliatory action of the 5th Home Army Brigade was a war crime on civilians.https://pamiec.pl/pa/tylko-u- nas/15322,ZBRODNIA-DUBINSKA-A-MAJOR-LUPASZKOquot.html On April 17th, 1945 the unit of Zygmunt Sendzielarz once again massacred civilians of Belarusian Origin in the Village of Narewka, Poland.https://www.tygodnikprzeglad.pl/58176-2/ ===Discrepancies=== There are varying accounts of the actions that took place. According to one Zygmunt Szendzielarz told his troops to avenge after hearing about what happened in Glinciszki, and by doing so disregarded the order of his superiors.. According to other accounts it was part of a larger order that was supposed to demonstrate the strength of the Polish units. However no evidence of such an order exists. ==Honours and awards== * Virtuti Militari, V class; for participation in the September 1939 campaign * Cross of Valour (January 1944) * Gold Cross, Virtuti Militari (June 25, 1988) in recognition of outstanding deeds during the war * Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, awarded by Polish President Lech Kaczynski, November 11, 2007 ==See also== *Pawe\u0142 Jasienica *List of Poles *Danuta Siedzik\u00f3wna == References == * Category:1910 births Category:1951 deaths Category:People from Stryi Category:People from the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria Category:Polish Austro-Hungarians Category:Polish Army officers Category:Armia Krajowa members Category:Cursed soldiers Category:Recipients of the Gold Cross of the Virtuti Militari Category:Recipients of the Cross of Valour (Poland) Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Polonia Restituta Category:Executed military personnel Category:Executed Polish people Category:Polish torture victims Category:People executed by the Polish People's Republic Category:Polish People's Republic rehabilitations Category:Polish people convicted of war crimes ",
