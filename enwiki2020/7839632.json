The team competes in the Papua New Guinea National Rugby League competition. They play at Johnson Siki Aipus Oval, Wabag located at 3 km outside the provincial capital Wabag. == History == The team qualified for the SP Inter-city Cup in its 1998 season. In their maiden season they came a miserable second-last. The following season under new coaching staff and new sponsors Toyota they improved significantly coming fourth. In their third season with the smart recruiting of power-house international prop Raymond Karl the Mioks won their first minor premiership and SP Intercity Millennium Cup title in 2000. Ever since then the team has had a wayward time with financial problems and provincial problems. Entering the new PNGNRL competition on 2005 they had a scrappy season finishing a lonely second last. In 2006, however they improved just missing out on the finals play off by points difference. ==Current squad== *Roger Laka ==Honours== * Cambridge Cup Club Champions: 1995, 1996, 1997 * SP Cup/Bemobile Cup - Digicel Cup/PNGNRL: ** Champions: 2000 ** Runner-Up: 2009 ** Finishes in top 5 every season ==See also== ==References== ==External links== *www.lbcbombers.com.pg *www.thenational.com.pg *www.postcourier.com.pg Category:Papua New Guinean rugby league teams Category:Rugby clubs established in 1992 Category:1992 establishments in Papua New Guinea ",
