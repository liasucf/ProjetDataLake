    "text": "In Unicode, two glyphs are said to be Z-variants (often spelled zVariants) if they share the same etymology but have slightly different appearances and different Unicode code points. For example, the Unicode characters U+8AAA \u8aaa and U+8AAC \u8aac are Z-variants. The notion of Z-variance is only applicable to the \u201cCJKV scripts\u201d\u2014Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese\u2014and is a subtopic of Han unification. ==Differences on the Z-axis== The Unicode philosophy of code point allocation for CJK languages is organized along three \u201caxes.\u201d The X-axis represents differences in semantics; for example, the Latin capital A (U+0041 A) and the Greek capital alpha (U+0391 \u0391) are represented by two distinct code points in Unicode, and might be termed \u201cX-variants\u201d (though this term is not common). The Y-axis represents significant differences in appearance though not in semantics; for example, the traditional Chinese character m\u0101o \u201ccat\u201d (U+8C93 \u8c93) and the simplified Chinese character (U+732B \u732b) are Y-variants. The Z-axis represents minor typographical differences. For example, the Chinese characters (U+838A \u838a) and (U+8358 \u8358) are Z-variants, as are (U+8AAA \u8aaa) and (U+8AAC \u8aac). The glossary at Unicode.org defines \u201cZ-variant\u201d as \u201cTwo CJK unified ideographs with identical semantics and unifiable shapes,\u201d where \u201cunifiable\u201d is taken in the sense of Han unification. Thus, were Han unification perfectly successful, Z-variants would not exist. They exist in Unicode because it was deemed useful to be able to \u201cround-trip\u201d documents between Unicode and other CJK encodings such as Big5 and CCCII. For example, the character \u838a has CCCII encoding 21552D, while its Z-variant \u8358 has CCCII encoding 2D552D. Therefore, these two variants were given distinct Unicode code points, so that converting a CCCII document to Unicode and back would be a lossless operation. ==Confusion== There is some confusion over the exact definition of \u201cZ-variant.\u201d For example, in an Internet draft (of RFC 3743) dated 2002, one finds b\u00f9 \u201cno\u201d (U+4E0D \u4e0d) and (U+F967 \u4e0d) described as \u201cfont variants,\u201d the term \u201cZ-variant\u201d being apparently reserved for interlanguage pairs such as the Mandarin Chinese t\u00f9 \u201crabbit\u201d (U+5154 \u5154) and the Japanese to \u201crabbit\u201d (U+514E \u514e). However, the Unicode Consortium's Unihan database treats both pairs as Z-variants. ==See also== *Backward compatibility ==References== Category:Character encoding Category:Unicode Category:Computer-related introductions in 1991 ",
