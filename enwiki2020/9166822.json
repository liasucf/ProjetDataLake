Miller's production of the song is very representative of his style, featuring a very prominent hi hat beat, droning piano performed by Nicky Hopkins, a mellotron performed by Brian Jones, all electric guitars performed by Richards and vocals from Jagger kept even in the mix. According to Mick Jagger,Stray Cat Blues the song was inspired by \"Heroin\" by the Velvet Underground, with the intros of both songs being particularly similar. The song is told from the perspective of a man lusting for illegal sex with a 15-year-old groupie, reasoning that \"it's no hanging matter, it's no capital crime.\" In concert, Jagger sometimes lowered the age to 13. Jim Beviglia ranked \"Stray Cat Blues\" the 49th best Rolling Stones song in Counting Down the Rolling Stones: Their 100 Finest Songs. Uncut called it \"an absolutely filthy song\" but ranked it 39th in its Top 40 Rolling Stones songs. Rolling Stone ranked it 43rd in its countdown of the band's top 100 songs, calling it \"a sleazy rocker.\" A live performance was captured during the Rolling Stones' American Tour 1969 and released on the 1970 live album Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!.
