    "text": "For All You've Done is the thirteenth album in the live praise and worship series of contemporary worship music by Hillsong Church. The live album was released on 4 July 2004 on Hillsong label, which peaked at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart. It had been recorded in February of that year at the Sydney Entertainment Centre with production by Darlene Zschech, Raymond Badham, Joel Houston and Reuben Morgan. ==Recording== For All You've Done was recorded live at the Sydney Entertainment Centre on 29 February 2004 by Darlene Zschech and the Hillsong team. ==Commercial performance== However, its previous two albums debuted in the top five due to the strong following of Hillsong and its previous 12 albums have achieved gold status. It is the first Christian Contemporary music album to reach the top of the Australian charts. There was some controversy about the No. 1 debut as almost all of the albums were sold at the annual Hillsong Conference from 5 to 9 July. However, the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) has defended the outcome on the grounds that For All You've Done was the best selling album in Australia that week. Pop singer and former Australian Idol contestant Paulini Curuenavuli was also at the conference promoting her No. 2 single, \"Angel Eyes\", from her forthcoming album, One Determined Heart. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Chart !Position |- |2004 |ARIA Top 50 Albums Chart (Australia) |1 |- |} ==Track listing == ===CD=== Disc 1 # \"For All You've Done\" (Reuben Morgan) - Worship Leaders: Darlene Zschech & Reuben Morgan - 5:26 # \"One Way\" (Jonathon Douglass & Joel Houston) Worship Leaders: Jonathon Douglass & Marty Sampson, b.
