We taunt her facetiously with > being in love ... whereat she smiles languidly.' Four years later Henry > James commented in a letter to William James, 'We heard from Elly Van Buren > that she is engaged to one Dr. Morris of New Rochelle, a young physician who > has cared for her for 4 years and never has been attentive to any girl in > the interval. I should think Elly's own conscience should sting her.' About > this time Alice James remarked acidly that Elly's flustered carryings - on > about her engagement were likely to exasperate her fianc\u00e9 beyond endurance. > In 1913, Henry, writing to his acolyte Howard Sturgis about the relatives he > had mentioned in his memoir A Small Boy and Others, explained enigmatically, > 'Yes, my Father's two other sisters were my Van Buren and my Temple aunts. I > should have liked to drag in the former's daughter, the intimate of our > childhood, or of mine, later Mrs. Stuyvesant Morris, but forebore.' In > January 1902 William James wrote to Henry during a visit to the United > States, 'I also saw Elly Van Buren, old looking but unaltered in manner.' ===Philanthropy=== In 1907, Morris donated 860 letters addressed to President Van Buren, printed circulars and broadsides, 1,700 other letters and political items to the Library of Congress. His donation, along with that of Mrs. Smith Thompson Van Buren, his mother-in-law, rendered the Library \"a remarkably full one of political documents bearing upon the middle period [as of 1907] of the history of the United States.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1843 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School alumni Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons alumni Stuyvesant Fish Morris Category:People from Manhattan Category:Physicians from New York City Stuyvesant Fish Morris ",
