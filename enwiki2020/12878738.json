    "text": "\"Lady Alpine Blue\" was the Russian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2001. It was performed by the rock group, Mumiy Troll. The lead singer, Ilia Lagutenko, who had also written the song, appeared dressed casually in a navy blue shirt and white trousers. The song's lyrics were rather unusual, but obviously a love song dedicated to the mysterious \"Lady Alpine Blue\", who appeared to be a newcomer in the singers' neighbourhood. The singer is leaving her, but tells her to \"keep on smiling\". It performed sixth on the night, following Israel's Tal Sondak with \"En Davar\" and preceding Sweden's Friends with \"Listen To Your Heartbeat\". At the close of the voting had received 37 points, placing 12th in a field of 23. During voting, the Latvian announcer Ren\u0101rs Kaupers of Brainstorm who was Latvian entry the previous year, greeted Mumiy Troll with \"Viva la rockapops!\" exclamation.Rolling Stone Russia \"Rockapops\" is a term coined by Mumiy Troll frontman Ilia Lagutenko to describe the style of the music performed by himself and his peers. Brainstorm are known to be good friends with Mumiy Troll. It was succeeded as Russian representative by Prime Minister with \"Northern Girl\". == References == Category:Eurovision songs of Russia Category:Eurovision songs of 2001 Category:English-language Russian songs Category:2001 songs ",
