    "text": "Henophidia is a former superfamily of the suborder Serpentes (snakes) that contains boas, pythons and numerous other less-well-known snakes. Snakes once considered to belong to superfamily Henophidia include two families now considered Amerophidia (Aniliidae \u2013 red pipe snakes, and Tropidophiidae \u2013 dwarf \"boas\" or thunder snakes), three families now considered Uropeltoidea (Cylindrophiidae \u2013 Asian pipe snakes, Anomochilidae \u2013 dwarf pipe snakes, and Uropeltidae \u2013 shield-tailed snakes and short-tailed snakes), three families now considered Pythonoidea (Pythonidae \u2013 pythons, Loxocemidae \u2013 Mexican burrowing snake, and Xenopeltidae \u2013 sunbeam snakes), at least one family now considered Booidea (Boidae \u2013 boas [including sand boas and many other lineages often called boas, mostly now considered subfamilies of Boidae]), and Bolyeriidae \u2013 Round Island splitjaw snakes. Because these snakes do not form a monophyletic group they can no longer be formally referred to using a single name. In modern usage, \"Henophidia\" is often placed in quotes, because it can be convenient to refer to all lineages that used to be considered Henophidia. Another way of thinking about it is that \"henophidian\" snakes are all snakes that are not Scolecophidia (blindsnakes) or Caenophidia (so-called \"advanced snakes\"). \"Henophidian\" snakes are sometimes said to be more \"basal\" or \"primitive\" than those belonging to the Caenophidia, but this does not mean that they are inferior or that they have evolved less, rather that we think they share more traits with their common ancestor in comparison to the Caenophidia. ==Etymology== Henophidia comes from the Greek heno- meaning oneheno- at wordinfo.info or former and ophidia meaning serpent,-ophidia at wordinfo.info so former/older snakes (in contrast to Caenophidia, i.e. recent snakes). ==Former families== * Aniliidae \u2013 coral pipe snakes and pipe snakes. * Anomochilidae \u2013 dwarf pipe snakes. * Boidae \u2013 boas (including sand boas) * Bolyeriidae \u2013 Round Island boas. * Cylindrophiidae \u2013 Asian pipe snakes. * Loxocemidae \u2013 Mexican burrowing snake. * Pythonidae \u2013 pythons * Tropidophiidae \u2013 dwarf boas. * Uropeltidae \u2013 shield-tailed snakes and short-tail snakes. * Xenopeltidae \u2013 sunbeam snakes. ==References== Category:Alethinophidia ",
