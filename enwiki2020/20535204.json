    "text": "Athenaeus of Attalia (1st century AD), was a physician, and the founder of the Pneumatic school of medicine. He was born in Cilicia, at Attalia according to Galen,Galen, De Element. ex Hippocr., i. 6. vol. i; Defin. Med., prooem. vol. xix; De Trem. Palpit., etc. c. 6. vol. vii.; De Differ. Puls., iv. 10. vol. viii. or at Tarsus according to Caelius Aurelianus.Caelius Aurelianus, De Morb. Acut., ii. 1 He was the tutor to Theodorus,Diogenes Laertius, ii. 104 and appears to have practised medicine at Rome with great success. Athenaeus appears to have written extensively, as the twenty-fourth volume of one of his works is quoted by Galen,Galen, De Caus. Symptom., ii. 3. vol. vii. and the twenty-ninth by Oribasius.Oribasius, Coll. Medic., ix. 5 Nothing, however, remains but the titles (his chief work being \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u03b2\u03bf\u03b7\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd lit. On Remedies), and some fragments preserved by Oribasius.Oribasius, Coll. Medic., i. 2, v. 5, ix. 5. 12 Galen gives the following report: > Athenaeus of Attaleia ... founded the medical school known as the > Pneumatists. It suits his doctrine to speak of a containing cause in illness > since he bases himself upon the Stoics and he was a pupil and disciple of > PosidoniusTaken literally (rather than as indicating an acquaintance with > Posidonius through his works: Vivian Nutton, Ancient Medicine, p. 203), this > would place Athaenaeus in the 1st century BC instead of the 1st century AD. > Galen's dating is defended by Kudlien, Hermes 90 (1962), pp. 419ff, RE > Suppl. XI pp. 1097ff, cited by I.G. Kidd Posidonius vol. 3, p. 45 (T51). ... > Athenaeus\u2019 three types are as follows: the first consists of containing > causes, the second of preceding causes, and the third of the matter of > antecedent causes: for this is what they call everything external to the > body which harms it and produces disease in it. If what is produced in the > body belongs to the class of what causes disease, then, while it has not > actually brought the disease about, it is called the preceding cause. > Alterations are produced in the natural pneuma by these [i.e., preceding] > causes together with those which are external [i.e., antecedent causes], and > with the body moistened or desiccated, chilled or heated, these are said to > be the containing causes of diseases.
