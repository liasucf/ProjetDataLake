    "text": "\"No quiero escuchar\" (, \"I Don't Want to Listen\") is a song recorded by Spanish singer Lydia. The song was written by Fernando Rodr\u00edguez Fern\u00e1ndez, Alejandro Piqueras Ram\u00edrez, Carlos L\u00f3pez Gonz\u00e1lez and Adolfo Carmona Zamarre\u00f1o. It is best known as the Spanish entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1999 held in Jerusalem. ==Eurovision== For her Eurovision appearance, 19-year-old Lydia wore a much-maligned dress designed by \u00c1gatha Ruiz de la Prada,http://www.eurovision- spain.com/iphp/anos_historia.php?ano=1999&ver;=todo made up of vertical stripes in the colours of the rainbow. By contrast, her four backing singers were dressed entirely in black. The song was performed 3rd, following Belgium's Vanessa Chinitor with \"Like The Wind\" and preceding Croatia's Doris Dragovi\u0107 with \"Marija Magdalena\", and finished 23rd (last), with only one point, awarded by Croatia. Spain did not have to sit out next year's contest, however, because, along with the UK, France and Germany, they were one of the four greatest contributors to the Contest. Thus, the song was succeeded as Spanish entry at the 2000 Contest by Seraf\u00edn Zubiri singing \"Colgado de un sue\u00f1o\". ==Sources and external links== * Official Eurovision Song Contest site, history by year, 1999. * Detailed info and lyrics, The Diggiloo Thrush, \"No quiero escuchar\". == References == Category:Eurovision songs of Spain Category:Eurovision songs of 1999 Category:1999 songs Category:Warner Music Group singles Category:1999 singles ",
