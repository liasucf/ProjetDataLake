    "text": "Same-sex marriage is legal in the Mexican state of Aguascalientes. On 2 April 2019, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation struck down articles 143, 144 and 313bis of the State Civil Code, thereby legalizing same-sex marriages in the state. The ruling came into effect upon publication in the Official Gazette of the Federation on 16 August 2019. ==History== ===Legislative action=== In September 2014, Deputy Cuauhtemoc Escobedo Tejad from the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) announced that Governor Carlos Lozano de la Torre would introduce a civil union bill and possibly a same-sex marriage bill to the Congress of Aguascalientes. Escobeda Tejada further announced that if the Governor did not introduce a bill, he would do so himself. On 4 November 2014, Escobedo Tejada presented a civil union proposal to Congress, defining the civil partnership as \"living together, forming a heritage, having children if they wish, and dealing with situations that arise for a couple.\" A citizens' initiative on same-sex marriage had been introduced to Congress a few weeks prior to his initiative. Debate on three initiatives with different schemes for marriage and civil unions began on 21 November 2014. On 15 June 2016, Martha M\u00e1rquez Alvarado, a congresswoman from the National Action Party (PAN), indicated that she was preparing another civil union proposal and would present it to Congress when ready. In April 2017, the National Human Rights Commision of Aguascalientes announced that they would introduce a new same-sex marriage proposal, Presentar\u00e1 Cedha nueva propuesta de matrimonio igualitario al Congreso and in October 2017 another same-sex marriage bill was introduced to Congress by PRD Deputy Josefina Moreno P\u00e9rez.

PAN SIGUE OPONI\u00c9NDOSE A LOS DERECHOS DE LA COMUNIDAD LGBT DE AGUASCALIENTES ===Injunctions and court challenges=== Despite same-sex marriage not being legal at the time, several same-sex couples were able to legally marry in individual cases through a process called recurso de amparo. Amparos are commonly known as \"injunctions\" in English. In May 2014, couple Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez Flores and Javier Rodr\u00edgueza Rivero requested an injunction against the Civil Registry in Aguascalientes City after it had rejected their request for a marriage license. The couple contested the constitutionality of articles 143, 144 and 313bis of the Civil Code. Article 143 defined marriage as \"the union of one man and one woman\", and article 313bis similarly defined concubinage as between \"one man and one woman\". Article 144 characterized marriage as an institution with the purpose of \"perpetuating the species\". The injunction was approved by the courts on 29 August 2014, and the couple married on 3 September 2014. A lesbian couple, Susana Ortega Guzm\u00e1n and Mariana Mart\u00edn Aguirre, applied for an injunction in May and received a favorable verdict on 2 September 2014. They married on 21 August 2015. On 1 September 2014, Juli\u00e1n Elizalde Pe\u00f1a, coordinator of the organization Colectivo SerGay de Aguascalientes, announced that a third injunction had been requested. On 13 October 2014, Elizalde Pe\u00f1a announced that two more injunctions were pending. By May 2016, seven injunctions had been granted to same-sex couples in the state. In December 2016, another same- sex couple was granted an injunction to marry, Se suma otro amparo sobre matrimonio igualitario a juzgado de distrito and another was granted by the Fourth District Court to a lesbian couple on 25 January 2017.

The Congress of Aguascalientes had recently amended state family law but while doing so did not repeal the state's ban on same-sex marriage. The Commission took this opportunity to file the action of unconstitutionality. On 2 April 2019, the full bench of the Mexican Supreme Court unanimously declared the state's same-sex marriage ban void and unconstitutional, holding that banning same-sex couples from marrying violates Articles 1 and 4 of the Constitution of Mexico. ACCI\u00d3N DE INCONSTITUCIONALIDAD 40/2018, Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Naci\u00f3n The court further ruled that section 1 of article 73 of the Law on the Security of Social Services for Public Servants () was unconstitutional in limiting social security and health services to opposite-sex married or cohabiting couples. Invalida Corte mandatos de ley de seguridad social de Aguascalientes The ruling came into effect once Congress was officially notified and upon publication in the Official Gazette of the Federation (Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n) on 16 August 2019. Prior to this date, the Civil Registry had already begun issuing same-sex marriage certificates. A couple applied to marry the same day as the ruling was handed down, and wed shortly thereafter. On 6 April, a same-sex couple, together for 11 years, wed in a Masonic ceremony. ==Marriage statistics== The following table shows the number of same-sex marriages performed in Aguascalientes since legalization in 2019, as reported by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Number of marriages performed in Aguascalientes ! rowspan=2| Year ! colspan=3| Same- sex ! rowspan=2| Opposite-sex ! rowspan=2| Total ! rowspan=2| % same-sex |- !
