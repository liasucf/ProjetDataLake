It was named after the French word \"triste\" meaning sad to provoke thought regarding the threatened habitat of Madagascar's micro-endemic species. B. Triste was first found in an isolated patch of forest near an expanding city in 2012 by a research team led by Dr. Frank Glaw from the Zoologische Staatssammlung M\u00fcnchen.https://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/17028940 ==References== T Category:Endangered fauna of Africa Category:Endemic fauna of Madagascar Category:Reptiles of Madagascar Category:Reptiles described in 2012 ",
