    "text": "Augustus Jackson (April 16, 1808 \u2013 January 11, 1852) was an African-American ice cream maker and confectioner from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Jackson served as a chef in the White House during the 1820s. While not the inventor of or first person to serve ice cream in the United States, Jackson is often called the \"father of ice cream\" because he pioneered many of its modern manufacturing methods including adding salt to the ice. Additionally, Jackson \"developed techniques to control the custard while it was freezing.\" There is no evidence that Jackson patented any of his recipes or techniques. After leaving the White House, Jackson moved to Philadelphia and created his own successful catering business. He also developed ice cream flavors which he packaged in tin cans and distributed to other ice cream parlors in Philadelphia. Jackson became one of the city's wealthiest residents at the time Augustus died January 11 1852.he was born April 16 1808. ==References== * Lowe, Cliff. , The Ice Cream Man 2003 * Stradley, Linda. \"History of Ices & Ice Cream\", What's Cooking America.
