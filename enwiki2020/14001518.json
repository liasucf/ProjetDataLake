Even her husband Veera Bhadrayya (Kaikala Satyanarayana) fears her. They have two daughters Shobha and Neeru. Anjali Devi is Veera Bhadrayya's mother. Venkateswara Rao/Venkanna (Nandamuri Balakrishna) is the grandson of Anjali Devi and nephew to Veera Bhadrayya. Sesha Ratnam doesn't get along well with her mother-in-law and never allows any of her husband's relatives to enter her house. Veera Bhadrayya wants one of her daughters to marry his nephew Venkateswara Rao. But Sesha Ratnam opposes the proposal. Venkateswara Rao promises his grandmother that he will marry one of Veera Bhadrayya's daughters and unite the families. Venkanna comes to Nakkbokkalapadu to make one of Sesha Ratnam's daughters fall for him. But in the process, both the girls fall for him.
