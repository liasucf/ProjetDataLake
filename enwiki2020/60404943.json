During the evacuation of Fairfield, Joel Dawson (Dylan O'Brien) is separated from his girlfriend Aimee (Jessica Henwick), but promises he'll find her. Seven later, Joel has survived and is living in an underground bunker, as part of a colony. While others go on supply runs Joel is left to the kitchen, as he freezes-up in dangerous situations. Joel makes radio contact with Aimee, learning of her colony and sharing stories of survival. When an ant-monster breaches his colony and another person is killed, Joel sets off on a quest to see Aimee, armed with a crossbow and a dead radio. Passing through the suburbs Joel is attacked by a giant frog, but is saved by a strange dog. Joel follows it to an old bus, and learns the dog's name is Boy, and his owner is gone. Boy follows Joel on his journey, and helps warn him of various dangers. Joel falls into a nest of worm-monsters, but Clyde Dutton (Michael Rooker) and Minnow (Ariana Greenblatt), rescue him from the \"Sand-Gobblers\" and scold him for his lack of survival skills. They are heading north to the mountains, where the cold weather and the elevation means less monsters. They teach Joel some basic survival skills. Clyde teaches Joel that not all monsters will attack, showing him a Boulder Snail and saying that you can always tell in their eyes. After further travel they part ways, and Clyde gifts Joel a grenade. Joel and Boy continue west through a swamp until Boy senses another monster and hides. A giant centipede-monster crawls up from underground, trapping Boy. Joel freezes, but eventually shoots the centipede with the crossbow and saves Boy. To escape the rain they hide in an abandoned house, where a robot named Mav1s (Melanie Zanetti) powers up and greets him. Mav1s is able to show Joel a photos of his parents. Mav1s also powers his radio long enough for him contact Aimee and learn she is close. Aimee tells Joel that new survivors have reached their colony and are going to take them away to safety. Joel loses contact, and Mav1s' battery dies while she is playing Joel some music. In the morning Joel and Boy are attacked by a Queen Sand-Gobbler. They hide but Boy makes noise, giving away their position. Joel kills the Queen with the grenade, but yells at Boy for what he did, and Boy runs off. After swimming across the river Joel is covered in leeches, which poison him and cause hallucinations, but he is rescued before he passes out. Joel wakes up in Aimee's colony, where she is the leader and most of the colonists are elderly and dependent on her. Joel is introduced to the new survivors, Cap (Dan Ewing) and his crew. Cap has offered to take the colony to on their yacht to a safer place. Everyone is packing up and having a farewell party. Joel decides to return to his colony and contacts them on the radio, they are pleased and excited by his survival, but their colony has become unsafe and they will have to leave soon. Cap sends Joel berries, which he recognizes as poisonous. Realizing Cap was lying to them, he rushes to warn Aimee, but he is knocked unconscious. They all awake tied-up on the beach. Cap reveals his group are food thieves. The yacht is not powered, but rather pulled by a large crab-monster that Cap controls with an electrified chain. Cap calls the crab to feed on the colonists. Instead of killing the crab Joel looks into its eyes and shooting the chain, Joel frees the crab from Cap's control, and it takes down their yacht and devours Cap and his team. Boy returns to Joel, and with Aimee's colony saved, Joel decides to head back to his colony and informs her of the safety in the mountains. They share a goodbye kiss, reigniting Aimee's love for Joel, and she tells him she'll find him. Joel treks back 85-miles and finds his friends are still alive. They pack up and head north to find Clyde and Minnow. Joel broadcasts his story on the radio, inspiring other colonies to take to the surface, and Aimee's colony begins moving north to meet Joel.
