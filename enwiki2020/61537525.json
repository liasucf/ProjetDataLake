    "text": "The killing of Khalid Jabara was a 12 August 2016 Tulsa hate crime in which Stanley Vernon Majors escalated from shouting at his neighbors that they were \"dirty Arabs\", \"Mooslems\", and \"dirty Lebanese\" to killing them. Haifa Jabara obtained a restraining order against him, and Majors took out his own protective order against Khalid Jabara. Later, Majors was charged with striking Haifa in a hit and run accident, causing her to suffer a brain hemorrhage, broken ribs, a broken ankle, a damaged shoulder and a broken bone in her arm. He then shot Khalid Jabara as he stood on the front porch. Majors's attorneys pursued an insanity defense, saying Majors was schizophrenic and, thinking the Jabaras were Muslims, feared they would harm him because he was gay. He was convicted of first-degree murder, malicious intimidation or harassment, threatening an act of violence, and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. The incident drew national attention, and legislation named after Jabara was introduced in both houses of the U.S. Congress. ==References== Category:Hate crimes ",
