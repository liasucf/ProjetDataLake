    "text": "Kirigalpotta is the 2nd tallest mountain in Sri Lanka at above mean sea level, and is also the highest mountain in the country whose summit is accessible to the general public (the highest point, Pidurutalagala, is occupied by a military base and off-limits to the public). The peak is situated near the city of Nuwara Eliya, within the Nuwara Eliya District. Only one hiking trail provides access to the mountain's summit via the Horton Plains National Park, although the trail is not very popular. == See also == * Geography of Sri Lanka * List of mountains in Sri Lanka == References == Category:Mountains of Sri Lanka Category:Populated places in Nuwara Eliya District Category:Landforms of Nuwara Eliya District ",
