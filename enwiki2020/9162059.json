    "text": "Camden. New Jersey Transit operates the following bus routes across Camden, Gloucester, and Salem counties, with most running to Philadelphia via the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. At the time that the routes were numbered as such all of these routes crossed the Delaware River via the Benjamin Franklin Bridge; the 403, 405, 407, 413, and 419 have since been cut back to Camden. (The 418 was created as a separate designation of the 409.) All routes into Philadelphia operate via 6th, Market, Broad, and Vine Streets in Center City Philadelphia. Effective Monday, September 19, 2011, bus routes 400 and 403 are now operating as \"Exact Fare\". ==Routes== All service shown is for the full route except for branching. WRTC stands for Walter Rand Transportation Center in the table below. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Route !Western terminus !Service in Camden? !Main routes of travel !New Jersey terminus !Fare collection !Notes !History !Garage |- |400 |Philadelphia |WRTC and local service |Black Horse Pike |Sicklerville |Exact fare | | *Formerly Route F | *Washington Township |- |401 |Philadelphia |WRTC and local service |Broadway/Kings Highway Route 45 |Salem |Full service | *Select Saturday and most Sunday trips ends in Woodbury | *Formerly Route G | *Washington Township |- |402 |Philadelphia |WRTC and local service |Broadway Crown Point Road |Pennsville |Full service | *No weekday midday service *Limited service on weekends | *Formerly Route J | *Washington Township |- |403 |Camden |WRTC and local service |White Horse Pike Sicklerville Road |Turnersville |Exact fare | | *Formerly Route L/M/O | *Washington Township |- |404 |Philadelphia |WRTC and local service |Federal Street Westfield Avenue Park Avenue |Cherry Hill Mall |Exact fare | | *Formerly Route D | *Newton Avenue |- |405 |Camden |WRTC and local service |Federal Street/Kings Highway |Cherry Hill Mall |Exact fare | *Some rush hour trips are extended to Kingston Estates | *Formerly Route 6, then later 456 | *Newton Avenue |- |406 |Philadelphia |WRTC and local service |Route 70 |Berlin |Full service | | *Formerly Route P | *Washington Township |- |407 |Camden |WRTC and local service |Maple Avenue/Main Street |Moorestown Mall |Exact fare | *Select Early Morning and Late night service operates via Mount Laurel | *Formerly Route 7 | *Newton Avenue |- |408 |Philadelphia |WRTC only |Delsea Drive |Millville |Full service | | *Formerly Route T | *Washington Township |- |409 |Philadelphia |WRTC only |Route 130 |Trenton Transit Center |Full service | | *Formerly Route 9A *Additional service between White Horse and Downtown Trenton available on 603/613 | *Newton Avenue |- |410 |Philadelphia |WRTC and local service |Broadway Route 45 Route 77 |Bridgeton |Full service | | *Formerly Route S |Washington Township |- |412 |Philadelphia |WRTC and local service |Broadway Main Street |Glassboro |Full service | *No Sunday service | *Formerly Route W | *Washington Township |- |413 |Camden |WRTC and local service |Route 38 Kings Highway/Marne Highway/Washington Street High Street |Florence River Line Station |Exact fare | | *Formerly Route 71 *Route extended to Florence on 8/31/19 | *Newton Avenue |- |414 |Philadelphia JFK Blvd at 30th Street |Bridge Plaza only |Admiral Wilson Blvd. |Moorestown |Exact fare | *Weekday Peak Hour Service Only (AM to Philadelphia, PM to Moorestown) | *Express variant of 407, created 1/8/11 *Extended from Center City to 30th Street Station as of 1/17/17 | *Newton Avenue |- |417 |Philadelphia JFK Blvd at 30th Street |Bridge Plaza only |Route 130 Limited stops |Willingboro & Mt.
