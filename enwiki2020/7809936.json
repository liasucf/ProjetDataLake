The newspaper's origins can be traced back to the establishment of the Times Community Newspapers by Arthur W. \"Nick\" Arundel. In 1963, Arundel (the son of Pepsi-Cola bottling magnate Russell Arundel) purchased the 165-year-old Loudoun Times-Mirror (based in Loudoun County, Virginia). He rapidly expanded his newspaper business, purchasing papers in Annandale, Centreville, Chantilly, Fairfax, Herndon, McLean, Reston, Springfield, and Vienna, Virginia.Shapiro, T. Rees. \"Arthur W. 'Nick' Arundel, Newspaper Publisher and Philanthropist, Dies at 83.\" Washington Post. February 8, 2011. In 2008, Times Community Newspapers merged its local newspapers in Centreville, Fairfax City, Fairfax Station, Herndon, McLean, Reston, and Vienna into a single publication covering all of Fairfax County. This new publication was the Fairfax County Times.Plumb, Tierney. \"Newspaper Group Launches Fairfax County Times.\" Washington Business Journal. September 11, 2008.
