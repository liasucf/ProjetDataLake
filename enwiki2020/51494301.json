Following the death of Islam Karimov, Uzbekistan's first president, on 2 September 2016, Yuldashev would have become acting President under the terms of the constitution. However, there was no official confirmation that he had taken up the post and, after a few days, he proposed that Prime Minister Shavkat Mirziyoyev (seen by observers as Karimov's likely successor) take the post instead, in light of the latter's \"many years of experience\", and Mirziyoyev was accordingly appointed as interim President by a joint session of both houses of parliament on 8 September 2016. Upon leaving his post as Senate Chairman, Yuldashev was appointed to the post of General Prosecutor by President Mirziyoyev. ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Government ministers of Uzbekistan Category:Living people Category:Members of the Supreme Assembly (Uzbekistan) Category:Members of the Senate of Uzbekistan Category:National University of Uzbekistan alumni Category:People from Tashkent Category:Presidents of Uzbekistan Category:Uzbekistani lawyers ",
