However, on his return in the Triangular tournament of 1912 he was more successful and made 360 runs in six Tests, with 114 at Manchester and 102 at Lord's, both against South Africa. He also had the best bowling of 5/33 in an innings. He served as a Captain in the Australian Army and after the war remained in England and was the first captain of the Australian Imperial Force Touring XI until he was removed following a dispute. He died after a long illness in Lindfield, New South Wales. ==External links== * *AIF database entry Category:1886 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Australia Test cricketers Category:New South Wales cricketers Category:Australian cricketers Category:People from Lismore, New South Wales Category:Cricketers from New South Wales Category:Australian Imperial Force Touring XI cricketers ",
