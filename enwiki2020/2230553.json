    "text": "North Equatorial Current (in black) The North Equatorial Current is a significant Pacific and Atlantic Ocean current that flows east-to-west between about 10\u00b0 north and 20\u00b0 north. It is the southern side of a clockwise subtropical gyre. Despite its name, the North Equatorial Current is not connected to the equator. In both oceans, it is separated from the equatorial circulation by the Equatorial Countercurrent (also known as the North Equatorial Countercurrent), which flows eastward. The westward surface flow at the equator in both oceans is part of the South Equatorial Current. ==See also== * Ocean current * Oceanic gyres * Physical oceanography Category:Currents of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Currents of the Pacific Ocean ",
