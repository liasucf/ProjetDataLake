Allen began playing clarinet and piano as a child, and was playing with Louis Prima at age 15 in 1944. He stayed in Prima's band until 1947, then worked with Claude Thornhill in 1949-1950 and Tex Beneke in 1951-1953. In 1953 he began playing with the Sauter-Finegan Orchestra, playing with them intermittently until 1961, and also worked with Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, and Hal McKusick in the 1950s. Toward the end of the decade, and into the early 1960s, he worked with Gerry Mulligan, Manny Albam, Woody Herman, Thelonious Monk, and Bob Brookmeyer. Later associations include work with Urbie Green, Mundell Lowe, Rod Levitt, and Rusty Dedrick. ==References== *\"Gene Allen\". The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. 2nd edition, ed. Barry Kernfeld.
