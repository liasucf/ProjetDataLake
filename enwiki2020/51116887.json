This manga soon received its motion comic adaptation and provided with voice actors. ==SSSP== SSSP, stands for (also shortened as ) is an attack team that had protected the Earth from monster threats and alien invasions from the past. Following Hayata's separation from Ultraman after his defeat from Zetton, SSSP disbanded and had its original base turned into museum made for remembering the SSSP and Ultraman's missions. In truth, the SSSP operated from shadows and had since protected Hayata and his entire family from being government test subjects after discovering his connection to Ultraman and the fact that he possessed what remains from Ultraman's power. The current SSSP is now led by Edo and several remaining members of the original SSSP. As several outlaw aliens emerge, SSSP finally revealed themselves to the society and created -empowered suits based on the original Ultraman, known as to counter these aliens. At one point, it was considered for cancellation until Shinjiro's development in his flying ability saved the project. ; :Voiced by: Ryohei Kimura (motion comic, anime), Megumi Han (child) (motion comic) (Japanese); Josh Hutcherson, Cassandra Lee Morris (child) (English) :The 17 year old protagonist of this manga. As the son of Shin Hayata, Shinjiro inherited his father's , which gives him superhuman strength and resilience, as shown when he was able to survive from a fall at the age of 5. He also tried to master these abilities by jumping from high buildings while keeping it as a secret to resume a normal life. However, once the emergence of an alien named Bemular threatened him and his father's life, Shinjiro was forced to be enlisted as a member of SSSP. At the request of Edo, Shinjiro was provided with a finalized model of the Ultraman Suit which he used to fight against outlaw aliens, as well as inheriting the title \"Ultraman\". In a mock battle staged by SSSP, with the hired Red fighting against Shinjiro, the boy soon developed an additional ability to maneuver anti-gravity flight, thus saving the Utraman Suit project from cancellation. :While in use of the suit, Shinjiro utilizes a similar fighting stance to the original hero and wields a pair of underneath his arms. These blades can be modified when Shinjiro utilizes the original Ultraman's , performed by having his forearms form a cross stance, with his left arm in a horizontal position and placed forward while his right arm is in a vertical position and placed backward. In contrast to the original, Shinjiro's variant had the beam released from his left Spacium Blade instead of the right arm. The small light on his chest is the (based on Ultraman's Color Timer) which can be removed to access Shinjiro's full power as a last resort tactic. Edo soon provides him with a mimicry system which allows him to become \"Ultraman\" via holographic disguise should the Ultraman Suit be incapable of being deployed. ; :Voiced by: Takayuki Sug\u014d (motion comic), Hideyuki Tanaka (anime) (Japanese); Fred Tatasciore (English) :The original \"Ultraman\" and Shinjiro's father. He has been given the title of Minister of Defense at the beginning of the story. Long ago in the past, he bonded with Ultraman but loses his memory after the giant left him. Following the \"dissolution\" of SSSP, Hayata has settled down and had a family, with a son named Shinjiro Hayata. When Shinjiro was a 5-year-old child, Hayata discovered his son's abnormality when the boy fell from a great height and finally regained his lost memories after Ide showed him the footage of Bemular attacking an airplane. Hayata also inherited the Ultraman Factor (which also passed to Shinjiro) and unknowingly had his entire family protected by his former teammates from being the government's test subjects. Due to this, Hayata enlisted into the reformed SSSP once more and had a hand in developing the Ultraman Suits. Hayata wore the prototype of the Ultraman Suit, called the Proto Suit and first used it to fight Bemular when he threatened Shinjiro's safety. But as the suit was in fact a prototype, Hayata was defeated by Bemular until Shinjiro returned with the finalized Ultraman Suit, using it to fend off against Bemular before he retreated. Hayata would later oversee his son and the entire SSSP's activities after finally passing the \"Ultraman\" title to Shinjiro but once again returned to action when the Ace Killer Squad strikes. He is initially reluctant to have Shinjiro employed into SSSP, wanting his son to experience a normal life. He also views the Ultraman Factor as nothing more than a \"curse\". :The original seems to be identical to that of the finalized version, though lacking a helmet and had its color scheme being black. Hayata fights using the Ultraman's fighting stance in his memory but is comparably weaker due to being lag behind from its finalized version. When Hayata returns to action, the suit was given a helmet based on the finalized version to hide his identity. During the final battle in New York, the suit is further modified with indentations on the chest and shoulder armor, making it Hayata the counterpart to Zoffy, the leader of the Ultra Brothers. ; :Voiced by: Masashi Ebara (motion comic), Ken Uo (anime) (Japanese); Brian Palermo (English) :A former member of the Japan Branch of the Science Special Search Party, and now chief of the .

Edo was approached by Ide to join the SSSP as he agreed, having lend a hand in developing the Ultraman Suits. As the presence of alien beings were supposed to be made secret, Edo bears a wristwatch that allows him to create holographic disguise of a human when walking out in the human world. Knowing that there are times when the Ultraman Suit cannot be deployed, he gave Shinjiro another mimicry system in his possession that allowed the boy to become \"Ultraman\" via holographic disguise. As humanity were initially unprepared for the arrival of aliens, Edo's residential area is in fact the Giant of Light Memorial. He often felt nostalgic whenever he watched the diorama display of Ultraman and Zetton, reminiscing his days as an invader. Being an Alien Zetton, Edo only needed to sleep for two minutes a day. :His appearance, such as wearing a business suit bears resemblance to the Alien Zetton infiltrator that appeared in episode 39 of Ultraman, along with the fact that his human form is also based on Dr. Iwamoto from said series, the same man that the Zettonian infiltrator used to disguise, though no connections between the two were revealed. ; :Voiced by: Tomokazu Seki (motion comic), Takuya Eguchi (anime) (Japanese); Liam O'Brien (English) :A stoic officer who had worked for a long time within SSSP.

He has a rather strained relationship with Shinjiro, doubted if the youth is fit enough to become an Ultraman. He also views Ultraman nothing more as an enforcer-like figure that instantly killed his opponents, which is not shared by the boy. Moroboshi later dons his own Ultraman Suit and revealed his alien heritage to Shinjiro when they pursue Seiji Hokuto. His name is in fact based on Dan Moroboshi from Ultra Seven. :Moroboshi's Ultraman Suit is called , which requires no Ultraman Factor and has a singular visor. His main weapon is the katana and several throwing knives. According to Moroboshi, because of the lack of Ultraman Factor, his fighting skills relies on weaponries, as well as his swordsmanship. The Spacium Sword is empowered by Spacium energies and is capable of slicing through harder materials such as Alien Bris' exoskeleton. Soon, the Ultraman Suit was upgraded into Ver.7.2, which gives him an additional Spacium, two machine guns that are stored in his shoulders and a pair of cannons.

Sometime later, Red and Jack was hired by SSSP to create a commotion in the human world in hopes of witnessing any improvements in the Ultraman Suit. Prior to the attack, Jack had Red appeared in the human world through the use of wristwatch-type mimicry system that disguised him as a kindergarten child. While fighting Red, Shinjiro/\"Ultraman\" developed an ability to perform anti-gravity flight, allowing SSSP to maintain the Ultraman Suit project and gave Jack the signal to stop Red's assault. :Red's appearance is based on Red King from episode 8 of Ultraman.
