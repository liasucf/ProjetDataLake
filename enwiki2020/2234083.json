    "text": "In zooarchaeology and paleontology, ovicaprids or caprines are domestic sheep and goats taken together. Distinguishing sheep and goats from post-cranial skeletal remains has historically been difficult, so in many archaeological reports, the two are often reported in a single ovis/capra category. This is problematic because of their different roles in early animal husbandry.Michael Buckley, \"Zooarchaeology by Mass Spectrometry (ZooMS) Collagen Fingerprinting for the Species Identification of Archaeological Bone Fragments\", p. 227-250 in Christina M. Giovas, Michelle J. LeFebvre, eds., Zooarchaeology in Practice, Nonetheless, experienced analysts using systematic criteria can distinguish the two with high reliability. They can also be distinguished using DNA analysis or collagen fingerprinting. Collagen has the advantage of surviving longer than DNA. ==Notes== Category:Caprids Category:Zooarchaeology Category:Paleontology ",
