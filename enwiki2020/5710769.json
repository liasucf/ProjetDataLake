Critical stages: Canadian theatre in crisis. Oberon Press; April 1998. p. 156. Its primary mandate was to produce and develop local Canadian plays.\"Blyth Festival\". The Canadian Encyclopedia.The History of North American Theater: From Pre-Columbian Times to the Present. Continuum; 1998. . p. 460. In 1975, few scripts that fit the festival's mandate were being written, so the festival's founders began to create new works and adapt the work of other Canadian playwrights. The first season included a play with an established reputation, Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap, but the popularity of the Canadian-written offering, Harry J. Boyle's Mostly in Clover, encouraged the founders to focus on plays with local content.Canadian Theatre Review. Vol. Issues 45-49. 1985. p. 63. The Blyth Memorial Community Hall had an upstairs auditorium which had been little used for decades; this was refurbished to provide a venue for the festival.Canada. APA Publications; 1 January 1993. . p. 145. At that time, the Festival was the only summer theatre producing original Canadian plays. The Blyth Festival's archives are stored at the University of Guelph. One of the festival's most financially successful plays was Beverley Cooper's Innocence Lost: A Play About Stephen Truscott, staged in 2008.\"Canadian playwrights have benefited greatly from Blyth Festival\".
