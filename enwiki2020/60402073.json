It is also regularly co-hosted with other Cambridge academics, especially Helen Thompson, Professor of Political Economy in the Department of Politics and International Studies, and also Christopher Brooke, lecturer in political theory, Chris Bickerton, reader of modern European politics, and the late Aaron Rapport. David Runciman is a long-time contributor to the London Review of Books and Talking Politics is in a partnership with the journal. During the COVID-19 pandemic David Runciman created a spin-off podcast called Talking Politics: History Of Ideas in which he discusses important contributors to modern political theory, such as Thomas Hobbes, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Mahatma Gandhi. == List of episodes == {| class=\"wikitable\" !
