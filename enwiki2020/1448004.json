    "text": "Frances Goodrich (December 21, 1890 \u2013 January 29, 1984) was an American dramatist and screenwriter, best known for her collaborations with her partner and husband Albert Hackett. She received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama with her husband in 1956 for The Diary of Anne Frank which had premiered the previous year. ==Personal life== Goodrich was born in Belleville, New Jersey, the daughter of Madeleine Christy (n\u00e9e Lloyd) and Henry Wickes Goodrich. The family moved to nearby Nutley, New Jersey when Goodrich was two. She attended Collegiate School in Passaic, New Jersey, and graduated from Vassar College in 1912, and attended the New York School of Social Work from 1912 to 1913. She married actor Robert Ames in 1917 (divorced 1923), the writer H.W. Van Loon in 1927 (divorced 1930), and Albert Hackett in 1931. Goodrich and Hackett remained married until she died. Goodrich was Jewish. ==Career== Not long after marrying Hackett, the couple settled in Hollywood in the late 1920s to write the screenplay for their stage success Up Pops the Devil for Paramount Pictures. In 1933, they signed a contract with MGM and remained with them until 1939. Among their early assignments was writing the screenplay for The Thin Man (1934). They were encouraged by director W.S. Van Dyke to use the writing of Dashiell Hammett as a basis only and to concentrate on providing witty exchanges for the principal characters, Nick and Nora Charles (played by William Powell and Myrna Loy). The resulting film was one of the major hits of the year, and the script was considered to show a modern relationship in a realistic manner for the first time. The couple received Academy Award for Screenplay nominations for The Thin Man, After the Thin Man (1936), Father of the Bride (1950) and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1955). They won Writers Guild of America awards for Easter Parade (1949), Father's Little Dividend (1951), Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), and The Diary of Anne Frank (1959), as well as nominations for In the Good Old Summertime (1949), Father of the Bride (1950) and The Long, Long Trailer (1954). They also won a Pulitzer Prize for Drama for their play The Diary of Anne Frank. Some of their other films include: Another Thin Man (1939) and It's a Wonderful Life (1946). ==Death== Frances Goodrich Hackett died from lung cancer on January 29, 1984 at the age of 93 in New York City. ==References== * * ==External links== * * * Category:1890 births Category:1984 deaths Category:American women screenwriters Category:Deaths from cancer in New York (state) Category:Deaths from lung cancer Category:People from Belleville, New Jersey Category:People from Nutley, New Jersey Category:Pulitzer Prize for Drama winners Category:Vassar College alumni Category:Columbia University School of Social Work alumni Category:American women dramatists and playwrights Category:20th- century American dramatists and playwrights Category:20th-century American women writers Category:Screenwriters from New Jersey Category:Tony Award winners Category:Jewish American screenwriters Category:20th-century American screenwriters ",
