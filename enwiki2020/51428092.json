The high schools of the Kishwaukee River Conference are located in McHenry County. == History == On November 8, 2013, it was announced that Woodstock and Woodstock North planned to leave the Fox Valley Conference by 2015 and create a new conference.http://www.nwherald.com/2013/11/08/woodstock-schools-may-look-to- leave-fvc/aa7601m/ After rumors that members of the Big Northern Conference's East Division might join this new conference, it was announced on November 19 that five BNC members - Burlington Central, Genoa-Kingston, Harvard, Johnsburg (which, at the time, was still in the Fox Valley Conference, but was joining the BNC as the start of the 2014\u201315 school year) Marengo, and Richmond-Burton were invited to join the new conference, creating a proposed 8-team conference.http://www.nwherald.com/2013/11/20/richmond-burton-uncertain-on- kishwaukee-river-conference/a64yyz/ The next day, it was announced that the name for this new conference will be the Kishwaukee River Conference.http://www.nwherald.com/2013/11/20/new-eight-team-conference-to-be- called-kishwaukee-river-conference/a64yyz/ In February 2014, it was reported that Harvard and Genoa-Kingston had decided to remain in the BNC, while Richmond-Burton and Johnsburg remained undecided; Harvard later announced that they would, in fact, leave the BNC for the KRC, with the first season of the KRC to be during the 2016\u201317 school year.http://www.nwherald.com/2014/02/19/bnc-wont-admit-woodstock-woodstock- north/akmqqj7/?page=1http://mchenrycountysports.com/articles/2014/05/27/f573bdb51965467cb6de780b7b429ae3/ In June 2014, Richmond-Burton and Johnsburg both voted to officially become charter members of the KRC in 2016.http://mchenrycountysports.com/articles/2014/06/19/8dc0edeb45ef4142893033a7628d4515/http://mchenrycountysports.com/articles/2014/06/25/6d2aa3ca66574a79885db81aa7259053/ On July 19, 2017, the KRC voted 5-1 to remove Burlington Central from the conference, effective following the 2018\u201319 school year. Burlington Central will join the Fox Valley Conference starting in the 2019\u201320 school year. == Membership == The conference's current members, as of 2019\u201320: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! School ! Town ! Team Name ! class=\"unsortable\" | Colors ! EnrollmentStarting in the 2019\u201320 school year, the school enrollments listed by the IHSA are the average of the previous 2 school years. !IHSA Classes 2/3/4The state series class which a school competes in not only depends on the school's student population, but on the sport or activity. Some activities divide schools into two classes, some into three, and others into four. The listing here is in the order of two class, three class, and four class. The more \"A\"s in a class, the larger the schools competing. For more information on this, see Illinois High School Association#State Series Format.Schools are not assigned a classification for football until they have qualified for the playoffs each year. A school's classification not only depends on their student population, but on the populations of the other schools who have qualified. Thus, some schools routinely move between classes. |- |Harvard High School |Harvard |Hornets | |698 |A/2A/3A |- |Johnsburg High School |Johnsburg |Skyhawks | |641 |A/1A/2A |- |Marengo Community High School |Marengo |Indians | |696 |A/2A/2A |- |Richmond-Burton Community High School |Richmond |Rockets | |695 |A/2A/2A |- |Woodstock High School |Woodstock |Blue Streaks | |1009 |AA/2A/3A |- |Woodstock North High School |Woodstock |Thunder | |935.5 |A/2A/3A |} DateFormat = yyyy ImageSize = width:1350 height:auto barincrement:20 Period = from:2015 till:2020 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal PlotArea = right:20 left:0 bottom:50 top:5 #> to display a count on left side of graph, use \"left:20\" to suppress the count, use \"left:20\"<# Colors = id:barcolor id:line value:pink id:bg value:white id:Full value:rgb(0.742,0.727,0.852) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in all sports id:FullxF value:rgb(0.551,0.824,0.777) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in all sports except for football id:AssocF value:rgb(0.98,0.5,0.445) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member for football only id:AssocOS value:rgb(0.78,0.391,0.654) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in some sports, but not all (consider identifying in legend or a footnote) id:OtherC1 value:rgb(0.996,0.996,0.699) # Use this color to denote a team that has moved to another conference id:OtherC2 value:rgb(0.988,0.703,0.383) # Use this color to denote a team that has moved to another conference where OtherC1 has already been used, to distinguish the two PlotData= width:15 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s bar:1 color:Full from:2016 till:2019 text:Burlington Central (2016\u20132019) bar:2 color:Full from:2016 till:end text:Harvard (2016\u2013present) bar:3 color:Full from:2016 till:end text:Johnsburg (2016\u2013present) bar:4 color:Full from:2016 till:end text:Marengo (2016\u2013present) bar:5 color:Full from:2016 till:end text:Richmond-Burton (2016\u2013present) bar:6 color:Full from:2016 till:end text:Woodstock (2016\u2013present) bar:7 color:Full from:2016 till:end text:Woodstock North (2016\u2013present) ScaleMajor = gridcolor:line unit:year increment:1 start:2016 TextData = fontsize:L textcolor:black pos:(0,30) tabs:(400-center) text:^\"BNC Membership History\" #> If the chart uses more than one bar color, add a legend by selecting the appropriate fields from the following six options (use only the colors that are used in the graphic.)
