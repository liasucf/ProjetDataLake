Teams from the territory can qualify for UEFA's two main continental competitions, the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League, and have entered since the 2014\u201315 season. Lincoln Red Imps have represented Gibraltar in four seasons of the Champions League, twice reaching the second qualifying round. In 2016, they won 1\u20130 at that stage against former European champions Celtic, but lost 3\u20131 on aggregate. The team Europa has represented the territory in the Europa League three times, their best performance being losing the second qualifying round to AIK of Sweden in 2016. ==UEFA Champions League== Lincoln Red Imps, after winning the Gibraltar Premier Division for the 12th consecutive time, were the first team from the territory to enter a UEFA competition, the 2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League. They entered in the first qualifying round, where they were drawn against HB T\u00f3rshavn, champions of the Faroe Islands. On 2 July 2014, they hosted the first leg at the Victoria Stadium, and took the lead through a penalty kick by Joseph Chipolina, but Levi Hanssen equalised in a 1\u20131 draw. Six days later in the second leg at T\u00f3rsv\u00f8llur, HB won 5\u20132 (6\u20133 aggregate). In the 2015\u201316 UEFA Champions League, Lincoln again represented Gibraltar, and were drawn in the first qualifying round against FC Santa Coloma, the champions of Andorra. The first leg at home on 30 June 2015 was a goalless draw, then a week later they travelled to the second at the Estadi Comunal d'Andorra la Vella. Ildefons Lima put the hosts ahead before half time, but Lincoln responded with goals from Anthony Bardon and Lee Casciaro to win 2\u20131, becoming the first Gibraltarians to reach the second qualifying round. They lost there, 3\u20130 on aggregate to FC Midtjylland from Denmark. Lincoln represented Gibraltar for a third consecutive time next season. In the first qualifying round, they were drawn against FC Flora from Estonia. In the first leg on 28 June at A Le Coq Arena in Tallinn, Chipolina scored an away goal in a 2\u20131 loss. Eight days later in the second leg, a Chipolina penalty and another goal by Antonio Calder\u00f3n gave the team a 3\u20132 aggregate win. In the next round, Lincoln faced Celtic, champions of Scotland and 1967 European champions. They won the home leg 1\u20130 on 12 July, Casciaro scoring the only goal after 48 minutes, but lost 3\u20130 at Celtic Park eight days later. Europa F.C. won the 2016\u201317 Gibraltar Premier Division to become the first team other than Lincoln Red Imps to play in the Champions League, and were drawn with Welsh champions The New Saints in the first qualifying round. They won the first leg 2\u20131 away but were eliminated after a 3\u20131 extra time loss at home in the second. A new preliminary round was introduced in 2018\u201319 as a knockout tournament for the champions of Europe's four weakest leagues. Hosted at the Victoria Stadium, Lincoln defeated La Fiorita of San Marino but lost the final 4\u20131 after extra time to Drita of Kosovo. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Season ! scope=\"col\"| Team ! scope=\"col\"| Round ! scope=\"col\"| Opponent ! scope=\"col\"| Home ! scope=\"col\"| Away ! scope=\"col\"| Aggregate ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2014\u201315 |rowspan=5| Lincoln Red Imps | 1Q | HB | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\u20131 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2\u20135 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3\u20136 | 17px |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| 2015\u201316 | 1Q | FC Santa Coloma | style=\"text- align:center;\"| 0\u20130 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2\u20131 | style=\"text- align:center;\"| 2\u20131 | 17px |- | 2Q | Midtjylland | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 0\u20132 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 0\u20131 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 0\u20133 | 17px |- ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | 2016\u201317 | 1Q | Flora | style=\"text- align:center;\"| 2\u20130 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\u20132 | style=\"text- align:center;\"| 3\u20132 | 17px |- | 2Q | Celtic | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\u20130 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 0\u20133 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\u20133 | 17px |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2017\u201318 | Europa | 1Q | The New Saints | style=\"text- align:center;\"| 1\u20133 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2\u20131 | style=\"text- align:center;\"| 3\u20134 | 17px |- !rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"row\" | 2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"3\"|Lincoln Red Imps |rowspan=\"2\"| PR | La Fiorita | style=\"text- align:center;\" colspan=3| 2\u20130 | 17px |- | Drita | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=3| 1\u20134 (a.e.t.) |17px |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2019\u201320 | PR | Feronikeli | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=3| 0\u20131 |17px |} ;Notes * PR: Preliminary round * 1Q: First qualifying round * 2Q: Second qualifying round ==UEFA Europa League== College Europa, runners-up to Lincoln in the 2014 Rock Cup, became the first Gibraltarian club to enter the UEFA Europa League, losing 4\u20130 on aggregate in the first qualifying round to FC Vaduz of Liechtenstein. The following season, Europa again qualified, as league runners-up. In the first qualifying round, they faced Slovan Bratislava of Slovakia and lost 9\u20130 on aggregate, including 6\u20130 at home in the first leg, conceding a hat-trick by Karol M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros.

In the second qualifying round, they lost each leg by a single goal to Sweden's AIK. In the 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League, Gibraltar's entries were upgraded to two: league runners-up Lincoln Red Imps and third-placed European debutants St Joseph's. Both were drawn with Cypriot opposition in the first qualifying round and lost heavily on aggregate: 6\u20131 to AEK Larnaca and 10\u20130 to AEL Limassol respectively. Europa and St. Joseph's both entered for Gibraltar in 2018\u201319.
