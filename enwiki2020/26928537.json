    "text": "Taksta (previously CEM-102) is a front-loaded oral dosing regimen of sodium fusidate under development in the U.S. as an antibiotic for gram-positive infections including drug-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). ==Clinical trials== Jan 2010: Taksta has completed enrollment in a Phase 2 trial (due to run until March 2010) and is preparing for Phase 3 studies in the U.S. for acute bacterial skin structure infections (being compared with Linezolid). Sep 2010: Taksta demonstrated comparable clinical success rates compared to linezolid in a Phase 2 trial in the U.S. for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.Craft JC, Moriarty SR, Clark K, Scott D, Degenhardt TP, Still JG, Corey GR, Still JG, Das A, Fernandes P (2011). \"A randomized, double-blind Phase 2 study comparing the efficacy and safeety of an oral fusidic acid loading-dose regimen to oral linezolid in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.\" Clinical Infectious Diseases 52(Supplement 7):S520-S226. Jun 2011: Taksta may be effective in the treatment of chronic prosthetic joint infections and osteomyelitis.Wolfe CR. (2011) \"Case report: treatment of chronic osteomyelitis.\" Clinical Infectious Diseases 52(Supplement 7):S538-S541. Dec 2015: Cempra Doses First Patient in Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Taksta(TM) in Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections. (2015) Nov 2016: Cempra completes Phase 3 Clinical Trial of Taksta(TM) in Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections. Results remain pending. (2016) Feb 2017: Cempra achieves the primary endpoint of a 10% non-inferiority margin. The microbiological success in each ME population with methicillin- resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection is 100 percent (99/99) at both the EOT and PTE visits.
