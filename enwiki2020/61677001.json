He played for Parramatta in the Australian Rugby League competition. ==Early life== Pettet grew up in Coolah, New South Wales before moving to Sydney and signing with Parramatta. ==Playing career== Pettet made his first grade debut for Parramatta in round 7 1996 against the Auckland Warriors at Mt. Smart Stadium which ended in a 28\u20134 loss. In the 1997 ARL season, Parramatta reached the finals for the first time since their premiership success in 1986 as they finished third during the regular season. Pettet played from the bench in Parramatta's qualifying final loss against the Newcastle Knights. Parramatta had led the match 20\u20132 at halftime before losing 28\u201320. The following week, Pettet again played from the bench in the club's 24\u201314 loss against North Sydney at the Sydney Football Stadium.
