Commonly found on food labels, their safety assessment and approval are the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Having a single unified list for food additives was first agreed upon in 1962 with food colouring. In 1964, the directives for preservatives were added, in 1970 antioxidants were added, in 1974 emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners and gelling agents were added as well. ==Numbering schemes== The numbering scheme follows that of the International Numbering System (INS) as determined by the Codex Alimentarius committee, though only a subset of the INS additives are approved for use in the European Union as food additives. Outside the European continent plus Russia, E numbers are also encountered on food labelling in other jurisdictions, including the Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand,Food Standards Australia New Zealand , website Malaysia, Hong Kong,https://www.cfs.gov.hk/english/food_leg/food_leg_lgfa.html India and Israel. They are increasingly, though still rarely, found on North American packaging,See also \"Food Additives\", Food and Drug Administration website especially on imported European food products. ==Colloquial use== In some European countries, \"E number\" is sometimes used informally as a pejorative term for artificial food additives, and products may promote themselves as \"free of E numbers\". This is incorrect, because many components of natural foods have assigned E numbers (and the number is a synonym for the chemical component), e.g. vitamin C (E300) and lycopene (E160d), found in carrots. ==Classification by numeric range== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
