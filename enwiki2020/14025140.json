    "text": "In enzymology, precorrin-6A synthase (deacetylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :S-adenosyl-L-methionine + precorrin-5 + H2O \\rightleftharpoons S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + precorrin-6A + acetate The conversion of precorrin-5 to precorrin-6A is catalysed by the enzyme CobF in Pseudomonas denitrificans The 3 substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine, precorrin 5, and H2O. Its 3 products are S-adenosylhomocysteine, precorrin 6A, and acetate. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:precorrin-5 C1-methyltransferase (deacetylating). Other names in common use include precorrin-6X synthase (deacetylating), and CobF. This enzyme is part of the biosynthetic pathway to cobalamin (vitamin B12) in aerobic bacteria. ==See Also== * Cobalamin biosynthesis ==References== * * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
