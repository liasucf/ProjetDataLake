    "text": "Matayoshi Kobudo is a general term referring to the style of Okinawan Kobudo that was developed by Matayoshi Shinpo \u53c8\u5409\u771e\u8c4a and Matayoshi Shinko \u53c8\u5409\u771e\u5149 during the Twentieth Century. Martial arts have been practiced by the Matayoshi family for over 9 generations and draw influence from Japanese, Chinese and indigenous Okinawan martial arts styles. ==History== In the early 20th century Matayoshi Shinko \u53c8\u5409\u771e\u5149 was asked to demonstrate Kobudo to the Japanese Emperor. He did this twice alongside the likes of Chojun Miyagi and Gichin Funakoshi. Following the death of Matayoshi Shinko in 1947, his son Shinpo, continued his father's legacy by teaching kobudo. Matayoshi Shinpo started a dojo in the 1970s in memory of his father and called it the Kodokan \u5149\u9053\u9928. From the Kodokan he taught a wide variety of traditional weapons associated with Okinawan peasants. In 1972, Matayoshi Sensei created the Zen Okinawan Kobudo Renmei as an organisation dedicated to the teaching and studying of Okinawa Kobudo. Following the death of Shinpo Matayoshi in 1997, Matayoshi Kobudo practitioners now find themselves split into different organisations. Thanks to the extensive teaching of Matayoshi Shinpo and his students, Matayoshi Kobudo has great influence and respect around the world and an estimated 2000 dojos can now be found worldwide. == Weapons and kata == *B\u014d (6 ft Staff) - Shushi no kun, Choun no kun, Sakugawa no kun, Tsuken (Chikin) no kun, Shishi no kun, *Sai (Small Trident) - Matayoshi No Sai Dai Ichi (Nicho Sai), Matayoshi No Sai Dai Ni (Sancho Sai), Shinbaru no sai *Tunkuwa (Wooden Side handled Batton) - Matayoshi No Tunkuwa Dai Ichi, Matayoshi No Tunkuwa Dai Ni *Nunchaku (Threshing short staff) - Nunchaku No Kata *Sansetsukon (Three Sectional Staff) - Sansetsukun No Kata Ichi and Ni *Eku (Boat Oar) - Chikin Akachu No Eku Di *Nunti-Bo (Spear) - NuntiBo No Kata *Tinbei+Seiryuto (Shield+short sword) - Timbei No Kata *Kama (Short sickles) - Kama Nu Ti *Suruchin (Weighted rope / Chain) - Suruchin No Kata *Kuwa (Hoe) - Kuwa Nu Ti *Jo (Stick) - Jojutsu no kata *Tekko (brass knuckles) - Tekko no kata *Tecchyu (iron cylinder) - Tecchyu no kata *KurumanBo (asymmetrical jointed stick) - KurumanBo no kata == Matayoshi lineage == The Matayoshi Family Home is above the Kodokan dojo in Naha Okinawa. Matayoshi Yasushi (the only son of Shinpo) is the spiritual head of the Kodokan as appointed by his father but he has never practiced Matayoshi Kobudo. At the time of his death, Matayoshi Sensei's next in line for technical competence was Yoshiaki Gakiya.
