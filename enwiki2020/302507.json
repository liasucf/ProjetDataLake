    "text": "Proto-Esperanto () is the modern term for any of the stages in the evolution of L. L. Zamenhof's language project, prior to the publication of Unua Libro in 1887. ==The Lingwe uniwersala of 1878== As a child, Zamenhof had the idea to introduce an international auxiliary language for communication between different nationalities. He originally wanted to revive some form of simplified Latin or Greek, but as he grew older he came to believe that it would be better to create a new language for his purpose. During his teenage years he worked on a language project until he thought it was ready for public demonstration. On December 17, 1878 (about one year before the first publication of Volap\u00fck), Zamenhof celebrated his 19th birthday and the birth of the language with some friends, who liked the project. Zamenhof himself called his language Lingwe Uniwersala (Universal Language). W is used for v. Otherwise, all modern Esperanto letters are attested apart from \u0109, \u011d, \u0125, \u0135, \u015d, \u016d. Known verb forms are present -\u00e1, imperative -\u00f3, infinitive -are.Zamenhof appears to have not distinguished acute and grave accents in his orthography (Kiselman 2010:53). Nouns were marked by -e in the singular and -es in the plural; the article was singular la and plural las. It appears that there was no accusative case, and that stress was as in modern Esperanto, except when marked, as in -\u00e1 and -\u00f3. Only four lines of the Lingwe uniwersala stage of the language from 1878 remain, from an early song that Zamenhof composed: {| | ||Malamikete de las nacjes,|| ||Enmity of nations, |- | ||Kad\u00f3, kad\u00f3, jam temp' est\u00e1;|| ||Fall, fall, the time has come! [lit. \"already it is time!\"]; |- | ||La tot' homoze in familje|| ||All humanity in a family |- | ||Konunigare so deb\u00e1.|| ||Must unite. |} In modern Esperanto, this would be, :Malamikeco de la nacioj, :Falu, falu, jam temp' estas; :La tuta homaro en familion :Unui\u011di [= kununuigi sin] devas. Jam temp' est\u00e1 remains an idiom in modern Esperanto, an allusion to this song. ==The Lingvo universala of 1881== While at university, Zamenhof handed his work over to his father, Mordechai, for safe-keeping until he had completed his medical studies. His father, not understanding the ideas of his son and perhaps anticipating problems from the Tsarist police, burned the work. Zamenhof did not discover this until he returned from university in 1881, at which point he restarted his project. A sample from this second phase of the language is this extract of a letter from 1881: :Ma plej kara [ami] miko, kvan ma plekulpa plumo faktid\u017aas tiranno pu to. Mo pot\u00e9 de cen taj brivoj kluri, ke sciigoj de [tuc fuc] fu-\u0107i specco deb\u00e9[j] blessi tal fradral kordol; mo vel vid\u00e9 tol jam ... Modern: Mia plej kara amiko, neniam mia senkulpa plumo fari\u011dus tirano por vi. Mi povas de cent viaj leteroj konkludi, kiel sciigoj de tiu-\u0109i speco devas vundi vian fratan koron; mi kvaza\u016d vidas vin jam ... :(My dearest friend, never (lit. 'when') would my innocent pen become a tyrant for you. From a hundred of your letters I can conclude that announcements of this kind must wound your brotherly heart; I [can] already see you thus...) By this time the letter v had replaced w for the [v] sound; verbal inflection for person and number had been dropped; the nominal plural was -oj in place of -es (as well as adjectival -a and adverbial -e); and the noun cases were down to the current two (though a genitive -es survives today in the correlatives). The accusative case suffix was -l, but in many cases was only used on pronouns: :Ful-\u0107i rud\u017ao e ful-\u0107i fiaro deb\u00e1 kini la princa\u016d (Tiun-\u0109i rozon kaj tiun-\u0109i najtingalon devadis ricevi la princino) 'The princess needed to receive this rose and this nightingale'. Beside the stronger Slavic flavor of the orthography (\u0107, d\u017a, h\u0301, \u015b, \u017a for \u0109, \u011d, \u0125, \u015d, \u0135) compared to the modern language, the imperfective verb forms (present and imperfect) still had final stress: : present tense -\u00e8, imperfect -\u00e0, preterite -u, future -uj, conditional -as, jussive -\u00f3, and infinitive -i. The pronouns ended in a nominal o (or adjectival a for possessives: mo \"I\", ma \"my\"), but there were other differences as well, including a conflation of 'he' and 'it': :{| class=wikitable !1881 pronouns||singular||plural |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|1st person||mo||no |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|2nd person||to||vo |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|3rd masc./neut.||ro||rowspan=2|po |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|3rd feminine||\u015bo |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|3rd reflexive||colspan=2|so |} In addition, there was indefinite o 'one'. The correlatives were similarly close, though it is not clear if there was a distinction between indefinite and relative forms (modern i- and ki-; these may have corresponded to kv- and k-) and no possessive forms are known: :{| class=\"wikitable\" ! ||-o||-u||-a||-e||-al||-el||-am||-om |- |ti- ||fo ||fu ||fa ||fi ||fej ||fe ||fan|| |- |ki- / i- ||kvo, ko ||kvu, ku ||kva || || ||kve, ke ||kvan, kan|| kom |- |\u0109i- ||\u0107io ||\u0107iu || ||\u0107ii || || ||\u0107ian || |- |neni- ||fio ||fiu || || || || ||fian || |} The last row was evidently pronounced as fj-. Esperanto at this stage had a consonantal ablaut in verbs, with a voiceless consonant for an attempt at something, and a voiced consonant for success. For example, a\u016dti to listen (for), a\u016ddi to hear; trofi to look for, trovi to find; prufi to argue (a point), pruvi to prove. Traces of this remain in a few pairs of words such as pesi 'to weigh (an item)' and pezi 'to weigh (have weight)' (cf. their derivatives pesilo 'scales' & pezilo 'a weight').Kiselman (2010:64\u201365) ==Transition to the modern Esperanto of 1887== Zamenhof refined his ideas for the language for the next several years. Most of his refinements came through translation of literature and poetry in other languages. The final stress in the verb conjugations was rejected in favour of always stressing the second- last vowel, and the old plural -s on nouns became a marker of finite tenses on verbs, with an imperfect -es remaining until just before publication. The Slavic-style acute diacritics became circumflexes to avoid overt appearances of nationalism, and the new bases of the letters \u0135, \u011d (for former \u017a, d\u017a) helped preserve the appearance of Romance and Germanic vocabulary. In 1887 Zamenhof finalized his tinkering with the publication of the Unua Libro (First Book), which contained the Esperanto language as we know it today. In a letter to Nikolai Borovko he later wrote, ==Later proposals by Zamenhof== By 1894, several proposals of changes on Esperanto had appeared. Zamenhof was pressured to answer and presented a reformed version himself. The changes were not well received by the community and were later rejected by Zamenhof. ==Further reading== * Gaston Waringhien, in his book Lingvo kaj Vivo (Language and Life), analyzed the evolution of the language through manuscripts from 1881, 1882, and 1885. ==See also== *Arcaicam Esperantom \u2013 a constructed fictitious 'archaic' version of Esperanto. ==References== ==External links== *Christer Kiselman, 2010.
