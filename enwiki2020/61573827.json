    "text": "Upside-Down Magic is a Disney Channel Original Movie and adaptation of the eponymous fantasy book series by Sarah Mlynowski, Lauren Myracle, and Emily Jenkins. The film stars Izabela Rose and Siena Agudong. It premiered on Disney Channel on July 31, 2020. ==Plot== Best friends Elinor \"Nory\" Boxwood-Horace and Reina Carvajal enroll at Sage Academy and show off their abilities to the teachers so they can be placed in a magic class. While Reina is placed in the Flare class, Nory is placed in the Upside-Down Magic program by Headmistress Knightslinger which is run by Budd Skriff. In this program are students who have imperfect abilities as Headmistress Knightslinger considers them to be easy targets for the Shadow Magic, an evil force that uses a person\u2019s magic against everyone else through possession. As Nory and her fellow students plan to perfect their abilities, Headmistress Knightslinger is unaware that the Shadow Magic has ways of targeting the most unlikely students. Reina discovers a book about Shadow Magic and, unbeknownst of the Shadow Magic legend that Nory and the other UDMs were taught, takes the book to the form and finds a page about strengthening magical abilities. Reina reads the page because she was being belittled by a fellow Flare student with powers greater that hers. The next day Reina prepares for Founders\u2019 Day, where Reina competes against the fellow Flare who has stronger powers. Reina\u2019s powers are unusually strong, and she gets to represent the Flares. Nory attempts to crash the competition by turning into a kitten, but instead becomes a bird-type hybrid. Reina uses Nory\u2019s favorite Flare move but it almost burns Nory because Reina\u2019s powers have been so unusually strengthened. Reina meets Chara, a fellow Flare who trusts in Reina\u2019s abilities. The Shadow Magic book starts appearing after where Reina goes, and Reina tells Chara to take the book with her. Chara takes it but it reappears in Reina\u2019s room. Chara reveals to be an embodiment of Shadow Magic in human form the next day when the other Flares cannot see who Reina is talking to. Chara reprimands Reina and possesses her. At Founders\u2019 Day, Reina goes up to represent the Flares and uses a complicated Flare trick and becomes a shadow-like being who threatens to destroy the entire school. Eventually it is the UDMs who are able to rescue Reina and return her to normal. ==Cast== * Izabela Rose as Elinor \"Nory\" Boxwood-Horace, a 13-year old abnormal Fluxer who can transform into unusual hybrid animals like a Dritten (a cat/dragon hybrid). * Siena Agudong as Reina Carvajal, Nory's best friend and Flare student who can manipulate fire. * Kyle Howard as Budd Skriff, the teacher of the Upside Down Magic school and groundskeeper who is later revealed to be an abnormal Fuzzy that can only communicate to animals by singing * Elie Samouhi as Elliot Cohen, an abnormal Flare who can make smoke instead of fire * Alison Fernandez as Pepper Paloma, an abnormal Flicker who can push things away from her * Max Torina as Andres Padillo, an abnormal Flyer who can fly to increasingly high heights and has trouble coming back down * Vicki Lewis as Linda Knightslinger, the headmistress of Sage Academy * Yasmeen Fletcher as Chandra, a manifestation of Shadow Magic who can only be seen by Reina * Callum Seagram Airlie as Phillip, a student in the Flare class * Cynthia Kaye McWilliams as Professor Argon, the teacher of the Flare class * Elaine Kao as Professor Han, the teacher of the Fluxer class * Amitai Marmorstein as Professor Lewis, the teacher of the Flicker class ==Production== ===Development and casting=== Disney Channel optioned the book series in 2015.
