She pushed the Republican Party to include an equal suffrage plank in its platform. An Iowa newspaper at the time credited Grim's oratory skills along with her youth and beauty for bringing support to the plank. When the Illinois state senate passed its equal suffrage bill in 1911, Grim was the only woman present. Grim worked for Wisconsin to pass a state suffrage amendment in 1912. She spent a year leading up to the vote traveling the state giving public speeches. In 1914 she traveled to North Dakota to give speeches and urge the passage of a state suffrage amendment there. === Later career === Grim later became a school principal in Darlington, Wisconsin.
