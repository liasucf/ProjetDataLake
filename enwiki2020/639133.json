He provided the voices for Kerchak the gorilla in the 1999 Walt Disney Feature Animation film Tarzan, General Shepherd in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Fleet Admiral Steven Hackett in BioWare's Mass Effect video game trilogy. He also appeared as Vukovich in The Terminator and for his starring role as Ed Harley in the cult horror film Pumpkinhead (1988). ==Early life== Henriksen was born in Manhattan. His father, James Henriksen, was a Norwegian merchant sailor and boxer nicknamed \"Icewater\" who spent most of his life at sea. His mother, Margueritte Werner, struggled to find work as a dance instructor, waitress and model. His parents divorced when he was two years old, and his mother raised him and his brother. Growing up, Henriksen had a reputation for getting into trouble in the various schools he attended, and even spent time in a children's home. He left school after completing first grade. He served in the United States Navy from 1955\u201358 and attained the rank of Petty Officer Third Class. ==Career== Henriksen found work as a muralist and as a laborer on ships. For a time, he worked in Europe. His first theater work, around age 30, was as set designer, and he received his first acting role because he built the set for a production. Illiterate until then, it was around this time that he taught himself to read. For his first role, he put the entire script to tape with the help of a friend, learning everyone's part in addition to his own. Soon afterward, he graduated from the Actors Studio and began acting in New York City. Henriksen's first film appearance was in It Ain't Easy in 1972. It was followed by supporting roles in a variety of films, including Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), and Damien: Omen II (1978). He played Police Chief Steve Kimbrough in Piranha Part Two: The Spawning (1982), the astronaut Walter Schirra in The Right Stuff (1983), and actor Charles Bronson in the television film Reason for Living: The Jill Ireland Story (1991). When James Cameron was writing The Terminator (1984), he originally envisioned Henriksen, with whom he had worked on Piranha II: The Spawning, playing the title role, a cyborg. The role ultimately went to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Henriksen does appear in the film in the supporting role of Vukovich, a member of the Los Angeles Police Department. Henriksen in 2010 Henriksen played the android Bishop in Cameron's films Aliens (1986), and as Bishop's unnamed designer in Alien 3 (1992).

He portrayed gunfighters in the Westerns Dead Man and The Quick and the Dead, and appeared with British actor Bruce Payne in Aurora: Operation Intercept in 1995. He appeared with Payne again in Face the Evil (1997), and the dystopian classic Paranoia 1.0 (2004). That year, he also played Sheriff Doug Barnum in the film Powder. In 1996, Henriksen starred in the television series Millennium, created and produced by Chris Carter, the creator of The X-Files.

His performances on Millennium earned him critical acclaim, a People's Choice Award nomination for Favorite New Male TV Star, and three consecutive Golden Globe nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a TV Series (1997\u20131999). The series was cancelled in 1999. On television, Henriksen appeared in the ensemble of Into the West (2005), a miniseries executive- produced by Steven Spielberg.
