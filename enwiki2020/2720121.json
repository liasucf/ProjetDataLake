Each edge has two octahedra and one icosahedron. Each vertex has five octahedra and two icosahedra. In total it has 3600 triangle faces, 3600 edges, and 720 vertices. Containing the cell realms of both the regular 120-cell and the regular 600-cell, it can be considered analogous to the polyhedron icosidodecahedron, which is a rectified icosahedron and rectified dodecahedron. The vertex figure of the rectified 600-cell is a uniform pentagonal prism. == Semiregular polytope == It is one of three semiregular 4-polytopes made of two or more cells which are Platonic solids, discovered by Thorold Gosset in his 1900 paper. He called it a octicosahedric for being made of octahedron and icosahedron cells. E. L. Elte identified it in 1912 as a semiregular polytope, labeling it as tC600. == Alternate names == * octicosahedric (Thorold Gosset) * Icosahedral hexacosihecatonicosachoron * Rectified 600-cell (Norman W.

It has a chiral bi-diminished pentagonal prism vertex figure. Each removed vertex creates a pentagonal prism cell, and diminishes two neighboring icosahedra into pentagonal antiprisms, and each octahedron into a square pyramid. This polytope can be partitioned into 12 rings of alternating 10 pentagonal prisms and 10 antiprisms, and 30 rings of square pyramids. {| class=wikitable width=360 !Schlegel diagram !Orthogonal projection |- align=center valign=top |180px Two orthogonal rings shown |180px 2 rings of 30 red square pyramids, one ring along perimeter, and one centered. |} 200px Net === H4 family === === Pentagonal prism vertex figures === == References == * Kaleidoscopes: Selected Writings of H.
