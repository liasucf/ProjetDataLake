It centred on the town of Campbell Town in the Midlands region of Tasmania between Hobart and Launceston. The seat was created in a redistribution ahead of the 1903 state election, largely replacing the seat of Campbell Town, and was abolished when the Tasmanian parliament adopted the Hare-Clark electoral model in 1909. It had a single member during its existence, William Bennett. ==Members for Cambria== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Term |- | | William Bennett | 1903\u20131909 |} ==References== * * * Parliament of Tasmania (2006).
