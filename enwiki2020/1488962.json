    "text": "In mathematics, a free regular set is a subset of a topological space that is acted upon disjointly under a given group action. To be more precise, let X be a topological space. Let G be a group of homeomorphisms from X to X. Then we say that the action of the group G at a point x\\in X is freely discontinuous if there exists a neighborhood U of x such that g(U)\\cap U=\\varnothing for all g\\in G, excluding the identity. Such a U is sometimes called a nice neighborhood of x. The set of points at which G is freely discontinuous is called the free regular set and is sometimes denoted by \\Omega=\\Omega(G). Note that \\Omega is an open set. If Y is a subset of X, then Y/G is the space of equivalence classes, and it inherits the canonical topology from Y; that is, the projection from Y to Y/G is continuous and open. Note that \\Omega /G is a Hausdorff space. ==Examples== The open set :\\Omega(\\Gamma)=\\\\{\\tau\\in H: |\\tau|>1 , |\\tau +\\overline\\tau| <1\\\\} is the free regular set of the modular group \\Gamma on the upper half-plane H. This set is called the fundamental domain on which modular forms are studied. ==See also== * Covering map * Klein geometry * Homogeneous space * Clifford\u2013Klein form * G-torsor ==References== Category:Topological groups Category:Group actions (mathematics) ",
