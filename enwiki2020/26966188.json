Normann was the artist who invited Edvard Munch to Berlin, where he painted The Scream. Normann's fjord paintings are credited with making the Norwegian fjords a more popular tourist destination. ==Biography== Normann was born in 1848 in Bodin in Norway. He studied at the Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf from 1869 to 1872 and his paintings belong to the D\u00fcsseldorf school of painting. He studied with the Estonian painter Eugen D\u00fccker.Adlsteen Normann , Burlington.co.uk, accessed April 2010 His paintings were nearly always landscapes and invariably of the fjords of Norway where he would show the water combined with small houses and boats and steep mountainsides. Beginning in 1883, Normann was based in Berlin.Nineteenth-century painters and painting: a dictionary, Volume 1977, Part 2, Geraldine Norman, p.160, accessed April 2010 In the early 1890s, Normann was doing good business selling his paintings to hotel owners. After seeing the work of his countryman Edvard Munch work when it was exhibited in Kristiania, Normann wrote to Munch asking if he would exhibit his work in Berlin. Munch was so overcome that he packed up his exhibition on 20 October 1892 and went to Berlin where Normann befriended him. Munch's work was placed in an exhibition which caused such a stir that the painters in Berlin split into two societies. (It was suspected that the underlying reason for Normann's invitation to Munch was to cause this split).Edvard Munch: Behind the Scream, Sue Prideaux, p.135-7, 2007, , accessed April 2010 Normann exhibited in Oslo, Berlin, London, Vienna, D\u00fcsseldorf, Munich and Paris. Although based in Germany from 1883, he would return to Norway each summer. Normann and Hans Dahl both had large ornamented wooden villas near Balestrand where they would entertain.Nordic landscapes: region and belonging on the northern edge of Europe, Michael Jones, Kenneth Olwig, p.392, accessed April 2010 His \"dragon style\" house was bought in 1891 and built (like many Norwegian houses) from a pre-fabricated kit from the city of Trondheim. The house stayed with his heirs until 1934.Villa Normann, nrk.no, accessed April 2010 Normann notably exhibited at the prestigious Salon de Paris from as early as 1882. His paintings earned a 'Mention Honorable' in 1884 and he was awarded a bronze medal in 1889. It is assumed that his fjord paintings contributed to make the Norwegian fjords a popular tourist destination. He died in Kristiania (now: Oslo) on 26 December 1918, during the worldwide Spanish flu pandemic. ==Legacy== Normann's paintings are included in galleries in Bergen, Boston, Cincinnati, Cologne, Dresden, Leeds, Liverpool and Stockholm. In Normann's birthplace in 2010 is a dedicated gallery which has thirty of his paintings.Adelsteen Gallery , Bod\u00f8, Norway ==Selected paintings== File:Adelsteen Normann Sognefjord.jpg|Sognefjord File:Adelsteen Normann-Munken g\u00e5rd i Esefjorden.jpg|Farm at Esefjord File:Adelsteen Normann The Trollfjord in Lofoten & Vester\u013alen.jpg|Trollfjord in Lofoten near Vester\u00e5len ==References== ==External links== * Category:1848 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Norwegian landscape painters Category:People from Bod\u00f8 Category:Norwegian expatriates in Germany Category:19th-century Norwegian painters Category:20th-century Norwegian painters Category:Deaths from Spanish flu ",
