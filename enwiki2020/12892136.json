    "text": "\"Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag, and Smile, Smile, Smile\" is the full name of a World War I marching song, published in 1915 in London. It was written by Welsh songwriter George Henry Powell under the pseudonym of \"George Asaf\", and set to music by his brother Felix Powell.Pegler, Martin, Soldiers' Songs and Slang of the Great War. Osprey Publishing, 2014, , pages 263\u2013264. It was featured in the American show Her Soldier Boy, which opened in December 1916.Paas, John Roger (2014). America Sings of War: American Sheet Music from World War I. Harrassowitz Verlag. p. 38, . Performers associated with this song include the Victor Military Band, James F. Harrison, Murray Johnson, Reinald Werrenrath, and the Knickerbocker Quartet.Paas, John Roger (2014). America Sings of War: American Sheet Music from World War I. Harrassowitz Verlag. p. 38. . A later play presented by the National Theatre recounts how these music hall stars rescued the song from their rejects pile and re-scored it to win a wartime competition for a marching song. It became very popular, boosting British morale despite the horrors of that war. It was one of a large number of music hall songs aimed at maintaining morale, recruiting for the forces, or defending Britain's war aims. Another of these songs, \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\", was so similar in musical structure that the two were sometimes sung side by side. ==Lyrics== The song is best remembered for its chorus: :Pack up your troubles in your old kit-bag :And smile, smile, smile, :While you've a lucifer to light your fag, :Smile, boys, that's the style. :What's the use of worrying? :It never was worth while :So pack up your troubles in your old kit-bag :And smile, smile, smile. ==In other languages== The Dutch version goes: :Pak al je zorgen in je plunjezak en fluit, fluit, fluit! :Aan alle moeilijkheden heb je lak, fluit man en 't is uit! :Waarom zou je treuren, het helpt je niet vooruit, :Dus: pak al je zorgen in je plunjezak en fluit, fluit, fluit. The Spanish version :\u00a1Guarda tus penas en el fondo del morral y r\u00ede ya. :Ponte contento y as\u00ed vencer\u00e1s la dificultad. :Siempre estar\u00e1s alegre, nunca triste estar\u00e1s, \u00a1no! [or \u00a1jam\u00e1s!] :\u00a1Guarda tus penas en el fondo del morral y r\u00ede ya. The German version: :Weit ist der Weg zur\u00fcck ins Heimatland, so weit, so weit :Dort bei den Sternen \u00fcber'm Waldesrand liegt die alte Zeit :Jeder brave Musketier sehnt heimlich sich nach dir :Weit ist der Weg zur\u00fcck ins Heimatland, ja weit, so weit! The Norwegian translation \"Legg dine s\u00f8rger i en gammel sekk\" (possibly 1916) and the Swedish \"L\u00e4gg dina sorger i en gammal s\u00e4ck\" (1917) were by written by Karl-Ewert Christenson (1888\u20131965) and recorded by singer Ernst Rolf. == Other performances == Florrie Forde performed it throughout the United Kingdom in 1916. Other performers associated with this song include Helen Clark, Reinald Werrenrath, and Oscar Seagle. Cilla Black performed the song as a comedy/singing sketch on her variety television series Surprise Surprise. The original version was sampled in and inspired the song \"Pack Up\" by English musician Eliza Doolittle. == In film == The song appears in several films, including Varsity Show (1937 film) with Dick Powell Pack Up Your Troubles (1932) with Laurel & Hardy, High Pressure (1932), and The Shopworn Angel (1938). It is also featured in For Me and My Gal (1942) starring Judy Garland and Gene Kelly, and \u201cOn Moonlight Bay\u201d with Gordon MacRae and Doris Day (1951).
