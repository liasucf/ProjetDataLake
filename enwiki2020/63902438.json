    "text": "The Reluctant Dragon & Mr. Toad Show is a 1970 American animated television series that aired on ABC's Saturday morning schedule. The show features two characters created by British children's writer Kenneth Grahame: the Reluctant Dragon from the 1898 short story of the same name, and Mr. Toad from the 1908 novel The Wind in the Willows. The show was created by Rankin/Bass Productions in New York City, who produced 17 episodes. The show was a flop, airing from September 12 until December 26, 1970, when it was pulled from the Saturday morning schedule. A year later, ABC aired reruns of the show on Sunday mornings from September 12, 1971 to September 17, 1972. The half-hour comedy program included three shorts on each episode: the Reluctant Dragon took the first and third slots, with a Mr. Toad cartoon in the middle. Written by Romeo Muller and William J. Keenan, the series uses a team of Canadian voice actors with Bernard Cowan as the recording supervisor. Tobias, the Reluctant Dragon, was voiced by Paul Soles; other characters were performed by Donna Miller, Claude Rae and Carl Banas. The series' character designs were done by Paul Coker, Jr., and the animation supervision by Japanese-American animator Steve Nakagawa at Mushi Production in Tokyo. ==The Reluctant Dragon== Tobias is a gentle, dreamy dragon who was cursed by the wizard Merlin with flaming breath, which comes upon him every time that he sneezes. He is a kind-hearted soul who doesn't want to hurt the populace of Willowmarsh Village, and is ashamed whenever he erupts in flame. He's regularly troubled by a little blonde girl who wants to give him a bouquet of daisies, which make him sneeze. Tobias is aided by a knight, Sir Malcolm Giles, who tries to protect both the village and the dragon. Willowmarsh is ruled by King Herman, who hosts a variety show. Other characters include Sir Andrew, Irving the Bold and Ugliola. Titles of the Reluctant Dragon cartoons included \"National Daisy Week\", \"The Campscout Girls', \"A Cold Day in Wilowmarsh\", \"The Tobias Touch\" and \"Tobias, the Reluctant Viking\". ==Mr. Toad== J. Thaddeus Toad is a gadabout playboy who likes driving fast cars and wearing expensive clothes. He's the wealthy owner of Toad Hall, and an object of ridicule among his friends \u2014 the timid Mole, intellectual Badger and outgoing Water Rat. Mr. Toad stories included \"Ghost of Toad Hall\", \"Micemaster Road\", \"Build a Better Bungalow\", \"Polo Panic\" and \"Jove! What a Day\". In 1987, Rankin/Bass produced a more faithful TV-movie adaptation of The Wind in the Willows. ==Episode list== # A Cold Day in Willowmarch / Build a Better Bungalow / A Day at the Fair # Cowardly Herman / Casey Tad / Daisies Away # Dippy / Gentlemen's Gentleman / Dragon Under Glass # Free a Cold, Starve a Viking / Ghost of Toad Hall / Happy Birthday, Dear Tobias # How to Be a Wizard / Jack of All Trades / How to Vex a Viking # If It's a Wednesday It Must Be Vikingland / Jove!
