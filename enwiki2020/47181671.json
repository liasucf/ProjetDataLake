    "text": "Alexandru Tudor-Miu (February 25, 1901 - July 26, 1961) was a Romanian poet. Born into a peasant family in Brazi, Prahova County, he attended primary school in his native village, followed by high school at Ploie\u0219ti. Between 1918 and 1920, he worked as a schoolteacher in Pantazi, in his native county. In 1921, he was a laboratory assistant at the refinery in C\u00e2mpina, and was subsequently employed by Concordia-Electrica company. From 1945 until his death, he headed the electrotechnical school in C\u00e2mpina. Together with Geo Bogza, he began the local surrealist movement. Inspired by the latter's magazine Urmuz, he founded and edited three more: C\u00e2mpina (1927-1929), Prahova (1930) and Strada (1932-1936). His first poetry was published in Ploie\u0219tii literari in 1921; his first book was the 1932 Epode. His two other volumes were Standard, poeme de petrol \u0219i energie (1934) and \u00cent\u00e2lnire cu pas\u0103rea Phoenix (1947). Magazines that published his work include Contimporanul, Universul literar, Izb\u00e2nda, Via\u021ba literar\u0103, Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103, Na\u021biunea and Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103. He left behind three volumes of poetry in manuscript form (Albastru \u2013 poeme de mare, Steaua Doftanei and Cheia Universal\u0103), a book of newspaper reports (Excursii) and a historical monograph of C\u00e2mpinei. His poems, replete with metaphors, were written in surrealist fashion.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, vol. II, p. 732.
