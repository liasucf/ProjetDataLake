He made his senior debut with the club in 2006, and played three third-division seasons with it. In the summer of 2009, Costa joined neighbouring C.D. Nacional, appearing in 14 games in his first season in the Primeira Liga (nine as a substitute) and scoring two goals as the team finished in seventh position.

Mar\u00edtimo, where he was named captain before the start of 2016\u201317. ==References== ==External links== * *National team data * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:People from C\u00e2mara de Lobos Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Madeiran footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Association football forwards Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:C.F.
