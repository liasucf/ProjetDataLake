In the meantime, the dumb David (J. Pranav) comes to live with them. David was acting as a speech-impaired person and breaks into the three friend's life to take revenge. David slickly kills Bharani's two friends with the help of Joseph (Kolangal Shyam) and burns their body to get rid of the evidence. David now plans to kill his last target: Bharani. Bharani who is in a college trip in Kodaikanal is shocked to see David there and he kills Bharani and burns his dead body in the forest. The police inspector Dharma (Mansoor Ali Khan) finds out that David is the killer and arrests him. In court, David reveals that he had killed four people for justice and requests an open courtroom, and the judge accepts after much thinking. In the past, David worked in the real estate business and lived with his beloved sister Anitha (Nisha). Anitha and his friend Joseph were about to get married. One day, Anitha's mobile phone was stolen in a restaurant by the waiter and the waiter sold it to Bharani. Bharani found her photos on her phone, he morphed obscene pictures of her and sent it to her contact list. Anitha was then harassed by men who saw her pictures. An unsettled and ashamed Anitha committed suicide by self-immolation and a vengeful David decided to take revenge on the person who edited his sister's pictures. David found out that the restaurant waiter stole his sister's phone. David met him and threatened to tell him everything. David then murdered him and burned his body.
