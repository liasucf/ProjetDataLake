    "text": "Brett Toth (born September 1, 1996) is an American football offensive tackle for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He is also a United States Army ROTC instructor at Arizona State University. He is an Army Black Knights football graduate who is a beneficiary of revised United States Department of Defense policies regarding professional athletic career opportunities for military service academy graduates. Toth is a second lieutenant in the United States Army with deferred service. ==Early life== Toth attended West Ashley High School in Charleston, South Carolina. ==West Point career== Toth studied physics and nuclear engineering at West Point and became the first person to represent Army at the Senior Bowl when he was invited to participate in the 2018 edition. He also played in the 2018 East\u2013West Shrine Game. As a junior for the 2016 Army Black Knights football team triple option offense (which finished second in the country with a 339.5 yards of offense per game), he was rated as the fifth-best run-blocking tackle in NCAA football according to Pro Football Focus and the 23rd-best offensive lineman according to Bleacher Report. During his senior season, the 2017 Army Black Knights led the nation in offense. During that season, Army rushed 785 times last season and attempted just 65 forward passes. Toth served as a graduate assistant for the 2018 Black Knights and he executed the engineering officer training, earning a platoon leader role. ==Professional football career== When Toth entered his commitment at West Point, there was a 5-year service commitment. However, the policy was changed to 24 months during his stay. There had been precedent (such as Joe Cardona of the 2015 NFL Draft) for military school graduates to be allowed to defer their 24-month service policy, but in 2017, United States Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis rescinded the policy to allow military service academy student-athlete graduates to delay their assignments to explore professional sports opportunities. In June 2019, United States President Donald Trump requested that a policy be established to facilitate athletic pursuits and 2019 NFL Draft selectee Austin Cutting was the first to sign a professional contract following the new policy. When Toth applied for his waiver in August 2019, he was stationed at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri. Toth cites Alejandro Villanueva, Collin Mooney and Josh McNary as his role models. Toth had served a year as a second lieutenant before being granted a deferment. In August 2019, he signed a three-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles even though he had already missed all of training camp and two preseason games. The Eagles waived Toth, but he was claimed by the Cardinals at the end of the 2019 preseason. He was placed on the reserve/non-football illness list by the Cardinals on October 19, 2019. On September 4, 2020, Toth was waived/injured by the Cardinals, and reverted to the team's injured reserve list two days later. He was released on October 6, 2020. On October 7, 2020, Toth was claimed off waivers by the Philadelphia Eagles. ==References== Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Players of American football from South Carolina Category:Sportspeople from Charleston, South Carolina Category:American football offensive linemen Category:Army Black Knights football players Category:United States Army personnel Category:Philadelphia Eagles players Category:Arizona Cardinals players ",
