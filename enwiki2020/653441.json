As Michiko Kakutani writes, \"one can find echoes...of her great-granduncle Leo Tolstoy's work - his love of nature, his psychological insight, his attention to the details of everyday life\"., nytimes.com, 25 Apr 1989. But \"her luminous, haunting stories most insistently recall the work of Chekhov, mapping characters' inner lives and unfulfilled dreams with uncommon sympathy and insight\", and also display \"the author's Nabokovian love of language and her affinity for strange excursions into the surreal, reminiscent of Bulgakov and Gogol.\" , nytimes.com, 11 Feb 2003. She spent much of the late Eighties and Nineties living in the United States and teaching at several universities., nyrb.com, 22 March 2017.

It has been described as \"an account of a degraded world that is full of echoes of the sublime literature of Russia\u2019s past; a grinning portrait of human inhumanity; a tribute to art in both its sovereignty and its helplessness; a vision of the past as the future in which the future is now\"., nyrb.com, The Slynx by Tatyana Tolstaya, translated from the Russian by Jamey Gambrell.
