The film received generally positive reviews from critics; it holds an 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, while on Metacritic it holds a 54/100 rating. IndieWire called it a \"solid debut\", while writing that, though it \"isn't fully realized\", it establishes Shephard as \"someone to watch\". Glenn Kenny of The New York Times described the film as \"earnest but underdeveloped\". Filmmaker called the film \"a poignant and incisive examination of modern American adolescence.\" The Hollywood Reporter called it \"a mixed bag of a directorial debut\". == Personal life == Shephard identifies as queer. Since 2015, she has been in a relationship with her Blame co-star Nadia Alexander. ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year ! Title !
