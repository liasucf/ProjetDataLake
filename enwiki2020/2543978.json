In 1617 the Holcombe Pack was taken to Hoghton Tower on the occasion of the King James I visit, when he granted the Royal Warrant to hunt over 12 townships, and the privilege of wearing the scarlet livery of the King. During the evening of 25 September 1916, Holcombe was subjected to one of the first aerial offensives in history. L21, a Zeppelin commanded by Oberleutnant Kurt Frankenburg of the Imperial German Navy, dropped five bombs on the village on its way to Bolton. The post office and village school were damaged, as was the Shoulder of Mutton public house, where villagers took cover in the cellars. Three of the bombs fell close to the church, which suffered some damage to its windows. In the 1980s and 1990s the television series The Krypton Factor used the British Army Rifle Range training course at Holcombe Moor in one of its contestant rounds. ==See also== *Darul Uloom Bury ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * ==External links== *Summerseat Views is a resident's blog which aims to provide a photographic diary of life and the seasons in the village and the surrounding area.
