With a population of 47,700 in 2012, according to Thailand's Thai Consular, they are the 8th largest overseas Thai community and 2nd largest in Southeast Asia. ==History== Golden Mile Complex is home to many Thai restaurants and is also known as Singapore's Little Thailand. During Singapore's construction boom in the 1980s and early 1990s, Thai migrant workers made up the bulk of foreign construction workers in the country. They arrived by bus into Singapore by the thousands from Thailand to work on infrastructure projects around the country. Golden Mile Complex was a common pick up and drop off point for these buses resulting in the emergence of more Thai businesses such as restaurants, tour agencies, Thai newspaper stands around the area and the place was colloquially known by locals as 'Little Thailand'. Today there are lesser Thai construction workers in Singapore as the construction workforce relies more on workers from Bangladesh or India. ==Notable people== *Ben Davis, a Singaporean footballer playing for the Fulham F.C. based in London. *Pornsak Prajakwit, a Thai Chinese actor based in Singapore. *Vanessa-Mae, a British violinist with a Thai father and Singaporean mother. *Vernetta Lopez, a Singaporean actress and DJ. ==See also== *Thai people *Thai diaspora *Singapore\u2013Thailand relations ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in Singapore Category:Thai diaspora in Asia Category:Singaporean people of Thai descent Category:Immigration to Singapore ",
