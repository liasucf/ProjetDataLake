Although he was for a time active in Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA), he later became a prominent Communist Party activist. In October 1936 Snipes was giving a speech in support of equal pay for African- American members of the Meat Cutters union. Sufi Abdul Hamid and Allen McAlpine stabbed Snipes on both arms, resulting in him having ten stitches. Hamid received a twenty-day prison sentence for the act. ==References== Category:1906 births Category:1973 deaths ",
