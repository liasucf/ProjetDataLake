    "text": "Bob is a male given name or a hypocorism, usually of Robert, and sometimes a diminutive of Bobby. It is most common in English speaking countries such as the United States, Canada, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand and some African countries. It most likely originated from the hypocorism Rob, short for Robert. Rhyming names were popular in the Middle Ages, so Richard became Rick, Hick, or Dick, William became Will, Gill, or Bill, and Robert became Rob, Hob, Dob, Nob, or Bob. In 1960 nearly 3,000 babies in the United States were given the name Bob compared to fewer than 50 in 2000. ==Politicians and businessmen== ===A-B=== * Bob Anderson (politician) (born 1939), former member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba * Bob Anthony (born 1948), member of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission * Bob Arum (born 1931), American businessman and lawyer * Bob Asher (born 1937), figure in Republican Pennsylvania politics * Bob Ashley (born 1953), West Virginia State Senator * Bob Avakian (born 1943), American communist politician * Bob Ballinger (born 1974), member of the Arkansas House of Representatives * Bob Barr (born 1948), former U.S. Representative from Georgia * Bob Bartlett (1904\u20131968), U.S. Senator from Alaska * Bob Bennett (politician) (1933\u20132016), U.S. Senator from Utah * Bob Beaumont (1932\u20132011), American automobile businessman * Bob Beauprez (born 1948), former U.S. Representative from Colorado * Bob Beach (born 1959), West Virginia State Senator * Bob Beers (born 1959), politician in Nevada * Bob Benzen (born 1959), Canadian MP * Bob Bergland (1928\u20132018), former United States Secretary of Agriculture and U.S. Representative from Minnesota * Bob Bergren, member of the Montana House of Representatives * Bob Bird (politician) (born 1951), politician in Alaska * Bob Blackman (born 1956), British MP from Harrow East * Bob Bland (born 1982), American activist * Bob Bose (born 1932), former mayor of Surrey, British Columbia * Bob Bowman, former treasurer of Michigan * Bob Brady (born 1945), current U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania * Bob Brown (born 1944), Australian Senator from Tasmania * Bob Brown (Australian Labor politician) (born 1933), Australian MP from Hunter, New South Wales * Bob Brown (Montana politician) (born 1947), former Montana Secretary of State * Bob Bullock (1929\u20131999), Lieutenant Governor of Texas * Bob Burns (born 1938), Arizona Corporation Commissioner ===\u0421=== * Bob Carr (born 1947), former Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs * Bob Carr (born 1943), former member of the U.S. House of Representatives * Bob Carr (Florida politician) (1899\u20131967), mayor of Orlando, Florida * Bob Carruthers (politician), former member of the Nova Scotia House of Assembly * Bob Casey Sr., (1932\u20132000), former Governor of Pennsylvania * Bob R.
