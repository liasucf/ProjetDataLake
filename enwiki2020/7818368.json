    "text": "Louth United F.C. was a football club from Louth, Lincolnshire. They became defunct in 2007 after running into severe financial difficulties. Louth Town F.C. took over the running of all junior sides and no senior teams exist in the name of Louth United. Founded in 1947, from a merger of Louth Nats and Louth Town, they had been members of the Northern Counties East League and the Central Midlands League Premier Division, but in 2007 dropped down to the Lincolnshire League. Louth United were based at their new home, Marshlands, which was developed and opened in 2008. This facility is now boarded up. ==External links== *Sills & Betteridge Solicitors Lincolnshire Football League FA Website Category:Defunct football clubs in England Category:Defunct football clubs in Lincolnshire Category:Association football clubs established in 1947 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2007 Category:1947 establishments in England Category:2007 disestablishments in England Category:Louth, Lincolnshire Category:Central Midlands Football League Category:Northern Counties East Football League ",
