Defense reported the deaths as suicides. Harris said at the time, Harris ordered a full investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), which published its report in a heavily redacted version in August 2008. A report, Death in Camp Delta, was published in December 2009 by the Center for Policy & Research of Seton Hall University School of Law, under the supervision of its director, Professor Mark Denbeaux, attorney for two Guantanamo detainees, criticizing numerous inconsistencies in the official accounts of these deaths.Mark P. Denbeaux Faculty Profile, Seton Hall University School of Law The report suggested there had either been gross negligence or an attempt to cover up homicides of the men, perhaps due to torture under interrogation. On 18 January 2010, Scott Horton of Harper's Magazine published a story suggesting that al-Salami, Al-Utaybi and Al-Zahrani had died as a result of accidental manslaughter during a torture session, and that the official account was a cover-up. Horton had undertaken a joint investigation with NBC News, based on an account by four former guards at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. They suggested that the men had died at a black site, informally called \"Camp No,\" used for interrogation including torture. It was located about a mile outside the regular camp boundaries. ===Director of Operations, U.S. Southern Command=== From June 2007 to April 2008, Harris served as Director of Operations (J3) for U.S. Southern Command in Miami.

He was responsible for early resource sponsor decisions for the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES), Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN), Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) and Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). ===Commander, U.S. Sixth Fleet=== In November 2009, Harris assumed command of the U.S. 6th Fleet and the Striking and Support Forces NATO, both headquartered in Naples, Italy. He concurrently served as Deputy Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe and Deputy Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Africa. In 2011, he was designated as the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander (JFMCC) for Operation Odyssey Dawn, the U.S.-led coalition operation against Libya. ===Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff=== In October 2011, he assumed the position of Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

ADM Harris and his wife visiting the USS Arizona Memorial, with President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump in 2017 In December 2016, Harris led the military commemoration activities for the 75th anniversary of the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Oahu. On 5 December, he paid tribute to Japanese-Americans who served in World War II. He delivered the keynote speech during National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, 7 December, and accompanied President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe to render honors at the USS Arizona Memorial on 27 December. The visit \u2013 the first by a Japanese Prime Minister to the Memorial \u2013 was hailed by President Obama as \"a historic gesture of reconciliation.\" ===U.S. Ambassador to South Korea=== Harris was nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Australia in February 2018, but was renominated to become Ambassador to South Korea by Trump at the suggestion of newly sworn-in Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on May 23, 2018. Harris was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve as Ambassador to South Korea by voice vote on June 28, 2018. On June 29, 2018, Harris was officially sworn in as the new United States Ambassador to South Korea.United States Department of State One of the major issues Harris had to take forward was increasing South Korea's share of the costs for joint security responsibilities, which President Trump wished to see increased from $830 million to about $5 billion annually. Some South Korean activists criticized Harris over his mustache, which they claimed was reminiscent of Japanese-appointed Governors-General (It\u014d Hirobumi) during Japanese rule over Korea. Harris disagreed with the criticisms and suggested they stemmed from his racial heritage. Harris shaved off his mustache in July 2020. In April 2020, Harris was reportedly planning on stepping down as ambassador in the coming months. In late April 2020, Harris tweeted a congratulatory message to the Republic of Korea (ROK) on its delivery of a Global Hawk UAV that the country purchased from the United States through U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS), which is managed and supervised by the Department of State. The tweet received unwarranted criticism from the Korean press citing ROKG authorities\u2019 comments that it was an inappropriate disclosure , despite the purchase and delivery of the Global Hawk program having been part of the public record in both the United States and Republic of Korea since originally approved in 2012 , and the fact that his tweet was previewed with the ROK Ministry of Defense. ==Awards and decorations== {| |align=\"center\"|200px |} {| |colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"| |- |23px23px |21px21px |23px23px |- | |23px23px23px |21px |- | |23px23px23px23px | |- | |18px18px18px | |- | |106px | |- |18px18px | |18px18px18px |- | | | |- | |18px18px18px18px |18px18px18px18px |- |106px |106px |106px |- |106px |106px |106px |- |106px |106px |106px |- |106px |106px |106px |- |colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"|50px |- |colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"|125px |} {|class=wikitable |colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"|Naval Flight Officer insignia |- |colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"|Defense Distinguished Service Medal with one bronze oak leaf cluster |- |Navy Distinguished Service Medal with 2 gold award stars |Defense Superior Service Medal with two bronze oak leaf clusters |Legion of Merit with 2 award stars |- |Bronze Star with 1 award star |Meritorious Service Medal with 3 award stars |Air Medal with bronze Strike/Flight numeral 1 |- |Joint Service Commendation Medal |Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with 4 award stars |Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal |- |Joint Meritorious Unit Award |Navy Unit Commendation with 3 bronze service stars |Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation with 1 service star |- |Navy E Ribbon with 3 Battle \"E\" devices |Department of State Distinguished Honor Award |Navy Expeditionary Medal with 1 service star |- |National Defense Service Medal with 2 service stars |Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal |Southwest Asia Service Medal with 3 service stars |- |Afghanistan Campaign Medal with 1 service star |Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal |Global War on Terrorism Service Medal |- |Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal |Navy Sea Service Deployment Ribbon with 4 service stars |Navy & Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon with 2 silver and 2 bronze service stars |- |Order of National Security Merit, Tong-il Medal (Republic of Korea) |Meritorious Service Medal (Military) (Singapore) |Legion of Honour, Officier Degree (France) |- |Order of the Rising Sun (Japan) |Legion of Honor, Komandante Degree (Philippines) |Medal for International Military Cooperation (Mongolia) |- |Order of Australia (military grade) |Philippine Republic Presidential Unit Citation |Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia) |- |Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait) |Navy Expert Rifleman Medal |Navy Expert Pistol Shot Medal |- |colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"|Command at Sea insignia |- |colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"|United States Pacific Command badge |} * Harris also received the CIA Agency Seal Medal60pxas well as a foreign badge.https://d2v9ipibika81v.cloudfront.net/uploads/sites/82/2016/04/3-3.jpg ===Foreign orders, decorations and medals=== * 80px Order of National Security Merit, Tong-il (1st Class) Medal (South Korea), awarded 3 November 2014 by ROK Chief of Naval Operations Adm.
