The direct insurer KarstadtQuelle Versicherungen was renamed ERGO Direkt Versicherungen, health insurance was consolidated under the trademark DKV, and legal expenses insurance was put under the trademark D.A.S. The trademark ERV will remain in business for travel insurance. The trademarks Victoria and Hamburg-Mannheimer were removed from the market. == History == ERGO Group AG came into being at the end of 1997 by the fusion of Victoria Holding AG and Hamburg-Mannheimer AG; the latter evolved from Hamburg-Mannheimer Versicherungs-AG, the life insurance company of Hamburg- Mannheimer-Gruppe. On December 1, 1997, the shareholders of Victoria Holding AG that was formerly listed on the stock exchange, approved the transfer of the whole property of their companies to ERGO Group AG. Every nominal share of Victoria could be exchanged for ten bearer shares of ERGO. Victoria Holding AG disappeared from the stock exchange after the closure of the transaction on February 2, 1998; its place in MDAX was taken by Ergo Group AG. On April 1, 2001 the majority shareholder M\u00fcnchener R\u00fcck (today Munich Re) announced an exchange offer to the shareholders of ERGO, in the framework of which two shares of ERGO could be exchanged for one share of M\u00fcnchener R\u00fcck plus cash payment of 18 Euros. After the offer had expired in July 2001, the shares of ERGO left the MDAX due to the reduced free float. ERGO Versicherungsgruppe AG was renamed \"ERGO Group AG\" in April 2016. == Share capital == On the balance sheet day December 31, 2006 the share capital of ERGO Group AG totalled \u20ac192,279,504.20, divided in 75,492,117 bearer shares 2.60 \u20ac each.
