Some legends say that Novgorod-Seversky Prince Ihor Sviatoslavych escaped from Polovtsian captivity through our lands, but this legend has no factual evidence. At the time of the creation of the state agricultural enterprise, there were already such farmsteads as Neielovka, Havrylivka, Mykhailivka, Mykolaivka, Nezhurylivka. In 1929 there was founded a state agricultural enterprise Industrialnyi\" . It was formed close to the station Hrakove, as a model enterprise for Ukraine. Its area was 22000 hectares. There was founded a village Named after Balytskyi, which was settled predominantly by repressed people, so, it was a place of prison camps. The farmsteads such as Neielovka, Havrylivka, Mykhailivka, Mykolaivka, Nezhurylivka also became a part of the state agricultural enterprise Industrialnyi\". The largest farmstead was Neielovka, which was 7 km on East from the central manor of the enterprise. According to legend, the farmstead got this name from the first settler, a countryman from the village Zarozhne Neielove. This land was inhabited mostly by farmers from the village Zarozhne since 1924. In 1927, when they created committees of the poor countrymen, there were also chosen a committee of 20 people in Neielove.

A lot of people were grateful to him until death, because during the famine of 1933-34 the villagers were saved from such participation, which was waiting for other people. Balytskyi drafted a contract with the authorities relative to the grain savings of the state agricultural enterprise, but during the repressions Balytsky was transferred first to the Urals by a people's commissar of the NKVD and later he was convicted and sent to a camp. According to legends it is known that he happened to come to the people, repressed by him and he was hanged in the chamber. You can't fail to remember the chief agronomist of the farm, named Tsentylovych K. F. He was the son of the landowner.

It is located near the station Bulatselivka. State agricultural enterprises No. 7 and 5 did not have names, but were numbered, because they belonged to the department of the NKVD. Directors of the state enterprises were appointed by the NKVD and worked a year at most. State enterprises had the most important natural wealth for agriculture, it was powerful black soil with thickness more than one meter. The vegetation was grassy. The prairies were turned up and planted mainly with cereal crops (wheat, barley, corn, oats, peas), and sugar beet. The state agricultural enterprise No. 5 specialized in the breeding of pigs and dairy cattle. Auxiliary branches were vegetable growing, horticulture, apiary. By order of the Government of the Ukrainian SSR, there were sent such machines as tractors \"Fordson\", \"HTZ\" and steam plows for cultivation of the virgin lands. Since 1930, the state enterprise grew: there was built a barn, pigsties, granaries, mechanical workshops, garages and a garage for tractors. Before the war, the farm workers achieved a considerable success in development of agriculture and livestock. In 1936, each feed cow produced 2 600 liters of milk, and in 1939 about 4 360 liters. In 1939 in all-Union agricultural exhibition, the state farm No. 5 was awarded the first-class Diploma, a car and a cash prize of 10 000 karbovanetz. In addition advanced breeders Proskurin I.D., Tsymbalov M.Ye., Kikt'ova H.D., Kryshtal'ova Ye.H., Dubinin K.K., Pivovarov A.I., Vetchynkin A.M., Korzh V.T. were awarded large and small gold and silver medals. Agronomist Tsentylovych K. F. worked a lot on improving crop yields and providing high-grade animal feed. In 1940 there were collected on the average about 16 centners of grain per hectare. The economy of the state enterprise became highly mechanized. during the prewar five-year plans. Using powerful machinery, the enterprise had achieved outstanding success in agriculture and animal husbandry. There was built a drying tower. The first settlers lived in dugouts along the railway. They dug a pit, which was covered with the roof. Then there were built some huts where people lived and many of them already had families. The streets didn't have names, but people gave names to their huts: \"Sakhalin\", \"Kamchatka\", \"Shanghai\", \"Tavern\". In 1932, there was opened an elementary school, which was situated in one room of one of the huts named \"Sakhalin\" . Older students went to Hrakiv school. In 1934, there was built a new two-storey school. There were only three high-rise buildings in the Chuhuiv district, and two of them were located in the central manor of the state enterprise no. 5, it was a school and a farm office. In 1977 it was awarded the status of an urban-type settlement. Historic evidence. The village of Leb\u2019iazhe of the Chuhuiv district in the Kharkiv region was founded by the Chuhuiv governor Adrian Stremouhov, a descendant of Greek Alexander Athanasius Stamatios Stramaukh that in 1462 left Constantinople for the service of the Grand Prince Vasily (Vasily Dark), the village is named as the lake Leb\u2019iazhe, which is located near the settlement. The kind of Stremukhovs was in the service of Russian tsars and lords Lebezhis until the end of the nineteenth century. The last known members of the genus, Vasyl' Pavlovych(1835); and his daughter Anna (1861) were brought in the second part of the noble genealogical book on 31 July 1862. In the late nineteenth century the lands around the village Leb'aazhe were bought by the beetroot \u2013 sugar factories \"Rotermund and Veisse\". In 1899 German entrepreneurs built a sugar factory in the village. Rotermund August Augustovich (born in 1852) became the director. August Augustovich had a wife Marta ( born in 1862) and a daughter Marta (born in 1890) and a son August (born in 1887). Water for the plant's work was taken from the river Siverskyi Donets, pumping it with a steam pumping station. The produced sugar was transported by oxen to the Hrakove station, and from there by train to Germany. Every year a lot of farmers from neighboring Belgorod and Kursk provinces came to the farm to work. According to the accounts of eyewitnesses it is known that every day August Augustovich asked peasants who were working in the fields what they will have for dinner and how to pay them for their work. For better land cultivation an entrepreneur brought two locomotives from Germany which plowed fields. The plant occupied the territory in the village and was enclosed by a high stone fence. There were commercial buildings, repair shops, a shop, warehouses in addition to the factory. Workers barracks and houses were built for the plant`s specialists. The houses were covered with tiles, brought from Germany. One of them has been preserved to the present day. Witnesses told that in 1914 Rotermund A.A. together with his family left for Germany. ==References== \u2022 Weather forecast in uts.
