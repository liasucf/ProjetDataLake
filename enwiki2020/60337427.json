    "text": "The Summer Street Bridge is a retractile drawbridge bridge built in 1899 in Boston, Massachusetts over the Fort Point Channel. It still stands, but the draw was welded shut and the motors removed in 1970. It was the site of a terrible streetcar crash on the night of November 7, 1916. The Summer Street Bridge is one of only four retractile drawbridges left in the US, two of which are in Boston. ==See also== *List of bridges documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in Massachusetts ==References== ==External links== * Category:Bridges completed in 1899 Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Massachusetts Category:Retractable bridges ",
