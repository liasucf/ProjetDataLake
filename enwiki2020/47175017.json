She was also National President of the Australian Local Government Association. She defeated Raelene Telfer once and Bruce Hull twice to hold the position of mayor of Marion. Lewis did not have to contest the position in 2003. The 2010 mayoral election saw sitting Mayor Felicity-ann Lewis against Councillor Raelene Telfer. Lewis ran with the campaign slogan \"Experienced Leadership\", whilst Raelene Telfer went with \"A Full-time Mayor for Marion\", which tried to tap into concerns that Lewis was too occupied with the Local Government Association of SA. Telfer's campaign failed and Lewis was returned for another term. Lewis received 7766 votes to Telfer's 6764. The 2006 mayoral election saw Bruce Hull and Felicity-Ann Lewis against each other for the position for a second time. It had been expected that Lewis would not re- contest but she nominated at the eleventh hour. Former councillor Andrew Cole also ran. Bruce Hull failed once again, gaining 7988 votes to Lewis' 8345 after the distribution of Cole's preferences. At the 2003 Mayoral election Lewis was elected unopposed. == References == Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Women mayors of places in Australia Category:Mayors of places in South Australia Category:Australian of the Year Award winners ",
