    "text": "5 Advanced Ordnance Depot (5 AOD) was a short lived Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps and Royal New Zealand Army Ordnance Corps combined Depot in Singapore 1970 to 1971. ==5 AOD== As a result of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA). 5 AOD was formed by Australia and New Zealand in 1970 to support the Australian and New Zealand Forces remaining in Singapore post the British withdrawal. 5 AOD was set up from scratch in March 1970 and as the first order of business finding working accommodation was a priority. The Singapore authorities were unwilling to provide suitable accommodation in any of the recently vacated British facility\u2019s, so as a temporary measure 5 AOD was housed with the Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC), 3 Base Ordnance Depot (3 BOD) at Alexandria and Keat Hong. Eventually 5 AOD was located at Transit Shed No 4 at the Sembawang Naval Basin on 15 July 1970. In-scaling of stores was achieved by assuming the responsibilities of the Australian Cell of 3 BOD and their existing stocks. Additional stocks were delivered direct from Australia by HMAS Jeparit. By October 1970 5 AOD was functioning as a unit. The Strength of 5 AOD in September 1970 was: *10 Officers *38 Other Ranks *58 Locally Employed Civilians (LECs) New Zealand strength within 5 AOD averaged two Officers and 18 Other Ranks. The Officer Commanding go 5 AOD was: *Major N.W Spencer RAAOC In 1971 the United Kingdom decided that\u2019s its forces were to remain in Singapore and as an economy measure it would be sensible to have a combined UK, Australian and New Zealand Ordnance Depot and as a result 5 AOD ceased to exist on Aug 1971 and its responsibility, personnel and stock absorbed by the new ANZUK Ordnance Depot.
