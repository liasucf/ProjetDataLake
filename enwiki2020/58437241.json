    "text": "The 1982 World Doubles was the first championship of a doubles format which unique to the game of snooker. The championship was sponsored by brewers Hofmeister and 29 players entered the event with the last 16 competing at the National Recreation Centre in Crystal Palace, London. It was played in December with the semi-finals and final televised on ITV between 15 and 19 December 1982. The venue was not popular and in one match between Terry Griffiths and Doug Mountjoy against Kirk Stevens and Jim Wych only had 67 spectators during the first session. Steve Davis and Tony Meo went on to win beating Griffiths and Mountjoy in style 13\u20132 and they got a combined break of 193 in their semi-final with Tony Knowles and Jimmy White which included a single 124 break by Meo. It also gave Davis the first player to have won three versions of world professional titles with the individual, team and doubles (Only Alex Higgins and Stephen Hendry became other players later on to reach that achievement). __TOC__ ==Results== \u00a366,000 prize money \u00a312,000 winners \u00a32000 high break prize 196 Davis/Meo Meo 124 single break ==Earlier Rounds== A pre-qualifying round and qualifying round took place leading up to the first round. ===Pre-qualifying=== {|class=\"wikitable \" |- | Harris/Williamson || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 6\u20131 || Murphy/Hughes |- | Hallett/Cripsey || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 6\u20133 || MacLeod/McLaughlin |- | Bennett/Houlihan || style=\"text-align:center;\"| 6\u20132 || Sinclair/Black |- | F.
