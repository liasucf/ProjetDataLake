    "text": "Boryza was a Persian city in Thrace (Achaemenid satrapy of Skudra) founded by King Darius the Great (522\u2013486 BC). Hecataeus of Miletus (died ) mentioned Boryza as being located in the land of the Thynians on the southwestern Black Sea coast to the north of Byzantium. The city was also mentioned by Stephanus of Byzantium (fl. 6th century AD). According to the modern historian Miroslav Izdimirski, Boryza must have been the residence of a Persian hyparch. Boryza's precise location remains unknown and the date of its foundation is debated; it was either founded before or during Darius's European Scythian campaign. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * ==Further reading== * Category:Achaemenid Thrace Category:Darius the Great Category:Achaemenid cities Category:Populated places in ancient Thrace Category:Lost ancient cities and towns ",
