    "text": "The Fairbanks Ice Dogs are a Tier II Junior A ice hockey team in the North American Hockey League's Midwest Division. The Ice Dogs play home games at the 2,200-seat Big Dipper Ice Arena in Fairbanks, Alaska. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the team plans to temporarily play home games at the Red Baron Arena and Expo in Marshall, Minnesota, for the beginning of the 2020\u201321 season. ==History== Originally started in 1997 in the Tier III Junior B Western States Hockey League (WSHL) as a hockey program to replace the Alaska Gold Kings and give Alaskan players a chance to play after they finished high school and/or midgets. The Ice Dogs won the Northern Division its inaugural season, but lost to the Southern champs the following year in exhibition games. In 1998\u201399 season, they again won the Northern Division but lost to the Southern Division champions, the Ventura Mariners. In 2000, the Ice Dogs became a member of the Tier III Junior B Northern Pacific Hockey League (NorPac) and also played sixteen games in the Tier III Junior A America West Hockey League (AWHL) to help fill out their schedule in the 2000\u201301 season. The team would go on to win the NorPac championship in that season before leaving for the higher level AWHL full-time for the 2001\u201302 season. The Ice Dogs were named the 2001\u201302 AWHL Organization of the Year in their first full Junior A season. The team moved to the NAHL in the AWHL-NAHL merger that took place in 2003. The Ice Dogs were upset in the West Division Finals in the 2008\u201309 season after winning the West Division regular season title. The Ice Dogs lost in the 2010 Robertson Cup final to the Bismarck Bobcats 3\u20130. The following season the Ice Dogs won the Robertson Cup for the first time in a come from behind win over the Michigan Warriors 4\u20132. In the 2013\u201314 season, the Ice Dogs once more won the West Division regular season title (fourth time in six years) and proceeded to win the Robertson Cup for the second time. The Ice Dogs had continued success, leading their division in four of the next five seasons and winning a third Robertson Cup in 2016. They were again the division leaders when the 2019\u201320 season was cancelled midseason due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to travel restrictions in the state of Alaska and the rest of the United States during the pandemic, the Ice Dogs announced they would temporarily relocate to Marshall, Minnesota, for at least the beginning of the 2020\u201321 season. ==Season-by-season records== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
