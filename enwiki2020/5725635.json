During the 2007 season, Walters began playing the midfield position for the Rattlers, as opposed to his usual attack position. Walters was a member of consecutive Steinfeld Cup winning teams with the 2008 Rochester Rattlers and the 2009 Toronto Nationals. He was named Most Valuable Player of the 2008 MLL Championship Weekend. With the suspension of operations of the Hamilton Nationals after the 2013 season and the birth of the expansion Florida Launch for the 2014 season, most of the Nationals players, including Walters, were transferred to the Launch. This eliminated the need for MLL to conduct both a dispersal draft and an expansion draft. Before playing a game for the Launch, Walter was traded along with the 21st overall selection in the 2014 MLL collegiate draft to the Chesapeake Bayhawks in exchange for Casey Powell, the 10th selection in the 2014 MLL collegiate draft and the eighth pick in the 2014 MLL supplemental draft. On November 23rd, 2016 Joe engaged in the new MLL Player Movement Policy and signed with the New York Lizards. http://www.insidelacrosse.com/article/joe-walters-signs-with-the-new-york- lizards/36574 ===National Lacrosse League=== Walters was drafted into the National Lacrosse League by the Buffalo Bandits in the second round of the 2007 Draft.
