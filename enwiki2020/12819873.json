The school offers twelve Master's degree programs and one Doctoral program. ==History== Starting in the early 18th century a series of organizations were formed in Prague with an interest in promoting art and education. Thanks in part to their efforts, the Academy of Fine Arts was founded by Imperial Decree on September 10, 1799. It began with instruction in drawing. The academy was gradually expanded to include programs in architecture, painting, printmaking, and sculpture, among others. In 1990 drastic reforms were undertaken by rector Milan Kn\u00ed\u017e\u00e1k to reorganize the concept and internal structure of the school. By 1991 new media related study programs including film and computer animation were added. ==Today== Today the academy is an accredited university offering an education in modern and historic art. As an exclusively graduate school there are no student accommodation or on-campus eating facilities. International programs are offered in Czech, with a limited number of classes offered in English. ===Departments=== Current departments include: * Painting * Drawing and Printmaking * Sculpture * Intermedia Studies * New Media * Restoration of Artworks * Architecture ==References== Category:Art schools in the Czech Republic Category:1799 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:1799 establishments in the Habsburg Monarchy Category:18th-century establishments in Bohemia Category:Educational institutions established in 1799 Category:Educational institutions in Prague ",
