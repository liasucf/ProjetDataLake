    "text": "Grace Greylock Niles was an American botanist, author, and artist. ==Biography== Born as Grace Stoddard Niles, she attended Pownal schools and later a private school, which might have been in Herkimer, New York. She returned to Pownal to teach school and to pursue a writing career. In 1902, she published The Origin of Plant Names, adopting Greylock as her middle name (from Mount Greylock and Chief Gray Lock). In 1904, she published Bog-trotting for Orchids with her own illustrations. She continued to publish articles on local history and nature. By 1921, her behavior became erratic, and she began harassing her neighbors. She seems to have deliberately burned down her own house. A distant relative summoned the Bennington County sheriff, who drove her to the Brattleboro Retreat. There she was incarcerated and died in 1943. Her body was buried in Pownal in the Oak Hill Cemetery. Her name is honored by the Grace Greylock Niles Trail in the Mountain Meadow Preserve. ==Selected publications== ===Articles=== * * ===Books=== * * ==References== Category:1864 births Category:1943 deaths Category:American women botanists Category:Botanists active in North America Category:People from Pownal, Vermont Category:19th-century American botanists Category:20th-century American botanists Category:19th-century American women writers Category:20th- century American women writers Category:19th-century American writers Category:20th-century American writers Category:Writers from Vermont ",
