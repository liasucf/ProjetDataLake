    "text": "Ian James Rankin (born 28 April 1960) is a Scottish crime writer, best known for his Inspector Rebus novels. ==Early life== Rankin was born in Cardenden, Fife. His father, James, owned a grocery shop, and his mother, Isobel, worked in a school canteen. He was educated at Beath High School, Cowdenbeath. His parents were horrified when he then chose to study literature at university, as they had expected him to study for a trade. Encouraged by his English teacher, he persisted and graduated in 1982 from the University of Edinburgh, where he also worked on a doctorate on Muriel Spark but did not complete it. He has taught at the university and retains an involvement with the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. He lived in Tottenham, London, for four years and then rural France for six while he developed his career as a novelist.Rankin, I. (1998) Tooth & Nail. London: Orion. p. vii. Before becoming a full-time novelist, he worked as a grape picker, swineherd, taxman, alcohol researcher, hi-fi journalist, college secretary and punk musician in a band called the Dancing Pigs.\"Profile: Ian Rankin\", January Magazine\"Ian Rankin\", Bookslut, April 2005. ==Career== Rankin did not set out to be a crime writer. He thought his first novels, Knots and Crosses and Hide and Seek, were mainstream books, more in keeping with the Scottish traditions of Robert Louis Stevenson and even Muriel Spark. He was disconcerted by their classification as genre fiction. The Scottish novelist Allan Massie, who tutored Rankin while Massie was writer-in-residence at the University of Edinburgh, reassured him by saying, \"Do you think John Buchan ever worried about whether he was writing literature or not?\" Rankin's Inspector Rebus novels are set mainly in Edinburgh. They are considered major contributions to the tartan noir genre. Thirteen of the novels - plus one short story - were adapted as a television series on ITV, starring John Hannah as Rebus in series 1 and 2 (4 episodes) and Ken Stott in that role in series 3\u20135 (10 episodes). In 2009, Rankin donated the short story \"Fieldwork\" to Oxfam's Ox-Tales project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Rankin's story was published in the Earth collection. Rankin signing copies of his debut graphic novel, Dark Entries, in the Edinburgh Forbidden Planet International store in December 2009. In 2009 Rankin stated on Radio Five Live that he would start work on a five- or six-issue run on the comic book Hellblazer, although he may turn the story into a stand-alone graphic novel instead. The Vertigo Comics panel at WonderCon 2009 confirmed that the story would be published as a graphic novel, Dark Entries, the second release from the company's Vertigo Crime imprint. In 2013, Rankin co-wrote the play Dark Road with Mark Thomson, the artistic director of the Royal Lyceum Theatre. The play, which marked Rankin's play-writing debut, premiered at the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, in September 2013. ==Documentaries== Rankin is a regular contributor to the BBC Two arts programme Newsnight Review. His 3-part documentary series on the subject of evil was broadcast on Channel 4 in December 2002. In 2005 he presented a 30-minute documentary on BBC Four called Rankin on the Staircase, in which he investigated the relationship between real-life cases and crime fiction. It was loosely based on the Michael Peterson murder case, as covered in Jean-Xavier Lestrade's documentary series Death on the Staircase. The same year he collaborated with folk musician Jackie Leven on the album Jackie Leven Said. In 2007, Rankin appeared in programmes for BBC Four exploring the origins of his alter-ego character, John Rebus. Titled \"Ian Rankin's Hidden Edinburgh\" and \"Ian Rankin Investigates Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,\" Rankin looks at the origins of the character and the events that led to his creation. In the TV show Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations, he takes a trip through Edinburgh with writer/cook Anthony Bourdain. == Music == Rankin is the singer in the six-piece band Best Picture, formed by journalists Kenny Farquharson (The Times) and Euan McColl (The Scotsman) in 2017, and featuring Bobby Bluebell on guitar. They released a single \"Isabelle\" on Oriel Records in October 2017. They made their live debut at the Kendal Calling music festival on 28 July 2018. ==Personal life== He lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Miranda (n\u00e9e Harvey), whom he met at university and married in 1986, and their two sons: John Morgan \"Jack\" Harvey-Rankin (born 1992) and Christopher Connor \"Kit\" Harvey-Rankin (born 1994). They lived for a number of years in the Merchiston/Morningside area, near the authors JK Rowling, Alexander McCall Smith and Kate Atkinson, before moving to a penthouse flat in the former Edinburgh Royal Infirmary building in Quartermile in Lauriston. The couple also own a house in Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands. Rankin appears as a character in McCall Smith's 2004 novel, 44 Scotland Street. In 2011 a group of ten book sculptures were deposited around Edinburgh as gifts to cultural institutions and the people of the city. Many of the sculptures made reference to the work of Rankin, and an eleventh sculpture was a personal gift to him. In 2019, Rankin donated his personal archives to the National Library of Scotland after moving to his flat in the Quartermile. The Library is planning an exhibition for 2021 of highlights from the archive, which includes research notes, newspaper clippings and manuscripts. ==Awards and honours== *1988 Elected Hawthornden Fellow *1991 Chandler-Fulbright Award *1994 CWA Short Story Dagger for A Deep Hole *1996 CWA Short Story Dagger for Herbert in Motion in Perfectly Criminal *1997 CWA Gold Dagger for Fiction for Black and Blue *1997 Edgar Award for best novel, shortlist, Black and Blue *1999 University of Abertay Dundee honorary doctorate *2000 University of St Andrews honorary doctorate *2000 Palle Rosencrantz Prize (Denmark) *2002 Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to literature *2003 University of Edinburgh honorary doctorate *2003 Whodunnit Prize (Finland) *2003 Grand Prix du Roman Noir (France) *2004 Edgar Award for Resurrection Men *2005 CWA Lifetime Achievement Award (Cartier Diamond Dagger) *2005 Open University honorary doctorate *2005 Grand Prix de Litt\u00e9rature Polici\u00e8re (France) for Set in Darkness Guide des Prix litt\u00e9raires, online ed.
