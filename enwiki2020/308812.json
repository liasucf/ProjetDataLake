    "text": "Federal Communications Commission v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court that defined the power of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over indecent material as applied to broadcasting.. == Facts == On October 30, 1973, FM radio station WBAI in New York City aired a broadcast that included a segment which featured the George Carlin routine \"Filthy Words\" as part of a program about societal attitudes toward language. A few weeks later, John Douglas (an active member of Morality in Media) stated in a complaint filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that he heard the broadcast while he was driving with his 15-year-old son. He also stated the material was inappropriate for the time of day (approximately 2:00 p.m.). In response, Pacifica received a letter of reprimand from the FCC, censuring them for allegedly violating broadcast regulations which prohibited airing indecent material. In reference to this case, a poster in a WBAI broadcast booth warns radio broadcasters against using the seven dirty words. == Holding == The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the FCC's actions in 1978, by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was \"indecent but not obscene\". The Court recognized the government had strong interests in: * Shielding children from potentially offensive material, and * Ensuring that unwanted speech does not intrude on the privacy of one's home. The Pacifica Court upheld the FCC's power to regulate broadcast media, citing two pervading governmental interests. First, the \u201cuniquely pervasive\u201d nature of these broadcasts allows them to seep into \u201cthe privacy of the home\u201d without the consent of the viewer. Second, broadcasts are \u201cuniquely accessible to children\u201d whose \u201cvocabulary [could be enlarged] in an instant\u201d by hearing indecent or profane language. The Court held that these two concerns were sufficient to \u201cjustify special treatment of indecent broadcasting,\u201d thereby allowing the FCC to fine broadcasters for airing inappropriate content. The Court stated that the FCC had the authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience, and gave the FCC broad leeway to determine what constituted indecency in different contexts. == Impact == At first, despite the resounding win in Pacifica, the FCC used its new regulatory powers sparingly.Alexander J. Lindvall, Frankly, My Dear, I Don't Give a *Darn*\u2014An Argument Against Censoring Broadcast Media, 7 Ariz. St. Sports & Ent. L.J. 153, 170 (2017). In the 1990s, however, the FCC ramped up sanctions for indecent broadcasts. By the early 2000s, the FCC began to levy more sanctions with higher dollar amounts\u2014with fines of up to $500,000 for some offenses.Alexander J. Lindvall, Frankly, My Dear, I Don't Give a *Darn*\u2014An Argument Against Censoring Broadcast Media, 7 Ariz. St. Sports & Ent. L.J. 153, 171 (2017). In 1997, Pacifica Radio \"Living Room\" host Larry Bensky prefaced an interview with Carlin by saying: \"George Carlin, you're a very unusual guest for Pacifica Radio. You're probably the only person in the United States that we don't have to give The Carlin Warning to about which words you can't say on this program, because it's named after you.\" In 1996, Congress passed the Communications Decency Act, which criminalized the knowing transmission of \"obscene or indecent\" messages to underage people on the Internet. In Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union (1997), the American Civil Liberties Union claimed that the act violated First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech for adult Internet users. To attain standing, the ACLU published the Supreme Court's opinion on F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation on its website, which included a transcript of Carlin's monologue. At least one scholar has argued that modern self-censoring technology\u2014e.g., the V-chip\u2014has significantly undermined the Supreme Court's rationale in Pacifica.Alexander J.
