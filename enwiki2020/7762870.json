    "text": "James Harle Johnston (December 10, 1889 \u2013 February 14, 1967) was a Major League Baseball player from 1911 to 1926. He played mostly with the Brooklyn Robins of the National League. ==Career== Johnston, who batted and threw right-handed, made his major-league debut on May 3, 1911, with the Chicago White Sox, which was his only appearance that season. He did not return to the majors until 1914, when he played 50 games with the Chicago Cubs. From 1916 through 1925 he was with the Brooklyn Robins (who later became the Brooklyn Dodgers). He finished up his career the following year, playing for the Boston Braves and the New York Giants. His final major league game was on September 11, 1926. Overall, Johnston played all or part of 13 seasons in the major leagues, ten with the Brooklyn Robins. He appeared in two World Series, both Brooklyn losses. In the 1916 World Series he started two of the games, batting in the lead-off position. In the 1920 World Series, he appeared in four of the games, mostly batting second except for batting sixth in one of the games. On May 25, 1922, Johnston hit for the cycle as a member of the Brooklyn Robins in an 8\u20137 win over the Philadelphia Phillies at the Baker Bowl. During his major league career, Johnston played 448 games at third base, 354 in the outfield, 243 at second, 178 at shortstop, and 49 at first base. He had a .294 lifetime batting average, hitting in the .270 to .280 range near the end of the dead- ball era and going over .300 once the live-ball era started. He stole 169 bases in his major league career, mostly from 1916 to 1923. He had little power, except in 1921 when he had 41 doubles and 14 triples. All of his managers became Hall of Famers; Hugh Duffy with the White Sox, Hank O'Day with the Cubs, Wilbert Robinson with Brooklyn, Dave Bancroft with the Braves, and John McGraw with the Giants. After his playing career ended, Johnston coached first base for Brooklyn in 1931. He died in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in 1967. ==Family== Johnston married Nora Belle Jones (1888\u20131974) in 1910; the couple had five children. Johnston's brother Doc Johnston was also a major league player. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball players to hit for the cycle * List of Major League Baseball career stolen bases leaders ==References== * ==External links== , or Retrosheet * Category:1889 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Major League Baseball infielders Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Brooklyn Robins players Category:New York Giants (NL) players Category:Boston Braves players Category:Baseball players from Tennessee Category:Brooklyn Dodgers coaches Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Kewanee Boilermakers players Category:Ottumwa Packers players Category:Birmingham Barons players Category:San Francisco Seals (baseball) players Category:Oakland Oaks (baseball) players Category:Chattanooga Lookouts players Category:Chattanooga Lookouts managers Category:Atlanta Crackers players Category:Montgomery Capitals players Category:People from Cleveland, Tennessee ",
