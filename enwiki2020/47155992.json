    "text": "606 Films is a motion picture production company founded by Oscar-winning actress Halle Berry, and inspired by the California Senate Bill that put limits on paparazzi and their photography of children of celebrities. The bill was signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. The production company was co-founded by Elaine Goldsmith Thomas who repped for Julia Roberts at ICM Partners and later she went on to run Revolution Studios founded by Joe Roth. The foundation of the company stems from Halle Berry's role in the CBS science- fiction drama Extant (TV series) and the company will be housed on the production lot at CBS. ==Films in production== Kidnap Directed by - Luis Prieto Written by - Knate Gwaltney Starring - Halle Berry Christopher Berry Lew Temple Mother (In production, 2015) Directed by - TBA Written by - Pablo Fenjves ==List of films== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
