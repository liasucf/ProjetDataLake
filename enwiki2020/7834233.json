At the time of opening, the station was the terminus of the Shinkeihan Railway, a former operator of the Hankyu Kyoto Line. On March 31, 1931, when the underground extension from Saiin to Keihan Kyoto Station (present-day \u014cmiya Station) was completed, the station was moved from the ground level to the underground facilities and renamed Saiin Station. At the time of the construction, a plan was tabled to link Saiin Station with the smaller and older Sai Station (located one-minute walking distance east on Shijo street) by means of an underground path, but the plan was eventually scrapped, due to strong opposition from people living in the area. The underground path was under construction until 2017. ==Usage== In fiscal 2015, the Hankyu station was used by 16,087,000 passengers annually (both exiting and entering passengers).
