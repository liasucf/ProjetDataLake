    "text": "AOL Explorer, previously known as AOL Browser, is a discontinued graphical web browser based on the Microsoft Trident layout engine and was released by AOL. In July 2005, AOL launched AOL Explorer as a free download and as an optional download with AIM version 5.9. AOL Explorer supported tabbed browsing. ==Release history== In November 2005, the next version, 1.2, was released. Version 1.2 was very similar to version 1.1, but included two new features: Tab Explorer and RSS Widgets from Favorites. When the Tab Explorer button is pressed, a thumbnail preview of each tab is displayed in a full-screen window. The user can click on one of the previews to instantly access the page. Microsoft has implemented a similar feature in their Internet Explorer 7 browser, called \"Quick Tabs\". Version 1.5 was launched in May 2006, and included many new features such as Desktop Widgets, Visual Themes, a Feeds Screensaver and various performance improvements. Desktop Widgets allow the user to \"tear off\" a side panel and use it independently from the browser. The panel will remain open and functional, even after one closes AOL Explorer. When ones computer is idle, one can set the AOL Explorer Feeds Screensaver to display the RSS feeds stored in the feeds panel. Another feature new to 1.5 is the Show Page Preview feature, which allows the user to preview a webpage without leaving the current page by simply holding down Ctrl and right- clicking on a link. This feature is especially useful when there are a large number of links on a page, or when searching. In 2003, AOL signed a seven-year contract with Microsoft to use the Trident layout engine in their products and as such AOL Explorer uses this engine. Because of this, users can use AOL Explorer to download and install updates from Microsoft Update. However, unlike Internet Explorer, AOL does not use Bing as the default search engine. AOL is also the owner of Netscape Communications Corporation which had previously published the now defunct Netscape series of browsers. AOL Explorer was available as an independent download or packaged with AIM Triton. AOL Explorer 1.5 was the last recorded version of AOL Explorer. The browser was succeeded by AOL OpenRide, which in turn was succeeded by AOL Desktop. ==Reception== AOL Explorer received a 4 out of 5 from PC Magazine in 2005, which said, \"Even Firefox devotees should consider taking AOL's spiffy, feature-packed browser for a spin.\" However, the same article also contained some criticisms: \"Questionable anti-spyware tools. Some features not yet working. Can't import favorites from Mozilla Firefox or Opera. Doesn't support Internet Explorer toolbars. ==See also== * List of web browsers * Comparison of web browsers * List of feed aggregators * Comparison of feed aggregators == References == ==External links== *AOL Explorer Information on the AOL download site Explorer Category:Internet Explorer shells Category:News aggregator software Category:Windows web browsers Category:Discontinued web browsers Category:2005 software ",
