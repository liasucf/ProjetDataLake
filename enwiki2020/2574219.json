Despite having no experience with business or innovation, she decided to create a cup to simulate breastfeeding. This is when the Haberman Feeder came to be, a special bottle for infants with sucking difficulties. She originally went to companies, but none were interested, forcing her to commercialize the product by herself.Global, C. P. A. (n.d.). World-changing Women Innovators: Mandy Haberman.

Sometimes you just have to be brave and go with your gut instinct.\u201d[3] This risk paid off, as for 30 years, the Haberman Feeder has been recommended by medical professionals, and is widely used in hospitals throughout the world. Her second invention, the Anywayup Cup, came to be ten years later after she observed a pain point in baby bottles first hand when a toddler spilled juice all over her friend's carpet.[1] It was the first sippy cup to seal between sips and her most successful invention to date. This invention is available on the commercial market, selling 10 million cups per year. The Anywayup Cup has received numerous awards,\"BFIIN Awards 2000\".

Despite having to go against larger and much more powerful companies, she came out successful.[1] All of her success has led to various appointments.
