He was elected to represent the town in the Connecticut General Assembly in 1860, and in the same year removed to Norwich, where he opened a law office, and resided in the practice of his profession until his death In 1864, '65, and '69, he represented Norwich in the General Assembly, and in that capacity was the author of several important measures. Meantime he rose steadily in his profession, and in the city where he was best known was more extensively employed and trusted than any practitioner of his years. He was for some years City Attorney, and was Yale Corporation Counsel at the time of his death.
