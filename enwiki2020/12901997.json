    "text": "Kakrapar Atomic Power Station is a nuclear power station in India, which lies in the proximity of Surat and Tapi river in the state of Gujarat. ==Phase I== Phase I consists of two 220 MW pressurised water reactor with heavy water as moderator (PHWR). KAPS-1 went critical on 3 September 1992 and began commercial electricity production a few months later on 6 May 1993. KAPS-2 went critical on 8 January 1995 and began commercial production on 1 September 1995. In January 2003, CANDU Owners Group (COG) declared KAPS as the best performing pressurised heavy water reactor. KAPS-2 was shut down after a coolant channel leak in July 2015 and a similar issue forced the shutdown of KAPS-1 in March 2016. After a replacement of coolant channels and feeder tubes, KAPS-2 attained criticality in September 2018. Maintenance on KAPS-1 was completed ahead of schedule and was brought to operation on 19 May 2019. The construction costs were originally estimated to be \u20b9382.52 crore; the plant was finally finished at a price of \u20b91,335 crore. ==Phase II== In 2007 the Indian government approved outline plans to build two indigenously- designed IPHWR-700 reactors, with two sister reactors a little later at Rajasthan Atomic Power Station. In 2009 approval was confirmed, and site preparation was completed by August 2010. First concrete for Kakrapar 3 and 4 was in November 2010 and March 2011 respectively with operation originally expected by early and late 2018 respectively. The project over-ran largely due to tuning of the IPHWR-700 design and slow delivery of supplies. Operation is now expected by October 2020 and September 2021 respectively. Unit 3 achieved first criticality on 22 July 2020. == Units == {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Unit !! Type !! Gross MW !! Construction start !! Operation start !!

In response, poisons were added to the system and the reactor was shut off. * On 22 August 2006 it was reported by village inhabitants the area around the power station had been penetrated. A search by the police did not result in any findings. * On 11 March 2016, KAPS-1 automatically shut down due to a leak of heavy coolant water, leaving both reactors non-operational. The leak was plugged ten days later. Corrosion and cracks were found on the coolant channel and similar corrosion spots were found in KAPS-2 which had been non-operational since July 2015 after a coolant channel leak. KAPS-2 attained criticality on 17 September 2018 after a replacement of its coolant channels and feeder tubes. KAPS-1 became operational ahead of schedule on 19 May 2019 == See also == * Nuclear power in India * List of nuclear reactors#India == References == == External links == * Category:Nuclear power stations in Gujarat Category:Nuclear power stations with reactors under construction ",
