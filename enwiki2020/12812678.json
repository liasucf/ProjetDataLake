    "text": "\"I Go Wild\" is a song by The Rolling Stones featured on their 1994 album Voodoo Lounge. Credited to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, \"I Go Wild\" is largely a Jagger composition. On its creation, Jagger said in 1994, \"'I Go Wild', I suppose, is the one I play (guitar) on most. I mean, I just created it on guitar with Charlie [Watts], as a groove. And we more or less had the whole song down before we took it to anyone else.\" On the song overall, Jagger said, \" I like that song. I really got into the lyrics on that one. One of the wordy ones.\" A straightforward rock song, \"I Go Wild\"'s lyrics tell of the singer's relationship with an unnamed \"femme fatale\"; \"I Go Wild\" was recorded between the months of July and August and November and December 1993 at Sandymount Studios, Ireland and A&M; Recording Studios, Los Angeles. With Jagger on lead vocals, Richards and Ron Wood accompany him on electric guitars. Charlie Watts performs drums while Darryl Jones performs bass. Chuck Leavell performs the song's organ while Phil Jones incorporate percussion. Jagger, Richards, Bernard Fowler, and Ivan Neville perform backing vocals.\"I Go Wild\". Keno's Rolling Stones Lyric Page. 2007. (accessed 17 August 2007). \"I Go Wild\" was released as the fourth and final single from Voodoo Lounge. Following its UK release on 3 July 1995, it reached number 29 on the UK singles chart. A video was shot at Ex-templo de San L\u00e1zaro in Mexico City immediately before the Stones' fourteen stadium tour of South America. The song was performed throughout the 1994-1995 Voodoo Lounge Tour; a live version from 1994 appeared on the maxi-single, and a 1995 live performance was released in 2016 on Totally Stripped. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1995) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australia (ARIA) |style=\"text-align:center;\"|57 |- | |- | |- | |- | |} ==References== Category:1995 singles Category:The Rolling Stones songs Category:1994 songs Category:Songs written by Jagger/Richards Category:Song recordings produced by Don Was Category:Song recordings produced by Jagger\u2013Richards Category:Music videos directed by Kevin Kerslake ",
