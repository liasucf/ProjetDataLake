    "text": "Mathers's The Goetia corresponds to Pruflas's illustration from the Dictionnaire Infernal. In demonology, Purson is a Great King of Hell, being served and obeyed by twenty-two legions of demons. He knows of hidden things, can find treasures, and tells past, present, and future. Taking a human or aerial body he answers truly of all secret and divine things of Earth and the creation of the world. He also brings good familiars. Purson is depicted as a man with a lion's head, carrying a ferocious viper in his hand, and riding a bear. Before him there can be heard many trumpets sounding. Other spellings: Curson, Pursan. ==See also== *The Lesser Key of Solomon * Purson (band) ==Sources== *S. L. MacGregor Mathers, A.
