    "text": "The Manhattan Transfer is the second album by The Manhattan Transfer. However, it is the first of four albums to be released by the lineup of Tim Hauser, Laurel Mass\u00e9, Alan Paul, and Janis Siegel, and the first to establish the sound and style for which the group would become known. It was released on April 2, 1975 by Atlantic Records and was produced by Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn and Tim Hauser. This incarnation of the group had been together for three years before this album was released. Erteg\u00fcn, founder and chairman of Atlantic, attended one of their performances at the New York City cabaret Reno Sweeney. He offered them a contract, which they accepted. == Reviews == Shaun Considine reviewed the album in May 1975 for The New York Times: :\"Vocally, The Manhattan Transfer is one of the slickest group's on today's market. Their intro number, \"Tuxedo Junction\", is a precise recreation of the 1940 Glenn Miller oldie, with the group's four part vocal harmonies and jazz riffs supplanting the Miller instrumentals. They have done their homework; they have studied their old 78s in detail. In the honors section, \"Blue Champagne\", a Dorsey beauty, and \"Candy\" evoke all of the magic and hazy charm of the 30s and 40s.\" == Charts == The Manhattan Transfer debuted on Billboard's Top Pop album chart on May 3, 1975, reaching #33.The Manhattan Transfer: Billboard Albums The single \"Operator\" went to #22 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart.The Manhattan Transfer: Billboard Singles \"Tuxedo Junction\" reached #24 on the British pop charts. == Track listing == # \"Tuxedo Junction\" (Erskine Hawkins, William Johnson, Buddy Feyne, Julian Dash) - 3:01Atlantic Album, 1975, SD 18133, (entered by Joe Cox on 14Nov2010, Stumpjumper27695) # \"Sweet Talking Guy\" (Doug Morris, Elliot Greenberg) - 2:25Atlantic Album, 1975, SD 18133 # \"Operator\" (William Spivery) - 3:09Atlantic Album, 1975, SD 18133 (derived from \"Operator, Operator\" by Sister Wynona Carr) # \"Candy\" (Mack David, Joan Whitney, Alex Kramer) - 3:26Atlantic Album, 1975, SD 18133 # \"Gloria\" (Esther Navarro) - 2:57Atlantic Album, 1975, SD 18133 # \"Clap Your Hands\" (Ira Newborn, The Manhattan Transfer) - 2:55Atlantic Album, 1975, SD 18133 # \"That Cat Is High\" (J.
