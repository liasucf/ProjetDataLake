    "text": "Valentin-Yves Mudimbe (born 8 December 1941, Jadotville, Belgian Congo) is a Congolese philosopher, professor, and author of poems, novels, as well as books and articles on African culture and intellectual history. ==Early life and career== He was born in the Belgian Congo, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. As a young man, he joined a monastery, but left in 1962 in order to study the forces that shaped African history. He studied in Louvain (PhD, 1970), came back to Congo and flew to the United States in 1979 for political reasons. He has taught at Haverford College and Stanford University, and is now Professor Emeritus in the Program in Literature at Duke University. His work has had a major impact on many disciplines including Philosophy, Sociology, Anthropology, Linguistics, Literature, and History. ==Work== He is generally considered to be the Edward Sa\u00efd of African studies, notably for his major book The Invention of Africa (1988), a work widely regarded to be as significant to the field of African studies as Sa\u00efd's Orientalism (1978) has been to postcolonial studies . A considerable body of work has been devoted to Mudimbe's publications. Mudimbe focuses most closely on phenomenology, structuralism, mythical narratives, and the practice and use of language. As a professor, he has taught courses on these topics, as well as on ancient Greek cultural geography. ==Education== *Junior College Degree, Lovanium University, Leopoldville (Kinshasa), Congo (1962) *Diploma, Lovanium University, Kinshasa, Congo (1964) *BA, Lovanium University, Kinshasa (1966) *Graduate Studies, University of Paris (1968) *PhD with High Honors, Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium (1970) ==Books== ;Novels *D\u00e9chirures (1971) *Entre les eaux (1973); trans. as Between Tides by Stephen Baker (1991) *Entretailles (1973) *L'Autre Face du royaume (1973) *Les Fuseaux (1974) *Le Bel immonde (1976); trans. as Before the Birth of the Moon by Marjolijn de Jager (1989) *L'Ecart (1979); trans. as The Rift by Marjolijn de Jager (1993) *Shaba deux (1988) *Les Corps glorieux des mots et des \u00eatres (1994) ;Essays *L'Odeur du p\u00e8re, Pr\u00e9sence Africaine (1982) *The Invention of Africa : Gnosis, Philosophy and the Order of Knowledge, Indiana University Press (1988) *Parables and Fables : Exegesis Textuality and Politics in Central Africa, The University of Wisconsin Press (1991) *The Surreptitious Speech: Presence Africaine and the Politics of Otherness 1947-1987, University of Chicago Press (1992) *Africa & the Disciplines, coeditor, University of Chicago Press (1993) *The Idea of Africa, African Systems of Thought, Indiana University Press, (1994) *Tales of Faith: Religion as Political Performance in Central Africa, Athlone Press (1997) *Nations, Identities, Cultures, editor, Duke University Press (1997) *Diaspora and Immigration, coeditor, South Atlantic Quarterly special issue, Duke University Press (1999) *The Normal & Its Orders, coeditor, Editions Mala\u00efka (2007) *On African Fault Lines: Meditations on Alterity Politics, University of KwaZulu-Natal Press (2013) ==On Mudimbe's work== ;In English *White fathers in colonial central Africa : a critical examination of V.Y.
