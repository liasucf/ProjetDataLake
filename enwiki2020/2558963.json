    "text": "The Baptist Collegiate Network (BCN) is a college-level organization that can be found on many college campuses in the United States and Canada. ==Organizations== These ministries are groups of students, faculty members and staff who are seeking to grow in their faith and to reach the world. Nationally, these groups are predominantly composed of Baptists and Southern Baptists, but are also open to people of other Christian denominations, as well as those who profess other religious ties or who profess none at all. In some areas of the country, however, there are more participants from other backgrounds than from the Baptist traditions. The BCN is supervised by state- level Baptist organizations (known as conventions), which is why they possess the Baptist moniker. In areas where the state convention is financially strong, the BCN. is usually financially sponsored by that convention. In other areas of the country, the ministry staff raise their own financial support for their salaries and the programs they operate. Regardless of funding, BSU/BCM/etc is geared toward reaching out to their campus communities in service and in love for the cause of Christ. Most BCN groups have some set meeting place on their campus, although some have separate property on or near campus that is easily accessible to all students. Besides hosting events they sponsor themselves, these organizations are known to host campus- and student- led events as a part of their outreach including bible studies, retreats and mission trips. == External links == *Official Website Category:Baptist organizations Category:Student religious organizations in the United States Category:Student religious organizations in Canada Category:Fellowships ",
