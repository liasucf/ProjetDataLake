    "text": "The Mourning After is the third studio album by the American metal band 40 Below Summer. The album was released on October 28, 2003 via Razor & Tie Records. Two singles were released from the album in \"Self Medicate\" and \"Taxi Cab Confession\". During promotion of the album, 40 Below Summer appeared on Headbangers Ball, and the video for \"Self Medicate\" found significant airplay and the song was featured on the soundtrack for the thriller film The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. This video features the group performing the song in a city park as well as various acts of indulgent \"self medication\" by townspeople (i.e. secretively buying pornography, gorging on food, making out). The following year, MTV2 held a fan's choice poll for the Best Metal Videos of 2004.Vote For The Best Metal Videos Of 2004 MetalUnderground.com (December 7, 2004). Retrieved December 8, 2007. The results aired on the December 25 edition of Headbangers Ball with \"Self Medicate\" ranking in at #18. The CD is Content/Copy-Protected with MediaMax Digital Rights Management Software on it. == Musical style == Joey D'amico, who played guitar on the album, stated \"Before, we wanted to be really heavy, but we so wanted the music to be melodic, so we'd slap those parts right next to each other. Now we learned how to meld them together to create a sound.\" == Reception == John D. Luerssen of Allmusic gave the album three stars. He noted its more melodic approach, writing \"while the band's forceful attack still won't land it in the pop survey, Bendeth's input does manage to give the band a foot up on other alternative metal acts in the run for airplay in the \"active rock\" format.\" Luerssen also criticized the track \"Breathless\", stating that it \"finds the outfit capably shifting into pop ballad mode \u00e0 la Creed.\" He goes on to write \"That momentary lapse in direction is soon corrected, however, and as The Mourning After unfolds, tracks like the cathartic \"F.E.\" and the spooky \"A Season in Hell\" right the wrongs for 40 Below Summer's ballooning headbanger clientele.\" == Track listing == * Track 10 contains the hidden track, \"The Day I Died\" beginning at 11:58. == Personnel == ===40 Below Summer=== * Max Illidge \u2013 vocals * Joey D'Amico \u2013 guitar * Jordan Plingos \u2013 guitar * Hector Graziani \u2013 bass * Carlos Aguilar \u2013 drums, piano ===Additional Musicians=== * Christian Machado \u2013 vocals on \"F.E.\" ===Production=== * David Bendeth \u2013 production, mixing * UE Nastasi \u2013 mastering * Dan Korneff \u2013 engineering, mixing on \"Monday Song\" * John Bender \u2013 engineering * Nick Cohen \u2013 engineering * Amy V.
