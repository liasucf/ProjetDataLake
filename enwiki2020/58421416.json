Lyrically, the song pays homage to female artists and hit songs from the 1990s, a \"decade of female superstars\" that Alaina (who was born in 1994) looks back on fondly for its abundance of women on the radio that inspired her to become a singer.

I Feel Like a Woman!\", while also name-dropping songs from other genres, such as Britney Spears' \"...Baby One More Time\", Spice Girls' \"Wannabe\", and TLC's \"No Scrubs\". ==Music video== The music video for \"Ladies in the '90s\" premiered on May 29, 2019, and features Alaina acting as a QVC spokesperson displaying popular products of the 1990s.
