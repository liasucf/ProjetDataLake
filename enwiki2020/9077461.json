The name Tor\u0146akalns (eng.:Tower Hill) derives from a fortified tower built in the Middle Ages close to the Daugava River to alarm the city of Riga in case of emergency and unwelcomed intruders about to cross the river.Tor\u0146akalns page on citariga.lv (English version) The tower does not stand nowadays. ==Overview== Tor\u0146akalns was an early suburb to Riga, consisting largely of gardens and mansions. In contrast to the Soviet-built Zolit\u016bde and Ziepniekkalns suburbs, there are plenty of gardens, parks, and monuments. M\u0101rupes parks (eng.:Mary's Creek Park) encircles the M\u0101ras di\u0137is (eng.:Mary's Pond), which was once dammed by a mill. The M\u0101rupe (eng.:Mary's Creek) then continues into Ark\u0101dijas parks (eng.:Arcadian Park), where early 20th century landscaping provides an oasis from the city.Kadinsky, Sergey \"M\u0101rup\u012bte, Riga: Part One\" Hidden Waters Blog November 25, 2016 ==History== In 1940, the Soviet Union annexed Latvia and began mass deportations of Latvians who were deemed to be political and social threats to the new communist government. Because Tor\u0146akalns contained a number of affluent residents, these deportations took place at the Tor\u0146akalns railway station. Many of the mansions were confiscated, with some being divided into smaller units, and others turned to public use, including kindergartens and clinics. During World War II, the railway service between Riga and Tor\u0146akalns was suspended, following the destruction of the original railway trestle over the Daugava. Following the war, the neighborhood experienced an influx of non-Latvian Soviet citizens, reducing the ethnic Latvian percentage of the population. In the postwar development, the railway was electrified, streetcar service was expanded, factories and a military arsenal provided jobs in the neighborhood. Following the restoration of Latvian independence in 1991, many non-Latvians left the country, and Soviet-era street names were removed. A boxcar was installed at the Tor\u0146akalns station as a memorial to the Stalinist deportations. At the same time, a Soviet victory monument on the neighborhood's northern edge remained. Today, it remains a focal symbol for the city's Russian community. The main shopping venues for local residents include the \u0100genskalns tirgus (eng.:Agenskalns Market) and Vienibas Gatve. In spite of initial economic uncertainty following independence, the neighborhood has since regained its status as a garden suburb within minutes of Old Riga. Most Tor\u0146akalns residents commute to the central business district by the electric railway, which contains a large station and railyard in the neighborhood. ==References== == Gallery == Latvijas Universit\u0101tes Akad\u0113miskais centrs.jpg|The new campus of the University of Latvia in Jelgavas iela Tor\u0146akalns.jpg|Tor\u0146akalns, railway station RigaKonradaIela.jpg|Konr\u0101da street in Tor\u0146akalns Arkadijas parks - panoramio (4).jpg|Ark\u0101dija park Tornakalns Lutheran church - panoramio.jpg|Church of Luther in Tor\u0146akalns. ==External links== * Tor\u0146akalns official website Category:Neighbourhoods in Riga ",
