After hearing that the Bavarian State Police were creating a motorcycle section, at the age of 19 years Meier applied to join and was accepted in 1929. A trainee period of three years had to be completed before Meier was able to transfer to the motorcycle police section in 1932.Classic Racer no 78 - pp 70 Mortons Motor Cycle Media Group plc ===Racing career=== After becoming a member of the Bavarian Police Team, Meier competed in 1000 km endurance trials that were popular at the time, considered as good training for motorcycle dispatch riders. In 1934, Meier attracted attention from the German Army motorcycle team after finishing a 1000 km enduro an hour ahead of schedule, riding an unpopular 400 cc single-cylinder BMW R4 with pressed-steel frame and out-moded trailing-link front forks.Classic Racer no 78 - pp 70 Mortons Motor Cycle Media Group plc With fellow competitors Fritz Linhardt and Joseph Forstner in the German Army team, they won so many enduro events that Meier became known as \"Der Gusseiserne Schorsch\" (Ironman Georg). ===1937 International Six Day Trial=== After many success at the 1000 km enduro events, Meier was selected for the German Trophy Team for the 1937 International Six Day Trial to be held in Wales.

Two of the British riders had extensive road-racing experience with Vic Brittain riding a Norton and George Rowley riding an AJS. Despite having no road racing experience, Meier won the Donington speed-trial, but the German Trophy Team lost the event to Great Britain Team by 10 seconds on the handicap system. The German Team officials were so impressed by Meier's performance that they suggested to BMW that he should be given a trial for their race-team. ===Racing for BMW Works Team 1937-1939=== The works BMW motorcycle team were looking for a replacement for Otto Ley who was about to retire from racing. At a race in Schleiz during 1937, Meier had the opportunity to try one of the new supercharged BMWs during practice.
