He is best known for his seminal contributions to the theory and applications of linear subspace methods including sub-band and wavelet transforms, particularly the binomial QMFA.N.

Since 1987, he has been with the New Jersey Institute of Technology where he is a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He was a Visiting Professor at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of the New York University, 2009\u20132010. In 1990, he showed that the binomial quadrature mirror filter bank (binomial QMF) is identical to the Daubechies wavelet filter, and interpreted and evaluated its performance from a discrete-time signal processing perspective.A.N.
