The PAC-Card contains a checklist of essential support questions, for patients to use in any interaction with a health professional. The PAC-Card was tested in a medical trial at OLVG (a large Amsterdam Hospital) by Jeanet Rooseman, Vanessa Scholtes and Dr. R. W. Poolman assessing the effectiveness of the PAC-Card, the following was concluded: \u2018The primary analysis with regard to patient satisfaction in patient-caregiver communication showed that the PAC-Card had a positive impact on two aspects of patient satisfaction in the intervention group. Patient satisfaction regarding quality of care and the way of communication improved significantly in the intervention group. To support patients in a more structured way of communicating the PAC-Card is recommended to be used by patients. It helps patients communicate more effectively and patients are more satisfied with the quality of care and communication.\u2019 Netwerk Palliatieve Zorg Zeeland, Zo praat je met je artsJeroen Bosch ZiekenhuisDialoogzorg, twee minuten aandacht voor het verhaal van de pati\u00ebnt == The Patient's Guide == In order to facilitate the use of the PAC-Card in 2014 Gordon published The Patient\u2019s Guide - Think.
