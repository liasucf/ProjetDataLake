The episode is Shuman's first writing credit, as she had previously been only a writer's assistant. It originally aired in the United States on April 11, 2011, on NBC as the twentieth episode of Chuck fourth season and the 74th episode overall. In the episode, guest stars Linda Hamilton, Timothy Dalton, Lauren Cohan, and Mekenna Melvin reprise their recurring roles of Alexei Volkoff, Mary Elizabeth Bartowski, Vivian Volkoff, and Alex McHugh, respectively. The episode also features Kevin Daniels as Ellyas Abshir. In their respective reviews of the episode, HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall and Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club wrote of various ideas the episode's writers introduced. Sepinwall noted several developments in the relationships between characters of the series. Sepinwall wrote that after becoming roommates, Casey and Morgan have become \"an old married couple\", drinking orange juice in unison and bickering with mouths full of cereal. In an \"emotional role reversal\" from previous points in their relationship, Chuck tries to be \"cool\" about Sarah's prenuptial agreement, while Sarah panics at Chuck's lack of an emotional reaction. Casey's relationship with his daughter also develops to the point that he considers revealing himself to her mother. Both Sepinwall and McGee wrote that Vivian was designed to be Chuck's counterpart. The episode also marks the beginning of Alexei's path to redemption. IGN writer Eric Goldman criticized the scene where Chuck and Sarah meet with Vivian for its frequent use of quick zooms to increase tension, writing that it \"just didn't feel like it was natural to this show's style.\" ===Cultural references=== This episodes maintains the series' tendency to reference popular culture. While reading a volume of A Song of Ice and Fire, Chuck notes, \"Eddard, you don't let your kids keep a direwolf. That's a terrible idea.\" This episode aired the same week as Game of Thrones first premiered on HBO.Game of Thrones Chuck and Ellyas later play Uno for the thorium. Volkoff jokes that to mine said thorium, he had to wage war with natives and destroy their Hometree, only to reveal that he and the other prisoners had recently watched Avatar. ==Reception== \"Chuck Versus the Family Volkoff\" continued Chuck steady decline in viewership, drawing 4.028 million viewers, a series low. It also had a 2.5/4 share among all households and 1.3/4 share among those aged 18\u201349. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote that \"Timothy Dalton was everything we had come to expect from him in the part: scary and dangerous and then so much the funnier for the way he kept trying to work the steps and turn over a new leaf. The episode left [Alexei]'s sincerity up in the air for most of the hour - was he really serious about making amends, or just trying to distract Chuck from his latest evil plan? - but Volkoff is such a well-drawn character, and Dalton so talented and versatile, that the comedy worked either way... Vivian, on the other hand? I'd been iffy on her in her most recent appearance, and putting her on camera with [Alexei], even briefly, was just a reminder of how much less she brings to the table.\" Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-. Though he praised Dalton's performance, McGee wrote, \"The direct parallels between Chuck and Vivian haven't really panned out in the way the show initially envisioned it. Let's face it: These two aren't exactly Buffy and Faith in terms of being foils for one another. The show has never painted Chuck as ever potentially going to the dark side. It has used Casey and occasionally Sarah to serve that function at times, but never Chuck. At this point, he's as set in his moral code as possible. Had the Vivian storyline happened at the outset of his Intersect 2.0 days, perhaps the taste of power could have gone to his head, with Vivian as an example of the road not taken. As such, Vivian's existence largely serves to connect her to the larger spy world of the show, not draw a direct parallel to the support system that helped Chuck overcome any potential temptations.\" Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 out of 10, writing, \"This Chuck got off to a shaky start. I don't know how to put my finger on it exactly, but the pacing felt off in the first third or so of the episode... Thankfully, things picked up considerably as the episode went along \u2013 I'd say the turning point was the scene in which Chuck was sent in to meet with the pirates. The way Chuck's big announcement that he worked for Alexei Volkoff immediately led to a bunch of guns pulled on him was funny, as was not only Chuck asking to play Uno (for his life), but that the pirate did indeed have the game.\" Carl Cortez of Assignment X, however, gave the episode a negative review, calling it \"a painfully nonsense driven episode that's now grasping at straws in an attempt to round out the last part of the season with an adequate storyline.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Chuck (season 4) episodes ",
