His love for singing grew as he performed at different concerts around his community. Apart from singing, Onesimus also has passion for dancing as he first gained expression at the age of 17 when his dance group God's soldiers won the Sprite competition in 2006. ==Music career== He discovered his knack for lyrics in 2008 when he joined the rap group Blessed Beyond Measure (also BBM Clique) dropping tracks such as \u201cBy MySide\u201d and \u201cRandom Thoughts\u201d with the outfit. The artist was to venture into a solo career soon after, working on an unreleased hip-hop mixtape called \u201cBeyond Limits\u201d for a year in 2009 before he found his true calling, music. Armstrong started singing secular music in 2010 and finally released two singles: \u201cBeautiful\u201d featuring award-winning Malawian rapper Young Kay and \u201cWithout Your Love\u201d which landed him a coveted deal with the record company \u2018Nde\u2019feyo Entertainment\u2019. Almost instantly thereafter he began his tour in Malawi under the stable, in 2011. He dropped a R&B; mixtape titled \u2018BRB\u2019 in 2012 and - in the same year - dropped his debut Afro R&B; album: \u201cNdele\u201d. In this album he showed his diversity as he also sings in his mother-tongue - Chichewa. By this time he had already worked with several of Malawi's urban music icons and also did a song called \u201cMusiye Ayende\u201d with Zambia's musicians Dalisoul and Afunika. He made appearances on many line-ups at acclaimed music festivals in Malawi sharing stages with the continent's industry giants: Oliver Mtukudzi, Freshlyground, Salif Keita, Professor, AKA, Naeto C. ==Awards== At the 2019 AFRIMA Onesimus won the award for Best Male Artist, Duo or Group in African Inspirational Music ==References== ==External links== * *https://www.iol.co.za/entertainment/music/local/onesimus-lives-his-gospel- music-13263163 *https://allafrica.com/view/group/main/main/id/00040581.html Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Malawian musicians ",
