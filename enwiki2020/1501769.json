It was probably used in the ritual sprinkling of the bride with water before the wedding. In form, it has a large bowl-like body and a stand that can be long or short. Painted scenes are placed on either the body of the vessel or the stand. One of the earliest lebetes gamikoi was painted by, apparently, a follower of Sophilos (c. 580 - 570). The lebes gamikos had the typical wedding procession, accompanied by the unique addition of chariots bearing Helen and Menelaos and the bride's brothers. A typical lebes gamikos shows wedding scenes (including mythic weddings such as the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, but the iconography can also be related to scenes such as mimes. ==Notes== Category:Wedding objects Category:Ancient Greek pot shapes Category:Marriage, unions and partnerships in Greece ",
