Retrieved 28 March 2015. At age nine he was working at a woolen factory and at fifteen was employed in the lead-mines of Esgair and Bwlch Gwyn. He moved on to working in the coal and iron mines of South Wales and in 1859 he set off to Australia. Landing in Victoria, he worked as a gold miner but was unsuccessful and relocated to Queensland some two years later where he turned to coal mining in the West Moreton district. This time his venture was such a success that he opened up many of the coalfields in the area and with the building of railways across Queensland the demand for coal become even greater, earning him a vast fortune and eventually became known as the 'Coal King'. In 1890, Thomas retired from mining and handed over the business to his employees, who formed the Aberdare Co-Operative Coal Co. Ltd. ==Political career== Thomas, representing the Ministerial Party, was a candidate for the seat of Bundamba at the 1893 colonial election. He easily defeated the sitting member, Thomas Glassey, and remained as the member until he decided not to stand in the 1899 election. Three years later, Thomas was appointed by premier Robert Philp to the Queensland Legislative Council, remaining there until his death in 1913. ==Personal life== In 1859, Thomas married Ann Morris at Llanfihangel Genau'r Glyn and together had 1 daughter, Mary, who grew up to marry Thomas Cribb Jr., the son of Thomas Bridson Cribb, the then Treasurer of Queensland. He had a great love of music, and for many years sponsored the annual Queensland Eisteddfodau, to which he gave between \u00a360 to \u00a3100 to the chief choral contest.

It was built on top of a rich coal seam, and while Thomas was alive, refused to mine the coal as it would mean having to demolish his home. After his death his wife, daughter, and her husband continued to live there and it was eventually sold in 1934 to Rylance Collieries and Brickworks who demolished the mansion in 1937 to mine the coal deposits below.Site of former Brynhyfryd Mansion for sale -- Old estates for sale.
