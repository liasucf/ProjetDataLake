Berliner, by Berliner, Carl Ebeling, Murray Campbell, and Gordon Goetsch. HiTech won the 1985 and 1989 editions of the North American Computer Chess Championship. In 1988 HiTech defeated GM Arnold Denker 3\u00bd-\u00bdhttps://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/26/nyregion/for-first-time-a-chess- computer-outwits-grandmaster-in-tournament.html in a match (though Denker was at the time well past his best, with an Elo rating of 2300). HiTech was one of two competing chess projects at Carnegie Mellon; the one that would succeed in the quest of beating the World Chess Champion was its rival ChipTest (the predecessor of IBM's Deep Thought and Deep Blue). == References == ==External links== * For First Time, a Chess Computer Outwits Grandmaster in Tournament, The New York Times, September 26, 1988 Category:Chess computers Category:One- of-a-kind computers ",
