A member of the northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill kindred of the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain, \u00c1ed was the son of Niall Caille. ==Background== From the death of \u00c1ed All\u00e1n in 743 until the overthrow of M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill by Brian Boru in 1002, the succession to the High Kingship of Ireland alternated between northern and southern branches of the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill with the north represented by members of the Cen\u00e9l n\u00c9ogain, \u00c1ed's paternal kindred, and the south by the Clann Cholm\u00e1in, his mother's kin.Byrne, p. 265, appendix 1, list 1 & appendix 2, tables 2, 3 & 5\\. The single exception to this system was the reign of Congalach Cnogba. Francis John Byrne describes this as \"a fragile convention, marked by watchful jealousy rather than friendly accord.\"Byrne, p. 265. During the reign of M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Ma\u00edl Ruanaid, who succeeded \u00c1ed's father as High King, the balance of power between north and south which had ensured the alternating succession appeared to be tipping in favour of the southern Clann Cholm\u00e1in kindred. The weakness of the Kings of Munster following the death of the powerful Feidlimid mac Crimthainn in 847 led to repeated attacks on Munster by M\u00e1el Sechnaill in the 850s and a submission by the kings of Munster in 858. In 859, Osraige was made subject to the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, and this led to open warfare between M\u00e1el Sechnaill and \u00c1ed.Byrne, pp. 263\u2013266; Charles-Edwards. ==Origins and family== \u00c1ed was the son of Niall Caille and Gormlaith. His mother, Gormflaith ingen Donncadha, is called \"Gormlaith of the dazzling white complexion\" by the Banshenchas. His maternal grandfather was Donnchad Midi, his paternal grandfather \u00c1ed Oirdnide. His father, his mother's brother, Conchobar mac Donnchada, and both of his grandfathers had been counted as High Kings of Ireland. The names of three of \u00c1ed's wives are recorded, although the order of his marriages is perhaps uncertain. His first wife may have been Gormlaith Rapach, \"the harsh\", daughter of Muiredach mac Eochada, king of Ulster. The Banshenchas say that Domnall mac \u00c1eda was her son, and Eithne, who married Flann Sinna, may have been her daughter. \u00c1ed's second wife, Land ingen D\u00fangaile (sister of Cerball mac D\u00fanlainge, king of Osraige) was the widow of his predecessor as High King, M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac M\u00e1ele Ruanaid, a grandson of Donnchad Midi. His third known wife was M\u00e1el Muire, probably the daughter of Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn, the king of the Picts in Britain. She was the mother of Niall Gl\u00fandub. On \u00c1ed's death she married his successor Flann Sinna. Other children of \u00c1ed included Domnall Dabaill (ancestor of Domnall Ua Lochlainn); a son named M\u00e1el Dub, reputed a saint; and M\u00e1el D\u00fain, who ruled Ailech as \u00c1ed's deputy until his early death in 867. ==Early years== Following the death of Neill Caille in 845, \u00c1ed's uncle M\u00e1el D\u00fain mac \u00c1eda assumed the kingship of Ailech. When \u00c1ed succeeded him is not recorded, but it might have been in 855. \u00c1ed is mentioned for the first time in the annals this year, as the Annals of Ulster records that he > made a foray against the Ulaid, and he left behind dead Coinnec\u00e1n son of > Colm\u00e1n and Flaithbertach son of Niall, and a large number besidesAnnals of > Ulster 855.3 Presumably Flaithbertach was his own brother, and this foray was made to secure \u00c1ed's position as king of Ailech. \u00c1ed came into power at a critical period in the history of Ireland. Raids by Norse Vikings had taken place for half a century, and the Norse settlements now seemed to have become permanent establishments, more than just bases for raids. They also now had an effective leadership under Amla\u00edb Conung and \u00cdmar. At this time, both the contemporary annalists as well as modern historians refer to them not just as Vikings, foreigners or pagans, but also Norse-Irish or Norse-Gaels. \u00c1ed Findliath has been described as one of the Irish high-kings who most effectively fought the Norse expansion in Ireland. He did indeed win some crucial battles against the Norse-Gaels; the first recorded victory is in 856, at the battle of Glenn Foichle,AU 856.5 Gall-Gaeidhelu here translated Norse-gael. Gall literally denotes stranger or foreigner, but is used in the annalistic records of this period only in the meaning of Norse foreigners. Viking raiders are generally referred to as pagans or heathens six years prior to him becoming high-king. The reigning High-King at the time, Mael Sechnaill, seemed more concerned with the internal Irish power struggle, particularly in Munster, than with engaging the Norse. There is, however, one reference in 856 to him fighting against \"pagans\" (Vikings) with the support of the Norse-Gaels.AU 856.2 Against Gennti supported by Gall-Ghoidhelaib This could be interpreted as an alliance between the Norse settlers and the established Irish society against marauders. In 858, M\u00e1el Sechnaill finally managed to establish control over Munster, and in 859 he also made a peace settlement with Cerball mac D\u00fanlainge, king of Osraige (forced upon him by Cerball, who had allied himself with Amla\u00edb and \u00cdmar and ravaged M\u00edde). M\u00e1el Sechnaill now turned his attention to the north, where the growing power of \u00c1ed Findliath had become a threat against him as head of U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. In 860 he brought an army consisting of forces from all of the southern part of Ireland to Armagh. While they were camped there, \u00c1ed Findliath attacked. The outcome of the battle seem to have been some sort of draw.AU 858.4, 859.2\u20133 og 860.1 By now it was \u00c1ed Findliath who sought an alliance with the Norse in Dublin. In 861 as well as 862 he plundered M\u00edde in co-operation with Norse forces; in 862 he also had the support of Flann mac Conaing, king of Brega.AU 861.1 862.2 Neither Amla\u00edb nor \u00cdmar is mentioned on these occasions, but the annalistic entry of 862 reads \"the Norse kings\": riga Gall. == King of Tara == M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac M\u00e1ele Ruanaid died 20 November 862, and he was on that occasion described in the Annals of Ulster as ri h-Erenn uile, king of all Ireland. That was a title that would never be used to refer to \u00c1ed Findliath, even though he assumed the kingship of Tara following M\u00e1el Sechnaill's death, and has also been counted in the lists of High Kings of Ireland. His kingship was disputed throughout his 17-year-long reign, and he did not even have support from the southern clans of U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. The annals show that the Taillten Fair was not held in six of those 17 years, which is a strong indication of unrest. The Norse of Dublin had, by the beginning of \u00c1ed's reign, become an important, if not very trustworthy, ally in the struggle for power in M\u00edde. M\u00e1el Sechnaill's successor as head of Clann Cholmain and king of M\u00edde, Lorc\u00e1n mac Cathail, allied himself with Amlaib, \u00cdmar and Auisle against Flann of Brega. Flann was a former ally of Dublin, and still \u00c1ed's most important ally in the central part of Ireland. Lorc\u00e1n and his Norse allies plundered Brega in 863, and in 864 Conchobar mac Donnchada, king of Lagore (southern Brega) and presumably an ally of Flann against Lorc\u00e1n, was captured and drowned near Clonard on Amlaib's order. \u00c1ed led a host to M\u00edde, captured Lorc\u00e1n and blinded him. \u00c1ed now had some notable victories against the Norse. He defeated the Vikings at Lough Foyle in 866 and uprooted their settlements. In 866 Amla\u00edb and Auisle left Ireland with the larger part of the Norse forces, and, in co-operation with the Norse-Gaels from present-day Scotland, they attacked the Picts.AU 866.1 Gallaib Erenn & Alban \u00c1ed seized this opportunity, plundering and burning all the Norse bases (longphorts) in the northern part of Ireland.AU 866.4 the Norse bases are referred as Longportu Gall In 868 \u00c1ed again was confronted by a coalition of his Irish rivals and the Norse-Gaels. According to the Annals of Ulster he defeated \"the U\u00ed Ne\u00edll of Brega, and the Laigin, and a large force of the foreigners\" in a battle at a place called Cell Ua nDaigri. Flann of Brega was killed in this battle. This battle has been depicted as a decisive victory over the Norse. Amlaib and \u00cdmar were, however, very active in Ireland during the following years and seem to have suffered little harm to their ambition or strength. It is probably more accurate to regard this battle as a victory over the southern U\u00ed Ne\u00edll and Leinster. In 870 \u00c1ed followed up his victory from 868 by invading Leinster with the support of his new ally Cerball of Osraige, and then invaded Leinster again in 874.AU 868.4, 870.2, 874.3 \u00c1ed Findliath died on 20 November 879, at Druim Inasclainn:https://archive.org/stream/historyofkilsara00lesl#page/n211/mode/2up in the territory of Conaille. On that occasion he was described as \"king of Tara\" (rex Temorie), although a poem from the annals refers to him as \"over- king of the Irish\" (airdri Gaidhel).AU 879.1 He was buried at either Armagh or Dromiskin.https://archive.org/stream/historyofkilsara00lesl#page/170/mode/2up ==Notes== ==References== * * * Byrne, Francis John, Irish Kings and High- Kings.
