    "text": "Time is the Key is the fourth album by Pierre Moerlen's Gong. It was released in late 1979. Featuring an all-instrumental jazz-driven sound, notable for the prominent use of vibraphone, it has little to do with the psychedelic space rock of Daevid Allen's Gong, even though the two bands share a common history. It features the English jazz keyboard player Peter Lemer on most tracks, their only album to do so, and Allmusic notes that there is also a progressive rock influence at play, especially on the first two numbers. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Pierre Moerlen's Gong *Pierre Moerlen \u2013 drums, vibraphone, gong, electravibe, marimba, glockenspiel, tympani, darbuka, synthesizers (7, 8) *Hansford Rowe \u2013 bass (3 - 11), acoustic guitar (5), bass synthesizer (11) *Bon Lozaga \u2013 guitar (3 - 11) ;Former Pierre Moerlen's Gong *Allan Holdsworth \u2013 lead guitar (9 - 11) ;Additional personnel *Darryl Way \u2013 violin (1) *Joe Kirby \u2013 acoustic bass (1, 2) *Peter Lemer \u2013 keyboards (3 - 11), including Polymoog (6 - 10) *Nico Ramsden \u2013 lead and rhythm guitar (8) Produced by Pierre Moerlen ===Production credits=== * Engineering \u2013 John Rollo * Mastering \u2013 Ray Staff at Trident * Photography \u2013 Jay Myrdal and Sheila Rock * Sleeve layout and design \u2013 Steve Ridgeway and Julie Harris * Additional engineer \u2013 Brian Risner * Studio co-ordination \u2013 Brian Risner ==References== Category:1979 albums Category:Gong (band) albums Category:Pierre Moerlen's Gong albums Category:Arista Records albums ",
