    "text": "The nuclear island basemat is a cast-in-place reinforced concrete foundation, about 6-foot-thick which serves to support the nuclear island structures. Nuclear island structures consist of the reactor containment building (RCB), the shield building and auxiliary building (turbine building, control building and other).Stability check for ni common basemat For ease of construction the basemat is built on a mudmat, which is made of lean concrete that rests upon the load-bearing soil.Design of Structures, Components, Equipment and Systems - AP1000 Design Control Document The nuclear island basemat's most important role is compliance with earthquake response, requiring that nuclear plants, to be designed so that, if an earthquake occurs strong enough to trigger a safe- shutdown, the nuclear island structures should continue to function within the applicable stress limits. The required functions of the nuclear island structures must me assured during and after the earthquake vibratory ground motion.Safety evaluation by the office of new reactors related to amendment no. 2 to the combined license no. npf-91 and license no. npf-92 Southern Nuclear Operating Company, Inc ==References== ==External links== *SC Wall Piers and Basemat Connections: Numerical Investigation of Behavior and Design *Investigation of stress reduction effect on structures due to basemat uplift using energy concept *IAEA Nuclear Energy Series ~ Construction Technologies for Nuclear Power Plants (No. NP-T-2.5) by International Atomic Energy Agency Category:Earthquake and seismic risk mitigation Category:Earthquake engineering Category:Shallow foundations Category:Civil engineering stubs ",
