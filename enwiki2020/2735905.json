He developed an interest in Chinese folk religion during this period. Later he served in the colonial bureaucracy and developed a fascination with spiritism. He declined his appointment as the first Caodaiist Pope and was not involved in the official establishment of Caodaiism in 1926. Instead, he chose to withdraw to a life of seclusion. Thus, the role went to Venerable L\u00ea V\u0103n Trung, who accepted on the condition that his title be Acting Pope. In 1926, L\u00ea V\u0103n Trung and over two hundred others signed the \"Declaration of the Founding of the Cao \u0110\u00e0i Religion\"; Chieu was not among the signers.
