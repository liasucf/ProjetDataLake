In: Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon (BBKL). vol. 2, Bautz, Hamm 1990, , p. 1250. == Biography == Ida was born into a prosperous mercantile family in Nivelles, an important market town and pilgrimage destination in Brabant, a short distance to the south of Brussels. After her father died the family arranged for her to be married. She was aged only nine or sixteen (sources differ), and not wishing to marry she fled to a beguinage, a community of intentionally unmarried Godly women who lived in a shared community, but without taking vows or cutting themselves off from the world outside. The beguinage community that took her in comprised seven women who lived near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in her home town. Ida became a beguine. She moved on in around 1213, accepted into the Cistercian convent at Kerkom near Tienen. (The convent relocated shortly afterwards to La Ram\u00e9e.) There she worked as a writer and illustrator.Ursula Peters: Vita reliosa und spirituelles Erleben. Frauenmystik und frauenmystische Literatur im 13. und 14. Jahrhundert In: Gisela Brinker- Gabler (compiler-producer), Deutsche Literatur von Frauen, vol. 1, Darmstadt/M\u00fcnchen 1988. . p. 90 She reported numerous visions and other experiences by which she had been affected, and developing a particularly close relationship with the Virgin Mary. Her experiences were sufficiently widely attested for her to become identified as a woman mystic. She is also celebrated for her exceptional dedication to poverty relief. Ida of Nivelles was later beatified. The church celebrates her each year on 12 December. == References == Category:1190 births Category:1231 deaths Category:13th-century Christian mystics Category:Belgian Christian mystics Category:Cistercian beatified people Category:Cistercian mystics Category:Cistercian nuns Category:People from Nivelles Category:Roman Catholic mystics ",
