It brings together leaders in government for a global dialogue about governmental process and policies with a focus on the issues of futurism, technology innovation and other topics. The summit acts as a knowledge exchange hub between government officials, thought leaders, policy makers and private sector leaders and as an analysis platform for the future trends, issues and opportunities facing humanity. The summit hosts over 90 speakers from 150 participating countries, along with over 4000 attendees. == History == The World Government Summit was formed by a team of experts from different disciplines to bring government, business and civil society together with the goal of improving the future for the seven billion people on the planet.
