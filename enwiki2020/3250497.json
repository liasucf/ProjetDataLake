Along with Ver\u00f0andi (possibly \"happening\" or \"present\"Orchard (1997:174).) and Skuld (possibly \"debt\" or \"future\"Orchard (1997:151).), Ur\u00f0r makes up a trio of Norns that are described as deciding the fates of people. Ur\u00f0r is attested in stanza 20 of the Poetic Edda poem V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 and the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning. Ur\u00f0r is together with the other Norns located at the well Ur\u00f0arbrunnr beneath the world ash tree Yggdrasil of Asgard. They spin threads of life, cut marks in the pole figures and measure people's destinies, which shows the fate of all human beings and gods. Norns are always present when a child is born and decide its fate. The three Norns represent the past (Ur\u00f0r), future (Skuld) and present (Ver\u00f0andi).Norner (Store norske leksikon)Nornor (Nordisk familjebok / Uggleupplagan. 19. Mykenai - Norrpada) Ur\u00f0r is commonly written as Urd or Urth. In some English translations, her name is glossed with the Old English form of ur\u00f0r; Wyrd. ==Attestations== ===Poetic Edda=== Yggdrasil is said to stand \"always over Urd's well\", or the well of fate, Urd's well is located in Asgard. Urd appears in the V\u00f6lva's Prophecy V\u00f6lusp\u00e1: > {| | Benjamin Thorpe translation: :Thence come maidens, much knowing, :three > from the hall, which under that tree stands :Urd hight the one, the second > Verdandi, :on a tablet they graved\u2014Skuld the third. :Laws they established, > life allotted to the sons of men; :destinies pronounced.Thorpe (1907:3). | > Henry Adams Bellows translation: :Thence come the maidens mighty in wisdom, > :Three from the dwelling down 'neath the tree; :Urth is one named, Verthandi > the next, \u2014 :On the wood they scored, \u2014 and Skuld the third. :Laws they made > there, and life allotted :To the sons of men, and set their fates.Bellows > (1923:9). | |} ==References== ==Sources== *Bellows, Henry Adams (Trans.)
