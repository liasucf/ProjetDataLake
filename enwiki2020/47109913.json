It received three C\u00e9sar Award nominations and won two: Most Promising Actress for Clotilde Hesme and Most Promising Actor for Gr\u00e9gory Gadebois. ==Plot== Existing by petty thieving and open-air sex, the penniless Ang\u00e8le answers a job ad from the taciturn Tony. He lives with his widowed mother Myriam and runs a fishing boat with his brother out of the harbour at Port-en-Bessin. Over his mother's opposition, he gives Ang\u00e8le a job helping Myriam sell the catch in the fish market and a room in their house. More than once Ang\u00e8le offers him immediate sex, but that is not his idea of a relationship. Bit by bit, details of Ang\u00e8le's past start emerging. She is just out from a two-year stint in prison for the death of her husband, which she claims was an accident. Her estranged son Yohan is in the custody of her in-laws, who despise her. She wants to regain him, but will have to show that she has a fixed address, a steady job and is in a stable relationship. Slowly she gets better at her work and begins to win some respect from Tony and his family, to which sympathy is added when they learn that she has a son she wants to regain. She gets involved in community activities and during rehearsals for a children's play she and Tony have an enjoyable tumble backstage. A day is set and on the morning of the wedding she is overjoyed to find that her father-in-law has brought Yohan, who thinks he would now prefer to live with Ang\u00e8le and Tony. == Cast == * Clotilde Hesme as Ang\u00e8le * Gr\u00e9gory Gadebois as Tony * \u00c9velyne Didi as Myriam * J\u00e9r\u00f4me Huguet as Ryan * Antoine Couleau as Yohan * Patrick Descamps as Yohan's grandfather * Lola Due\u00f1as as Anabel * Corine Marienneau as Yohan's grandmother == References == == External links == * Category:2010 films Category:2010 drama films Category:French-language films Category:French drama films Category:French films Category:Films directed by Alix Delaporte Category:Films set in Normandy Category:2010 directorial debut films ",
