    "text": "The 1980 United States presidential election in Oregon took place on November 4, 1980. All fifty states and The District of Columbia were part of the 1980 United States presidential election. Voters chose six electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. ==Background== Oregon had voted in 1976 for incumbent President Gerald Ford over challenger Carter in the previous election by an extremely narrow margin of just 1,713 votes, but had been George McGovern\u2019s sixth-strongest state during his 1972 2,900-plus-county landslide loss. Both Carter and Reagan won the Democratic and Republican presidential primaries held during the third week of May 1980.\u2018Bush Wins Michigan; Regan and Carter Are Oregon Victors \u2013 Californian Nears Majority\u2019; The New York Times, May 21, 1980, p. A1 In August early in Carter's campaign, he targeted Oregon as a state he might win despite having supported only one Democrat since 1944,Perry, James M. and Hunt, Albert R.; \u2018Negative Accent: Carter Plans to Win By Depicting Reagan As Shallow, Dangerous\u2019; The Wall Street Journal, August 14, 1980, p. 1 on the basis that independent candidate and Reagan primary rival John B. Anderson would split the GOP vote.Broder, David S.; \u2018As Race Begins, Carter Trails in Key States He Must Win\u2019; The Washington Post, August 16, 1980, p. A1 The last week of September saw all three leading candidates visit the Beaver State,Hunt, Albert R.; \u2018Pacific Northwest Just Might Hold Key To White House, Draws All 3 Contenders\u2019; The Wall Street Journal, September 29, 1980, p. 12 and at the end of the month Reagan was shown as ahead by around five percentage points, after having been in the lead in Oregon ever since the first polls were taken in mid-September.Cattani, Richard J.; \u2018Reagan outstrides Carter in state-by-state quest for \u201celectoral\u201d support\u2019; The Christian Science Monitor, September 18, 1980 October saw Vice-President Walter Mondale doing extensive campaigning in the state,Smith, Terence; \u2018Mondale Hunts for Votes\u2019; New York Times Special, October 5, 1980, p. 40 and with polls showing Anderson winning over fifteen percent of the state's ballots and strong support for the Equal Rights Amendment opposed by Reagan, the Democrats possessed substantial hope in the state. By the last week of October, Carter's spokesmen were confident they could crack a state whose loss four years previously they attributed to the presence of Eugene McCarthy on the ballot,Martin, Lawrence; \u2018Carter is leading, but election may hinge on debate, hostages\u2019; The Globe and Mail; October 27, 1980, p. 13 but in the days before the poll sample votes swung towards Reagan again.Broder, David S.; \u2018Carter has an uphill fight, state-by- state survey shows\u2019; Boston Globe, November 2, 1980, p. 1 ==Vote== Oregon was ultimately won by former California Governor Ronald Reagan (R) by 9.66%. Reagan dominated in the conservative, populist eastern interior and Rogue Valley, where he won a majority in every county, and Carter, despite carrying four counties, did not win a majority in any due to a strong vote west of the Cascades for Anderson, who reached double figures in all Willamette Valley counties except Columbia and Linn. This was the first time the Republicans had carried Coos County since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952.Menendez, Albert J.; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, pp. 285-286 , this is the last election in which Lane County voted for a Republican presidential candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; \u2018How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century\u2019; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 ==Results== === Primary Results === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+1980 Democratic Primary !Candidate !Votes !Delegates |- |Jimmy Carter |208,693 |26 |- |Ted Kennedy |114,651 |14 |- |Jerry Brown |34,409 |0 |- |Others |10,569 |0 |- |Totals |368,322 |40 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+1980 Republican Primary !Candidate !Votes !Delegates |- |Ronald Reagan |170,449 |17 |- |George H.W.
