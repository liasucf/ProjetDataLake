If a spirit is produced out of marc of other fruit, the name tropinovec needs to be preceded by the name of that fruit. Because it is neutral in terms of taste and smell, home-produced tropinovec is commonly used to soak fruit in it, thus producing a variety of fruit based spirits: borovni\u010devec with blueberries, vi\u0161njevec with sour cherries, orehovec with walnuts, etc. It can also be used with herbs or honey (medica). But tropinovec is not necessarily a low-grade spirit. When fine wine varieties are used to produce it, it can be marketed as a stand-alone product.http://www.revija- vino.si/vinoportal/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=181&Itemid;=155 == References == Category:Pomace brandies Category:Slovenian distilled drinks ",
