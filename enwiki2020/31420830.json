    "text": "The 2011 Salford City Council election took place on 5 May 2011 to elect members of Salford City Council in England. This was on the same day as other local elections. Salford local elections are organised 'in thirds', with Councillors elected in 2007 defending their seats in 2011, with vote share changes calculated on that basis. One third of the council was up for election. The Labour Party gained five seats and remains in overall control of the council. The results mirrored those of the 2010 elections with Labour winning the same seventeen wards and the Conservatives three wards. The composition of the Council following the 2011 elections is: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Party!!Seats!! \u00b1 |- |style=\"background- color: \" | |Labour || 44 || +5 |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Conservative || 11 || -2 |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Liberal Democrat || 3 || \u20132 |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Community Action || 2 || -1 |} ==Ward results== Asterisks denote incumbent Councillors seeking re-election.
