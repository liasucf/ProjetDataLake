    "text": "Ashok is a 2006 Indian Telugu-language romantic action film produced by Maharishi Cinema, directed and written by Surender Reddy, starring NTR Jr., Sameera Reddy, Prakash Raj, and Sonu Sood in the lead roles. It is a movie about redemption in which the title character must make amends to his father after being blamed for his grandmother's death while meeting a girl who understands him and his burdens; at the same time, he must also battle against a mafia-like organisation that hates him. The movie was released in Andhra Pradesh on 14 July 2006. It was an average grosser at the box office. The film was later dubbed into Tamil with the same name and Hindi as The Fighterman Ghayal. It was remade into Bengali Bangladesh as Babar Kosom (2007) with Manna & Nipun Akter. ==Plot== Ashok (NTR Jr.) is a mechanic who is thrown out of his house because of his rash actions that have led to the death of his grandmother (Rama Prabha). His father (Prakash Raj) still harbours anger against Ashok despite his good behaviour that has a positive outcome. Ashok then happens to meet an insecure yet talented dancer named Anjali (Sameera Reddy) and fall in love with her. Anjali witnesses a crime involving KK (Sonu Sood), the leader of one of the largest crime syndicates in Andhra Pradesh. KK then tries to ensnare Anjali within his evil plans, while Ashok wages a one- man war against KK's gang. Ashok's friend Rajiv (Rajiv Kanakala) attempts to rescue Anjali, but KK has him killed. Ashok then avenges Rajiv's death by killing KK's sidekick. This enrages KK, and his gang captures Ashok's sister (Revathi), demanding that Ashok hands himself over to them in return for her safety. Ashok's father drags him to KK's manor and orders him to save his sister. Ashok and KK then get into a dramatic fight at Ashok's sister's wedding. Just when it appears that Ashok will emerge the winner, KK's mother (Vadivukkarasi) tries to shoot Ashok but accidentally kills her own son. She drops the gun and falls down dead, apparently dying of shock. The film ends with Ashok's sister getting married and Ashok receiving his father's forgiveness. ==Cast== * NTR Jr. as Ashok * Sameera Reddy as Anjali * Prakash Raj as Ashok's father * Sonu Sood as KK * Rajiv Kanakala as Rajiv * Vadivukkarasi as KK's mother * Revathi as Ashok's sister * Rama Prabha as Ashok's grandmother * Sudha as Ashok's mother * Raghu Babu as Anjali's brother * Surekha Vani as Anjali's sister-in-law * Venu Madhav as Jaggu * Satyam Rajesh as Rajesh, Ashok's friend * Supreeth as KK's brother * Jeeva as KK's henchman * Fish Venkat as KK's henchman * Narsing Yadav as KK's henchman * Duvvasi Mohan as TV Reporter * Chatrapathi Sekhar as Sekhar * Krishna Bhagavan as Police Inspector * Ravi Kale * Stunt Silva * Satya Prakash == Crew == * Director: Surender Reddy * Screenplay: Surender Reddy * Story: Surender Reddy * Additional Screenplay : Gopimohan * Dialogue: Abburi Ravi * Producer: Valluripalli Ramesh * Music: Mani Sharma * Cinematography: Senthil Kumar * Choreography: Brindha, Kalyan, & Lawrence * Action: Vijayan * Art Direction: Ashok * Editing: Gowtam Raju * Accountant: Vinod Ubale ==Music== The music was composed by Mani Sharma and released by Aditya Music. ==Production and release== The film was shot in Super 35 format.
