Shein specializes in representing asbestos plaintiffs. ==Leadership== The Shein Law Center is managed by Benjamin Shein. He is a graduate of the University of Miami School of Law. ==Racketeering cases== In January 2014, Garlock Sealing Technologies filed suit against the Shein Law Center for conspiracy, fraud, and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Only the first page of the complaints were filed publicly, with the remainder filed under seal to protect confidential information about previous asbestos lawsuits. Since then, several other mesothelioma cases have used this opinion to alter or beg reconsideration for discovery in civil tort action. According to an article in Legal Newsline, \"The defendants deny the assertions in the lawsuit and believe critical evidence to prove their allegations include documents including at least three New York law firms \u2013 meaning the necessary evidence is located in New York.\" As the civil RICO act case heated up, more legal scholars began to follow the case and its far reaching implications for tort liability. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice filed an opinion in the case saying that Garlock's use of the 2019 filing procedure was correct, and Judge Hodges granting of disclosure of that information also correct, the judge erred in granting further access, and asked that his decision be reversed.In re: Motions for Access of Garlock Sealing Technologies LLC., No. 11-1130-LPS (D. Del March 15, 2013) In March 2016, Garlock voluntary dropped its RICO claims and a federal judge agreed to stay the cases. As part of the greater settlement package the action will be dismissed with prejudice.http://legalnewsline.com/stories/510704392-federal- judge-agrees-to-stay-rico-cases-against-asbestos-plaintiffs-firms During discovery, Shein was forced to disclose that it filed claims against Owen Corning's and EaglePicher on behalf of shipyard worker and mesothelioma sufferer Vincent Golini. During his 2009 suit against Garlock, Golini testified that he had never used products from those companies. Shein filed those claims using affidavits dated before Golini's testimony. John Crane Group filed a lawsuit against the Shein Law Center on June 6, 2016 in federal court in Illinois. The suit alleged that Shein withheld evidence in violation of the RICO Act in cases brought against John Crane by sufferers of mesothelioma. Benjamin Shein was also personally named as a defendant. Specifically, the suit alleges that Shein failed to disclose during discovery that their clients had been exposed to products containing asbestos made by other companies and intentionally delayed filing claims against those companies' bankruptcy trusts. John Crane said that it would have avoided judgements and \"substantial defense costs\" if it had known this information. In another complaint, John Crane alleged that Shein \"fabricated false asbestos 'exposure histories' for their clients in asbestos litigation \u2026 and systematically concealed evidence of their clients' exposure to other sources of asbestos.\" ==References== Category:Law firms based in Philadelphia ",
