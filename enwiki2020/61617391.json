    "text": "Bulanci is a Czech freeware 2001 action video game created by the SleepTeam development group. == Gameplay and plot == The game sees players battle other Bulanci called EAP (extremely aggressive pillows). It is a 2D game with a top down view. The history within the game follows the trajectory of human history. == Development == Sleep Team was founded in 1996, and their first game Polda was released two years later. After this the team members began to complete with own titles and non-gaming projects, so it would be a long time until their next game. The developers wanted to create a small free multiplayer game that wouldn't require installation and could be later augmented with new add-ons. Development began at the start of 1999 and before Christmas 2001 the first version of Bulanci was released. It was created on the DeepSlumber engine. Graphics and script were taken care of by Jaroslav Wagner.https://is.muni.cz/th/thka4/Vizualny_styl_ceskych_a_slovenskych_adventur_medzi_rokmi_1990_az_1999.pdf Bulanci became a commercial success and was the team's best selling game. Over the next few years new maps, weapons, and feature were added, and in 2005 the latest official version was published with a map editor. In 2003 an English version of Bulanci was created called Combat Pillows, and became one of the first Czech independent games to be internationally distributed using digital keys. By 2007, Bulanci had hundreds of thousands of players in the Czech Republic and internationally. In 2009 a Czech version of Bulanci was made in Java for mobile phones to be played with buttons, distributed by Nostromo. In 2012, an illegal amateur adaption of Bulanci was uploaded to Android platforms. The developers celebrated the 15th anniversary of Bulanci in 2016 by launching a new website, set up a Twitter account and printing a limited edition of Bulanci T-shirts. == Critical reception == * Bonusweb called Bulanci \"impressive\". Mobile Mania wrote that the \"Bul\u00e1nci brand is one of the most valuable Czech trademarks in the field of games\". * Bulanci inspired 2007's Tux\u00e1nci. * In 2003 Bulanci won the Joystick Award. * At the 5th IMGA awards, Bulanci was nominated for Excellence in Connectivity. == References == Category:2001 video games Category:Freeware games Category:Action video games Category:Video games developed in the Czech Republic ",
