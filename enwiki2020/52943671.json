University Debating and Literary Club (UDLC) formerly University Literary Club of the university organises the festival. Some of the previous invitees include news anchor and author Rajdeep Sardesai, poet Keki N. Daruwalla, politician Mani Shankar Aiyar and independent journalist Rana Ayyub. ==Organisation== The festival is organized under the auspices of the University Literary and Debating Club of the Aligarh Muslim University. The club consists of students as its members. The festival is the University Debating and Literary Club's flagship event. Journalists like Rajdeep Sardesai talking about media, activists such as Paranjoy Guha Thakurta talking about crony capitalism and novelists like Chandrahas Choudhury having panel discussions about the Indian novel; the festival is a diverse celebration of literature and mass communication, in all its forms. The festival attracts audience from all across the city, transcending the boundary of the university. Previous invitees include the poet Keki N. Daruwalla, politician Mani Shankar Aiyar and independent journalist Rana Ayyub. With people from diverse areas coming together and talking about the issues of the day and age, the festival is truly a melting pot of culture. Workshops to teach students about the ins and outs of various forms of writing and public speaking are also conducted as a part of the festival, which rounds out the educational experience. The University Literary Club was established in 1973. The club is the extension of the oldest literary Society of AMU, the \"Muhammadan Anglo- Oriental College Literary Society\" founded by Sir Syed Ahmad Khan himself. The University Literary Club was rechristened as University Debating Literary Club in 2015. ==Past festivals== === Lit Fest 2017 === The festival was organised from 3-5 March, 2017. * List of Guests in 2017 {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
