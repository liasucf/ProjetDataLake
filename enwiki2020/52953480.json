He held the WBO cruiserweight title from 1993 through 1994 and also contested for the WBC light-heavyweight title. ==Professional career== === Early career === Giovannini made his professional boxing debut at the age of 23 in 1984 losing in a decision. He conquered the Argentinean light-heavyweight title in his 17th fight and continued campaigning at the light-heavyweight division until 1990. That year, he lost by TKO against Jeff Harding for the WBC light-heavyweight world title. He then moved up to fight at cruiserweight where he got the chance to fight Markus Bott for the WBO cruiserweight world title, which he won by split decision in Hamburg, Germany. He would defend the title once, in a rematch with Bott by unanimous decision. On December 1994, he fought against Dariusz Michalczewski, losing by KO in the 10th round and dropping his WBO title. He would continue fighting scarcely until 2000 without much success. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |Loss |38-10-4 |align=left| Ezra Sellers | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |38-9-4 |align=left| Luis Nelson Gonz\u00e1lez | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Loss |37-9-4 |align=left| Dar\u00edo Walter Matteoni | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Draw |37-8-4 |align=left| Sergio Daniel Merani | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |37-8-3 |align=left| Luis Delmiro Alves | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Loss |36-8-3 |align=left| Dariusz Michalczewski | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |36-7-3 |align=left| Larry Carlisle | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |35-7-3 |align=left| Jos\u00e9 Arnaldo Balbuena | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |34-7-3 |align=left| Miguel \u00c1ngel Antonio Aguirre | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |33-7-3 |align=left| Eduardo Luiz Dos Santos | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |32-7-3 |align=left| Markus Bott | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |31-7-3 |align=left| Markus Bott | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Loss |30-7-3 |align=left| Andres Anselmi | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |30-6-3 |align=left| Marcelo Dom\u00ednguez | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Loss |29-6-3 |align=left| Oscar Alfredo Gonzalez | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |29-5-3 |align=left| Miguel Angel Robledo | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Draw |28-5-3 |align=left| Jorge Juan Salgado | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Loss |28-5-2 |align=left| Jeff Harding | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |28-4-2 |align=left| Victor Robledo | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |27-4-2 |align=left| Jeff Harding | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Loss |26-4-2 |align=left| Victor Robledo | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |26-3-2 |align=left| Mabobo Kamunga | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |25-3-2 |align=left| Mwehu Beya | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |24-3-2 |align=left| Noe Cruciani | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Loss |23-3-2 |align=left| Jorge Juan Salgado | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |23-2-2 |align=left| Eduardo Domingo Contreras | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |22-2-2 |align=left| Nestor Albarracin | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |21-2-2 |align=left| Angel Antonio Caro | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |20-2-2 |align=left| Angel Antonio Caro | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |19-2-2 |align=left| Miguel Angel Maldonado | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |18-2-2 |align=left| Miguel Angel Steimbach | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |17-2-2 |align=left| Eduardo Domingo Contreras | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Draw |16-2-2 |align=left| Clarismundo Aparecido Silva | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |16-2-1 |align=left| Jorge Juan Salgado | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |15-2-1 |align=left| Anibal Adan Romero | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |14-2-1 |align=left| Jorge Juan Salgado | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |13-2-1 |align=left| Pedro Ferraro | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |12-2-1 |align=left| Miguel Cea | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |11-2-1 |align=left| Juan Carlos Fernandez | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |10-2-1 |align=left| Juan Carlos Rodriguez | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Draw |9-2-1 |align=left| Sergio Daniel Merani | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |9-2 |align=left| Victor Robledo | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |8-2 |align=left| Anibal Adan Romero | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |7-2 |align=left| Juan Jose Leiva | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Loss |6-2 |align=left| Mario Oscar Melo | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |6-1 |align=left| Anibal Adan Romero | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |5-1 |align=left| Daniel Eduardo Guibaudo | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |4-1 |align=left| Miguel Antonio Mosna | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |3-1 |align=left| Mario Oscar Melo | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |2-1 |align=left| Anibal Adan Romero | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Win |1-1 |align=left| Miguel Antonio Mosna | | | |align=left| |align=left| |- |Loss |0-1 |align=left| Mario Oscar Melo | | | |align=left| |align=left| |} ==See also== *List of cruiserweight boxing champions ==External links== * |- Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Light-heavyweight boxers Category:Cruiserweight boxers Category:World cruiserweight boxing champions Category:World Boxing Organization champions Category:People from Rafaela Category:Argentine male boxers ",
