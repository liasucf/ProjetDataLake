It is an erect shrub with sessile leaves and groups of about fourteen to twenty pink flowers in more or less spherical groups on the end of the branches. ==Description== Kunzea praestans is a shrub with a few erect main stems and which usually grows to a height of . The leaves are glabrous, oblong to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide usually without a petiole. The flowers are arranged in more or less spherical groups of fourteen to twenty, often on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering.
