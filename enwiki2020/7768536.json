    "text": "Hoplobatrachus crassus, also called Jerdon's bullfrog, Jerdon's bull frog, and South Indian bullfrog, is a species of frog found widely distributed on the plains of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Its range may extend to the adjacent Bhutan and Myanmar. ==Description== This species has a shovel shaped metatarsal tubercle and has longer hind legs than the somewhat similar H. tigrinus with which it overlaps in part of its range. When the leg is stretched along the body the tibio-tarsal (ankle) joint lies at a position between the ear and eye. Females are slightly larger than males (about 8\u201310 cm or more while males are about 5\u20138 cm). ==Habitat and ecology== Hoplobatrachus crassus is a terrestrial frog that lives in seasonally flooded dry grasslands, open plains and arid areas, also in cultivated areas and near human settlements. Adult frogs are often found in burrows. They may aestivate during dry periods. Breeding takes place in water. Males have two vocal sacs on the side and the call sounds somewhat like a bleating goat. The calls last for a few minutes and consist of 2 to 4 series of 13-18 bleating pulses. They breed with the onset of the rains. The species is able to tolerate salinity to some extent. They tolerate 25% natural sea-water (25 parts of sea-water diluted with 75 parts of distilled water) but do not live for more than a week when the salinity goes up to the strength of 35% natural sea-water (sea water itself being about 32 parts per thousand). Their tadpoles are thought to feed on algae. A ciliate in the genus Cepedea has been recorded living in tadpoles of this species. ==References== crassus Category:Amphibians of Bangladesh Category:Frogs of India Category:Amphibians of Nepal Category:Frogs of Sri Lanka Category:Amphibians described in 1853 Category:Taxa named by Thomas C.
