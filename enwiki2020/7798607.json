Team Cosmoranger J9 is assembled with Isaac Godonov, Blaster Kid, Steven Bowie, and Angel Omachi fighting the underworld scourge throughout the solar system. With the robot Braiger, they are a mercenary team that will handle any missions the police will not handle.

Through Khamen Khamen, Nubia hatches a plan to rule the solar system in which Jupiter is destroyed, leading to the creation of over 30 smaller planets that could sustain life.
