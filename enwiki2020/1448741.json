Bumpety Boo, the fun-loving car, makes friends with Ken. Teaming up seems like a natural thing, but Bumpety Boo does not count on Ken's adventurous eight-year- old spirit. Throughout the series, Dr. Monkey tries to steal Bumpety Boo from Ken. During their expedition, they have great adventures and help a lot of people they encounter on their way. They also encounter other talking cars. Bumpety Boo usually races them and always wins because of his strength and speed, which he receives after he smells flowers. In the end of the series the group finds his mother. ==Regional releases== In the early 1990s, there were several VHS tapes that had episodes of the show dubbed in English by Saban Entertainment.
