Originally, the Sanskrit word for lion, variously transliterated as Simha or Singh was used as a title by Kshatriya warriors in northern parts of India. The earliest recorded examples of the names ending with \"Simha\" are the names of the two sons of the Saka ruler Rudraraman in the second century CE. Jayasimha, the first ruler of the Chalukya dynasty to bear the title Simha, ruled around 500 CE. The Vengi branch of the Chalukyas continued using Simha as the last name till the eleventh century. The Rajputs started using Singh in preference to the classical epithet of \"Varman\". Among the Rajputs, the use of the word Simha came into vogue among the Paramaras of Malwa in 10th century CE, among the Guhilots and the Kachwahas of Narwar in the 12th century CE, and the Rathores of Marwar after the 17th century. By the sixteenth century, \"Singh\" had become a popular surname among Rajputs. It was adopted by the Sikhs in 1699, as per the instructions of Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Singh is used by all baptized male Sikhs, regardless of their geographical or cultural binding; the women use Kaur.A History of the Sikh People (1469-1988) by Dr. Gopal Singh In the 18th century, several groups started using the title \"Singh\". These included the Brahmins, the Kayasthas and the Baniyas of what are now Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. In the 19th century, even the Bengal court peons of the lower castes adopted the title \"Singh\". Bhumihars, who originally used Brahmin surnames, also started affixing Singh to their names. In Bihar and Jharkhand, the surname came to associated with power and authority, and was adopted by people of multiple castes, including Brahmin zamindars. Ahir (Yadav) used 'Singh' as part of their name. People belonging to several other castes and communities have also used Singh as a title, middle name or a surname; these include non-Sikh Punjabis, Gujjars (e.g. Nirbhay Singh Gujjar), Marathas (e.g. Pratap Singh Rao Gaekwad) and Hindu Jats, (e.g. Bhim Singh Rana), Sikh Jats,(e.g. Maharaja Ranjit Singh). The surname 'Singh' is used by many caste groups in Bihar. The name is also found among the Indian diaspora. For example, taking advantage of the fact that there was no reliable way to ascertain a person's caste, some of the low-caste Indian indentured labourers brought to British Guiana adopted the surname \"Singh\", claiming to be high-caste Kshatriyas. == Usage == \"Singh\" is generally used as a surname (e.g. Manmohan Singh or Yuvraj Singh) or as a middle name/title (e.g. Mulayam Singh Yadav, Mahendra Singh Dhoni). When used as a middle name, it is generally followed by the caste, clan or family name.Khushwant Singh, A History of the Sikhs, Volume I To stop the practice of caste system in Sikhism, some Sikhs append \"Khalsa\" to Singh (e.g. Harinder Singh Khalsa). Some Sikhs add the names of their native villages instead (e.g. Harcharan Singh Longowal, after Longowal). Originally, a common practice among the Rajput men was to have \"Singh\" as their last name, while Rajput women had the last name 'Kanwar'. However, now, many Rajput women have Singh in their name (e.g.Prashanti Singh) as well.Kolff, Dirk H.A., The Rajput of Ancient and Medieval North India: A Warrior-Ascetic; Folk, Faith and Feudalism, edited by NK Singh and Rajendra Joshi, Institute of Rajasthan Studies, Jaipur, India. Rawat Publications, Jaipur and New Delhi. === Outside South Asia === A section of around a million adherents of Sikhism that live abroad in Western countries only keep Singh or Kaur as their last name. This has caused legal problems in immigration procedures, especially in Canada. For a decade, the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi stated in letters to its Sikh clients that \"the names Kaur and Singh do not qualify for the purpose of immigration to Canada\", requiring people with these surnames to adopt new ones. The ban was denounced by the Sikh community, after which the Citizenship and Immigration Canada announced it was dropping the policy, calling the whole issue a misunderstanding based on a \"poorly worded\" letter. ==See also== * List of people with surname Singh * Singh v Canada, a Supreme Court of Canada case on the applicability of Charter rights to refugee claimants * Sinha == References == Category:Indian family names Category:Pakistani names Category:Titles in India Category:Sikh names Category:Punjabi-language surnames ",
