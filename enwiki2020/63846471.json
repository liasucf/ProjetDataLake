Formerly a multi-sports club, in 1993 SK Wing became an umbrella team for various independent sports sections. The children's club Fremad was founded on 24 August 1924, practising association football. On 13 May 1935 it was merged with Kamp\u00f8rn (founded 1928) to form SK Wing. Their sports codes became football, track and field, ice hockey, weightlifting and from 1938 orienteering. Among their members was Ernst Larsen. In the 1980s, Wing also had a successful handball team for men.Among the players were Morten Sch\u00f8nfeldt. In 1993, the different sport codes were demerged into independent sections.

Wing OK co-hosted the 2010 World Orienteering Championships. ==References== * Official site, Wing OK Category:Sport in Trondheim Category:1924 establishments in Norway Category:Sports clubs established in 1924 Category:Orienteering clubs in Norway Category:Defunct athletics clubs in Norway Category:Defunct football clubs in Norway Category:Multi-sport clubs in Norway ",
