    "text": "The Santiago\u2013Valpara\u00edso railway is a railway line linking the Chilean capital city Santiago with the port city of Valpara\u00edso. ==History== The existing rail line between Santiago and Valpara\u00edso was opened in 1863, and is long, single- track and designed to avoid steep gradients through mountainous terrain. Passenger service ceased on this line in 1987, and freight traffic almost non- existent since then. Proposals have existed since the 1990s to build a more direct line between the two cities for passengers and freight. The section from Valpara\u00edso to Limache was doubled and put underground in Vi\u00f1a del Mar as part of the Valpara\u00edso Metro. ==Current proposals== Proposed routes for a new Santiago\u2013Valpara\u00edso line A study commissioned by EFE in 2016 outlined three different potential routes for a new Santiago\u2013Valpara\u00edso line, using the Chilean rail network's existing Indian gauge, and cost between US$4\u20135 billion. In 2018, a proposal was submitted by the Tren Valpara\u00edso Santiago consortium of local firm Sigdo Koppers and China Railway Engineering Corporation. The US$2.5 billion plan consisted of a line with four stations to be designed for passenger trains to run at up to , offering an end-to-end journey time of 45 min, around half the time currently taken by road. The line would also be suitable for freight trains operating at up to . ==References== ==External links== * Tren Valpara\u00edso Santiago - Official site Category:Transport in Chile Category:Rail transport in Chile Category:Proposed railway lines Category:Railway lines opened in 1863 ",
