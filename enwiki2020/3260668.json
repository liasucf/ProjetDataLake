The National Industrial Act and Emergency Relief Appropriations Act, which passed Congress in 1933 and 1935, gave the federal government authority to buy failed cropland, and the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937 gave authority to transfer about to the Soil Conservation Service to restore the eroded soil and to protect the grasslands. In 1960, Congress approved the creation of KNG and RBNG.Hazlett, Donald L.; Schiebout, Michael H.; and Ford, Paulette L. (2009).
