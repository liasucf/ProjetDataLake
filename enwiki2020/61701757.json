    "text": "Thalab (), whose kunya was Ab\u016b al-Abb\u0101s A\u1e25mad ibn Ya\u1e25y\u0101 () (815 \u2013 904) was a renowned authority on grammar, a muhaddith (traditionist), a reciter of poetry, and first scholar of the school of al-K\u016bfah, and later at Baghd\u0101d. He was a keen rival of Al-Mubarrad, the head of the school of al-Ba\u1e63rah. Thalab supplied much biographic detail about his contemporary philologists found in the biographical dictionaries produced by later biographers. ==Life== Ab\u016b al- Abb\u0101s Thalab was born in Baghd\u0101d and Ibn al-Kar\u0101b in his Tar\u012bkh ('History') gives his date of birth as October 815 [third month, 200 AH], others give 816 or 819 [201 AH or 204 AH]. Thalab recalled seeing, as a child of four years, the caliph al-Mam\u016bn arriving back to the city from Khur\u0101s\u0101n in 819/20 (204 AH). The Caliph processed from the Iron Gate towards the Palace of al-Ru\u1e63\u0101fah, and the crowds were lined up as far as al-Mu\u1e63alla. Thalab remembered clearly the occasion when the caliph raised him up from his father's arms and said, 'This is al-Mam\u016bn.' Thalab was adopted by the military-leader-come-poet Man ibn Z\u0101idah, of the Ban\u016b Shayb\u0101n, and became a leading grammarian, philologist traditionist of the K\u016bfah school. Thalab recalled his interest in Arabic studies, poetry, and language had begun in 831 (216 AH) at age sixteen and that he had memorised to the letter all of al-Farr\u0101s works, including Al- Hud\u016bd, by the age of twenty-five. His primary focus was on grammar, poetry, rhetoric, and Al-Nawadir (Strange Forms). He associated with, and counselled, Ibn al-Ar\u0101b\u012b for about ten years. Thalab describes an occasion being at the home of A\u1e25mad ibn Sa\u012bd with a group of scholars, amongst whom were al-Sukkar\u012b and Ab\u016b al-\u0100liyah. Critiquing the meaning of a poem by al-Shamm\u0101kh, Ibn al-A'r\u0101b\u012b and A\u1e25mad ibn Sa\u012bd showed surprise at Thalab's confidence. In another anecdote, related by Ab\u016b Bakr A\u1e25mad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 ibn Muj\u0101hid al-Mukri, Thalab once expressed concern for his soul as a disciple of Ab\u016b Zayd Said ibn Aws al-An\u1e63\u0101r\u012b (d.830) and Ab\u016b Amr ibn al-Al\u0101 (d.770), over the exegetes, traditionists and fuqaha (jurists). However Ibn Mujahid then told him of his dream wherein the Prophet had sent a message to Thalab that his was the superior science. Ab\u016b Abd All\u0101h al-R\u016bdb\u0101ri interpreted this to mean that the study of oral language is above all the other sciences \u2013 tafsir (exegesis), \u1e24ad\u012bth (tradition), fiqh (Law) \u2013 as it perfects and connects these to discourse. Thalab, was invited but declined to take a commission by the vizier al-Q\u0101sim to write a commentary on the book Compendium of Speech by Ma\u1e25barah al-Nad\u012bm, which the caliph Al-Muta\u1e0did had ordered. He offered instead to work on the Kit\u0101b al-Ayn of al-Khal\u012bl, and the commission went to Al-Zajjaj. On 30th March or 6th April 904 (17 or 10 Jumada al-Awwal 291 AH), being quite deaf, he was knocked down by a horse while walking in the street and died the next day. He was buried in the vicinity of his house near the Damascus Gate in Baghd\u0101d. ===Thalab's Teachers=== *Ibn al-Ar\u0101b\u012b *Al-Zubayr ibn Bakk\u0101r (d.870) *A\u1e25mad ibn Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, Ab\u016b al-\u1e24asan, a calligrapher grammarian, not an author. ==Works== Among his books there were: *Kit\u0101b al-Mu\u1e63\u016bn f\u012b al-Nahw wa-Jaalah Hud\u016bd\u0101n () What is \"Precious\" (Preserved) in Grammar, which he wrote in the form of definitions (\u1e25ud\u016bd); *Kit\u0101b Ikhtil\u0101f al-al-Na\u1e25w\u012by\u012bn () Points on which grammarians disagree; *Kit\u0101b Ma\u02bb\u0101n\u012b al-Qur\u02bc\u0101n () The Meaning of the Qur\u0101n; *Kit\u0101b al-Muwaffaqa Mukhta\u1e63ir f\u012b al-Nahw () The Favoured, an abridgment of grammar; *Kit\u0101b m\u0101 yula\u1e25an f\u012bh\u012b al-\u0100mma () Faulty Expressions in popular use; *Kit\u0101b al-Qir\u0101\u0101t () Differences between the Seven Readings of the Qur\u0101n; *Kit\u0101b Ma\u02bb\u0101n\u012b al-\u0160ir () Rare ideas in ancient Arabic poetry; *Kit\u0101b al-Ta\u1e63g\u012br () Diminutive Nouns; *Kit\u0101b m\u0101 Yan\u1e63arif wa m\u0101 l\u0101 Yan\u1e63aruf () What Is Declined and What Is Not Declined; Parts of Speech which form or do not form other functions; *Kit\u0101b m\u0101 Yujz\u0101 wa m\u0101 l\u0101 Yujz\u0101 () What Is Grammatical and What Is Not Grammatical; Nouns of first declension; *Kit\u0101b al-\u0160aw\u0101dd () Exceptions; *Kit\u0101b al-Amth\u0101l () Similes; Collection of Proverbs; *Kit\u0101b al-Aiman wa al- Dawah\u0101 () Oaths and Calamities; *Kit\u0101b al-Waqf wa al-Ibtid\u0101 () Start and End of Phrases; *Kit\u0101b al-Istikhraj al-Alf\u0101z min al-Akhb\u0101r () The Derivation of Expressions from Legends (Historical Traditions); *Kit\u0101b al-Hij\u0101 () Spelling; *Kit\u0101b al-Awsat Ra'a\u012btah () Grammar of medium extent; *Kit\u0101b Ghura\u012bb al-Qur\u0101n La\u1e6d\u012bf () The Excellent Book of the Strange in the Qur\u0101n; *Kit\u0101b al-Mas\u0101il () Questions discussed; *Kit\u0101b \u1e25add al-Nahw () Definitions of Grammar; *Kit\u0101b Tafs\u012br Kal\u0101m Ibnat al-Khusa () Exposition of the Statement of Ibnat al-Khus [Hind]; *Kit\u0101b al-Fa\u1e63\u012b\u1e25 () Eloquent Style (the Pure), on philology; *Kit\u0101b al- Tafs\u012br al-Qur\u0101n () Parsing the Qur\u0101n; *Kit\u0101b al-Qir\u0101\u0101t li-Thalab () Al-Qir\u0101ah of Thalab (Qur\u0101nic Readings); ==Legacy== Thalab is cited as a source for biographies of the following ::Grammarians of Ba\u1e63rah - Y\u016bnus ibn \u1e24ab\u012bb, S\u012bbawayh Ab\u016b Ubaydah, al-A\u1e63ma\u012b, Al-Athram, ::Grammarians of Kufa - al-Ru\u0101s\u012b, Al-Zajj\u0101j who wrote the commentary of the Compendium of Speech. ===Thalab's Disciples (pupils)=== Ab\u016b al-Abb\u0101s Thalab dictated his discourses on grammar, language, historical traditions, the tafsir (Qur\u0101nic exegesis), and poetry to his pupils who transmitted his works.
