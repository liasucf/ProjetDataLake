    "text": "is an upcoming Japanese animated film directed by Hayao Miyazaki and animated by Studio Ghibli. The film is named after the 1937 novel of the same name written by Yoshino Genzaburo. ==Premise== The film centers around how a particular book, titled How Do You Live?, features prominently in the protagonist's life. == Production == Miyazaki commenced animation work in July 2016, later confirmed by studio executive Toshio Suzuki. With Miyazaki coming out of retirement, Studio Ghibli re-opened with many of the past collaborators working on the project. Numerous contracts for three-year terms were issued. In October 2017, Studio Ghibli announced the film will be titled How Do You Live? Toshio Suzuki said that Miyazaki is working on the film for his grandson as his way of saying \"Grandpa is moving onto the next world soon but he is leaving this film behind because he loves you\". A release date has not been announced, although the film was at one point intended to be released near the time of the 2020 Summer Olympics. Suzuki said in August 2018 the projections were for 2021 or 2022 completion. In a late 2019 interview with NHK, Miyazaki stated that the film is not to be expected anytime soon; he said that in his younger age he used to produce 10 minutes of animation every month, but now his speed is reduced to 1 minute per month. As of October 2019, the film was confirmed to be 15% complete. In May 2020, Suzuki told Entertainment Weekly that 60 animators were working on the film; 36 minutes of the film had been completed after three years of production. Suzuki said \"we are still hand- drawing everything, but it takes us more time to complete a film because we're drawing more frames\" and they are \"hoping it will finish in the next three years.\" == References == ==External links== * Category:Films directed by Hayao Miyazaki Category:Films set in Japan Category:Studio Ghibli animated films Category:2020s animated films ",
