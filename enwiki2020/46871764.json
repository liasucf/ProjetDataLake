It premiered at the Hawaii International Film Festival and aired on Independent Lens, a PBS program, in May 2015. ==Synopsis== Hina Wong-Kalu is a m\u0101h\u016b - a Native Hawaiian kumu (teacher), activist and cultural icon. She lives her life \"in the middle\", in between the traditional ways of Hawaii's indigenous, third gender, m\u0101h\u016b culture, and as a modern transgender person in contemporary Hawaii, trying to preserve and pass on the indigenous culture to the younger generations. During the year covered by the film, Kumu Hina mentors one of the girl students who also finds herself \"in the middle\" when she wants to join the all-male hula group in her school. The film also follows Kumu Hina's personal life as she seeks a committed romantic relationship with a younger man from Tonga, and we travel with her into the hills to meet her elders, the traditional third gender m\u0101h\u016b who live together on the land and provide her with spiritual guidance. ==Reception== Kumu Hina won the Documentary Jury award at the Frameline Film Festival http://blogs.indiewire.com/bent/the-film-that-charmed-frameline-the-reasons- why-award-winning-indie-documentary-kumu-hina-deserves-a-wide-audience-are- precisely-why-it-might-miss-out-20140717 and the Audience Award as the most popular documentary among voting viewers for the 2014\u20132015 season of Independent Lens.https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/and-the-winner-of- the-2014-2015-independent-lens-audience-award-is/ In 2016, the film won Outstanding Documentary from the GLAAD Media Awards.http://www.glaad.org/mediaawards/nominees Filmmaker Magazine called the film \"a stunning eye-opener\",http://filmmakermagazine.com/86837-transformers- the-asian-american-international-film-festival/#.U9BGPUjPbW4 while Indiewire considered it \"incredibly poignant and moving\", and Yes!
