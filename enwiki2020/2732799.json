He won a silver medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as a silver medal at the 1997 World Championships, both in 4 x 100 metres relay. He also won a 60 metres silver medal at the 1997 World Indoor Championships. In 100 metres his personal best time is 9.94 seconds, although he has recorded 9.91 s, albeit with a doubtful wind reading of -2.3 m/s which is an unlikely weather condition for records. In any case his result ranks him second in Nigeria, behind Olusoji Fasuba, and third in Africa, behind Fasuba and Frankie Fredericks.Commonwealth All-Time Lists (Men) - GBR Athletics His personal best 200 metres time is 20.30 seconds, from 1990.
