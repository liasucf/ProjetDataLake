    "text": "Within These Walls is a British television drama programme made by London Weekend Television for ITV and shown between 1974 and 1978. It portrayed life in HMP Stone Park, a fictional women's prison. Unlike the later women-in- prison TV series Prisoner (aka Prisoner: Cell Block H, original run 1979-1986) and Bad Girls (1999\u20132006), Within These Walls tended to centre its storylines around the prison staff rather than the inmates. The lead character was the well-groomed, genteel governor Faye Boswell (Googie Withers), and episodes revolved around her attempts to liberalise the prison regime while managing her personal life at home. Another prominent character was her Chief Officer, Mrs. Armitage (Mona Bruce). Googie Withers left after three series; in Series Four her character was replaced as governor by Helen Forrester (Katharine Blake), who in turn left to be replaced in the final Series Five by Susan Marshall (Sarah Lawson). The creator and writer of the programme, David Butler, played the prison chaplain,Hayward, Anthony. \"David Butler\u2014Writer of TV historical dramas\" (The Independent, 8 June 2006) the Rev Henry Prentice, in some episodes.
