    "text": "The Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (WPIAL) is an interscholastic athletic association in Western Pennsylvania. It is District 7 of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association. ==History== The Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League (WPIAL) was founded in 1907 by a group of educators from four public and private Pittsburgh schools who sought increased regulation and governance of student athletic eligibility and interscholastic athletic competition. The founding schools in the league included Shady Side Academy, Allegheny Prep, Pittsburgh Fifth Avenue High School, and Pittsburgh Central High School. William R. Crabbe of Shady Side Academy acted as a central force in the formation of the League and served as its first president. At its inception the league was poorly received by the public and the press, and found it difficult to enforce its rules. However, the league slowly spread throughout the Pittsburgh area. The league controlled the growth to small numbers that they could handle. As such, the only organization absorbed as a whole was the old Allegheny Valley League. Following the local success of WPIAL, the idea was brought to the whole state in 1914 when the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA) was founded. Within PIAA, WPIAL has been designated as District 7, and since 1982, WPIAL/District 7. Although officially known as District 7, the WPIAL is grandfathered to keep the older name due to it predating the PIAA. Originally numbering three high schools, WPIAL had a high of 156 participating school as late as the 1981\u201382 school year. As of October 2012, there are 137 high schools and 148 junior high school members in the WPIAL. ==Member schools== The league is responsible for administering the interscholastic athletic participation/competition of public school districts and private schools located in Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Lawrence, Washington, Westmoreland counties in Western Pennsylvania. Exceptions as of the 2015\u201316 school year include: *Ligonier Valley School District in Westmoreland County participates in District 6. *Slippery Rock Area School District and Moniteau School District in Butler County participate in District 10 and District 9 respectively. *Wilmington Area School District in Lawrence and Mercer counties participates in District 10. *Since 2012, four high schools from Pittsburgh Public Schools in Allegheny County, which makes up PIAA District 8, compete in the WPIAL for baseball, softball, soccer, swimming, tennis, golf, and cross country. *Altoona Area High School and Hollidaysburg Area High School in Blair County were granted \"conditional membership\" for football and began competing in District 7 in 2013. The condition stated: If the PIAA does approve an expansion from four to six classifications in football, the WPIAL will look at its alignments to see if the schools' inclusion will benefit the WPIAL's scheduling.\" Such an expansion was approved to take effect for the 2016\u201317 school year. Hollidaysburg intended to leave District 7 after the conclusion of the 2015\u201316 season. ==Sports== :Note: While some sports are dominated by one sex, there is no rule that mandates sex segregation in PIAA sports, even if a school has teams for each sex.
