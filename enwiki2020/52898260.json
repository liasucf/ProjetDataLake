We have all shared way too many intense, insane, crazy hard times together (many of which ended up as astonishingly good journalism) to think that these departures won't make us cry. I'm tearing up already. Murphy mentioned numerous names of many longtime veterans who would be leaving, such as, \"David Zucchino, one of the best war correspondents of our generation. No need to say more--everybody knows David Zucchino. I'm not even going to talk about how sick I am he's leaving\". Murphy ended her memo that \"We are not dead yet. We'll move on--after taking this day to wish all the very best to our departing colleagues as they with trepidation prepare for their exciting \"next chapters.\" A huge virtual hug to all\". ==Awards== Murphy won the Pulitzer Prize in 2005 for International Reporting for \"her eloquent, wide ranging coverage of Russia's struggle to cope with terrorism, improve the economy and make democracy work\".
