Archived from the original on May 20, 2014. was an American writer, editor, and publisher. He founded and served as president of Byron Preiss Visual Publications, and later of ibooks Inc. ==Biography== ===Early life and career=== A native of Brooklyn, New York City, Byron Preiss graduated magna cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania in 1972, and earned a master's degree in communications from Stanford University. In 1971, while Preiss was teaching at a Philadelphia elementary school, he conceived, and with Jim Steranko, produced an anti-drug comic book, The Block, designed for low-level reading skills. Published by Steranko's company, Supergraphics, it was distributed to schools nationwide. Additional , June 20, 2011. He founded Byron Preiss Visual Publications in 1974 to publish original works, including Weird Heroes (1975). His 1976 Fiction Illustrated series of illustrated novels began with Schlomo Raven: Public Detective, a Preiss collaboration with Tom Sutton, followed by Starfawn, illustrated by Stephen Fabian, Steranko's Chandler: Red Tide and the 1977 Son of Sherlock Holmes, illustrated by Ralph Reese. Other publications included a 1978 adaptation of Alfred Bester's The Stars My Destination as a two-volume graphic novel, illustrated by Howard Chaykin. ===Publishing career=== As a book packager, he developed titles for such publishers as HarperCollins and Random House. One such project, created in conjunction with the Bank Street College of Education, resulted in a series of educational comic books adapting well-known genre authors: The Bank Street Book of Creepy Tales, The Bank Street Book of Fantasy, The Bank Street Book of Mystery and The Bank Street Book of Science Fiction. He published children's books by celebrities, including Billy Crystal, Jane Goodall, Jay Leno, LeAnn Rimes and Jerry Seinfeld, and worked closely with such established illustrators as Ralph Reese, William Stout and Tom Sutton. Preiss was co- author, with Michael Reaves, of the children's novel Dragonworld (Doubleday, 1979), with 80 illustrations by Joseph Zucker. Dragonworld was originally planned to be the fifth \"Fiction Illustrated\" title. In 1982, Preiss published The Secret, a puzzle book that combined 12 short verses and 12 elaborate fantasy paintings by John Jude Palencar. Readers were expected to pair each painting with a verse in a way that would provide clues to finding one of 12 plexiglass boxes buried in various parks around North America. Each box contained a ceramic box that contained a key that could be redeemed for a jewel worth $1,000. The book was inspired by the success of Masquerade, written and illustrated by Kit Williams and published in England in August 1979, but The Secret never led to the same level of treasure hunting frenzy. One of the ceramic boxes was found in Chicago in 1983, one in Cleveland in 2004, and one in Boston in October 2019.Hidden treasure, a family's quest, and \"The Secret\" The remaining nine boxes have yet to be found, and reportedly Preiss was the only one who knew where they were when he died. Beyond traditional printed books, Preiss frequently embraced emerging technologies, and was among the first to publish in such electronic forms as CD-ROM books and ebooks. The Words of Gandhi, an audiobook he produced, won a Grammy Award in 1985. ===Later life and death=== Preiss was married to Sandi Mendelson, with whom he had daughters Karah and Blaire. On July 9, 2005, he died in a traffic accident at East Hampton, New York, on Long Island. Both Byron Preiss Visual Publications and ibooks Inc. filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy on February 22, 2006, after his death. ==List of Byron Preiss publications== Published by Preiss, or packaged by Preiss for other publishers *The Electric Company Joke Book (1973) *The Silent e's from Outer Space (Western Pub., 1973; Goldencraft, 1974 ) *One Year Affair (1976) *Weird Heroes (Pyramid Books, 1975\u201377) ::Vol. 1 () to Vol. 8 (); collections of illustrated, pulp-inspired stories *Fiction Illustrated #1 \u2013 Schlomo Raven: Public Detective (Pyramid Books, 1976; by Preiss and Tom Sutton) *Fiction Illustrated #2 \u2013 Starfawn (Pyramid Books, 1976; by Preiss and Stephen Fabian) *Fiction Illustrated #3 \u2013 Chandler: Red Tide (Pyramid Books, 1976 ; Dark Horse, 2001 ) *Fiction Illustrated #4 \u2013 Son of Sherlock Holmes (Pyramid Books, 1977; by Preiss and Ralph Reese) *Empire (1978) by Samuel R.
