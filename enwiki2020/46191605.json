Chicopee is killed in a rig accident, however, and rival Mike Rawlins then sabotages the rig. Things get worse for Johnny when con artists Nan and Oliver turn up. She pretends to be Chicopee's sister, so Johnny gullibly gives her the half-interest in his oil rig. Rawlins buys up Johnny's outstanding debts and intends to take over. In an act of desperation, Johnny uses nitroglycerine to blast open an oil well, resulting in a gusher. An explosion ends up knocking Rawlins unconscious and pinning Johnny beneath the wreckage, but Nan, having fallen in love with Johnny, comes to his rescue. ==Cast== *Richard Arlen as Johnny Maverick *Arline Judge as Nan Deering *William Frawley as Oliver Westbrook *Buster Crabbe as Mike Rawlins *Arthur Hunnicutt as 'Watchfob' Jones *Elisha Cook, Jr. as Harold 'Chicopee' Nevins *Ralph Sanford as 'Grits' O'Malley *Alec Craig as Joseph D.
