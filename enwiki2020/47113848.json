This edition was notable for its chaotic development and the fact that Athletic Bilbao won the trophy without playing a game. ==Match details== Athletic Bilbao automatically qualified for the final. Club Espa\u00f1ol de Madrid had tied one game and had not completed the other game in 1904 Copa del Rey, which led Athletic to file a complaint. Faced with this problem and unable to quickly solve the case, coupled with the rush of players from the Basque club to return to their occupations, the Madrid Association decided to award the cup to Athletic as defending champions. ==References== Category:Copa del Rey Finals Copa Category:Athletic Bilbao matches Category:Club Espa\u00f1ol de Madrid matches ",
