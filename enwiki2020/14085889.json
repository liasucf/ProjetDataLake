    "text": "Paulo Pedroso, 2009 Paulo Pedroso (born 28 April 1965 in Aveiro, Portugal) is a Portuguese professor, politician, member of the Portuguese Parliament, and former Secretary of State and Minister for Labor and Training from 1999 to 2001. Pedroso graduated from ISCTE in Lisbon and became a professor at the same institution. As Secretary of State and Minister for Labor and Training of Portugal from 1999 to 2001, professor, politician and member of the Portuguese Parliament, he promoted a guarantee minimum income policy for unemployed Portuguese in order to combat poverty (Rendimento M\u00ednimo Garantido). Pedroso was involved in what became known as the Casa Pia child sexual abuse scandal, but the charges against him were dropped. Paulo Pedroso requested a compensation of 600,000 euros from the Portuguese Republic on the grounds that his arrest was illegal and destroyed his political career. In September 2008, a Portuguese court ordered the state to pay 100,000 euros ($140,000) to the ex-minister on the grounds that he was wrongly detained on paedophilia charges. Pedroso returned to the Portuguese Parliament shortly after, as a parliamentary member of his party, Partido Socialista. On June 12, The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has condemned the Portuguese State over its treatment of former Socialist minister Paulo Pedroso, \u201cunderstanding that at the moment of his arrest there did not exist sufficient proof that (he) had committed crimes of sexual abuse of minors, as related by the youngsters\u201d. The court has ordered the State to pay around 68,000 euros. ==References== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Government ministers of Portugal Category:Socialist Party (Portugal) politicians Category:Members of the Assembly of the Republic (Portugal) ",
