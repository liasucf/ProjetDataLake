It was first performed in 1912 by the Peel Players and it is considered to be one of the earliest and most frequently performed pieces in the Manx dialect repertoire. ==Background== From 1908 Sophia Morrison had been producing Manx dialect theatre at Manx Language Society entertainments in Peel.'Peel Entertainment', Peel City Guardian 25 April 1908 These had been written by Cushag and John Quine initially, but in 1912 Sophia Morrison commissioned Christopher Shimmin to write the plays.'Shiaght Laa' interview broadcast on Manx Radio, 04 January 2017 Morrison plotted out the action of The Charm and Shimmin wrote it, before it was rehearsed in her home on Athol Street, Peel. When it was produced in November 1912, it was a new venture for the Manx Language Society, in that it was their first event consisting solely of plays, without other items on the stage. ==Plot== Jem and Kirrie Quilliam are unhappily married due to his unreasonable expectations of her. Kirrie mentions this to Pyee, a travelling beggar woman and dealer in charms, who suggests that she might be able to offer a solution. Kirrie follows her direction and puts a herb into Jem's tea, which brings them both to fall into a deep sleep. When they awake their roles are reversed, with Kirree asking unreasonable levels of work from Jem. Pyee returns and this time Jem asks for a herb to remedy the situation, which she provides. After another sleep, the couple awake happily in love again. The play closes with Kirree on Jem's knee. ==Early performances== Sophia Morrison, producer of the first production of The Charm The play was first performed in the Centenary Hall in Peel on 7 November 1912, alongside Illiam Kodhere's Will, also by Christopher Shimmin.'Successful Production of Two New Manx Plays', Peel City Guardian 9 November 1912 The event was organised by Sophia Morrison in aid of the Manx Language Society. The hall was 'packed' and the plays receiving an 'enthusiastic reception,' with The Charm being said to have 'caused great laughter, from start to finish.' In the curtain call that followed the performance, Shimmin took to the stage and delivered a short speech. In this he emphasised the specifically Manx element of the production, which was important to the building of Manx identity underway at that time: > Mr. Shimmin thanked the audience for their kind reception. He was a Manxman, > and that was one of the few things he had to be proud of. There was one > point he was very pleased of \u2013 the promoters, the players, Miss Morrison, > and himself, were all Manx. The actors involved in the production were: Tom Dodd, Annie V. Caine, John J. Joughin and Amelia Keegan.The Charm on ManxLiterature.com (accessed January 2017) Under Sophia Morrion's direction, they took on the name of The Peel Players ahead of their repeat performances.'Fixtures', Mona's Herald 13 November 1912 After a performance in Ramsey,(Untitled article) Peel City Guardian 7 December 1912 the plays were produced at the Gaiety Theatre in Douglas in January 1913 - a performance referred to as 'a complete success.'(Untitled article) Peel City Guardian 1 February 1913 This performance had the distinction of attracting the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Lord Raglan, to attend.'The Peel Players in Douglas', Isle of Man Examiner 18 January 1913 The Peel Players then took their production of Shimmin's plays to the David Lewis' Theatre in Liverpool for the Liverpool Manx Society, where it was reported (by Sophia Morrison) that \"There was a crowded house.
