Many of Zoubareva's relatives on her father's side are artists and musicians, including her aunts: the late Irina Kalik, a ballerina at the Stanislavski and Nemirovich-Danchenko Moscow Academic Music Theatre, Galina Soboleva, a music critic and a publishing author and Elena G. Zoubareva, a radio music editor. Zoubareva's father, Ivan Zoubarev, was awarded the title Distinguished or Meritorious Artist of Russia. Zoubareva's early music education was overseen by her father. She learned to read music before learning to read words. At the age of 6 she entered a formal music school, studying classical singing, piano, ear training, harmony and history of music. Since the beginning of her formal music education, Zoubareva has specialised in audiation, which refers to the ability to mentally remember and hear music, without the actual physical presence of sound. At the age of 8 she sang the title role in a children's opera Thumbelina. At the age of 15 she performed at the Moscow Army Theater. After graduating from Boris Tchaikovsky Moscow Music school, Zoubareva was accepted simultaneously at the Ippolitov-Ivanov Music College in Moscow to study classical singing and at Moscow State University to study journalism. After the untimely death of her father, as a result of a psychological trauma Elena developed functional dysphonia. The lack of a comprehensive treatment in Russia resulted in ultimate loss of her voice which forced Zoubareva to quit Music College and pause her singing career, ==Career== Zoubareva\u2019s voice gradually returned several years later and she resumed private lessons with Lydia Kovaleva, a former star of the Bolshoi Opera Theater. Zoubareva credits Madame Kovaleva for fully restoring her voice. While visiting the US for the first time on a business trip under the invitation of the US Meat Export Federation, Zoubareva arranged a consultation with a renowned US voice instructor Dave Stroud. Impressed with Zoubareva's voice and interpretive abilities, Stroud encouraged her to restore her professional singing career.

Elena's teachers at Berklee included, among others, her voice professor Kathryn Wright and her stage performance technique teacher, Livingston Taylor. Upon graduation, Zoubareva recorded and released her first full-length CD, La Tempesta Di Mare.

In 2009 Zoubareva recorded her second CD, Allure, produced by Grammy-nominated producer Jonathan Wyner, of M-Works.
