The site operated as TACAN Channel 77. On 25 December 1967 the site was attacked by the People's Army of Vietnam who overran the facility killing the two \"sheep- dipped\" technicians from the 1st Mobile Communications Group. A replacement TACAN site was installed at Mukdahan, Thailand. ==Current use== The site is abandoned and turned over to farmland and housing. ==See also== *Lima Site 85 ==References== Category:Military installations of the United States in Laos Category:Military installations closed in 1967 ",
