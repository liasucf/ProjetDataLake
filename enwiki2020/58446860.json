The fastback is based on the Geely BMA Platform. It's the first vehicle based on the platform.. The new car carries the 133 hp Geely G-Power 14T (manual and CVT models) engine and 136 hp Geely G-Power 200T (DCT models) engine. Binrui provides self-driving on level 2, which equipped autonomous cruise control. It's also possible to free hands from the steering wheel with the lane support system. Since this is only a assisted system, the computer would warn the driver after a few minutes or the lane support system could not find the track. The self-driving system is not able to overtake and switch lane. ==Background== Geely Binrui rear In May 2018, Geely published a \"A06\" model and named it Geely SL. It sets its position as a sport sedan based on Geely Emgrand GL. The new car should be able to face the need of young people. The outward appearance of fastback body style and the headlight takes ideas from Geely Borui GE. Binrui seemed much too similar to Geely Emgrand GL, although the exterior and the technologies are quite different. ==Engines== There are two engines options available for the Geely Binrui, which include a 1.0 liter three-cylinder turbo engine producing 136 hp and a 1.4 liter turbo four- cylinder engine producing power of 133 hp.. Binrui CVT is sourced from Punch Transmission VT5 capable of up to 280 Nm of torque. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Sedans Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Binrui Category:Cars introduced in 2018 Category:Cars of China ",
