As Wade grew up in Houston, he got an early start reading the fantasy and science-fiction works of Tolkien and Robert A. Heinlein. After high school, he went to study at Oklahoma Christian College, but remained undecided on a major. He left college in 1989 to join the United States Air Force, where he still serves today. Even with working full-time and raising a family with wife Karin, Wade found time to write. He completed his first novel, a space opera called Electronic Echoes of the Mind, in 2001, which got picked up for publication by Mundania Press shortly thereafter. Wade is working on a sequel to Electronic Echoes of the Mind. ==External links== *Electronic Echoes website *Mundania Press Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:American male writers ",
