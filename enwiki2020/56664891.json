As a Croat from Bosnia-Herzegovina, during World War II he was a member of the ZAVNOBiH and was later appointed as a minister in the first government of People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1945 to 1946. ==Biography== Spu\u017eevi\u0107 was born into a Bosnian Croat family which had been honored and celebrated with verses by the 19th century Croatian poet S.S. Kranj\u010devi\u0107.Ivan Tomas, \u201cS. S. Kranj\u010devi\u0107 slavi Spu\u017eevi\u0107evu obitelj\u201d, Hrvatska revija (M\u00fcnchen; Barcelona) 32 (1982), br. 3: 577-578. Spu\u017eevi\u0107 graduated from Mostar Realgymnasium in 1901/2.Maja Miljkovi\u0107: \"Nacionalni identitet Srba i Hrvata u Mostaru u me\u0111uratnom periodu\", in: Dijalog povjesni\u010dara - istori\u010dara. knj. 3, Pe\u010duj, 12.-14. maja 2000. / ed. by Hans-Georg Fleck, Igor Graovac After completing his law studies, he practiced law in Mostar. He was close to the Catholic Church and his practice was also employed as a legal representative for Herzegovina Franciscan friars\u2019 in Kingdom of Yugoslavia.Papi\u0107, p.199 Spu\u017eevi\u0107 was active in politics and public life in general between the two world wars. Since 1910, he was a member of the Mostar branch of Croatian cultural society \"Napredak\", while in 1929 he was elected its vicepresident. For 1927 elections he opposed the policy of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) and founded Croatian National Union (HNZ) in opposition to it. In 1928 Spu\u017eevi\u0107 was also a founding member of the Fishermen society of Bosnia-Herzegovina branch in Mostar. In 1935 he was a board member of the Land bank of Bosnia-Herzegovina (Zemaljska banka za BiH).Dodatak \"Narodnom blagostanju\" br. 25, Beograd, 2. godina III. Zemaljska banka za Bosnu i Hercegovinu, Sarajevo === Second World War === During the German and Italian invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Spu\u017eevi\u0107 and his friend fra Leo Petrovi\u0107 organised negotiations between the surrendering Yugoslav army and invading Axis forces, still fighting in the Mostar area.Mandi\u0107, p.712 After the breakup of Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Axis puppet state Independent State of Croatia under Usta\u0161a regime was formed, encompassing Bosnia and Herzegovina. Soon, usta\u0161a campaign of ethnic cleansing, directed against Serb, Jewish and Roma population (as well as all Croat opponents and dissidents) reached Mostar. In July 1942, according to his diary, Spu\u017eevi\u0107 tried to intervene with the usta\u0161a minister of the interior Artukovi\u0107 to save some Mostar families, including Serbs, from the internment or execution. He also asked for an immediate release of the Serbs from usta\u0161a prisons and for a stop and reversal of racist and discriminatory usta\u0161a policies (lay-offs, expulsions etc.), as well as sanctions against those who committed crimes against the Serb population of eastern Herzegovina in the summer of 1941. Between 1942 and mid-1943, Spu\u017eevi\u0107, vicar fra Leo Petrovi\u0107, fra Bonicije Rup\u010di\u0107 and Mostar Serbs Milivoj Jela\u010di\u0107 and \u0110or\u0111e Obradovi\u0107 formed the Committee for the stricken persons, raising funds and food for the exiled, expelled, and vulnerable population in general. Most of the funds went to poverty-stricken Serbs of the area, which were discriminated and generally unwanted by the usta\u0161a authorities.Mandi\u0107, Hrvoje. \"Hercegova\u010dki franjevci i spa\u0161avanje \u017ertava usta\u0161kih progona u Mostaru 1941.\u20131943.\" \u010casopis za suvremenu povijest 48.3 (2016): 709-726., p.715 In 1943 and 1944, usta\u0161a authorities arrested, imprisoned and executed many of their opponents in Mostar area, especially the communists and anyone connected to Yugoslav partisans. Prominent pre-war members of the usta\u0161a-banned Croatian Peasant Party were also targeted, for instance dr. Ivica Milakovi\u0107 and Bla\u017e Sli\u0161kovi\u0107 (killed in Jasenovac Concentration camp). Spu\u017eevi\u0107 was saved by an intervention of fra Leo Petrovi\u0107, a prominent Franciscan friar well respected among the population and recognized as such by usta\u0161a authorities.Mandi\u0107, p.722 After this crackdown, in August 1944 guerilla Yugoslav partisans managed to evacuate Spu\u017eevi\u0107 from usta\u0161a-held Mostar and bring him to the territory they controlled, after Herzegovina Communist Party chairman Vaso Mi\u0161kin \u201cCrni\u201d organized an action together with fra Petrovi\u0107, who chose to stay in Mostar and look after Spu\u017eevi\u0107\u2019s family. Usually usta\u0161a would arrest and imprison or intern a family of someone who left to join the partisans, but Spu\u017eevi\u0107\u2019s family \u2013 thanks to fra Petrovi\u0107 - was an exception in Mostar. All three Spu\u017eevi\u0107\u2019s sons eventually left to join the partisans, too. Spu\u017eevi\u0107's cousin, judge dr. \u0110uro Spu\u017eevi\u0107, on the other hand, was a deputy county prefect of Vrhbosna countybr. 244 Izvje\u0161taj Velike \u017eupe Vrhbosna od 28 juna 1943 god. o situaciji na podru\u010dju isto\u010dne Bosne i zdravstvenom stanju u Sarajevu, Usta\u0161ko- domobranski dokumenti III, pp. 537-9 and later county prefect (Croatian: veliki \u017eupan) of Mostar-based Hum county in usta\u0161a regime (1942-5).Tomas, D.

HERCEGOVACKA DIVIZIJA === Communist Yugoslavia === 8th Dalmatian Partisan corps entering liberated Mostar, February 1945 After Mostar was liberated by the Partisans in February 1945, Spu\u017eevi\u0107 served as the vice-president of the county liberation committee, provisional authority for Mostar area. As a close friend of some prominent Mostar friars, he tried to intervene with other partisan authorities to enable the friars to exhume and rebury friars the partisans had shot in \u0160iroki Brijeg. Spu\u017eevi\u0107 also protested against the killings of the friars there, arguing that some of them were old and frail and most definitely did not carry arms or resist the partisans. His best friend, Franciscan provincial Leo Petrovi\u0107 was also shot in Mostar before Spu\u017eevi\u0107 entered the liberated town,fra Gaudencije Ivan\u010di\u0107: \u201cKako je ubijeno sedam fratara u Mostaru 14. velja\u010de 1945.\u201d, vecernji.ba, February 13, 2016 while he was still in \u010citluk. Spu\u017eevi\u0107 openly bemoaned this to the new authorities. Still, he expressed gratitude to the liberators of Mostar at a public rally. In front of Dalmatian and Herzegovinian partisan troops parading in Mostar, he decried those still not joining the National liberation army in their fight against the Axis, choosing instead to wait together with the fraction of pre-war Croatian Peasant Party and its chairman Vladko Ma\u010dek.Matovi\u0107, Ivo, Milan Grahovac, Stevan Petkovi\u0107, and Svetolik Stefanovi\u0107. Mostarska Operacija: U\u010desnici Govore : Okrugli Sto 13. Februar 1985. Beograd: Vojnoizdava\u010dki zavod, 1986 After the partisans liberated Sarajevo and the war's end seemed imminent, ZAVNOBiH held its third session in Sarajevo at the end of April 1945, promulgating itself into the national assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina and appointing the first national government. On April 27, a cabinet under prime minister Rodoljub \u010colakovi\u0107 was formed. Dr. Spu\u017eevi\u0107 was appointed the minister of construction. Other Bosnian Croats in the government included Jakov Grguri\u0107 (deputy prime minister), Ante Babi\u0107 (education), and Ante Martinovi\u0107 (forestry). Spu\u017eevi\u0107's ministry was responsible for the organisation of extensive reconstruction of the war-torn country.Adnan Velagi\u0107, \"Obnova i dru\u0161tveni razvoj Hercegovine od 1945. do 1952. godine\", Prilozi, 36, Sarajevo, 2007, str. 97-118. In October 1945, he was elected to the governing board of the newly re-established Croatian cultural society \"Napredak\" in Sarajevo., p. 1201 === 1946 elections === For the first post-war Bosnia-Herzegovina elections in October 1946, United People\u2019s Liberation Front decided to put Spu\u017eevi\u0107 on their ticket for Posu\u0161je-\u0160iroki Brijeg constituency, running for the seat of a deputy in the Constituent Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the Communist Party in Posu\u0161je and Western Herzegovina wanted another lawyer, a long-time communist born in Posusje, dr. Ante (Tune) Ramljak to be on the ballot instead, a compromise solution was found and Ramljak and Spu\u017eevi\u0107 ran against each other in the constituency, both as People\u2019s Front candidates. Spu\u017eevi\u0107 refused to have Marko \u0160olji\u0107, a long-time communist and a Spanish civil war veteran as his running mate on his ticket, as the Communist Party suggested. Posu\u0161je communists described Spu\u017eevi\u0107 in their internal reports as connected to the friars and clerical elements, hostile to the communists and dr Ramljak.Lu\u010di\u0107, Ivo. \"\u0160to je (bila) Bosna i Hercegovina i tko smo (bili) mi.\" STATUS Magazin Za Politi\u010dku Kulturu i Dru\u0161tvena Pitanja 14 (2010): 107-136., p. 116 Spu\u017eevi\u0107 actively campaigned and canvassed his constituency, supported by the Catholic Church, but eventually lost to Ramljak by a landslide.Papi\u0107, R.

NI\u0160RO \"Oslobo\u0111enje\". p.200 After hearing the results, Spu\u017eevi\u0107 left Mostar.Papi\u0107, p.200 == Legacy == Spu\u017eevi\u0107 has been largely forgotten in historiography and the public in general. On the other hand, after the breakup of Socialist Yugoslavia, a street in western part of Mostar was named after his cousin, \u0110uro (\u0110uka) Spu\u017eevi\u0107, who was entrusted by usta\u0161e regime with a position of a Hum county prefect during the war. In the night of February 19, 2018, Bosnian Croat student activists, studying history at Mostar University, removed the street signs in a Mostar street named after Mile Budak, Usta\u0161a ideologue, NDH government minister and the author of racial legislation in WWII (tried and executed in 1945 as a war criminal), replacing them with plaques \u201cCvitan Spu\u017eevi\u0107 Street.\u201d The acting mayor of Mostar, Ljubo Be\u0161li\u0107, welcomed the action and commented that dr. Spu\u017eevi\u0107 deserves to have a street in Mostar. National and regional media welcomed the idea as well. Serb orthodox priest in Mostar, Radivoje Krulj, stated he was \"thrilled\" to have learned of the action and that Spu\u017eevi\u0107's name reminds him of compassion and thankfulness. ===Family=== Spu\u017eevi\u0107's cousin \u0110uro (\u0110uka) Spu\u017eevi\u0107 (1900\u201381) emigrated to Italy and then to South Africa in 1945, becoming a cultural and political leader of the Croat community there.Tr\u017ei\u0107, H.

Spu\u017eevi\u0107 is a maternal great-grandfather of Bosnian Serb academic and historian, Vuk Ba\u010danovi\u0107. ==Notes== : dr Antun (Tuna) Ramljak was a lawyer born in Ri\u010dine, Posu\u0161je municipality. Ramljak attended school in Mostar. As a supporter of the Communist Party, in interbellum Yugoslavia he defended many persecuted Croatian communists in court, most notably, Marko Ore\u0161kovi\u0107. Between 1936 and 1941 Ramljak was the chairman of \u00bbHrvatska naklada\u00ab, Party's unofficial publishing house that published Izraz magazine. Having joined the People's Liberation Front in WW2, he became court secretary for Slavonia for the PLF authorities. Since October 1944, he worked as a government official in the Department of the Interior of the fledgling government of Croatia. After the war, in 1945, he was a member of the advisory committee on book censorship in the Ministry of Education of Croatia. ==References== ==External links== *Photo of the first government of Bosnia-Herzegovina, April 1945 Category:1885 births Category:People from Mostar Category:People from the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Yugoslav politicians Category:Yugoslav Partisans members Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina politicians Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina people of World War II Category:Year of death missing ",
