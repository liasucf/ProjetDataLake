    "text": "Dog Mountain is a property in St. Johnsbury, Vermont with 150 acres of trails, trout ponds, dog sculptures, an art gallery, and a Dog Chapel. It was run by Vermont artists Stephen Huneck and Gwen Huneck until their deaths. Gwen's brother, Jonathan Ide of Fitchburg, Wisconsin, is directing the business. ==Background== Vermont artists Stephen and Gwen Huneck were married for 35 years. He taught himself to carve wood and started carving images of dogs. He built a chapel for dogs in St. Johnsbury, Vermont, for dog owners to come to have time with their pets. They also hoped that it would be a place where people could mourn for the dogs in their lives that had died and find comfort by leaving notes and remembrances. The small chapel was filled with thousands of notes and pictures that people left to pay tribute to their pets. It also had Stephen's carvings in it. Stephen built the chapel himself in the style of an 1820s Vermont village church. ==Hard times== During the 2008 financial crisis, the Hunecks started to have difficulties. They needed to sell many prints, sculptures, furniture and books in order to keep the place going and this proved harder to do during the recession. Stephen took his life in January 2010 and Gwen then struggled to keep Dog Mountain going. She took her own life, as well, in 2013. ==Films== A documentary about the location, Dog Mountain: A Love Story, was produced by Dan Collison and Elizabeth Meister for Long Haul Productions, with support from the National Endowment for the Arts and KCRW\u2019s Independent Producer Project. ==References== Category:Art galleries in Vermont Category:Dog parks in the United States Category:St. Johnsbury, Vermont Category:Tourist attractions in Caledonia County, Vermont ",
