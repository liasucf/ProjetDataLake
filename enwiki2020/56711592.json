Located near the Yantic Falls on the Yantic River, it was the site of a major industrial facility developed in the mid-19th century, with an industrial history dating back to the 18th century. Charles Augustus Converse had consolidated water rights at the falls, and built a large complex which housed a number of different water-powered enterprises, including the gun factory of Ethan Allen, a gristmill, sawmill, woolen mill, nail factory, and a cork-cutting factory. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in New London County, Connecticut ==References== Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in New London County, Connecticut Category:Norwich, Connecticut ",
