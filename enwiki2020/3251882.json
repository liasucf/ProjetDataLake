    "text": "Luke Darcy (born 12 July 1975) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with the Western Bulldogs in the Australian Football League (AFL) and now works for the Seven Network and Triple M covering the AFL. ==Early life== Luke was born in Adelaide, South Australia, the son of David Darcy, who had played with Footscray (as the Western Bulldogs were then called) and played for and coached South Adelaide in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL). David, originally a Victorian, moved his family to Adelaide where Luke attended Rostrevor College. ==AFL career== Luke Darcy started his career with South Adelaide before his recruitment by the Bulldogs in 1993. Debuting in 1994, Darcy became known as one of the Bulldogs' most successful ruckmen/forwards. In 2001 he took out the Bulldogs' Best and Fairest award, the Charles Sutton Medal, and continued to play well in the following seasons. in 2002 Darcy and the Brisbane Lions's Michael Voss were the first players to be awarded the Leigh Matthews Trophy as the AFL Players Association's Most Valuable Player (MVP)1. In 2004 he was the Western Bulldogs's leading goalkicker. In a 2005 match against Geelong, Darcy suffered a season-ending knee injury when he twisted it, depriving the Bulldogs of a quality tall- forward option, something they missed during the year. On 20 December 2005 during the final pre-season training session before the Christmas holidays, Darcy re-injured the ACL during a fall which dislocated his knee, which meant that he would miss the entire 2006 season. The Bulldogs finished the season in eighth place, the first time the club had made the finals in six years. He had been part of a Bulldogs casualty list that included four ACL injuries during the season (up until only the Round 9 mark). During his time on the sidelines, he provided special comments for Network Ten's AFL coverage, and continued to do so after his playing retirement which he announced on 2 August 2007, the end of the 2007 AFL season. Darcy was officially added to Network Ten's AFL commentary team in 2007 (despite still playing football until the end of that season) and remained an Expert Commentator right up until the end of the 2011 AFL season, when the network lost broadcasting rights.. ==Statistics== http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/L/Luke_Darcy.html |- |- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\" ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1994 |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 40 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 2 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 0.0 || 2.0 || 2.0 || 0.0 || 1.0 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text- align:center\" | 1995 |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 14 || 3 || 0 || 1 || 10 || 5 || 15 || 4 || 2 || 0.0 || 0.3 || 3.3 || 1.7 || 5.0 || 1.3 || 0.7 |- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\" ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1996 |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 14 || 20 || 12 || 8 || 160 || 78 || 238 || 92 || 15 || 0.6 || 0.4 || 8.0 || 3.9 || 11.9 || 4.6 || 0.8 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1997 |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 14 || 23 || 24 || 13 || 208 || 92 || 300 || 131 || 14 || 1.0 || 0.6 || 9.0 || 4.0 || 13.0 || 5.7 || 0.6 |- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\" ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text- align:center\" | 1998 |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 14 || 24 || 13 || 8 || 187 || 88 || 275 || 107 || 15 || 0.5 || 0.3 || 7.8 || 3.7 || 11.5 || 4.6 || 0.6 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 1999 |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 14 || 24 || 19 || 15 || 221 || 104 || 325 || 136 || 17 || 0.8 || 0.6 || 9.2 || 4.3 || 13.5 || 5.7 || 0.7 |- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\" ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2000 |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 14 || 17 || 10 || 5 || 172 || 99 || 271 || 106 || 17 || 0.6 || 0.3 || 10.1 || 5.8 || 15.9 || 6.2 || 1.0 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2001 |style=\"text- align:center;\"| | 14 || 21 || 14 || 8 || 237 || 145 || 382 || 118 || 30 || 0.7 || 0.4 || 11.3 || 6.9 || 18.2 || 5.6 || 1.4 |- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\" ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2002 |style=\"text- align:center;\"| | 14 || 22 || 23 || 8 || 249 || 211 || 460 || 149 || 63 || 1.0 || 0.4 || 11.3 || 9.6 || 20.9 || 6.8 || 2.9 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text- align:center\" | 2003 |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 14 || 21 || 9 || 7 || 211 || 165 || 376 || 129 || 46 || 0.4 || 0.3 || 10.0 || 7.9 || 17.9 || 6.1 || 2.2 |- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\" ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2004 |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 14 || 22 || 30 || 13 || 216 || 136 || 352 || 127 || 59 || 1.4 || 0.6 || 9.8 || 6.2 || 16.0 || 5.8 || 2.7 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2005 |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 14 || 6 || 11 || 3 || 51 || 30 || 81 || 43 || 7 || 1.8 || 0.5 || 8.5 || 5.0 || 13.5 || 7.2 || 1.2 |- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\" ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2006 |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 14 || 0 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | 2007 |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 14 || 22 || 18 || 8 || 141 || 87 || 228 || 91 || 43 || 0.8 || 0.4 || 6.4 || 4.0 || 10.4 || 4.1 || 2.0 |- class=\"sortbottom\" ! colspan=3| Career ! 226 ! 183 ! 97 ! 2063 ! 1242 ! 3305 ! 1233 ! 329 ! 0.8 ! 0.4 ! 9.1 ! 5.5 ! 14.6 ! 5.5 ! 1.5 |} ==Honours and achievements== {| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin- top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#fff;\" | colspan=\"2;\" style=\"padding:3px; margin- bottom:-3px; margin-top:2px; font-family:Arial; \"| Brownlow Medal votes |- ! style=\"width:50%;\"| Season ! style=\"width:50%;\"| Votes |- | 1994 | \u2014 |- | 1995 | \u2014 |- | 1996 | 2 |- | 1997 | 7 |- | 1998 | \u2014 |- | 1999 | 5 |- | 2000 | 3 |- | 2001 | 11 |- | 2002 | 16 |- | 2003 | 6 |- | 2004 | \u2014 |- | 2005 | 5 |- | 2006 | \u2014 |- | 2007 | \u2014 |- | Total | 55 |- | colspan=2| Key: |- style=\"background:#d9f9e9; border:1px solid #aaa; width:2em;\" | colspan=2| Green / Bold = Won |} *Individual **Charles Sutton Medal: 2001 **Leigh Matthews Trophy (AFLPA MVP Award): 2002 (tied with Michael Voss) **All- Australian: 2002 **Australian Football Media Association Player of the Year Award: 2002 **Herald Sun Player of the Year Award: 2002 **Western Bulldogs Leading Club Goalkicker Award: 2004 **Australian Representative Honours in International Rules Football: 2002 **Western Bulldogs Captain: 2005-2006 **AFL Rising Star Nominee: 1996 (Round 3) ==Personal life== Luke Darcy is married to Rebecca and they have four children \u2013 Sam, Sienna, William and Max. ==Post- football career== In 2008, Darcy became a member of the AFL rules committee. ==Media== After retiring Darcy continued his work in the media.
