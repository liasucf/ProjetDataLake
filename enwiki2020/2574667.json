It has a long cultural heritage and a special beauty that comes from its Sydney Harbour location and its old suburb origins. Old couple having tea (ALP Municipal elections, Balmain) Leichhardt is named after the Prussian explorer Ludwig Leichhardt, who in the 1840s was feted for his expedition in search of an overland route from southern Queensland to Port Essington, a British settlement on the far northern coast of Australia that is approximately to the north of the modern city of Darwin. He later famously vanished without trace on his attempt to cross the continent from the Darling Downs to the Swan River Colony on the Western Australia coast. Leichhardt was proclaimed a municipality in 29 December 1871. In 1893, the East Ward of the Municipality separated and became the Borough of Annandale. In 1949, it was merged with the municipalities of Annandale and Balmain. In 1967, the municipal boundary was altered to include Glebe and parts of Camperdown. In 2003, the municipal boundary was again changed, to exclude the Annandale Foreshore (land between The Crescent and Rozelle Bay), Glebe and Forest Lodge, which are now part of the City of Sydney. Since the middle of the 20th century, Leichhardt has been a centre for Sydney's Italian community. Leichhardt is also home to the first non-government women's health centre to be established in Australia. On International Women's Day 1974, the Leichhardt Women's Community Health Centre opened as a result of grass-roots lobbying from women in the community and Sydney's Women's Liberation Movement. Initially funded through Federal Government funds, the centre is now funded mainly by the NSW Health and continues to run multi-disciplinary health care clinics and health education from its base in Leichhardt and in outreach locations throughout Sydney's inner west. ===Amalgamation=== A 2015 review of local government boundaries recommended that the Municipality of Leichhardt merge with the Municipality of Ashfield and the Marrickville Council to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately .
