The Argentine Army also had the 10th Mechanized Infantry Brigade in the capital guarding against a theoretical seaborne invasion along the Buenos Aires coastline. Two assumptions governed the deployment of the Argentine ground forces on the islands (): *the junta did not believe that the British would use military force to retake the islands, so the initial landing force had been withdrawn shortly after April 3, and was not reinforced until after the British recaptured South Georgia. The intent was to place a large number of troops onto the islands to dissuade the British from any military action. As the Royal Navy had submarines patrolling the immediate area, reinforcements had to be airlifted in, which limited the heavy equipment that could be deployed. *an attack was feared from Chile due to the ongoing Beagle Channel dispute. As Chile was marshalling troops close to its Southern Argentine border, the Argentinian High Command had to deploy their better trained forces to deter a Chilean attack. As a result, neither the mountain warfare regiments, nor the paratroop brigade were available. Furthermore, only a fifth of the cold-adapted marine infantry was sent to the islands. The majority of the troops deployed were from sub- tropical areas, the Argentine Mesopotamia region and Buenos Aires Province, and not trained for action in the terrain (they were trained to avoid snakes and sunstroke, not frostbite). These two incorrect assumptions led to inappropriate troops being sent to the islands.Commodore Ruben Oscar Moro La Guerra Inaudita, 2000 In the Argentine Army, the bulk of the national servicemen were demobilized in late December. The Soldados Clase \u201963 (SC 63) were conscripts born in 1963. On April 2, 1982 the SC 63 inducted into the army in February had started their 45 days of boot camp training. When the Royal Navy set sail for the South Atlantic, the army tried to replace their SC 63 intake with the recently demobilized SC '62 reservists.Martin Middlebrook: \"The Argentine fight for the Malvinas - The Argentine Forces in the Falklands War\", Pen and Sword Books, 1989, , p. 51: Every Argentine young man became liable for a twelve-month period of military service in the year that he celebrated his 19th birthday. The military year in Argentina began in January when the regiments received the young conscripts. During the year, the recruits were trained and released in the last months of that annum. Soldados Clase \u201963 were conscripts born in 1963. It was possible to wait up to seven years for military service, so Soldados Clase \u201959 in 1982 were both lingering conscripts and recalled reservists. Since SC \u201963 only had four months of training, the army tried to replace them with SC \u201962 reservists; two-thirds had been changed by the time the British arrived. The conscripts inducted in February and March 1982 in Lieutenant-Colonel Mohamed Al\u00ed Seineld\u00edn's 25th Infantry Regiment from the 9th Infantry Brigade in Santa Cruz Province, received Commando training in a crash 4-week course. British Warrant Officer Nick Van Der Bijl, who interviewed key captured Argentine officers in the fighting has written: In all, some fifty conscripts in the 12th Regiment from the 3rd Infantry Brigade in Corrientes Province had also been put through a compressed commando course organized by visiting Argentine Army Green Berets in 1981. Private Esteban Roberto \u00c1valos who fought in the Falklands as a sniper recalls: During 1981, a Commando course was squeezed in the 10th Mechanised Infantry Brigade in Buenos Aires. The brigade commander, Brigadier Oscar Luis Jofr\u00e9 had decided that an airlanding special operations platoon would be formed for each of his regiments. Major Oscar Ram\u00f3n Jaimet, the Operations Officer of the 6th Regiment, took over command of the formation of these helicopter-borne platoons of mainly conscripts. Jaimet, a dedicated professional soldier had served behind Marxist separatist guerrilla lines as a Commando in the Tucum\u00e1n Province in 1975. Private Santiago Fabi\u00e1n Gauto was selected to be part of the Commando platoon for the 7th Regiment: Major Carlos Carrizo Salvadores, second-in-command of the 7th Regiment confirms that: == Theatre of Operations in the Falkland Islands (April 7 \u2013 June 14) == Guarnici\u00f3n Militar Malvinas * Commander: Brigade General Mario Men\u00e9ndez (governor). RI (Infantry Regiments) were about 800 men. === 3rd (Jungle) Infantry Brigade === It was on 2 April 1982 when Brigadier-General Omar Edgardo Parada learned that the Falklands/Malvinas had been occupied. This brigade commander did not have much time to take part in the official celebrations held in the capital city of Corrientes Province; he soon received orders to prepare his brigade for transfer to southern Argentina, with one of his units, the 3rd Artillery Regiment ordered to Port Stanley. At this juncture most of the 3rd Brigade conscripts had completed their national service and had returned to civilian life, and the new batch of conscripts had just been incorporated. Parada immediately went about the task of rounding up all the reservists, which he was able to achieve in great numbers by sending messengers in vehicles. Thus a substantial part of the trained reservists from the provinces of Corrientes, Chaco, and Misiones, were mobilized, many of the recalled soldiers scrambling aboard the trains laden with the brigade's regulars on their southbound journey. After crossing the Colorado River, Parada received new instructions to reinforce Brigadier-General Am\u00e9rico Daher's 9th Infantry Brigade in Santa Cruz Province that had already sent the 8th and 25th Regiments to the Falklands. Before this request could be met, the 3rd Brigade received orders to board the transport planes heading to Port Stanley.It was only then that Brigadier General Parada learned the Malvinas had been reclaimed. This brigade commander did not have much time to concern himself with bedecking the city with flags or even to celebrate the event; he soon received official orders to prepare his brigade for transfer to the south, and one of his units, the 3rd Artillery Group, to be sent to the theater of operations on the Malvinas. At this juncture most of the draftees of the contingent born in 1962 had completed their service and had been mustered out, and the 1963 contingent had just been sworn in. He immediately went about the task of rounding up all the \"veterans,\" which he was able to achieve in large numbers by sending messengers in all directions. Thus the all-too-recently demobilized conscripts from Corrientes, from the Chaco, from Misiones, from all over the country were once again herded front and center, many of them scrambling aboard trains laden with the brigade's regulars on their southbound trek. As they rumbled across the Colorado River, the 3rd Brigade had not mustered its full strength, but it had already accomplished its primary mission: a dragnet had brought in able bodied men along the coast of Patagonia. While this was going on, it received a new assignment: reinforce the 9th Brigade in Santa Cruz Province. Before this latest mission was accomplished, it was burdened with yet a third: ship out to the Malvinas Islands.

Repossi. Private Dacio Agretti, serving in B Company from the 4th Infantry Regiment, recalls events leading up to the Battle of Two Sisters: During the Battle of Mount Harriet, 42 Commando Group discovered a path through a frozen minefield, according to the 4th Regiment's Intelligence Officer First Lieutenant Jorge Echeverr\u00eda,Evidentemente fue una infiltraci\u00f3n grand\u00edsima. Por los informes que tengo hasta ahora no puedo precisar exactamente el punto por donde entraron, pero s\u00ed s\u00e9 que entraron por el flanco que ten\u00edamos totalmente cubierto, que era el de la costa que iba para Puerto Argentino. Lo ten\u00edamos- minado, ese campo minado cost\u00f3 mucho tiempo, cost\u00f3 sudor, cost\u00f3 bajas, y se pusieron esas minas que pesan veinte kilos. Lo que pasa es que es como todo. Aunque a uno le pongan campos minados, si tenemos que atacar, atacamos igual y ya veremos por d\u00f3nde pasamos. Esa misma determinaci\u00f3n \u2014pienso\u2014 la ten\u00edan ellos. As\u00ed lucharon, Carlos M. T\u00farolo, p. 144, Editorial Subamericana, 1982 allowing the Royal Marines to attack the two Argentine 4th Regiment companies on Harriet from the rear. The British marines were in among the 120mm heavy mortar platoon (under Second Lieutenant Mario Hector Ju\u00e1rez) and 12th Regiment reserve platoon (under Second Lieutenant Celestino Mosteirin) positions very early in the battle, and they took the position after a 15-minute gun-fight and scattered the defenders. The 12th Regiment company commander present, First Lieutenant Ignacio Gorriti and First Lieutenant Jorge Echeverr\u00eda tried to pull troops from Mosteirin's reinforced rifle platoon to counterattack the British, but many of the soldiers initially refused to obey any commands to stand and fight. A 4th Regiment B Company platoon commander, Second Lieutenant Eugenio C\u00e9sar Bruny, managed to pull together his rifle platoon for a counterattack but it was pinned and dispersed almost immediately by British artillery and mortar fire.In the last attack of the night, the British 42nd Commando Battalion found a way through an undefended minefield, allowing them to attack the two Argentine companies on Mt. Harriet from the rear. The British soldiers were in among the Argentine reserves, headquarters, and mortar positions before the fight ever began, and they took the position and quickly scattered the defenders. Several Argentine junior officers tried to pull troops from the front lines to counterattack the British in the rear, but many of their soldiers panicked and fled, while others simply refused to obey any commands to fight or move. One officer managed to pull together a platoon for a counterattack but it was pinned and dispersed almost immediately by British artillery and mortar fire. Kenneth M. Pollack, p. 212, Oxford University Press, 2019 === 10th Mechanised Infantry Brigade === Agrupaci\u00f3n Puerto Argentino (Stanley Sector) Commander: Brigadier-General Oscar Luis Jofre. Brigade home base: Buenos Aires Province Brigadier Jofre, aged 53, had converted his 10th Brigade into a well-trained formation. The culmination of the training cycle for the conscripts consisted of a full-scale mechanized infantry assault with supporting aircraft from the Argentine Air Force in the General Acha Desert in La Pampa Province in October 1981.\"Aged fifty-three when the Falklands War broke out, he had converted his Brigade into a useful infantry formation ... The climax came with a brigade mechanized infantry assault, while overhead Skyhawks, representing both friendly and enemy air support, strafed target hulks with rockets. The Argentinian Army Commander-in- Chief, Lieutenant-General Roberto Viola, paid close attention to the performance of the brigade.\" 5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands, Nicholas Van Der Bijl, David Aldea, p.29, Leo Cooper, 2003 Private Claudio Alberto Carbone from the 7th Mechanized Regiment recalls the major exercise that also involved the 1st Armoured Cavalry Brigade: In an interview with Private Manuel Valenzuela from the 6th Mechanized Regiment in 2015, the Argentine newspaper Publicable confirmed that the exercises in the General Acha training area (716 kilometres north of Buenos Aires) were designed to toughen up the conscripts nearing the completion of their national service, with very little food and water provided to the participating units in the first burst of heatwave conditions in the Argentine summer of 1981: The 10th Brigade mobilized with creditable speed. The Argentine reservists were sustained by patriotism and indignation.
