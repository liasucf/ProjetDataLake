    "text": "Meliboea or Meliboia () was a town of Histiaeotis in ancient Thessaly. It was located near Aeginium and Tricca. William Martin Leake conjectured that its site was at the present town of Vasiliki,Leake, Northern Greece vol. iv, p. 536. and modern scholarship still leaves the site as unknown. Abraham John Valpy suggested to read Livy as meaning the city known by Strabo as Melitoea and by Ptolemy as Melitara (now Militra) near Phthiotidis and Thessaliotidis, since Valpy was aware of Meliboea in Magnesia. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Thessaly Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Lost ancient cities and towns Category:Histiaeotis ",
