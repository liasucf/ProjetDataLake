His accession to the Bohemian throne marked the start of a phase of stability after a long period of internal dynastic struggles. Under his rule, the Moravian lands were reconquered from Polish occupation. == Life == Old\u0159ich was the third son of Duke Boleslaus II of Bohemia (d. 999) and the son one of his father's two wives: Adiva or Emma of M\u011bln\u00edk. Upon the death of his father, his eldest brother Boleslaus III succeeded as duke, however, he soon entered into a fierce conflict with his younger brothers Old\u0159ich and Jarom\u00edr. In 1001, both had to flee to the Bavarian court at Regensburg. When Boleslaus III was deposed by the rival Vr\u0161ovci dynasty the next year and the Polish ruler Boles\u0142aw I the Brave invaded Bohemia, King Henry II of Germany intervened. As a part of Henry's expedition to Prague, Boleslaus's brothers were able to return to Bohemia, and Jarom\u00edr was installed as Bohemian duke in 1004. Old\u0159ich and his wife Bo\u017eena enter Prague, Chronicle of Dalimil In the German\u2013Polish War of 1002-18, Duke Jarom\u00edr remained a loyal supporter of the German king. Nevertheless, Henry did not take action when he was deposed and blinded by his brother Old\u0159ich on 12 April 1012. While Jarom\u00edr fled to Poland, Old\u0159ich recognised the suzerainty of the German king. He secured his rule by suppressing the Vr\u0161ovci insurgents. Old\u0159ich and his son Bretislaus sought to win back Moravia, once conquered from the Poles by Old\u0159ich's grandfather Duke Boleslaus I. Bretislaus and his wife Judith of Schweinfurt took up residence in Olomouc. In 1029, the Bohemian forces, backed by Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II, finally drove the Poles out of the eastern lands. However, Bretislaus's efforts to occupy adjacent territories in what is today Slovakia by marching against the forces of the Kingdom of Hungary failed in 1030 due to the jealousy of the emperor, who reached an agreement with King Stephen I. In the following year, Bohemian forces refused to take the field for the emperor. In 1032, Duke Old\u0159ich was invited to the Hoftag diet at Merseburg, but did not appear. His absence raised the ire of the emperor and Conrad, busy with events in Burgundy, charged his son Henry III with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. Old\u0159ich was arrested, deposed and sent to Bavaria. He was again replaced by his brother Jarom\u00edr. However, when Old\u0159ich was pardoned the next year, he returned to Bohemia and had Jarom\u00edr captured, blinded, and deposed. He seized power again and drove out Jarom\u00edr's son from Moravia. Old\u0159ich died abruptly on 9 November 1034 and later examination of his skeleton reveal his skull to have suffered a fatal blow. Jarom\u00edr then renounced the throne in favour of his nephew Bretislaus. ==Marriage and children== Old\u0159ich and Bo\u017eena, painting by Franti\u0161ek \u017den\u00ed\u0161ek, 1884 According to legend rendered by the medieval chronicler Cosmas of Prague, Duke Old\u0159ich about 1002 married a Bo\u017eena, daughter of K\u0159esina, after discarding his first wife on the grounds that they were childless.
