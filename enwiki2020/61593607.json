    "text": "Ann Barr Snitow (May 9, 1943 \u2013 August 10, 2019) was an American feminist activist, writer and teacher. She was a co-founder of the New York Radical Feminists, and the (co-)author and (co-)editor of several books. ==Life== Snitow was born in New York City. She took her doctorate in London and returned to her home city where she was a founding member of the New York Radical Feminists in 1969 with her friend Ellen Willis. In the 1970s she became known for her talks on the not for profit New York radio show Womankind on WBAI. She was a serial movement founder. In 1977 she founded CARASA to campaign against sterilisation and for the right to abortion. Snitow taught English literature at Manhattan's New School for Social Research in Manhattan during the 1980s, where she established gender studies as another course. In 1981 she gathered together people to form No More Nice Girls, a feminist street theatre group whose message was pro abortion and to uncover female sexuality. Three years later she founded the similarly themed \"FACT\" which tried to reduce the impact of anti-pornography campaigners. Snitow's approach was summarised as \"Pro-sex\" as she did not want to see more censorship. In 1983 she brought together her thoughts about feminist sexuality, anti- pornography and prostitution in an essay titled \"Powers of Desire: The Politics of Sexuality\". In 1998 she turned historian to recall \"The Feminist Memoir Project\" about her work. In 2002 she founded the group \"Take Back the Future\". In 2015 she published \"The Feminism of Uncertainty (2015)\" which gathered together her lifetime of essays. Snitow died in 2019. Snitow's papers are at Eugene Lang College The New School for Liberal Arts where Snitow was a professor of literature and gender studies. ==Founding member of...== *New York Radical Feminists in 1969 *CARASA (Committee for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse), 1977 *\"No More Nice Girls\", 1981, a feminist street theater group focused primarily on abortion and sexuality; *FACT (Feminist Anti-Censorship Taskforce), 1984, opposing the feminist anti- pornography movement *Network of East-West Women, 1991, with Katha Pollitt, among several others, including Ellen Willis *Take Back the Future, 2002 ==Selected works== * * * *Snitow, Ann Barr (2020).
