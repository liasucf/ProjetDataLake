    "text": "Halcones de Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n (English: Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n Falcons) is a professional Mexican basketball team, based in Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n, Sonora. The Halcones are members of the Circuito de Baloncesto de la Costa del Pac\u00edfico (CIBACOPA) and play their games in the Gimnasio Municipal Manuel Lira Garc\u00eda. ==History== The Trigueros de Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n were founding members of CIBACOPA in 2001, and won three championships until the issue of poor attendance forced the club to abandon the league in 2013. The Halcones were founded in 2016 by a group of local businessmen looking to bring professional basketball back to the city to develop and promote the sport. The team joined the Circuito de Baloncesto de la Costa del Pac\u00edfico (CIBACOPA) as an expansion team for the 2016 season, where they had a seventh-place regular-season finish before getting swept 4-0 by the eventual champions Nauticos de Mazatl\u00e1n in the first round of the playoffs. Ahead of the 2017 season, the Halcones signed American imports Kevin Capers, Mike Glover and Glen Rice Jr. That year in the playoffs, they defeated the Nauticos in seven games before dispatching the Pioneros de Los Mochis in five. In the finals, they defeated Rayos de Hermosillo 4\u20132 to win their first- ever championship. Rice Jr. was named Finals MVP after averaging a near-30-point triple double in the series. In 2018, the team added Isaiah Wilkerson, J. R. Giddens and former Halc\u00f3n Geron Johnson. The Halcones had a poor regular season showing, barely clinching a playoff spot with an eighth- place finish. The team again reached the finals, falling to the Tijuana Zonkeys in a six-game series. In February 2019, Spaniard Pedro Carrillo was hired as head coach, having previously coached the \u00c1ngeles de Puebla in the LNBP. He also won a LNBP championship with Fuerza Regia de Monterrey in 2016\u201317 as an assistant. Although he was selected to coach the North squad at the 2019 CIBACOPA All-Star Game in Guadalajara, Carrillo left the team in June for personal reasons. In the postseason, the Halcones lost in the semi-finals to the Mantarrayas de La Paz in seven games. The Halcones lost game seven at home by a score of 105\u201392 despite 29 points from Jos\u00e9 Estrada. American former top high school recruit Tony Farmer joined the team in 2020, as did Jarvis Summers and Reggie Holmes. The Halcones played two games of the 2020 season, losses to Rayos de Hermosillo and Ostioneros de Guaymas, before the league announced the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Players== ===Current roster=== ==Head coaches== * Eduardo Opezzo (2017) * Ronald Guillen (2018) * Pedro Carrillo (2019) * Martin Knezevic (2020\u2013) ==Honours== ===Domestic competitions=== * Circuito de Baloncesto de la Costa del Pac\u00edfico ** Winners (1): 2017 ** Runners-up (1): 2018 ==References== ==External links== * Official site * Team profile at Latinbasket.com Category:Basketball teams in Mexico Category:Sports teams in Sonora Category:Basketball teams established in 2016 Category:2016 establishments in Mexico ",
