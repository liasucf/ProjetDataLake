The excavations of the Roman site were directed by P.K. Baillie Reynolds, of Aberystwyth University, over a period of four summers in the 1920s, 282 pages. Baillie Reynolds' reports were originally published in Archaeologia. Page found on Kanovium Project website although there have of course been several other publications since. The church and its churchyard occupy the north-east quarter of the original Roman site. Canovium was built at an ancient river crossing and was an important post on the Roman road and ancient drovers road via Bwlch-y-Ddeufaen to Abergwyngregyn and the Menai Strait. Latterly the best crossing point, now with a bridge, has been at nearby Tal-y-Cafn. After the end of Roman rule in Britain, the fort was associated with King Rhun Hir of Gwynedd, hence the subsequent name.
