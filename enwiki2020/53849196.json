    "text": "Psychical inertia is a term introduced by Carl Jung to describe the psyche's resistance to development and change. He considered it one of the main reason for the neurotic opposing, or shrinking from, his/her age-appropriate tasks in life.M. Jacoby, Individuation and Narcissism (2013) p. 35 ==Freudian and other developments== Freud argued that such psychic inertia played a part in the lives of the normal, as well as of the neurotic,S. Freud, Case Studies II (PFL 9) p. 358-9 and saw its origins in fixation between early instincts and their first impressions of significant objects.S. Freud, On Psychopathology (PFL 10) p. 157-8 As late as Civilization and its Discontents, he considered as a major obstacle to cultural development \"the inertia of the libido, its disinclination to give up an old position for a new one\".S. Freud, Civilization, Society and Religion (PFL 129) p. 298 Later Jungians have seen psychic inertia as a force of nature reflecting both internal and outer determinants;K. Evera-Fahey, Towards a Jungian Theory of the Ego (2016) p. 68-9 while others have seen it as the product of social pressures, especially in relation to ageing.L.
