    "text": "Vladim\u00edr Hirsch (born July 3, 1954, Bene\u0161ov, Czech Republic) is a Czech composer and instrumentalist (keyboard instruments). The author of the concept of the so-called \"integrated\" musical form \u2013 combining contemporary classical music with dark-ambient and industrial music, his compositional style is characterized by polymodal architecture and alchemical work with sound, using mainly digital techniques to expand the action potential of the means of expression. Vladim\u00edr Hirsch is or was the leader of the avant-garde projects Aghiatrias, Skrol, Zygote, Subpop Squeeze, and more. From 1986 to 1996, he was a member of the experimental post-punk band Der Marabu. Vladim\u00edr Hirsch graduated from the Faculty of Medicine at Charles University in Prague and has been practicing medicine with shorter or longer breaks. ==Biography and style== Vladim\u00edr Hirsch was born in Bene\u0161ov, lived in Lede\u010d nad S\u00e1zavou until he was 18 and then moved to Prague, where he now lives and works. Composing since 1973, he started with small romantic and classical compositions for piano and organ, but very soon abandoned the experiments and devoted himself only to rock and jazz. A long-time member of the Prague-based post-punk group Der Marabu, after its disintegration, he founded the ensemble Skrol (1995) and several other parallel projects like Aghiatrias, Zygote, Subpop Squeeze, Luminar Ax, etc. Without ever abandoning his projects and ensembles, in 1987 the composer began working in parallel on solo production, and around 2002 it became his main program. Emphasizing the use of modern means of expression and the search for specific compositional techniques, he bring together serial, atonal, microtonal, polymodal, and spectral music. Partly inspired by the traditions of 20th-century Slavic classical music, Vladim\u00edr Hirsch keeps building hybrid working models in tonal principles, composition, and instrumentation. Using digital techniques for classical orchestras together with a wide range of sound sources, he searches to achieve the alchemical transformation of sounds into a homogeneous, indivisible substance. This principle, called \"integrated music\"Claudia Admiron: Invocatio (rozhovor pro \"Heathen Harvest\", 2013) by itself, also represents the metaphysical idea of the creative concept, which consists in the collision and reconciliation of two seemingly opposite spiritual worlds within an individual. Vladim\u00edr Hirsch regularly gives concerts both at home and abroad, including tours in the USA, Germany, Great Britain and Italy. In 2010, an eight-disc set of key recordings was released by the Italian publishing house Ars Benevola Mater entitled \"The Assent to Paradoxon\". He has also collaborated with foreign artists on different projects like Dawn Carlyle aka Dove Hermosa, Nadya Feir, Cecilia Bj\u00e4rg\u00f6, Igor Vaganov, Alessandro Aru, and Kenji Siratori. ==Creations== Vladim\u00edr Hirsch's music lingers between experimental projects and compositions of a very strict compositional order, but is almost always of a conceptual nature: > \"It is the work of a non-conformist individualist, forging a completely > original aesthetic form, where the unifying element is a rather dark, > emotionally tense, often apocalyptic atmosphere of compositions, > characterized by their metaphysical, existential anxiety, and spirituality.\" > (Stephen Ellis)Stephen Ellis: Vladim\u00edr Hirsch - Symphony No.4 \"Descent from > the Cross\" His most notable works include \"Symphony No. 4\" with the subtitle \"Sn\u00edm\u00e1n\u00ed z k\u0159\u00ed\u017ee\" (in English: \"Shooting from the Cross\")Adam X: Vladim\u00edr Hirsch - Symfonie \u010d. 4: Descent From The Cross (Engl.); Heathen Harvest and its revised, live version \"Graue Passion\" (\u0160ed\u00e9 pa\u0161ije);M.Jarol\u00edm: Graue Passion recenze the conceptual dark ambient albums \"Underlying Scapes\", \"Exorcisms\", \"Invocations\" and \"Scripta Soli\"Full Moon Magazin / Richard Kut\u011bj: Do posledn\u00edho p\u0159\u00edsn\u00e9ho detailu; the extensive ingressive composition \"Contemplatio per nexus\"; the post-industrial mass \"Missa Armata\"; the composition for piano, percussion and combined electroacoustic techniques \"Endoanathymia\"; the digital symphony \"Axonal Transit\"; the microtonal dark ambient album\" Epidemic Mind\"; the selection of compositions for organ and piano \"Selected Organ and Piano Works\", and Concerto for Organ No. 2 \"Horae\". While the composer's work seems to be permeated by a very elaborate and authentic expression of the internal conflict of values within the individual and one's confrontation with the anthropocentric model of contemporary society, the composer disagrees it was the initial idea in throughout the compositions. For the insiders of the industrial and post-industrial scene, Vladim\u00edr Hirsch produces very intense, full of suggestive and stormy atmosphere music.Blanick\u00fd J., Auster M.: Vladim\u00edr Hirsch - Biografie Vlad\u00edmir Hirsch was included in Olivier Bernard's Anthology of Ambient Music, Olivier Bernard: Anthology of Ambient (Anthologie de l'ambient - in French The Complete Guide of Ambient MusicThe Complete Guide of Ambient Music, p. 247, Pedia Press and in the encyclopedic publication of composers of contemporary world music.21st Century composers /(Life Journey, 2013) ==Selected compositions== Hirsch's work is represented by the activities of his ensembles and also by an extensive collection of solo works.
