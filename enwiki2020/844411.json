    "text": "Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos y Garc\u00eda was a Filipino Catholic priest, accused of mutiny by the Spanish colonial authorities in the Philippines in the 19th century. He was placed in a mock trial and summarily executed in Manila along with two other clergymen, Mariano G\u00f3mez and Jacinto Zamora, who are collectively known as the Gomburza. ==Early life== Jos\u00e9 Burgos, baptized Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos y Garc\u00eda, was born in Vigan, Ilocos Sur on February 9, 1837 to a Spanish officer, Don Jos\u00e9 Tiburcio Burgos, and a Filipino mestiza mother named Florencia Garc\u00eda. He obtained three undergraduate degrees with honors, two master's degrees and two doctorate degrees from the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and from the University of Santo Tomas. He conducted his first mass in Intramuros. ==Contributions== Burgos' nationalist views, codified in editorial essays, championing political and ecclesiastic reforms in favor of empowering more native clergymen, made him a target of opposition to civil authorities. In 1864, an anonymous pamphlet was published in Manila, criticizing the prejudice in the Church, and providing rebuttals against several canards against the native clergy. Although the document was unsigned, historians believe the author to be Burgos, based on its style and content. Burgos also penned several signed articles later in his life, in response to a series of anonymous written attacks on the Filipino clergy. Though Burgos offered few new ideas, his name caught the attention of Spanish authorities, who would report that the native clergy was becoming separatist. In 1869, Felip\u00e9 Buencamino, a young student and an acquaintance of Burgos, was charged with spreading nationalist propaganda in the form of leaflets scattered throughout his school's campus, demanding academic freedom. This accusation was given credence by a protest he staged several months prior, against being required to speak Latin in the classroom. Consequently, Buencamino and some of his associates were sent to jail. With the aid of Burgos, Buencamino was freed four months later, only to be told that having missed school for four months, he would have to find a tutor who would help him make up for the classes he missed. Buencamino chose Burgos. By this time, Burgos had established a reputation as a defender of the native clergy. His debates over the rights of native priests had extended to include questions of race and nationalism. This reputation would eventually cause him to be implicated in a mutiny in Cavite. ==Secret Society of Reformers== Jos\u00e9 Burgos was a member of a confraternity, which met in the Santa Cruz home of Padre Mariano. It was presided over by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Basa, and included Agust\u00edn Mendoza, M\u00e1ximo Paterno, and Ambrosio Rianzares Bautista.Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social, and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons The group's goal was to seek reforms, listed in Eco de Filipinas, which was published in Madrid. ==Trial and Death== Jos\u00e9 Apolonio Burgos on the cover of the book Ang Tunay na Buhay ni P. Dr. Jose Burgos (\"The True Life of P. Jose Burgos\") After the Cavite Mutiny on January 20, 1872, the trial of mutineer sergeant Bonifacio Octavo revealed that a man named Zaldua had been recruiting people for an uprising. Octavo testified that this man claimed to be under the orders of Burgos, but inconsistent details during Octavo's cross-examinations called into question the validity of his testimony. Nevertheless, governor-general Rafael Izquierdo reported to Madrid that the testimony had confirmed his suspicions, and pinned the blame on Burgos and two other priests, Jacinto Zamora and Mariano G\u00f3mez, for sedition. The three underwent a tribunal amidst a list of dubious charges and false witnesses, and where their own lawyers double-crossed them. On February 17, 1872, they were garroted in the middle of Bagumbayan field (now Luneta Park). Gomburza sculpture at Parish of the Holy Sacrifice. Monument at Asingan, Pangasinan ==Influence== Burgos was a close friend and associate of Paciano Rizal, Jos\u00e9 Rizal's older brother and mentor. Burgos's execution - along with G\u00f3mez's and Zamora's - deeply affected Jos\u00e9, who was inspired to write his second novel, El Filibusterismo. Several towns in the Philippines were named in his honor. These include: * Burgos, Ilocos Norte * Burgos, Ilocos Sur * Burgos, Isabela * Burgos, La Union * Burgos, Pangasinan * Padre Burgos, Quezon * Padre Burgos, Southern Leyte * Burgos, Surigao del Norte ==In popular culture== * Portrayed by Paolo Paraiso in official Music Video GMA Lupang Hinirang in 2010 * Portrayed by Isko Moreno in the 2014 film, Bonifacio: Ang Unang Pangulo. ==References== * Category:1837 births Category:1872 deaths Category:People executed by ligature strangulation Category:Colegio de San Juan de Letran alumni Category:Filipino Roman Catholic priests Category:People of Spanish colonial Philippines Category:People from Vigan Category:Catholic Church in the Philippines Category:Filipino people of Spanish descent Category:University of Santo Tomas alumni Category:Executed Filipino people Category:19th-century executions by Spain Category:Ilocano people Category:Burials at Paco Park Category:19th-century Roman Catholic priests ",
