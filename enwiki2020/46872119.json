    "text": "Cortinarius caesiophylloides is a species of fungus in the large mushroom genus Cortinarius (subgenus Phlegmacium). Found in Fennoscandia, where it grows on the ground in mesic coniferous forests, it was described as new to science in 2014. The specific epithet caesiophylloides alludes to both its similarity to Cortinarius multiformis var. caesiophyllus (now named C. caesiolamellatus), and the bluish tints in the gills. It has since been found in Slovakia. ==See also== *List of Cortinarius species ==References== ==External links== * caesiophylloides Category:Fungi described in 2014 Category:Fungi of Europe ",
