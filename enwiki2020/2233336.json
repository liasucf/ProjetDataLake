    "text": "Saint John, dated 1881 Trinity (, J\u00e8rriais: La Trinnet\u00e9) is one of the twelve parishes of Jersey in the Channel Islands, and located the north east of the island. Les Platons is the highest point in Jersey. Trinity has the reputation of being the most rural of Jersey's parishes, being the third- largest parish by surface area with the third-smallest population. The parish covers 6,817 verg\u00e9es (). It is home to the States Farm, the Durrell Wildlife Park at Les Augr\u00e8s Manor, the headquarters of the Royal Jersey Agricultural and Horticultural Society at the Royal Jersey Showground, and the Pallot Heritage Steam Museum. The coat of arms of the Parish of Trinity shows the Shield of the Trinity diagram. ==Buildings and monuments== The Parish church, with its distinctive white pyramidal spire, is a notable landmark. The Le Vesconte memorial (erected 1910) takes the form of an obelisk at a crossroads commemorating Philippe Le Vesconte (21 December 1837 - 21 August 1909) who was 10 times elected Constable between 1868\u20131877 and 1890-1909. Trinity Manor is the home of the Seigneur of Trinity. Athelstan Riley purchased Trinity Manor in 1909. Finding the manor house in a ruined condition, he undertook an elaborate restoration (or \"imaginative reconstruction\", which has been criticised as turning the building into a French style ch\u00e2teauThe Bailiwick of Jersey, G. R. Balleine, 1951). The reconstruction was carried out 1910-1913 by C. Messervy to designs by Sir Reginald Blomfield.Portrait of the Channel Islands, Raoul Lempri\u00e8re, 1970 One of the surviving feudal duties of the holder of this fief is to present the Monarch with a pair of mallards when he or she visits the Island. The current holder of the title is Pamela Bell, as Dame of Trinity. ==Culture== Among prominent natives of the parish (les Trinnetais) is Sir Arthur de la Mare (1914\u20131994), a retired ambassador and diplomat in Japan, Thailand and Singapore, who wrote J\u00e8rriais literature in the Trinity dialect. In folklore, the area of Bouley has been reputed to be haunted by the Tchian d'Bou\u00f4l\u00e9 (Black Dog of Bouley), a phantom dog whose appearance presages storms. The story is believed to have been encouraged by smugglers who wanted to discourage nocturnal movements by people who might witness the movement of contraband at the harbour in Bouley. The Jersey Live Music Festival has been held annually at The Royal Jersey Showground since 2004. ==Demographics== ==Administration== ===Subdivisions=== Trinity is divided into the following vingtaines: *La Vingtaine de la Ville-\u00e0-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque *La Vingtaine de Rozel *La Vingtaine du Rondin *La Vingtaine des Augr\u00e8s *La Vingtaine de la Croiserie Trinity elects one Deputy. ==Notable people== * Alan Whicker lived here from the 1960s up until his death in 2013.Death of Alan Whicker ==References== ==External links== * *Trinity Parish Church *La Trinnet\u00e9 at Les Pages J\u00e8rriaises *Coat of arms of Trinity (as they appear on a 1976 1p stamp) Category:Parishes of Jersey ",
