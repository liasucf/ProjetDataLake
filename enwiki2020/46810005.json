Quentin Tarantino wrote \"For most of the movie it looks like a Japanese Yakuza film, plays like a Italian gangster film, and has the fight every ten minutes pace of a Hong Kong chop socky pic, until suddenly, without any proper set up, we find ourselves into the beginning of the film\u2019s extended climax.\" ==Plot== When Chin Fu shows up at a nightclub one night, no one realizes he is the son of a kung-fu master out for revenge for his father's murder.
