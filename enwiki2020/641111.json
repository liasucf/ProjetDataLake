    "text": "DWG (from drawing) is a proprietary binary file format used for storing two- and three- dimensional design data and metadata. It is the native format for several CAD packages including DraftSight, AutoCAD, BricsCAD, IntelliCAD (and its variants), Caddie and Open Design Alliance compliant applications. In addition, DWG is supported non-natively by many other CAD applications. The .bak (drawing backup), .dws (drawing standards), .dwt (drawing template) and .sv$ (temporary automatic save) files are also DWG files. == Version history == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Version !

The DWG format is probably the most widely used format for CAD drawings. Autodesk estimates that in 1998 there were in excess of two billion DWG files in existence. There are several claims to control of the DWG format.DWG: The Registration Attempts & Successes from WorldCAD Access As the biggest and most influential creator of DWG files it is Autodesk who designs, defines, and iterates the DWG format as the native format for their CAD applications. Autodesk sells a read/write library, called RealDWG,Autodesk - Developer Center - RealDWG under selective licensing terms for use in non-competitive applications. Several companies have attempted to reverse engineer Autodesk's DWG format, and offer software libraries to read and write Autodesk DWG files. The most successful is Open Design Alliance,Originally, OpenDWG Alliance. a non-profit consortium created in 1998 by a number of software developers (including competitors to Autodesk), released a read/write/view library called the OpenDWG Toolkit, which was based on the MarComp AUTODIRECT libraries. (ODA has since rewritten and updated that code.) In 1998, Autodesk added file verification to AutoCAD R14.01, through a function called DWGCHECK. This function was supported by an encrypted checksum and product code (called a \"watermark\" by Autodesk), written into DWG files created by the program.Between the Lines: How to identify some problem DWG files In 2006 Autodesk modified AutoCAD 2007, to include \"TrustedDWG technology\", a function which would embed a text string within DWG files written by the program: \"Autodesk DWG. This file is a Trusted DWG last saved by an Autodesk application or Autodesk licensed application.\"This \"TrustedDWG code\" is encoded into DWG files in a fashion that is not humanly readable. This may be validated by using a binary editor to search a DWG file. This helped Autodesk software users ensure that the files they were opening were created by an Autodesk, or RealDWG application, reducing risk of incompatibilities.Autodesk originally used the term \"Trusted DWG\", with an embedded space. They modified it removing the space, prior to filing a US trademark application in September 2006, tarr.uspto.gov AutoCAD would pop up a message, warning of potential stability problems, if a user opened a 2007 version DWG file which did not include this text string. In 2008 the Free Software Foundation asserted the need for an open replacement for the DWG format, as neither RealDWG nor DWGdirect are licensed on terms that are compatible with free software license like the GNU GPL. Therefore, the FSF placed the goal 'Replacement for OpenDWG libraries' in 10th place on their High Priority Free Software Projects list.FSF promotes need for open DWG packages Created in late 2009, GNU LibreDWGGNU LibreDWG is a free software library released under the terms of the GNU GPLv3 license. Despite being currently under development, it can read most parts of DWG files from version R13 up to 2004. Also in 2008 Autodesk and Bentley Systems agreed on exchange of software libraries, including Autodesk RealDWG, to improve the ability to read and write the companies' respective DWG and DGN formats in mixed environments with greater fidelity. In addition, the two companies will facilitate work process interoperability between their AEC applications through supporting the reciprocal use of available Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). === Autodesk trademark === On November 13, 2006, Autodesk sued the Open Design Alliance alleging that its DWGdirect libraries infringed Autodesk's trademark for the word \"Autodesk\", by writing the TrustedDWG watermark (including the word \"AutoCAD\") into DWG files it created. Nine days later, Autodesk's attorneys won a broad and deep temporary restraining order against the Open Design Alliance. In April 2007, the suit was settled, essentially on Autodesk's terms, with Autodesk modifying the warning message in AutoCAD 2008 (to make it somewhat less alarming), and the Open Design Alliance removing support for writing the TrustedDWG watermark from its DWGdirect libraries. The effect of the temporary restraining order and subsequent consent decree was to render the Open Design Alliance's DWGdirect libraries, from one point of view, incapable of creating DWG files that are 100% compatible with AutoCAD Unsubstantiated claim.. Others point out that the failure of \"100% compatibility\" means only that loading such a drawing triggers an essentially irrelevant warning message when the file is opened in AutoCAD. In 2006, Autodesk applied for registration of US trademarks on \"DWG\",Latest Status Info \"DWG EXTREME\",Latest Status Info \"DWG TRUECONVERT\",Latest Status Info \"REALDWG\",Latest Status Info \"DWGX\",Latest Status Info \"DWG TRUEVIEW\".Latest Status InfoDWG TrueConverter USA.autodesk.com As early as 1996, Autodesk has disclaimed exclusive use of the DWG mark in US trademark filings.Latest Status Info Out of these applications, only TRUSTEDDWG has been registered as a trademark by the USPTO. The REALDWG and DWGX registrations were opposed by SolidWorks. The DWG EXTREME, DWG TRUECONVERT, and DWG TRUEVIEW trademark registration applications all received substantial resistance, with the USPTO examining attorney requiring Autodesk to disclaim exclusive use of DWG as a condition for their registration. In a non-final action in May 2007, the USPTO examining attorney refused to register the two DWG marks, as they are \"merely descriptive\" of the use of DWG as a file format name. In September 2007, Autodesk responded, claiming that DWG has gained a \"secondary meaning,\" separate from its use as a generic file format name.United States Patent & Trademark Office As of June 22, 2008, all of Autodesk's DWG-related trademark registration proceedings were suspended by the USPTO, pending disposition of trademark opposition and cancellation petitions Autodesk had filed against the Open Design Alliance and Dassault Syst\u00e8mes SolidWorks Corporation. The USPTO office actions notifying Autodesk of this noted that Autodesk was not the exclusive source of files with the format name DWG, and Autodesk does not control the use of DWG by others, either as a trademark or as a file format name, among other points. In 2006, Autodesk filed an opposition with the USPTO to the trademark registration of DWGGATEWAY by SolidWorks. Autodesk subsequently filed a petition for cancellation of SolidWorks' trademark registration for DWGEDITOR.Ttabvue.uspto.gov In both cases, Autodesk's basis was that they had \"been using the DWG name with its CAD software products since at least as early as 1983.\" The opposition and cancellation actions were consolidated, and suspended pending disposition of Autodesk's US District Court suit against SolidWorks.Ttabvue.uspto.gov In early 2007, Autodesk petitioned the USPTO to cancel the Open Design Alliance's \"OpenDWG\" trademarks, claiming that they had been abandoned.Ttabvue.uspto.gov This cancellation action was suspended pending disposition of Autodesk's US District Court suit against SolidWorks.Ttabvue.uspto.gov In 2008, Autodesk sued SolidWorks in US District Court, arguing that through its marketing efforts, the term \"DWG\" has lost its original generic meaning and taken on a secondary meaning referring specifically to Autodesk's proprietary drawing file format, and therefore any use of \"DWG\" in competitive products amounted to trademark infringement. In January 2010, on the morning that trial was scheduled to begin, Autodesk and SolidWorks settled the suit, with SolidWorks acknowledging Autodesk's trademark rights for DWG, surrendering its trademark registrations for its DWG related projects, and withdrawing its opposition to Autodesk's DWG-related trademark registrations.Complete text of Autodesk's press release - WorldCAD Access In April 2010, Autodesk and the Open Design Alliance settled their suit, with the Open Design Alliance agreeing to cancel its DWG-based trademark registrations and cease use of DWG and DWG-based trademarks in its product marketing and branding. Because there was no adjudication in either case, the agreements between the parties are not binding upon the USPTO. In March 2010, the Office of the Deputy Commissioner for Trademark Examination Policy at the USPTO determined that evidence submitted by the Open Design Alliance two years earlier was relevant and supported a reasonable ground for refusal to register DWG as a trademark.United States Patent & Trademark Office In June 2011 the USPTO issued a final refusal to register DWG as a trademark owned by Autodesk. They were quoted as saying: Autodesk appealed the decision. The USPTO affirmed in 2013 their refusal to recognise DWG as a trademark. Despite this, Autodesk websites still claimed DWG as a trademark after the decision. In late 2014 Autodesk again lost, this time at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The judge dismissed all their arguments. In 2015 Autodesk's website has a section title About DWG in which they try to make a distinction between .dwg as a file format and the DWG technology environment. == DWG Support in Freemium and Free Software == As neither RealDWG nor DWGdirect are licensed on terms that are compatible with free software licenses like the GNU GPL, in 2008 the Free Software Foundation asserted the need for an open replacement for the DWG format. Therefore, the FSF placed the goal 'Replacement for OpenDWG libraries' in 10th place on their High Priority Free Software Projects list. Forked in late 2009 from libDWG, GNU LibreDWG can read most parts of DWG files from version R13 up to 2004. But the libreDWG library, offered under the GNU GPLv3, cannot be used by most targeted FOSS graphic software, such as FreeCAD, LibreCAD and Blender, because of a GPLv2/GPLv3 license incompatibility. A GPLv2 licensed alternative is the libdxfrw project, which can read simple DWGs. FreeCAD is a free and open- source application that can work with the DWG files by using the proprietary ODA File Converter for .dwg and .dxf files from the Open Design Alliance (ODA). The ODA also provides a freeware stand-alone viewer for .dwg and .dgn files, ODA Drawings Explorer, which runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. LibreCAD is a free and open-source 2D CAD application that can open DWG and DXF files using your own library. Autodesk DWG TrueView is a freeware stand- alone DWG viewer with DWG TrueConvert software included, built on the same viewing engine as AutoCAD software. The freeware Autodesk Design Review software adds a possibility to open DWG files in Design Review to take advantage of measure and markup capabilities, sheet set organization, and status tracking. DWG files can be displayed online by ShareCAD, a free online viewer. This service also offers a free IFrame plug-in for viewing DWG files at a site. == See also == * AutoCAD DXF *BricsCAD * CAD * Comparison of CAD software * Comparison of CAD, CAM and CAE file viewers * Design Web Format *FreeCAD *GstarCAD *IntelliCAD *LibreDWG *LibreCAD * OpenDWG * Open Design Alliance * ShareCAD == References == == External links == * LibreDWG is a work in progress developing Free Software libraries to support DWG files. * Teigha is a software development platform used to create engineering applications including CAD with native support of .dwg and .dgn files. * Specification of the .dwg file format provided by Open Design Alliance.
