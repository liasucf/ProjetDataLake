He was a prominent literary figure in the Arabic-speaking world during the 20th century. Some of Halasa's most influential novels include al-Dhahik (Laughter), al-Su\u2019al (The Question), and Sultana.Hamarneh, Walid. 2003. \"Narrative, Memory and Exile in Ghalib Halasa\u2019s Sultanah.\" Edebiyat 14 (1 & 2): 29-37 He was also a long-time member of the Communist Party, no matter what country he was living in. Halasa's views awarded him a life of exile, spending many years in Iraq, Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon. He died in Damascus at the relatively young age of 57, after which his body was returned to Jordan, where he had not been for 34 years (he left Jordan in 1955).Staif, A. N. \"Halasa, Ghalib (1932-89).\" In Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature. Edited by Julie Scott Misaim and Paul Starkey. London and New York: Rutledge 1998. As someone with great command of literary technique and theory, on top of his exceptionally fluid style, Halasa's writings combine smooth reading with complex structuring. This was because he had the ability to draw on diverse narrative techniques and literary tradition. According to comparative literature professor Walid Hamarneh, Halasa wanted to \"[utilize] modern and post-modern techniques in novel writing, while at the same time preserving the great insights and creative achievements of the nineteenth- century realists.\" Hamarneh, Walid. 2003. Narrative, Memory and Exile in Ghalib Halasa\u2019s Sultanah. Edebiyat 14 (1 & 2): 29-37 ==Early life== Ghalib Halasa was born in 1932, in a mostly Christian village called Ma'in, within the Madaba governorate of Jordan. No one knows for sure on which day he was born, but most agree that he was either born on the 3rd or the 18th of December. Fairly early in life, Halasa began reading books in Arabic, French, and English, while also demonstrating strong writing skills at the Christian Mutran boarding school for boys. Specifically, Halasa read a great deal about Marxism, politics, and American literature.http://www.ghalibhalasa.org/ev.html ghalibhalasa.org This interest in American literature manifests later in Halasa's life when he translates into Arabic a biography about William Faulkner, and J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. Following high school, Halasa attended the American University of Beirut, where he received his B.A. in Journalism. For two years, while at the university, Halasa split his time between studying at the American University of Beirut and teaching at a school in Amman, Jordan. While in college, Halasa also became a member of the Communist Party. This resulted in jail-time, including almost two years in a Baghdad prison.http://www.ghalibhalasa.org/ev.html ghalibhalasa.org ==Exile== Forbidden from living in Jordan, Halasa headed to Egypt in 1955. He studied at the American University in Cairo, where he also taught, and began writing articles on various literary topics. Later, Halasa began translating for both the Chinese Embassy and the German Press Agency. Throughout this time, Halasa remained interested and engaged in socialist ideologies and politics.http://www.ghalibhalasa.org/ev.html ghalibhalasa.org After attending protests against Anwar Sadat, Halasa saw time in prison once more, and eventually banishment from Egypt in 1976.Hamarneh, Walid. 2003. Narrative, Memory and Exile in Ghalib Halasa\u2019s Sultanah. Edebiyat 14 (1 & 2): 29-37 After exile from Egypt, he spent time in numerous countries: Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Germany, and lastly Syria, where he died. In 1982, Halasa fought alongside the Palestinians in the Lebanon War.Staif, A. N. \"Halasa, Ghalib (1932-89).\" In Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature. Edited by Julie Scott Misaim and Paul Starkey. London and New York: Rutledge 1998. ==Works== Halasa authored two collections of short stories, seven novels, four books of literary criticism, and three other books of various natures. He also translated several books from English.Staif, A. N. \"Halasa, Ghalib (1932-89).\" In Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature. Edited by Julie Scott Misaim and Paul Starkey.
