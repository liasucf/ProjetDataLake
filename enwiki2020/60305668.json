Caitlin is interrupted by Dana who questions her about the same picture that Nolan was blackmailing her with. Claire gives Caitlin a present she found in Nolan's room that she assumes was for her upcoming birthday. Claire also agrees to keep the photos that Nolan was blackmailing Caitlin with under wraps. Mona learns that the suspicious activity on her account came from one single source and she assumes that someone is trying to frame her. Caitlin visits Ava and gives her the present that she received from Claire. While practicing his cello Dylan's tablet is hacked and a photo which could possibly be used to blackmail him is the only thing showing up. Dana shows up in Dylan's room and asks him if his secrets are safe with Caitlin and Ava. Ava admits to Caitlin and Dylan that the night Nolan died she followed him out to a mysterious cabin in the woods. The three of them visit the cabin and begin searching it. They realize that they were followed to the cabin and try to hide but Alison walks in before they can. Ava tells Alison that the night Nolan died she followed him out there and that he met a blond woman who looked similar to Alison. While Ava, Caitlin, and Dylan are driving back they find a dead rat in a box in the car with a note. Alison doubles back to the cabin and removes a flower from a shelf she thinks could be a clue. When scrolling through Instagram later, Alison finds a photo of Taylor's grave which includes the same flower she found in the cabin. Alison visits Mona and tells Mona her theory of Taylor being alive. When Caitlin is walking home she crosses paths with Mason who drops a gum wrapper similar to the one she, Ava and Dylan found in the woods leading her to believe that he was the one eavesdropping on them in the woods the night of Nolan's murder. ==Production== ===Development=== Norman Buckley served as the episodes tech scout.
