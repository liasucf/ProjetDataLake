    "text": "Ice hockey, partially because of its popularity as a major professional sport, has been a source of inspiration for numerous films, television episodes and songs in North American popular culture. ==Films== A number of notable Hollywood films have been made about hockey. Notable hockey films include Slap Shot; The Mighty Ducks, successful enough to spawn two sequels, a cartoon series, and an NHL team named the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim (now the Anaheim Ducks); and Miracle. The first two are fictional comedies; the last is a drama based on the true story of the 1980 \"Miracle on Ice\" USA Olympic gold medal team. Other hockey films include Youngblood, Hockey Night, MVP: Most Valuable Primate, H-E Double Hockey Sticks, Mystery, Alaska, The Rocket: The Maurice Richard Story, The Sweater, ' and the 1937 John Wayne film Idol of the Crowds. One of the earliest commercial films that featured the sport prominently was the 1972 Canadian production Face-Off, starring Art Hindle. Many other films are less hockey-oriented but nonetheless prominently involve the sport. Ice Angel involves a male ice hockey player who dies and comes back to life in the body of a female figure skater. Both Happy Gilmore and The Cutting Edge centre around failed hockey players using their talents for other sports (golf and figure skating, respectively), while Wayne's World contains a number of prominent references to the sport during the film. The movie Big Daddy features actor Adam Sandler watching a hockey game involving the New York Rangers.

In another Boston-based movie, The Friends of Eddie Coyle, Eddie (played by Robert Mitchum) is taken to a Boston Bruins game (against the Chicago Black Hawks during the 1972-1973 season at the old Boston Garden) right before he is killed. Upon watching Bruins great Bobby Orr, he states \"Can you imagine being a kid like that? What is he, 24 or something? Greatest hockey player in the world. Number four \u2013 Bobby Orr. Geeze, what a future he\u2019s got, huh?\" The Canadian buddy cop film Bon Cop, Bad Cop features a by-the-book English Canadian teamed with a rule-bending French Canadian to investigate a series of murders connected to professional hockey. In Quebec, the movie Les Boys is a cult classic for many hockey fans, enough to spawn three sequels. The fourth installment of Les Boys featured \"Hockey Legends\" such as Guy Lafleur, Pierre Bouchard, Martin Brodeur, Yvon Lambert and more. Hockey has also been referenced many times in the series of movies known as the View Askew Movies, which were written and directed by Actor/Director/Writer/Hockey Fan, Kevin Smith. His first movie, Clerks, featured a street hockey game played on the roof of a store, however many of the players in the game wore ice hockey jerseys, including jerseys of the New Jersey Devils, Pittsburgh Penguins and the Soviet Union.

It also plays a part in Disney Channel original movies Go Figure and Genius, and romantic comedy Just Friends. The movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off features Ferris's best friend Cameron wearing a vintage Detroit Red Wings Gordie Howe jersey through most of the movie.

In the film, The Love Guru, Mike Myers is hired by the Toronto Maple Leafs as a counsel to their star player.

Then Avalanche team is replaced (on their suggestion) by 2- and 3-year-old kids due to \"mental hell they had\" (kids were meant to play with other kids between intermissions and they promised to their friend suffering leukemia that they will win for him). Kids obviously cannot rivalize with professional hockey players and they lose 31-2 and in addition all kids are getting injured due to extremely brutal play from Red Wings including intentional skate kicks and punching. Red Wings are celebrating win and kid with leukemia dies just because they lost match, so he lost with sickness. Also in the episode \"It's Christmas in Canada\", when the boys are in Canada, one of the members of the Canadian crowd is an ice hockey player, no doubt a reference to the popularity of the sport in Canada.

Angela asks Tony what the red circle on the ice is for, and Tony indicates that it is blood (humorously furthering the stereotype of hockey violence). In Scrubs, Dr. Cox frequently wears a Detroit Red Wings jersey while not at the hospital; this is because of John C. McGinley's real-life friendship with Red Wings defenceman Chris Chelios. Joey from Full House also frequently wears Detroit Red Wings jerseys on the show, while his room is also decorated with several pieces of Detroit Red Wings decorations.

At the beginning of the episode Unfaithful a homeless man is offered a New York Rangers sweatshirt to which he jokingly responds \"Are you crazy? We're here in Jersey\". The cold opener of the season 8 episode Perils of Paranoia features an attorney knocking down an alibi by demonstrating that the defendant read about a New Jersey Devils game in the paper rather than watching it on TV.

Hockey is central in homegrown television and movies such as the CBC Television series Hockey: A People's History and Hockeyville, the Global TV reality show Making The Cut: Last Man Standing, as well as scripted shows like CTV's Power Play (1998\u20132000) and Showcase's Rent-a-Goalie (2006\u20132008). In the popular Canadian animated series The Raccoons, ice hockey played a big role in the 1981 special 'The Raccoons on Ice'. CBC and its French language division, SRC, have made several entries into the He Shoots, He Scores/Lance et Compte franchise. The original series was filmed in both French and English, while subsequent series and movies have just been in French. The CBC premiered the hockeydrama MVP in January 2008. Long running Canadian comedy series, The Red Green Show, incorporated a hockey reference on each program as Red Green would end each show by saying: \"Keep your stick on the ice.\" ===Japan=== The Fuji TV-produced drama Pride (2004) centred on Satonaka Haru, played by Takuya Kimura, whose life revolves around ice hockey and dreams of moving to Canada to play in the NHL. ===United Kingdom=== In the UK there was a Pingu episodes called Pingu Plays Ice Hockey produced in 1989 and features Pingu, Robby, Pongi, and various hockey players. ==Comics== Charles Schulz's character Snoopy is well known for his love of ice hockey.

In the off-season, Snoopy would sometimes \u201cskate\u201d barefooted atop his doghouse, wielding his hockey stick, and fantasizing about winning the Stanley Cup. Linus, watching from below, would be the \u201chockey fans\u201d. In one strip, Linus challenges Snoopy: \"Prove to me that you're a real hockey player.\" Snoopy grins, revealing that several of his front teeth have been knocked out. Linus walks away, convinced. In later years, Snoopy would play ice hockey with his bird pal Woodstock and his bird friends, using a frozen birdbath as the skating rink.
