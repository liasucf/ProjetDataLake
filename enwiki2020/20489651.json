    "text": "Marzouq Ali Thunayan Al-Ghanim (b. 3 November 1968, Abdullah Al-Salem, Kuwait) is the current speaker of the Kuwaiti National Assembly, representing the second district. Al-Ghanim earned a BSc in mechanical engineering from Seattle University and worked for Boubyan Petrochemical Company before being elected to the National Assembly in 2006. He is the son of Ali Mohammed Thunayan Al- Ghanim and Faiza Al-Kharafi. He was elected as the Speaker in 2013.Former Presidents of the National Assembly ==Family Background== Marzouq Al-Ghanim's father, Ali Mohammed Thunayan Al-Ghanim is the Chairman of Ali Alghanim & Sons Company, a multi-line conglomerate which includes the BMW car dealership in Kuwait, and is formerly the Chairman of the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and Industry. His paternal uncle, Fouad Mohammed Thunayan Alghanim, is Chairman of Fouad Alghanim & Sons Group of Companies, a multi-line conglomerate consisting of a number of fully and partly owned subsidiary companies based in the U.S., Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Ethnically, the Al-Ghanim claim descent from the 30 or so Bani Utub families (historically urban Sunnis from Najd known locally as \"Neyada\") which settled Kuwait along with the Sabah and by the first decades of the twentieth century comprised the narrow and well- established elite. Marzouq Al-Ghanim's mother, Faiza Al-Kharafi, is a former proctor of Kuwait University and heir to the M. A. Kharafi & Sons conglomerate. His maternal uncle, Jassem Al-Kharafi was speaker of the Kuwait National Assembly for 12 years. ==Political Career== On December 19, 2006, parliament voted 39-20 to reject a bill that would have seen the government write off $27bn of its citizens' private debts. Marzouq al-Ghanem voted against the bill, telling the assembly, \"What do we tell those who did not borrow? What do we tell those who paid back their loans or part of their loans?\" On April 25, 2007, MP Saleh Ashour called in a statement for reopening Kuwait's embassy in Baghdad and for strongly supporting the government in Baghdad. But al-Ghanim said he believes that it was too early to reopen the Kuwaiti embassy in Baghdad and that this issue should wait until security situations improve. On February 8, 2008, al-Ghanim, as head of the Youth and Sports Committee, agreed reform the Kuwaiti football program in line with the recommendations of FIFA. In November 2007, FIFA had suspended Kuwait from all international matches because of governmental interference in the national football program. The dispute originated with Kuwait's October 9 elections for key posts in the country's soccer federation. FIFA and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) refused to recognise the polls. FIFA said Kuwait had ignored the two bodies' \"road map\" of reforms requiring them to set up an interim board to organize fresh elections and draft new guidelines to prevent governmental interference in the game. On September 28, 2008, al-Ghanim, along with MPs Abdullah Al-Roumi, Ali Al-Rashid, and Adel Al-Saraawi have proposed a draft law which suggests that the government fund Kuwaiti students' higher education at private colleges. According to the bill, the government would bear half of the expenses for students enrolled in private universities in Kuwait, excluding Kuwait University. On December 28, 2008, Kuwaiti lawmakers Mikhled Al-Azmi, Musallam Al-Barrak, Marzouq al-Ghanim, Jaaman Al-Harbash, Ahmad Al-Mulaifi, Mohammad Hayef Al-Mutairi, Ahmad Al-Saadoun, Nasser Al-Sane, and Waleed Al-Tabtabaie protested in front of the National Assembly building against the attacks by Israel on Gaza. Protesters burned Israeli flags, waved banners reading, \"No to hunger, no to submission\" and chanted \"Allahu Akbar\". Israel launched air strikes against Hamas in the Gaza Strip on December 26 after a six-month ceasefire ended on December 18. In October, 2017, Al-Ghanim, speaking at an Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, stated that the Israeli delegates \"represents the most dangerous form of terrorism: state terrorism\" and told the Israeli delegates to get their things and leave the hall. The Israeli delegation did leave after overwhelming applause from parliamentarians from other countries present at the meeting.ISRAEL CALLED 'CHILD MURDERERS' AT INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION, MAY QUIT, Lahav Harkov, October 18, 2017, Jerusalem Post == Other posts == * President of the GCC Parliamentary Union 2018 - Present * President of the Arab Inter-Parliamentary Union 2013-2016 * President of the Arab Geopolitical Group of the IPU 2013-2016 * Vice-President of the IPU , Representative of the Arab Group on the Executive Committee of the IPU 2011-2102 * Chairman of the financial and Economic Committee 2012 * Member of the Committee on Budget and Final Accounts 2009/2012 * Vice-President of Kuwait Inter-Parliamentary Group 2011 * Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs 2009 * Member of the committee on Financial and Economic Affairs 2006/2008/2009 * Member of the committee on the response to the Amiri Speech 2008/2009 * Rapporteur of the investigation committee in the circumstances of a citizens death during police investigations 2009 * Member of the Arab transitional Parliament 2007/2011 * Chariman of the committee on Youth and Sports 2006/2008 * Member of the committee on protection of public Fund 2006 * Honorary President of Kuwait Sports Club 2012 * Member of the Kuwaiti Engineers Association * Member of the Mechanical Engineers Association ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Kuwaiti people of Arab descent Category:Members of the National Assembly of Kuwait Category:Speakers of the National Assembly of Kuwait ",
