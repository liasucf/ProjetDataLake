Established in 1859, Randwick is the second-oldest local government area in New South Wales, after the City of Sydney. It comprises an area of and as at the had a population of . The Mayor of the City of Randwick is Cr. Danny Said, a member of NSW Labor, who was elected on 25 September 2019. == Suburbs and localities in the local government area == Suburbs and localities in the City of Randwick are: These localities are also serviced by Randwick Council: == History == Indigenous Australian history in the area dates back tens of thousands of years. The local people at the time of colonisation were the Cadigal of the Dharug language group. European settlement led to the deaths of many Cadigal via introduced diseases or in conflict with settlers. The surviving Cadigal left the area or were pushed to the fringes of settlement. By the mid-nineteenth century, the original tribal groupings had been effectively destroyed. The name Randwick comes from the village of Randwick in Gloucestershire, England, birthplace of the district's first mayor Simeon Henry Pearce. The area was home to a few wealthy landowners and the poor residents of several shantytowns until the 1880s, when the coming of trams from Sydney brought extensive suburban development. This development continued steadily, with new tram lines (long since demolished) opening up most of the city for subdivision by the early 1900s. The New South Wales University of Technology opened at Kensington in 1949 on the site of Kensington Racecourse, eventually becoming the University of New South Wales. A 2015 review of local government boundaries recommended that the City of Randwick merge with the Waverley and Woollahra councils to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately . Following an independent review, in May 2016 the NSW Government sought to dismiss the Council and force its amalgamation with Woollahra and Waverley councils. Woollahra Council instigated legal action claiming that there was procedural unfairness and that a KPMG report at the centre of merger proposals had been \"misleading\". The matter was heard before the NSW Court of Appeal who, in December 2016, unanimously dismissed Woollahra Council's appeal, finding no merit in its arguments that the proposed merger with Waverley and Randwick councils was invalid. In July 2017, the Berejiklian government decided to abandon the forced merger of the Woollahra, Waverley and Randwick local government areas, along with several other proposed forced mergers. ===Town Clerks and General Managers=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Name !Term !Notes |- | | | |- | Ernest Henry Strachan | 12 May 1898 \u2013 1912 | |- | William Kirby Percival | 8 February 1912 \u2013 | |- | | | |- | Richard Thomas Latham | 1938 \u2013 1963 | |- | R.
