    "text": "1257 M\u00f3ra, provisional designation , is an asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 15 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 8 August 1932, by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named after Hungarian astronomer . == Orbit and classification == M\u00f3ra orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.3\u20132.7 AU once every 3 years and 11 months (1,434 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 4\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. Identified as , it was first observed at Heidelberg and Algiers Observatory in 1928, extending the body's observation arc by 4 years prior to its official discovery observation. == Physical characteristics == === Rotation period === American astronomer Richard Binzel and French amateur astronomer Ren\u00e9 Roy obtained three rotational light curves of M\u00f3ra from photometric observation taken in 1983 and 2009/11, respectively. Light curve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period between 2.28 and 2.30 hours with a change in brightness of 0.23 to 0.43 magnitude (). The short period is just above the threshold of 2.2 hours for the so-called fast rotators. === Diameter, albedo and spectral type === According to the space-based surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, M\u00f3ra measures between 14.72 and 21.47 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.051 and 0.10. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony S-type asteroids of 0.20 and derives a shorter diameter of 10.79 kilometers, while Richard Binzel classified it as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid during his photometric observations in the 1980s. == Naming == This minor planet was named in honour of Hungarian astronomer K\u00e1roly M\u00f3ra (1899\u20131938). The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 (). As a curiosity, astronomer Paul Wild reshuffled the letters and numbers of the designation \"1257 Mora\" to construct a name for his discovery 2517 Orma in 1968 (' also means \"trace, track\" in Italian). == References == == External links == * Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info) * Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books * Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Observatoire de Gen\u00e8ve, Raoul Behrend * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center * * 001257 Category:Discoveries by Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth Category:Minor planets named for people Category:Named minor planets 19320808 ",
