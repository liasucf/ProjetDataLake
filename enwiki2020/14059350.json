    "text": "Ragnar Hult in the early 1880s. Ragnar Hult (4 March 1857 \u2013 25 September 1899) was a Finnish botanist and plant geographer. He was a forerunner in developing a methodology for vegetation survey. He emphasized the physiognomy of vegetation and paid less attention to its ecology. His ideas were much- followed in Sweden, making him the real father of the \"Uppsala school\" in plant sociology.Trass, H. & N. Malmer, 1978. \u201cNorth European approaches to classification.\u201d Pp 201\u2013245 in R. H. Whittaker (ed.). Classification of plant communities. Dr. W. Junk Publ., den Haag. Ragnar Hult was the first (1881) to publish a comprehensive study of ecological succession as it is taking place in a given region. He was the first to recognize that a relatively large number of pioneer plant communities give way to a comparatively small number of relatively stable communities.Cowles, Henry C.
