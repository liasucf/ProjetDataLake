    "text": "The Roman Catholic Diocese of Geneva was a Latin Catholic diocese in part of Switzerland and Savoy from 400 to 1801 when it merged with the Diocese of Chamb\u00e9ry. The merged diocese later lost Swiss territory to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg. ==History== Geneva was first recorded as a border town, fortified against the Helvetii (Celto-Germanic people). In 120 BC, Geneva was conquered by the Romans. In 443 AD, Geneva became part of the Kingdom of Burgundy. In 534 AD, it fell to the Franks. In 888 AD, Geneva was returned to the Kingdom of Burgundy. In 1033, it was taken into the Kingdom of Germany. The position of the first Bishop of Geneva is ascribed to multiple individuals. Gregorio Leti (1630 1701) and Besson, wrote of the legend that Geneva was Christianised by Dionysius the Areopagite and Paracodus, two of the seventy-two disciples, in the time of Domitian (51 91 AD). Paracodus legendarily became the first Bishop of Geneva. However, this is based on an error of language. The error arises from the similarity of the Latin names ' (Geneva in Switzerland) and ' (Genoa in Italy). The Catalogue de St. Pierre, which records that Diogenes was the first Bishop of Geneva, is untrustworthy. A letter from St. Eucherius to Salvius indicates that St. Isaac of Monteluco (c. 400 AD) was the first Bishop of Geneva. Another legend holds that Lazarus of Bethany (Saint Lazarus) was the first Bishop of Geneva. In 440 AD, a record suggests St. Salonius may have been the Bishop of Geneva. Salonius was the son of St. Eucherius. Eucherius dedicated his \"Instructiones\" to Salonius. Salonius took part in the Council of Orange (441 AD) and in the Councils of Vaison (442 AD) and Arles (c. 455 AD). Salonius may have authored two small commentaries, In Parabolas Salomonis and On Ecclesiastics. Little is known about the bishops who followed Salonius. Theoplastus (c. 475 AD) was the recipient of a letter from St. Sidonius Apollinaris. When Dormitianus (before 500 AD) was bishop, Princess Sedeleuba van Bourgondi\u00eb, a sister of Queen Clotilde, had the remains of the martyr, St. Victor of Solothurn moved to Geneva. Sedeleuba built a basilica in the martyr's honor. Maximus of Geneva (c. 512 541 AD), corresponded with Avitus, Archbishop of Vienne and Cyprian of Toulon. In 541 AD, Bishop Pappulus sent Thoribiusas, a priest, to represent him at the Fourth Council of Orl\u00e9ans. Bishop Salonius II is only known from his signatures at the Synod of Lyons (570 AD) and the Synod of Paris (573 AD). In 584 AD, Cariatto was made Bishop of Geneva by King Guntram. In 585 AD, Bishop Cariatto attended the synod of Valence and the Synod of Macon. The Bishopric (office of bishop) of Geneva was a suffragan (subordinate) of the Archbishopric of Vienne. From 1154, the bishops of Geneva had the status of Prince of the Holy Roman Empire. However, their independence was curtailed by the advocati (the ecclesiastical overseers appointed by the archbishop), the Counts of Geneva and later, the Counts of Savoy. In 1290, the Counts of Savoy obtained the right to elect the Bishop of Geneva's Vidame (bishop's lieutenant). Fran\u00e7ois de Candie of Chamb\u00e9ry-Le-Vieux was one such Vidame. In 1387, Bishop Adh\u00e9mar Fabry granted Geneva its charter ensuring the city's rights and institutional continuity.Geneva, Imperial city and Episcopal principality (11th-16th century) University of Geneva. Accessed 29 December 2017 Subsequent bishops were expected to affirm the charter. In 1394, the Counts of Geneva's line ended with no further issue. The House of Savoy sought to take its place. After 1416, members of the House of Savoy took the title \"Duke\". They maneuvered to elevate their members to the Bishop of Geneva's diocesan staff. The City of Geneva responded by making an alliance with the Old Swiss Confederacy, an Eidgenossenschaft. In 1526, Geneva aligned with Berne and Fribourg. Jean P\u00e9colat (in French) being tortured in 1517 under the order of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Savoie (in French), Bishop of Geneva In the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation caused great change in the religious and political life of Geneva. Prior to the reformation, the Diocese of Geneva extended well into Savoy, as far as Mont Cenis and the Great St Bernard Pass. It also included Nyon. However, under the rule of Charlemagne (742 814) Tarantaise was detached from Geneva to form a separate diocese. The bishops of Geneva ruled over 8 chapters, 423 parishes, 9 abbeys and 68 priories. During the Reformation, the City of Berne supported the Protestant Reformers, including William Farel (1489 1565) and Antoine Froment (1508 1581). The City of Fribourg supported the Catholic Church and in 1531, renounced its alliance with Geneva. In 1536, John Calvin (1509 1564) went to Geneva, but was expelled after disagreement over details of the Easter eucharist. He returned to Geneva in 1541 and lived there until his death. Geneva became a stronghold of Calvinism. In 1532, the Bishop of Geneva was removed from his seat. In 1535, he established his see in Annecy and in 1536 at Gex. Francis de Sales (1567 1622) was Bishop of Geneva. He held the position from 1602 to 1621. Through his devotion, many in the diocese returned to Catholicism. In 1802, under the rule of Napoleon, the Diocese was annexed to France and united with the Diocese of Chamb\u00e9ry. In 1814, at the Congress of Vienna Geneva was extended to cover 15 Savoyard and 6 French parishes. This included 16,000 people of the Catholic faith. Geneva was also admitted to the Swiss Confederation. The Congress of Vienna and the Treaty of Turin (1816) provided protection to the Catholic religion in Geneva. In 1819, Pope Pius VII united the City of Geneva and twenty parishes with the Diocese of Lausanne. In 1822, the area belonging to the Diocese of Geneva but beyond the borders of Switzerland became the Diocese of Annecy. The Cantonal Council abandoned previous agreements. In imitation of the French Organic Articles (laws regarding public worship) the Cantonal Council requested a placet (an acceptance by civil authorities of canon law). Etienne Marilley (1804\u20131889) became the parish priest of Geneva in 1831 and was ordained bishop in 1846. This was the time of Kulturkampf. For instance, discord arose concerning public financial support for the Protestant and Old Catholic Churches, while the Roman Catholic Church received none. On 30 June 1907, Geneva voted for the separation of church and state. ==Episcopal ordinaries== (all Roman Rite) ;Suffragan Bishops of Geneva (Genf, Gen\u00e8ve) * Hugo (993\u20131020) * Bernardus (1020\u20131030) * Adalgod (1020\u20131030) * Konrad (1020\u20131030) * Fridericus (1030\u20131073) * Boczadus (1073\u20131083) * Guy de Faucigny (1083\u20131119) * Humbert de Grammont (1120\u20131135) * Arducius de Faucigny (1135\u20131185) * Nantelmus (1185\u20131205) * Bernard Chabert (1205\u20131213) * Pierre de Sessons (1213\u20131213) * Aymo de Grandson (1215\u20131260) * Heinrich (1260\u20131267) * Aymon de Cruseilles (1268\u20131275) * Robert de Gen\u00e8ve (1276\u20131287) * Guillaume de Conflans (1287\u20131294) * Martin de Saint-Germain (1295\u20131303) * Aimone de Quart (1304\u20131311) * Pierre de Faucigny (1311\u20131342) * Alamand de Saint-Jeoire (1342\u20131366) * Guillaume de Marcossey (1366\u20131377) * Jean de Murol was born in France.
