It was released on 17 March 2017. ==Plot== The movie tells the story of an Indian immigrant Karamjit Singh (Jimmy Sheirgill) to Canada. He stays there illegally with his friend Debu (Rajiv Thakur) and his dog Dabbu. One fateful night, Debu is arrested and detained by the police. Karma starts living elsewhere, where he falls in love with his neighbour Saggi (Sargun Mehta). Eesh (Neeru Bajwa) is an emerging pop singer, who has differences with her family. Upon the advice of a lawyer, Eesh and Karma decide to get married temporarily, helping him gain a permanent residency, and allowing Eesh the freedom of living alone. But a guilt-ridden Karma tells Sargi the truth, which causes her to walk away from his life. Eesh attempts suicide after her band ditches her, and Karma saves her life and makes her realize the value of her family. Eesh falls in love with him, while Karma still waits for Saggi. Saggi returns to India upon learning that Eesh loves him. When he comes to know about this, he decides to let go of the Canadian citizenship, and instead flies back to India to win her back. He is re-united with Debu (who had been deported) and Saggi. ==Cast== * Jimmy Sheirgill as Karamjeet Singh * Neeru Bajwa as Ishh * Sargun Mehta as Saggi * Rajiv Thakur * Sonia Dhillon Tully as Nimmi * Balinder Johal == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Award ! scope=\"col\" | Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\" | Category ! scope=\"col\" | Recipient ! scope=\"col\" | Result |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"12\" |Filmfare Awards Punjabi | rowspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 23 March 2018 | Best Actor | Jimmy Sheirgill | |- | Best Actor Critics | Jimmy Sheirgill | |- | Best Actress | Neeru Bajwa | |- | Best Actress Critics | Neeru Bajwa | |- | Best Director | Navaniat Singh | |- | Best Actor in supporting role | Rajiv Thakur | |- | Best Music Album | Jaidev Kumar & Arjunaa Harjai | |- | Best Lyrics | Kumaar | |- | Best playback singer(female) | Jasmine Sandlas | |- | Best Sound Design | Anand Pawar | |- | Best Background Score | Raju Singh | |- | Best Cinematography | Harmeet Singh | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"12\" | PTC Punjabi Film Awards | rowspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 30 March 2018 | Best Film | Jindua | |- | Best Actor | Jimmy Sheirgill | |- | Best Actress | Neeru Bajwa | |- | Best Director | Navaniat Singh | |- | Most Popular Song | Jindua | |- | Best Playback Singer | Jasmine Sandlas | |- | Best Music Director | Jaidev Kumar | |- | Best Lyricist | Kumaar | |- | Best Dialogues | Balraj syal & Amarjeet singh | |- | Best Story | Dheeraj Rattan | |- | Best Cinematography | Harmeet Singh | |- | Best Background Score | Raju Singh | |- |} ==References== Category:2010s Punjabi-language films ",
