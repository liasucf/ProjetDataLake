    "text": "The PWG World Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling world tag team championship contested for in the tag team division of the Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) promotion. It was created and debuted on January 25, 2004, at PWG's Tango & Cash Invitational \u2013 Night Two event, where B-Boy and Homicide were crowned the inaugural champions. Being a professional wrestling championship, title reigns are not won legitimately; they are instead won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline. The title has been referred to as the PWG Tag Team Championship and as the PWG World Tag Team Championship since 2004. There have been a total of 36 reigns among 38 wrestlers and 27 teams. The current champions are The Rascalz (Zachary Wentz and Dezmond Xavier), who are in their first reign both individually and collectively. == History == On January 25, 2004, PWG debuted their version of a tag team championship, which they named the PWG Tag Team Championship. B-Boy and Homicide won a two night tournament named the Tango & Cash Invitational to become the first champions at Tango & Cash Invitational \u2013 Night Two. The championship was defended for the first time outside the United States on February 18, 2006, when then-champions, Davey Richards and Super Dragon, defeated Cape Fear (El Generico and Quicksilver) in Essen, Germany at PWG's European Vacation \u2013 Germany event. After this event and one held on February 19, 2006 in Orpington, England where the championship was defended once again, PWG renamed the championship to the PWG World Tag Team Championship. The championship later changed hands for the first time outside the United States on October 27, 2007, at PWG's European Vacation II \u2013 England event, where then-champions Kevin Steen and El Generico were defeated by Davey Richards and Super Dragon in Portsmouth, England. On July 27, 2014, Candice LeRae became the first female wrestler to hold the title, when she and Joey Ryan defeated The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) to become the new champions. On June 16, 2017, Penta el Zero M and Rey Fenix successfully defended the title in Ciudad Nezahualc\u00f3yotl, Mexico. == Reigns == The inaugural champions were B-Boy and Homicide, who won the championship by defeating the team of The American Dragon and Super Dragon in the finals of the Tango & Cash Invitational Tag Team Tournament on January 25, 2004, at PWG's Tango & Cash Invitational \u2013 Night Two event. At 801 days and counting, The Rascalz (Zachary Wentz and Dezmond Xavier) are the longest reigning tag team champions in their first reign. The Unbreakable F'n Machines' (Brian Cage and Michael Elgin) only reign, Monster Mafia's (Ethan Page and Josh Alexander) only reign and the Beaver Boys' (Alex Reynolds and John Silver) only reign share the record for the shortest in the title's history at less than one day. PWG publishes a list of successful championship defenses (victories against challengers for the championship) for each champion on their official website, unlike most other professional wrestling promotions, for unknown reasons. As of , The Young Bucks have the most defenses, with 15; Twelve teams are tied for having the least, with 0. Those teams and reigns are B-Boy's and Homicide's only reign, The X\u2013Foundation/The Dynasty (Joey Ryan and Scott Lost)'s first and second reigns, Chris Bosh's and Quicksilver's only reign, The Aerial Xpress (Quicksilver and Scorpio Sky)'s only reign, Davey Richards and Roderick Strong's only reign, B-Boy and Super Dragon's second reign, Jack Evans and Roderick Strong's only reign, The Age of the Fall (Jimmy Jacobs and Tyler Black)'s only reign, the Unbreakable F'n Machines' (Brian Cage and Michael Elgin) only reign, Monster Mafia's (Ethan Page and Josh Alexander) only reign, the Beaver Boys' (Alex Reynolds and John Silver) only reign and Andrew Everett and Trevor Lee's only reign. The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) hold the record for most reigns, with four. As of , Zachary Wentz and Dezmond Xavier are the current champions in their first reign both individually and collectively. They defeated previous champions The Chosen Bros (Jeff Cobb and Matthew Riddle) and The Young Bucks (Matt and Nick Jackson) in a three-way match on April 20, 2018, to win the championship. Overall, there have been 36 reigns among 38 wrestlers and 27 teams. == Notes == :1. \u2013 Though the event \"Eleven\" started on July 26, 2014, the title change took place after midnight on July 27. == References == == External links == * Pro Wrestling Guerrilla.com * PWG World Tag Team Championship reign history Category:Pro Wrestling Guerrilla championships Category:Tag team wrestling championships ",
