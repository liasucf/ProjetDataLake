By the 1930s there were 10,000 of Polish descent, and Omaha claimed the largest such community of the Great Plains.Radzilowski, J. (2004) \"Poles\", p 243 in Wishart, D.J. (ed) Encyclopedia of the Great Plains, University of Nebraska Press. According to the 2000 United States Census, Omaha had a total population of 390,112 residents, of whom 18,447 claimed Polish ancestry.\"Census 2000 Demographic Profile Highlights: Selected Population Group: Polish (142-143)\", United States Census Bureau.

More arrived in the 1880s, but most after 1900.Peattie, E.W. (1895) \"How they live at Sheely: Pen picture of a strange settlement and its queer inhabitants\", Impertinences: Selected Writings of Elia Peattie, a Journalist in the Gilded Age, University of Nebraska Press, reprint 2005, p. 61. The state of Nebraska, and Omaha in particular, was advertised heavily in Poland as a destination for jobs starting in 1877 by the Chicago-based Polish Roman Catholic Union of America and the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad. Ralph Modjeski, a Polish- American civil engineer, helped build the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge in Omaha in 1872.Duszak, T. \"A Tribute to Ralph Modjeski\", Polish-American Center. Retrieved 5/7/08. Poles continued to immigrate to Omaha, with most coming in the early 20th century, before immigration was reduced by World War I and new laws in 1923. By the 1930s South Omaha counted more than 10,000 Polish residents. As with other early 20th-century European immigrants, their industrial jobs contrasted with their traditional farming and rural pasts.Gladsky, T.S. (1992) Princes, Peasants, and Other Polish Selves: Ethnicity in American, University of Massachusetts Press, p. 81. Many were employed by the Omaha Stockyards and the meatpacking plants throughout the area.Radzilowski, J. (2004) \"Poles,\" p 243 in Wishart, D.J.

They included the Polish Roman Catholic Union, the Polish Union of the United States, the National Alliance, the Pulaski Club, the Polish Welfare Club and the Polish Citizens' Club.Larsen and Cottrell. (2002) The Gate City: A history of Omaha. University of Nebraska Press. p 161.

Nellie Tayloe Ross, the first woman to serve as governor of an American State, taught at a school in one of Omaha's Polish neighborhoods in the late 1890s.Scheer, T.J.

University of Missouri Press. p 225. ===St. Paul's incident=== In 1891 several Polish families constructed a Roman Catholic church at South 29th and Elm Streets in the Sheelytown neighborhood. That year Father T. Jakimowicz arrived from Elba, Nebraska, but left after a few years because of \"misunderstandings\" with the congregation. Dissidents within the congregation put forward Stephen Kaminski, a Polish nationalist and Franciscan friar, as their priest. The bishop did not agree with this choice (and at that time, parishioners did not have the right to choose). Those who supported Kaminski held title to the building and its land. The courts ruled on March 27, 1895 that the Roman Catholic bishop (or diocese) legally owned the church and land. Before the dispute was resolved, supporters took sides and burned down the church. The diocese reorganized the parish afterwards, distributing residents among other churches,Peattie, E.W. (1895) \"How they live at Sheely: Pen picture of a strange settlement and its queer inhabitants\", in (2005) Impertinences: Selected Writings of Elia Peattie, a Journalist in the Gilded Age.

They organized dances to compete with the \"loose establishments\" in the area. These caused a stir among local residents and were held for many years.Peattie, E.W.

University of North Carolina Press, pp. 402-410. Immigration was slowed by the World Wars and changes in US immigration law in 1923, which decreased the numbers arriving from Central Europe. After WWII, Communist rule in Poland cut off immigration. Few new Polish immigrants arrived until the reduction of the Soviet Union's influence and the Solidarity-era in Poland.Sisson, R., Zacher, C.K., Cayton, A.R.L., and Zacher, C. (2007) The American Midwest: An Interpretive Encyclopedia. University of Indiana Press. p 233. ==Present== As ethnic Polish descendants assimilated and moved to the suburbs, their old neighborhoods were filled by new immigrants, chiefly Mexican immigrants and other Latinos.
