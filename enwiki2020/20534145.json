He knew the constituency well, having represented it on the LCC. He held the seat for the Liberals with an increased majority. When the Liberal Party won the 1906 election with a landslide, he was again returned at Whitechapel. The Liberal Party faced the elections in 1910 against a resurgent Conservative Party. Despite this challenge, Samuel was re-elected with an increased majority, at both 1910 elections. Over the course of four general election campaigns in Whitechapel, Samuel had increased the Liberal share of the vote each time, taking it from 50.4% to 59.2%, changing the constituency from a marginal to a safe seat. In 1912 he was created Sir Stuart Samuel, Baronet of Chelwood Vetchery. In April 1913 he undertook a contract for the Government, which required him to resign his seat and face re-election at a by-election. His Conservative opponent from 1910 ran against him in the by-election. He was re- elected with a reduced majority. Samuel retired from politics in 1916. ==References== == External links == * * Parliamentary Archives, Papers of Sir Stuart Montagu Samuel MP, 1st baronet 1856-1926 Category:1856 births Category:1926 deaths Stuart Category:Jewish British politicians Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1900\u20131906 Category:UK MPs 1906\u20131910 Category:UK MPs 1910 Category:UK MPs 1910\u20131918 Category:Members of London County Council Category:Politics of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets Category:People educated at University College School Category:Politicians from Liverpool Category:Progressive Party (London) politicians Category:Presidents of the Board of Deputies of British Jews Category:English justices of the peace ",
