    "text": " Frederick Morgan \"Fred\" Hansen (born December 29, 1940) is an American former athlete who competed mainly in the pole vault. A 1963 graduate of Rice University, he competed for the United States in the 1964 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan in the pole vault where he won the gold medal. He held the world record in the Pole Vault for almost 2 years, first set as on June 13, 1964 and then improved to on July 25, 1964 at the USA vs USSR dual meet at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. @1:10 ==1964 Olympics== Going into the 1964 Olympics, the United States had never lost an Olympic pole vault competition. In the final, the last remaining American was Hansen, who at the time was also the world record holder. The field included two other previous world record holders and decathlete C. K. Yang. Hansen cleared 5 meters on his first attempt, but so did three German athletes. Hansen then passed the next height, watching as only Wolfgang Reinhardt was able to clear. Re-entering the competition at 5.10, Hansen failed his first two attempts, but so did Reinhardt. Hansen then sailed over his final attempt, while Reinhart could not. Hansen continued the American streak, which would survive through one more Olympics until the 1972 pole vault controversy, when defending champion Bob Seagren had his pole confiscated at the games and had to compete on an unfamiliar, borrowed pole. ==Other achievements== Besides pole vault Hansen competed in the long jump. He was also an avid golfer and played at the 1980 U.S. Amateur golf championship. He currently is a practicing dentist in Houston, Texas, in the Memorial area of town. He was Inducted into the Texas Track and Field Coaches Hall of Fame, Class of 2016.http://ttfca2.wixsite.com/txtfhalloffame/inductees . wixsite.com ==References== ==External links== * Fred Hansen at Sporting Heroes * Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:American male pole vaulters Category:American Presbyterians Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:World record setters in athletics (track and field) Category:Medalists at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States in track and field Category:Olympic track and field athletes of the United States Category:Rice Owls men's track and field athletes Category:Rice University alumni Category:People from Cuero, Texas Category:Track and field athletes from Texas ",
