Ross Ulbricht attributed his inspiration for creating the online marketplace Silk Road as \"'Alongside Night' and the works of Samuel Edward Konkin III.\" \"Alongside Night\" was released as a feature movie by Stonegait Pictures, Braeburn Entertainment, and Jesulu Productions. and is in theatrical distribution via TUGG.com as well as being for sale on Amazon.com as a streaming video and as a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack.

Also released in 2013 is J. Neil Schulman's Alongside Night\u2014The Graphic Novel, based on Schulman's movie screenplay. The novel received endorsements from Anthony Burgess and Milton Friedman and was entered into the Libertarian Futurist Society's Prometheus Hall of Fame in 1989. ==Plot== The story begins with the United States collapsing economically \u2014 bankers inflating the money supply, the government agents struggling to keep their power. Trading in foreign currency is illegal. Businesses are subject to rationing. As a result, there is a growing black market for everything. It's the world as Samuel Edward Konkin III conceived it prior to a successful agorist revolution. Elliot Vreeland, son of Nobel Laureate Austrian School economist Dr. Martin Vreeland, learns of his father's apparent death, and is rushed home from school. But the death is fake, a plot concocted by his father to escape arrest by the government agents who are detaining \"radicals\" accused of worsening the economic crisis. Elliot is sent by his father to collect some gold coins stored in case the family has to escape. Upon his return home, Elliot finds his family missing. Government agents enter the house searching for Elliot, who manages to escape. Elliot becomes acquainted with the Revolutionary Agorist Cadre, an organization plotting the end of the government agents by means of counter-economics. The cadre is strong and organized, and has its militia. Elliot enlists their help, and meets Lorimer, a girl hiding from the government agents; they develop a relationship. As the government agents weaken, they tighten controls on communication, travel, and trade. This fails to avert economic collapse, causing the private sector \u2014 unions, syndicates, and many unorganized individuals \u2014 to control the old infrastructure. The 2013 graphic novel and 2014 movie update the book's plot with current references and technology. The location changes from New York city to Las Vegas. ==Film== In 2013 J. Neil Schulman completed production on a feature-film of Alongside Night, starring Kevin Sorbo, Jake Busey, Tim Russ, Garrett Wang, Mara Marini, and Gary Graham.
