    "text": "The PWG World Championship is a professional wrestling world championship in the Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG) professional wrestling promotion. It was first introduced in 2003 as the PWG Championship. The championship is generally contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition. == History == The title became known under its current name in February 2006, when PWG had a two-event European Vacation tour stopping in Essen, Germany and Orpington, England. The title has also been defended in Japan in the Dragon Gate promotion, as well as in the United Kingdom in 1PW and again on PWG's European Vacation II tour in Paris, France, Portsmouth, England and Essen, Germany. The title was later defended by Chris Hero in Queensland, Australia on two occasions. == Reigns == The inaugural champion was Frankie Kazarian, who won the championship by defeating Joey Ryan in the finals of a sixteen man tournament on August 30, 2003, at PWG's Bad Ass Mother 3000 \u2013 Stage 2 event. At 538 days, Adam Cole's only reign is the longest in the title's history. Bryan Danielson is the shortest reigning champion in history by vacating it immediately after winning it for the second time. Kevin Steen holds the record for most reigns, with 3. Bandido is the current champion in his first reign, after defeating Jeff Cobb on December 20, 2019 to win the title. Overall, there have been 31 reigns among 24 different wrestlers. == References == == External links == * PWG World Championship reign history Category:Pro Wrestling Guerrilla championships Category:World professional wrestling championships ",
