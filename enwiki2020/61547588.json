Henry Harington was a son of Sir James Harington of Exton, Rutland (died 1592) and Lucy, the daughter of Sir William Sidney of Penshurst, Kent.Ian Grimble, The Harington Family (New York, 1957), p. 143. His estates were at Bagworth and Baltinglass. Harington was in command of troops in 1599 under the Earl of Essex in his military expedition of 1599\u20131600 to Ireland during the Nine Year's War. He was defeated at the Battle of Deputy's Pass near Arklow on 29 May 1599 by the forces of Felim McFiach O'Byrne, with the loss of 250 soldiers. There was a court-martial, and two captains were sentenced to death, and the troops of Captain Loftus were decimated by lot. Harington never had a significant military command again. Later in the same year his cousin Sir John Harington of Kelston wrote to Anthony Standen from Athlone with news of another incident. Henry Harington had met the Irish leader \"Rorie Ogie\" or Rory Og for a parley or negotiation, but was abducted by him for ransom. Harington's friends would not send a ransom but surrounded his house with 100 soldiers. Rory Og wounded Harington 14 times and then escaped through the cordon. The English soldiers were frightened of Rory Og and thought he had compelled them not to touch him by magic.Clare Carroll, Circe's Cup: Cultural Transformations in Early Modern Writing about Ireland (Cork, 2001), pp. 73-4: Ian Grimble, The Harington Family (New York, 1957), p. 130: Thomas Park, Nugae Antique by Sir John Harington, vol. 1 (London, 1804), pp. 267-8: Orlando Furioso in English heroical verse, by Sr Iohn Harington of Bathe Knight (London, 1607), book 12 note. In 1608 he began to build a castle at Carnew. In his will, Harington initially nominated Jonas Quarles, brother of the author Francis Quarles, as his executor, but changed his mind.
