Petreti\u0107 was afraid that many Catholics would convert to Orthodox Christianity because of the privileges Orthodox Serbs received. He worked hard to convert Serbs into Eastern Catholicism and wrote a detailed work about the Serbs. In 1648 the king appointed Sava Stanislavi\u0107 as bishop of the Bishopric of Mar\u010da, as wished by the Slavonian Serbs, although Petreti\u0107 proposed another candidate. In 1650 Petreti\u0107 persuaded Simeon Kordi\u0107, archimandrite of Lepavina, to act against the Serbs. Kordi\u0107 received funds to establish school for education of Serb children as Catholics. In 1651 he wrote a work in which he elaborated how in 1600 many \"Vlachs or Rascians or better to say Serb people\" migrated from Ottoman Empire to the territory of Slavonia and Croatia near the Ottoman border. In 1667 Petreti\u0107 wrote a recommendation for Mijaki\u0107's appointment on the position of bishop of Mar\u010da for the supervision of the Orthodox population (who he referred to as \"Morlachs or Serbs\"). == Bibliography == Petreti\u0107 belongs to most notable early writers in Croatian kajkavian language. In Graz in 1651 Petreti\u0107 wrote a prologue of the Saint Evangelions written by Nikola Kraja\u010di\u0107. In order to make liturgical poems more acceptable for the readers, Petreti\u0107 published them together with three folk poems, with intention to gradually replace folk poems with liturgical ones in the future publications. == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * * == External links == * Website of the Archdiocese of Zagreb, a page about Petar Petreti\u0107 Category:1604 births Category:1667 deaths Category:17th-century Jesuits Category:Anti-Serbian sentiment Category:Bishops of Zagreb Category:Catholicisation Category:Anti-Eastern Orthodoxy in Catholicism Category:Persecution of Serbs Category:History of the Serbs of Croatia ",
