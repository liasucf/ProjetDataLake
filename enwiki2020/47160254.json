    "text": "\"Are You There (with Another Girl)\" is a song written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David for American singer Dionne Warwick. Her version, released as a single on December 1965, eventually reached number 39 on the Billboard charts. It also appears as the 10th track on her album Here I Am (1965). Author Serene Domenic praised the song in the book Burt Bacharach Song by Song, writing of its \"droning strings\", \"strange fret-sliding guitar\", and orchestral crescendos which precede the Beatles' \"A Day in the Life\" (1967). He also speculates that the song influenced Beach Boys composer Brian Wilson for the Pet Sounds track \"Let's Go Away for Awhile\" (1966). ==Personnel== * Dionne Warwick \u2013 lead singer * Myrna Warwick \u2013 \"oom pah pah pity the girl\" backing vocals ==Chart positions== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1966) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|39 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Top Selling Rhythm & Blues Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|35 |} ==Cover versions== ==References== Category:1965 singles Category:1965 songs Category:Songs with lyrics by Hal David Category:Songs with music by Burt Bacharach Category:Dionne Warwick songs Category:Scepter Records singles ",
