    "text": "The Busie Body is a Restoration comedy written by Susanna Centlivre and first performed at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1709. It focuses on the legalities of what constitutes a marriage, and how children might subvert parental power over whom they can marry. The Busie Body was the most popular female authored- play of the eighteenth century, and became a stock piece of most anglophone theatres during the period. The original Drury Lane cast featured Robert Wilks as Sir George Airy, Richard Estcourt as Sir Francis Gripe, John Mills as Charles, William Bullock as Sir Jealous Traffick, George Pack as Marplot, Christopher Bullock as Whisper, Jane Rogers as Isabinda, Letitia Cross as Miranda, Margaret Saunders as Patch and Margaret Mills as Scentwell. The prologue was written by Thomas Baker. == Plot == The main heroine, Miranda, is an orphaned heiress. She loves Sir George Airey, but her father's will specifies that Miranda will lose her inheritance if she marries before twenty- five without obtaining the written permission of her guardian, Sir Francis Gripe. Sir Francis plans to marry Miranda himself and gain permanent control of her fortune. Miranda verbally promises to marry Sir Francis, but when he gives her the necessary written permission, she tricks him into not putting down the name of the partner. Miranda and Sir George are then free to marry without losing her fortune. A subplot deals with Isabinda, the daughter of Sir Jealous Traffick. Sir Jealous plans to marry her to Seignior Diego Babinetto, but Isabinda is in love with Charles (the son of Sir Francis). Charles disguises himself as Diego, and the oblivious Sir Jealous allows him and Isabinda to marry. Marplot, the well-meaning but foolish busy-body of the title, meddles in these romantic affairs with humorous results. The play ends with a dance, where Sir Jealous concludes: > \"By my Example let all Parents move, And never strive to cross their > Childrens Love; But still submit that Care to Providence above.\" == Reception == The play was very popular with audiences: there were 475 recorded performances during the eighteenth century, and in reality the number was probably far higher. William Hazlitt said that The Busie Body had been played \"a thousand times in town and country, giving delight to the old, the young, and the middle aged\". Centlivre wrote a sequel featuring the character Marplot: Marplot, or the Second Part of the Busie Body (1710). The Busie Body was revived at the Southwark Playhouse in 2012 (called \"The Busy Body\"). == References == ==Bibliography== * Burling, William J.
