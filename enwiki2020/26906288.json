    "text": "Round Trip is the third studio album by power pop/new wave band The Knack that was released by Capitol Records in 1981. It received generally unfavorable critical reviews, but it reached #93 in the Billboard 200 and also contained single \"Pay The Devil (Ooo, Baby, Ooo)\" (hitting #67 on the Billboard Hot 100). \"Boys Go Crazy\" was issued as the single from the album in Australia. It was also issued as a follow up single to \"Pay the Devil\" in the U.S. and was expected to be \"chart bound\" on the Hot 100, but it did not chart. The band broke up a few months after its release, with their label dropping them due to failed expectations. They remained disbanded until a 1986 reunion. ==Overview and reviews== Round Trip was their third album, and it was produced by Jack Douglas. The album was generally critically panned at the time of its release, however, some critics have subsequently been more positive. Steve \"Spaz\" Schnee of Allmusic called it \"brilliant\" and stated that it was better than the previous two albums. Darren Robbins of the pop culture review website The Zeitgeisty Report has called the album a \"masterpiece\" and \"possibly the most underrated album of all-time\". Critic David Fricke of Rolling Stone gave a generally positive review, commenting: The New York Times was less generous. The Times, while calling the album \"well-crafted\" said that \"with its careful harmonies, psychedelic sound effects and jazzy touches, [the album] tries to conceal the utter fatuity of its songs under studio cosmetics,\" and took the album as proof that The Knack was a \"one-hit wonder.\" The song \"Boys Go Crazy\" was included in the 1992 EMI Music compilation album My Sharona. The songs \"Another Lousy Day in Paradise,\" \"Africa,\" \"Sweet Dreams,\" \"Just Wait and See,\" and \"Pay the Devil (Ooo, Baby, Ooo)\" were incorporated into The Retrospective: The Best of the Knack, which was released by Capitol Records on November 16, 1992. Songs \"Another Lousy Day in Paradise,\" \"Just Wait and See\" and \"Pay the Devil (Ooo, Baby, Ooo)\" were included in Very Best of the Knack, released by Rhino Records on May 19, 1998. \"Boys Go Crazy\" and \"Pay the Devil (Ooo, Baby, Ooo)\" were included in Best of the Knack, released by Collectables Records on August 17, 1999. A live version of \"Art War\" was included on Havin\u2019 a Rave-Up! Live In Los Angeles, 1978, a live album from the Knack's 1978 concerts in Los Angeles prior to the release of \"Get the Knack.\" ==Track listing== Instead of the conventional \"side 1\" and \"side 2\", the sides of the original vinyl issue were labeled as \"there\" and \"back\".
