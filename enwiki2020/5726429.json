Originally titled \"The Line Up\", it was written by Florence V. Cole, class of 1912. The most current version was arranged by Tom Keck, Director of Athletic Bands from 1998 to 2003. It is usually followed by \"UNH Cheer.\" \"New Hampshire Hymn\" is the official fight song, but \"On to Victory\" is recognized due to its more traditional composition. ==See also== * UNH Alma Mater ==External links== * New Hampshire's \"On to Victory\" (With \"UNH Cheer\") via YouTube Category:America East Conference fight songs Category:Colonial Athletic Association fight songs Category:University of New Hampshire Category:American college songs Category:College fight songs in the United States Category:Year of song missing ",
