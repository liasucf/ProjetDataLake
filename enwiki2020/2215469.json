    "text": "In German, a Vorstadt is an area of a city that is outside the Altstadt (city center) but tightly connected to it and densely populated, thus distinguishing itself from a Vorort (suburb). Historically, a Vorstadt (\"suburb\" in German) was a settlement outside the city walls, sometimes dedicated to specific trades. Later, large Vorst\u00e4dte appeared in Gr\u00fcnderzeit era. Places named Vorstadt include Vorstadt (K\u00f6nigsberg) and Oranienburger Vorstadt. Its French equivalent is faubourg, the Dutch equivalent is Voorstad, e.g. Voorstad St. Jacob in Roermond. ==Vienna== In Vienna, the historical Vorst\u00e4dte need to be distinguished from the Vororte. The Vorst\u00e4dte were located outside the city walls, but within the Linienwall, a second ring of fortifications outside the city. The city walls were located in the place of the modern Ringstra\u00dfe, while the Linienwall has been removed to give way for the G\u00fcrtel (both being rings of streets around the central city). The Vorst\u00e4dte therefore correspond to the so-called \"inner districts\" of Vienna (2nd to 9th and 20th districts).
