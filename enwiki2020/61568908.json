    "text": "Anderson Oliveira Silva (born 21 November 1997), is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a forward for the club Famalic\u00e3o in the Primeira Liga. ==Professional career== On 19 July 2017, Anderson signed with Famalic\u00e3o. Anderson made his professional debut with Famalic\u00e3o in a 1-0 LigaPro win over U.D. Oliveirense on 27 August 2017. Anderson scored 9 goals in 30 games as Famalicao finished in second in the LigaPro in 2019, earning promotion to the top flight for their first appearance in 25 years. Anderson began the following season on the bench behind Toni Mart\u00ednez, a summer signing from West Ham United in England. However, he scored on his top flight debut in a victory over Santa Clara on 10 August on the first weekend of the season. Anderson scored 4 goals off the bench as the club started the season undefeated through seven games and top of the table. This included a pair of goals against Belenenses SAD on 28 September to clinch a 3\u20131 victory. Anderson was given his first start in the top flight for the club's next game, a meeting with Porto, who were just a point behind Famalic\u00e3o, on 27 October. Anderson lasted over an hour before being replaced by fit-again Nicol\u00e1s Schiappacasse in a 3\u20130 defeat. He was dropped to the bench for the club's next game four days later, but he scored a goal in their 2\u20131 victory over Gil Vicente. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from S\u00e3o Paulo Category:Brazilian footballers Category:F.C.
