In 1981 she bettered her own existing world records in the 100-meter butterfly (57.93) and 200-meter butterfly (2:05.96). These times would stand as the respective world records for 18 and 19 years, and are considered to be among the greatest sports performances ever.CNNSI.com's 100 Greatest Women Athletes ==Early life== Meagher is the daughter of two-time Notre Dame basketball letterman James L. Meagher. She was a competitive athlete from an early age. At the 1979 Pan American Games in San Juan, Puerto Rico, she set her first world record\u2014at the age of 14\u2014in the 200-meter butterfly. \"When she was a teenager, Mary showed no weaknesses,\" reflected Dennis Pursley, one of her early coaches. \"Every athlete I've ever known had some form of weakness, be it in terms of motivation, technique or physical attributes, but Mary was the exception.\" She graduated from the Sacred Heart Academy high school in Louisville, Kentucky, alongside her sister, future U.S. Representative Anne Northup. ==1980 Boycott and on== Meagher was expected to compete for medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, Russia. However, Meagher, along with the rest of the United States Olympic team, never got her chance due to the American-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics. However, in 1981 Meagher gave one of the most memorable performances in competitive swimming at the U.S. Swimming National Championships held in Brown Deer, Wisconsin in 1981. At the meet, Meagher set world records in both the 200-meter and 100-meter butterfly, the two primary distances at which the butterfly is contested in competitive swimming. The times for both records were considered astonishing, especially the record of 57.93 seconds that Meagher set in the 100-meters\u2014a drop of over a second. Both times would stand as the world records for nearly two decades: American swimmer Jenny Thompson lowered the 100-meter record in 1999, while Susie O'Neill of Australia set the record in the 200-meter a year later. Some have argued that Meagher's records in the butterfly were among the most impressive records ever set in sport, let alone swimming, ranking among such noteworthy records as Bob Beamon's long jump world record in 1968. These two swims led Meagher to being named Female World Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World Magazine, which she again won in 1985. Meagher attended the University of California, Berkeley, where she swam for the California Golden Bears swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and Pacific-10 Conference competition. She received the Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving twice, recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year in 1984\u201385 and again in 1986\u201387.Collegiate Women Sports Awards, Past Honda Sports Award Winners for Swimming & Diving. Retrieved December 3, 2014. In 1987, she also won the Honda Broderick Cup as the nation's top female collegiate athlete. She graduated from the University of California in 1987 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in social sciences. At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, Meagher won gold medals in both the 100-meter and 200-meter butterfly races, along with another gold by swimming the butterfly leg of the women's 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay for the winning U.S. team in the event final. Returning to compete at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, Meagher won a bronze medal in the 200-meter butterfly. By the time she left competitive swimming, Meagher had won 24 U.S. national swimming titles. ==Personal life== Meagher was the 10th of 11 siblings. She married former speed skater Mike Plant. They now live in Peachtree City, Georgia, with their two children, Maddie and Drew. Mike Plant's brother and Meagher's brother-in-law, Tom Plant, was also a speed skater and Olympian. Meagher's older sister Anne Meagher Northup served as a US Congresswoman. In Louisville a swimming complex is named for Meagher, and a street is named in her honor in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. ==See also== * List of multiple Olympic gold medalists at a single Games * List of Olympic medalists in swimming (women) * List of University of California, Berkeley alumni * List of World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming (women) * World record progression 100 metres butterfly * World record progression 200 metres butterfly ==References== ==External links== * Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:American female butterfly swimmers Category:American female freestyle swimmers Category:California Golden Bears women's swimmers Category:World record setters in swimming Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States in swimming Category:Olympic gold medalists for the United States in swimming Category:Olympic swimmers of the United States Category:People from Peachtree City, Georgia Category:Sportspeople from Louisville, Kentucky Category:Sportspeople from the Atlanta metropolitan area Category:Sacred Heart Academy (Louisville) alumni Category:Swimmers at the 1979 Pan American Games Category:Swimmers at the 1983 Pan American Games Category:Swimmers at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Swimmers at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:World Aquatics Championships medalists in swimming Category:Medalists at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for the United States Category:Pan American Games medalists in swimming Category:Universiade medalists in swimming Category:Sportswomen from Kentucky Category:Universiade gold medalists for the United States Category:Universiade silver medalists for the United States Category:Medalists at the 1985 Summer Universiade ",
