    "text": "Riu Ripoll Vall\u00e8s Occidental is a comarca (county) in Catalonia, Spain. Sabadell and Terrassa are the comarcal capitals. Along with Vall\u00e8s Oriental it forms the grand comarca of Vall\u00e8s. == Physical geography == Vall\u00e8s Occidental borders the comarques of Bages (to the north), Vall\u00e8s Oriental (to the north and east), Baix Llobregat (to the west), and Barcelon\u00e8s (to the south). It centers on the Catalan prelittoral depression, limited to the west by the River Llobregat and to the east by the River Caldes. The northern part of the comarca is mountainous. From west to east, it contains part of the Obac range (924m altitude at Castellsapera); the massifs of Sant Lloren\u00e7 de Munt (1095m at La Mola and 1053m at Montcau) and Puig de la Creu (664m); and the Sant Sadurn\u00ed (954m) and Farell cliffs (789m). At the south of the comarca is the Collserola range (512m), which forms part of the Catalan Littoral. Between these various ranges is the valley that gives its name to the comarca. The valley actually composes two separate watersheds, the basins of the Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s. The Llobregat watershed lies to the west of the axis that runs from Obac to Tibidabo (culminating point of the Collserola range), passing through Matadepera, Sant Quirze del Vall\u00e8s, Bellaterra, and Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s. Tributaries of the Llobregat include the Canyamssos, the Rub\u00ed and the Vallvidrera. East of that axis, the watershed of the Bes\u00f2s includes the rivers Ripoll and Caldes, (the latter forming the eastern border of the comarca). === Major natural parks === * Parc Natural de Sant Lloren\u00e7 de Munt i Serra de l'Obac * Parc de Collserola === Hiking trails === Vall\u00e8s Occidental has several notable official hiking trails, known as \"senders de gran recorregut\". * GR-6: Barcelona \u2013 Montserrat (Classic route to Montserrat). * GR-96: Barcelona \u2013 Montserrat (Roman road to Montserrat). * GR-97: Abrera \u2013 Sant Celoni (From the Llobregat to the Tordera). * GR-173: Circumnavigation of Vall\u00e8s Occidental. ==Human and economic geography== Industry is concentrated in the south, coinciding with the flattest land in the comarca. The principal industrial cities are the co-capitals Sabadell and Terrassa, as well as Rub\u00ed and Cerdanyola del Vall\u00e8s. The most important industries are textiles, mechanical engineering, metallurgy, machinery, electrical equipment, construction, chemicals, paper, and the processing of food products. An industrial crisis at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s led to a greater importance for the commercial and service sectors, especially computer-related work. The north remains primarily rural. Many of the residences there now function as second homes. ===Municipalities=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Municipality ! Population(2014) !
