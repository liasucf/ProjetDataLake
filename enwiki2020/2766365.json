    "text": "The Leather Archives & Museum (the LA&M;), located in the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois, United States, was founded by Chuck Renslow and Tony DeBlase in 1991, \u201cas a community archives, library, and museum of Leather, kink, fetish, and BDSM history and culture.\u201d Its mission statement reads, \u201cMaking leather, kink, BDSM, and fetish accessible through research, preservation, education and community engagement.\u201d It is a 501(c)(3) organization. In addition to activities in Chicago, the LA&M; sends \"traveling\" exhibits around the country, and provides email and telephone research assistance. The LA&M; is open to those 18 years old or older due to the adult nature of some of its contents. ==Permanent exhibits== The permanent exhibits at the LA&M; are the Fakir Musafar exhibit, the Dungeon exhibit (which shows some of the museum\u2019s artifacts in an erotic environment), the Leatherbar exhibit, and the A Room of Her Own exhibit (about women\u2019s leather history). In regard to the name of the A Room of Her Own exhibit, curator Alex Warner has written, \u201cAs I began work for the first exhibit installation of the Women\u2019s Leather History Project, I was excited that we were both literally and figuratively making room for Leatherwomen\u2019s history in the LA&M.; It was out of this line of thinking that \u201cA Room of Her Own\u201d emerged, building on Virginia Woolf\u2019s 1929 feminist text [A Room of One's Own] that argues for women\u2019s need for space to think and create.\u201d ==Etienne auditorium== The LA&M; has the Etienne auditorium, which is used for the LA&M; film series, Cinekink, the German Fetisch Film Festival, leather-related contests, demonstrations, community meetings, lectures, and as a place where leather groups and clubs can gather for free. The auditorium has numerous murals done by Dom Orejudos, who used the pseudonym Etienne, the French equivalent of his middle name Stephen. ==Notable items== The LA&M; has the world\u2019s biggest collection of original pieces by Dom Orejudos under the name Etienne, some Touko Valio Laaksonen (who used the pseudonym Tom of Finland) originals, and complete sets of the magazines Drummer (before its relaunch) and Bound & Gagged. It also has one of three original leather pride flags which the flag's creator Tony DeBlase assembled as a prototype, and all of the artwork, notes, and other materials of Bill Schmeling. The LA&M; also has notable writings such as the records of International Mr. Leather, National Leather Association, and the Mineshaft, and the papers of Tony DeBlase. It also has all photos by Kris Studios, a male physique photography studio founded by Chuck Renslow and Dom Orejudos, that took photos for gay magazines they published. The studio was named in part to honor transgender pioneer Christine Jorgensen.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/obituaries/ct-chuck-renslow- obituary-20170630-story.html https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2019/10/remembering- transgender-pioneer-christine-jorgensen/ Renslow later co-founded the LA&M; with Tony DeBlase. ==History== In August 1991, the LA&M; was incorporated in the state of Illinois.
