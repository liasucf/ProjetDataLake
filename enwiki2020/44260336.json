    "text": "The 2017 United States elections were held, in large part, on Tuesday, November 7, 2017. This off-year election featured gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as state legislative elections in both houses of the New Jersey Legislature and in the Virginia House of Delegates (the lower house of the Virginia legislature). Numerous citizen initiatives, mayoral races, and a variety of other local elections also occurred. Special elections were also held for one seat of the U.S. Senate, representing Alabama, and six seats of the U.S. House of Representatives. The Democrats picked up the governorship in New Jersey and the Alabama Senate seat that was up for a special election. The governorship in Virginia and the six House seats that were up for special elections did not change party hands. Analysts such as Harry Enten of FiveThirtyEight and Chris Cillizza of CNN interpreted the 2017 election results overall as demonstrating a move toward the Democratic Party. With the Democrats picking up the Senate seat in Alabama, it reduced the Republicans' majority in the Senate to 51\u201349. The analysts also noted that although none of five House seats held by a Republican switched to the other party in the 2017 special elections, in each race the Democrat received a higher percentage of votes than in recent elections for the same seat. Furthermore, Democrats made large gains in the Virginia House of Delegates, and picked up 42 seats in state legislatures. ==Federal elections== The following special elections were held to replace Senators or Representatives who resigned in the 115th U.S. Congress: ===Senate=== * Alabama Class 2: incumbent Senator Jeff Sessions was confirmed by the Senate to serve as United States Attorney General on February 8, 2017, and subsequently resigned from the Senate. Governor Robert J. Bentley chose Luther Strange, the Attorney General of Alabama, to succeed Sessions, filling the seat until the special election takes place. Although he had the power to schedule an election in 2017, Bentley decided to align it with the 2018 general election. Following Bentley's resignation in April 2017, Governor Kay Ivey decided to reschedule the elections. The primary election took place on August 15 with Doug Jones winning the Democratic nomination. Roy Moore was nominated as the Republican candidate on September 26. Jones won the election on December 12, 2017. ===House of Representatives=== * California's 34th congressional district: Democrat Xavier Becerra resigned to become Attorney General of California. The primary election was held on April 4, 2017. With no candidate receiving 50% of the vote, a runoff between the top two candidates, Democrats Jimmy Gomez and Robert Lee Ahn, was held June 6. Gomez defeated Ahn 60.1% to 39.9% to become the new representative. * Georgia's 6th congressional district: Tom Price resigned February 10, 2017, to become the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services. A special election was held on April 18, 2017. A runoff was held on June 20, 2017, and was won by Republican Karen Handel, although Democrat Jon Ossoff gained 47% of the historically Republican district. * Kansas's 4th congressional district: Republican Mike Pompeo resigned January 23, 2017, to become Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. A special election was held on April 11, 2017, and won by Ron Estes, the Republican Kansas State Treasurer. * Montana's at-large congressional district: Ryan Zinke resigned on March 1, 2017, to become the United States Secretary of the Interior. Republican Greg Gianforte, a businessman and nominee for the previous year's gubernatorial race, defeated Democrat Rob Quist and Libertarian Mark Wicks 49.7% to 44.1% and 5.7%. * South Carolina's 5th congressional district: Mick Mulvaney resigned on February 16, 2017, to become the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. A special election was held on June 20, 2017, and was won by Republican Ralph Norman, defeating Democratic nominee, Archie Parnell. * Utah's 3rd congressional district: Jason Chaffetz resigned on June 30, 2017 for health reasons. Governor Gary Herbert scheduled a special election, the primary was held on August 15 and the general election was held on November 7. Republican John Curtis was elected. ==State and territorial elections== ===Gubernatorial=== Two states held gubernatorial elections in 2017: * New Jersey: two-term Republican Chris Christie was term-limited in 2017. Christie campaigned for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, but withdrew from the race February 10, 2016. Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno, a Republican, faced off against Democrat and former U.S. ambassador to Germany Phil Murphy. Murphy was elected on November 7. * Virginia: one-term Democrat Terry McAuliffe was term-limited in 2017. The election was won by Democratic Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam. ===Legislative=== The two states that held gubernatorial elections also held legislative elections: * New Jersey: New Jersey General Assembly and New Jersey Senate; Democrats added modestly to their majorities in both houses. * Virginia: Virginia House of Delegates; Democrats made large gains, reducing the Republicans' majority to 1 seat. As part of a federal court ruling that invalidated its state legislative districts, the North Carolina General Assembly was ordered to hold special elections in the fall of 2017 with updated district lines. However, the US Supreme Court has put a hold on the 2017 election until it rules on the matter. ====Special elections==== A February 25 special election for the Delaware Senate seat left vacant by Bethany Hall-Long when she became the state's lieutenant governor was won by Democrat Stephanie Hansen. An April 18 special election for the Georgia Senate seat left vacated by Judson Hill when he decided to run for US Congress 6th district seat vacated by Tom Price who was appointed Health and Human Services Secretary. Democratic candidate Christine Triebsch and Republican Candidate Kay Kirkpatrick ran for the vacated Georgia State Senate seat, which was won by Kirkpatrick. There was a special election in the heavily Republican New York Assembly District 9 on May 23, which was won by Democrat Christine Pellegrino 58\u201342. Trump had won the district with 60% of the vote. As of September 13, Democrats have picked up a total of six Republican held seats as a result of special elections. This includes the New York Assembly seat picked up by Christine Pellegrino, two seats in the New Hampshire House of Representatives as well as two more in the Oklahoma House of Representatives, and one seat in the Oklahoma Senate. Republicans picked up a total of one seat, in the Louisiana House of Representatives where Republican John Stefanski won a special election to the seat vacated by Democratic incumbent Jack Montoucet, who resigned to be appointed Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries by Governor John Bel Edwards. On September 26, Democrats flipped two more Republican-held seats. One was the Florida Senate seat formerly held by Frank Artiles, who had resigned after using racial slurs to describe fellow legislators. The seat was won by Annette Taddeo with 51% of the vote. The other was a seat in the New Hampshire House of Representatives, the third seat in that legislative body to change to Democratic control in 2017. On October 24 a special election was held to elect a new State Representative for Strafford 13 in the New Hampshire House of Representatives. Casey Conley, a Democrat, won comfortably. On November 7, several states held special elections. There was a special election to fill the Washington State Senate seat for the Washington's 45th legislative district. Since the State Senate was evenly split going into the election, the contest election determined the partisan balance of power in Washington. Democrat Manka Dhingra won a majority of votes in the first round of the election, but rules required the race to go to a second round regardless. In the second round, with over $9,000,000 spent on the election through campaign contributions and political action committee expenditures, with a small number of votes yet to be counted, Dhingra led by over a 10% margin. Anticipating the Dhingra victory, Democrat Senate Democratic Minority Leader Sharon Nelson described a comprehensive agenda for the 60-day legislative session beginning in January that included voting rights reform and campaign-finance disclosure revision, as well as women's reproductive health, clean energy and firearms safety measures.Manka Dhingra leading Jinyoung Englund in pivotal 45th District Senate race, Seattle Times, Joseph O\u2019Sullivan, November 7, 2017. Retrieved November 8, 2017. Dhingra won the second round. On the same day, Democrats won a fourth seat in the New Hampshire House of Representatives with Democratic Erika Connors winning an election to fill a vacancy for the Hillsborough 15 district caused by the death of Republican Rep. Steve Vaillancourt. Democrats also picked up two seats previously held by Republicans in the Georgia House of Representatives, as well as advancing two candidates to a runoff election for a Georgia State Senate seat formerly held by a Republican. On November 14, Democrat Allison Ikley-Freeman won an Oklahoma Senate special election in the previously Republican-held 37th district by 31 votes. ===Judicial=== Two states held supreme court elections in 2017: * Pennsylvania held elections for three seats--one competitive election and two retention elections. In the Pennsylvania system, a justice must first be elected in a competitive race, and at the end of their term there is an up-or-down election on whether that justice should be retained. ** In the competitive partisan election, Republican Sallie Updyke Mundy defeated Democrat Dwayne Woodruff. ** Republican Chief Justice Thomas G. Saylor was retained for another ten-year term. ** Democratic Justice Debra Todd was retained for another ten-year term. * Wisconsin re-elected Republican-backed Justice Annette Ziegler without opposition to a second ten-year term. ===Puerto Rican status referendum=== A referendum regarding the political status of Puerto Rico was held on June 11. Puerto Rican voters were asked whether they prefer statehood, independence/free association, or maintain the current U.S. territorial status. This was the fifth such plebiscite overall, and the first one since 2012. Because there were almost 500,000 blank ballots in that 2012 referendum, creating confusion as to the voters' true desire, Congress decided to ignore that vote and then subsequently allocated funds for holding this 2017 one. 97% of the voters chose statehood in the referendum, though turnout was only at 23%. ===Constitutional convention of New York=== Under the provisions of the New York Constitution, every twenty years the state is required to place before the voters a proposal to hold a constitutional convention to be held the following year, with any suggested amendments being voted on in the year after that. Therefore, in November 2017 a proposal was placed on the ballot for a 2018 convention, with any amendments to be voted on in 2019. On this vote, over 80% voted against a constitutional convention. ==Mayoral elections== Various elections were held for officeholders in numerous cities, counties, school boards, special districts and others around the country.
