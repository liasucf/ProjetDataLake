Chinese is used in government offices and large corporations. The Bible text in Chinese is in Traditional Chinese, written vertically, rather than in Simplified Chinese, written horizontally. ==Taiwanese== The majority of the Taiwan people speak at home Taiwanese, sometimes called Taiwanese Hokkien or Min Nan Yu () because their ancestors came from the southern part of China's Fujian Province. In 1916, Thomas Barclay finished the New Testament translation into Taiwanese Hokkien, followed by the Old Testament translation using Latin script in 1930. His entire NT/OT Bible, now called Amoy Romanized Bible (), was published in 1933. The copies of this translation was once confiscated by the Taiwan Garrison Command during the martial law era for \"obstructing of the Kuo-yu policy\". In 1996, this Bible was put into the Chinese characters, called Taiwanese Han Character Bible ().\u884c\u904e\u5e7d\u8c37\u7684\u300a\u53f0\u8a9e\u6f22\u5b57\u672c\u8056\u7d93\u300b (\u4e2d\u56fd\u8a9e)\u5df4\u514b\u79ae\u53f0\u8a9e\u6f22\u5b57\u672c\u7e41\u9ad4\u8056\u7d93 The Taiwanese Bible: Barkclay Revised Version Han Character Edition (Traditional Chinese) {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"text-align:center; width:25%;\"|Translation !John John 3:16 |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Taiwanese Bible Romanized Character Edition.Taiwanese Bible Romanized Character Edition |In-\u016bi Si\u014dng-t\u00e8 chiong to\u030dk-si\u207f \u00ea Ki\u00e1\u207f si\u00fa\u207f-s\u00f9 s\u00e8-kan, h\u014d\u0358 k\u00ec\u207f-n\u0101 s\u00ecn I \u00ea l\u00e2ng b\u014de t\u00eem-l\u00fbn, \u014de tit- tio\u030dh \u00e9ng-oa\u030dh; I thi\u00e0\u207f s\u00e8-kan k\u00e0u \u00e1n-ni. |- | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Taiwanese Bible Han Character Edition.Taiwanese Bible Han Character Edition |\u56e0\u70ba\u4e0a\u5e1d\u5c07\u7368\u751f\u7684\u5b50\u8cde\u8cdc\u4e16\u9593\uff0c\u4e92\u898b\u82e5\u4fe1\u4f0a\u7684\u4eba\uff0c[\u52ff\u6703]\u6c88\u6dea\uff0c\u6703\u5f97\u8457\u6c38\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f0a\u75bc\u4e16\u9593\u5230\u6309\u5462\u3002 |- |} The translation of Taiwanese Bible: Today's Taiwanese Version using Latin and Han script is already complete for the New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs, the remaining books of Old Testament are under going translation.The Taiwanese language Bible (Taiwan Bible Society) (in Chinese) ==Hakka== The Hakka people live mainly in Taiwan's northwest areas, such as Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County and Miaoli County.
