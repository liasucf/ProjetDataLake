KDHS feeder schools are Harrow Public School, Kingsville Public School and Jack Miner Public School. ==History== The school opened in 1921 at its present location after a fire destroyed Essex District High School. There were three teachers and about 100 students. In 1953, a new building was erected on the site with additions in 1954, 1963, 1967 and 1972. In 2016 Harrow District High School closed and merged with Kingsville District High School. In June 2016, Kingsville District High School students held a Pride flag raising ceremony to recognize June as LGBT Pride Month. The school was one of the first in the district to raise its pride flag. ==Future== In April 2016, the Ministry of Education announced funding for a $44-million JK-to- Grade 12 school to be located in Kingsville. The new school will consolidate students from Kingsville District High School, Harrow District High School, Kingsville Public School, and Jack Miner Public School, and may be the most expensive school the province has ever built. ==References== Category:High schools in Essex County, Ontario Category:1921 establishments in Ontario ",
