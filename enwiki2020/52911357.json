    "text": "Lutz J\u00e4ncke (* July 16, 1957 in Wuppertal) is a neuropsychologist and a cognitive neuroscientist. == Life == Lutz J\u00e4ncke studied psychology, neurophysiology and neuroscience at the Ruhr University Bochum, at the Brunswick University of Technology and at the University of D\u00fcsseldorf in D\u00fcsseldorf. In 1984, he completed his degree in psychology in D\u00fcsseldorf. In 1995, he received his PhD (Dr. rer. nat.) from the Mathematics and Natural Sciences faculty of the University of D\u00fcsseldorf for his thesis on the importance of audiophonatoric coupling for speech control. In 1995, he habilitated at the same faculty with a paper on \"Anatomical and Functional Hemisphere Asymmetry\". The habilitation thesis was awarded by the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of the University of D\u00fcsseldorf. In 1996, he received a Heisenberg scholarship of the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft). After a research internship at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center of the Harvard Medical School, he worked as a senior researcher at the Research Centre J\u00fclich (Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich). In 1997, he accepted an appointment as a C4-professor (full professor) of Psychology of the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg. Since April 2002 he has been professor of Neuropsychology at the University of Zurich. == Work == J\u00e4ncke's scientific work deals primarily with the functional neuroplasticity of the human brain. He uses imaging methods (functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography) and brain stimulation methods (transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation). So far, Lutz J\u00e4ncke has published more than 400 original papers in scientific journals. His work is listed in the Essential Science Indicator. In addition to the original work, he has published more than 50 book chapters and several books. In 2009, he founded \"The International Normal Aging and Plasticity Imaging Center \u2013 INAPIC\" in collaboration with Mike Martin (gerontopsychologist) at the University of Zurich to study the cognitive and neuroscientific foundations of aging. In 2012, J\u00e4ncke and Martin founded the university research center \"Dynamics of Healthy Aging\" at the University of Zurich. He received the Credit Swiss Teaching Award for best teaching in 2007 from the University of Zurich (renewed in 2010) and the \"Goldene Eule\" from the ETH Zurich. === Papers === *Google Scholar === Books === * Methoden der Bildgebung in der Psychologie und den kognitiven Neurowissenschaften.
