    "text": "S\u00e9amus (James) Fitzgerald (21 August 1896 \u2013 23 July 1972) was an Irish politician.Note: Fitzgerald is incorrectly listed as two separate entries in ElectionsIreland.org. He was elected unopposed as a Sinn F\u00e9in Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) to the 2nd D\u00e1il at the 1921 elections for the Cork East and North East constituency. Fitzgerald was born in Cobh (then known as Queenstown) in 1896. He joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914 and was mobilised in Cork in preparation for the Easter Rising in 1916. When the Rising failed to spread beyond Dublin and some other limited actions, Fitzgerald and many of his Cork comrades was interned in Britain. After the amnesty for prisoners he rejoined what had now become the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Cobh and also became active in the Sinn F\u00e9in party. He was elected a member of the town's first republican Urban District Council (now Cobh Town Council) at the 1919 local elections and was elected chairman at its first meeting. He opposed the Anglo- Irish Treaty and voted against it. He stood as an anti-Treaty Sinn F\u00e9in candidate at the 1922 general election but was not elected. He joined Fianna F\u00e1il in 1926 shortly after its foundation and was to remain a prominent member of the party in the Cork area for the next 50 years until his death. He was elected to the Irish Free State Seanad in 1934 and served until it was abolished in 1936. He stood in several elections for that party in both Cork East and Cork City but was only successful on one occasion when elected to the short-lived 11th D\u00e1il as a Fianna F\u00e1il Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Cork Borough constituency at the 1943 general election. He lost his seat at the 1944 general election. Fitzgerald owned a local business in Cobh and was an active member of the local Chamber of Commerce as well as Cork Harbour Commissioners (now the Port of Cork Company). He held several directorships in local companies. S\u00e9amus Fitzgerald died in 1972. ==References== Category:1896 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Early Sinn F\u00e9in TDs Category:Fianna F\u00e1il TDs Category:Fianna F\u00e1il senators Category:Members of the 2nd D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 11th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 1934 Seanad Category:Politicians from County Cork Category:People from Cobh ",
