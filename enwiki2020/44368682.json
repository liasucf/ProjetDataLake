Together with the rapper Testo he forms the hip-hop duo Zugezogen Maskulin. == Career == Moritz Wilken was born in the city of Meerbusch, North Rhine- Westphalia, in 1988. At the age of four he moved to the town of Zetel in Lower Saxony. After moving to Berlin in 2007, he completed a voluntary social year in a hospital.Januar/Februar-Ausgabe der Juice (2014) \u2013 Seite 31 He then worked as an editor of the 'Polli-Magazins' and in 2010 began an internship at the editorial office of German rap website 'Rap.de' under the direction of journalist Marcus Staiger. It was during this internship that grim104 met fellow hip-hop musician Testo. Later they formed the duo Zugezogen Maskulin together. The band name is an allusion to former hip-hop duo Westberlin Maskulin formed in the late 1990s by the rappers Kool Savas and Taktloss. According to a statement by Testo it was also because the term 'zugezogen' (moved to (Berlin) in contrast to being born there) functioned as an insult in the hip-hop scene. With Kauft nicht bei Zugezogenen! (Do Not Buy From Newcomers!) the duo released their first album in December 2011. This album was offered as a free download. In Autumn 2012 they released a video for their song Rotkohl (Red Cabbage). Videos were later also released for Entartete Kunst (Degenerated Art) and Undercut Tumblrblog. On October 31st 2019, Halloween, grim104 released another solo-EP called \"Das Grauen, das Grauen\". == Discography == ;Albums * 2011: Kauft nicht bei Zugezogenen! (Don't buy from newcomers!)
