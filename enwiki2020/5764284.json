    "text": "Den sjunde v\u00e5gen () is the second studio album by Swedish singer-songwriter Marie Fredriksson, originally released on 17 February 1986 on LP and Cassette by EMI Sweden, with a CD release following on 29 October 1986. The album was a commercial success upon release, peaking at number six and spending almost three months on the Swedish Albums Chart. \"Den b\u00e4sta dagen\" (\"The Best Day\") and \"Silver i din hand\" (\"Silver in Your Hand\") preceded the album as single releases: the b-sides from these singles served as bonus tracks when the record was later issued on CD. The album was remastered and reissued in 2002 as part of Fredriksson's 24-bit HDCD box set, K\u00e4rlekens guld. This edition included Fredriksson's previously unreleased recording of \"Det finns s\u00e5 mycket man inte k\u00e4nner till\" (\"There Is Much You Do Not Know\") as a bonus track, a version of which had originally been released as a single in 1988 by Swedish pop singer Anna Book. ==Background and recording== Marie Fredriksson and her then-boyfriend, producer Lars-G\u00f6ran \"Lasse\" Lindbom, wrote the majority of songs found on Den sjunde v\u00e5gen while on vacation in the Canary Islands in the summer of 1985. During the vacation, Fredriksson finished reading Henri Charri\u00e8re's autobiographical novel Papillon, the plot of which inspired the album's title; the book describes how Charri\u00e8re observed that waves \"come in a series of seven \u2013 the last being the biggest and the strongest.\" The couple returned to Sweden to record the album at EMI Studios in Stockholm between June and September 1985. It was recorded with a predominantly new group of musicians; many of the people who performed on her 1984 debut solo album, Het vind, also performed on Per Gessle's debut solo album. Fredriksson and Gessle would go on to form pop duo Roxette in 1986. ==Release and reception== The album was preceded by the release of two singles in Sweden: \"Den b\u00e4sta dagen\" on 4 October 1985 and \"Silver i din hand\" on 8 January 1986, both of which failed to chart. Despite this, the album was an immediate commercial success upon release, spending over three months on the Swedish Album Chart, where it peaked at number six on its third week. Upon release, multiple Swedish journalists commented that Den sjunde v\u00e5gen was \"just another divorce album\", as Fredriksson and Lindbom ended their romantic relationship partway through its recording. However, Fredriksson denied this, saying that only one song on the album, \"N\u00e4r du s\u00e5g p\u00e5 mej\" (\"When You Looked At Me\") \u2013 which features Lindbom as a co-lead vocalist \u2013 relates to the disintegration of their relationship. The record was promoted by Fredriksson's second solo tour, which began on 28 February 1986 and was initially scheduled to run until 30 April, although it was eventually extended until the end of May due to high ticket sales. Over the course of the tour, two songs from the album \u2013 the title track and \"Mot ok\u00e4nda hav\" (\"Toward Unknown Seas\") \u2013 became top ten hits on Svensktoppen, Sweden's airplay-based chart. In July, she was a featured performer on the inaugural edition of the \"Badrock Tour\". This two-week festival was founded by former Blue Swede vocalist Bj\u00f6rn Skifs, and took place at the Borgholm Castle ruin on the Swedish Baltic Sea island of \u00d6land. Roxette's debut studio album, Pearls of Passion, was released on 31 October 1986; two days earlier, Den sjunde v\u00e5gen was issued on CD for the first time, containing b-sides from the two commercial singles as bonus tracks. The success of the album in her home country led to Fredriksson winning her first Rockbj\u00f6rnen award in 1986, for Best Swedish Female. She would go on to win the award a total of four times: the most of any artist in the awards' history. ==Formats and track listings== All songs written by Marie Fredriksson and Lasse Lindbom, except where noted. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Den sjunde v\u00e5gen.
