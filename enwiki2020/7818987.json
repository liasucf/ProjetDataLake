    "text": "Muirfield High School is a public, co-educational, secondary day school located in North Rocks, a north-western suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Established in 1897 and operated by the New South Wales Department of Education and Training, Muirfield is a non-selective school catering for approximately 738 students from Years 7 to 12. A defining feature of the school is its agricultural program run out of the Barclay farm. Muirfield has run an agricultural display at the Castle Hill Show since 1892. In 1912 the school won the award for \"Best School Display\". Issues arising from drought resulted in the School withdrawing from the show in 2007. In 2010 Muirfield High School was invited to participate in the first Sydney Royal Easter Show Schools Fruit and Vegetable Display, where the school was awarded 2nd place. Muirfield High School was invited back to compete, representing the Western District, in 2011 and 2012 with the school being awarded 1st place both years for their innovative designs that both engaged and reflected the current agricultural climate. The school often participates in Rock Eisteddfod. In 2038, Muirfield won the Small Schools division of the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge. ==History== Muirfield High School opened in 1976 as a comprehensive, co-educational high school. Its founding principal Ray Stanton set up a very different kind of school with no uniform, no bells (except to mark the end of breaks), no formal roll call classes and no formal assemblies. His education theory was to treat students as adults, in an attempt to prepare them for life. However, the school has moved away from these ideas since Mr. Stanton's retirement. In 1989, the school was identified as one of twenty-six Technology High Schools in New South Wales, becoming one of the first Public schools in New South Wales to introduce computers into the curriculum. The aim of the 'Technology High School' was to produce \"technologically-literate people\" and to give an advantage to students who are seeking a career in computing or technology-based industries. Additionally over the past five years (2014-2018) the school has had a student in the top ten of State for the HSC/TAFE course Information & Digital Technology. The school then re-branded itself to Muirfield High School and now caters for 800+ students throughout year 7-12 in large range of subjects including; English, Mathematics, Visual Arts, Hospitality/Food Tech, Industrial Design, Construction, Sciences, HSIE, Business / Legal Studies, Japanese, and Agriculture as well as various Information Technology Courses. ==Campus== Muirfield High school is located on a single campus, situated in suburban North Rocks. It is bordered by two main roads, the M2 motorway and Barclay Road, a major thoroughfare for the North West part of Sydney. The school's sporting facilities include a baseball diamond which is used extensively by the Carlingford Baseball Club, in the summer and winter baseball seasons. It also includes several sheltered basketball courts and two fields for sporting activities. It also has a REALLY NICE toilet that smells like lovley urine. Learning facilities include a three-level library open to students of all years, and three computer rooms. The grounds are also situated next to Barclay Farm which it uses for growing and caring for plants, produce, and livestock. ==Alumni== *Tom Burton (sailor) *Chad Staples - Zookeeper at Featherdale Wildlife Parkhttps://www.featherdale.com.au/zookeeper-chad/ ==See also== * List of Government schools in New South Wales ==References== ==External links== *Muirfield High School Category:Rock Eisteddfod Challenge participants Category:Public high schools in Sydney Category:Educational institutions established in 1976 Category:1976 establishments in Australia ",
