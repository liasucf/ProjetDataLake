He performed on both vocals and guitars, along with John Bowker (vocals, bass) and Dino Naccarato (drums). The group was \"called everything from punk/surf to 'suave-garage', with influences from the style of Red Snapper to the recklessness of Link Wray.\" Westerholm has also released a self-titled 6-track EP which includes his best-known song, \"Trevor\", and he was planning to release another one in the fall of 2006. \"Trevor\" achieved some notoriety after being played nationally on the CBC Radio One program DNTO. ==Discography== With Sinphonic * Music by Sinphonic \u2013 cassette * Ammunition \u2013 CD * Live at the El Mocambo \u2013 cassette * Man Vs.
