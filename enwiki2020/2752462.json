He worked as a clerk in a drug store, studied to become a pharmacist and opened his own drug store. He was a founding member of the Canadian Pharmaceutical Association. He was president of the local Liberal association. When a new city pool, now known as the Champagne Bath, was officially dedicated in May 1924, Watters was supposed to officiate, but died of a heart attack on the way to the ceremony. So, Napol\u00e9on Champagne, then the city comptroller, dedicated the pool a few days later. Champagne assumed the role of mayor for the remainder of the year. ==References== *The Ottawa Citizen: 22 August 1990. pg. B.1 Category:1853 births Category:1924 deaths Category:Mayors of Ottawa ",
