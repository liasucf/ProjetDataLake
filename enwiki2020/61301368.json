It was produced by Konstantin Kersting and recorded at Airlock Studios in Brisbane. It was the last recording to feature bassist and guitarist Ariana Pelser and Elijah Gall respectively, only appearing on the track \"Wisdom Teeth\". ==Background and promotion== Waax's debut single \"Wisdom Teeth\" was released on 23 May 2014. \"Wisdom Teeth\" was submitted to Triple J Unearthed and won on 28 July, earning the band a spot on the Triple J Unearthed BIGSOUND showcase lineup. A music video for \"Wisdom Teeth\" was released on 8 December. Their second single, \"I for an Eye\" was released on 3 June 2015. The music video followed on 16 July. Without any prior announcements, the EP Holy Sick was released on 29 September. The third single, \"Holy Sick\" was released on 4 October. On 16 December a music video for \"Holy Sick\" was released, two days after the EP's commercial release. Waax later performed a five-date Holy Sick EP Tour in December. ==Writing and composition== The single \"I for an Eye\" has frontwoman Maz DeVita \"questioning herself and her place, particularly as a female, in the music industry, followed by the anger at herself for feeling insignificant.\" The title-track \"Holy Sick\" is said to be dissing then-Prime Minister, Tony Abbott and his views on immigration. ==Critical reception== The EP received positive reviews. Jack Doonar from AAA Backstage, praising the grungy hard rock sound, said: \"\"Holy Sick\" is 11 minutes and 14 seconds of pure WAAX. Frontwoman Marie DeVita leads a young band that\u2019s smart enough to known there\u2019s more to rock than just turning it up to eleven.\" The AU Review rated it 8.7/10 and praised DeVita's vocal range saying: \"[DeVita] has an incredibly wide range, going from angry howling to soulful and evocative crooning, sometimes within the same line.\" Carmel Lewis from Blank Gold Coast gave it a positive review, saying: \"Waax and Holy Sick are an absolute pleasure, in a warped way, to see, hear, dance, laugh, cry and tear your teeth out to.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted from SoundCloud. ;Waax * Marie DeVita \u2013 vocals, album artwork * Elijah Gall \u2013 lead guitar (only on track 4) * Chris Antolak \u2013 lead guitar * Ewan Birtwell \u2013 rhythm guitar * Ariana Pelser \u2013 bass (only on track 4) * Tom Griffin \u2013 bass * Tom Bloomfield \u2013 drums ;Production * Konstantin Kersting \u2013 producer, mixing, recording * Scott Horscroft \u2013 mixing, mastering * Dave Neil \u2013 mixing, mastering * Steve Smart \u2013 mastering ==References== Category:2015 debut EPs Category:Waax (band) EPs Category:Song recordings produced by Konstantin Kersting ",
