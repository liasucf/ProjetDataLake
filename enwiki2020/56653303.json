    "text": "Takako Tobise (born 2 June 1974) is a Japanese female former long-distance runner who specialised in marathon running. She had a very short-lived career. At the start of 1997 she set a personal best of 1:09:22 hours for half marathon in Tokyo before claiming the 10,000 metres title at the All Japan Corporate Track and Field Championships. At the Nagoya Women's Marathon, a third place finish in 2:29:37 hours earned her an international call-up for Japan at the 1997 World Championships in Athletics. At the competition in Tokyo the 23-year-old managed to finish fourth on her international debut with a run of 2:32:18 hours.Takako Tobise. Association of Road Racing Statisticians.

Combined with the performances of winner Hiromi Suzuki and tenth-placer Nobuko Fujimura, this performance helped the Japanese women to the title at the 1997 World Marathon Cup.IAAF World Marathon Cup. GBR Athletics. Retrieved 2018-01-28. Following her global performance she returned to the Nagoya Marathon in 1998, but her time of 2:35:26 hours left her out of contention and she did not compete internationally thereafter. ==International competitions== {| |- |rowspan=2|1997 |World Championships |Athens, Greece |4th |Marathon |2:32:18 |- |World Marathon Cup |Athens, Greece |bgcolor=gold|1st |Team |7:38:57 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1974 births Category:Japanese female marathon runners Category:Japanese female long-distance runners Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for Japan ",
