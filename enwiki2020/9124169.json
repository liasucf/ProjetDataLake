    "text": "Mike Brant (born Moshe Michael Brand, , 1 February 1947 \u2013 25 April 1975) was an Israeli singer and songwriter who achieved fame after moving to France. His most successful hit was \"Laisse-moi t'aimer\" (\"Let Me Love You\"). Brant died by suicide at the height of his career by jumping from a window of an apartment in Paris. He was known for his vocal range going from baritone to high tenor and also a very high and powerful falsetto. ==Early life== Mike Brant's Jewish parents were from Poland. His mother, Bronia Rosenberg, originally from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, was a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp. His father, Fishel Brand, from Bi\u0142goraj, had been a resistance fighter during World War II, and was 20 years his wife's senior. His parents married following the war, and they applied to emigrate to Mandatory Palestine, but were initially denied permission. They attempted to reach Israel by sea on an Aliyah Bet ship, and were sent to a British internment camp for illegal Jewish immigrants at Famagusta, Cyprus. Mike was born in Cyprus, on 1 February 1947. In September 1947, the family immigrated to Israel after being included in a quota for Jewish immigration to Palestine, and they arrived in Haifa, settling in a kibbutz in Galilee. Mike Brant did not start speaking until six years of age, and very soon told his family and friends that when he grew up he'd be \"a star... or a tramp!\" At the age of 11 he joined his school choir. ==Musical career== When he was 17, Moshe Brand joined his brother's band, \"The Chocolates\", as lead singer. The band performed at parties and caf\u00e9s in Haifa and Tel Aviv, and moved on to nightclubs in hotels. At age 18, he was not drafted into the Israel Defense Forces for the usual three-year period of service expected of most Israeli Jewish men after having been granted a medical exemption due to having had surgery on his stomach at age 15. He carried on his musical career, and sang in English and French despite knowing only Hebrew. In 1965, he changed his name from Moshe to Mike because it sounded more international. He was discovered by the Israeli impresario Yonatan Karmon, who signed him for a tour around the United States and South Africa that lasted almost a year. In May 1969, Brant performed at the Baccara Club at the Hilton Hotel in Tehran, Iran. A young French singer, Sylvie Vartan, also on the bill, was impressed and urged him to come to Paris. Brant arrived on 9 July 1969. It took ten days to find Vartan but eventually she introduced him to the producer Jean Renard, who had turned Johnny Hallyday into a star. Under Renard's guidance, he changed his surname from Brand to Brant, and recorded his biggest hit, \"Laisse-moi t'aimer\" (\"Let Me Love You\"). The song was a success at the Midem music festival in January 1970. \"Laisse- moi t'aimer\" sold 50,000 copies in two weeks. ===Success=== Brant represented France in a radio contest broadcast all over Europe and in Israel. His song, sponsored by Radio Luxembourg, was \"Mais dans la lumi\u00e8re\" (\"But in the Light\"). He won. He continued to release hits: \"Qui saura\" (\"Who Knows\"), \"L'amour c'est \u00e7a, l'amour c'est toi\" (written by Paul Korda/Robert Talar), \"C\u2019est ma pri\u00e8re\" (\"That's My Prayer\"), \"Un grand bonheur\" (\"A Great Joy\") and \"Parce que je t'aime plus que moi\" (\"Because I Love You More Than Myself\"). His first album, \"Disque d'Or\" (\"Gold Record\") sold millions. Brant took a song written and composed by his friend Mike Tchaban/Tashban \"Why do I love you? Why do I need you?\" but French radio stations would not air it because it was in English. Brant returned to Israel soon afterward. In February 1971, Brant was injured in a road accident. Although he suffered minor injuries, it received media attention. That year, he gave concerts in Israel, and performed a new song Erev Tov (Good Evening), written together with Nachum Heiman and some collaboration with Moshe/Michael Tchaban's melodic subject of some musical composition. During his concert tour in Israel, he was accompanied by Israeli singer Yaffa Yarkoni. During the Yom Kippur War in 1973, he performed in Israel for front-line soldiers. ==Suicide attempts and death== By 1973, he was giving 250 concerts a year, some attended by 6,000\u201310,000 people. This went on for two years. He suffered from depression and loneliness, and from the Second Generation Syndrome (family history of the Holocaust), and would alternate, sometimes enjoying life and at other times slipping back into depression.RFI Musique \u2013 \u2013 Mike Brant On 22 November 1974, he attempted suicide, jumping out the window of his manager's hotel room in Geneva. He suffered fractures but survived. He cut the number of performances and concentrated on another album, Dis-lui (\"Tell Her\", French version of \"Feeling\"). In January 1975, he released two singles, \"Qui pourra lui dire\" and \"Elle a gard\u00e9 ses yeux d'enfants\" (written by Richard Seff and Michel Jourdan). On 25 April 1975, the day his new album was released, Brant leapt to his death from an apartment located at 6 Rue Erlanger in Paris. He was 28. Mike Brant was buried in Haifa.Mike Brant's memorial in Haifa (YNet news website, Hebrew) ==In popular culture== Mike Brant has been sampled by rapper Havoc of the group Mobb Deep, for his track \"Live It Up\". It was sampled also by RZA of Wu-Tang Clan. Rapper Eminem sampled Brant's song \"Mais dans la lumi\u00e8re\" (\"But in the Light\") in his track \"Crack a Bottle\" released by him, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent. Comedian Dany Boon lampooned Mike Brant in his show Wa\u00efka by singing his song \"Laisse moi t'aimer\" suspended by a rope. ===Reportage and documentaries=== *In April 1998, a documentary was released Laisse-moi t'aimer: Dmaot Shel Malachim (Tears of Angels). It was a French-Israeli co- production *Another documentary, Mike Brant: Laisse-moi t'aimer was prepared by Erez Laufer in 2003 *Journalist Jean Pierre Ray made a critical exposure reportage about the affair titled \"La nuit des deux couteaux\". It was broadcast on French television TF1 on 4 May 2004 thirty years after Brant's death based on the supposed findings of the criminal squad of the SRPJ () of Marseille. This prompted Jean-Michel Jacquemin and Fabien Baron mentioned critically in the reportage to launch a defamation lawsuit against Ray and TF1 at the Chambre de la Presse at the \"Tribunal de grande instance de Paris\" winning the case by a court judgement rendered on 16 November 2005. *In 2006, journalist Charles Villeneuve prepared another reportage about the case in the programme Le droit de savoir: Faits divers shedding more light on the affair based on interviews with his relatives in Israel, many close to him or his entourage in France. *In 2008, yet another documentary was released on him Un jour, un destin : Mike Brant, l'ic\u00f4ne bris\u00e9e. It was presented by Laurent Delahousse and broadcast on France 2. ===Books and biographies about Mike Brant=== (by chronological order) ;Books about Mike Brant * Hubert and Georges Baumman, La Vraie Vie de Mike Brant, preface by Claude Fran\u00e7ois, \u00e9ditions Star System, Paris, 1975 (The Baummans were part of Mike Brant's team) ; * Fabienne Roche, Mike Brant: Le Prix de la gloire, \u00e9d.
