    "text": "Galaktoboureko () is a Greek dessert of semolina custard baked in filo. The name means \"milk burek\". It may be made in a pan, with filo layered on top and underneath and cut into square portions, or rolled into individual servings (often approximately long). It is served or coated with a clear, sweet syrup. The custard may be flavored with lemon, orange, or rose. Unlike mille-feuille, which it otherwise resembles, the custard is baked with the pastry, not added afterwards. The Turkish laz b\u00f6re\u011fi is similar, but is made with a type of pudding called muhallebi instead of semolina custard. It is popular in Rize and Artvin provinces in the Black Sea Region, home of many Laz people. The Turkish \u015f\u00f6biyet is made with semolina custard but is folded in small triangle shapes instead of squares.A King's Confectioner in the Orient: Friedrich Unger, Court Confectioner to King Otto I, 1837 ==See also== * Bougatsa * Baklava ==References== ==External links== *Recipe for Galaktoboureko on Wikibooks Category:Custard desserts Category:Cypriot cuisine Category:Greek pastries Category:Turkish pastries ",
