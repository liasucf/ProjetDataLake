    "text": "Terina Lily Te Tamaki (born 1 May 1997) is a New Zealand rugby union player. ==Family and private life== Te Tamaki was born in 1997. Sevens player Isaac Te Tamaki is her elder brother. Teresa Te Tamaki is her cousin. Of M\u0101ori descent, Te Tamaki affiliates to the Te Arawa, Waikato and Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto iwi. She received her education at Hamilton Girls' High School. ==Rugby career== Te Tamaki used to watch her elder brother play rugby for Hamilton Boys' High School and thought the sport was not for her, as it was too scary and had too much contact. But the Girls' High coach, former Black Fern Crystal Kaua, convinced her to start the sport. It became her dream to make it to the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. She was contracted to the New Zealand women's sevens team in January 2016 and made her debut at the USA Women's Sevens. Te Tamaki was selected for New Zealand's women's sevens team to the 2016 Summer Olympics. She won a silver medal with the team and broke a New Zealand record held since the 1952 Summer Olympics by becoming the country's youngest female medallist. However, she only held the honour for 18 months until the record broken again by 16-year-old Zoi Sadowski-Synnott at the 2018 Winter Olympics. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1997 births Category:Rugby sevens players at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic rugby sevens players of New Zealand Category:New Zealand female rugby union players Category:New Zealand international rugby union players Category:New Zealand female rugby sevens players Category:New Zealand international rugby sevens players Category:New Zealand M\u0101ori rugby union players Category:Living people Category:Rugby union hookers Category:Te Arawa Category:Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto Category:Waikato Tainui Category:Olympic silver medalists for New Zealand Category:Olympic medalists in rugby sevens Category:Medalists at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:People educated at Hamilton Girls' High School ",
