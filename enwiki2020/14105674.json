    "text": "The 2007\u201308 Cypriot Cup was the 66th edition of the Cypriot Cup. A total of 54 clubs entered the competition. It began on 8 September 2007 with the first round and concluded on 17 May 2008 with the final which was held at GSP Stadium. APOEL won their 19th Cypriot Cup trophy after beating Anorthosis 2\u20130 in the final. ==Format== In the 2007\u201308 Cypriot Cup, participated all the teams of the Cypriot First Division, the Cypriot Second Division, the Cypriot Third Division and 12 of the 14 teams of the Cypriot Fourth Division. The competition consisted of seven rounds. In the first and in the second round each tie was played as a single leg and was held at the home ground of the one of the two teams, according to the draw results. Each tie winner was qualifying to the next round. If a match was drawn, extra time was following. If extra time was drawn, there was a replay at the ground of the team who were away for the first game. If the rematch was also drawn, then extra time was following and if the match remained drawn after extra time the winner was decided by penalty shoot-out. The third and fourth round were played in a two- legged format, each team playing a home and an away match against their opponent. The team which scored more goals on aggregate, was qualifying to the next round. If the two teams scored the same number of goals on aggregate, then the team which scored more goals away from home was advancing to the next round. If both teams had scored the same number of home and away goals, then extra time was following after the end of the second leg match. If during the extra thirty minutes both teams had managed to score, but they had scored the same number of goals, then the team who scored the away goals was advancing to the next round (i.e. the team which was playing away). If there weren't scored any goals during extra time, the qualifying team was determined by penalty shoot-out. In the next round (quarter-finals), the teams were drawn into two groups of four. The teams of each group played against each other twice, once at their home and once away. The group winners and runners-up of each group advanced to the semi-finals. The semi-finals were played over two legs and the same format as in the third and fourth round was applied. The final was a single match.
