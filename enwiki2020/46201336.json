He often went to Germany to buy plants and botanical gardens, and visited the national garden shows. He also smuggled, hidden in a hollowed-out book, seeds in the United States, since the selection of ornamental plants here was initially very limited. Even relatives in Germany sent him seeds.Stefan Leppert: Ornamental Grasses. Wolfgang Oehme and the New American Garden. Francis Lincoln, London 2009, P. 32.
