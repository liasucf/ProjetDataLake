The latter was formed to handle the functions of the former municipalities of Macau and their councils and assemblies that were abolished on 1 January 2002, slightly more than two years after Macau became a special administrative region (SAR) of the People's Republic of China. The body is under the Secretariat for Administration and Justice of the Macau government. == History == Following the transfer of sovereignty over Macau from Portugal to China in 1999, the Portuguese administrative divisions of municipalities (concelhos) and parishes (freguesias) in Macau were kept provisionally in place: the provisional municipal council of Macau, the provisional municipal council of Ilhas, and the provisional municipal assemblies of each municipality.Law 1/1999, Article 15 On 31 December 2001, all the provisional organs were dissolved and the new Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau (' [IACM], ) took on the roles of the provisional municipal councils, starting from 1 January 2002, under the Secretariat for Administration and Justice of the Macau government.Administrative Regulation 32/2001 The IACM was given a logo based on the Chinese Han character , for \"civilian\". In 2018, the Macau legislative assembly passed Law No. 9/2018 which abolished the IACM and created the Municipal Affairs Bureau in its place. All the functions of the former were transferred to the new bureau and a new 25-member municipal affairs advisory council was established. This came into effect on 1 January 2019. == See also == * Parishes of Macau * Leal Senado Building == References == ==External links== * Municipal Affairs Bureau *Civic Bureau *Civic Bureau Macau, Civic Bureau Civic Bureau Macau, Civic Bureau Category:Macau-related lists Category:Government departments and agencies of Macau ",
