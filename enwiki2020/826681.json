Due to the Faroe Islands' status as a self-governing territory, the airport is not subject to the rules of the European Union. It is the main operating base for Faroese national airline Atlantic Airways and, for a brief period during 2006, was also the base for the low-cost airline FaroeJet. ==History== Faroe Airways Douglas DC-3 Map of the airport ===Early years=== The airport was built by British Royal Engineers during World War II on the island of V\u00e1gar. The site was chosen mainly because it was hard to see from the surrounding waters and any potential German warship. The first aeroplane landed here in Autumn 1942. (See British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II). British engineers had similarly first built Reykjav\u00edk Airport in Iceland in 1940, then known as RAF Reykjavik, following the British Occupation of Iceland. After the war, V\u00e1gar airfield was abandoned and left unused until 1963 when it was reopened as a civilian airport at the initiative of two S\u00f8rv\u00e1gur residents, Hugo Fj\u00f8r\u00f0oy and Lars Larsen. The two worked with the Icelandic airline Icelandair, which began the scheduled flights to Bergen, Copenhagen and Glasgow using a Douglas DC-3 aircraft. In 1964 a separate airline, Faroe Airways, operated flights, first using chartered aircraft but in 1965 they bought a DC-3 from the Swedish airline Linjeflyg. The company ceased operating on 28 September 1967. In 1971, Icelandair was operating Boeing 727-100 jetliners into the airport with weekly nonstop service to Glasgow and Reykjavik.http://www.timetableimages.com, April 1, 1971 Icelandair system timetable In 1988, Atlantic Airways was flying British Aerospace BAe 146-200 jet service nonstop to Copenhagen.http://www.timetableimages.com, May 30, 1988 Atlantic Airways system timetable Until 2004 Maersk Air also operated flights into the airport.

A new terminal opened on 17 June 2014 with increased passenger capacity. The runway was extended from to in 2011, allowing a greater variety of aircraft types to be used, and further-away destinations to be introduced. Construction work started in May 2010, and on 3 December 2011, the extended runway was opened and put into use for the first time.Celebrating the extended runway Previously, jet aircraft with short airfield performance such as the British Aerospace BAe 146 (which ceased to be produced 2001) were preferred for use into the airport (although Maersk Air operated flights with Boeing 737-500 aircraft), and then the most distant destination was Copenhagen, . The Airbus A319 of Atlantic Airways is able to utilise the extended runway, and services with this type with Atlantic Airways began in March 2012.Atlantic Airways A319 enters service , 28 March. 2012 Tourist summer flights to Barcelona and Milan were introduced.
