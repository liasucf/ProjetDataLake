    "text": "If You Miss 'Im...I Got 'Im is an album by blues musician John Lee Hooker with his cousin Earl Hooker released by the BluesWay label in 1970. ==Reception== The AllMusic review stated: \"This album is marked by the interaction between John Lee Hooker and his guitar-playing cousin Earl. Earl, who succumbed to illness in 1970, was a fine bluesman in his own right, possessing a formidable slide technique. Many are unaware that the two often performed together, and the band that accompanies John Lee here also backed Earl frequently... Heard here less than a year before his death, Earl still sounds frisky and versatile, often utilizing a funky wah-wah style without ever descending into the psychedelic excesses that plagued so many late-'60s electric blues albums... On If You Miss 'Im, John Lee definitely benefits from keeping it in the family\". ==Track listing== All compositions credited to John Lee Hooker # \"The Hookers (If You Miss 'Im...I Got 'Im)\" \u2013 4:41 # \"Baby, I Love You\" \u2013 4:08 # \"Lonesome Mood\" \u2013 5:11 # \"Bang Bang Bang Bang\" \u2013 4:45 # \"If You Take Care of Me, I'll Take Care of You\" \u2013 3:33 # \"Baby, Be Strong\" \u2013 5:03 # \"I Wanna Be Your Puppy, Baby\" \u2013 8:06 # \"I Don't Care When You Go\" \u2013 2:34 # \"Have Mercy on My Soul!\" \u2013 7:54 ==Personnel== *John Lee Hooker \u2013 guitar, vocals *Earl Hooker \u2013 guitar *Paul Asbell \u2013 guitar (tracks 4 & 9) *Jeffrey Carp \u2013 harmonica *Johnny \"Big Moose\" Walker \u2013 piano, organ *Chester \"Gino\" Skaggs \u2013 bass *Roosevelt Shaw \u2013 drums ==References== Category:John Lee Hooker albums Category:Earl Hooker albums Category:1970 albums Category:BluesWay Records albums ",
