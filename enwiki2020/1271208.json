The station is owned by the Groupe TVA subsidiary of Quebecor Media. CFTM-DT's studios are located on Boulevard de Maisonneuve East and Rue Alexandre de S\u00e8ve in the Ville-Marie borough of Montreal, and its transmitter is located on Voie Camillien Houde (near Mount Royal). On cable, the station is available on Vid\u00e9otron Illico digital cable channel 4 in standard definition and channel 604 in high definition in the Montreal area; Vid\u00e9otron also offers a three- hour delayed feed to Illico subscribers on channel 401. ==History== CFTM-TV's third logo used from 1969 until 1978, as \"CFTM 10\". It opened on February 19, 1961, a few weeks after CFCF-TV went on the air for the first time. It was owned by Joseph Alexandre de S\u00e8ve and his company, T\u00e9l\u00e9-M\u00e9tropole. At first it relied primarily on kinescopes from RTL, and also from T\u00e9l\u00e9 Monte Carlo, but it wasn't long before it settled into a more peculiar and local form. On April 14, 1963, CFTM started sharing programs with CJPM-TV in Chicoutimi (now Saguenay) in the Saguenay\u2013Lac-Saint-Jean region on the day the latter station signed on. They were joined by CFCM-TV in Quebec City in 1964. This was the informal beginning of TVA, though the network wasn't officially established until September 12, 1971. When de S\u00e8ve died in 1968, the city government renamed the street in front of CFTM's studios rue Alexandre de S\u00e8ve in his honour. CFTM has always been by far the largest station in the TVA network. As such, it dominated the network long before T\u00e9l\u00e9-M\u00e9tropole bought majority control of TVA in 1990. At one point, CFTM produced as much as 90 percent of TVA's programming. Even today, TVA's network feed is little more than a retransmission of CFTM. Whenever CFTM has to interrupt its programming for breaking news or weather alerts in Montreal, the entire network usually gets interrupted as well. CFTM-TV was essentially available on satellite beginning November 1, 1981 as TCTV, carried via Cancom by cable television operators across Canada, though not in most major cities. TCTV carried mainly the same programs as CFTM, but with some local news and programming from other TVA affiliates. The TCTV service ended when the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved TVA for a national network license in 1998. Since May 1, 1999, all Canadian cable companies have been required to carry a TVA station. CFTM is the affiliate carried in most markets outside of Quebec \u2014 excepting some markets in Northern Ontario, Eastern Ontario and New Brunswick, which have long carried the stations in adjacent markets. The station also provides a time-shifted feed for cable companies in western Canada, delayed three hours after the original broadcast, matching up with Pacific Time. == Digital television and high definition== CFTM received CRTC approval in March 2006 for its request to broadcast digitally on UHF channel 59Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2006\u201378, 15 March 2006, re: TVA Group Inc, Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec and was granted a requested extension to August 31, 2009 to launch this service but the launch never occurred.Broadcasting Public Notice 2008-0050-0 17 March 2008, approval of extension to 31 August 2009 to commence operation of transitional digital television at CFTM-TV Montr\u00e9al On July 6, 2009, as part of a license renewal hearing, TVA was granted a second extension in which to launch CFTM-DT. During the analogue television shutdown and digital conversion, which took place on August 31, 2011, CFTM silenced its analogue transmitter on September 1, 2011 at 12:01 am during a movie's airing and began broadcasting a digital signal a few minutes later on its old analog channel number, 10. == References == ==External links== * * * CFTM at TV Hat * * FTM-DT FTM-DT Category:Television channels and stations established in 1961 Category:National Hockey League over-the-air television broadcasters Category:Montreal Canadiens broadcasters Category:1961 establishments in Quebec ",
