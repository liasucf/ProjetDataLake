It was a development of the Aviatik B.I and B.II models, being one of first aircraft of the new German C class of armed biplanes. In the C.I the observer sat in front of the pilot, with a machine- gun clipped on a sliding mounting fitted on a rail at either side of the cockpit.Gray, Thetford (1970), p. 59-63 It gave the crew the means to attack enemy aircraft.van Wyngarden, G. Early German Aces, p.6 The positions of the pilot and observer were reversed in last series of 50, ordered in 1917 solely for trainer purpose.Grosz, Peter M. Aviatik C.I. Berkhamsted: Albatros Productions, 1997, Windsock Datafile no.63. . p.5-6 There was only one aircraft built of refined C.Ia version in May 1916, with armament still in a forward cab, serving as a prototype for C.III. Later models of the plane included the Aviatik C.II and the C.III, which had more powerful engines. The C.III was produced in large numbers. 548 Aviatik C.I were built in total: 402 by Aviatik (including 51 trainers and 1 C.Ia) and 146 by Hannover.Grosz, Peter M. Aviatik C.I.
