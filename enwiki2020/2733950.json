    "text": ":Spegazzinia is also a synonym of the cactus genus Rebutia. Spegazzinia is a genus of mitosporic Ascomycota. The widely distributed genus contains seven species. This genus is somewhat related to other lobed or ornamented genera such as Candelabrum. No information is available regarding health effects or toxicity. Allergenicity has not been studied. Spegazzinia is usually identified on spore trap samples where it is seen every few weeks (spores have very distinctive morphology). It may also be found in air by culturable (Andersen) samples if a long enough incubation period is provided so that sporulation occurs. Laboratories have never found this organism growing on indoor environmental surfaces. Natural habitat includes soil and many kinds of trees and plants.https://www.emlab.com/app/fungi/Fungi.po?event=fungi&type;=secondary&species;=113&name;=Spegazzinia ==References== Category:Ascomycota incertae sedis ",
