    "text": "The Spook's Apprentice (American title: The Last Apprentice: Revenge of the Witch), written by Joseph Delaney, is the first story in The Wardstone Chronicles arc of the Spook's series. The plot centres on a 13-year-old farm boy named Tom who lives in the countryside of The county, loosely based on the English county of Lancashire, where the author residesBBC with his large family. As Tom is the seventh son of a seventh son he is able to see things others cannot, such as boggarts, ghasts, ghosts and others. ==Plot== Tom Ward has lived his whole life in the county (loosely based on the English county of Lancashire). Because he is the seventh son of a seventh son and thus has the ability to see ghosts and fight other supernatural beings, his parents have apprenticed him to the Spook, a cloaked man named John Gregory. The Spook travels the County fighting troublesome creatures such as boggarts, ghosts, ghasts and witches for the people who need these things gone. Tom will have to learn how the Spook fights \"The Dark\", so that he may one day become a Spook as well. The Spook tells Tom that most of his other apprentices have failed due to them being cowardly, disobedient, or deceased. It is revealed that one of the deceased was Billy Bradley, who had his finger bitten off and died from loss of blood while fighting a particularly dangerous boggart . Tom goes to live in the Spook's house in Chipenden. This house is protected from unwanted visitors by a boggart, with whom the Spook has made a contract which states that as long as the house is standing, the boggart must guard it (as well as cook and clean for the Spook and his apprentices). Tom is sent out on an errand to pick up some food for the house. He is given a strict warning by the Spook: Do not talk to women wearing pointy shoes. On his way home, some boys about the same age as Tom threaten to beat him unless he gives them some food. Tom refuses and the boys are about to beat him when suddenly a girl in pointy shoes shows up and scares them away by telling them a certain person is back. The mysterious girl's name is Alice, and she is a relative of some of the most dangerous witches in the county: Mother Malkin and Bony Lizzie. == Characters == * Thomas Ward, apprentice to John Gregory and the seventh son of the seventh son. * John Gregory, the Spook for the County who mentors Thomas.

Whilst most of the characters remain, their story has been much changed and expanded (presumably to better suit an older audience & the film's more 'epic' stature.) \u2013 It stars Ben Barnes, Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore. Kit Harington and Alicia Vikander were cast as Tom Ward and Alice but in June 2011 Variety revealed that Ben Barnes was cast as Tom Ward. ==Drama script== In 2014, Stephen Delaney, Joseph Delaney's son, adapted The Spook's Apprentice into a 160-page play script; it is published under the title The Spook's Apprentice - Play Edition. ==Other books in The Wardstone Chronicles== === Related books === * The Spook's Tale / Interception Point - This short story was combined with Mark Walden's Interception Point as part of a small (128 pages) special publication for World Book Day UK 2009 which could be purchased at that event for a \u00a31 coupon.
