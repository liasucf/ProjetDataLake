    "text": "The Kulen Vakuf massacre was perpetrated by Communist-led Yugoslav Partisans and groups of non-communist Serb rebels, and involved the killing of between 1,000 and 3,000 Muslim and members of Usta\u0161e (including 100 Croats) in early September 1941 in Kulen Vakuf, then part of the Independent State of Croatia (present-day Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina) during World War II. The local Usta\u0161e had previously committed massacres of Serbs in Kulen Vakuf and surrounding villages. == Background == Ethnic Serbs were targeted by the genocidal policies of the Usta\u0161e-led Independent State of Croatia, a puppet state of Nazi Germany established after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. The massacres of Serbs committed by the local Usta\u0161e, such as those that took place during July and early August 1941 in villages around Kulen Vakuf, led to reprisals.:\"Organizovani ratni zlo\u010dini kao \u0161to su bili oni u julu i po\u010detkom avgusta 1941. u srpskim selima u okolini K. Vakufa izazivaju stihiju divlje osvete kao \u0161to je bila ona po\u010detkom septembra u K. Vakufu... Such retaliations lasted for short time and were quickly repressed, unlike Usta\u0161e war crimes which were organized from the top of the Croatian government in Zagreb which systematically and persistently pushed and sometimes even forced local Usta\u0161e to commit massacres.:\"....ali je stihijno divljanje osvete kratkotrajno i mo\u017ee se suzbiti. Therefore, the formula to describe this kind of events as conflicts of local Chetniks and Usta\u0161e motivated with mutual ethnic hatred and intolerance can be characterized as an oversimplification. === Usta\u0161e massacres of Serbs === The Kulen Vakuf massacre was committed in retaliation for earlier equally massive Usta\u0161e massacres of local Serbs.:\" ... the site of an Ustasha massacre of Serbs and then of an equally massive retaliation by insurgents against Muslims.\" There are more than 280 identified places where Serbs in Bosnian Krajina were tortured and murdered during the summer of 1941. In case of region of Kulen Vakuf and its surrounding, there is a long list of villages whose Serb population was subjected to mass massacres: Ora\u0161ko Brdo, Prkosi, Veliki Stenjani, Renovac, Kalati, Bu\u0161evi\u0107, Kestenovac, Bosanski Srbci, Malo Seoce, .... In one of earlier massacres around Kulen Vakuf Usta\u0161e slaughtered 862 Serbs during one single day, while 950 Serbs were killed in Kulen Vakuf, with particular participation of Miroslav Matijevi\u0107, a Croat who owned local restaurant. Matijevi\u0107 was one of organizers and main participants in the massacres of Serbs which were initially committed on the hill near church in Kulen Vakuf. Usta\u0161e set on fire an Orthodox church in Kulen Vakuf after they murdered many Serbs in it.:\" \u041a\u0423\u041b\u0415\u041d \u0412\u0410\u041a\u0423\u0424. \u041f\u043e\u0448\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0443 \u0443 \u045a\u043e\u0458 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u043b\u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0432\u0438\u0448\u0435 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430, \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u0441\u0443 \u0446\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043b\u0435.\" The Serb priest of church in Kulen Vakuf was murdered by Usta\u0161e after they first killed his wife and children in June 1941.:\"\u0420\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0459\u0443\u0431 \u0421. \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0440\u045f\u0438\u045b, \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0448\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0438\u0437 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u0435\u043d \u0412\u0430\u043a\u0443\u0444\u0430, \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0430\u043d \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0435, \u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430 1941. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435.\" Usta\u0161e killed all family members of Vukosav, the former priest of Kulen Vakuf church, in front of him, including his two daughters in law and two grandsons. In early August 1941 all Serb civilians from village Kalati were either massacred or imprisoned in Kulen Vakuf, leaving the village depopulated until Kulen Vakuf and imprisoned civilians were liberated on 6 September 1941. By 30 August 1941 Usta\u0161e killed nearly 200 Serb women and children in the village Kalati near Kulen Vakuf. The Kulen Vakuf massacre was committed in early September 1941 in Kulen Vakuf, then Independent State of Croatia (today Bosnia and Herzegovina) by the Communist- led Yugoslav Partisans forces and groups of non-communist Serb rebels. The motive was not only retaliation, but also involved deliberate liquidation of the Muslim community. Some of the Muslim victims were members of Usta\u0161e who had committed the massacres of Serbs, while other were murdered because they were thought to be linked to the Usta\u0161e through their ethnicity.: \"Neki od tih novih \u017ertava bili su usta\u0161e, po\u010dinioci onih prvih zlo\u010dina, dok su mnogi drugi ubijeni zato \u0161to se smatralo da su s njima etni\u010dki povezani.\" === Earlier retaliation massacres === The Kulen Vakuf massacre was preceded by Krnjeu\u0161a massacre when rebels killed on 9 August 1941 as many as 240 Croat civilians.Dizdar, Zdravko \u201e\u010cetni\u010dki zlo\u010dini u Bosni i Hercegovini 1941-1945\", Zagreb 2002. When rebels decided to attack Usta\u0161e stronghold Bori\u010devac, they knew that this village was predominantly populated by Croats who could be targeted by some of the rebels. The rebel commanders were concerned about the fate of the Croat population of Bori\u010devac which was perceived as Usta\u0161e stronghold by rebels furious because of the mass massacres of Serb population of Lika, and were glad that civilians escaped from the village to Kulen Vakuf. The Croat population of Bori\u010devac was informed about the expected attack of rebels by one of their leaders who sent them a letter to alarm them about the planned rebel attack so they could escape and avoid blood feud. After capture of Bori\u010devac the rebels discovered two mass graves of Serb civilians in nearby pit Jasenova\u010da, one big pit full of corpses and the other one half-full of corpses of Serb civilians. Some rebels recognized their relatives or members of their families. Although they were ordered not to raize the village, soon the houses in village were set to fire because the command over the rebels at that moment was not possible. Serb rebels subsequently massacred 179 Croat civilians (mostly those that were elderly and infirm, as well as women and children) in Bori\u010devac. == Capture of Kulen Vakuf == === Forces === The rebel forces were under command of headquarter in Drvar. The Communist forces consisted of the battalion Freedom (, \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0430) commanded by Stevan Pilipovi\u0107 - Ma\u0107uka and \u0110oko Jovani\u0107 and one detachment of communist forces from Lika was commanded by Stojan Mati\u0107 while Gojko Polovina was their political commessair. Several other communist detachments were commanded by Nikola Karanovi\u0107 and Pero \u0110ilas (who later deserted Communist forces and joined Chetniks to fight against Partisans). The communist forces had their headquarter in Doljanski Bubanj.:\"\u010ceta je bila u sastavu II bataljona kojega je komandant bio Stevo Pilipovi\u0107- -Ma\u0107uka, a politi\u010dki komesar \u0110oko Jovani\u0107. Bataljon je imao svoj \u0161tab u Doljanskom Bubnju,....\" The rebel forces also included non-communists who were in some sources also referred to as Chetniks. Their commanders included Mane Rokvi\u0107 who later joined Chetniks and became well known military officer. The Croatian garrison in Kulen Vakuf was commanded by bojovnik Vladimir Veber and consisted of one battalion of Usta\u0161e forces and Home Guard together with numerous members of local militia whose members were recruited among Muslims from villages of \u0106ukovo, Ora\u0161ac and Klis. Veber was notorious in the whole region of Kulen Vakuf because of massacres of Serbs he committed in period between June and September 1941. Veber found himself blocked in Kulen Vakuf after he first tried to reach Srb from Biha\u0107 to fight against the rebels in the Srb uprising and Drvar uprising, but retreated to Kulen Vakuf after being ambushed in village Bori\u010devac and losing 20 of his men.: \"\u0438\u0437 \u0411\u0438\u0445\u0430\u045b\u0430 \u0443 \u0421\u0440\u0431 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0434 \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u045b\u0435\u0432\u0446\u0430 \u0441\u0443 \u0433\u0430 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u0441\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0438. \u0418\u0437\u0433\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043e \u0458\u0435 \u043e\u043a\u043e 20 \u0459\u0443\u0434\u0438 \u0438 \u0441 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0458\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0448\u0430\u043e \u0443 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u0435\u043d \u2014 \u0412\u0430\u043a\u0443\u0444. \" Usta\u0161e managed to gather substantial forces in Bosanski Petrovac, so the rebels first cut the connection between Kulen Vakuf and Bosanski Petrovac, and then attacked village \u0106ukovi and Ora\u0161ac, struggling for every house against Usta\u0161e who eventually had to retreat to Kulen Vakuf. === Capture === The decision to attack Kulen Vakuf was made by communist leaders including Marko Ore\u0161kovi\u0107, Gojko Polovina and Stevan Pilipovi\u0107, when they estimated that rebel forces that encircled the town are strong enough for its capture.:\"\u041f\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0443 \u0441 \u0432\u043e\u0458\u043d\u043e\u0433 \u0441\u0430\u0432\u0458\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u0414\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430, \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0443\u0442\u0443 \u0437\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d-\u0411\u0440\u043e\u0434, \u041c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u043e \u041e\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b, \u0413\u043e\u0458\u043a\u043e \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u041c\u0430\u045b\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e \u0441\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0443 \u0443 \u043e\u0432\u043e\u043c \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0458\u0443. \u0421\u0430\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u043c\u043e \u0441\u0435 \u043e \u043d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0443 \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u0435\u043d-\u0412\u0430\u043a\u0443\u0444. \u041d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434 \u0458\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d \u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u0441\u0443 \u043b\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0438\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435.\" According to the communist plan for capture of Kulen Vakuf, Freedom battalion was to attack Kulen Vakuf from direction of villages Vrto\u010de and Prkosi, while detachment from Lika was ordered to cross river Una when after receiving the agreed signal.:\"Prema rasporedu za napad na Kulen Vakuf, borci Bataljona \u00bbSloboda\u00ab, koji su uni\u0161tili neprijateljski logor u Vrto\u010dama, dobili su zadatak da napadaju od Vrto\u010da i Prkosa. When Veber realized that Kulen Vakuf was surrounded by superior rebel forces he decide to break through the rebel lines along the road toward Prkos and further to Biha\u0107, using civilians refugees from Croat populated villages as living shield in front of his forces. Veber had intention to retreat his forces regardless of the possible civil victims. To disguise their real intentions, Usta\u0161e attacked battalion Freedom late at night on 5 September 1941. When Veber ordered evacuation of the civilians from the town, the Croatian civilians left the town in organized manner. The Muslims were reluctant to leave the town, expecting the surrender of the town's garrison while Muslim traders insisted on evacuation. Then, during the night Usta\u0161e tried to break through rebel lines meeting strong resistance when they reached village Prkosi. The captured civilians were brought back to Kulen Vakuf with the intention to transport them to Biha\u0107, against the order of Stojan Mati\u0107. That has not happened because Mati\u0107 was informed about Usta\u0161e attack on Drenova\u010da toward Lapac, so he handed over imprisoned civilians to towns guard and headed toward Lapac with his forces. == Massacre == The first massacres were committed when some of the rebel got drunk and targeted imprisoned Usta\u0161e. Later, when rebels who entered Kulen Vakuf organized exhumation of mass graves they found in the town, they discovered that besides 1,000 Serbs killed by Usta\u0161e little earlier that year in surrounding villages Usta\u0161e killed another 1,000 Serbs in Kulen Vakuf just several days earlier. This incited massive histeria among rebels who blamed all Muslims for Usta\u0161e massacres of Serbs, and they killed more than 1,000 Muslims (or about 2,000 per some sources), including women and children.:\"\u041d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0443 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434, \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0443 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 \u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0442\u0435 \u0437\u043b\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0442\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u0435 \u041c\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0435. ... \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0430\u043c\u0435\u045b\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438, \u043c\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0443 \u0445\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0443....\" Some communist officers did whatever they could to protect imprisoned civilians, but they only managed to save small number of them. The number of massacred Muslims is estimated between over 1,000:\"The town of Kulen- Vakuf was the scene of a massacre of over 1,000 Muslims by the Serbs in September 1941 after Ustashe excesses the previous summer against the Serbs in eastern Herzegovina.\" and more than 3,000 (per contemporary Croatian sources). The communist forces issued a report on 9 September 1941 emphasizing that the order received on 7 September has been executed and Kulen Vakuf liberated, stating that communist detachment from Lika transported prisoners to Martin Brod. The detachment from Lika was commanded by Pero \u0110ilas and they brutally molested imprisoned adults during their transport to Martin Brod. == Aftermath == Kulen Vakuf was set to fire by refugees and some rebels and drunk people. Veber managed to avoid capture and escaped from rebels encirclement. He and all members of his headquarter were killed by communist shock battalion \"\u010capajev\" on 3 October 1941.:\"Komandant usta\u0161kog garnizona, zloglasni bojnik Vladimir Veber, kojeg su kasnije, 3. oktobra ubili borci juri\u0161nog odreda \u00bb\u010capajev\u00ab, odlu\u010dio je bio da se iz blokade probije preko Prkosa, Lipe i Rip\u010da u Biha\u0107. \" When it was informed about what happened during and after the capture of Kulen Vakuf, the Communist leadership requested a detailed report about the massacre insisting on the list of detachments that participated in massacres, looting and burning of houses. This event served as excuse for already planned internal communist struggle against Gojko Polovina, who together with Stojan Mati\u0107 issued direct order for attack on Kulen Vakuf. According to Polovina, the main cause of this internal conflicts was intention of Vladimir Bakari\u0107 to put Partisan detachments from Lika, the most numerous and best rebel units in Croatia, under command of the Communist party of Croatia, which was refused by Polovina since the beginning of the uprising. To avoid implications that Partisans were war criminals the communist authorities were silent about the Kulen Vakuf massacre, particularly because some of the responsible commanders, like survived the war and advanced in the communist hierarchy, i.e. General \u0110oko Jovani\u0107 awarded with the Order of the People's Hero. == Legacy == The Serbian Orthodox Church canonized priest Vukosav on 28 May 2003. == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == Further reading == * * Ivo Goldstein, \"Usta\u0161ki zlo\u010din, partizanski ustanak, \u010detni\u010dka osveta, ili: \u0161to se doista zbilo u Srbu 27. srpnja 1941.\" == External links == * O pokolju u Kulen Vakufu 1941. godine: A \u0161to kada partizani po\u010dine genocid?
