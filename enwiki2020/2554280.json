In 2001, they leased the former Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway \"High Line\" in Bloomington and Richfield and started restoring trackage. The company's philosophy has been to provide service that a large railway chooses not to provide. They have also focused on economic development, including finding new customers, and working on regaining former rail customers along their lines. This strategy has paid off in an increase in traffic, from 600 carloads in their first year of operation to more than 5000 carloads in 2003. Major commodities include: *resins *chemicals *fuels *lumber *gypsum board *cement *fly-ash *metals *paper *machinery *food and kindred products *scrap material *consumer products Progressive Rail, Inc. also operates wholly owned subsidiary Progressive Rail Specialized Logistics, which provides rail logistics services for machinery and over-dimensional freight shippers. ==References== ==External links== * Progressive Rail, Inc. official site * Progressive Rail Specialized Logistics official site * Current locomotive roster * Union Pacific shortline customer description * Canadian Pacific shortline customer description * University of Minnesota Railroad Club Category:Minnesota railroads Category:Companies operating former Canadian Pacific Railway lines Category:Railway companies established in 1996 Category:Switching and terminal railroads Category:Companies operating former Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad lines ",
