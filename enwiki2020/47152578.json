    "text": "The Bromley-Mills-Treece House is a historic house on Main Street in Marshall, Arkansas. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a cross-gable configuration, clapboard siding, two interior brick chimneys, and a concrete foundation. A single-story porch wraps around two sides of the house, supported by columns on stone piers, with decorative latticework between the bays. Built in 1905, the house is a good example of a well-preserved vernacular structure with minimal Colonial Revival styling (in this case, the porch). The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Searcy County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Arkansas Category:Houses in Searcy County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Searcy County, Arkansas ",
