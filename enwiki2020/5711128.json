    "text": "Ficimia streckeri, also commonly known as the Mexican hooknose snake, the Tamaulipan hooknose snake, and the Texas hook-nosed snake, is a small species of snake in the family Colubridae. The species is native to northeastern Mexico and adjacent southern Texas. ==Etymology== The specific name or epithet, streckeri, is in honor of the American naturalist John Kern Strecker Jr.Beltz, Ellin (2006). Scientific and Common Names of the Reptiles and Amphibians of North America - Explained. www.ebeltz.net/herps/biogappx.html#S.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Ficimia streckeri, p. 256). ==Geographic range== F. streckeri is found primarily in the Mexican states of Hidalgo, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Puebla, eastern San Luis Potos\u00ed, and Tamaulipas, but its geographic range extends as far north as southern Texas in the United States. ==Description== The Mexican hooknose snake is usually in total length (including tail). H.M. Smith and Brodie (1982) report a maximum total length of 47.9 cm (almost 19 inches).Smith HM, Brodie ED Jr (1982). Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. New York: Golden Press. 240 pp. . (Ficimia streckeri, pp. 174-175). It is typically brown or gray in color, with as many as 60 brown or brown-green blotches down the back, which are elongated to almost appear as stripes. Its underside is white or cream-colored. Its most distinctive feature is an upturned snout, much like hognose snakes, which gives it its common name. However, unlike hognose snakes, Mexican hooknose snakes have smooth dorsal scales. Also distinctive is the arrangement of the head shields. There are no internasals, and the rostral separates the prefrontals and contacts the frontal.Schmidt KP, Davis DD (1941). Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. 365 pp. (Ficimia streckeri, p. 203). The smooth dorsal scales are arranged in 17 rows at midbody. Ventrals 126-155, subcaudals 28-41. ==Behavior== The Mexican hooknose snake is mostly nocturnal, and is a burrower.Wright AH, Wright AA (1957). Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada.

Boston: Houghton Mifflin. 429 pp. (Ficimia streckeri, pp. 216-217 + Plate 33 + Map 160). It is fairly slow-moving and harmless to humans. ==Diet== The diet of F. streckeri consists primarily of spiders and centipedes.Behler JL, King FW (1979). The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Reptiles and Amphibians. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. 743 pp., 657 color plates. . (Ficimia streckeri, pp. 611\u2013612 + Plate 547). ==Habitat== The Mexican hooknose snake inhabits woodlands along the Rio Grande river plain, near natural and man-made sources of water.Powell R, Conant R, Collins JT(2016). Peterson Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Fourth Edition. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. xiv + 494 pp. 47 color plates, 207 Figures. . (Ficimia streckeri, pp. 374\u2013375 + Plate 33). ==Defense== The primary form of defense of F. streckeri is making a popping sound by expanding its cloaca when harassed or handled. ==Reproduction== The Mexican hooknose snake is oviparous. www.reptile-database.org. ==References== ==External links== *Herps of Texas: Ficimia streckeri * * ==Further reading== *Axtell RW (1950). \"Two Specimens of the Snake Ficimia streckeri from Texas\".
