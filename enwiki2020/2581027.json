The term was first coined in Mixmag, the British electronic dance and clubbing magazine, in 1995. Superclubs may include nightclubs that have high capacity, or are multi-story, high profile, and operate city and region wide or are well known by people. Some superclubs are owned and managed by a dance music record label or a club that was or is culturally important. The term may also be used to define its position within the club scene hierarchy. Annabel's, which opened in London in 1963, is an early example of a club that could retrospectively be called a superclub. In the early 1980s, The Saint opened in New York with a circular dance floor under a planetarium dome. The Fridge opened in London in 1981, featuring video screens and a chill out lounge. Privilege Ibiza is the \"world's largest nightclub\" according to the Guinness Book of Records, with a capacity of 10,000 people. ==History== Notes:The list of clubs below indicate the dates they were first established. ===1960s=== Early examples of where the term \"superclub\" could be applied include Annabel's (London, 1963), Blow Up (Munich, 1967) and Pacha (Sitges, 1967). ===1970s=== Examples of \"superclubs\" from this period include Pacha, Ibiza in (1973) or Amnesia, Ibiza, (1976), Studio 54, New York City, (1977), Paradise Garage, New York, (1977), Ku Club Ibiza, (1978), Xenon, New York, (1978), Roxy NYC, New York, (1978), Dorian Gray, Frankfurt, (1978), Heaven London, (1979), Danceteria, New York, (1979) ===1980s=== Examples of \"superclubs\" from this period include The Saint in New York in (1980), The Fridge, London, (1981), The Ha\u00e7ienda in Manchester opened in (1982), The Limelight, New York, (1983), Hippodrome, London, (1983), Space, Ibiza, (1986), Tunnel, New York, (1986), Palladium, New York, (1985), Quadrant Park, Liverpool, (1988), Excalibur Nightclub, Chicago, (1989), The Sound Factory, New York, (1989). ===1990s=== Examples of \"superclubs\" from this period include Trade and Turnmills, London, (1990), Ministry Of Sound in London (1991), Juliana's Tokyo, (1991), Zouk, Singapore, (1991), Renaissance (1992), Avalon, Boston (1992), Bunker, Berlin, (1992), E-Werk, Berlin, (1993), G-A-Y, London, (1993), Cream at Nation, Liverpool, (1993), Miss Moneypenny's, Birmingham, (1993), Ultraschall, Munich, (1994), Twilo, New York, (1995), The End, London, (1995), Nation, Washington D.C., (1995), The Emporium.
