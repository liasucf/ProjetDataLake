It has been represented by Democrat Rachel Zenzinger since 2017, following her defeat of incumbent Republican Laura J. Woods. ==Geography== District 19 is based in Denver's northwestern suburbs in Jefferson County, covering most of Arvada and parts of Westminster. The district is located entirely within Colorado's 7th congressional district, and overlaps with the 24th, 27th, and 29th districts of the Colorado House of Representatives. ==Recent election results== Colorado Senators are elected to staggered four-year terms; under normal circumstances, the 19th district holds elections in presidential years. ===2020=== ===2016=== ===2014=== In 2013, incumbent Democrat Evie Hudak chose to resign rather than face a recall election, and her former campaign manager Rachel Zenzinger was appointed to her seat. The resignation triggered an off- cycle election in 2014 which Zenzinger lost to Laura J. Woods. ===2012=== ===Federal and statewide results in District 19=== {| class=wikitable |- ! width=\"30\" | Year ! width=\"60\" | Office ! width=\"180\" | Results |- | 2018 | Governor | align=\"right\" | Polis 54.2 \u2013 41.2% |- | 2016 | President | align=\"right\" | Clinton 47.6 \u2013 42.8% |- | rowspan=\"2\" | 2014 | Senate | align=\"right\" | Udall 47.1 \u2013 46.6% |- | Governor | align=\"right\" | Hickenlooper 49.8 \u2013 45.2% |- | 2012 | President | align=\"right\" | Obama 52.1 \u2013 45.3% |} == References == 19 Category:Jefferson County, Colorado ",
