    "text": "A Fortified District refers to the Japanese Army and in certain cases the Japanese Navy defensive fortified organization in World War II created in order to prevent invasion and provide a base for offensive operation. These fortified districts were built in the area of Manchukuo; Chosen in Korea; Karafuto; Southern Sakhalin and the Kurile Islands - a front of over 6,000 kilometers. ==Examples== The Japanese forces had built 17 \"fortified districts\" and over 4,500 permanent emplacements along the USSR border. Other similar structures were constructed inland in these provinces. In similar form it organized other fortified districts inside mainland Japan (coastal and inner mountainous areas) and overseas provinces (Formosa, Ryukyu, South Pacific Mandate, etc.) Such installations that were constructed for defensive/offensive purposes were used by both sides. They were designed by the Japanese and used by the Russians during 'August Storm' operations in August 1945, when fire from heavy guns on land and coastal Tochkas was used against Japanese forces.
