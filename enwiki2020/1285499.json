On 12 October 1944, Mohneke arrived at Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp to begin overseer training under Dorothea Binz. In November 1944, the SS sent her as an Aufseherin to the Uckermark camp down the road from Ravensbr\u00fcck. Mohneke served in the camp until the Allied liberation in April 1945. At the third Ravensbr\u00fcck Trial, the former SS woman was sentenced to ten years in prison for the maltreatment of concentration camp prisoners. In her appeal against the sentence, she claimed she was sent to Ravensbr\u00fcck against her will by a mandatory call for duty from the labour office. She was released on 14 June 1952 for good conduct after serving only five years of her sentence. ==References== Category:1922 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Female guards in Nazi concentration camps Category:People from East Prussia Category:People from E\u0142k County Category:People convicted in the Hamburg Ravensbr\u00fcck trials ",
