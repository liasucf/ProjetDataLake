    "text": "Deto\u0161 () was a Serbian nobleman that was active somewhere between 1327 and 1392, presumably during the rule of Prince Lazar of Serbia (r. 1379\u20131389). He had possessions around the city of Valjevo, holding a frontier province towards the Kingdom of Hungary in the north. The province, which included three cities (Belaztena, Neprichow and Debrechen), was eventually ceded from Serbia to Hungary, as mentioned in Sigismund's 1392 charter, in which it is known as Dettosfelde (). There is a hypothesis that he was a relative of Vukdrag (fl. 1327). ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:14th-century Serbian nobility Category:Valjevo Category:14th-century deaths ",
