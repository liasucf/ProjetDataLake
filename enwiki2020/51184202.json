Retrieved on 27 July 2016. ==Music career== ===2007\u20132011=== Paul is credited as providing additional vocals and sound design on brother Jai Paul's demo recording \"BTSTU\", as well as mastering the track.

He also mastered the track, as with Jai Paul's debut release. \"Jasmine (demo)\" received critical acclaim in the media, with Pitchfork featuring the song as a \"Best New Track\" within an hour of its appearance on SoundCloud, The New York Times praising its \"Prince era sensuality\" and The Guardian describing the production as \"amazing.\" The song appears on the soundtrack to the 2013 video game, Grand Theft Auto V. ===2014=== Paul collaborated with Hackney vocalist Nao on a song called \"So Good\". This was the first time Paul applied the moniker A. K. Paul. In November, Miguel posted a photo of himself with A. K. Paul and his brother Jai Paul on Instagram, marking a rare appearance from both artists. Also in November, singer Jones collaborated with A. K. on a song called \"You\". \"It\u2019s significantly more dialed-down and intimate when compared to \u201cSo Good\u201d, but every bit as captivating. Jones\u2019 voice is both airy and striking, flowing over Paul's warm backdrop of crystalline synths and steady percussions\". ===2015=== A. K. returned with another production credit. This time on Miguel's album Wildheart for the song \"Flesh\". ===2016=== In March 2016, A. K. and his brother Jai, along with Muz Azar announced the founding of the Paul Institute.

It managed to enter the Billboard Twitter Emerging Artists chart. James Vincent McMorrow reached out to A. K. Paul after listening to \"Landcruisin'\", calling it \"a huge record\". James asked Anup to put his own twist on the lead single from We Move, \"Rising Water\". The result was something extraordinary, James wrote in a statement to Complex. \"He said to me after it was done that he's never done something like this before, lifted an entire vocal from an already written and produced song and then flipped the chord structure and premise of the song.\" ===2017=== Paul collaborated with Guernsey born DJ Mura Masa with the track \"Who Is It Gonna B\" on Mura Masa's debut album. A. K. Paul also reached out to British R&B; artist HIRA - working on production on the single \"Eve\" alongside Craze and Hoax. 2017 also saw the introduction of a new A. K.
