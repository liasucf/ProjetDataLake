    "text": "John-Clay Purves MD (1825\u20131903) was a British geologist and museum curator. ==Biography== Purves initially qualified in medicine at the University of Edinburgh before joining the army and travelling as an army doctor. He had spent a couple of years working for the Geological Survey in Scotland before joining the Yorkshire Museum in 1878. He was initially employed as a temporary assistant to the museum before being made permanent Keeper following the death of the sub-curator Henry Baines. He resigned this post in 1880 following his appointment to the Geological Survey of Belgium. In his subsequent geological career he is attributed with naming the Namurian; a stage in the regional stratigraphy of northwest Europe with an age between roughly 326 and 313 Ma (million years ago). ==Publications== *PURVES, J.C., 1881.
