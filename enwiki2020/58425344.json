    "text": "{| |} The Isotta Fraschini Gamma was an air cooled aircraft engine developed by the Italian engineering company Isotta Fraschini in the 1930s. It was an inverted V12 rated at over . Produced in small numbers for one-off aircraft, including the Ambrosini SAI.107 and Caproni Vizzola F.5 Gamma fighter prototypes, it was developed into the more powerful and more numerous Delta. ==Design and development== The Gamma was an air cooled inverted V engine with 12 cylinders arranged in two banks, each cylinder of bore and stroke . Isotta Fraschini produced the Gamma in small numbers during World War II at a rating of about . The engine formed the basis for a number of other aircraft engines produced by the company. The more powerful Delta was developed as a larger complement to the Gamma. While the Beta straight-six engine was essentially one half of the engine, the Zeta mated two Gamma engines to a common crankshaft to create an X24 engine. The larger engines shared with the Gamma a problem cooling the rearmost cylinders which impeded development. In 1942, there was speculation in the UK about a powerful Italian engine called the Isotta Fraschini Gamma that produced at 2200 rpm for take-off and had a displacement of with a bore of and stroke of . ==Variants== ;Gamma R.C.15: at ;Gamma R.C.35: at ==Applications== * Ambrosini SAI.107 * Caproni Vizzola F.5 Gamma * Savoia-Marchetti SM.86 ==Specifications== ==See also== ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * * Category:Air-cooled aircraft piston engines Category:1930s aircraft piston engines Category:Inverted V12 aircraft engines Gamma ",
