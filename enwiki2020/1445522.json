    "text": "Whitminster is a village and civil parish in Gloucestershire, on the A38 trunk road approximately south of Gloucester and northwest of Stroud. The parish population at the 2011 census was 881. It was formerly known as Wheatenhurst, the name being changed officially in 1945. Wheatenhurst manor, with Whitminster House and the parish church of St Andrew, lies about to the west of the modern village. It has one pub, 'The Old Forge', a village shop, a chip shop, a Chinese restaurant and takeaway, an Indian takeaway and a recently refurbished hotel, The Whitminster Inn. Whitminster is a fast-growing village due to its proximity to the M5 motorway, with Bristol, South Wales and the south Midlands all within an hour's drive, and plans for additional new housing were announced in Spring 2017. The hamlet of Wheatenhurst is still signposted from the A38 at Whitminster. == History == Whitminster Church The manor was originally known as Wheatenhurst, recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086 as Witenhert.Open Domesday Online: Witenhert , accessed June 2017 The name means \"white wooded hill\", or possibly \"wooded hill of a man named Hwita\". The name was corrupted to Whitnester and then Whitmister, and by the 17th century evolved by popular etymology to Whitminster. There was never a minster here. Either or both names were used of the parish until the 20th century, but the village on the A38 came to be known as Whitminster, whereas the smaller group of houses west of the main road in the centre of the parish came to be known as Wheatenhurst.
