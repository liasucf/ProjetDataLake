    "text": "The Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) is an oil company headquartered in Ahmadi, Kuwait. It is a subsidiary of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, a Government- owned holding company. Kuwait was world's 10th largest petroleum and other liquids producer in 2013, and fifth-largest exporter in terms of volume of crude oil and condensates. The managing director of the company is Emad Sultan. ==History== The Kuwait Oil Company was founded in 1934 by Anglo- Persian Oil Company and Gulf Oil as an equally owned partnership. The oil concession rights were awarded to the company on 23 December 1934 and the company started drilling operations in 1936. First oil was discovered in 1938 in Burgan field, followed by discoveries in Magwa in 1951, Ahmadi in 1952, Raudhatain in 1955, Sabriya in 1957, and Minagish in 1959. The initial development of the oil industry coincided with the end of the British Raj in India and many British and Indian administrators and engineers transferred from there to Kuwait. The oil town of Ahmadi was set up to house these workers, and was segregated on racial lines. Such segregation continued in the amenities and recreational facilities offered to company employees. Race to a large extent dictated the status of employees and conditions of employment within the company. In the early part of the 20th century, when the Royal Navy converted their warships to oil burners instead of coal, the British Government depended on a secure supply of Middle Eastern oil. Figures such as Dame Violet Dickson who lived among the Kuwaitis for 40 years were influential in fostering an excellent relationship with the Kuwaitis. The Kuwait Oil Company uses the Kuwait Integrated Digital Field project (KwIDF) for digital oilfield operations. For the meanwhile, KwIDF is one of the most strategic projects the company participated in to support the oil and gas production in Kuwait. BP and Gulf were able to obtain the Kuwaiti oil at very favourable terms for sale via their downstream networks in Europe and adjoining areas. During this time, Gulf would claim that it had a \"special relationship\" with Kuwait. However, all this came to an end in 1975 when the KOC reverted to Kuwaiti ownership. The umbrella organization Kuwait Petroleum Corporation was founded by the government in 1980. ==Former chairmen== Emad Sultan 2019\u2013present Jamal Jafar 2016\u20132019 Hashim Hashim 2013\u20132016 Sami Al-Rushaid 2007\u20132013 Farouk Al-Zanki 2004\u20132007 Ahmad Al-Arbeed 2001\u20132004 Abdul Latif Al- Tourah 1998\u20132001 Khalid Al- Fulaij 1992\u20131998 Issam Hasan Al- Mallah 1984\u20131992 ==See also== *Petroleum industry in Kuwait ==References== ==External links== * Category:Oil and gas companies of Kuwait Category:Non-renewable resource companies established in 1934 Category:1934 establishments in Kuwait ",
