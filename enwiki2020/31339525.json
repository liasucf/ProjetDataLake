The larvae feed on Centaurea jacea, Centaurea scabiosa and Cirsium species. They mine the leaves of their host plant. Young larva make a number of tiny corridor mines. Older larvae make a number of very sloppy fleck mines by working the front half their body under the lower epidermis of the leaf and then devouring most leaf tissue. The opening of the mine is a slit at the side.bladmineerders.nl The larvae are very variable in color, but generally have a blackish-brown head and a greyish-brown body with a yellow-grey underside. ==References== *C.
