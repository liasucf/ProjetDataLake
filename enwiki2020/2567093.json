    "text": "Hit Music was a weekly British chart newsletter; sister publication to Music Week. Hit Music existed for almost nine years, supplying the official UK music charts (as compiled by Gallup and later OCC/CIN). The founding editors were Graham Walker and Tony Brown. The first issue was published 5.09.1992 (chart date: 12.09.1992), the last issue 5.05.2001 (no. 439). Originally it ran parallel to Music Week\u2032s other chart newsletter ChartsPlus (edited also by Graham Walker and Tony Brown), which had been established in May 1991, shortly after the demise of Record Mirror. ChartsPlus featured the singles chart with positions 76 to 200, albums chart positions 76 to 150, plus several genre and format chart, details on every Top 75 new entry, radio playlists (later the E.R.A. Top 100 Airplay charts) and statistics. An annual subscription to ChartsPlus cost \u00a3495. In September 1992, Spotlight Publications, publishers of Music Week, started Hit Music as a cheaper alternative. For only \u00a3110 Hit Music printed the singles chart (Top 75+25, i.e. with compressed positions 76 to 100), artist albums (Top 100), compilation albums (Top 50), rock chart and dance chart (Top 20s), US Top 10s, plus details on Top 75 new entries, chart statistics, year-to-date charts (singles, albums, singles acts, album acts, Top 30s) listings of BPI awards, and number ones. From issue no. 36 (5.06.1993) Hit Music printed the E.R.A. Top 100 Airplay charts, and from 8.01.1994 (issue no. 66) the Top 40 Network Chart (later called The Pepsi Chart). In November 1994 Charts Plus ceased publication and from issue no. 111 (19.11.1994) Hit Music printed the (uncompressed) Top 200 Singles, Top 150 Artists Albums and Top 50 Compilations. From issue no. 211 (2.11.1996) the Artist Albums chart extended to a Top 200. Top 100 Airplay chart was dropped from issue 294 (20.06.1998). The last issue published was no. 439 (5.05.2001). Hit Music folded together with several other Music Week newsletters. By autumn 2001, a successor publication to Hit Music was founded, independent of Music Week, in order to publish the British Top 200 charts: ChartsPlus (\"Charts+Plus\", not to be confused with the 1990s publication mentioned above), which is now called UKChartsPlus. == See also == * UK Singles Chart * UK Albums Chart * Music Week * Record Mirror * UKChartsPlus == External links == *Charts Plus *Bibliography of British Chart books Category:1992 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2001 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Music magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Weekly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines established in 1992 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2001 Category:Listings magazines ",
