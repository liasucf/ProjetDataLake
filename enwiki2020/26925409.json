G\u00fclek citizens believe that the ancient inscriptions in the pass were erected by Alexander. But, actually, these inscriptions were erected much later by the Roman Emperor Caracalla (reigned 211\u2013217) during his campaign against the Parthian Empire.

From 861, G\u00fclek fell under many states, including the Byzantine Empire, the Sultanate of Rum, Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, and the Ramadanids. In 1517, sultan Selim I (reigned 1512\u20131520) of the Ottoman Empire annexed G\u00fclek. In 1832, G\u00fclek was briefly occupied by the forces of the rebellious Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt but was returned to Ottoman control after the convention of K\u00fctahya. After the First World War, French forces tried to occupy G\u00fclek,See Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement but after the local militia forces from G\u00fclek ambushed the French forces on 27 May 1920 at the pass of Karbo\u011faz\u0131, the French army gave up this project. During the Turkish Republic era the name of the settlement was Panzin\u00e7ukuru and Yayla\u00e7ukuru up to 1954. In 1954 the settlement was declared a seat of township and renamed as G\u00fclek. Above the Cilician Gates and a few kilometers from the village is G\u00fclek Kalesi (Armenian: Kuklak; Arab: Kawl\u0101k), a large fortification of considerable antiquity which retains evidence of Byzantine and Arab periods of occupation, but is primarily a construction of the 12th and 13th centuries attached to the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. Its circuit walls and towers at the south and west cover a distance of over 450 meters. An extensive photographic survey and plan of G\u00fclek Castle was made between 1973 and 1979. The survey was conducted by the University of California at Berkeley. == References and Notes == Category:Towns in Turkey Category:Yaylas in Turkey Category:Populated places in Tarsus District ",
