He was the chairman of Comcast Spectacor, a Philadelphia-based sports and entertainment company that owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League; the Wells Fargo Center; the regional sports network Comcast SportsNet; and Global Spectrum, an international facilities management company. He formerly owned the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association, and was part- owner of the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League. ==Early life and education== Snider was born to a Jewish family in the Washington, D.C. region, the son of a grocery-store chain owner.John Corr,\"Ed Snider: A Nice Guy Who Finished First\", Philadelphia Inquirer, May 6, 1986. He attended the University of Maryland and earned his bachelor's degree.Profile, Ethicsandentrepreneurship.org; accessed April 11, 2016. ==Business career== Snider became a partner in Edge Ltd., a record company, and sold the company to join Jerry Wolman (builder) and his brother-in-law Earl Foreman (attorney) to buy the Philadelphia Eagles in 1964. He was given a 7% stake in the team, and served as vice president and treasurer.Profile, Jewishvirtuallibrary.org; accessed April 11, 2016. Upon learning that the NHL was planning to expand, Snider made plans for a new arena\u2014the Spectrum\u2014to house both a hockey team and the 76ers. On February 8, 1966, the NHL awarded Philadelphia a conditional franchise, one which would eventually be named the Philadelphia Flyers and start playing in 1967. Snider assumed control of the Spectrum in 1971, taking over as chairman of the board. In 1974 Snider created Spectacor as a holding company for the Flyers and the Spectrum. The Flyers became the first NHL expansion team to win the Stanley Cup in 1974, and to repeat as champions in 1975. Spectacor would found or acquire several businesses under his direction, most notably a regional premium cable channel, PRISM, and the first all-sports radio station, WIP. Seeing that a new arena would keep the Flyers competitive with the rest of the league, Snider began planning for what would become the CoreStates Center (now the Wells Fargo Center) in 1988. Prior to the Wells Fargo Center's opening in 1996, he sold a 66% stake in Spectacor to Philadelphia-based Comcast, creating Comcast Spectacor. However, Snider remained chairman of the venture, retaining a 34% interest. Soon after, Comcast Spectacor along with the Philadelphia Phillies created Comcast SportsNet in 1996. The company also bought the 76ers, who had been Snider's tenants since 1971. Comcast Spectacor also won an expansion franchise in the AHL, the Phantoms. In a 1999 Philadelphia Daily News poll, Snider was selected as the city's greatest sports mover and shaker, beating out legends such as Connie Mack, Sonny Hill, Bert Bell, and Roger Penske. In 2005, Snider became a prominent investor in a Foxwoods slots casino proposed for the waterfront in Philadelphia.Foxwoods website; accessed April 11, 2016. In September 2008, facing massive opposition at the originally intended site, backers for the slots casino decided to seek a new location in the Center City area, next to Philadelphia's Chinatown community. ==Nonprofit organizations== In 1985, Snider was one of the founding contributors of the Ayn Rand Institute (ARI), which was established by the philosopher Leonard Peikoff to promote Rand's philosophy of Objectivism. In 1990, after a dispute between ARI and philosopher David Kelley, Snider became a backer of Kelly's rival organization, the Institute for Objectivist Studies (now known as The Atlas Society). In 2003, Snider became a founding board member of the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness (now named Beyond Celiac.) He continued to support the organization until his death in 2016. In 2005, Snider created the Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation to provide a means to reach inner-city children in the Philadelphia area and provide them with the opportunity to learn to play hockey. ==Honors and awards== In 1988, Snider was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.
