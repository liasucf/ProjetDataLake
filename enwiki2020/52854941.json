Kaye was born in Yorkshire, England, and arrived in Port Phillip District in February 1842. He was a partner in a Melbourne firm of squatters' auctioneers, Kaye and Butchart. He was elected to the first wholly elective Legislative Council for Eastern Province, sworn-in on 1 November 1856. Kaye was disqualified from the Council on 1 February 1857 for bribery under the Election Act. He had been found guilty by a committee of the Legislative Council following a petition by William Highett alleging that Kaye's payment of \u00a3200 to an election agent to campaign for him in the electorate had amounted to bribery; the payment was found to have \"induced [the agent] to exert a corrupt influence upon the election, by other means than the giving of money\". ==References== Category:1820s births Category:1893 deaths Category:19th-century Australian politicians Category:Members of the Victorian Legislative Council Category:People from Yorkshire Category:English emigrants to Australia ",
