Funny Face was a brand of drink mix originally made and publicly sold by the Pillsbury Company, from 1964 to 1994. and in limited productions (mainly in the Midwestern and New England regions of the U.S.A.) from 1994 to 2001. The brand was introduced as competition to the similar (and more familiar and better-selling) Kool-Aid made by Kraft Foods. The product came in assorted flavors and was intended to be mixed with water to make an enjoyable-tasting beverage. The product name \"Funny Face\" was based on the packaging and advertising created by Hal Silverman of the Campbell Mithun advertising agency. Each flavor was designated by a cartoon character with an amusingly- distorted face. The original flavors, and their names, were Goofy Grape, Rootin' Tootin' Raspberry, Freckle-Face Strawberry, Loud-Mouth Lime, Injun Orange, and Chinese Cherry. These last two, being offensive ethnic stereotypes, were soon renamed to Jolly-Olly Orange and Choo Choo Cherry. Additional flavors were added later, including Captain Black Cherry, Chilly Cherry Cola, Lefty Lemonade (and Lefty Lemon-Lime), Loud Mouth Punch, Pistol Pink Lemonade, Rah-Rah Root beer, Rudi Tutti-Frutti, Tart Lil' Imitation Lemonade, Tart 'N' Tangy Lemon, With-It Watermelon, Top Banana, and Chug-a- Lug-a Chocolate, the latter intended to be mixed with milk rather than water. The mix was sweetened with calcium cyclamate. Cyclamates and its salts (including calcium cyclamate and sodium cyclamate) were banned in the United States in 1970; it was briefly replaced by saccharin, which proved unpopular, after which the product was offered unsweetened. Various promotional tchotchkes were offered as premiums in support of the brand, such as mugs and pitchers bearing the likeness of the various cartoon faces associated with each flavor. A series of children's books such as \"How Freckle Face Strawberry Got His Name\" and similar titles were published. The brand's tagline was \"Funny Face is Fun To Drink!\" The Funny Face brand was purchased by Brady Enterprises in 1980, and continued to sell nationwide until 1994. A limited production relaunch (albeit with some modifications for the 21st century) was briefly sold in selected areas from 1994 to 2001. On November 28, 2012, Decas Cranberry Products out of Carver, Massachusetts re-relaunched the Funny Face drink mix product and currently has resurrected a total of four of the original characters; this includes Rootin' Tootin' Raspberry, Freckle Face Strawberry, Choo Choo Cherry, and Goofy Grape. Once again, they received updated packaging designs for more modern times. A line of flavored dried cranberry and fruit snacks was also introduced using the four reprised characters. ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Products introduced in 1964 Category:Powdered drink mixes Category:Fruit and vegetable characters ",
