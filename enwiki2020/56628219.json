    "text": "Suite for the Green Eighties is an album by European jazz group the Vienna Art Orchestra which was first released in 1982 on the Hat ART label.Vienna Art Orchestra: Suite for the Green Eighties accessed February 25, 2014Vienna Art Orchestra discography accessed February 19, 2018 ==Reception== The Allmusic review stated \"the five-part work is a crosshatch of jazz, blues, circus music, postmodern harmonic and intervallic invention, and dance music (as in ballet). The temptation to call it a pastiche is too easy to drape over this mammoth construction of color and texture in sound. Before this suite begins -- and it is actually more like a symphony than a jazz suite -- there are three R\u00fcegg compositions that set the audience up for the drama. ... When the \"Suite\" finally begins, listeners are almost taken off guard since it sounds like a coda. Before the vibes and trumpets go into a dance of intricate counterpoint, the band plays \"fliessend,\" smoothly and evenly, and the movement becomes almost contemplative, with the exception of the two contrapuntal instruments now playing in restrained tones. As the bop horn lines state the theme for the rest of the suite, short, choppy interludes of dissonance and even sets of quiet tone rows are inserted into the melody! R\u00fcegg's harmonic sensibility is so developed that he has no difficulties in traversing isorhythms to get to his desired place. By the time the last movement is reached, one would swear that all elegiac notions have been left behind in order to join Buddy Rich and Count Basie in a Kansas City block party. Swinging brass, jump-start rhythms, and angular solos carry the joyous suite to its impossible ending -- in the quiet of the evening with only the feeling that something new is possible for the first time in a long, long while\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Mathias R\u00fcegg # \"Haluk\" \u2212 14:12 # \"Pl\u00e4doyer for Sir Mayor Moll\" \u2212 6:22 # \"Nanan N'Z Gang\" \u2212 11:28 # \"Blue for Two\" \u2212 8:55 Omitted from CD reissue # \"Suite for the Green Eighties Part I\" \u2212 11:39 # \"Suite for the Green Eighties Part II\" \u2212 4:17 # \"Suite for the Green Eighties Part III\" \u2212 8:02 # \"Suite for the Green Eighties Part IV\" \u2212 8:12 # \"Suite for the Green Eighties Part V\" \u2212 5:51 ==Personnel== *Mathias R\u00fcegg - arranger, conductor *Karl Fian - trumpet *Herbert Joos \u2212 flugelhorn, baritone horn, double trumpet, alphorn *Christian Radovan \u2212 trombone *Billy Fuchs \u2212 tuba *Harry Sokal - soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, flute *Wolfgang Puschnig \u2212 alto saxophone, bass clarinet, flute, piccolo *Ingo Morgana \u2212 tenor saxophone *Uli Scherer \u2212 piano, melodica *Woody Schabata \u2212 marimba, tabla, vibraphone *J\u00fcrgen Wuchner \u2212 bass *Wolfgang Reisinger \u2212 drums, gongs, percussion *Stefanski \u2212 drums, percussion *Lauren Newton - voice ==References== Category:1982 live albums Category:Hathut Records live albums Category:Vienna Art Orchestra live albums ",
