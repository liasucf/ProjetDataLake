There are three chapters: \u2160, \"The Concept of Alchemy\" (); \u2161, \"The Theory of Alchemy\" (); \u2162, \"The Practice of Alchemy\" (). These are followed by a section of five \"Documents\" (Italian edition has ten), which are excerpts taken from well-known texts on alchemy: 1, The earliest sources; 2, The medieval mystics and scientists; 3, The triumph of Hermetism in the Renaissance; 4, Alchemy in the modern era; 5, Alchemy in literature.

The book opens with a series of reproductions of some elaborate images from , accompanied by texts taken from the Emerald Tablet, the essential text of Hermetic philosophy, or alchemy, which was born of the oldest civilisations, and the transformation of metals has become one of the emblematic acts. But the search for \"philosophers by means of fire\" is not limited to the mere transmutation of lead into gold; it is indeed a philosophy, which most often takes the form of an \"experimental metaphysics\", and which has also given birth to a language\u2014the Qabalah\u2014and an extraordinary florilegium of and symbols. Aromatico explores in the book this compound of science and myth, examining ancient texts and illuminated manuscripts to shed light on an enigmatic science of spells, ceremonies, and secret beliefs. == Selected publications == * With Marcella Peruzzi, Medicamenti, pozioni e incantesimi del Ricetario Magico Urbinate, Roche, 1994 * Alchimia: l\u2019oro della conoscenza, collection \u00abUniversale Electa/Gallimard\u00bb (n\u00ba 86), serie Storia e civilt\u00e0. 176 pages.
