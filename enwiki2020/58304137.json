Its chief geographical features are a pond, small streams, a spring well and a dug well. Claragh is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 111 acres. ==History== From medieval times up to the early 1600s, the land belonged to the McKiernan Clan. The 1609 Plantation of Ulster Map depicts the townland as Clarhagh. A grant of 1610 spells the name as Clarhagh. A lease of 1611 spells the name as Clovagh. An inquisition of 1629 spells the name as Claragh. The 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells it as Cleighragh. In the Plantation of Ulster King James VI and I by grant dated 27 June 1610, granted the Manor of Keylagh, which included three-quarters of the poll of Clarhagh, to John Achmootie, a Scottish Groom of the Bedchamber. His brother Alexander Achmootie was granted the neighbouring Manor of Dromheada. The remaining quarter of Claragh was given to the Church of Ireland and is now the townland of Claraghpottle Glebe. On 16 August 1610 John Aghmootie sold his lands in Tullyhunco to James Craig. On 1 May 1611 James Craig leased 3/4 of the poll of Clovagh to Donatio McKernan. On 29 July 1611 Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester and others reported that John Auchmothy and Alexander Auchmothye have not appeared at the lands awarded to them.

Sir James Craig died in the siege of Croaghan Castle on 8 April 1642. His land was inherited by his brother John Craig of Craig Castle, County Cavan and of Craigston, County Leitrim, who was chief doctor to both King James I and Charles I.
