He was Apple employee #282, and was hired in February 1979, initially as an Apple II service technician. He also designed the motherboard for Apple's LaserWriter. Burrell was working in Apple's service department when he helped Bill Atkinson add more memory to an Apple II computer in an innovative fashion. Bill recommended him to Jef Raskin, who was looking for a hardware engineer to help him with his newly formed Macintosh project. As a member of the design team, Burrell designed five different motherboards during the course of Macintosh development, all of which used techniques based on Programmable Array Logic (PAL) chips to achieve maximum functionality with a minimal chip count. Burrell left the company before releasing Apple's \"Turbo Mac\" design platform, which included an internal hard drive and a further simplified chipset. He was later a co- founder of Radius Inc.. ==Personal life== Smith is retired and living in Palo Alto.Inside the Mac Revolution - Wired - 16 December 2004 He reportedly suffered from schizophrenia during the 1990s.Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson, page xv.
