After Kai Nagel\u2019s departure to TU Berlin in 2004, Kay W. Axhausen joined the team, bringing a different approach and experience.\" The Multi-Agent Transport Simulation MATSim, edited by Andreas Horni, Kai Nagel, Kay W. Axhausen. https://github.com/matsim-org/book ==Areas of Application== MATSim has been applied to various areas: road transport, public transport, freight transport, regional evacuation etc. ==References== ==External links== * http://www.matsim.org/ Category:Models of computation Category:Complex systems theory Category:Multi-agent systems Category:Traffic simulation ",
