    "text": "\"Bump n' Grind\" is a song by American R&B; singer R. Kelly. It was released on January 25, 1994 as the second single from his debut solo studio album 12 Play (1993). The track became a number one single on the US Billboard Hot 100 (temporarily interrupting the six-week run of Ace of Base's \"The Sign\"), and it also spent twelve weeks at number one on the US Hot R&B; Songs chart as Kelly's third number-one R&B; hit, becoming the longest-running number-one of 1994 in the US, and the longest-running R&B; single at that time. The song also reached number eight on the UK Singles Chart, following the massive success of his previous single, \"She's Got That Vibe\" (which was actually a re-release). Kelly released three versions of \"Bump n' Grind\": the original album version and two remixes. The original LP version was made available for airplay on urban and Top 40 pop radio stations alike at first, but eventually the \"Old School\" remix was issued shortly and gained massive airplay on urban, adult R&B;/soul and rhythmic radio stations. Kelly also released the \"Bump n' Grind (How I Feel It Extended Mix)\", which was used in the original video for the song. This version received major play on urban radio as well. Some stations still play the original version to this day. ==Music video== The music video does not feature the famous intro. It is also black and white and is filmed like a live concert performance. The music video was directed by Kim Watson.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472896/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_dr#directors ==Live performances== Kelly always performs the intro of the song at almost all events he has performed in, Kelly usually performs the \"Bump N' Grind (Remix)\" instead of the original at concert, despite the original single's huge success.
