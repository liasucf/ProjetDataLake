He says that children are more likely to understand that one isn't born racist, but becomes one. Adults are not likely to change their ideas. The author writes this after going to a manifestation in France against bans on immigration where his then ten-year- old daughter tries to comprehend what they are fighting for and what racism is, who is racist, how one becomes racist, if she is in fact also racist. ==References== Category:Non-fiction books about racism Category:Works by Tahar Ben Jelloun Category:1998 non-fiction books ",
