The Soviet Second League was split after the season and all national (republican) competitions were placed at the lower league (4th division), while the upper league (3rd division) was transformed into a buffer league. The 1989 Football Championship of Ukrainian SSR was won for the first time by FC Volyn Lutsk. In the competition Volyn passed the 1988 Football Champion of Ukrainian SSR, FC Bukovyna Chernivtsi. Like the last season Bukovyna, Volyn also failed to earn promotion to the First League as it lost the inter-zonal playoffs. ==Teams== ===Map=== ===Promoted teams=== *Kremin Kremenchuk \u2013 Champion of the Fitness clubs competitions (KFK) (returning to professional level after an absence of 20 seasons) **Note: Unlike the previous team Dnipro Kremenchuk that represented the local factory Kredmash, the new team represented the Soviet factory of KrAZ and conditionally is considered as a successor of Dnipro. === Relegated teams === *Zorya Voroshylovhrad \u2013 (Returning after 2 seasons) *Kolos Nikopol \u2013 (Returning after 10 seasons) ===Moved outside of the Zone=== * FC Desna Chernihiv was placed in the Zone 5 * FC Karpaty Lviv was revived and without participating in amateur competitions placed in the Zone 5 === Renamed teams === *Prior to the start of the season Torpedo Lutsk was renamed to Volyn Lutsk. *Prior to the start of the season Spartak Zhytomyr was renamed to Polissya Zhytomyr. *Prior to the start of the season Novator Zhdanov was renamed to Novator Mariupol. ==League standings== ===Top goalscorers=== The following were the top ten goalscorers. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !# !Scorer !Goals (Pen.) !Team |- |1 |Ihor Yavorsky |align=center|35 |Nyva Ternopil |- |2 |Viktor Karachun |align=center|28 |Zorya Voroshylovhrad |- |rowspan=2|3 |Volodymyr Dykyi |align=center|22 |Volyn Lutsk |- |Eduard Valenko |align=center|22 |Krystal Kherson |- |rowspan=4|5 |Oleksandr Malyshenko |align=center|21 |Zorya Voroshylovhrad |- |Oleksandr Usatyi |align=center|21 |Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih |- |Ivan Shariy |align=center|21 |Vorskla Poltava |- |Volodymyr Shyshkov |align=center|21 |Polissya Zhytomyr |} ==See also== * Soviet Second League ==External links== * 1989 Soviet Second League, Zone 6 (Ukrainian SSR football championship).
