    "text": "The 2020\u201321 season of the Belgian First Division B is scheduled to begin in August 2020 and end in April 2021. ==Team changes== ===In=== * Deinze were promoted from the 2019\u201320 Belgian First Amateur Division as champions. * Seraing and RWD Molenbeek filled in the open spots left by the extra relegations of Roeselare and Virton, as highest finishing teams which had obtained a professional footballing license. * As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium, no team was relegated from the 2019\u201320 Belgian First Division A and two teams were promoted from the 2019\u201320 Belgian First Division B, meaning two extra teams needed to be added to the league. From the 2019\u201320 Belgian First Amateur Division only Lierse Kempenzonen remained as team which had obtained the necessary Belgian professional football license (despite nearly relegating in that division), hence they were promoted and finally as no other team was eligible from that division, the Club NXT squad was added to again end up with 8 teams. ===Out=== * Due to the Belgian First Division A expanding from 16 to 18 teams, both finalists K Beerschot VA and Oud-Heverlee Leuven were promoted to Belgian First Division A for the next season. * Lokeren went bankrupt and folded. Temse moved to Lokeren and renamed themselves KSC Lokeren-Temse playing in the Belgian Second Amateur Division. * Both Roeselare and Virton were denied a professional license and forced to relegate to the Belgian First Amateur Division. ==Format changes== Only in the 2020\u201321 season, the league will no longer consist of two separate competitions but will be one single league in which all teams play each other four times. There will be no more playoffs, no teams will qualify for the Europa League playoffs and the bottom team will be relegated directly. ==Team information== ===Stadiums and locations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
