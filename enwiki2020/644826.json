    "text": "United Nations Security Council resolution 660, adopted on 2 August 1990, after noting its alarm of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, the Council condemned the invasion and demanded Iraq withdraw immediately and unconditionally to positions as they were on 1 August 1990. Yemen called upon Iraq and Kuwait to enter into immediate negotiations to resolve their differences, thanking the Arab League for its efforts. Talks between both sides broke down the day before in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The Council also decided to meet again as necessary to ensure compliance with the current resolution. The resolution was adopted by 14 votes to none, while Yemen did not participate in voting. It was the first of twelve resolutions on the conflict passed in 1990. ==See also== * Foreign relations of Iraq * Gulf War * Invasion of Kuwait * Iraq\u2013Kuwait relations * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 601 to 700 (1987\u20131991) ==References== ==External links== * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 0660 0660 Category:Gulf War Category:1990 in Iraq Category:1990 in Kuwait Category:Iraq\u2013Kuwait relations 0660 Category:August 1990 events ",
