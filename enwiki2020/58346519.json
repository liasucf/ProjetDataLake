It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==History== William Carmer moved from Erie County, New York to this area in 1844. It is unclear when he constructed this house. ==Description== The William Carmer House consists of two rectangular masses: a small single-story section and a larger one-and-one-half-story section. The sections are joined at a corner, suggesting that the building was constructed in two stages. The larger section has Classical detailing such as the framed entrance, fluted corner pilasters, a wide frieze, and a cornice with returns. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Genesee County, Michigan Category:Greek Revival architecture in Michigan ",
