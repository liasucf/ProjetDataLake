    "text": "The Vermont Transit Line is a proposed bus rapid transit or heavy rail subway line in the Metro Busway network in Los Angeles, California. It is planned to operate on a north to south route on Vermont Avenue between the B Line's Vermont/Sunset station and the C Line's Vermont/Athens station on the Metro Rail system. The project feasibility study was released in February 2019 with a proposed completion date of 2028 for BRT and 2067 for rail. It is part of Metro's Twenty-eight by '28 initiative and is partially funded by Measure M. The route will have signal priority at traffic lights and will have a dedicated right of way. Metro reports the cost is $425 million. ==History== This corridor is currently, as of 2020, the second busiest bus corridor in ridership with 45,000 boarding per work day. Metro estimates this BRT will have 75,000 weekday boarding's once completed. For that reason, light rail and subway options are also being developed. Metro is looking for ways to accelerate the option. Rail-based options are not scheduled to receive Measure R funds until after 2067. ==Initial Alternative Analysis== Two alternative analyses were developed. ===BRT=== Metro currently plans to construct BRT with various stations along its route. Metro will study two options for bus rapid transit. :\"side running\" :\"side-center running\" Per metro, each bus station would be one mile apart. :A technical study will also look at an entirely \"center-running\" option. These feasibility options were sent to formal environmental review status. Metro plans to commence the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) with the options by 2019. Metro planned budget for BRT is $425 Million. ===Rail=== For rail, concepts have been published in the feasibility study. Metro also contents there are no monies assigned for rail. These concepts were published. :A LRT floor concept would cost 2.7 to 3.2 billion. Underground section required between Wilshire Boulevard and Slauson Avenue. :A HRT concept would cost 3.7 to 4.4 billion with five new underground stations. A new junction and platform under Wilshire/Vermont station. Make the line a continuation of the Red Line. A one seat underground ride from North Hollywood to South Los Angeles. ==Route== Destinations along the route include Exposition Park and its museums Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, the Natural History Museum and the California Science Center. Also, local sports stadiums, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the Banc of California Stadium. USC is along the route. It would also connect with Expo Line at Expo/Vermont station. The following table shows potential BRT metro stations, per feasibility study from North to South. Also listed are potential LRT and HRT stations. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Station Options !
