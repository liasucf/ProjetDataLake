    "text": "Serial Box is a premium digital audio and reading platform and publisher that delivers ongoing stories via online and mobile in short, serialized installments. Designed for consumption on smartphones in either audiobook or e-book format, users can read or listen to each weekly episodic installment. The installments are typically 25 minutes to read or about an hour to listen, and are delivered to consumers via mobile apps. The company produces original fiction with a focus on science fiction, fantasy, mystery, crime and thrillers. Users can use the Serial Box mobile app to access both audio and text and even toggle between them. NPR stated that Serial Box aimed to be \"HBO for readers\" and BuzzFeed named it a must-have app in 2017. ==History== In September 2015, Julian Yap and Molly Barton launched Serial Box. The first production was Bookburners, created by Max Gladstone. The writing process was based on television serials rather than novels. Founder Yap realized that he was reading fewer novels due to time constraints from work. Both Yap and Barton believe that serialized fiction will make reading more accessible and social. ==Process== Serial Box hires a lead author, or showrunner, write a pilot episode and a \"show bible\" which will outline the plot for each season. After this, Serial Box brings together a team of writers who will contribute ideas in a manner similar to a television writers' room. At the end of this period, each author is assigned episodes to write. Whereas a novel generally takes 2\u20133 years to be written and published, a Serial Box production can be completed 6 months from the start date. Because the first episode is published before the season is completed, the authors can tailor the ending of the season to the audience's reactions. It is the responsibility of the showrunner to ensure that all episodes maintain a consistent writing style despite the involvement of multiple authors. ==Awards== Molly Barton, Jeff Li, James Stuart, and Julian Yap were nominated for the 2019 World Fantasy Professional Award for their work with Serial Box. ==Serial Box Original Productions== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
