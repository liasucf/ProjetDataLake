    "text": "The Fanfare du 27e Bataillon de Chasseurs Alpin is a military band unit of the French Army. The band is attached the 27e bataillon de chasseurs alpins (27th BCA) and effectively serves as the regimental band of the Chasseurs Alpins, being that it is the single and last fanfare band of the regiment as well as this combat arm of the Army. == Brief description == The band incorporates as part of its instrumentation the Alphorn, a traditional instrument of the Alpine hill and mountain villages of Savoy, which has been able to attract the public's favor and which allows to complete the extent of its musical repertoire. The Alphorn is the ancestor of the big family of musical horns and historically has been used by sheepherders to aide in herd recall in the French Alps. In wartime, it is also has been used to signal the arrival of invading forces to the region. Today the band can be distinguished by its small size (18 musicians) as compared to the other bands of the armed forces, as well as its gender diversity, with females making up more than 30% of its ranks.https://www.defense.gouv.fr/terre/bloc-patrimoine/musiques/fanfare- du-27e-bataillon-de-chasseurs-alpinshttp://www.forum- militaire.fr/topic/8961-fanfare-du-27e-bataillon-de-chasseurs-alpin/ Since December 2016, the band has explored creating a big band ensemble in its structure.http://www.unor-reserves.fr/index.php/94-articles-en-une/124-la- fanfare-du-27e-bca-recrute ===Performance Schedule/History=== Beginning in February every year, the band begins to develop its performance schedule for various events around the country. In many cases, the participation in events mostly revolves around parades and ceremonies as there are not many military tattoo in France.
