He played mostly as an attacking midfielder, but was also deployed as a forward or a winger. Often considered one of the best players of his generation and regarded by many as one of the greatest of all time, Ronaldinho won two FIFA World Player of the Year awards (in 2004 and 2005) and a Ballon d'Or in 2005. A global icon of the sport, he was renowned for his technical skills and creativity; due to his agility, pace and dribbling ability, as well as his use of tricks, feints, overhead kicks, no- look passes and accuracy from free-kicks. Ronaldinho made his career debut for Gr\u00eamio, in 1998. At age 20, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain in France before signing for Barcelona in 2003. In his second season with Barcelona, he won his first FIFA World Player of the Year award, as Barcelona won the 2004\u201305 La Liga title. The season that followed is considered one of the best in his career as he was integral in Barcelona winning the UEFA Champions League, their first in fourteen years, as well as another La Liga title, giving Ronaldinho his first career double. After scoring two spectacular solo goals in the first 2005-06 El Cl\u00e1sico, Ronaldinho became the second Barcelona player, after Diego Maradona in 1983, to receive a standing ovation from Real Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u. Ronaldinho also received his second FIFA World Player of the Year award, as well as the Ballon d'Or. Following a second-place La Liga finish to rivals Real Madrid in the 2006\u201307 season and an injury-plagued 2007\u201308 season, Ronaldinho departed Barcelona to join Milan. He then returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo in 2011 and Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro a year later where he won the Copa Libertadores, before moving to Mexico to play for Quer\u00e9taro and then back to Brazil to play for Fluminense in 2015. Ronaldinho accumulated numerous other individual awards in his career. He was included in the UEFA Team of the Year and the FIFA World XI three times, named UEFA Club Footballer of the Year in 2006 and the South American Footballer of the Year in 2013, and was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the world's greatest living players compiled by Pel\u00e9. At international level, Ronaldinho played 97 matches for the Brazil national team, scoring 33 goals and representing his country in two FIFA World Cups. He was an integral part of the 2002 FIFA World Cup-winning team in Korea and Japan, starring alongside Ronaldo and Rivaldo in an attacking trio, and being named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team. As captain, he led Brazil to their second FIFA Confederations Cup title in 2005 and was named Man of the Match in the final. Ronaldinho scored three goals in the tournament, taking his total to nine, making him the competition's joint all-time leading goalscorer. ==Early and personal life== Born in Porto Alegre in 1980, Ronaldinho moved into an affluent suburb at the age of eight Ronaldo de Assis Moreira was born on 21 March 1980 in the city of Porto Alegre, the state capital of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. His mother, Miguelina El\u00f3i Assis dos Santos, is a former salesperson who studied to become a nurse. His father, Jo\u00e3o de Assis Moreira, was a shipyard worker and footballer for local club Esporte Clube Cruzeiro (not to be confused with the larger Cruzeiro Esporte Clube). After Ronaldo's older brother Roberto signed with Gr\u00eamio, the family moved to a home in the more affluent Guaruj\u00e1 section of Porto Alegre, which was a gift from Gr\u00eamio to convince Roberto to stay at the club. Still, Roberto's career was ultimately cut short by injury. It was in their new home where his father hit his head and drowned in the swimming pool when Ronaldo was eight. Today, Roberto acts as his manager, while his sister Deisi works as his press coordinator. Ronaldo's football skills began to blossom at the age of eight, and he was first given the nickname Ronaldinho \u2013 \"inho\" meaning small \u2013 because he was often the youngest and the smallest player in youth club matches. He developed an interest in futsal and beach football, which later expanded to organized football. Many of his signature moves originate from futsal, especially his ball control.Futsalfeed.com (14 March 2020). \"Top 10 Footballers Who Played Futsal!\", \"futsalfeed.com\". Retrieved 14 March 2020. His first brush with the media came at the age of 13, when he scored all 23 goals in a 23\u20130 victory against a local team. Ronaldinho was identified as a rising star at the 1997 U-17 World Championship in Egypt, in which he scored two goals on penalty kicks. Growing up, his idols included the World Cup winning stars; Rivelino (from 1970), Diego Maradona (from 1986), Rom\u00e1rio (from 1994), and his two future international teammates Ronaldo and Rivaldo (which would form the attacking trio in Brazil's 2002 World Cup winning team). Ronaldinho is the father of a son, Jo\u00e3o, born on 25 February 2005 to Brazilian dancer Jana\u00edna Mendes and named after his late father.

In a Round of 16 match against Guingamp, Ronaldinho scored two second half goals in the game after having entered the match as a half-time substitute. Despite Ronaldinho's initial success with the club, the season was marred by controversy with Paris Saint-Germain manager Luis Fern\u00e1ndez, claiming that the Brazilian was too focused on the Parisian nightlife rather than football, and complained that his holidays in Brazil never ended at the scheduled times. ====2002\u201303 season==== Despite repeated rifts with Fern\u00e1ndez, Ronaldinho returned to the team for the 2002\u201303 season, with the player switching to the number 10 shirt.

The first goal was a free kick, which curled past numerous Marseille players in the 18-yard box before sailing past goalkeeper Vedran Runje.

For his performance, Ronaldinho was given a standing ovation by the Parisian supporters. Unfortunately for the club, however, Ronaldinho and the team failed to capture the form that got them to the final as they bowed out 2\u20131 to Auxerre due to a last minute goal from Jean-Alain Boumsong.

He made nine appearances during his two-month stint at the club, failing to impress and being heavily criticized by the fans. Fluminense sporting director Mario Bittencourt stated, \"Ronaldinho asked us for a meeting. He respectfully told us he didn't feel he was able to perform as good as he wanted and that it was a bad situation for him. He made a great gesture in saying he wasn't being the player he felt he could be right now. I'll never speak about whether or not he is retiring.

However, deemed \"top heavy and unbalanced\", the team finished with only six goals in five games, with Ronaldinho himself going scoreless and finishing with only one assist (for Gilberto's goal in a 4\u20131 group stage victory over Japan), as he turned in his worst collective performance in his international career. Brazil endured a disappointing campaign that culminated in a 1\u20130 loss to France in the quarter-finals, during which the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o had only one shot on goal. The team was harshly criticized by Brazilian fans and media following their return home. On 3 July, two days after Brazil's elimination, vandals immolated and destroyed a 23-foot (7.5-metre) tall fiberglass and resin statue of Ronaldinho in Chapec\u00f3. The statue had been erected in 2004 to celebrate his first FIFA World Player of the Year award. That same day, Ronaldinho, joined by Adriano, returned to the city of Barcelona and held a party at his home, which was continued into the early morning hours at a nightclub. This aggravated the hard feelings of many Brazilian fans, who believed that they were betrayed by the lack of effort from the squad. Displaying a passivity to Brazil's poor showing, the 2006 World Cup is now seen as the turning point in Ronaldinho's career, with his time at the summit of the game almost up. 1970 Brazil World Cup winner Tost\u00e3o wrote in O Tempo: \"Ronaldinho lacks an important characteristic of Maradona and Pel\u00e9 \u2014 aggression.

Retrieved 14 November 2013 Due to his ability to score and create goals, he was capable of playing in several offensive positions, on either wing or in a free central role. Throughout his career, he was often deployed as a forward or as a winger, although he usually played as a classic number 10 in an attacking midfield role. While he is naturally right\u2013footed, during his time at Barcelona, Ronaldinho was also used as an inverted winger on the left flank at times by manager Frank Rijkaard, while the left\u2013footed Messi was deployed on the right; this position allowed him to take on defenders on the outside and cross the ball, or cut inside and shoot on goal with his stronger foot. He was also capable of playing as a second striker. Despite primarily being a creative player, who was renowned for his passing, vision, and playmaking ability, Ronaldinho was an accurate finisher with either foot, both from inside and outside the penalty area, as well as being a free-kick and penalty kick specialist. Although he was primarily known for his ability to bend the ball from set pieces, he was also capable of striking the ball with power underneath the wall, and also occasionally used the knuckleball technique, which was popularised by his compatriot Juninho Pernambucano. His versatility and prowess from set pieces made him one of the most prolific free kick takers in history, and also influenced his former teammate Messi, who went on to become a free kick specialist himself. Throughout his career, Ronaldinho was praised by pundits in particular for his technical skills, flair, and creativity, as well as his exceptional first touch. With his pace, acceleration, athleticism, balance, ball control, and dribbling ability, he was capable of beating players when undertaking individual runs, often using an array of tricks and feints to get past opponents in one on one situations, including step overs and nutmegs. Physically strong in possession of the ball, Richard Williams writes \"slender in build, the Brazilian has a strength belying the cartoonish smile\". He also incorporated flashy moves such as back\u2013heels, bicycle kicks, and no\u2013look passes into his general gameplay. Among his repertoire of moves, is the \"elastico\", a move he learned by watching videos of one of his idols, the 1970s Brazilian star Rivelino.\"Football's Greatest \u2013 Rivelino\".

ESPN described Ronaldinho as being \"skillful by nature, his tricks are unparalleled and he is wonderful with the ball at his feet. One of the coolest players in pressure situations\" and a \"fast, brash, skilful, tricky, an uninhibited playmaker\" who provides \"a mix of goals, assists, skills and a large repertoire of crafty moves\". Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107 stated, \"Prime Ronaldinho was phenomenal. He made his opponents look like children\". Former Portugal midfield playmaker Rui Costa has said of his vision and passing ability: \"There are not many players who can offer goal-scoring passes like he can. He is just marvellous. He is a rare case of an assist man who can provide the ball from anywhere.\" In 2010, his former Barcelona teammate, Edgar Davids, said of him: \"For the skills and tricks, Ronaldinho was the best player that I ever played with.\" Another one of his former Barcelona teammate, Henrik Larsson, echoed this view. His compatriot Willian rated him as the greatest player of all time in 2019, while Juninho described him as the most skilful player he had ever seen. In 2019, FourFourTwo described him as \"possibly the best technician in the history of football in Brazil,\" placing him at number five in their list of \"The 101 greatest football players of the last 25 years.\" In 2006, Richard Williams of The Guardian described Ronaldinho as a \"genius,\" while his former Barcelona teammate Sylvinho said of him: \"He's so smart, so intelligent, that sometimes it's difficult to read his mind,\" also adding: \"He's amazing. He's 100% talent. And he's a powerful player as well, so it's difficult to stop him.\" In spite of his performances at his peak, a period of dedication and focus which saw him named the FIFA World Player of the Year twice and receive the Ballon d'Or, Ronaldinho was also criticised on occasion in the media for his lack of discipline in training, as well as his hedonistic lifestyle off the pitch, which some pundits believed had an impact on the overall longevity of his career. Referring to Ronaldinho as \"Brazil's childlike genius who never grew up\", Tim Vickery writes that it was the sudden death of his father at such a young age that may have seen Ronaldinho stop making the sacrifices needed to remain at the summit of the sport, with the attitude of \"life is short and can end unexpectedly\u2013so enjoy it while you can.\" ==Outside football== Ronaldinho (pictured with Barcelona in 2007) has been a UNICEF ambassador since February 2006.
