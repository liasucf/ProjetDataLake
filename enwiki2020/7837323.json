    "text": "The Nun and the Devil, or Le Monache di Sant'Arcangelo in the original Italian, is an erotic 1973 -Italian nunsploitation film directed by Domenico Paolella. It is also known as: Sisters of Satan (UK) and The Nuns of Saint Archangel (US). The action is set in the 16th century at the convent of Sant Arcangelo, near Naples, then under Spanish rule. The success of the film resulted in another period drama/nunsploitation film by Paolella released the same year, Story of a Cloistered Nun, an Italian/French/West German co- production starring Eleonora Giorgi. The opening credits state that the movie is \"Based on authentic 16th Century records and a story by Stendhal\"\u2014possibly Stendhal's L'Abbesse de Castro (1832) is meant. == Plot == The story involves the power struggles and sexual intrigues of a group of good-looking nuns at the Sant Arcangelo Convent and in particular the machinations of Sister Julia (played by former Miss Great Britain Anne Heywood) as she attempts, by any means possible, to succeed to the position of the dying Mother Superior. The nuns struggle with their vows of celibacy, some inclining to lesbianism whilst others invite male lovers secretly into their cells. Meanwhile, a corrupt church hopes to benefit from an aristocratic donation to the Convent, before launching an inquisition into the lubricious and corrupt activities of the inmates of the Convent. There then follow graphic scenes of torture as miscreant nuns are stripped naked and tortured with a variety of devices in order to elicit a confession of their misdemeanours. The film ends with a resonant condemnation of the power hungry and corrupt church by Sister Julia after she has been found guilty and compelled to take poison to end her life. == Cast == * Anne Heywood: Sister Julia * Luc Merenda: vicar Carafa * Ornella Muti: Sister Isabella * Pier Paolo Capponi: Don Carlos Ribera * Martine Brochard: Sister Chiara * Claudia Gravi: Sister Carmela * Maria Cumani Quasimodo: Sister Lavinia * Claudio Gora: Cardinal d'Arezzo * Duilio Del Prete: Pietro == In popular culture == The electro-industrial band My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult has sampled the English-language dub of the film extensively in songs such as \"And This Is What the Devil Does\" and \"Kooler Than Jesus\". == References == ==External links== * Category:1973 films Category:1973 drama films Category:Films set in the 16th century Category:French films Category:Italian films Category:Italian-language films Category:Nunsploitation films Category:Films set in Naples Category:Films based on actual events Category:Films directed by Domenico Paolella Category:French LGBT-related films Category:Italian LGBT-related films Category:1973 LGBT-related films Category:LGBT-related drama films Category:Films scored by Piero Piccioni ",
