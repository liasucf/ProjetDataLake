    "text": "Brachybacterium muris is a species of Gram positive, strictly aerobic, yellow- pigmented bacterium. The cells are coccoid during the stationary phase, and irregular rods during the exponential phase. It was first isolated from the liver of a laboratory mouse. The species was first described in 2003, and the name is derived from the Latin muris (mouse). The optimum growth temperature for B. muris is 25-37 \u00b0C. It can grow in the 15-42 \u00b0C range and in pH 6.0-9.0. ==References== == External links == *Type strain of Brachybacterium muris at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Gram-positive bacteria Category:Bacteria described in 2003 ",
