    "text": "No Plan is an extended play, comprising songs written and recorded by English musician David Bowie, released posthumously on 8 January 2017. The release coincided with what would have been Bowie's 70th birthday, almost a year after his death. No Plan compiles the original songs written for Bowie's Off- Broadway musical, Lazarus, including the titular \"Lazarus\", \"No Plan\", \"Killing a Little Time\", and \"When I Met You\". The songs were first recorded by the cast of the musical as part of its official soundtrack. The recordings featured on No Plan come from the sessions for Bowie's twenty-fifth and final studio album Blackstar, with \"Lazarus\" appearing as the third track on the album. Upon release, No Plan debuted at #138 on the Billboard 200, selling more than 5,000 units in its first week there. The music video for the title track was also released in accompaniment with the EP. It was directed by Tom Hingston. ==Critical reception== The EP received positive reviews from music critics. Exclaim! critic Calum Slingerland wrote: \"One would hope the plan for Bowie going forward would be for him to avoid falling into the category of \"rock icon with innumerable posthumous releases,\" but thankfully for listeners, the music on No Plan holds up.\" The Independents Andy Gill stated: \"Blackstar\u2019s moods and musical modes are continued through these tracks, in which Thomas Jerome Newton's decline eerily reflects Bowie's own.\" AllMusic senior critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine thought that the tracks on the EP \"provide a bittersweet coda to Bowie's 21st century comeback\", even if \"these songs don't feel like a surprise\". Alfred Soto of Spin stated: \"Presenting listeners with two discrete but related musical adventures like \u2605 and No Plan, the survivors grasped that even the oblique tastes better with a dash of the obvious.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Personnel Adapted from No Plan liner notes. ;Musicians *David Bowie \u2013 vocals, acoustic & Fender guitars *Donny McCaslin \u2013 saxophone, flute & woodwinds *Jason Lindner \u2013 piano, Wurlitzer organ & keyboards *Tim Lefebvre \u2013 bass *Mark Guiliana \u2013 drums & percussion *Ben Monder \u2013 guitar ;Production *David Bowie \u2013 production, mixing *Tony Visconti \u2013 production, mixing, engineering *Tom Elmhirst \u2013 final master mix *Joe LaPorta \u2013 mastering *Kevin Killen \u2013 engineering *Kabir Hermon \u2013 engineering assistance *Erin Tonkon \u2013 engineering assistance *Joe Visciano \u2013 assistant to Tom Elmhirst ;Design *Barnbrook \u2013 cover design *DSS \u2013 front cover star image *Jimmy King \u2013 Bowie image ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Mexico Ingles Airplay (Billboard) |align=\"center\"| 24 |- |- |UK Official Charts Singles |92 |- |- |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year- End Charts (2017) !Position |- |UK Official Chart Singles (Vinyl) |1 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 EPs Category:David Bowie EPs Category:EPs published posthumously Category:Columbia Records EPs Category:Sony Records albums Category:Albums produced by Tony Visconti Category:Albums produced by David Bowie ",
