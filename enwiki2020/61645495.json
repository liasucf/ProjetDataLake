    "text": "Luigi Bazzani, also called Il Bazzanetto, was an Italian painter, illustrator, and watercolorist. He was born November 8, 1836 in Bologna, Italy. Bazzani studied at Bologna's Accademia di Belle Arti then traveled to France, Germany and, eventually, Rome where he settled down in 1861 and began to specialize in genre and landscape subjects as well as set designs for theaters.Luigi Bazzani, A Pompeian Interior, 1882 Dahesh Museum of Art, retrieved 8/22/2019. Many of his paintings featured the remains of the city's monuments from classical antiquity.The Pompeii of the late nineteenth century in the painting of Luigi Bazzani retrieved 8/22/2019. ==Documentation of Pompeii excavations== Inspired by the rediscovery of Pompeii in 1748, he spent 35 years of his life from approximately 1880 to 1915 documenting the ruins of the ancient city that had been exposed by ongoing excavations with watercolor paintings. Bazzani experimented with the techniques of architectural relief, an aspect so far little known but of great interest for archaeological research and his attention to detail was prized by scientists working at the site. His often exquisitely muted colors and his superb technical skill enabled him to replicate antique stone, whether chipped facing or other decaying aspects of it.Luigi Bazzani, Old Master Drawings and Sketches, retrieved 9/1/2019. At the time of Bazzani's work in Pompeii, the freshly excavated remains were still vibrant with original paint. He contributed a series of fourteen illustrations to a publication by Pompeii's leading archaeologist Amedeo Maiuri.Luigi Bazzani, Pompeiian Interior, 1875 St. Johnsbury Athenaeum retrieved 8/22/2019. Since then, however, many interiors have been lost to deterioration. So his work has been a valuable resource for modern archaeologists and scholars as well.Browsing Historical Pompeian watercolours through a Google Earth-based meta interface: Luigi Bazzani's Exhibition by A. Coralini, A. Guidazzoli, Mc.C. Ligouri, A. Baglivo and M. Spigarolo Retrieved 8/22/2019. ==Exhibitions== Beginning in 1895, Bazzani exhibited regularly in Rome, Vienna, Munich, Berlin, and Paris. He also taught perspective and set design at the Academia di Belle Arti in Rome from 1892 to 1896 with Ludovico Zeit and had prize-winning artist Luigi Savoldi as a pupil.Pietro Moscow: Art and costume in Bergamo Nineteenth-twentieth century, p. 954, Graphic and Art Editions, Bergamo , 1990 Eventually, Bazzani became a member of academies in Rome, Bologna, and Perugia. In 2013, the exhibition \"Really! The Pompeii of the late 1800s in the painting of Luigi Bazzani\" was presented by The Fondazione del Monte di Bologna, in collaboration with the University of Bologna (Department of History, Civilization Cultures, Section of Archeology). It included a multimedia application developed by the Italian consortium of universities and research centers known as Cineca that integrated images of Bazzani's watercolors into their appropriate locations in Pompeii's archaeological structures as viewed through Google Earth. ==Gallery== ===Pompeii watercolors (See more by clicking on the Wikimedia Commons link)=== File:Summer Triclinius of House V, 2, 15 at Pompeii 1914 by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Summer Triclinium of House V, 2, 15, 1914 File:Pompeii Bath watercolor by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Pompeii Bath File:Lararium of the House of Dioscuri at Pompeii, 1902 by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Lararium of the House of Dioscuri, 1902 File:House of the Great Fountain in Pompeii by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|House of the Great Fountain File:Atrium of the House of the Centenary at Pompeii, 1901.jpg|Atrium of the House of the Centenary, 1901 File:Pompeii Fountain watercolor by Luigi Bazzani (before 1927).jpg|Peristyle with fountain in the House of Marcus Lucretius File:Luigi Bazzani - Blick in ein Atriumhaus.jpg|Peristyle with fountain in the House of Marcus Lucretius (Detail) File:Pompeii interior watercolor by Luigi Bazzani (before 1927).jpg|Pompeii Interior File:Pompeii theater watercolor by Luigi Bazzani (before 1927).jpg|Pompeii theater File:Lararium of the House IX,1,7, Pompeii,1903 (watercolor).jpg|Lararium of the House IX,1,7, Pompeii,1903 File:Nymphaeum at the House of the Bull in Pompeii by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Nymphaeum at the House of the Bull, 1901 File:Atrium of the House of the Mariner by Luigi Bazzani before 1927.jpg|Atrium of the House of the Mariner File:House of the Vetti by Luigi Bazzani (watercolor) before 1927.jpg|House of the Vetti File:House of the Small Fountain in Pompeii by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|House of the Small Fountain File:House with impluvium and marble table in Pompeii by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|House with impluvium and marble table File:Insula in Region IX, V, 18 by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Insula in Region IX, V, 18 File:Temple of Isis by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Temple of Isis File:Thermopolion in the alley of the rooster in Pompeii by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Thermopolion (fast food stall) in the alley of the rooster File:Fountain with head of Mercury on Mercury Street in Pompeii by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Fountain with head of Mercury on Mercury Street File:House of the Hanging Balcony in Pompeii by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|House of the Hanging Balcony File:Portal of a patrician house on Augustus Street in Pompeii by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Portal of a patrician house on Augustus Street File:Tomb in the necropolis of Pompeii by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Tomb in the necropolis File:Tomb with covered niche and planter with garland in Pompeii necropolis by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Tomb with covered niche and planter with garland File:Lararium in the House of L Caecilius Jucundus Pompeii by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Lararium in the House of L Caecilius Jucundus File:Atrium in Pompeii by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Pompeii Atrium File:Arches of Nero in the Forum in Pompeii watercolor by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Arches of Nero in the Forum File:Pompeian red interior watercolor by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Pompeian red interior File:The Genaeceum (Women's Quarters) of the House of Sallust (VI 2, 4) in Pompei watercolor by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|The Genaeceum (Women's Quarters) of the House of Sallust (VI 2, 4) File:Thermopolium in the Alley of the Pharmacist in Pompeii watercolor by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Thermopolium in the Alley of the Pharmacist File:Atrium of the House of the Ancient Hunt in Pompeii watercolor by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Atrium of the House of the Ancient Hunt File:Atrium of the House of the Ancient Hunt (Detail) in Pompeii watercolor by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Atrium of the House of the Ancient Hunt (Detail) File:Atrium in Pompeii watercolor by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Atrium of the House of the Ancient Hunt in Pompeii File:Atrium of the House of the Vetti VI 15 1 in Pompeii, 1895 by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Atrium of the House of the Vetti VI.15.1 File:Entry to a Roman domus watercolor by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Entry to a Roman domus File:Atrium of the House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii watercolor by Luigi Bazzani.jpg|Atrium of the House of the Prince of Naples File:Fountain of the House of C.
