This is the last album released while the duo were still together. The material spans 15 years, from their first hit single, \"A Fool In Love\" in 1960 up until their last \"Baby, Get It On\" in 1975. The album peaked at No. 71 in Australia. == Critical reception == Billboard (March 6, 1976): > Collection of hits from the earliest days to more recent material makes up > set that should pull in pop, soul and disco play. Good indication of the > role the pair have played in the evolution of rock. Early hits were often > recut by English groups, and later hits were often covers of white versions > of the same songs. Interesting thing was the way Ike & Tina rearranged > material to suit themselves and often became identified with the rearranged > versions. == Track listing == == Chart performance == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Chart (1976) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | align=\"center\" |71 |} == References == Category:1976 greatest hits albums Category:Ike & Tina Turner compilation albums Category:Albums produced by Ike Turner Category:United Artists Records compilation albums ",
