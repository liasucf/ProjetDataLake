    "text": "The Illuy or Iluy (Hebrew: ) is a Trope (from Yiddish \u05d8\u05e8\u05d0\u05b8\u05e4\u05bc \"trop\") in the Judaic Liturgy. It is one of the cantillation marks used in the three poetic books: Job, the Book of Proverbs, and the Psalms. Accordingly, it is a special mark belonging to the Ta'amei Sifrei Emet (meaning, the accent signs of the books of truth). == Symbol == The symbol of Illuy ( ) is the same as that of Munach ( ), except that the Illuy is positioned above the Hebrew letter, while the Munach is positioned below it. In the Yemeni tradition the Illuy is also called the \"Shofar illuy\" . However, \"Shofar illuy\" means Munach in the Italian tradition. == Description == The Hebrew word is a derivative of the word (meaning \"upper\" or \"top\"), hence its position above the letter. == Occurrences == The Trope Illuy occurs in only three books. {| class=\"wikitable\" !
