    "text": "The Fussball Club Basel 1893 1987\u201388 season was their 94th season since the club's foundation. It was their 42nd consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football (Nationalliga A) since they achieved promotion in the 1945\u201346 season. FC Basel played their home games in the St. Jakob Stadium. Charles R\u00f6thlisberger was the club's newly appointed chairman. He was the club's 31st chairman in their history. ==Overview== Urs Siegenthaler was appointed as first team coach, he replaced Helmut Benthaus who had retired at the end of the previous season. They started the season badly, losing the first five league games, conceding 17 goals, scoring just three. The team never recovered from the bad start and ended the qualifying stage of the championship with just 13 points. This meant that they had to play in one of the two Promotion/Relegation groups. Despite a good start in this phase, they won their first three matches, they soon lost contact to the two top positions, which would have kept them in the top flight. In their last six games the team could not achieve a win and therefore they slipped down the table and were relegated to the Nationalliga B. In the Swiss Cup, in round of 64, Basel were drawn against local rivals Old Boys. The game ended with a 1\u20132 defeat and therefore the cup season was ended much earlier than expected. == Players == == Results == === Nationalliga A === ====First stage==== ==== League table ==== ==== Second stage ==== ;Promotion/Relegation Group A ==== League table ==== ===Swiss Cup=== ==See also== * History of FC Basel * List of FC Basel players * List of FC Basel seasons ==Sources and references== * Rotblau: Jahrbuch Saison 2015/2016.
