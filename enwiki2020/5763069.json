The tower is located on a relatively high spot just off Georgia Avenue NW, in Washington's Brightwood neighborhood, several miles from the city's main cluster of transmission towers in the Tenleytown neighborhood. Except for the 504-foot towerhttps://www.fccinfo.com/CMDProASRLookup.php?sASR=1036577&tabSearchType;=ASR+Search next to it, there are no nearby large structures. For these reasons, as well as its distinctive shape and large size, the tower is prominently visible from a variety of locations in the District of Columbia and suburban Maryland. The tower is owned by the District of Columbia Department of General Services, Portfolio Division. It is used for radio communication by the Washington, D.C. police and fire departments. Until 2017, it broadcast the WDCW Channel 50 television signal. The three-legged, free-standing star tower shares its design with the Star Tower in Cincinnati, Ohio. It was designed by Texas engineer Henry \u201cHank\u201d McGinnis, who worked in the Landmark or Adelphon style. It was built by the Landmark Tower Company and named for John S. Hughes, who as an Assistant D.C. Police Chief had led the department's adoption of communications technology. The tower has ten daytime strobe beacons on the tower's legs: one beacon per plus one at the top of the WDCW antenna. The beacons flash at 1.5-second intervals. It also has nighttime red warning navigation lights. The design includes an ichthys, or Jesus fish, developed from early sketches of the structure. In 1998, the National Capital Planning Commission approved a plan to use the Hughes Memorial Tower as part of a 9-1-1 service upgrade. In doing so, it noted that the tower was constructed without its prior permission and that it has caused \"concern about the effect of the tower on the views of the major monuments and memorials in the Nation's Capital.\" The tower has also been criticized by Ward 4 residents because the police \"frequently have to close the streets next to this tower because of the risk[s] posed by falling ice\" in winter. ==See Also== * Lattice tower * Landmark Tower Company * List of tallest buildings in Washington, D.C. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Radio masts and towers in the United States Category:Towers completed in 1989 Category:Towers in Washington, D.C.
