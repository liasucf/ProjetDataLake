    "text": "The front entrance of CCDC headquarters in Cambridge, UK The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) is a crystallographic organisation based in Cambridge, England. It is a non-profit charity whose primary role is the compilation and maintenance of the Cambridge Structural Database, a database of small molecule crystal structures. They also perform analysis on the database for the benefit of the scientific community, and write and distribute computer software to allow others to do the same. == History == In 1962, Dr. Olga Kennard OBE FRS set up a chemical crystallography group within the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge. In 1965 she founded the CCDC and established the associated Cambridge Structural Database. At that time, there were only about 3,000 published X-ray structures of organic molecules and the work involved converting these into a machine-readable form. In 1992, the CCDC moved into its own building adjacent to the Cambridge chemistry department. This new headquarters was designed by the Danish architect Professor Erik Christian S\u00f8rensen and won The Sunday Times Building of the Year Award in 1993. The CCDC still retains very close links as a University Partner Institution that trains students for postgraduate research degrees but from 1987 became an independent company. == Current research == The staff at the CCDC curate the database of small-molecule organic and metal-organic crystal structures and make these available for download by the public. They also create and maintain a suite of cheminformatics software that may be used to apply the data to applications in the life sciences, including crystal engineering and materials science. === Programs Developed === CCDC developed programs such as ConQuest and Mercury that run under Windows and various types of Unix, including Linux. ConQuest is a search interface to the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Mercury is crystal structure visualizer tool and versions of Mercury released in 2015 and later provide the functionality to generate 3D print. == See also == * List of chemical databases == References == ==External links== * The Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre Category:Crystallography organizations Category:Partner institutions of the University of Cambridge ",
