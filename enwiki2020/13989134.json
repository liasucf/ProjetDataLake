    "text": "Cellach Cualann mac Gerthidi (died 715) was the last U\u00ed M\u00e1il king of Leinster. Cellach's byname is derived from the land of Cualu which lay around Glendalough. The name U\u00ed M\u00e1il may mean \"grandsons of the princes\". This, along with their ownership of certain objects symbolic of the kingship of Leinster, has suggested that they may once have been considered the rightful rulers of Leinster, at least by themselves. Alternatively, U\u00ed M\u00e1il may have derived their name from the Glen of Imaal, in the west of modern County Wicklow, which lay in the centre of their historic lands. Cellach's father was not king of Leinster, but his second cousin Fiannamail mac M\u00e1ele Tuile (died 680) was. Cellach succeeded his cousin as king of U\u00ed M\u00e1il when Fiannamail was murdered by a servant named Fochsech\u00e1n, probably on the orders of F\u00ednsnechta Fledach.Annals of Tigernach AT 680.3 The kingship of Leinster passed to the U\u00ed D\u00fanlainge in the person of Bran Mut mac Conaill who died in 693, to be followed as king by Cellach. ==Reign== Immediately after the death of Bran Mut a battle between the Leinstermen and their western neighbours the kingdom of Osraige is recorded, but Cellach is not associated with this.Annals of Ulster AU 693.4 Cellach was one of the guarantors of the C\u00e1in Adomn\u00e1in (Law of Adomn\u00e1n) in 697 promulgated at the Synod of Birr. In 704 he warred with his northern neighbours, the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill of Clann Cholm\u00e1in, led by Bodbchath mac Diarmata D\u00e9in, and of S\u00edl n\u00c1edo Sl\u00e1ine, led by Fogartach mac N\u00e9ill. The Battle of Claenath, fought near Clane in modern County Kildare, was a victory for Cellach, with Bodbchath killed and Fogartach fled.Annals of Ulster AU 704.4 In 707 the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill High King of Ireland Congal Cennmagair campaigned in Leinster and obtained Cellach's submission to his authority.Annals of Ulster AU 707.7 In 709, aided by British allies--usually presumed to be mercenaries, exiled members of the warbands of the British kingdoms conquered by expansionist Northumbria--he fought a battle at Serg where his sons Fiachra and Fiannamail were killed. Serg is unidentified, Whitley Stokes translates it as \"the battle of the Hunt\". The Annals of Tigernach locate it somewhere in the fortuatha of Leinster, that part of the province east of the Wicklow Mountains.Annals of Tigernach AT 709.2 His adversaries are not named. Cellach's death in 715 is reported without comment by the Irish annals. ==Family== His first wife was Mugain ingen Failbe of U\u00ed Bairrche. Their daughter Conchenn (died 743) married Murchad mac Brain Mut (died 727), his successor as king of Leinster. Mugain was also the mother of his sons Fiachra and Fianamail slain in 709. Cellach's wife B\u00e9 F\u00e1il, the third of four, was the daughter of Sechnassach, the High King of Ireland. Several of his sons died in his lifetime. His daughters married well. Muirenn (died 748) was the mother of High King Cin\u00e1ed mac \u00cdrgalaig and perhaps of Cin\u00e1ed's successor Flaithbertach mac Loingsig by a second marriage. Derbforgaill, wife of F\u00ednsnechta Fledach, was probably Cellach's daughter. His daughter Caintigern (Saint Kentigerna) was by his fourth wife, also Caintigern, daughter of Conaing Cuirre of the S\u00edl n\u00c1edo Sl\u00e1ine. Of Cellach's surviving sons, \u00c1ed was killed in 719 near Fennor, County Kildare, Crimthann died in battle, \"at an immature age\" according to the Annals of Ulster in 726, and Etersc\u00e9l in 727 fighting against F\u00e1el\u00e1n mac Murchado. His two grandsons Cathal and Ailill were slain in 744. ==Notes== ==References== * * Byrne, Francis John, Irish Kings and High-Kings.
