The Foundation is based in the Salamanca district of central Madrid. CEACS offered master's degrees in social science for Spanish students as well as a programme of four-year grants for students to undertake a master's and write a doctoral thesis. In 2007, CEACS decided to focus on postdoctoral research as well, and it offered a three-year research grant to top professors worldwide. In September 2013, the Juan March Foundation and the Carlos III University decided to jointly support CEACS, and turned CEACS into the Instituto Carlos III-Juan March (IC3JM), and relocated the campus from Salamanca in central Madrid to Getafe; the academic staff, activities, programmes, and library of the former CEACS were absorbed by IC3JM. The two organizations collaborated to found the institute in its current incarnation; it is located on Carlos III University campus but both organizations contribute funding. Ignacio S\u00e1nchez-Cuenca has served as IC3JM's Director since its inception in 2013. ==Academic focus== The Instituto Juan March de Estudios e Investigaciones is devoted to research in social science with a focus on political economy, voting and party competition.Juan March Institute website.
