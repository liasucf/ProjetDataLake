Woody then emerges from the ball, takes a mallet and putters the ball of cement into the man's face. The man is now trapped in the wet cement. Woody then skates back over to the man and hits repeatedly hits him with a shovel. Woody then tries to run the man over with a steamroller. The man runs in fear from the crazy woodpecker and is chased out of the cement. He chased into the construction office and hides, only to open the door and get rundown. The man is completely flat and Woody rolls him up. He then takes him over to an advertisement for the gym with a picture of a fat woman on a billboard and pastes him on there like sticker, making fun of his weight. The man emerges from the billboard, but with the backside of the fat woman. The man tries to grab Woody's golf club, only to be accidentally knocked underground. Woody discovers the ball in the man's mouth. He putters it anyway and sends the man's dentures flying. The man chases Woody up a ladder, but is hit in the head by Woody with a mallet. The guy falls down and Woody drops a barrel on the man. He replaces Woody's golf ball with a bomb that looks the same as one and blows up both of the characters.

He is chased down by the man. == References == Category:1945 animated films Category:Walter Lantz Productions shorts Category:Woody Woodpecker films Category:1940s American animated films Category:Universal Pictures short films Category:Universal Pictures animated short films Category:Golf animation Category:Animated films about animals Category:Animated films about birds Category:1945 films Category:American animated short films Category:American films ",
