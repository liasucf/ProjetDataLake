    "text": "Jacques Bergerac as Pepe Dauphin Thunder in the Sun is a 1959 western film directed by Russell Rouse and starring Susan Hayward and Jeff Chandler. ==Plot== The film shows a family of French Basque immigrants pioneering into the Wild West while carrying their ancestral vines. Hard drinking trail driver Lon Bennett is hired to lead them and he falls for the spirited Gabrielle Dauphin. The film is infamous among Basques for its misunderstandings of Basque customs, such as the use of the xistera (a device of the jai alai sport) as a weapon or shouting irrintzi ululations as meaningful communication. Other commentators, though, have noted the well staged action scenes, the absorbing story, and the excellent cinematography. Which is a marvel since 90% of the lead actors scenes were shot in a studio with projected backgrounds. ==Cast== *Susan Hayward as Gabrielle Dauphin *Jeff Chandler as Lon Bennett *Jacques Bergerac as Pepe Dauphin *Blanche Yurka as Louise Dauphin *Carl Esmond as Andre Dauphin *Fortunio Bonanova as Fernando Christophe *Bertrand Castelli as Edmond Duquette *Albert Carrier *Felix Locher as Danielle *Michele Marly *Albert Villasainte *Veda Ann Borg as Marie ==Production== The film was made by Seven Arts Productions and acquired by Paramount for distribution.
