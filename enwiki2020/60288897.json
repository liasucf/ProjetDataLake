She worked as a scenarist at Famous Players-Lasky before writing scripts for Chadwick Pictures. In 1929, she was hired to write a series of 12 two-reel stories featuring actor George McIntosh. A devout Catholic, she eventually became disenchanted with Hollywood and what she perceived as its moral failings, and became a contributing editor at The Victorian (a Catholic magazine) and The Catholic Boy during the 1940s and 1950s, where she covered topics like juvenile delinquency, the ills of marijuana, the perils of alcohol, and Communism. == Selected filmography == * Blondes by Choice (1927) * The Love Wager (1927) * Sunshine of Paradise Alley (1926) * Friendly Enemies (1925) * Bluff (1924) * Daughters of the Rich (1923) * Lovebound (1923) * A Question of Honor (1922) * Her Mad Bargain (1921) == References == Category:American women screenwriters Category:American women film producers Category:American film producers Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Screenwriters from New York (state) Category:Writers from New York City Category:Film producers from New York (state) Category:American people of Irish descent Category:20th-century American writers Category:20th-century American women writers ",
