In 1994, he earned a Master of Education degree from the University of Minnesota.

He subsequently ran for and was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives in the August 7, 2007 special election held after Rep. Steve Sviggum resigned to become Minnesota's Commissioner of Labor and Industry. He was re-elected in 2008, 2010, and 2012. In May 2010, Drazokowski introduced legislation in the Minnesota House modeled after Arizona's controversial immigration law.Hoppin, Jason. Potent reaction to Minnesota immigration bill. St. Paul Pioneer Press. May 7, 2010. In 2012, Drazkowski and radio host Dave Thompson proposed an Employee Freedom Constitutional Amendment which would require a statewide referendum on amending the Minnesota Constitution to include a right-to-work clause weakening unions. In early 2019, Drazkowski referred Ilhan Omar, who currently serves as the representative of Minnesota's 5th congressional district, to the Minnesota Campaign Finance and Public Disclosure Board. The Board enforces Minnesota election ethics rules. On December 7, 2018, Drazkowski along with three other Republican members of the Minnesota House left the GOP House Caucus in order to form the New Republican House Caucus.https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2018/12/renegade-house-members- split-from-gop-caucus/ Drazkowski said \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change the fact we\u2019re still Republican. As a matter of fact, our caucus of four is very committed to Republican ideals and values,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be working very hard to strengthen our party throughout Minnesota, strengthen party units and conservative organizations throughout the state so that we can win the election in two years instead of continuing on a course that could be very similar to the one (in November\u2019s election) that really just took 25 percent of our Republican membership in the House.\u201d The four members were assigned seats together on the house floor and hired three staff members shortly before the 2019 session began. During the session, they announced several bills that featured their strong interest in constitutional issues and also presented their own budget proposal.https://www.newhousegop.com ==Electoral history== *2018 Race for Minnesota House of Representatives \u2014 District 21B **Steve Drazkowski (R) 63.4% (11,511 votes) **Jonathan Isenor (DFL), 36.5% (6,619 votes) **Write-in, 0.1% (17 votes) *2016 Race for Minnesota House of Representatives \u2014 District 21B **Steve Drazkowski (R) 65.31% (13,688 votes) **Elise Diesslin (DFL), 34.69% (7,270 votes) *2014 Race for Minnesota House of Representatives \u2014 District 21B **Steve Drazkowski (R) 63.3% (9,075 votes) **M.A. Schneider (DFL), 36.4% (5,213 votes) **Write-in, 0.3% (41 votes) *2012 Race for Minnesota House of Representatives \u2014 District 21B **Steve Drazkowski (R) 58% (11,759 votes) **Bruce Montplaisir (DFL), 42% (8,511 votes) *2010 Race for Minnesota House of Representatives \u2014 District 28B **Steve Drazkowski (R) 65.15% (9,669 votes) **Mark Schneider (DFL), 34.77% (5,160 votes) **Write-in, 0.08% (12 votes) *2008 Race for Minnesota House of Representatives \u2014 District 28B **Steve Drazkowski (R) 54.75% (10,980 votes) **Linda Pfeilsticker (DFL), 45.13% (9,050 votes) **Write-in, 0.12% (24 votes) *2007 Race for Minnesota House of Representatives \u2014 District 28B Special Election **Steve Drazkowski (R) 52.89% (3,762 votes) **Linda Pfeilsticker (DFL), 46.86% (3,333 votes) **Write-in, 0.25% (18 votes) *2006 Race for Minnesota Senate \u2014 District 28 **Steve Murphy (DFL), 54.26% (17,511 votes) **Steve Drazkowski(R), 45.33% (14,627 votes) **Steve Wilson (Write-In), 0.20% (64 votes) **Write-In 0.21% (68 votes) ==Personal life== Steve is a member of the National Rifle Association, Whitetails Unlimited, Ducks Unlimited, and both the Lake City and Frontenac Sportsmens Clubs.
