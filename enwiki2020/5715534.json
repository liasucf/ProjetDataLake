    "text": "Close Enough for Love is a 1979 studio album by jazz singer Peggy Lee. The album was Lee's first recording in the United States since her 1975 album Mirrors. The album was Lee's only recording for DRG Records, and featured Lee with her regular quartet. ==Reception== Reviewing the album for AllMusic, JT Griffith said that \"Peggy Lee's voice sounds a bit depressed on this album, indicating, perhaps, an unfamiliarity with the new musical trappings. But that quality also gives the album's more straightforward numbers, like \"Rain Sometimes\" and \"Come in From the Rain\" (sounding like Wings), a moving, somber tone. An example of a dated album, but one that is a ripe for a rediscovery.\" ==Track listing== # \"You\" (Tom Snow) \u2013 4:04 # \"Easy Does It\" (Richard P.
