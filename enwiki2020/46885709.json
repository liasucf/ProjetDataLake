C\u00e9line \u00c9milie Seurre, known as C\u00e9cile Sorel or the Comtesse de S\u00e9gur, by marriage (7 September 1873 in Paris \u2013 3 September 1966 in Trouville-sur-Mer) was a French comic actress. She enjoyed great popularity and was known for her extravagant costumes. ==Biography== Sorel was attracted to the theater at an early age, studying with Louis-Ars\u00e8ne Delaunay and Marie Favart. In 1899, she began her career at the Od\u00e9on and then, in 1901, became a member of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, where she specialized in playing a stock character known as the \"grande coquette\". She was especially well known for her portrayal of C\u00e9lim\u00e8ne in The Misanthrope. In 1904, she became the 339th \"Soci\u00e9taire de la Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\" and remained with the theater until 1933. Although long engaged to Whitney Warren, an American architect who was related to the Vanderbilts, she eventually married the Comte de S\u00e9gur-Lamoignon, great grandson of the famous Comtesse de S\u00e9gur, who acted under the name Guillaume de Sax. They were sometimes mocked as \"beauty and the beast\" and were separated after fifteen years, but she kept the title of \"Comtesse\" for the rest of her life. Cecile Sorel by Fran\u00e7ois Flameng c. 1903 In 1909, she had the starring role in La Tosca, a film by Andr\u00e9 Calmettes and Charles Le Bargy. Her next film role did not come until 1937, when she played an aged courtesan in Pearls of the Crown by Sacha Guitry. Four years later, she essentially played herself in a sketch comedy called Les Petits riens, written by and starring Yves Mirande. In 1944, she barely escaped the bombing that destroyed the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais in Rouen. In 1950, she underwent a \"conversion\" and, following the lead of the original Comtesse de S\u00e9gur, took her vows as a Third-order Franciscan. She adopted the name \"Soeur C\u00e9cile de l'Enfant-J\u00e9sus\" and devoted her time to writing. A television documentary of her career was produced in 1965. She died of complications from a fractured hip, suffered in a fall at her rented ch\u00e2teau on the French coast, and was buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse. She was painted by Fran\u00e7ois Flameng and her likeness appears in a fresco by Charles Hoffbauer on the ceiling of the cupola at the Ch\u00e2teau d'Artigny in Montbazon, once owned by Fran\u00e7ois Coty. A college in the town of M\u00e9riel is named after her. ==References== == Further reading == * C\u00e9cile Sorel: An Autobiography (\"Les Belles Heures de Ma Vie\") translated by Philip John Stead, Staples Press, 1953.
