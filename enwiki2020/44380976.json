He observed that the number of consumers researching real estate was growing rapidly, yet all the major websites in the category were not focused on delivering a compelling consumer experience. These websites also failed to provide compelling advertising products because they did not tap into the billions of dollars being spent on advertising in the real-estate newspaper classifieds. Flint wrote the original business plan while at Stanford. Flint recruited a team of Stanford students to turn Flint's concept into a company. Of the original students that worked on the project, Sami Inkinen joined Flint to incorporate the company in June 2005. Flint scaled Trulia to become one of the leading online real estate companies in the US. He raised $33 million in Venture Capital from Accel Partners and Sequoia Capital, and took the company public with an IPO on the NYSE in September 2012. In 2014 Trulia merged with Zillow in a $3.5 billion acquisition to create the world's largest real estate company. ==Investor== Flint has been an active angel investor and advisor to consumer Internet and network effect businesses. In December 2016 it was announced that he joined NFX as a managing partner.
