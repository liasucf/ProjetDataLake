    "text": "The Society of Swedish Literature in Finland (Svenska litteraturs\u00e4llskapet i Finland r.f., abbr. SLS) is a scholarly society for the collection, archiving and dissemination of knowledge about Finland-Swedish culture. SLS publishes scholarly literature, maintains archives and libraries, funds research and awards literary and scholarly prizes and scholarships. SLS\u2019s activity is made possible by private donations. SLS is one of the largest managers of private charitable funds in Finland. SLS was established in 1885 in memory of the Finnish national poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg, during a time when it was felt that the Swedish language and Swedish culture in Finland were under threat from the Finnish side. Leading cultural figures endorsed the need for an organization to preserve and mediate the Swedish cultural heritage in Finland. At the same time they sought to strengthen the identity of the Swedish- speaking population, and its understanding of its own culture. Today SLS has over 1,100 members, with around 100 employees in Helsinki and Vaasa. == SLS as a collector and mediator of material about Finland-Swedish culture == SLS\u2019s main office in Helsinki.

SLS documents contemporary society and accepts donations of cultural and historical material comprising everything from manuscripts and photographs to audio and video recordings, and maps. SLS is making an increasing amount of its archive material available online. The material can be found on SLS\u2019s own website, on the imaging site Flickr, in the EU\u2019s digital library Europeana and at the Finnish search portal Finna, where you can also search the SLS union catalogue. The archive material that SLS publishes online is available for free use. The SLS archive also compiles teaching materials for schools. == SLS and research == The Society of Swedish Literature in Finland is the largest funder of Finland-Swedish-related research in the humanities and social sciences.
