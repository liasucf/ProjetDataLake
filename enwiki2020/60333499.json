    "text": "Tenor Legacy is an album by saxophonist/composer Benny Golson, that features tunes associated with ten prominent jazz tenor saxophonists, which was recorded in 1996 and originally released by the Japanese Keystone label before being re-released by the Arkadia Jazz label in 1998.Arkadia Jazz discography: album details accessed March 25, 2019Benny Golson website: discography accessed March 25, 2019Jazzdisco: Benny Golson catalog accessed March 25, 2019 ==Reception== The AllMusic review by Scott Yanow said \"On this enjoyable set, veteran tenor saxophonist Benny Golson pays tribute to nine other tenors: Lester Young, Coleman Hawkins, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, John Coltrane, Stan Getz, Zoot Sims, Ben Webster, and Don Byas ... Golson sounds quite inspired by the settings. This is one of his strongest all-round sessions of the 1990s\". All About Jazz's Jack Bowers stated \"I've long held Golson in high regard, both as a player and writer; my admiration for the other horns on Tenor Legacy is, shall we say, somewhat less intense ... This is a colorful session with perceptive choices of melody and tempo. One's enjoyment may rest in part on the extent to which he fancies the horn section\".Bowers, J.
