Students of the High school started a walkout in support of banning Lily Perry from the girl's bathroom and locker room. Perry was offered a separate gender- neutral bathroom in response to her request. Many of the students that participated in the walkout did so simply to leave school. https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/hillsboro-high-students-walk- out-over-transgender-dispute/article_be488fab-d239-5944-9733-32f569dcdc32.html == References == Category:High schools in Jefferson County, Missouri Category:Public high schools in Missouri Category:Education in Jefferson County, Missouri ",
