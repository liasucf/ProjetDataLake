    "text": "Michigan's 10th congressional district is a United States congressional district in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, covering a region known as the Thumb. It consists of all of Huron, Lapeer, St. Clair, and Sanilac counties, as well as most of northern Macomb County and eastern Tuscola County. District boundaries were redrawn in 1992, 2002, and 2012 due to reapportionment following the censuses of 1990, 2000, and 2010. The current district is fairly conservative. Huron, Lapeer, St. Clair, and Sanilac counties tend to support Republican candidates, as do the northern townships in Macomb and the eastern townships in Tuscola. With 15.5%, this district has the largest proportion of Polish Americans in the country. The district is currently represented by Republican Paul Mitchell, who was first elected in 2016. == Recent election results from statewide races == {| class=wikitable ! Year ! Office !

In the 2002 redistricting Lapeer County, Huron County, Sanilac County and about two thirds of Sterling Heights were added to the district. At the same time Clinton Township, Mt. Clemens, St. Clair Shores, Fraser and Roseville were removed from the district. Prior to the 1992 redistricting the 10th district had its largest city as Midland and roughly corresponded to the present 4th district. The post-1992 10th district was very similar to the previous 12th district, although it took small areas from the 18th district, the 14th district and the 8th district, and lost north-west Warren to the new 12th district. == List of members representing the district == {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" !
