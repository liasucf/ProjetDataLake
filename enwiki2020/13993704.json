    "text": "Inchcailloch (; island of the old woman), burial place of Saint Kentigerna Caintigern (died 734), or Saint Kentigerna, was a daughter of Cellach Cualann, King of Leinster, and of Caintigern, daughter of Conaing Cuirre. Her feast is listed in the Aberdeen Breviary for 7 January. Her husband is said to have been Feriacus regulus of Monchestre. Mac Shamhrain identifies him with the Feradach hoa Art\u00far of D\u00e1l Riata, the possible grandson of King Arthur who signed the C\u00e1in Adomn\u00e1in at Birr in 697 and supposes that he was a king in D\u00e1l Riata. Along with her brother St. Comgan and her son St. Fillan, the widowed Caintigern is said to have lived as a hermit, first in Strath Fillan, then in the Lennox, on the island of Inchcailloch on Loch Lomond. ==References== ==External links== * http://medievalscotland.org/kmo/AnnalsIndex/Feminine/Caintigern.shtml ==Sources== * Alan Orr Anderson, Early Sources of Scottish History A.D 500-1286, volume 1.
