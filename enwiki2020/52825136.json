    "text": "Spider-Man (also known as Spider-Man 2017) is an American animated television series that is based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. A replacement for the previous series Ultimate Spider-Man, the first season premiered on August 19, 2017 on Disney XD. The show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on June 18, 2018. The show was subtitled Spider-Man: Maximum Venom for its third season, which premiered on April 19, 2020. ==Plot== ===Season 1=== Gifted teenager Peter Parker is given super powers when he is bitten by a radioactive spider during a school field trip to Oscorp Industries. After the death of his Uncle Ben by a burglar that he hesitated to stop at a wrestling arena, Peter comes to his own terms of being the superhero Spider-Man. Some time later, Peter begins learning how to balance his crime- fighting career with his new enrollment at Horizon High, a school for students with genius-level intellect run by headmaster Max Modell. Joining Peter in his ordeals against Jackal, Doctor Octopus, Vulture, Rhino, the Smythes (Spencer and Alistair), and numerous other villains are his classmates Gwen Stacy, Miles Morales, and Anya Corazon, as well as his best friend Harry Osborn. Over the course of the school year, Peter merges with and removes a parasitic alien dubbed the V-252 and trains Miles on how to use his own Spider Powers as an \"Ultimate Spider-Man\" after he also ends up getting bitten by a genetically- modified spider. Peter and his friends eventually discover that Jackal (who is actually Gwen's uncle Raymond Warren) created the spiders that gave them their Spider Powers for the purpose of turning everyone in New York into an army of spider-like monsters dubbed \"Man-Spiders\", but Raymond's scheme is thwarted through the teamwork of Peter, Miles, Anya and Harry. During this period, Gwen and Anya develop Spider Powers of their own, with the former assuming the \"Spider-Gwen\" alias, and Harry also learns that Peter is Spider-Man. With Osborn Academy destroyed at the climax of the \"Spider-Island\" crisis, Harry dons the OsCorp technology and discovers that his father Norman Osborn had orchestrated his expulsion from Horizon High at the school year's beginning as part of his vision of making his son execute Super-Man and be New York's definite hero. Ultimately, Harry chooses to side with Peter instead of his father, and Norman apparently dies in an explosion. As summer vacation begins, Harry takes over his father's business and discovers a hidden chamber filled with Norman's Goblin technology while Max creates a monument of Spider-Man at Horizon High as the school's unofficial mascot. ===Season 2=== Peter navigates through both his sophomore year and his career at the Daily Bugle while finding that he must once again contend with Doctor Octopus as well as the V-252 Symbiote, which has now assumed the name of \"Venom\" after it merges itself with his jealous co-worker Eddie Brock. While Peter uncovers a bounty that has been seemingly placed on him by Chameleon, Anya adopts the \"Spider- Girl\" alias when her Spider Powers from the \"Spider-Island\" incident resurface and forms a \"Spider Team\" with Miles and Gwen. Doctor Octopus is revealed to be the true mastermind behind the bounty and successfully manages to swap bodies with Spider-Man, becoming the Superior Spider-Man. Around the same time, Gwen acquires old and new Spider Powers thanks to the Blood Gem relic and begins working alongside Miles and Anya under the \"Ghost-Spider\" alias. After being swayed by Peter's memories of Uncle Ben into becoming a hero, Octavius begins working on methods to become more efficient in crime-fighting than Peter ever was, but his ruthlessness prompts Miles to have the Avengers investigate on his behalf. Meanwhile, Peter's consciousness escapes the Living Brain via the Neuro Cortex and downloads himself into Octavius' discarded tentacles after encountering memories of Octavius' past in the process. Octavius (as Peter) re-enrolls at Midtown High and befriends the assistant chemistry teacher Anna Maria Marconi. Discovering how wrong he was about himself and Spider-Man during a fight against a genetically-altered Venom, Octavius reunites Peter's consciousness and body before his tentacles degrade the former into nothing. After saving Anna Maria from Venom, Spider-Man honors Octavius' heroism by placing his consciousness back in his inactive body. Soon after becoming his former self once more, Spider-Man takes it upon himself to rescue the Avengers from Regent, who has been replicating the abilities of the various super villains incarcerated at the prison known as the Cellar to imprison the Avengers in another dimension. Octavius recovers from his coma in time for him and Anna Maria to help Spider-Man free Cloak and Dagger so they can rescue the missing Avengers and defeat Regent. After Spider-Man stops the rampaging speedster Slyde with help from Octavius (now going by Doctor Octopus once more), they discover the existence of a recently formed cult-like organization who are calling themselves the Goblin Nation, armed with the same kind of Goblin technology used by Norman. While investigating Norman's hidden Goblin tech chamber, Spider-Man and Hobgoblin discover the Goblin Nation's leader the Goblin King is none other than Adrian Toomes. Working together with the rest of the Spider Team, they are able to defeat the Goblin Nation's various clans (consisting of Electro's Electro Goblins, Silvermane's Cyber Goblins, and Crossbones' War Goblins). When Toomes takes control of a powerful Goblin Mech in a bid to destroy the city, Octavius stops him by disabling the suit with the Neuro Cortex but fades away into light particles in the process. At Octavius's funeral, Peter reconciles with Gwen, Anya, and Max for what happened when Octavius was Superior Spider-Man. To his surprise, Peter is also re-enrolled at Horizon High thanks to Max receiving a recommendation letter from Octavius prior to the latter's death. ===Season 3 (Maximum Venom)=== Two weeks after Octavius' death, Spider-Man finds himself dealing with a machine called the Technovore rampaging through Horizon High and ends up using a synthetic copy of Venom created by Max (who has also been aware of his true identity ever since the downfall of the Goblin Nation) to stop it. Peter and Max later discover that the Technovore's rampage had been orchestrated by the school's new teacher Curt Connors, as part of a mission to investigate Max's \"corrupt operations\" involving Venom, on the behalf of a barely-alive Norman Osborn. Upon being accidentally released by Dr. Connors, the original Venom revitalizes himself using his synthetic copy as he escapes to Duncan Valley, where the meteor that brought him to Earth had crashed. Recovering an energy seed that had also been inside of the meteor, Venom uses it to shoot out a beam-like beacon into space, until Spider-Man manages to stop the beacon, the process of which also ultimately kills Venom. However, in response to this beacon, a massive swarm of Klyntar make their way to Earth from Venom's home planet for an invasion. Star-Lord, who with the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy, had worked with Spider-Man to deal with a prior Klyntar-related incident, sends Groot to Earth ahead of the swarm with a message to warn Peter about the impending invasion: Peter and Miles decode it with the help of Ironheart, Totally Awesome Hulk, and Doctor Strange, after they all rescue Groot from the clutches of A.I.M. and Baron Mordo. As the first wave of Klyntar makes planetfall, they use the Avengers they possessed on their way to Earth as their advance team to possess the heroes of Earth one-by-one, so the rest of the swarm can quickly do the same to the citizens of New York City, with only a few survivors including Spider-Man, Max, and Aunt May. Convincing Marc Spector to both resume his role as a hero and help him save the Earth, Spider-Man rescues the survivors. Using the Venomized Groot that Max had captured, Spider-Man and company create a synthetic Klyntar named Anti-Venom as an antidote to the Klyntar infestation. After everyone on Earth is cured by the Anti-Venomized Groot, Doctor Strange takes him into space so the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy can be cured. As Earth finishes recovering from the invasion, Peter manages to secure evidence of Max's innocence for the school board, yet is unable to get the necessary testimony from Aleksei Sytsevich due to him being turned into Rhino by Swarm. Peter makes up for the lack of it by giving a compelling one as Spider-Man, only for Dr. Connors to win the trial by blackmailing Peter into unmasking himself, resulting in the school board firing Max and making Connors the interim headmaster until the end of the season. Gwen and Anya are also at first distraught by Spider-Man's mistake about not telling them his real identity, though he figures out how to reconcile with them using advice from Mary Jane Watson after they and Miles defeat Swarm and shut down his operations. Despite being prohibited by the head administrator from being Spider-Man at Horizon High, the school board also decides to keep knowledge of Peter's identity a secret from the public. During the new semester, Connor has been running Horizon High like a dictator and forcing students to turn in their projects but after an acid-based accident caused by Grady reveals evidence of Jackal's return, Spider-Man and Ghost-Spider work to track down Jackal, while Miles and Anya investigate the teacher's lounge for any clues, and discover Dr. Connors has stolen the seed recovered from Venom's meteor only to be ambushed by Chameleon (who has been posing Anya's stepsister Maria). Once Spider-Man and Ghost-Spider locate their friends, they find an injured Norman who survived his death during the first season and is resurrected into a hybrid of Venom and Jackal's DNA known as the Dark Goblin. Norman had recruited Dr. Connors to help him in exchange for the cure for Connors' mutation, but during the Spider Team's fight against the Dark Goblin's party, Connors transforms back into the Lizard as Norman reveals he had lied about the cure's existence. Norman is eventually reverted back to his original human form and is taken into custody alongside Jackal and Chameleon while Swarm (who is actually Miles' father Jefferson Davis) flees after Miles causes him to see the error of his ways. Using a drone hacked by Miles, Peter and his friends expose Norman's conspiracy and manipulation of Dr. Connors to the school board, who in turn reinstate Max as headmaster. ==Characters== ===Spider Team=== The Spider Team are the primary protagonists of the series, being Horizon High students with spider-like abilities.

During Season 1, Norman secretly orchestrated his son's suspension from Horizon High and created Osborn Academy in an attempt to make Harry New York's definite hero, with Spider-Man's very existence being an interference with that vision. Despite his manipulative and corrupt nature, he genuinely cares for his son and sought to prevent Jackal from carrying out his master plan. Although he was initially presumed dead following the destruction of Jackal's lab, he resurfaced as the Spider King of Jackal's Man-Spider army. Norman donned a replica of the Hobgoblin armor and tried to end Spider-Man himself only to be ultimately betrayed and severely injured by Harry to the point of missing his left arm and right leg, being deathly thin and the right side of his face was burnt. Over the following months, he began watching Spider-Man in the shadows while making his own villain team to take him down. In Maximum Venom, Norman finally reveals himself upon being resurrected as the Dark Goblin using a combination of Venom's DNA and the Jackal's latest serum. He has also been collaborating with Dr. Connors, Jackal, Swarm, and Chameleon to formulate a conspiracy to turn the board of education against Spider-Man and Max, essentially leading his forces to take over Horizon High, out of revenge for the fall of Osborn Academy.
