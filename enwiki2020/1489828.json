In 1929, the French company A\u00e9ropostale (known as Lignes A\u00e9riennes Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re until 1927), then under the leadership of its owner Marcel Bouilloux-Lafont, arrived in Venezuela. A\u00e9ropostale viewed Venezuela as the ideal bridge to link South America with the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. This idea materialized on 3 July 1929. Three Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re 28's carried out the first flights of the new airline, although some Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re 26's were also used in those earlier routes. On 31 December 1933, the Venezuelan government purchased the airline after the French government inexplicably decided to stop subsidizing it. ===Life as a government-owned company=== Despite its new Venezuelan ownership, the airline continued to be run by French personnel under the direction of Robert Gu\u00e9rin until 1 January 1935, when its name was changed to L\u00ednea Aeropostal Venezolana (LAV) and operations shifted to Venezuelan hands under the management of commander Francisco Leonardi. At the start, the company was capitalized at 1,600,000 bol\u00edvares, but it wasn't until 21 May 1937, that the government of Venezuela secured full ownership of the airline. It did so through an injection of capital and by replacing the Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re 28's with several Fairchild 71's. The expansion program was further reinforced with the purchase of six Lockheed Model 10 Electras. In 1939, LAV's headquarters were moved from Maracay to Maiquet\u00eda because of its proximity to Caracas. That same year, Douglas DC-3s were introduced in order to transport larger cargo loads and passengers. By 1942 the fleet had grown considerably. LAV's first international flights began in July 1945, serving the city of Boa Vista in northern Brazil. It wasn't really considered an international destination as it was close to Venezuela's border. LAV's second international route was to Aruba in January 1946. This connected to KLM's international route structure. Aeropostal 1950s Logo After the war ended, LAV re-equipped with newer aircraft, replacing its Electra and Lockheed Lodestar fleet which was decimated by many accidents over the previous five years. Douglas DC-3s and Douglas DC-4s were introduced along with Martin 2-0-2 aircraft. In 1947, the airline introduced Lockheed Constellations to fly a new direct international route from Caracas to New York's Idlewild Airport. This new service started on 21 March 1947. In 1951, LAV began service to Lima, Peru and Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The Bogot\u00e1 route was acquired by LAV after they purchased 88% of TACA de Venezuela. Previously, TACA de Venezuela had a joint route agreement with the Colombian airline, LANSA. Until TACA de Venezuela was completely absorbed by LAV in 1958, the route to Bogot\u00e1 was flown using TACA aircraft in TACA livery. During the 1950s, LAV opened a transatlantic service and began flying to Panama (in 1953). The Constellation fleet was upgraded to L-1049G Super Constellations. An order for the first jet airliner, the De Havilland Comet 1, was placed, but with the Comet crashes of the 1950s, the airline never got their Comet jets. On 24 March 1956, LAV introduced its first turboprop, a Vickers Viscount 701 which was to replace the older piston engined Douglas and Martin aircraft. Old Aeropostal Logo In the early 1960s, the Venezuelan government wanted to separate LAV's international and domestic routes, thus creating a new airline, Viasa, for international flights. A new livery was introduced for the new decade. The full airline title which had appeared on the Constellation fleet was simplified to a simple and bold AEROPOSTAL. The Constellations flew with a flying globe logo on the nose, was also simplified, now appearing on the fin as a flying bird logo, a logo that would remain with the airline. Also in the early 1960s, the 'jet-prop' Avro 748 was introduced to replace the smaller piston twins that had made up LAV's fleet since 1938. Douglas DC-8 jets were introduced in 1961 to replace the Super Constellations. During the 1960s and 1990s LAV continued to introduce new fleet types like first the Caravelle and then Boeing/Douglas DC-9-32, the Boeing/Douglas DC-9-51 and the DC-9-80 During the late 1980s, Aeropostal substituted Viasa with a run from Caracas to Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where the airline also sponsored WAPA-TV's weekly, youth oriented Control Remoto television show. ===Recent history=== In August 1994, commercial operations ceased, as part of a government effort to trim expenses. In 1996 Corporacion Alas de Venezuela (CAV), a private company owned by Nelson Ramiz, a Cuban-born US citizen and his Venezuelan wife, Haydhelm Emilia Valesquez Morales bought the assets from the liquidator, at an auction in Caracas on 27 September 1997, in a transaction that led to litigation in New York and Caracas. The purchase was funded by an investment company Alas International Limited (\"Alas\"). Instead of delivering the purchased assets to Alas, as required by the funding agreement, CAV restarted airline operations on 7 January 1998 using the purchased assets without permission from Alas. Alas launched a series of lawsuits against Ramiz, Valesquez, CAV and Aeropostal and on 2 November 1998, the US Supreme Court of New York found in favor of Alas, a judgement later confirmed on appeal. The essence of the judgement was that neither Ramiz, Morales, CAV or the airline had any economic or legal interest in the various assets purchased in 1997, including the aircraft and the trade name \"Aeropostal\". As a result, CAV, the airline and Ramiz entered into a settlement agreement on 29 February 2000, filed and entered at the New York Supreme Court with Index No. 601817/97New York Supreme Court, Index No. 601817/97 under which title of the aircraft transferred to the Alas owners but Alas allowed the airline to continue flying the aircraft in return for various payments. CAV and Aeropostal subsequently defaulted on the settlement and further litigation followed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York under case reference 652688/2012,New York Supreme Court Index No. 652688/2012 as a result of which, CAV and Aeropostal owe the successors to Alas very significant damages. As of March 2007, Aeropostal had 2,319 employees. Flights to the United States began in July 1998 and to Madrid in November 2001, although the latter have since ceased. In the late 1990s, Aeropostal introduced two Irish-registered Airbus A320s EI-TL,O and EI-TL,P to fly alongside the fleet of DC-9, McDonnell Douglas MD-83 and Boeing 727-200 jets. At the end of 2007, Nelson Ramiz (then CEO) reduced the fleet of 22 to only 3 claiming that the currency controls imposed by the Venezuelan government prevented him from maintaining the fleet, and that fare controls kept Aeropostal from making a profit. During that period, the Venezuelan Government planned on shutting down the airline if major changes were not planned. The INAC (The civil aviation authority of Venezuela) temporarily grounded Aeropostal operations, leaving thousands of passengers stranded in the high-travel holiday season. As of 2008 it was reported that the airline was sold to a group led by the Mahkled family from the state of Carabobo, Venezuela. The Makled family were later arrested by the Venezuelan government on money laundering and drug running charges but this transaction has been challenged as ineffective as neither Ramiz nor his wife had the power to transfer the shares as these were pledged to Alas under the settlement agreement referred to above. In 2009 the Venezuelan government announced its intention to nationalise Aeropostal, following the arrest of several owners and employees in 2008 on Interpol drug trafficking warrants.Venezuelanalysis, 29 March 2009, Venezuela to Nationalize Drug Trafficking-Linked Airline Aeropostal. On 25 February 2011, Aeropostal's Special Managing Board officially announced the retirement of YV141T, the last DC-9-30 in the active fleet. The final commercial flight was done on 10 March 2011. Although the -30s Series has been retired, the McDonnell-Douglas DC-9-50s will continue flying for Aeropostal, and according to LAV there are no plans for their retirement in the next 3 years. On 24 September 2017, Aerospostal ceased operations. The Board of Directors announced retired of operations of the airline, due to financial and economical problems. 2018 company informed to continue flights again. ==Destinations== {|class=\"sortable wikitable toccolours\" |+ Destinations !
