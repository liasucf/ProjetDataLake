Lightweights were limited to those boxers weighing a maximum of 60 kilograms (132.3 lbs). 37 boxers qualified for this category. Like all Olympic boxing events, the competition was a straight single-elimination tournament. Both semifinal losers were awarded bronze medals, so no boxers competed again after their first loss. Bouts consisted of six rounds each. Five judges scored each bout. ==Medalists== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" text-align:center; font- size:110%;\" width=\"35%\" |- | |- | |- |rowspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#cc9966\"|Bronze|| |- | |} ==Schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
