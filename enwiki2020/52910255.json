    "text": "Sacrifice in the Post-Kantian Tradition: Perspectivism, Intersubjectivity, and Recognition is a 2014 book about sacrifice by the philosopher Paolo Diego Bubbio, in which the author provides a historical and theoretical analysis of the development of the concept of sacrifice through the works of Kant, Karl Solger, Hegel, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche.Sacrifice in the Post-Kantian Tradition ==Summary== Bubbio's main thesis is that there is a strong interrelation between the kenotic conception of sacrifice and the tradition of Kantian and post-Kantian idealism. In other words, this conception of sacrifice can be seen in the works of most of the thinkers of the post-Kantian tradition. Bubbio argues that the very possibility of a \u201crealm of reason\u201d made up by values and norms depends on the recognition of \u201cthe other\u201d as another human being. Particularly he emphasizes the reciprocal connection of the Hegel's recognition-theoretic approach and his emphasis on kenotic sacrifice, both of which are evidence of his belonging to perspectivism. Bubbio takes this kind of perpectivism as a fundamental feature of the post-Kantian tradition. ==Reception== Sacrifice in the Post-Kantian Tradition was reviewed by the philosophers Gianni Vattimo, Chris Fleming, Mark Alznauer, and Patrick Stokes.A review of \"Sacrifice in the Post-Kantian Tradition\", Chris Fleming, Journal for the Academic Study of Religion, Vol 28, No 2 (2015)The Untameable Logic of Sacrifice (A review of \"Sacrifice in the Post-Kantian Tradition\") by Patrick Stokes, Critical Horizons, Volume 16, 2015 - Issue 3Secularizing Kenosis Review of Sacrifice in the Post-Kantian Tradition: Perspectivism, Intersubjectivity, and Recognition, by Paolo Diego Bubbio, Mark Alznauer, Philosophy Today, Volume 60, Issue 2, Spring 2016, Pages 609-614Kenotic Sacrifice and Philosophy (A review of \"Sacrifice in the Post-Kantian Tradition\") by Gianni Vattimo, Research in Phenomenology, Volume 45, Issue 3, pages 431-435 Vattimo writes: \"\u2026 Bubbio\u2019s book is an important philosophical work: not only as an excellent analysis of sacrifice in the post-Kantian tradition but also\u2014and perhaps especially\u2014because it confronts what is more alive in contemporary philosophy in a clear and productive way.\" Fleming writes: \"Bubbio\u2019s particular talent is for re-excavating the history of Western philosophy and asking us to see anew things that we have read before.\" == References == == External links == * Sacrifice in the Post-Kantian Tradition Category:2014 non-fiction books Category:American non-fiction books Category:Books about Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Category:Books about Immanuel Kant Category:Books about Friedrich Nietzsche Category:Books about sacrifice Category:Books by Diego Bubbio Category:Continental philosophy literature Category:English-language books Category:Philosophy books Category:SUNY Press books ",
