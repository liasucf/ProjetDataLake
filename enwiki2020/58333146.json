    "text": "The 2019 Plymouth City Council election was held on 2 May 2019 to elect members of Plymouth City Council in England. The Labour Party took control of the council after the 2018 election, with thirty-one members and a working majority. Labour defended nine seats, and the Conservatives defended ten. Labour won the election, winning ten of the nineteen seats up for election, with the Conservatives winning the other nine. == Background == Plymouth City Council held local elections on 2 May 2019 along with councils across England as part of the 2019 local elections. The council elects its councillors in thirds, with a third being up for election every year for three years, with no election each fourth year to correspond with councillors' four-year terms. Councillors defending their seats in this election were previously elected in 2015. In that election, ten Conservative candidates and nine Labour candidates were elected. Following the 2018 Plymouth City Council election, the council has been controlled by the Labour Party, initially with thirty-one councillors. Labour held its seat in a subsequent by-election in Stoke ward, which took place in July 2018. As the councillor who stood down was elected in the same cycle as 2019, Jemima Laing, the winner of the by-election, was the incumbent up for re-election. Kevin Neil, who was elected in 2018, was suspended from the Labour Party when a police investigation was launched into him. He continues to sit as an independent following the closure of the police investigation, pending an internal investigation by the party. Labour and the Conservatives contested all nineteen seats up for election, whilst the Liberal Democrats stood seventeen candidates and the UK Independence Party stood twelve. ==Overall results== After the previous election, the composition of the council was: {| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\" |} {| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\" |+ \u2193 |- style=\"color:white;\" | style=\"background:#dc241f; width:54.4%;\" | 31 | style=\"background:#0087dc; width:45.6%;\" | 26 |- | Labour | Conservative |} Immediately ahead of this election, the composition of the council was: {| style=\"width:100%; text- align:center;\" |} {| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\" |+ \u2193 |- style=\"color:white;\" | style=\"background:#dc241f; width:50.8%;\" | 30 | style=\"background:#0087dc; width:45.6%;\" | 26 | style=\"background:#dddddd; width:1.6%;\" | 1 |- | Labour | Conservative | Ind |} Following the election, the composition of the council was: {| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\" |} {| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\" |+ \u2193 |- style=\"color:white;\" | style=\"background:#dc241f; width:54.4%;\" | 31 | style=\"background:#0087dc; width:43.9%;\" | 25 | style=\"background:#dddddd; width:1.7%;\" | 1 |- | Labour | Conservative | Ind |} Note: All changes in vote share are in comparison to the corresponding 2015 election. ==Ward results== Asterisks denote sitting councillors seeking re-election. ===Budshead=== Location of Budshead ward ===Compton=== Location of Compton ward ===Devonport=== Location of Devonport ward ===Drake=== Location of Drake ward ===Efford and Lipson=== Location of Efford and Lipson ward ===Eggbuckland=== Location of Eggbuckland ward ===Ham=== Location of Ham ward ===Honicknowle=== Location of Honicknowle ward ===Moor View=== Location of Moor View ward ===Peverell=== Location of Peverell ward ===Plympton Erle=== Location of Plympton Erle ward ===Plympton St Mary=== Location of Plympton St Mary ward ===Plymstock Dunstone=== Location of Plymstock Dunstone ward ===Plymstock Radford=== Location of Plymstock Radford ward ===Southway=== Location of Southway ward ===St Budeaux=== Location of St Budeaux ward ===St Peter and the Waterfront=== Location of St Peter and the Waterfront ward ===Stoke=== Location of Stoke ward ===Sutton and Mount Gould=== Location of Sutton and Mount Gould ward ==References== Category:2019 English local elections 2019 Category:2010s in Devon Category:May 2019 events in the United Kingdom ",
