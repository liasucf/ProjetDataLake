Palmer, reviewing Prophecy in the New Millennium for the Review of Religious Research, called the book \"a rich and ground-breaking study that should stimulate a fresh interest in this enigmatic phenomenon.\" Benjamin D. Crace, reviewing the book for Nova Religio, describes it as \"a concise introduction to prophecy, its history, current role, and trajectory\" that explores why prophecy \"continues to persist as modernity fails and the world becomes increasingly interconnected.\" Crace notes that \"some readers will find the narratives more readable and interesting\" than the scholarly analysis. ==Works== * 2013 Prophecy in the New Millennium: When Prophecies Persist, Routledge (edited, with Sarah Harvey) * 2017 The Revival of Yoga in Contemporary India Oxford Research Encyclopedias * 2019 Yoga in Britain: Stretching Spirituality and Educating Yogis, Equinox == See also == * Yoga in Britain, the focus of Newcombe's research == References == Category:Yoga scholars ",
