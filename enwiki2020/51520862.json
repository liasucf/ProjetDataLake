In 1961, Bloomfield was appointed to the faculty of Harvard University after holding positions at the University of Wisconsin, the University of Akron, New York University (serving as the Berg Professor of English from 1955 to 1956), and, from 1946 to 1961, at Ohio State University.

Recent holders of the Morton Bloomfield Fellowship include Susanna Fein (2009\u201310), Tara Williams, Laura Ashe (2015\u201316), Ad Putter (2017\u201318), and Anthony Bale (2018\u201319). == Major works == Over a 50-year career, Bloomfield published over 200 articles and books on medieval literature, language, literary criticism/theory, the history of ideas and wisdom literature. His major works included The Seven Deadly Sins: An Introduction to the History of a Religious Concept (1952); Piers Plowman as a Fourteenth Century Apocalypse (1961); with Leonard Newmark A Linguistic Introduction to the History of English (1963); Essays and Explorations: Studies in Language and Literature (1970); Incipits of Latin Works on the Virtues and Vices, 1110-1500 (1979); and, posthumously, with Charles W. Dunn The Role of the Poet in Early Societies (1989). In 1993 Elizabeth Walsh and Susie M. Barretta edited a collection of his essays from the last 17 years of his life and published them as The Light of Learning. == National Humanities Center == With his colleague Gregory Vlastos, Bloomfield conceptualized and laid the groundwork for the establishment of the National Humanities Center in Research Triangle Park, a private, nonprofit organization, and \"the only independent institute dedicated exclusively to advanced study in all areas of the humanities.\"http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/ He served as chairman of the center's Board of Trustees from 1973 to 1976. == Honors and awards == Called \"one of the truly great medieval scholars\" of his generation and \"one of the glories of the Harvard English department,\" Bloomfield was twice awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship (1949; 1964); was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1963); a corresponding fellow of the British Academy (1975); a member of the American Philosophical Society (1981); and served on the Executive Committee of the Modern Language Association during a turbulent time in academia (1966\u201369).
