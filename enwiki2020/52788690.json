    "text": "The White River in Wisconsin flows out of Geneva Lake, roughly 19 miles, to the Fox River in Burlington, Wisconsin. There is a dam in Burlington that forms Echo Lake. The river goes through the small town of Lyons on its way to Burlington. White River floods often and is a popular canoe/kayak river in the region. The remains of an 1800s dam are visible on Sheridan Springs Road where it crosses the river entering Lyons from the west. This formed a mill pond that is still shown on maps today even though it was drained several decades ago. ==References== Category:Rivers of Wisconsin Category:Bodies of water of Racine County, Wisconsin Category:Bodies of water of Walworth County, Wisconsin ",
