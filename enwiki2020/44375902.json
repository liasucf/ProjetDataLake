    "text": "John William Scarbrough (October 20, 1885 - March 3, 1960) was a college football player. ==Early years== John William Scarbrough was born on October 20, 1885 in Rockdale, Texas to Eugene Monroe Scarbrough and Ada Ledbetter. ==Sewanee== Scarbrough was an All-Southern quarterback for the Sewanee Tigers of Sewanee: The University of the South, and captain of its team in 1905. On the dedication of Harris Stadium, one writer noted \"The University of the South has numbered among its athletes some of the greatest. Anyone who played against giant Henry Phillips in 1901-1903 felt that he was nothing less than the best as guard and fullback. Anyone who ever saw a punt from the foot of J. W. Scarbrough.\" He scored the Tigers' only points in the 68 to 4 loss to Vanderbilt. ==References== Category:1885 births Category:1960 deaths Category:American football quarterbacks Category:American football punters Category:Sewanee Tigers football players Category:Players of American football from Texas Category:People from Rockdale, Texas Category:All-Southern college football players ",
