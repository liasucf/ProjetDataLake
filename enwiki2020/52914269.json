In 2016 Sudanese American teacher Laila El-Amin, who headed the Arabic and religion departments of Aqsa School, received the Golden Apple award. ==Demographics== Most students are of Arab heritage, and those of Palestinian heritage are the largest Arab subgroup. Barnaby B. Riedel, author of \"Universal Particularism: Making an Ethical Islamic School in Chicago,\" wrote that because Aqsa's student body is almost all ethnic Palestinian, teachers at the nearby Universal School would perceive Aqsa as being more of a \"cultural\" institution as opposed to a religious one. Other Arab-American groups include Egyptian, Jordanian, Lebanese, Libyan, and Syrian backgrounds. There are also students of European origin, including those of Albanian, Italian, and Turkish backgrounds. The school has South Asian-origin students; including those of Bangladeshi, Indian, Kashmiri, and Pakistani origins; and Southeast Asian-origin students, including those from the Philippines. In addition there are African-American and Hispanic and Latino students. In terms of race most students are designated as White American, as Arab Americans are racially classified as \"White\". ==Operations== The 6th and 9th grades see influxes of students who transfer from other schools. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Girls' schools in Illinois Category:Islamic schools in Illinois Category:Private elementary schools in Illinois Category:Private middle schools in Illinois Category:Private high schools in Illinois Category:1986 establishments in Illinois Category:Educational institutions established in 1986 ",
