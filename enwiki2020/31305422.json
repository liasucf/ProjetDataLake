    "text": "Radio and Television of Slovakia () or RTVS is a nationwide public broadcasting, state-funded organisation in Slovakia. It is headquartered in Bratislava and led by Jaroslav Rezn\u00edk. The organization in its current form was created in 2011 following a merger of Slovensk\u00e1 telev\u00edzia (Slovak Television) with Slovensk\u00fd rozhlas (Slovak Radio). Funding for the combined organisation is obtained through advertising, government payments, and a monthly fee levied on most individuals registered with electricity retailers and most businesses containing three or more employees. Like its two predecessor organizations, RTVS is a full member of the European Broadcasting Union. ==Radio channels== There are 5 FM radio stations: *SRo1 :R\u00e1dio Slovensko *SRo2 :R\u00e1dio Regina *SRo3 :R\u00e1dio Dev\u00edn *SRo4 :R\u00e1dio FM *SRo5 :R\u00e1dio Patria Via Satellite, DVB-T and Internet *SRo6 :Radio Slovakia International It also has digital-only stations: *SRo7 :R\u00e1dio Pyramida (classical music) *SRo8 :R\u00e1dio Litera (radio, stage drama and literary profiles) *SRo9 :R\u00e1dio Junior (for children up to the age of 10) R\u00e1dio Regina is separated into the three regions of R\u00e1dio Regina Bratislava, R\u00e1dio Regina Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, and R\u00e1dio Regina Ko\u0161ice. The output of R\u00e1dio Patria, which went on air in 2009, broadcasting from 06:00 until 18:00, is in the Hungarian language, as a service for Slovakia's largest ethnic minority group living predominantly in the southern districts bordering Hungary. ==Television channels== There are 3 national television channels. ===Current=== *:1 (Jednotka) is a generalist channel, showing family-oriented television, Slovak movies, children's programming, news and documentaries.
