This palace was constructed by General Khadga Samsher Rana JBR in 1893. ==History== Rani Mahal, Palpa In 1887 General Khadga Samsher Rana was forced to drop his royal titles and was sent to Palpa-Gauda as the Western Commander in Chief of Nepal. At Palpa-Gauda in 1892 Khadga Shumsher's beloved youngest wife Tej Kumari Devi died and within a year Khadga built a palace and named after his wife as Rani Mahal (Literary translates as Queens Palace). He also named the nearby forest as Rani Ban (Rani forest) along with naming the Ghats as Rani Ghat. In 1902, Khadga Samsher Rana along with his family fled to India abandoning Rani Mahal after which the Mahal went to disrepair. ==Current Status, Reconstruction & Restoration== As Khadga Samsher abandoned the palace and fled to India, Rani Mahal was left behind without any proper owner or caretaker. The condition of the palace was a concern of both the government of Nepal and locals. Rani Mahal was largely turned into rubble by the end of 20th century. Very few visitors used to visit the palace, only those most interested in the history of Nepal. At present, the Government of Nepal has started a reconstruction and restoration program to repair and rebuild the palace to its original state. This will not only preserve the national historical properties, but also increase the possibilities of tourism in the area and result in various developments. ==Access== Currently, there is motorable road to Rani Mahal. It takes around one hour to reach the Rani Mahal from Tansen. No public vehicles are available for the trip. Also, foot trail from Kailashnagar near the Batasedanda, about 3km from Tansen leads to Ranimahal. It takes about 3-4 hrs walk to Rani Mahal from Batase. ==Legacy== Rani Mahal is considered as the \"Taj Mahal of Nepal\" due to its relative location in Kaligandaki River over a huge rock. ==See also== *Rana palaces of Nepal *Tansen Durbar *Seto Durbar *Bhairabsthan Temple ==References== Category:Rana palaces of Nepal ",
