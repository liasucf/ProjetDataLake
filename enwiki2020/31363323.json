    "text": "Stanislav Lobotka (; born 25 November 1994) is a Slovak professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Italian club Napoli and the Slovak national team. ==Club career== ===AS Tren\u010d\u00edn=== Lobotka made his Corgo\u0148 Liga debut for AS Tren\u010d\u00ednPeltier zariadil rem\u00edzu Tren\u010d\u00edna s Banskou Bystricou 04.03.2012, sport.aktuality.sk against FK Dukla Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica on 4 March 2012. ====Ajax (loan)==== Lobotka joined AFC Ajax for the 2013\u201314 season on 30 June 2013 on a one-year loan with option to buy.Lobotka do Ajaxu Amsterdam Stanislav Lobotka prestupuje do Ajaxu Amsterdam He played his first match for Ajax on 13 July 2013 in a pre-season friendly encounter against RKC Waalwijk. He came on as a 60th minute substitute for Christian Eriksen in the 5\u20131 win in Waalwijk at the Mandemakers Stadion. ===Nordsj\u00e6lland=== Stanislav Lobotka came to FC Nordsj\u00e6lland in August shortly before the transfer window closed, and made his debut against Br\u00f8ndby on 30 August 2015. Lobotka entered as a regular on the midfield, and in his first season has played all the matches except for one because of illness. The 21-year-old Slovak was voted player of the year in his first season at the FCN Awards. In 2017, he was again voted club's player of the year after another great season. ===Celta Vigo=== On 15 July 2017, Lobotka joined Celta on a five-year deal. On 3 June 2019, Lobotka admitted that after Celta's unsuccessful season, he was open to a transfer, looking to find a club set to play in European competitions next season. According to Pravda he also claimed, that he was aware of an interest from other Spanish and German clubs. === Napoli === On 15 January 2020, Lobotka signed to Italian Serie A club S.S.C. Napoli, for a reported \u20ac24m deal until 2024. Lobotka was benched in his first possible fixture against Fiorentina, on 18 January 2020, in a 0\u20132 defeat. Instead, Lobotka made a brief, 22 minute appearance in Coppa Italia against Lazio, being featured in the starting line-up. He had to be replaced early due to tactical changes, following a red card to Elseid Hysaj. Still, Lobotka witnessed an early winning goal by Lorenzo Insigne in the 2nd minute. He made his league debut against table-leaders Juventus on 26 January 2020. Lobotka came on as a replacement for Diego Demme, who was booked with a yellow card in the first half. Napoli managed to earn an upset victory over the favourites, by winning 2\u20131, with goals scored by Piotr Zieli\u0144ski and Lorenzo Insigne. Cristiano Ronaldo's stoppage time goal did not change the result. He had his first league start in the next round, in a 4\u20132 away victory at Stadio Luigi Ferraris against Sampdoria. Lobotka played for over an hour and was replaced by Diego Demme, as Napoli led 2\u20131, after goals by Arkadiusz Milik and Elif Elmas. Demme went on to score the third goal and Dries Mertens sealed the win in stoppage time. Lobotka had also been added to Napoli's UEFA Champions League squad, thus making him eligible to participate in the Round of 16 fixtures against Barcelona. The first competitive set of fixtures between the clubs was also dubbed, by some, the Maradona derby. ==International career== Lobotka represented various youth Slovak teams, and in November 2016 he was called up to the senior Slovakia squad for matches against Lithuania and Austria. He made his debut in the latter friendly match, on 15 November 2016, along with other debuting players, Mat\u00fa\u0161 Bero and Albert Rusn\u00e1k. He played in the second half of the goalless draw. He was then called up to multiple fixtures but had to wait for his competitive debut until 1 September 2017, for a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Slovenia. He played the entire match being a valuable midfielder, fulfilling the expectations following the successful performances of Lobotka and Slovakia U21 at the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship, as well as his move to Celta Vigo. His performance contributed to Slovakia's 1-0 home win and he was dubbed the 'Man of The Match' by media and the fans. Only three days later, on 4 September 2017, Lobotka scored his first international goal for the senior team and became the first Slovak to score at Wembley, in a qualifier against England. He scored after he tackled and took the ball from Marcus Rashford and exchanged a pass with Adam Nemec, before beating Joe Hart in the 3rd minute of the match. Slovakia however went on to lose the game 1-2, after goals by Eric Dier and Rashford. The 8th game of the campaign was a direct battle for the 1st place in qualifying Group F. Similarly, like after the previous game, Lobotka received praise for his performance. By the end of the year, he scored again in a friendly match against Norway in the 93rd minute, providing Slovakia a 1-0 victory in a final international game of J\u00e1n \u010eurica. ===J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k's resignation incident=== By October 2018, Lobotka became a key player of Slovakia, commonly earning caps in start starting line-up. Lobotka was nominated for a double fixture against Czech Republic and Sweden on 13 October and 16 October 2018, respectively. Lobotka played tin both games, but was also involved in the controversy, that had led to resignation of J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k, then Slovakia's longest-serving and most successful coach, who introduced him to the national team. Lobotka violated the code of conduct of national team player, along with Martin D\u00fabravka, Michal \u0160ulla, Milan \u0160kriniar, Norbert Gy\u00f6mb\u00e9r, \u013dubom\u00edr \u0160atka, Vladim\u00edr Weiss. On the night of 13 October 2018, after a loss in Slovakia's second UEFA Nations League fixture and a derby match against Czech Republic (1\u20132), they left the hotel and went out, missed the bedtime and violated the wellness policy, regarding regeneration and rehabilitation. They were allegedly noticed by J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k at about midnight, admitting to the incident and apologising the next day. J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k resigned from the national team in the afternoon of 14 October, revealing the details of his decision in a press conference on 18 October, to avoid distractions during the preparation for the fixture against Sweden, that was managed by his former assistant \u0160tefan Tarkovi\u010d on a caretaker basis. Koz\u00e1k cited his inability to work with the squad under such conditions as the primary reason, as about a third of the squad was involved, including players Koz\u00e1k described as crucial for the future of Slovak football, with Lobotka among them. The President of SFZ, J\u00e1n Kov\u00e1\u010dik, said that the players will be punished by not receiving any financial rewards for any future nominations and performances in the national team during the upcoming qualification cycle. During the press conference, Koz\u00e1k expressed disappointment about Lobotka's statements, when Lobotka allegedly told the press that \"coaches come and go, we are professionals\". Koz\u00e1k felt that this is in a direct contrast with their conduct of the previous days, however he added, that he likes Lobotka and will continue to cheer for him. Koz\u00e1k however also revealed, that upon inquiry why Lobotka engaged in such conduct, he allegedly told him that he has a busy timetable at Vigo and has no time to relax, to which Koz\u00e1k sarcastically remarked, that Lobotka finds time to relax with Saturday - Tuesday fixture with national team, but not Saturday - Saturday match plan at Vigo. Only hours before the incident, \u0160kriniar and Lobotka in particular faced criticism from Koz\u00e1k during a post-match press conference, who described their performance as poor and commented on the need for these highly valued players, worth millions, to take responsibility, instead of relying on other more experienced players, like Martin \u0160krtel and Marek Ham\u0161\u00edk. On 19 October, SFZ published a common statement of \u0160kriniar and Lobotka, accepting Koz\u00e1k's criticism as normal and justified, although disagreeing with the comments about their value and transfer rumours. They apologised to the fans, the FA and their team- mates, although claiming that they understand that no apology is sufficient enough. They also accepted the sanctions and expressed hope for continued support of the national team. ===International goals=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+ International goals by date, venue, cap, opponent, score, result and competition |- !scope=col|No. !scope=col data- sort-type=date|Date !scope=col|Venue !scope=col|Cap !scope=col|Opponent !scope=col|Score !scope=col|Result !scope=col|Competition |- !scope=row|1 |4 September 2017||Wembley Stadium, London, England||align=center|3||||align=center|1\u20130|| align=center|1\u20132 ||2018 FIFA World Cup qualification |- !scope=row|2 |14 November 2017||\u0160tadi\u00f3n Antona Malatinsk\u00e9ho, Trnava, Slovakia||align=center|7||||align=center|1\u20130|| align=center|1\u20130 ||Friendly |- !scope=row|3 |11 June 2019||Bakcell Arena, Baku, Azerbaijan||align=center|17||||align=center|1\u20130||align=center|5\u20131||UEFA Euro 2020 qualification |} ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|Cup !colspan=2|Continental !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals |- |rowspan=6|Tren\u010d\u00edn||2010\u201311||2. liga||2||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||2||0 |- |2011\u201312||rowspan=4|Corgo\u0148 Liga||5||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||5||0 |- |2012\u201313||31||2||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||31||2 |- |2014\u201315||32||1||4||0||4||0||colspan=2|\u2013||40||1 |- |2015\u201316||6||0||0||0||2||0||colspan=2|\u2013||8||0 |- !colspan=2|Total||76||3||4||0||6||0||colspan=2|\u2013||86||3 |- |rowspan=2|Jong Ajax (loan)||2013\u201314||Eerste Divisie||30||3||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||30||3 |- !colspan=2|Total||30||3||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||30||3 |- |rowspan=3|Nordsj\u00e6lland||2015\u201316||rowspan=2|Danish Superliga||26||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||26||0 |- |2016\u201317||26||0||1||0||colspan=2|\u2013||9||0||36||0 |- !colspan=2|Total||52||0||1||0||colspan=2|\u2013||9||0||62||0 |- |rowspan=4|Celta Vigo||2017\u201318||rowspan=3|La Liga||38||0||3||0||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||41||0 |- |2018\u201319||31||0||1||0||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||32||0 |- |2019\u201320||17||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||17||0 |- !colspan=2|Total||86||0||4||0||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||90||0 |- |rowspan=3|Napoli||2019\u201320||rowspan=2|Serie A||14||0||1||0||1||0||colspan=2|\u2013||16||0 |- ||2020\u201321||3||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||3||0 |- !colspan=2|Total||17||0||1||0||1||0||0||0||19||0 |- !colspan=3|Career total||261||6||10||0||7||0||9||0||287||6 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=5|Slovakia |2016||1||0 |- |2017||6||2 |- |2018||7||0 |- |2019||8||1 |- |2020||2||0 |- !colspan=2|Total!!24!!3 |} ==Honours== AS Tren\u010d\u00edn *Slovak Super Liga: 2014\u201315 *Slovak Cup: 2014\u201315 Napoli * Coppa Italia: 2019\u201320 Slovakia *King's Cup: 2018 ==References== ==External links== *Stanislav Lobotka on FC Nordsj\u00e6lland *Corgo\u0148 Liga profile * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Slovak footballers Category:Slovakia international footballers Category:Slovakia youth international footballers Category:Slovakia under-21 international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:AS Tren\u010d\u00edn players Category:AFC Ajax players Category:FC Nordsj\u00e6lland players Category:RC Celta de Vigo players Category:S.S.C.
