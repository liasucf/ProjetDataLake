    "text": "Doliwa COA.Jan of the Doliwa coat of arms (died 17 March 1335) was Bishop of Pozna\u0144 from 1324 - 1335. Little is known about his youth. We know that before taking over the bishop's throne in Pozna\u0144 he was the office of the Archdiocese of Pozna\u0144. In July 1324, the Pozna\u0144 chapter elected him another bishop. This election was approved by Janis\u0142aw - Archbishop of Gniezno, who made episcopal ordination in the autumn of the same year in Sochaczew. Belonging to the Doliw\u00f3w family, Jan belonged to the trusted king W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u0141okietek. In the last months of 1324, Bishop Jan sent food to reinforce Pyzdry, and in June 1325 he belonged to the signatories of a covenant between the king and the West Pomeranian princes against Brandenburg in Nak\u0142o. In the same year, Pope John XXII appointed him the conservator of the Owi\u0144ska monastery, ordering him also to extort Prince Boles\u0142aw III the Spendable to separate the Duchy of Legnica's brother. In February 1326 Jan took part in the synod of the Gniezno metropolis, and in 1329 during \u0141okietek's stay at the Pozna\u0144 castle, he belonged to his immediate surroundings. In March 1331, the bishop, together with the Archbishop of Gniezno and the Cracow bishop, were appointed by the Pope to be the executors of the atonement to be given to the Che\u0142mno bishopric for the losses suffered, and in the event of a refusal they had the right to lay a curse on the order. In July of the same year, the Teutonic invasion ravaged the bishop's estate - destroying S\u0142upca and many villages belonging to the bishop, as well as many other cities in Greater Poland, such as Pyzdry, \u015aroda Wielkopolska and Kostrzyn, where churches were burnt. In the Warsaw trial, the court found that the damage, without the temptation of the temples, amounted to 8,200 silver fines. After the death of \u0141okietek, the bishop concelebrated the coronation mass of Casimir the Great. During his term of office, the parish church in Krer\u00f3w was founded, the estate of the bishops lying in both Greater Poland and Mazovia was merged, several villages were located, and a privilege for millers in the estate of the diocese was issued. The modern bishop calendar of W\u0142oc\u0142awek described him as a good and generous man, while Jan D\u0142ugosz showed him in a negative way, accusing him of extravagance and lack of care for those in need. ==References== Category:Bishops of Pozna\u0144 Category:Year of birth unknown Category:14th- century births Category:1335 deaths Category:14th-century Roman Catholic bishops ",
