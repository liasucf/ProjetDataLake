Underway again 10 days later, she carried troops to Guadalcanal and promptly returned to the West Coast, reaching Seattle 20 January 1945. Following a round-trip voyage during February to Honolulu and back to San Francisco, the busy transport made a round-trip voyage between 17 March and 22 May, carrying troops from San Francisco to the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, New Guinea, Leyte, and the Admiralties.

Touching Manila 2 September, the ship departed Tacloban 15 September for San Pedro, California, arriving 1 October. As part of the post-war \"Magic-Carpet\" fleet, she, between 1 November and 29 July 1946, made six troop-rotation voyages out of San Pedro and Seattle to Japan, Korea, Okinawa, and Pearl Harbor. General O. H. Ernst returned to San Francisco from the Far East 29 July 1946, decommissioned there 15 August, and was returned to the WSA the same day. She was then transferred to the Transportation Service of the U.S. Army. USAT General O. H. Ernst made at least one trip from the Philippines, arriving in San Francisco on 30 September 1946.
