St. Vincent's Place was designated a California Historic Landmark (No.567) on Feb. 25, 1957. St. Vincent's College was started by Vincentian Fathers in 1865 and was the first College in Southern California. St. Vincent's Place is located at St. Vincent's Court at 7th Street and Broadway in the City of Los Angeles in Los Angeles County. St. Vincent's College became L.A. College in 1911 and Loyola Marymount University in 1917.Cal, Parks Marker, 567, St. Vincent's Place Saint Vincent's College used the Downtown Los Angeles site from 1868 to 1887.

In 1865, the Vincentian Fathers were commissioned by Bishop Thaddeus Amat y Brusi to found St. Vincent's College for boys in Los Angeles. Father John Asmuth, was the first President Rector. Classes were held for two years in the Lugo Adobe on the east side of the Plaza while a new building was being finished. The historic home, aptly donated by Don Vicente Lugo, was one of few two-story adobes then in town. The house stood in the empty lot across Alameda Street between the Plaza and Union Station, (near Olvera Street). After two years, the college and school moved into a new, brick building several blocks south by the lower plaza, Pershing Square. Later, the brick building was replaced with a larger one in stone that became a familiar landmark for its stately, central tower topped by a mansard roof. The property took up the block bounded by Fort (Broadway), 6th, Hill, and 7th streets. When St. Vincent's later moved to a new campus, the old building became US Army Headquarters, and in 1907, the large Bullock\u2019s department store was built and operated here until 1983. Today, the site is in the heart of Los Angeles's Jewelry District, encompassing St. Vincent Court.
