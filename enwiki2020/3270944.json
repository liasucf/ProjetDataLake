He played 220 games for the club between 2001 and 2013, as a hard-running inside midfielder. Kerr was born and raised in Perth, Western Australia. His father Roger also played professional football, while his sister Samantha plays professional soccer. Kerr was recruited to West Coast with the 18th pick in the 2000 National Draft. He finished runner-up in the 2001 AFL Rising Star, and in 2003, aged 20, won the Goal of the Year award. Kerr placed in the top three of the Brownlow Medal in three consecutive seasons from 2005 to 2007, notably finishing runner-up to teammate Ben Cousins in 2005 by a single vote. He played in a premiership in 2006 (after a grand final loss the previous year), and was also named in the 2007 All-Australian team. Kerr suffered from injuries later in his career, eventually retiring from AFL football at the end of the 2013 season. ==Early life and family== Kerr was born in Perth, Western Australia, to Roxanne (n\u00e9e Regan) and Roger Kerr. His mother was born in Australia, while his father was born to an Anglo-Indian family in Calcutta. Roger played professional football in the 1980s, appearing for East Fremantle in the WAFL and briefly also for Port Adelaide in the SANFL. Kerr's younger sister Samantha also grew up playing football, but switched to soccer at the age of twelve. Sam grew into one of the world's top players, captaining Australia internationally for The Matildas and domestically in both the W-League and the American National Women's Soccer League (NWSL), winning multiple league MVP and Golden Boot titles in both.Why Perth Glory star Sam Kerr snubbed AFLW for W-League Kerr and his sister are also more distantly related to two other famous West Australian footballers, Con Regan and Shaun McManus.Derby to be McManus' final game Kerr attended Aquinas College, Perth, where he met future teammate Quinten Lynch and several other future AFL players.

He won Goal of the Year in 2003 and was widely known as one of the toughest players in the AFL. In 2005, Kerr almost provided one of the biggest upsets in Brownlow Medal history when he led the count towards the later rounds and finished second to favourite, teammate Ben Cousins. In 2006, he came third in the Brownlow Medal count with 22 votes; however, he was ineligible due to a striking charge against Hawthorn's Sam Mitchell in Round 14. He was also a part of the Eagles' 2006 premiership side and still managed to receive 20 disposals during the game, despite playing with detached ligaments in his foot.

His physical strength was further demonstrated in Round 1 against the Sydney Swans when he was able to successfully tackle and take down the far bigger Barry Hall in the goalsquare. Kerr re-signed with the Eagles after weeks of speculation over his future during the 2009 season. In Round 10 of the same season, after an appeal by the Eagles the decision was upheld by the AFL tribunal, Kerr was suspended for one week for striking Carlton's Marc Murphy,. In 2010, Kerr seriously injured his hamstring in the West Coast Eagles' Round 4 win over Essendon, which ended his season.
