    "text": "The intensity \\lambda of a counting process is a measure of the rate of change of its predictable part. If a stochastic process \\\\{N(t), t\\ge 0\\\\} is a counting process, then it is a submartingale, and in particular its Doob-Meyer decomposition is :N(t) = M(t) + \\Lambda(t) where M(t) is a martingale and \\Lambda(t) is a predictable increasing process. \\Lambda(t) is called the cumulative intensity of N(t) and it is related to \\lambda by :\\Lambda(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda(s)ds. ==Definition== Given probability space (\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\mathbb{P}) and a counting process \\\\{N(t), t\\ge 0\\\\} which is adapted to the filtration \\\\{\\mathcal{F}_t, t\\ge 0\\\\}, the intensity of N is the process \\\\{\\lambda(t), t\\ge 0\\\\} defined by the following limit: : \\lambda(t) = \\lim_{h\\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{h} \\mathbb{E}[N(t+h) - N(t) | \\mathcal{F}_t] . The right-continuity property of counting processes allows us to take this limit from the right.Aalen, O. (1978). Nonparametric inference for a family of counting processes. The Annals of Statistics, 6(4):701-726. ==Estimation== In statistical learning, the variation between \\lambda and its estimator \\hat{\\lambda} can be bounded with the use of oracle inequalities. If a counting process N(t) is restricted to t\\in [0,1] and n i.i.d. copies are observed on that interval, N_1, N_2, \\ldots, N_n , then the least squares functional for the intensity is : R_n(\\lambda) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\lambda(t)^2dt - \\frac{2}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\int_{0}^{1}\\lambda(t)dN_i(t) which involves an Ito integral. If the assumption is made that \\lambda(t) is piecewise constant on [0,1], i.e. it depends on a vector of constants \\beta = (\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\ldots, \\beta_m) \\in \\R_+^m and can be written : \\lambda_\\beta = \\sum_{j=1}^m \\beta_j \\lambda_{j,m}, \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; \\lambda_{j,m} = \\sqrt{m} \\mathbf{1}_{(\\frac{j-1}{m}, \\frac{j}{m}]} , where the \\lambda_{j,m} have a factor of \\sqrt{m} so that they are orthonormal under the standard L^2 norm, then by choosing appropriate data-driven weights \\hat{w}_j which depend on a parameter x>0 and introducing the weighted norm : \\|\\beta\\|_{\\hat{w}} = \\sum_{j=2}^m\\hat{w}_j|\\beta_j - \\beta_{j-1}| , the estimator for \\beta can be given: : \\hat{\\beta} = \\arg\\min_{\\beta\\in \\R_+^m} \\left\\\\{R_n(\\lambda_\\beta) + \\|\\beta\\|_{\\hat{w}}\\right\\\\} . Then, the estimator \\hat{\\lambda} is just \\lambda_{\\hat{\\beta}}. With these preliminaries, an oracle inequality bounding the L^2 norm \\|\\hat{\\lambda} - \\lambda\\| is as follows: for appropriate choice of \\hat{w}_j(x), : \\|\\hat{\\lambda} - \\lambda\\|^2 \\le \\inf_{\\beta \\in \\R_+^m} \\left\\\\{ \\|\\lambda_\\beta - \\lambda\\|^2 + 2\\|\\beta\\|_{\\hat{w}} \\right\\\\} with probability greater than or equal to 1-12.85e^{-x} .Alaya, E., S.
