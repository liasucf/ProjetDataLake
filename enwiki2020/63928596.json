Jaime Meregalli. The museum was moved a number of times in its early years, first to Air Base No. 1 in Carrasco and shortly thereafter to the Cilindro Municipal in downtown Montevideo. It became the Colonel Jaime Meregalli Aeronautical Museum on 17 March 1993. On 4 December 1997, the museum suffered a fire which damaged a number of aircraft in the collection. Eventually, in 2013, it was moved to Carrasco International Airport. == Collection == * Beechcraft AT-11 Kansan * Beechcraft T-34B Mentor * Bell UH-1B Iroquois * Bell UH-1H Iroquois * Bleriot XI * Castaibert VI * Castaibert VI * Cessna A-37B Dragonfly * Curtiss-Wright SNC-1 Falcon * de Havilland DH.60 Gipsy Moth * de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk * DFS SG 38 Schulgleiter * Douglas DC-3 * Fairchild PT-19 * Farman * FMA IA 58 Pucar\u00e1 * Focke-Wulf Fw 44 J * Hiller OH-23F Raven * Lockheed 18 Lodestar * Lockheed F-80C Shooting Star * Lockheed T-33A * Neybar N.1 * North American AT-6G Texan * North American B-25 Mitchell * Piper AE-1 * Potez 25 A.2 * Ryan Navion * Santos-Dumont 14-bis \u2013 Replica * Stinson 108-3 == References == == Further reading == * * == External links == * Official website * Association of Friends of the Aeronautical Museum Category:Aerospace museums Category:Museums in Uruguay ",
