    "text": "SLC45A4 is a member of the SLC45 family of solute carriers. Analysis of the protein function in a recombinant yeast expression assay show that it can: (i) transport a disaccharide,sucrose, as well simple sugars such as glucose and fructose (ii) perform secondary active transport in a proton-dependent manner. It is associated with sugar transport in the spermatozoa. Additionally, it has been itdentified as a necessary component in the cell death caused of the compound paraquat. == References == Category:Solute carrier family ",
