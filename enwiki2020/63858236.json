Prior to this, Lesotho was the last country in Africa to have no reported COVID-19 cases during the global pandemic.

Arriving travellers were to be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival. Prime Minister Thomas Thabane announced a three-week lock down from midnight 29 March. Lesotho began sending its samples to South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases for testing. ==Timeline== ===May 2020=== Lesotho began lifting some aspects of the lockdown from 5 May.
