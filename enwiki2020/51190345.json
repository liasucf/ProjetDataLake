Along with his brother, Balwinder Singh Bains, he established the Lok Insaaf Party and made an alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party for the 2017 Punjab Legislative Assembly election. Bains also contested as an independent candidate from Ludhiana in 2014 general elections and gathered 2,10,917 votes. They left the AAP alliance in March 2018 following AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal issuing a public apology to Bikram Singh Majithia, having earlier accused him of being the kingpin of the illegal drug trade in Punjab. In December 2018, Lok Insaaf Party along with Punjab Ekta Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Punjab Front formed the Punjab Democratic Alliance, which contested the 2019 Indian general election in Punjab on all 13 Lok Sabha seats. ==Controversy== Bains' image as a public representative has often been marred by his flagrant displays of indecent behaviour. In December 2016, Bains and a group of men lifted the toll barrier at the Ladhowal Toll Plaza, allowing people to drive through the toll without paying. http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/nation/stranded-mla-bains-lifts-toll- barrier/341128.html In September 2019, Bains was booked for intimidation and use of profanities against the Deputy Commissioner of Gurdaspur district.

Amidst the discouraging and unthoughtful remarks of Bains, his security was temporarily withdrawn to make him a bit more empathetic towards police personnel - who were tolling day in and day out to keep the public safe while putting their own lives at risk during COVID pandemic. https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2020/04/14/punjab-police-withdraw-security- for-ludhiana-mla-who-justified-nihang-attack-on-cops.html ==Personal life== Bains' brother Balwinder Singh Bains is also an Independent member of the Punjab Legislative Assembly. ==External links== * Member of Legislative Assembly == References == Category:People from Punjab, India Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Punjab, India MLAs 2017\u2013 Category:Members of the Punjab Legislative Assembly ",
