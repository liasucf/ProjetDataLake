    "text": "Grande Prairie-Wapiti is provincial electoral district in northwestern Alberta, Canada. It is one of 87 mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using the first past the post method of voting. The electoral district was created in the 1993 boundary redistribution from the old Grande Prairie electoral district and significantly modified in the 2017 redistribution. The district and its antecedent have been a stronghold for conservative candidates in recent decades. The representative for this district is United Conservative Travis Toews. He won election for the first time in 2017. To date there have been four representatives who have held the district. The riding takes its name from the City of Grande Prairie and the Wapiti River. ==Geography== While a predominantly rural riding, Grande Prairie-Wapiti includes a few neighbourhoods on the east side of the City of Grande Prairie (including Cobblestone, Countryside, Crystal Heights, Crystal Landing, Hillside, Ivy Lake, and Smith). Four small towns are also located in the riding - Beaverlodge, Hythe, Sexsmith, and Wembley. The bulk of the riding's area is made up of rural municipalities, including almost all of the County of Grande Prairie No. 1 and a portion of the Municipal District of Greenview No. 16. The riding's Indigenous community includes the Horse Lake First Nation and the Wanyandie Flats East settlement of the unrecognized Aseniwuche Winewak Nation. Grande Prairie-Wapiti surrounds the riding of Grande Prairie and borders Central Peace-Notley to the north and east and West Yellowhead to the south. The riding's western boundary is the Alberta-British Columbia border. ==History== The electoral district was created in the 1993 boundary redistribution from the old Grande Prairie electoral district. It remained mostly unchanged in the 1997 and 2003 re-distributions. The Boundaries Commission proposed to abolish the district to create a completely urban Grande Prairie district but it changed its decision under public pressure. The 2010 distribution made minor changes to the border with Grande Prairie-Smoky in the city of Grande Prairie but stayed the same in the rural areas. ===Boundary history=== {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%;\" !colspan=4|57 Grande Prairie-Wapiti 2003 Boundaries |- !colspan=4|Bordering Districts |- !North !East !West !South |- |Dunvegan- Central Peace |Grande Prairie-Smoky |British Columbia boundary |West Yellowhead |- |colspan=2 align=center|riding map goes here |colspan=2 align=center|File:Whereisgrandeprariewapiti.png |- !colspan=4|Legal description from the Statutes of Alberta 2003, Electoral Divisions Act. |- |colspan=4|Starting at the intersection of the west boundary of the Province and the north boundary of Sec. 7 in Twp. 75, Rge. 13 W6; then 1. east along the north boundary of Secs. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 in the Twp. and the north boundary of Sec. 7 in Twp. 75, Rge. 12 W6 to the east boundary of the Sec.; 2. south along the east boundary to the north boundary of Sec. 5 in the Twp.; 3. east along the north boundary of Secs. 5, 4 and 3 in the Twp. to the eastboundary of Sec. 3 in the Twp.; 4. south along the east boundary to the north boundary of Twp. 74; 5. east along the north boundary to the east boundary of Sec. 2 in Twp. 75, Rge. 11 W6; 6. north along the east boundary to the north boundary of Sec. 12 in the Twp.; 7. east along the north boundary of Sec. 12 in Twp. 75, Rge. 11 W6 and east along the north boundary of Sec. 7, Rge. 10 in Twp. 75 to the east boundary of Sec. 18 in the Twp.; 8. north along the east boundary of Secs. 18 and 19 in the Twp. to the north boundary of Sec. 20 in the Twp.; 9. east along the north boundary of Secs. 20, 21 and 22 in the Twp. to the east boundary of Sec. 27 in the Twp.; 10. north along the east boundary to the north boundary of Sec. 26 in the Twp.; 11. east along the north boundary to the east boundary of Sec. 35 in the Twp.; 12. north along the east boundary to the north boundary of Twp. 75; 13. east along the north boundary to the east boundary of Sec. 33 in Twp. 75, Rge. 8 W6; 14. south along the east boundary of Secs. 33, 28, 21 and 16 in the Twp. to the north boundary of Sec. 10 in the Twp.; 15. east along the north boundary of Secs. 10, 11 and 12 in the Twp. and the north boundary of Secs. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 in Twp. 75, Rge. 7 W6 to the east boundary of Rge. 7 W6; 16. south along the east boundary to the north boundary of Twp. 72, Rge. 6 W6; 17. east along the north boundary of the Twp. to the intersection with the right bank of the Grande Prairie Creek; 18. downstream along the Grande Prairie Creek to the intersection with the Bear River; 19. downstream along the Bear River to the north Grande Prairie city boundary; 20. in a generally southerly, westerly and southerly direction along the city boundary to the centre line of 100 Avenue (Richmond Avenue); 21. east along the centre line of 100 Avenue to the Grande Prairie city boundary; 22. south and west along the city boundary to the centre line of the Alberta RailNet Inc.; 23. in a generally southerly direction along the centre line of the Alberta RailNet Inc. to the north boundary of Twp. 70; 24. east along the north boundary to the east boundary of Sec. 31 in Twp. 70, Rge. 5 W6; 25. south along the east boundary of Secs. 31, 30 and 19 in the Twp. to the right bank of the Wapiti River; 26. downstream along the right bank of the Wapiti River to the left bank of the Smoky River; 27. upstream along the left bank of the Smoky River to the north boundary of Twp. 58; 28. west along the north boundary to the west boundary of the Province; 29. north along the west boundary of the province to the starting point. |- |colspan=4|Note: |} {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%;\" !colspan=4|62 Grande Prairie-Wapiti 2010 Boundaries |- !colspan=4|Bordering Districts |- !North !East !West !South |- |Dunvegan- Central Peace-Notley |Grande Prairie-Smoky |British Columbia boundary |West Yellowhead |- |colspan=2 align=center|200px |colspan=2 align=center|200px |- !colspan=4|Legal description from the Statutes of Alberta 2010, Electoral Divisions Act. |- |colspan=4| |- |colspan=4|Note: |} ===Electoral history=== {| class=\"wikitable\" align=right !colspan=5|Members of the Legislative Assembly for Grande Prairie-Wapiti |- !Assembly !Years !colspan=\"2\"|Member !Party |- |align=\"center\" colspan=5|See Grande Prairie 1930-1993 |- |23rd |1993\u20131997 |rowspan=7 | |rowspan=2|Wayne Jacques |rowspan=7|Progressive Conservative |- |24th |1997\u20132001 |- |25th |2001\u20132004 |rowspan=2|Gordon Graydon |- |26th |2004\u20132008 |- |27th |2008\u20132012 |rowspan=4|Wayne Drysdale |- |28th |2012-2015 |- |rowspan=2|29th |2015\u20132017 |- |2017-2019 |rowspan=2 | |rowspan=2|United Conservative |- |30th |2019\u2013present |Travis Toews |} The electoral district was created in the 1993 boundary redistribution from the old Grande Prairie district.

The vote was designed to educate students and simulate the electoral process for persons who have not yet reached the legal majority. The vote was conducted in 80 of the 83 provincial electoral districts with students voting for actual election candidates. Schools with a large student body that reside in another electoral district had the option to vote for candidates outside of the electoral district then where they were physically located. {| class=\"wikitable\" | colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\"|2004 Alberta Student Vote results |- |colspan=\"2\"| Affiliation |Candidate |Votes |% |Allan Webber |193 |18.22% |NDP |Jerry MacDonald |190 |17.94% |Liberal |Cibylla Rakestraw |182 |17.19% |- |colspan=\"3\" align =\"right\"|Total |1,059 |100% |- |colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\"|Rejected, Spoiled and Declined |colspan=\"2\"|36 |} ===2012 election=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |colspan=\"5\" align=center|2012 Alberta Student Vote results |- |colspan=\"2\"| Affiliation |Candidate |Votes |% |Liberal | | |% |NDP |Paula Anderson | |% |- |colspan=\"3\" align=\"right\"|Total | |100% |} ==References== Category:Alberta provincial electoral districts Category:Grande Prairie ",
