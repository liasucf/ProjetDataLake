Dr. Munson was the first superintendent of the state-owned Northern Michigan Asylum founded in 1885 (later known as Traverse City Psychiatric Hospital, which closed in 1989). He donated a boarding house for use as a community hospital in 1915. The permanent James Decker Munson Hospital opened in 1925 and still exists today within the Munson hospital complex. In 1949, the hospital and its land were deeded from the state to a new private corporation, James Decker Munson Hospital, Inc. The hospital was renamed in 1964 to reflect its changing status as a regional referral center. Munson Medical Center became affiliated with Kalkaska Memorial Health Center in 1976 through a management agreement. Munson Healthcare was officially organized as a system of health care providers in 1985 when Paul Oliver Memorial Hospital in Frankfort affiliated with Munson Medical Center. The system now includes Charlevoix Area Hospital, Mercy Hospital Grayling, Mercy Hospital Cadillac, Otsego Memorial Hospital in Gaylord, and West Shore Medical Center in Manistee. Munson Healthcare employs more than 5,500 people. ==References== Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1925 Category:Traverse City, Michigan Category:Hospitals in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Grand Traverse County, Michigan Category:Companies based in Grand Traverse County, Michigan Category:Medical and health organizations based in Michigan Category:Hospital networks in the United States Category:Trauma Center ",
