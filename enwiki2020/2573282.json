The Coachella Valley National Wildlife Refuge is contained within the Coachella Valley Preserve, and all are in the Colorado Desert section of the Sonoran Desert and adjacent to the Lower Colorado River Valley region. ==California Fan Palm oasis== The Indio Hills Palms Park Property is managed by the California Department of Parks and Recreation. The Coachella Valley Preserve, a 2,206-acre (8.93 km\u00b2) area, is maintained by the non-profit Nature Conservancy and is one of the few in the desert with an oasis fed by natural springs that supports the only California native palm, the Washingtonia filifera, or California Fan Palm. The San Andreas Fault, visible from the valley floor as a line of greenery along the base of the hills, captures groundwater that nurtures the palms. The 1,000 Palms Oasis grove is easily reached by foot from the trailhead.http://coachellavalleypreserve.org/fanpalm.html . accessed 6/20/2010 ==Desert pupfish== Naturally occurring artesian ponds provide habitat for the Desert pupfish, a small, endangered species of freshwater fish - roughly the size of a young goldfish.
