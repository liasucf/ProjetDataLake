    "text": "Samsung Galaxy S Duos 3 is a dual SIM Android smartphone, produced and marketed by Samsung Electronics, which serves as an immediate successor to the original Galaxy S Duos 2 of 2013. It was announced on August 2014 and was made available on the same month. In contrast with other dual sim Samsung models, this phone is a part of the high-end \"S\" series, this is why it is marketed as a part of the \"Galaxy S\" family. Despite being called as a direct successor to the original S Duos 2 phone, external and physical design of the model is identical to the original model, except for the menu button which is now replaced by the recent apps button and also placing emphasis on internal upgrades such as upgraded processor and an updated Android operating system. It is currently available in many Asian countries. ==Specifications== ===Hardware and Design=== The design of the S Duos 3 is the same as the design of the S Duos and S Duos 2. It a bit less rounded shape body with chrome finish edgesut the same polycarbonate chassis, faux metal trim and a removable rear cover, with premium texture finished. The S Duos 3 is available in Black, and White frost color finishes. The S Duos 3's screen is a 4.0-inch 233p TFT LCD panel, which is the same as that of the S Duos 2, but does not allow for automatic brightness and gamut adjustments due to lacking an ambient sensor like its predecessor. It also has the lack of Proximity Sensor. == Camera == The Galaxy S Duos 3 has a 5-megapixel camera with LED flash and a 0.3-megapixel front-facing camera. The rear camera has 7 shooting modes and can record video in 720p. Unlike entry-level dual SIM models from Samsung, the S Duos 3 like S Duos 2 is active on both SIMs all the time so it is ready to receive calls on either SIM when a call is not already in progress. Optionally it can receive two calls simultaneously, but this requires divert-on-not- reachable to be set up on each number and is subject to availability from the carrier and may incur additional charges. A limitation of the phone is that only one SIM can be active on UMTS (and therefore data) at a time and so it may be unsuitable for certain combinations of networks. The S Duos 3 also contains a 1500mAh Li-Ion removable battery. It lasts 4\u20135 hours of heavy usage and just over 3 hours of gaming. ===Software=== The S Duos 3 ships with Android 4.4.2 KitKat and Samsung's Updated TouchWiz Essence UX software. The S Duos 3 adds some of Galaxy S4's features such as Samsung proprietary widgets used by models bearing the same version of the OS. Custom ROMs such as AOSP 5.1 and CyanogenMod 12.1 by itigr, are available for updating to Android 5.1.1 Lollipop. == See also == * Comparison of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones * Comparison of smartphones * Samsung Galaxy S series == References == Category:Android (operating system) devices Category:Samsung mobile phones Category:Samsung Galaxy Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2014 Category:Mobile phones with user-replaceable battery ",
