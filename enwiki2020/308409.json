    "text": "Christian Kramp (8 July 1760 \u2013 13 May 1826) was a French mathematician, who worked primarily with factorials. Analyse des r\u00e9fractions astronomiques et terrestres, 1799 Christian Kramp's father was his teacher at grammar school in Strasbourg. Kramp studied medicine and graduated; however, his interests certainly ranged outside medicine, for in addition to a number of medical publications he published a work on crystallography in 1793. In 1795, France annexed the Rhineland area in which Kramp was carrying out his work and after this he became a teacher at Cologne (this city was French from 1794 to 1815), teaching mathematics, chemistry, and physics. Kramp could read and write in German and French. Kramp was appointed professor of mathematics at Strasbourg, the town of his birth, in 1809. He was elected to the geometry section of the French Academy of Sciences in 1817. As Bessel, Legendre and Gauss did, Kramp worked on the generalised factorial function which applied to non-integers. His work on factorials is independent of that of James Stirling and Vandermonde. He was the first to use the notation n! (Elements d'arithm\u00e9tique universelle, 1808). In fact, the more general concept of factorial was found at the same time by Arbogast. Kramp's function, a scaled complex error function, is today better known as the Faddeeva function. ==References== == External links == * Category:1760 births Category:1826 deaths Category:18th- century French mathematicians Category:19th-century French mathematicians Category:French people of German descent Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences ",
