    "text": "The State Fair Meadowlands (formerly the Meadowlands Fair) is a carnival held every summer at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The fair is held in the parking lot that surrounds the MetLife Stadium and runs for two weeks in late June and early July. It attracts over 300,000 visitors per year. Despite its name, it is not the official state fair of New Jersey; instead, that honor belongs to the Sussex County Farm and Horse Show, which earned the state fair moniker in 1999. Instead, the name for the Meadowlands event is a title sponsorship; State Fair Superstore, a large seasonal merchandise seller in Belleville, New Jersey, operates the carnival. There were cancellations in 1942\u201345 & 2020\\. ==List of attractions== === Family/Kiddie Rides === * Bumble Bee * Frog Hopper * Speedway * Go Gator * Jet Ski/Waverunner * Motorcycles * Quadrunners * VW Cars * Mini Bumper Boats * Merry-Go-Round * Double-Decker Carousel * Rockin' Tug * Wacky Worm * Fire Chief * Family Swinger * Happy Swing * Jungle of Fun * Tomb of Doom * Red Baron * Mini Himalaya * Mini-Indy * Rainbow Rock * Monkey Mayhem * Elephants * Safari Train * Construction Zone * Jalopy Junction === Thrill Rides === * Banzai * Bumper Cars * Cliffhanger * Crazy Mouse * Crazy Outback * Cuckoo Fun House * Darton Slide * Disko * Enterprise * Fireball * Giant Wheel * Gravitron * Haunted House Dark Ride * Haunted Mansion Dark Ride * Heavy Haulin\u2019 Inflate * Himalaya * Magic Maze * Mardi Gras Glasshouse * Musik Express * Raiders Funhouse * Ring of Fire * Rock & Roll Funhouse * Rock 'n Roll * Scooter * Sizzler * Sky Ride * Skyflyer * Space Roller * Spongebob Funhouse * Storybookland \u2013 Peter Pan's Palace * Super Slide * Tilt-A-Whirl * Tornado 3 * Wave Swinger * Zyklon == Other attractions == Other than the rides, there are free shows and events at the fair such as racing pigs, a petting zoo, a circus, a magic show, etc. The fair also displays fireworks on select nights. == Incidents == At around 11:30 PM on June 22, 2017, which was the opening night for the 2017 season of the fair, gunshots were fired on the fairgrounds.
