    "text": "The Valparola Pass () (el. 2168 m.) is a high mountain pass in the Dolomites in the province of Belluno in Italy. The pass lies a little west of Falzarego Pass. Before World War I, there was only a trail over the pass, but the area was heavily contended during the war. A remaining fort has been made into a museum. The pass is the divide between the watersheds of the Adige, which flows west into the Adriatic Sea and the Piave, which flows east. == Maratona dles Dolomites == The Valparola Pass is the last of seven Dolomites mountain passes riders cross in the annual Maratona dles Dolomites single-day bicycle race. ==See also== * List of highest paved roads in Europe * List of mountain passes Valparola ",
