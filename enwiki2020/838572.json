Henri-Joseph Harpignies (; June 28, 1819 \u2013 August 28, 1916) was a French landscape painter of the Barbizon school. ==Life== He was born at Valenciennes. His parents intended for him to pursue a business career, but his determination to become an artist was so strong that it conquered all obstacles, and he was allowed at the age of twenty-seven to enter Jean Achard's atelier in Paris. From this painter he acquired a groundwork of sound constructive draughtsmanship, which is so marked a feature of his landscape painting. After two years under this exacting teacher he went to Italy, whence he returned in 1850. During the next few years he devoted himself to the painting of children in landscape setting, and fell in with Corot and the other Barbizon masters, whose principles and methods are to a certain extent reflected in his own personal art. To Corot he was united by a bond of warm friendship, and the two artists went together to Italy in 1860. On his return, he scored his first great success at the Salon, in 1861, with his Lisi\u00e8re de bois sur les bords de l'Allier. After that year he was a regular exhibitor at the old Salon; in 1886 he received his first medal for Le Soir dans la campagne de Rome, which was acquired for the Luxembourg Gallery. Many of his best works were painted at H\u00e9risson in the central France region of Bourbonnais, as well as in the Nivernais and Auvergne regions. Among his chief pictures are: *Soir sur les bords de la Loire (1861) *Les Corbeaux (1865) *Le Soir (1866) *Le Saut-du-Loup (1873) *La Loire (1882) *Vue de Saint-Priv\u00e9 (1883). He also did some decorative work for the Paris Op\u00e9ra--the Vall\u00e9e d'Eg\u00e9rie panel, which he showed at the Salon of 1870. He had numerous students, among them \u00c9mile Appay (1876\u20131935), Jeanne Rongier, Jane Le Soudier (1885\u20131976), Louis-Alexandre Cabi\u00e9, Pierre Vignal, Raymond Verdun, and \u00c9mile Dardoize (1826\u20131901). ==References== Attribution * ==External links== * * Henri Harpignies on Artcyklopedia * 138 Henri Harpignies works on Paintingiant Category:1819 births Category:1916 deaths Category:People from Valenciennes Category:19th-century French painters Category:French male painters Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:French landscape painters Category:French watercolourists Category:19th-century French engravers Category:20th-century French engravers Category:Grand Officiers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur ",
