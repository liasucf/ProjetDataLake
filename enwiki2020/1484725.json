It is owned and operated by the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign and is named for former University of Illinois president Arthur Cutts Willard. == History == The airport was dedicated on 26 October 1945. Airline flights began in 1954. The terminal building built in 1960Urbana Courier clipping file was used until the present terminal was completed in 1987.University Office for Facilities Planning and Programs: Willard Airport By 1969 Willard was the second-busiest airport in the state of Illinois. After the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 many airlines found service to small airports to be inefficient, the price differential to airfares from major hub airports such as Chicago O'Hare grew, which limited demand for tickets from Willard and caused airlines to leave. Until 2014, the airport was home to the University of Illinois Institute of Aviation, a research and pilot training facility. The university trustees voted to shutter the institute in 2011 while allowing enrolled students to complete their studies. In 2013, the university agreed to transfer the pilot training function of the institute to Parkland College, a local community college. The university continues to operate the airport and provides an annual subsidy of $433,000 for its operations. Traffic at Willard airport declined significantly from 2005 to 2013. According to FAA published data, in CY2013 there were 84,853 passenger enplanements compared to 132,077 in 2005. Overall traffic also declined to 54,653 total Combined TRACON / Tower operations in CY 2013 compared to 123,341 in CY2005. The airport has had various problems with delays recently. In 2013, the airport ranked 285th out of 320 airports for on- time performance according to government statistics and was ranked 251st out of 324 airports for the first 11 months of 2014. The airport gained some notoriety for a January 21, 1998, incident in which Air Force One became stuck in mud, requiring a backup aircraft to transport President Bill Clinton from a speaking engagement at the University of Illinois' Assembly Hall. The pilot opted to enter the main taxiway from the ramp using a feeder taxiway with an unusually large angle. Due to the wide turn, the right main gear left the taxiway and slipped into the soft turf, causing the aircraft to be lodged in the mud. The Air Force dispatched backup aircraft SAM26000, which first entered service during the Kennedy Administration and would be retired later in 1998. == Facilities == Willard Airport covers and has three runways: * Runway 4/22: , concrete * Runway 14L/32R: , concrete with ILS * Runway 14R/32L: , asphalt The terminal has five gates. == Airlines and destinations == Terminal building at Willard Airport American Eagle has two daily flights (one on Saturdays) to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on 50-seat ERJs, four daily (three on Saturdays) ERJ flights to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, and twice daily non-stop to Charlotte Douglas International Airport on ERJ 140s.
