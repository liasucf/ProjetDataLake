His brother was Berthold Hochschild (1860\u20131928) who later founded the American Metal Company. Zachary worked as a youth for the Frankfurt metal company, Philipp Abraham Cohen and received in 1878, procuration or the authority to act on behalf of the company. In 1881, Hochschild along with his brother-in-law Leo Ellinger and Wilhelm Merton took over the activities of Philipp Abraham Cohen and co-founded Metallgesellschaft AG in Frankfurt with 2 million Marks in share capital. As Hochschild was a long term executive at Cohen, he was its sole member of the board. Responsibilities were divided: Hochschild focused on marketing, trading, and international activities; Merton was responsible for business strategy; and Ellinger for operations. Their main competition were the two other large metal trading companies of Germany: Aron Hirsch & Sohn in Halberstadt, and Beer, Sondheimer & Co in Frankfurt am Main, also closely held Jewish family companies. Although Metallgesellschaft was a joint stock company, it was operated like a family business with key positions allocated to long-time loyal employees who were gradually rewarded with stock in the company. He is credited with opening up the company to international sources of metals which satisfied German demand. In 1884, Hochschild sent his brother Berthold to the United States to establish an operation.Stack, Elizabeth.
