    "text": "Rutherglen (, , ) is a town in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, located immediately south-east of Glasgow \u2013 from its city centre \u2013 and directly south of the River Clyde. Having existed as a Lanarkshire burgh in its own right for more than 800 years, in 1975 Rutherglen lost its own local council and administratively became a component of the City of Glasgow District Council within the Strathclyde region (along with neighbouring Cambuslang). In 1996 the towns were reallocated to the South Lanarkshire council area.Rutherglen residents not interested in Glasgow return, Daily Record, 9 April 2017 ==History== Rutherglen received the status of Royal Burgh in 1126 by Royal Charter from King David I of ScotlandLocal and family history: Rutherglen - history in the making, South Lanarkshire Council who ruled from 1124 to 1153. It gradually diminished in importance as neighbouring Glasgow grew in power and size.The Statistical Account of Lanarkshire (page 373), Society for the Benefit of the Sons and Daughters of the Clergy, W.

Today there is a significant legacy of soluble chromium (VI) waste in the area.

The derivation may also however be Welsh, or Cumbric and mean \"the valley of Rydderch\". Rydderch \u2013 pronounced 'rutherch' \u2013 'ruther' as in 'brother' and 'ch' as in 'loch' \u2013 was one of the most famous kings associated with the Welsh-speaking kingdom which centred on Dumbarton. ==Governance== Rutherglen Town Hall ===Westminster=== A separate constituency in the Parliament of Scotland from the late 16th century, Rutherglen was a parliamentary burgh represented in the UK Parliament as a component of Glasgow Burghs constituency from 1708 to 1832, and as a component of Kilmarnock Burghs from 1832 to 1918. In 1918, the Rutherglen constituency was created, which became Glasgow Rutherglen in 1983. In 2005, Scottish constituencies for the UK parliament were reviewed with many new seats introduced, and the town is now within the Rutherglen and Hamilton West constituency. Following the 2019 election, Margaret Ferrier of the Scottish National Party is the local MP,Election 2019: Rutherglen & Hamilton West BBC News, 13 December 2019 replacing Gerard Killen of Scottish Labour who in 2017 had narrowly defeated incumbent Ferrier, herself originally elected in 2015. ===Holyrood=== In 1999, the Scottish Parliamentary constituency of Glasgow Rutherglen was created, with the same boundaries as the then UK parliamentary constituency. In 2011, The constituency was redrawn and renamed simply Rutherglen (although it also encompasses Cambuslang and Blantyre). Following the 2016 elections, Clare Haughey (SNP) is the MSP for Rutherglen. The defeated incumbent James Kelly (Labour) was elected as a list MSP for the Glasgow region which includes Rutherglen due to the town's proximity to the city.Boundary changes create new Rutherglen seat, but area remains in Glasgow region, Daily Record, 2 June 2010 All local representatives have strong personal ties to the area. ===South Lanarkshire Council=== Administratively, the historic town centre is within the Rutherglen Central and North ward of South Lanarkshire Council, which has a population of around 15,000. Taking another ward encompassing the southern parts of the town into consideration, its overall population was approximately 30,000 in 2016. With neighbouring Cambuslang's figures being very similar, the many services and amenities shared between the towns should provide for 60,000 residents, many assessed as living in economic hardship.Shock stats show Rutherglen has more unemployment, highest rate of alcohol and drug admissions and more social work referrals than anywhere else in South Lanarkshire, Daily Record, 19 December 2018 *Recent elections: **2003 South Lanarkshire Council election **2007 South Lanarkshire Council election **2012 South Lanarkshire Council election **2017 South Lanarkshire Council election ==Transport== Looking west on Main Street, showing bus lanes (2009) Rutherglen Burgh is served by Rutherglen railway station (opened in 1849), with and stations closer to southern parts of the town. There are also numerous bus links into Glasgow city centre or other destinations such as Hamilton, East Kilbride, Govanhill and Dennistoun, all services either running directly along the Main Street (which has dedicated public transport lanes for peak times) or close to it via Mill Street / Glasgow Road (A730) to the west or Stonelaw Road / Farmeloan Road (A749) to the east. Glasgow Corporation Tramways operated routes in the area from the early 1900s until the late 1950s. Completion of the M74 Extension in 2011 meant that there is a six-lane motorway bisecting the northern part of the town, allowing easier access to places such as Glasgow Airport and the English border. Some years after the project was completed, studies show that pollution levels on Rutherglen's densely populated Main Street were still measured consistently at dangerously high levels, despite forecasts that traffic levels on urban streets in areas served by the motorway would reduce.Rutherglen made an Air Quality Management Area after pollution levels exceed national guidelines, Daily Record, 14 December 2015Rutherglen named as pollution hotspot, Daily Record, 7 February 2018Rutherglen town centre listed as one of South Lanarkshire's worst areas for air pollution, Daily Record, 28 January 2020 ==Media== The local newspaper is the Rutherglen Reformer.

Southern Part. Top section, John Thomson's Atlas of Scotland, 1832 (National Library of Scotland) Since being granted Royal Burgh status by King David I in the 12th century, the town has grown considerably from its origins as little more than a single street, and although growth has been hampered to some extent by the proximity of the river to the north and the encroaching Glasgow urban sprawl to the west, it now covers a much larger area than the initial Burgh boundaries,OS National Grid Maps, 1944-1967, Explore georeferenced maps (National Library of Scotland) OS Six-inch 1st edition, 1843-1882, Explore georeferenced maps (National Library of Scotland) although the aforementioned restrictions mean its administrative centre with the majority of facilities and the highest population density is concentrated at the north of its overall territory rather than towards the geographic centre (neighbouring Cambuslang has a similar issue: its town centre is in the far west of its territory, with its boundaries with Rutherglen and the river preventing any expansion in those directions). Historic areas such as Farme Cross, Bankhead and Gallowflat have changed greatly over the years and the village of Burnside (which falls under the Rutherglen boundary but has its own Community Council) also expanded to share a single suburban settlement with its larger neighbour. More recent post-war developments at Newfield and Burnhill within the older part of town, plus those on the peripheries including Blairbeth, Cathkin, Eastfield, Fernhill, Spittal and Springhall have given the town a frequently changing character. Other than some shopping areas and the large industrial estates in Farme Cross and Shawfield, the neighbourhoods referred to are residential in type; the 1922 book Rutherglen Lore indicates a deliberate intention for the historic Burgh area to be encircled to the south by residential suburbs, while all land to its north would be dedicated to industry, and that remains the case a century later. ===Burgh (Main Street) and Clincarthill=== The Burgh area includes the old heart of the Royal Burgh of Rutherglen around the ancient and unusually wide, tree-lined Main Street and its environs, which have been designated a conservation area since 2008.Rutherglen Conservation Area: Character Appraisal, South Lanarkshire Council, 2008 It features several religious establishments, various pubs, shops and restaurants, historic and modern civic buildings and community facilities, all within a dense network of housing, mainly tenements.

As well as the clustering of pubs being explained by historic licensing arrangements, the proximity of Hampden Park and Celtic Park football stadiums also brings some occasional additional custom to the area, which to some extent also accounts for a high number of bookmakers around the Main Street.

The area has a distinctive character of its own, with plenty of remaining old sandstone tenements, villas and terraced houses from the late 19th and early 20th century, some on the incline accessible only via footpaths. A pedestrian overbridge across the busy Mill Street dual carriageway links Clincarthill with the Bankhead neighbourhood to its west.

South of Newfield and directly bordering the Glasgow district of King's Park, much of its street grid shares the same design of 1930s grey pebble-dashed cottage flats. In addition to an eponymous primary school on Bankhead Road,Newly-built \u00a38.8million Bankhead Primary School is a real class act, Daily Record, 9 June 2015 there is a small row of shops on Wallace Street beside the Mill Street overbridge leading to Clincarthill, and more on Curtis Avenue approaching Toryglen including the 100 Acres pub \u2013 an adaptation of 'Hundred Acre Hill', the historic name of the high ground overlooking the area to the west. A further selection of convenience stores is located on Castlemilk Road in the south-west of the area, adjoining King's Park and some of its amenities including its main church. These are known locally as the 'State shops' after the State Cinema, later a bingo venue, which was sited there near to King's Park Avenue, a prominent local landmark from the 1930s until its demolition in the early 21st century. There was previously also a small public library which closed in 2010 (although named King's Park Library, it was on the east side of the road and thus administered by South Lanarkshire Council from 1996).Flats plan for former library, Daily Record, 4 January 2012 One surviving feature of Bankhead's rural past is the premises of Mitchell's Farm (earlier known as Crosshill Farm) dating back to at least the mid-19th century, although its fields on a steep slope were converted into the Cityford housing development around 1990. The Bankhead coal mine was a short distance south-west of the farm. The southern end of Bankhead Road terminates at another cluster of small shops and Croftfoot railway station, with a pedestrian footpath leading to the Croftfoot neighbourhood of Glasgow, and the Spittal neighbourhood of Rutherglen. There is another footpath further west at Castlemilk Road, but vehicles cannot use these routes, instead having to travel around Spittal, a detour of from Bankhead Road at Croftfoot Station, or via Menock Road, a detour of from Castlemilk Road at King's Park Avenue, to reach the same point on the other side of the tracks. Landemer Drive, Quigley's estate, Bankhead Main entrance to Rutherglen Cemetery Once a private estate based around Bankhead House (owned by several generations of the Quigley family, many of whom were doctors), the land between Bankhead and Mill Street at Overtoun Park became a small housing estate in the early 1970s.Car park will ease problems in Quigley's, Daily Record, 24 April 2013 The town's once-important corn mill from which the road name derives was located a short way east of Bankhead House, close to the Quigleys Community Hall of today \u2013 a fact commemorated nearby in a plaque placed on the old stone wall of the estate, also noting the completion of the upgrading of that section of the road in 1993 (Average Speed traffic cameras were installed there in 2018 to combat dangerous driving).Average speed cameras to go live in Rutherglen accident hotspot here is what you need to know, Evening Times, 15 September 2018 The mill was powered from the Cityford Burn that flows through most of this side of Rutherglen and is visible here for some distance, running north then west to a small pond at Bankhead Road, known as the 'Paddy' (paddling pool),Exhibition looking back at Bankhead Pond set for Rutherglen Library, Daily Record, 14 March 2012 although this is somewhat overgrown and distended and is no longer popular with locals for this recreational purpose as it once was.Bankhead Pond Memories, Rutherglen Heritage Society, 2020 Flooding in the area in 2004 resulted in extensive remediation works to prevent a repeat.

Built on a mound used as farmland (the farmhouse was located at the junction of Carrick Road and Bute Terrace), the estate was constructed in an oval pattern of streets, with its primary school built at the highest point in the centre (completed in 1955). A development of prefabs on the flatter land to the west were replaced by angular apartment blocks in the early 1970s (as also occurred at other locations including Burnhill, Bankhead and at North Halfway in nearby Cambuslang). A new community centre was built in the early 21st century, close to the older small wooden church. There are also local amenities such as shops \u2013 including Post Office \u2013 on Kyle Square and a pub- restaurant, 'The Croft',Home, The Croft situated exactly on the local authority boundary at Croftfoot. Two small burns run on either side of Spittal's housing, bordered by grassed areas \u2013 one burn runs from Castlemilk Park and the other from further east via High Burnside, both originating on the north slopes of the Cathkin Braes; these waters converge north of Spittal, flowing north to Bankhead and on to Shawfield and the Clyde where it is marked as the Cityford Burn, but colloquially known as the Jenny Burn.Glasgow, Castlemilk House, Greater Glasgow: An Illustrated Architectural Guide, Sam Small, 2008 (quoted at Canmore) In 2016, the area's recreation fields bordering Croftfoot, which had been bequeathed to the community 'in perpetuity' in the 1930s but had been allowed to fall into disrepair over a number of years, were subject to planning applications for new housing.Plans for housing development on former Rutherglen/Croftfoot football parks move a step closer, Daily Record, 2 August 2016 The Croftfield Park development was completed about three years later.Houses are selling fast at Croftfield Park, Daily Record, 13 September 2017, via PressReader A replacement modern AstroTurf football field was added adjacent to the primary school in 2019, although this was several years after the original fields were abandoned and six years after the school itself was replaced (built on its original red blaes pitch),Plans for new Spittal Primary are given the go-ahead, Daily Record, 25 January 2012 as the old buildings became the temporary home for Bankhead, St Mark's and Burnside Primaries while their facilities were also renewed.Old Spittal to go, Rutherglen Reformer, 23 November 2016, via PressReader Just south of Spittal is Kirkriggs School, a Special educational needs facility which is under Glasgow City Council control.Welcome to our school, Kirkriggs School ===Blairbeth and Fernhill=== ====Blairbeth==== Drumilaw Road, the main vehicular access to Blairbeth from the north Blairbeth is a small 1950s local authority housing scheme of tenements and modest terraced houses, generally still with the same appearance as at the time of its construction.

The designated non-denominational school for the locality is Spittal Primary, although some children attend Burnside Primary which is equally close. Also bordering High Crosshill and High Burnside, many of the hillside streets have views over Rutherglen and Glasgow. A large flat grass field to the west of the neighbourhood was popular in the summer months for football, buts its size was greatly reduced by a junction re-alignment in 2016, connecting Croftfoot Road and Blairbeth Road - previously a staggered junction via Fernhill Road with single lanes causing considerable congestion at peak times - into a single crossroads with filter lanes, as part of the Cathkin Relief Road works.
