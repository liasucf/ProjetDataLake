    "text": "Carnegie Caulfield Cycling Club is a leading Australian cycling club based in the Eastern suburbs of Melbourne. First established in the early 1900s, it has a long history of road, criterium and track racing. As a club, Carnegie- Cauflied has won multiple cycling premierships at both senior and junior level. Its members have gone on to win multiple National and World Championships as well as participate at the Olympics. ==Club history== Originally known as the Carnegie Amateur Cycling club, the club traces its history back over 100 years. Early races were typically handicap races over 10\u201360-mile road courses, often starting at the Rosstown Hotel before making their way along Dandenong Road. The club also played a big part in the local community, in particular through its support for the Oakleigh Carnival. Around this time, the club formalised the first incarnation of its junior program recorded in 1931 after early success in the Victoria Club Premierships. At the same time, Carnegie's senior team also won major races. During the 1950s, Carnegie track racing, held at its local track Packer Park, drew crowds of up to 4000 spectators watching some of Australia's best amateur and professional riders. The quality of Carnegie's track racing was a key driver behind the push by the NSW Cycling Union to move the 1956 Melbourne Olympics Track Cycling programme to the Carnegie velodrome after delays in the resurfacing of the Olympic Park Velodrome. Although the push did not succeed \u2013 the Olympic Track program was held at Olympic Park \u2013 subsequent issues with the Olympic Track created a second push to move the Australian Titles (to be held after the Olympics) to the Carnegie Velodrome. Club logo circa 1980 Carnegie's track racing program become even more popular during the 1960s and 70's with the Caulfield Cup on Wheels being the leading race for amateur cyclists in Melbourne, often being held on the same night as the Melbourne Cup on Wheels, an equivalent race for professional cyclists. In 1984, Carnegie Amateurs Cycling Club merged with Brighton-South Caulfield Professional Cyclists Association to form Carnegie Caulfield Cycling Club.
