The statue was discovered at Abusir in Metjen's mastaba by the Egyptian expedition (1842\u20131845) under the direction of the Prussian scholar Karl Richard Lepsius.Richard Lepsius\u02d0 Denkm\u00e4ler aus \u00c4gypten und \u00c4thiopien nach den Zeichnungen der von Seiner Majest\u00e4t dem K\u00f6nige von Preu\u00dfen Friedrich Wilhelm IV nach diesen L\u00e4ndern gesendeten und in den Jahren 1842\u20131845. ausgef\u00fchrten wissenschaftlichen Expedition auf Befehl Seiner Majest\u00e4t herausgegeben und erl\u00e4utert. 13 vols. Berlin: Nicolaische Buchhandlung 1849, Part II, p. 120, a-c The statue and the mastaba were bought to the museum in Berlin. The statue is an early example of an Egyptian statue belonging to a private individual. Metjen lived at the end of the Third and the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty (around 2600 BC). The statue is made of granite and about 47 cm high. It is datable under king Snofru. Metjen is shown sitting on a chair. His right hand forms a fist and is placed on the chest, the left hand is placed on the leg. Metjen wears short curly hair. On the sides of the chair are inscriptions providing Metjen's name and his titles.G\u00fcnther Roeder\u02d0 Aegyptische Inschriften aus den K\u00f6niglichen Museen zu Berlin, Berlin 1913, p. 68 online The statue was once placed in the serdab of the mastaba and was therefore only visible via a small hole in the wall. The statue belongs to the small group of private statues datable to the Egyptian Third Dynasty and earliest Fourth Dynasty. They are all made of hard stone and appear somehow clumsy and heavy. The statue of Metjen is the latest one of them.W. Stevenson Smith\u02d0 The art and architecture of Ancient Egypt, revised by William Kelly Simpson, Harmondsworth, New York, Victoria 1981, . p. 67 The statue belongs therefore stylistically between those of the Third Dynasty and those of the Fourth Dynasty. Its head is slightly too large, the small dimensions and the hieroglyphic texts in raised relief connects the statue with the Third Dynasty. Typical for the Fourth Dynasty are the positions of the hands and the chair, that does no longer copies a real chair as in the Third Dynasty.Christiane Ziegler\u02d0 Metjen seated, in Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York , pp. 208-209, no. 28 == References == == External links == * Category:3rd- millennium BC works Category:Archaeological artifacts Category:Sculptures of the Berlin State Museums Category:Sculptures of ancient Egypt Category:Sculptures of men in Germany Category:Statues in Germany Category:Egyptological objects of the Berlin State Museums ",
