    "text": "The seventh season of the sitcom Mom began on September 26, 2019 and concluded on April 16, 2020 on CBS in the United States. The season is produced by Chuck Lorre Productions and Warner Bros. Television, with series creators Chuck Lorre, Eddie Gorodetsky and Gemma Baker serving as executive producer. The season finished with 20 episodes, a reduction from the planned 22 episodes that was forced by the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the final season to feature Anna Faris as Christy. Christy (Anna Faris) has gone back to school and is pursuing her dream of becoming a lawyer, while Bonnie (Allison Janney) attempts to have a healthy romantic relationship with her husband, Adam (William Fichtner). Through it all, Christy and Bonnie rely on their support system from AA, including the wise Marjorie (Mimi Kennedy), the wealthy and sometimes misguided Jill (Jaime Pressly), the overly emotional Wendy (Beth Hall), and the loudmouth but sweet Tammy (Kristen Johnston), who was upgraded to series regular status for this season. Collectively, they help each other stay sober in the face of whatever life throws at them. The episodes are usually titled with two odd topics that are mentioned in that episode. Season seven of Mom aired Thursdays in the United States at 9:00 p.m. after The Unicorn in the first half of the season and Man with a Plan in the second half. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Anna Faris as Christy Plunkett * Allison Janney as Bonnie Plunkett * Mimi Kennedy as Marjorie Armstrong-Perugian * Jaime Pressly as Jill Kendall * Beth Hall as Wendy Harris * William Fichtner as Adam Janikowski * Kristen Johnston as Tammy Diffendorf ===Recurring=== * Will Sasso as Andy * Rainn Wilson as Trevor Wells * French Stewart as Chef Rudy * Lauri Johnson as Beatrice * Mary Pat Gleason as Mary * Charlie Robinson as Mr. Munson * Reggie de Leon as Paul ===Special guest stars=== * Kate Micucci as Patty * Reginald Veljohnson as Jim * John Ratzenberger as Stan * Paget Brewster as Veronica Stone * Kathleen Turner as Cookie * Peter Onorati as Wayne * Courtney Thorne-Smith as Sam ===Guest stars=== * Jim Turner as Rick * Phil Buckman as Marv * Chiquita Fuller as Taylor * Bernie Kopell as Ken * Jayson Blair as DJ * Andrew Caldwell as Todd * Lauren Weedman as Angela * Mario Cantone as Sean * Kirstin Eggers as Janice * Parisa Fakhri as Laurie * Tim Chiou as Kevin * Keone Young as George * Anna Maria Horsford as Eve Ferguson * Larry Joe Campbell as Mike * Michelle Arthur as Belinda * Wallace Langham as Jerry * Jennifer Marsala as Amber * Karen Malina White as Natalie * Ted McGinley as Dr. Berenson * Tracy Vilar as Lorraine * Patricia Bethune as Wanda * Gillian Vigman as Melanie * Miriam Flynn as Arlene * Carolyn Hennesy as Professor Winslow * Isla Rose Burton as Baby Sofia * Virginia Montero as Marta * Amy Pietz as Rebecca ==Episodes== ==Ratings== ==References== Category:Mom (TV series) Category:2019 American television seasons Category:2020 American television seasons ",
