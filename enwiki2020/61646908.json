When he went to the home of his brother Minamoto no Yorinobu, Kid\u014dmaru was caught at the toilet. Yorimitsu said that Yorinobu was careless, so they should restrain the oni with chains, and stayed at Yorinobu's house for that night. Kid\u014dmaru easily tore off those chains, and with a grudge against Yorimitsu, looked at his bed and kept watch. Yorimitsu noticed this and told a servant, \"tomorrow, I will make a visit to the Kurama temple.\" Kid\u014dmaru then went ahead to Kurama, killed one free-ranging cattle at the Ichihara field, hid inside its body, and waited for Yorimitsu to come. However, Yorimitsu saw through this, and Watanabe no Tsuna upon receiving command from Yorimitsu shot through the cattle with a bow and arrow. It is said that Kid\u014dmaru appeared from inside the cow and tried to slash at Yorimitsu, but Yorimitsu struck down Kid\u014dmaru with a single strike. In the y\u014dkai pictures collection, the Konjaku Hyakki Sh\u016bi by Toriyama Sekien, under the title of \"Kid\u014d,\" it depicts Kid\u014dmaru in the snow wearing the skin of a cattle waiting for Yorimitsu to come. Although Kid\u014dmaru is widely known from the Kokon Chomonj\u016b, there is also material from picture books about warriors as well as legends. According to the oral traditions of Kumohara in Fukuchiyama, Kyoto Prefecture, there is the following legend about Kid\u014dmaru as a child of Shuten-d\u014dji. After Minamoto no Yorimitsu slew Shuten-d\u014dji, the girls captured by Shuten-d\u014dji were returned to their old homelands, but one of those girls became mentally disordered and was unable to return home and gave birth to Shuten-d\u014dji's child at Kumohara. This child had teeth at birth, and at the age of 7 or 8, would throw rocks to kill deer or boars for eating. It is said that eventually, this child grew to become Kid\u014dmaru, and aimed at his father's enemy, Yorimitsu and his group. The Zentaiheiki, a collection of war tales, theorizes this oni to instead be an abandoned child of Shuten-d\u014dji, and originally Kid\u014dmaru was a young child at Mount Hiei but came to ruin as a result of wicked deeds, and was therefore chased away from Mount Hiei, and then migrated to a cave in the mountains and became a bandit. \"Ry\u014dzoku Miyama Y\u014djutsuky\u014d no Zu\" (\u4e21\u8cca\u6df1\u5c71\u5996\u8853\u7af6\u4e4b\u56f3) by Utagawa Yoshitsuya According to the \"Shitenn\u014d Sh\u014dt\u014d Iroku\" (\u56db\u5929\u738b\u527f\u76d7\u7570\u9332) by Takizawa Bakin, at a cave in the mountains, Kid\u014dmaru met Hakamadare, a bandit of the Konjaku Monogatarish\u016b, where there was a scene of a contest comparing skills. Works which depict this include ukiyo-e such as Utagawa Kuniyoshi's Kid\u014dmaru and Tsukioka Yoshitoshi's Hakamadare Yasusuke Kid\u014dmaru Jutsukurabe no Zu (\u88b4\u5782\u4fdd\u8f14\u9b3c\u7ae5\u4e38\u8853\u7af6\u56f3). ==Notes== Category:Oni Category:Y\u014dkai {{documentation|content= This template is for use on pages dealing with Japanese folklore, including folk tales, legends and traditional stories.
