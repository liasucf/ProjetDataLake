    "text": "Creating Rem Lezar is a 1989 American children's musical film directed written and produced by Scott Zakarin and released direct-to-video. ==Production== Creating Rem Lezar was filmed in a variety of locations in New York state: The Bellmores, New York City, Roslyn and Spring Glen. ==Plot== Two children have the same dream about the same imaginary friend, a superhero named Rem Lezar. They paint a mannequin like their dream hero, which comes to life. The children try and find a Quixotic Medallion which will allow him to live longer than a day. == Cast == * Jack Mulcahy as Rem Lezar, policeman * Courtney Kernaghan as Ashlee ** Allegra Forste as Ashlee (singing double) * Jonathan Goch as Zack * Kathleen Gati as Ashlee's mother * Scott Zakarin as Vorock * Stewart H. Bruck as Principal * Evan Abbey, Ed Luparello, Billy Manning, and Johnny O'Hanlon as park quartet * Devery Gladney as park rapper * James E. Graseck as park violinist * Teresa Simpson as school teacher * Stuart Grodin as Ashlee's father * Karin Kernaghan as Zack's mother * Thomas Ritchie as Zack's father * Jason Erdman as Ashlee's brother ==Reception== Zakarin described the film as \"a critical success but a commercial failure.\" In 2007, the film came to prominence on the website eBaum's World, with the musical number \"Day and Night\" (featuring a late-1980s doo-wop group, hip-hop MC and violinist) becoming a viral hit. Creating Rem Lezar (described as \"creepy/fascinating\" and \"very strange\") appeared in a 2014 BuzzFeed listicle of 26 films that Scarecrow Video were trying to keep available to the public, as a reminder of \"how many rare titles are still only available as physical media thanks to market forces, rights issues, corporate wrangling, and other reasons.\" Creating Rem Lezar was featured on a 2019 episode of RedLetterMedia's \"Best of the Worst\" series. The crew voted the film the best video they had watched that night, and have since made it part of their Best of the Worst Hall of Fame. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1980s children's films Category:1980s musical films Category:1989 direct-to-video films Category:American children's films Category:American films Category:American direct-to-video films Category:American musical films ",
