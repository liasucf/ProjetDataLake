    "text": "Vincent Philippe Antoine Candela (; born 24 October 1973) is a French former professional footballer. With the French national team, Candela won the 1998 FIFA World Cup, as well as UEFA Euro 2000. Candela was a quick, offensive- minded, and technically skilled left wingback, who was effective at joining the attack as well as being capable in defence, due to his intelligence and tenacity. Although he preferred playing on the left flank, he was naturally right-footed, and was also capable of playing on the right, both as a full- back, and as a winger, and was an accurate crosser and set-piece taker. ==Club career== At club level, Candela played football in France with Toulouse (1992\u201395) and Guingamp (1995\u201397), before moving to Italian side A.S. Roma (1997\u20132005). He won one scudetto with Roma, as well as the Supercoppa Italiana, in 2001, also helping the club to the 2003 Coppa Italia Final. He later joined English side Bolton Wanderers (2005), before returning to Italy to play for Udinese (2005\u20132006), and Siena (2006\u20132007), as well as spending a spell on loan with Messina (2007). On 28 January 2007 he played his last Serie A match for Messina against Ascoli. ==International career== For France, Candela was capped 40 times between 1996 and 2003, scoring five goals. His playing time was often limited by Bixente Lizarazu, but he did play in one match during France's 1998 FIFA World Cup triumph on home soil. During France's triumphant Euro 2000 campaign, Candela played two matches, both as a starter. He also played for France at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, and at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. ===International goals=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\" !# !Date !Venue !Opponent !Score !Result !Competition |- |1. |14 October 1998 |Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France | |1 \u2013 0 |2 \u2013 0 |UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying |- |2. |6 October 2001 |Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France | |1 \u2013 0 |4 \u2013 1 |Friendly match |} ==Media== Candela was a dubbing actor in the Italian- language version of Shaolin Soccer.
