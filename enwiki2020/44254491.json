I Dreamt of a Dragon came as a surprise to their fans, with the band abandoning their aggressive style of music and going to a more electronic and commercial sound. It was recorded during the period 2013\u20132014 in DURU studio. The complete production and studio mastering/mixing was done by miKKa. The story about this album goes around new beginning after Nautilus story finished. The light after darkness is the main motive for dreDDup. Album cover was created by artists Blanka Pavlovi\u0107 and Bojana Jaro\u0161enko. This album also included guest musicians such as Mar2tA of Zbogom Brus Li , Dario Seraval of Borghesia and actress Ljuma Penov.
