Although the non-socialist parties held a majority in the Second Chamber, the Social Democrats held a majority in the First Chamber, so a non-socialist government could not be formed. The Social Democrats and the Farmers' League would later split due to disagreements over the pensions system in 1957, leading to the formation of Tage Erlander's third government and a snap election in 1958. ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right |- |colspan=7|300px |- !Party !Votes !% !Seats !+/\u2013 |- |align=left|Swedish Social Democratic Party||1,729,463||44.6||106||\u20134 |- |align=left|People's Party||923,564||23.8||58||0 |- |align=left|Right Party||663,693||17.1||42||+11 |- |align=left|Farmers' League||366,612||9.5||19||\u20137 |- |align=left|Communist Party of Sweden||194,016||5.0||6||+1 |- |align=left|Other parties||1,982||0.1||0||0 |- |align=left|Invalid/blank votes||22,784||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left|Total||3,902,114||100||231||+1 |- |align=left|Registered voters/turnout||4,887,325||79.8||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=5|Source: Nohlen & St\u00f6ver |} ==References== 1956 Category:1956 elections in Europe Category:1956 in Sweden Category:September 1956 events ",
