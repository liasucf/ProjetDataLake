    "text": "In functional analysis, every C*-algebra is isomorphic to a subalgebra of the C*-algebra \\mathcal{B}(H) of bounded linear operators on some Hilbert space H. This article describes the spectral theory of closed normal subalgebras of \\mathcal{B}(H). == Resolution of identity == Throughout we fix a Hilbert space H. Definition: A projection-valued measure on a measurable space \\left(X, \\Omega\\right), where \\Omega is a \u03c3-algebra of subsets of X, is a mapping \\pi : \\Omega \\to \\mathcal{B}(H) such that for all \\omega \\in \\Omega, \\pi(\\omega) is a self-adjoint projection on H (i.e. \\pi\\left(\\omega\\right) is a bounded linear operator \\pi\\left(\\omega\\right) : H \\to H that satisfies \\pi\\left(\\omega\\right) = \\pi(\\omega)^* and \\pi(\\omega) \\circ \\pi(\\omega) = \\pi(\\omega)) such that : \\pi(X) = \\operatorname{Id}_H \\quad (where \\operatorname{Id}_H is the identity operator of H) and for every x and y in H, the function \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{C} defined by \\omega \\mapsto \\langle \\pi(\\omega)x, t \\rangle is a complex measure on M (that is, a complex-valued countably additive function). Definition: A resolution of identity on a measurable space \\left(X, \\Omega\\right) is a function \\pi : \\Omega \\to \\mathcal{B}(H) such that for every \\omega_1, \\omega_2 \\in \\Omega: 1. \\pi\\left( \\emptyset \\right) = 0; 2. \\pi\\left( X\\right) = \\operatorname{Id}_{H}; 3. for every \\omega \\in \\Omega, \\pi\\left(\\omega\\right) is a self-adjoint projection on H; 4. for every x and y in H, the map \\pi_{x, y} : \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{C} defined by \\pi_{x,y}(\\omega) = \\left\\langle \\pi(\\omega) x, y \\right\\rangle is a complex measure on \\Omega; 5. \\pi\\left( \\omega_1 \\cap \\omega_2 \\right) = \\pi\\left( \\omega_1 \\right) \\circ \\pi\\left( \\omega_2 \\right); 6. if \\omega_1 \\cap \\omega_2 = \\emptyset then \\pi \\left( \\omega_1 \\cup \\omega_2 \\right) = \\pi\\left( \\omega_1 \\right) + \\pi\\left( \\omega_2 \\right); If \\Omega is the \\sigma-algebra of all Borels sets on a Hausdorff locally compact (or compact) space, then we also add the following requirement: 7. for every x and y in H, the map \\pi_{x, y} : \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{C} is a regular Borel measure (this is automatically satisfied on compact metric spaces). Conditions 2, 3, and 4 imply that \\pi is a projection-valued measure. === Properties === Throughout let \\pi be a resolution of identity. * For all x in H, \\pi_{x, x} : \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{C} is a positive measure on \\Omega with total variation \\left\\| \\pi_{x, x} \\right\\| = \\pi_{x, x}\\left( X \\right) = \\| x \\|^2 and that satisfies \\pi_{x, x}\\left( \\omega \\right) = \\left\\langle \\pi(\\omega) x, x \\right\\rangle = \\| \\pi\\left( \\omega \\right) x \\|^2 for all \\omega \\in \\Omega. For every \\omega_1, \\omega_2 \\in \\Omega: * \\pi\\left( \\omega_1 \\right) \\pi\\left( \\omega_2 \\right) = \\pi\\left( \\omega_2 \\right) \\pi\\left( \\omega_1 \\right) (since both are equal to \\pi\\left( \\omega_1 \\cap \\omega_2 \\right)). * If \\omega_1 \\cap \\omega_2 = \\emptyset then the ranges of the maps \\pi\\left( \\omega_1 \\right) and \\pi\\left( \\omega_2 \\right) are orthogonal to each other and \\pi\\left( \\omega_1 \\right) \\pi\\left( \\omega_2 \\right) = 0 = \\pi\\left( \\omega_2 \\right) \\pi\\left( \\omega_1 \\right). * \\pi : \\Omega \\to \\mathcal{B}(H) is finitely additive. * If \\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\ldots are pairwise disjoint elements of \\Omega whose union is \\omega and if \\pi\\left( \\omega_i \\right) = 0 for all i then \\pi\\left( \\omega \\right) = 0. * However, \\pi : \\Omega \\to \\mathcal{B}(H) is countably additive only in trivial situations as we now describe: suppose that \\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\ldots are pairwise disjoint elements of \\Omega whose union is \\omega and that the partial sums \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\pi\\left( \\omega_i \\right) converge to \\pi(\\omega) in \\mathcal{B}(H) (with its norm topology) as n \\to \\infty; then since the norm of any projection is either 0 or \\geq 1, the partial sums cannot form a Cauchy sequence unless all but finitely many of the \\pi\\left( \\omega_i \\right) are 0. * For any fixed x in H, the map \\pi_{x} : \\Omega \\to H defined by \\pi_{x}(\\omega) := \\pi( \\omega ) x is a countably additive H-valued measure on \\Omega. * Here countably additive means that whenever \\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\ldots are pairwise disjoint elements of \\Omega whose union is \\omega, then the partial sums \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\pi\\left( \\omega_i \\right) x converge to \\pi(\\omega) in H (or succinctly, \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\pi\\left( \\omega_i \\right) x = \\pi\\left( \\omega \\right) x). == L\u221e(\u03c0) - space of essentially bounded function == The \\pi : \\Omega \\to \\mathcal{B}(H) be a resolution of identity on \\left( X, \\Omega \\right). === Essentially bounded functions === Suppose we are given a complex-valued \\Omega-measurable functions f : X \\to \\mathbb{C}. There exists a unique largest open subset V_f of \\mathbb{C} (ordered under subset inclusion) such that \\pi\\left( f^{-1}\\left( V_f \\right) \\right) = 0. To see why, let D_1, D_2, \\ldots be a basis for \\mathbb{C}'s topology consisting of open disks and suppose that D_{i_1}, D_{i_2}, \\ldots is the subsequence (possibly finite) consisting of those sets such that \\pi\\left( f^{-1}\\left( D_{i_k} \\right) \\right) = 0; then D_{i_1} \\cup D_{i_2} \\cup \\cdots = V_f. Note that, in particular, if D is an open subset of \\mathbb{C} such that D \\cap \\operatorname{Im} f = \\emptyset then \\pi\\left( f^{-1}\\left( D \\right) \\right) = \\pi \\left( \\emptyset \\right) = 0 so that D \\subseteq V_f (although there are other ways in which \\pi\\left( f^{-1}\\left( D \\right) \\right) may equal 0). Indeed, \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\operatorname{cl}\\left( \\operatorname{Im} f \\right) \\subseteq V_f. The essential range of f is defined to be the complement of V_f. It is the smallest closed subset of \\mathbb{C} that contains f(x) for almost all x \\in X (i.e. for all x \\in X except for those in some set \\omega \\in \\Omega such that \\pi\\left( \\omega \\right) = 0). Note that the essential range is a closed subset of \\mathbb{C} so that if it is also a bounded subset of \\mathbb{C} then it is compact. We say that f is essentially bounded if its essential range is bounded, in which case we define its essential supremum, denoted by \\| f \\|^{\\infty}, to be the supremum of all | \\lambda | as \\lambda ranges over the essential range of f. === Space of essentially bounded functions === Let \\mathcal{B}(X, \\Omega) be the vector space of all bounded complex-valued \\Omega-measurable functions f : X \\to \\mathbb{C}, which becomes a Banach algebra when normed by \\| f \\|_{\\infty} := \\sup_{x \\in X} | f(x) |. Note that \\left\\| \\cdot \\right\\|^{\\infty} is a seminorm on \\mathcal{B}(X, \\Omega), but not necessarily a norm. The kernel of this seminorm, N^{\\infty} := \\left\\\\{ f \\in \\mathcal{B}(X, \\Omega) : \\left\\| f \\right\\|^{\\infty} = 0 \\right\\\\}, is a vector subspace of \\mathcal{B}(X, \\Omega) that is a closed two-sided ideal of the Banach algebra \\left( \\mathcal{B}(X, \\Omega), \\| \\cdot \\|_{\\infty} \\right). Hence the quotient of \\mathcal{B}(X, \\Omega) by N^{\\infty} is also a Banach algebra, denoted by L^{\\infty}(\\pi) := \\mathcal{B}(X, \\Omega) / N^{\\infty} where the norm of any element f + N^{\\infty} \\in L^{\\infty}(\\pi) is equal to \\| f \\|^{\\infty} (since if f + N^{\\infty} = g + N^{\\infty} then \\| f \\|^{\\infty} = \\| g \\|^{\\infty}) and this norm makes L^{\\infty}(\\pi) into a Banach algebra. The spectrum of f + N^{\\infty} in L^{\\infty}(\\pi) is the essential range of f. We will follow the usual practice of writing f rather than f + N^{\\infty} to represent elements of L^{\\infty}(\\pi). Theorem: Let \\pi : \\Omega \\to \\mathcal{B}(H) be a resolution of identity on \\left( X, \\Omega \\right). There exists a closed normal subalgebra A of \\mathcal{B}(H) and an isometric *-isomorphism \\Psi : L^{\\infty}(\\pi) \\to A satisfying the following properties: 1. \\left\\langle \\Psi(f) x, y \\right\\rangle = \\int_{X} f \\operatorname{d} \\pi_{x, y} for all x and y in H and f \\in L^{\\infty}\\left( \\pi \\right), which justifies the notation \\Psi(f) = \\int_{X} f \\operatorname{d}\\pi; 2. \\left\\| \\Psi(f) x \\right\\|^2 = \\int_{X} | f |^2 \\operatorname{d} \\pi_{x, x} for all x \\in H and f \\in L^{\\infty}\\left( \\pi \\right); 3. an operator R \\in \\mathbb{B}(H) commutes with every element of \\operatorname{Im} \\pi if and only if it commutes with every element of A = \\operatorname{Im} \\Psi. 4. if f is a simple function equal to f = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_i \\mathbb{1}_{\\omega_i}, where \\omega_1, \\ldots \\omega_n is a partition of X and the \\lambda_i are complex numbers, then \\Psi(f) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_i \\pi\\left( \\omega_i \\right) (here \\mathbb{1} is the characteristic function); 5. if f is the limit (in the norm of L^{\\infty}(\\pi)) of a sequence of simple functions s_1, s_2, \\ldots in L^{\\infty}(\\pi) then \\left( \\Psi\\left( s_i \\right) \\right)_{i=1}^{\\infty} converges to\\Psi(f) in \\mathcal{B}(H) and \\| \\Psi(f) \\| = \\| f \\|^{\\infty}; 6. \\left( \\| f \\|^{\\infty} \\right)^2 = \\sup_{\\| h \\| \\leq 1} \\int_{X} \\operatorname{d} \\pi_{h, h} for every f \\in L^{\\infty}\\left( \\pi \\right). == Spectral theorem == Recall that the maximal ideal space of a Banach algebra A is the set of all complex homomorphisms A \\to \\mathbb{C}, which we'll denote by \\sigma_A. For every T in A, the Gelfand transform of T is the map G(T) : \\sigma_A \\to \\mathbb{C} defined by G(T)(h) := h(T). \\sigma_A is given the weakest topology making every G(T) : \\sigma_A \\to \\mathbb{C} continuous. With this topology, \\sigma_A is a compact Hausdorff space and every T in A, G(T) belongs to C \\left( \\sigma_A \\right), which is the space of continuous complex-valued functions on \\sigma_A. Recall that the range of G(T) is the spectrum \\sigma(T) and that the spectral radius is equal to \\max \\left\\\\{ |G(T)(h) | : h \\in \\sigma_A \\right\\\\}, which is \\leq \\| T \\|. Theorem: Suppose A is a closed normal subalgebra of \\mathcal{B}(H) that contains the identity operator \\operatorname{Id}_H and let \\sigma = \\sigma_A be the maximal ideal space of A. Let \\Omega be the Borel subsets of \\sigma. For every T in A, let G(T) : \\sigma_A \\to \\mathbb{C} denote the Gelfand transform of T so that G is an injective map G : A \\to C\\left( \\sigma_A \\right). There exists a unique resolution of identity \\pi : \\Omega \\to A that satisfies: :: \\left\\langle T x, y \\right\\rangle = \\int_{\\sigma_A} G(T) \\operatorname{d} \\pi_{x, y} for all x, y \\in H and all T \\in A (we use the notation T = \\int_{\\sigma_A} G(T) \\operatorname{d} \\pi to summarize this situation). Let I : \\operatorname{Im} G \\to A be the inverse of the Gelfand transform G : A \\to C\\left( \\sigma_A \\right) where note that \\operatorname{Im} G can be canonically identified as a subspace of L^{\\infty}(\\pi). Let B be the closure (in the norm topology of \\mathcal{B}(H)) of the linear span of \\operatorname{Im} \\pi. The following hold: 1. B is a closed subalgebra of \\mathcal{B}(H) containing A; 2. There exists a (linear multiplicative) isometric *-isomorphism \\Phi : L^{\\infty}\\left( \\pi \\right) \\to B extending I : \\operatorname{Im} G \\to A such that \\Phi f = \\int_{\\sigma_A} f \\operatorname{d} \\pi for all f \\in L^{\\infty}(\\pi); * Recall that the notation \\Phi f = \\int_{\\sigma_A} f \\operatorname{d} \\pi means that \\left\\langle \\left( \\Phi f \\right) x, y \\right\\rangle = \\int_{\\sigma_A} f \\operatorname{d} \\pi_{x, y} for all x, y \\in H; * Note in particular that T = \\int_{\\sigma_A} G(T) \\operatorname{d} \\pi = \\Phi\\left( G(T) \\right) for all T \\in A; * Explicitly, \\Phi satisfies \\Phi \\left( \\overline{f} \\right) = \\left( \\Phi f \\right)^{*} and \\| \\Phi f \\| = \\| f \\|^{\\infty} for every f \\in L^{\\infty}( \\pi ) (so if f is real valued then \\Phi(f) is self-adjoint); 3. If \\omega \\subseteq \\sigma_A is open and nonempty (which implies that \\omega \\in \\Omega) then \\pi\\left( \\omega \\right) eq 0; 4. A bounded linear operator S \\in \\mathcal{B}(H) commutes with every element of A if and only if it commutes with every element of \\operatorname{Im} \\pi; The above result can be specialized to a single normal bounded operator. == See also == * Projection-valued measure * Spectral theory of compact operators * Spectral theorem == References == * * * ",
