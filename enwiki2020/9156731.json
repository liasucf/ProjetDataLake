The company is reported to prepare a 3D 'walk through' CAD before going ahead with the project which allows the home owner to visualize the project and make required design changes before making modifications to their outdoor space. In March 2011, the company became a member of Urban Development Institute of Australia. The company is also a member of HIA and MBA. Living Environs was noted among 2013 BRW Fast Starters and ranked in the top 100 in the Startup Smart Awards that same year.http://www.startupsmart.com.au/startupsmart-awards-2013/living- environs.html ==References== Category:Companies based in Perth, Western Australia ",
