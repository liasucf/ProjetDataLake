The first set of officially sponsored mixtapes from Eminem's Shady Records.

He is also recognized as a producer, featuring on his own mixtapes several \"Green Remixes,\" including, most notably, a remix of the Nas and Tupac Shakur collaboration, \"Thugz Mansion.\" He also produced D-Block's \"2 Guns Up\", an acclaimed street single, which originated as a freestyle rap on his Hot 97 radio show, \"In the Lab\" (the most memorable of which has also appeared as a mixtape, \"The Best of In the Lab\"). \"In the Lab\" is formatted as a one-hour (with commercials) mix show, in which DJ Green Lantern blends a cappella and instrumental tracks from various artists, as well as breaking new and underground music (such as the Ghostface Killah and El-Producto collaboration \"HideYaFace\"). ====\"Bin Laden\"==== D'Agostino also produced Ludacris' \"Number One Spot,\" the second single from his album The Red Light District, and Immortal Technique's \"Bin Laden\" single, which blames the Reagan Doctrine and U.S. President George W.

Due to the high anticipation of the mixtape, Royce gave the mixtape the slogan \"Happy Bar Exam 2, It's a Holiday\" prior to its release. ===Pulse of the People=== D'Agostino collaborated with Dead Prez on their latest album, Pulse of the People: Turn Off The Radio, Vol. 3, released in June 2009DeadPrez.com \u2013 Official Website ===GTA IV=== Together with Mister Cee he is featured as host of the hip-hop radio station \"The Beat 102.7\" in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV.
