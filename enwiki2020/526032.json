It is in the London Borough of Sutton, north-east of the town of Sutton itself. Designed to create zero carbon emissions, it was the first large scale community to do so. ==Background== BedZED was designed by the architect Bill Dunster to be carbon neutral, protecting the environment and supporting a more sustainable lifestyle. The project was led by the Peabody Trust in partnership with Bill Dunster Architects, Ellis & Moore Consulting Engineers, BioRegional, Arup and the cost consultants Gardiner and Theobald. The project was also pioneering by being the first construction project where a local authority sold land at below market value to make sustainable development economically viable. The 82 homes and of work space was built within the period of 2000\u20132002. The project was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize in 2003. ==Transport== As part of BedZED's eco friendly low-energy-emission concept, cars are discouraged; the project encourages public transport, cycling and walking, and has limited parking space. There are good rail and bus links in the immediate area. They also have a car-share scheme. ==Principles== BedZED buildings BedZED fa\u00e7ade at dusk Side of one of the buildings at BedZED Wind cowls * Zero energy\u2014The project is designed to use only energy from renewable sources generated on site. There are of solar panels. Tree waste was to fuel the development's cogeneration plant (a downdraft gasifier) to provide district heating and electricity. The gasifier was abandoned because of technical implementation problems. * High quality \u2013 The apartments are finished to a high standard to attract the urban professional. * Energy efficient \u2013 The houses face south to take advantage of solar gain, are triple glazed, and have high thermal insulation. * Water efficient \u2013 Most rain water falling on the site is collected and reused. Appliances are chosen to be water-efficient and use recycled water when possible. A \"living machine\" system of recycling waste water was installed but did not achieve the required water quality standards. * Low-impact materials \u2013 Building materials were selected from renewable or recycled sources within of the site, to minimize the energy required for transportation. * Waste recycling \u2013 Refuse-collection facilities are designed to support recycling. * Transport \u2013 The development works in partnership with the United Kingdom's leading car-sharing operator, City Car Club. Residents are encouraged to use this environmentally friendly alternative to car ownership; an on-site selection of vehicles are available for use. * Encourage eco-friendly transport \u2013 Electric and liquefied- petroleum-gas cars have priority over cars that burn petrol and diesel, and electricity is provided in parking spaces for charging electric cars. * A higher reported quality of life, with a strong sense of community. ==Performance== Monitoring conducted in 2003 found that BedZED had achieved these reductions in comparison to UK averages: * Space-heating requirements were 88% less. * Hot-water consumption was 57% less. * The electrical power used, at 3 kilowatt hours per person per day, was 25% less than the UK average; 11% of this was produced by solar panels. The remainder normally would be produced by a combined-heat-and-power plant fuelled by wood chips, but the installation company's financial problems have delayed use of the plant. * Mains-water consumption has been reduced by 50%, or 67% compared to a power-shower household. * The residents' car mileage is 65% less. ==Problems== A review of the BedZed development in 2010 drew mainly positive conclusions. Residents and neighbours were largely happy. However, a few significant failures were highlighted, for example: *The biomass wood chip boiler (biomass gasifier) was no longer in operation and the backup power source, a gas boiler, was used from 2005 - 2017. The downdraft wood chip gasifier CHP (combined heat and power) had reliability problems due to technical problems and the intermittent schedule of operation (no late-night operation) imposed by the local authority. However, BedZED switched from gas back to a biomass pellet boiler in 2017 which provides heat for the district heating network but not electricity, which is now sourced from the grid on a green tariff. The biomass pellets are now sourced from Spain, not from local wood waste. *The 'Living Machine' water recycling facility had been unable to clean the water sufficiently. The cost of the facility also made it unviable. *Passive heating from the sunspaces had been insufficient. *Because of its location, the development requires the constant use of cars by residents. This negates its fundamental raison d'\u00eatre, other than as an interesting experiment. The results show that the average ecological footprint of a BedZED resident is 4.67 global hectares (2.6 planets), which is 89% of the baseline. This would reduce to 4.32 global hectares (2.4 planets) if the energy was all zero carbon. However, a keen resident at BedZED (if the CHP was working) could achieve an ecological footprint of 3.0 global hectares (1.7 planets) which is 57% of the average. The target was 1 planet. ==Awards== * 2001 \u2013 Housing Design Award for sustainability, from the Royal Institute of British Architects * 2001 \u2013 Evening Standard New Homes Awards \u2013 BedZED won the London Lifestyle award. \"Ambitious and brave, and a model for future developments\" * 2001 \u2013 UK Solar Awards, run by Energy 21, for BedZED \u2013 \"perhaps the most influential of all housing projects this century\". * 2002 \u2013 World Habitat Awards \u2013 BedZED was a finalist. * 2003 \u2013 Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Award for sustainable communities \u2013 BedZED was short listed with 3 other projects. * 2003 \u2013 Stirling Prize \u2013 BedZED was short listed * 2003 \u2013 RIBA journal sustainability award \u2013 the judges said \"BedZED goes way beyond the standard environmental checklist by challenging both the way we live and work... Until now, pioneering communities have often been attained at the expense of architectural ambition but at BedZED the architects have been highly innovative.\" * 2003 \u2013 Housing Design Awards \u2013 BedZED won a 'Completed Scheme' award. * 2003 \u2013 Ashden Awards \u2013 for projects building on the experience of BedZEDBedZED wins Ashden Award * 2002 \u2013 Energy Globe Award \u2013 international award recognising BedZED as the foremost example of sustainable energy in building and housing. * 2002 \u2013 Building Services Award for innovation. * 2004 \u2013 Bremen Awards Special Commendation * 2004 \u2013 Civic Trust\u2019s sustainability award * 2005 \u2013 Sutton and Cheam Society Design award. ==See also== * Energy efficiency in housing * Passive solar building design * BioRegional * Peabody Trust == References == ==External links== * ZedFactory's BedZED website * Bioregional BedZED website * An architect\u2019s sustainable dreams - chinadialogue article about BedZED * Information about BedZED on Peabody's website Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Sutton Category:Low-energy building in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2002 Category:Ecovillages Category:Housing in England Category:Mixed-use developments in the United Kingdom Category:2002 establishments in England Category:Housing estates in the London Borough of Sutton ",
