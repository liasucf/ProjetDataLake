    "text": "Sweet chili sauce (also known as Thai sweet chili sauce), known as nam chim kai in Thailand (; literally \"dipping sauce for chicken\"), is a popular chili sauce condiment in Thai, Afghan, Malaysian, and Western cuisine. It is commonly made with red chili peppers (often 'Fresno Chili', Thai or red jalapenos), rice wine vinegar, sometimes garlic, sometimes fish sauce, and a sweetening ingredient such as fruit or a refined sugar or honey. It is popular as a dip in European Chinese restaurant dishes such as prawn toast, egg rolls, lettuce wraps, chicken wings and spring rolls. It can also be purchased in bottle form. In Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Canada, and the United States, \"Thai sweet chili sauce\" is available as a condiment at many takeaway stores and supermarkets. ==See also== * Chili oil, a condiment made from chili and oil that adds heat to Asian dishes * Nam chim, various Thai dipping sauces * N\u01b0\u1edbc ch\u1ea5m, Vietnamese sauce that has similar ingredients to sweet chili sauce but is more spicy and vinegary, and less sweet and thick in texture * Nam phrik, various Thai chili pastes * Sriracha, a Thai condiment sauce made from chilies that adds heat to a dish * List of dips * List of sauces * ==References== ==External links== *Recipe for Sweet Chilli Sauce Category:Condiments Category:Chili sauce and paste ",
