Born in Tartu, she studied composition at the Tallinn Secondary Music School under Alo P\u00f5ldm\u00e4e and from 1989\u20131992 at the Estonian Academy of Music with Erkki-Sven T\u00fc\u00fcr, being the latter\u2019s sole student of composition thus far. In 1994 Tulve graduated with the Premier Prix from Jacques Charpentier\u2019s composition class at the Conservatoire Superieur de Paris. Between 1993 and 1996 she furthered her knowledge of Gregorian chant. She has also attended Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti\u2019s and Marco Stroppa\u2019s summer courses. Tulve belongs to the younger generation of Estonian composers who, in contrast to the neo-classicist tradition of rhythm-centeredness, create music which focuses on sound and sonority. Tulve\u2019s works give a fair idea of the richness and variety of her cultural experience: the French school of spectral music, IRCAM\u2019s experimentalism, Kaija Saariaho and Giacinto Scelsi, echoes of Gregorian chant and Eastern musics. Deriving from her refined sound processing, Tulve\u2019s approach to form is \u201cfluid\u201d \u2013 more process based than architectonic. ==Selected works== *Reyah hadas \u00b4ala for male voices and ancient music instruments (2005, text by Shalom Shabazi) *Lendajad for amplified flutes (2005) [fl.in C (fl. picc./ fl. basso) & fl. in C (fl. picc./ fl. in G] *ligne d\u00b4horizon for ensemble (2005) [ 1-1-1-0/ 0-0-0-0/ pno-arpa- mandolino-guit.-1batt./ 1-1-1-1] *lumineux/opaque new version for clarinet, cello, piano and 3 wine glasses (2004) *chamber-opera It Is Getting So Dark (2003/04, text by Sei Sh\u014dnagon) [14 female voices & ensemble: flauto-corno- vla-cb.-arpa-batt.] *\u2026il neige for harpsichord and kannel (2004) *nec ros, nec pluvia\u2026 for string quartet (2004) *effleurements, \u00e9clatements\u2026 for guitar and percussion (2003) *abysses for flute and ensemble (2003) [fl.picc./in C/alto/basso-fl.picc./in C/alto-ob.-fag.- tr.ne-batt.-v.la-vc. ] *lijnen for soprano and ensemble (2003) [fl.-cl.-ob.-fag.-corno-vln.-vla- vc.-cb.] *delta soundscape for tape (2003) *Vie secr\u00e8te for chamber choir (2002) *lumineux / opaque for violin, cello, piano and 3 wine glasses (2002) *Valvaja for oboe solo (2002) *Cendres for ensemble (2001 [fl.-cl.-vln.-vc.-cb.-2 batt.-2 pn.] *Traces for ensemble (2001 [fl.-ob.-cl.-sax.bar./sax.alto-batt.-vln.-cb.] *Vertige for piano (2000) *Ithaque for female voice, violin and piano (2000) *Sula (Thawing) for orchestra (1999, commissioned by the NYYD Festival) [3-3-3-3/ 4-3-3-0/ 5 batt./ 1 pn./ 1 arpa/ 16-14-12-10-8/ didgeridoo] *Passage secret for two clarinets (1999) *Sans titre for harpsichord (1999, commissioned by the NYYD Festival for Jukka Tiensuu) *Sinine (Blue) for chamber ensemble (1998, commissioned by the NYYD Ensemble) [ 1-1-1-1/ 1-1-1-0/ 1 batt./ 1pn./ 1-1-1-1-1] *\u00e0 travers for chamber ensemble (1998, commissioned by the NYYD Ensemble) [ 1-1-1-1/ 1-0-1-0/ 1 batt./ 1-1-1-1-1] *\u00d6\u00f6 (Night) for saxophone quartet (1997, for Stockholm Saxophone Quartet, premiere at the NYYD Festival '97) *S\u00f5najalad (Ferns) for voice and piano with words by Karl Ristikivi (1994) *Saar (Island) for violin and clarinet (1993) *Exodus for chamber choir (1992/93) *Lethe for chamber ensemble (1991, fl., ob., cl., pn., vc.) *Phainomenon for piano, percussions and tape (1989/90) ==Discography== * Lijnen (ECM Records, 2008) * Arboles lloran por lluvia (ECM, 2014) == References == ==External links== * Composer's website * Interview of Helena Tulve about her music lectures (University of Tartu, Estonia) Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:People from Tartu Category:21st-century classical composers Category:Tallinn Music High School alumni Category:International Rostrum of Composers prize-winners Category:Female classical composers Category:Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre faculty Category:20th-century Estonian composers Category:21st-century Estonian composers Category:Recipients of the Order of the White Star, 5th Class Category:20th-century women composers Category:21st-century women composers ",
