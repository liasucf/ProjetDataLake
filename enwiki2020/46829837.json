    "text": "Lindemann is a German-Swedish industrial metal super-duo created by Rammstein vocalist Till Lindemann, and multi-instrumentalist Peter T\u00e4gtgren, of Swedish death metal band Hypocrisy and industrial metal project Pain. T\u00e4gtgren defines it as \"a baby between Rammstein and PAIN \u2013 at least it's a mix of Rammstein vocals and Pain music.\" == History == Official band logo === Origins and Skills in Pills (2013\u20132016) === Lindemann and T\u00e4gtgren met around the year 2000 in a rock pub in Stockholm, when members of Clawfinger introduced them to each other. In 2013, when Rammstein was headlining a festival in Sweden, the German singer invited his Swedish bandmate to it. There, he told T\u00e4gtgren he would take two years off and wanted to write some music with him. They originally planned to do only one or two songs, but T\u00e4gtgren felt they were \"too good\" and wanted to write more. The name of the band \"was the only thing we couldn't come up with\". All names considered by the band were already taken by other groups, so they eventually accepted a suggestion by somebody else and simply called it \"Lindemann\", though T\u00e4gtgren was initially unhappy with it. On 28 May 2015, the band released its debut single \"Praise Abort\". Their debut studio album titled Skills in Pills was released on 19 June 2015. When asked about possible future live performances, T\u00e4gtgren said it will depend on fan response to the project. In November 2016, Pain's Facebook page teased that a concert would be happening on November 9. Lindemann joined T\u00e4gtgren on stage to sing \"Praise Abort\". === F & M (2019\u2013present) === In 2018, the duo made music for an adaptation of the play \"H\u00e4nsel und Gretel\" with Till Lindemann also appearing in the play. Also in September, Lindemann and T\u00e4gtgren announced a tour of Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan in support of Lindemann's book \"Messer\". On 16 August 2019, Peter T\u00e4gtgren announced that the new album was done, mixed and produced. On 10 September 2019, a teaser for the new single \"Steh auf\" was posted on social media telling the music video be released on September 13, 2019. The music video featured Swedish actor Peter Stormare. The album F & M was released on 22 November 2019. Lindemann announced their 2020 tour on 4 November 2019 via their Social Media platforms. All dates apart from the final three went ahead - the shows in Perm, Kazan & Voronezh all cancelled due to the pandemic. == Discography == === Albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Title !rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Album details !colspan=\"13\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| GER ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| AUS ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| AUT ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| BEL (FL) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| BEL (WA) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| FIN ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| FRA ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| NLD ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| NOR ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| SWE ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| SWI ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| UK ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US |- ! scope=\"row\"| Skills in Pills | * Released: 19 June 2015 * Label: Warner Central Europe * Format: CD, LP, DL | 1 || 17 || 3 || 17 || 19 || 1 || 16 || 6 || 9 || 27 || 2 || 35 || 144 |- ! scope=\"row\"| F & M | * Released: 22 November 2019 * Label: Universal/Vertigo Berlin * Format: CD, LP, DL | 1 || \u2014 || 3 || 9 || 25 || 5 || 38 || 18 || 20 || 23 || 3 || 85 || \u2014 |} === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+List of singles, with selected chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\" | Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\" | Year ! colspan=\"2\" | Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\" | Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| GER ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| BEL (FL) Tip |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Praise Abort\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2015 | 42 | \u2014 | rowspan=\"2\"| Skills in Pills |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Fish On\" | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Mathematik\" | 2018 | \u2014 | \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Steh auf\" | rowspan=\"4\"| 2019 | 8 | 33 | rowspan=\"4\"| F & M |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Ich wei\u00df es nicht\" | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Knebel\" | \u2014 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Frau & Mann\" | \u2014 | 42 |} === EPs === * 2015: Praise Abort (Remixes) === Music videos === * 2015 \u2014 \"Praise Abort\" * 2015 \u2014 \"Fish On\" * 2018 \u2014 \"Mathematik\" * 2019 \u2014 \"Steh auf\" * 2019 \u2014 \"Ich wei\u00df es nicht\" * 2019 \u2014 \"Knebel\" * 2019 \u2014 \"Frau & Mann\" * 2019 \u2014 \"Ach so gern * 2020 \u2014 \"Ach so gern (One Shot Video)\" * 2020 \u2014 \"Ach so gern (Pain Version)\" * 2020 \u2014 \"Ach so gern (Clemens Wijers Version)\" * 2020 \u2014 \"Ach so gern (Drago Baoti\u0107 Version)\" * 2020 \u2014 \"Platz Eins\" ==Awards and nominations== Metal Hammer Awards (GER) |- | 2015 || Lindemann || Best German Band || |- | 2015 || Skills in Pills || Best Debut Album || == Notes == == References == == External links == * Category:Industrial metal musical groups Category:Industrial rock musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2015 Category:Heavy metal supergroups Category:Warner Records artists Category:German industrial music groups Category:German heavy metal musical groups Category:Swedish heavy metal musical groups Category:Musical groups from Stockholm Category:Swedish musical duos Category:Heavy metal duos ",
