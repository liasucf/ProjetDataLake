    "text": "Oakham was a rural district in Rutland, England from 1894 to 1974, covering the north of the county. The rural district had its origins in the Oakham Rural Sanitary District, formed in 1875. Oakham RSD had an identical area to Oakham poor law union, and consisted of thirty-one civil parishes of which twenty-nine were in Rutland and two in Leicestershire. The Local Government Act 1894 redesignated the area as Oakham Rural District, at the same time transferring the Leicestershire parishes of Cold Overton and Knossington to Melton Mowbray Rural District. The rural district included the town of Oakham until 1911, when it was constituted as Oakham Urban District.[] The Rural District Council continued to be based in the town, however. ==Parishes== The rural district consisted of the following parishes:F A Youngs Jr., Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol.II: Northern England, London, 1991 *Ashwell *Barleythorpe *Barrow *Braunston *Brooke *Burley *Cottesmore *Edith Weston *Egleton *Empingham *Exton *Greetham *Gunthorpe *Hambleton *Horn *Langham *Leighfield *Lyndon *Manton *Martinsthorpe *Normanton *Oakham (until 1911) *Market Overton *Stretton *Teigh *Thistleton *Tickencote *Whissendine *Whitwell ==References== Category:History of Rutland Category:Local government in Rutland Category:Districts of England created by the Local Government Act 1894 Category:Districts of England abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 Category:Rural districts of England Category:Oakham ",
