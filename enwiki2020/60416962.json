In 2001 Campanile won the James Beard Foundation award for Outstanding Restaurant. == History == From mid 1989 until nearly 2013, Campanile occupied a landmark building at 624 South La Brea Avenue in Los Angeles, California. Built by Charlie Chaplin in 1929, the neglected building was discovered by Silverton\u2019s mother and bought by her father, then renovated according to the specifications of Campanile\u2019s co-founders. Five months before launching Campanile, the founders opened La Brea Bakery as part of the restaurant complex, to provide the quality breads they wanted to serve. \u201cLike the bakery before it, the Campanile restaurant was a hit when it opened six months later. Silverton and Peel were well known from their stints at Spago and Michael's in Los Angeles. The press anticipated the opening. Customers waited weeks for a table. Annual sales exceeded $2 million right from the start.\u201d According to the Los Angeles Times, \u201cCampanile, which opened in 1989, helped to shape the culinary landscape of Los Angeles, influencing so many of today\u2019s chefs (many of whom passed through its kitchen).\u201d \u201cThe storied restaurant, with its distinctly American approach using top-quality farmer's market ingredients, helped set the tone for Los Angeles dining in the 1990s,\u201d wrote Betty Hallock. For more than two decades Peel served as Executive Chef at Campanile, where food critic Jonathan Gold observed that \u201cIt is hard to overstate Campanile\u2019s contributions to American cooking,\u201c and \u201c\u2026 Peel is still the most exacting grill chef in the country, a master who plays his smoldering logs the way that Pinchas Zukerman does a Stradivarius.\u201d In its November 1997 issue, Los Angeles Magazine said, \u201cArguably the best restaurant in L.A., Campanile\u2014home to Nancy Silverton\u2019s La Brea Bakery and local shrine to Mark Peel\u2019s urban-rustic cuisine\u2014continues to be solid yet innovative, comforting yet startling. The cedar-smoked trout with fennel salad; rosemary-charred lamb with artichokes, fava beans and olives; and the sour-cherry brioche are classic selections from a menu that changes daily.\u201d La Brea Bakery was sold in 2001 to Aryzta. In 2012, Campanile restaurant lost its lease and closed.https://www.laweekly.com/an-elegy-for-campanile/ == Tributes == * Campanile in the Eighties (by Ruth Reichl): http://ruthreichl.com/2018/11/campanile-in-the-eighties.html/ * An Elegy for Campanile: https://www.laweekly.com/restaurants/an-elegy-for-campanile-2381940 * A last look at Campanile from kevinEats blog: http://www.kevineats.com/2012/10/campanile-los-angeles-ca.html * Campanile closing? https://www.latimes.com/food/la-fo-gold-20120929-story.html * Campanile regulars reminisce: https://www.scpr.org/news/2012/09/24/34398/campanile-regulars-restaurant- close-reopen-LAX/ * \u201cCampanile\u2014a restaurant so revered for its contributions to America\u2019s culinary landscape that it spawned eulogies from food critics when it closed in 2012.\u201d ==Bibliography == * New Classic Family Dinners: More than 200 Everyday Recipes and Menus from the Award Winning Campanile Restaurant.
