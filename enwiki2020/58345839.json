For example, while killing his wife, he pulled out her teeth and later stole his friend's dental prosthesis, which he kept. == Murders == Junni committed his first homicide in August 1980, when he killed his wife in Kontula. He was questioned on the matter, but there was insufficient evidence against him, and the case was recorded as an accident. Junni committed his next murders at the Kivinokka summer camp, in Herttoniemi, in June 1986. In this case, his colleagues Seppo M\u00e4ntyniemi and Juha V\u00e4re were the victims. He then set fire to the crime scene. In July 1986, Junni killed his friend, Matti Haapanen, then set fire to his summer home. The last death occurred in 1988, when Junni burned Pauli Sironen alive in his summer home. Junni showed particular interest in cadavers, and often visited the mortuary. == Arrest == In 1990 Junni's now grown up son revealed to the police that the death of his mother had not indeed been an accident, in fact he had been preparing to leave for school on the morning when he saw his father stomping on his mother's head and before dragging her unconscious body into the bathtub. Junni was taken in for interrogation, where he first confessed to his wife's murder. However, police later found out that a man named Matti Haapanen who they needed for interrogation regarding the killing of Junni's wife, had actually burned up with his small summer cottage in Kivinokka few years earlier. The investigators got suspicious after the wife of Matti told them that after her husband's death, Ismo had started to tell weird stories about how he had actually been at the scene of the fire that day. After being questioned about the case, Junni slowly cracked and described in every detail how he and Matti had got drunk at Matti's cottage that night. This resulted in a brawl between the two men. Junni then bashed his friend over the head with a huge glass bowl, stole his dental prosthesis and yanked out one of his own teeth before setting the house in flames. When the investigation went on, it turned out that there had been many more deaths by house fire in the area. Junni confessed in detail to all his killings over the years and he was able to be connected to the events. In the Municipal Court in Helsinki, Junni recanted his confession and claimed that he was trying to please his examiners. However, he was found guilty of the murder of his wife, Seppo M\u00e4ntyniemi, Juha V\u00e4re, Matti Haapanen and Pauli Sironen, as well as arson, and sentenced to life imprisonment in February 1992. The Helsinki Appellate Court changed his wife's death from assault to negligent homicide, however, the penal sanction did not change. Junni committed suicide in 1995. == Sources == * Pohjolan poliisi kertoo 1993 (Hammasmurhaaja) * * * === References === == See also == * Criminal Investigations from Finland: Hammast Weapon.
