    "text": "Line 14 (Onyx) (), formerly called the Airport Express, is a planned line of the Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos commuter rail system in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil which would originally connect the S\u00e3o Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport to Br\u00e1s Station. The line was planned to have an average interval of six minutes between each station. On May 9, 2013, the Governor of S\u00e3o Paulo Geraldo Alckmin has cancelled the former project, as it seemed no longer viable due to the Federal Government project to establish the Rio\u2013S\u00e3o Paulo high-speed rail. Line 14 would have a special fare estimated in R$ 30.00 (ten times higher than the normal CPTM fare, R$ 3.00 as of 2013). Alternatively the planned Line 13 (Jade) shall be extended up to the airport and keeping the same standard fare prevailing in all CPTM's lines. ==Stations== === 2013 Proposal === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Station !Integration |- |Barra Funda | |- |Br\u00e1s | |- |Engenheiro Goulart |link=Line 12 (CPTM) link=Line 13 (CPTM) |- |Aeroporto | |} === Current Proposal === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Station !Integration |- |S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o |link=Line 13 (CPTM) |- |Jo\u00e3o Paulo | |- |Estrada de Guarulhos | |- |Petrobr\u00e1s | |- |Uni\u00e3o de Vila Nova |link=Line 12 (CPTM) |- |Avenida S\u00e3o Miguel | |- |Vila Jacu\u00ed | |- |Jardim Guarani | |- |Cidade A.
