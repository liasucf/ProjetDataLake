    "text": "The Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional Roberto Clemente or LBPRC formerly known as Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional de Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico Baseball League, is the main professional baseball league in Puerto Rico. It was founded in 1938. In 2007, the LBPRC suspended operations for the first time since its creation. In 2008, the organization resumed operations, after restructuring. These included renaming the league to Puerto Rico Baseball League and establishing a website. In May 2012, the league debuted its current name, choosing to honor hall of famer Roberto Clemente by naming it after him and adopting his philosophy of athletic development. Currently consisting of five teams as of the 2018\u201319 season, the league's champion participates in the Caribbean Series. ==Inception and B\u00e9isbol Rom\u00e1ntico (1938\u20131970)== Puerto Rican Baseball began at the end of the 19th century. The first two clubs were founded in 1897: the Almendares Baseball Club owned by Francisco Alamo Armas, and the Borinquen Baseball Club owned by Santos Filippi.B\u00e9isbol en Puerto Rico According to El Pais newspaper, the first game was played on January 11, 1898 at the old velodrome in Santurce, San Juan. The Borinquen beat the Almendares 3 to 0. The first game to complete nine innings was played on January 30, 1898, when the Borinquen beat the Almendares again, 9 to 3. Enrique Huyke, a professor from Mayag\u00fcez, originally suggested the establishment of an organized baseball league in Puerto Rico. The idea was adopted by Teofilo Maldonado, president of the Commission on Recreation and Sports. A third party, Gabriel Castro, helped Huyke with the scouting of organizations which had to pay a thousand dollars prior to being admitted, while independent entities like the Guayama Rotary Club collaborated in raising funds for the teams. The Liga de B\u00e9isbol Semiprofesional de Puerto Rico (LBSPR) was founded in 1938, as a semi-professional league.Van Hyning et al., p. 7 Six team formed the new organization, these were the Senadores de San Juan, Leones de Ponce, Criollos de Caguas, Brujos de Guayama and Grises Orientales de Humacao.Van Hyning et al., p. 8 The first Puerto Rican players to play in Major League Baseball, Hiram Bithorn and Luis Olmo, were active in the rosters of San Juan and Caguas. Bithorn became the younger manager in the league's history, receiving the office when he was 22 years old.Van Hyning et al., p. 83 Huyke served as manager for Mayag\u00fcez for less than a month, because the team's owner threatened to remove its entry if he did not take the office. Maldonado was named the league's commissioner. Changes in the rosters were allowed only during the first half of the season, meeting a deadline before the beginning of the second half. While the number of games has historically varied from 40 to 80 games per season.Van Hyning et al., p. 10 The All-Star game was scheduled to coincide with the traditional Three Kings Day, an idea suggested by Angel Colon so that the proceeds could be used to buy toys. This date was used for decades, until the emergence of television forced the league to comply with the dates requested by the networks.Van Hyning et al., p. 222 One of the main figures of the league in its early stage was veteran Negro leagues' veteran, Emilio Navarro.Van Hyning et al., p. 78 The Cangrejeros de Santurce and Tiburones de Aguadilla joined the original teams in the 1939\u201340 season. On January 8, 1939, Humacao and San Juan played an 18-inning game that lasted four hours, establishing a record.Van Hyning et al., p. 220 Between 1938 and 1941, the LBSPR was part of the National Semi-Professional Baseball Congress, with titleholder Guayama facing the champions of the Congress' United States branch in best-of-seven series in 1939, where they defeated the Duncan Cementers, and again in 1940, with a roster that included the league's Most Valuable Player, Satchel Paige.Van Hyning et al., p. 9 In 1939\u201340, Perucho Cepeda, the defending batting champion, won the league's batting title over Josh Gibson, who managed to win it the following season.Van Hyning et al., p. 74 The Criollos de Caguas won their first championship in 1940\u201341, defeating the Cangrejeros in the final series. Santurce's Luis Cabrera was the last player to win the LBSPR' Most Valuable Player award.Van Hyning et al., p. 81 On September 14, 1941, Rafael Delgado M\u00e1rquez proposed that the league was renamed to Liga de B\u00e9isbol Profesional de Puerto Rico (LBPPR), effectively moving the league towards professionalism. A format of vueltas (halves) was adoptedPuerto Rico's Winter League: A History of Major League Baseball's Launching Pad. Thomas E. Van Hyning. Page 9. (Jefferson, N.C. : McFarland & Co., 1995) . . Retrieved 3 October 2012. since the league's creation, where the winners of each vuelta facing each other for the championship. However, Ponce managed to win three consecutive championships (1941\u20131945) without having to participate in a final by winning both vueltas. Consequently, the fans of teams that were mathematically eliminated by this format lost interest in the tournament. Some players also concluded their participation in the season after the teams were eliminated. To deal with this issue, the league established a new playoff format, where the top four teams were included. Francisco Coimbre was a key member of Ponce's success with his offensive, winning two batting championships, establishing a league record for most consecutive games with hits and not recording a single strikeout in three consecutive seasons (1939\u201342). The consistency of his performances earned him a Most Valuable Player award. Other players that participated for Ponce included Juan Guilbe Colon (26 June 1914 - 29 April 1994) and Griffin Tirado.Van Hyning et al., p. 80 World War II affected the league directly, reducing the 1942\u201343 season's length with only four active teams. This number of teams continued until 1946, while the rule that allowed the participation of three imported players per team, was suspended from 1942 to 1944. In the 1944\u201345 season, Canena Marquez debuted in the league establishing a record of highest batting average for a rookie with .361, fulfilling the minimum required at-bats.Van Hyning et al., p. 118 The Senadores de San Juan won their first championship on 1945\u201346, defeating the Indios in the finals.Van Hyning et al., p. 89 During this season, Joe Buzas became the first foreign MLB player to manage in the LBPPR.Van Hyning et al., p. 179 Tomas \u201cPlanchardon\u201d Qui\u00f1ones won two back-to-back Most Valuable Player awards from 1943 to 1945.Van Hyning et al., p. 100 In 1947, the league's team participated in a series of five games against the New York Yankees, which featured Ponce defeating the visiting team. Jose \u201cPantalones\u201c Santiago debuted in this season, earning the Rookie of the Year recognition while Canena Marquez broke Josh Gibson's home run record of 13. Vic Power made his debut for the Criollos on the 1947\u201348 season, in which the team won the league's title with a roster that included Rafaelito Ortiz, who was the only pitcher to win 10 or more games for 3 different LBPPR teams.Van Hyning et al., p. 92\u201393 Mayaguez won the 1948\u201349 championship with a roster that included Canena Marquez and Luke Easter.Van Hyning et al., p. 149 That same year, the LBPPR joined the Caribbean Series, beginning a rivalry with the Cuban League's champion that lasted throughout the next decade, until Cuba ceased to participate in the event.Van Hyning et al., p. 231 A decade after its foundation, the league was employing an 80-game schedule. Several new ballparks have been built by the 1949\u201350 season, this was due to an attendance average of 750,000. Each of the stadiums built surpassed 6,000 seats, with Ponce's Paquito Mountaner reaching 9,718 seats by then. The installation of lights that allowed the organizations of games at night increased attendance. Estadio Sixto Escobar had a maximum capacity of over 15,000, with 13,135 seats.Van Hyning et al., p. 11 Percucho Cepeda was one of the league's dominant figures during the 1940s, winning two batting championships and a Most Valuable Player award. Natalio Irizarry won the league's Rookie of the Year recognition in 1949\u201350.Van Hyning et al., p. 120 From 1949\u20131955, the league featured the participation of new MLB players, including Johnny Logan, Harvey Haddix and Hank Aaron among several others.Van Hyning et al., p. 12 The players began choosing the league to play due to its competitive level and warm climate during the winter, a custom that has continued until the current decade. Players of the Negro leagues preferred it due to lack of racism towards the players, as opposed to the United States.Van Hyning et al., p. 84 ===Emergence of Clemente and Cepeda=== In 1952, Roberto Clemente made his debut with the Cangrejeros hitting .234. He was signed by Pedrin Zorilla, debuting in the league as a teenager.Van Hyning et al., p. 53 The team won that year's title and Cot Deal was named MVP.Van Hyning et al., p. 145 Clemente improved this average to .288 the following season, but Santurce finished last in the league.Van Hyning et al., p. 55 The league's champions were the Criollos, who also won the Caribbean Series.Van Hyning et al., p. 58 With a roster that also included Luis Olmo, Willy Mays and Ruben Gomez, the Cangrejeros won the 1954\u201355 championship defeating Caguas in the finals, 4\u20131. During this season, Clemente became the first Puerto Rican player to hit two home runs in the league's All-Star game. The team also went on to win the Caribbean Series, which were held in Venezuela.Van Hyning et al., p. 46 Jim Rivera hand an average of .450 and was named MVP.Van Hyning et al., p. 123 Puerto Rican fans received the team with a parade upon landing and Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn welcomed them in La Fortaleza. In 1955\u201356, the Criollos won the league's championship, in a season that marked Orlando Cepeda's debut in the league. Clemente won the season's batting championship with an average of .396. In 1956\u201357, the league's championship was won by the Indios. During this season, Clemente went on to break the league's record for most games with hits, previously established by Francisco Coimbre in 1943\u201344.Van Hyning et al., p. 60 The following season, the Criollos defeated the Cangrejeros to win the championship. Clemente who now played for Caguas, hit .529 during the final series.Van Hyning et al., p. 61 Juan \"Terin\" Pizarro won the Most Valuable Player Award, leading the league in wins, ERA, best win-to-loss margin and pitched the LBPPR's seventh no-hitter.Van Hyning et al., p. 99 In the Caribbean Series, he defeated Carta Vieja of Panama (8:0), recording 17 strikeouts. Both teams traded the final two championships of the decade. The 1959\u201360 season marked the first instance that LBPPR games were transmitted in two languages through radio.Van Hyning et al., p. 62 The Criollos won the championship, while Mayaguez's Ramon Luis Conde won the Most Valuable Player Award.Van Hyning et al., p. 127 During the 1950s, Puerto Rico's economy experienced significant growth, which propitiated baseball-related gambling.Van Hyning et al., p. 37 This tendency experienced a notable increase in the early 1960s. Other changes were experienced in the game's style with the introduction of more player-managers, such as Luis Olmo's, who became the first to consistently employ pitching coaches and closers in the league.Van Hyning et al., p. 174 Vic Power used other unusual managing techniques, such as using Frank Howard as a relief pitcher as well as becoming the first player-manager to sit himself in favor of a pinch hitter, replacing his turn in the lineup with Herminio Cortes.Van Hyning et al., p. 175 After the Cuban Revolution, hotels and casinos in San Juan benefited from Havana's economic decay.Van Hyning et al., p. 42 During this timeframe, Puerto Rico expanded its presence in the Caribbean, and a native team frequently played against a representation of St. Thomas and Saint Croix in February.Van Hyning et al., p. 126 Julio Navarro was drafted from one of these exhibitions, eventually becoming one of the league's dominant pitchers. The Dominican Winter League was still not a member of the Caribbean Confederation back then, which allowed uncommon interleague trades between it and the LBPPR, which would have more trouble negotiating such deals with member leagues. During this decade, some of the league's teams would provide import players with houses and taxis for transportation. The Senadores de San Juan, led by Clemente, who had just won the MLB World Series with Pittsburgh, won the league's 1960\u201361 season, as well as Jose Santiago, who recorded a record of 10\u20132 with an ERA of 2.44 for the team.Van Hyning et al., p. 63 Luis \"Tite\" Arroyo won the season's Most Valuable Player award, registering a record of 10\u20132 with an ERA of 1.64.Van Hyning et al., p. 102 Due to political tension, the Caribbean Series that were planned to take place in Habana were cancelled. The event was replaced by the Interamerican Series, which San Juan attended with a roster that included pitcher Florentino Rivera. The Interamerican Series were held three more times, with each team winning the one held in their home field. Mayaguez did so in 1963, in a series where Terin Pizarro recorded the only no-hitter in the history of the event, in a win over Valencia at the opening night.Van Hyning et al., p. 232 In 1961\u201362, the Lobos de Arecibo joined the league as an expansion team. On January 14, 1962, Julio Navarro pitched the first regular season no-hitter. For the 1962\u201363 season, Estadio Sixto Escobar was replaced by the Hiram Bithorn Stadium, with a capacity of 20,000 seats by then. In 1963\u201364, Clemente finished second with a batting average of .345, leading the Senadores to the title.Van Hyning et al., p. 65 San Juan once again played in the Interamerican Series, held in Nicaragua. In 1964\u201365, Orlando Cepeda joined the Cangrejeros, replacing Jim Beauchamp helping the team win the league's championship. During this season, Clemente was named San Juan' player-manager, leading them to the playoffs.Van Hyning et al., p. 66 The All-Star game featured a format where Latin American players faced North American players.Van Hyning et al., p. 67 The following season featured the debut of Jerry Morales who won the league's Rookie of the Year recognition after participating for Puerto Rico's national baseball team in the 1966 Central American and Caribbean Games.Van Hyning et al., p. 104 Carlos Bernier retired in 1966, having won five stolen base titles for a total of 285.

Nino Escalera, who finished his career third on the league's hit list, replaced Vic Power as the team's manager during this season.Van Hyning et al., p. 125 On December 20, 1969, Santurce and Arecibo participated in the only LBPPR game played outside of Puerto Rico, held in the United States Virgin Islands to honor Elrod Hendricks.Van Hyning et al., p. 48 ==Increase of native international players (1970\u20132000)== Ponce won the second of back-to-back championships in 1969\u201370 as well as the Caribbean Series' title being led in both by Conde's offensive.Van Hyning et al., p. 128 Wayne Simpson was selected MVP.Van Hyning et al., p. 157 The Cangrejeros won the 1970\u201371 championship, defeating the Criollos in the finals.Van Hyning et al., p. 69 Ponce's Santos Alomar Sr. won the league's batting championship and was named MVP, while Willie Monta\u00f1ez of Caguas led the league in home runs after recording 30 in Major League Baseball.Van Hyning et al., p. 103 Clemente returned to serve as San Juan's manager for the season, naming Nino Escalera as his coach.Van Hyning et al., p. 68 He only accepted the work for a year, expecting Escalera to replace him during the following season. The team advanced to the playoffs, losing their series against Santurce. Clemente also managed Puerto Rico to a win in the All-Star game, which featured a format of natives versus foreign players.Van Hyning et al., p. 70 He was succeeded as Santurce's manager by Frank Robinson on the 1971\u201372 season. Ruben Gomez also performed in the office temporarily, while Robinson attended a tour in Japan with Baltimore.Van Hyning et al., p. 96\u201397 The Cangrejeros won the 1972\u201373 title. That season's All-Star game was dedicated in Clemente's honor, who died a week before while transporting supplies to victims of the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake.Van Hyning et al., p. 71 Both native and foreign players won a black band on their arms to symbolize grief. The Criollos won the 1973\u201374 championship, possessing the league's strongest native lineup. Jerry Morales led the team, hitting 14 home runs as Caguas' lead-off hitter.Van Hyning et al., p. 105 Eduardo Figueroa led the league in wins on back-to-back seasons, recording 10-3 twice from 1973\u201375. This was the first year that the league employed the designated hitter rule, including the position in the batting lineups. Gomez who had continued pitching for Santurce, retired in the 1975\u201376 season. By this time, he has played for nine champion teams and worked under nine managers. The Crillos won the 1976\u201377 championship, being led by the league's MVP, Jose Cruz.Van Hyning et al., p. 107 The Indios won the title the following season with a lineup that included MVP Kurt Bevaqua and went on to win the Caribbean Series held in Mazatlan, Mexico, Jose Manuel Morales leading all batters with a .421 average.Van Hyning et al., p. 130Van Hyning et al., p. 170 Caguas won its ninth championship in the 1978\u201379 season.

In May 2008, it was announced that the league would come back for the 2008\u201309 season, and that the Manati Athenians would be moved once again to Santurce, and become the Santurce Crabbers. As part of the restructuring, Major League Baseball offered to work to increase publicity. On July 15, 2008, personnel from the league and Major League Baseball participated in a meeting where details about the league's merchandising were discussed. Ponce was the first team to classify to the post season, leading the league. Arecibo and Santurce also classified directly. The last space for the playoffs was decided with a \"sudden death\" game, with Mayag\u00fcez defeating Caguas in with scores of 6\u20130. On January 8, the players from eliminated teams participated in a special draft, with players including Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez, Sa\u00fal Rivera and Luis Matos going to new teams. The Indios and Cangrejeros were eliminated in the semifinals, with Ponce and Arecibo advancing. In the finals, the Leones won the first game, only losing the second before dominating three straight to win the league's championship. On October 2, 2009, Garc\u00eda resigned his position as president of the league, citing \"personal reasons\". Subsequently, Sadi Antonmattei was elected by the board of directors to serve as president. On October 19, 2009, the league revealed a contract with WIPR-TV to broadcast its games. The 2009\u201310 season was inaugurated on November 20, 2009, with games between Ponce versus Carolina and Arecibo versus Mayag\u00fcez-Aguadilla. This year marked the first time that the league only had five active participants since 1993\u201394, due to the Cangrejeros' recess. During this season, the inter-league games with the Dominican Winter Baseball League continued being included in the official record books of both organizations. Indios de Mayag\u00fcez won the 2009\u201310 season, their 16th championship (most in the league) when they defeated the Criollos de Caguas 4 games to 1. Three games in this series went to extra innings. ===Criollos back to back; special tournament (2017\u20132018)=== Due to the passing of hurricane Maria over Puerto Rico in 2017, the league was forced to adopt emergency measures prior to the 2017-18 season, abridging the schedule to only one month (being played in January 2018, in order to qualify and being able to defend the Caribbean Series championship), concessions were made to allow Mayag\u00fcez and Aguadilla to operate as a single team and changing the rules to play only daytime games due to infrastructure damage and to reschedule games if necessary. Other changes proposed included the creation of a third team in San Juan, which would feature foreign players in order to market to their diaspora in the city. With one week remaining and all teams still in contention, additional rules were implemented to break a tie by using the goal average if necessary for postseason seeding. By winning the abridged tournament, the Criollos won their 18th title and tied the Indios as the two most successful teams. ==Caribbean Series== Despite being a club competition and not being relevant for IBAF rankings, the Confederaci\u00f3n de B\u00e9isbol Profesional del Caribe (CBPC) allows the participating teams the option to wear their regular team colors or a variant of the uniform used by the national team of the league's base country. ===Dream Team (1995)=== In 1995, the Senadores de San Juan managed by Luis \"Torito\" Mel\u00e9ndez, assembled one of the strongest teams in the history of the Caribbean Series. The group, which was dubbed \"Dream Team\", featured Major League Baseball players in most positions, counting with a lineup that included Roberto Alomar, Carlos Baerga, Bernie Williams, Juan Gonz\u00e1lez, Edgar Mart\u00ednez, Carlos Delgado, Rub\u00e9n Sierra, Rey S\u00e1nchez and Carmelo Mart\u00ednez. Puerto Rico's offensive dominated the tournament, eventually winning the Caribbean Series' championship with an undefeated record of 6-0. The team was responsible for the only two losses of the Dominican Republic, the country that finished second, scoring victories against Pedro Mart\u00ednez and Jos\u00e9 Rijo in the third and sixth games respectively. ===End of drought (2017)=== After securing the title of the 2016\u201317 season, the Criollos de Caguas won the Caribbean Series by defeating \u00c1guilas de Mexicali (1\u20130), the first for the league in 17 years and the first for manager Luis Matos in his rookie season. ===Back to back (2018)=== As the winner of the special abridged tournament of 2018, the Criollos entered the Caribbean Series as the defending champions. The Criollos defeated the \u00c1guilas del Cibao in the final with a score of 9\u20134. By winning his second consecutive Caribbean Series in his first two tries, manager Luis Matos tied the record of consecutive titles held solely by Nap Reyes of Tigres de Marianao for six decades. ==Current Teams== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Team !City (all in Puerto Rico) !Stadium !Capacity |- |Criollos de Caguas |Caguas |Parque Yldefonso Sol\u00e1 Morales |align=center|10,000 |- |Gigantes de Carolina |Carolina |Roberto Clemente Stadium |align=center|12,500 |- |Indios de Mayag\u00fcez |Mayag\u00fcez |Isidoro Garc\u00eda Baseball Stadium |align=center|10,500 |- |Tiburones de Aguadilla |Aguadilla |Luis A.
