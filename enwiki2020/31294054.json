Rohit Rao of DVD Talk rated it 2 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"Van Damme and Adkins show up to the party, game for anything, but director Ernie Barbarash insists on weighing them down with a convoluted script that mistakes meanness for grit.\" Gabe Toro of Indiewire rated it C and wrote, \"The fight choreography doesn\u2019t lift this effort above Van Damme\u2019s usual direct-to-DVD offerings, but it does prove that there are still filmmakers who understand how to shoot action.\" Ike Oden of DVD Verdict described it as \"a cheesy, pretentious, and poorly paced action film with a jet black nihilistic streak\".
