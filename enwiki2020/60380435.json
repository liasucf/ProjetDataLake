He got 13 more starts after that, and finished the Western League season with a 5\u20133 record with 1 complete game, and a 3.84 ERA. He was finally given the chance to debut in the main squad in the Giants match on October 1 where he pitched a scoreless 9th inning to help secure Hanshin's shutout victory. Due to overexertion however, he sustained an injury on his right elbow during post- season training which prompted the coaches to stop him from pitching for a while. 2017 Despite improvement in his pitching velocity (155 km/h at that time), he experienced lower back pain in April that needed long-term rehabilitation.
