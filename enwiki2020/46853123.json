    "text": "De Valk is a tower mill and museum in Leiden, Netherlands. The current tower mill is the third mill built at this location. In 1611 the post mill \"De Valck\" was built, and in 1667 it was replaced by a wooden post mill. In 1743 a higher tower mill was built. De Valk originally was equipped with six mill stones. There were two dwellings in the mill, originally for the two owners, later for the miller and his assistant. In June 1966 the mill became a municipal museum. In 2000, the De Valk mill became operationally functional again and has been used for milling. == Gallery == File:Gevelsteen aan de zuidkant van ronde stenen stellingmolen - AMR Molenfoto - 20540487 - RCE.jpg|Gable at the south side File:INTERIEUR, AANDRIJVING MECHANIEK - Leiden - 20263757 - RCE.jpg|Machinery File:Molensteen 3.jpg|Mill stones File:Molentandwieloverbrenging 2.jpg|Gears File:Leiden_- _Molen_De_Valk_%2B_reloj_de_sol_20060810.jpg|Mill with sun dial in front (2006) File:Leiden,_NL-6737.jpg|View from canal the Galgenwater, between Beestenmarkt and Turfmarkt (1973) File:Molen \"de Valk\".JPG|Night view (2009) File:Korenmolen_\"De_Valk\"_in_feesttooi_ter_gelegenheid_van_3_oktober_- _Leiden_-_20137631_-_RCE.jpg|Adorned sails signalling festivities, during yearly October 3 Festival (1961) File:Korenmolen \"De Valk\" in rouwstand naar aanleiding van bijzetting te Delft van Koningin Wilhelmina - Leiden - 20137630 - RCE.jpg|Sails at angle signalling mourning, at death of Queen Wilhelmina (1962) == External links == * Stedelijk Molenmuseum De Valk Category:Tower mills in the Netherlands Category:Museums in Leiden Category:Towers completed in 1743 ",
