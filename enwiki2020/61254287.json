He took office in January 2014, and became the youngest mayor in Clarkston's 135-year history. In his first year of office, he presided over a city council that ended Clarkston's moratorium on refugee resettlement, made Clarkston a charted City of Compassion and Welcoming City, and signed the Supreme Court Amicus Brief in support of legalizing same-sex marriage.

He won the nomination in the August 11th runoff election with 58.6% of the vote.
