    "text": "(the) New Release is the second and final studio album by American nu metal band Primer 55. Released on August 14, 2001, the album peaked at #1 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart and #102 on the Billboard 200. It had one single, \"This Life,\" which peaked at #37 on Mainstream Rock Tracks. This would be the band's final record with Island Records, who allegedly cut support shortly after the album's release due to the September 11 attacks. ==Recording== Primer 55 had underdone various lineup changes preceding and during the recording process of (the) New Release. After the band's first eighteen months of touring, guitarist Bobby Burns started writing the band's second major label album. He played all guitars and bass in the studio and brought in ex- Helmet drummer John Stanier. While in the studio, Burns also began talks with drummer Preston Nash of Dope with whom Primer 55 had previously toured. By May 2001, the band had officially recruited former Cut.Love.Kill bassist Chris Sprinkle but mere weeks later announced Kobie Jackson as their new bassist.

Regarding the band's new musical direction, Bobby Burns stated \"I just grew very, very sick of the whole music scene last year... All the plastic bands that were put together by record companies, etc. I didn't want to hear any of that music any longer... So I didn't... I went back to what was real to me and what made me feel good growing up... Sabbath, Zeppelin, and Kiss... Back then you could tell all those bands apart, and music of today just sounds like the same records made over and over with all the same guitar sounds and shit.\" Vocalist Jason \"J-Sin\" Luttrell remarked in 2001 that \"During the writing and recording period, we never listened to the radio or watched MTV because we didn't want any outside influences creeping into the songs. We wanted everything to be fresh.\"http://thegauntlet.com/bio/332/Primer-55 ==Promotion and touring== By mid-May, Primer 55 announced the title and release date of their upcoming album as well as its lead single. A tentative track listing was announced in June but later modified. The band released various tracks from (the) New Release, including a rough mix of its upcoming single, on their official website in the months leading up to its release.June 2001 Music Archive (June 2001).

Although Burns had hoped to see \"Texas\" become the second single, (the) New Release featured only one single, the aggressive, industrial laden \"This Life\" which was released to radio on July 16. It had no accompanying video but gained moderate radio rotation in late summer and early fall of 2001. The track was also included on More Fast and Furious: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture The Fast and the Furious and Nu Rock Traxx, Vol. 32. Promotion was allegedly cut short by Island, forcing the album's success to rely heavily on touring. From June through August, the group joined Fear Factory's The Evolution of Revolution tour. Primer 55 then supported Vision of Disorder for some August dates.Archive News - June 25, 2001 Blabbermouth.net (June 25, 2001).
