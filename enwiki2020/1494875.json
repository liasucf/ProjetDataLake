It was originally capable of carrying a payload of to an apogee of ; an upgrade, sometimes known as \"Hopi Plus\", increased the apogee to .Jacobs and Whitney 1962, p. 80. The Hopi-Dart was developed for NASA Marshall Space Fight Center to obtain wind speeds at altitudes from 70 to 90 kilometers in support of Saturn launches. Design was headed by Charles W. Watson.Morris and Pines 2000, p. 195. ==Operational history== Eleven test and eleven operational aeronomy missions were flown, with Wallops Island, the Tonopah Test Range, and the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 43 being used as launch sites.Morris and Pines 2000, p. 197-199. Four of the test launches were failures. After flight 18 significant modifications wwere made. The modifications were to the interstage, propellant formulation, and the rocket nozzle. The redesigned first stage was renamed the Hopi III.Morris and Pines 2000, p. 199. Hopi III-Dart was replaced by the Super Loki-Dart of Space Data Corporation.Morris and Pines 2000, p. 200. ==References== ;Citations ;Bibliography * * Category:Sounding rockets of the United States ",
