    "text": "The Eurasian cuisine is a 'fusion' cuisine, mainly existing still in Singapore and Malaysia. ==Origins== In general, Eurasians are people of any mixed European and Asian ancestry. However, if referring to Eurasian cuisine, usually the amalgamation of Portuguese, Dutch, British, Chinese, Malay, and also Indian and Peranakan influences is meant. Within this cuisine, ingredients in European dishes are replaced or complemented by Asian ingredients. Conversely, European ingredients are used in Asian dishes. For example, cream in European recipes is replaced by coconut cream and dried Chinese sausage (lap cheong) is used instead of chorizo. Also, the use of soy sauce, chilli and ginger is used interchangeably with vinegar, mustard and Worcestershire sauce. ==Definition== There is no clear definition of what can be specified as Eurasian. Some dishes are also found in Indonesian, Malaysian and Chinese cuisines. By local adaptation(s), or by its ubiquitous presence within the Eurasian community, a dish is sometimes considered \"Eurasian\". ==Dishes== * Shepherd's pie (British), a traditional dish with meat and mashed potatoes with the addition of soy sauce, oyster sauce, Chinese mushrooms and garlic. * Oxtail stew (British), a stew with cinnamon, soy sauce and star anise. *Chicken chop, a grill-fried boneless chicken thigh marinated in a mix of soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce, usually served in a black pepper or mushroom sauce with a side of fries and vegetables. * Devil's curry or curry debal (Portuguese), chicken in a sauce of chilli, galangal, vinegar and kemiri nuts (candle nuts). * Kueh kochi pulot hitam, a cake of black and white glutinous rice flour with a filling of mung beans or coconut. * Banana salad with egg, lettuce, cilantro and chili chukka (a dip of chilli, sugar, vinegar, garlic, light soy sauce and ginger). * Curry feng, a spicy Eurasian curry dish containing minced beef or pork; minced pig\u2019s kidney, liver, stomach, tripe and tongue; and various spices * Semur, a type of meat stew (mainly beef), that is braised in thick brown gravy. ==Literature== * Gomes, Mary (2009), The Eurasian Cookbook, Horizon Books, Singapore, * Hutton, Wendy (2003), Eurasian Favourites, Periplus Mini Cookbooks, Periplus, Singapore, * Pereira, Quentin (2012), Eurasian Heritage Cooking, Marshall Cavendish Cuisine, Singapore, * D'Silva, Damian (2012), Rebel with a Course, Ate, Singapore, ==See also== * Eurasians in Singapore * Fusion cuisine * Indo cuisine * Kristang people * List of Asian cuisines Category:Cuisine by continent Category:Singaporean fusion cuisine Category:Malaysian fusion cuisine Category:European cuisine ",
