    "text": "Triggernometry is the fifth album from hardcore rap group Onyx, released on July 22, 2003, by D3 Entertainment. The whole album was produced by Kronic Tones. The album features appearances by American rappers T Hussle, Genovese, Begetz, X1, Bad Luck, Dirty Getinz. The album peaked at No. 66 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums music chart. == Background == Triggernometry is an album consisting of 10 new tracks and 11 stories from the life of the group Onyx, told by the group members themselves in the gap between the songs. All the songs were produced by one producer Kronic Tones, who had already produced 7 tracks for Fredro Starr's second solo album Don't Get Mad Get Money. The album was criticized by the fans of the group Onyx, who believe that such production is suitable only for nightclubs, but not for the streets. Originally, the album was due out on October 31 under the title Triggernometry: The Study of Guns, but later the name was shortened to Triggernometry, and the album was released earlier. == Singles == The one and only single, \"Mama Cryin'/Wild N Here\" featuring X1, Begetz, Dirty Getinz, Bad Luck was released in 2003. ==Critical response== On the album, despite the frightening the name \"Triggernometry\" (a mixture of the words \"trigger\" and \"trigonometry\"), it became noticeably less street negligence and noticeably more \"musical\". If you do not listen to the lyrics - the album is quite funny, with a fervent presentation of the lyrics, good rhythm and various pleasant finds in the accompaniment. If you listen - the album is even more funny. Well done. ==Track listing== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! # ! track ! featured guest(s) ! producer(s) ! length |- | 01. | \"Trigonometry Intro\" | | | 0:58 |- | 02. | \"Gun Clap Music\" | | Kronic Tones | 4:08 |- | 03. | \"Stick Up\" | | | 0:27 |- | 04. | \"JMJ\" | | Kronic Tones | 4:10 |- | 05. | \"Def Scams\" | | | 0:39 |- | 06. | \"Street Is Us\" | T Hussle | Kronic Tones | 2:52 |- | 07. | \"Source Awards\" | | | 1:04 |- | 08. | \"Wild N Here\" | | Kronic Tones | 3:58 |- | 09. | \"'93 Flex\" | | | 0:39 |- | 10. | \"O.N.Y.X.
