Several smaller volcanic cones and craters dot its slopes, including a crater hosting one of the island's three lakes, Rano Aroi. Map of Rapa Nui showing Terevaka, Poike and Rano Kau Terevaka from space with Hanga Roa above and Rano Kau at top - a west up photo from Nasa While Terevaka forms the bulk of Easter Island, the island has two older volcanic peaks; Poike which forms the eastern headland and Rano Kau the southern. Terevaka last erupted in the Pleistocene and is less than 400,000 years old. Its lava field at Roiho has been dated at between 110,000 and 150,000 years old. Terevaka is an easy walk up on a trail that starts next to the moai at Ahu Akivi, by foot or horse. It is often very windy at the top. Terevaka is the 12th most topographically isolated summit on Earth. ==See also== * List of volcanoes in Chile * List of islands by highest point * Topographic isolation ==References== * * Kaneoka I, Katsui Y, 1985.
