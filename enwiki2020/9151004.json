    "text": "\"Desire\" is a song written by Barry Gibb, Robin Gibb and Maurice Gibb, and originally recorded by the Bee Gees in 1978 during the sessions of Spirits Having Flown. Blue Weaver recalls that this version was originally intended for the album. After spending weeks on it, they dropped it from the album lineup. Weaver also recalls that the version sounded like \"Too Much Heaven\". ==Andy Gibb version== The single was recorded with a new lead vocal by Andy Gibb during a studio session in 1979, and released as the lead single on what would be his final studio album. The instrumental tracks used are from the original recording sessions laid down by the Bee Gees in 1978. The copyright for this song gives the artist as the 'Bee Gees' and was registered on July 11, 1979. Desire was Andy's first new single since September 1978. Andy's version of \"Desire\" was released as a single in January 1980 and included on his last studio album After Dark reaching number four on the Billboard Hot 100. Any sense that Andy was channeling the Bee Gees rather than finding his own way would be confirmed here, as all three of his brothers were heard in the background. This is one of two songs to feature all four Gibb brothers (the other being Andy's final song, \"Arrow Through The Heart\", issued posthumously in 2010, 23 years after it was originally recorded.) His version would be his last top ten single in the United States. In other countries this single and its B-side \"Waiting For You\" which was from his Shadow Dancing album were released as a double A. The song was included as the last track on Andy Gibb's Greatest Hits, his first compilation album, as well as Greatest Hits Collection and 20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection. ===Personnel=== *Andy Gibb \u2014 lead and background vocals *Barry Gibb \u2014 harmony and background vocals, orchestral arrangement *Hugh McCracken \u2014 electric guitar *Joey Murcia \u2014 electric guitar *George Terry \u2014 electric guitar *George Bitzer \u2014 keyboards *Harold Cowart \u2014 bass *Ron Ziegler \u2014 drums *Robin Gibb \u2014 background vocals (from 1978) *Maurice Gibb \u2014 background vocals (from 1978) *Albhy Galuten \u2014 orchestral arrangement ===Charts=== ====Peak positions==== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Charts (1980) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) |align=center|90 |- |Belgium (Ultratop) |align=center|8 |- |Canada (RPM) |align=center|10 |- |Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) |align=center|7 |- |Germany (Media Control Charts) |align=center|36 |- |Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) |align=center|21 |- |New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |align=center|38 |- |Spain (PROMUSICAE) |align=center|7 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 |align=center|4 |- |US Billboard Easy Listening Tracks |align=center|9 |- |US Billboard Hot Soul Singles |align=center|49 |- |US Cash Box |align=center|6 |- |US Radio & Records |align=center|7 |- |US Record World |align=center|4 |} ====Year-end charts==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1980) !Position |- |align=\"left\"|Belgium (Ultratop) |align=\"center\"|17 |- |align=\"left\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) |align=\"center\"|41 |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |align=\"center\"|40 |- |US Top Pop Singles (Billboard) |align=\"center\"|58 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1980 songs Category:1980 singles Category:Songs written by Barry Gibb Category:Songs written by Maurice Gibb Category:Songs written by Robin Gibb Category:Bee Gees songs Category:Andy Gibb songs Category:Song recordings produced by Barry Gibb Category:Song recordings produced by Robin Gibb Category:Song recordings produced by Maurice Gibb Category:RSO Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Albhy Galuten Category:Funk ballads Category:Soul ballads ",
