    "text": "Longsight is an inner city area of Manchester, England, south of the city centre, bounded by Ardwick and West Gorton to the north, Belle Vue to the east, Levenshulme to the south, and Chorlton-on-Medlock, Victoria Park and Fallowfield to the west. Historically in Lancashire, it had a population of 15,429 at the 2011 census. ==History== Longsight is an ethnically diverse area, with high levels of poverty, deprivation and crime. For many years, Longsight has been plagued by gang related violence, similar to that of nearby Moss Side. Most of the violence came from tensions between two rival gangs which fought \"turf wars\" with each other since the 1990s, resulting in many shootings and several deaths. The Gooch Gang, from neighbouring Moss Side, were jailed in 2009, Consequently, gun crime in Greater Manchester as a whole has fallen dramatically, from a high of 120 gang-related shootings in 2006 to just 16 in 2011. ==Governance== Longsight electoral ward within Manchester City Council. Longsight has been in the parliamentary constituency of Manchester Gorton since boundary changes in 1983. The seat has been represented in Westminster by Afzal Khan since June 2017. ;Councillors The area is represented on Manchester City Council by three councillors, currently Abid Chohan, Luthfur Rahman and Suzanne Richards. Abid Chohan was initially a Lib Dem councillor but defected to Labour ahead of the local council elections in 2010. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor!!colspan=\"2\"|Councillor |- | 2004 | style=\"background-color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Mohammed Sajjad (Lib Dem) | style=\"background-color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Abid Chohan (Lib Dem) | style=\"background-color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Liaqat Ali (Lib Dem) |- | 2006 | style=\"background-color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Maryam Khan (Lab) | style=\"background-color: \" | | Abid Chohan (Lib Dem) | style=\"background-color: \" | | Liaqat Ali (Lib Dem) |- | 2007 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Maryam Khan (Lab) | style=\"background-color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Abid Chohan (Lib Dem) | style=\"background-color: \" | | Liaqat Ali (Lib Dem) |- | 2008 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Maryam Khan (Lab) | style=\"background-color: \" | | Abid Chohan (Lib Dem) | style=\"background-color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Luthfur Rahman (Lab) |- | 2010 | style=\"background-color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Suzanne Richards (Lab) | style=\"background-color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#FF8C00\"| Abid Chohan (Lab) | style=\"background-color: \" | | Luthfur Rahman (Lab) |- | 2011 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Suzanne Richards (Lab) | style=\"background- color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Abid Chohan (Lab) | style=\"background-color: \" | | Luthfur Rahman (Lab) |- | 2012 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Suzanne Richards (Lab) | style=\"background-color: \" | | Abid Chohan (Lab) | style=\"background-color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Luthfur Rahman (Lab) |- | 2014 | style=\"background-color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Suzanne Richards (Lab) | style=\"background-color: \" | | Abid Chohan (Lab) | style=\"background- color: \" | | Luthfur Rahman (Lab) |- | 2015 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Suzanne Richards (Lab) | style=\"background-color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Abid Chohan (Lab) | style=\"background-color: \" | | Luthfur Rahman (Lab) |- | 2016 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Suzanne Richards (Lab) | style=\"background-color: \" | | Abid Chohan (Lab) | style=\"background-color: \" | |bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Luthfur Rahman (Lab) |- | 2018 | style=\"background- color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Suzanne Richards (Lab) | style=\"background- color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Luthfur Rahman (Lab) | style=\"background- color: \" | | bgcolor=\"#99CCFF\"| Abid Chohan (Lab) |- | 2019 |} indicates seat up for re-election. indicates councillor defected. ==Geography== Much of the housing stock of Longsight consists of red-brick terraced houses Previously known as Grindlow Marsh, it was incorporated into the City of Manchester in 1890.
