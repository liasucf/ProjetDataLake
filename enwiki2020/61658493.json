    "text": "Jonathan Binns M.D (1747-1818) was an English Quaker and abolitionist notable for being one of only two signatories from Liverpool who signed a 1783 parliamentary petition calling for the abolition of Slavery. == Life == Binns was born in 1747 to leather seller Johnathan Binns (1718-1794) and his wife Eliz Sutcliffe (1719-1748). Having trained under his maternal uncle as an apothecary he worked as a Chemist for a short while before pursuing a degree in Edinburgh in 1772. Returning to Liverpool to practice medicine he married Mary Allbright (1748-1833) and built his home on Bold Street. The couple had two children. In 1783 at an annual meeting in London of members of the Religious Society of Friends Binns signed a petition submitted to parliament requesting an end to export of slaves by officers of the Royal African Company. Of the 273 Quakers who signed only Binns and ship merchant William Rathbone IV were from Liverpool, a city which by 1795 was handling over 40% of the entire European slave trade. Binns opposition to slavery didn't go unnoticed in the city making him an unpopular character and the subject of plots against his life. Leaving Liverpool during the height of his career; possibly due to his views on slavery, he became an honorary superintendent of Quaker institution Ackworth School and later retired to Lancaster where he continued to practice until his death in 1818. == References == Category:English abolitionists Category:1747 births Category:1818 deaths Category:People from Liverpool Category:English Quakers Category:People in health professions from Merseyside Category:Christian abolitionists ",
