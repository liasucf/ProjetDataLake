    "text": "Pomham Rocks Light (also known as \"Pomham Lighthouse\") is a historic lighthouse in the Providence River about off the shoreline of the Riverside neighborhood of the city of East Providence, Rhode Island. The light was established in 1871. The light was one of a group of New England lighthouses built to the same plan after an award-winning design by a Vermont architect. Nearly identical lights were constructed at Sabin Point, Rose Island, Esopus Meadows Light and Colchester Reef. It was deactivated in 1974, but relighted on July 30, 2006. The light was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Pomham Rocks Light Station on July 9, 1979. In the 1970s the light was sold to The American Lighthouse Foundation, and is today managed by the Friends of Pomham Rocks Lighthouse. == List of keepers == # C.H.
