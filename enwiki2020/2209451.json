    "text": "Jules Louis Gabriel Violle (16 November 1841 \u2013 12 September 1923) was a French physicist and inventor. He is notable for having determined the solar constant at Mont Blanc in 1875, and, in 1881, for proposing a standard for luminous intensity, called the Violle, equal to the light emitted by 1 cm\u00b2 of platinum at its melting point. It was notable as the first unit of light intensity that did not depend on the properties of a particular lamp. This was much larger than traditional measures such as candlepower, so the standard SI unit candela was originally defined in 1946 as 1/60 Violle. Throughout his life, Violle taught at several colleges including the University of Lyon and the Conservatoire des Arts et M\u00e9tiers in Paris. He was one of the founders of the Institut d'optique th\u00e9orique et appliqu\u00e9e and the \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure d'optique. He improved and invented a number of devices for measuring radiation, and determined the freezing and melting points of palladium. Violle is believed by some to be the secret identity of Fulcanelli, a contemporary French alchemist whose true identity is still debated. His biography can be found in this book: \"A l'ombre des ch\u00eanes, l'alchimiste de la R\u00e9publique\". ==External links== * Category:1841 births Category:1923 deaths Category:People from Langres Category:French physicists Category:\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences Category:Commandeurs of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur ",
