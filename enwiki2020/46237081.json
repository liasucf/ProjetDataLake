The company was formed in 1999 after Avid Aircraft initially went out of business in 1998. Avid was restarted, but went out of business for the final time in November 2003. Airdale initially started making parts for Avid designs and later put the two- seat Avid Mk IV back into production. The Mk IV was further developed into the Airdale Backcountry by John Larsen, an aircraft initially called the Airdale Airdale. A conversion kit to modify Mk IVs to Backcountry standard is available. The company also produces an improved landing gear set for the Avid Mk IV design, called Bushgear. At one time the company also produced the Avid Magnum as a kit aircraft. As of mid 2017 the company was no longer trading. == Aircraft == {| class=\"wikitable\" align=center style=\"font-size:90%;\" |- |+ align=center style=\"background:#BFD7FF\"| Summary of aircraft built by Airdale Sportplane and Supply |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" !
