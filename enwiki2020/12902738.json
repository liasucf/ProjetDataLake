The sole species is Octomeles sumatrana,TPL: Octomeles sumatrana Miq. (6 February 2018)Tropicos: O. sumatrana Miq. (6 February 2018) sometimes written O. sumatranum.GBIF: Octomeles sumatranum Miq. (6 February 2018) Octomeles sumatrana is found in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, and the Solomon Islands. It and Tetrameles nudiflora are the only two species in the family Tetramelaceae. They were previously classified in the Datiscaceae but found genetically to not form a natural clade with the other members of that family. The tree is dioecious and large: reaching up to 75 m in height. A pioneer species, it regenerates quickly in disturbed habitats such as logged forest and previously-cultivated land. ==References== Category:Tetramelaceae Category:Monotypic Cucurbitales genera Category:Flora of Malesia Category:Flora of Borneo Category:Trees of Brunei Category:Trees of New Guinea Category:Trees of Papuasia Category:Trees of Sulawesi Category:Trees of Sumatra Category:Trees of the Philippines Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
