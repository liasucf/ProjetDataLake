The Emperor's Riddles turned out to be a bestselling thriller with the media calling it \"a hit with young readers\". Porus created by Swastik Productions was one of the most expensive and acclaimed shows on Indian television. Satyarth's biography of screen legend Sridevi titled Sridevi - The Eternal Screen Goddess published in 2019 by Penguin Random House also went on to win high praise. Satyarth has been named one of the Top 50 Indian authors to follow on social media. ==Early life== Satyarth was born in Cuttack, Odisha. Spending his growing up years across cities like Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Chennai and New Delhi, he's currently settled in Mumbai. Satyarth holds a Masters in English Literature from St. Stephen's College, Delhi. Working as a Correspondent with CNN-IBN from 2007 to 2011, Satyarth was felicitated with the SAARC Heal Award in 2008. During this phase, his short stories won the British Council prize and also appeared in the Chicken Soup for the Soul series. In 2011, he quit journalism to become a full-time author and screenwriter. ==As Author== ===The Emperor's Riddles=== Satyarth with Shobha De at Bangalore Lit Fest 2014 The idea for The Emperor's Riddles was born out of a random Internet search by Nayak after reading the Dan Brown thriller Angels & Demons to find out if there was something similarly esoteric and mysterious hidden in the history of India. The surfing yielded an obscure but fascinating conspiracy theory involving one of the greatest Emperors of ancient India. Nayak was intrigued by the Emperor's legend and the imperial secret believed to be still alive and functioning and decided to capture this story. The first draft took about six months and was ready in 2011. The manuscript was accepted by Red Ink Literary Agency and subsequently underwent another round of editing. Nayak received publishing offers from Rupa & Co. and Amaryllis and he eventually signed the deal with Amaryllis in 2012. The book was first released at the New Delhi World Book Fair in February 2014. The Emperor's Riddles was met with a positive response. The book earned acclaim from other mystery writers, with Amish Tripathi calling it \"a fantastic blend of myth, imagination and mystery\", and Ashwin Sanghi describing it as \"Intelligent, Intriguing, Imaginative, Intense\". While The Times of India called it a \"history meets mystery\", Hindustan Times called it \"a gripping tale of intrigue\" and lauded the book for its \"taut narration and interesting climax\". HT Brunch magazine included the book in its Summer Reading List of 2014, calling it \"a celebration of our great Indian civilisation and its scientific genius\" and recommending it for those who like \"riddles and cool mythological references\". Yahoo praised the book as an \"extraordinary tale of riddles\". The Hindu described it as a \"concoction of mystery, thriller, legend\" and a \"national bestseller\" while The Pioneer lauded how \"history is being explored by the new-age writers like never before\". The New Indian Express declared the thriller \"a hit with young readers\" and said it \"opened a completely different avenue for budding writers to experiment with\". While English Vinglish director Gauri Shinde called the book \"an acclaimed thriller\" via Twitter, the SpectralHues book review said the thriller's \"shock twist towards the end makes you feel so ignorant\" and that \"a Christopher Nolan of the West or our very own Anurag Kashyap can pretty well give it a thought to bring The Emperor\u2019s Riddles to life on screen\". Since its release, The Emperor's Riddles has been likened to the mystery novels of Dan Brown. In an interview with The Times of India, Nayak stated that \"the fact that the book's earning comparisons with Dan Brown is overwhelming\" and \"If Brown has codes, my book has riddles.\" Satyarth's upcoming thriller sees his central protagonist Om Patnaik in the center of a mystery with mythological overtones. ===Sridevi : The Eternal Screen Goddess=== Delhi Launch Satyarth Nayak with Karan Johar In 2019, Satyarth announced his first non-fiction book on India's First Female Superstar Sridevi.

Talking to the media, Satyarth stated that \"I have always been a huge admirer of Sridevi and this book gave me the perfect opportunity to celebrate the journey of India's beloved screen goddess. It was wonderful interacting with various film personalities that she worked with over the years, and put together their memories and stories into a narrative that charts her saga from a child star to India's first female superstar\" while Penguin head endorsed \"Sridevi by Satyarth Nayak is a tribute to the actor and a gift for her fans. I would like to congratulate and thank Satyarth for painstakingly researching and beautifully narrating the life journey of one of India\u2019s most iconic actors.\" The biography was launched by Deepika Padukone in Delhi and Karan Johar in Mumbai.
