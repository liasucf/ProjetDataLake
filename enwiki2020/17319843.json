When Vladimir Petrovi\u0107 became the new Dalian manager he quickly praised Quan and included him as a first team regular within the side that won the league and cup double. On October 5, 2006 Quan was badly wounded in a knife attack by two assailants and was stabbed eight times in the attack. It was discovered that the two assailants were hired by a disgruntled female fan who had a brief relationship with the player, while all three members involved with the attack were sentenced to three years of imprisonment. Despite the severe injuries he received as well as the court case that followed he resumed training in January 2008. Quan would eventually make his long-awaited return on May 3, 2008 against Wuhan Optics Valley F.C. in a league game that ended in a 1-1 draw, however this was later changed to a 3-0 win to Dalian after Wuhan decided to quit the league. On 28 January 2016, Quan transferred to China League One club Nei Mongol Zhongyou.\u6743\u78ca\u6b63\u5f0f\u52a0\u76df\u547c\u548c\u6d69\u7279\u4e2d\u4f18 \u65b0\u8d5b\u5b63\u8eab\u62ab8\u53f7\u6218\u888d at sports.sohu.com 2016-01-28 Retrieved 2016-01-30 ==Honours== Dalian Shide * Chinese Super League: 2005 == References == == External links == * News about Quan Lei at Sina.com *Player stats at sohu.com Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese footballers Category:Footballers from Dalian Category:Dalian Shide F.C. players Category:Qingdao Jonoon F.C. players Category:Inner Mongolia Zhongyou F.C. players Category:Chinese Super League players Category:China League One players Category:Association football midfielders ",
