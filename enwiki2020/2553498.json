He was reappointed as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom by King George VI and oversaw the accession of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 and her coronation. ==History== The Conservative Party returned to power in the United Kingdom after winning the 1951 general election following six years in opposition. This was the first majority Conservative government formed since Stanley Baldwin's 1924\u20131929 ministry. Winston Churchill became Prime Minister for a second time. Churchill's government had several prominent figures and up-and-coming stars. Rab Butler was appointed as Chancellor of the Exchequer while Sir Anthony Eden returned as Foreign Secretary. The noted Scottish lawyer Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, who had gained fame as a prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials, became Home Secretary. He remained in this post until 1954, when he was ennobled as Viscount Kilmuir and appointed Lord Chancellor. Future Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan achieved his first major Cabinet position when he was made Minister of Defence in 1954. Gwilym Lloyd George, younger son of former Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister David Lloyd George, replaced Sir David Maxwell Fyfe as Home Secretary in 1954. Florence Horsbrugh became the first woman to hold a Cabinet post in a Conservative government when she was appointed Minister of Education in 1951. Several figures who were later to achieve high offices held their first governmental posts. These included: future Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath, future Chancellors of the Exchequer Reginald Maudling, Peter Thorneycroft and Iain Macleod and future Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington. Other notable figures in the government were: John Profumo, Bill Deedes, David Ormsby-Gore and the Fifth Marquess of Salisbury. The Churchill ministry was mainly concerned with international affairs, the widening Cold War and decolonialisation (especially the Mau Mau Uprising and the Malayan Emergency). Despite suffering a stroke in 1953, Churchill remained in office until April 1955, when he resigned at the age of eighty. He was succeeded by his ambitious prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and deputy, Sir Anthony Eden, who finally reached the post he had coveted for so long; although his premiership was to last for less than two years. ==1955 cabinet== Wikimedia Commons for a guide to those pictured. * Sir Winston Churchill \u2013 Prime Minister * The Viscount Kilmuir \u2013 Lord Chancellor * The Marquess of Salisbury \u2013 Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords * Harry Crookshank \u2013 Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons * Rab Butler \u2013 Chancellor of the Exchequer * Sir Anthony Eden \u2013 Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs * Gwilym Lloyd George \u2013 Secretary of State for the Home Department and Secretary of State for Welsh Affairs * Derick Heathcoat-Amory \u2013 Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food * Alan Lennox-Boyd \u2013 Secretary of State for the Colonies * The Viscount Swinton \u2013 Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations * Harold Macmillan \u2013 Minister of Defence * Sir David Eccles \u2013 Minister of Education * Duncan Sandys \u2013 Minister of Housing and Local Government * Sir Walter Monckton \u2013 Minister of Labour and National Service * The Earl of Woolton \u2013 Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister of Materials * Osbert Peake \u2013 Minister of Pensions * James Stuart \u2013 Secretary of State for Scotland * Peter Thorneycroft \u2013 President of the Board of Trade * Norman Brook \u2013 Cabinet Secretary ==List of Ministers== Members of the Cabinet are in bold face. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Office!!Name!!Dates!!Notes |- |Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury||Winston Churchill||26 October 1951 \u2013 5 April 1955||Knighted 1953 |- |rowspan=2|Lord Chancellor||The Lord Simonds||30 October 1951|| |- |The Viscount Kilmuir||18 October 1954|| |- |rowspan=2|Lord President of the Council||The Lord Woolton||28 October 1951|| |- |The Marquess of Salisbury||24 November 1952||also Leader of the House of Lords |- |rowspan=2|Lord Privy Seal||The Marquess of Salisbury||28 October 1951||also Leader of the House of Lords |- |Harry Crookshank||7 May 1952||also Leader of the House of Commons |- |Chancellor of the Exchequer||Rab Butler||28 October 1951|| |- |Minister of Economic Affairs||Sir Arthur Salter||31 October 1951||Office abolished 24 November 1952 |- |Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury||Patrick Buchan-Hepburn||30 October 1951|| |- |rowspan=2|Financial Secretary to the Treasury||John Boyd-Carpenter||31 October 1951|| |- |Henry Brooke||28 July 1954|| |- |Economic Secretary to the Treasury||Reginald Maudling||24 November 1952|| |- |rowspan=9|Lords of the Treasury||Harry Mackeson||7 November 1951 \u2013 28 May 1952|| |- |Herbert Butcher||7 November 1951 \u2013 3 July 1953||Knighted |- |Edward Heath||7 November 1951 \u2013 April 1955|| |- |Tam Galbraith||7 November 1951 \u2013 4 June 1954|| |- |Dennis Vosper||7 November 1951 \u2013 4 June 1954|| |- |Hendrie Oakshott||28 May 1952 \u2013 April 1955|| |- |Martin Redmayne||3 July 1953 \u2013 April 1955|| |- |Richard Thompson||28 July 1954 \u2013 April 1955|| |- |Gerard Wills||26 October 1954 \u2013 April 1955|| |- |Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs||Anthony Eden||28 October 1951||Knighted 1954 |- |rowspan=3|Minister of State for Foreign Affairs||Selwyn Lloyd||30 October 1951 \u2013 18 October 1954|| |- |The Marquess of Reading||11 November 1953 \u2013 April 1955|| |- |Anthony Nutting||18 October 1954 \u2013 April 1955|| |- |rowspan=4|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs||The Marquess of Reading||31 October 1951 \u2013 11 November 1953|| |- |Anthony Nutting||31 October 1951 \u2013 18 October 1954|| |- |Douglas Dodds-Parker||11 November 1953 \u2013 18 October 1954|| |- |Robin Turton||18 October 1954 \u2013 April 1955|| |- |rowspan=2|Secretary of State for the Home Department and Welsh Affairs||Sir David Maxwell Fyfe||28 October 1951|| |- |Hon.
