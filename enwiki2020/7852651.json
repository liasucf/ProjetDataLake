    "text": "Anthony Allan Staley (born 15 May 1939) is an Australian politician and businessman. Staley was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne. He was the Member for Chisholm from 1970 to 1980 and was Minister for the Capital Territory from February 1976 to December 1977 in the Fraser Government and then Minister for Post and Telecommunications until his retirement from Parliament. He later served as Federal President of the Liberal Party of Australia. In May 1994 when Liberal Leader John Hewson called a leadership spill, Staley as Liberal President caused controversy when he withdrew his support for Hewson. The controversy was due to the expectation that the organisational wing of the party which Staley was in charge of as president did not interfere with the parliamentary party in selecting the leader. In the subsequent leadership spill Hewson was defeated by Alexander Downer but it was expected that Staley would not have survived as party president if Hewson had won the spill. He did continue on in the position and supported John Howard's bid to become Leader of the Opposition and ultimately Prime Minister. In 1990 he was involved in a serious road accident, which left him needing to use calipers to walk. ==References== ==External links== *Great Scot article *Webster World Encyclopedia of Australia *The Staley Family in Australia Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives for Chisholm Category:Members of the Australian House of Representatives Category:People educated at Scotch College, Melbourne Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Officers of the Order of Australia ",
