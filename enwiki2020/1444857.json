He was a decorated soldier in the army and married a Skrull countess from the planet Zaragz'na and had two children, his beloved son named Sarnogg and a daughter named Jazinda, whom he despised.She-Hulk Vol 2 #33. Marvel Comics. Because of his duty, he was kept away from his family and after the defeats outnumbered his victories, he was banished from Zaragz'na and wasn't allowed to see his son due to his wife. Skrull emperor Dorrek VII devised a way to strike back against the Fantastic Four, who thwarted the Empire's invasion of Earth. Dorrek chose the warrior Kl'rt, who was given the combined abilities of the Fantastic Four. Kl'rt was stronger than the Thing; had superior flight and greater pyrokinetic ability than the Human Torch; had better control of invisibility and force fields than the Invisible Woman, and could stretch further than Mr. Fantastic. The Super- Skrull retained his shapeshifting and hypnotic abilities, and was sent to Earth to defeat the Fantastic Four and pave the way for a new Skrull Empire invasion. During their first encounter, the Super-Skrull keeps the Fantastic Four at bay and forces them to retreat. Mr. Fantastic senses that Kl'rt's powers are augmented by an energy beam from the Skrull homeworld. Blocking the beam with a device placed on him by the Invisible Girl deprives Kl'rt of his new powers. Defeated, he is imprisoned in a crater by the Human Torch when he pursues the Invisible Girl.Fantastic Four #18 (Sep. 1963). Marvel Comics. The Super-Skrull returns as the Invincible Man after the Skrulls restored his powers to fight the Fantastic Four.
