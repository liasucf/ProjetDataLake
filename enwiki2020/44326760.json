    "text": "Vojo Kushi (, August 3, 1918 \u2013 October 10, 1942) was an Albanian and Yugoslav communist guerilla fighter (partisan) and one of the founders of the Communist group based in Shkod\u00ebr, following the Italian occupation of Albania in April 1939. He was proclaimed a National Hero of Yugoslavia by the Yugoslav communist government on February 12, 1945, and then a Hero of Albania by the Albanian communist government in 1946. ==Life== Kushi was born in 1918, in Vrak\u00eb, near Shkod\u00ebr. He belonged to the Serb-Montenegrin (or Yugoslav) minority. His original surname was Ku\u0161i\u0107 (); due to King Zog's state politics following 1920, surnames with obvious Slavic suffixes such as '-i\u0107' and '-vi\u0107' were removed, as were Slavic-speaking schools. The minority was instrumental in the National Liberation. Following the Italian occupation of Albania in April 1939, the first communist revolutionary organization was established in Shkod\u00ebr (Shkod\u00ebr group), which included minority members brothers Vaso and Branko Kadija, Vojo Kushi, Jordan Misja, Ivo Jovanov, Vojin Dragovi\u0107, Petar Bulatovi\u0107 and Vasil Shanto. The Shkod\u00ebr group was led by Shanto and Qemal Stafa. The other organization, established in Kor\u00e7\u00eb (Kor\u00e7\u00eb group), was united into one on November 8, 1941, in Tirana, at the house of Bojko Lazarov, hence forming the Communist Party of Albania. In 1942, he was chosen as a member of the regional committee for Tirana and appointed commander of guerilla units. Enver Hoxha was appointed the Party leader in order to include the majority Muslim population. Kushi was sent by the Albanian government for education at the Military Academy in Belgrade, in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Before his return to Albania, he joined the Yugoslav Partisans and became a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. One of the discussions of Partisans in Prokletije, including Kushi, was included in \u0110urica Labovi\u0107's Lu\u010dono\u0161a sa Prokletija (1985). The Albanian fascist regime sentenced communist fighters to death for treachery and unrest. In Tirana, Qemal Stafa, and later Kushi, Sadik Stavileci and Xoxi Martini were surrounded and killed by carabinieri on 10 October 1942. Their house on the Kodra Kuqe quarter was surrounded and a fight ensued for 6 hours, with tanks forcing them out; Kushi stormed out and killed several carabinieri, then ran out of bullets and jumped onto the tank and was killed. Albanian historiography characterize their fight as \"one of the most heroic fights in the city in 1942\". After the war, he was proclaimed a National Hero. In Albania, many streets, quarters, schools, sport institutions and others were named after him. In Tirana, a monument was erected in his honour. An Albanian documentary about him, Vojo Kushi (1969), was made. In Serbia, a street in Novi Banovci and a football club in Stara Pazova are named after him. Later Hoxha imprisoned Vojo's brother Marko and his family in southern Albania as part of his party purges. ==Annotations== ==References== ==Sources== * ==External links== * * Category:1918 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Albanian communists Category:Albanian people of Montenegrin descent Category:Albanian people of Serb descent Category:Albanian people of Yugoslav descent Category:Heroes of Albania Category:20th-century Albanian people Category:People from Shkod\u00ebr Category:Deaths by firearm in Albania Category:Yugoslav Partisans members Category:Recipients of the Order of the People's Hero Category:Albanian resistance members ",
