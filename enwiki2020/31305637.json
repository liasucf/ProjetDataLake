    "text": "The Holy Spirit as a dove in the Annunciation by Rubens, 1628 The Holy Spirit has been represented in Christian art both in the Eastern and Western Churches using a variety of depictions.Renaissance art: a topical dictionary by Irene Earls 1987 page 70Gardner's art through the ages: the western perspective by Fred S. Kleiner page 349Vladimir Lossky, 1999 The Meaning of Icons page 17 The depictions have ranged from nearly identical figures that represent the three persons of the Holy Trinity from a dove to a flame. The Holy Spirit is often depicted as a dove, based on the account of the Holy Spirit descending like a dove on Jesus at his baptism. In many paintings of the Annunciation, the Holy Spirit is shown in the form of a dove, coming down towards Mary on beams of light, as the Archangel Gabriel announces Christ's coming to Mary. A dove may also be seen at the ear of Saint Gregory the Great\u2500as recorded by his secretary or other church father authors, dictating their works to them. The dove also parallels the one that brought the olive branch to Noah after the deluge, as a symbol of peace.We Believe in the Holy Spirit (Ancient Christian Doctrine, No. 4) by Joel C. Elowsky (Jul 13, 2009) InterVarsity page 14 The book of Acts describes the Holy Spirit descending on the apostles at Pentecost in the form of a wind and tongues of fire resting over the apostles' heads. Based on the imagery in that account, the Holy Spirit is sometimes symbolized by a flame.The Holy Spirit: Classic and Contemporary Readings by Eugene F. Rogers Jr. (May 19, 2009) Wiley pages 121-123 There are also depictions of the Holy Spirit in the book of Genesis.
