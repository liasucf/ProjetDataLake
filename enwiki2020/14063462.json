The bay extends about 6.3 miles (8.5 kilometers) from the southern tip of Diamond Head, the Black Point, also called K\u016bpikipiki\u02bb\u014d , in the west to Portlock Point, also known as Kawaihoa Point to the east. On the land side, just to the east of Diamond Head is the upmarket suburb of K\u0101hala. Following are several affluent hillside suburbs like Hawaii Loa Ridge, a gated community that occupies an entire slope. In the east is the suburb of Hawaii Kai, built by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser after World War II. Hawaii Kai has a marina, shopping centers, including a Costco branch, and numerous restaurants such as the well-known Roy's and an offshoot of the Hawaiian brewery Kona Brewing Co.. On the headland leading to Koko Head is the suburb of Portlock, which belongs to Hawaii Kai. The name Maunalua (from Mauna = mountain and [\u02bbe]lua = two, in the language of the Polynesian natives) refers to the designation of the area around Hawaii Kai in the period of Polynesian settlement. The mountains, located inland from Portlock Point, are the 645 feet (196 meters) high Koko Head, and about 2.2 miles (3.5 kilometers) east thereof, close to Hanauma Bay the Koko Crater, the walls of which rise up to 1,207 feet (368 meters). According to legend, Maunalua was one of the first settlements when the first people of Polynesia settled in Hawai\u02bbi around the 12th century. They originally lived there from fishing and cultivating sweet potatoes. ==Maunalua Bay Beach Park== The beach park was developed by Henry J. Kaiser during the development of Hawaii Kai Marina. Historically, the beach consists of 535,000 square feet (49,703 sq. m) of coral that was dredged and removed, creating a watercraft channel. Kaiser donated it to the City and County of Honolulu in 1960.Maunalua Bay Beach Park, Oahu Public access to the bay is easily made through the city and county beach park off of Kalaniana\u02bbole Highway across from Hawaii Kai Drive.Maunalua Bay Beach Park Oahu Map and Driving Directions Despite the tide height, this bay and reef are always accessible to watercraft, standup paddlers, and snorkelers.
