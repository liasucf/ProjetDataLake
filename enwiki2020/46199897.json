    "text": "The Gemini Guidance Computer (sometimes Gemini Spacecraft On-Board Computer (OBC)) was a digital, serial computer designed for Project Gemini, America's second manned space project. The computer, which facilitated the control of mission maneuvers, was designed by the IBM Federal Systems Division.8\\. J. C. Hundley and R. A. Watson, \"A Digital Computer in Orbital Flight,\" TR 63-825-892, IBM Federal Systems Division, Owego, New York, October 1964. == Functionality == Project Gemini was the first with an on-board computer, as Project Mercury was controlled by computers on Earth. The Gemini Guidance Computer was responsible for the following functions:McDonnell Corporation, NASA Project Gemini Familiarization Manual, 1965, vol. 2, pp. 8.7,8.45. * Ascent \u2013 serves as a backup guidance system. The switchover is manually controlled by the astronauts * Orbital flight \u2013 provides a navigation capability to the astronauts to determine the time of retrofire and to select the landing site for safe reentry in the case of an emergency. (on extended missions ground data may become unavailable when ground data network rotates out of the orbital plane.) * Rendezvous \u2013 serves as primary reference by providing guidance information to the astronauts. The orbit parameters are determined by the ground tracking which are then sent to the spacecraft; the guidance computer was responsible for processing the information along with sensed spacecraft attitude. The information was presented to the astronauts in terms of spacecraft coordinates. * Reentry \u2013 feeds commands directly to the reentry control system for automatic reentry or provides the guidance information to the astronauts for manual reentry. == Specs == * The computer was architecturally similar to the Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer, in particular in the instruction set; however its circuit integration was less advanced.LVDC board reverse engineering project The GGC weighed 58.98 pounds (26.75 kg) and was powered by 28V DC. During a short power outage it could be powered by the Auxiliary Computer Power Unit (ACPU) * 39-bit words memory, each composed of three 13-bit syllables * Ferrite core memory of 4096 wordsComputers in Spaceflight: The NASA Experience, chapter one * Two's complement integer arithmetic * 7.143 kilohertz clock (140 \u03bcs per instruction); all instructions took a single cycle except for multiplication and division == References == == External links == * Gemini Spacecraft On- Board Computer (OBC) * Gemini Program Overview * IBM and the Gemini Program Category:Project Gemini Category:Guidance computers Category:IBM avionics computers Category:Spacecraft navigation instruments ",
