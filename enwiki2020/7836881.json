    "text": "Mora\u2013Siljan Airport is located about 7 km or 3.3 NM southwest of Mora, Sweden. Its fixed-base operator (FBO), AB Dalaflyget, which also operates Dala Airport, consists of the municipalities of Mora, Falun, Borl\u00e4nge and Dalarna County, in Central Sweden. Dalaflyget also provides air traffic control services. The 45 m wide runway and parking can accommodate Boeing 737-type airliners. ==Airlines and destinations== The number of passengers fell dramatically from about 50,000 passengers per year in the 1980s to 7,000 in recent years, following a trend experienced during this period by all Swedish third-level airports. Competition between two domestic airlines, Skyways Express and the defunct European Executive Express, came to an end in 2005, leaving the area without flights to Stockholm and the outside world, requiring a 4-hour drive or train travel. Mora Municipality managed the airport before Dalaflyget was established. From 2016 until 2018 AIS Airlines operated the line to Stockholm. On 28 February 2018, the route to Stockholm Arlanda was canceled, since the Swedish Transport Administration, which procured the Arlanda\u2013Sveg route, did not accept the line being combined with the Arlanda\u2013Mora route. This has been processed in court and also appealed to the EU Commission, which gave the Swedish Transport Administration the right to have their agreements for themselves.Upph\u00f6rande av linjetrafik Mora \u2013 Stockholm Arlanda Dalaflyget 2018-02-01 (in Swedish) Mora Municipality has chosen not to procure its own line because it would mean significantly higher costs. The train is considered a future means of transport, unless the government gives directions to the Swedish Transport Administration to procure the line. The Transport Administration only procured air routes where alternative transport (ground or other airport) to central Stockholm takes over four hours, and the train takes slightly less for Mora. The new S\u00e4len- Trysil Airport which opened in December 2019 has taken over the winter tourist flights.https://www.angelholmhelsingborgairport.se/destinationer/mora/ (this link now promotes S\u00e4len airport, not Mora airport) The last scheduled flights went to and from \u00c4ngelholm in March 2019. ==See also== * List of the largest airports in the Nordic countries ==References== ==External links== *Official site (Swedish) * Category:Airports in Sweden ",
