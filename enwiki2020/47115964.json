    "text": "Living London is a 1904 English documentary film of life in London. It was directed by Charles Urban. The film was released in Australia in 1906 and was a sensation, being seen by over 500,000 people. It was distributed by J and N Tait, and their success with the movie encouraged them to make The Story of the Kelly Gang. The film was thought to have been lost, but ten minutes of footage was discovered in the Corrick Collection in Australia's National Film and Sound Archive in 2007 and restored. The website charlesurban.com, however, claims that the footage is actually from Urban's 1906 documentary The Streets of London. New Zealand writer Ngaio Marsh created a mythic picture in her fiction of England, which she romanticized from seeing Living London.Ngaio Marsh: A Life by Margaret Lewis (1991) pp.38 ==References== ==External links== *Short extract of film from National Film and Sound Archive's YouTube Channel Category:1904 films Category:1900s documentary films Category:Documentary films about London Category:1900s rediscovered films Category:Australian films Category:Australian silent short films Category:British documentary films Category:British films Category:Australian black-and-white films Category:Australian documentary films Category:Rediscovered British films ",
