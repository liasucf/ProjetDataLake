    "text": "KSDA-FM (91.9 FM) is the call sign for the radio station JOY FM broadcast at 91.9 FM from Agana Heights, in the United States territory of Guam. KSDA began as \"Adventist World Radio-Asia\" (AWR-Asia) in 1987 and continues to broadcast on shortwave from Agat, Guam to various countries in Asia. In 1990, AWR launched a local FM station at 91.9 MHz. KSDA-FM first broadcast from AWR's Agat studio, and later from Agana Heights. When AWR shifted its mission away from local broadcasting, KSDA-FM's operation was passed on to the church's Guam-Micronesia Mission in the early 1990s. In 2000, Good News Broadcasting Corporation (GNBC), a non-profit 501-c3 organization composed of members from various Adventist entities on Guam, received KSDA-FM's license from AWR. The FM station was known as JOY 92 until mid-2008, when GNBC secured a construction permit for a transmitter on Saipan. The Saipan transmitter KORU rebroadcasts the Guam station on 89.9 MHz,FCC Records for Construction Permit 172880 necessitating the name change. ==See also== * List of radio stations in Guam * Media ministries of the Seventh-day Adventist Church ==References== ==External links== * Joy FM official website * * SDA SDA Category:Seventh-day Adventist media Category:Radio stations established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in Guam ",
