It was for one of these events that she composed \"Ima Tagidi Li\" (\"Mother, Tell Me\"), which became internationally popular in Jewish girls schools and camps. She also started an after-school choir for English-speaking high school girls. She released her first album of songs in 1999; however, her songs on this and a subsequent album were recorded by male vocalists per the directive of her Rav.
