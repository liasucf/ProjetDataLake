He was able to take advantage of IBM's educational leave-of-absence program to obtain a BS degree from Clarkson and a Ph.D. from HarvardIBM Kingston News, Vol. 5, No. 21, May 25, 1960. In 1957, he filed a patentUS Patent 3016507, \"Thin film magneto resistance device\" 1962-01-09 that is cited as a precursor to the magnetoresistive head used universally in magnetic recording. In 1965, he moved to IBM Research \u2013 Almaden. At IBM, Grant was among the team researching superconductivity in the material Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO) and found it to exhibit superconductivity at temperatures as high as 90 K. This was some of first evidence that superconductivity could be supported at temperatures above the boiling point of Nitrogen, a common cryogenic refrigerant. In 1987-88, with guidance from Grant, his 8th-grade daughter, Heidi, and then subsequently a science class at Gilroy High School were able to show the relative ease with which high temperature superconductors could be fabricated and demonstratedM.

From 1993 to 2004, Grant was a Science Fellow with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). From 2005 to 2008, he was a Visiting Scholar in Applied Physics at Stanford University In 2004, he started his own consulting business.

The dispute was between IBM\u2019s Almaden Research Center, the US Naval Research Laboratory, the University of Houston, and Bell Labs. Ultimately, Bell Labs. prevailed and was granted the US patent based on priority date (date of invention rather than the current criterion of date of filing)Tony Feder, \"Bell Labs Wins Long-Running Patent Battle over High-Tc Superconductor\", Physics Today 53, 4, 56 (2000)C. Macilwain, \"Bell Labs win superconductivity patent\", Nature, vol. 403, pp. 121\u2013122, 13 Jan, 2000 ==Recognition and awards == Grant became a Senior Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1998 \"For contributions to the fields of organic conductors and high temperature superconductivity\"APS Fellow Archive. He became a Fellow of the Institute of Physics, United Kingdom, in Nov 2004. In 2013, Grant was chosen as American Physical Society Distinguished Lecturer on the Applications of PhysicsAPS Newsletter Fall 2013 \"Paul Grant chosen as the 2014 Distinguished Lecturer\".
