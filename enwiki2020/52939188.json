Television Anchors is a series showing television news reporters in incongruous situations. It was prompted by the sudden cancellation of an assignment to photograph New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina: although Canal Street had escaped most of the damage, it was the standard television backdrop thanks to its ease of access. Allowing more into the frame around the reporter than normally permitted by a television news broadcast presents a very different picture.Jordan G. Teicher, \"Truth and fiction in television news\", Slate, 29 April 2013. Accessed 4 February 2017. In the series Nothing Special, begun around 2000, Kollar explored the environment of countries that had been in the Warsaw bloc. He traveled nearly 13,500 km, \"looking for moments that portrayed the chaotic and often humorous moments\"; examining \"clashing cultures, tradition versus modernity, and sometimes situations that are simply perplexing\". The photographs were all unstaged.David Rosenberg, \"The wacky world of eastern Europe in the early 2000s\", Slate, 30 March 2014. Accessed 4 February 2017.
