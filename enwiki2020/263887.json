Like many southern ducks, the sexes are similar. It is very pale and mainly grey, with a browner back and pink on the bill (young birds lack the pink). The Cape teal cannot be confused with any other duck in its range. It is a thinly distributed but widespread duck, rarely seen in large groups except the moulting flocks, which may number up to 2000. This species feeds on aquatic plants and small creatures (invertebrates, crustaceans and amphibians)Hockey, P.A.R., Dean, W.R.J., Ryan, P.G. (Eds). 2005.
