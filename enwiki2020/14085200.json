    "text": "Robbery, ... Style (, translit. Ograblenie po...) is a 1978 Soviet parody animated film by Yefim Gamburg. It is split into four parts: Robbery, American Style; Robbery, French Style; Robbery, Italian Style, and the last, though untitled, clearly refers to the USSR. Each segment is a parody of 1960-1970s crime films in the corresponding countries. ==Plot== The opening frames include a parody of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer logo, with Cheburashka replacing the MGM lion. The American part parodies Hollywood action films with exaggerated explosions, car chases, striptease, violent deaths and a cold- blooded corrupt sheriff character based on Marlon Brando. The French segment parodies film noir, mostly Action Man and Any Number Can Win with Jean Gabin. The Italian episode parodies colorful Italian films, in particular Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow and Divorce Italian Style with Marcello Mastroianni, as well as Treasure of San Gennaro. In the final 2-minute Soviet part two robbers (drawn after Saveli Kramarov and Stanislav Chekan) are trying to rob a savings bank, but it is always closed for cleanup or repairs. A militsioner at the end parodies Mikhail Zharov's Aniskin character. After Kramarov immigrated to the US, the segment was cut from the film and restored only in 1988.Dina Goder.
