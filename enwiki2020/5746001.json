He appeared in nearly 400 films. ==Career== Conklin was born in San Francisco, California. In vaudeville, Conklin headlined shows on the Keith and Orpheum circuits. One of the original Keystone Kops, Conklin wore makeup of heavy eyebrow lining and a thin, upside-down, painted-on variation of Kaiser Wilhelm's mustache. Conklin on left in No Mother to Guide Him In areas where anti-German sentiments still ran high during the post-World War I era, Conklin was billed as Charlie Lynn. One of Conklin's first talking pictures was All Quiet on the Western Front as a hospital patient. For the rest of his career in talking pictures, he had small roles in 2-reelers which starred The Three Stooges, Andy Clyde, Hugh Herbert and Harry Langdon. Conklin's last billed movie was Abbott and Costello meet the Keystone Kops. Conklin's period at Keystone was contemporary with that of Chester Conklin, a more popular Keystone comedian who occasionally played lead roles in Keystone short films. The two Conklins were not related. ==Death== Conklin died in Hollywood, California, on July 30, 1959, 15 days after his 73rd birthday. ==Partial filmography== *A Submarine Pirate (1915) (film debut) *Yankee Doodle in Berlin (1919) - Prussian Guard Drill Leader *Salome vs. Shenandoah (1919) - Actor Playing Captain of Artillery/Roman Slave *A Small Town Idol (1921) - Jester in Movie (uncredited) *Beau Brummel (1924) - Bit Role (uncredited) *The Fire Patrol (1924) - Fireman (uncredited) *Find Your Man (1924) - Lumberjack *The Cyclone Rider (1924) - Remus *Troubles of a Bride (1924) - Jeff *A Fool and His Money (1925) - Citizen *The Gold Rush (1925) - Prospector (uncredited) *Below the Line (1925) - Deputy Sheriff *Red Hot Tires (1925) - Coachman *Seven Sinners (1925) - 'Scarlet Fever' Sanders *The Clash of the Wolves (1925) - Alkali Bill *Hogan's Alley (1925) - The Stranger's Friend *The Fighting Edge (1926) - Chuck *The Night Cry (1926) - Tony *The Sap (1926) - Wienie Duke *Hard Boiled (1926) - Bill Grimes *Fig Leaves (1926) - Eddie McSwiggen *Whispering Wires (1926) - Jasper, the Butler *Beware of Widows (1927) - Captain *Silk Stockings (1927) - Watchman *The Girl in the Pullman (1927) - Old Black Joe *Ham and Eggs at the Front (1927) - Eggs *The Circus (1928) *All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) *Soup to Nuts (1930) Fireman playing checkers (with Ted Healy and his stooges) *Just Imagine (1930) *A Connecticut Yankee (1931) *Iron Man (1931) *The Passionate Plumber (1932) *The Wet Parade (1932) *What Price Hollywood?
