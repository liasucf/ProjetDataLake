He graduated from Yale College in 1826. He began the study of law in the Litchfield Law School, and completed his preparation for admission to the bar in the office of the Hon. Samuel Hubbard, of Boston, Mass. In 1830 he began the practice of law in that city, and though owing to some bodily infirmities he seldom appeared in the court room, was much employed as a chamber counsellor, and much trusted in drafting important papers. He was for many years a member of the city school committee, and repeatedly elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He died in Boston, June 18, 1875, after an illness of some four months, occasioned by a cancer of the throat. He was never married. ==External links== * Litchfield Ledger Category:1802 births Category:1875 deaths Category:People from Princeton, Massachusetts Category:Yale College alumni Category:Litchfield Law School alumni Category:Massachusetts lawyers Category:Members of the Massachusetts House of Representatives Category:19th-century American politicians ",
