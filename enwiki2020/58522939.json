    "text": "At the Algonquin is a 2012 live jazz album by Dave Frishberg and Jessica Molaskey, featuring songs written by Frishberg. It was recorded from a March 2011 show at the historic Algonquin Hotel's Oak Room. It was the last recorded performance at the venue before it closed in early 2012 after thirty-two years. Molaskey made her debut at the venue in 2005. == Reception == All About Jazz lists it as a recommended album. AllMusic critic Ken Dryden rated the album four stars, commenting \"Frishberg and Molaskey make quite a team, with a playful attitude and rapport that makes it seem like they've been a team for years\" Christopher Louden of the JazzTimes lamented the loss of the venue, but said of the artists that \"Jessica Molaskey is best known for swapping quips with husband John Pizzarelli, pianist and vocalist Dave Frishberg has been her frequent sparring partner over the years, and their silk-and-sandpaper rapport is every bit as engaging.\" Stephen Holden reviewed the original performance and source material for the New York Times, writing \"the level of craftsmanship in Mr. Frishberg\u2019s songs is equaled only by that of Stephen Sondheim. Every phrase is chiseled, each word sealed into place, the better to allow that \"little voice that whispers crystal clear\u201d to have its say.\" Of Molaskey's performance, \"[she's] as sympathetic an interpreter of his work as Blossom Dearie, with whom he used to perform.\" == Track listing == == Personnel == === Musicians === * Dave Frishbergcomposer, piano, primary artist, producer, vocals * Jessica Molaskeyprimary artist, producer, vocals === Support === * Dave Frishbergliner notes * Luke Meltoncover design * Bill Mossengineer, mastering, mixing == References == Category:Jessica Molaskey albums Category:2012 live albums Category:Live vocal jazz albums ",
