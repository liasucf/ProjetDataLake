    "text": "\"Turn It Up\" is a song by English recording artist Pixie Lott from her debut album of the same name. Written by Lott, Ruth-Anne Cunningham, Jonas Jeberg and Mich Hansen, the track was released as the album's fifth single on 7 June 2010. The song was given a new remix for the single version, adding echo effects and a \"brasher\" overdub. Lott performed the song on the third semi- final of the fourth series of Britain's Got Talent on 2 June 2010. ==Critical reception== Nick Levine of Digital Spy wrote: \"While Danish duo Cutfather & Joe supply a suitably synthy pop-R&B; backdrop\u2014complete with singalong chorus\u2014Lott gets down to the nitty-gritty of splitting up. 'I know you can't stay, so I won't be waiting, anticipating for the fall,' she sings, before trotting out that old chestnut about time being a healer. It's a terribly mature approach from one so young, but what else would you expect from a 19-year-old who already has a platinum album, a fashion line and a US film role to her name?\" Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Chart Blog called the song \"a perfectly good album track, notable only because at no point in the presentation does Pixie stop singing\", but commented that \"as a fifth single from an already-successful breakthrough album, it's pointless, and worse, might even allow chart-statisticians such as myself the chance to put together a compelling argument that she's failing, when she could be off recording some new, different, amazing songs and preparing to kill us all with brilliance.\" ==Music video== The music video was shot in Los Angeles in mid-April 2010, and premiered on 6 May 2010. The video is literal of the song's lyrics; it features Lott walking the back streets of Los Angeles whilst singing, before cutting to several different scenes on rooftops of Lott singing and dancing during sunrise and sunset. The theme of the song is how two lovers are trying to hold their relationship together, but it just isn't working. After the frustration of it, they decide to end the drama and break up, wishing the best to one another and keeping good memories of their times together. ==Live performances== Lott promoted the song in several live performances, such as on the Main Stage of the Radio 1's Big Weekend in Bangor, Wales on 23 May 2010, the third semi-final of the fourth series of Britain's Got Talent on 2 June 2010, T4's Hollyoaks Music Show on 12 June 2010, the T4 on the Beach concert in Weston-super-Mare on 4 July 2010 and the Children in Need 2010 charity concert on 19 November 2010. ==Track listing== *UK iTunes remix single #\"Turn It Up\" (Digital Dog Radio Edit) \u2013 2:59 #\"Turn It Up\" (Dee-Lux Club Remix Edit) \u2013 2:56 ==Personnel== *Pixie Lott \u2013 vocals *Tom Coyne \u2013 mastering *Cutfather \u2013 producer, percussion *Jonas Jeberg \u2013 producer, instrumentation *Carlos Oyanedel \u2013 additional mixing *Phil Tan \u2013 mixing ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2010) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (2010) !Position |- |UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |style=\"text- align:center;\"|147 |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2009 songs Category:2010 singles Category:Mercury Records singles Category:Pixie Lott songs Category:Songs written by Cutfather Category:Songs written by Jonas Jeberg Category:Songs written by Ruth-Anne Cunningham Category:Songs written by Pixie Lott Category:Song recordings produced by Cutfather ",
