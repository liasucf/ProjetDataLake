    "text": "IXLeeds is a Leeds-based internet exchange point (IXP) founded in 2008. It is the UK's only fully independent exchange outside London, and has 20 members. The exchange was founded as a neutral not-for-profit by a group of telecommunications and internet service provider (ISP) professionals including Professor Adam Beaumont, founder and CEO of telecoms operator aql. Beaumont created the first carrier-neutral data centre in Leeds which allowed multiple operators to interconnect and facilitated the existence of the exchange. aql has provided free space and power for the exchange since its inception. IXLeeds promotes cooperation between operators in the region to help improve digital infrastructure and support a solid internet exchange fabric. It is located in one of aql's data centres in the historic Salem Chapel in Leeds. == See also == * List of internet exchange points == References == == External links == * IXLeeds.net Category:Internet exchange points in the United Kingdom Category:Science and technology in West Yorkshire Category:Telecommunications in the United Kingdom ",
