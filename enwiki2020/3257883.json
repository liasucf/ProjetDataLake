The main falls had a height of approximately and about twelve smaller waterfalls are situated behind and to the sides of Kegon Falls, leaking through the many cracks between the mountain and the lava flows. In the autumn, the traffic on the road from Nikko to Ch\u016bzenji can sometimes slow to a crawl as visitors come to see the fall colors. In 1927, the Kegon Falls was recognized as one of the \"Eight Views\" which best showed Japan and its culture in the Sh\u014dwa period.\u65e5\u672c\u516b\u666f(\u662d\u548c2\u5e74)\u306e\u9078\u5b9a\u5185\u5bb9.
