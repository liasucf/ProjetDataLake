    "text": "General elections were held in Greenland on 2 June 2009. Prime Minister Hans Enoksen announced the election date on 15 April 2009, stating that he would prefer for a newly elected parliament to administer Greenland when the self- government reform took effect on 21 June 2009.Simonsen, Mariia (15 April 2009) Landstingsvalg 2. juni 2009 . Sermitsiaq. The reform gave more power to the Greenlandic parliament with decisions on most issues being devolved to the parliament but defence and foreign affairs remaining under the control of Denmark. ==Results== The pro-independence, left-wing opposition party, Inuit Ataqatigiit led by Kuupik Kleist emerged as the largest party with 43.7% of the vote. Kleist set a new record for most votes in a Greenlandic election with 5,461 received. This compares with Akitsinnguaq Olsen who was elected with just 112 votes. The governing Siumut led by Prime Minister Hans Enoksen received 26.5% of the vote and lost control of the government for the first time in 30 years. Former Siumut leader and Prime Minister Jonathan Motzfeldt failed to be re-elected for the first time since 1971, receiving just 91 votes . Enoksen stated that he would step down as party leader, a position he had held since 2002, if his colleagues wished him to. Siumut was believed to have lost votes over a series of scandals, including one over expenses, and concerns over its ability to manage with greater autonomy. The newly formed Sorlaat Partiiat gained just 383 votes in the election and dissolved shortly afterwards. The party stood on a platform of huge spending reductions and opposed Greenland rejoining the EU. ==Aftermath== Siumut was considered likely to be left out of government as both the Inuit Ataqatigiit and Demokraatit parties ruled out the possibility of working with them. Siumut's former coalition partner, Atassut, gained too few seats to make a new coalition powerful enough to challenge for the government. On 7 June 2009, Inuit Ataqatigiit announced that it would form a coalition with the Democrats and the Association of Candidates.http://www.nasdaq.com/aspx/stock-market-news- story.aspx?storyid=200906072019dowjonesdjonline000390&title;=greenland- parties-agree-on-government-coalition ==References== Greenland Category:Elections in Greenland Category:2009 in Greenland Category:June 2009 events in North America ",
