    "text": "In the Shadows is the third full-length studio album by Danish heavy metal band Mercyful Fate. It is the first offering of the band since their reunion in 1992. The album was released in 1993 via Metal Blade Records. Unlike previous Mercyful Fate albums, which were entirely centered around lyrical themes of Satanism and the occult, the lyrics on this album are rather focused on more conceptual horror-themes, akin to King Diamond's work with his eponymous band. The band would not return to a primarily occult/Satanic lyrical approach until the band's latest album, 9, released in 1999. Some editions of In the Shadows contain a bonus track, \"Return of the Vampire... 1993\", that is a re-recording of the song \"Return of the Vampire\", present in the homonymous 1992 compilation album, featuring Lars Ulrich of Metallica on drums. The album cover was painted by Torbjorn Jorgensen / Studio Dzyan. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Mercyful Fate *King Diamond - vocals, producer, mixing *Hank Shermann - guitars, producer *Michael Denner - guitars *Timi Hansen - bass guitar *Snowy Shaw - drums (credited) Additional musicians *Morten Nielsen - drums *John Marshall - harpsichord on track 9 *Lars Ulrich - drums on \"Return of the Vampire... 1993\" Production *Tim Kimsey - producer, engineer, mixing *Sterling Winfield - assistant engineer *David Rosenblad, Thom Caccetta - digital editing *Eddy Schreyer - mastering at Future Disc, Los Angeles *Brian Slagel - executive producer *Torbjorn Jorgensen / Studio Dzyan - cover art *Thomas Grondahl - photography ==References== Category:Mercyful Fate albums Category:1993 albums Category:Metal Blade Records albums ",
