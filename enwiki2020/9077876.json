It comprises the neighborhoods of Vila de Gr\u00e0cia, Vallcarca i els Penitents, El Coll, La Salut and Camp d'en Grassot i Gr\u00e0cia Nova. Gr\u00e0cia is bordered by the districts of Eixample to the south, Sarri\u00e0- Sant Gervasi to the west and Horta-Guinard\u00f3 to the east. A vibrant and diverse enclave of Catalan life, Gr\u00e0cia was an independent municipality for centuries before being formally annexed by Barcelona in 1897 as a part of the city's expansion. == Neighbourhoods == The district of Gr\u00e0cia comprises five neighbourhoods: {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Code !Name of the neighborhood !Population (2009) !Area (ha) !Density (inhabitants/ha) |- |28 |Vallcarca i els Penitents |15 687 |120,9 |129,8 |- |29 |El Coll |7 299 |35,8 |203,9 |- |30 |La Salut |13 332 |64,4 |207,2 |- |31 |Vila de Gr\u00e0cia |52 801 |132,6 |398,2 |- |32 |Camp d'en Grassot i Gr\u00e0cia Nova |34 838 |65,0 |536,4 |- ! !Gr\u00e0cia !123 957 !418,6 !296,2 |} ==History== Gr\u00e0cia was established in 1626, by a Novitiate of Carmelites, who established a convent there, called \"Nostra Senyora de Gr\u00e0cia (Our Lady of Grace)\". Following the War of the Spanish Succession, Gr\u00e0cia remained an independent municipality in the direction of the Serra de Collserola mountains (north/northwest) from central Barcelona. Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, the street which is today home to the most high-end international fashion brands and posh hotels (Barcelona's version of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es), was back then a country road linking the town to the larger city, through the plain of Barcelona. During the mid-1800s, Barcelona was rapidly industrialising and significantly expanding its borders from those of the Roman walls and old city. The advent of new industry was drawing Catalans by the thousands to abandon their farms and move to the city, spurring a shift from an agriculturally based, rural economy to an urban economy focused on manufacturing and trade. Between 1801 and 1850 alone, the population of Barcelona grew by over fifty percent, from 115,000 to roughly 187,000 citizens. However, industrial expansion brought problems with it. Packed living quarters, densely lined streets, and poor public infrastructure all contributed to the spreading of disease and uncleanliness that plagued the city's poorer masses. Life expectancy plummeted to 23 years old for the poor and 36 years for the rich. The sewage system was overwhelmed with the mass of people sharing cramped streets, and the poorly designed streets offered little in terms of fresh air or ventilation. The Junta de Derribo in the 1840s was a famous, published account of the conditions. Modern map of the districts of Barcelona; Gr\u00e0cia can be seen in red. In 1854, the government of Barcelona recognised the need for an answer to the swelling population issues, and began investigating the construction of what would become the Eixample district. Situated between the old city of neighbourhoods like El Raval, Ciutat Vella, and El Born, and the outlying municipalities of Gr\u00e0cia, Sant Mart\u00ed, Sants, and Montju\u00efc, the Eixample (alternatively known as L\u2019Eixample or Ensanche, in Catalan) underwent a number of iterations in the planning stages. In 1855, the Ministry of Development, under the authority of the federal government in Spain at the time, commissioned Ildefons Cerd\u00e0, a Catalan urban planner, to design the new district. However, when the local government changed political sides, Cerd\u00e0's plan was discarded and as the new government held a project competition which Cerd\u00e0 lost. The winning plan, supported by the local city council, was that of Antoni Rovira i Trias, another Catalan urban planner who played a central role in demolition of the 18th-century military installation, Ciutadella, that helped open Barcelona to the developments of the new century. Despite the contest, Cerd\u00e0's plan (which was heavily criticised at the time by his contemporaries as being overtly socialist) weathered the controversy and became the basis of the Eixample district, as it retained the support of the central Spanish government. Over the next forty years, as the plan took hold and the city began to sprawl, the Eixample rapidly pushed Barcelona's borders closer and closer to the long-independent municipality of Gr\u00e0cia. In 1897, Barcelona formally annexed the town of Gr\u00e0cia, and it has existed since as a neighborhood of the Catalan capital. Although no longer independent, Gr\u00e0cia has long maintained a distinct identity as a unique district of the diverse, larger metropolis to which it belongs. ==Life in Gr\u00e0cia== Today home to over 120,000 people, according to the Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica, Gr\u00e0cia is both the smallest district by area, at 4.2 km2, and the second most densely populated neighbourhood in Barcelona. One of the hippest, most cosmopolitan areas in the city, Gr\u00e0cia's intimate, close-packed streets and predominately low-rise, Mediterranean architecture give it a distinct feel. Its old, one-way streets are organized around a series of plazas, including Pla\u00e7a de Vila de Gr\u00e0cia, Pla\u00e7a del Sol and Pla\u00e7a de la Virreina. \u201cOld-world charm\u201d abounds. The Gr\u00e0cia population is an mix of young professionals and artists and a growing elderly population, with a significant portion of older Catalans who came of age as Franco came to power. Catalan flags adorn many a Gr\u00e0cia window or terrace, symbols of the neighbourhood's fiercely pro-independence politics. Compared to the other classic Barcelona neighbourhoods, Ciutat Vella and the rest of the old city, Gr\u00e0cia is relatively void of major tourist attractions. In this bohemian enclave of Catalan urban life there aren't many international brands or fast-food chains. instead, small gourmet street food outposts are common; there are an array of ethnic cuisines, from Japanese to Greek. Ubiquitous as well are the bountiful small cafes serve classic Spanish tapas and Catalan specialties. Shopping abounds in funky mum'n\u2019dad shops selling stylish trinkets and vintage clothing. Talented artisans and artists can be found in the squares and in small ground floor shops. Travellers say that Gracia good for shopping (e.g. on Carrer de Verdi) and the true local experience - city's atmosphere on its quiet placas and Catalan cuisine.Gracia in Barcelona - Maybe the Best neighborhood to Stay Alexander Pavel Z., Travel eGuide Retrieved Jan 2019 Nightlife in Gr\u00e0cia is dominated by Spanish caf\u00e9 culture, with an abundance of small bars and restaurants that host late-night revelry and long conversations. At the weekends, one might hear any number of local live music acts, from a single guitarist to a four-piece band. As for clubs, Otto Zutz is a famous hotspot at the Western end of Gr\u00e0cia. For transportation, Gr\u00e0cia is served by the L3 (Green) and L4 (Yellow) lines of the Barcelona metro, with stops at Penitents, Vallcarca, Lesseps, and Fontana on the L3, and Joanic and Verdaguer on the L4. The Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) also operate the Gr\u00e0cia station of the Barcelona - Metro de Vall\u00e8s line. Additionally, numerous bus and night bus lines in the TMB Barcelona system cover Gr\u00e0cia. As with the rest of the city, bikes are very common. == Artistic influences == The neighbourhood of Gr\u00e0cia is both culturally and artistically distinct from the rest of the city of Barcelona. The neighbourhood was considered a separate municipality until its annexation in 1897, and its unique culture has persisted, rendering it a completely self-sufficient area of Barcelona. Although its eclectic charm attracts travellers from all over, unlike much of Barcelona, the majority of Gr\u00e0cia's inhabitants are locals. During the day, the \u201chipster\u201d barrio is full of life, projecting a hip and edgy vibe. At night, however, the environment transforms, and although the narrow streets are quiet and peaceful, bars often host talented jazz singers, and groups of teenagers gather in the squares. Several historic sites in Gr\u00e0cia enhance its eclectic charm. For instance, Casa Vicens, designed by Antoni Gaud\u00ed, the famous Catalan modernist architect, is one of the neighborhood's main attractions. In 1883 construction was put into effect with a blueprint consisting of ground-floor buildings and a garden. Later, Gaud\u00ed approved an extension consisting of stairs and a patio, and Casa Vicens has been restored on multiple occasions in order to preserve Gaud\u00ed's vision. Central to Gaud\u00ed's design philosophy was his belief that every aspect of his designs are equal in importance. The smoking room door displays this attention to detail, with many intricate coloured glass pieces that illuminate at night. Gaud\u00ed also took into account minor details such as the stairs leading to areas of the roof rarely inhabited. That the design aspects often seem unrelated makes for an aesthetically interesting work of art. Eusebi G\u00fcell, a close friend of Gaud\u00ed, commissioned him to bring into fruition the majestic Park G\u00fcell. G\u00fcell selected the beautiful area of Muntanya Pelada, where he envisioned a park modeled after the residential parks of England, with the spectacular view of the sea on display for its residents. Already blooming were carob and olive trees, and based on the weather conditions, Guad\u00ed's design included Mediterranean plants that would not require considerable water to thrive. He also devised a fully functional irrigation system to provide the community with water resources. Not only did G\u00fcell occupy an old mansion on the estate, but Gaud\u00ed himself resided in a home there with several family members. Graffiti near Lesseps Metro in Gr\u00e0cia By 1914 only these two houses had been built, forcing Gaud\u00ed to abandon his plans for some sixty houses. Nevertheless, the estate was converted into a private garden, and In 1963, Gaudi's house was made accessible to the public with its grand opening as the \u201cGaud\u00ed House Museum.\u201d In 1969, Park G\u00fcell was declared a \u201cpatrimonio del mundo\u201d, or World Heritage Site, by UNESCO. Graffiti tours have become a main tourist attraction in Barcelona, and Gr\u00e0cia is home to some of the most intriguing pieces, adorning its serene streets with vibrant colours. For instance, Ozzy's art, appearing in many parts of Barcelona, is marked by bright poster designs, while the artist C215 produces detailed stencilled works. ==Tradition== A typical street display during the Festa Major in Gr\u00e0cia An ornante creature at the Festes de Gr\u00e0cia The most notable event in Gr\u00e0cia is the Festes de Gr\u00e0cia, which goes on for eight days every August. The largest neighbourhood festival in Barcelona, the Festa Major de Gr\u00e0cia began in 1817 as a celebration of the neighbourhood itself (at the time still an independent town). Gr\u00e0cia's residents compete for the crown of best street or square, selecting distinct themes and extensively decorating in Spanish carnival style, and organised by a number of local associations. The selected themes range from scenes of nature, to wild animals and creatures, to characters from popular culture. The Catalan practice of castellers, dating back to the 18th century, is also enacted. The inhabitants of Valls, a tiny town located on the outskirts of Barcelona, initiated this tradition of human towers, which became a competitive sport. The original structure was accompanied by a traditional folklore dance, and although the flute still accompanies the performance to this day, the dance became a separate spectacle by the 19th century. The modern Catalan castell is similar to its original design: the pinya is a large ring at the bottom of the structure that supports the human weight, and each level consists of a specific number of people. The tronc, meaning \"trunk\" in Catalan, is composed of several levels, and only children are permitted to make up the top level due to their lighter weight. The \"anxeta\", the smallest child who holds the position at the top of the tower, is the last to climb the structure, and only remains there for several seconds, saluting the crowd below. Most often, around nine people form a single castell made up of up to seven or eight rows, and each structure has its own name. At night booths sell alcoholic beverages and an abundance of live musical acts of many genres are present. 1.5 million people are rumored to attend each August over the week, although this figure is not verified. ==Landmarks== To the northern (mountain) end of Gr\u00e0cia on El Carmel mountain (and technically outside its borders depending on who is asked) lies Park G\u00fcell, arguably the most famous work of Catalonia's most famous architect, Antoni Gaud\u00ed. On \"Carrer de les Carolines\", between Pla\u00e7a Lesseps and Fontana, lies Casa Vicens, Gaud\u00ed's first major work of architecture and a staple in his canon of modernist design. An occupied house for decades, Casa Vicens only recently became a tourist attraction on November 15, 2017. The building was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.Parc G\u00fcellCasa Fuster, a fabled, grand modernist-style hotel that lies at the edge of Gr\u00e0cia's southern (water) end on the Pla\u00e7a de Nicol\u00e1s Salmer\u00f3n. Designed by Catalan master architect Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner between 1908 and 1910, the ornate house was converted to a hotel in 2004. In the Pla\u00e7a de la Vila de Gr\u00e0cia, the bell tower marks the old administrative centre of the former independent municipality. The tower, a 33-meter-high octagonal figure, was built by Rovira i Trias between 1862 and 1864. A legend describes the \u201cCampana de Gr\u00e0cia\u201d and its role in local conflicts from 1870. Gr\u00e0cia was the original home to the Teatre Lliure, one of Spain's most prestigious theatres (the theatre has since relocated to Montju\u00efc). Additionally, the Cinema Verdi is a popular cinema in Barcelona, showing both local and foreign (Western) films in their original languages. Biblioteca Jaume Fuster In Pla\u00e7a Lesseps, named after French diplomat and entrepreneur Ferdinand de Lesseps who developed the Suez Canal, the Biblioteca Jaume Fuster is an attractive, modern addition to the neighbourhood. \"Designed by architect Josep Llin\u00e0s i Carmona, it is one of the largest and most modern\" libraries in Barcelona. It opened in 2005. ==Gr\u00e0cia in fiction== Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda's most important novel, The Time of the Doves (La pla\u00e7a del diamant), is set mainly in Gr\u00e0cia at the time of the Second Spanish Republic and the Spanish Civil War. The eponymous protagonist of the short story Mar\u00eda dos Prazeres by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez lives in an apartment in the neighbourhood of Gr\u00e0cia in the years of Francoist Spain. ==See also== * List of streets and squares in Gr\u00e0cia * Districts of Barcelona ==References== ==External links== * Gr\u00e1ciaNet * The history of Gr\u00e1cia English written site about Barcelona. * Official Barcelona District Site * Festa Major de Gr\u00e0cia * bcn.travel/Gr\u00e1cia English Barcelona district profile by bcn.travel.
