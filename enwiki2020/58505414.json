It was gathered in 1648 to support the establishment of the city of Malden. It is one of the oldest churches in Massachusetts.(accessed 2018-09-16) The current minister is the Rev. Otto O'Connor, who was called to be the congregation's minister in 2017. Rev. O'Connor is the first openly transgender minister in the history of First Parish, and one of the first in any religious denomination in the Boston area. . ==History== ===Establishment of the Parish=== The first colonists living in what was then called \"Mystic Side\" attended the church in Charlestown, which forced the settlers to make a long journey, including taking a ferry. At the time, only church members were freemen and constituents of the body politic. As the ability to vote was tied to membership in the church, the residents of Mystic Side were eager to establish their own church; and gathered themselves in 1648, despite not having the permission from the General Court to assemble. Corey, Deloraine. 1898. History of Malden. In 1650 the Parish ordained its first regular minister, Marmaduke Matthews. Matthews had been preaching in Hull, Massachusetts but had lost the favor of the freemen there, and thus his ordination in Malden was opposed by the other churches and by the magistrates of the General Court. Matthews was ordained while the General Court sought to hold public inquiry into his \"erroneous expressions, others weak, unconvenient and unsafe expressions\" in his preaching. As a result of this conflict with neighboring churches, the historical record suggests that Matthews was lay- ordained, instead of ordained by the elder Charlestown congregation as was customary. The second ordained minister to preach in Malden was Michael Wigglesworth, a preacher and poet who was renknowned for his scriptural poem The Day of Doom. ==Recent Years== The congregation unanimously called the Rev. Otto O'Connor as its settled minister in 2017, making him the 36th settled minister. In line with other member congregations of the UUA, the congregation adheres to the Unitarian Universalist faith and affirms the Seven Principles of Unitarian Universalism. == References == ==Further reading== *Edward Sealy, A Short History of the First Parish in Malden. ==External links== *First Parish in Malden Website Category:Unitarian Universalist churches in Massachusetts Category:Churches completed in 1909 Category:Churches in Middlesex County, Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Malden, Massachusetts Category:Stone churches in Massachusetts ",
