This small midrash, \"the heroic legend of the sons of Jacob,\" is based on Genesis 35:5 and 36:6, and recounts the story of the wars of Jacob and his sons against the kings of the Amorites and against Esau and his army. The beginning of its discussion of the Amorite war is as follows: \"Our teachers said that although they did not pursue after them this time, yet seven years later all the kings of the Amorites gathered themselves together against the sons of Jacob.\" That the legends contained in Vayisau are very old may be inferred from the Book of JubileesJubilees 34, 37 et seq. and from the Testament of Judah;Emil Kautzsch, Apokryphen, ii. 97 et seq., 102 et seq., 471 et seq. the midrash betrays its relationship to these old pseudepigraphical writings in many details. The war against the Amorites is treated at greater length in the Sefer ha-Yashar, pericope \"Beshallach.\" The midrash itself is contained in Yalkut Shimoni,Yalkut Shimoni, Genesis 133 and is mentioned by Na\u1e25manides as \"Sefer Milchamot Benei Ya'akov\".Nachmanides' commentary to Genesis 34:13 cite the opinion of G. Schmitt that the work was composed not later than the Bar Kokhba war. The text has been edited according to the Yalkut Shimoni by A. Jellinek,B. H. iii. 1-5 by S. Chones,In his edition of Rab Pe'alim, pp. 153 et seq. and by Charles.In his edition of the Book of Jubilees, Appendix II., Oxford, 1895 == References == .The JE cites the following works: **Zunz, G.
