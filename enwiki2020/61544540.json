The tour consisted of three Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs) and six Women's Twenty20 International (WT20) matches. The WODI matches were not part of the 2017\u201320 ICC Women's Championship. Ahead of the tour, India's Mithali Raj retired from WT20I cricket, to focus on the 50-over format on the run-up to the 2021 Women's Cricket World Cup. South Africa's captain, Dane van Niekerk, missed the series due to injury, with Sun\u00e9 Luus leading the team in her absence. India had initially won the WT20I series, after a win in the fourth match gave them an unassailable lead. India had also won the first match, with the next two fixtures abandoned due to rain. However, on 2 October 2019, an extra WT20I match was added to the schedule. India won the fifth WT20I match by five wickets, to confirm their series victory. South Africa won the sixth and final WT20I match by 105 runs, with India winning the series 3\u20131. In the WODI series, India won the first two matches to take an unassailable lead. India also won the final WODI match, by six runs, winning the series 3\u20130. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto\" |- !colspan=2|WODIs !colspan=2|WT20Is |- ! ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical- align:top\" | * Mithali Raj (c) * Harmanpreet Kaur (vc) * Taniya Bhatia (wk) * Ekta Bisht * Rajeshwari Gayakwad * Jhulan Goswami * Dayalan Hemalatha * Mansi Joshi * ~~Smriti Mandhana~~ * Shikha Pandey * Priya Punia * Punam Raut * Jemimah Rodrigues * Deepti Sharma * Pooja Vastrakar * Poonam Yadav | * Sun\u00e9 Luus (c) * Tazmin Brits * Trisha Chetty * Nadine de Klerk * Mignon du Preez * Lara Goodall * Shabnim Ismail * Marizanne Kapp * Ayabonga Khaka * Lizelle Lee * Nonkululeko Mlaba * Tumi Sekhukhune * Nondumiso Shangase * Laura Wolvaardt | * Harmanpreet Kaur (c) * Smriti Mandhana (vc) * Taniya Bhatia (wk) * Harleen Deol * Mansi Joshi * Veda Krishnamurthy * Shikha Pandey * Anuja Patil * Arundhati Reddy * Jemimah Rodrigues * Deepti Sharma * Pooja Vastrakar * Shafali Verma * Poonam Yadav * Radha Yadav | * Sun\u00e9 Luus (c) * Anne Bosch * Tazmin Brits * Trisha Chetty * Nadine de Klerk * Mignon du Preez * Lara Goodall * Shabnim Ismail * Sinalo Jafta * Marizanne Kapp * Ayabonga Khaka * Lizelle Lee * Nonkululeko Mlaba * Tumi Sekhukhune * Nondumiso Shangase * Laura Wolvaardt |} Ahead of the WODI series, Smriti Mandhana was ruled out of India's squad with a fractured toe.
