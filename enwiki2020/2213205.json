    "text": "PSR B0950+08 is a young pulsar that may have come from a supernova that occurred in Leo 1.8 million years ago. The remnant of this supernova may be the nearest besides the Local Bubble, and the supernova would have been as bright as the moon. Off-pulse emissions from the young pulsar were detected by the Expanded Long Wavelength Array, suggesting the presence of a pulsar wind nebula around it. ==External links== *The Astrophysical Journal Letters, vol. 576, p.
