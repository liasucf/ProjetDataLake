    "text": "William Woollcott Marx (born January 8, 1937) is an American pianist, arranger, and composer. == Early years == Marx was placed in the Children's Home Society in Los Angeles by his birth parents when he was eight months old, and four months later he was adopted by Harpo Marx and his wife, Susan Fleming. He attended the Juilliard School, where he studied composition, and he studied with composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. He began working in entertainment when he was 12 years old, when he was put in charge of his father's props for shows, including his harp. At 16 he became arranger and musical conductor for his father. == Composing and arranging == Marx's compositions include concertos for alto saxophone, flute, harp, piano, and violin. He also composed symphonies and scores for films, including the score for the film Weekend Pass (1984). Marx transcribed music that his father composed, because the elder Marx did not read music. The two worked together on two albums that Harpo recorded in the early 1960s. He also composed and arranged for recording artists in both jazz and popular music. In 1961, Marx signed with Vee-Jay Records. His projects there included arranging cover versions of music for four albums by the Castaway Strings. In 1967, he began writing music for commercials. == Performing and recording == As a performer, Marx has played in jazz clubs, lounges, and theaters. In the late 1980s, Marx and harpist Carrol McLaughlin toured the United States, giving performances and promoting Harpo Speaks, his father's autobiography. Their concerts featured \"exact renditions of songs that Harpo played\" and included a segment in which they dressed as Harpo and Chico Marx. They also recorded an album, From Harpo With Love. The duo's schedule for one spring included 42 venues in 21 states over a seven-week span. ==Recognition== In the early 1990s, Los Angeles magazine named Marx the most popular lounge pianist in that city. In 2002, he received a star at 265 S. Palm Canyon Drive on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars. == References == Category:20th-century American pianists Category:21st-century American pianists Category:20th-century American composers Category:21st-century American composers Category:Living people Category:1937 births Category:American male pianists Category:American male composers Category:Musicians from Los Angeles Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American male musicians ",
