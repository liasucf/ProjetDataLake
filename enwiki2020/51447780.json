    "text": "Binyamin Eliav (born Binyamin Lubotzky in Riga on 1909, died in Petah Tikva on July 30, 1974) was an Israeli politician, diplomat, author and editor. One of the founders of Betar, he was a close associate of revisionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky, but later became a member of the labour party, Mapai. Binyamin Lubotzky was born in Riga, Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire, and immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1925. His memoirs, Zikhronot min hayamin (Memories of the Right) describe his ideological shift to the left. According to the memoirs' editor Danny Rubinstein, Eliav could have been a rising star in Israeli politics, but failed due to his inability to deal with political intrigue. As a diplomat, he served as Israel's First Secretary in Buenos Aires and subsequently as Consul General in New York. He was also an editor of the Encyclopaedia Judaica. == References == Category:Israeli consuls Category:1909 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Diplomats from Riga Category:Latvian Jews Category:Latvian emigrants to Mandatory Palestine Category:Betar members ",
