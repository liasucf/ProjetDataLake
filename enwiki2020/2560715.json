The name Kojonup is believed to refer to the \"Kodja\" or stone axe made by Indigenous Australians, from the local stone. ==History== The Noongar people are the traditional owners and inhabitants of Kojonup. Specifically, the Noongar people of Kojonup today are descendants of the Kaneang tribe. Historically the Noongar people drank from the local freshwater spring and hunted game with the traditional Noongar \u2018kodj\u2019, or stone axe. Both Kojonup and The Kodja Place are named after the historically significant implement. Sovereignty has not been ceded. The first European in the area was surveyor Alfred Hillman who arrived in 1837 and had been guided to freshwater spring by the Noongar people. The site was an important staging place on the road to Albany, and in 1837 a military post was established there for the protection of travellers and the mail. By 1845 this outpost had grown to support a military barracks, built on the site of the freshwater spring. Today, the barracks still stands on its original site and houses the Kojonup Pioneer Museum. The barracks is one of the oldest buildings in Western Australia. The first farms in Kojonup were set up by soldiers with settlement grants. The appointment in 1865 of a mounted Police Constable marked the phasing out of the military presence at Kojonup. By the late 1860s the military had left and the Barracks became a focus for community gatherings, much as it is today. The town's first Police Station was built in 1869 and the first hotel licence was granted in 1868. In early 1898 the population of the town was 67, 32 men and 35 women. In 1926 the Kojonup Memorial Hall was built at a cost of \u00a35,000, it was officially opened by Major General Sir Talbot Hobbs. Kojonup has been the home to many important Australian Rules Football players, including several players of Indigenous Australian descent. ==Economy== Giant Dray in Kojonup The early economy of the town was initially dependent on cutting and transporting sandalwood and kangaroo hunting but by the mid-19th century the wool industry began to boom and by 1906 the shire had 10,500 sheep. By 1989 the shire had seen over 1 million sheep being shorn. To celebrate the importance of the wool industry the town built a one and a half scale model of a wool wagon; the project was officially opened on Australia Day in 2001. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops including organic, conventional and GMO.Paull, John (2015) The threat of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to organic agriculture: A case study update, Agriculture & Food, 3: 56-63. The Kojonup region has hosted some of Australia's earliest biodynamic and organic agriculture endeavours.Paull, John (2014) \"Ernesto Genoni: Australia\u2019s pioneer of biodynamic agriculture\", Journal of Organics, 1(1):57-81. The Marsh v Baxter case has put Kojonup at the epicentre of the battle in Australia of organic versus GMO agriculture. The town is a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling. ==Recreation== Sporting facilities include a golf club with 18 holes, a tennis club, a skate park, a 50-metre outdoor swimming pool, football oval, netball courts, and hockey ovals. Other attractions are Kodja Place Kojonup Youth Center and rose maze.
