    "text": "Salem University is a private for-profit university in Salem, West Virginia. It has about 250 on campus and about 600 online students that are enrolled in undergraduate as well as graduate programs, and was founded by the Seventh Day Baptist Church in 1888. ==History== The school was founded as Salem College in December 1888 by the Seventh Day Baptist Church. Over the next 100 years, the school continued as a liberal arts, teacher education, and nursing college. In 1989, Salem formed an alliance with Teikyo University of Tokyo, Japan, which changed the focus of the school to one of education of international students. Salem College was renamed Salem-Teikyo University. The alliance with Teikyo ended in 2000, when the school was purchased by investors from Singapore. At that time, the school changed its name to Salem International University. Salem International University was acquired by Salem Education LLC in June 2005. The school was renamed Salem University in September 2017. The Salem College Administration Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. ==Accreditation== Salem is regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. ==Academics== Salem offers a variety of undergraduate degrees including the Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Bachelor of Arts, and Bachelor of Science. The School of Nursing offers a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (a degree-completion program for registered nurses), and an Associate of Science in Nursing that prepares students to become Registered Nurses. At the graduate level, Salem offers a Master of Business Administration, a Master of Education, and a Master of Science in Nursing. Teachers may take courses in the School of Education as non-degree students to renew their licenses. A post-master's certificate in Educational Leadership is offered that leads to advanced licensure and a certificate in Special Education Leadership is also offered. All programs, including distance education programs, are delivered in a monthly format allowing students to complete their degrees more quickly than their counterparts at other traditional or online universities. This attracts non-traditional students conscious of time and accessibility. Since classes are four weeks long, the MBA or M.Ed. can be completed in 12 months or fewer, a Bachelor's in 40 months, or an Associate's in only 20 months, if a student were to start college studies without any prior college credits. ==Athletics== Salem participates in NCAA Division II athletics. Salem had been a charter member of the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) in 1924, but left that conference in 2010. Since that time, the Salem Tigers have been members of the Eastern College Athletic Conference in 17 men's and women's sports including basketball, baseball, softball, soccer, tennis, water polo, swimming, cross country, volleyball, and track. Salem is one of four West Virginia schools that joined the Great Midwest Athletic Conference (G-MAC) in July 2013. The other three schools were former WVIAC colleagues of Salem that had been cast adrift in the breakup of the WVIAC. Salem left the G-MAC at the end of the 2015-16 season. According to an official statement issued by the G-MAC: \u201cSalem International will be conducting a final year of (G-MAC) affiliation in 2015-2016. The institution is exploring alternate Division II conference membership options beginning with the 2016-2017 season.\u201d Salem remains an independent NCAA Division II institution with no conference affiliation in basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball and soccer. ==Notable alumni== * John Abramovic, former National Basketball Association (NBA) forward * Terry Bowden, former football coach at Salem, Samford University, and Auburn University * Kenny Brunner, basketball player; attended Salem University (2000\u20132001) but did not graduate * Mike Carey, head coach of the women's basketball team at West Virginia University * Jack Deloplaine, former National Football League (NFL) running back * Larry J.
