    "text": "Lakemont Park, located in Altoona, Pennsylvania, houses the world's oldest- surviving roller coaster, the Leap-The-Dips. On June 19, 1996, the roller coaster was added to the list of National Historic Landmarks by the National Park Service. The park opened in 1894 as a trolley park and became an amusement park in the summer of 1899. It is one of only thirteen trolley parks still operating, and the 8th oldest amusement park in the United States. The park was owned by the Boyer Candy Company from May 23, 1986 until July 1, 1988, when it was called Boyertown USA. The park was closed from 2017-2018, but re-opened in summer 2019. The park is located next to Peoples Natural Gas Field, home of the Altoona Curve Minor League Baseball team. ==History== Lakemont Park opened in 1894, was donated to Blair County in 1937, privatized in 1986, and remained in operation through 2016. The park closed at the beginning of the 2017 season, as many rides and attractions were undergoing maintenance. In 2018, Lakemont Park announced that it would remain closed with plans to reopen as a \"family entertainment location with some amusements\" in the summer of 2019. Lakemont indicated it is planning on selling most of the rides except for Skyliner, Leap the Dips, Antique Cars, Miniature Train, Paddle Boats, Indy Go-Karts, 4x4 Monster Trucks, Lil\u2019 Leaper, and the Waterpark. The park reopened in the summer of 2019. Sky Diver in the background, with the German Swings in the front.
