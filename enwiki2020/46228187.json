Third of four children to Ralph Weber, a lawyer, and Patricia Mueller, a teacher, she grew up in a large and musical family. Her grandfather required each of his 10 children to learn an instrument, so she was exposed to music from a young age from that family heritage. At 12, she joined the Central City Youth Gospel Choir in Milwaukee and began singing gospel in earnest at churches and revivals around the city, as the choir gave her \"instant validation that [her] voice could move people.\" In 2004, at age 16, she performed on the nationally televised Showtime at the Apollo in Harlem, NY. She sang the gospel hymn \"His Eye is on the Sparrow\". In the same year she was asked to perform at soccer icon Mia Hamm and baseball player Nomar Garciaparra's wedding in Santa Barbara, California. In 2006, she was nominated for and became a Presidential Scholar for the Arts, through her receipt of the Silver Award in Popular Voice from the National Young Arts Foundation in the same year. As a part of the Presidential Scholars, Weber performed at the Kennedy Center shortly after.
