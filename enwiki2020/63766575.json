    "text": "Prometheus is a Ukrainian educational platform of massive open online courses. The main objective of the project is to provide free access to the university- level courses to all interested persons, as well as to provide opportunities for publishing and distribution of such courses to leading teachers, universities and companies. Prometheus is a non-profitable organization founded in 2014 by Ivan Prymachenko and Oleksii Molchanovskyi. Until April 2019 it was a member of NGO-coalition promoting reforms in Ukraine \u2014 Reanimation Package of Reforms. Prometheus hosts 120 massive open online courses and have 1 million listeners. == History == The platform was founded in 2014 by Ivan Prymachenko (PhD student at T. Shevchenko University) and Oleksii Molchanovskyi (an information technologies teacher at Kyiv Polytechnic Institute). On October 15, 2014, registration was opened for the first four online courses of the project, which were prepared by teachers of three famous Ukrainian universities: Taras Shevchenko National University, Kyiv Polytechnic Institute and Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. == About == The average completion rate reaches 10%. About 80% of courses in Prometheus are its own ones. Founders realized that Ukrainian universities do not have a capacity to do online courses so they started to shoot and edit videos, design them, create publications, manage the content, and collect the audience by themselves. Subsequently, they established collaborations to create online courses with some universities or directly with some eminent professors. Later Prometheus started translating courses to Ukrainian language (f.e. in 2016 it launched Harvard Computer Science course). Prometheus obtained a license to translate massive open online courses for Ukrainian teachers by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Columbia Teachers College and Queensland University. Regular improvement of professional qualification is mandatory for teachers, in accordance with Ukrainian law. These online courses are one of the ways to gain appropriate certificates recognized by the Ministry of Education. Prometheus has a range of specific courses for the state servants (on decentralization reform, using the public e-procurement system ProZorro, etc.). == See also == * Interview with Prometheus Online Course Founder == References == Category:Education in Ukraine Category:E-learning ",
