The EIC had lost its monopoly on the trade between England and India and Caesar acquired a licence from the EIC to trade with India. Captain J. Taylor sailed from England in December 1816, bound for Fort William, India.Lloyd's Register \"Licensed and Country Ships\". In 1817 Lord Amherst was returning on from his embassy to China. On 18 February Alceste grounded on one of the many hidden reefs in the Java Sea. She was wrecked, and first Lord Amherst and his party, and then the rest of Alcestes officers and crew reached Batavia. Lord Amherst then engaged Caesar, which was at Batavia, to take all the survivors back to England. Caesar sailed on 17 April with Lord Amherst, his party, and the officers and men of Alceste. Several events marked the voyage. (Different sources give inconsistent dates for arrival and departure dates for Caesars stops on her way home.)

Caesar arrived at Simon's Bay on 27 May. Caesar sailed again in company with for St Helena on 11 June. Before leaving Batavia, Caesar had also loaded two unusual passengers, an orangutan and a python. Several accounts of the voyage mention the feeding of the python, and its dissection after its death on the way to St Helena. The orangutan eventually had free run of the ship and arrived safely in England. Caesar arrived at St Helena on 27 June. On 28 June Lord Amherst, Captain Maxwell of Alceste, and Mr. Lynn, her surgeon, met with Napoleon Bonaparte. They reported an amicable discussion. On 29 June, or 3 July, Caesar left St Helena. She arrived at Ascension Island on 7 July. She stayed less than a day, stopping only long enough to load eight large turtles. Caesar arrived at Spithead on 16 August. ==Fate== Caesar continued to trade with the East Indies on her return from repatriating Lord Amherst and the crew of Alceste. She was last listed in the Register of Shipping in 1824, and in Lloyd's Register in 1825 with J. Taylor, master, Taylor, owner, and trade London\u2013Bengal.
