    "text": "Code Composer Studio (CCStudio or CCS) is an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop applications for Texas Instruments (TI) embedded processors. Texas Instruments embedded processors include TMS320 DSPs, OMAP system-on-a-chip, DaVinci system-on-a-chip, Sitara applications processors, Hercules microcontrollers, Simplelink MCUs (MSP432 and Wireless connectivityWireless connectivity page at TI wiki microcontrollers), MSP430 and Tiva/Stellaris microcontrollers. It also enables debugging on several subsystems such as Ducati,Texas Instruments Ducati page at Omappedia wiki IVA AcceleratorImage Video Audio Accelerator page at TI wiki and PRU- ICSS.Programmable Real-Time Unit and Industrial Communication SubSystem page at TI wiki Code Composer Studio is primarily designed as for embedded project design and low-level (baremetal) JTAG based debugging. However, the latest releases are based on unmodified versions of the Eclipse open source IDE, which can be easily extended to include support for OS level application debug (Linux, Android, Windows Embedded) and open source compiler suites such as GCC. Early versions included a real time kernel called DSP/BIOS and its later inception SYS/BIOS. Currently, the successor to these tools, the TI-RTOS embedded tools ecosystem, is available for downloading as a free plugin to Code Composer Studio. == History == Originally Code Composer was a product from a company called GO DSP located in Toronto, Canada, and it was acquired by TI in 1997.TI Press release After the acquisition, Code Composer was bundled with a real-time kernel named DSP/BIOSHistory of SYS/BIOS and its name was appended with the word Studio. CCS releases up until 3.3 were based on a proprietary interface, but TI was already working in parallel on the development of an IDE based on the open-source Eclipse. This IDE was named Code Composer Essentials (CCE) and was designed for the MSP430 line of microcontrollers. This expertise was used to completely overhaul the previous CCS and starting with release 4.0 all versions are also based on Eclipse. Code Composer was originally developed for DSP development, therefore one of its main differentiators at the time was the availability of graphical visualization tools (XY graphs, FFT magnitude and phase, constellation, raw image visualization) and support for visualizing memory in several numeric formats (decimal, floating-point). Starting in 2015, a Cloud computing version of CCS was introduced and is part of the suite TI Cloud Tools,TI Cloud Tools main page which also hosts Resource ExplorerResource Explorer tools page at TI wiki and Pinmux.Pinmux utility page at TI wiki == Versions == ===Code Composer=== *4.10 (latest version in 2001). Supported all TMS320 DSPs at that time: C2x, C24x, C3x, C4x, C5x, C54x and C6x.

General release with bug fixes. ==Licensing== Over the years CCS followed the trend of the software industry for reduced and free-of-charge software licensing, reflected across the releases: *CCS releases up to 2.x were separated per device family, i.e., every device family required the purchase of a separate license and a separate software Each license's SRP was US$3,600.00 (apart from release 2.3, which was about US$4,500.00) *Starting with releases 3.x, all device families were included in the same license (then called Platinum). The license's SRP was the same (US$3,600.00). There was a C2x-only limited license that retailed for US$600.00. *Starting with release 4.x, CCS can be used for free in several scenarios that include development boards, software device simulators and even the use of a standalone emulator named XDS100.CCS license page at TI wiki Also, it can be used with a codesize limitation of 16kB on MSP430 devices. This release also introduced the floating license, which can be installed on a server and be used across a company's or university's Intranet at almost the cost of a full license. **A full license for CCS release 4.x had an SRP of US$1,995.00 and a microcontroller-only license was US$495.00. This microcontroller license covered all MSP430, Stellaris and C2x devices. **A full license for CCS releases 5.x and 6.x has an SRP of US$495.00 and the microcontroller-only license ceased to exist.CCSv6 license page at TI wiki **Starting in September 2016, the floating license model ceased to exist. **For CCS release 7.x the paid license ceased to exist. The software and all its components are distributed with a TSPA license. ***The free license model was also retrofitted to all public CCS releases since v4. For all releases an annual paid subscription fee was required to grant updates for upcoming major releases. *Starting in August 2015, the concept of subscription fee ceased to exist. ==JTAG Debug probe support== Historically CCS supported only JTAG debug probes from TI - also called XDS emulators.JTAG emulators at www.ti.com The XDS510-class and the more advanced XDS560-class emulators are supported across all releases, but the new low-cost XDS100-class emulator started to be supported starting with the latest patches to release 3.3. Releases 4.x added support for an updated design of the existing XDS100-class emulator (called XDS100v2) and, in release 4.2, added support for an updated design of the XDS560-class emulator (called XDS560v2).CCS releases at TI wiki Release 5.2 added support for the new XDS200-class emulators. Up until release 4.x, CCS supported only XDS emulators. With the integration of MSP430 and Stellaris microcontrollers, support was added for their respective JTAG debug probes: MSP-FET430 (both parallel and USB versions) and ICDI. Release 5.x also saw the introduction of Beta support for J-Link JTAG debug probes from Segger.Segger Jlink support page at TI wiki Release 6.0.x saw the introduction of the new MSP-FET debug probe for MSP430 devicesMSP-FET page at TI website and the new XDS200-classXDS200 page at TI website of debug probes for processors. Release 6.1.x saw the introduction of the new XDS110-classXDS110 page at TI wiki of debug probes for processors. It also saw the migration to full production support for J-Link JTAG debug probes from Segger. Release 7.x saw the integration of J-Link JTAG debug probes from Segger directly in the CCS installer. It is also the first release to support the standalone version of XDS110. 64-bit releases do not support Spectrum Digital XDS510USB JTAG debuggers. == See also == * eXpressDSP == References == == External links == Category:Integrated development environments Category:Texas Instruments ",
