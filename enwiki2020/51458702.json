In his 1986 biography, Justin de Villeneuve, de Paul's manager at the time wrote \"I gave Rupert Holmes a call in New York. He agreed to see me if I flew to America. Polydor, with the prospect of the involvement with Holmes, agreed to up the budget\".

The album also featured an updated, re-recording of her earlier hit single \"My Man and Me\", giving it a more blues/country style than the original ballad. The final track \"Beautiful\" is a song in its own right but ends by reprising snatches of each of the album's songs woven into the fade out, giving it a moody atmospheric feel. As noted elsewhere, de Paul's vocals had never sounded stronger, in a style somewhere between Crystal Gayle and Maria Muldaur, in spite of her apparently suffering from a bout of hay fever at the time.An Affectionate Punch by Justin De Villeneuve.
