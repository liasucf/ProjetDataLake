    "text": "Richard Paul Keirn (29 July 1924 \u2013 22 May 2000) was a Colonel and fighter pilot in the United States Air Force. He was one of two United States service members to be a prisoner of war (POW) in both World War II and the Vietnam War and was the first US airman to be shot down by a Surface-to-air missile (SAM) during the Vietnam War. ==Early life== Keirn was born on 29 July 1924 in Akron, Ohio. ==Air Force career== While serving as a USAAF flight officer during World War II, his B-17 was shot down on his first mission and he was held as a POW in Nazi Germany from 11 September 1944 to 5 May 1945. Following World War II he served in the Ohio Air National Guard 164th Fighter Interceptor Squadron before returning to the active Air Force in December 1956. Captain Keirn volunteered for duty in Vietnam and in July 1965 deployed with the 47th Tactical Fighter Squadron to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. On 24 July 1965 his F-4C Phantom #63-7599 was shot down by a North Vietnamese SAM-2 northeast of Hanoi, in the first loss of a US aircraft to a Vietnamese SAM. Keirn ejected successfully from his stricken aircraft and was captured. His bombardier/navigator Captain Roscoe H. Fobair failed to eject and was killed, his remains were recovered in 2001. During his captivity, Keirn was one of 52 Americans forced to participate in the Hanoi March, a propaganda event held in July 1966 in which U.S. POWs were marched through the streets of Hanoi and brutally beaten by North Vietnamese civilians. He was released on 12 February 1973 as a part of Operation Homecoming. Upon return to the United States, Keirn returned to flying status with the Air Force, flying both the O-2 Skymaster, and RF-4C Phantom II, and served as Assistant Director and as Director of Operational Services, Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations, Headquarters Ninth Air Force, Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, from 23 April 1975 to 30 June 1976. ===Military awards and decorations=== Colonel Keirn's major military awards and decorations include: {| align=\"center\" |- |colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"| |- | | | |- | | | |- | | | |- | | | |- | | | |- | | | |- | | | |- | | | |- | | | |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- |colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |USAF Command Pilot Badge |- |Silver Star |Legion of Merit w/ 1 bronze oak leaf cluster |Distinguished Flying Cross w/ 2 bronze oak leaf cluster |- |Bronze Star w/ Valor device and 3 bronze oak leaf clusters |Purple Heart w/ 4 bronze oak leaf clusters |Air Medal |- |Joint Service Commendation Medal |Air Force Commendation Medal |Air Force Presidential Unit Citation w/ 2 bronze oak leaf clusters |- |Air Force Outstanding Unit Award |Prisoner of War Medal w/ 1 bronze service star |Combat Readiness Medal |- |Army Good Conduct Medal |American Campaign Medal |European\u2013African\u2013Middle Eastern Campaign Medal w/ 1 silver and 2 bronze campaign stars |- |European\u2013African\u2013Middle Eastern Campaign Medal (second ribbon required for accouterment spacing) |World War II Victory Medal |Medal for Humane Action |- |National Defense Service Medal w/ 1 service star |Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal |Vietnam Service Medal w/ 4 bronze campaign stars |- |Air Force Longevity Service Award w/ 4 bronze oak leaf clusters |Armed Forces Reserve Medal w/ silver hourglass device |Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon |- |Croix de Guerre with Palm (France) |Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation w/ Palm and Frame |Vietnam Campaign Medal |} ===Silver Star citation=== :Lieutenant Colonel Richard P.
