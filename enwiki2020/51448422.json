    "text": "New York, New Sound is an album by the Gerald Wilson Orchestra recorded in 2003 and released on the Mack Avenue label.Mack Avenue catalog, accessed August 26, 2016 ==Reception== AllMusic rated the album with 3 stars; in his review, Alex Henderson noted: \"Wilson's musical personality is very much in evidence -- and his personality is that of an arranger/bandleader, not a hotshot soloist. Wilson prefers to leave the soloing to other people, which is something he has long had in common with Duke Ellington\". In JazzTimes Ira Gitler wrote: \"Hats off to the all-star band, but especially Wilson for the intersectional sonic vibrancy and overall dynamics he gave them to work with\".Gitler, I. JazzTimes review December 2003 On All About Jazz Russell Moon noted: \"There is good and bad news here. The good news is that the album is terrific. Many jazz fans will be introduced to Wilson's talent through this album, and will seek more. No doubt Gerald Wilson will be in demand because of this album. The bad news is that the New Sound of New York isn't as good as the old sound of Los Angeles to this listener's ears... So give Gerald Wilson full marks for the courage to take on some of his best work and give it a new visage\".Moon, R.
