The station serves the north-eastern Melbourne suburb of South Morang, and is the only station on the extension that is not elevated. It opened on 26 August 2018.Meet Mernda, your new line. Public Transport Victoria ==History== The station was first announced as one of two new stations from the Mernda Rail project, an extension of the South Morang line along the former Whittlesea line right of way. Hawkstowe station was added to the plan after community pressure. From 26 August 2018, Comeng and X-Trapolis 100 trains began to operate on the Mernda line beyond South Morang. ==Platforms and services== Platform 1: *Mernda line: services to Flinders Street Platform 2: *Mernda line: services to Mernda ==Transport links== Dyson's Bus Services operate one route via Middle Gorge station *383: RMIT Bundoora \u2013 Mill Park Lakes ==Naming== The station was originally to be named \"Marymede\", after the nearby Marymede Catholic College. However, this went against Victorian place-naming conventions, as it was named after a school. This caused public outrage for many reasons, mainly because its namesake is located over 2 km from the station site. A letter sent from residents to the Victorian Government states that there was no consultation in the naming process, and that it does not accurately represent the station's location. Residents believe the station should be called \"South Morang\", whilst the current South Morang station be renamed to \"Plenty Valley\", in order to better reflect their locations. ==References== ==External links== Category:Railway stations in Melbourne Category:Railway stations in Australia opened in 2018 ",
