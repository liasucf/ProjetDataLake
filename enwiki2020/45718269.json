    "text": "The Turtle River is a river in Vilas County and Iron County in the state of Wisconsin in the United States. Its source is South Turtle Lake near Winchester. It flows into the Turtle-Flambeau Flowage. Historically the Turtle River was an important part of an extensive network of canoe routes linked by short land portages, used by the Ojibwe and fur traders. In modern times the river and the lakes it connects are popular recreational waterways. ==References== ==External links== Category:Rivers of Wisconsin Category:Bodies of water of Vilas County, Wisconsin Category:Rivers of Iron County, Wisconsin ",
