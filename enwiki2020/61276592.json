    "text": "The Thirty Year Genocide: Turkey\u2019s Destruction of Its Christian Minorities, 1894\u20131924 is a 2019 history of extermination campaigns carried out by the Ottoman Empire against the Empire's Christian subjects written by Benny Morris and Dror Ze\u2019evi. ==Publication history== The book was written by Israeli historians Benny Morris and Dror Ze\u2019evi and published by Harvard University Press in 2019. A Greek edition is forthcoming. ==Content== The central argument of the book is that the Hamidian massacres, Armenian Genocide and Greek genocide should be understood as a single event which targeted all the Christian minorities in the Ottoman empire. The authors identify a pattern that repeats, with minor variations, across the time period under study. The first targets of attack are men of military age and those with influence, then women and children are handled later. Following previous scholarship, the authors identify Islam and religious fundamentalism as the primary causes of the genocide, which had as its aim the foundation of a pure, Muslim state. The book is more than 640 pages long. ==Reception== Herv\u00e9 Georgelin describes the book \"an ambitious and comprehensive work on the extinction of Christian life on the former central Ottoman lands\" and a \"a clever and learned synthesis\". According to Georgelin, the fact that both authors do not belong to any of the affected communities means that they can take a birds'-eye view as opposed to \"duplicat[ing] social ethno-religious boundaries, to little heuristic avail\". According to Laura Robson, the book is \"intended to serve not just as history but also as warning\". She argues that Morris and Ze'evi, who rely heavily on British and American sources, have a limited understanding of how the Ottoman millet system actually operated in practice, and underestimate the role of the expulsions and mass killings of Muslims during the Balkan wars as a trigger for the genocide. ==References== ==External links== * The Thirty-Year Genocide - Harvard University Press Category:2019 non-fiction books Category:History books about the Armenian Genocide Category:Literary collaborations Category:Harvard University Press books Category:Works about the Greek genocide Category:Hamidian massacres ",
