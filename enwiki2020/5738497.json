Dena replaced Kristen Henderson (guitar/bass), who originally played drums in the band before taking up guitar.

GGD was a major attraction on the East Coast's cover band circuit drawing major crowds wherever they performed. They also opened for many signed artists like Korn and Fuel. Dena was also one of the original members of New Jersey's pop/punk/rock band \"From The Desk of Sally\". While in FDOS, Dena recorded the band's first demo and recorded all drum tracks for the band's first official release \" Everything and Nothing\". Dena departed before its release in 1999. She lists The Carpenters, The Beatles and The Pretenders as some of her musical influences. ==Antigone Rising== The band released four independent albums before they signed with a major label.
