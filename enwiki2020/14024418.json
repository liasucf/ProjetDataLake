    "text": "In virology, a nonstructural protein is a protein encoded by a virus but that is not part of the viral particle. They typically include the various enzymes and transcription factors the virus uses to replicate itself, such as a viral protease (3CL/nsp5, etc.), an RNA replicase or other template-directed polymerases, and some means to control the host. ==Examples== * NSP1 (rotavirus) * NSP4 (rotavirus) * NSP5 (rotavirus) * Influenza non-structural protein * NS1 influenza protein * HBcAg, core antigen of hepatitis B ==References== ",
