They were formed by the British American Football Association in 2010 following the collapse of the former British American Football League to coordinate contact football within Great Britain. There are currently 62 teams who compete in 12 divisions across three levels of football. The 10 teams who contest both the two BAFA Premier Division's compete to reach the annual Britbowl final, where as teams in the second and third level aim to earn promotion to the Division above attempting to reach one of the six regional bowl finals. The current champions are the London Warriors who won the 2019 Britbowl as well as the Premier Division South, they are also the most successful team having won 6 titles since the League's reformation in it's current guise. ==History== The Leicester Falcons take on the East Kilbride PiratesAmerican football was introduced to the United Kingdom during the early part of the 20th century by American servicemen stationed in the country. The first recorded match took place on 23 November 1910 at Crystal Palace, London, where a team made up of the crew from USS Idaho defeated their counterparts from USS Vermont 19\u20130. During the Second World War, matches were played by American and Canadian servicemen stationed in the UK at venues throughout the country. This included the 'Tea Bowl' game played at the White City Stadium in 1944, and this was followed by the creation of the United States Armed Forces Europe (USAFE) league in 1946. This league consisted of teams from American military bases throughout Europe, with one of the league's three conferences made up of teams based in the UK \u2013 teams from this conference won the league championship thirteen times until the competition ceased in 1993. The first teams open to British players were established in 1983, and competition began the following year in the form of a series of one-off games. The match results were compiled into a 'Merit Table', with teams playing more than three games eligible for the championship--the first champions were the London Ravens, who won all ten of their matches. Tensions grew between the directors of British American Football League and those of the British American Football Association, the governing body throughout 2009 and at the beginning of 2010, BAFL formally, but unconstitutionally, withdrew from BAFA. This led to uproar from the teams within BAFL, ultimately signalling the end for BAFL as an entity. The league ceased operations on 1 April 2010. The league was replaced by the BAFA Community Leagues for the 2010 season. This organisation, run under the umbrella of the governing body, rebranded in 2011 to become the BAFA National Leagues. Hundreds of clubs have since been formed, playing both full contact football and flag football at senior, university and youth level. Many of these clubs have since folded, renamed or merged with other local teams, but a few of the older clubs survive today. ==Season format== The West Coast Trojans offence lines up against the defence of the Dundee Hurricanes The BAFANL season format consists of a ten-game season for Premier Division teams and First Division teams, with 8 for Second Division. The League operates between April and August with play-off games usually running into September. The winner of top two teams from both the Premier Division North and Premier Division South make up the semi final in which they will play to win a place in the Britbowl. First and Second Division teams aim to win promotion to the division above by attempting to reach their respective play-off final. The team that finishes bottom of their Division are relegated to their Regional division below. (excluding Division Two) Since 2014, The Britbowl winners will automatically qualify to play in the IFAF Europe Champions League for the following season. European games run aside the clubs domestic season. Prior to 2014 qualification was for the EFAF Cup. ==Stadiums== The Sixways Stadium in Worcester is primarily used for the Britbowl The use of Stadiums in the BAFANL is scarce due to most clubs running on a tight budget. Most clubs operate from Rugby Union clubs, University facilities or High Schools however some teams do play inside stadiums which have seating capacities for spectators. The Britbowl itself has recently been played at Sixways Stadium in Worcester, while Division 1 and 2 finals are hosted at the South Leeds Stadium. At present the Halton Spartans ground share of the Select Security Stadium with Rugby league team Widnes Vikings constitutes as the highest capacity stadium within the BAFANL with 13,350 seats. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center; font-size:95%;width:50%; text-align:left\" !Team !Stadium !Capacity |---- |Halton Spartans || Select Security Stadium || 13,350 |---- |Manchester Titans || National Speedway Stadium || 6,700 |---- |West Coast Trojans || Meadow Park || 5,000 |---- |Leicester Falcons || De Montfort Park || 4,329 |---- |Yorkshire Rams || South Leeds Stadium || 4,000 |---- |Scunthorpe Alphas || Quibell Park Stadium || 3,000 |---- |---- |Edinburgh Wolves || Meggetland Sports Complex || 3,000 |---- |Northumberland Vikings || Druid Park || 2,500 |---- |Nottingham Caesars || Harvey Hadden Stadium || 1,600 |---- |London Olympians || Well Hall || 1,550 |---- |London Blitz || Finsbury Park Stadium || 1,500 |---- |East Kilbride Pirates || Braidholm || 1,250 |---- |London Warriors || Frant Road || 1,000 |---- |Farnham Knights || Wilkinson Way || 1,100 |---- |Gateshead Senators || Monkton Stadium|| 1,000 |---- |Tamworth Phoenix || Pack Meadow || 750 |---- |Glasgow Tigers || Lochinch Stadium || 700 |---- |South Wales Warriors || The Dairy Field || 700 |---- |Sandwell Steelers || Tipton Sports Academy || 650 |---- |Ouse Valley Eagles || Bedford International Athletics Stadium || 600 |---- |Oxford Saints || Tilsley Park || 550 |---- |Clyde Valley Blackhawks || Beltane Park || 500 |---- |Ipswich Cardinals || Northgate International Sports Centre || 400 |} ==Teams== === Premier Division === The BAFA's Premier Division for the 2020 season comprises twelve teams, split into the North and South Divisions. Within each division each team plays each other twice. There will be 2 rounds of playoff football with the top ranked team in the North will host the second ranked team in the South whilst the top ranked team in the South will host the second ranked team in the North. The winners will then compete for the BritBowl. The team who finishes bottom of each division are relegated to Division 1 for the following season and are replaced by both of the Division 1 winners. ====Premier North==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;width:50%; text-align:left\" !Team !Based !Founded !Colours |---- |Edinburgh Wolves || Edinburgh, Scotland || 2002 || Grey and Red |---- |Manchester Titans || Gorton, Manchester || 2003 || Royal Blue and Gold |---- |Merseyside Nighthawks || Skelmersdale, Lancashire || 1984 || Black and Red |---- |Sandwell Steelers|| Tipton, West Midlands || 2013 || Grey and Black |---- |Sheffield Giants || Sheffield, South Yorkshire || 2008 || Sky Blue and Black |---- |Tamworth Phoenix || Coleshill, Warwickshire || 2004 || Black and Orange |} ====Premier South==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;width:50%; text-align:left\" !Team !Based !Founded !Colours |---- |Bristol Aztecs || Filton, Bristol || 1990 || Grey and Orange |---- |Kent Exiles|| Bromley, Kent || 2004 || Black and White |---- |London Blitz || Finsbury Park, London || 1995 || Navy Blue and White |---- |London Olympians|| Eltham, London || 1984 || White and Burgundy |---- |London Warriors || Thornton Heath, London || 2007 || Black and White |---- |Solent Thrashers|| Southampton, Hampshire || 2003 || Grey and Gold |---- |} ===Division One=== For the 2018 season, the second tier has expanded to 24 teams, now divided into 4 conferences of six: the Northern North, Northern South, Southern Central and the Southern East.
