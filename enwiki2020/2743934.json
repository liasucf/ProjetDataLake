    "text": "Omicron Virginis (\u03bf Vir, \u03bf Virginis) is a star in the zodiac constellation of Virgo. It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +4.12. Based upon parallax measurements, it is about 163 light years from the Sun. \u03bf Virginis is a G-type giant star with a stellar classification of G8 IIIa CN-1Ba1CH1. This indicates that it is a Barium star. Typically Barium stars are close binaries with a white dwarf companion, but no companion has been detected for \u03bf Virginis. It has been suggested that an excess SiIV emission flux is due to an unseen white dwarf companion. \u03bf Virginis is a giant star around tens times larger than the sun. Although it is slightly cooler, it is radiating about 60-132 times the luminosity of the Sun. It is over twice as massive as the sun and is around a billion years old. A simplified statistical analysis suggests that \u03bf Virginis is likely to be a red giant branch star fusing hydrogen in a shell around an inert helium core, but there is about a 22% chance that it is a horizontal branch star fusing helium in its core. ==References== Category:G-type giants Category:Barium stars Virginis, Omicron Category:Virgo (constellation) BD+09 2583 Virginis, 009 3703 104979 058948 4608 ",
