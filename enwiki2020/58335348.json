Take Godofredo Alves for example, an everyday Lisbon business man, who comes home only to discover his wife, Ludovina, on the Yellow Sofa, in the clutches of his business partner, Machado. Godofredo's world then falls apart: he throws his wife out of their house, he consults his father-in-law Neto, and he turns to his friends Carvalho and Medeiros, in the hope that they might offer him a solution. Throughout the twisting and turning of Godofredo's newly awakened emotions, he converses with Amarela, the Yellow Sofa, contemplating a series of melodramatic solutions, including taking his own life, or challenging Machado to a duel. Eventually, Godofredo's feelings reach a peak of tension: and while he experiences his own dark night of the soul, his friends come to a collective decision on his behalf, offering a bathetic release from desperate heroics. And so Godofredo returns to his humdrum life but on re-encountering his wife at the opera, they are reconciled over his inability to wind up the family clock. == Forces == The Yellow Sofa is scored for string orchestra, two guitars (one classical, one Portuguese) and piano.
