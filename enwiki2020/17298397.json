    "text": "The TeleGarden was a telerobotic community garden for the Internet. Starting in the mid-1990s, it allowed users to view, plant and take care of a small garden, using an Adept-1 industrial robotic arm controlled online. ==History== The project began at the University of Southern Californiahttp://www.usc.edu/dept/garden/ with project directors Ken Goldberg of University of Southern California, and Joseph Santarromana, a University of California, Irvine artist at the time known for his video installations. They envisioned it as an art installation challenging the notion of the InternetKen Goldberg - Mark Tribe - Brown University Wiki and \"consider[ing] the 'post- nomadic' community, where survival favors those who work together.\" Project members included George A. Bekey, Steven Gentner, Rosemary Morris, Carl Sutter, Jeff Wiegley, and Erich Berger. The Telegarden went online in June 1995. During its first year, it attracted over 9000 members. In September 1996, the Telegarden was moved to the Ars Electronica Center in Austria where it was originally planned to be on display for one year, though it ended up remaining active until . The Telegarden was a fusion between old technology (agriculture) and new technology (the Internet). The notion of a physical garden that is operated by users online was appealing to Goldberg because \"it was the most absurd\". This new media art raised questions of legitimacy. How are users to know that the garden actually exists, or that any of their motions matter? Goldberg stressed that, \"media technology generally facilities the suspension of disbelief.\"Telegarden Description from YouTube In its nine years, the installation had 10,000 members, and 100,000 people visited the physical exhibit. Users interactivity created a miniature social network. People became protective of plants, even territorial. ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Telegarden homepage from Ken Goldberg *Ken Goldberg's UC Berkeley homepage *Introduction to Telegarden by Ars Electronic (Linz, Austria) *Photo Collage and Description from \"Database of Virtual Art\" (virtualart.at) *\"Telematic Connections,\" Curated Piece on the Development of Telepresence from the Walker Art Center *\"A Performance Space without Geographical Boundaries\" (1977) from ecafe.com *Muntadas's \"File Room\" (1994) Category:Community gardening Category:Internet art Category:Installation art works Category:Student activities at the University of Southern California Category:Types of garden Category:Internet properties established in 1995 Category:2004 disestablishments ",
