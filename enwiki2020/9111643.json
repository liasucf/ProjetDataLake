It is held annually, usually in January, at the Suphachalasai Stadium in Bangkok, Thailand. Apart from the match itself (which is not played by strictly varsity teams, but include alumni), the event also focuses on card stunts performed by both sides' audiences, cheerleading, and the opening ceremony parades, of which Thammasat's politics-mocking sequence is an anticipated highlight. The event is regularly broadcast on national television. ==History== center Politics-mocking parade in Chula-Thammasat traditional football match 2018The match was started in 1934 by alumni of Suankularb Wittayalai School who were studying at both universities, intending it to be a varsity match in the likes of the British Oxford\u2013Cambridge Boat Race. The first match was held on 4 December 1934 at the Sanam Luang field, with Thammasat University as the host. There was a ticket fee of 1 baht, the proceedings of which went to the Anti-tuberculosis Society of Thailand; after- expense earnings from the match have since traditionally been donated to charity. The two universities alternate roles as hosts. From 1935 to 1937 the match was held at the Suankularb Wittayalai School football field, and since 1938 has been held at Suphachalasai Stadium (also known as the National Stadium), except in 1985, 1986, 1988 and 2008 when the match was held at the Chulalongkorn University Stadium. Starting in 1949, the Royal Cup has been awarded for the match. The match has been cancelled several times, due to the flooding of Bangkok in 1942, World War II and its aftermath from 1944\u20131948, the Manhattan Rebellion in 1951, the aftermath of the 14 October 1973 and 6 October 1976 conflicts in 1973\u20131975 and 1977, political crisis in 2014, and the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2017. The latest match, the 74th, was hosted by Chulalongkorn University and took place on 8 February 2020. ==Results== *Thammasat: 24 wins *Chulalongkorn: 18 wins *Draws: 32 {| width=\"100%\" | {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !\u2116!!Date!!Winner!!Score |- |1 ||4 December 1934||Draw||1\u20131 |- |2||1935||Draw||3\u20133 |- |3 ||1936||Thammasat||4\u20131 |- |4 ||1937||Thammasat||2\u20131 |- |5 ||1938||Thammasat||2\u20131 |- |6 ||1939||Draw||0\u20130 |- |7||1940||Draw||2\u20132 |- |8||1941||Chulalongkorn||2\u20130 |- |9||1942||Chulalongkorn||3\u20131 |- |10||30 December 1949||Thammasat||3\u20132 |- |11||30 December 1950||Chulalongkorn||5\u20133 |- |12||27 December 1952||Draw ||0\u20130 |- |13||19 December 1953||Thammasat||3\u20131 |- |14||25 December 1954||Chulalongkorn||1\u20130 |- |15||24 December 1955||Draw||2\u20132 |- |16||25 December 1956||Draw||0\u20130 |- |17||21 December 1957||Thammasat||3\u20131 |- |18||20 December 1958||Chulalongkorn||3\u20132 |- |19||26 December 1959||Thammasat||2\u20131 |- |20||27 December 1960||Draw||1\u20131 |- |21||23 December 1961||Draw||1\u20131 |- |22||22 December 1962||Draw||0\u20130 |- |23||8 January 1964||Thammasat ||3\u20131 |- |24||26 December 1964||Thammasat||3\u20130 |- |25||25 December 1965||Thammasat||2\u20131 |- |26||24 December 1966||Thammasat||2\u20130 |- |27||30 December 1967||Draw||1\u20131 |- |28||21 December 1968||Chulalongkorn||2\u20130 |- |29||27 December 1969||Thammasat||1\u20130 |- |30||30 January 1971||Draw||0\u20130 |- |31||29 January 1972||Thammasat||4\u20130 |- |32||23 December 1972||Thammasat||2\u20131 |- |33||31 January 1976||Thammasat||2\u20130 |- |34||21 January 1978||Thammasat||1\u20130 |- |35||20 January 1979||Chulalongkorn||2\u20130 |- |36||19 January 1980||Draw||0\u20130 |} |valign=\"top\"| {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" !\u2116!!Date!!Winner!!Score |- |37||31 January 1981||Draw||1\u20131 |- |38||27 January 1982||Draw||2\u20132 |- |39||29 January 1983||Draw||1\u20131 |- |40||21 January 1984||Thammasat ||1\u20130 |- |41||27 January 1985||Draw||1\u20131 |- |42||26 January 1986||Draw||1\u20131 |- |43||25 January 1987||Thammasat||1\u20130 |- |44||30 January 1988||Chulalongkorn||2\u20131 |- |45||21 January 1989||Chulalongkorn||2\u20131 |- |46||20 January 1990||Draw||1\u20131 |- |47||19 January 1991||Draw||0\u20130 |- |48||18 January 1992||Draw||1\u20131 |- |49||23 January 1993||Thammasat||2\u20131 |- |50||22 January 1994||Draw||2\u20132 |- |51||21 January 1995||Chulalongkorn||2\u20131 |- |52||20 January 1996||Thammasat||1\u20130 |- |53||18 January 1997||Draw||1\u20131 |- |54||7 February 1998||Draw||0\u20130 |- |55||23 January 1999||Chulalongkorn||2\u20131 |- |56||15 January 2000||Draw||0\u20130 |- |57||20 January 2001||Chulalongkorn||2\u20130 |- |58||19 January 2002||Draw||2\u20132 |- |59||25 January 2003||Draw||0\u20130 |- |60||24 January 2004||Draw||0\u20130 |- |61||22 January 2005||Thammasat||1\u20130 |- |62||21 January 2006||Chulalongkorn||2\u20130 |- |63||20 January 2007||Draw||1\u20131 |- |64||17 May 2008||Draw||0\u20130 |- |65||31 January 2009||Thammasat||2\u20130 |- |66||16 January 2010||Draw||0\u20130 |- |67||5 February 2011|| Chulalongkorn || 3\u20131 |- |68||25 February 2012|| Chulalongkorn || 1\u20130 |- |69||2 February 2013|| Chulalongkorn || 1\u20130 |- |70||7 February 2015|| Thammasat || 2\u20130 |- |71||13 February 2016|| Thammasat || 5\u20131 |- |72||3 February 2018|| Draw || 1\u20131 |- |73||9 February 2019|| Chulalongkorn || 2\u20131 |- |74||8 February 2020|| Chulalongkorn || 2\u20131 |} |} ==See also== * Football in Thailand * College rivalry ==References== Category:Football cup competitions in Thailand Category:Chulalongkorn University Category:Thammasat University Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1934 Category:1934 establishments in Siam Category:Student sport in Thailand Category:Thai political satire ",
