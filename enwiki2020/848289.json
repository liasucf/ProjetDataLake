    "text": "Chenopodium album is a fast-growing weedy annual plant in the genus Chenopodium. Though cultivated in some regions, the plant is elsewhere considered a weed. Common names include lamb's quarters, melde, goosefoot, manure weed, wild spinach and fat-hen, though the latter two are also applied to other species of the genus Chenopodium, for which reason it is often distinguished as white goosefoot.BSBI: Database of names (xls file) Flora of NW Europe: Chenopodium album Chenopodium album is extensively cultivated and consumed in Northern India as a food crop known as bathua.\"Handbook of Herbs Cultivation and Processing\", By Niir Board, p. 146 ==Distribution== Its native range is obscure due to extensive cultivation, but includes most of Europe,Flora Europaea: Chenopodium album from where Linnaeus described the species in 1753.Linnaeus, C. (1753). Species Plantarum 1: 219. Facsimile. Plants native in eastern Asia are included under C. album, but often differ from European specimens.Flora of China: Chenopodium album It is widely naturalised elsewhere, e.g. Africa,African Flowering Plants Database: Chenopodium album Australasia,Australian Plant Name Index: Chenopodium album North America,Flora of North America: Chenopodium album and Oceania,Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk: Chenopodium album and now occurs almost everywhere (even, apparently in Antarctica) in soils rich in nitrogen, especially on wasteland. ==Botany== It tends to grow upright at first, reaching heights of 10\u2013150 cm (rarely to 3 m), but typically becomes recumbent after flowering (due to the weight of the foliage and seeds) unless supported by other plants. The leaves are alternate and varied in appearance. The first leaves, near the base of the plant, are toothed and roughly diamond-shaped, 3\u20137 cm long and 3\u20136 cm broad. The leaves on the upper part of the flowering stems are entire and lanceolate-rhomboid, 1\u20135 cm long and 0.4\u20132 cm broad; they are waxy-coated, unwettable and mealy in appearance, with a whitish coat on the underside. The small flowers are radially symmetrical and grow in small cymes on a dense branched inflorescence 10\u201340 cm long. Further, the flowers are bisexual and female, with five tepals which are mealy on outer surface, and shortly united at the base. There are five stamens. ===Taxonomy=== Chenopodium album has a very complex taxonomy and has been divided in numerous microspecies, subspecies and varieties, but it is difficult to differentiate between them. The following infraspecific taxa are accepted by the Flora Europaea: * Chenopodium album subsp. album * Chenopodium album subsp. striatum (Kra\u0161an) Murr * Chenopodium album var. reticulatum (Aellen) Uotila Published names and synonyms include C. album var. microphyllum, C. album var. stevensii, C. acerifolium, C. centrorubrum, C. giganteum, C. jenissejense, C. lanceolatum, C. pedunculare and C. probstii. It also hybridises readily with several other Chenopodium species, including C. berlandieri, C. ficifolium, C. opulifolium, C. strictum and C. suecicum. ==Cultivation== ===Regions=== The species are cultivated as a grain or vegetable crop (such as in lieu of spinach), as well as animal feed in Asia and Africa, whereas in Europe and North America, it is commonly regarded as a weed in places such as potato fields,Grubben, G. J. H., & Denton, O. A. (2004). Plant Resources of Tropical Africa 2. Vegetables. PROTA Foundation, Wageningen; Backhuys, Leiden; CTA, Wageningen. while in Australia it is naturalised in all states and regarded as an environmental weed in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. ===Potential impact on conventional crops=== It is one of the more robust and competitive weeds, capable of producing crop losses of up to 13% in corn, 25% in soybeans, and 48% in sugar beets at an average plant distribution. It may be controlled by dark tillage, rotary hoeing, or flaming when the plants are small. Crop rotation of small grains will suppress an infestation. It is easily controlled with a number of pre-emergence herbicides. Its pollen may contribute to hay fever-like allergies. ===Pest control=== Chenopodium album is vulnerable to leaf miners, making it a useful trap crop as a companion plant. Growing near other plants, it attracts leaf miners which might otherwise have attacked the crop to be protected. It is a host plant for the beet leafhopper, an insect which transmits curly top virus to beet crops. ==Uses and consumption== ===Food=== Rice and Chenopodium album leaf curry with onions and potatoes The leaves and young shoots may be eaten as a leaf vegetable, either steamed in its entirety, or cooked like spinach, but should be eaten in moderation due to high levels of oxalic acid. Each plant produces tens of thousands of black seeds. These are high in protein, vitamin A, calcium, phosphorus, and potassium. Quinoa, a closely related species, is grown specifically for its seeds.PROTAbase: Chenopodium album The Zuni people cook the young plants' greens.Castetter, Edward F. 1935 Ethnobiological Studies in the American Southwest I. Uncultivated Native Plants Used as Sources of Food. University of New Mexico Bulletin 4(1):1-44 (p. 16) Bathua seeds also double up for rice and dal. Napoleon Bonaparte is said to have once relied on bathua seeds to feed his troops during lean times. Archaeologists analysing carbonized plant remains found in storage pits and ovens at Iron Age, Viking Age, and Roman sites in Europe have found its seeds mixed with conventional grains and even inside the stomachs of Danish bog bodies. In India, the plant is called bathua and found abundantly in the winter season. The leaves and young shoots of this plant are used in dishes such as soups, curries, and paratha-stuffed breads, common in North India. The seeds or grains are used in phambra or laafi, gruel-type dishes in Himachal Pradesh, and in mildly alcoholic fermented beverages such as soora and ghanti.The himalayan grain chenopods. I. Distribution and ethnobotany In Haryana state, the \"bathue ka raita\" i.e. the raita (yogurt dip) made with bathua, is very popular in winters.Bathua ka Raita | Haryana bathua recipe | Indian cuisine, masterchefu.com. ===Animal feed=== As some of the common names suggest, it is also used as feed (both the leaves and the seeds) for chickens and other poultry. ===Construction=== The juice of this plant is a potent ingredient for a mixture of wall plaster, according to the Samar\u0101\u1e45ga\u1e47a S\u016btradh\u0101ra, which is a Sanskrit treatise dealing with \u015ailpa\u015b\u0101stra (Hindu science of art and construction). ===Ayurveda=== In Ayurveda traditional medicine, bathua is thought to be useful for treating various diseases,L. D. Kapoor, 1989, CRC Handbook of Ayurvedic Medicinal Plants, CRC Press, Boston, pp. 113. although there is no clinical evidence such uses are safe or effective. ==Gallery== File:Melganzenvoet bloemen Chenopodium album.jpg|Close-up of flower and flower bud File:6H-Lambs-quarter.jpg|Young Chenopodium album File:Lamb's Quarter.jpeg|Domestic Lamb's Quarter - Cecil County, MD - November 2015 ==References== Footnotes Citations ==External links== * * album Category:Edible nuts and seeds Category:Flora of Nepal Category:Leaf vegetables Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Plants used in Native American cuisine Category:Plants used in traditional African medicine Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
