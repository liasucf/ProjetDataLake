He has won the Icelandic championship with KR three times in a row from 2017 to 2019. ==Early years== Krist\u00f3fer was born on 13 October 1993 to Edna Mar\u00eda Jakobsen, who is half Icelandic and half Faroese, and Terry Acox, an American basketball player who played professionally in Iceland with K\u00f6rfuknattleiksf\u00e9lag \u00cdA. He grew up with his mother and grandmother. Krist\u00f3fer played football in his youth for nine years but turned fully to basketball at the age of fourteen after being selected to the Icelandic U-15 national basketball team. ==Playing career== Krist\u00f3fer played for four years at Furman University. After finishing his college season in April 2017, he joined KR where he won the national championship. He played for the Star Hotshots of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) from September to October 2017 when he returned to KR. On 28 April 2018, Krist\u00f3fer won his second consecutive national championship with KR after beating Tindast\u00f3ll 3-1 in the \u00darvalsdeild Finals where he was also named the \u00darvalsdeild Playoffs MVP. After the season he was named both the \u00darvalsdeild Karla Domestic Player of the Year and the \u00darvalsdeild Karla Defensive Player of the Year, and to the \u00darvalsdeild Karla Domestic All-First Team. On 12 June 2018, Krist\u00f3fer signed a two-year contract extension with KR with the option to leave if he received an offer from a bigger club. On 28 June, he exercised that option and signed with Denain Voltaire of the French LNB Pro B. After struggling with ankle injuries and unhappiness with living in a mostly non-english speaking city, he reached an agreement with the club to be released from contract in middle of November that year. Shortly later he signed back with KR for the rest of the season. On 4 May 2019 he won his third national championship in a row with KR. After the season he was named the Domestic Player of the Year for the second year in a row. In December 2019, Krist\u00f3fer was hospitalised due to an kidney infection. On 7 September 2020, Krist\u00f3fer announced that he was leaving KR due to an disagreement between him and the club. Four days later, he signed with Reykjav\u00edk rivals Valur. On 24 September, it was reported that KR was refusing to sign Krist\u00f3fer's transfer papers to Valur despite reportedly owing him millions ISK in unpaid salaries. In turn, P\u00e1ll Kolbeinsson, a board member of KR's basketball department, stated that the board believed that it did not owe Krist\u00f3fer any unpaid salary. He further claimed that board believed that he had hid the extent of his injuries before signing a contract extension in 2019 although evidence did show that both the then head coach Ingi \u00de\u00f3r Stein\u00fe\u00f3rsson and KR's physiotherapist where aware of them. On 30 September, KR signed Krist\u00f3fer's transfer papers, officially making him a Valur player. ==Awards and accomplishments== ===Club honours=== *Icelandic Champion (3): 2017, 2018, 2019 ===Individual awards=== *\u00darvalsdeild Domestic Player of the Year : 2018, 2019 *\u00darvalsdeild Domestic All-First team : 2018, 2019 *\u00darvalsdeild Playoffs MVP : 2018 *\u00darvalsdeild Defensive Player of the Year: 2018 ==References== ==External links== *Kristofer Acox at basketball.realgm.com *Kristofer Acox at eurobasket.com *Krist\u00f3fer Acox at pba.ph Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Denain Voltaire Basket players Category:Expatriate basketball people in the Philippines Category:Furman Paladins men's basketball players Category:Icelandic expatriate basketball people in the United States Kristofer Acox Kristofer Acox Kristofer Acox Kristofer Acox Kristofer Acox Category:Philippine Basketball Association imports Category:Power forwards (basketball) Kristofer Acox Category:Magnolia Hotshots players Kristofer Acox Kristofer Acox ",
