Chicago: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc., 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 624. was a general of the Northern and Southern Courts period (1337\u201392) of Japanese history and a close associate of his elder brother Takauji, the first Muromachi sh\u014dgun. Son of Ashikaga Sadauji and Uesugi Kiyoko, daughter of Uesugi Yorishige, the same mother as Takauji, he was a pivotal figure of the chaotic transition period between the Kamakura and Muromachi shogunates.Yasuda (1990:22) Tadayoshi is today considered a military and administrative genius and the true architect of many of his elder brother's successes.Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online accessed on August 11, 2009 In contemporary chronicles he is rarely called with his name, but is instead called either or from the name of his family temple.Sansom (1977:87) His posthumous name was .(Kan (1980:123) ==Biography== The Ashikaga were a samurai family from Kamakura having blood ties with the Seiwa Genji, Minamoto no Yoritomo's clan. Unlike his brother Takauji, Tadayoshi took no part in the Kamakura shogunate's political activities until the Genk\u014d War (1331\u20131333), a civil war whose conclusion (the Siege of Kamakura (1333) marks the end of the Kamakura period and the beginning of the most turbulent period in Japan's history, the Muromachi era. Like his brother, Tadayoshi resolutely abandoned the Kamakura shogunate to ally himself with Emperor Go-Daigo during the Kenmu Restoration of 1333. When Go-Daigo had ascended to the throne in 1318, he had immediately manifested his intention to rule without interference from the military in Kamakura.Sansom (2000:23\u201342) The samurai class as a whole however was not ready to give away power, so the alliance between him and the Ashikaga was bound to be only temporary. Go-Daigo wanted to re-establish his rule in Kamakura and the east of the country without sending there a sh\u014dgun, as this was seen, just a year from the fall of its shogunate, as still too dangerous. As a compromise, he sent his six-year-old son Prince Norinaga to Mutsu Province and nominated him Governor-General of the Mutsu and Dewa Provinces. In an obvious reply to this move, Tadayoshi, without an order from the Emperor escorted another of his sons, eleven-year-old Prince Nariyoshi (a.k.a. Narinaga) to Kamakura, where he installed him as governor of the K\u014dzuke Province with himself as a deputy and de facto ruler. The appointment of a warrior to such an important post was intended to show the Emperor that the samurai class was not ready for a purely civilian rule. Since he ruled without interference from Kyoto and the area in itself was in effect a miniature shogunate, this event can be considered the beginning of the Ashikaga shogunate. In 1335, during the Nakasendai Rebellion led by H\u014dj\u014d Tokiyuki Tadayoshi, being unable to defend the city, had to leave Kamakura in a rush. Not being in the position to take along another son of Go-Daigo's, Prince Morinaga, whom he had kept as a hostage for several months, rather than letting him go he decided to have him beheaded. In Dec. 1335, Tadayoshi was defeated by imperial forces under the command of Nitta Yoshisada forcing his retreat to the Hakone mountains. However, with the aid of his brother Takauji, they were able to defeat Yoshisada at the battles of Sanoyama and Mishima. The brothers were then free to advance upon Kyoto. Their occupation of Kyoto was short lived however, as forces loyal to Go-Daigo forced the brothers to flee west. In April 1336, Ashikaga Tadayoshi, \"drove the enemy before him\" helping his brother defeat the Kikuchi clan, allies of Go-Daigo. This Battle of Tatarahama (1336) occurred in Hakata Bay. The victory enabled Takauji to become master of Kyushu. By May, Takauji was able to advance with a flotilla, reaching the environs of present-day Kobe in July. Tadayoshi followed in parallel with a land force. Turning against Go-Daigo, Tadayoshi and Takauji set up a rival emperor in 1336 after defeating the Loyalists in the Battle of Minatogawa. Their Muromachi shogunate was founded in 1338. Dividing power between them, Takauji took charge of military affairs and Tadayoshi of judicial and administrative matters. Both Tadayoshi and Takauji were disciples of famous Zen master, intellectual and garden designer Mus\u014d Soseki, under which guidance the first would later become a Buddhist monk. It was partly because of Soseki's influence that the pre-existing Five Mountain System network of Zen temples was expanded and strengthened, first with the establishment of the Jissetsu, and later with that of the Ankoku-ji temple sub-networks. The creation of both systems is generally attributed wholly to Tadayoshi. It was also Soseki which famously wrote about the two brothers, describing Takauji as more apt to military pursuits, and Tadayoshi to government. ===The Kann\u014d disturbance and Tadayoshi's death=== Ashikaga Takauji was the formally-appointed shogun but, having proved incapable of ruling the country, for more than ten years Tadayoshi had governed in his stead. The relationship between the two brothers was however destined to be destroyed by the Kann\u014d disturbance, an event which takes its name from the Kann\u014d era (1350\u20131351) during which it took place, and which had very serious consequences for the entire country. Trouble between the two started when Takauji made K\u014d no Moronao his deputy sh\u014dgun. According to the Taiheiki, Tadayoshi didn't like Moronao and, every other effort to get rid of him having failed, tried to have him assassinated. According to the same source, his plot was discovered and he was therefore removed from the government. In any event, Tadayoshi in 1350 was forced by Moronao to leave the government, and take the tonsure under the monastic name Keishin.Papinot (1972:29) In 1351 Tadayoshi rebelled and joined his brother's enemies, the Southern court, whose emperor, Go-Murakami appointed him general of all his troops. In 1351 he defeated Takauji, occupied Kyoto, and entered Kamakura. During the same year his forces killed Moronao and his brother Moroyasu at Mikage (Settsu Province). The following year Tadayoshi's fortunes turned and he was defeated by Takauji at Sattayama. A reconciliation between the brothers proved to be brief; Tadayoshi was sandwiched by two of Takauji's armies and fled to the hills of Izu in 1352. Shortly after an ostensible second reconciliation, Tadayoshi was captured and confined in the Kamakura Jomyoji monastery, where he died suddenly in March. According to the Taiheiki, by poisoning. Ashikaga Tadayoshi was buried at , a Buddhist temple which no longer exists, but whose ruins are now near J\u014dmy\u014d-ji in Kamakura.Kamiya Vol. 1 (2008:110) The temple was founded on the grounds of Tadayoshi's former Kamakura residence, according to J\u014dmy\u014d- ji's own records by Tadayoshi himself.(Kan (1980:123) According to the , the diary of priest Gid\u014d Sh\u016bshin, in 1372 on the day of Tadayoshi's death Kamakura's Kub\u014d Ashikaga Ujimitsu visited Daiky\u016b-ji. The date of disappearance of the temple is unknown. He also adopted Ashikaga Tadafuyu, one of Takauji's sons, as his own. ==Family== * Father: Ashikaga Sadauji (1273\u20131331) * Mother: Uesugi Kiyoko (1270\u20131343) * Wife: Shibukawa Yoriko later Honkoin * Son: Ashikaga Nishimaru (1347\u20131351) * Adopted son: Ashikaga Tadafuyu (1327\u20131387) ==See also== *Ashikaga Takauji *Kenmu Restoration *Kamakura \u2013 The Muromachi and Edo periods *Nanboku-ch\u014d period ==Notes== == References == * * * Papinot, E.
