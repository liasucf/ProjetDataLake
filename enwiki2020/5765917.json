    "text": "The 1985 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 1984\u201385 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeating the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was named NBA Finals MVP for the second time (he had won the award under his birth name, Lew Alcindor, as a Buck in 1971). The Lakers had been unsuccessful in their previous eight attempts to defeat the Celtics in the NBA Finals, losing 7 times from 1959\u20131969 and 1984. The Lakers, moreover, won the title in Boston, something no other NBA team has ever accomplished. The Cavaliers made the playoffs for the first time since 1978. It was also the first time that all three teams from Texas made the playoffs in the same year. The Denver Nuggets advanced to the conference finals for the first time since 1978 and would not advance that far again until 2009. The Philadelphia 76ers, on the other hand, advanced to the conference finals for the fifth time in six years, but would not reach that level again until 2001. It was also the first time that Turner Broadcasting was covering the playoffs as TBS was the home for some playoff games. Games 3 and 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals at the Spectrum forced a Phil Collins concert at the arena to be rescheduled to the fall of 1985, as noted by Charlie Van Dyke when he sub-hosted an episode of American Top 40 on July 6 of that year. ==Bracket== ==Western Conference== Champion: Los Angeles Lakers 1st Round (1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (8) Phoenix Suns: Lakers win series 3-0 *Game 1 @ The Forum, Los Angeles (April 18): Los Angeles 142, Phoenix 114 *Game 2 @ The Forum, Los Angeles (April 20): Los Angeles 147, Phoenix 130 *Game 3 @ Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, Phoenix (April 23): Los Angeles 119, Phoenix 103 {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" |+Regular-season series |- !Los Angeles won 5\u20131 in the regular- season series |- | |} This was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning the first four meetings. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" |+Previous playoff series |- !Los Angeles leads 4\u20130 in all-time playoff series |- | |} (2) Denver Nuggets vs. (7) San Antonio Spurs: Nuggets win series 3-2 *Game 1 @ McNichols Sports Arena, Denver (April 18): Denver 141, San Antonio 111 *Game 2 @ McNichols Sports Arena, Denver (April 20): San Antonio 113, Denver 111 *Game 3 @ HemisFair Arena, San Antonio (April 23): Denver 115, San Antonio 112 *Game 4 @ HemisFair Arena, San Antonio (April 26): San Antonio 116, Denver 111 *Game 5 @ McNichols Sports Arena, Denver (April 28): Denver 126, San Antonio 99 {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" |+Regular-season series |- !Tied 3\u20133 in the regular-season series |- | |} This was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning the first meeting. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" |+Previous playoff series |- !San Antonio leads 1\u20130 in all-time playoff series |- | |} (3) Houston Rockets vs. (6) Utah Jazz: Jazz win series 3-2 *Game 1 @ The Summit, Houston (April 19): Utah 115, Houston 101 *Game 2 @ The Summit, Houston (April 21): Houston 122, Utah 96 *Game 3 @ Salt Palace Acord Arena, Salt Lake City (April 24): Utah 112, Houston 104 *Game 4 @ Salt Palace Acord Arena, Salt Lake City (April 26): Houston 96, Utah 94 *Game 5 @ The Summit, Houston (April 28): Utah 104, Houston 97 {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" |+Regular-season series |- !Tied 3\u20133 in the regular-season series |- | |} This was the first playoff meeting between the Rockets and the Jazz.
