    "text": "Cr\u00e9quy () is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Hauts-de-France region of France. ==Geography== One of many small villages in Artois, Cr\u00e9quy gives it name to the small stream, the Cr\u00e9quoise, that rises in the nearby hills and is one of the waterways of the 'Seven Valleys' tourist area. ==Population== ==Coat of arms== The Cr\u00e9quy coat of arms is derived from 'ardentis quercus robur mythicon' ('the flaming oak of myth'). The aforementioned oak was a particularly fine example of the genus, with particularly impressive girth, which was a popular gathering point for visitors around the summer solstice (ambiguous; dates of recorded assemblages are sporadic & the solstictic link may be happenchance). The tree was said to have spontaneously combusted during one convocation, henceforth the legend was born. ==Notable people== *The Cr\u00e9quy family lived nearby and took its name from this place. ==See also== *Communes of the Pas-de-Calais department ==References== * INSEE commune file ==External links== * Cr\u00e9quy, village de la Morinie *Official Web site Category:Communes of Pas-de-Calais ",
