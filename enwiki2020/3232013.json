    "text": "The Models (credited also as Models) was a short-lived punk band formed in Harrow, London, England. It consisted of Cliff Fox on vocals and guitar, Marco Pirroni on guitar, Mick Allen on bass and Terry Day on drums. Pirroni and Allen became friends while attending art school in Harrow. When punk emerged in 1976, they first formed Siouxsie and the Banshees, playing guitar, although for only a brief time. Shortly after that, he and Allen formed a band called The Beastly Cads, who later changed their name to The Models. The band only released one single \"Freeze\" and recorded four songs for a Peel Session before dissolving. Later, Pirroni and Allen formed Rema-Rema, a post-punk band. Pirroni later re-teamed up with Terry Day, who since then was named Terry Lee Miall, in Adam and the Ants, beginning to work alongside that band's singer and frontman, Adam Ant. Allen went on to other projects, the longest running being The Wolfgang Press on the influential British record label 4AD. After the demise of the band he paired up with Giuseppe De Bellis, to form the experimental project Geniuser. ==References== ==External links== *PUNK77: The Models *MySpace: Terry Lee Miall (formerly Terry Day) (official) *Terry Lee Miall (formerly Terry Day) interview Category:English punk rock groups ",
