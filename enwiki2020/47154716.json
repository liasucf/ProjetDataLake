W. of The New York Times said, \"Whatever may be one's opinion about Ladies Man, it cannot be said that Eddie Bracken, its star, is miscast. For this singularly simple little item from Paramount, which began a stand at the Gotham on Saturday, makes full use of Mr. Bracken's cherubic appearance. As a bumpkin from Badger, Okla., who suddenly becomes an oil millionaire and comes to New York for the inevitable fling, Mr. Bracken is to the manner born. He is a reluctant Romeo\u2014shy, gullible and frustrated. But the ensuing yarn about his involvements with a radio program and several predatory females, is corn from the bottom of the crib. The chuckles in this comedy are widely spaced and hardly keep pace with its tedium.\" == References == == External links == * Category:1947 films Category:1947 comedy films Category:American films Category:American black- and-white films Category:American comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by William D.
