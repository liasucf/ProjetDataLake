The competitors left Carson in the morning and flew into San Jose, California, in order to participate in the first three events. Unfortunately, on the return trip that evening, Southwest Airlines suffered a technical glitch grounding several flights and creating many delays.http://abc7news.com/travel/southwest-flights-resume-after-technical- issue/1435266/ Some athletes reported that they did not return to their Carson hotel until after midnight Thursday morning. ====Events 1 and 2: Ranch Trail Run to Ranch Deadlift Ladder==== * 7 kilometer trail run Followed by: *Deadlift ladder Event 1 was a seven kilometer run was based around a similar event in the 2009 CrossFit Games. Mat Fraser and Samantha Briggs were the winners of this event. The second event was a deadlift ladder where the competitors had to lift in reverse order of finish in the previous event. The start of Event 2 had the last place finisher start the event first, ten minutes after completing the run. The men's weight started at 425 pounds and ended at 615 pounds while the women's weight started at 275 pounds and ended at 415 pounds. Sam Dancer (the last place finisher on the run) and Brooke Wells (who took 37th of 40 on the run) both won the event by completing the ladder. ====Event 3: Ranch Mini Chipper==== *50 wall ball shots *25 medicine ball GHD sit-ups *Hill sprint with medicine ball The last event was a \"chipper,\" a workout involving multiple exercises done sequentially without returning (as in \"chipping away\" at the number of repetitions) for the fastest time. The competitors started with 50 wall ball shots, a squat into tossing a medicine ball 9 or 10 feet up to target on a wall. Once completed, they performed 25 sit-ups with the medicine ball on a glute-hamstring developer (GHD), a piece of equipment where the feet lock in and the sit-up is performed at a greater range of motion. The chipper was finished with a hill sprint while carrying the medicine ball. The men used a 30-pound medicine ball and the women used a 20-pound medicine ball. Brent Fikowski and Annie Thorisdottir won the event. === Thursday, July 21, 2016 === ==== Event 4: Ocean Swim ==== *500 meter ocean swim The only event of day two was an out-and-back ocean swim at Redondo Beach, California.

Murphy, who was killed in Afghanistan on July 28, 2005. \"Murph\" is probably CrossFit's most famous \"Hero\" workout (a specific routine named in honor of a fallen hero) and Murph is usually performed by American affiliates on Memorial Day. The announcement of this event was controversial because it was also done in the 2015 CrossFit Games where a number of athletes suffered serious heat injuries. The weighted vests were 20lbs. for men and 14lbs. for the women. The exercises between the runs was broken up into five rounds of 20 pull-ups, 40 push-ups, and 60 air squats.

On the return, the athletes then had to climb up a rope in the middle of the field. The rope was situated so that the bottom of the rope was above the heads of the athletes so that they had to jump up to grab the rope and do the first pulls without using their legs. The final movement was pushing what was called a \"snail,\" a large heavy barrel that had to be rolled for 40 feet.

The Facebook post announcing the decision attracted more than 4,000 comments, with many members drawing attention to the recent spate of mass shootings in the US. One Facebook user wrote \"As a reward for fitness you can potentially shoot people?...After the worst mass shootings in USA, I hardly feel bringing a community together via guns is in the spirit of Crossfit. Shameful.\" Title sponsor Reebok said in a statement: \"While we understand CrossFit\u2019s foundations are tied to military and first responders, we do not agree with this decision, particularly in light of current events in the United States.\" A Change.org petition gathered more than 19,000 signatures against the partnership with Glock. In response to the criticism, director of the games, Dave Castro said, \u201cI am one of millions of people in the U.S. who own guns for recreational and legal purposes. I compete in competitive shooting events, and I have a lot of friends in the shooting industry. Glock offered up pistols as prizes, I agreed to it.\u201d Castro later added, \u201cUnless the state and federal laws regarding gun ownership in California and the U.S. change in the next week, then no, nothing is changing.\u201d ==See also== *CrossFit ==References== Category:International sports competitions hosted by the United States CrossFit Games Category:CrossFit ",
