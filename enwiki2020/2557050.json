McCarty accuses Ballard of having murdered his brother and has come to arrest him. At first, the townspeople are on Ballard's side, but gradually they turn against him, especially when they believe that he has killed the town sheriff (Emile Meyer). Ballard tries to prove his innocence and expose McCarty (who appears to be a veiled reference to Senator Joseph McCarthy). == Cast == * John Payne as Dan Ballard * Lizabeth Scott as Rose Evans * Dan Duryea as Fred McCarty * Dolores Moran as Dolly * Emile Meyer as Sheriff Wooley * Robert Warwick as Judge Cranston * John Hudson as Michael 'Mitch' Evans * Harry Carey Jr. as Johnson * Alan Hale Jr. as Kirk * Stuart Whitman as Wickers * Frank Sully as Paul Herbert, Telegrapher * Morris Ankrum as Zachary Evans * Hugh Sanders as Reverend Field * Florence Auer as Mrs. Elmwood * Roy Gordon as Dr. Elmwood == References == ==External links== * * *The film's entry at \"McCarthyism and the Movies\" Category:1954 films Category:1954 Western (genre) films Category:American films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:English-language films Category:Films about McCarthyism Category:Films directed by Allan Dwan Category:Independence Day (United States) films Category:RKO Pictures films Category:Revisionist Western ",
