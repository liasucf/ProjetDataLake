    "text": "Cherry Chevapravatdumrong (; ; ; born 1977), also known as Cherry Cheva, is an American author, an executive producer of Family Guy and a co-executive producer of The Orville. ==Personal life== Chevapravatdumrong, a Thai American, was born in Columbus, Ohio, and raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, graduating from Huron High School in 1995. She majored in psychology at Yale University, where she wrote for The Yale Record, Yale's humor magazine.The Yale Record. New Haven: Yale Record. December, 1995. p. 3. She later earned a Juris Doctor degree from New York University Law School, where she wrote for the comedic Law Revue. During law school, she spent her summers working at law firms and her winter breaks waiting tables at her parents' restaurant. She then moved to Los Angeles to pursue writing. Before working on Family Guy, she was a writer's assistant on Listen Up! ==The Orville== * \"Firestorm\" (Season 1, Episode 10) The Orville * \"Home\" (Season 2, Episode 3) * \"Sanctuary\" (Season 2, Episode 12) ==Family Guy== She is now the only female writer on Family Guy (a fact mentioned in the episode \"Roasted Guy\"), and also a co- executive producer. She released two young adult novels, She's So Money and DupliKate, under the name Cherry Cheva. Her last name was used in its entirety in the episode \"And I'm Joyce Kinney\" as the real last name of Joyce Kinney. In the episode \"Jesus, Mary and Joseph!\", Peter breaks the fourth wall by rearranging the letters of her name in the opening credits to say \"Chemotherapy vanguard vCr\" (with one \"r\" left over, which he throws at Lois when she points this out). In the episode \"Dead Dog Walking\", Peter again breaks the fourth wall by saying that her address is 11700 Hollywood Way, North Hollywood, CA 91065, and that she's also a lawyer. If looked at, this address is actually an Italian-American restaurant called The Ramp. In the episode \"No Giggity, No Doubt\", Peter lists her name among examples of people (mainly other Family Guy characters, increasing in obscurity) who should go on an excursion with Meg: \"Cherry Chevapravatdumrong, that's how that name is pronounced.\" ===Episodes=== As writer: * \"Sibling Rivalry\" (2006) * \"Saving Private Brian\" (2006) * \"Prick Up Your Ears\" (2006) * \"Boys Do Cry\" (2007) * \"Ocean's Three and a Half\" (2009) * \"We Love You, Conrad\" (2009) * \"Hannah Banana\" (2009) * \"And Then There Were Fewer\" (2010) * \"It's a Trap!\" (2011) * \"The Blind Side\" (2012) * \"Friends Without Benefits\" (2012) * \"Quagmire's Quagmire\" (2013) * \"Turkey Guys\" (2014) * \"Candy, Quahog Marshmallow\" (2016) * \"Gronkowsbees\" (2017) * \"Dog Bites Bear\" (2018) * \"Throw It Away\" (2019) * \"Holly Bibble\" (2020) As executive story editor: * \"Chick Cancer\" (2006) * \"Barely Legal\" (2006) * \"The Tan Aquatic with Steve Zissou\" (2007) * \"Airport '07\" (2007) * \"Bill & Peter's Bogus Journey\" (2007) * \"No Meals on Wheels\" (2007) * \"McStroke\" (2008) As story editor: * \"You May Now Kiss the...
