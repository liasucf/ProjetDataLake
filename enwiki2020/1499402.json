Graduating from the University of Alberta in 1969 with a Bachelor of Arts (Hons) and the Governor General\u2019s Gold Medal, Pannekoek went on to get his Master of Arts from the same institution. This was followed by a doctorate in 1974 from Queen's University with a dissertation on Western Canadian history and Indigenous people. From 2008 to 2012 he served as President of the International Council for Open and Distance EducationLetter from the ICDE President - ICDE , and in 2014 was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of South Africa for his service to open and distance learning. In 2015 he was inducted into the Alberta Order of Excellence for community service, his work in heritage preservation and in distance learning. As President of Athabasca University, he undertook several key projects for which he had secured funds starting in 2007. In August 2011, the Premier opened the 53,800 sq. foot Academic Research Centre funded by a 2007 $30 million grant from Alberta\u2019s Ministry of Advanced Education and Technology.Athabasca Advocate, August 2, 2011. It was the first major new building on campus since the main building had been built decades earlier. That same year the University completed a two-year $7.65 million project to modernize its learning management systems, and an $8.45 million project to double the size of its science labs. Both were funded by the Government of Canada\u2019s Knowledge Infrastructure Program, the Province of Alberta and internals sources.Open Fall/Winter, A Magazine for the Athabasca University community, 2011, p. 6 https://www.athabascau.ca/aboutau/media/publications/ Retrieved 8 July, 2020.

In 2012, two of Athabasca University's three unions representing university faculty and staff passed a vote of non- confidence in Pannekoek, following a scandal in which the university was found to have made illegal political donations. Pannekoek was also criticized for depleting the university's $30 million reserve fund between 2007 and 2011. He continues to work with Indigenous postsecondary institutions and organization, and with several colleagues and institutions on new ways of online learning, particularly MOOCs. == See also == * List of Canadian university leaders == References == Category:1947 births Category:Canadian historians Category:Canadian male non-fiction writers Category:Canadian university and college chief executives Category:Dutch emigrants to Canada Category:Living people Category:Members of the Alberta Order of Excellence Category:Presidents of Athabasca University Category:Queen's University at Kingston alumni Category:University of Alberta alumni ",
