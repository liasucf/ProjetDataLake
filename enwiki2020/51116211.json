Like the previous two editions, the 2017 Supercopa MX was contested in a single-leg format at a neutral venue in the United States. This match took place at the StubHub Center in Carson, California for the second straight year. The match is normally contested by the winners of the Apertura and Clausura editions of the Copa MX. However Guadalajara, winners of the Clausura 2017, also won the Clausura 2017 Liga MX, and thus qualified for the 2017 Campe\u00f3n de Campeones.http://espndeportes.espn.com/futbol/mexico/nota/_/id/3285642/chivas- y-tigres-disputaran-campeon-de-campeones Since Guadalajara were also the Supercopa MX title holders, they were replaced by Am\u00e9rica, who were the team that accumulated the most aggregate points in the previous two editions of Copa MX that was not already playing in either the Campe\u00f3n de Campeones or Supercopa MX. The 2017 Supercopa MX was part of a doubleheader, which also includes the 2017 Campe\u00f3n de Campeones, organized by Univision Deportes, Soccer United Marketing (SUM), Liga MX and LA Galaxy. ==Match details== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| width=100% |valign=top width=50%| {| style=\"font- size:90%\" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 align=center |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK || 30 || Tiago Volpi |- |DF || 18 || Luis Esqueda |- |DF || 3 || Miguel \u00c1ngel Mart\u00ednez (c) |- |DF || 27 || Hiram Mier |- |DF || 8 || Aldo Arellano || |- |MF || 14 || Luis Miguel Noriega |||| |- |MF || 28 || Jaime G\u00f3mez |- |MF || 26 || Erb\u00edn Trejo |||| |- |FW || 17 || Paolo Yrizar || || |- |FW || 19 || Yerson Candelo |- |FW || 30 || Emanuel Villa || |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- |GK || 33 || Gil Alcal\u00e1 |- |DF || 5 || V\u00edctor Milke |- |DF || 12 || Jonathan Bornstein |- |MF || 21 || Marco Jim\u00e9nez|||| |- |FW || 7 || Camilo |- |FW|| 10 || \u00c9dgar Gerardo Lugo|||| |- |FW || 23 || \u00c9dgar Ben\u00edtez |||| |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4| Jaime Lozano |} |valign=top| |valign=top width=50%| {| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 align=center |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK || 1 || Agust\u00edn Marches\u00edn |- |DF || 6 || Miguel Samudio|| |- |DF || 2 || Carlos Vargas |- |DF|| 18 || Bruno Valdez || |- |DF|| 22 || Paul Aguilar |- |MF || 34 || Diego Lainez |||| |- |MF || 7 || William |- |MF || 5 || Guido Rodr\u00edguez |- |MF || 30 || Renato Ibarra|||| |- |FW || 9 || Silvio Romero|||| |- |FW|| 24 || Oribe Peralta (c) |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- |GK || 27 || \u00d3scar Jim\u00e9nez |- |DF || 32 || Ernesto Cedillo |- |DF|| 300 || Ulises Torres |- |MF || 16 || Carlos Orrant\u00eda|||| |- |MF|| 20 || Manuel P\u00e9rez |- |FW || 19 || Alejandro D\u00edaz|||| |- |FW|| 31 || Darwin Quintero|||| |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4| Miguel Herrera |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size:90%\" | Assistant referees: Mario Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez (Durango) Pablo Israel Hern\u00e1ndez (Mexico City) Fourth official: Jorge Antonio P\u00e9rez (Veracruz) |} ==See also== *Apertura 2016 Copa MX *Clausura 2017 Copa MX ==References== 2017 Category:2017\u201318 in Mexican football ",
