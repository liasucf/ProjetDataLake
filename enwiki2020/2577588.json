The artificial island is being built up by pumping sand from the sea floor, in order to meet the existing and future housing, industrial and commercial development demands of the Mal\u00e9 region. The official settlement was inaugurated by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom on May 12, 2004. The development and management of the island is undertaken by a government- owned corporation called Housing Development Corporation (formerly Hulhumal\u00e9 Development Unit/Hulhumal\u00e9 Development Corporation) which was incorporated on March 23, 2005. Land reclamation has increased the island's area to , making it the fourth largest island in the Maldives. the island has a population of more than 50,000; it is planned to house as many as 240,000 by the mid-2020s. == Location within Mal\u00e9 City == Hulhulmal\u00e9 is located northeast of the airport island of Hulhul\u00e9, to which it is connected by a causeway: ==History== Reclamation of Hulhumal\u00e9 began on October 16, 1997 on the Hulhul\u00e9- Farukolhufushi lagoon off the north west coast of Mal\u00e9. Initial reclamation (or Phase I) consisting of 45% of land mass, , was carried out by the Ministry of Construction and Public Works (MCPW) at a cost of USD 11 million. The project was then continued by a Belgian Joint Venture Company, International Port Engineering and Management (IPEM) and Dredging International (DI) costing an estimated USD 21 million. All the works involving reclamation and coastal structure development covered in Phase I were completed by June 2002, and 1,000 residents moved to the island in 2004. In the next phase of reclamation, completed in 2015, were added, and by the end of 2019, there were more than 50,000 residents. ==Development== Hulhumal\u00e9 Road A basis of development known as Phase I was formed under the first Master Plan which was completed in July 2001 by a consortium of consultants from Singapore with the contribution of many government agencies, committees and individuals. It conceptually defines the long-term land use and development strategy (including urban design proposals, transportation plans and utility infrastructure) with considerations for future infrastructure connections to the adjacent Phase II and planned airport extension areas. The Master Plan is to be periodically reviewed and adjusted to include advances in development. Phase I of the Master Plan includes: Hulhumal\u00e9 Hospital Stage 1A (completed) * A 280-room apartment complex with a combination of 2,3 and 4 bedroom units * An integrated primary and secondary school housing 20 classrooms * A public building for government and social requirements containing 32 units * A hospital with 50 bed capacity * A mosque for 1500 people * Four commercial buildings with a total of 48 units * An asphalt-paved road network approximately long * An adequate land space for the cultivation of indigenous plants and imported varieties Stage 1B (to be completed by December 2005) * 232 condominium housing units * 120 basic housing units * 169 beach plots * 56 standard plots * 132 terraced houses * 280 housing units * 57 residential beach front plots * 109 residential beach plots * 56 residential standard plots * 132 plots for terraced housing * A public building with 32 public units * 15 industrial and commercial land plots with an average of per unit Stage 1C (planned for 2006) * 1900 housing units Stage 2 (targeted for 2016) * 2950 housing units Stage 3 (targeted for 2020) * 3075 housing units Hulhumal\u00e9 is underutilized relative to other central atolls in the Maldives. It would take the lead of the government to improve utilization by moving government ministers, government departments and public institutions to Hulhumal\u00e9 and assisting public servants with relocation costs. Pending urban development, greenery landscaping would help make the place more attractive. On 15 January 2015 the second reclamation phase of Hulhumal\u00e9 was launched, which will include the construction of a youth centre. == Transport == Hulhumal\u00e9 has road network which was planned together with the development of the island. The network covers the entire island and support all types of road vehicles. The island is connected via a causeway to the airport island Hulhul\u00e9 Island, allowing road transport to easily travel between the Velana International Airport and Hulhumal\u00e9. With the opening of the Sinamal\u00e9 Bridge between Hulhul\u00e9 and Mal\u00e9 Island in September 2018, the road networks of the three islands were connected for the first time. ==External links== * Housing Development Corporation * NPR Morning Edition story, 28 Jan 2008 ==References== Category:Islands of the Maldives Category:Populated coastal places in the Maldives Category:Artificial islands of the Maldives Category:Populated places in the Maldives ",
