    "text": "The Realme C3 (styled as realme C3) is a slate-format Android smartphone developed by Realme and released in February 2020 in India and March 2020 in the Philippines. Priced just under $120 and running Android 10, Realme positions it as a budget gaming handset capable of playing PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds and Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, and is the first device to ship with the MediaTek Helio G70 system-on-chip. ==Features== ===Hardware=== Several variants of the phone were released, with different internal storage capacity, RAM, cameras and NFC support depending on the country. The Indian- market variant only comes with two rear cameras and omits the fingerprint sensor, while the international version is equipped with three rear cameras and a fingerprint sensor. Realme later went on to release the Narzo 10A in India, which is essentially the same device as the international C3 variant apart from a redesigned back cover. The Australian-market release is almost identical to the international variants with the addition of an NFC sensor for wireless payments. The C3 also comes with a 3.5mm headset jack, a Micro-USB charging port, a 5000mAh lithium-ion battery with reverse-charging support, allowing the phone to double as a power bank, as well as a dual Nano-SIM and MicroSD card tray. The C3 was initially sold in two colour variants: Frozen Blue and Blazing red; a third colour option named Volcano Grey was later released. The Indian-market Narzo 10A also came in two variants, namely So White and So Blue. Both omit the sunburst design in favour of a glossy back cover with the Realme logo prominently displayed in large type. ===Software=== The phone runs on the Android 10 operating system overlaid with Realme's proprietary Realme UI 1.0 interface. ==Reception== The C3 was released to mostly positive reception, with reviewers praising the phone's value proposition and specifications. While John Nieves of Unbox.ph did criticise the phone's lack of a USB-C port, slow charge times and camera quality, he otherwise remarked the phone's design and performance for its price point, with system-intensive games such as Call of Duty: Mobile and Asphalt 8: Airborne running at decent frame rates. Fergus Halliday of PC World Australia was less than enthusiastic however, expressing criticism towards the C3's camera, onboard storage and overall performance. == References == ==External links== * Official website (India) *Official website (Philippines) *Official website (Europe) Category:Android (operating system) devices Category:Smartphones Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2020 Category:Phones with multiple rear cameras ",
