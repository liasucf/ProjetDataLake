    "text": "Klang or Kelang, officially Royal Town of Klang (), is a royal town and former capital of the state of Selangor, Malaysia. It is located within the Klang District. It was the civil capital of Selangor in an earlier era prior to the emergence of Kuala Lumpur and the current capital, Shah Alam. Port Klang, which is located in the Klang District, is the 12th busiest transshipment port and the 12th busiest container port in the world. The or ' exercises jurisdiction for a majority of the Klang District while the Shah Alam City Council exercises some jurisdiction over the east of Klang District, north of Petaling District and the other parts of Selangor State including Shah Alam itself. As of 2010, the Klang City has a total population of 240,016 (10,445 in the city centre), while the population of Klang District is 842,146, and the population of all towns managed by Klang Municipal Council is 744,062. ==History== The Klang Bell, dated 200 BC\u2013200 AD The royal town of Klang has been a site of human settlement since prehistoric times. Bronze Age drums, axes and other artefacts have been found in the vicinity of the town and within the town itself. A bronze bell dating from the 2nd century BC was found in Klang and is now in the British Museum.British Museum Collection Also found in or near Klang are iron tools called \"tulang mawas\" (\"ape bones\") and a bronze drum. Commanding the approaches to the tin rich Klang Valley, Klang has always been of key strategic importance. It was mentioned as a dependency of other states as early as the 11th century. Klang was also mentioned in the 14th century literary work Nagarakretagama dated to the Majapahit Empire, and the Klang River was already marked and named on the earliest maritime charts of Chinese Admiral Cheng Ho on his visits to Malacca from 1409 to 1433. Mao Kun map from Wubei Zhi which is based on the early 15th century maps of Zheng He showing Klang River estuary (\u5409\u4ee4\u6e2f) near the top left Klang was under the control of the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century. The celebrated Tun Perak, the Malacca's greatest Bendahara, came from Klang and became its territorial chief. According to the Malay Annals, the people of Klang overthrew the local chief or penghulu and asked the Sultan of Malacca Muzaffar Shah to appoint another, and Tun Perak was then appointed the leader. Klang was known as a producer of tin; according to Manuel Godinho de Er\u00e9dia, it produced one hundred bares of tin a year when the Portuguese occupied Malacca. Klang however remained in Malay hands after the fall of Melaka to the Portuguese in 1511, and was controlled by the Sultan Johor-Riau. In the 17th century, the Bugis began to settle in the coastal region of Selangor including Klang, and the Selangor sultanate was created in the 1766, which then controlled Klang. Klang Municipal Council building with old Raja Mahadi fort's gate in the foreground. In the 19th century the importance of Klang greatly increased by the rapid expansion of tin mining as a result of the increased demand for tin from the West. The desire to control the Klang Valley led directly to the Klang War (also called the Selangor Civil War) of 1867\u20131874 when Raja Mahdi fought to regain what he considered his birthright as territorial chief against Raja Abdullah. During the Klang War, in 1868, the seat of power was moved to Bandar Temasya, Kuala Langat, and then to Jugra which became the royal capital of Selangor. Klang however did not lose its importance. In 1874, Selangor accepted a British Resident who would \"advise\" the Sultan, and Klang became the capital of British colonial administration for Selangor from 1875 until 1880 when the capital city was moved to Kuala Lumpur due to the growth of Kuala Lumpur from tin-mining. Today Klang is no longer State capital or the main seat of the ruler, but it remains the headquarters of the District to which it gives it name. Until the construction of Port Swettenham (now known as Port Klang) in 1901, Klang remained the chief outlet for Selangor's tin, and its position was enhanced by the completion of the Klang Valley railway to Bukit Kuda in 1886, which was then connected to Klang itself via a rail bridge, the Connaught Bridge, completed in 1890. In the 1890s its growth was further stimulated by the development of the district into the State' leading producer of coffee, and later rubber. In 1903, the royal seat was moved back to Klang when it became the official seat of Sultan Sulaiman (Sultan Alauddin Sulaiman Shah). Klang in the 1870s In May 1890, a local authority, known as Klang Health Board, was established to administer Klang town. The official boundary of Klang was first defined in 1895. The first road bridge over the Klang River connecting the two parts of the town, the Belfield Bridge, was constructed in 1908. In 1926 the health boards of Klang and Port Swettenham were merged, and in 1945 the local authority was renamed Klang Town Board. In 1954, the Town Board became the Klang Town Council after a local election was set up to select its members in accordance with the Local Government Election Ordinance of 1950. In 1963, the Port Klang Authority was created and it now administers three Port Klang areas: Northport, Southpoint, and West Port. In 1971, the Klang District Council, which incorporated the nearby townships of Kapar and Meru as well as Port Klang, was formed. After undergoing a further reorganisation according to the Local Government Act of 1976 (Act 171), Klang District Council was upgraded to Klang Municipal Council (KMC) on 1 January 1977. From 1974 to 1977, Klang was the state capital of Selangor before the seat of government shifted to Shah Alam in 1977. ===Etymology=== Klang may have taken its name from the Klang River which runs through the town. The entire geographical area in the immediate vicinity of the river, which begins at Kuala Lumpur and runs west all the way to Port Klang, is known as the Klang Valley. One popular theory on the origin of the name is that it is derived from the Mon\u2013Khmer word Klong, which may mean a canal or waterway. Alternatively it has also been argued that it means \"warehouses\", from the Malay word Kilang \u2013 in the old days, it was full of warehouses (kilang currently means \"factory\"). Klang was also once known as Pengkalan Batu meaning \"stone jetty\". ==Districts== Pasar Jawa Mosque on the northern side of Klang River Klang is divided into North Klang and South Klang, which are separated by the Klang River. North Klang is divided into three sub-districts which are Kapar (Located at the north of North Klang), Rantau Panjang (situated at the west of North Klang) and Meru (at the east of North Klang). Klang North used to be the main commercial centre of Klang, but since 2008, more residential and commercial areas as well as government offices are being developed in Klang South. Most major government and private health care facilities are also located at Klang South. Hence, this area tends to be busier and becomes the centre of social and recreational activities after office hours and during the weekends. This is triggered by the rapid growth of new and modern townships such as Bandar Botanic, Bandar Bukit Tinggi, Taman Sentosa Perdana, Taman Sri Andalas, Taman Bayu Perdana, Glenmarie Cove, Kota Bayuemas etc. all located within Klang South. At the Klang North side, some of the older and established residential areas include Berkeley Garden, Taman Eng Ann, Taman Klang Utama, Bandar Baru Klang and so forth. Newer townships include Bandar Bukit Raja, Aman Perdana and Klang Sentral. Malaysia's busiest port, Port Klang was previously named Port Swettenham until 1972 when it was renamed Port Klang. Port Klang is located at Klang South. == Economy == The economy of Klang is closely linked with that the greater Klang Valley conurbation which is the most densely populated, urbanised and industrialised region of Malaysia. There is a wide range of industries within the Klang municipality, major industrial areas may be found in Bukit Raja, Kapar, Meru, Taman Klang Utama and Sungai Buloh, Pulau Indah, Teluk Gong and others. Rubber used to be an important part of the economy of the region, but from the 1970s onwards, many rubber plantations have switched to palm oil, and were then converted again for urban development and infrastructure use. Port Klang forms an important part of the economy of Klang. It is home to about 95 shipping companies and agents, 300 custom brokers, 25 container storage centres, as well as more than 70 freight and transport companies. It handled almost 50% of Malaysia's sea-borne container trade in 2013. The Port Klang Free Zone was established in 2004 to transform Port Klang into a regional distribution hub as well as a trade and logistics centre. ==Politics== Klang encompasses three parliamentary seats: Kapar (Mr. Manikavasagam a/l Sundaram of PKR), Kota Raja (Mr. Mohamad Sabu of Amanah), and Klang (Mr. Charles Anthony Santiago of DAP). All three are held by the Pakatan Harapan coalition. These constituencies are subdivided into state seats. ==Demographics== The following are the census figures for the population of Klang. The 1957 and 1970 figures are for the Klang district and were collected before the reorganisation of Klang and the Bumiputra status being used as a category. The 2010 figures are for MP Klang. The figure for Klang city is not given as what constitutes Bandar Klang appears to be inconsistent with considerable fluctuation in numbers over the years. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Ethnic Group !colspan=\"6\"|Population |- !colspan=\"2\"|1957 !colspan=\"2\"|1970 !colspan=\"2\"|2010 |- |style=\"text-align:left\" | Malay || 37,003 || 24.68% || 72,734 || 31.13%|| 234,293 || 41.18% |- |style=\"text-align:left\" | Other Bumiputras || || || || || 9,107 || 1.60% |- style=\"background: #eaf3ff\" |style=\"text-align:left\" | Bumiputra total || || || || || 243,400 || 42.78% |- |style=\"text-align:left\" | Chinese || 65,454|| 43.65% ||100,524 || 43.02% || 152,582 || 26.83% |- |style=\"text-align:left\" | Indian ||44,393 || 29.60% ||59,333 ||25.39% || 121,533 || 21.37% |- |style=\"text-align:left\" | Others || 3,105 || 2.07%|| 1,079 || 0.46% || 2,994 || 0.53% |- style=\"background: #eaf3ff\" |style=\"text-align:left\" | Malaysian total || || || || || 520,509 || 91.53% |- |style=\"text-align:left\" | Non-Malaysian || || || || || 48,198 || 8.47% |- style=\"background: #c6e2ff\" |style=\"text-align:left\"| Total|| 149,955|| 100.00%|| 233,670 || 100.00% || 568,707 || 100.00% |} == Crime == There are a number of criminal gangs operating in Klang, and gang violence is not uncommon. Among the Chinese community, there are the Ang Bin Hoey triad gangs such as Gang 21 which operates in Kuala Lumpur and the Klang Valley. There are also Gang 24, Gang 36 and others, and their members are often Indians. Due to economic development and changes in the industry, many rubber estates where Indian plantation workers used to live and work were closed, and this is thought to have contributed to a rise of gangsterism amongst the displaced and economically-deprived Indians. It is thought that the Indians originally worked for Chinese gang leaders but they now dominate many of these criminal organisations. ==Transportation and accessibility== Klang is served by five commuter stations that constitute the Port Klang Line of the KTM Komuter system, namely Bukit Badak, Kampung Raja Uda, Klang, Teluk Pulai and the Teluk Gadong stations. By November 2023, Klang will also be connected to the RM 9 billion LRT 3 rail line. Klang is connected to the rest of the Klang Valley via the Federal Highway, the New Klang Valley Expressway (NKVE), South Klang Valley Expressway (SKVE), the North Klang Straits Bypass (New North Klang Straits Bypass) as well as the KESAS Highway. The West Coast Expressway (WCE) currently under construction will run between Changkat Jering, Perak and Klang-Banting, Selangor. The construction is expected to be fully completed by end-2022 Klang is also served by the RapidKL bus route. Klang Sentral acts as a terminal for long-distance buses and taxis in northern Klang. There is a non-stop hourly bus service everyday from and to KLIA2 to Klang, of which the embarkation point is located at the AEON Bukit Tinggi Shopping Centre. Smart Selangor Bus Programme was established by the Selangor State Government to provide an efficient and high quality free public transportation service to its citizen. This programme was launched in July 2015 starting with 3 local authorities but it was later expanded to all 12 local authorities in 2020 due to overwhelming response from the public. Selangor Intelligent Transport Systems Application (SITS) enables the Smart Selangor Bus users to plan their journey effectively and intelligently through the bus services available. Kota Bridge The double-decked Kota Bridge was first built in late 1950s as a replacement for the Belfield Bridge. The double-decked bridge now closed to car traffic after a new Kota Bridge was built alongside it in the 1992, although the lower deck is still used by pedestrians, bicycles and motorcycles. A second bridge in Klang, the Musaeddin (Tengku Kelana) Bridge, was built in the 1980s near the Kota Bridge. The RM199 million Klang Third Bridge was opened for traffic in May 2017, complementing the existing two other road bridges in the city that connect Klang North and Klang South. ==Infrastructure and developments== === Shopping complexes === The AEON Bukit Tinggi Shopping Centre in Bandar Bukit Tinggi, Klang has the largest AEON store in Southeast Asia.

The master plan set-up reserves Klang as an Eco Smart City to spur on new sustainable social and economic growth along Klang River that includes elements of river cleaning, rehabilitation & development. Sungai Klang will be turned into a new source of economy for the state through the Selangor Maritime Gateway (SMG) project. SMG includes several development components including commerce, hospitality, tourism, housing and service industry. === River Cleaning === Landasan Lumayan Sdn Bhd (LLSB) has been given the mandate to clean the Klang River since 2016 crossing four municipalities namely MBPJ, MPSJ, MBSA and MPK. Due to the efforts given, a vast amount of total waste collected until July 2019 is around 50,000 MT. The debris has been reduced from average of 1,446 MT per month in 2016 to 1,094 MT per month in 2019. This enormous improvement is due to public awareness among the residents through various programs and activities organised under Selangor Maritime Gateway. Projects includes : * Log Boom Installation * Water Quality Live Monitoring Systems * Interceptor === Rehabilitation === Rehabilitation ensures the sustainability of the surrounding population and environment in a changing climate. The objectives are to restore ecological balance, to improve water quality to avoid flood mitigation as well as to preserve the environment for a better transformation of Klang River. The primary purpose of rehabilitation of Telok Kapas with 98 acres of land in Pasir Panjang, Klang which had been officially stopped in operation in 2007 is to improve water quality as well as restoring the site with a proper safe closure. The comprehensive rehabilitation of Klang River involves creation of new land and utility services with estimated cost of RM 3 billion that involve the Design Concept, Construction and Operation and Maintenance. The objectives are to increase the water quality and economic activities. === Development === The framework sets to re-establish the urban developments along the river from one zone to the other. The plans set the development of six (6) zones in Selangor Maritime Gateway (SMG) through consolidation of Urban Design, Landscape, Transportation, Environmental and Economic Consideration of the existing condition and cultural context. Six zones are proposed as a basis for creating community identity and place-making along the river stretch. Together, the intention brings the true potential of what Klang River can be as well as gives a new pulse to the river. The catalyst projects includes : * Pengkalan Batu Urban Park * Mangrove Point * Grand Bazaar * Cultural Village & Retreat Resort * Community River Park === Services === River Patrol Unit (PRU) was established to monitor any illegal activities that may risk water quality and it has been commenced at certain routes along Klang River. Apart from the physical impact project, we have acted proactively by conducting continuous monitoring along the river reserves to ensure that no activity is at risk of polluting the Klang River. Therefore, the formation of the Motorcycle River Patrol Unit is required at this point with the assistance of existing government agencies such as LUAS, JPS, etc. Looking at the rich historical value of the Klang River, providing connectivity via water for tourist destinations along the river which brought a huge impact to the earlier population in terms of economic activities and growth of the Klang Valley. The River Taxi will also help to attract the local and even international tourists to embrace the natural beauty of the Klang River and historic Klang town. The introduction of new tourist attractions such as Pangkalan Batu Urban Park and Biophilia concept at Mangrove Point in addition to the existing spots, will serve to complement the tourism industry in Klang which will attract locals, Klang Valley population and international tourists. ==International relations== ===Sister cities=== Klang currently has two sister cities: {|class=\"wikitable\" |- valign=\"top\" | * \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, China. || * Yongzhou, China. |} ==References== ==External links== * * Klang Online Magazine,Guide & Map * Official portal of Klang Municipal Council (MPK) Category:Towns in Selangor ",
