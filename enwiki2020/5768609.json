    "text": "The Gunai language ( , also spelt Gunnai, Ganai, Gaanay, Kurnai, Kurnay ) is an Australian aboriginal dialect cluster of the Gunai people in Gippsland in south-east Victoria. Bidhawal (Birrdhawal) was either a divergent dialect or a closely related language. ==Varieties== means 'man'. The language had no traditional name, but each of its dialects was referred to separately. In a 1996 report to the Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages, Clark refers to five Gunai dialects: Brabralung, Braiakalung, Brataualung, Krauatungalung and Tatungalung.Ian D. Clark, Aboriginal Language Areas In Victoria , A Report to the Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages, 14 July 2006. Accessed 24 November 2008 * ( = man, = belonging to) located in central Gippsland. * ( = Man, = west, = belonging to) located around Sale through to the mountains. * (men belonging to this place which have fire; = men, or = fire, = belonging to) located in South Gippsland. * ( = east, = belonging to) located eastwards to the Snowy River. * ( = sea, = belonging to) located in the coast area between Lake King and Lake Wellington. Gunai dialects have been confused with Muk-thang/Bidhawal; there appear to be two distinct languages here, but it's not clear which variety belongs to which. ==Phonology== Like other Victorian languages, Gunai allowed initial in its words. However, it also allowed initial , and well as the clusters () and (). This is quite unusual for an Australian language, and the same pattern was found in the Tasmanian languages across Bass Strait. === Consonants === {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !Labial !Dental !Alveolar !Retroflex !Palatal !Velar |- align=\"center\" !Stop |/ |/ |/ |/ |/ |/ |- align=\"center\" !Nasal | | | | | | |- align=\"center\" !Rhotic | | | | | | |- align=\"center\" !Lateral | | | | | | |- align=\"center\" !Approximant | | | | | | |} === Vowels === {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !Front !Central !Back |- align=\"center\" !High | | | |- align=\"center\" !Mid | | | |- align=\"center\" !Low | | | |} ==Revival== Since the early 1990s, the Victorian Aboriginal Corporation for Languages (VACL) organisation, established the Yirruk-Tinnor Gunnai/K\u016drnai language program which focused on reviving and reclaiming the Gunnai language of Gippsland. Doris Paton, Coordinator of the Program and Lynnette Solomon-Dent, Language worker and consultant are involved in the program. They have been responsible for developing a number of resource materials to support and educate further knowledge of the Gunnai language and Culture. Lynnette Solomon-Dent co-wrote with Christina Eira the VACL Linguist, the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) Aboriginal Languages, cultures and reclamation in Victorian schools: standards P-10 and protocols and were involved in the VCE Revival and Reclamation Study. These teaching documents and resources are collectively used to educate school aged children P-10, VCE, higher learning institutions and the Aboriginal community members, to further their knowledge and allow community members to continue to educate future generations. ==Placenames possibly derived from the Gunai language== A number of placenames in Gunai country feature the ending , meaning \"place\". {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
