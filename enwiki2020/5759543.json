He graduated in 1946 and went on to attend Ohio State University, where he became a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. After graduating from Ohio State in 1950, Fries continued to work for his father's produce business until, in 1952, his uncle, Joe Moore, who worked at Ziv Television Programs offered Fries the opportunity to move to California and work for the company.Boylson,Monica, \"West Sider's move is made for TV,\" Delhi-Price Hill Press, Cincinnati, OH, May 11, 2011, page B8 == Education == He graduated from Ohio State University, where he also achieve an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree.

During his eight years at Ziv, the company produced shows such as The Cisco Kid, Highway Patrol, and Sea Hunt. \"Television was a cottage industry in 1952, when I came on the scene. The Ziv office staff in Hollywood was very small, probably no more than fifteen people.\" With Fries running the company's production and studio operations, Ziv became one of the more prominent independent TV syndication companies. Rather than only buying commercial air time on TV, advertisers during this period would typically buy entire programs, such as General Electric Theater hosted by Ronald Reagan and Texaco Star Theater hosted by Milton Berle. Ziv and other syndication companies would fashion a show for an advertiser by tailoring main titles and commercials to air in the number of cities that the advertiser would \"buy.\" These specially fashioned titles and commercials made it look like the advertiser owned and produced the entire series. The rise of network television ultimately prompted company founder Frederick Ziv to sell the company to United Artists in 1960. ==Screen Gems== Fries parted ways with Ziv and was appointed Vice President In Charge of Production for Screen Gems, the Columbia Pictures television arm, in 1960. He was involved in the production of such series as Naked City, Route 66, Bewitched, Father Knows Best, and I Dream of Jeannie, during which he became lifelong friends with that sitcom's lead actress Barbara Eden. Years later, I Dream of Jeannie actor Larry Hagman confided to Fries that during production of the series, Hagman despised the bosses at Columbia and Screen Gems with such fervor that he once hired an airplane to fly over the studio so he could urinate out the window onto the buildings.Fries,Chuck, Godfather of the Television Movie - A History of Television, October 2010, Monte Cristo Publications, page 117 While working at Screen Gems, Fries took a meeting at the famed Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel with Harold Cohen, a former lawyer at several Hollywood talent agencies who was currently between jobs and looking to begin a new career as a producer. Fries arrived for an 8:00 a.m. breakfast meeting to find that Cohen's tablecloth was already soiled. When Fries asked what had happened, Cohen admitted that he'd already had a meeting with someone at 7:30. \"I had some coffee with him and I'm gonna have my grapefruit now\", Cohen said. After the meeting, Fries was getting up to leave when somebody else showed up at Cohen's table for an 8:45 meeting. This particular meeting between Fries and Cohen would ultimately result in Screen Gems' placing the variety show The Johnny Cash Show on the air. It ran for two seasons.Fries,Chuck, Godfather of the Television Movie - A History of Television, October 2010, Monte Cristo Publications, p. 119 ==Columbia and Metromedia== In 1968, Fries became Vice President In Charge of Feature Film Production for Columbia Pictures, where he worked on theatrical films such as Castle Keep (with Burt Lancaster), The Horsemen (with Jack Palance), Five Easy Pieces (with Jack Nicholson and Karen Black), and Getting Straight (with Elliott Gould and Candice Bergen).
