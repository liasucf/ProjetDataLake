    "text": "Duke Hu of Chen (; fl. 11th century BC) was the founding monarch of the ancient Chinese state of Chen (\u9648\u56fd), established in modern eastern Henan Province soon after his father-in-law King Wu of Zhou founded the Zhou dynasty in 1046/45 BC. Chen is considered to be the founding ancestor of the surname Chen, one of the most common Chinese surnames, as well as one of the founding ancestors of the surname Hu. The rulers of the H\u1ed3 (Hu) dynasty of Vietnam claimed to be Chen's descendants. == Names == He is also known as Hu Gong Man (\u80e1\u516c\u6ee1) and Gui Man (\u5aaf\u6ee1). Chen's given name was Man (\u6eff), and his xing (\u59d3) or surname was Gui (\u5aaf), which is the ancestor of the surname Chen (\u9648). Hu (\u80e1) was his posthumous name. ==Biography== Chen was said to be a descendant of the legendary sage king Emperor Shun. His father Efu (\u95bc\u7236) served as taozheng (\u9676\u6b63), the official in charge of the manufacture of pottery, for the Zhou state. King Wu of Zhou thought highly of Efu, and gave his eldest daughter, Da Ji (\u5927\u59ec), to Efu's son Man in marriage. After King Wu conquered the Shang dynasty to establish the Zhou dynasty in 1046/45 BC, he enfeoffed the descendants of three ancient sage kings in the newly conquered land, known as the San Ke (\u4e09\u606a, \"Three Reverent States\"), and Man was enfeoffed at the state of Chen, with its capital at Wanqiu, in modern Huaiyang County, Henan Province. After Chen died, he was succeeded by his son Xihou (\u7280\u4faf), posthumously known as Duke Sh\u0113n of Chen. After the death of Duke Sh\u0113n, a younger son of Chen, Gaoyang (\u768b\u7f8a), ascended the throne, to be known as Duke Xiang of Chen. == Family == Wife: Daji (\u5927\u59ec), Zhou Wuwang's eldest daughter Children * Chen Shengong (\u9673\u7533\u516c), older son, 2nd ruler of Chen * Chen Xianggong (\u9673\u76f8\u516c), younger son, 3rd ruler of Chen == Legacy == Chen is honoured as the founding ancestor of the Chen surname, which originated in the state of Chen. As of 2020, Chen is the 5th most common surname in China today and 4th most common in the world, shared by 70 million people within the country and over 100 million people worldwide (in 2014, there were 54 million in China and 80 million worldwide). Some of Chen's descendants adopted his posthumous name Hu as their surname, and Chen is also considered one of the main ancestors of Hu, the 15th most common surname in China. Dozens of other surnames, including Tian, Yuan, and Che, originated as branches of the Chen surname. The Chen clan would later found the Chen Dynasty of China and then the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty, a golden age of Vietnam (\u9648\u671d Tran is the Vietnamese pronunciation of Chen). In 1400 AD, H\u1ed3 Qu\u00fd Ly overthrew the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty and established the H\u1ed3 dynasty (H\u1ed3 is the Vietnamese pronunciation for \"Hu\"). He claimed to be a descendant of Chen Hugong and Emperor Shun, and changed the name of Vietnam from \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to \u0110\u1ea1i Ngu (\u5927\u865e), or Great Ngu (Ngu is the Vietnamese pronunciation for Yu \u865e the legendary state of Emperor Shun). The State of Chen that Chen Hugong founded is also the birthplace of Daoism, being the home country of Laozi. ==Tomb== Chen's tomb was said to be made of iron and buried under water near the Dragon Lake in Huaiyang County. Archaeologists have found Western Zhou era pottery shards and Warring States- era roof tiles in the area. In 1995, Singaporean businessman Chen Yonghe (\u9673\u6c38\u548c) donated funds to build a new mausoleum and temple complex for Chen in Huaiyang, and it has become a popular pilgrimage site for people of Chen, Hu, and other surnames that originated in the state of Chen. == Memorial == A memorial of Chen Hugong (\u9648\u80e1\u516c\u7eaa\u5ff5\u5802) has been built in Fuzhou, Fujian. == References == === Citations === === Sources === * * * Category:Monarchs of Chen (state) Category:11th-century BC Chinese monarchs Category:People descended from Chinese deities ",
