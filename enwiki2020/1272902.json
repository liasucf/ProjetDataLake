    "text": "The British film-making partnership of Michael Powell (1905\u20131990) and Emeric Pressburger (1902\u20131988)\u2014together often known as The Archers, the name of their production company\u2014made a series of influential films in the 1940s and 1950s. Their collaborations\u201424 films between 1939 and 1972\u2014were mainly derived from original stories by Pressburger with the script written by both Pressburger & Powell. Powell did most of the directing while Pressburger did most of the work of the producer and also assisted with the editing, especially the way the music was used. Unusually, the pair shared a writer-director-producer credit for most of their films. The best-known of these are The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), A Canterbury Tale (1944), I Know Where I'm Going! (1945), A Matter of Life and Death (1946), Black Narcissus (1947), The Red Shoes (1948), and The Tales of Hoffmann (1951). In 1981 Powell and Pressburger were recognised for their contributions to British cinema with the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award, the most prestigious award given by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. ==History== ===Early films=== Powell was already an experienced director, having worked his way up from making silent films to the First World War drama The Spy in Black (1939), his first film for Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9 producer Alexander Korda. Pressburger, who had come from Hungary in 1935, already worked for Korda, and was asked to do some rewrites for the film.Powell 1986, pp 302\u2013303 This collaboration was the first of 19, most over the next 18 years. After Powell had made two further films for Korda, he reunited with Pressburger in 1940 for Contraband, the first in a run of Powell and Pressburger films set during the Second World War. The second was 49th Parallel (1941), which won Pressburger an Academy Award for Best Story. Both are Hitchcock-like thrillers made as anti-Nazi propaganda. ===Birth of The Archers=== The pair adopted a joint writer-producer-director credit for their next film, One of Our Aircraft Is Missing (1942) and made reference to \"The Archers\" in the credits. In 1943 they incorporated their own production company, Archers Film Productions, and adopted a distinctive archery target logo which began each film. The joint credit \"Written, Produced and Directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger\" indicates their joint responsibility for their own work and that they weren't beholden to any studio or other producers.Powell 1986, pp 386\u2013387 In a letter to Wendy Hiller in 1942, asking her to appear in Colonel Blimp, Pressburger explicitly set out 'The Archers' Manifesto'. Its five points express the pair's intentions:Macdonald, 1994. pp 189\u2013190 # We owe allegiance to nobody except the financial interests which provide our money; and, to them, the sole responsibility of ensuring them a profit, not a loss. # Every single foot in our films is our own responsibility and nobody else's. We refuse to be guided or coerced by any influence but our own judgement. # When we start work on a new idea we must be a year ahead, not only of our competitors, but also of the times. A real film, from idea to universal release, takes a year. Or more. # No artist believes in escapism. And we secretly believe that no audience does. We have proved, at any rate, that they will pay to see the truth, for other reasons than her nakedness. # At any time, and particularly at the present, the self-respect of all collaborators, from star to prop-man, is sustained, or diminished, by the theme and purpose of the film they are working on. They began to form a group of regular cast and crew members who worked with them on many films over the next 12 years. Hardly any of these people were ever under contract to The Archers\u2014they were hired film by film\u2014but Powell and Pressburger soon learnt whom they worked well with and who enjoyed working with them.Powell, 1986. p. 579. David Farrar was the only person ever given a multi-film contract by The Archers When Raymond Massey was offered the part of the Prosecuting Attorney in A Matter of Life and Death his cabled reply was \"For The Archers anytime, this world or the next.\"Powell, 1986 Powell and Pressburger also co-produced a few films by other directors under The Archers' banner: The Silver Fleet (1943), written and directed by Vernon Sewell and Gordon Wellesley, based on a story by Pressburger, and The End of the River (1947), directed by Derek N. Twist, to which both Powell and Pressburger contributed uncredited writing. Both Sewell and Twist had worked with Powell & Pressburger previously on other films and were being given their first chance as directors. During the remainder of the war they released a series of acclaimed films: * The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943) * The Volunteer (1943) a short propaganda film * A Canterbury Tale (1944) * I Know Where I'm Going! (1945) * A Matter of Life and Death (1946) ===The collaboration=== Generally, Pressburger created the original story (for all their films from 1940\u20131946 and The Red Shoes) and wrote the first draft of the script. They then passed the script back and forth a few times\u2014they could never work on it together in the same room. For the dialogue, Pressburger knew what he wanted the characters to say but Powell would often supply some of the actual words. They both acted as producers, perhaps Pressburger slightly more than Powell, since he could soothe the feathers ruffled by Powell's forthright manner. They became their own producers mainly to stop anyone else from interfering, since they had a considerable degree of freedom, especially under Rank, to make just about any film they wanted. The direction was nearly all done by Powell, but even so The Archers generally worked as a team, with the cast and crew often making suggestions. Pressburger was always on hand, usually on the studio floor, to make sure that these late changes fit seamlessly into the story. Once the filming was finished, Powell usually went off for a walk in the hills of Scotland to clear his head, but Pressburger was often closely involved in the editing, especially in the way the music was used. Pressburger was a musician himself and had played the violin in an orchestra in Hungary. When the film was finally ready and Powell was back from the Highlands, he was usually \"the front man\" in any promotional work, such as interviews for the trade papers or fan magazines. Because collaborative efforts such as Powell and Pressburger's were, and continue to be, unusual in the film industry, and because of the influence of the auteur theory, which elevates the director as a film's primary creator, Pressburger has sometimes been dismissed as \"Michael Powell's scriptwriter\", but Powell himself was the first to say, in many interviews, that he couldn't have done most of what he did without Pressburger. ===Post-war success and decline=== *Black Narcissus (1947) *The Red Shoes (1948) *The Small Back Room (1949) *The Elusive Pimpernel (1950) *Gone to Earth (1950). A substantially re-edited version was released in the US as The Wild Heart (1952) by co-producer David O. Selznick, after a court battle with Powell and Pressburger.Powell, 1992. p. 81 The film was fully restored by the British Film Archive in 1985. *The Tales of Hoffmann (1951) ===End of the partnership=== In the early 1950s Powell and Pressburger began to produce fewer films, with notably less success. The Archers' productions officially came to an end in 1957, and the pair separated to pursue their individual careers. The separation was quite amicable and they remained devoted friends for the rest of their lives. *Oh... Rosalinda!! (1955) *The Battle of the River Plate (1956) *Ill Met by Moonlight (1957) ===Later collaboration=== The pair reunited for two films: *They're a Weird Mob (1966) *The Boy Who Turned Yellow (1972) ==Regular cast and crew== Powell and Pressburger re-used actors and crew members in a number of films. Actors who were part of The Archers' \"stock company\" include: * Pamela Brown * Kathleen Byron * Robert Coote * Finlay Currie * Cyril Cusack * Esmond Knight * David Farrar * Marius Goring * Robert Helpmann * Wendy Hiller * Valerie Hobson * Deborah Kerr * John Laurie * Roger Livesey * Raymond Massey * L\u00e9onide Massine * Laurence Olivier * Eric Portman * Sir Ralph Richardson * Moira Shearer * Jean Simmons * Conrad Veidt * Anton Walbrook * Googie Withers Notable crew members include: * Cinematographers: Erwin Hillier, Jack Cardiff and Christopher Challis. * Production and costume designers Alfred Junge, Hein Heckroth and Ivor Beddoes. * Composers and musicians Brian Easdale, Allan Gray, Sir Thomas Beecham and Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa. * Editors David Lean and Reginald Mills. Lean edited two early films, and went on to become a well-known and influential director himself. Mills edited twelve films from 1946\u20131956, nearly to the end of the partnership. ==Critical opinions== British film critics gave the films of Powell and Pressburger a mixed reaction at the time, acknowledging their creativity, but sometimes questioning their motivations and taste. For better or worse, The Archers were always out of step with mainstream British cinema. From the 1970s onwards, British critical opinion began to revise this lukewarm assessment, with their first BFI retrospective in 1970 and another in 1978. They are now seen as playing a key part in the history of British film, and have become influential and iconic for many film- makers of later generations, such as Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and George A. Romero, among others. ==Filmography== *The Spy in Black (1939) *Contraband (1940) *49th Parallel (1941) *One of Our Aircraft Is Missing (1942) *The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943) *The Volunteer (1943) *A Canterbury Tale (1944) *I Know Where I'm Going!
