    "text": "Front view from Beco do Pinto The Beco do Pinto, also known as Beco do Col\u00e9gio, is a passage located between the Casa N\u00famero Um and Solar da Marquesa de Santos in the center of S\u00e3o Paulo. It links the streets Roberto Simonsen and Bitterncourt Rodrigues. In Brazil's colonial times, it had the function of allowing the transit of people and animals between the \"Largo da S\u00e9\" and the meadow of Tamanduate\u00ed River. Today, under the administration of \"Casa da Imagem\" (also known as \"Casa N\u00famero Um\"), it houses projects especially developed for the space by contemporary artists. It also constitutes an important architectural, historical and cultural setting, together with buildings that surround it, and integrates the Museu da Cidade de S\u00e3o Paulo. == History == Internal detail from Beco do Pinto The alley was named after Brigadeiro Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Pinto de Moraes Leme. In 1821, the military man, then owner of the townhouse \u2013 a house that later came to be known as Solar da Marquesa de Santos \u2013 made the first significant change regarding the passage and began a complicated relationship with the C\u00e2mara Municipal. In addition to being a way of strategical communication that linked the higher part of the city with the lower part, where there was concentration of the trades of S\u00e3o Paulo, the Alley also was a path where the slaves went to fetch water and discard domestic waste. And, for being a steep and winding passage, many chose not to go down to the meadow and dumped the trash wherever they went. Troubled with it, the Brigadeiro closed the Beco do Pinto with a gate, however, this change did not last long, because the order was contested and forbidden by the City Hall, due to it being a public service. Jos\u00e9 Joaquim Pinto was again notified a few years later, this time for having expanded his back yard with the construction of a wall. The change would have affected the insulation from the neighbouring house, today the Casa N\u00famero Um. The wall was demolished in 1826. The passage was reopened by the City Hall, receiving the official name of Beco do Col\u00e9gio. === Marquesa de Santos === Domitila de Castro Canto e Melo, the Marquesa de Santos, bought the Solar in 1834. Together with the purchase, came the requirement that the City Hall allow the reconstruction of the demolished wall and the re-installation from the Beco's gate, alleging that there would be no guarantee of security to their property without the usage of such measures. In 1849, the request was attended by the City Hall.DPH, Relat\u00f3rio de Bens Protegidos do Departamento de Patrim\u00f4nio Hist\u00f3rico de S\u00e3o Paulo. Beco do Pinto. Acessado em 29 de outubro de 2016 === Currently === In 1912, after the opening from the slope of Carmo, actual Avenue Rangel Pestana, the Beco lost its function and was deactivated. View from the Casa da Imagem from inside the Beco Currently, the Beco do Pinto is under the responsibility of the Secretaria Municipal de Cultura, and is administered by Casa da Imagem. It integrates the Museu da Cidade de S\u00e3o Paulo and houses artistic installations produced only for this location. == Architectural features == The Beco do Pinto was constructed originally so that transit was possible between the old street of Carmo \u2013 today, street Roberto Simonsen \u2013 and the meadow of Tamanduate\u00ed river (near what currently is street Bittencourt Rodrigues), places divided by a large slope. It is configured architecturally on a staircase permeated by bids, which alternate between flat and inclined. The steps are made of granite and the flat throws are covered with Portuguese stones. The lateral boundaries are defined by the lots of neighbouring buildings, the Casa N\u00famero Um (current Casa da Imagem) and the Solar da Marquesa de Santos. The Beco is sited in a ground of 368,40 m\u00b2 and has two extremities marked by gates with boss and triangular pediment. The gate from the Roberto Simonsen street presents neoclassic ornaments, aduela and the coat of arms of Brazil, in low relief. In addition, there are two archaeological showcases that exhibit vestiges of the old footwear.

Beyond that, the passage also represents an important historical mark for having been, during the years from the Brazilian colonial age, the main link between the urban center, concentrated around theP\u00e1tio do Col\u00e9gio, and the Tamanduate\u00ed river, located where there was a commercial grouping.
