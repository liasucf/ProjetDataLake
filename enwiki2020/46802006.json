It has, since the nineteenth century, been one of the main streets of Reykjav\u00edk. ==History== With the building of a bridge over L\u00e6kinn, the stream running from Tj\u00f6rnin along what is now L\u00e6kjargata, in 1828, Bankarstr\u00e6ti, along with the contiguous Austurstr\u00e6ti and Laugavegur, became some of the most important streets in Reykjav\u00edk.Helga Maureen Gylfad\u00f3ttir and Gu\u00f0n\u00fd Ger\u00f0ur Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir, H\u00fasak\u00f6nnun: Austurstr\u00e6ti \u2013 P\u00f3sth\u00fasstr\u00e6ti \u2013 Hafnarstr\u00e6ti \u2013 L\u00e6kjargata, Sk\u00fdrsla, 132 (Reykjav\u00edk: Minjasafn Reykjav\u00edkur, 2006), p. 11; http://rafhladan.is/handle/10802/4886. The street saw Reykjav\u00edk's first street light, an oil-lamp beside L\u00e6kjartorg. Since the earlier twentieth century, the street has been one-way. Since 2012, Bankastr\u00e6ti, along with Laugarvegur and Sk\u00f3lav\u00f6r\u00f0ust\u00edgur, has been pedestrianised during the summer as part of the 'sumar g\u00f6tur eru sumarg\u00f6tur' ('some streets are summerstreets') scheme.Eva \u00derastard\u00f3ttir, 'G\u00f6ngug\u00f6tur \u00ed mi\u00f0b\u00e6jum: Laugavegur \u2013 Bankastr\u00e6ti \u2013 Sk\u00f3lav\u00f6r\u00f0ust\u00edgur' (unpublished MSc dissertation, University of Reykjav\u00edk, 2013), http://skemman.is/is/item/view/1946/16115. ==Name== Bankastr\u00e6ti, Reykjav\u00edk, on Mayday 2014. Looking west towards L\u00e6kjartorg from Bankastr\u00e6ti 12 (on the left hand side) and 11 (on the right). Bankastr\u00e6ti is now named after Landsbanki \u00cdslands, which commenced operation at 3 Bankastr\u00e6ti on July 1, 1886.J\u00f3n Oddur Sigur\u00f0sson, '\u00c1hrif hagr\u00e6\u00f0ingar \u00ed \u00fej\u00f3nustu \u00e1 vi\u00f0horf og \u00edmynd Landsbankans \u00ed Gar\u00f0i' (unpublished BSc dissertation, University of Iceland, 2014), p. 11; http://skemman.is/item/view/1946/18254. It was previously named Bakarabrekka ['bakery hill'], named for Bernh\u00f6ftsbakar\u00ed [Bernh\u00f6ft's Bakery], which was from 1834 in the old houses at Bankastr\u00e6ti number 2. The name Bakarabrekka is no longer used for Bankastr\u00e6ti, but is still used of the grassy slope below Bernh\u00f6ftstorfan at the corner of Bankastr\u00e6ti and L\u00e6kjargata. The statue Vatnsberinn ('the water-carrier') by \u00c1smundur Sveinsson stands on the slope, along with a large outdoor chess set with pieces made by the sculptor J\u00f3n Gunnar \u00c1rnason. ==Public toilets== The street gives its name to the so-called Almenningssalerni\u00f0 N\u00falli\u00f0 ('Public Toilet Zero') or Bankastr\u00e6ti n\u00fall ('0 Bank Street'), a public toilet which is located at the bottom of Bankastr\u00e6ti before number 1. It is in two parts, the men's toilet on one side of the street and the women's on the other, underground, so only the entrance is visible at the surface. The toilets have been closed since 2006.Alda Kravec, 'High Streets And Piss Pots: An introduction to Einar M\u00e1r Gu\u00f0mundsson\u2019s new book \u2018Bankastr\u00e6ti N\u00fall\u2019', The Reykjav\u00edk Grapevine (August 12, 2011), http://grapevine.is/culture/art/2011/08/12/high-streets-and-piss-pots/. These toilets give their name to Einar M\u00e1r Gu\u00f0mundsson's 2009 book Bankastr\u00e6ti n\u00fall; reminiscing about what they were like around the 1980s, Einar M\u00e1r associates them with 'undirheimum, kulda, kynl\u00edfi, forvitni, bannhelgi, undarlegum manni \u00ed hv\u00edtum sloppi, \u00e1fengislykt, smokkum og hlandi, bl\u00f3\u00f0hlaunum augum, r\u00f3num a\u00f0 pissa' ('the underworld, cold, sex, curiosity, taboos, a strange man in a white coat, the smell of alcohol, condoms and urine, bloodshot eyes, drunkards pissing').Einar M\u00e1r Gu\u00f0mundsson, Bankastr\u00e6ti n\u00fall (Reykjav\u00edk: M\u00e1l og Menning, 2011), p. 27. ==Further reading== * Gu\u00f0n\u00fd Ger\u00f0ur Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir and Mj\u00f6ll Sn\u00e6sd\u00f3ttir, \u00deingholt: Bankastr\u00e6ti - \u00deingholtsstr\u00e6ti - Amtmannsst\u00edgur - Ing\u00f3lfsstr\u00e6ti (Reykjav\u00edk: \u00c1rb\u00e6jarsafn, 1985) ==References== Category:Shopping districts and streets in Iceland Category:Streets in Reykjav\u00edk Category:Tourist attractions in Iceland ",
