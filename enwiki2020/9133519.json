    "text": "Yerba Buena Center for the Arts (YBCA) is a multi-disciplinary contemporary arts center in San Francisco, California, United States. Located in Yerba Buena Gardens, YBCA features visual art, performance, and film/video that celebrates local, national, and international artists and the Bay Area's diverse communities. YBCA programs year-round in two landmark buildings\u2014the Galleries and Forum by Japanese architect Fumihiko Maki and the adjacent Theater by American architect James Stewart Polshek and Todd Schliemann. Betti-Sue Hertz served as Curator from 2008 through 2015. == History == The museum was conceived as part of a deal by mayor George Moscone with developers to \"set aside land and funds for cultural institutions such as museums, exhibits, and theaters\" for the redevelopment projects in South of Market, San Francisco. The museum was opened in 1993. ==Music== Yerba Buena Center for the Arts embraces many musical genres and styles. Not only does the center provide a stage for Bay Area instrumental and vocal musicians and ensembles, it also offers a sampling of musical practices from all over the world. Along with solo performances, YBCA also has invited various musical projects to use its facilities, such as the tribute to composer Elliott Carter in 2008Serinus, Jason Victor. \"Emerging from Sloth in San Francisco.\" American Record Guide, Mar/Apr 2009, Vol. 72 Issue 2, pp. 20-21, and the Long Now Foundation in 2010.\u201cYBCA Now // October 2010.\u201d Art Babble. Art Babble, n.d. Web. 13 Dec 2010. http://www.artbabble.org/video/ybca/ybca-now-october-2010 The connection between these various musical practices is the intent for social change through education provided by another culture or by creating a community around a purpose. Although month to month there are not many purely musical performances, music is often incorporated with other performing arts, such as dance or theater. ==Fine arts== leftIn addition to being a venue for musical performances, YBCA also acts as a non-collecting museum. The various art exhibits YBCA offers emphasize its celebration of both local and world art. For example, in 2008 the art group Royal Art Lodge presented their psychologically surrealist works, challenging the viewer using simple drawings and more pronounced techniques like cutups. YBCA not only holds specific art shows and exhibits but also is carefully aided by various artists in creating particular atmospheres for its spaces. For instance, Instant Coffee, another artist group, designed a lounge room within YBCA for visitors to simply sit and listen to records with a chic atmosphere, while Space 1026 created YBCA's mural, a showcase of social and physical dimensions.Janku, Laura Richard. \"Relational Aesthetics: Artist Groups and Their Groupies.\" ArtUS, May/Jun 2006, Issue 13. pp. 42-45. The YBCA museum currently has two semi-permanent fine arts exhibitions that will stand until the end of 2017. These exhibitions include Tanis Bruguera's \"Talking to Power\" and Damon Rich and Jae Shin's \"Space Brainz.\" ==Dance== Dance at YBCA includes various forms from many various cultures. In October 2008, Israeli choreographers Inbal Pinto and Avshalom Pollak presented their production of \"Shaker\" by combining ballet, modern dance, mime, and acrobatic techniques.Hecht, Elena. Pillot, Anna. Schmelkin, Carrie. Peters, Jen Thompson. \"Vital Signs.\" Dance Magazine. Oct 2008. Vol. 82, Issue 10. In addition to more collaborative art forms, YBCA also presents more classical forms of dance, such as ballet. Alonzo King held his company LINES Ballet at YBCA in November 2004, which centered on African American field recordings with various forms of music, narrative, and film playing in the background.Ulrigh, Allan. \"Alonzo King's Lines Ballet.\" Dance Magazine. Feb 2005. Vol. 79, Issue 2. ==Film/Video== Novellus Theater|alt=|left YBCA features all types of cinematic endeavors, including documentaries on a variety of subjects, art-house movies and foreign films. For instance, during the 2009 summer season, it showed documentaries dealing with female masochists (Graphic Sexual Horror), and industrial design (Objectified) while also presenting obscure movie topics, such as its show Winning Isn't Everything: A Tribute to 1970's Sports Film which included the movie The Cheerleaders.Hawley, Michael. \"Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Summer 2009.\" Jun 2009. http://film-415.blogspot.com/2009/06/yerba-buena- center-for-arts-summer-2009.html ==Live events== The center has been the site for product launches by Apple Inc., including iPods and the iPad. In 2019, it hosted the How I Built This Summit with Guy Raz. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Arts centers in California Category:South of Market, San Francisco Category:Art galleries in San Francisco Category:Contemporary art galleries in the United States Category:Music venues in San Francisco Category:Parks in San Francisco Category:Theatres in San Francisco Category:Museums in San Francisco Category:Arts organizations based in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Non-profit organizations based in San Francisco Category:Cultural infrastructure completed in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in California Category:1993 in San Francisco Category:Fumihiko Maki buildings Category:Modernist architecture in California ",
