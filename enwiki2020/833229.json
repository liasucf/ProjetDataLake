They were apparently referred to as the Studwells in the early 19th century.use in 21 March 1835 Welsh newspaper article )The Cambrian, 30 December 1809, p. 3 about the wreck of the sloop Spencer There are two main islands: Saint Tudwal's Island West (Welsh: Ynys Tudwal Fawr)() and Saint Tudwal's Island East (Welsh: Ynys Tudwal Fach) (), plus the Carreg y Trai rocks. The islands are known for their seal population. The western island houses the St Tudwal\u2019s Lighthouse, and the eastern has the remains of a priory. The western island reaches 144 feet (44 metres) and is the higher of the two. ==Saint Tudwal's Island East== Saint Tudwal's Island East () is a grass covered, kidney-shaped island, about in length and in width. It was owned by author Carla Lane until her death in May 2016. The highest point on the island is above sea level. It is located just over off the Ll\u0177n Peninsula in Gwynedd. The nearest settlement (apart from the lighthouse on Saint Tudwal's Island West) is Machroes. Small ships sail from the nearby town of Abersoch to take passengers to view the wildlife. The island is believed to be the original hermitage of Saint Tudwal, which is presumably where its name comes from. The remains of a priory, referred to in the 1291 tax rolls, can be found on its eastern side. ==Saint Tudwal's Island West== The West island was purchased by adventurer Bear Grylls and converted into a holiday home. On 22 August 2013 it was reported that he was facing a planning investigation by Gwynedd Council, after installing a slide into the sea.
