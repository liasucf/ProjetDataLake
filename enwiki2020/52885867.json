    "text": "Turning Forms (BH 166) is a concrete sculpture by Barbara Hepworth, one of her first public commissions, made in 1950 for the Festival of Britain. It was one of two Hepworth commissions for the Festival: the other was a sculpture of abstract standing figures, Contrapunctal Forms. The abstract work stands high. It comprises twisting loops of concrete, painted white, supported by a metal armature. It was exhibited at the Festival of Britain near the Thameside Restaurant, on a motorised plinth that slowly rotated once each two minutes. Hepworth returned to a similar theme with a similarly-named drawing in 1957, held by Kettle's Yard in Cambridge. The sculpture was acquired by Hertfordshire County Council: at the time, the Council had embarked on an ambitious programme to build new schools, and acquired artworks to decorate them: for example, a cast of Henry Moore\u2019s Family Group is on display at Barclay Academy in Stevenage. Hepworth's sculpture has been sited at The Marlborough Science Academy in St Albans since its opening in 1953. ==References== * Turning Forms, barbarahepworth.org.uk * Turning Forms, barbarahepworth.org.uk * Hepworth Statue, Marlborough Academy * Turning Form, 1957, Kettle\u2019s Yard, Cambridge Category:Sculptures by Barbara Hepworth Category:Buildings and structures in St Albans Category:1950 sculptures Category:Modernist sculpture Category:Concrete sculptures Category:Abstract sculpture Category:Festival of Britain ",
