    "text": "Ben Jordan (1 April 1873 -18 January 1945), was a British featherweight boxer who took the British World Featherweight Championship on 29 May 1899 in a ninth round knockout against Harry Greenfield at the National Sporting Club in London, England. On 10 October 1899, Eddie Santry overtook the title defeating him at the Lenox Club in New York in a sixteenth of twenty round knockout. ==Early life== Ben Jordan was born on 1 April 1873 in Bermondsey, London, the son of an English Minister.Fleischer, Nat, Andre, Sam, Collins, Nigel, Rafael, Dan, An Illustrated History of Boxing, (January 2002) Citadel Press, pg. 339 According to one source, Jordan attended University College in London around 1890 at the age of seventeen and may have been a divinity student. His decision to pursue boxing as a career was not met with approval by his father. He fought a number of exhibitions around London prior to his completing his University education which caused a further rift from his strict father, and likely interfered with his completing his University studies.\"The Roped Arena, A Clergyman's Son\", The Shippenburg News, Shippenburg, Pennsylvania, pg. 1, 23 September 1898 He started his better publicized professional boxing career around the age of twenty-one by winning three short preliminary fights at the National Sporting Club in Convent Garden London on 28 January 1895 against Jack Gray, Sid Phillips, and Jim Whelan. ==Taking the British Featherweight Title in London== Jordan first challenged for the British Featherweight Title against American Tommy White of Chicago on 29 November 1897 at the National Sporting Club in London, England, winning in an eighteenth round disqualification. It was White's first appearance in England. They fought for a purse of 700 pounds or $3500 with a side bet of roughly $1,000.The Pittsburgh Post, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 6, 30 November 1897 Jordan met British boxer Eddie Curry for the British Featherweight Title on 4 April 1898 again at London's National Sporting Club, winning in a seventeenth round disqualification in a scheduled twenty round match. According to the Los Angeles Herald, a purse of 300 British pounds was at stake, and the World Bantamweight championship was being contested.\"A British Victory\", Los Angeles Herald, pg. 1, 5 April 1898 ===Defeating George Dixon in New York=== George Dixon On 28 May 1898, Jordan arrived in New York from England aboard the RMS Lucania to face American challengers. The Luciana was one of the fastest, largest, and most luxurious passenger liners at the time. Jordan was 24 years old and fresh from his knockouts of Eddie Curry and Tommy White. He had been able to continue his training during his voyage including sparring and hitting the bag as well as daily runs aboard Luciana's spacious decks.\"They Met Ben Jordan\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 11, 29 May 1898 In a close bout, he defeated the great Canadian featherweight George Dixon on 1 July 1898 at New York's Lenox Club in a classic twenty five round points decision by referee Charley White. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, \"Dixon did the leading but unlike many of those who had previously met the little Colored fighter, Jordan went at him and mixed it all the time.\" The bout was close, and many believed a draw would have been a better decision. Jordan was down on his hands and knees in the seventh from a blow by Dixon, but the bout contained relatively few knockdowns and no counts. The bout ended with a flurry by Dixon, but the referee did not feel it adequate to award him the decision. The Chronicle actually believed Dixon had the edge in the fighting.\"Referee and Sports Disagree\", San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco, California, pg. 5, 2 July 1898 The Los Angeles Times also agreed the bout was close and that \"Both men fought well and there was little to choose between them.\"\"Donated by Dixon\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 4, 2 July 1898 ==Taking the British World Featherweight Title== On 29 May 1899, Jordan took the British World Featherweight Championship in a ninth round knockout against Harry Greenfield at the National Sporting Club in London, England. At the time, the title was not recognized as a World Title in the United States, but it is listed by many sources today as a British World Title. ==Unsuccessful attempts to match Jordan with American champions== Attempts to match Jordan with the American champion Young Corbett II were not successful. The Young Corbett bout would have taken place in San Francisco around November 1903, and would have been a Featherweight World Championship.Corbett fight would have been World Championship in \"Young Corbett and Ben Jordan Matched\", The Evening World, New York, New York, pg. 1, 16 October 1903\"Curley Ready\", Oakland Tribune, Oakland, California, pg. 5, 10 June 1903 Talk of matching Jordan with the great American Terry McGovern around 1899 also never came to fruition. McGovern's representatives probably turned down the English fight as he was offered a purse of $2,500 after he had received offers as high as $15,000 to fight Young Corbett II in San Francisco.\"M'Govern\", The Cincinnati Enquirer, Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 4, 30 November 1899McGovern had been offered more in \"Invitation for Terry to Fight in England\", Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, pg. 16, 23 October 1902 ==Losing the British World Featherweight Title== On 10 October 1899, Eddie Santry overtook the title defeating him at the Lenox Club in New York in a sixteenth of twenty round knockout. Jordan was knocked out by a \"clean right hand swing to the jaw\". Santry achieved the knockout in a little less than two minutes into the sixteenth round.\"Jordan's Colors Lowered\", San Francisco Call, San Francisco, California, pg. 1, 11 October 1899 Until the knockout Jordan had been outpointing Santry, though he had been knocked down in the first round. Jordan had tired some by the sixteenth round.\"Ben Jordan Knocked Out\", The Morning Post, Raleigh, North Carolina, pg. 1, 11 October 1899 One source wrote that \"until the knockout Jordan was far ahead on points but Santry's blows were truer to the mark and won him the battle.\" Santry had a slight advantage in height, though Jordan was a 2 to 1 favorite in the betting.\"Santry a Surprise\", The Scranton Republican, Scranton, Pennsylvania, pg. 1, 11 October 1899 ==Last trip to America and mid boxing career== On 28 May 1900, he defeated American boxer Tommy Hogan at the National Sporting Club in London in an impressive fourth round knockout for a substantial purse of around $3,500.\"Hogan to Meet Jordan\", The Times, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pg. 8, 16 May 1900 On 18 August 1900, he again arrived in New York aboard the RMS Lucania expecting to meet the great Terry McGovern in a fight that would draw a substantial audience, but his hopes were dashed when McGovern's representatives chose not to face the British champion.\"Ben Jordan Here\", The Courier-Journal, Louisville, Kentucky, pg. 6, 20 August 1900 McGovern also claimed to have been tied up with acting engagements, much to the consternation of Jordan, who wrote a letter of protest to a London newspaper, claiming \"he went to America to meet a fighter but he found him to be an actor who had no time to waste on ring engagements.\"The Saint Paul Globe, St. Paul, Minnesota, pg. 10, 30 September 1900 Pedlar Palmer On 20 June 1901, Jordan was reported as suffering from a bout of malarial fever and was unable to make another planned trip to the United States. He had suffered from the same illness during a previous trip to the United States, and it may have affected his decision to refrain from boxing abroad after 1900.\"Ben Jordan Not Well\", The Ottawa Journal, Ottawa, Canada, pg. 13, 29 June 1901 On 23 June 1902, he defeated Kid McFadden at the National Sporting Club in London in a fifteenth round knockout. He would defeat George Dixon for a second time on 2 May 1903 in London in a six round points decision. He successfully defended the English Featherweight Title on 12 December 1904 against champion Pedlar Palmer in an important bout at the National Sporting Club in London in a fifteen round points decision. He continued to box until 1907 meeting Johnny Summers three times in 1906 and 1907 in London for short three round no contest bouts. He died on 18 January 1945, at the age of 71, apparently not seriously affected by previous bouts of what was reported as malarial fever. ==Boxing achievements== ==References== ==External links== * Category:World featherweight boxing champions Category:World boxing champions Category:1873 births Category:1945 deaths Category:English male boxers Category:Featherweight boxers Category:People from Bermondsey Category:Boxers from Greater London ",
