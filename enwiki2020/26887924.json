He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross of Nazi Germany. Hartmann was killed on 26 January 1943 during the Battle of Stalingrad and was posthumously promoted to General of the Infantry. Before his death Hartmann stated, \"I intend to go to my infantry in the front line...I will seek death among their ranks.
