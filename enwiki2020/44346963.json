The newscast delivers the most recent news and current affairs issues in Filipino language. Initially created to deliver news from North Central Luzon, the newscast expanded its coverage into Ilocos Region and Central Luzon as part of GMA Regional's plans to strengthen its local news division. The newscast is primarily anchored by CJ Torida, Joanne Ponsoy, and Jasmin Gabriel-Galban. Presented from the GMA TV Dagupan studios, Balitang Amianan delivers news headlines about the current events and feature segments in the provinces in Ilocos Region, namely Pangasinan, La Union, Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur, where Ilocano and Pangasinan were spoken by the interviewees; the provinces of Benguet, Ifugao, Mountain Province and Abra in the Cordillera Administrative Region; as well as parts of Central Luzon such as Zambales, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga and Aurora, where Kapampangan was de facto spoken by the intervieweess. The newscast airs from Monday to Friday from 5:00 PM to 5:30 PM on GMA TV-10 Dagupan, GMA TV-5 Ilocos Norte and GMA TV-48 Ilocos Sur. Balitang Amianan is also re-aired for national viewers under GMA News TV's late night block \"GMA Regional TV Strip\" on a weekly basis. It airs every Monday at 11:00 PM since May 18, 2020. The program also airs worldwide on GMA News TV International. == History == ===As Balitang Amianan (2008-2014)=== It first aired on Channel 10 in Dagupan and anchored by former anchor for TV Patrol Dagupan/TV Patrol Laoag (now TV Patrol North Luzon) and Dateline Northern Luzon (now defunct) Jorge Guerrero. In June 2012, Jorge Guerrero left the show and moved to GMA Ilocos to become the solo anchor of Balitang Ilokano (later 24 Oras Ilokano). He is replaced by CJ Torida. The channel's biggest expose so far is about a casino which was established in Poro, San Fernando City, La Union. To strengthen its commitment of bringing the latest, most credible and most comprehensive news from the region, in July 2013, Balitang Amianan started its international broadcast on GMA News TV International alongside other newscasts Balitang Bisdak and 24 Oras Davao (now One Mindanao).Regional news now more accessible to Pinoys abroad via GMA News TV International The newscast's first incarnation ended its 6-year run on November 7, 2014. ===As 24 Oras North Central Luzon/24 Oras Amianan (2014-2016)=== Following changes of its now-main newscast 24 Oras, Balitang Amianan was rebranded as 24 Oras North Central Luzon effective November 10, 2014. On August 31, 2015, 24 Oras North Central Luzon retitled as 24 Oras Amianan (after Ratsada 24 Oras of GMA Iloilo since July 20, now relaunched since August 27, 2018 as One Western Visayas) with an additional segment called \"Trivia ni Araguy\". 24 Oras Amianan aired its last telecast on January 29, 2016. ===As Balitang Amianan (2016-present)=== On February 1, 2016, Balitang Amianan returned on the air after more than a year hiatus. On April 18, 2016, Faye Centeno joined as Torida's co-anchor in the newscast. Since October 3, 2016, Balitang Amianan started its simulcast on GMA TV-5 Ilocos Norte, GMA TV-7 Abra and GMA TV-48 Ilocos Sur as it expands its coverage area to the Ilocos Region and some parts of the Cordillera Administrative Region and Central Luzon. On January 2, 2017, the newscast updated its opening billboard and lower third graphics similar to 24 Oras, together with other newscasts Balitang Bisdak and One Mindanao. ====Relaunch==== On October 23, 2017, Balitang Amianan relaunched with a brand new set and segments (including the well-known Anto Tan?), as well as theme music and OBB, similar to its sister regional news program One Mindanao, GMA Regional TV's newscast for Mindanao stations, which was launched two months earlier. Longtime correspondent Joanne Ponsoy joined Torida and Centeno to anchor the newscast. In July 2018, longtime reporter Jasmin Gabriel-Galban joined Torida and Ponsoy on the anchor team. She replaced Faye Centeno, who left the newscast. On July 29, 2019, the newscast tweaks a minor revision of its titlecard, changing its font color to green, reflecting it with its co-produced national newscast GMA Regional TV Weekend News, which was launched on July 27. A week after, on August 5, 2019, Balitang Amianan updated their graphics and introduced new opening titles patterned with its co-produced national newscast (featuring the sceneries of the program's coverage area). The newscast had a more relaxed set-up with couches instead of the tables and chairs that viewers usually see on typical newscasts intending to be an extension of viewers' living room, further connecting the news anchors and the viewers. Balitang Amianan will open its doors to the public every Friday as it invites viewers to participate as live studio audience.Balitang Amianan elevates local news reporting with new look, beefed-up content Balitang Amianan began to accommodate the reports from Rhayne Palino from Camarines Sur, GMA Bicol's sole correspondent. The station formerly produced its own newscasts Baretang Bikol/24 Oras Bikol until 2015. ==Personalities== ===Anchors=== * CJ Torida - Main Anchor & Senior Desk Manager * Joanne Ponsoy - Co-anchor, Correspondent, & also fill-in anchor for Torida * Jasmin Gabriel-Galban - Co-anchor Correspondent & also fill-in anchor for Torida & Ponsoy ===Correspondents=== * Glam Calicdan-Dizon - Program Manager * Marjorie Padua - Supervising Producer * Russel Simorio * Ivy Hernando - Ilocos Sur correspondent; formerly with the now-defunct 24 Oras Ilokano * Claire Lacanilao * King Guevarra * Trace Justine De Leon - Senior Desk Manager * Rhayne Palino - Camarines Sur correspondent ===Former personalities=== * Jorge Guerrero * Jessica Manwi-it\u2020 \\- (died on June 2016) * Charmaine Alvarado * Lilian Bautista-Tiburcio * Mike Sabado * Hazel Cawaing * Jeeson Alamar * Peha Lagao * Charisse Victorio * Joyce Segui * Anthony Ron Allister \"Ka Tonying\" Ta\u00f1edo a.k.a.
