    "text": "Carlos Suri\u00f1ach (or Carles Suri\u00f1ach)Carles Surinach i Wrokona (; March 6, 1915 \u2013 November 12, 1997) was a Spanish-born composer and conductor. ==Early Life== Carlos Suri\u00f1ach was born in Barcelona, Spain on March 6 of 1915. His Austrian-Polish mother was a house pianist, introducing him to music at a young age. He began playing the piano between ages 5-6 and started studying music around age 10. His father was involved in business as a stockbroker. He did not approve of Suri\u00f1ach pursing music and confided in their other son who followed in his footsteps of business. He said that he was never serious about music but always loved it. Taught by his mother through age 14, he studied piano and music theory at the Caminals Academy of Music. He held conducting posts at the Orquestra Simf\u00f2nica de Barcelona and the Gran Teatre del Liceu. He studied composition and orchestration under Enrique Morera, who is the director of Barcelona Conservatory. He then went to Madrid, followed by Germany where he studied in Berlin with Max Trapp and Richard Strauss, taking five of Strauss' seminars. In 1944 he returned to Barcelona as new conductor of the Barcelona Philharmonic Orchestra where his opera El mozo que cas\u00f3 con mujer brava and \"Passacaglia-Sinfonia\" was premiered. By his mid 20s, he transform from an inside composer to an outside composer, with the help of the opera house and conductor position. ==Career== In late 1950, Carlos Suri\u00f1ach emigrated to the United States, in hopes of becoming a successful published composer. World War II just recently finished and European publishers were frantically republishing previous music of the greats: Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Chapin, etc. Full of ambition, he first stopped in New York to conduct an orchestra. In May of 1951, a concert featuring the New York's most elite artists was held at the Museum of Modern Art. Works of his, Martha Graham, Israel's Batsheva, Jose Lemon, Balanchine, Doris Humphrey, and many others were all featured in the concert. His first lively premiere of Ritmo Jondo, repeated itself as requested by the audience. The composition was 6 minutes in duration, written for the clarinet, trumpet, xylophone, timpani, and 3 hand clappers. Carlos Suri\u00f1ach's work was unknown until this point. The performance pivoted his career to an upward hill. Only a week after the concert, Doris Humphrey and Jose Limon came to his apartment to request and discuss using his compositions in a ballet. The successful collaboration was showcased in April of 1953 at the Alvin Theatre. He wrote the 20 minute-long work for a broadway orchestra made of 23 musicians. Near after, he worked more closely with Doris Humphrey to create second version of the ballet. He conducted numerous recordings with MGM Records. Years following the premiere of \"Ritmo Jondo\", the modern dancer and choreographer, Martha Graham, approached Suri\u00f1ach. She had purchased a record with one of his tracks, where she proceeded to choreograph an 8-minute piece to without Suri\u00f1ach's knowledge. Although this was illegal, he turned a blind eye when he became hysterical from watching the piece. He was full of passion while watching the piece and admired Graham for her brilliance. In addition to using the single track, Graham requested to work with him, elongating the piece and adding more pieces of orchestra. He composed three ballet scores Martha Graham: Embattled Garden (1958), Acrobats of God (1960), and The Owl and the Pussycat (1978). Martha Graham was given a Capezio Prize for \"Acrobats of God\" and gave him a massive commission for his compositional work. It is also impressive that the production of \"The Owl and the Pussycat\" came together in a short 6 months. Another collaboration \"Agathe's Tale\", choreographed by Paul Taylor, was premiered in 1967. He also composed Feast of Ashes for the Joffrey Ballet. Showcased on numerous occasions by the Louisville Symphony and Orchestra, under Rockefeller, conductor's commissions were $1 million each. Reworking original electronic music, Suri\u00f1ach composed \"Chronic\" the ballet, performed at the Mark Hellinger Theatre in 1973. His Harp Concerto was commissioned by Charles Royce for his daughter Maria. The premiere was in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1978, with Nicanor Zabaleta playing the solo part. The concerto was then performed by Maria Royce at Interlochen. The Surinach Harp Concerto has not been played since. Traditional elements of flamenco, spanish culture, and American-born music makes Suri\u00f1ach a unique composer. He became a U.S. citizen in 1959. Surinach also orchestrated part of Isaac Alb\u00e9niz's piano suite Iberia. His notable students include Louis W. Ballard. He worked with many choreographers including Doris Humphrey, Jose Limon, Martha Graham, Paul Taylor, Robert Coin, Antonio at the Ballets of Madrid, and more. Surinach died in New Haven, Connecticut, United States, on November 12, 1997. The BMI Foundation sponsors The Carlos Surinach Awards and Commissioning Programs, which recognizes talented emerging young musicians for their service to American music and funds the creation of new works by former winners of the BMI Student Composer Awards. The program was established by a bequest from Surinach. The final \"ch\" in Surinach's surname is pronounced \"k\", following ancient Catalan orthography (in modern orthography this phoneme is rendered with a \"c\"). The \"ch\" ending is commonly found in Catalan surnames, many of which retain this spelling. Also, before Surinach left Spain, his surname was spelled \"Suri\u00f1ach\", with a tilde over the \"n\". He eventually dropped this tilde, but saw the original spelling used on concert posters whenever he visited Spain. ==Works== * Symphony No. 1, Sinfon\u00eda Passacaglia (1945) * El mozo que cas\u00f3 con mujer brava (1948), opera * Symphony No. 2 (1949\u201350) * Sinfonietta Flamenca (1953) * Ritmo Jondo (1953), ballet * Hollywood Carnival (1954) * Fandango (1954) * Feria Magica (1956), overture * Concertino for Piano, Strings and Cymbals (1956) * Symphony No. 3, Sinfon\u00eda Chica (1957) * Embattled Garden (1958), ballet * Paeans and Dances of Heathen Iberia (1959) * Sonatina (1959), for solo guitar * Acrobats of God (1960), ballet * Symphonic Variations for Orchestra (1962) * Feast of Ashes (1962), ballet * Cantata of St. John (1962) * Songs of the Soul (1964), for chorus * Drama Jondo (1965) * Melorhythmic Dramas (1966) * Flamenco Cyclothymia (1967) * Via Crucis: a cycle of fifteen saetas (1970), for chorus and guitar * Concerto for piano and orchestra (1973) * Prayers (1973), for solo voice * Chronique (1974), ballet * Celebraciones Medievales (1977), for chorus * Concerto for String Orchestra (1978) * The Owl and the Pussycat (1978), ballet * Harp Concerto (1978) * Violin Concerto (1980) * Melismas sinf\u00f3nicos (1985) * Quimera (1989), ballet * Double concerto for flute, double bass and chamber orchestra (1990) ==References== https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carlos-Surinach ==External links== https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carlos-Surinach * Carlos Surinach page from Schirmer site * Carlos Surinach Commissions page from BMI site * BMI Surinach collection, 1900s-1996 Music Division, The New York Public Library. * ===Interviews=== *Carlos Surinach interview, February 15, 1987 Category:1915 births Category:1997 deaths Category:20th-century classical composers Category:Spanish classical composers Category:Catalan composers Category:American male classical composers Category:American classical composers Category:American opera composers Category:Ballet composers Category:Spanish emigrants to the United States Category:Musicians from Barcelona Category:20th-century Spanish musicians Category:20th-century American composers Category:20th-century American male musicians ",
