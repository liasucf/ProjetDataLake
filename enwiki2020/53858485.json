So, the public starts shifting to the forest along with chief minister Paramanandayya (C.S.R) who associates them as disciples and makes a hamlet. Meanwhile, in the fort, a wrestling competition is held in which a young & energetic guy Chandrasena (Akkineni Nageswara Rao) wins but Prachandasena identifies him as the son of a traitor, exiled from the kingdom. So, he makes him prison when Leela (Lakshmi Rajyam) daughter of Vijayasena falls and secretly meets him. Spotting it, enraged Prachandasena torments, Leela. Thereafter, the man in a veil relieves Chandrasena even Leela along with Hema (Girija) daughter of Prachandasena escapes from the fort. Parallelly, Vijayasena becomes terminally ill, before dying, he reaches Paramanandayya's hamlet and reveals regarding a secret hidden treasure. Eventually, in search of Leela Chandrasena also lands at the hamlet and accompanies them. On the other side, Paramanandayya's disciples create a lot of nuisance. After a comic tale, Paramanandayya feels pity for their innocence, leaves that place and signs in to a cowherds' colony where he meets Leela & Hema and divulges the entire story. At present, Paramanandayya determines to get back the kingdom, so, plays with wit by informing Prachandasena about the hidden treasure. Being cognizant of it, avaricious Prachandasena moves with his army where Chandrasena attacks them with the disciples. Fortunately, the man in the veil also arrives, he stabs out Prachandasena and he too hits him.
