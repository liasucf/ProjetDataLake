    "text": "Boswellia ameero is a species of flowering plant in the Burseraceae family. It is endemic to the island of Socotra in Yemen, common locally in arid, partly deciduous forests; however, populations are fragmentary, with aged, seldom regenerating trees being dominant. Also, the habitat of B. ameero may be degrading. Flowers of B. ameero vary; in some populations they are bright pink, in others, pale pink. Boswellia ameero is sometimes used for its resin. ==References== ==External links== *Original description of species in Latin, by Balfour (Proc. Roy. Soc.
