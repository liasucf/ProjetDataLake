    "text": "John \"Jack\" Marshall Lee (born 2 September 1950) is an American mathematician, specializing in differential geometry. Lee graduated from Princeton University with a bachelor's degree in 1972, then became a systems programmer (at Texas Instruments from 1972 to 1974 and at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in 1974\u20131975) and a teacher at Wooster School in Danbury, Connecticut in 1975\u20131977. He continued his studies at Tufts University in 1977\u20131978. He received his doctorate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1982 under the direction of Richard Melrose with dissertation Higher asymptotics of the complex Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation and geometry of CR manifolds. From 1982 to 1987 Lee was an assistant professor at Harvard University. At the University of Washington he became in 1987 an assistant professor, in 1989 an associate professor, and in 1996 a full professor. His research deals with, among other topics, the Yamabe problem, geometry of and analysis on CR manifolds, and differential geometry questions of general relativity (such as the constraint equations in the initial value problem of Einstein equations and existence of Einstein metrics on manifolds). In 2012 he received, jointly with David Jerison, the Stefan Bergman Prize from the American Mathematical Society. Lee created a mathematical software package named Ricci for performing tensor calculations in differential geometry. Ricci, named in honor of Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and completed in 1992, consists of 7000 lines of Mathematica code. It was chosen for inclusion in the MathSource library of Mathematica packages supported by Wolfram Research. ==Major publications== * Lee, John M.
