After the partition of India in 1947, he moved to India while his family stayed back in erstwhile East Pakistan and now Bangladesh. Following the usual practice of his family he was sent to Ichapur, West Bengal to live with his uncle for further studies. Due to his excellent academic performance he got a scholarship and admission into the prestigious Presidency College and a place to stay in the Ramakrishna Mission which was founded by Swami Vivekananda. The mission offered him free board and lodging in their Students\u2019 Home in exchange of part-time work with the Home and periodical service in the slum areas of North Calcutta. He organized and administered the Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur, West Bengal during 1960-66. He was awarded the Ph.D. degree in Economics from Jadavpur University in 1965. After Ph.D. he joined the Iowa State University, U.S.A. as a Post-Doctoral Researcher.

During his work at the UNESCO IIEP, he worked on the education systems of 77 countries of the world and directed the largest Graduate Employment Survey in the world recorded until 1995. He helped countries of all continents with completely different political systems, to design their higher education strategies. During Cold War, when Poland had a communist regime with central planning system, the Government of Poland, for the first time, accepted the findings of a study under his direction that demonstrated the inadequacy of the central planning system practiced in the Communist world. Poland allowed the results to be published in 1978 within the country. Similarly, he also succeeded in convincing capitalist countries like Philippines and Republic of Korea to change their strategies towards more egalitarian and just distribution of opportunities. ==Contributions to India== After retirement from UNESCO in 1998 Dr. Sanyal decided to offer his services free of charge to India thus he took over as the Director of the Maison de l\u2019Inde in 1999.
