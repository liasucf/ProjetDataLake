    "text": "The MPM-10 (Montr\u00e9al Pneumatic Material 2010), also known as the Azur, is the third and newest generation of rubber-tired rolling stock used on the Montreal Metro in Canada. They are produced by a consortium of Bombardier Transportation and Alstom since 2014. The first MPM-10 train entered into service on the Orange Line/Line 2 on February 7, 2016 and replaced the entire first-generation MR-63 fleet in 2018. == History == In May 2006, the Government of Quebec announced the negotiation of a $1.2 billion contract to replace the MR-63 fleet of 336 cars, then designated as MR-08. Alstom voiced its dismay over directly awarding the contract (to Bombardier) without a bidding process. Negotiations between the STM and Bombardier were ongoing until 2007. The negotiations focused on the project's cost controls, terms of contract, train specifications and warranty. If negotiations had failed, the Quebec government and the STM would have reverted to a bidding process. On 10 January 2008, Quebec Superior Court Judge Joel Silcoff rendered his decision regarding Alstom's filing of legal action against the Quebec government's Ministry of Transportation. The latter sought to bypass the bidding process, citing that Bombardier was the only domestic candidate capable of fulfilling the eventual contract. Silcoff ruled in favour of Alstom, enabling the company to bid on the contract. On 6 February 2008, the Government of Quebec decided to begin the bidding process, which would serve to save time, delaying delivery of the first trains by 9 to 12 months. In December 2009, CSR Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive expressed interest in bidding for the MR-08 contract citing a cheaper price than its competitors, and proposed an entirely steel- wheeled fleet of vehicles as opposed to the specified rubber-tired vehicles, citing advances in technology that gave steel wheels an advantage. CSR Zhuzhou Locomotive also proposed the construction of a factory in Quebec, creating up to 1,000 jobs and meeting the 60% Canadian content requirement. Spanish company CAF also expressed interest in the project, citing their experience in building rubber-tyred trains. However, the STM subsequently rejected both proposals. In October 2010, the Quebec government officially gave the contract to the Bombardier-Alstom consortium, valued at . Bombardier expected the new cars to begin entering revenue service by February 2014, with deliveries continuing through 2018. In May 2013, the STM finished preparing the tunnels for to the reception of the first test train. This work included grinding concrete on some 200m of tunnel, where laser measurements indicated that scraping might occur due to the new trains' softer suspension. The first prototype train was unveiled in late 2013, and was delivered in April 2014. Tests of the prototype revealed several incompatibilities with Montr\u00e9al's infrastructure, including insufficient electrical power. In January 2015 Bombardier suspended production for six months because of delays with the completion of the automated train control software . In January 2015, production of new Azurs was temporarily halted due to software installation and financing issues. As of April 2015, only 4 fully functional MPM-10 trains had been delivered to the STM, while 28 more cars had been assembled out of 468 sold before production was halted. Bombardier blamed one of the subcontractors responsible for the automatic driving controls on the new trains for the delay. By the end of 2015, the issues were resolved and the trains remained on track to be completed by the 2018 deadline date. After six months of vigorous testing, the first of the new cars entered revenue service at 10 am on February 7, 2016, departing from Henri-Bourassa station towards C\u00f4te-Vertu. On 14 January 2017, the STM removed all trainsets from circulation after finding unusual damage to the negative collector shoe due to unusual lateral forces being applied to the shoe and shoe mount. The trains were being brought back into service, starting January 28, 2017. On 14 August 2017, the first Azur deployed on the Green Line, for testing. This test phase aimed to \"analyze the behavior of the train on this line, with the load that the customers on board the train\". As of October 2017, two Azur trains run on the Green Line, with additional trains expected to be added in the future. In February 2018, the Montreal Gazatte website confirmed the delivery of 18 free additional cars or two new trainsets bringing the total of trains to 54 from the original contract. By May 2018, 43 sets of Azur had been delivered, effectively replacing the entire MR-63 fleet. On 28 May 2018, the STM announced that the Quebec government had allocated funds for an increase of the MPM-10 base order, to include an additional 153. This additional order would replace a portion of the MR-73 fleet, starting with the older and less reliable cars of that series. == Specifications == The 486 new cars, arranged in 54 nine-car sets, feature full-width open-gangways between the cars which can be occupied by passengers, resulting in higher train capacities than previous trains. The MPM-10 trains are equipped with an air suspension system, larger windows and doors, and wheelchair spaces, although the majority of Metro stations are not yet wheelchair-accessible. In the cabin, the trains also feature more natural lighting, high definition televisions, a new PA system and surveillance cameras.STM The MPM-10 uses an Alstom Optonix IGBT- VVVF traction system assembled in the United States. Improved ventilation is also featured; however, as with Montreal's previous generation rolling stock, cars are not air conditioned. Instead they are equipped with adjustable passenger force ventilation systems which deploy outside air into the train fast to create a cooler environment. The MPM-10 trains, however, maintain the same maximum speed as the former MR-63, and the current MR-73 trains, . Given the higher capacity of the MPM-10, the trains are heavier than the outgoing MR-63s at 238 t (26.4 t per car). ==Lines serviced== Green Line (2017-) Orange Line (2016-) === Future services === Blue Line ===Formation=== Currently (') {| class=\"wikitable\" !
