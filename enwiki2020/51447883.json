The company was launched in April 2016 after Univision bought out Disney's stake in Fusion through the Fusion Media Network joint venture between Univision & Disney-ABC. While Univision is focused on serving Hispanic America in Spanish, FMG is the company's multi-platform, English language division targeting young adults. == Operations == The Root, an online magazine on African-American culture, was acquired by Univision in 2015. It was eventually placed within FMG. In January 2016, The Onion was acquired, along with its sibling properties. Univision Story House was introduced in May 2016 as the content development and production unit of Univision, but to be managed by FMG. In August 2016, FMG acquired the online properties of Gawker Media, excluding Gawker.com, and renamed the company Gizmodo Media Group. In July 2018, it was reported that Univision plans on selling the Gizmodo Media Group and The Onion. In April 2019, Gizmodo Media Group and The Onion were sold to Great Hill Partners.
