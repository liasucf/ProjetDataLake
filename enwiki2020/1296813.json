The red line denotes the border between them from 1899 to 1905. The green area is Barotseland. North-Western Rhodesia, in south central Africa, was a territory administered from 1891 until 1899 under charter by the British South Africa Company. In 1890 the British South Africa Company signed a treaty with King Lewanika of the Barotse, one the most powerful traditional rulers in the territory. The treaty did not confer protectorate status on the territory, as only the British government could confer that status. Nonetheless, the charter gave the territory protection. The territory consisted of the western half of present-day Zambia up to the Kafue River, its border with North-Eastern Rhodesia. Later the border between the two chartered territories was moved east, but the distinction did not have any great implications. In 1899 North- Western Rhodesia was amalgamated with Barotseland to form Barotziland-North- Western Rhodesia, an official British protectorate.Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia Order in Council, 1899, S.R.O. 1901 No. 567Commonwealth and Colonial Law by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 753 In 1911 Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia was amalgamated with North-Eastern Rhodesia to form Northern Rhodesia. Today this is the Republic of Zambia. ==See also== * British South Africa Company * Company rule in Rhodesia * Rhodesia (name) * Northern Rhodesia ==References== Category:Northern Rhodesia Category:British South Africa Company Category:Former British colonies and protectorates in Africa Category:History of Rhodesia Category:History of Zambia Category:States and territories established in 1891 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1899 Category:1891 establishments in Africa Category:1899 disestablishments in Africa Category:1891 establishments in the British Empire Category:1899 disestablishments in the British Empire ",
