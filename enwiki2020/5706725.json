To meet the new demand for combat handguns, Izhevsk Mechanical Plant developed a series of pistol in various calibers. In November 2000 one MP-445 pistol was presented at \"INTERPOLITEX-2000\" Arms exhibition in Moscow, and it was offered for export\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0410\u043c\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043d. \"\u0411\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0440\u0430\" \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u0442 \"\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0430\" // \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b \"\u041e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0435\", \u2116 9, 2000. \u0441\u0442\u0440.38-43.

The MP-445 model has fully adjustable sights zeroed for both elevation and windage, while MP-445C has fixed, iron sights. It holds 15 rounds and readily accepts tactical flashlights and laser aiming devices.
