    "text": "KCMN-LD, virtual channel 42 (UHF digital channel 28), is a low-powered Decades-affiliated television station licensed to Topeka, Kansas, United States. The station is owned by DTV America Corporation, as part of a duopoly with The Country Network affiliate KAJF-LD (channel 21, also licensed to Topeka). Although the city of license is Topeka, the station's signal does not reach that city, for its transmitter, which is shared with KAJF-LD, is located on the southeastern side of Kansas City just off 58th Street near the exit 65 interchange of Interstate 435.http://rabbitears.info/contour.php?appid=2003113 It now identifies itself as a Kansas City-based station rather than in its licensed city. ==History== The Federal Communications Commission issued the construction permit for the station, under the calls of K38MN-D, on February 22, 2011. The current callsign was adopted on December 4, 2015. Upon signing on in summer 2016, the station became DTV America's second low-power station in the Kansas City area as they signed on KAJF-LD sometime before. KCMN became DTV America's third Kansas-licensed station after locally based KAJF and Pittsburg, Kansas-licensed KPJO-LP in the Joplin, Missouri area. In April 2017, Cheddar news TV channel started broadcasting over the air with DTV America affiliating five stations including KCMN with the network. Dunkin' Donuts, a Cheddar advertiser, was handing out free digital antennas at events in the stations' markets to publicize the over the air launch. ==Digital channels== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
