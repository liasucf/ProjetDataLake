    "text": "Emily Ramshaw is an American journalist and news executive. She is the co- founder with Amanda Zamora of The 19th, a national news outlet reporting on the ongoing fight by American women for equality in all aspects of society. The name is a reference to the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which acknowledged the right of women to vote, and prohibits the states and the federal government from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex, and which took effect on August 26, 1920. Prior to founding The 19th, Ramshaw was editor-in-chief of The Texas Tribune. In 2016, Ramshaw was elected to the Pulitzer Prize Board. Ramshaw has said that she first thought of creating a national newsroom that would report on women through the lens of politics and policy in 2016, telling U.S. News & World Report that \"It was during the 2016 election, and we were seeing so many conversations around electability and likeability, which are two words that are basically all they used for women.\" Funders of The 19th include American philanthropist and Craigslist founder Craig Newmark, who donated $500,000 in its early stages; and Kathryn Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's daughter-in-law, who has invested $1 million. As of August 2020 the project has raised a total of $8.5 million. == References == Category:American women journalists Category:Women newspaper editors Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ",
