Mount Mihara's major eruption in 1986 saw lava fountains up to high. The eruption had a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 3, and involved a central vent eruption, radial fissure eruption, explosive eruption, lava flows, and a lava lake eruption. There was also a 16 km high subplinian plume. All of the island's 12,000 inhabitants were evacuated by dozens of vessels consisting of both the military and civilian volunteers. The most recent eruption was in 1990. ==Mihara in popular culture== Izu \u014cshima In the realm of fiction, Mount Mihara was the place where the Japanese government imprisoned Godzilla in the movie The Return of Godzilla. Five years later, in the sequel Godzilla vs. Biollante, bombs placed on Mt. Mihara go off and release Godzilla from his fiery tomb. In the novel Ring by Koji Suzuki and its subsequent film adaption, Shizuko Yamamura, the mother of Sadako, predicted that Mount Mihara would someday erupt using her psychic abilities. After a failed psychic demonstration which resulted in Sadako psychically murdering a reporter, Shizuko became depressed and ultimately insane and committed suicide by leaping into the crater of Mount Mihara. Mount Mihara summit ==Suicide== From a vantage point near the top of the cone it was once possible to leap into the crater. As a result, the volcano became a popular venue for suicides. Beginning in the 1920s, several suicides occurred in the volcano every week; more than six hundred people jumped in 1936. Authorities eventually erected a fence around the base of the structure to curb the number of suicides. ==Bibliography== * Night Falls Fast: Understanding Suicide by Kay Redfield Jamison, Vintage Books 2000 ==References== ==External links== * Izu-Oshima - Japan Meteorological Agency * - Japan Meteorological Agency * Izu Oshima - Geological Survey of Japan * Izu-Oshima: Global Volcanism Program - Smithsonian Institution Category:Mountains of Tokyo Category:Stratovolcanoes of Japan Category:Izu-Bonin volcanic arc Category:Active volcanoes Category:Volcanoes of Tokyo Category:Suicide in Japan ",
