    "text": "Munhak Baseball Stadium, home field of the SK Wyverns SK Wyverns () is a South Korean professional baseball team founded in 2000. They are a member of the KBO League. Based in Incheon, they play their home games at Munhak Baseball Stadium. ==History== === 2000: Formation === In the 2000 season, the Ssangbangwool Raiders, a team that had represented the Jeollabuk-do region since 1990, was dissolved because of the bankruptcy of the Ssangbangwool Group, the team's owner. The franchise was subsumed by the KBO, which then awarded a new franchise to the SK conglomerate. The new franchise was named the SK Wyverns. So the Raiders and the Wyverns have no historical links, although the new team consisted mostly of former Raiders players. The Hyundai Unicorns moved out of Incheon to go to Seoul but failed because of the resistance of the Doosan Bears and the LG Twins; the Unicorns then moved to Suwon, with the SK Wyverns filling the void left in Incheon. === 2001\u20132006 === The Wyverns' first Korean Series appearance came in 2003, where, somewhat ironically, they were defeated by the Hyundai Unicorns in seven games. === 2007 === In 2007, SK defeated the Doosan Bears in six games to win the 2007 Korean Series \u2013 the first time the franchise had won the Korean Series \u2013 after finishing the season in first place. They became the first team in Korean Series history to win after losing the first two games. Designated Hitter Kim Jae-hyun was the series MVP. SK went on to compete in the Konami Cup, a short competition between the champions of the Korean Baseball League, the Japanese Baseball League, the Taiwanese Baseball League, and the China All-Stars. On November 8, 2007, SK Wyverns defeated the Chunichi Dragons (6\u20133), giving Chunichi their first-ever loss in Konami Cup history. On November 9, 2007, SK soundly defeated the China All-Stars (13\u20130), causing the game to be called in the seventh inning due to the mercy rule. On November 10, 2007, the Wyverns repeated their performance, defeating the Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions of Taiwan (13\u20131) in 7 innings. The final game, on November 11, 2007, was a rematch of the first game, between the Chunichi Dragons and the SK Wyverns. In an extremely close game, Chunichi won the game, 6\u20135. === 2008 === SK went 83-43-0 in 2008, with a winning percentage of .659, the highest in KBO League history.\"Sung-keun Kim,\" BR Bullpen. Retrieved June 12, 2020. The team went to the Korean Series again, once again facing their main rivals, the Doosan Bears. In a repeat of 2007, SK defeated Doosan to win their second Korean Series championship. Choi Jeong was named the 2008 Korean Series MVP. SK once again went on to compete in the Konami Cup. On November 13, 2008, SK Wyverns defeated the Seibu Lions (4\u20133), marking the second straight year in which the Korean champions handed the Japanese champions a loss in this competition. On November 14, 2008, they once again defeated the Chinese representatives, the Tianjin Lions, in a mercy-rule shortened game. On November 15, 2008, however, they were soundly defeated in a rematch with Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions of Taiwan (10\u20134) and failed to qualify for the championship game for a second straight year. === 2009\u20132012 === In 2009, however, SK were runners-up in the 2009 KBO season and 2009 Korean Series, where they were defeated by the KIA Tigers in seven games. SK rebounded to form in 2010, dominating the regular season and winning the Korean Series in a 4\u20130 sweep against the Samsung Lions. It was SK's fourth straight Korean Series appearance and their third title in four years. The Wyverns also had a 23-game winning streak that ended in April 2010. This is the longest winning streak in Korean Baseball, and the second longest in the world, after the New York Giants. In 2011, manager Kim Sung- keun was ousted mid-season after a long-standing disagreement between him and the SK front office.\"Wyverns abruptly fire manager Kim Sung-keun,\" The Korea Times (Aug. 18, 2011). This led to then-head coach Lee Man-soo taking over the reins \u2013 a move that brought a lot of protests from the SK Wyverns fans, as Kim had led SK to the Korean Series in every year that he had been at the helm. In both 2011 and 2012, SK reached the Korean Series, where they were both times defeated by the Samsung Lions. SK reached the Korean Series every season from 2007 to 2012 (six straight seasons). === 2013\u2013present === In 2018, SK faced the Doosan Bears again in the Korean Series and won another championship. This was their fourth win, and three of four wins against Doosan. == Season-by- season records == {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font- size:90%;\" |- !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Stadium !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Rank !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\" colspan=\"9\"| Regular Season !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Postseason !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Awards |- !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\"|Standings !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\"|Games !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\"|Wins !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\"|Losses !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\"|Draws !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\"|Win% !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\"|BA !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\"|HR !! style=\"background:#E1002A;color:white;\"|ERA |- | 2000 || rowspan=\"2\"|Sungui Baseball Stadium || 8/8 || 4/4 || 133 || 44 || 86 || 3 || .338 || .260 || 105 || 5.99 || || Lee Seung-ho () |- | 2001 || 7/8 || 7/8 || 133 || 60 || 71 || 2 || .458 || .260 || 113 || 4.41 || || |- | 2002 || rowspan=\"18\"|Munhak Baseball Stadium || 6/8 || 6/8 || 133 || 61 || 69 || 3 || .469 || .270 || 158 || 4.47 || || |- | 2003 || 2/8 || 4/8 || 133 || 66 || 64 || 3 || .508 || .272 || 156 || 4.44 || Won Semi-playoff vs. Samsung Lions (2\u20130) Won Playoff vs. KIA Tigers (3\u20130) Lost Korean Series vs. Hyundai Unicorns (3\u20134) || |- | 2004 || 5/8 || 5/8 || 133 || 61 || 64 || 8 || .488 || .272 || 138 || 4.40 || || |- | 2005 || 3/8 || 3/8 || 126 || 70 || 50 || 6 || .583 || .269 || 122 || 3.41 || Lost Semi- playoff vs. Hanwha Eagles (2\u20133) || |- | 2006 || 6/8 || 6/8 || 126 || 60 || 65 || 1 || .480 || .254 || 99 || 3.80 || || |-bgcolor=\"gold\" | 2007 || 1/8 || 1/8 || 126 || 73 || 48 || 5 || .603 || .264 || 112 || 3.24 || Won Korean Series vs. Doosan Bears (4\u20132) || |-bgcolor=\"gold\" | 2008 || 1/8 || 1/8 || 126 || 83 || 43 || 0 || .659 || .282 || 89 || 3.22 || Won Korean Series vs. Doosan Bears (4\u20131) || Kim Kwang-hyun () |- | 2009 || 2/8 || 2/8 || 133 || 80 || 47 || 6 || .602 || .285 || 166 || 3.67 || Won Playoff vs. Doosan Bears (3\u20132) Lost Korean Series vs. KIA Tigers (3\u20132) || |-bgcolor=\"gold\" | 2010 || 1/8 || 1/8 || 133 || 84 || 47 || 2 || .641 || .274 || 120 || 3.71 || Won Korean Series vs. Samsung Lions (4\u20130) || |- | 2011 || 2/8 || 3/8 || 133 || 71 || 59 || 3 || .546 || .263 || 100 || 3.35 || Won Semi-playoff vs. KIA Tigers (3\u20131) Won Playoff vs. Lotte Giants (3\u20132) Lost Korean Series vs. Samsung Lions (1\u20134) || |- | 2012 || 2/8 || 2/8 || 133 || 71 || 59 || 3 || .546 || .258 || 108 || 3.82 || Won Playoff vs. Lotte Giants (3\u20132) Lost Korean Series vs. Samsung Lions (2\u20134) || |- | 2013 || 6/9 || 6/9 || 128 || 62 || 63 || 3 || .496 || .265 || 124 || 4.16 || || |- | 2014 || 5/9 || 5/9 || 128 || 61 || 65 || 2 || .484 || .291 || 115 || 5.51 || || |- | 2015 || 5/10 || 5/10 || 144 || 69 || 73 || 2 || .486 || .272 || 145 || 4.71 || Lost Wild Card vs. Nexen Heroes (0\u20131) || |- | 2016 || 6/10 || 6/10 || 144 || 69 || 75 || 0 || .479 || .291 || 182 || 4.87 || || |- | 2017 || 5/10 || 5/10 || 144 || 75 || 68 || 1 || .524 || .271 || 234 || 5.02 || Lost Wild Card vs. NC Dinos (0\u20131) || |-bgcolor=\"gold\" | 2018 || 1/10 || 2/10 || 144 || 78 || 65 || 1 || .545 || .281 || 233 || 4.67 || Won Playoff vs. Nexen Heroes (3\u20132) Won Korean Series vs. Doosan Bears (4\u20132) || |- | 2019 || 3/10 || 2/10 || 144 || 88 || 55 || 1 || .615 || .262 || 117 || 3.50 || Lost Playoff vs. Kiwoom Heroes (0\u20133) || |- !! colspan=\"4\"| Overall record !!
