    "text": "NuFW is a software package that extends Netfilter, the Linux kernel-internal packet filtering firewall module. NuFW adds authentication to filtering rules. NuFW is also provided as a hardware firewall, in the EdenWall firewalling appliance. NuFW has been restarted by the FFI and renamed into UFWI. == Introduction == NuFW / UFWI is an extension of Netfilter which brings the notion of user to IP filtering. NuFW / UFWI can : * Authenticate any connection that goes through your gateway or only from/to a chosen subset or a specific protocol (iptables is used to select the connections to authenticate). * Perform accounting, routing and Quality of service (QOS) based on users and not simply on IPs. * Filter packets with criteria such as application and OS used by distant users. * Be the key of a secure and simple Single Sign On system. == Principles == NuFW / UFWI refuses the idea of IP == user as an IP address can easily be spoofed. It thus uses its own algorithm to perform authentication. It depends on two subsystems: Nufw which is connected to Netfilter and Nuauth which is connected to clients and Nufw. The algorithm is the following: File:NuFW Algorythm.png # A standard application sends a packet. # The Nufw client sees that a connection is being initiated and sends a user request packet. # The Nufw server queues the packet and sends an auth request packet to the Nuauth server. # The Nuauth server sums the auth request and the user request packet and checks this against an authentication authority. # The Nuauth server sends answer back to the Nufw server # The Nufw server transmits the packet following the answer given to its request. This algorithm realizes an A Posteriori authentication of the connection. As there is no time-based association, this ensures the identity of the user who sent the packet. NuFW is the only real Authentication firewall, as it never associates a user with his machine. == Awards == * 2007 : Lut\u00e8ce d'Or (Paris, France), Best Innovation * 2005 : Les Troph\u00e9es du Libre (Soissons, France), Security ==External links== *UFWI website *NuFW website *Netfilter website *NuApplet - Qt client for NuFW Category:Free system software Category:Free security software Category:Firewall software Category:Linux-only software ",
