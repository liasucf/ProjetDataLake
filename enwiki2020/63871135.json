However the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) revealed a public disclosure on reports about the sample of her test, which says; \u201cAn Adverse Analytical Finding for metenolone and metenolone metabolite -1-methylene-5\u03b1-androstane-3\u03b1-ol-17-one (S1.1 Anabolic agents). As a consequence, the Athlete is provisionally suspended in view of a potential anti-doping rule violation. In any case, where it is determined that the Athlete did not commit an anti-doping rule violation, the relevant decision will also be published. IWF will not make any further comments on the case until it is closed.\u201d == References == Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Nigerian female weightlifters Category:Commonwealth Games silver medallists for Nigeria Category:African Games gold medalists Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in weightlifting Category:Weightlifters at the 2010 Commonwealth Games Category:Nigerian women Category:African Games medalists for Nigeria Category:African Games medalists in weightlifting ",
