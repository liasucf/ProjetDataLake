They made their fortune in real estate through their company Topland Group. ==Early life== Eddie Zakay was born in July 1950 and Sol Zakay was born in June 1952. They were both born in Israel. ==Career== Eddie and Sol Zakay started their property business in Britain during the 1980s property boom. They later expanded into the U.S. and Middle Eastern markets.The Times described the brothers as having made their money principally through sale and leaseback deals with supermarkets, particularly an important deal with Marks & Spencer in 2001.\"Sol Zakay Property entrepreneur\", Catherine Boyle, The Times, 21 July 2008, p. 39. Sol Zakay left Britain to live in Israel. In 2013, he returned to the UK and took over as chairman and CEO of Topland from Eddie, who became deputy chairman. Topland Group is one of the world's largest privately owned property and investment groups. The company owns property in the UK and in 2013 bought 12 out of the 15 hotels (all in the UK) owned by the bankrupt Menzies Hotels for about $135 million. They own a number of other UK hotels, including Bath's Royal Crescent Hotel, the Hilton Brighton Metropole, the Glasgow Hilton and several Thistle Hotels, six in central London and one in Edinburgh. According to The Sunday Times Rich List in 2020 their net worth was estimated at \u00a33.61 billion. The company has since diversified into natural resources and renewable energy. ==Legal dispute== In 2012, The Guardian reported that Topland and Eddie Zakay were being sued by the U.K.'s Ministry of Justice for allegedly having \"conspired with a property agent in 2002 to extract inflated rents from the government on one of its central London buildings which houses the main London divorce courts\" and having engaged in \"deceit, fraud by bribery, dishonest assistance and breach of confidence\" and \"unlawful conspiracy\". The case was first lodged by Labour party minister Jack Straw in May 2010. In 2011, the brothers, via Topland, made a \u00a325,000 donation to the British Conservative Party, who by then were in government with the Liberal Democrats. The case was subsequently \"settled out of court on confidential terms\". ==Philanthropy== In 2010, Topland held a business lunch at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London in conjunction with Jewish Care, at which \u00a3241,000 was raised for the charity's causes.Lord Mandelson helps to raise \u00a3241K for Jewish Care.
