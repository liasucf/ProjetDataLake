    "text": "Norway has issued stamps since 1855, and the first person to appear on a Norwegian stamp was the joint Norwegian-Swedish king Oscar II in 1878. The first non-royal person to appear on a Norwegian stamp was the playwright Henrik Ibsen, to commemorate the centenary of his birth in 1928 followed by the mathematician Niels Henrik Abel later the same year. Queen Maud was the first woman to appear on a Norwegian stamp, in 1939, followed by her daughter- in-law M\u00e4rtha in 1956. The first non-royal woman was author Camilla Collett in 1963. Except for royalty, none has been more frequent on Norwegians stamps than national hero Fridtjof Nansen To the matter of \"who's first\", several non-royal persons appeared on a 1914 stamp commemorating the centenary of the Constitution of Norway, as the stamp depicted the renowned painting of the 1814 assembly. This list does however only include persons depicted as themselves per se, and does not include stamps where persons appear as a representative of their profession, such as post officers, brass band members etc. The list also excludes persons that are represented on paintings. ==A-E== *Niels Henrik Abel, mathematician \u2192 1928, 1983, 2002, 2002 *Roald Amundsen, explorer - 1947, 1961, 1971 *Hjalmar Andersen aka Hjallis, winter athlete - 1990 *Herman Anker, Folk high school pioneer - 1964 *Colin Archer, boat constructor \u2192 1941 *Klas Pontus Arnoldson Nobel laureate - 1968 *Olaus Arvesen, Folk high school pioneer - 1964 *Torgeir Augundsson aka Myllarguten, fiddler - 1985 *Kjell Aukrust, artist/author - 1988 (through his work) *Berit Aunli, winter athlete - 1989 *Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel laureate - 2001 *Fredrik Bajer, Nobel laureate - 1968 *Norma Balean, actress \u2013 2002 *Ivar Ballangrud, winter athlete - 1990 *Arnfinn Bergmann, winter athlete - 1992 *Vilhelm Bjerknes, meteorologist - 1962 *Ole Einar Bj\u00f8rndalen, skil\u00f8per - 2006 *Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson, Nobel author \u2192 1932, 1982, 2003 *Johan Borgen, author - 2002 *Hjalmar Branting, Nobel laureate \u2013 1981 *Trygve Bratteli, prime minister \u2013 2005 *Hallgeir Brenden, winter athlete - 1992 *Ole Jakob Broch, meter convention - 1975 *Waldemar Christofer Br\u00f8gger, geologist - 1974 *Ole Bull, fiddler \u2013 1985 *Aase Bye, actress \u2013 2001 *Lalla Carlsen, actress - 2001 *Johan Castberg, social welfare pioneer - 1993 *Christian IV, Danish-Norwegian king - 1988, 2000 (statue), *Camilla Collett, author - 1963 *Egil Danielsen, athlete - 1961 *Petter Dass, baroque psalmist - 1948, 1997 *Carl Deichman, Oslo library patron \u2013 1985 *Kari Diesen, actress - 2001 *Henry Dunant, Red Cross founder, Nobel laureate \u2013 1961, 2001 *Olav Duun, author - 1976 *Johanne Dybwad, actress - 1967 *Bj\u00f8rn D\u00e6hlie, winter athlete - 1993 *Hans Egede, missionary to Greenland - 1986 *Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner, children's author - 1984 (through his work) *Stein Eriksen, winter athlete \u2013 1992 ==F-J== *Johan Falkberget, author - 1979 *Christian Magnus Falsen, constitution father \u2192 1947 *Kirsten Flagstad, opera diva - 1995 *Svend Foyn, whaler - 1947 *Arne Garborg, author - 1951 (first Noreg stamp) *Einar Gerhardsen, prime minister - 1997 *Henry Gleditsch, actor \u2013 2002 *Victor Goldschmidt, geologist \u2013 1974 *Mikhail Gorbachev, Nobel laureate - 2001 *Edvard Grieg, composer \u2192 1943, 1983, 1993, *Nordahl Grieg, author - 2002 *Johan Gr\u00f8ttumsbr\u00e5ten, winter athlete - 1991 *Cathinka Guldberg, nurse - 1968 *Cato Guldberg, chemist, law of mass action - 1964 *Johan Ernst Gunnerus, bishop, botanist, founder of scientific society - 1970 *Gro Hammerseng, Handball player - 2008 *Gerhard Armauer Hansen, physician, leprosy discoverer - 1973 *Christopher Hansteen, geophysicist - 1984 *Harald, king - 1982, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997, *Odd Hassel, nobel laureate - 2004 *Thorleif Haug, winter athlete - 1990 *Axel Heiberg, founder of forest society - 1948 *Sonja Henie, winter athlete, ice princess, actress - 1990 *Johan Hjort, fisheries researcher - 1969 *Ludvig Holberg, Danish- Norwegian playwright \u2192 1934, 1984, *Haakon IV Haakonson, medieval king - 2004 *Haakon VII, king of Norway \u2192 1907, 1909, 1910, 1937, 1943(1945), 1945, 1946, 1947, 1947, 1947, 1950, 1951, 1955, 1957, 1972, 1982, 1995, 1998, 2003, 2005, 2005, 2007 *Haakon, crown prince - 1997 *Henrik Ibsen, playwright \u2192 1928, 1978 *Lillebil Ibsen, actress, dancer \u2013 2001 *Ingrid Alexandra, princess - 2004, 2005 *Gunnar Isachsen, Arctic explorer - 2006 *Finn Christian Jagge, winter athlete - 1993 *Anne Jahren, winter athlete - 1989 *Bj\u00f8rg Eva Jensen, speed skater - 1989 *Knut Johannesen aka Kupper'n, winter athlete - 1991 *Leif Juster, actor \u2013 2001 ==K-O== *Geir Karlstad, winter athlete - 1993 *Alexander Kielland, author - 1949 *Th.
