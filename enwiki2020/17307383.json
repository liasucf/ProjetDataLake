    "text": "Arran High School is a state-funded secondary school at Lamlash, on the Isle of Arran, Scotland. It is the only secondary school on the island, and is located beside Lamlash Primary School. The school has a roll of around 250 pupils, about 50 teachers, 16 prefects, 2 School Captains and 2 vice captains. At the beginning of 2008, a new school building was opened, replacing an older building which dated from the late 1930s. The current head teacher is Barry Smith. Depute Head Teachers are: Mrs Suzie Dick and Mrs Susan Foster. Principal Teacher of Guidance is Jane Macbeth. ==History== Before the school, pupils from the island would need to travel to and board at a school on the Isle of Bute. The original Arran High School building was completed in 1939 but the building was taken over for use as a hospital in World War II . It only became a school in 1946 and was used as both a primary and secondary school. At this time the school was known as Lamlash Junior Secondary. In 2019 many members of the staff team (e.g teachers of geography, maths, english, computing science, religious and moral education, graphical design, design and manufacture, physics, etc) left which likely lead to many of the recent criticisms about pupils' timetables being supposedly rushed and/or incorrect which, according to some students, led to several students being removed from certain subjects which many had chosen based on their preliminary results. Many parents and pupils are rather unhappy with this and have pointed out that, despite the school supportive and inclusive nature, they are \"kicking out the idiots\".https://ibb.co/87J6Q0Q In addition to this, many pupils were offered business studies but were later told that it would not be available at the school despite previous promises. A promise which was also made and failed on in 2018. Some members of the pupil and parent body argue that the school should be excused as the loss of staff was not their fault and that they are making the best of a bad situation. ==Head Teachers== Mr Petrie - 1947-1972 - Retired Mr D Oakes - 1972-1994 - Retired Mr I Murray - 1994-1998 - Left Miss S Smith - 1998-2003 - Retired Mr D Auld - 2003-2014 - Retired Mr B Smith - 2014\u2013 present ==New school== Former First Minister of Scotland Jack McConnell officially opened the new school building on 9 June 2008, although pupils were being educated in the new building since January 2008. The school has 25 classrooms as well as a workshop, a theatre, a gym hall and dance studio, a fitness suite, a library, three support rooms and a cafeteria. The school also has a nursery for children aged 5 and younger, as well as three college rooms which Argyll College use. Within the school grounds there is a youth centre which was due to be demolished, but was resited to a new location within the school grounds instead. == References == == External links == * Arran High School web site * Arran High School information from North Ayrshire Council * Arran High School's page on Scottish Schools Online Category:Secondary schools in North Ayrshire Category:Isle of Arran Category:Educational institutions established in 1946 Category:1946 establishments in Scotland ",
