    "text": "Moscow Manege The Moscow Manege () is an oblong building along the west side of Manege Square, which was cleared in the 1930s and lies adjacent to Red Square. It is the site of Moscow Design Museum since 2012.The New York Times Style Magazine. Designed by Spanish engineer Agust\u00edn de Betancourt with a roof without internal support for (the building's width), it was erected from 1817 to 1825 by the Russian architect Joseph Bov\u00e9, who clothed it in its Neoclassical exterior, an order of Roman Doric columns enclosing bays of arch- headed windows in a blind arcade, painted white and cream yellow. The roof, with its internal rafters and beams exposed, rests on external columns of the Manege. Night view. The structure was used first as a traditional man\u00e8ge, an indoor riding academy, to house parades of horsemen and a training school for officers. The 180 m long Manege was large enough to hold an entire infantry regiment--over two thousand soldiers-- as well as an invited audience. Since 1831 it has been an exhibition place. In 1867, Hector Berlioz and Nikolai Rubinstein performed at the Manege before a crowd of 12,000. During the Soviet years, the building was used as an art gallery. It was there that Nikita Khrushchev chided avant-garde artists for promoting degenerate art, an episode known as the Manege Affair. On 14 March 2004, the night of a Russian presidential election in which Vladimir Putin was overwhelmingly re-elected for a second four-year term, the building caught fire and burnt down, killing two firefighters. The wooden beams and rafters collapsed, leaving the walls remaining on site. The official investigation concluded that a short circuit caused the fire, though there was media speculation that a fire at such a historic building, only a stone's throw from the Kremlin, on the night of a presidential election, may not have been coincidental. On 18 February 2005 the restored Manege resumed its operation as an exhibition hall by mounting the same exposition that had been scheduled for the day of the fire. == See also == * Saint Petersburg Manege ==References== *Moscow News, \"Third Annual Moscow World Fine Art Fair Opens at Restored Manege\" 6 May 2006 Category:Buildings and structures in Moscow Category:Neoclassical architecture in Russia Category:Equestrian educational establishments Category:Convention centers in Russia Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1825 ",
