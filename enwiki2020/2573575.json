    "text": "Forest City (2001 pop.: 12) is a Canadian rural community in York County, New Brunswick. The community has the unusual distinction of sharing its name with the community of Forest City immediately across the Canada\u2013United States border in the state of Maine. Forest City was once home to 1,000 residents, where its proximity to the waters of East Grand Lake and the softwood forests of the upper St. Croix River watershed provided a lucrative tanning industry that supported an active economy. Remnants of industry can still be found today. The community houses a church, cemetery, and a small water control dam. ==History== ==Notable people== ==See also== *List of communities in New Brunswick ==References== Category:Communities in York County, New Brunswick Category:Divided cities ",
