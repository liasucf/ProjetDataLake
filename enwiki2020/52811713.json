    "text": "Nashua, Acton & Boston Railroad was a railroad between Nashua and Concord with commuter connections to Boston. ==History== The railroad was chartered in 1871 with the primary focus of accessing Boston. It connected to the Framingham and Lowell Railroad in Massachusetts. In the 1900s, the railroad went bankrupt, and, in 1907, the line was incorporated into the Boston and Maine Railroad. By 1925, the line was largely abandoned, except for a remnant in Nashua. There, the rails were used for industrial purposes until 1980. ==Accident== On December 1, 1899, the back half of a train uncoupled between Otterson Street station in Nashua and Sandy pond. After the front of the train made a stop, the back of the train caught up. The brakeman was thrown onto the tracks, and then run over by the flatcar, which had broken loose. ==References== Category:Massachusetts railroads ",
