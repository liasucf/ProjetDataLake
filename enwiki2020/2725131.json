Because this is now a school campus, the highest point is accessible to the public during the week. === History === Many of the original buildings still remain and have been renovated to house career training programs or office space. Ohio Hi- Point became a school district in 1970, when local and state officials created the Ohio Hi-Point Vocational-Technical District, and appointed a nine-member board to govern operations. The school did not open its doors to students, however, until September 1974, after voters approved a levy. New programs were added to the six original offerings, and 700 students enrolled when the school moved into its new main building in 1975. A $1.9 million addition to the main building in early 1995 brought more classroom space and a technology center. Later that same year, the school's name was changed from Ohio Hi-Point Joint Vocational School to Ohio Hi-Point Career Center. For many years the highest point in Ohio served as home to the Bellefontaine Air Force Station. Personnel of the 664th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron manned the site during the 1950s and 60s, during the peak of the Cold War, watching for attacks coming over the pole from Russia. == External links == * Ohio Hi-Point Career Center Category:Educational institutions established in 1974 Category:High schools in Logan County, Ohio Category:Vocational schools in Ohio Category:Public high schools in Ohio Category:1974 establishments in Ohio Category:Bellefontaine, Ohio ",
