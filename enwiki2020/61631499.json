Two tracks are from Ike Turner's instrumental album A Black Man's Soul. The tracks \"Poor Little Fool\" and \"I Better Get Ta Steppin'\" were previous singles included on the 1968 album So Fine. The song \"Poor Little Fool\" by Fontella Bass was originally released as a single in 1964 ob Turner's Sonja label. It was produced by him; he played guitar and Tina Turner recorded background vocals. The first single, \"You Got What You Wanted,\" is credited to Tina Turner with Ike Turner & The Kings of Rhythm.

The second single, \"Make 'Em Wait,\" is by the Ikettes. \"Cussin', Cryin' & Carryin' On\" was released as a single in 1969. \"Poor Little Fool\" was reissued as a B-side single on the Dallas-based Vesuvius Records in 1969, then as an A-side single in 1970. == Critical reception == Record World (August 2, 1969): \"Titled after their recent single click for this label, the dynamite duo are together as ever on this collection of soul tunes the way only these two can do them. Ike contributes material like 'So Blue Over You,' 'I'm Fed Up' and 'Make 'Em Wait,' and it all moves.\" Billboard (August 2, 1969): > Ike & Tina Turner, enjoying competitive sales from the many labels with > rights to their recordings, add some Pompeii product to the sweepstakes and > bid for a solid position on the charts. By far the best of the lot, > Pompeii's contribution features the dynamic singing and instrumental soul > duo in a committed r&b; performance that sparkles with fine production from > Ike Turner. Tina is powerful and persuasive in the title tune, plus \"Poor > Little Fool\" and \"You Got What You Wanted.\" == Reissues == Cussin', Cryin' & Carryin' On was reissued by Bellaphon Records in Germany. Most of the album (excluding tracks by the Ikettes) with additional tracks from So Fine and Ike's instrumental album A Black Man's Soul were reissued on a CD titled Cussin', Cryin' & Carryin' On by Starburst in 1999 and again by Synergie OMP in 2006.
