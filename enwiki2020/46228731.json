The newspaper reappeared under various other names, including the Guyra Guardian from 1959 to 1983, when it was bought by Rural Press Ltd and incorporated into the Tablelands Times. A local community newspaper, called the Guyra Shire Chronicle, followed from 1983 to 1988. After this closed, a series of community meetings were held to determine the future of the newspaper and Geoffrey and Margaret Hovey, who had previously owned The Tenterfield Star were asked to launch a newspaper; they began publishing the Guyra Weekly News in 1989 and it remained in publication until 1992. Publication recommenced under the Guyra Argus masthead in 1993. ==Digitisation== The earlier edition of the Argus has been digitised as part of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program project of the National Library of Australia. ==See also== *List of newspapers in New South Wales ==References== ==External links== *Official website * Category:Newspapers published in New South Wales Category:New England (New South Wales) Category:Publications established in 1902 Category:1902 establishments in Australia Category:Newspapers on Trove ",
