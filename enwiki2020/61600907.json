    "text": "Arthur Moledo do Val (born 21 August 1986 in S\u00e3o Paulo, also known by his pseudonym Mam\u00e3e Falei, is a Brazilian politician, activist member of Free Brazil Movement, YouTuber and entrepreneur. In the 2018 Brazilian general election, he was elected State Deputy of S\u00e3o Paulo as member of Democrats (DEM), being the second most voted with 478,280 votes, after Jana\u00edna Paschoal. Do Val is currently running for mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo in the 2020 election. He is a defender of mostly libertarian ideas and uses his channel on the internet to spread it among his followers, which are more than 2.5 million subscribers on YouTube. ==Biography== The activist says that his question regarding the Brazilian economy and politics began in his younger years, inspiring him to create the channel \"Mam\u00e3efalei\" in June 2015. In the same period, protests were supporting former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva as Chief of Staff of Brazil. Arthur took the opportunity to expose one of the main points of his job in the following year, in 2016, which would include the criticism to the blind political militancy. The video was well-received by the public and had a start point for his career as an activist. The format of his videos which he went to political protests (mainly left-wing ones) and questioned protesters about their defended agenda, in an attempt to expose inconsistencies, brought growth to his channel. It began to be well noticed, associating itself to groups like Free Brazil Movement (MBL) and, along with the movement, received the Boletim da Liberdade Award, of the homonymous newspaper, in 2017; subscribers of the newspaper also voted for the winner's election. Between June and July 2016, Arthur met the MBL coordinators, beginning to produce content and militate as a member. On June 2018, Arthur went to the Chamber of Deputies, talking about fake news and MBL accusations, as well as the request of Supreme Court Justice Luiz Fux for an investigation about fake news. Fux has cited an USP study, citing the MBL as a fake news spreader. Arthur said that such a study didn't exist and asked for Fux's presence, saying that he would be involved with important questions such as the unconditional right given to the public service. Arthur concluded his speech with the following words: On 23 August 2019, Arthur stated he would leave Democrats to run for Mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo in the 2020 election. On 19 November 2019, Arthur was expelled from Democrats. In February 2020, do Val, along with the elite of the Free Brazil Movement, joined the party Patriota (PATRI) and reaffirmed his intentions to run for Mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo. ==Controversies== ===Confrontation with Ciro Gomes=== One June 2018, during the recording of one of his videos in F\u00f3rum da Liberdade, Arthur approached the then pre-candidate for President Ciro Gomes, questioning him about a statement which the politician said he would \"receive Moro's gang with bullets\", a reference to the then-judge S\u00e9rgio Moro. After that, he was hit in the head with a slap from Ciro. Arthur ironized the former Governor asking \"Do you think I'm Patr\u00edcia Pillar so you can hit me?\" Arthur persisted: \"He's weak! Weak! See? Ciro Gomes hit me in the head. Do you think you're in Northeast, Ciro?\" The confrontation generated repercussion. Thais Bilenky, writing for Folha de S. Paulo, considered that, in the act, Ciro touched the activist's neck, alleging that it's not possible to measure the intensity of the supposed slap. Ciro commented the fact to Folha saying \"Do you think if I had hit him, there wouldn't have a mark? As the way I am? I said 'don't be an asshole, man' and left\". Yet, the specialist in micro facial expressions and body language, Vitor Santos, certified by Paul Eckman Group, evaluated the hypothesis of manipulation on the video of the struggle, analysing the footage of the fact and concluding that Arthur was really assaulted. ==Political views== Arthur considers himself as liberal and, for some time, support abortion only in pregnancies when the woman is in risk or is a result of rape, cases in which the current of the Brazilian law allow women to interrupt the pregnancy. But later he assumed he had made a judgement and information mistakes, clarifying in a video and, since then, not returning to the position about the subject. Currently, his points of view had been criticized by the left-wing due to his positioning pro-capitalism. He is also a supporter of privatizations and criticized the racial quotas system, defending social quotas. In 2015, he openly assumed as a supported of the death penalty and the reduction of the age of criminal responsibility with some restrictions. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto\" |+Arthur do Val political views | Disarmament Statute repeal | Privatization | Freedom of the press | Military Strengthment | PEC 13/2012 | Free transportation |- | Nonpartisan School | Tax Reform | Repeal of useless laws | Freedom of religion | Agrarian Reform | Occupation of public and private locations |- | Regulation of outsourcing | Political Reform | Democracy | Military intervention | Racial quotas | State regulation |- | Social quotas | Legalization of marijuana | PEC 241/2016 | CLT and FGTS | Salary increase for parliamentaries | Tributation |} ==See also== * Kim Kataguiri * Fernando Holiday * Free Brazil Movement ==References== Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:People from S\u00e3o Paulo Category:Patriota politicians Category:Democrats (Brazil) politicians Category:Brazilian YouTubers Category:Brazilian activists Category:Brazilian bloggers Category:Members of the Legislative Assembly of S\u00e3o Paulo Category:21st-century politicians Category:Brazilian anti-communists ",
