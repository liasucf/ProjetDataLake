    "text": "The Best of Brandy is the first compilation album by American singer Brandy Norwood. Completing her contract with Atlantic Records after eleven years with the company, it was released in March and April 2005 on most international music markets, marking her final release with the label. The album comprises nearly all of her singles released between the years of 1994 and 2004, compiling her first four studio albums Brandy (1994), Never Say Never (1998), Full Moon (2002) and Afrodisiac (2004), as well as songs she contributed to film soundtracks such as Waiting to Exhale (1995) and Set It Off (1996). While it features no original material, the greatest hits disc contains rare tracks such as a 1995 cover of Michael Jackson's \"Rock with You\", her international single \"Another Day in Paradise\" and the single remix of \"U Don't Know Me (Like U Used To)\". The Best of Brandy was appreciated by contemporary critics who noted the creativity of Norwood's back-catalogue. It debuted at number 27 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, selling about 26,000 units in its opening week, and became a top thirty success in Australia and the United Kingdom. In international territories, the second US single from Afrodisiac, \"Who Is She 2 U\" was released as a single in support of The Best of Brandy. The album was certified silver by the BPI in September 2019, for over 60,000 copies sold. ==Background== On November 1, 2004, four months after the release of her fourth studio album with Atlantic Records, Brandy's publicist Courtney Barnes announced that the singer had requested and was granted an unconditional release from her recording contract with the music label, her record company since 1994, as Norwood was at \"a place where [she wants] some change in her life [and] wanted to move on\" musically. Brandy was subsequently asked to complete her contract with the release of a greatest hits collection, a plan which she considered a true compliment and showcase for her development as a recording artist over ten years. \"I'm really proud of it,\" Brandy said about the compilation album the following year. \"When you get a chance to step back, you notice all these great things you've done and all these great people that you've worked with. The album is a celebration of me being in the industry for so long, and I'm still going.\" In addition, Norwood declared her satisfaction with the conclusion of her Atlantic era: \"I just thought it was a great idea \u2013 to put 18 songs together of the best of everything that I\u2019ve done made me feel really good. And also, it is giving me a reason to move on from everything I've done. I'm excited about putting it out and also putting it behind me.\" ==Reception== ===Critical response=== The Best of Brandy received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Andy Kellman of AllMusic gave the compilation four and a half out of five stars and commented that \"the disc is straightforward and rather thorough in its makeup, compiling almost all of Brandy's charting singles, [and] though the last two albums evidently didn't produce big singles, they're just as strong and fresh as the first two \u2014 so this set, unlike so many other anthologies from her contemporaries, hardly confirms dwindling creativity or popularity.\" Thomas Inskeep from Stylus magazine commended that Norwood \"helped soundtrack highs and lows, especially highs, with your so fresh/so clean stable of killer singles. Now that they\u2019re collected like this, it\u2019s like my own personal time capsule. Here\u2019s to another decade, Brandy. As Aaliyah sang, you\u2019re more than a woman, and the pop/R&B; landscape is richer for your presence in it. Thanks.\" He gave the album an \"A\" rating. In his review for Slant magazine, Sal Cinquemani criticized both Warner Music and Atlantic for \"botching the promotion of her last studio album [Afrodisiac]\" and Norwood's subsequent drop. He was however positive with the album's track lisiting, stating: \"The collection is capped off with non-album tracks like the #2 hit \"Sittin' Up in My Room\" and covers of Michael Jackson's \"Rock with You\" and Phil Collins's \"Another Day in Paradise\", which, though it's not exactly a labor of love for Brandy's longtime label home, makes The Best of a must-have for the hardest-core Moesha fans.\" He rated the compilation three and a half out of five stars. Less enthusiastic, Chris Taylor from MusicOMH felt that album proved that Norwood was \"a fine wine that has never quite fully matured [...]The overall result is a middling collection which ultimately leaves one frequently fast-forwarding, wondering what could have been.\" ===Chart performance=== In the United States, The Best of Brandy debuted at number 27 on the Billboard 200 and number 11 on the Top R&B;/Hip- Hop Albums chart, selling about 26,000 units in its opening week. It remained five weeks within the chart and was left uncertified by the RIAA. Internationally, the compilation album entered the top thirty in Australia and the United Kingdom only, where it reached number 25 and 24 respectively, but enjoyed short runs on the national albums charts. In addition, the album reached number 92 on the European Top 100 Albums chart. ==Track listing== North American edition ==Credits and personnel== *Dallas Austin \u2013 producer *Babyface \u2013 producer *Liz Barrett \u2013 project assistant *Marc Baptiste \u2013 photography *Mike City \u2013 producer *Phil Collins \u2013 composer *Keith Crouch \u2013 producer *Sara Cumings \u2013 art direction, design *LaShawn Daniels \u2013 composer *Ginger Dettman \u2013 project assistant *Malia Doss \u2013 project assistant *Mike Engstrom \u2013 product manager *Roger Erickson \u2013 cover photo, photography *Alan Fletcher \u2013 project assistant *David Foster \u2013 producer *Annaliese Harmon \u2013 project assistant *Dan Hersch \u2013 remastering *Jacqueline Hilliard \u2013 composer *Robin Hurley \u2013 project assistant *Bill Inglot \u2013 remastering *Fred Jerkins III \u2013 producer *Rodney Jerkins \u2013 producer *Kipper Jones \u2013 producer *Quincy Jones \u2013 producer *Johnny de Mairo \u2013 producer *Jonathan Mannion \u2013 photography *Mark McKenna \u2013 project assistant *Sonja Norwood \u2013 management *QDIII \u2013 producer *Ray J \u2013 performer *Guy Roche \u2013 producer *Timbaland \u2013 producer *Becky Wagner \u2013 project assistant *Kanye West \u2013 producer *Corey Williams \u2013 project assistant *Steve Woolard \u2013 project assistant ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !align=\"center\"|Chart (2005) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| European Top 100 Albums (Billboard) | 92 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Japanese Albums (Oricon) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|28 |- |- |- |- |} ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Country !Date |- |United Kingdom |March 28, 2005 |- |Austria |rowspan=\"3\"|April 4, 2005 |- |Germany |- |Switzerland |- |Canada |rowspan=\"2\"|April 5, 2005 |- |United States |- |France |April 12, 2005 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * ForeverBrandy.com \u2014 official site Category:2005 greatest hits albums Category:Albums produced by Dallas Austin Category:Albums produced by Rodney Jerkins Category:Albums produced by David Foster Category:Albums produced by Quincy Jones Category:Albums produced by Guy Roche Category:Brandy Norwood albums Category:Hip hop soul compilation albums Category:Contemporary R&B; compilation albums Category:Pop compilation albums ",
