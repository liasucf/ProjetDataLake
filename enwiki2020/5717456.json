    "text": "Atlantic Rhapsody is a 1989 Faroese documentary film by Katrin Ottarsd\u00f3ttir. The original Faroese title is Atlantic Rhapsody - 52 myndir \u00far T\u00f3rshavn, where the second part means \"52 pictures from T\u00f3rshavn\". The film presents a day in the life of some inhabitants of T\u00f3rshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands. The narrative is structured as a relay race, in which a person, a thing or something out of a scene brings the audience into another scene with new people and events. It is the first ever Faroese feature-length film. ==Synopsis== A trip through 24 hours of the smallest capital in the world, T\u00f3rshavn, the film begins with a father and a daughter who are having breakfast when some fire trucks drive by. A woman and her child are looking at the fire and meet a married couple. The couple say hello to a man who is going out with his boat etc. Out of this emerges a kaleidoscopic story of both daily occurrences and dramatic situations, which in an entertaining and ironic way acts as a commentary on the Faroese, foreigners in the islands, as well as Faroese society in general. ==Production== Atlantic Rhapsody is the first feature film ever to be produced in the Faroes. It is a no-budget film made against all odds for 1.7 million DKR. ==Accolades== In 1989, the film received the prize of the Nordische Filminstitute at the film festival Nordische Filmtage in L\u00fcbeck. ==External links== * Official website * Category:1989 documentary films Category:1989 films Category:Danish films Category:Danish documentary films Category:Faroese-language films Category:Faroese films Category:Films directed by Katrin Ottarsd\u00f3ttir ",
