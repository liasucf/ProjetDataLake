    "text": "North Carolina Highway 99 (NC 99) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of North Carolina in the central Coastal Plain region of the state. ==Route description== ==History== NC 99 was created in the early-1930s, being routed over a previously unnumbered road in Beaufort County. The road ran north from US 264 to a modern-day secondary road (which, at that time, was the first incarnation of NC 97). Around the late-1930s, the highway's current alignment began to take shape. The original NC 99 was reassigned as an extension of NC 32, and NC 99 was given its current assignment as a state highway through Beaufort County, Hyde County, and Washington County. The southern terminus was originally at US 264 in Pantego. In the mid-1980s, NC 99 was extended along US 264 and the former NC 92 to its current southern terminus in Bayview, (at NC 306). By this time, the northernmost few miles of NC 99 had been concurrent with NC 45\\. These two highways divide in Union Grove, and NC 45 continues southward to US 264 in Hyde County. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * North Carolina Bicycle Route 2 - Concurrent with NC 99 from its southern terminus to US 264 in Belhaven ==References== ==External links== * * NCRoads.com: N.C. 99 099 Category:Transportation in Beaufort County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Hyde County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Washington County, North Carolina ",
