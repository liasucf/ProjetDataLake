    "text": "Villa Hidalgo Yalalag (also, Yalalag, Hidalgo Yalag, and Villa Hidalgo Yalalag, and San Juan Yalalag) is a village in Oaxaca, Mexico. It is located near Villa Alta District in the center of the Sierra Norte Region. The town is divided into four neighborhoods (in Spanish called \"barrios\"). These 4 barrios are: San Juan, Santiago, Santa Catalina, and Santa Rosa. ==Culture== On August 30th and July 24th, in honor of San Juan Bautista, the townspeople of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag celebrate their annual festival, with popular dancing, processions, and offerings. ===Traditions=== Traditions include Semana Santa and Todos los Santos. ===Music=== Popular bands in Villa Hidalgo Yalalag are \"Banda Uken ke Uken\" and \"Los Ratones. == Yalaltecos in Los Angeles == Lourdes Guti\u00e9rrez N\u00e1jera uses Zapotecs from Yal\u00e1lag as an example of migrants who originate from Oaxaca, M\u00e9xico and form their own spaces of belonging in the United States, specifically in Los Angeles. The community of Yalaltecos in Los Angeles comes together collectively and participates in festivals, ceremonies, tandas and other small gatherings where they can gossip in Yal\u00e1lag Zapotec, share food, dance, financially and emotionally support one another, and engage in other customs and traditions from the small rural town which is their place of origin. The existence and practice of customs and traditions that were once thought to be exclusive to Yal\u00e1lag, but that have now permeated American society, demonstrates the transnational character of Yalaltecos indigeneity that makes possible the process of Hayandose through the seizure and declaration of these ethnically-marked spaces. Yalaltecos living in Los Angeles have invoked their cultural identity hundreds of miles from home and have used it as a tool to resist the push for assimilation and marginalization within the United States. Therefore, the transmission and continuity of culture across national borders are essential for Yalaltecos to mark their own space and ultimately find themselves in a hostile environment far from their home country. With this new-found sense of belonging, the opportunity for \u201crally[ing] for indigenous rights and the development of hometown communities in Oaxaca, as well as to organize in the United States around immigrant legislation\u201d no longer remains out of reach.Guti\u00e9rrez-N\u00e1jera, Lourdes. \u201cHayandose\u201d, in Beyond el Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America.
