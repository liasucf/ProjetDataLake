A pair of twenty-five minute periods was staged at the All-Star Game, rather than the traditional format of three twenty-minute periods. In the first period, Team Steadman scored the first goal, as Brianna Decker scored against Team Kessel goaltender Brittany Ott. Rookie Alexandra Carpenter was credited with the assist on Decker\u2019s goal, as the score was now tied 3-3. Kessel would score an unassisted goal on Team Steadman goaltender Brianne McLaughlin to reclaim the lead. Before the period would expire, a total of 10 goals were scored, with Team Kessel claiming an 8-7 lead. Goals for Team Kessel were scored by Megan Bozek, Rebecca Russo and Harrison Browne, while Kessel scored another. Madison Packer would score twice for Team Steadman. Other Team Steadman scorers in the first included Emily Pfalzer and Kelly Babstock, the first (and only) Canadian-born player to score a goal in the game. The second period saw Katie Fitzgerald between the pipes for Team Steadman, while Nicole Stock guarded the crease for Team Kessel. Harrison Browne would score another goal, while Hilary Knight also added her name to the scoresheet. Team Steadman\u2019s other scorers in the second period included Haley Skarupa, Carpenter and Steadman. Of note, Steadman would score to tie the game at 10-apiece. An empty net goal by Kessel would win the game for her team, as she recorded the first hat trick in NWHL All-Star Game history. For her efforts, she was recognized as the Game\u2019s Most Valuable Player. ===Skills competition=== *Fastest skater: Rebecca Russo *Hardest shot: Blake Bolden *Shooting accuracy: Kelley Steadman == References == 2017 National Womens Hockey League All-Star Game Category:Tourist attractions in Pittsburgh Category:2017 in ice hockey Category:2017 in sports in Pennsylvania Category:2016\u201317 in American women's ice hockey Category:2016\u201317 NWHL season Category:National Women's Hockey League (2015\u2013) All-Star Games ",
