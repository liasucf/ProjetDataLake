    "text": "Participating states of the Wassenaar Arrangement The Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies is a multilateral export control regime (MECR) with 42 participating states including many former Comecon (Warsaw Pact) countries. The Wassenaar Arrangement was established to contribute to regional and international security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of conventional arms and dual-use goods and technologies, thus preventing destabilizing accumulations. Participating states seek, through their national policies, to ensure that transfers of these items do not contribute to the development or enhancement of military capabilities which undermine these goals, and are not diverted to support such capabilities. It is the successor to the Cold War-era Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), and was established on 12 July 1996, in Wassenaar, the Netherlands, which is near The Hague. The Wassenaar Arrangement is considerably less strict than COCOM, focusing primarily on the transparency of national export control regimes and not granting veto power to individual members over organizational decisions. A Secretariat for administering the agreement is located in Vienna, Austria. Like COCOM, however, it is not a treaty, and therefore is not legally binding. Every six months member countries exchange information on deliveries of conventional arms to non- Wassenaar members that fall under eight broad weapons categories: battle tanks, armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs), large-caliber artillery, military aircraft, military helicopters, warships, missiles or missile systems, and small arms and light weapons. == Control lists == The outline of the arrangement is set out in a document entitled \"Guidelines & Procedures, including the Initial Elements\".Guidelines & Procedures, including the Initial Elements The Wassenaar Arrangement The list of restricted technologies is broken into two parts, the \"List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies\" (also known as the Basic List) and the \"Munitions List\". The Basic List is composed of ten categories based on increasing levels of sophistication: * Category 1 \u2013 Special Materials and Related Equipment * Category 2 \u2013 Materials Processing * Category 3 \u2013 Electronics * Category 4 \u2013 Computers * Category 5 \u2013 Part 1 \u2013 Telecommunications * Category 5 \u2013 Part 2 \u2013 Information Security * Category 6 \u2013 Sensors and Lasers * Category 7 \u2013 Navigation and Avionics * Category 8 \u2013 Marine * Category 9 \u2013 Aerospace and Propulsion Basic List has two nested subsections\u2014Sensitive and Very Sensitive. Items of the Very Sensitive List include materials for stealth technology\u2014i.e., equipment that could be used for submarine detection, advanced radar, and jet engine technologies. The Munitions List has 22 categories, which are not labeled. In order for an item to be placed on the lists, Member States must take into account the following criteria: * Foreign availability outside Participating States * Ability to effectively control the export of the goods * Ability to make a clear and objective specification of the item. * Controlled by another regime, such as the Australia Group, Nuclear Suppliers Group, or Missile Technology Control Regime == Membership == , the 42 participating states are: Participating States The Wassenaar Arrangement * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \u2013 European Union member state. - NATO member. , , , & are not members of the Wassenaar Agreement. & see below. === Admission requirements === Admission requires states to: * Be a producer or exporter of arms or sensitive industrial equipment * Maintain non- proliferation policies and appropriate national policies, including adherence to: ** Non-proliferation policies, such as (where applicable) the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the Australia Group ** Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Biological Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention and, where applicable, START I (including the Lisbon Protocol) * Maintain fully effective export controls The People's Republic of China and Israel are not members. The Arrangement is open on a global and non-discriminatory basis to prospective adherents that comply with the agreed criteria. Admission of new members requires the consensus of all members. India joined as the 42nd participating state on 07 December 2017. \"Wassenaar Arrangement participating states reviewed the progress of a number of current membership applications and agreed at the plenary meeting to admit India which will become the Arrangement's 42nd participating state as soon as the necessary procedural arrangements for joining the WA are completed,\" the grouping said in a statement. India's application was supported by Russia, USA, France and Germany. == 2013 amendments == In December 2013, the list of export restricted technologies was amended to include internet-based surveillance systems. New technologies placed under the export control regime include \"intrusion software\"\u2014software designed to defeat a computer or network's protective measures so as to extract data or information\u2014as well as IP network surveillance systems. The purpose of the amendments was to prevent Western technology companies from selling surveillance technology to governments known to abuse human rights. However, some technology companies have expressed concerns that the scope of the controls may be too broad, limiting security researchers' ability to identify and correct security vulnerabilities. Google and Facebook criticized the agreement for the restrictions it will place on activities like penetration testing, sharing information about threats, and bug bounty programs. They argue that the restrictions will weaken the security of participating nations and do little to curb threats from non-participant nations. ==See also== * Arms Export Control Act * Defense Security Cooperation Agency * Export Control Classification Number * International Traffic in Arms Regulations ==References== ==External links== * Wassenaar Arrangement Category:Arms control treaties Category:Treaties establishing intergovernmental organizations Category:Export and import control Category:Treaties concluded in 1995 Category:Treaties entered into force in 1996 Category:Treaties of Argentina Category:Treaties of Australia Category:Treaties of Belgium Category:Treaties of Canada Category:Treaties of the Czech Republic Category:Treaties of Denmark Category:Treaties of Estonia Category:Treaties of Finland Category:Treaties of Ireland Category:Treaties of Japan Category:Treaties of Latvia Category:Treaties of Lithuania Category:Treaties of Luxembourg Category:Treaties of Malta Category:Treaties of Mexico Category:Treaties of New Zealand Category:Treaties of Norway Category:Treaties of South Korea Category:Treaties of Romania Category:Treaties of Slovakia Category:Treaties of Slovenia Category:Treaties of Sweden Category:Treaties of Turkey Category:Treaties of Ukraine Category:Treaties of the United Kingdom Category:Treaties of the United States Category:Treaties of France Category:Treaties of Germany Category:Treaties of Poland Category:Treaties of Italy Category:Treaties of Russia Category:Treaties of Portugal Category:Treaties of Spain Category:Treaties of the Netherlands Category:Treaties of Hungary Category:Treaties of Bulgaria Category:Treaties of Greece Category:Treaties of Croatia Category:Treaties of South Africa Category:Treaties of Austria Category:Treaties of Switzerland Category:Wassenaar Category:Organisations based in Vienna Category:International organisations based in Austria ",
