That same afternoon, the famous bandit Pancho Lopez steals cattle from the ranch and injures Gil. Gil's uncle Henry is angry that the robbery is ruining them. In the evening, Morgan tells Lucia that he fears that she still loves Gil, but she promises to always stay with him. A month later, when the banker Hardy wanted to take over the ranch, Morgan returned from the city and offered $20,000 for this apparently worthless ranch. Uncle Henry manages to convince the two men that there may be petroleum under his land. It gets even more complicated when Lopez arrives and takes everyone hostage ... except Gil who was in the barn at the time. ==Cast== Sequence from the trailer featuring Wallace Beery Reagan in the trailer Barrymore in the trailer * Wallace Beery as Pancho Lopez * Lionel Barrymore as Uncle Henry Jones * Laraine Day as Lucia Pell * Ronald Reagan as Gil Jones * Henry Travers as Jasper Hardy * Chris-Pin Martin as Pedro * Tom Conway as Morgan Pell * Chill Wills as Red Giddings * Nydia Westman as Angela Hardy * Charles Stevens as Venustiano ==See also== * Lionel Barrymore filmography * List of American films of 1941 * Ronald Reagan films ==References== ==External links== * * * Poster for film at impawards.com Category:1941 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:1941 Western (genre) films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Richard Thorpe Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:Films scored by Franz Waxman ",
