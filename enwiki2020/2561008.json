    "text": "Neklan was the sixth of the seven Bohemian mythical princes between the (also mythical) founder of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty P\u0159emysl the Ploughman and the first historical prince Bo\u0159ivoj. The names of the princes were first recorded in Cosmas chronicle and then transmitted into the most of historical books of the 19th century including Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd's The History of the Czech Nation in Bohemia and Moravia. According to the Chronicle of Dalimil, Neklan had two sons, Hostiv\u00edt and D\u011bpolt. Chronicle of Dalimil One theory about the number of the princes is propped on the frescoes on the walls of the Rotunda in Znojmo, Moravia but Ane\u017eka Merhautov\u00e1 claimed that the frescoes depict all the members of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty including the Moravian junior princes.Barbara Krzemie\u0144ska-Ane\u017eka Merhautov\u00e1-Du\u0161an T\u0159e\u0161t\u00edk: \"Morav\u0161t\u00ed P\u0159emyslovci ve znojemsk\u00e9 rotund\u011b\", Praha 2000. == Origin of the name == Neklan's name is thought to be derived from the Slavonic word \"kl\u00e1t\" meaning to tilt and prefix ne- (non) so it describes him to be a peaceful ruler. Z\u00e1vi\u0161 Kalandra thought the names of the seven princes were cryptical names of ancient Slavonic days of the week - Vojen being the sixth - Friday with just a confusing evidence.Z\u00e1vi\u0161 Kalandra: \"\u010cesk\u00e9 pohanstv\u00ed\", Praha 1947 Another theory says that the names were mistaken from a coherent and partly interrupted old Slavonic text.Vladim\u00edr Karbusick\u00fd: B\u00e1je, m\u00fdty, d\u011bjiny. Nejstar\u0161\u00ed \u010desk\u00e9 pov\u011bsti v kontextu evropsk\u00e9 kultury, p.237, Praha 1995 == Legend in Cosmas Chronicle == Once Vlastislav, the prince of Lu\u010dans (with their centre in \u017datec on the river Oh\u0159e), started war against Neklan and besieged his castle, Lev\u00fd Hradec. Neklan didn't want the war in his country so he wanted to make peace with Vlastislav. However, his guide and second most powerful man in the Bohemian camps, a warrior called Tyr, persuaded him to lend him his armour. So Tyr went to war in place of Neklan, like Patroclus once in place of Achilles. He stroke a fierce battle of Tursko and although he died, Bohemians won and Lu\u010dans were killed to a man (literally, one man escaped the field having followed a witch's instructions). == Seven mythical princes after P\u0159emysl == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color:#ff9966;\"| Mythical Princes of Bohemia |- | Nezamysl |- | Mnata |- | Vojen |- | Vnislav |- | K\u0159esomysl |- | Neklan |- | Hostiv\u00edt |} == Notes == Category:Mythical Bohemian princes Category:P\u0159emyslid dynasty Category:Fictional Czech people ",
