She resigned from Samsung in December 2015 for her political career which began in 2016 when she officially became member of Democratic Party and later nominee for Gwangju constituency at the 2016 general election. After losing her election, Yang continued her commitment to politics. She was one of five elected members of Supreme Council of party for two years before resigning for the president of the NHI in August 2018. After serving as the first woman president of the NHI for a year, she resigned for the upcoming 2020 election. In 2020 general election, Yang defeated six-term parliamentarian Chun Jung-bae becoming the only woman representing a district in Honam region.
