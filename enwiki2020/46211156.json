The protests were a response to the smuggling and parallel trading problem in Hong Kong. ==Overview== Protestors claim that the parallel traders from mainland and Hong Kong have congested Sheung Shui Station, suspected of smuggling, long-term occupation of nearby passages at Sheung Shui while indirectly taking it up as a cause of inflation of certain goods, seriously affecting the neighbourhood nearby.

Parallel traders are mainly active near the MTR East-Rail Stations, especially in Sheung Shui Station. They often line up next to the station and distribute the goods that they have bought. In Hong Kong, there are general agency companies distributing orders to the supermarkets and shops for wholesaling. Any trading activities that has bypassed the distribution from general agency company and sourced their goods by the seller itself either from overseas or mainland in order to escape from taxation would be considered as parallel trading. In explaining the situation in Sheung Shui, shops are selling their goods in bulk to those mainlanders and Hongkongers to carry across the border for the receivers at Shenzhen. Some of them will also sell to the tourists. The products that are being carried across the border will be then parallel trading products while considering the whole activity as a parallel trade. Sometimes, shops in Shatin will even take bulk orders from shops across the broader that may involve illegal smuggling activities. ==Process== 15 September 2012 On 15/9 at 2pm, hundreds of netizens respond to the call on the social network and gathered at the Exit C of Sheung Shui MTR station for the demonstration, screaming the slogan of \"defending the nest\" (\u4fdd\u885b\u5bb6\u5712), in exaggerating seriousness of how the parallel trading industry has affected the life of the resident living in Sheung Shui.
