The museum interprets the story of the Sauk and Meskwaki tribes that lived in the area in a village called the Saukenuk. It was considered one of the largest Native American villages in North America. The collection includes winter and summer houses used by the tribes, and dioramas that depict the lives of the people who lived here from 1750-1830. Artifacts include authentic trade goods, jewelry, and domestic items. ==References== ==External links== * Black Hawk State Historic Site Category:Buildings and structures in Rock Island, Illinois Category:Museums in Rock Island County, Illinois Category:Native American museums in Illinois Category:Tourist attractions in Rock Island, Illinois Category:Culture of the Quad Cities Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in Illinois Category:Museums established in 1939 Category:1939 establishments in Illinois ",
