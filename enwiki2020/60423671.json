    "text": "In algebraic geometry, a normally flat ring along a proper ideal I is a local ring A such that I^n/I^{n+1} is flat over A/I for each integer n \\ge 0. The notion was introduced by Hironaka in his proof of the resolution of singularities as a refinement of equimultiplicity and was later generalized by Alexander Grothendieck and others. == References == *Herrmann, M., S.
