    "text": "|} The Achilles Stakes is a Listed flat horse race in Great Britain open to horses aged three years or older. It is run at Haydock Park over a distance of 5 furlongs (1,006 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in late May or early June. The race was first run in 1995, at Kempton Park (the planned inaugural running in 1994 was abandoned). The race was run at Goodwood in 2005 and 2006 before returning to Kempton Park which was by now an all- weather track. The race was transferred to its current location in 2009. ==Records== Most successful horse (2 wins): * Boogie Street \u2013 2004, 2005 Leading jockey (3 wins): * Richard Hughes \u2013 Boogie Street (2004), Boogie Street (2005), Dazed And Amazed (2007) Leading trainer (4 wins): * Richard Hannon Sr. \u2013 Brave Edge (1996), Boogie Street (2004), Boogie Street (2005), Dazed And Amazed (2007) ==Winners== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! style=\"width:36px\" | Year ! style=\"width:160px\" | Winner ! style=\"width:30px\" | Age ! style=\"width:180px\" | Jockey ! style=\"width:180px\" | Trainer ! style=\"width:60px\" | Time |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |1994Meeting abandoned after two races |- | 1995 | Ya Malak | | Brent Thomson | James Payne | 0:58.87 |- | 1996 | Brave Edge | | Pat Eddery | Richard Hannon Sr. | 0:59.33 |- | 1997 | Almaty | | Frankie Dettori | John Gosden | 0:57.42 |- | 1998 | Midnight Escape | | Seb Sanders | Chris Wall | 0:58.09 |- | 1999 | Proud Native | | Alex Greaves | David Nicholls | 0:58.07 |- | 2000 | Monkston Point | | Richard Quinn | David Arbuthnot | 1:06.38 |- | 2001 | Emerald Peace | 4 | Mark Tebbutt | Michael Jarvis | 0:58.99 |- | 2002 | The Trader | 4 | Jimmy Quinn | Martin Blanshard | 0:57.40 |- | 2003 | Peruvian Chief | 6 | Eddie Ahern | Nick Littmoden | 0:58.30 |- | 2004 | Boogie Street | 3 | Richard Hughes | Richard Hannon Sr. | 0:58.96 |- | 2005 | Boogie Street | 4 | Richard Hughes | Richard Hannon Sr. | 0:58.85 |- | 2006 | The Lord | 6 | John Egan | Bill Turner | 1:00.84 |- | 2007 | Dazed And Amazed | 3 | Richard Hughes | Richard Hannon Sr. | 0:59.85 |- | 2008 | Stoneacre Lad | 5 | George Baker | Peter Grayson | 0:59.96 |- | 2009 | Ialysos | 5 | William Buick | Luca Cumani | 0:59.71 |- | 2010 | High Standing | 5 | Ryan Moore | William Haggas | 1:01.32 |- | 2011 | Noble Storm | 5 | Graham Gibbons | Ed McMahon | 0:59.46 |- | 2012 | Excelette | 3 | Royston Ffrench | Bryan Smart | 1:00.36 |- | 2013 | Medicean Man | 7 | Steve Drowne | Jeremy Gask | 0:58.00 |- | 2014 | Steps | 6 | Kieren Fallon | Roger Varian | 1:00.87 |- | 2015 | Kingsgate Native | 10 | Graham Lee | Robert Cowell | 1:00.35 |- | 2016 | Take Cover | 9 | David Allan | David Griffiths | 0:58.41 |- | 2017 | Final Venture | 5 | Oisin Murphy | Paul Midgley | 1:01.76 |- | 2018 | Muthmir | 8 | Jim Crowley | William Haggas | 0:57.91 |- | 2019 | Made In India | 5 | Tom Eaves | Eric Alston | 1:02.10 |- | 2020 | El Astronaute | 7 | Jason Hart | John Quinn | 0:58.64 |} ==See also== * Horse racing in Great Britain * List of British flat horse races ==References== *Racing Post **, , , , , , , , , **, , , , , , , , , **, , , , , Category:Flat races in Great Britain Category:Haydock Park Racecourse Category:Open sprint category horse races Category:1995 establishments in England Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1995 ",
