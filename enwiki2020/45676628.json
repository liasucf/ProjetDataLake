    "text": "Antoine, 8th Duke of Gramont Antoine-Louis-Marie de Gramont, 8th Duke of Gramont (17 August 1755 \u2013 28 August 1836), was a French military officer, diplomat and parliamentarian.www.burkespeerage.com ==Life and career== He was known by the courtesy title of comte de Louvigny before his marriage, on 16 April 1780, to Agla\u00e9 de Polignac (1768\u20131803), daughter of Yolande de Polastron, Duchess of Polignac. At that point, he was accorded the style of duc de Guiche, since he was the heir presumptive to the Dukedom of Gramont. In 1801, he succeeded a cousin as the 8th Duke of Gramont and the Prince of Bidache. He served as a captain in the Royal Garde du Corps before fleeing to Britain at the outset of the French Revolution. He remained loyal to the House of Bourbon, becoming a military commander under Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul\u00eame. He later served briefly as French ambassador to the Court of St James's under the Bourbon Restoration. == Titles and honours == Saint-Esprit ===Titles and styles=== * 40px Antoine, comte de Louvigny (by courtesy, 1755) * 40px Antoine, duc de Guiche (as heir presumptive, 1780) * 40px Duc de Gramont and Prince de Bidache (1801) * 40px Duke and Peer of France (1814); (1817) === Honours === * 45px Chevalier de Malte (1776) * 45px Chevalier de Saint-Louis (1820) * 45px Chevalier du Saint-Esprit (1820) * 45px Grand Officier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur (1823) ==Popular culture== In Riyoko Ikeda's sh\u014djo manga The Rose of Versailles and its anime adaptation, he is depicted as a much older man at the time of his betrothal to Agla\u00e9 de Polignac, here renamed Charlotte.
