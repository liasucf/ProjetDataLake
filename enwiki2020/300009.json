    "text": "Gananoque ( ) is a town in the Leeds and Grenville area of Ontario, Canada. The town had a population of 5,194 year-round residents in the Canada 2011 Census, as well as summer residents sometimes referred to as \"Islanders\" because of the Thousand Islands in the Saint Lawrence River, Gananoque's most important tourist attraction. The Gananoque River flows through the town and the St. Lawrence River serves as the southern boundary of the town. == Pronunciation == The town's name is an aboriginal name which means \"town on two rivers\". The town's name rhymes with the place name Cataraqui, which appears in the Cataraqui River, the Little Cataraqui Creek, and the Cataraqui Cemetery in nearby Kingston, Ontario. One way to remember its pronunciation is \"The right way, the wrong way, and the Gananoque\". In eastern Ontario speech, the town name is often abbreviated to Gan. == History == surveyor's map of Gananoque from 1787 Colonel Joel Stone, who served with Loyalist militia during the American Revolutionary War, established a settlement on this site in 1789. Land was granted to Col. Stone for use as a mill site. During the War of 1812, American forces raided the government depot in the town to disrupt the flow of British supplies between Kingston and Montreal. The raiders seized the supplies they found and burned the depot. Within a month of the raid, construction of the Gananoque Blockhouse was started, with completion in 1813. It had an octagonal log parapet containing five guns. The blockhouse was abandoned after the War of 1812 and given to a private landowner. == Transportation == Gananoque lies directly on three of Canada's busiest transportation routes: the four-lane Highway 401, the double-track Canadian National Railway main line, and the St. Lawrence Seaway. It is also home to a rich provincial highway heritage, being home to the remaining stretch of Highway 2. It is the western terminus of the Thousand Islands Parkway, and a short drive from the Thousand Islands Bridge, which crosses into the United States as Interstate 81. Via Rail inter-city passenger trains bound for Toronto and Ottawa stop at the unstaffed Gananoque station to the north of downtown. Gananoque is also served by the Gananoque Airport for general aviation. Historically, the Gananoque River's watershed had been an important water transportation corridor, extending north to the Rideau River watershed and playing a key role in the town's early history and economic importance. In 1830, water was diverted near Newboro to the Cataraqui River as part of the Rideau Canal, sending this traffic instead to Kingston. A four-mile short line railroad once linked the main CN Rail tracks to the heart of the village; the Thousand Islands Railway terminated near the town hall. ==Demographics== The Gananoque clock tower Religious denominations: * 52.9% Protestant * 31.9% Catholic * 0.5% other Christian * 0.9% other religion * 13.8% no religion Age structure: * 0\u201314 years: 17.3% * 15\u201364 years: 60.8% * 65 years and over: 21.9% Population trend:Statistics Canada: 1996, 2001, 2006, 2016 census * Population in 2016: 5159 * Population in 2011: 5194 * Population in 2006: 5285 * Population in 2001: 5167 * Population in 1996: 5219 (or 5217 when adjusted for boundary changes) * Population in 1991: 5209 Total private dwellings, excluding seasonal cottages: 2,404 (total: 2,516).
