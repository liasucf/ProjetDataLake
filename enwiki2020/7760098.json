    "text": "Infor is a multi-national enterprise software company, headquartered in New York City, United States. Infor focuses on business applications for organizations delivered via cloud computing as a service. Originally focused on software ranging from financial systems and enterprise resource planning (ERP) to supply chain and customer relationship management, in 2010 Infor began to focus on software for industry niches, as well as user-friendly software design. Infor deploys its cloud applications through Amazon Web Services and various open source software platforms. Infor acquired over forty other software companies since its 2002 founding as Agilysis, for example acquiring GEAC ERP for US$1 billion, Lawson Software for US$2 billion, and GT Nexus for $675 million. Infor had around 58 million cloud users as of July 2016, as well as around 90,000 corporate customers overall. Infor is active in 200 countries and territories with around 17,300 employees. Infor's customers included Bausch & Lomb, Ferrari, Heineken, Wyndham Hotels, Hershey Entertainment and Resorts, Boskalis, EBSCO, Legacy Health, The Madern Group and Best Western International. ==History== ===Founding and early acquisitions (2002\u20132009)=== Infor was founded in June 2002 under the name Agilsys in Malvern, Pennsylvania. With 1,300 customers to start and a focus on enterprise software, the company was constructed through a series of acquisitions led by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners. In December 2002, Agilisys International acquired Brain AG, followed by the acquisition of Future Three the following June. Agilisys moved its headquarters to Alpharetta in the Atlanta metropolitan area, and in February 2004 acquired Infor Business Solutions, a German company headquartered in Friedrichsthal (Saar), Germany. Daly.commerce was acquired by Agilisys in early 2004. In September 2004, Agilisys changed its name to Infor Global Solutions. On October 20, 2004, Infor announced the acquisition of Lilly Software Associates and its VISUAL Enterprise (now referred to as VISUAL ERP) suite of products. In February 2005, Infor acquired MAPICS for around US D$347 million, and subsequently acquired GEAC ERP in 2006 for US$1 billion. After a lawsuit filed in May 2006 attempted to halt SSA Global's merger with Infor unless certain shareholder demands were met, Infor later completed the purchase and integrated the company. Golden Gate\u2019s early push for acquisitions resulted in Infor having 17,500 customers by the summer of 2006. Also that year, Infor began rewriting industry-specific applications into up-to-date .Net and Java-based application providers. In June 2009, Infor acquired SoftBrands (hotel, spa and entertainment business, because in August 14, 2006, The Softbrands Inc. acquired MAI Systems Corporation together with The LodgingTouch Property Management System of his Hotel Information Systems department) for US$80 Million. ===New management and move (2010\u20132013)=== After several acquisitions, in October 2010, Infor\u2019s board of directors hired a new management team composed of four senior executives from Oracle Corporation, all four of whom joined Infor on the same day. Charles Phillips was appointed CEO, Pam Murphy was appointed chief operating officer (COO), and Duncan Angove and Stephan Scholl became co-presidents. Phillips established a new strategic direction as CEO. In order to gain market share on Oracle and SAP, Infor also focused on providing applications with user-friendly interfaces, while continuing to rewrite applications into new code. The company acquired ERP rival Lawson Software for US$2 billion in 2011. Infor launched its Infor10 line of products in September 2011. Within the products were the ION middleware suite and a new user interface. In the summer of 2012, Infor relocated its headquarters from Alpharetta, Georgia to New York City, citing the availability of engineers and designers in \u201cSilicon Alley,\u201d investment in the technology educational sector by a consortium of universities, and the proximity to customers. With several hundred employees remaining in Georgia, Infor\u2019s new \"loft-style\" offices at 641 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan were designed with the intent of promoting \"collaboration and transparency.\" Infor acquired Groupe Laurier CIM in August 2012. On December 4, 2012, Infor announced it had acquired Orbis Global, which used a software as a service model for its marketing resource management software. Infor integrated Orbis Global's technology into its own customer experience product suite. ===\"Micro-vertical\" focus and pivot to cloud (2013\u20132014)=== After the 2010 management changes, Infor began specializing in \"micro-verticals,\" purpose building its software to meet the needs of customers in niche industries. Arguing that similar businesses have similar software needs, CEO Phillips explained in January 2012 that the food and beverage industry, for example, is made up of smaller \"micro-verticals\" such as bakers, butchers, and breweries, each of which have unique needs. In contrast to many of its competitors, Infor designs software with the intent that companies can use the programs immediately, without consultation or customization. As of 2013, Infor continued to rework industry-specific applications from older software languages into more widely used .Net and Java programming languages. On April 2, 2013, Infor announced the acquisition of CERTPOINT Systems, a software as a service learning technologies company. On May 16, 2013, Infor acquired TDCI, Inc., and by late 2013, Infor had launched 300 new products and hired 1,500 new engineers since 2010. Among other companies, Infor acquired PeopleAnswers in January 2014. Advancements in cloud computing enabled Infor to integrate applications into suites for specific industries and sell them as a service. Infor debuted its Infor CloudSuite product, which is delivered exclusively through Amazon Web Services (AWS), in 2014. CloudSuite is designed to integrate software solutions intended for \"micro-vertical\" industries. Infor also formed partnerships with Red Hat and EnterpriseDB to offer an open-source PostgreSQL stack that year, and Infor's net income in 2014 equaled US$121.7 million. ===GT Nexus acquisition (2015\u20132016)=== {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:2em; margin-right:0; font-size:85%; background:offwhite; color:black; width:30em; max-width:40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\" |style=\"text-align: left;\"|\"Infor is the amalgamation of more than 40 software acquisitions brought together by private equity backers Golden Gate Capital and Summit Partners. Beginning in 2002, Golden Gate began assembling the company to provide the kind of nuts-and-bolts enterprise software that has proved one of the hottest sectors in tech. Under [CEO] Phillips, the company has surged. It now sells its wares to more than 70,000 corporations, including clients Bausch & Lomb, Ferrari, and Heineken.\" |- |style=\"text-align: left;\"|\u2014 Fortune on August 15, 2015\" |} The company saw around a 300 percent increase in service bookings in 2015, with revenue up that year up around 60 percent. By July 2015, Infor had around 45 million users signed up to use its cloud computing software. On August 11, 2015, Infor announced its upcoming acquisition of GT Nexus for $675 million. At the time, GT Nexus was the world's largest cloud-based global commerce platform, with $100 billion of trade in direct goods conducted each year though its network. Explained Bloomberg, the acquired technology allows Infor customers to \"leave elaborate business-management systems that run at headquarters untouched while supplying those clients\u2019 plants with programs specialized by industry and delivered via cloud computing.\" Infor acquired Predictix in July 2016, at which point Infor related that it had \"more than 58 million users\" in the \"Infor cloud.\" ===Investment by Koch Industries (2017)=== In February 2017, Koch Equity Development LLC invested $2.68 billion in Infor, for a 66.67% equity ownership stake in the company. Infor is valued at $10 billion, and has $6 billion of debt, most of which is publicly-traded. ===Purchase by Koch Industries (2020)=== In February 2020, Koch Equity Development LLC purchased full equity in Infor, buying out Golden Gate Capital's remaining equity. Infor is valued at $11 billion. ==Software== Since CEO Charles Phillips joined Infor in 2010, the company has focused on creating applications that result in a positive user experience, among other factors such as efficiency. Infor deploys its applications primarily on the Amazon Web Services cloud and open source platforms. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |+ Primary software lines developed by Infor !
