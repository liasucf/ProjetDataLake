It participates in the Donald Gray Memorial Cup and their home stadium is QUEENSPARK / SURREY PARK 4 / SURREY PARK. == History == Queens Park Association Football Club was formed in 1957 by Alexander Stojkovich and in 1958 the team made its debut in the local Invercargill Second Grade competition. In 1960 the senior team was promoted to the premier Southland competition, the Donald Gray Memorial Cup. When the Southern League was formed in 1968 Queens Park entered the First Division, finishing 9th. However at the end of the 1969 season they were relegated to the Southern League Second Division. 1972 saw Queens Park win the Southern League Division Two South & the Promotion/Relegation play-off to rejoin the Southern League Division One. The club played in this league until 1975, when some poor results saw them relegated to Southern League Division Two South. In 1977 they again won Division Two South, but failed to gain promotion this time around. For the 1980 season the Southern League was consolidated into a Northern & Southern Zone, with Queens Park joining the Southern Zone. The club continued to play in this league until it was again restructured in 1986. In 1987 they played in the reformed Southern League Division Two South, before withdrawing in 1988 to supply players to the Southland United amalgamation. After Southland United was disbanded at the end of 1991, Queens Park was left without representation at an inter-provincial level until 1996 when the club re-entered the Southern League. Events that transpired that season, chiefly the revival of Southland United, poor results (particularly towards the end of the season), and financial constraints; resulted in Queens Park withdrawing for 1997 to once again to support Southland United. As of 2020 they are one of the biggest senior football clubs I southland. With team in Donald Gray, Division 1, Division 2 and women's Kolk Cup. Donald Gray (prem), Division 1 (Development), Division 1 (Columbian Refugee), Division 2 (Development), Division 2 (masters) are the men's teams.
