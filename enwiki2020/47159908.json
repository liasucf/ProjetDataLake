When completed, it will be the first monorail line in the Philippines and the second rapid transit line serving the province of Rizal after the extension of LRT Line 2 to Antipolo. The proposal, consists of eleven stations, will have a right-of-way alignment along N. Domingo, Ortigas Avenue and Taytay Diversion Road, linking suburban Taytay, Rizal to the Ortigas Center business district in eastern Metro Manila. The project costed an estimated \u20b159.3 billion or US$1.1 billion. It was approved by the Investment Coordination Committee (ICC) of the National Economic and Development Authority last June 2015 as a public\u2013private partnership project. The initial project was not pushed through until it was approved for a second time on December 20, 2019. When completed, it is expected to significantly reduce the volume of vehicular traffic along Ortigas Avenue and improve connectivity in the eastern parts of the metropolis, including the nearby municipalities in southwestern Rizal. According to the Department of Finance, the Philippine government is looking to fund the construction through the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the Asian Development Bank. == History == === Construction === The line is set for construction this 2021 with assistance from the Asian Development Bank and targeted to be operational by 2025. ==Route== It will start from N. Domingo, one block away from Gilmore station of Line 2 at Quezon City in the west, to SM City Taytay in Dolores, Taytay in the east, passing through the cities of Mandaluyong and Pasig and the municipality of Cainta. An empty lot beside the Taytay Municipal Hall and Manila Club East Resort had been reserved for the depot. ===Proposed stations=== The first proposal in 2015 involves the construction of 13 elevated stations along Taytay Diversion Road, Ortigas Avenue, ADB Avenue, Shaw Boulevard, P. Sanchez Street, and V. Mapa Street (listed from east to west): {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! width=\"150px\" | Name ! width=\"125px\" | Structure Type ! width=\"175px\" | Transfers ! width=\"125px\" | Location |- | | Elevated | rowspan=\"7\" | rowspan=\"2\"|Taytay, Rizal |- | | Elevated |- | | Elevated | Cainta, Rizal |- | | Elevated | rowspan=2| Pasig |- | | Elevated |- | | Elevated | rowspan=2| Mandaluyong/Pasig |- | | Elevated |- | | Elevated | MRT Line 3 via Ortigas | rowspan=4| Mandaluyong |- | | Elevated | rowspan=\"4\" |- | | Elevated |- | | Depressed |- | | Depressed | rowspan=2| Manila |- | | Depressed | LRT Line 2 via V.

Its proposed alignment is along Ortigas Avenue with an option to extend the line to as far east as the Rizal municipality of Angono on the Manila East Road, and west to either of the following terminals: * Option 1: interchange with Santa Mesa station (PNR Metro South Commuter Line) via ADB Avenue, Sheridan Street, Pioneer Street, Boni Avenue, Aglipay Street and Lubiran Street. * Option 2: interchange with V. Mapa station (LRT Line 2) via ADB Avenue, Shaw Boulevard, P. Sanchez Street and V. Mapa Street. * Option 3: interchange with Gilmore station (LRT Line 2) via a straight path following Ortigas Avenue and Gilmore Avenue in San Juan and its western extension Granada Street in Quezon City. Option 2 was the chosen alignment of the study owing to its capability to serve the most demand that can alleviate traffic the most on the Taytay- Cainta-Pasig-Mandaluyong-Manila corridor. Construction was not pushed through despite receiving approval by President Benigno Aquino III last September 2015. ==References== Line 4 Line 4 Category:Transportation in Rizal Category:Proposed public transportation in the Philippines ",
