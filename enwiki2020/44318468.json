    "text": "Bravida Arena is an association football stadium in Gothenburg, Sweden. The project was initiated by Allsvenskan side BK H\u00e4cken and Gothenburg Municipality to build a new 6,000 to 7,000 capacity stadium in the Hisingen area of Gothenburg, Sweden. ==History== A new stadium in the Hisingen area had been discussed for years time prior to the announcement that BK H\u00e4cken and Gothenburg Municipality had agreed. One of the reasons for building a new stadium is the new stadium criteria by the Swedish Football Association which went into effect in 2014. The new stadium is being built on the same site as H\u00e4cken's previous stadium Rambergsvallen which it replaced. BK H\u00e4cken held the naming rights for the stadium and announced that they would most likely sell them to an external sponsor. On 21 January 2015 it was announced that the name of the stadium would be Bravida Arena. ==References== == External links == * Official project website Category:Football venues in Gothenburg Category:BK H\u00e4cken ",
