    "text": "The Faculty of Business and Economics at Monash University, Melbourne is the largest university faculty in Australia. It is home to over 16,000 students and staff.About Business and Economics In teaching, it offers undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate degrees. The Faculty's teaching and research are spread across most of Monash University's campuses, including Clayton, Caulfield, Malaysia, Gippsland, Peninsula, Berwick, South Africa and Prato. The Interim Dean of the Faculty is Professor Rob Brooks. ==History== The current Faculty structure is the result of the amalgamation of the Monash University Faculty of Economics and Politics, based at the University's Clayton Campus, and the David Syme School of Business, based at what is now the University's Caulfield Campus. Traditionally, the Clayton Campus was strong in economic research, but underperformed in industry training. Conversely, the David Syme School was one of Australia's leading business schools in professional training, but lacked a strong research base. The early 1990s merger, though opposed by some at the time, was seen as a way to bring together these parallel areas of expertise. ==MBA program== Monash is one of only three MBA programs in Australia to have accreditation by the London-based Association of MBAs (AMBA).Monash MBA ==Alumni== Alumni of the Faculty include: *Richard Alston, Former Australian Senator and Minister, current Australian High Commissioner in London *Mark Birrell - Company director, former Minister for Industry, Science and Technology *Julian Burnside QC - High profile barrister, human rights advocate, author *Alastair Clarkson - Former AFL footballer, current coach of the Hawthorn Football Club *Simon Crean MP - Australian Minister for Trade, former Leader of the Opposition and Minister for Employment, Education and Training *Josh Frydenberg MP - Prominent Investment Banker and current federal Member for Kooyong. *Alan Griffiths, former Australian Minister for Industry and Resources *Margaret Jackson AC - Company Director, first female Chairman of Qantas *John Langmore - Politician and author *Ian Little (1956-2006) - Secretary of the Department of Treasury and Finance, 1998-2006 *Michael Luscombe - former CEO, Woolworths *Ian Macfarlane AC - Economist, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, 1996-2006 *Peter Marriott - Chief Financial Officer, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) *Julian McGauran - Australian Senator *Andrew Mohl - Managing Director and CEO, AMP *Stuart Morris, Justice of the Supreme Court of Victoria, President of VCAT *Trevor O'Hoy - President and CEO, Foster's Group *Martin Pakula - Current Victorian Minister for Industry, Trade and Industrial Relations *Pasuk Phongpaichit - Economist, author, anti-corruption campaigner *Peter Reith - Executive Director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, former Defence Minister *Gary P.
