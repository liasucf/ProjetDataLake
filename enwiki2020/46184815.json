In terms of Hindu philosophy, the living entity or Jiva is \u0101\u015braya, and Brahman or the Supreme Being, the Godhead, is vi\u015baya, the supreme objective, the goal of life Bhagavata Purana (VII.x.6). But, this word - \u0101\u015braya conveying the primary meaning \u2013 'refuge', immediately relates with the deity which is worshipped rather than with the abstract Brahman, the substratum of all that exists. ==Hindu view-point== Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, which promotes qualified-monism, holds the belief that Jiva is anu or monadic in substance. Jiva though infinitesimal, is the individual atman harboured by a body, which atman the Mundaka Upanishad tells us, to be known by the mind is capable of becoming infinite through its attributive knowledge. Jiva is kart\u0101 and bhokt\u0101, both; it is the \u0101\u015braya for j\u00f1\u0101na, the substrate for krti or prayatna (effort) caused by the desire to act. Therefore, Jiva is the \u0101\u015braya for the states of experience that invariably involve changes in mental disposition without affecting the Jiva. Shankara does not consider avidy\u0101 (ignorance) as something positively existent, he does not speak about its vik\u015bepa-\u015bakti (power of dispersion) or avarna-sakti (power of concealment); he does not raise avidy\u0101 to an eternal metaphysical entity. Shankara also does not subscribe to the view that the individual soul is the bearer of avidy\u0101 (\u0101\u015braya) or to the contention that the Paramatman is the \u0101\u015braya of avidy\u0101 as is held by Mandana and V\u0101caspati. He reiterates that for an awakened person there is no avidy\u0101 to delude and cause pain or pleasure. In the context of the origin of the world (the original state is called avyakta) he terms Parameswara-Brahman as the \u0101\u015braya of n\u0101mar\u016bpe (the physical presence which name manifests) and that Brahman is the \u0101spada (locus) of the cosmic vyavah\u0101ra imagined by avidya. Knowledge implies the subject which knows and the object that is known. Suppression (avarna) precedes substitution (viksepa); avidy\u0101 makes one misapprehend and therefore it is described as positive (bh\u0101va-r\u016bpa), and does not contradict vidy\u0101 (knowledge). With regard to the transmigrating souls, Shankara does speak about the bh\u016bta- \u0101\u015braya or elementary substratum or material substratum of the soul, the subtle body, and about the karma- \u0101\u015braya or moral substratum connected with v\u0101san\u0101s (impressions), karma (works ordained or forbidden) and p\u016brvapraj\u00f1\u0101 (previous experience) but he does not accept the existence of subtle persisting elements of works or preparatory elements of fruits called apurva because of their non-spiritual nature. According to the Bhagavata Purana (one of the 18 Mahapuranas or 18 Major Puranas) the personal aspect of God is the \u0100\u015braya of the \u0101tm\u0101. ==Jaina viewpoint== Condition of existence (gati), according to Jain philosophy, is the state of a soul shaped by gati- nama-karma (body-condition-making) or is the cause of the soul passing through any one of the four conditions of existence \u2013 hellish, sub-human, human and celestial. They subscribe to the view that in a thing which is permanent the existence of s\u0101m\u0101naya and samav\u0101ya is complete, that means that common properties cannot exist without individuals possessing them; the individuals are the \u0101\u015braya; s\u0101m\u0101naya and samav\u0101ya is complete in one substance will not exist without \u0101\u015braya (substratum). ==Buddhist view-point== Vasubandhu explains that the \u0101\u015braya (foundation or support) of the fundamental change that indicates \u0101tmabh\u0101va (psychophysical continuum) is the non-conceptual wisdom free from the duality of the apprehender and the apprehended; \u0101\u015braya refers to obscured tathagatagarbha (the fourth vajra-point) and its change (tatapar\u0101vrtti) which is enlightenment (the fifth vajra-point). It is possible to replace one \u0101\u015braya with another by freeing the ayatanas (internal and external sense- bases) from physical and mental impregnations of negative tendencies which bring about craving, suffering etc., by cultivating calm abiding and superior insight, which process activates theayatanas associated with awareness (vidy\u0101) that purify all impregnations of negative tendencies and involve raising oneself to \u015buddh\u0101\u015brayabh\u016bmi, the level of pure superior intention, never to return to the lower realms or suffer rebirth. Tathat\u0101 is the basis of transcendental wisdom, and Bh\u016btatathat\u0101 is the genuine 'Suchness', the essential nature of phenomenal existence, the self-identical universality, the grounding (\u0101\u015braya) truth of finite particularity. The Buddhists believe that the skandhas, the ayatanas and the dh\u0101tus are the dharmas that constitute the phenomenal world and are the forms (and the conditioning factors) in which consciousness appears to itself. Bh\u016btatathat\u0101 is the \u0101\u015braya i.e. the basis which is to be transformed (\u0101\u015braya-paravritti), and also the \u0101\u015braya which is the result of the transformation. Therefore, it is the \u0101\u015braya of delusion and awakening. The Mah\u0101y\u0101na-samparigraha\u015b\u0101shtra tells us that the mind of Reality is ever obstructed by \u0101ve\u1e47k\u012b avidy\u0101 which is manas, the seventh consciousness and the \u0101\u015braya of mano-vij\u00f1\u0101na and the five sensorial consciousnesses evolved from self-patterning of the Absolute; the attachment of manas to \u0101tmagr\u0101ha (egohood) and dharmagr\u0101ha (thinghood) makes the perception of the multiplicity of forms possible. The Mah\u0101y\u0101na- abhidharmasutra tells us that the beginningless dh\u0101tu (locus) is the equal support (\u0101\u015braya) of all phenomena (dharma) and rests in the body as seeds. According to the Yogacaras, \u0101tmabh\u0101va and \u0101\u015braya basically mean \u2013 \"body\", and who also tell us that \u0101\u015braya-paravritti can be of the mind or path or errant tendencies. ==Hindu astrology== \u0100\u015barya yoga, a special kind of planetary placement with most planets resting in moveable or fixed or common signs (r\u0101sis), is one of the thirty-two varieties of Nabhasa yogas in which regard Varahamihira tells us \u2013 : \u0905\u0928\u0941\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0941\u092d\u094d-\u0906\u0936\u094d\u0930\u092f\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u0935\u093f\u092b\u0932\u093e \u092d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0948\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u092e\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093e\u0903 | : \u092e\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e \u092f\u0947\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u092b\u0932\u0902 \u0926\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0930\u092e\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0903 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u092b\u0932\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u093e\u0903 || : \" The \u0100\u015barya yogas become ineffective, when they look like other yogas, and those other yogas become operative and bear results.
