British Bechuanaland was a short-lived Crown colony of the United Kingdom that existed in southern Africa from its formation on 1 Sep 1885 until its annexation to the neighbouring Cape Colony on 16 Nov 1895. British Bechuanaland had an area of and a population of 84,210. Today the region forms part of South Africa. ==History== Bechuanaland meant \"the country of the Tswana\", and for administrative purposes was divided into two political entities. The northern part was administered as the Bechuanaland Protectorate and southern part, south of the Molopo River, was administered as the Crown colony of British Bechuanaland. In 1882 the Tswana country suffered two secessions by the Boer states of Stellaland and Goshen. For many months, starting in 1883, pressure was placed on the British Government to take action in Bechuanaland because of unrest in the area. On 29 October 1884, the British Government appointed Sir Charles Warren as Special Commissioner of Bechuanaland. On 13 November 1884 Parliament voted a sum of \u00a3675,000 (this is equivalent to over \u00a332 million today) for military operations in Bechuanaland. Sir Charles Warren was authorised to recruit an irregular force of 1,500 in South Africa in addition to the regular troops that would be provided. A force of 4,000 troops, under Sir Charles Warren, set off to recapture Stellaland and Goshen. On 7 February 1885 the force reached Vryburg, the principal town in Stellaland, then continued to the hamlet of Rooigrond, the administrative centre of Goshen. Just north of Rooigrond the town of Mafeking was laid out as an administrative centre. By 8 April 1885, Sir Charles Warren sent a dispatch to notify the British Government that he had occupied Bechuanaland and had entirely restored order. The two Boer republics had collapsed without any bloodshed. On 30 September 1885 Stellaland, Goshen and other territories to the south of the Molopo and Nossob rivers (excluding Griqualand West) were constituted as the Crown Colony of British Bechuanaland. In 1891 the South African Customs Union was extended to British Bechuanaland, and in 1895 the colony was annexed to the Cape Colony and now forms part of South Africa, the area around Mafikeng. ==See also== *History of South Africa *Bechuanaland Protectorate, the northern part of Bechuanaland that now forms the Republic of Botswana. *Postage stamps and postal history of British Bechuanaland ==References== Category:History of South Africa Category:Former countries in Africa Category:States and territories established in 1885 Category:Former colonies in Africa Category:Cape Colony Category:1885 establishments in the British Empire Category:1895 disestablishments in the British Empire ",
