He signed for Manchester United as a schoolboy in 1989, and, after leaving school, signed a trainee contract on 13 July 1992. He played in the youth side that were FA Youth Cup runners-up in 1993. He promptly signed professional forms with the club, but never played a first-team game and was transferred to Nottingham Forest in a \u00a375,000 deal at the start of the 1995\u201396 season. Irving's solitary first-team appearance was as a substitute at home to his former club on 29 November 1995 \u2013 a Premier League fixture at the City Ground which ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Irving left Forest in the summer of 1997 and signed for Macclesfield Town, who had just won promotion to the Football League as Conference champions. He played nine games in the Division Three 1997\u201398 campaign which saw Macclesfield secure a second successive promotion, but he left soon afterwards and never played professional football again.
