He trained as a machine fitter, and joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1931. After the Nazi Party came to power in 1933, Budeus was active in the underground communist resistance. In 1936, he set up an illegal resistance cell at the Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken factory where he worked, organizing more than 50 workers. From the late 1930s, Budeus worked closely with the resistance group led by Robert Uhrig, distributing pamphlets, making contacts with other resistance fighters and collecting information on arms production and the political mood of the German population. On 4 February 1942, Budeus was arrested by the Gestapo. He was detained for more than two years in Sachsenhausen concentration camp and Brandenburg Prison before being sentenced to death by the People's Court on 7 June 1944. He was executed by guillotine on 21 August 1944 in Brandenburg-G\u00f6rden Prison. A street in the Friedrichsfelde locality of Berlin was named Walter-Budeus-Stra\u00dfe from 14 January 1976 until 1981. ==References== Category:1902 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Politicians from Brandenburg Category:Communist Party of Germany politicians Category:Communists in the German Resistance Category:Executed communists in the German Resistance Category:People condemned by Nazi courts Category:People executed by guillotine by Nazi Germany Category:People from Brandenburg executed by Nazi Germany Category:Sachsenhausen concentration camp prisoners ",
