    "text": "Cervantes is a highly fictionalized 1967 film Franco-Spanish-Italian international co-production biography of the early life of Miguel de Cervantes (1547\u20131616). Based on the 1937 novel A Man Called Cervantes by Bruno Frank, it was the first screen biography of the author. Directed by Vincent Sherman, and filmed in color, it stars Horst Buchholz as Cervantes; Gina Lollobrigida as a prostitute with whom he becomes involved; Jos\u00e9 Ferrer as Hassan Bey, the Turk who held Cervantes in captivity; Louis Jourdan as Cardinal Giulio Acquaviva; and Fernando Rey as King Philip II. Italian actor Tiziano Cortini who usually used the name \"Lewis Jordan\"\" appeared under his own name to avoid confusion with Louis Jourdan. Enrique Alarc\u00f3n did the production design. ==Cast== *Horst Buchholz as Miguel de Cervantes *Gina Lollobrigida as Giulia *Jos\u00e9 Ferrer as Hassan Bey *Louis Jourdan as Cardinal Acquaviva *Francisco Rabal as Rodrigo Cervantes *Antonio Casas as Favio *Soledad Miranda as Nessa *\u00c1ngel del Pozo as Don Juan de Austria *Ricardo Palacios as Sancho *Maurice de Canonge * Tiziano Cortini *Jos\u00e9 Nieto as Minister of Philip II of Spain * Andr\u00e9s Mejuto as Cervantes' Father ==Production== Filming began in 1966, and the movie was released in several countries between 1967 and 1969. ==Reception== Released in the U.S. as a B-movie, and retitled Young Rebel, the film went unnoticed at the box office and did not do well critically. ==External links== * Category:1967 films Category:1960s adventure films Category:1960s historical films Category:1960s biographical films Category:Spanish adventure films Category:Spanish biographical films Category:French adventure films Category:French biographical films Category:Italian adventure films Category:Italian biographical films Category:Spanish films Category:French films Category:Italian films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Vincent Sherman Category:Films set in the 16th century Category:Films set in Spain Category:Films set in the Mediterranean Sea Category:Biographical films about writers Category:Cultural depictions of Miguel de Cervantes Category:Films shot in Almer\u00eda Category:English-language French films ",
