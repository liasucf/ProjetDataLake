    "text": "Mark Christian Thompson is Professor of English at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. His research and teaching concentrate on the philosophy of race in German and African American thought and culture. ==Career== At Johns Hopkins University, Thompson teaches both undergraduates and graduate students in courses including \"The Philosophy of African American Literature; African American Literary Theory and Criticism\"; \"Modernism and Sacrifice; The Body, Space, and Modernity in Nineteenth-Century Fiction\"; \"African American Literature: The Beginnings to 1914\"; \"Slave Narratives and Neo-Slave Narratives\"; \"The Gothic Novel\"; \"The Bible as Literature\"; and \"Introduction to Literary Study\". Thompson is the author of three books, Anti-Music: Jazz and Racial Blackness in German Thought between the Wars (SUNY Press, 2018), Kafka\u2019s Blues: Figurations of Racial Blackness in the Construction of an Aesthetic (Northwestern University Press, 2016), and Black Fascisms: African American Literature and Culture Between the Wars (University of Virginia Press, 2007). In Kafka's Blues, Thompson argues that many of Kafka\u2019s major works engage in a \"coherent, sustained meditation on racial blackness\", while in Black Fascisms: African American Literature and Culture Between the Wars, he addresses the fact that many African American intellectuals in the 1930s sympathized with fascism.. In Anti-Music, by examining writings by Hermann Hesse, Bertolt Brecht, T.W. Adorno, and Klaus Mann, as well as archival photographs and images, Thompson brings together debates in German, African American, and jazz studies, and charts a new path for addressing antiblack racism in cultural criticism and theory.. == References == Category:Living people Category:Johns Hopkins University faculty ",
