Khampieng\u2019s mother, Princess Vanthatmaly, built the 33-room boutique property, which is anchored by the 1938 residence. The royal couple raised their four children in this house while Khamtan served as prefect of the provinces of Vientiane, Luang Prabang, and Sainyabuli. He died in a plane crash; his wife lived in the house until her death. In 2001, the house was converted into a hotel. ==References== * http://www.villa- maly.com/press/HistoryMaly.pdf Category:Royal residences in Laos Category:Buildings and structures in Luang Prabang Category:Houses completed in 1938 ",
