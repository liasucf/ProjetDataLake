    "text": "John Stapleton (born 21 June 1952) is an Australian journalist. The first money he ever made out of writing was in 1974 when he was co-winner of a short story competition held by what was then Australia's leading cultural celebration, the Adelaide Arts Festival. He graduated from Macquarie University in 1975 with a double major in philosophy and did post-graduate work with the Sociology Department at Flinders University. As a freelance journalist in the 1970s and 1980s, while alternating between living in Sydney and London, his articles and fiction appeared in a wide range of magazines, newspapers and anthologies, including The Australian Financial Review and The Tagg File, having interviewed Alfred W. McCoy for the latter in 1980.McCoy, Alfred W. \"Name: Alfred McCoy, Occupation: Author.\" Interview by John Stapleton. The Tagg File, 1980, pp. 5, 7-8, 10-11.

He worked for the national newspaper The Australian from 1994 to 2009. His books include: Thailand: Deadly Destination; Terror in Australia: Workers' Paradise Lost; Hideout in the Apocalypse and Hunting the Famous.
