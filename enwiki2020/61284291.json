    "text": "The Australasian Performing Right Association Awards of 1989-1990 (generally known as APRA Awards) are a series of awards held in May 1991. The APRA Music Awards were presented by Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) and the Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society (AMCOS). APRA-AMCOS changed the timing of their awards ceremony from May to the previous November and hence a special presentation for 1989/90 recipients was made at the 1991 ceremony.
