He was of Jewish descent. Goldsmith's maternal uncle was composer and professor Michael Hennagin. He was the main composer for the TV series Stargate SG-1, although the main titles were written by David Arnold (who composed the score to Stargate, the film that began the Stargate franchise). For Stargate Atlantis, Goldsmith composed the main titles and the score. He also composed the main title theme and score for the second season of the CBS series Martial Law. During his career, he usually collaborated with two composers; his father Jerry Goldsmith, and Neal Acree. He made his first move into video games music in 2006, scoring Call of Duty 3.
