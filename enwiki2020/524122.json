    "text": "The metre\u2013tonne\u2013second or MTS system of units is a system of physical units. It was invented in France, hence the unit names sth\u00e8ne and pi\u00e8ze, and became its legal system between 1919 and 1961 (\"d\u00e9cret\" 5 May 1961, \"Journal Officiel\"). It was adopted by the Soviet Union in 1933 and abolished there in 1955. It was a metric and coherent system of units, much as SI and the centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system (CGS), but with larger units for industrial use, whereas the CGS system was regarded as suitable for laboratory use only. == Units == The base units of the MTS system are: * Length: metre * Volume: cubic metre or stere *: 1 m3 \u2261 1 st * Mass: tonne, *: 1 t = 103 kg = 1 Mg * Time: second Some common derived units: * Force: sth\u00e8ne, *: 1 sn = 1 t\u22c5m/s2 = 103 N = 1 kN * Energy: sth\u00e8ne-metre = kilojoule, *: 1 sn\u22c5m = 1 t\u22c5m2/s2 = 103 J = 1 kJ * Power: sth\u00e8ne-metre per second = kilowatt, *: 1 sn\u22c5m/s = 1 t\u22c5m2/s3 = 103 W = 1 kW * Pressure: pi\u00e8ze, *: 1 pz = 1 t/m\u22c5s2 = 103 Pa = 1 kPa = 1 centibar (cbar) == See also == *Metre\u2013kilogram\u2013second system of units (MKS) *Foot\u2013pound\u2013second system of units (FPS) == References == Category:Systems of units Category:Metric system ",
