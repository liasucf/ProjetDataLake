    "text": "The Southern High Rh\u00f6n (, also S\u00fcdliche Hohe Rh\u00f6nEnvironmental Atlas of Hesse (Umweltatlas Hessen) is a natural region of the 5th level which, together with the Central Rh\u00f6n, forms the region called the High Rh\u00f6n. This low mountainous region has several peaks over 900 metres high, including the Dammersfeldkuppe (927.9 m), the Kreuzberg (927.8 m) and the Eierhauckberg (909.9 m) == Natural regions == The Southern High Rh\u00f6n was first defined in 1968 as a natural region as part of the natural regional classification of Germany at a map scale of 1:200,000 (Sheet 140 Schweinfurt) and is grouped and divided as follows:Brigitte Schwenzer: Geographische Landesaufnahme: the natural region units on Sheet 140 Schweinfurt - Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Landeskunde, Bad Godesberg, 1968 \u2192 online map (pdf, 4 MB) *(part of no. 35 East Hesse Highlands) **(part of no. 354 High Rh\u00f6n) *** 354.0 Southern High Rh\u00f6n ****354.00 Dammersfeld Ridge (in the north and west of the area) ****354.01 Black Mountains (in the south of the area) ****354.02 Kreuzberg Group (in the east of the area) == Boundaries == In the east the area borders on the Eastern South Rh\u00f6n, in the southeast on the Hammelburg South Rh\u00f6n, both parts of the South Rh\u00f6n and the major region (3rd level) of the Odenwald, Spessart and South Rh\u00f6n within the South German Scarplands (2nd level). In the west there are areas of the Western and Eastern Kuppenrh\u00f6n, which is part of the Anterior and Kuppenrh\u00f6n. In the north is the Central Rh\u00f6n, also part of the High Rh\u00f6n. Together with the Anterior and Kuppenrh\u00f6n the High Rh\u00f6n is part of the East Hesse Highlands. == Natural region == From Heidelstein two mountain ridges radiate south and southwest, separated by the Sinn. The southwesternmost is the Dammersfeld Ridge, which forms a contiguous and predominantly basaltic unit. The ridge radiating southwards is divided into the more northerly Kreuzberg Group and the more southerly Black Mountains. == References == Category:Mountain ranges of Bavaria Category:Mountain ranges of Hesse Category:Rh\u00f6n Mountains Category:Natural regions of the East Hesse Highlands Category:Rh\u00f6n-Grabfeld Category:Bad Kissingen (district) Category:Fulda (district) ",
