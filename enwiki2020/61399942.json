    "text": "You Got Me Singing is the first collaborative studio album and fourth overall by American singer-songwriter Amanda Palmer, recorded with her father Jack Palmer. It was released on July 15, 2016 through Amanda Palmer's label 8 ft. Records and Cooking Vinyl. It peaked at 16 on the American Americana/Folk Albums chart. In August 2015, Palmer and her father went to a cabin in Upstate New York when she was eight months pregnant. Anxious about her impending motherhood and looking to connect with her own father who was absent for most of her early childhood, they decided to record an album of covers together. The album's cover pays homage to Bob Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home. ==Promotion== A cover of \"So Much Wine\" by The Handsome Family was released as a promotional single on December 15, 2015 exclusively on Bandcamp. However, the song did not make it on the album. A cover of \"All I Could Do\" by Kimya Dawson was released as the album's first single on September 15, 2015. A cover of \"1952 Vincent Black Lightning\" by Richard John Thompson was released as the second single on May 3, 2016 alongside an official music video animated by David Mack. A music video was released for \"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod\" on October 19, 2016. The video was directed by Jim Batt and Kim Boekbinder and features cameos from many of the Palmers' friends including Jason Webley and multiple cast members from the podcast Welcome to Night Vale. An animated music video drawn by Chiara Ambrosio was released on October 31, 2016. ==Reception== On Metacritic the albums holds a score of 72 based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" Rob Wacey for Allmusic called the album \" Beautifully delivered, both father and daughter complement each other's vocals extremely well\" and that \"for an album of cover songs, the result still feels entirely personal and held dear when hearing the father and daughter pay tribute to their inspirations together.\" Dan Fielding for The Line of Best Fit said \"Standing alone, this a warming set of tastefully executed covers. But see the album in its context and you\u2019ll find its beauty \u2013 a record of music repairing a once strained relationship.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits taken from the album liner notes * Amanda Palmer \u2013 vocals, piano, ukulele, glockenspiel, mellotron, vibraphone, production * Jack Palmer \u2013 vocals, guitar * Joe Costa \u2013 tambourine, thundersheet, engineering * Kyle Cassidy \u2013 photography * Emily Weiland \u2013 design implementation * Joe Costa \u2013 recording and mixing * Rob Stein \u2013 pedal steel * Fluid Mastering \u2013 mastering ==References== Category:2016 albums Category:Collaborative albums Category:Folk albums by American artists Category:Crowdfunded albums Category:Amanda Palmer albums ",
