    "text": "Huigsloot () is a hamlet in the Dutch municipality of Haarlemmermeer, in the province of North Holland. It is located on the southeast of a polder, on Ringvaart, between Buitenkaag and Vredeburg. Before the creation of the polder of Haarlemmermeer, Huigsloot formed an isthmus in the lake. This isthmus was cut off from the nearby land by the construction of a canal in Ringvaart, which also formed a parcel of former land into a polder. The road from Huigsloot to Abbenes runs close to the centre of the former isthmus. == Sources == Category:Haarlemmermeer Category:Populated places in North Holland ",
