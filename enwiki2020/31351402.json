    "text": "Johann Georg Meyer von Bremen (28 October 1813 Bremen, Germany \u2013 4 December 1886 Berlin), commonly known as Meyer von Bremen, was a German painter who specialized in Biblical, peasant, and family scenes. Georg Meyer \u2018Schlafendes Geschwisterpaar\u2019 (Sleeping sisters; 1851) In his 21st year, he went to D\u00fcsseldorf and began his studies at the Academy of Art there, which was led by Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, the son of sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow. He is associated with the D\u00fcsseldorf school of painting. In 1841, Meyer opened a studio of his own, but moved to Berlin as his fame increased (1853). While scenes from the Bible were first the subjects of his brush, he later turned his attention to incidents from popular life, especially among the Hessian peasantry, and finally to the portrayal of family life in its pathetic aspect. Such pictures as \u2018The Jubilee of a Hessian Pastor\u2019 (1843), \u2018Christmas Eve,\u2019 \u2018Blindman's Buff,\u2019 \u2018The Soldier's Return,\u2019 \u2018The Inundation\u2019 (1846), \u2018The Repentant Daughter\u2019 (1852, in the gallery at Bremen), are full of intense sympathy with the \u201csimple annals of the poor.\u201d After taking up his residence at Berlin, he chose especially scenes from child life, which he rendered with spirited humor. Among his pictures of this kind are: 'The Little Flower Girl(1853)', \u2018The Fairy Tale,\u2019 \u2018Children Playing Blindman's Buff,\u2019 \u2018Grandfather and Grandchild,\u2019 and others. A third group of his pictures includes those of young women, as single figures or in groups, such as \u2018The Tryst\u2019 and \u2018The Love Letter.\u2019 An example of his work, \u2018The Letter\u2019 (1873), is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. ==Notes== ==References== * * Johann Georg Meyer article at German Wikipedia ==External links== Category:1813 births Category:1886 deaths Category:19th-century German painters Category:German male painters Category:Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf alumni ",
