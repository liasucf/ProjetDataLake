    "text": "\"Abhi Mujh Mein Kahin\" (English: \"Still, somewhere inside me\") is a song from the movie Agneepath, sung by Sonu Nigam, with music by Ajay-Atul and lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya and was picturized on Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka Chopra. This song describes many feelings in a single line. It describes the short life of love too. ==Reception== Bollywood Hungama: 'Sonu Nigam, who is always a delight to listen to, especially when it comes to soulful romantic tracks, strikes again with 'Abhi Mujh Mein Kahin'. Just the kind of song that was pretty much required to give a sense of completeness to Agneepath, this one also boasts of some poetic writing by Amitabh Bhattacharya. Even though it isn't catchy enough to become the next big chartbuster, 'Abhi Mujh Mein Kahin' still has good enough holding power to keep you engaged while it plays.' Rediff: 'The album enters a dramatic mood shift when Sonu Nigam hits a silvery note to muse over the philosophy of life and its many challenges in the sentimental poetry and easygoing pace of Abhi Mujh Mein Kahin. Nicely done, Ajay-Atul.' Koimoi: 'Abhi mujh mein kahi is a soothing romantic track sung by Sonu Nigam. The song is mellow, gentle, romantic and contemplative. Nigam\u2019s vocal dexterity has been very successful in conveying the intensity of the song. The violin also has been marvelously used in the song.' ==Awards and Nominations== The song was popular and won the following awards: *Mirchi Music Song of the Year 2012 - Abhi Mujh Mein Kahin *Mirchi Music Award for Male Vocalist of The Year 2012 - Sonu Nigam *Mirchi Music Award for Music Composer of The Year 2012 - Ajay-Atul *14th IIFA Award for Best Lyrics \u2014 Amitabh Bhattacharya *14th IIFA Award for Best Playback Singer (Male) - Sonu Nigam *Zee Cine Award for Best Playback Singer (Male) - Sonu Nigam The song was also nominated for the following: ===58th Filmfare Awards=== *Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist \u2014 Amitabh Bhattacharya *Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer \u2014 Sonu Nigam ===5th Mirchi Music Awards=== * Lyricist of The Year - Amitabh Bhattacharya * Song Recording/Sound Engineering of the Year - Vijay Dayal ===Others=== GiMA Award for Best Lyricist \u2014 Amitabh Bhattacharya ==References== Category:Indian songs Category:Hindi film songs Category:Sonu Nigam songs Category:2012 songs Category:Songs with lyrics by Amitabh Bhattacharya ",
