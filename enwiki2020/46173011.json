    "text": "Ngok Lual Yak is an African sub-tribe, within the Ji\u00eb\u014b (Dinka) group. They are mainly found in Malakal, South Sudan and inhabit the land along the confluences of the Nile and Sobat rivers. It is believed that the sub-tribe numbers about 95,000. They are devoted ethnics and believe in De\u014bdit as their provider. Some of Ngok sections are part of Bor Community and sections who identifies themselves as descendants of Ngok could still be traced! == History == In the 17th century, it was believed that the People of Ngokland (Ngok Lual Yak) came to the shore of River Nile from the other side of the Lower Nile. Moving from the west to the east, they came to control the region of the Upper Nile River, pushing out the Funj and Jur, the Achol Eliot (Acholi?). In the 18th century, with the arrival of the Nuer, Lual Yak together with his age- group and Ngok at large was forced to evacuate some areas, like Gaak-yuom in Bor, Jokou in Gajaak, Pakoop in Ayuaal, Pabiech in Kongoor and Piny-Wuut. They were pushed by the Nuer along the Sobat into the mouth of the Nile in Malakal. The Ngok Lual Yak became the owners of the land that runs from Malakal to Dome (D\u00f6m\u00eb), Dini and Abwong (Ab\u0254\u0308\u014b) Cheng Nyankiir along the River Sobat into the Nile at Malakal. The main borders with Nuer are Nyinrool as the border with Lou Nuer, Cuei on the side of Kurmiyom with Jikeny and Aboorbioong on the Lang-nom (Ulang) side and Nyinwak with Nuer Yom (Gajaak). The Ngokland people lived in two groups, namely Yom and Weny. Each group was further divided into sections and again into subsections. Ngok Lual Yak people owned NgokLand. They developed a skillful traditional culture and a close spiritual bond with the land. Early settlers were experts in hunting, fishing, farming, grazing and were skillful in spear and stick fighting. NgokLand ownership was by and for the people of Ngok Lual Yak. === People, land and early migration === Ngok Lual Yak as a group is an original Jieng Group. The Jieng began with the single family of Deng with his wife Abuk. One myth tells that Deng after his mythical death turned out to be an unreasonable phenomena, thus deriving the Jieng to worship Deng as commonly known today as Dengdit. Another myth explains that Deng is regarded as the main source that generate water. This caused the crops to grow. Facts about the Dengdit are yet to be known, but is akin to the Biblical story of Adam and Eve. Deng and Abuk are the twin marital progenitors of the Jieng Origin. Deng and Abuk are where Ngok People came from. Ngok Lual Yak as a tribe branched out of Jieng group and staked out its own historical line. Ngok Lual Yak converged into the following groups. == Ngok Lual Yak groups == === Yom group === Tol *Awier *Baliet Yom *Duut *Balak *Dhiaak === Weny group === Paan Man Gok *Ajuba *Adong Paan Man Weny *Abiei *Ngaar *Achaak *Jook *Diing == Other Ngok groups == Ngok is part of the biggest chain of the other groups of Ngok like Ngok de Jook.
