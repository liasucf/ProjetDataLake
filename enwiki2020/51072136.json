Lady of the Lake was ordered by the Ullswater Steam Navigation Company, a predecessor of the current owners, to a design by Douglas Henson of Penrith. She was built by T.B. Seath & Co at Rutherglen near Glasgow, transported in three sections by rail to Penrith, and thence by horse drays to Waterside near Pooley Bridge. She was assembled on the slipway at Waterside and launched on 26 June 1877. In 1881 the Lady of the Lake sank at her moorings but was re- floated by a team of divers. In 1936 she was converted from steam to diesel power. The vessel sank again in 1950 in a severe storm, but was again re- floated. In 1965 the vessel was badly damaged by fire and was out of service for 14 years, before being restored and reengined. She was re-launched on 19 May 1979 by William Whitelaw. ==Gallery== File:Lady of the Lake (5383661365).jpg|The bow of Lady of the Lake File:Glenridding Pier - geograph.org.uk - 259939.jpg|Lady of the Lake at Glenridding.
