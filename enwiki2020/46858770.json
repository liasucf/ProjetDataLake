J. Baker received a Royal Pardon. He married Harriet Brown in Hobart Town on 6 November 1837 (Rev. William Bedford officiating) and moved to South Australia aboard the Timbo, arriving at Port Adelaide in April 1846. He set up in business as a cornfactor and seedsman (grain merchant) in Rundle Street. His brother Charles arrived in Adelaide in 1848, for a time working as a contractor then joined Daniel as \"Fisher Brothers\", (not to be confused with the earlier hardware firm of the same name run by the unrelated James Hurtle Fisher). Charles left the partnership in October 1856 and set up in Grenfell Street on his own account. Daniel joined the gold rush to Victoria, but returned to Adelaide without having made a fortune. Other members of his family joined him in South Australia. He was convicted of assault after repeatedly charging his brother-in-law George P. Harris (co-founder of Harris Scarfe) on horseback and making threatening gestures. In a letter to the Adelaide Times, D. Fisher stated that there was great provocation given. ===Public life=== He was prominent in the defence of John Stephens, editor of the South Australian Register. He served on the Adelaide City Council from 1852 to 1855 and retired from business in 1856. He visited England in 1861, and in 1865 contested the election for seat of East Torrens in the South Australian House of Assembly but was unsuccessful. Two years later one of the successful candidates, Neville Blyth, resigned on a point of honour, and Fisher won the resulting by-election and served from July 1867 to May 1870. His colleagues were Randolph Isham Stow, who resigned in May 1868 then George Pearce. He was elected Mayor of the Town of Kensington and Norwood in 1862. ===Last years=== About 1878 Fisher suffered a stroke, which left him paralysed, and withdrew totally from public life. In the last year he lost the use of his mental faculties. He died at his home Nile Street, Glenelg. ==Family== Daniel Fisher (11 November 1812 \u2013 2 June 1884) married 6 November 1837 at Hobart Town, Tasmania to Harriet Brown. They left for South Australia on board the Timbo, arriving 4 April 1846. (No record has yet been found for Harriet after her arrival in South Australia.) Daniel met, in Tasmania, his (common-law) wife Lucretia Kelk (c. 1813 \u2013 2 February 1848). Lucretia moved to Adelaide to be with him (speculation).
