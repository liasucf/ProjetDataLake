A typical Bi-Mart houses merchandise including electronics and small appliances, housewares, hardware and power tools, sporting and hunting supplies, apparel, canned and packaged food, personal care products, a drugstore and, at many locations, a pharmacy. The median size of a Bi-Mart store is . A typical Bi-Mart store in Ontario, Oregon Like Costco and Sam's Club, Bi-Mart stores are membership stores; unlike those chains, its members-only policy started as a workaround to fair trade laws established in the United States in the 1930s such as the Miller-Tydings Act and those related to suggested retail prices. Thus, the membership for an entire family costs $5 and never expires. The company was founded in 1955 and is headquartered in Eugene, Oregon. As of mid-2018, there are 79 store locations. Bi-Mart's first store opened in Yakima, Washington in 1955, but it did not open a second store until 1962. In 1976, Bi-Mart was bought by Pay 'n Save, which itself was acquired by Thrifty Corporation in 1984. It was subsequently merged into the former Kmart subsidiary PayLess Drug, and finally purchased by Rite Aid in 1996. In 1997, Bi-Mart's management and Endeavour Capital (a Portland-based venture capital firm) bought the company; they sold it to employees March 1, 2004, for $94 million, which included $12.5 million contributed from the 401(k) plan. Bi-Mart is the sole surviving store name of former Pay 'n Save subsidiaries. (Schucks Auto Supply retained its name until acquired by O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. and rebranded in 2010.) In October 2003, Bi-Mart announced it was expanding eastward. Eight stores were planned with the first store in Havre, Montana. The second store opened three years later in Weiser, Idaho. In 2006, Bi-Mart exited the Montana market due to poor sales. ==Pharmacy Closures== In 2019, Bi-Mart announced the closure of pharmacies at their East Wenatchee, Washington location, two locations in Vancouver, Washington, and their location in Scappoose, Oregon. Bi-Mart announced in November, 2019 that it will also close pharmacies at an additional 13 stores in the Portland area. https://www.kptv.com/news/bi-mart- ending-pharmacy-services-at-stores-around-portland- area/article_07f37dbc-0269-11ea-a3f6-575e5c40de2c.html The stores affected by the pharmacy closures will remain open. ==Cascade Farm and Outdoor== In 2014, Bi-Mart opened its first location under the Cascade Farm and Outdoor name in Walla Walla, Washington. Bi-Mart announced that they were looking at empty buildings in a variety of locations for future stores. Additional locations have since opened in Coos Bay, Oregon and Keizer, Oregon. Unlike Bi-Mart's regular stores, a membership is not required at Cascade Farm and Outdoor. ==References== == External links == * *Smaller and steady win the race, a December 2004 article from The Oregonian Category:Companies based in Eugene, Oregon Category:Retail companies established in 1955 Category:Discount stores of the United States Category:Economy of the Northwestern United States Category:Employee-owned companies of the United States Category:Pay 'n Save Category:1955 establishments in Oregon ",
