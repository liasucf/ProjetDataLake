The double triple decker apartment house was built in 1897, during the last major phase of development on the city's South Side, and is one of its only surviving houses of that type. It has well-preserved Colonial Revival features, including a dentillated and modillioned cornice. Its front entry is flanked by a pair of bowed window projections, and is sheltered by a portico supported by Tuscan columns. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Waltham, Massachusetts ==References== Category:Apartment buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Massachusetts Category:Residential buildings completed in 1897 Category:Buildings and structures in Waltham, Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Waltham, Massachusetts ",
