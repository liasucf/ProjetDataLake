    "text": "\"I Wanna Be Adored\" is a song by the British rock band The Stone Roses. It was the first track on their debut album, The Stone Roses, and was released as a single. The US release charted at number 18 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart in 1990. In 1991, the single was released in the UK, Germany and Japan featuring previously unreleased B-sides. ==Composition== \"I Wanna Be Adored\" begins with a collage of sounds. The first instrument to enter is the bass guitar, which appears 40 seconds in. This is followed by two guitars, one of which plays a pentatonic scale riff. The bass drum enters at 1:13, and the main portion of the song begins at 1:30.Rooksby, p. 126 The song is performed in the key of G. The song features two main sections: a four bar G-D-G-D-Em chord progression, followed by an eight-bar bridge that shifts from D to C repeatedly. The song's lyrics are minimalist, mainly consisting of the lines \"I don't need to sell my soul/He's already in me\" and the song's title repeated throughout the entire song. ==Reception== In 2006, the music magazine Q voted it 32nd in its list of 100 greatest songs of all time. In May 2007, NME magazine placed \"I Wanna Be Adored\" at number 17 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever. VH2 placed the song at #2 on the Indie 500, a countdown of their top 500 indie songs of all time. Though \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" by The Smiths was at number one, on a condensed version showing just the top 50, the songs had swapped places with \"I Wanna Be Adored\" at number one. Stylus Magazine also included the song's bassline at number 17 in their 2005 list of the \"Top 50 Basslines of All Time\". == In popular culture == Oasis refer to The Stone Roses by quoting the song in \"Magic Pie\": \"They are sleeping while they dream/and they who wanna be adored\".
