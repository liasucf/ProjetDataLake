(approximately 3m) high bronze sculpture by Jamaican artist Laura Facey. The sculpture features a male and female figure gazing to the skies \u2013 symbolic of their triumphant rise from the horrors of slavery. The statue was unveiled in July 2003, in time for the park's first anniversary. The Adinkra symbols can be seen at many places in the park as a tribute to honour the ancestors of Jamaicans who were brought as slaves from West Africa. The architect Kamau Kambui has used these symbols in the perimeter fence, the walls at the entrance, the benches and garbage receptacles. == References == The park was opened July 10 ==See also== *Parque de la Abolici\u00f3n == External links == Official website Category:Tourist attractions in Kingston, Jamaica Category:Black people in art Category:Cultural depictions of Bob Marley ",
