Born in Carstairs, Lanarkshire to a family of farm workers, Walker initially worked on the railways, before moving to England. He enlisted in the British Army and served in the Second Boer War. When demobbed, he became involved in trade union organising in the English Midlands, for National Union of Agricultural Workers (NUAW), soon moving to join its head office, in Fakenham.Claire Griffiths, Labour and the Countryside: The Politics of Rural Britain 1918-1939 Active in the Labour Party, Walker stood unsuccessfully in King's Lynn at the 1918 and 1922 general elections, then at Ormskirk in 1923 and 1924. He was asked to stand at the 1923 Ludlow by- election, but declined, correctly judging that the party had little support in the area.Stuart Ball and Ian Holliday, Mass Conservatism, p. 40 Walker was elected as general secretary of the NUAW in 1912 and pursued a radical, socialist programme. In 1918, he moved the union's headquarters from Fakenham to London in an attempt to broaden its national appeal, but this initially had little success, and removed him from direct influence in the union's activities in the county.Howard Newby, The deferential farm worker: a study of farm workers in Norfolk, p. 221 He achieved a national profile with the Trades Union Congress, being elected to its Parliamentary Committee in 1917, then serving as president in 1921\u201322.\"Details of Past Congresses \", Trades Union Congress In 1928, Walker stood down as general secretary of the NUAW in controversial circumstances. Although the union officially stated that he had retired on age grounds,Bob Wynn, Skilled at all trades: the history of the farmworkers' union, 1947-1984, p. 72 it was hinted that he had been forced out on ground of financial impropriety.Claire Griffiths, Labour and the Countryside: The Politics of Rural Britain 1918-1939, p. 205 He subsequently emigrated to Australia. He died in Perth in 1961.Australia, Death Index, 1787-1985 ==References== Category:1878 births Category:1961 deaths Category:Scottish emigrants to Australia Category:Labour Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:General Secretaries of the National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers Category:Presidents of the Trades Union Congress Category:Members of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress Category:Members of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress ",
