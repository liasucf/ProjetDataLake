    "text": "Fritz Ullmann (July 2, 1875 in F\u00fcrth - March 17, 1939 in Berlin) was a German chemist. Ullmann was born in F\u00fcrth and started studying chemistry in Nuremberg, but received his PhD of the University of Geneva for work with Carl Gr\u00e4be in 1895. After some time in Geneva he went to Berlin in 1905. Ullmann taught technical chemistry during 1905-1913 and 1922-1925 at the Technischen Hochschule Berlin now Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, first as part of the ordinary teaching staff, later on as a professor. In 1900 he introduced dimethyl sulfate as an alkylating agent. Between 1914 and 1922, when he was back in Geneva, he published the first edition of the \"Enzyklop\u00e4die der Technischen Chemie\" in 12 volumes () in English the Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, a publication that exists to this day. He was married to Irma Goldberg who was his assistant from 1905 to 1910 at his laboratory. They named after themselves the following reactions: the Ullmann reaction, the Ullmann condensation, the Graebe-Ullmann synthesis, the Goldberg reaction and the illustrious Jordan-Ullmann-Goldberg synthesis. == References == * Category:German chemists Category:Technical University of Berlin faculty Category:University of Geneva alumni Category:People from F\u00fcrth Category:1875 births Category:1939 deaths ",
