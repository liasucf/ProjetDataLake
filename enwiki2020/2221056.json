    "text": "Chrysler's L platform was used in a family of compact automobiles produced from 1978 to 1990. It was created in response to the energy crisis of the 1970s and was a line of similar Dodge and Plymouth vehicles. The Dodge vehicles except for the Rampage are common, but the Plymouth clones, except for the Horizon didn't match half the sales numbers of the Dodge versions, and are very collectible today because only handfuls of TC3s, Scamps, and Turismos were made. * Dodge ** 1978-1990 Dodge Omni ** 1979-1982 Dodge Omni 024 ** 1982-1984 Dodge Rampage ** 1983-1987 Dodge Charger * Plymouth ** 1978-1990 Plymouth Horizon ** 1979-1982 Plymouth Horizon TC3 ** 1983 Plymouth Scamp ** 1983-1987 Plymouth Turismo ==See also== * List of Chrysler platforms L ",
