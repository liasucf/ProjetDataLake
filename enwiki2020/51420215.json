    "text": "Gorgippos I or Gorgippus () was a son of Satyros I and was a Spartocid joint ruler with his brother Leukon (389 - 349 BC) of the Bosporan Kingdom. He situated himself on the Asiatic side of the kingdom, in Gorgippia where he presumably ruled until his death in 349 BC. ==Wars of Expansion== Gorgippos was a prominent figure of the Bosporan Wars of Expansion, having been the joint-ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom alongside his brother Leukon upon the death of their father Satyros I. He also seems to have ended the war his father had unsuccessfully began with queen Tirgatao of the Maeotians, who had been wronged by Satyros earlier on in diplomatic relations with Hekataios. Additionally, he seems to have renamed Sindia, the capital of the Sindike Kingdom, to Gorgippia, after himself. Gorgippos was described by the Athenians as a \"detested tyrant\", including Paerisades I, and Satyros I in an oral argument against Demosthenes, the famed Athenian orator, as well as for having statues due to his grandfather's relation with the Spartocids, and the annual thousand bushels. Gorgippos's daughter of possible Sindian descent, Komosarye, would later marry her cousin Paerisades I, a son of Leukon and later ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom. ==References== Category:4th-century BC rulers Category:Rulers of the Bosporan Kingdom Category:349 BC deaths ",
