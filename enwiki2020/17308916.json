HW Media currently provides Usenet services to ISPs and resellers. HW Media is consistently in the Top 10 out on the TOP1000 Usenet Servers. == HW Media anticompetitive practices controversy == HW Media (the part of Highwinds still owned by Omicron Media) is well known for its reseller services and claiming to be the Usenet server with the largest retention. However, resellers of HW media fail to disclose that they work with the company. Most people who buy multiple accounts for increased binary completion end up buying multiple accounts from different HW resellers. This leads to people paying multiple times for the same service. This has drawn criticism from Usenet users that HW Media is trying to deceive customers by not making their resellers disclose their affiliation with HW Media.
