James Duperon B\u00e2by (August 25, 1763 \u2013 February 19, 1833) was a judge and political figure in Upper Canada. ==Biography== He was born Jacques B\u00e2by, the son of Jacques B\u00e2by dit Duperon, to a prosperous family in Detroit in 1763. His last name is pronounced \"Baw-bee\" and has been anglicized in different lines (e.g. Baubie, Bauby). He was educated in Upper Canada (i.e., what is now the province of Ontario), where his uncle, Fran\u00e7ois B\u00e2by, lived. In 1792, he was appointed to the Executive Council and Legislative Council of Upper Canada and became lieutenant for Kent County. In 1793, he was appointed judge in the Western District. After the Jay Treaty in 1795, the B\u00e2by family left the Detroit area and moved to Sandwich (now Windsor). (Today his house is owned by the Ontario Heritage Trust and is used for government offices.) Over the years, the family acquired large amounts of land in the western region of Upper Canada. B\u00e2by was put in charge of the 1st Kent militia. During the War of 1812, Sandwich was seized by the Americans, and B\u00e2by was later taken prisoner at the Battle of the Thames. During the American occupation, his property suffered extensive damage. In 1815, he was appointed Inspector General and moved to York (now Toronto), where he was a politician, judge, wealthy landowner, and part of the ruling clique known as the Family Compact. In 1816, he purchased land on the east bank of the Humber, formerly the site of the Seneca Teiaiagon village, land known today as \"B\u00e2by Point.\" In 1823, he represented Upper Canada in resolving a dispute with Lower Canada over the sharing of customs revenues. A Roman Catholic, he helped establish the first Catholic church at York, St. Paul's. Baby was a slave-owner, who opposed Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe's efforts to prohibit slavery in Upper Canada. ==Personal== He died at York in 1833. == External links == *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online ==References== * Category:1763 births Category:1833 deaths Category:People from British Detroit Category:Members of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada Category:French Quebecers Category:Canadian people of the War of 1812 Category:Upper Canada judges Category:Canadian Roman Catholics ",
