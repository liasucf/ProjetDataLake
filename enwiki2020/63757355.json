They began work on Some Kind of Hate the following year. Mortimer and DeLeeuw set out to combine the slasher genre with indie drama. A Nightmare on Elm Street, Carrie and Let the Right One In were used as inspiration during the writing process. ===Pre-production=== In April 2014, Some Kind of Hate was officially announced along with the castings of Ronen Rubinstein, Grace Phipps, Sierra McCormick, Lexi Atkins, Maestro Harrell, Noah Segan, Michael Polish, Jasper Polish, Spencer Breslin, Brando Eaton and Jeremy Hawkins. Dallas Sonnier and Jack Heller of Caliber Media signed on to produce the film alongside Amanda Mortimer and Revek Entertainment's Gabriela Revilla. The casting of A.N.T Farm star McCormick, who was hired at the \"last minute\", was used to draw in her younger fanbase, as Mortimer wanted to create \"the first intense horror movie experience that some of these kids will ever have\". ===Filming=== Production began in Los Angeles and Castaic, California in April 2014. ==Release== Some Kind of Hate debuted at the Stanley Film Festival on May 2, 2015. The film was released on September 18, 2015, by RLJ Entertainment. ===Home Media=== The film was released on blu-ray and DVD on November 3, 2015. ==Reception== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Some Kind of Hate holds an approval rating of 38% based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 4.57/10. On Metacritic, the film holds an average score of 28 out of 100 based on 5 reviews, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". Scott Weinberg of Nerdist called the film \"brutal, disturbing, and sometimes tragic, but it\u2019s also a pointed, angry film that has a lot to say about the nature of \u201cpsychological predators\u201d and their victims.\" For Bloody Disgusting, Mike Wilson said \"Some Kind Of Hate deserves more praise than complaint, however. The acting is largely well done, and the script by Mortimer and DeLeeuw definitely attempt to give the characters more dimension than what you\u2019d normally expect from a film like this.\" Helen T. Verongos, writing for The New York Times said \"Some Kind of Hate succeeds at being discomfiting\" but that the film \"fails to deliver a thrill\". Nick Schager of The Village Voice wrote \"Like so much teen-targeting modern horror, it opts for dull angsty brooding over the very sort of grim-and-gruesome sleaziness that might have made its premise interesting.\" For The Los Angeles Times, Gary Goldstein called the film a \"convoluted slashfest\". ==References== ==External links== * * Some Kind of Hate' on The Numbers Category:2015 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2010s slasher films Category:American slasher films ",
