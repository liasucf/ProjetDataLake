    "text": "Semaeostomeae (literally \"flag mouths\") is an order of large jellyfish characterized by four long, frilly oral arms flanking their quadrate mouths. The umbrella is domed with scalloped margins, and the gastrovascular system consists of four unbranched pouches radiating outwards from the central stomach; no ring canal is present. They usually possess eight tentacles; four are per-radical and four are inter-radical. ==Taxonomy== The order consists of four families. * Family Cyaneidae * Family DrymonematidaeBayha, K. M., and M. N. Dawson (2010). New family of allomorphic jellyfishes, Drymonematidae (Scyphozoa, Discomedusae), emphasizes evolution in the functional morphology and trophic ecology of gelatinous zooplankton. The Biological Bulletin 219(3): 249\u2013267 * Family Pelagiidae * Family Ulmaridae ==Differentiation== The three traditional families, Pelagiidae, Cyaneidae, and Ulmaridae, are distinguishable by these characteristics: * Gastrovascular cavity divided by radial septa into rhopalar and tentacular pouches **Pouches simple and unbranched \u2013 Pelagiidae **Pouches branched \u2013 Cyaneidae *Gastrovascular system in form of unbranched and branching canals, or with anastomosing radial canals \u2013 Ulmaridae In addition, members of the Pelagiidae have no ring canal, and the marginal tentacles arise from umbrella margin. Three genera are in this family. ==Gallery== Image:Haeckel Discomedusae 18.jpg Image:Haeckel Discomedusae 28.jpg Image:Haeckel Discomedusae 8.jpg|\"Discomedusae\" plate from Ernst Haeckel's Kunstformen der Natur, 1904 ==References== *Ruppert, Edward E.; and Fox, Richard S.
