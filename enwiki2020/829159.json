    "text": "The , also known as the Trans-Tokyo Bay Expressway, is an expressway that is mainly made up of a bridge\u2013tunnel combination across Tokyo Bay in Japan. It connects the city of Kawasaki in Kanagawa Prefecture with the city of Kisarazu in Chiba Prefecture, and forms part of National Route 409. With an overall length of 23.7 km, it includes a 4.4 km bridge and 9.6 km tunnel underneath the bay--the fourth-longest underwater tunnel in the world. == Overview == At the bridge-tunnel crossover point, there is an artificial island called with a rest area consisting of restaurants, shops and amusement facilities. Air is supplied to the tunnel by a distinctive tower in the middle of the tunnel, called the Kaze no T\u014d (\u306e, \"the tower of wind\"), which uses the bay's almost- constant winds as a power source. The road opened on December 18, 1997, after 23 years of planning and 9 years of construction at a cost of 1.44 trillion yen (US$11.2 billion at the time of opening). The Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line reduced the drive between Chiba and Kanagawa, two important industrial regions, from 90 to 15 minutes, and also contributed to cutting the travel time to the sea leisure area in the southern part of the B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula from Tokyo and Kanagawa. Before the tunnel opened, one had to drive around about 100 km along the shores of Tokyo Bay and pass through downtown Tokyo. One goal expressed during the planning of the Aqua-Line was to reduce the traffic through downtown Tokyo, but as the highway toll is quite high, the reduction in Tokyo traffic has not been as great as expected. Many highway bus services now use the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, including lines from Tokyo Station, Yokohama Station, Kawasaki Station, Shinagawa Station, Shibuya Station, Shinjuku Station and Haneda Airport to Kisarazu, Kimitsu, Nagaura station, Ichihara, Mobara, T\u014dgane, Kamogawa, Katsuura and Tateyama. == Tolls == The cash toll for a single trip on the Aqua-Line is \u00a53000 for ordinary-size cars (\u00a52400 for kei cars); however, using the ETC (electronic toll collection) system, the fare is \u00a52320 (\u00a51860 for kei cars). The ETC toll is reduced to \u00a51000 on Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays. In general, tolls for usage of the Aqua-Line in either direction are collected at the mainline toll plaza on the Kisarazu end. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- |+Toll table of Tokyo-bay Aqua Line (Kawasaki-Ukishima Junction \u2013 Kisarazu-Kaneda Interchange) |- !Type of car!!Toll!!ETC Aqua-Line Special discount!!ETC Pilot Test discount (from July 2009) |- |Normal cars||3,000JPY||2,320JPY||800JPY |- |Midsize cars||3,600JPY||2,780JPY||960JPY |- |Large cars||4,950JPY||3,830JPY||1,320JPY |- |Specific large cars||8,250JPY||6,380JPY||2,200JPY |- |Kei-cars and motorcycles||2,400JPY||1,860JPY||640JPY |} == See also == * List of bridge\u2013tunnels * Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel * Busan\u2013Geoje Fixed Link ==References== == External links == The Aqua-Line from above, 2015 * Japan Highways site (in Japanese) * East Nippon Expressway Company * NEXCO East's info regarding U-turns at Umi-hotaru (in Japanese) * * * * * * * * * Category:Buildings and structures in Chiba Prefecture Category:Buildings and structures in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Category:Toll bridges in Japan Category:Toll tunnels in Japan Category:Road tunnels in Japan Category:Undersea tunnels in Asia Category:Bridges completed in 1997 Category:Regional High-Standard Highways in Japan Category:Roads in Chiba Prefecture Category:Tokyo Bay Category:Tunnels completed in 1997 Category:Transport in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Immersed tube tunnels in Asia Category:Bridge\u2013tunnels in Asia Category:Expressways in Japan Category:1997 establishments in Japan ",
