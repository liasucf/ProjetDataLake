    "text": "upright \"Good-bye-ee!\" is a popular song which was written and composed by R. P. Weston and Bert Lee. Performed by music hall stars Florrie Forde, Daisy Wood, and Charles Whittle, it was a hit in 1917. Weston and Lee got the idea for the song when they saw a group of factory girls calling out goodbye to soldiers marching to Victoria station. They were saying the word in the exaggerated way which had been popularised as a catchphrase by comedian Harry Tate. The song lent its name to \"Goodbyeee\", the final episode of the sitcom Blackadder Goes Forth. ==Chorus== Good-bye-ee! good-bye-ee! Wipe the tear, baby dear, from your eye-ee. Tho' it's hard to part I know, I'll be tickled to death to go. Don't cry-ee! don't sigh-ee! There's a silver lining in the sky- ee. Bonsoir old thing, cheerio! chin chin! Nah-poo! Toodle-oo! Good-bye-ee! The salutations at the end of the chorus are from various languages. Bonsoir is French for goodnight. Chin chin is a Chinese toast. \"Nahpoo\" and \"toodle- oo\" are corruptions of the French il n'y en a plus (there is no more) and \u00e0 tout \u00e0 l'heure (see you later). ==References== Category:1917 songs Category:British patriotic songs Category:Songs of World War I Category:Florrie Forde songs Category:Songs written by R.
