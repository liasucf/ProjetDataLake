    "text": "Prague 1, formally the Prague 1 Municipal District (M\u011bstsk\u00e1 \u010d\u00e1st Praha 1), is a second-tier municipality in Prague. It is co-extensive with the national administrative district (spr\u00e1vn\u00ed obvod) of the same name. Prague 1 includes most of the medieval heart of the city. All of Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto (the Old Town) and Josefov (the Jewish Quarter) are in the district, as are most of Mal\u00e1 Strana (the Little Quarter), Hrad\u010dany and Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto (the New Town). Tiny parts of Hole\u0161ovice and Vinohrady round out the district. The district has remained intact since its creation in 1960. Most of Prague 1 is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Almost all of Prague's major tourist sites, including Prague Castle, Old Town Square, the Charles Bridge and the above-mentioned Jewish Quarter, are in the district. The Parliament of the Czech Republic and the offices of the government are in Mal\u00e1 Strana, while the main building of Charles University is in Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto. As of the end of 2004, 32,552 people lived in 18,821 homes in the district. The district covers 5.53 km\u00b2 (1,366 acres). A Prague 1 address is considered quite prestigious, and real estate here is the most expensive in the city. ==Government== The Czech Ministry of Transport is in Prague 1.\"Contact.\" Czech Ministry of Transport.
