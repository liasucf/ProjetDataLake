    "text": "George Handford (1582\u20135 - 1647), was an English Baroque composer. He spent some time in Cambridge, and may have been a pensioner at Emmanuel College, Cambridge in 1604, or a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. He married twice, at St.-Dunstan-in-the-West Church, Cambridge. He published Ayres to be sung to the lute, written in 1609, which is 'unique in that it is the only collection of lute songs that is a carefully prepared work by one man...and not simply an anthology of somebody's favourite songs'. ==References== Category:1580s births Category:1647 deaths Category:17th-century classical composers Category:17th-century English composers ",
