    "text": "The 1907 New South Wales state election involved 90 electoral districts returning one member each. The election was conducted on the basis of a simple majority or first-past-the-post voting system. In this election, 7 members did not stand for re-election, in 11 electorates the winning candidate received less than 50% of the votes, while 5 were uncontested. There were 23 seats that elected a member from a different party, while a further 5 seats where the member retained the seat but changed from the Progressive Party to the Liberal Reform Party, continuing the demise of the Progressive Party, from a high of 42 seats at the 1901 election. Four months before the election the party had negotiated a coalition agreement with the Liberal Reform Party however this was rejected by a vote of parliamentary members. The party leader Thomas Waddell (Belubula) resigned and joined the Liberal Reform Party, and was followed by John McFarlane (The Clarence), Brinsley Hall (The Hawkesbury), John Gillies (Maitland) and John Perry (b 1845) (The Richmond). Of the remaining 10 former Progressive Party members, a further 5 lost their seats.
