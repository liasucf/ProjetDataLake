The album was recorded in Toronto, Ontario, Canada at Sound Stage studio in April 1976 with Jack Douglas producing. The album produced two songs that hit the charts in Canada with \"Take It Or Leave It\" that reached number 14 and \"Cause There's Another\" that reached number 16 on the Top 30 on CHUM (AM) in Toronto Canada, and the KISS-FM Texas hits \"Midnight Flight\" and \"One More Heartbreak\". The album sold well because of strong live appearances that included tours with Black Sabbath, Boston, and Triumph with heavy promotion by the label (Polydor) (Mercury Records).
