    "text": "Alcippe is a genus of passerine birds in the monotypic family Alcippeidae. The genus once included many other fulvettas and was previously placed in families Pellorneidae or Timaliidae. ==Taxonomy== The genus Alcippe previously included many of the fulvettas, but recent taxonomy has seen the group progressively redefined. The Fulvetta fulvettas are now placed in family Paradoxornithidae, the bush blackcap in the genus Sylvia in the family Sylviidae, and, in the most revision, a group of seven species were transferred to the new genus Schoeniparus in family Pellorneidae. The genus currently contains the following ten species: * Brown fulvetta (Alcippe brunneicauda) * Brown-cheeked fulvetta (Alcippe poioicephala) * Javan fulvetta (Alcippe pyrrhoptera) * Mountain fulvetta (Alcippe peracensis) * Black-browed fulvetta (Alcippe grotei) * Grey-cheeked fulvetta (Alcippe morrisonia) * David's fulvetta (Alcippe davidi) * Yunnan fulvetta (Alcippe fratercula) * Huet's fulvetta (Alcippe hueti) * Nepal fulvetta (Alcippe nipalensis) ==References== *Collar, N.
