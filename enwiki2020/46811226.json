They had been patronized by Doge Renier Zen, who endowed them with a large inheritance. By the 1300s, it had become a hospital. The complex here had become by the 15th century a hospice for poor women. The oratory was decorated with eight canvases depicting scenes from the Order of the Crociferi (1583-1592) by Palma il Giovane. The ceiling has a painting on wood of the Assumption of the Virgin with Angelic Musicians.Scala Bovolo website, entry on oratory. A hospice at the site still remains adjacent to site.
