It has been an observer member of the Socialist International since 2008,XXIII Congress of the Socialist International, Athens: Decisions of the Congress Regarding Membership Socialist International and is also a member of the Progressive Alliance.Participants Progressive Alliance ==History== The party was established on 28 March 1978 in Paris by former Prime Minister Ange-F\u00e9lix Patass\u00e9 as a Central African opposition movement. It called for the replacement of President David Dacko by a national council authorised to establish a 'provisional government of national unity'. After multi-party politics was reintroduced in the early 1990s, the party won the 1993 general elections. Patass\u00e9 was elected President, defeating Abel Goumba in the second round of the presidential elections by a margin of 53\u201346%. In the parliamentary elections, the MLPC won 34 of the 85 seats in the National Assembly, becoming the largest party. In the 1998 parliamentary elections the party won 47 of the 109 seats. However, the Union of Forces for Peace (UFAP) alliance, which opposed Patass\u00e9, obtained a parliamentary majority, with its members winning a combined 55 seats. Nevertheless, the MLPC was able to form a government after the defection of a UFAP MP.Tom Lansford (2014) Political Handbook of the World 2014, CQ Press, p249 Patass\u00e9 won the 1999 presidential elections in the first round with 51% of the vote, but was removed from office by a coup in 2003. General elections were held again in 2005, with coup leader Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9 beating the MLPC candidate Martin Zigu\u00e9l\u00e9 in the second round of the presidential elections. Patass\u00e9, who was in exile at the time, had initially been the MLPC candidate, but was barred from contesting the election due to charges against him regarding alleged wrongdoing while in office.\"Le parti de l'ex-pr\u00e9sident centrafricain Patass\u00e9 soutient Martin Zigu\u00e9l\u00e9\" , AFP, 26 January 2005 .
