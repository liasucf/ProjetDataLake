    "text": "Guys and Dolls is a musical with music and lyrics by Frank Loesser and book by Jo Swerling and Abe Burrows. It is based on \"The Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown\" (1933) and \"Blood Pressure\", which are two short stories by Damon Runyon, and also borrows characters and plot elements from other Runyon stories \u2013 such as \"Pick the Winner\".Stempel, 435 Vivian Blaine as Miss Adelaide and Sam Levene as Nathan Detroit in the 1950 original Broadway production of Guys and Dolls The show premiered on Broadway in 1950, where it ran for 1,200 performances and won the Tony Award for Best Musical. The musical has had several Broadway and London revivals, as well as a 1955 film adaptation starring Marlon Brando, Jean Simmons, Frank Sinatra and Vivian Blaine. Guys and Dolls was selected as the winner of the 1950 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. However, because of writer Abe Burrows' communist sympathies as exposed by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), the Trustees of Columbia University vetoed the selection, and no Pulitzer for Drama was awarded that year.Suskin, 275 In 1998, Vivian Blaine, Sam Levene, Robert Alda and Isabel Bigley, along with the original Broadway cast of the 1950 Decca cast album, were posthumously inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. ==Background== Guys and Dolls was conceived by producers Cy Feuer and Ernest Martin as an adaptation of Damon Runyon's short stories.Zolotow, Maurice. \"Guys, Dolls and Runyon\". The New York Times, Nov. 12, 1950, Section 2, p. 1,3. These stories, written in the 1920s and 1930s, concerned gangsters, gamblers, and other characters of the New York underworld. Runyon was known for the unique dialect he employed in his stories, mixing highly formal language and slang.Stempel, 434 Frank Loesser, who had spent most of his career as a lyricist for movie musicals, was hired as composer and lyricist. George S. Kaufman was hired as director. When the first version of the show's book, or dialogue, written by Jo Swerling was deemed unusable, Feuer and Martin asked radio comedy writer Abe Burrows to rewrite it.Suskin, 272-276 Loesser had already written much of the score to correspond with the first version of the book. Burrows later recalled: > Frank Loesser's fourteen songs were all great, and the [new book] had to be > written so that the story would lead into each of them. Later on, the > critics spoke of the show as 'integrated'. The word integration usually > means that the composer has written songs that follow the story line > gracefully. Well, we accomplished that but we did it in reverse.Burrows, Abe > (1980). Honest Abe. Boston: Atlantic-Little, Brown, p. 149, cited in > Stempel, 434-435 Abe Burrows specifically crafted the role of Nathan Detroit around Sam Levene who signed for the project long before Burrows wrote a single word of dialogue, a similar break Burrows said he had when he later wrote Cactus Flower for Lauren Bacall. In \u201cHonest, Abe: Is There Really No Business Like Show Business?\u201d, Burrows recalls \"I had the sound of their voices in my head. I knew the rhythm of their speech and it helped make the dialogue sharper and more real\". Although Broadway and movie veteran Sam Levene was not a singer, it was agreed he was otherwise perfect as Nathan Detroit; indeed, Levene was one of Runyon's favorite actors. Frank Loesser agreed it was easier adjusting the music to Levene's limitations than substituting a better singer who couldn't act. Levene's lack of singing ability is the reason the lead role of Nathan Detroit only has one song, the duet \"Sue Me\". Composer and lyricist Frank Loesser specifically wrote \"Sue Me\" for Sam Levene, and structured the song so he and Vivian Blaine never sang their showstopping duet together. The son of a cantor, Sam Levene was fluent in Yiddish: \"Alright, already, I'm just a no-goodnick; alright, already, it\u2019s true, so nu? So sue me.\" Frank Loesser felt \"Nathan Detroit should be played as a brassy Broadway tough guy who sang with more grits than gravy. Sam Levene sang \u201cSue Me\u201d with such a wonderful Runyonesque flavor that his singing had been easy to forgive, in fact it had been quite charming in its ineptitude.\" \"Musically, Sam Levene may have been tone-deaf, but he inhabited Frank Loesser's world as a character more than a caricature\", says Fordham Professor of Music Larry Stempel, author of Showtime: A History of the Broadway Musical Theater. The character of Miss Adelaide was created specifically to fit Vivian Blaine into the musical, after Loesser decided she was ill-suited to play the conservative Sarah.Scott Simon (host). \"Creation of the musical Guys and Dolls, Weekend Edition Saturday, National Public Radio, November 2=pk2000 When Loesser suggested reprising some songs in the second act, Kaufman warned: \"If you reprise the songs, we'll reprise the jokes.\"\"On a lighter note, Sam Levene and Vivian Blane made guest- star appearances on a New Year's Eve production of The Big Show, December 31, 1950, with Tallulah Bankhead and Jose Ferrer; Sam Levene and Vivian Blaine performed with Bankhead, satirizing the difficulty of getting theatre tickets to their standing-room-only Broadway musical, Guys and Dolls.\" ==Synopsis== ===Act I=== A pantomime of never-ceasing activities depicts the hustle and bustle of New York City (\"Runyonland\"). Three small-time gamblers, Nicely- Nicely Johnson, Benny Southstreet, and Rusty Charlie, argue over which horse will win a big race (\"Fugue for Tinhorns\"). The band members of the Save-a- Soul Mission, led by the pious and beautiful Sergeant Sarah Brown, call for sinners to \"Follow the Fold\" and repent. Nicely and Benny's employer, Nathan Detroit, runs an illegal floating crap game. Due to local policeman Lt. Brannigan's strong-armed presence, he has found only one likely spot to hold the game: the \"Biltmore garage\". Its owner, Joey Biltmore, requires a $1,000 security deposit, and Nathan is broke (\"The Oldest Established\"). Nathan hopes to win a $1,000 bet against Sky Masterson, a gambler willing to bet on virtually anything. Nathan proposes a bet he believes he cannot lose: Sky must take a woman of Nathan's choice to dinner in Havana, Cuba. Sky agrees, and Nathan chooses Sarah Brown. At the mission, Sky attempts to make a deal with Sarah; offering her \"one dozen genuine sinners\" in exchange for the date in Havana. Sarah refuses, and they argue over who they will fall in love with (\"I'll Know\"). Sky kisses Sarah, and she slaps him. Nathan goes to watch his fianc\u00e9e of 14 years, Adelaide, perform her nightclub act (\"A Bushel and a Peck\"). After her show, she asks him to marry her once again, telling him that she has been sending her mother letters for twelve years claiming that they have been married with five children. She finds out that Nathan is still running the crap game. After kicking him out, she reads a medical book telling her that her long-running cold may be due to Nathan's refusal to marry her (\"Adelaide's Lament\"). The next day, Nicely and Benny watch as Sky pursues Sarah, and Nathan tries to win back Adelaide's favor. They declare that guys will do anything for the dolls they love (\"Guys and Dolls\"). General Cartwright, the leader of Save-a-Soul, visits the mission and explains that she will be forced to close the branch unless they succeed in bringing some sinners to the upcoming revival meeting. Sarah, desperate to save the mission, promises the General \"one dozen genuine sinners\", implicitly accepting Sky's deal. Brannigan discovers a group of gamblers waiting for Nathan's crap game, and to convince him of their innocence, they tell Brannigan their gathering is Nathan's \"surprise bachelor party\". This satisfies Brannigan, and Nathan resigns himself to eloping with Adelaide. Adelaide goes home to pack, promising to meet him after her show the next afternoon. The Save-A-Soul Mission band passes by, and Nathan sees that Sarah is not in it; he realizes that he lost the bet and faints. In a Havana nightclub, Sky buys a drink for himself and a \"Cuban milkshake\" for Sarah. She doesn't realize that the drink contains Bacardi rum, and she gets drunk and kisses Sky (\"If I Were a Bell\"). Sky realizes that he genuinely cares for Sarah, and he takes her back to New York. They return at around 4:00 a.m., and Sky tells Sarah how much he loves the early morning (\"My Time of Day\"). They both spontaneously admit that they're in love (\"I've Never Been in Love Before\"). A siren sounds and gamblers run out of the mission, where Nathan has been holding the crap game. Sarah assumes that Sky took her to Havana so Nathan could run the game in the mission, and she walks out on him. ===Act II=== The next evening, Adelaide performs her act (\"Take Back Your Mink\"). Nathan doesn't show up for the elopement because he's still running the crap game. She soon realizes that Nathan has stood her up again (\"Adelaide's Second Lament\"). Sarah admits to Arvide, her uncle and fellow mission worker, that she does love Sky, but she will not see him again. Arvide expresses his faith in Sky's inherent goodness and urges Sarah to follow her heart (\"More I Cannot Wish You\"). Sky tells Sarah he intends to deliver the dozen genuine sinners for the revival. She doesn't believe him and walks off, but Arvide subtly encourages him. Nicely shows Sky to the crap game; now in the sewers (\"Crapshooters Dance\"). Big Jule, a gambler, has lost a large sum of money and refuses to end the game until he earns it back. Sky arrives and fails to convince the crapshooters to come to the mission. He gives Nathan $1,000 and claims that he lost the bet to protect Sarah. Sky makes a last-minute bet to get the sinners; if he loses, everyone gets $1,000, but if he wins, they go to the mission (\"Luck Be a Lady\"). He wins the bet. Nathan runs into Adelaide on his way there. She tries to get him to elope, but when he can't, she walks out on him. Nathan professes his love for her (\"Sue Me\"), then leaves. Sarah is shocked to see that Sky carried through on his promise. The General asks the gamblers to confess their sins, and while some do, one of them admits the real reason they are even there. The General is thrilled that good can come from evil. Attempting to appear contrite, Nicely invents a dream that encouraged him to repent, and the gamblers join in with revivalist fervor (\"Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat\"). Brannigan arrives and threatens to arrest everyone for the crap game in the Mission, but Sarah clears them, saying that none of the gamblers were at the mission the previous night. After Brannigan leaves, Nathan confesses that they held the crap game in the mission. He also confesses to the bet he made with Sky about taking Sarah to Havana. He adds that he won the bet, to Sarah's shock, and she realizes that Sky wanted to protect her reputation and must genuinely care about her. Sarah and Adelaide run into each other, and they commiserate and then resolve to marry their men anyway and reform them later (\"Marry the Man Today\"). A few weeks later, Nathan owns a newsstand and has officially closed the crap game. Sky, who is now married to Sarah, works at the mission band and has also stopped gambling. The characters celebrate as Nathan and Adelaide are married (\"Guys and Dolls (Finale/Reprise)\"). ==Musical numbers== ;Act I * \"Runyonland\" \u2013 Orchestra * \"Fugue for Tinhorns\" \u2013 Nicely, Benny, Rusty * \"Follow the Fold\" \u2013 Sarah, Mission Band * \"The Oldest Established\" \u2013 Nathan, Nicely, Benny, Guys * \"I'll Know\" \u2013 Sarah, Sky * \"A Bushel and a Peck\" \u2013 Adelaide, Hot Box Girls * \"Adelaide's Lament\" \u2013 Adelaide * \"Guys and Dolls\" \u2013 Nicely, Benny * \"Havana\" \u2013 Orchestra * \"If I Were a Bell\" \u2013 Sarah * \"My Time of Day/I've Never Been in Love Before\" \u2013 Sky, Sarah ;Act II * \"Take Back Your Mink\" \u2013 Adelaide, Hot Box Girls * \"Adelaide's Second Lament\" \u2013 Adelaide * \"More I Cannot Wish You\" \u2013 Arvide * \"Crapshooters Ballet\" \u2013 Orchestra * \"Luck Be a Lady\" \u2013 Sky, Guys * \"Sue Me\" \u2013 Adelaide, Nathan * \"Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat\" \u2013 Nicely, Company * \"Marry the Man Today\" \u2013 Adelaide, Sarah * \"Guys and Dolls (Reprise)\" \u2013 Company Guys and Dolls window card starring Vivian Blaine, Robert Alda and Sam Levene from original 1950 Broadway production at the 46th Street Theatre ==Productions== ===Original 1950 Broadway production=== New York Mirror \"Theatre-Ticket Ordergram\" featuring original Broadway stars Vivian Blaine, Sam Levene and Isabel Bigley in 1950 Broadway production Guys and Dolls at 46th Street Theatre.

Director Michael Buffong said, \"Pre-war Harlem was all about the hustle. The creativity of that era was born from a unique collision of talent and circumstance as people escaped the agricultural and oppressive south via the 'underground railroad' into the highly urbanised and industrialised north. Much of our popular culture, from dance to music, has its roots in that period. Our Guys and Dolls brings all of this to the fore.\" Reviews particularly praised the music, relocation to Harlem, and sense of spectacle. Lyn Gardner in The Guardian wrote that \"the gamblers ... are a bunch of sharp-suited peacocks clad in rainbow hues.\" Ann Treneman in The Times commented, \"Whoever had the idea of moving this classic musical from one part of New York to another bit, just up the road, needs to be congratulated. This version of Frank Loesser's musical, which swirls around the lives of the petty gangsters and their 'dolls' who inhabit New York's underbelly, moves the action to Harlem at its prewar height in 1939. It is a Talawa production with an all-black cast and it is terrific from the get-go.\" Clare Brennan in The Observer stated, \"Relocated to Harlem, this fine new production of Frank Loesser's classic musical retains a threat of violence under a cartoon-bright exterior.\" ===Other=== In 1995, a Las Vegas production, performed without intermission, starred Jack Jones, Maureen McGovern and Frank Gorshin.

It was directed by Jack O'Brien and featured the Orchestra of St. Luke's playing the original orchestrations. ==Reception== The original Broadway production of Guys and Dolls opened to unanimously positive reviews, which was a relief to the cast, who had had a 41-performance pre-Broadway tryout in Philadelphia in which each of the 41 performances was different. Critics praised the musical's faithfulness to Damon Runyon's style and characterizations. Richard Watts of the New York Post said \"Guys and Dolls is just what it should be to celebrate the Runyon spirit ... [it is] filled with the salty characters and richly original language sacred to the memory of the late Master\".Suskin, Steven. Opening Night on Broadway: A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre, pp. 272-276. Schirmer Books, New York, 1990. William Hawkins of the New York World-Telegram & Sun stated, \"It recaptures what [Runyon] knew about Broadway, that its wickedness is tinhorn, but its gallantry is as pure and young as Little Eva\". Robert Coleman of the New York Daily Mirror declared, \"We think Damon would have relished it as much as we did\". The book and score were greatly praised as well; John Chapman, then Chief Theatre Critic, of the New York Daily News declared, \"The book is a work of easy and delightful humor. Its music and lyrics, by Frank Loesser, are so right for the show and so completely lacking in banality, that they amount to an artistic triumph\". Coleman stated, \"Frank Loesser has written a score that will get a big play on the juke boxes, over the radio, and in bistros throughout the land. His lyrics are especially notable in that they help Burrows's topical gags to further the plot\". In The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson wrote, \"Mr. Loesser's lyrics and songs have the same affectionate appreciation of the material as the book, which is funny without being self- conscious or mechanical\".Atkinson, Brooks. \"At the Theatre\". The New York Times, November 25, 1950. p. 21 Multiple critics asserted that the work was of great significance to musical theatre. John McClain of the New York Journal American proclaimed, \"it is the best and most exciting thing of its kind since Pal Joey. It is a triumph and a delight.\" Atkinson stated, \"we might as well admit that Guys and Dolls is a work of art. It is spontaneous and has form, style, and spirit.\" Chapman asserted, \"In all departments, Guys and Dolls is a perfect musical comedy\". Laurence Olivier said Sam Levene's performance as Nathan Detroit was the greatest stage performance he had ever seen. ==Film adaptations== On November 3, 1955 the film version of the musical was released, starring Marlon Brando as Sky, Frank Sinatra as Nathan Detroit, and Jean Simmons as Sarah, with Vivian Blaine reprising her role as Adelaide. The film was directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and produced by Samuel Goldwyn. Levene lost the film role of Nathan Detroit to Frank Sinatra: \"You can\u2019t have a Jew playing a Jew, it wouldn't work on screen\", producer Samuel Goldwyn argued when explaining he wanted Sinatra rather than Levene who had originated the role, even though Guys and Dolls film director Joseph L. Mankiewicz wanted Levene, the original Broadway star. Frank Loesser felt Sinatra played the part like a \"dapper Italian swinger\". Mankiewicz said \"if there could be one person in the world more miscast as Nathan Detroit than Frank Sinatra that would be Laurence Olivier and I am one of his greatest fans; the role had been written for Sam Levene who was divine in it\". Sinatra did his best to give Nathan Detroit a few stereotyped Jewish gestures and inflections, but Frank Loesser hated \"how Sinatra turned the rumpled Nathan Detroit into a smoothie. Sam Levene's husky untrained voice added to the song's charm, not to mention its believability\". Frank Loesser died in 1969, still refusing to watch the film version released in 1955. Around the time of the film's release, American composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim wrote film reviews for Films In Review. Sondheim (then aged 25) reviewed the film version of Guys and Dolls, and observed: \"Sinatra ambles through his role as Nathan Detroit as though he were about to laugh at the jokes in the script. He has none of the sob in the voice, and the incipient ulcer in the stomach, that the part requires and Sam Levene supplied so hilariously on the stage. Sinatra sings on pitch, but colorlessly; Levene sang off pitch, but acted while he sang. Sinatra's lackadaisical performance, his careless and left handed attempt at characterization not only harm the picture immeasurably but indicate an alarming lack of professionally.\" Three new songs, written by Frank Loesser, were added to the film: \"Pet Me Poppa\"; \"A Woman in Love\"; and \"Adelaide\", which was written specifically for Sinatra. Five songs from the stage musical were omitted from the movie: \"A Bushel and a Peck\", \"My Time of Day\", \"I've Never Been In Love Before\", \"More I Cannot Wish You\", and \"Marry the Man Today\". 20th Century Fox acquired the film rights to the musical in early 2013 and was planning a remake.Fleming Jr., Mike \"Fox Seals \u2018Guys And Dolls\u2019 Rights; Wants Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt To Fill Frank Sinatra And Marlon Brando Shoes.\" Deadline Hollywood (April 24, 2013). In March 2019, TriStar Pictures acquired the remake rights. ==Casts of major productions== The following table shows the principal casts of the major productions of Guys and Dolls: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+Casts of major productions ! style=\"width:10%;\" | ! style=\"width:10%;\" | Original Broadway Production ! style=\"width:10%;\" | Original London Production ! style=\"width:10%;\" | 1955 Film ! style=\"width:10%;\" | 1976 Broadway Revival ! style=\"width:10%;\" | 1982 London Revival ! style=\"width:10%;\" | 1992 Broadway Revival ! style=\"width:10%;\" | 2005 London Revival ! style=\"width:10%;\" | 2008 Melbourne Production ! style=\"width:10%;\" | 2009 Broadway Revival |- !
