He made his first appearance in an 8-26 to 0-12 All- Ireland quarter-final defeat of Antrim at Parnell Park. On 4 September 2011, Tuohey was at right wing-back in Galway's 1-21 to 1-12 defeat of Dublin in the All-Ireland final at Croke Park.

Later that season he won his first Leinster Championship medal after Galway's 0-29 to 1-17 defeat of Wexford in the final. Following Galway's All-Ireland semi- final defeat of Tipperary, there was speculation that Tuohey would receive some sanction from the CCCC after footage of him pulling the helmet from Tipperary player Patrick Maher\u2019s head was shown on the Sunday Game. The incident wasn\u2019t dealt with by referee Barry Kelly or his officials, however, the CCCC took no subsequent action. On 3 September 2017, Tuohey started for Galway at right corner-back when they won their first All-Ireland in 29 years after a 0-26 to 2-17 defeat of Waterford in the final. On 8 July 2018, Tuohey won a second successive Leinster Championship medal following Galway's 1-28 to 3-15 defeat of Kilkenny in the final. On 19 August 2018, he lined out at left corner-back in Galway's 3-16 to 2-18 All-Ireland final defeat by Limerick. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|Year !colspan=\"3\"|National League !colspan=\"2\"|Leinster !colspan=\"2\"|All-Ireland !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score!!Apps!!Score |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Galway |2016 |rowspan=\"1\"|Division 1A |4||0-00||1||0-00||2||0-00||7||0-00 |- |2017 |rowspan=\"3\"|Division 1B |7||0-01||3||0-00||2||0-00||12||0-01 |- |2018 |6||0-00||5||0-00||3||0-00||14||0-00 |- |2019 |0||0-00||2||0-02||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0-02 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total |17||0-01||11||0-02||7||0-00||35||0-03 |} ==Honours== ;Galway * All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (1): 2017 *Leinster Senior Hurling Championship (2): 2017, 2018 *National Hurling League (1): 2017 *All-Ireland Intermediate Hurling Championship (1): 2015 *Leinster Intermediate Hurling Championship (1): 2015 *All-Ireland Minor Hurling Championship (1): 2011 ==References== Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Beagh hurlers Category:Galway inter-county hurlers ",
