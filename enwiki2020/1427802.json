    "text": "The genus Hydrochoerus contains two living and two extinct species of capybaras from South America, the Caribbean island of Grenada, and Panama. Capybaras are the largest living rodents in the world. The genus name is derived from the Greek \u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1 (h\u00fddor, water) plus \u03c7\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (cho\u00edros, pig). == Characteristics == Capybaras are semiaquatic, found in and near lakes, rivers, swamps, and flooded savanna. Their diets are dominated by grasses. Adults weigh up to . The gestation period is 130\u2013150 days, with two to eight (most commonly four) young born to females. == Behavior == Capybaras are highly social, living in groups of up to 100 and communicating through a variety of vocalizations.Rowe and Honeycutt, 2002 Breeding is polygynous, with males forming harems. == Phylogeny and taxonomy == Molecular results have consistently suggested Hydrochoerus is most closely related to Kerodon (the rock cavies), and the two evolved from within the Caviidae. This led Woods and Kilpatrick to unite the two into the subfamily Hydrochoerinae within the Caviidae. Based on use of a molecular clock approach, Hydrochoerus appears to have diverged from Kerodon in the late Middle Miocene (about 12 million years ago). The extinct North American species formerly recognized as Hydrochoerus holmesi is now assigned to Neochoerus. == Species == * Genus Hydrochoerus ** \u2020 Hydrochoerus ballesterensis \u2013 Pliocene capybara endemic to ArgentinaHydrochoerus ballesterensis at Fossilworks.org ** \u2020 Hydrochoerus gaylordi \u2013 Plio-Pleistocene capybara endemic to the Caribbean island of GrenadaHydrochoerus gaylordi at Fossilworks.org ** Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris \u2013 capybara ** Hydrochoerus isthmius \u2013 lesser capybara == Distribution == Presently, capybaras live in northern South America and adjacent southern Central America (lesser capybara) and in the tropical to subtropical regions of South America (capybara). The fossil species inhabited Buenos Aires Province in Argentina (H. ballesterensis) and the Caribbean island of Grenada (H. gaylordi). Fossils of unspecified Hydrochoerus have been found in Late Pleistocene to Holocene sediments of Curit\u00ed, Santander, at an altitude of in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes. Fauna found at the same site included the South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), Cryptotis sp., collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), and Mazama sp.Curit\u00ed, Santander at Fossilworks.orgHoffstetter, 1971, p.54 == References == === Bibliography === * * == Further reading == * Category:Cavies Category:Rodent genera Category:Mammals of Central America Category:Mammals of South America Category:Pleistocene mammals of South America Category:Pliocene mammals of South America Category:Neogene Argentina Category:Fossils of Argentina Category:Neogene Colombia Category:Fossils of Colombia Category:Mammals described in 1762 Category:Taxa named by Mathurin Jacques Brisson Category:Semiaquatic mammals ",
