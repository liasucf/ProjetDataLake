    "text": "Harding in 2012 Alice Kust Harding is an American astrophysicist in the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland. She gained a B.A. from Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania, in 1973, and a Ph.D. from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, in 1979. In 1980 she was appointed an astrophysicist in the Astrophysics Science Division at Goddard Space Flight Center, a post she has held since then. Her main research interests have been high-energy particle acceleration and radiation processes in pulsars, highly magnetized neutron stars (magnetars), gamma-ray bursts, and supernova remnants. She was awarded the status of Fellow in the American Physical Society, after being nominated by their Division of Astrophysics in 1991, for pioneering investigation of the theory of pulsar atmospheres, including the pulsar wind and its role in accelerating particles to high energies, and for contributions to the theory of basic electromagnetic interactions in the presence of super- strong magnetic fields. She was elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society in 2020. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century physicists Category:20th-century American women scientists Category:American women physicists Category:Fellows of the American Astronomical Society Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society ",
