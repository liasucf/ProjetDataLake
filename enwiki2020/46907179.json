    "text": "Hamont-Achel dialect (, ) or Hamont-Achel Limburgish is the city dialect and variant of Limburgish spoken in the Belgian city of Hamont-Achel alongside the Dutch language (with which it is not mutually intelligible). Native speakers of the dialect tend to call it either Ha\u00ebmets or Achels, depending on where they are from (the former city of Hamont or the former village of Achel). ==Phonology== The following section describes the dialect as it is spoken in Hamont. ===Consonants=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Consonant phonemes |- ! colspan=\"2\" | !

Word-finally it is devoiced to either a fricative or a fricative trill . *Other allophones include . They appear in contexts similar to Belgian Standard Dutch. *Voiceless consonants are regressively assimilated. An example of this is the past tense of regular verbs, where voiceless stops and fricatives are voiced before the past tense morpheme . *Word-final voiceless consonants are voiced in intervocalic position. ===Vowels=== The Hamont-Achel dialect contains 22 monophthong and 13 diphthong phonemes. The amount of monophthongs is higher than that of consonants. ====Monophthongs==== Short monophthongs of the Hamont-Achel dialect on a vowel chart, based on the formant chart in Long monophthongs of the Hamont-Achel dialect on a vowel chart, based on the formant chart in {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Monophthong phonemes ! rowspan=\"2\" | ! colspan=\"2\" | Front ! colspan=\"2\" | Central ! colspan=\"2\" | Back |- ! ! ! ! ! ! |- !

This is very similar to Belgian Standard Dutch, in which the difference is 105 ms. The quality of the monophthongs is as follows: * are similar to the corresponding cardinal vowels , but none of them are quite as peripheral. * Among the central vowels, , , , and are phonetically central (), whereas and are front , similar to the corresponding cardinal vowels. is near- close (and slightly advanced from the central position) rather than close and is close-mid. is phonetically similar to the unstressable and the two differ mainly in rounding. * is similar to , but it is lower and slightly more central (). * The contrast between the long open vowels is a genuine front\u2013central\u2013back contrast. The Hamont-Achel dialect thus has four, not five phonemic vowel heights, and is open front . * The short and are somewhat higher and more front () than their long counterparts. ====Monophthong-glide combinations==== Unlike in the neighboring dialect of Weert, all monophthong- glide combinations are restricted to the syllable coda. Those are mostly preceded by a vowel, and they are and the marginal . There also are two combinations of a vowel followed by , which are and . ====Diphthongs==== Dialect of Hamont-Achel contrasts long and short closing diphthongs. The long ones are on average 70 ms longer than their short equivalents. Centering diphthongs are all long.

In this article, they are transcribed as a distinction between falling and rising tone. The difference between Accent 1 and Accent 2 can signal either lexical differences or grammatical distinctions, such as those between the singular and the plural forms of some nouns. It is phonemic only in stressed syllables, an example of a minimal pair is ('(record) sleeve') vs. ('house'). In final position, Accent 1 is realised as a steady fall through the rhyme, the Accent 2 is falling-rising ; the first half of the rhyme is falling, whereas the rest is rising. In non-final position, Accent 1's F0 stays high in the first 45% of the rhyme and then falls rapidly towards the end of the rhyme (in IPA, that can be transcribed ). When the focus of the sentence is on a word with Accent 2, it is realized as a very shallow fall-rise combination . Vowels with Accent 1 are generally shorter than those with Accent 2. ===Sample=== The sample text is a reading of the first sentence of The North Wind and the Sun, read by a 75-year-old male middle-class speaker. ====Phonetic transcription==== . Note that the author transcribes de as *, rather than the correct . ====Orthographic version==== De noorderwind en de zon, die warre ruzie aan 't make over wie 't sterkste was toen er ene v\u00e8\u00e8nt verbij kw\u00e0\u00e0m met ne werme jas aon. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * Category:Languages of Belgium Category:Limburg (Belgium) Category:Limburgish language Category:Low Franconian languages Category:Hamont-Achel ",
