    "text": "Primarily in Austroasiatic languages (also known as Mon\u2013Khmer), in a typical word a minor syllable is a reduced (minor) syllable followed by a full tonic or stressed syllable. The minor syllable may be of the form or , with a reduced vowel, as in colloquial Khmer, or of the form with no vowel at all, as in Mlabri \"navel\" (minor syllable ) and \"underneath\" (minor syllable ), and Khasi kyndon \"rule\" (minor syllable ), syrwet \"sign\" (minor syllable ), kylla \"transform\" (minor syllable ), symboh \"seed\" (minor syllable ) and tyngkai \"conserve\" (minor syllable ). This iambic pattern is sometimes called sesquisyllabic (lit. 'one and a half syllables'), a term coined by the American linguist James Matisoff in 1973 (Matisoff 1973:86). Sometimes minor syllables are introduced by language contact. Many Chamic languages as well as Burmese have developed minor syllables from contact with Mon-Khmer family. In Burmese, minor syllables have the form , with no consonant clusters allowed in the syllable onset, no syllable coda, and no tone. Recent reconstructions of Proto-Tai and Old Chinese also include sesquisyllabic roots with minor syllables, as transitional forms between fully disyllabic words and the monosyllabic words found in modern Tai languages and modern Chinese. ==See also== *Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area *Stress in Khmer ==Notes== ==References== *Brunelle, Marc; Kirby, James; Michaud, Alexis; Watkins, Justin.
