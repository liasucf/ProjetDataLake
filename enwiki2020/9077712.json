He is a professor in resource economics at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva. == Background == After attending law school at the University of Michigan, Swanson completed his PhD at the London School of Economics under the supervision of Nick Stern. Swanson currently holds the Andr\u00e9 Hoffmann Chair of Environmental Economics at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, where he is also director of the Centre for International Environmental Studies. In parallel, Swanson is also affiliated professor at the University of Cambridge. Previously he held the Chair in Law & Economics at University College London and was research Director for the United Kingdom's National Centre on Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment. He was also a visiting professor at the University of Washington from 2004 to 2005. == Work == His research covers the issues dealing with legal reform and institution building in the areas of environment, intellectual property and technology. He has advised the governments of China, India, and many international and development agencies. Swanson has argued that important issues in wildlife management are not a result of the tragedy of the commons as often thought, but that it lies in the failure of governments \"to control access to wildlife and the land it occupies..., [in the] 'opportunity costs, alternative development priorities, governance problems and resources'.\" ==Bibliography== *Economic Growth and Environmental Regulation: the case of China, (with Tun Lin), Routledge: London, 2009. *Biodiversity Economics, (editor with Kontoleon and Pascual) Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, 2007. *Managing Water Resources in Developing Countries, (editor with Koundouri, Pashardes and Xepapadeas), 2003, Edward Elgar: Cheltenham. *The Economics of Managing Biotechnologies.
