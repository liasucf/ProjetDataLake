The purpose of NHSA is to unite Haitian youth nationwide and to provide educational/leadership opportunities for students through scholarships, project involvement, trainings, and workshops. == History of National Haitian Student Conference == Since 1998, the National Haitian Student Conference (NHSC) has grown from an event solely of 100 participants from New York City area colleges, to one that is attended by over 1,000 students from universities nationwide. Throughout its evolution, NHSC has always been fertile ground on which Haitians, African-Americans, Hispanics, Africans, West Indians and various ethnic groups come together to discuss issues that relate to the diversity of Haitian culture and heritage. The Attendees are immersed in pertinent information, inspired by world-renowned speakers and are encouraged to volunteer and become active in their local communities. Past participants of the conference have included: Wyclef Jean, Grammy Award winning producer, singer and songwriter; Edwidge Danticat, acclaimed Haitian writer whose literature has been featured in Oprah's Book Club; Marie St. Fleur, the first Haitian State Representative in Massachusetts; Judge Sybil Elias, the first Haitian judge in New Jersey; Ron Daniels, motivational speaker and Senator Kwami Raoul, the first Haitian-American Senator of Illinois. == Conferences and themes == *2010 Atlanta, Georgia: \"Rising in solidarity to fulfill the dreams of our ancestors.\" *2009 Chicago, Illinois: \"Discovering DuSable: Past, Present, and Beyond Chicago.\" (In attendance) *2008 University of Florida: \u201cKoze Kache: The Diary of Haiti\u201d *2007 Pennsylvania State University: \"La Renaissance D'Haiti: Kote-n Sorti, Kote Nou Ye, Kote-n Pwale\" *2006 New York University: \u201cKraze Barikad: Pale Sa Yo Pa Vle\u201d *2005 Florida Atlantic University: \u201cRise of the Phoenix\u201d *2004 Rutgers University: \u201cA Time for Change: Two Hundred Years of Sacrifice\u201d *2003 University of Massachusetts: \u201cBlood, Sweat, and Tears\u201d *2002 Georgetown University: \u201cHaiti Now\u201d *2001 University of Pennsylvania: \u201cThe Arts of Haiti\u201d *2000 New York University: \u201cL\u2019Essence D\u2019Haiti, The Essence of Haiti\u201d *1999 Columbia University: \u201cL\u2019Union Fait La Force, The Unity Creates Force\u201d *1998 Columbia University: \u201cAyiti Cherie Mwen: Holding on to Haiti\u201d == Active programs == ===Ti Frem Ti Sem=== Ti Frem Ti Sem is a peer-mentoring program that fosters cultural education, builds unity among community members, provides role models as well as creates recreational activities for high school and college students.
