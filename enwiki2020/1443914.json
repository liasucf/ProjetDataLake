    "text": "\"The Stones I Throw (Will Free All Men)\" was the A-side to the 1965 single by Levon and the Hawks, released on Atco Records. Seemingly a comment by Robbie Robertson in favor of the Civil Rights Movement, it is carried by Garth Hudson's organ, and is far less rooted in the heavy R&B; stylings of the group's other three single sides. It is the link between their days with Ronnie Hawkins and the group's breakout 1968 LP, Music From Big Pink. In December, 1965 the song reached #22 on the CHUM Chart. ==Cover versions== The song was covered by J.J. Jackson and included on his first album, released in 1967, and by the group Ocean, who included it on their first album, \"Put Your Hand In the Hand\", in 1970. ==Personnel== The Band *Rick Danko - bass, vocals *Levon Helm - drums, vocals *Garth Hudson - organ *Richard Manuel - piano, vocals *Jaime Robbie Robertson - guitar, harmonica Technical *Henry Glover - producer *Phil Ramone - engineer ==References== Category:The Band songs Category:1965 singles Category:Songs written by Robbie Robertson Category:1965 songs Category:Atco Records singles ",
