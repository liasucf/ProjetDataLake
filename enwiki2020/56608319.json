The film tells a story of the social adventures of three elderly men, who seek to have fun after getting their pension from the government. == Synopsis == Irikele (Richard Mofe Damijo) is an extroverted pensioner, who is very experienced in dealing with women and the younger generations. He tries to influence his friends to indulge in his sexual and emotional experiences. He has been divorced severally, and was threatened with death by two of his irresponsible sons, who felt he was being selfish with his wealth. Timi (Zack Orji) is a friend of Irikele, who is married to an extremely religious women, he shares similarly ideologies over the fantasies of Irikele but often needs someone to push and encourage him before making real moves, however as the film progresses he became more comfortable with that lifestyle. Tobere (Victor Olaotan) is the most principled among the three friends. He loves his wife and wouldn't do anything to hurt her. However, with peer pressure from his two friends who don't seem to share his moral beliefs, it became increasingly difficult for him to uphold them. == Cast == *Richard Mofe Damijo as Irikele *Zack Orji as Timi *Victor Olaotan as Tobere *Tina Mba as Regina *Ebele Okaro as Yetunde *Rotimi Salami as Oke == Reception == Wilfred Okiche for 360nobs praised the acting of the main cast, with particular acclaim for Richard Mofe Damijo, describing the film as genuinely funny, but downplayed the roles the leading women were made to play in the film as cliche. It noted that \"Tobere\" has gotten so engrossed to his role in Tinsel (TV series), that it was difficult for him to play a character opposite of what \"Ade Williams\" represented in the series. It concluded its review by stating that the last 10 minutes of the film were completely unnecessary and a total detach from the remaining parts off the film. Joy Dibia for Xplorenollywood also criticized the unneeded evangelical nature of the latter parts of the film, although she rated it an 8 out of 10 for its genuinely comedic theme and powerful acting. True Nollywood Stories titled its review \"Opa Williams returns to filmmaking with an eyesore\". == References == Category:Nigerian comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in Nigeria Category:Films about old age Category:2016 comedy-drama films ",
