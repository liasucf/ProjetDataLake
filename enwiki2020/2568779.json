It is located in the French-speaking part of the canton in the Jura mountains. ==History== Cort\u00e9bert jumphour wristwatch from the 1920s Cort\u00e9bert is first mentioned in 1178 as Cortaibert. In 1179 the cathedral chapters of Saint-Imier and Moutier-Grandval are listed as major land owners in Cort\u00e9bert. The Seignory of Erguel held the village as a fief for the Diocese of Basel. In 1530 Biel introduced the Protestant Reformation into the parish of Corg\u00e9mont which included the village of Cort\u00e9bert. During the Early Modern era the village had a successful agricultural and small scale handicraft economy. A number of houses and workshops were built during the 16th through 19th century, many of which still exist in the center of the village. In 1865, the watch manufacturer Raiguel Juillard et Cie opened a factory in the village. It was later renamed Cort\u00e9bert Watch & Co. The watch factory changed the entire socio-economic structure of the village. A village school opened in 1872, though it and the municipal archives were both destroyed in a fire in 1959. A train station opened in 1874, followed by a Reformed chapel in 1902. In 1938 a pumping station was built in the municipality which provided water to the villages in the Franches-Montagnes plateau. However, in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, demand for watches plummeted which devastated the municipal economy. Cort\u00e9bert Watch struggled to remain in operation until 1962 when it finally closed. In the 1990s, a new industrial and shopping zone was created in the west of the village. ==Geography== Mileage stone in Cort\u00e9bert, \"Eleven hours from Bern\" Aerial view by Walter Mittelholzer (1925) Cort\u00e9bert has an area of .
