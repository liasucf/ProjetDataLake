    "text": "I Have a Date with Spring () is a 1994 Hong Kong film directed by Clifton Ko and written by Raymond To. It is originally a 1992 play with the same name. ==Synopsis== The movie takes place in modern times when Butterfly returns from retirement in Canada to perform in a final charity show at the Flower Palace Nightclub before it is demolished. The film takes place in a continuing flashback of one fateful night in 1967 at the Flower Palace Nightclub. The film follows the lives of a 1960s girl group called \"The 4 Nuts\". On the night of the Hong Kong 1967 Leftist Riots, Butterfly Yiu was given an accidental chance to perform the final show when the original and star performer, Pak Long, was stranded at another venue. This started a chain of events that will change the four character's lives forever. ===Ending Of Four Main Characters=== Out of the four main characters, only Butterfly became very famous, and had a long career as a singer and actress. She had financial security, but lost out on romance, as her love interest, Karl Sum, cannot bear the pressure and relative shame of living with someone who is much more popular. Karl left for New York City to start a new career, only to be reunited with Butterfly at the end of the movie. This ending differs from the adapted ATV series, as although Butterfly and Karl meet again, she cannot forgive him for leaving her. Lulu Kim also became popular as a singer and actress, but not on the same level as Butterfly. Lulu eventually was married to Luk Tat Sun, the son of one of the directors of the Flower Palace Nightclub. He originally sought to marry Butterfly, but she waited out for Karl, and refused his advances. Fung Ping continues her unlucky streak in romance. She followed Donny, her gambling-addict boyfriend, to Vietnam with a show tour team. She arrived in Vietnam at the height of the Vietnam War, and was presumably killed during a bombing raid by US Forces. She gave birth to a son while in Vietnam, despite earlier promises of an abortion, and Karl Sum adopted the son and took him to the US. He was united with Butterfly at the end of the movie. Nancy eventually sought another job at another nightclub as a lounge singer. She remained obscure, and became depressed and an alcoholic. She eventually lost her voice due to alcohol and died of cirrhosis. Butterfly only knew of this right before her charity show. ==Characters== *Butterfly Yiu (\u59da\u5c0f\u8776)- One of the \"Four Crazy Kings\" (\u56db\u5927\u985b\u7687) at the Flower Palace Nightclub (\u9e97\u82b1\u7687\u5bae\u591c\u7e3d\u6703). She was initially among the lesser known singers of the nightclub, but through a series of events, she started her road to stardom. *Lulu Kim (\u91d1\u9732\u9732)- The second one of the \"Four Crazy Kings\" at the nightclub. She is the most unassuming of the four \"kings\", and eventually had a movie career and married the son of one of the Flower Palace Nightclub's directors. *Nancy Hong (\u7d05\u84ee\u831c)- The most flamboyant of the Four Crazy Kings. Nancy is known for her fiery tempers, which gets her into very heated (almost physical) arguments with her rivals. *Fung Ping Lam (\u85cd\u9cf3\u840d)- The tragic one in the \"Four Crazy Kings\". She is unlucky in love, and falls in love with a gamble-addict brass band member. *Pak Long (\u767d\u6d6a)- The most famous singer at the nightclub at the time. He is known for a rather diva-ish demeanors. It is hinted that Pak Long is homosexual, but that is not revealed in the movie. Pak Long eventually declined in popularity. *Yuen Pik (\u5a49\u78a7)- She is the diva of the nightclub, and was the most popular female singer at the time. She is also known for her fake bottom and breast implants, which was a part of a running gag. She was eventually outshone by Butterfly. *Karl Sum (\u6c88\u5bb6\u8c6a)- The main band member in the Flower Palace brass band. He is the love interest of Butterfly. Their relationship is rocky, and Karl eventually cannot bear the pains of living under the much more popular Butterfly. ==Cast== This is a partial list of cast for the 1994 film. * Fung Bo-Bo as Concert Mistress of Ceremonies * Alice Lau Ar-Lai as Butterfly Yiu * Erica Choi as Lulu Kim * Joey Meng as Fung Ping Lam * Anita Lee as Bar Girl * Teresa Mo as Woman at Concert Hall * Kiki Sheung as Nancy * Tse Kwan-Ho * Raymond Wong as Maitre d' * James Wong as Triad * David Wu as Karl Sum * Yip Wing-Cho as Po Below is a partial list of cast for the 1995 ATV tv series. * Sheren Tang as Butterfly Yiu * Kwong Wa as Pianist ==Awards== 14th Annual Hong Kong Film Awards * Law Koon-Lan - Winner of Best Supporting Actress * Alice Lau Ar-Lai - Nominated and Winner of Best New Artist * Raymond To Kwok-Wai - Winner of Best Screenplay * Fung Wai-Hung - Nominated for Best Supporting Actress * Hui Fan - Nominated for Best New Artist * Lee Hong-Gum, Wan Hol-Geen - Nominated for Best Original Score * Film was Nomination for Best Picture ==Related products== === Theme song === The main theme song is 'I Have a Date with Spring' sung by Alice Lau.

Similar to the film, the series takes place in flashbacks by Butterfly as she walks through a newly restored Flower Palace Nightclub. The series explores not only the lives of Butterfly, Lulu, Nancy, and Fung Ping while working at the nightclub, but also their lives before they began working at Flower Palace (such as Nancy being raised in an orphanage), as well as ongoing issues with their families (such as Fung Ping's less fortunate background, and Butterfly's father's dying career as a Cantonese Opera singer). It also expands more on the different characters working at Flower Palace, such as Yuen Bik. === Musical === In 2001-2005, the film was rewritten as a musical, the Flower Palace (\u9e97\u82b1\u7687\u5bae), many elder famous singers played in it, sang some of their best songs.
