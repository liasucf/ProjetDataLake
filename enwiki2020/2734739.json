    "text": "right Diadema The term ABC Region is an industrial region in Greater S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The name refers to three smaller cities south of S\u00e3o Paulo, capital of the Brazilian state of the same name. Originally, these three cities were Santo Andr\u00e9, S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, and S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul. Later, the region became known as the ABCD, with the addition of the city of Diadema. The ABC region is widely known in Brazil and abroad because of the great number of international companies, particularly car manufacturers, in its area. National media and organizations consider ABC a powerful industrial pole and birthplace of the labor union movement that fought against dictatorship in the 1970s and 1980s. In this region was formed the Workers' Party (PT) whose activities and popularity launched a great figure to the best known names in Brazil: Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, or simply Lula, president of Brazil in 2002. In 2006, the Universidade Federal do ABC was established. ==Population== Total Population : 2,546,135 inhabitants (2010) *Santo Andr\u00e9: 673,914 inhabitants \u2013 Literacy rate: 95.9% *S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo: 765,203 \u2013 Literacy rate: 95.4% *S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul: 149,571 \u2013 Literacy rate: 97.2% *Diadema: 386,039 \u2013 Literacy rate: 93.8% *Mau\u00e1: 417,281 \u2013 Literacy rate: 94% *Ribeir\u00e3o Pires: 113,043 - Literacy rate: 95% *Rio Grande da Serra: 44,084 - Literacy rate: 92.4% ===Classes=== *Class A/B: 70% *Class C : 25% *Class D/E: 5% Source: Brazilian Census 2000 and Brazilian Census 2010 (population). ==See also== *Santo Andr\u00e9 *S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo *S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul *Diadema *Mau\u00e1 *Ribeir\u00e3o Pires *Rio Grande da Serra. ==References== *Ag\u00eancia ABC - http://www.agenciagabc.com.br/ *Cons\u00f3rcio do Grande ABC - https://web.archive.org/web/20060206220932/http://consorcioabc.org.br/ *Newspapers: Di\u00e1rio do Grande ABC - http://www.dgabc.com.br/ ; Rep\u00f3rter Di\u00e1rio - http://www.reporterdiario.com.br/ Category:Metropolitan areas of S\u00e3o Paulo ",
