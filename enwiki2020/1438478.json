He took part in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side, and moved to France after the war. There, he was first interned at the French concentration camps in Rossell\u00f3, later forced to work on the Maginot Line, and finally deported by the Germans to the Mauthausen concentration camp. He survived for five years in the camp, and was then liberated by American troops. He later narrated his experiences and the atrocities of Nazism in the novel K.L. Reich (Barcelona: Club Editor i Kapel, 1984 ). Together with other survivors, he founded the Amical Mauthausen in 1962. ==External links== * Joaquim Amat-Piniella at the Association of Catalan Language Writers.
