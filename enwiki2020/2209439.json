A second edition, with a new concluding chapter, was published in 2000 by MIT Press. The book's discussion ranges from Rheingold's adventures on The WELL, computer-mediated communication and social groups and information science. Technologies cited include Usenet, MUDs (multi-user dungeons) and their derivatives MUSHes and MOOs, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), chat rooms, and electronic mailing lists. Rheingold also points out the potential benefits for personal psychological well-being, as well as for society at large, of belonging to a virtual community. ==External links== * The Virtual Community (Text of book on the author's site) Category:Sociology books Category:Community-building organizations Category:Books about the Internet ",
