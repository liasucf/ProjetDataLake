Even as a manager she experienced racist remarks from colleagues; \u201cThose black so and so\u2019s coming here and giving us orders!\u201d. These experiences of prejudice inspired Louise to dedicate herself to tackling race equality issues: \u201cdeep in my mind is my commitment to bridge the gap which has led to the blacks being treated as inferior.\u201d Rude Awakening African-Caribbean Settlers in Manchester, An Account In the 1960s and 1970s she served on regional Race Relations Board committees (later known as the Commission for Racial Equality, handling complaints brought under new anti-discrimination laws such as the Race Relations Act 1965.

Young Black people need role models around, not necessarily high profile ones\u2026\".The Bright Star, Eulogy by Sarah Da-Cocodia; see also transcript of Louise Da-Cocodia\u2019s speech West Indians in Manchester at Manchester Literary & Philosophical Society April 1996 in Manchester Memoirs, Volumes 134-135, Page 72 She co-founded and steered a number of community enterprise schemes including Cariocca Education Trust and Arawak Walton Housing Association.

She was also an advisor on the Moss Side and Hulme Task Force, and a member of the General Synod of the Church of England and a lay canon. Da-Cocodia was shortlisted in 2015 for the WoManchester Statue. Although Emmeline Pankhurst was decisively selected, Da- Cocodia's anti-racism work was brought to the attention of a new generation. The statue now sits in St Peter's Square, Manchester. First in the Fight (authors Helen Antrobus and Andrew Simcock, published 2019 ISBN number 978-1-84547-252-8) dedicates a chapter to Louise Da-Cocodia along with the other nineteen women considered for the statue. ==References== ==External links== *Louise Da-Cocodia Education Trust Category:1934 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People in health professions from Manchester Category:Anti- racism activists Category:Jamaican emigrants to the United Kingdom ",
