With captured cannon and prisoners, Lisowski moved to join the main forces of false Dmitry in Tushino. == Battle == While crossing the Moskva River between Kolomna and Moscow, burdened with captives and a wagon train, Lisowczycy were suddenly attacked by an elite cavalry regiment loyal to Tsar Vasily IV. Accustomed to maneuvering battles, Lisowczycy suffered a serious defeat and lost all of their Kolomna spoils. == Aftermath == After this defeat, Lisowczycy escaped back to Tushino. False Dmitry II lost important siege equipment and could not attack fortified Moscow, but continued blockade instead. == References == Category:1608 in Russia Category:17th-century military history of Russia Category:1608 in Europe Med Category:Conflicts in 1608 ",
