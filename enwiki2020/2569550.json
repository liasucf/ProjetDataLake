    "text": "Prince Francis of Teck, (Francis Joseph Leopold Frederick; 9 January 1870 \u2013 22 October 1910) was a brother of the British queen Mary of Teck, wife of King George V. ==Family== The Duchess of Teck with her children, about 1884. Francis Joseph Leopold Frederick, known as \"Frank\", was born at Kensington Palace and educated at Wellington College, Cheltenham College (Stone, 1912, p. xviii)Stone, E.D.

Retrieved 6 September 2011 from https://archive.org/stream/herbertkynastons00kynauoft/herbertkynastons00kynauoft_djvu.txt and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. His father was Prince Francis, Duke of Teck, the son of Duke Alexander of W\u00fcrttemberg and Countess Claudine Rh\u00e9dey von Kis-Rh\u00e9de (created the Countess von Hohenstein). His mother was the Duchess of Teck (n\u00e9e Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge), the youngest daughter of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge and a granddaughter of King George III. Frank was thus styled \"His Serene Highness Prince Francis of Teck\". ==Education== He was expelled from Wellington College, Berkshire \"for throwing his housemaster over a hedge to win a bet. All through his life he was an incorrigible gambler. He then went to Cheltenham where he got into more trouble.\" ==Personal life== Prince Francis was a gambler, whose debts led to him being sent to pursue his military career in India. Prince Francis never married. According to Julia P. Gelardi's Born to Rule, Prince Francis was vigorously pursued by Maud of Wales, his sister's sister-in-law. The two exchanged letters, but it soon became clear that Francis was not interested in Maud. She went on to marry her first cousin Prince Carl of Denmark, becoming Queen of Norway in 1905. Francis had an affair with society beauty Ellen Constance, wife of Francis Needham, 3rd Earl of Kilmorey, to whom he allegedly bequeathed the Cambridge emeralds, part of the Teck family jewels. To recover these family heirlooms, Francis's sister Queen Mary had his will sealed by a court, and subsequently negotiated with Lady Kilmorey to buy back the emeralds, reportedly paying her \u00a310,000 for them. The English actress Sarah Miles has claimed to be the great-granddaughter of Prince Francis, through her grandfather, allegedly an illegitimate son of the prince called Francis Remnant, born at Richmond, Surrey, in 1894.Sarah Miles, A right royal bastard (1993), p. 20: \"Clarice... the eldest child of Francis (Frank) Remnant, bastard son of Prince Francis of Teck\". ==Military career== He attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and served in the Lancers and the Royal Rifle Corps before joining the Royal Dragoons in 1890.

On his early death, shortly before his sister's coronation as queen of the United Kingdom, Francis of Teck's will set a legal precedent when it was sealed, to avoid potential scandal. The document remains unpublished, and subsequent royal wills have followed this tradition. He is buried in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore. ==Ancestry== == References == ==External links== *BBC Radio 4 programme Category:1870 births Category:1910 deaths Category:People from Kensington Francis Category:People educated at Wellington College, Berkshire Category:Graduates of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst Category:Companions of the Distinguished Service Order Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order Category:British Army personnel of the Second Boer War Category:British Army personnel of the Mahdist War Category:9th Queen's Royal Lancers officers Category:King's Royal Rifle Corps officers Category:1st The Royal Dragoons officers Category:Burials at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore ",
