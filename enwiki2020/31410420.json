It was in service from 1982 to 1939. ==History== Incorporated in 1890, the line opened on November 30, 1892. The next day, it was leased to the Old Colony Railroad for 99 years.Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners, Feb 15, 1911, page 437 In 1893, it became part of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad as part of the lease of the entire Old Colony Railroad network. Passenger service, never more than a few trips per day, was often operated as \u2013Plymouth or \u2013Plymouth trains After a competing bus line opened in 1925, passenger service ended in 1927. Beginning in early 1928, freight service was suspended for the winter after the end of the October\u2013December cranberry season. Freight service between North Carver and Plymouth was discontinued in 1934, and that section of the line was abandoned in 1937. The remainder of the line was abandoned in early 1939 with no objections from shippers. ==Stations== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Municipality ! Station ! Miles (km) !
