He was the father of the famous author, Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e. == Biography == His father was Fran\u00e7ois Merim\u00e9e (c. 1715-1795), a lawyer at the Parlement de Rouen and author of \"Treatise on fiefs and feudal rights in Normandy according to the natural order of matters and procedure divided into 5 parts (1760). He also served as a steward for the Mar\u00e9chal de Broglie. He studied at the Coll\u00e8ge de Caen before entering the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture in 1778, where he studied with Gabriel-Fran\u00e7ois Doyen and Fran\u00e7ois-\u00c9lie Vincent. His fellow students included Charles Meynier, Jacques-Augustin-Catherine Pajou and Charles Th\u00e9venin. In 1787, he was awarded second place in the Prix de Rome and achieved third place in 1788. This was followed by a trip to Holland, where he studied the Dutch Masters, after which he went to Rome. He stayed there until 1793, when certain events of the Revolution forced him to return home. He was given housing by the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Populaire et R\u00e9publicaine des Arts\" at the Louvre, where he undertook research on methods of preserving art by means of chemistry. In 1796, he began formal training on the conservation and restoration of paintings. He was removed from his position at the \u00c9cole centrale des Travaux publics during the Bourbon Restoration, but remained as \"Perpetual Secretary\" of the \u00c9cole des beaux-arts de Paris. In 1802, he married Anne Moreau (1774-1852), a portrait painter who was the granddaughter of Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. That same year, he held his final exhibition at the Salon. Thereafter M\u00e9rim\u00e9e turned his attention to the history of art and in particular, the chemistry, use and application of pigment color and oil paint. M\u00e9rim\u00e9e performed numerous experiments on the composition of paintings including those of Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci and Titian. He was also interested in the manufacture of paper, engraving, weaving and metallurgy. In 1830, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e published the results of his work, which had a major influence on the modern process of restoration: De la peinture \u00e0 l\u2019huile : ou, Des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s mat\u00e9riels employ\u00e9s dans ce genre de peinture, depuis Hubert et Jean Van-Eyck jusqu\u2019\u00e0 nos jours (1830). An English translation by W. B. Sarsfield Taylor was published in London in 1839. While the majority of this book was devoted to pigment analysis, varnishes, materials and the preservation of paintings, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e devoted a chapter to color theory. In this chapter, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e referred to \"three simple colours (yellow, red and blue)\" and that these can through admixture, produce a large gamut of color nuances. \u00dcnited in pairs, these three primitive colours give birth to three other colours as distinct and brilliant as their originals; thus, yellow mixed with red, gives orange; red and blue, violet, and green is obtained by mixing blue and yellow\" (M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, 1839, p245). M\u00e9rim\u00e9e illustrated these color relationships with a simple diagram located between pages 244 and 245: Chromatic Scale (Echelle Chromatique).Chromatic Scale (Echelle Chromatique), J. F. L M\u00e9rim\u00e9e (1830, 1839) Augustin-Jean Fresnel, the civil engineer and physicist, was his nephew. == Publications == * Rapport fait par M.
