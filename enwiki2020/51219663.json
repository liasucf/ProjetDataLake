The band\u2019s name comes from a word Topf first heard used by his mother, who spoke of missing the mainland of California where she grew up. Said Topf, \u201cIt felt fitting for our story and how we met in New York City.

On April 28th, 2019 the band released a 5-song EP titled Villains under 300 Entertainment. It included singles \"I Found God\" and \u201cHometown\". On May 22, 2019, Mainland collaborated with Rynx for the release of his fourth single, \u201cRead My Mind.\u201d ==Notable Features== Mainland\u2019s single \"Not As Cool As Me\" was featured on Shake Shack's Shack 10 playlist on Spotify, which features 10 popular songs playing in locations each month. ==Influences== Collectively, Mainland's influences include British bands such as The Cure, Depeche Mode, New Order, and The La's.
