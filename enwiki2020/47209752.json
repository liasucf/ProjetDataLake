He made his first team \u2013 and S\u00e9rie A \u2013 debut on 1 June 2014, coming on as a late substitute for Rafael S\u00f3bis in a 1\u20131 home draw against Internacional. Scarpa was rarely used during the season, and was loaned to Red Bull Brasil on 22 December 2014. He scored his first senior goal for the latter side the following 11 February, netting his team's first in a 3\u20132 Campeonato Paulista away win against Bragantino; ten days later he added a further goal, scoring in a 2\u20132 home draw against S\u00e3o Bento. After featuring regularly, Scarpa returned to Flu in May 2015. He started to feature more regularly for the first team managed by Enderson Moreira, often appearing as a left back. He scored his first S\u00e9rie A goal on 9 July, netting the game's only in a home success over Cruzeiro. On 28 September 2015, Scarpa renewed his contract until 2019, and finished the year as an undisputed starter. A mainstay in Fluminense's starting eleven during the 2016 campaign, he scored eight goals in the year's Brasileir\u00e3o; highlights included a double in a 2\u20132 away draw against Internacional. Scarpa started the 2017 season with four goals in six appearances, netting consecutive goals against Resende (1\u20130 home win), Portuguesa-RJ (3\u20130 away win), Bangu (4\u20130 home win) and Globo (5\u20132 away win); the latter came from the halfway line. On 25 February, in a 0\u20130 home draw against Madureira, he was replaced by Richarlison at half-time after suffering an ankle injury; it was later revealed that he would be staying two months out, and in the meantime he further extended his contract until 2020. ===Palmeiras=== On 15 January 2018, Gustavo Scarpa signed a five year contract with Palmeiras. ==International career== On 19 January 2017, Scarpa was called up by Tite for a friendly against Colombia. He made his full international debut six days later, replacing Lucas Lima in the 1\u20130 win at the Engenh\u00e3o. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|State League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\" valign=\"center\"|Fluminense |2014 |rowspan=\"4\"|S\u00e9rie A |6||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||0 |- |2015 |28||5||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||34||6 |- |2016 |34||8||15||3||7||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4Appearance(s) in Primeira Liga||1||60||14 |- |2017 |38||2||5||3||3||1||5||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||51||7 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Subtotal !106!!15!!20!!6!!16!!4!!5!!1!!4!!1!!151!!27 |- |valign=\"center\"|Red Bull Brasil (loan) |2015 |S\u00e9rie D |0||0||11||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||11||2 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Palmeiras |2018 | rowspan=\"2\" |S\u00e9rie A |12 |2 |7 |2 |1 |0 |2 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |22 |4 |- |2019 |10 |1 |11 |3 |1 |0 |7 |6 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |29 |10 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Subtotal !22 !3 !18 !5 !2 !0 !9 !6 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 !51 !14 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !128!!18!!49!!13!!18!!4!!14!!8!!4!!1!!213!!43 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! colspan=3 | Brazil |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2017||1||0 |- !Total||1||0 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Fluminense * Primeira Liga: 2016 ;Palmeiras *Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A: 2018 ===Individual=== * Campeonato Carioca Team of the Year: 2016 * Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A top assist provider: 2016 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Campinas Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players Category:Fluminense FC players Category:Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras players Category:Red Bull Brasil players Category:Brazil international footballers ",
