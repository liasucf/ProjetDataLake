    "text": "The Caples House Museum, also known as the Dr. Charles G. and Lucinda McBride Caples Farmstead, is a historic house museum in Columbia City, Oregon, United States. Dr. Charles Caples and Lucinda McBride Caples emigrated across the Oregon Trail as children and married in Oregon in 1855. Charles (1832\u20131906) was the first physician in Columbia County and built his home in 1870 during the early years of Columbia City. He and the Caples family made important contributions to the development of the town, including establishment of its first school. Lucinda (d. 1916) served as a midwife and her husband's medical assistant, and had family connections to many prominent Oregonians of the period. In 1959, the Caples' daughter, Dell Caples Houghton, bequeathed the house and its immediate surroundings to the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) for use as a museum. As of 2003, the property included the historic house, toolshed, and barn, a remnant portion of the Caples' historic apple and pear orchard, and four non-historic buildings including a gift shop and social hall. The house and toolshed remain in excellent historic condition.. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.. The DAR continues to operate the property as a museum as of 2018.. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Columbia County, Oregon ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Houses completed in 1870 Category:1959 establishments in Oregon Category:Neoclassical architecture in Oregon Category:National Register of Historic Places in Columbia County, Oregon Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Oregon Category:Historic house museums in Oregon Category:Museums in Columbia County, Oregon Category:Daughters of the American Revolution museums ",
