He played most of his career at Airdrieonians, but also played for one season at Newcastle United and Albion Rovers.

He was the son of Daniel Scott, who worked as an engine fitter on the railway at Airdrie, and Helen (n\u00e9e McLintock).\"Matthew Scott\", 1881 Scotland Census; 36 Aitcheson Street, New Monkland, Airdrie, Lanarkshire; roll cssct1881_263, page 12, line 6, enumeration district 21.

He played five matches in total and his debut was against Sheffield United on 8 December 1900, playing as a left back. He was described as being a \"touch slow when against a winger with pace\". For the duration of this season, Scott resided in Newcastle as a boarder of Mrs Isobel Harrison, a widow who lived at 136 Croydon Road.\"Matthew Scott\", 1901 England Census; 136 Croydon Road, Eslwick, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Tyne and Wear; Class: RG13; Piece: 4774; Folio: 39; Page: 22.
