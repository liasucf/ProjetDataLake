    "text": "The 2016 Umaglesi Liga was a special transitional season of top-tier football in Georgia. Dinamo Tbilisi were the defending champions. This transitional season is a result of the Georgian Football Federation's decision to change the Umaglesi Liga season from an Autumn\u2013Spring schedule to a Spring\u2013Autumn one. The season began on 7 August 2016 and concluded with the second leg of the championship final on 11 December 2016. ==Teams and stadiums== Sapovnela Terjola and Merani Martvili were relegated at the end of the previous season; they were not replaced. The league contracted from 16 teams to 14 this season; this will further be reduced to 10 for next season. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team !! Location !! Venue !!
