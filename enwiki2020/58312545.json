    "text": "The Light of Maternal Instinct is a 1933 Chinese drama film directed by Bu Wancang, starring Lai Cheuk-Cheuk, Chen Yanyan, and Jin Yan. It is a silent film since it lacks sound for dialogues, but there is background music composed by Ren Guang. One of the songs was composed by Nie Er. Bu Wancang is also the credited writer, but some scholars believe it was actually Tian Han who wrote the script. Tian Han had secretly joined the Communist Party of China in 1932 and was a wanted man by the Nationalist government for his leftist writings.
