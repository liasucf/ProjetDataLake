Established in 1726, the property is known for its two Ch\u00e2teaux, gardens, and its 20 hectare walled vineyard, Clos Marey-Monge. The Ch\u00e2teaux, the vineyard and the winemaking facilities are operated and owned by Michael Baum, who purchased the estate in 2014. The winery produces \"Clos\" wines \u2013 Pinot Noir produced from the fruit of Clos Marey-Monge and \"Family\" wines \u2013 Grand Cru, Premier Cru, Village and Bourgogne wines from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir appellations across the C\u00f4te de Nuits and the C\u00f4te de Beaune. In 2016, the estate tested biodynamic methods on 2.5 hectares of vines, and stated the intention of being entirely biodynamic for the 2019 vintage. Ch\u00e2teau de Pommard Harvest Pommard, Bourgogne, BIVB, Route des Grands Crus Sign == History == In 1726 Vivant Micault, a descendant of Philibert Micault, captain of Pommard in 1451, and secretary to King Louis XV, began constructing Ch\u00e2teau Micault, as it is known now, near the ruins of the 11th-century fortress of Odo I, Duke of Burgundy.Chateau de Pommard by Veronique Ovalde, Nov 2010 Ch\u00e2teau Micault, built from Chassagne-Montrachet pink limestone, was designed by Parisian architect, Charles-\u00c9tienne Brisseaux, in the Regency style of the era.Reuniting Two Ch\u00e2teaux: History of A Vineyard by Frederic Didier and Lucie Nicolas-Vullierme After thirty years of ownership and expansion, in 1756, Vivant Micault bequeathed the Ch\u00e2teau and the vineyards to his two sons, Joseph Micault and Jean Micault. The brothers' auctioned the estate between them, leaving Joseph to become the sole owner, buying out Jean for the sum of 90,000 francs. Jean Micault was guillotined, for the then-crime of emigration, in the centre of Dijon, in 1794. In 1763, the \"Royal estate of Pommard\" was purchased by local wine merchant, Claude Marey. Seven years later, in 1770, following the death of Claude Marey, Marey's son, Nicolas-Joseph Marey, inherited the Pommard estate and ran the operation with his wife, \u00c9milie Monge \u2013 daughter of French mathematician Gaspard Monge \u2013 the couple whom the vineyard would, in 1840, be named after. Then in 1789, on the eve of the French Revolution, Nicolas-Joseph sold Ch\u00e2teau Micault, a symbol of French aristocracy, for 25,000 francs to Paul Henri Francois. Unable to buy back the Ch\u00e2teau after the decade-long revolution, Nicolas-Joseph built a second manor \u2013 Ch\u00e2teau Marey-Monge in 1802, which became their family home. With Nicolas- Joseph's sudden death in 1818, at the age of 58, \u00c9milie Marey-Monge became the first female head of the winemaking estate. Staying within the family throughout the tenure of the couple's eight children, including war hero Guillaume-Stanislas Marey-Monge and politician Alphonse Marey-Monge, it wasn't until the youngest granddaughter, Edith Marey-Monge, married H\u00e9rve de Blic that the Ch\u00e2teau found itself under the ownership of a new family name. The vineyards and the two Ch\u00e2teaux remained divided until 1936 when the Ch\u00e2teau was purchased by Louis Laplanche. It was later on that his son \u2013 and famous psychoanalyst \u2013 Jean Laplanche would achieve their family's lifelong ambition of finally reuniting the estate. In 2003, after almost 80 years of Laplanche Family stewardship, Ch\u00e2teau de Pommard found itself under new proprietors \u2013 this time, the Giraud family, from Haute Savoie. Maurice Giraud transformed Ch\u00e2teau de Pommard into a 21st century wine tourist destination, and employed the society of the craftsmen and artisans, the Compagnons du Tour de France, to renovate the entire premises, as well as introducing the now-trademarked \"Grand Vin\" hand-blown \"dumpy\" bottle, based on an original mid-18th-century Pommard wine bottle, and, in 2010, the cuv\u00e9e Simone, produced from the Simone terroir, which contains one of the highest clay densities in Burgundy. In 2014, Michael Baum, an American software entrepreneur, bought the entirety of the estate and became the first American to own a wine-producing ch\u00e2teau in Burgundy. ==Clos Marey-Monge== Each of Clos Marey-Monge's seven plots \u2013 Simone, Chantrerie, Les Paules, Grand Champ, 75 Rangs, Micault and \u00c9milie \u2013 has its own soil type and microclimate. Simone and Chantrerie contain two of the highest clay density levels recorded in Burgundy, a measurement of more than 735m2/g, as discovered by Claude Bourguignon and Lydia Bourguignon of LAMS in 2009. The south-east facing vines of the vineyard spans 20 hectares in surface area and is enclosed within a two-meter-tall and 2,000-meter-long stone fortress wall, erected in 1812 by Nicolas-Joseph Marey-Monge. With 150 million years of geology forming the fundamental building blocks of its soilsCaract\u00e9risation Physiographique, G\u00e9ologique et P\u00e9dologique du vignoble du Ch\u00e2teau de Pommard, by Adama Clos Marey-Monge today sits on an alluvial fan known as the Avant-Dheune Valley dejection cone, a geological structure that presents helpful conditions for the notoriously demanding Pinot Noir varietal to flourish. Clos Marey-Monge was awarded premi\u00e8re cuv\u00e9e status in Professor Jules Lavalle's The History and Statistics of the Great Wines of the C\u00f4te d'Or, a comprehensive classification of the region's soils, first published in 1855. Since 2016, and in collaboration with Biodynamic Specialist, Antoine Lepetit de la Bigne, Clos Marey-Monge is both biodynamically and sustainably farmed. ==UNESCO== In July 2015, UNESCO declared Clos Marey-Monge a world heritage protected Climat of Burgundy. The Carabello-Baum family were one of the Grand M\u00e9c\u00e8ne of the UNESCO Burgundy Climats project, an accolade which honoured Burgundy's 1,247 climats for their Exceptional Universal Value. Aubert de Villaine, president of the Association des Climats du Vignoble de Bourgogne, said of the achievement: \"This status is the recognition of the work of generations of men and women, vignerons, Cistercian monks and Dukes of Burgundy, who have all created Burgundy's vineyards over the centuries in a determined quest for excellence.\" The UNESCO count of 1,247 seems to be an under-counting, due to database errors. A more accurate number is 1,628. == References == Category:French winemakers Category:Wineries of France Category:1726 establishments in France Category:French companies established in 1726 Category:Food and drink companies established in 1726 ",
