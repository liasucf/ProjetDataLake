Angeja obtained a foral from King D. Manuel I on 15 August 1514, that included the lands of Assequins, Bemposta, Branca, Canelas, Casais de Grij\u00f3, Casais do Ribeiro, Contumil, Devesa, Fermel\u00e3, Figueiredo, Fonte Ch\u00e3, Pinheiro, Salreu and Santi\u00e3es. Initially, this territory was part of the Terras de Santa Maria (Lands of Santa Maria), commonly known as Terras da Feira (Lands of the Fair), which were incorporated into coat-of-arms. By 1853 Angeja was the municipal seat, but this lasted until the end of the year, when the municipality became extinct and integrated into the much larger municipality of Albergaria-a- Velha. The old town of Angeja and parish of Nossa Senhora das Neves was a curia of the vicarage of S\u00e3o Miguel de Fermel\u00e3, later rectory and priory. The marquesses of Angeja, who never lived in the parish, had a procurator that received the land rents. During the Napoleonic Wars the French razed many of the homes in the parish, which were followed by national revolts during the Restoration and Liberal Wars. During the Liberal Constitution, the reorganization of the civil government and administration had resulted in annexation of several other parishes: Canelas, Fermel\u00e3 and Frossos. In 1849 its population had surpassed 5124 inhabitants After this period of political instability, the small parish was elevated to the status of municipality in 1853, before its administrative charter was extinguish and re-integrated (along with Frossos) into the municipality of Albergaria-a-Velha.
