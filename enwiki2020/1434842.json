    "text": "Menzies is a Scottish surname. It is probably derived, like its Gaelic form M\u00e9innearach, from the Norman name Mesni\u00e8res from the town of Mesni\u00e8res-en-Bray in Normandy.David Hey, Clan Menzies websiteBBC Alba - Litir do Luchd- ionnsachaidh (554)Family names and family history, pp 37-38 == Pronunciation == The name is traditionally pronounced \u2014 and still is in Scotland \u2014 , since the English letter was used as a substitute for the now obsolete English letter (yogh) in the Scots language (). However, many now do not know this, and today it is often pronounced as if it were an English word and hence is often mispronounced . A Scottish limerick plays on the traditional pronunciation: > There wis a young lassie named Menzies, That askit her aunt whit this > thenzies. Said her aunt wi a gasp, \"Ma dear, it's a wasp, An you're haudin > the end whaur the stenzies!\" The second and fifth lines are pronounced as though the were a <>, making \"thing is\" and \"sting is\", to rhyme with \"Menzies\". \"Wasp\" rhymes with \"gasp\" in Scots. == As a surname == * Alan W.
