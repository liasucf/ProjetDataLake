Based on the Welsh Eisteddfod, Oireachtas na Gaeilge runs for one week, featuring performances, demonstrations and competitions. The festival is held in two portions: a visual arts festival in April/May and the festival proper on the last weekend of October or the first of November, when more than 10,000 people attend the seven-day event. In 2007, the festival was held at Westport. The 2008 festival took place in the Cork city suburb of Douglas, the local support committee was under the chairmanship of Peadar \u00d3 Riada, son of the composer and founder of the male choir C\u00f3r Ch\u00fail Aodha, Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Riada. ==History== The first Oireachtas na Gaeilge festival was organised in 1897 by Conradh na Gaeilge (the Gaelic League), which envisaged it as part of a renaissance of traditional Irish arts and culture. in the Round Room of Dublin's Rotunda, one of the largest halls in the city at that time. It was just a half-day festival, but the attendance still exceeded a thousand people, an unexpected level of interest. In contrast to today's festival, there was little emphasis on the performing arts. The competitions included two for poetry, five for prose essays, one for poetry compilations; a competition for unpublished songs or stories in Irish; a competition for new song compositions and a recitation competition. While the festival management pulled off accomplishments including the staging of the first Irish-language opera, the popularity of the Oireachtas waned in the early part of the twentieth century, and the festival was cancelled for a number of years in the 1920s and 1930s. In response, the organisers, under the Directorship of Liam \u00d3 Maolaodha attempted from the 1990s on to market the festival to younger speakers of Irish via outings, discos, and other youth- oriented events. The festival was originally held in Dublin, but since the 1970s, it has been held in different cities and towns around Ireland. The festival culminates in four major competitions over the weekend: Com\u00f3rtas na mBan, a Sean-n\u00f3s singing competition for women, Com\u00f3rtas na bhFear, for men, Corn U\u00ed Riada, for all age and gender categories, and the Com\u00f3rtas Damhsa ar an Sean N\u00f3s (\"Steip\"), a free-style dancing competition mainly based on the Conamara individual step style now popular around the country, but also includes dancing in other regional styles. Past winners of Corn U\u00ed Riada include \u00c1ine U\u00ed Cheallaigh, Lillis \u00d3 Laoire, M\u00e1irt\u00edn Tom She\u00e1n\u00edn Mac Donnchadha, M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Confhaola and 2008 winner Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Con Cheanainn from An Spid\u00e9al.

Steip, the Sean n\u00f3s dancing competition, on TG4 has consistently attracted the station's highest annual audience figures. Its success is due to the hard work of Festival administrator M\u00e1ir\u00edn Nic Dhonnchadha who effectively revived the competition from 2000 onwards. In 2008, for the first time, the station broadcast live segments of the Corn U\u00ed Riada competition. ==References== * * * * ==External links== *Festival website *An Irishwoman's Diary Preview in Irish Times 2008 by Catherine Foley Category:Irish language Category:Cultural festivals in Ireland Category:Celtic music festivals Category:Festivals established in 1897 ",
