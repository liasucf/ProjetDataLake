    "text": "Hjalti Skeggiason was an Icelandic chieftain who supported Gizurr the White for the introduction of Christianity in Iceland, on the Althing in 1000. Later he spent time with the Norwegian king Olaf the Stout and accompanied Bj\u00f6rn Stallare on his diplomatic mission to Ragnvald Ulfsson in V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland and to Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung in Uppsala. Snorri Sturluson's detailed account of this voyage is probably based on an account made by Hjalti after his return to Iceland. ==Sources== *An article in Nordisk familjebok Category:Vikings Category:10th- century Icelandic people Category:Go\u00f0ar ",
