He was educated at Camden Grammar School. Anderson's best shot was his forehand drive, which he hit with very little topspin. He is best remembered for his three victories at his home tournament: the Australasian Championships in 1922, 1924 and 1925. Anderson also won the doubles tournament at the 1922 Wimbledon Championships and 1924 Australian Championships. Between 1919 and 1925 Anderson played in 15 ties for the Australian Davis Cup team and compiled a record of 28 wins and 8 losses. He married Maud Irene Whitfield (died 1955) on 24 March 1917. They had five children. He married a widow, Mabel Little, on 18 November 1957. Anderson died on 22 December 1973 at Gosford. He was survived by his second wife. In 2013 Anderson was inducted in the International Tennis Hall of Fame. == Grand Slam finals == === Singles: 3 titles === {| class='sortable wikitable' !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:35px\"|Year !style=\"width:180px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:160px\"|Opponent !style=\"width:180px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ffc;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1922 || Australian Championships || Grass || Gerald Patterson || 6\u20130, 3\u20136, 3\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20132 |-style=\"background:#ffc;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1924 || Australian Championships || Grass || Richard Schlesinger || 6\u20133, 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 5\u20137, 6\u20133 |-style=\"background:#ffc;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1925 || Australian Championships || Grass || Gerald Patterson || 11\u20139, 2\u20136, 6\u20132, 6\u20133 |} ===Doubles: 6 (2 titles, 4 runners-up)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:35px\"|Year !style=\"width:180px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:160px\"|Partner !style=\"width:160px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:180px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ffc;\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1919 || Australian Championships || Grass || Arthur Lowe || Pat O'Hara Wood Ronald Thomas || 5\u20137, 1\u20136, 9\u20137, 6\u20133, 3\u20136 |-style=\"background:#ffc;\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1922 || Australian Championships || Grass || Norman Peach || John Hawkes Gerald Patterson || 10\u20138, 0\u20136, 0\u20136, 5\u20137 |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1922 || Wimbledon || Grass || Randolph Lycett || Pat O'Hara Wood Gerald Patterson || 3\u20136, 7\u20139, 6\u20134, 6\u20133, 11\u20139 |-style=\"background:#ffc;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1924 || Australian Championships || Grass || Norman Brookes || Pat O'Hara Wood Gerald Patterson || 6\u20132, 6\u20134, 6\u20133 |-style=\"background:#ffc;\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1925 || Australian Championships || Grass || Fred Kalms || Pat O'Hara Wood Gerald Patterson || 4\u20136, 6\u20138, 5\u20137 |-style=\"background:#ffc;\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss || 1926 || Australian Championships || Grass || Pat O'Hara Wood || John Hawkes Gerald Patterson || 1\u20136, 4\u20136, 2\u20136 |} ==References== ==External links== * Australian Dictionary of Biography \u2013 Anderson, James Outram (1894\u20131973) * * * * Category:1894 births Category:1973 deaths Category:Australasian Championships (tennis) champions Category:Australian male tennis players Category:Tennis people from New South Wales Category:Wimbledon champions (pre- Open Era) Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in men's singles Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in men's doubles Category:International Tennis Hall of Fame inductees ",
