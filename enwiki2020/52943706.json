In 1875, he was apprenticed to a watchmaker. After becoming a journeyman, he travelled extensively to improve his skills. This included a stay in Italy, where visits to art galleries inspired him to become a painter instead. With the patronage of Vilem\u00edna kn\u011b\u017ena z Auerspergu (1826-1898), he began taking lessons from Franti\u0161ek Sequens and Maximilian Pirner at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague, continued his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich with Alexander von Wagner, then worked as a painter and art teacher in Plze\u0148. His painting \"Hopeless Love\" won a major award at the General Land Centennial Exhibition in 1891. It also earned him a one-year scholarship to study in Paris where he worked with Vojt\u011bch Hynais, who had created the curtain for the Prague National Theater. In 1900, as a result of this experience, he was commissioned to create a curtain for the new Josef Kajet\u00e1n Tyl Theatre. At about the same time, he painted lunettes at the recently completed . He also created monumental paintings for the Higher Economic School, now a satellite institute of Charles University. From 1907 to 1925, he was a teacher at the girls' lyceum. He is best known as a regionalist, focusing on costumes and village life from the surrounding areas. A museum has been opened at his family home in Nepomuk and, on the 150th anniversary of his birth in 2011, a memorial plaque was placed at his home in Plze\u0148. ==Selected paintings== File:Nemejc- Hopeless.jpg|Hopeless Love File:Augustin N\u011bmejc - St\u0159\u00edh\u00e1n\u00ed ovc\u00ed.jpg|Sheep Shearing Image:Augustin N\u011bmejc - Liti\u010danka u plotu.jpg|At the Fence Image:Augustin N\u011bmejc - \u017d\u00edzniv\u00fd n\u00e1v\u0161t\u011bvn\u00edk.jpg|Thirsty Visitor ==References== ==Further reading== * Jan Skolka, Augustin N\u011bmejc : mal\u00ed\u0159 Plzn\u011b a Plze\u0148ska, Nava, 2000 * Ji\u0159\u00ed Tetzeli, Augustin N\u011bmejc.
