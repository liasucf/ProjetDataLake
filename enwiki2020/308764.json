    "text": "Arthur Norman Prior (4 December 1914 \u2013 6 October 1969), usually cited as A. N. Prior, was a New Zealand\u2013born logician and philosopher. Prior (1957) founded tense logic, now also known as temporal logic, and made important contributions to intensional logic, particularly in Prior (1971). ==Biography== Prior was born in Masterton, New Zealand, on 4 December 1914, the only child of Australian-born parents: Norman Henry Prior (1882\u20131967) and his wife born Elizabeth Munton Rothesay Teague (1889\u20131914). His mother died less than three weeks after his birth and he was cared for by his father's sister. His father, a medical practitioner in general practice, after war service at Gallipoli and in Francewhere he was awarded the Military Crossremarried in 1920 and there were three more children. Arthur Prior grew up in a prominent Methodist household. His two Wesleyan grandfathers, the Reverends Samuel Fowler Prior and Hugh Henwood Teague were sent from England to South Australia as missionaries in 1875.Adelaide Observer, 28 August 1875, p. 7. The Prior family first moved to New Zealand in 1893. While studying for his first degree A. N. Prior attended the seminary at Dunedin's Knox Theological Hall but decided against entering the Presbyterian ministry and began to focus on logic. Following his first marriage in 1937 they spent some years in Europe returning after the outbreak of war. After divorce from his first wife he remarried in 1943 to Mary Wilkinson. They were to have a son and a daughter. He served in the Royal New Zealand Air Force from 1943 to 1945 then began his academic career at Canterbury University College in February 1946 taking over a vacancy made when Karl Popper left.Per Hasle The Life of Prior (1914-69). A Brief Overview, accessed 8 June 2019 After returning to New Zealand following a year at Oxford as a visiting lecturer he took up a professorship in 1959 at Manchester University where he remained until he was elected a Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford in 1966 and appointed a Reader. He continued his Manchester practice of accepting visiting professorships. Arthur Prior went to give lectures at Norwegian universities in September 1969 and on 6 October 1969, the night before he was to deliver a lecture there, he died from a heart attack at Trondheim, Norway. ==Professional life== Prior was educated entirely in New Zealand, where he was fortunate to have come under the influence of J. N. Findlay. Despite knowing only modest mathematics, he began teaching philosophy and logic at Canterbury University College in February 1946, filling the vacancy created by Karl Popper's resignation. In 1951 Prior met J. J. C. Smart, also known as \"Jack\" Smart, at a philosophical conference in Australia and the two developed a life-long friendship. Their correspondence was influential on Prior's development of tense logic. Smart adhered to the tenseless theory of time and was never persuaded by Prior's arguments, though Prior was influential in making Smart skeptical about Wittgenstein's view on pseudo-relations.Logic and Philosophy of Time: Themes from Prior. He became Professor in 1953. Thanks to the good offices of Gilbert Ryle, who had met Prior in New Zealand in 1954, Prior spent the year 1956 on leave at the University of Oxford, where he gave the John Locke lectures in philosophy. These were subsequently published as Time and Modality (1957). This is a seminal contribution to the study of tense logic and the metaphysics of time, in which Prior championed the A-theorist view that the temporal modalities past, present and future are basic ontological categories of fundamental importance for our understanding of time and the world. During his time at Oxford, Prior met Peter Geach and William Kneale, influenced John Lemmon, and corresponded with the adolescent Saul Kripke. Logic in the United Kingdom was then in a rather low state, and Prior's enthusiasm is believed to have contributed materially to its revival. From 1959 to 1966, he was Professor of Philosophy at the University of Manchester, having taught Osmund Lewry. From 1966 until his death he was Fellow and Tutor in philosophy at Balliol College, Oxford. His students include Max Cresswell, Kit Fine, and Robert Bull. Almost entirely self-taught in modern formal logic, Prior published his first paper on logic in 1952, when he was 38 years of age, shortly after discovering the work of J\u00f3zef Maria Boche\u0144ski and Jan \u0141ukasiewicz, very little of whose work was then translated into English. He went on to employ Polish notation throughout his career. Prior (1955) distills much of his early teaching of logic in New Zealand. Prior's work on tense logic provides a systematic and extended defence of a tensed conception of reality in which material objects are construed as three-dimensional continuants which are wholly present at each moment of their existence. Prior stood out by virtue of his strong interest in the history of logic. He was one of the first English-speaking logicians to appreciate the nature and scope of the logical work of Charles Sanders Peirce, and the distinction between de dicto and de re in modal logic. Prior taught and researched modal logic before Kripke proposed his possible worlds semantics for it, at a time when modality and intentionality commanded little interest in the English speaking world, and had even come under sharp attack by Willard Van Orman Quine. He is now said to be the precursor of hybrid logic. Undertaking (in one section of his book Past, Present, and Future (1967)) the attempt to combine binary (e.g., \"until\") and unary (e.g., \"will always be\") temporal operators to one system of temporal logic, Prior\u2014as an incidental result\u2014builds a base for later hybrid languages. His work Time and Modality explored the use of a many-valued logic to explain the problem of non-referring names. Prior's work was both philosophical and formal and provides a productive synergy between formal innovation and linguistic analysis. Natural language, he remarked, can embody folly and confusion as well as the wisdom of our ancestors. He was scrupulous in setting out the views of his adversaries, and provided many constructive suggestions about the formal development of alternative views. ==Publications== The following books were either written by Prior, or are posthumous collections of journal articles and unpublished papers that he wrote: * 1949.
