He was twice NCAA champion, winning an indoor 5000 m title and outdoor 10,000 meters title in 2011 for the Iona Gaels. He gained United States citizenship and began competing for his adoptive nation in 2016. ==Career== Korir in 2017 ===Early life=== Korir attended Tambach Teachers Training College and it was only there, at the age of twenty, that his skill for running was identified. Strong performances by the Iten-based athlete led him to a meeting with Irish coach Colm O'Connell.McCue, Matt (September 23, 2011). Rising Star: Leonard Korir. Runner's World. Retrieved on 2016-07-13. O'Connell advised him to try for an athletic scholarship at an American university and supported Korir's running efforts. He opted to study political science at Iona College, an institution he recognised as a fellow Kenyan, Richard Kiplagat, had attended there. ===College=== Despite his running pedigree, Korir did not excel athletically in his first year for the Iona Gaels, finishing fifth at the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) cross country, though he did reach the 10,000 meters podium in third at the 2010 MAAC Outdoor Track Championships. His improvement was marked in his second year there: he won the MAAC Cross Country title, then took fourth at the NCAA Men's Division I Cross Country Championship after winning the regional title. In the 2011 indoor season he won the mile run and distance medley relay MAAC titles for Iona and set a 5000 meters school record of 13:26.01 minutes to win at the NCAA Men's Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships. He won his second collegiate title at the NCAA Men's Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships that year, topping the field over 10,000 m as well as coming third in the 5000 m.Leonard Korir.
