    "text": "Rhododendron spinuliferum is a species of Rhododendron native to Yunnan, southwestern Sichuan, and Guizhou China. ==Taxonomy== French botanist Adrien Ren\u00e9 Franchet described Rhododendron spinuliferum in 1895. Two subspecies are recognised. Within the genus Rhododendron, it lies in the subgenus Rhododendron and section Rhododendron. Analysis of its DNA shows it is most closely related to R. triflorum, the two sister species have R. keiskei as the next closest relative. However, the section appears to be polyphyletic, with these species early offshoots of the section Vireya. ==Description== habit, cult. Kunming Botanic Garden Rhododendron spinuliferum grows as a shub ranging from high, occasionally reaching high. It has delicate oval or lanceolate (spear-shaped) leaves long by wide, with cuneate (wedge-shaped) bases and pointed tips. The red tube-shaped flowers appear from February to June. These tubular corollas and tapered ends are unusual for the genus. ==Distribution and habitat== The range is southwestern Sichuan, northeastern and western Yunnan at altitudes ranging from , in coniferous forests with Keteleeria, or mixed conifer and deciduous forest with oak (Quercus), in shaded areas and thickets. ==Cultivation and uses== In cultivation, Rhododendron spinuliferum grows best in acidic soils of pH 4\u20136 with a shady aspect and significant organic material in the soil, although excess shade will result in few flowers and leggy habit. Readily propagated by seed or cuttings, it flowers in four to five years from seed. Hybrids derived from this species include R. 'Crossbill' (spinuliferum x lutescens). R. 'Seta', A. M. (spinuliferum x moupinense) and R. 'Spinulosum' (spinuliferum x racemosum). Rhododendron spinuliferum has been used in Chinese traditional medicine to remove phlegm and treat asthma. ==References== spinuliferum Category:Flora of China Category:Fauna of Yunnan Category:Plants described in 1895 Category:Plants used in traditional Chinese medicine ",
