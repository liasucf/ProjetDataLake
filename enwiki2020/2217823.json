The top can easily be lifted off and the hatch door reattached, so the car can be used without the Toppola. The unit is small, but features full standing height (2.0 m) and a 170 by 200 cm bed. It could be fitted with a complete kitchen and even a heater for use during winter. The total weight addition is about .
