For this short duration of time, he was influenced by the art of Pablo Picasso. Later, after 1970, he had created his own style of painting, calling it Rhythm. Since his beginnings, his favorite subject remains Indian monuments and archaeological sites. He has always painted his art either on-site of his reference monument, or he paints a sketch and from that reference, he paints in his studio. Since 1970 he found the fourth dimension in his artwork which is motion, which he calls Rhythm. His art is influenced by nature, and he feels that he paints that rhythm in his painting. == Awards and honours == * 1959 Bronze medal at Bombay Art Society * 1960 Kalidas Exbhibition Award * 1960 All India Khadi Certificate of merits * 1960 Award by Jamu and Kashmir * 1961 The Governor of Maharashtra\u2019s prize Bombay Art Society * 1961 Kalidas Exbhibition Award * 1961 Award by All India Redio * 1961 Gold medal at Indore * 1962 Gujarat Lalit Kala Award * 1962 Diploma of Merit at first international art exhibition in Saigon * 1962 Hydrabad Art Society Award * 1963 Gujarat Lalit Kala Award * 1963 Hydrabad Art Society Award * 1963 Kalidas Exbhibition Award * 1963 Government of India schorlorship from 1963 to 1965 * 1964 Kalidas Exbhibition Award * 1965 Gujarat Lalit Kala Award * 1965 Gold medal at International book and art exhibition Leipzig Germany * 1965 Hydrabad Art Society Award * 1965 Kalidas Exbhibition Award * 1966 Kalidas Exbhibition Award * 1969 Two Awards by Railway * 1970 Gujarat Lalit Kala Award * 1970 National award for painting Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi * 1971 Gujarat Lalit Kala Award * 1974 Gujarat Lalit Kala Award * 1979 Gujarat Lalit Kala Award * 1980 National award for graphic Lalit Kala Akademi, New Delhi * 2008 Gujarat Gaurav Puraskar by Gujarat State Lalit Kala Academi * 2017 Raja Ravi Verma award. ==See also== * Baroda Group * List of printmakers * List of Indian artists * List of Indian painters * List of Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda people * * * * == References == == External links == *Jayant Parikh's website Category:Indian printmakers Category:Indian muralists Category:1940 births Category:Living people Category:Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda alumni Category:20th-century Indian painters Category:Indian male painters ",
