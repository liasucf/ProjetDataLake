They needed to think of a way to find more children to play their music to. :Mike Bopp invented The Gloombuster. This special machine allows The Bopps to talk with children everywhere who like to listen and dance to music. Soon The Bopps were travelling all over the country making new friends and inviting everyone to become a Bopper. Over time their special tree house grew and grew until there was a large and comfortable den. Wooden steps inside the trunk of the tree take you to the Gloombuster. Below the Gloombuster is a recording studio and then, at the very bottom of the tree is Mike Bopp\u2019s inventing room and a door to the outside world\u2026\u2026which is very well hidden. |} ==Television series== The Bopps first went on air in the United Kingdom on 6 April 2010 on the children's channel Nick Jr. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *The Bopps - The Bopping Tunes from the TV Series (2010) ===Singles=== \"The Bopps Theme\", \"Best Friend\", \"Numbers\", \"Toy Box\", \"Park\", \"Dance\", \"Hoppity Hop\", \"Noisy Nigel\", \"Jelly Shoes\", \"Sunshine\" and \"Ghost Song\" (December 2010) ==References== ==External links== *Official website *The Bopps on Nick Jr *Nick Jr Category:British children's television series Category:Nick Jr. original programming Category:British children's musical groups Category:2010 British television series debuts Category:2010s British children's television series ",
