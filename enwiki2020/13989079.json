He was Real Oviedo's all-time top scorer in La Liga, with 117 goals in 213 games.Los hermanos Ram\u00f3n Herrera \"el Sabio\" y Herrerita (Brothers Ram\u00f3n Herrera \"the Wise One\" and Herrerita); F\u00fatbol y Pasiones Pol\u00edticas, 10 January 2014 ==Club career== Born in Gij\u00f3n, Asturias as the youngest of eight siblings,Herrera Bueno, \u00abHerrerita\u00bb, Eduardo; at Vivir Asturias Herrerita played youth football with local Sporting de Gij\u00f3n. In 1933 he moved to the professionals, joining neighbouring Real Oviedo for a then-record 30.000 pesetas and finishing his first season in La Liga with 11 goals in only 18 games. During the better part of the following 15 years, Herrerita would be part of an attacking line that would be dubbed Delanteras El\u00e9ctricas (Electric Forwards), also including the likes of Casuco, Emil\u00edn, Ricardo Gallart and Isidro L\u00e1ngara. The players combined for an astonishing 174 goals in 62 matches in their first three seasons together.Historia (History) ; at Real Oviedo The competition was resumed in 1939\u201340 following the Spanish Civil War, but Oviedo could not take part in the tournament due to the state in which the city was left after the conflict. Thus, Herrera and Emil\u00edn signed for FC Barcelona for that campaign, with the Catalans only ranking in ninth place. Returned to Oviedo, Herrerita continued to feature and score regularly for the team, helping it to four five-place finishes from 1943 to 1949. In the latter season, he netted 12 goals in only 15 contests, but featured only twice in the following year as the Carbayones eventually suffered relegation; in 13 years, he appeared in 270 official games for his main side. In 1950, Herrerita returned to his first club Sporting, playing one season in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n and retiring afterwards. Subsequently, he acted as assistant manager with Oviedo, and died on 15 August 1991 at the age of 77. ==International career== Herrerita played six games with Spain, during three years. His debut came on 18 March 1934, in a 2\u20131 friendly win in Portugal. ==Personal life== Herrerita's son, Jes\u00fas, was also a footballer and a forward. He too represented Oviedo, and played in the top division with Real Madrid and Real Sociedad.\u00abChus\u00bb Herrera ha muerto (\u00abChus\u00bb Herrera is dead); ABC, 21 October 1962 ==References== ==External links== * * * Spain stats at Eu-Football Category:1914 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Gij\u00f3n Category:Spanish footballers Category:Asturian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Real Oviedo players Category:FC Barcelona players Category:Sporting de Gij\u00f3n players Category:Spain international footballers ",
