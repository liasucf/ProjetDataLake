    "text": "Carpenterville is an unincorporated community in Curry County, Oregon, United States. It is located on the former alignment of U.S. Route 101 known as the Roosevelt Highway (now Oregon Route 255 or the Carpenterville Highway), about 16 miles north of Brookings. Carpenterville was the highest point on the former main coastal highway and the area is known for its views. D. W. Carpenter and his family settled in the area in 1921. The family ran a sawmill that produced lumber for fences. Carpenterville post office was established in 1932 and named for the Carpenter family. In 1940, Carpenterville's population was 35. The post office closed in 1944. When Carpenterville was still on the main route of the Coast Highway, there was a public school, a store, tourist cabins, and a lodge, the Skyline Lodge and Restaurant. The realignment of the highway cut the community off from the main coastal road. By 1990, there was only one house to mark the location of the community, however the USGS still classifies Carpenterville as a populated place. The Carpenter Family is still very much active in the Carpenterville area. Rocky Carpenter, Alvin Carpenter, Rodney Carpenter, Zed Carpenter and many more. ==See also== *List of ghost towns in Oregon ==References== ==External links== *Images of Carpenterville from Flickr Category:1932 establishments in Oregon Category:Unincorporated communities in Curry County, Oregon Category:Unincorporated communities in Oregon ",
