Nady played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, Arizona Diamondbacks, Washington Nationals, San Francisco Giants, and the San Diego Padres. The St. Louis Cardinals originally drafted Nady in the 4th round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft (134th overall) after he was named Northern California Player of the Year in his senior year of high school (but he did not sign professionally at that time). Nady attended University of California, Berkeley, where he set the all-time Pac-10 Conference record for career slugging percentage (.729) for the California Golden Bears baseball team. ==Professional career== ===San Diego Padres=== Nady was drafted in the second round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft by the San Diego Padres (49th overall). Nady signed a major league contract and became the 18th player to go directly to the major leagues without making his professional debut in the minor leagues since . Nady only appeared in one major league game before being sent to the minor leagues. He was named Padres Minor League Player of the Year in , also collecting the California League's Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year awards that season. Nady underwent Tommy John surgery and had limited playing time in . In he again returned to the major league level for part of the season, but spent most of his time in the minor leagues. In late June Nady became the first Padre since Greg Vaughn (in ) to homer in four consecutive games. ===New York Mets=== The Padres traded him to the New York Mets for Mike Cameron on November 18, 2005. Nady underwent an emergency appendectomy early in the morning on May 30, 2006. As a result, he was placed on the 15-day disabled list, and returned to the lineup on June 18. Pittsburgh Pirates in 2007 ===Pittsburgh Pirates=== On July 30, 2006, Mets set-up relief pitcher Duaner S\u00e1nchez was injured when the cab in which he was a passenger was broadsided. The Mets' pitching corps was already depleted with star pitcher Pedro Mart\u00ednez on the disabled list. Desperate for pitching, the Mets were forced to give up Nady, their starting right fielder, to the Pirates in exchange for pitchers \u00d3liver P\u00e9rez and Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez. ===New York Yankees=== Nady with the Yankees in 2008 On July 26, 2008, the New York Yankees acquired Nady and pitcher D\u00e1maso Marte from the Pittsburgh Pirates for Jos\u00e9 T\u00e1bata, Ross Ohlendorf, Daniel McCutchen, and Jeff Karstens. Nady had a career-high six (6) RBIs as the Yankees came back to beat the Los Angeles Angels on August 3, 2008. He finished the 2008 season setting career-highs in home runs (25) and runs batted in (97), and had a .305 batting average. Xavier Nady signed a one- year contract worth $6.65 million with the Yankees, thus avoiding arbitration. On April 14, 2009, Nady suffered a right-elbow injury which ultimately required a second Tommy John surgery on July 8, despite an initial attempt to rehab the injury. The surgery ended his 2009 season. As a result, Nick Swisher took over in Nady's position for the remainder of the 2009 season. Nady spent the season (including the postseason) on the disabled list until the Yankees won the 2009 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. He filed for free agency following the conclusion of the 2009 season.

Nady finished the season with a .256 batting average, 17 home runs and 85 runs batted in. He became a free agent after the end of the season. ===Arizona Diamondbacks=== Nady signed a one-year contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks on December 15, 2010.
