    "text": "Skull Valley Elementary School is a public school in Skull Valley, Arizona, currently offering grades K-6. The school has operated for years with two teachers and generally 20-30 students. Enrollment in 2017 was 14 students. The school district has leased land to the Skull Valley Historical Society, which has a museum next door to the school, and the historical school building itself is a significant historical structure in the area. As of the 2003 census, the population in the Skull Valley Elementary School District was 525 people. ==Historical significance== Although official records do not indicate this, area settlers recall that a school was established in 1878. The school had been formally established by the early 1900s, when it offered education to children in all of the grades. The two-room schoolhouse structure, built in 1925, still stands on the school grounds. Despite extensive consolidations over time in Yavapai County, Arizona, Skull Valley still has a school. The new/current elementary school building sits on the same land, next to the historical schoolhouse. Students above the 6th grade are bused to Prescott to attend middle and high school. ==References== ==External Links== * GreatSchools.net listing Category:1878 establishments in Arizona Territory Category:School districts in Yavapai County, Arizona Category:Schools in Yavapai County, Arizona ",
