She is of Afro-Jamaican and Indo-Jamaican descent. Skye first gained notoriety in her teens when she tagged along with her mother to a music panel held by performance rights organization BMI. During the Q and A, Skye stunned the panel by asking to sing. She performed a cover to Sam Sparro's \"Black and Gold\". == Career == Justine Skye in 2015 Justine got her start at a professional singing career when she performed songs to go with the book \u201cRules To Rock By\u201d. She is known for having made a cover about \"Headlines\" by Drake which received 2 million views on YouTube. In 2012 she released her very first mixtape Skye High. On the mixtape, her song \"Trippin\" got her a significant amount of exposure. She was also known for being Tumblr famous at the time with her then boyfriend Glyn Brown who pursued fashion. They would have meet ups in the New York area in which those who were a part of their fanbase would show up and show support for their events. As she continued on her rise to fame, her debut seven-track EP, Everyday Living, helped her land a deal with Atlantic Records in 2013. Her song \"Hard Work\" landed on BET's 106 & Park Top 10 and she also performed on an episode. She released the album Emotionally Unavailable in 2015. During that time she made the song, produced by DJ Mustard, \"Collide\" that featured the rapper Tyga.

She has also made television appearances including an appearance on the final episode of House of DVF. In 2016 she left Atlantic and signed to Roc Nation and Republic Records. In December 2016, she released her EP 8 Ounces, which featured artists such as Wale.

Her debut album Ultraviolet was released on January 18, 2018. The album featured the singles \"U Don't Know\" (featuring Wizkid), \"Back for More\" (featuring Jeremih) and \"Don't Think About It\".

In October 2018, Skye shared the video for \"Build\" on Instagram with an accompanying message that described an unnamed abuser who hurt her mentally and physically. At the time, Skye explained that she did not reveal her abuser's name because it would not matter to most people. ==Personal life== Along with having a huge following from being \"Tumblr Famous\" and having a song with rapper Tyga, she moved to Los Angeles and met A-list celebrities who later became friends such as Jaden and Willow, as well as Kylie Jenner and Kendall.
