In March 1980, it was released in Germany and the Netherlands with the B-side \"Second That Emotion\", whereas in the UK \"Quiet Life\" was released as the B-side of the unsuccessful \"Second That Emotion\".Assemblage, BMG 2004 CD liner notes Following the commercial success of the band's 1981 album Tin Drum, Hansa Records reissued the song as a single that year to promote the band's upcoming compilation album Assemblage.
