    "text": "The 2018\u201319 NCAA football bowl games were a series of college football bowl games completing the 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The games began on December 15, 2018, and, aside from the all-star games that follow, ended with the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship, which was played on January 7, 2019. The total of 40 team-competitive bowls in FBS, including the national championship game, was unchanged from the previous year. To fill the 78 available bowl slots, a total of 10 teams (13% of all participants) with non-winning records (6\u20136) were invited to bowl games. This was the second consecutive year, and only the third time in eight years, that no teams with losing seasons (6\u20137 or 5\u20137) were invited to fill available bowl berths. Only 39 of the 40 bowls were played, with the First Responder Bowl becoming the first ever postseason game at the FBS-level (or its predecessors) to be cancelled, as a severe lightning storm lingered for over two hours near the Cotton Bowl Stadium. The game was scored as a no-contest for the teams involved. The three all-star games were the East\u2013West Shrine Game and NFLPA Collegiate Bowl, played on January 19, and the Senior Bowl, played on January 26. ==Schedule== The schedule for the 2018\u201319 bowl games is below. All times are EST (UTC\u22125). ===College Football Playoff and Championship Game=== The College Football Playoff system is used to determine a national championship of Division I FBS college football. A 13-member committee of experts ranked the top 25 teams in the nation after each of the last seven weeks. The top four teams in the final ranking play in a single-elimination semifinal round, with the winners advancing to the National Championship game. The semifinal games for the 2018\u201319 season were the Cotton Bowl and the Orange Bowl. Both were played on December 29 as part of a yearly rotation of three pairs of six bowls, commonly referred to as the New Year's Six bowl games. The winners advanced to the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on January 7. Levi's Stadium, site of the National Championship game All games in this table were televised on ESPN. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90% |- !Date !Game !Site !Teams !Affiliations !Results |- |rowspan=3 style=white\u2013space:nowrap|Dec. 29 |Peach Bowl |Mercedes-Benz Stadium Atlanta, Georgia 12:00pm |No. 10 Florida Gators (9\u20133) No. 7 Michigan Wolverines (10\u20132) |SEC Big Ten |Florida 41 Michigan 15 |- |Cotton Bowl Classic (Playoff Semifinal Game) |AT&T; Stadium Arlington, Texas 4:00pm |No. 2 Clemson Tigers (13\u20130) No. 3 Notre Dame Fighting Irish (12\u20130) |ACC Independent |Clemson 30 Notre Dame 3 |- |Orange Bowl (Playoff Semifinal Game) |Hard Rock Stadium Miami Gardens, Florida 8:00pm |No. 1 Alabama Crimson Tide (13\u20130) No. 4 Oklahoma Sooners (12\u20131) |SEC Big 12 |Alabama 45 Oklahoma 34 |- |rowspan=3 style=white\u2013space:nowrap|Jan. 1 |Fiesta Bowl |State Farm Stadium Glendale, Arizona 1:00pm |No. 11 LSU Tigers (9\u20133) No. 8 UCF Knights (12\u20130) |SEC American |LSU 40 UCF 32 |- |Rose Bowl |Rose Bowl Pasadena, California 5:00pm |No. 6 Ohio State Buckeyes (12\u20131) No. 9 Washington Huskies (10\u20133) |Big Ten Pac-12 |Ohio State 28 Washington 23 |- |Sugar Bowl |Mercedes-Benz Superdome New Orleans, Louisiana 8:45pm |No. 15 Texas Longhorns (9\u20134) No. 5 Georgia Bulldogs (11\u20132) |Big 12 SEC |Texas 28 Georgia 21 |- |Jan. 7 |College Football Playoff National Championship (Cotton Bowl winner vs Orange Bowl winner) |Levi's Stadium Santa Clara, California 8:00pm |No. 2 Clemson Tigers (14\u20130) No. 1 Alabama Crimson Tide (14\u20130) |ACC SEC |Clemson 44 Alabama 16 |} ===Non-CFP bowl games=== For the 2018\u201319 bowl season, the Gasparilla Bowl was re-located from Tropicana Field to Raymond James Stadium (which already hosts the Outback Bowl).

The Gator Bowl name was reinstated for the first time since the 2013 season, as it had been known as the TaxSlayer Bowl for the four prior editions. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90% |- !Date !Game !Site !Television !Teams !Affiliations !Results |- |rowspan=5 style=white-space:nowrap|Dec. 15 |Cure Bowl |Camping World Stadium Orlando, Florida 1:30 pm |CBSSN |Tulane Green Wave (6\u20136) Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns (7\u20136) |American Sun Belt |Tulane 41 Louisiana 24 |- |New Mexico Bowl |Dreamstyle Stadium Albuquerque, New Mexico 2:00 pm |ESPN |Utah State Aggies (10\u20132) North Texas Mean Green (9\u20133) |MWC C-USA |Utah State 52 North Texas 13 |- |Las Vegas Bowl |Sam Boyd Stadium Las Vegas, Nevada 3:30 pm |ABC |No. 21 Fresno State Bulldogs (11\u20132) Arizona State Sun Devils (7\u20135) |MWC Pac-12 |Fresno State 31 Arizona State 20 |- |Camellia Bowl |Cramton Bowl Montgomery, Alabama 5:30 pm |ESPN |Georgia Southern Eagles (9\u20133) Eastern Michigan Eagles (7\u20135) |Sun Belt MAC |Georgia Southern 23 Eastern Michigan 21 |- |New Orleans Bowl |Mercedes-Benz Superdome New Orleans, Louisiana 9:00 pm |ESPN |Appalachian State Mountaineers (10\u20132) Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders (8\u20135) |Sun Belt C-USA |Appalachian State 45 Middle Tennessee 13 |- |Dec. 18 |Boca Raton Bowl |FAU Stadium Boca Raton, Florida 7:00 pm |ESPN |UAB Blazers (10\u20133) Northern Illinois Huskies (8\u20135) |C-USA MAC | UAB 37 Northern Illinois 13 |- |Dec. 19 |Frisco Bowl |Toyota Stadium Frisco, Texas 8:00 pm |ESPN |Ohio Bobcats (8\u20134) San Diego State Aztecs (7\u20135) |MAC MWC |Ohio 27 San Diego State 0 |- |Dec. 20 |Gasparilla Bowl |Raymond James Stadium Tampa, Florida 8:00 pm |ESPN |Marshall Thundering Herd (8\u20134) South Florida Bulls (7\u20135) |C-USA American |Marshall 38 South Florida 20 |- |rowspan=\"2\" style=white-space:nowrap|Dec. 21 |Bahamas Bowl |Thomas Robinson Stadium Nassau, Bahamas 12:30 pm |ESPN |FIU Panthers (8\u20134) Toledo Rockets (7\u20135) |C-USA MAC |FIU 35 Toledo 32 |- |Famous Idaho Potato Bowl |Albertsons Stadium Boise, Idaho 4:00 pm |ESPN |BYU Cougars (6\u20136) Western Michigan Broncos (7\u20135) |Independent MAC |BYU 49 Western Michigan 18 |- |rowspan=\"4\" style=white-space:nowrap|Dec. 22 |Birmingham Bowl |Legion Field Birmingham, Alabama 12:00 pm |ESPN |Wake Forest Demon Deacons (6\u20136) Memphis Tigers (8\u20135) |ACC American |Wake Forest 37 Memphis 34 |- |Armed Forces Bowl |Amon G.
