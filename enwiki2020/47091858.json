Ichhenodi basically revolves around a story of two sisters, Meghla and Adrija, and how they entangle themselves in a relationship with their love interest, Anurag. Meghla, who finds the essence of her life in music, is fond of her elder sister Adrija, and loves her above anyone else. The sisters get caught up in a love triangle making their life go upside down. Meghla is proud of her elder sister Adrija as she is a smart, beautiful girl, who is a topper as well when it comes to study. However, Adrija despises her since childhood and hates her after she comes to know that Meghla is not her own sister but adopted. Adrija begins to love Anurag madly but Anurag falls in love with the simple and docile Meghla, and her passion for music. Meghla refuses him and tries to convince him to marry Adrija but circumstances compel them to marry each other. Adrija creates many misunderstandings to destroy the marital life of Meghla and Anurag, but their love conquers every time. Adrija even goes to the extent of trying to kill Meghla on many occasions, but in vain. In frustration, she pushes Anurag from a cliff, who is then saved by Tua, also a passionate singer. Anurag loses his memory in the accident and is named \"Vikram\" by Tua and her family. Tua starts loving Vikram, without knowing his past. Adrija now marries Piklu, Anurag's cousin and enters his family to torture Meghla and makes her life hell by instigating Malobika against her, rendering Meghla responsible for Anurag's supposed death and portrays Meghla as a cheap and characterless girl in the eyes of the family members. A distraught and lonely Meghla finds solace in music and is pacified by her Guru Maa, who turns out to be her own biological mother.

Deep Dasgupta, husband of the real Mallika (who is now dead), promises to help Adrija without knowledge of her true intentions. Soon Meghla gets pregnant and everyone in the family become happy. But their happiness is short-lived as Adrija kills Meghla's unborn baby. A devastated Anurag blames Meghla for everything and asks for a separation. Meghla, unable to bear Anurag's indifference, files for divorce, and soon, their divorce happens. Meghla restarts her singing career, while Deep helps to get Adrija arrested.
