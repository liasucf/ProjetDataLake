    "text": "Zadie Adeline Smith FRSL (born Sadie Adeline Smith; 25 October 1975) is an English novelist, essayist, and short-story writer. Her debut novel, White Teeth (2000), immediately became a best-seller and won a number of awards. She has been a tenured professor in the Creative Writing faculty of New York University since September 2010.\"Zadie Smith to Join NYU Creative Writing Faculty\", NYU, 25 June 2009. ==Early life== Smith was born in Willesden in the north-west London borough of Brent to a Jamaican mother, Yvonne Bailey, and an English father, Harvey Smith,\"Writers: Zadie Smith\", Literature \u2013 British Council. who was 30 years his wife's senior. At the age of 14, she changed her name from Sadie to Zadie. Smith's mother grew up in Jamaica and emigrated to England in 1969. Smith's parents divorced when she was a teenager. She has a half-sister, a half-brother, and two younger brothers (one is the rapper and stand-up comedian Doc Brown, and the other is the rapper Luc Skyz). As a child, Smith was fond of tap dancing, and in her teenage years, she considered a career in musical theatre. While at university, Smith earned money as a jazz singer, and wanted to become a journalist. Despite earlier ambitions, literature emerged as her principal interest. ==Education== Smith attended the local state schools, Malorees Junior School and Hampstead Comprehensive School, and King's College, Cambridge, where she studied English literature. In an interview with The Guardian in 2000, Smith corrected a newspaper assertion that she left Cambridge with a double First. \"Actually, I got a Third in my Part Ones\", she said.Stephanie Merritt, \"She's young, black, British \u2013 and the first publishing sensation of the millennium\", The Observer, 16 January 2000. She graduated with upper second-class honours. Smith seems to have been rejected for a place in the Cambridge Footlights by the popular British comedy double act Mitchell and Webb, while all three were studying at Cambridge University in the 1990s. At Cambridge, Smith published a number of short stories in a collection of new student writing called The Mays Anthology. They attracted the attention of a publisher, who offered her a contract for her first novel. Smith decided to contact a literary agent and was taken on by A. P. Watt. Smith returned to guest-edit the anthology in 2001. ==Career== Smith's d\u00e9but novel White Teeth was introduced to the publishing world in 1997 before it was completed. On the basis of a partial manuscript, an auction for the rights was begun, which was won by Hamish Hamilton. Smith completed White Teeth during her final year at the University of Cambridge. Published in 2000, the novel immediately became a best-seller and received much acclaim. It was praised internationally and won a number of awards, among them the James Tait Black Memorial Prize, and the Betty Trask Award. The novel was adapted for television in 2002. In July 2000, Smith's debut was also the subject for discussion in a controversial essay of literary criticism by James Wood entitled \"Human, All Too Inhuman\", where Wood critiques the novel as part of a contemporary genre of hysterical realism where \"\u2018[i]nformation has become the new character\" and human feeling is absent from contemporary fiction. In an article for The Guardian in October 2001, Smith responded to the criticism by agreeing with the accuracy of the term and that she agreed with Wood's underlying argument that \"any novel that aims at hysteria will now be effortlessly outstripped\". However, she rejected her debut being categorised alongside major authors such as David Foster Wallace, Salman Rushdie, and Don DeLillo and the dismissal of their own innovations on the basis of being hysterical realism. Responding earnestly to Wood's concerns about contemporary literature and culture, Smith describes her own anxieities as a writer and argued that fiction should be \"not a division of head and heart, but the useful employment of both\". Smith served as writer- in-residence at the ICA in London and subsequently published, as editor, an anthology of sex writing, Piece of Flesh, as the culmination of this role. Smith's second novel, The Autograph Man, was published in 2002 and was a commercial success, although it was not as well received by critics as White Teeth. After the publication of The Autograph Man, Smith visited the United States as a Fellow of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University.2002\u20132003 Radcliffe Institute Fellows She started work on a still- unreleased book of essays, The Morality of the Novel (a.k.a. Fail Better), in which she considers a selection of 20th-century writers through the lens of moral philosophy. Some portions of this book presumably appear in the essay collection Changing My Mind, published in November 2009.Jennifer Hodgson, \"Interview with Zadie Smith\", The White Review, Issue 15, December 2015. Smith's third novel, On Beauty, was published in September 2005. It is set largely in and around Greater Boston. It attracted more acclaim than The Autograph Man: it was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, and won the 2006 Orange Prize for Fiction and the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award. Later in the same year, Smith published Martha and Hanwell, a book that pairs two short stories about two troubled characters, originally published in Granta and The New Yorker respectively. Penguin published Martha and Hanwell with a new introduction by the author as part of their pocket series to celebrate their 70th birthday. The first story, \"Martha, Martha\", deals with Smith's familiar themes of race and postcolonial identity, while \"Hanwell in Hell\" is about a man struggling to cope with the death of his wife.Smith, Zadie (2005), Martha and Hanwell. London: Penguin. In December 2008 she guest-edited the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. After teaching fiction at Columbia University School of the Arts, Smith joined New York University as a tenured professor of fiction in 2010.Adrian Versteegh, \"Zadie Smith Joins NYU Creative Writing Faculty\", Poets & Writers, 24 July 2009. Smith's novel NW was published in 2012. It is set in the Kilburn area of north-west London, the title being a reference to the local postcode, NW6. NW was shortlisted for the Royal Society of Literature's Ondaatje Prize and the Women's Prize for Fiction.\"Zadie Smith\" at Rogers, Coleridge & White. NW was made into a BBC television film directed by Saul Dibb and adapted by Rachel Bennette. Starring Nikki Amuka-Bird and Phoebe Fox,Onwuemezi, Natasha, \"Amuka-Bird and Fox to star in NW adaptation\", The Bookseller, 10 June 2016. it was broadcast on BBC Two on 14 November 2016.Meltzer, Tom, \"NW star Nikki Amuka-Bird: 'Zadie is purposefully challenging the viewer'\", The Guardian, 14 November 2016.Lobb, Adrian, \"NW Star Nikki Amuka-Bird Interview: 'Bursting through the glass ceiling can cause damage'\", The Big Issue, 21 November 2016. In 2015 it was announced that Smith, along with her husband Nick Laird, was writing the screenplay for a science fiction movie to be directed by French filmmaker Claire Denis. Smith later said that her involvement had been overstated and that she had simply helped to polish the English dialogue for the film. Smith's fifth novel, Swing Time, was published in November 2016. It drew inspiration from Smith's childhood love of tap dancing. It was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize 2017. Between March and October 2011, Smith was the monthly New Books reviewer for Harper's Magazine. She is also a frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books.ZadieSmith page at The New York Review of Books. In 2010, The Guardian newspaper asked Smith for her \"10 rules for writing fiction\". Among them she declared: \"Tell the truth through whichever veil comes to hand \u2013 but tell it. Resign yourself to the lifelong sadness that comes from never being satisfied.\" Smith's first collection of short stories, Grand Union, was published on 8 October 2019. In 2020 she published six essays in a collection entitled Intimations, the royalties from which she said she would be donating to the Equal Justice Initiative and New York\u2019s COVID-19 emergency relief fund. ==Personal life== Smith met Nick Laird at Cambridge University. They married in 2004 in the Chapel of King's College, Cambridge. Smith dedicated On Beauty to \"my dear Laird\". She also uses his name in passing in White Teeth: \"An' all the good-lookin' men, all the rides like your man Nicky Laird, they're all dead.\"Smith, Zadie (2000). White Teeth. London: Vintage.] The couple lived in Rome, Italy, from November 2006 to 2007, and lived in New York City and Queen's Park, London for about 10 years before relocating to Kilburn, London in 2020. They have two children, Katherine (Kit) and Harvey (Hal). Smith describes herself as \"unreligious\", and was not raised in a religion, although retains a \"curiosity\" about the role religion plays in others' lives. In an essay exploring humanist and existentialist views of death and dying, Smith characterises her worldview as that of a \"sentimental humanist\". ==Bibliography== ===Novels=== * White Teeth (2000) * The Autograph Man (2002) * On Beauty (2005) * NW (2012) * Swing Time (2016) ===Plays=== *The Wife of Willesden (announced in 2019) === Short fiction === ;Collections *\"Martha and Hanwell\" (2005) * Grand Union: Stories (2019) ;StoriesShort stories unless otherwise noted. {|class='wikitable sortable' width='90%' |- !width=25%|Title !|Year !|First published !|Reprinted/collected !|Notes |- |\"Big week\" |2014 | | | |- |\"The Embassy of Cambodia\" |2013 | | | |- |\"Escape from New York\" |2015 | | | |- |\"The girl with bangs\" |2001 | | | |- |\"Hanwell Senior\" |2007 | | | |- |\"The lazy river\" |2017 |The New Yorker | | |- |\"Meet the President!\" |2013 | | | |- |\"Moonlit landscape with bridge\" |2014 | | | |- |\"Now more than ever\" |2018 | | | |- |\"Permission to Enter\" |2012 | | | |- |\"Two men arrive in a village\" |2016 | | | |- |\"The waiter's wife\" |1999 | | | |- |\"Weirdo\" |2021 | | |Written with Nick Laird, illustrated by Magenta Fox |- |} ===Non-fiction=== * Changing My Mind: Occasional Essays (2009) * Stop What You're Doing and Read This!
