The group formed as a duo consisting of Andrew Reissiger and Rob McMaken playing a variety of instruments from cultures across the globe. The group's most recent album Sticks and Stones features New Orleans-to-Athens transplant Louis Romanos (percussion) and Chris Enghauser (bass). Instruments utilized include the Bolivian charango, the Turkish cumbus, the Appalachian dulcimer, mandolin, and guitar. The duo have also been frequent collaborators with North Carolina-based singer-songwriter Jonathan Byrd. Together they recorded The Sea and The Sky, an album of songs Byrd wrote inspired by a band. == Discography == * Artifact (2001) * Live from the Make Believe (2003) * Dromedary Quartet (2006) * Sticks and Stones (2008) === with Jonathan Byrd === * The Sea and The Sky (2004, Waterbug) * This Is The New That (2007, Waterbug) == Further reading == * Budd Kopman, \"Quartet\", All About Jazz, August 15, 2006 * \"Dromedary Expands to a Quartet and Presents New Album\", World Music Central, August 12, 2006 * Mike Joyce, \"Jonathan Byrd & Dromedary - The Sea & the Sky, (Waterbug), Andrew McKnight - Beyond Borders (Falling Mountain)\" (reviews), The Washington Post, February 25, 2005, p.WE08 *Liz Carlisle, \"The Best New Folk of Summer 2004: Part II: The intellectuals\" (CD review), The Harvard Independent, October 7, 2004 *Matt Watroba, \"Jonathan Byrd & Dromedary: forces of nature\", Sing Out!, 48:3, Fall 2004 (link--requires subscription to highbeam.com) *Francois Couture, [ \"Review: Live from the Make Believe], , Allmusic, 2003 *Francois Couture, [ \"Review: Artifact], , Allmusic *Matt Hutchinson, \"We are not the world: Athens duo Dromedary breathes American life into international flavors\", CreativeLoafing.com, October 30, 2003 *Daniel Arizona, \"Splendid reviews: Dromedary - Artifact\", Splendid, January 21, 2002 *Carool Kersten, \"Review: Dromedary - Artifact\", Rambles, January 25, 2003 == External links == * Dromedary, official web site * Dromedary at MySpace * [ Dromedary] at Allmusic Category:American folk musical groups Category:Musical groups from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:American world music groups Category:2001 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Musicians from Athens, Georgia Category:Musical groups established in 2001 ",
