    "text": "Rudolph (1320 - 26 August 1346), called the Valiant (le Vaillant), was the Duke of Lorraine from 1328 to his death. He was the son and successor of Frederick IV and Elisabeth, daughter of Albert I of Germany. Though he was but nine years of age when his father died and he succeeded to the duchy under the regency of his mother (until 1334), he was a warrior prince, taking part in four separate wars in Lorraine, France, Brittany, and Iberia. He was killed at the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy. In 1337, Count Henry IV of Bar refused to do homage for a few seignories he held of the duke. Rudolph was forced to devastate Pont-\u00e0- Mousson and its environs. In a series of reprisals, Henry ravaged the west of Lorraine and Rudolph attacked the Barrois. Only by the intervention of Philip VI of France was the war ended. By that time, the ties of Lorraine to France had become very strong. They were to become stronger under the half-Habsburg Rudolph. His second marriage was to the daughter of a French lord, Guy I of Blois, and niece of the king of France. He also assisted Philip with troops to lift Edward III of England's Siege of Tournai (1340) in the opening phase of the Hundred Years' War. During a brief Anglo-French peace, he journeyed to the Iberian Peninsula to aid Alfonso XI of Castile in the Reconquista. He battled the Moors of Granada and shone in the Battle of Gibraltar on 3 November 1340. On his return to France, he came to the aid of his French brother-in-law, Charles of Blois, in the War of the Breton Succession. He returned to Philip's side at the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy and was killed there, along with many illustrious French cavaliers, on 26 August 1346. His first wife was Eleanor (Ali\u00e9nor), daughter of Edward I of Bar, and Mary of Burgundy. Their marriage took place at Pont-\u00e0-Mousson in 1329, but they had no children before Eleanor's death in 1332. He was remarried to Mary (1323\u20131380), daughter of the aforementioned Guy and Margaret of Valois, Countess of Blois, the sister of King Philip. They had three children: *twins (died before 31 July 1343) *John (1346\u20131390), his successor ==See also== * Dukes of Lorraine family tree ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:Dukes of Lorraine Category:People of the Hundred Years' War Category:French military personnel killed in action Category:People of the Reconquista Category:Medieval child rulers Category:1320 births Category:1346 deaths Category:Male Shakespearean characters ",
