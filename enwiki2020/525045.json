    "text": "Map of Oslofjord The Oslofjord (, ; ) is an inlet in the south-east of Norway, stretching from an imaginary line between the and lighthouses and down to in the south to Oslo in the north. It is part of the Skagerrak strait, connecting the North Sea and the Kattegat sea area, which leads to the Baltic Sea. The Oslofjord is not a fjord in the geological sense \u2014 in Norwegian the term can refer to a wide range of waterways. The bay is divided into the inner () and outer () Oslofjord at the point of the Dr\u00f8bak Sound. Summer houses in the Oslofjord ==Name== In the period 1624\u20131925 the name of the fjord was (or ), since Christiania was the name of the capital in this period. The old Norse name of the fjord was , giving names to the counties of Vestfold ('the district west of Fold') and \u00d8stfold ('the district east of Fold') \u2014 and also the district Follo. ==Geography== Each of the islands in the innermost part of the fjord has its own identity and distinguishing history. Among them are Hoved\u00f8ya, Lind\u00f8ya, Nakholmen, Bleik\u00f8ya, Gressholmen, and Lang\u00f8yene. These islands can be reached with the Oslo-boats from Aker Brygge. Hoved\u00f8ya contains monastery ruins, Gressholmen for its rabbits, Nakholmen, Bleik\u00f8ya, Lind\u00f8ya for their cosy cabins at the water's edge, and finally Lang\u00f8yene for its camping possibilities and beach. The inner part of the Oslofjord has steep and forest covered hill slopes down towards the fjord. ===Climate=== Satellite image by Sentinel-2 The Oslofjord has Norway's highest all year temperature: 7.5 degrees Celsius. February is the coldest month in the fjord with -1.3 degrees Celsius, while July normally has 17.2 degrees Celsius. The islands in the middle of the fjord are among Norway's warmest with high summer temperatures and moderate winters. Oslofjord's relatively high temperatures enable various flora to flourish. ==History== The oldest settlements in the area surrounding the Oslofjord date from the Stone Age and the Bronze Age. It was here on the eastern and western shores that three of the best preserved Viking ships were unearthed. In historical times, this bay was known by the current name of the region, Viken (the bay). Oslofjord has been an important body of water strategically due to its proximity to Oslo. During WWII, there were German installations at several points on its coastline. One installation in Hoved\u00f8ya held 1,100 Wehrmacht soldiers and later women deemed Nazi collaborators at the National Internment Camp for Women in Hoved\u00f8ya. Norwegian painter Edvard Munch had a cottage and studio in \u00c5sg\u00e5rdstrand on the fjord and the Oslofjord appears in several of his paintings, including The Scream and Girls on the Pier. ==Second World War== German cruiser Bl\u00fccher The fjord was the scene of a key event in the German invasion of Norway in April 1940, the Battle of Dr\u00f8bak Sound. The invasion plan envisaged landing of 1,000 troops transported by ship to Oslo. Colonel Eriksen, Commander of the Oscarsborg fortress near Dr\u00f8bak, mainly maintained for historical purposes, sank the German heavy cruiser Bl\u00fccher in the Dr\u00f8bak narrows. The fortress's resistance blocked the route to Oslo, thus delaying the rest of the invading group long enough for the Norwegian royal family, government, parliament, and national treasury to evacuate. Thus Norway never surrendered to the Germans, leaving the Quisling government illegitimate and permitting Norway to participate as an ally in the war, rather than as a conquered nation.

North is to the left ==Demographics== The entire population situated around the Oslofjord including Oslo is about 1.96 million, and the total population of all the counties situated around the fjord is approximately 2.2 million. More than 40% of Norway's population resides under 45 minutes of driving from the Oslofjord. The Oslofjord has Norway's busiest traffic of ferries and cargo boats. Although the Oslofjord contains hundreds of populated islands, most of the population of the fjord resides on the mainland. ==Recreation== In the summer there are boats of all sizes on the fjord, and it is possible to go kayaking, canoeing, fishing, and sailing. The Oslofjord is one of the nine venues of the Class 1 World Powerboat Championship. ==Image gallery== File:Oslofjord Holmenkollen 2008.jpg|Oslofjord seen from Holmenkollen.
