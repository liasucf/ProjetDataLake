    "text": "The Connachta are a group of medieval Irish dynasties who claimed descent from the legendary High King Conn C\u00e9tchathach (Conn of the Hundred Battles). The modern western province of Connacht (Irish C\u00faige Chonnacht, province, literally \"fifth\", of the Connachta) takes its name from them, although the territories of the Connachta also included at various times parts of southern and western Ulster and northern Leinster. Their traditional capital was Cruachan (modern Rathcroghan, County Roscommon).The Oxford Companion to Irish History, p.111, Oxford University Press, 1998. . Early peoples and kingdoms of Ireland, c.800 ==Origins== The use of the word c\u00faige, earlier c\u00f3iced, literally \"fifth\", to denote a province indicates the existence of a pentarchy in prehistory, whose members are believed to have been population groups the Connachta,Francis J. Byrne, Irish Kings and High Kings, Four Courts Press, 2001, p. 86 the Ulaid (Ulster) and the Laigin (Leinster), the region of Mumu (Munster), and the central kingdom of Mide. This pentarchy appears to have been broken up by the dawn of history in the early 5th century with the reduction of the Ulaid and the founding of new Connachta dynasties which expanded north and east. Medieval Irish historical tradition traces these dynasties to the four or five sons of Eochaid Mugmedon: Brion, Ailill, Fiachrae, Fergus Caech (perhaps a literary addition), and Niall of the Nine Hostages. Four were ancestors of new Irish dynasties; those of Bri\u00f3n (the U\u00ed Bri\u00fain), Fiachrae (the U\u00ed Fiachrach) and Ailill (the U\u00ed Ailello, later replaced by U\u00ed MaineByrne, Francis John, Irish Kings and High-Kings. Batsford, London, 1973. ) were known as te\u00f3ra Connachta, or the historical Three Connachta of the province itself; that of Niall, the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, at first surpassed its parent dynasty, establishing or continuing the so-called High Kingship of Ireland at Tara, and became the most powerful dynasty in Ireland down to early modern times. However David Sproule points out that: > It does not seem that the word \"Connacht\" can originally have meant 'the > descendants of Conn'; it may have meant 'headship' or 'supremacy' from > \"cond\" or \"conn\", head, and later have been interpreted as meaning \"the > descendants of Conn\", Conn Cetchathach being derived from the word > \"Connacht\" rather than vice versa. ... the name \"Eoganacht\" and \"Ciannacht\" > were formed in imitation ...David Sproule, Origins of the Eoghnachta, , Eiru > 35, 1984, pp. 31\u201337. Sproule's hypothesis has been accepted by historians such as Paul Byrne.Paul Byrne, Ciannachta Breg before Sil nAeda Slaine, in Seanchas:Studies in Early and Medieval Irish Archaeology, History and Literature in Honour of Francis John Byrne, (Four Courts Press, Dublin, 2000), pp. 121\u2013126. The dynasties of the Airg\u00edalla, and through them the U\u00ed Maine, while also counted as belonging to the Connachta by medieval genealogists,Byrne 2001, pp. 46, 85\u201386D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, \"Ireland, 400\u2013800\", in D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn (ed.), A New History of Ireland Vol 1, 2005, pp. 182\u2013234 may not possibly be related, as some have assessed that they descend from other peoples later added to the genealogical scheme.Francis J. Byrne, Irish Kings and High Kings, Four Courts Press, 2001. Regardless, the connections to U\u00ed Maine with each of the septs and their defined ancestor have been maintained for well over a millennium. ==The Connachta in the Ulster Cycle== In the sagas of the Ulster Cycle, the Connachta, ruled from Cruachan by their king Ailill mac M\u00e1ta and their formidable queen Medb, are the enemies of the Ulaid, ruled from Emain Macha (Navan Fort, County Armagh) by Conchobar mac Nessa, and their wars, notably the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge (cattle raid of Cooley), are the setting for most of the stories. These sagas are traditionally set around the time of Christ, which creates an apparent anachronism: the Connachta are supposedly named after Conn C\u00e9tchathach, who in the usual chronological scheme established by the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, lived in the 2nd century AD.R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 331-333 Later texts used the supposedly earlier names of C\u00f3iced Ol nEchmacht (the province of the Fir \u00d3l n\u00c9cmacht, an ancient people of Connacht) and C\u00f3iced Genaind (the province of Genann, a legendary king of the Fir Bolg)Margaret C. Dobs (ed. & trans.), \"La Bataille de Leitir Ruibhe\", Revue Celtique 39, 1922, pp. 1\u201332 for the western province to get around this difficulty. However, the saga tradition is older than the chronological scheme, which is an artificial attempt by Christian monks to synchronise native traditions with classical and biblical history, and it is possible that the Ulster Cycle is based on historical wars between the Ulaid and the Connachta which have been chronologically misplaced.Byrne 2001, p. 50-51. Kenneth H. Jackson estimated that Ulster heroic saga originated in the 4th century.Kenneth Hurlstone Jackson, The Oldest Irish Tradition: a Window on the Iron Age, Cambridge University Press, 1964 ==Connachta family tree== ==See also== *Kings of Connacht *S\u00edol Muireadaigh *Cen\u00e9l Conaill *Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain *Irish nobility *Irish royal families ==References== ==External links== * R-M222 Haplogroup Project at Family Tree DNA Category:Medieval Irish people Category:Gaelic-Irish nations and dynasties Category:Ulster Cycle ",
