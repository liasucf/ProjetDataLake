    "text": "Ellen Muriel Deason (30 August 1919 \u2013 16 July 2012), known professionally as Kitty Wells, was an American pioneering female country music singer. She broke down a barrier to women in country music with her 1952 hit recording \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\", which also made her the first female country singer to top the U.S. country charts and turned her into the first female country superstar. \u201cIt Wasn\u2019t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\u201d would also be her first of several pop crossover hits. Wells is the only artist to be awarded top female vocalist awards for 14 consecutive years. Her chart- topping hits continued until the mid 1960s, paving the way for and inspiring a long list of female country singers who came to prominence in the 1960s. Wells ranks as the sixth most successful female vocalist in the history of the Billboard country charts, according to historian Joel Whitburn's book The Top 40 Country Hits. In 1976, she was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In 1991, Wells became the third country music artist, after Roy Acuff and Hank Williams, and the eighth woman to receive the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Wells' success and influence on country music garnered her the title \"Queen of Country Music\". ==Biography== ===Early life=== Wells was born Ellen Muriel Deason on 30 August 1919, one of six siblings, to Charles Cary Deason and his wife, Myrtle, in Nashville, Tennessee. (She is one of the few well known country performers to have been born in Nashville.) Wells began singing as a child, learning guitar from her father, who was a brakeman on the Tennessee Central Railroad. Her father, Charles, and his brother were musicians, and her mother, Myrtle, was a gospel singer. As a teenager, Wells sang with her sisters, who performed under the name the Deason Sisters, on a local radio station beginning in 1936.Brian Mansfield & Stephen Thomas Erlewine [ Kitty Wells biography], Allmusic.com; retrieved June 12, 2008. At the age of 18 Wells married Johnnie Wright, a cabinetmaker who aspired to country music stardom (which he would eventually achieve as half of the duo Johnnie & Jack).Wolff, Kurt (2000). In Country Music: The Rough Guide. Orla Duane, Editor. London: Rough Guides Ltd. p. 154. ===Music career=== Wells sang with Wright and his sister Louise Wright; the three toured as Johnnie Right and the Harmony Girls. Soon Wright met Jack Anglin (who married Johnnie's sister Louise) and they became the duo Johnnie & Jack. Their band became known first as the Tennessee Hillbillies and then the Tennessee Mountain Boys. It was at this time Wells adopted \"Kitty Wells\" as her stage name. Johnnie Wright chose the name from a folk song called \"Sweet Kitty Wells\". Wells would tour with the pair, occasionally performing backup vocals. Before Wells' rise to stardom with \"Honky Tonk Angels\", Roy Acuff and the Smoky Mountain Boys toured with Wright and Wells for a time. Acuff advised Wright not to make his wife his show's headliner because he thought women could not sell country music records. On Louisiana Hayride, Wells performed with her husband's duo. Wells, however, did not sing on their records until signing with RCA Victor in 1949, releasing some of her first singles, including \"Death At The Bar\" and \"Don't Wait For The Last Minute To Pray\", neither of which charted. While these early records gained some notice, promoters still weren't keen on promoting female singers, and therefore Wells was dropped from the label in 1950. ====1952: \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\"==== In 1952, Paul Cohen, an executive at Decca Records, approached Wells to record \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\". Wells was disenchanted with her career prospects and was considering retirement, but agreed to the session (at Owen Bradley's studio on 3 May 1952) because of the $125 union scale recording payment. \"I wasn't expecting to make a hit,\" said Wells later. \"I just thought it was another song.\" \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\" was an answer song to Hank Thompson's \"The Wild Side of Life\" and its lyrical treatment of seductive, wayward women. Wells' single retorted, \"It's a shame that all the blame is on us women.\" The record's message was controversial at the time and was banned by many radio stations.Country Music Television.com Kitty Wells profile, CMT.com; retrieved June 13, 2008. NBC, in particular, was troubled by the lyric, \"It brings back memories of when I was a trustful wife\". Wells' slight alteration of \"trustful\" to \"trusting\" lifted the network ban on the song. It was temporarily banned from the Grand Ole Opry. Nevertheless, audiences couldn't get enough of it. The single took off during the summer of 1952 and sold more than 800,000 copies in its initial release. It was the first single by a female singer to peak at No. 1 in the eight-year history of the country music chart, where it remained for six weeks. (Certain female country songs, notably Patsy Montana's million-selling \"I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart\", predate the creation of Billboard's country chart in 1944.) \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\" also crossed over to Billboard's pop charts, hitting No. 27.Kitty Wells' story Wells' Country Music Hall of Fame profile ; retrieved June 12, 2008. Thanks to her breakthrough, Wells received a membership to the Grand Ole Opry, which had originally banned the single. Writer Bill Friskics-Warren has argued that part of the song's appeal came from its combination of a modern message with a familiar tune, a melody drawn from the Carter Family's \"I'm Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes\" (as were \"The Wild Side of Life\" and Roy Acuff's \"The Great Speckled Bird\"). Practically anyone could hum along with \"Angels\" the first time they heard it.All of those lyrics use essentially the same tune. ====1953\u20131969: Career peak==== Ad featuring Kitty Wells and husband Johnnie Wright's first joint album, We'll Stick Together \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\" was followed by \"Paying For That Back Street Affair\", a response to Webb Pierce's \"Back Street Affair\". The single reached No. 6 in the spring of 1953, helping to establish a lasting place at the top of the charts for Wells. Between 1953 and 1955, Wells was popular on the country charts and was the only female solo artist at the time to be able to maintain her success. In 1953, Wells had two Top 10 hits with \"Hey Joe\" and \"Cheatin's A Sin\". The next year, Wells partnered with country star Red Foley for the duet \"One By One\", which peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Chart and became her second chart-topper. The song led to a string of hit singles from the duo within the next two decades, including 1954's \"As Long as I Live\", which peaked at No. 3\\. As a solo artist in 1954, Wells had two major hits with the No. 8 \"Release Me\" and the Top 15 hit \"Thou Shalt Not Steal\" (written by Don Everly of the Everly Brothers). Record companies were reluctant to issue albums by country's female artists until Wells proved that women could sell.(2006). In Will the Circle be Unbroken: Country Music in America. Paul Kingsbury & Alanna Nash, Editos. New York, NY: Dorling Kindersley. p. 182. She became the first female country singer to issue an LP, starting with 1956's Kitty Wells' Country Hit Parade, which consisted of her biggest hits. Wells released her first studio album in 1957 with Winner of Your Heart. Soon other female country singers released LPs in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\"Making Believe\" and \"Lonely Side of Town\" became chart-toppersElizabeth Wenning Biography, musicianguide.com; retrieved June 12, 2008. for Wells, however not on Billboard magazine. Wells' later 1950s releases included \"Searching (For Someone Like You)\", \"I Can't Stop Loving You\", and \"Amigo's Guitar\", which she wrote with John D. Loudermilk. In 1957, Wells issued Winner of Your Heart. This was followed by a string of LPs released by Decca Records between 1957 and 1973. She also partnered with Webb Pierce the same year for two duet singles, including the Top 10 hit \"Oh So Many Years\". The duo didn't record together again until 1964 with the Top 10 hit \"Finally\". In 1959, Wells had two Top 5 hits with \"Amigo's Guitar\" and \"Mommy For A Day\". Wells was later awarded a BMI award for writing \"Amigo's Guitar.\" Although not known much for her songwriting, Wells has won two BMI awards, including one for \"Amigo's Guitar\". She has published more than 60 songs. Wells' 1956 LP album, Country Hit Parade. She was the first female country singer to release an LP of her own. Wells continued to put much of herself into her songs throughout her career, inspiring other female country singers to record risky material as well. Loretta Lynn was one of her followers in this sense when she recorded \"Don't Come Home A Drinkin' (With Lovin' On Your Mind)\" in 1967. Dolly Parton's 1968 recording \"Just Because I'm a Woman\", like \"Honky Tonk Angels\", questioned the male-female double standard. Wells entered the 1960s on top with songs like \"Heartbreak U.S.A.\" and \"Day into Night\". \"Heartbreak USA\" peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Country Chart and became her third and final No. 1 hit. The follow-up, \"Day Into Night\", was a Top 10 hit the same year. Owen Bradley continues as Wells' producer in the 1960s. Bradley produced some of the biggest-selling country crossover singers of the time period. The well-known Nashville Sound vocal group The Jordanaires can be heard backing Wells on her big country hit from 1961 \"Heartbreak USA\". In the early '60s, Wells continued to have Top 10 hits frequently.Country Music Television'.com Kitty Wells profile retrieved 6-13-08 In 1962, Wells had three Top 10 hits with \"Will Your Lawyer Talk to God\", \"Unloved Wanted\", and \"We Missed You\". Beginning in 1964, Wells' albums began to chart the Top Country Albums chart, starting with the LP Especially for You. Some of Wells' albums peaked within the Top 10 on that chart. That same year, Wells' singles began to return to the Top 10 with \"This White Circle on My Finger\" and \"Password\", both of which peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Country Chart. In 1965, Wells had her last Top 10 hit with \"Meanwhile, Down At Joe's\" and in 1966, Wells then had her final Top 20 hit with \"It's All Over But the Crying\", which peaked at No. 14 on the country charts.1965) During the late 1960s and 1970s, Wells managed to have a string of minor hits and remained a popular concert attraction.Yahoo.com Kitty Wells page; retrieved June 13, 2008. She continued with a string of Top 40 hits nearly until the end of the decade with her last Top 40 single, \"My Big Truck Drivin' Man\", in 1968. In 1968, Wells recorded a duet album with husband Johnnie Wright called We'll Stick Together. Wells also reunited with Red Foley at the end of the decade for a studio album. Her albums continued to chart the Top Country Albums chart until 1969 with Guilty Street. Wells became the first female country star to have her own syndicated television show, with her husband in 1969, The Kitty Wells/Johnnie Wright Family Show, which also featured appearances by their children, including actor Bobby Wright. However, the program could not compete against shows starring more contemporary male artists like Porter Wagoner and Bill Anderson and only ran for one year. ====1970\u20132012: Later career and retirement==== Wells stayed under the Decca label until 1973. She released three studio albums in 1970 and two in 1971. In 1973, when Decca became MCA Records, Wells stayed with them for a short time before leaving the label. In 1974, she signed with Capricorn Records, a southern rock label of the era, and recorded a blues-flavored album entitled Forever Young on which she was backed by members of the Allman Brothers Band and the Marshall Tucker Band. The album received considerable acclaim and, through its association with the Allmans, brought Wells to the attention of a younger audience.
