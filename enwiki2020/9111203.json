    "text": "Mairie de Montrouge () is a station of the Paris M\u00e9tro on line 4 situated in Montrouge. The station serves as the southern terminus of Paris M\u00e9tro Line 4 and is the first new station of Line 4 in almost one hundred years, and is part of a two phase southward extension towards Bagneux. ==Location== The station is located in Montrouge under the Avenue de la Republique, between Rue Gabriel-P\u00e9ri and the Place du Marechal-Leclerc. ==History== Line 4 was one of a few Metro lines that was never extended beyond the Parisian city limits, though an initial extension towards La Vache-Noire was originally planned (but was never carried out). Nearly a century after the line's opening, construction of the Montrouge extension commenced, with the new Mairie de Montrouge station opening to passengers on 23 March 2013. It is the first stage of an extension of Line 4 to Bagneux (planned for 2021), which has been planned since 1929 via a different route. In 2004, the cost of the first section was estimated at \u20ac152 million for a length of 780 meters. Subsequently, the line will reach the future Barbara metro station between the Cimeti\u00e8re parisien de Bagneux and the Montrouge fort, then the future Bagneux- Lucie Aubrac terminus to the north of the commune. In 2018, 7,081,319 passengers passed through the metro station placing it in 45th position for usage of all 302 stations. ===Inauguration=== The station was inaugurated on 23 March 23, 2013 by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cuvillier, Minister Delegate for Transport and Maritime Economy, Jean-Paul Huchon, President of the Regional Council of \u00cele- de-France and President of the Union Transportation Union -de-France (STIF), Patrick Devedjian, Chairman of the General Council of Hauts-de-Seine, Jean- Loup Metton, Mayor of Montrouge, and Pierre Mongin, President and CEO of RATP. The station, the 302nd in the Paris metro, was put into service the same day. ==Passenger services== ===Access=== The station has three entrances: * a main lift access located on the forecourt of the Saint-Jacques church, on the corner of Rue Gabriel-P\u00e9ri and Avenue de la R\u00e9publique, facing the town hall; * a northern entrance located on the forecourt of the cultural centre, Place \u00c9mile-Cresp, on the corner of Rue Gabriel-P\u00e9ri and Avenue de la Republique, facing the town hall; this entrance opened in 2014; * a south entrance on the Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-Leclerc. ===Station layout=== {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|Street Level |} {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;border-top:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|B1 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|Mezzanine for platform connection |} {| border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 rowspan=4 valign=top|P Platforms |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=150|Platform |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=390|\u2190 20px link=Paris M\u00e9tro Line 4 toward Porte de Clignancourt |- |Platform | 20px link=Paris M\u00e9tro Line 4 termination platform \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border- bottom:solid 1px gray;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |} ===Platforms=== Mairie de Montrouge is a standard configuration station. It has two platforms separated by metro tracks and the roof is elliptical (rare case for the stations built in recent decades).
