    "text": "North Carolina Highway 121 (NC 121) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The highway travels through a short portion of northern Greene County and western Pitt County between the U.S. Route 264 (US 264) freeway at its exit 60 and NC 43 in the unincorporated community of Bruce. Though it is signed as a north\u2013south highway, the overall length of the route travels more east\u2013west. ==Route description== NC 121 begins at a partial interchange with US 264, also known as the John P. East Memorial Highway, in northeastern Greene County. The interchange only provides access from US 264 eastbound to NC 121 and from NC 121 southbound to US 264 westbound. This portion of the road is located near the community of Fieldsboro and northeast of the town of Walstonburg. The road heads southeast and almost immediately comes to an intersection with US 264 Alternate (US 264 Alt.), the former routing of US 264 through the area. The two highways form a concurrency near the Greene\u2013Pitt county line. Just before the highway crosses into Pitt County, the concurrency ends and NC 121 heads northeast towards Farmville. Now in Pitt County, NC 121 travels east across farmlands west of the town limits of Farmville. Upon entering the town, the name of the road becomes West Wilson Street and the highway reaches US 258 Business (US 258 Bus.) at May Boulevard and Turnage Street. Another concurrency is formed as the two routes travel along West Wilson Street to the central business district of Farmville. At the intersection of Wilson and Main streets, US 258 Bus. heads southwest along South Main Street while NC 121 heads northeast along North Main Street; East Wilson Street continues southeast as an unnumbered road. NC 121 exits the town and passes over US 258 and US 264 without an interchange. Farmland and small homes line the highway as it passes through the communities of Joyners Crossroads and California. After passing through California, NC 121 cuts through farmland with small swaths of forest before it ends at NC 43 in Bruce, a small settlement between Greenville and Falkland. ==Junction list== ==References== 121 Category:Transportation in Greene County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Pitt County, North Carolina ",
