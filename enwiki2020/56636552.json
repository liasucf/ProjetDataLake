    "text": "HackRF One is a wide band software defined radio (SDR) half-duplex transceiver created and manufactured by Great Scott Gadgets. Its creator, Michael Ossman, launched a successful KickStarter campaign in 2014 with a first run of the project called HackRF (Project Jawbone). The hardware and software's open source nature has attracted hackers, amateur radio enthusiasts, and information security practitioners. The HackRF One PCB by Great Scott Gadgets == Overview == The HackRF One is capable of receiving and transmitting on a frequency range of 1MHz to 6GHz with output power of 30 mW to 1 mW depending on the band. The unit comes with an SMA antenna port, CLKIN/CLKOUT SMA ports and a 2.0 USB port. The HackRF One integrates with GNU Radio and SDR# projects to provide its graphical user interface. The popularity of HackRF One as a security research platform has made it featured in many information security conference talks such as BlackHat, DEF CON and BSides. == Academic research == Kimmo Hein\u00e4aro presented a paper at the 2015 International Conference on Military Communications and Information Systems (ICMCIS) outlining how military tactical communications could be hacked with HackRF One and other open source tools. In 2017, researchers were able to use HackRF One in a GPS spoofing attack to feed a vehicle false signals and mapping data to deliver the occupants to a desired location. == Media attention == The HackRF One has received criticism in several media reports because it can be used to intercept the key fob signals to open car doors. ==External Links== * HackRF One on Great Scott Gadgets ==References== Category:Software-defined radio ",
