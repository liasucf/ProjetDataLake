    "text": "Ioannis Frangoudis (; 1863 \u2013 19 October 1916) was a Greek Army officer who reached the rank of Lt General. He also competed in the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens as a shooter. Frangoudis competed in four of the five shooting events as well as serving as secretary of the Sub-Committee for Shooting. He began his sole rifle event, the free rifle, with a lead in the competition after the first string of 10 shots. However, his shooting was inconsistent and his second and fourth strings were far below the scores of his first and third strings. Frangoudis finished second behind Georgios Orfanidis, with 1,312 points to his countryman's 1,583. Viggo Jensen in third place was only 7 points behind Frangoudis. In the rapid fire pistol, Frangoudis was the victor, defeating Orfanidis, along with two other competitors, 344-249. He added another top three finish in the free pistol, behind Sumner Paine (silver medallist in the military pistol) and Holger Nielsen (bronze medallist in the rapid fire pistol). Frangoudis also competed in the military pistol, finishing fourth. Frangoudis is also known for having been present at the assassination of king George I of Greece, and for having taken the king's assassin, Alexandros Schinas, into custody. Frangoudis died in an accident while visiting New York in 1916.
