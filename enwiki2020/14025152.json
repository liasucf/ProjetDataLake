    "text": "In enzymology, a precorrin-6Y C5,15-methyltransferase (decarboxylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + precorrin-6Y \\rightleftharpoons 2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + precorrin-8X + CO2 The conversion of precorrin-6B to precorrin-8 is catalysed by the enzyme CobL in Pseudomonas denitrificans The two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and precorrin 6Y; its three products are S-adenosylhomocysteine, precorrin 8X, and CO2. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L- methionine:1-precorrin-6Y C5,15-methyltransferase (C-12-decarboxylating). Other names in common use include precorrin-6 methyltransferase, precorrin-6Y methylase and CobL. This enzyme is part of the biosynthetic pathway to cobalamin (vitamin B12) in aerobic bacteria. ==See Also== * Cobalamin biosynthesis ==References== * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
