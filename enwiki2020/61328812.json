    "text": "Ang Tong Reachea (1608-1640), also known as Ponhea Nou () or Cau Bana Nu, was the Cambodian king reigned from 1631 to 1640. Ponhea Nou was the second son of Chey Chettha II. He succeeded the throne in 1631. His uncle Outey served as regent, assuming the title uprayorach (\u17a7\u1797\u1799\u17c4\u179a\u17b6\u1787), the title usually borne by kings who had abdicated but retained executive powers. Nou died in mysterious circumstances in June 1640. Although Ponhea Chan should be the next king, Outey forced Chan to give the crown to his own son Batom Reachea. ==References== * Chroniques Royales du Cambodge de 1594 \u00e0 1677. \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame Orient.
