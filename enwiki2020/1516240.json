    "text": "The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Besan\u00e7on (Latin: Archidioecesis Bisuntina; French: Archidioc\u00e8se de Besan\u00e7on) is a Latin Rite Roman Catholic ecclesiastical territory in France. It comprises the d\u00e9partement of Doubs (except for Montb\u00e9liard) and the d\u00e9partement of Haute-Sa\u00f4ne (except for the canton of H\u00e9ricourt). The see is currently sede vacante. From 1034 to 1184, the archbishop had civil authority within the Holy Roman Empire as the prince- archbishop of Besan\u00e7on. He gradually lost his civil power to the town council; the city became the Imperial city of Besan\u00e7on in 1184. The city was annexed by France in stages, eventually being fully subsumed by France in 1792 during the French Revolution. ==Early history of the diocese== A statue of Ferreolus. Local tradition states that the diocese was evangelized by Saints Ferreolus and Ferrutio (Ferr\u00e9ol and Ferjeux), who were sent here by St. Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyon. According to the Catholic encyclopedia, \"Louis Duchesne proved that these legends belong to a chain of narratives forged in the first half of the 6th century and of which the \"passion\" of St. Benignus of Dijon was the initial link.\" During the Middle Ages several popes visited Besan\u00e7on, among them pope Leo IX who consecrated the altar of the old Cathedral of St. Etienne in 1050, and Eugenius III who in 1148 consecrated the church of St. Jean, the new cathedral. A council was held at Besan\u00e7on in 1162, presided over by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, in the interest of the Antipope Victor IV against Pope Alexander III. Guido of Burgundy, who was pope from 1119 to 1123 under the name of Calixtus II, and the Jesuit Claude-Adrien Nonnotte (1711\u20131793), an adversary of Voltaire, were natives of Besan\u00e7on. ==Abbeys founded from the diocese== The monastery of Luxeuil, founded by St. Columbanus (d. 615), gave to the diocese of Besan\u00e7on a series of saints. First came the direct successors of St. Columbanus: the Abbot St. Eustasius who founded a celebrated school in this monastery; the Abbot St. Valbert who sent monks to found the Abbeys of St. Val\u00e9ry, St. Omer, and St. Bertin, and died in 665; the Abbot St. Ingofroid; St. Donatus, who became Bishop of Besan\u00e7on; and St. Ansegisus, author of a celebrated collection of capitularies. The Abbey of Lure (in Haute-Sa\u00f4ne) was founded at the beginning of the 7th century by St. D\u00e9icole (Deicolus), or Desle, disciple of St. Columbanus; later its abbots were princes of the Holy Empire. The Abbey of Beaume les Dames, founded in the 5th century and in which Gontram, King of Burgundy, was buried, was the school where St. Odo, afterwards Abbot of Cluny, studied in the tenth century; at the end of the eighth century there was built near it an abbey for Benedictine nuns, members of the nobility. During the French Revolution the superb church of this abbey was laid waste. Other saints of the Diocese of Besan\u00e7on include the hermit St. Aldegrin (10th century). ==Later history== St. Peter Fourier (1565\u20131640), who inaugurated systematic education for girls, was born in the diocese. The miracle attributed to the \"Sacred Host of Faverney\", during a fire in the year 1608, was annually commemorated by elaborate ceremonies. The places of pilgrimage were Notre Dame du Ch\u00eane at Scey; Notre Dame d'Aigremont; the pilgrimage of St. Pierre of Tarentaise at Cirey-les-Bellevaux, where St. Pierre de Tarentaise died in 1174; Notre Dame des Jacobins at Besan\u00e7on; and Notre Dame de la Motte at Vesoul. Few 19th-century dioceses have undergone similar territorial changes. The Concordat of 1802 gave the Diocese of Besan\u00e7on all those districts which, in 1822, constituted the Diocese of St.-Claude. In 1806, Besan\u00e7on was given jurisdiction over the three parishes of the Principality of Neufch\u00e2tel (Switzerland) which fell under the control of the bishopric of Lausanne in 1814. In 1870, after the annexation of Alsace- Lorraine by Germany, the district of Belfort was withdrawn from the bishopric of Strasburg and attached to the diocese of Besan\u00e7on. The metropolitan jurisdiction of Besan\u00e7on also underwent changes. In 1802 its suffragans were the Bishoprics of Dijon and Autun (in Burgundy), Metz, Nancy and Strasbourg (in Alsace-Lorraine). Under the Bourbon Restoration, Dijon and Autun were withdrawn from Besan\u00e7on, which became the metropolitan of the sees of Saint- Di\u00e9, Verdun and Belley. In 1874, after the Franco-Prussian War, the churches of Metz and Strasburg were exempt, under the direct control of the Holy See. On 3 November 1979, Belfort, Montb\u00e9liard, and the canton of H\u00e9ricourt (Haute- Sa\u00f4ne) were detached from the diocese of Besan\u00e7on and constituted into a new autonomous diocese, that of Belfort-Montb\u00e9liard.Historique \u2014 Dioc\u00e8se de Besan\u00e7on - Eglise Catholique de Besan\u00e7on ==Bishops== ===To 1000=== Saint Claudius served as bishop of Besan\u00e7on during the 7th century.
