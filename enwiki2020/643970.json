It has the option of adding two child seats, installed in the baggage area. Introduced in 1956, the 182 has been produced in a number of variants, including a version with retractable landing gear, and is the second most popular Cessna model still in production, after the 172. ==Development== The Cessna 182 was introduced in 1956 as a tricycle gear variant of the 180. In 1957, the 182A variant was introduced along with the name Skylane. As production continued, later models were improved regularly with features such as a wider fuselage, swept tailfin with rear \"omni-vision\" window, enlarged baggage compartment, higher gross weights, landing gear changes, etc. The \"restart\" aircraft built after 1996 were different in many other details including a different engine, new seating design, etc. By mid-2013 Cessna planned to introduce the next model of the 182T, the JT-A, using the SMA SR305-230 diesel engine running on Jet-A with a burn rate of per hour and cruise at . Cessna has no timeline for the JT-A and the diesel 172. The normally aspirated, avgas fueled 182 went out of production in 2012, but came back in 2015. Cessna 182s were also built in Argentina by DINFIA (called A182), and by Reims Aviation, France, as the F182. ==Design== The Cessna 182 is an all-metal (mostly aluminum alloy) aircraft, although some parts - such as engine cowling nosebowl and wingtips - are made of fiberglass or thermoplastic material. Its wing has the same planform as the smaller Cessna 172 and the larger 205/206 series; however, some wing details such as flap and aileron design are the same as the 172 and are not like the 205/206 components. ===Retractable gear=== The retractable gear R182 and TR182 were offered from 1978 to 1986, without and with engine turbocharging respectively. The model designation nomenclature differs from some other Cessna models with optional retractable gear. For instance the retractable version of the Cessna 172 was designated as the 172RG, whereas the retractable gear version of the Cessna 182 is the R182. Cessna gave the R182 the marketing name of \"Skylane RG\". The R182 and TR182 offer 10-15% improvement in climb and cruise speeds over their fixed gear counterparts or, alternatively, 10-15% better fuel economy at the same speeds at the expense of increased maintenance costs and decreased gear robustness. The 1978 R182 has a sea level climb rate of 1140 fpm and cruising speed (75% BHP) at of 156 KTAS at standard temperature. The landing gear retraction system in the Skylane RG uses hydraulic actuators powered by an electrically driven pump. The system includes a gear position warning that emits an intermittent tone through the cabin speaker when the gear is in the retracted position and either the throttle is reduced below approximately 12\" MAP (manifold pressure) or the flaps are extended beyond 20 degrees. In the event of a hydraulic pump failure, the landing gear may be lowered using a hand pump to pressurize the hydraulic system. The system does not, however, allow the landing gear to be manually retracted. ==Variants== ;182 :Initial production version with fixed landing gear, four-seat light aircraft, powered by a Continental O-470-L piston engine, gross weight and certified on 2 March 1956. ;182A Skylane :Four-seat light aircraft with fixed landing gear, powered by a Continental O-470-L piston engine, gross weight and certified on 7 December 1956. ;182B Skylane :Four-seat light aircraft with fixed landing gear, powered by a Continental O-470-L piston engine, gross weight and certified on 22 August 1958. ;182C Skylane :Four-seat light aircraft with fixed landing gear, powered by a Continental O-470-L piston engine, gross weight and certified on 8 July 1959. ;182D Skylane :Four-seat light aircraft with fixed landing gear, powered by a Continental O-470-L piston engine, gross weight and certified on 14 June 1960. ;182E Skylane :Four-seat light aircraft with fixed landing gear, powered by a Continental O-470-L or O-470-R piston engine, gross weight and certified on 27 June 1961. ;182F Skylane :Four-seat light aircraft with fixed landing gear, powered by a Continental O-470-L or O-470-R piston engine, gross weight and certified on 1 August 1962. ;182G Skylane :Four-seat light aircraft with fixed landing gear, powered by a Continental O-470-L or O-470-R piston engine, gross weight and certified on 19 July 1963. ;182H Skylane :Four-seat light aircraft with fixed landing gear, powered by a Continental O-470-R piston engine, gross weight and certified on 17 September 1964. ;182J Skylane :Four- seat light aircraft with fixed landing gear, powered by a Continental O-470-R piston engine, gross weight and certified on 20 October 1965. ;182K Skylane :Four-seat light aircraft with fixed landing gear, powered by a Continental O-470-R piston engine, gross weight and certified on 3 August 1966. ;182L Skylane :Four-seat light aircraft with fixed landing gear, powered by a Continental O-470-R piston engine, gross weight and certified on 28 July 1967. ;182M Skylane :Four-seat light aircraft with fixed landing gear, powered by a Continental O-470-R piston engine, gross weight and certified on 19 September 1968.
