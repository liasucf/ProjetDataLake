It was built in 1014 during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Song dynasty (960-1279). It is one of the earliest existing stone arch bridges in China. ==History== The bridge was built as \"Qianxian Bridge\" () in 1014, during the Song dynasty (960-1279). In history, Su Shi, Su Zhe, Huang Tingjian, Yang Wanli, Wang Shipeng, Zhu Xi, Wen Tianxiang, Ouyang Xuan, and Tang Yin wrote poems and articles singing about the bridge. In the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), a Buddhist temple named \"Cihang Temple\" () was built in front of the bridge. \"Cihang\" means \"Guanyin\". Therefore, the bridge was called \"Guanyin Bridge\". Guanyin Bridge was inscribed as a provincial cultural relics protection unit in 1959 and was listed among the \"Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Jiangxi\" by the State Council of China. ==Architecture== The bridge is in length, in height, in width and in span. It was made of 107 pieces of granite. The construction time of the bridge is engraved on the deck. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * * Category:Bridges in Jiangxi Category:Arch bridges in China Category:Bridges completed in the 11th century Category:Song dynasty architecture Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1014 Category:Major National Historical and Cultural Sites in Jiangxi Category:1014 establishments in China ",
