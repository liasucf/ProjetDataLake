He is best known for his 2016 International hit single \"Dance For Me\" alongside Mr Eazi, which led to a 2017 MOBO Awards nomination. In 2018, Eugy a record signed with Tinie Tempah's Disturbing London. ==Career== Eugy started writing and recording music at around age 14, having moved to UK from Ghana eight years prior. He originally started as a grime MC although stopped making grime, citing that he 'wasn't good enough, moving more towards afrobeats after being inspired by highlife musicians he grew up listening to such as Daddy Lumba and Kojo Antwi. His career took off after Nigerian artist Davido reached out to him after seeing a freestyle video he posted online. This resulted in a collaboration and the release of Eugy's debut single, \"'Chance\", in 2015. However, his profile increased drastically following the international success of 2016 single \"Dance For Me\" with Mr Eazi, which is considered by some to be 'UK Afrobeats' first bonafide smash'. Following a string of releases, Eugy signed with Disturbing London in April 2018 whilst also supporting Wizkid at the sold out Afrorepublik Show at the O2 Arena. He followed this with the release of \"L.O.V.E\" alongside Ghanaian artist King Promise and his most recent single, \"LoLo\", releasing in March 2019. ==Discography== ===Selected singles=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:100%; text-align: center;\" | As lead artist |- !Year !Title !Album |- |2015 |\"Chance\" (featuring Davido) |rowspan=\"5\" |- |rowspan=\"4\"|2016 |\"Dance For Me\" (with Mr Eazi) |- |\"Body\" (with Mr Eazi) |- |\"Blessing\" |- |\"Don Corleone\" |- |2017 |\"Give It Up To Me\" (featuring Ycee) |rowspan=\"1\" |- |rowspan=\"5\"|2018 |- |\"Tick Tock\" |rowspan=\"5\" |- |\"Complicated\" (with Will Simms) |- |\"L.O.V.E\" (featuring King Promise) |- |\"Can't Deny\" (with Korbz) |- |2019 |\"LoLo\" |- |colspan=\"3\" style=\"font- size:100%; text-align: center;\" | As featured artist |- !Year !Title !Album |- |rowspan=\"9\"|2017 |\"Somebody\" (Mark Asari featuring Eugy & Victizzle) |rowspan=\"1\" |- |\"Right Here\" (Geko featuring Mr Eazi, Maleek Berry & Eugy) |rowspan=\"1\" |- |\"Bad\" (Juls featuring Eugy, Not3s & Kojo Funds) |rowspan=\"1\" |- |\"What's Good?\" (Roadside G's featuring Eugy) |rowspan=\"2\" |- |\"Your Matter\" (Seyi Shay featuring Eugy) |- |\"Innocent\" (P Montana featuring Eugy, Kwamz & Flava) |rowspan=\"1\" |- |\"Kwasia\" (Nonso Amadi featuring Eugy) |rowspan=\"4\" |- |\"Hot Property\" (Team Salut featuring Tion Wayne, Afro B & Eugy) |- |\"Say What You Want\" (Siza featuring Eugy) |- |rowspan=\"8\"|2018 |\"Say Bye Bye\" (Ycee featuring Eugy) |- |\"So Wavy\" (Mystro featuring Eugy) |rowspan=\"1\" |- |\"What's Good\" (Roadside G's featuring Dan Diggerz, Phantom & Eugy) |rowspan=\"1\" |- |\"Gari n Sugar\" (Shirazee featuring Eugy) |rowspan=\"1\" |- |\"Ghana Bounce\" (Ajeibutter22 featuring Mr Eazi & Eugy) |rowspan=\"3\" |- |\"The Way I Like It\" (Romy Rose featuring Eugy) |- |\"Me Gusta\" (Romy Rose featuring Eugy) |- |\"Tout Va Bien (remix)\" (Orelsan featuring Eugy & Kojo Funds) |rowspan=\"1\" |- |rowspan=\"2\"|2019 |\"Kumbaya\" (Atueyii featuring Eugy & Sona) |rowspan=\"1\" |- |\"Rendezvous\" |rowspan=\"1\" |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Notes |- ! scope=\"row\"| Flavourz EP | * Released: 2017 * Format: Digital download |} ==References== Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Ghanaian male singers Category:English musicians Category:English male rappers Category:Rappers from London Category:English people of Ghanaian descent Category:Black British musicians Category:21st-century Ghanaian singers Category:21st-century male singers ",
