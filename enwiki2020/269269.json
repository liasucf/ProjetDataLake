    "text": "Hong Kong Baptist University Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) is a publicly funded tertiary liberal arts institution with a Christian education heritage. It was established as Hong Kong Baptist College with the support of American Baptists, who provided both operating and construction funds and personnel to the school in its early years. It became a public college in 1983. It became Hong Kong Baptist University in 1994 during the presidency of Dr. Daniel Tse Chi-wai, LLD, GBS, CBE, JP, who succeeded the Founding President, Dr. Lam Chi- fung, as the second president of the University in 1971. After 30 years of services to the University, Dr. Daniel Tse Chi-wai retired in 2001 and Prof. Ng Ching-fai, GBS, was appointed as the third president of the University. In 2010, Prof. Albert Chan Sun-chi assumed office as the fourth president of HKBU. In 2015, Prof. Roland Chin was appointed as the fifth President of HKBU. HKBU has five main campuses: Ho Sin Hang Campus (1966), Shaw Campus (1995), Baptist University Road Campus (1998), Kai Tak Campus (2005), and Shek Mun Campus (2006) for the College of International Education and the Hong Kong Baptist University Affiliated School Wong Kam Fai Secondary and Primary School. The first three campuses are located in the urban heart of Kowloon Tsai, while the Kai Tak Campus is located on Kwun Tong Road and the Shek Mun Campus in the Shek Mun area of Sha Tin District. In 2005, the University established the Beijing Normal University \u2013 Hong Kong Baptist University United International College (UIC) in Zhuhai, China. The college was the first tertiary education institution founded through collaboration between a Mainland university and a Hong Kong university. ==History== The Hong Kong Baptist College was opened on 11 September 1956 on the premises of the Pui Ching Middle School, a Baptist-affiliated secondary school, with an initial enrolment of 152 students. In 1957 the government gave the college land on Waterloo Road to build a permanent campus, which was completed in 1966. The Hong Kong Baptist College Bill 1983 was passed by the Legislative Council on 10 August 1983. The college previously fell under the purview of the Post Secondary Colleges Ordinance and received funding from the Education Department. After this bill became law, the college instead began to receive funding from the University and Polytechnic Grants Committee. The third reading of the Hong Kong Baptist College (Amendment) Bill was passed by the Legislative Council on 16 November 1994, transforming the college into the Hong Kong Baptist University. ==University identities== ===Emblem=== The emblem of Hong Kong Baptist University consists of three pictorial elements: the Bible, waves and knots. The Bible symbolises the unique quality of Christian education which includes moral and spiritual training in addition to academic education. The waves, on the other hand, symbolise both Hong Kong's geographic nature as an island while echoing Confucius' dictum that \"the wise love water\" and the University's continuing effort to improve its educational quality. The knots, the final symbol, illustrate that within God's embrace, Christians are harmoniously linked and loved. ===Logo=== The logo, embodying a book and water motifs, was adopted after the institution was granted its university status in 1994. The acronym \"BU\" coupled with the outlined book on the logo resembles the Chinese characters of welcome (\u8fce) and progress (\u9032), conceptualising the merging of eastern and western cultures. The design of the logo was commended at a design competition held in October 1996. The Hong Kong Designers Association awarded a Certificate of Merit at the Design 96 Show to Kan & Lau Design Consultants for creating the logo. == Governance == Prior to Hong Kong's handover, the colony's governor was the de jure chancellor of the university. That role has been assumed by Hong Kong's chief executive following the handover. The chief executive's role as the university's Chancellor is enshrined in the Hong Kong Baptist University Ordinance. For a list of pre- and post-handover university chancellors, refer to the articles for the Governor of Hong Kong and the Chief executive of Hong Kong. ==Academic organisations and rankings== ===Faculties and Schools=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"25%\" | Faculty of Arts ! width=\"25%\" | Faculty of Science ! width=\"25%\" | Faculty of Social Sciences |- |valign=\"top\"| *Department of Chinese Language and Literature *Department of English Language and Literature *Department of Music *Department of Religion and Philosophy *Department of Humanities and Creative Writing *Language Centre *Department of Translation |valign=\"top\"| *Department of Biology *Department of Chemistry *Department of Computer Science *Department of Mathematics *Department of Physics |valign=\"top\"| *Department of Education Studies *Department of Geography *Department of Government and International Studies *Department of History *Department of Sport and Physical Education *Department of Social Work *Department of Sociology |- ! width=\"25%\" |School of Business ! width=\"25%\" |School of Communication ! width=\"25%\" |School of Continuing Education (SCE) |- |valign=\"top\"| *Department of Accountancy and Law *Department of Economics *Department of Finance and Decision Sciences *Department of Management *Department of Marketing |valign=\"top\"| *Academy of Film *Department of Communication Studies *Department of Journalism |valign=\"top\"| *College of International Education (CIE) |- ! width=\"25%\" |Academy of Visual Arts ! width=\"25%\" |School of Chinese Medicine ! width=\"25%\" |Graduate School |} ===Rankings=== According to Times Higher Education World University Rankings (THE), HKBU was ranked 60th of the World University Impact Ranking and 70th of Top 100 Universities of Asia in 2019.

In 1970, on the occasion of their Golden Wedding Anniversary, Dr. and Mrs. Lam donated half a million dollars towards the construction of the auditorium. A local architect, Eric Cumine, took charge of the project. However, Dr. Lam died the following year before the project got underway. The Board of Governors decided to honour Dr. Lam by expanding the planned auditorium into a much larger scale project \u2013 the development of the Lam Chi-fung Memorial Building.
