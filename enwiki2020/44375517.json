This species is endemic to New Zealand, including the Chatham Islands. ==Taxonomy== This species was originally named Scoparia leptalea by Edward Meyrick in 1884. Meyrick gave a description of the species in 1885. John S. Dugdale assigned this species to the genus Eudonia in 1988. However he misspelt the specific epithet leptalaea. ==Description== The wingspan is 16\u201319 mm. The forewings are whitish-ochreous or ochreous-grey, irrorated with dark fuscous or black, and densely irrorated with whitish. The markings are variable in distinctness and may sometimes be almost obsolete. The first line is white, margined by dark posteriorly. The second line is white and margined by dark. The hindwings are whitish-grey. The postmedian line is darker and the hindmargin is suffused with darker grey. Adults have been recorded on wing from January to March. ==References== Category:Moths described in 1884 Category:Scopariinae Category:Endemic fauna of New Zealand Category:Moths of New Zealand Category:Taxa named by Edward Meyrick ",
