    "text": "The Australian Quidditch Association was formed in 2011 and ran its first major tournament in December that year, known as QUAFL, the Australian Quidditch Championships. This was the first tournament of its kind to be played outside of North America, where the sport was founded in 2005. Competitive quidditch is regularly played in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, with smaller competitions played in Western Australia and South Australia. There are currently 25 quidditch clubs registered across the country. ==Organisations== Quidditch in Australia is governed by Quidditch Australia (formerly the Australian Quidditch Association), a non-profit organisation founded in 2011. It is governed by a board of seven directors on a rotating 2-year term system. Quidditch Australia is affiliated with the International Quidditch Association. Australian quidditch adopts the IQA rulebook for official gameplay, with some minor exceptions. Quidditch Australia manages the membership and insurance of all players in the country, in addition to managing the country's most prolific tournaments such as the QUAFL Australian Quidditch Championships and State Shield. Regular club seasons are managed by their respective state bodies: Quidditch NSW, Victorian Quidditch Association, Queensland Association of Quidditch, South Australian Quidditch Association and Western Australian Quidditch Association. ==History== Quidditch Australia began in 2011 as a Facebook group intended to act as a network for quidditch teams and players within Australia to communicate with each other, become aware of local teams and resources, to set up matches, and to set up new teams. The association is run by a board of 7 directors with further volunteer staff. ==National team== The Australian National Team, the \"Drop Bears\", competed at the 2012 Summer Games and the 2014 Global Games, coming third and second respectively. In the biggest upset in the history of international quidditch, the Dropbears defeated the United States 150*\u2013130 to win the 2016 World Cup in Germany. Despite being tipped to win the cup again in 2018, the Australian National Team competed in Italy finishing 5th, defeated by the United States in the early stages of the semi finals. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" !

The first official name for the tournament was the Oceania Regional Championships, but was more affectionately known as \"QUAFL\" or \"QUAFL Cup\", given the reverse acronym \"Quidditch United Australian Federated League\" in jest. The tournament was later renamed to the Australian Quidditch Championships, but is often still referred to as QUAFL. The inaugural tournament was held in 2011 at the University of New South Wales, starting with just 5 teams. Clubs from across the country bid to host the tournament every year, and the tournament was hosted by Sydney-based clubs until 2015 when it was hosted by Melbourne's Monash Muggles. In 2016 and 2017, the tournament saw a move to the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra, and was hosted in Queensland for the first time in 2018. The 2019 tournament is to be held at Kayess Park, Minto. The tournament hosted a record high of 25 teams in 2017. The structure of the tournament traditionally changes each year depending on the number of registered teams and choices of organisers. More recently, teams have been randomly split into pools based on their respective end of season state rankings, with top teams from each pool progressing to elimination bracket play.

Formerly known as a series of \"Triwizard Tournaments\" starting in 2011, state finals were introduced in 2014, and the Quidditch NSW state body and the NSW Quidditch League were formalised in 2015.
