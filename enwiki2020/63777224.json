    "text": "The gens Balonia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. No members of this gens are mentioned in ancient writers, but a number are known from inscriptions. ==Origin== The nomen Balonius belongs to a class of gentilicia formed using the suffix ', originally applied to cognomina ending in ', but later used as a regular gentile-forming suffix, without regard to the orthography of the root. These nomina tended to be of plebeian origin, and were frequently Oscan. Chase suggests that Balonius might be derived from the cognomen Bala, perhaps from Latin balare, \"to bleat\".Chase, pp. 118, 119. The spelling Bellonius, found in a few inscriptions, suggests a possible derivation from Bellona, the goddess of war, although the two forms could also have developed independently. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Balonii were Aulus, Gaius, and Marcus, all of which were common throughout Roman history. Other names used by this gens included Gnaeus and Lucius, which were also common, and Numerius, which was relatively uncommon, and much more distinctive. ==Members== * Balonia, mistress of the slave Philemon, along with Balonius, probably her brother, according to an inscription from Casilinum in Campania, dating to 98 BC.. * Balonius, master of the slave Philemon, along with Balonia, probably his sister, according to an inscription from Casilinum, dating to 98 BC. * Aulus Balonius A. l.
