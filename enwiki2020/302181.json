Kwai Chung was a stream (Chung) that emptied into Gin Drinkers Bay. The whole bay was reclaimed for land and the stream is no longer visible. ==Divisions== Traditionally, Kwai Chung is divided into Upper Kwai Chung or Sheung Kwai Chung (), and Lower Kwai Chung or Ha Kwai Chung (). Administratively, the former is called North Kwai Chung, and the latter South Kwai Chung. ==Economy== Kwai Chung is the home of the principal commercial cargo handling area of Hong Kong, the Kwai Chung Container Terminal, one of the largest and busiest port facilities in the world. The main commercial port was relocated here from Yau Ma Tei in the 1980s, in preparation for the West Kowloon Reclamation, which has left the original waterfront of Yau Ma Tei almost half a mile inland. ==See also== *List of areas of Hong Kong *Public housing estates in Kwai Chung *Hulu Concept, a not-for-profit cultural organisation based in Kwai Chung ==External links== *Satellite view of the container port in Kwai Chung Category:Populated waterside places Category:Port cities and towns in China ",
