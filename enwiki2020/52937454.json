According to most sources, including Abu Shamah, al-Dhahabi, and Ibn Kathir, Qatadah died in Jumada I 617 AH (July 1220). Al-Mundhiri writes that he died in late Jumada II 617 AH (late August 1220), while Ibn al-Athir writes that he died in Jumada II 618 AH (July/August 1221). Historians mention that Hasan killed his father, brother, and uncle in order to gain control the Emirate. Hasan was dethroned in Rabi al-Awwal 619 AH (April/May 1222) by al-Mas'ud Yusuf, the Ayyubid Emir of Yemen. He fled to Damascus, then to Baghdad, where he died in 623 AH (1226). A Shi'ite, Hasan was buried in the mashhad of Musa al-Kazim. ==References== * * * * * Category:1226 deaths Category:13th-century Arabs Category:Patricides Category:People from Mecca Category:Banu Qatadah Category:Year of birth unknown ",
