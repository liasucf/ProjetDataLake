    "text": "The Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) is funded by the Australian federal government to assist newly arrived migrants and refugees with English tuition. Newly arrived migrants and refugees are offered up to 510 hours of free English classes. Childcare is also provided for families with young children during English tuition times so parents can attend classes. People interested in learning English with AMEP should contact their local AMEP centre for an initial interview so they are assessed to be placed in the correct certificate level. The Certificates in Spoken and Written English is used in the AMEP centres to teach English. Distance Learning is also provided for eligible migrants and refugees who live remote areas and cannot attend classes. Another service provided by the AMEP is the Home Tutor Scheme, where AMEP students are matched with a volunteer tutor for English tuition. ==References== Category:Australian migration law Category:Australian English Category:Refugees in Australia ",
