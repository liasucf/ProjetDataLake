He started off playing drums professionally at the age of 16 in the casino showrooms of Atlantic City New Jersey, where he had to be escorted to & from the stage by security guards because he was too young to be in a casino. He eventually ended up touring extensively (as a musician) with Chuck Berry, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Florence Henderson, and Gloria Loring, before re- locating to California and re-inventing himself as a composer & producer. ==References== Steve Hopkins at Internet Movie Database ==External links== * * Category:Living people Category:American television composers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
