A Nimcha is a single-handed sword from north Africa, especially Morocco and Algeria, a type of scimitar or saif. Becoming popular in north Africa during Ottoman presence, surviving nimcha are usually from the late 18th century onward and are notable for often using older blades. Stylistically they often bore Arabian type handles with Ottoman tugrah inscribed on the blade. ==Characteristics== an old depiction of hafsid sultan of tunis holding a nimcha Blades on Nimcha came in a variety of forms, and were often imported from Europe. Always of a single edge variety the two main forms were either a short generally more deeply curved 'cutlass style', or a longer more slender form that sometimes bore a clipped point. Nimcha also have distinct hilts that sport forward pointing quillions, which end in a 'bud' style. The wooden handles are flat sided and squared off at an almost 90 degree \"hooked\" pommel. The blade and hilt are attached by a stud located on the top of the pommel The cross guard will often have a knuckle guard which starts beneath the quillions and runs to the bottom of the pommel in a distinct 'squared off' fashion; on the opposite side of the hilt this path is normally continued into a 3rd quillion. Nimcha were popular both on the land and among sailors. As a result of seafarers this style of sword was popularized in far off southern Arabia, Yemen, and Zanzibar. Each of these areas had Nimchas which varied slightly in design, for example Zanzibari swords have more sharply bent handles, a finger guard shaped like a \"D\", and a turtle shaped cap on the pommel securing the blade and hilt. ==References== == External links == *Photograph of a traditional Nimcha Category:Blade weapons Category:African swords ",
