For this role, she won the Soap Opera Digest Award for Best Actress in 1986 and 1989. She left the show in 1992, although she did return for the final episode of the series in 1993 and for the 1997 miniseries Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac. In 1985, she received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination as host of the Tournament of Roses Parade on CBS. From 2004 to 2005, she starred in the soap opera The Young and the Restless. She reprised her role of Valene in an episode of the new Dallas series in 2013. ==Early life== Van Ark was born in New York City to Dorothy Jean Van Ark (n\u00e9e Hemenway) and Carroll Van Ark (1897\u20131972), an advertiser and public relations consultant from Holland, Michigan, of Dutch ancestry. Carroll Van Ark's paternal grandfather was an immigrant from Holland. Both parents were also writers. She grew up in Boulder, Colorado, with three siblings: Carol, Mark and Dexter. At age 15, as a student reporter, Van Ark met and interviewed actress Julie Harris, who later recommended Van Ark apply to the Yale School of Drama. Harris had been the youngest student to attend the school on scholarship. Van Ark was one of the few students to attend the graduate program without first having earned an undergraduate degree. She attended for only one year. Years later, Harris appeared on Knots Landing as Lilimae Clements, the mother of Valene Ewing, Van Ark's character. ==Career== Van Ark and Howard Duff in Felony Squad (1968) Van Ark began her professional career at the Guthrie Theater in Moli\u00e8re's The Miser, opposite Hume Cronyn and Zoe Caldwell. That was followed by Death of a Salesman at the Guthrie with both Cronyn and Jessica Tandy. After a season at the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., she was then cast in the national touring company of Barefoot in the Park, directed by Mike Nichols. She recreated the role in the critically acclaimed London Company and later on Broadway. She earned a Theatre World AwardTheatre World Award Winners and received a Tony nominationTony Awards nominee details in 1971 for her performance in The School for Wives. Van Ark starred opposite Ray Milland and Sam Elliott in the horror film Frogs, which was theatrically released on March 10, 1972. After receiving a contract with Universal Studios, Van Ark co-starred with Bette Davis in The Judge and Jake Wyler, a 1972 telefilm and series pilot that failed to be picked up by NBC. Van Ark played the role of Erika in M*A*S*H in 1973 in the episode entitled \"Radar's Report.\" Van Ark was also a regular castmember of the short-lived television sitcoms Temperatures Rising (1972\u201373) and We've Got Each Other (1977\u201378). In 1974, Van Ark, tapped as a late replacement for Mary Ure, returned to Broadway as Silia in a revival of Pirandello's The Rules of the Game. In 1975, a production of Game from the Off-Broadway Phoenix Theatre was also broadcast as one of the Theater in America selections featured on PBS' Great Performances. Van Ark co-starred opposite Richard Boone in the science fiction outing The Last Dinosaur. The movie was filmed in Tokyo, Japan, and was intended to be released theatrically but failed to find a distributor and instead aired as a TV movie in February 1977. After working for several years in a variety of guest roles on television, in 1978, she gained her best-known role as Valene Ewing (originally as a one-time appearance) on Dallas. Van Ark kept a tight schedule and was flying a lot the week of her Dallas debut, as Dallas was being filmed in Texas and she was simultaneously shooting an episode of The Love Boat in L.A. and doing voiceover work for Est\u00e9e Lauder in New York. However, writers later worked the character into a couple of additional episodes; she then carried the character over into the long-running spin-off, Knots Landing, in 1979. She remained with Knots Landing for thirteen of the show's fourteen seasons, leaving in 1992 (although she did return for the series' final episode in May 1993). In the storyline, Valene was married three times to husband Gary Ewing (played in the series by Ted Shackelford), and had two other marriages during the show's run. During her thirteen years on Knots Landing, Van Ark earned two Soap Opera Digest Awards for Best Actress and was nominated an additional six times. Over the course of the program, Van Ark probably received her greatest recognition as an actress during the sixth season, which featured an intricate storyline involving the theft of Valene's twin babies at birth. Their disappearance prompted Valene to embark on both a physical departure from California to Nevada and Tennessee and also a surreal emotional journey in which she morphed into the persona of a character from a novel she had written. In the summer of 1985, TV Guide assessed of her performance: \"Knots Landing has the grimmest plots but the strongest cast, headed by the incomparable Joan Van Ark as Valene.\" Later on, she also directed two episodes of the series. Van Ark and co-star Michele Lee became good friends while working on the series, mirroring their characters' onscreen friendship. In May 1997, she reprised her role of Valene Ewing in the CBS mini-series Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac; while in December 2005, she appeared in the non-fiction reunion Knots Landing Reunion: Together Again, in which she reminisced with the other cast members about the long-running CBS television show. Shortly before leaving Knots Landing, she starred opposite Christopher Meloni in an ill-fated pilot called Spin Doctors, a sitcom for NBC that was not picked up. An ABC Afterschool Special called Boys Will Be Boys: The Ali Cooper Story, which she appeared in and directed, was nominated for a Humanitas. In 1997, Van Ark also directed a documentary short on homelessness and domestic violence for the Directors Guild of America; the piece was nominated for an Emmy Award. She originated the role of Gloria Fisher Abbott on CBS television's The Young and the Restless from 2004 to 2005, then decided to leave the role and was replaced by Judith Chapman. Van Ark also appeared Off-Broadway opposite John Rubinstein in Love Letters, as well as in Edward Albee's Pulitzer Prize winning Three Tall Women at the Promenade Theatre and The Exonerated at the Bleecker Street Theatre. In 2000, she performed in Camino Real in Washington, D.C.

More recent stage work includes: her origination of the role of Mrs. Fenway in Escape, one of the newly discovered Tennessee Williams' short plays featured as part of the Five by Tenn collection at the Kennedy Center in 2004; the 2005 La Jolla Playhouse production of Private Fittings, directed by Des McAnuff, and a presentation of A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur in 2006 at the Hartford Stage. Her television movies include: My First Love, in which she was the younger woman in a romantic triangle with Bea Arthur and Richard Kiley; Always Remember I Love You, opposite Patty Duke as Ruth; Moment of Truth: A Mother's Deception; In the Shadows, Someone's Watching with Daniel J. Travanti, a former classmate at Yale, and When the Dark Man Calls, opposite Chris Sarandon and James Read.

She appeared in three separate episodes of Medical Center, Cannon and The Rockford Files, and four separate episodes of The Love Boat. In 1978, she also appeared in an episode of Wonder Woman with Ted Shackleford, who would later become her onscreen husband Gary Ewing on both Dallas and Knots Landing. Van Ark also performed the voice of Spider-Woman in the short-lived 1979 animated series of the same name. In 1985, she hosted the Tournament of Roses Parade on CBS, which received a Daytime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Special Class Program.
