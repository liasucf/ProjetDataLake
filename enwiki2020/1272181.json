    "text": "F.I.R. () is a Taiwanese pop rock band formed in 2004. The band consists of Lydia (lead vocals), Ian Chen (keyboards) and Real Huang (guitar, vocals). Producer Ian Chen formed his own band and recruited the other two members to form F.I.R. They are well known throughout Asia after their hit \"Lydia\", which gained popularity and was the theme song for the Taiwanese TV drama The Outsiders (\u9b25\u9b5a). The drama was aired in Taiwan without revealing the singer of the theme song. The song attracted many fans, which led to F.I.R.'s big success when they finally debuted in 2004. In 2018, it was announced that Faye would not be part of F.I.R. anymore as she had opted to not renew her contract with the label. In October 2018, it was announced that a new lead singer, Lydia was selected among hundreds of new singers by Ian and Real. The name F.I.R. comes from the initials of the names of the three members: Faye, Ian, and Real. It is also a backronym for \"Fairyland In Reality\", their debut album name. == Members == === Current Members === *Producer/Keyboard **Stage name: Ian (I) **Birth name: Ch\u00e9n Ji\u00e0nn\u00edng (\u9673\u5efa\u5be7) **Birthplace: Taipei, Republic of China (Taiwan) **Birth date: **Musical Instrument: Guitar, Keyboard, Keytar *Guitarist **Stage name: Real (R) (\u963f\u6c81, \u0100 Q\u00ecn) **Birth name: Hu\u00e1ng H\u00e0nq\u012bng (\u9ec3\u6f22\u9752) **Birthplace: Taichung, Republic of China (Taiwan) **Birth date: **Musical Instruments: Guitar, keyboard, piano, arranging music on the computer **Band Position: Electric guitar, some keyboard, some arranging on the music and sound *Lead Vocal **Stage name: Lydia **Birth name: H\u00e1n ru\u00ec (\u97e9\u777f) **Birthplace: People's Republic of China **Birth date: === Past Member === *Lead Vocal **Stage name: Faye (F) (\u98db or \u98db\u5152, Fei or Feier) **Birth name: Chan W\u00e9nt\u00edng (\u8a79\u96ef\u5a77) **Birthplace: Taipei, Taiwan **Birth date: ==Discography== ===Singles=== * Spread Love(\u628a\u611b\u50b3\u51fa\u4f86) (December 2005) *City of Sound(\u58f0\u97f3\u4e4b\u57ce) (December 2018) *\u611b\u6211\u6240\u611b (December 2018) *Forever Young (September 2019) ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
