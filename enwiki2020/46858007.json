Badger Mountain is also a part of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Sometime between 10 and 15 million years ago, multiple lava flows poured out from the Yellowstone hotspot, then located in western Idaho. These lava flows covered large portions of Washington and Oregon on their way to the Pacific Ocean and are the cause of the underlying basalt of the region. In some areas, the basalt was thick.Bishop, Ellen Morris (2003), In Search of Ancient Oregon: A Geological and Natural History, Portland, Oregon: Timber Press, During the time of the last ice age, glaciers extended into northern Washington, Idaho and Montana. This blocked the Clark Fork River creating Glacial Lake Missoula. Periodically during the ice age, the weight of the water behind the ice dam caused it to break creating the Missoula Floods. As these floods rushed toward the Pacific Ocean they carried glacial erratics, chunks of granite not typically found in eastern Washington. The surface elevation of the flood water reached above sea level at Badger Mountain, making it into an island for a short time. Glacial erratics of various sizes can be seen up to this elevation on the mountain and there is a marker along the Canyon Trail at 1250 feet above sea level.Allen, John Eliot; Burns, Marjorie and Sargent, Sam C.
