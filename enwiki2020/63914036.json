Tenzin Tsundue protesting across from Chinese Premiere Wen Jiabao's hotel room in Bangalore in 2005. India\u2013Tibet relations are said to have begun during the spread of Buddhism to Tibet from India during the 7th and 8th centuries AD. In 1959, the Dalai Lama fled to India after the failed 1959 Tibetan uprising. Since then, Tibetans-in-exile have been given asylum in India, with the Indian government accommodating them into 45 residential settlements across 10 states in the country. From around 150,000 Tibetan refugees in 2011, the number fell to 85,000 in 2018, according to government data. Many Tibetans are now leaving India to go back to Tibet and other countries such as United States or Germany. The Government of India, soon after India's independence in 1947, treated Tibet as a de facto independent country. However, more recently India's policy on Tibet has been mindful of Chinese sensibilities, and has recognized Tibet as a part of China. Lachung monastery, Sikkim, India == History == Scholars like Buton Rinchen Drub (Bu-ston) have suggested that Tibetans are descendants of Rupati, a Kaurava military general from the mythological Kurukshetra War. Other scholars point to the spread of Buddhism to Tibet from India through the efforts of Tibetan kings, Songtsen Gampo and Trisong-Detsen as the first significant contact. The 13th Dalai Lama, Thubten Gyatso, had visited the Indian subcontinent in 1910. Today, Tibetan pilgrims visit Gaya, Sarnath and Sanchi, places that are connected to the life of Buddha. === British Raj (1767\u20131947) === In 1779, the third Panchen Lama, was well disposed to East India Company agents from British India.Frederick W. Mote, Imperial China 900\u20131800, Harvard University Press, 2003 p.938. Treaties regarding Tibet were concluded between Britain and China in the 1880s and 1890s but the Tibetan government refused to recognize their legitimacy. A British expedition to Tibet, effectively an invasion, under the command of Brigadier-General James Macdonald and Col. Francis Younghusband began in December 1903 and lasted for around ten months. Following this the convention between Great Britain and Tibet was signed in 1904; essentially the treaty imposed upon the Tibetans numerous points such as payment of a large indemnity to the British. This treaty was followed by a Sino-British treaty in 1906 in which the British agreed not to annex Tibet and China agreed \"not to permit any other foreign state to interfere with the territory or internal administration of Tibet\". The Qing sent a military expedition to Tibet in 1910, Lhasa was occupied, and the Dalai Lama had to flee to British India, where he stayed for around three years. During 1904\u20131947, over 100 British-Indian officials lived and worked in Tibet. === Independent India (1947\u20131956) === India had a diplomatic mission in Lhasa from 1947 onwards. However, in 1952 it was downgraded into a consulate general, and, after the 1962 Sino-Indian War, the consulate general was closed. At the time, there were only three countries that had missions in Lhasa: Bhutan, Nepal and India; only Nepal's mission remains. S. L. Chhibber was the Indian consul general in Lhasa from 1956 onwards followed by P. N. Kaul. India has requested China over the years to allow the re-opening of a consulate in Lhasa; however, Beijing is unwilling.; In 2011, B. Raman wrote that India should not allow Beijing to open any more consulates in India unless India's long-standing demand of a consulate in Lhasa is accepted. == Exile in India == The 14th Dalai Lama escaped from Tibet to India in March 1959 following the failed 1959 Tibetan uprising. On reaching India, the Chushi Gangdruk, who had assisted the Dalai Lama in his escape, handed over all their weapons to the Indian authorities.; Since 1959, for over 60 years, India has given exiled Tibetans shelter. The Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), also known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, was formed in 1959 and is headquartered in Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh, India. In 1991 the CTA became a founding member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO).; In 2009, a survey by the CTA recorded 94,203 Tibetan refugees in India. The Indian government officially recognises Tibetans only as 'foreigners' and not as refugees. A CTA functionary said in 2019: The Golden temple at the Tibetan settlement in Khushalnagar, Coorg district, Karnataka, India The Dalai Lama visiting the Tibetan Children's Villages student art centre at Gopalpur, Himachal Pradesh Rumtek Monastery is a Tibetan Buddhist monastery located near Gangtok, Sikkim, India Tibetans in India have been accommodated by the Indian government in 45 residential settlements across 10 states in the country. There are 59 monasteries across India. Tibetan children are provided free education, and seats are reserved for them in universities. However, they are not eligible for government jobs, and in some states they cannot get loans and are not allowed to drive. Tibetans refugees in India cannot own land or property. In 2017, 60 years after coming to India, the Indian government permitted Tibetans to get passports. In 2018 it was reported that many Tibetans are leaving India for better opportunities elsewhere, including Tibet. From around 150,000 Tibetan refugees in 2011 the number fell to 85,000 in 2019, according to government data. While some are going back to Tibet, other Tibetans are leaving India for countries such as United States and Switzerland. In 2018, due to Chinese presence, India had shifted its stance with respect to Tibet, resulting in the Dalai Lama calling on Tibetans to stay united. === Special Frontier Force === The Special Frontier Force (SFF), an elite commando unit formed in 1962 to conduct covert operations behind Chinese lines, consists of Tibetan refugees in India. During the 2020 China\u2013India skirmishes media reports emerged of the death of a Tibetan\u2013Indian soldier of the SFF, Nyima Tenzin. On 8 September, images and videos appeared in the media of his public funeral and cremation with full state honors. His coffin was covered with both the Indian and Tibetan flags. However while media covered the event, the leadership in India remained silent. Ram Madhav, who was seen at the funeral paying his respects, tweeted about the event, \"Attended the funeral of SFF Coy Ldr Nyima Tenzin, a Tibetan who laid down his life protecting our borders in Ladakh, and laid a wreath as a tribute. Let the sacrifices of such valiant soldiers bring peace along the Indo-Tibetan border. That will be the real tribute to all martyrs.\" Ram Madhav later deleted his tweet. == Tibet in India-China relations == A protest in India in 1958 The Government of India, soon after India's independence in 1947, made evident in its correspondence that it regarded Tibet as a de facto country. This was not unique to India, as Nepal and Mongolia also had treaties with Tibet. China had also considered Tibet an independent country. A few months before India's independence, an Asian Conference was held in New Delhi. Tibet was invited and, along with the flags of other countries participating, Tibet's flag was flown. In 1949, following China's invasion of Tibet, India officially called the Chinese action \"deplorable\". On 7 November 1950, India\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel wrote to the prime minister, In 1954, China and India signed a trade agreement that would regulate the trade between the two countries with respect to Tibet. This trade agreement ended India's centuries-old free trade with Tibet. Bhimrao Ambedkar, India's first justice and law minister, said of the Panchsheel treaty in the Rajya Sabha, \"I am indeed surprised that our Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister is taking this Panchsheel seriously\" and \"by letting China take control over Lhasa (Tibet\u2019s capital) the Prime Minister has in a way helped the Chinese to bring their armies on the Indian borders.\" In 1962, following Chinese \"betrayal\" and aggression, Rajendra Prasad, the former first President of India, said at the Gandhi Maidan in October 1962, Naveen Patnaik and Dalai Lama in 2017 Acharya Kriplani said of Tibet in the Lok Sabha in 1959, \"It was a nation which wanted to live its own life and it sought to have been allowed to live its own life. A good government is no substitute for self-government.\" Jaya Prakash Narayan had said \"Tyrannies have come and gone and Caesars and Czars and dictators. But the spirit of man goes on forever. Tibet will be resurrected.\" However, the Indian press commented on the silence of the government during the time and noted that the government could do little to help Tibet, even after a United Nations General Assembly resolution in 1961 that mentioned Tibet\u2019s right to self-determination. More recently, India's policy on Tibet has been based on trying not to offend China. On the core issues, India's policy is clear: Tibet is a part of China. However, over the years there have been voices that have said India needs to re-think its policy; this was seen again in 2020 amid the border standoff. Although Lobsang Sangay was invited to Prime Minister Modi's swearing-in ceremony in 2014 and the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh declared that his state had a border with Tibet and not with China in 2017, a major shift in policy came in April 2018 after the Modi-Xi Jinping summit in Wuhan with the foreign ministry issuing a circular to dissuade government officials from going to Tibetan functions where the Dalai Lama or Tibetan government in exile were present. All events marking the 60 years of the Tibetan government in exile were moved from New Delhi to Dharamshala. During the 2020 border skirmishes and standoff between China and India, Shyam Sharan called \"the tactical use of the Tibetan issue and of the Dalai Lama is both cynical and counter-productive\"; he was referring to the use of the Special Frontier Force and the subsequent media coverage. New Delhi was accused of using the Tibetans as a bargaining card only when tensions with China are high. == Gallery == File:The Dalai Lama in ceremonial dress enters India through a high mountain pass, Sikkim, 1956.jpg|The 14th Dalai Lama in ceremonial dress enters India through a high mountain pass, Sikkim, 1956 File:Prime Minister Nehru pointing out a landmark to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama.jpg|Prime Minister Nehru pointing out a landmark to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, 1956 File:The Holiness the Dalai Lama visited the Kashmir Art Emporium at Calcutta, during his visit to the city, on January 21, 1957C.jpg|Dalai Lama visits the Kashmir Art Emporium at Calcutta, during his visit to the city, on January 21, 1957 File:The Dalai Lama with President Rajendra Prasad and Vice President S Radhakrishnan.jpg|The Dalai Lama with President Rajendra Prasad and Vice President S Radhakrishnan File:The Dalai Lama, Nehru and Zhou Enlai in 1956 in India.jpg|The Dalai Lama, Nehru and Zhou Enlai in 1956 in India, at the UNESCO Buddhist Conference in Ashok Hotel, New Delhi.
