    "text": "An artist collective is an initiative that is the result of a group of artists working together, usually under their own management, towards shared aims. The aims of an artist collective can include almost anything that is relevant to the needs of the artist; this can range from purchasing bulk materials, sharing equipment, space or materials, to following shared ideologies, aesthetic and political views or even living and working together as an extended family. Sharing of ownership, risk, benefits, and status is implied, as opposed to other, more common business structures with an explicit hierarchy of ownership such as an association or a company. ==Overview== Artist collectives have occurred throughout history, often gathered around central resources, for instance the ancient sculpture workshops at the marble quarries on Milos in Greece and Carrara in Italy. Collectives featured during both the Russian Revolution when they were set up by the state in all major communities, and the French Revolution when the Louvre in Paris was occupied as an artist collective. More traditional artist collectives tend to be smallish groups of two to eight artists who produce work, either collaboratively or as individuals toward exhibiting together in gallery shows or public spaces. Often an artist collective will maintain a collective space, for exhibiting or as workshop or studio facilities. Some newer, more experimental kinds of groups include intentional networks, anonymous, connector, hidden or nested groups, and groups with unconventional time- scales. Artist collectives may be formed: For economic reasons, to give members volume purchasing power and allow costs of publicity and shows to be shared. For political reasons, to increase local lobbying power for arts infrastructure, to gather behind a cause or belief. For professional reasons, to develop a higher group profile that benefits the individuals by association, to create a hub for curators and commissioners to more easily locate potential talent. ==Notable art collectives== *A.a.s (art group) *Allied Arts Guild (Menlo Park, CA) (US) *Alterazioni Video *American Abstract Artists * Ana Taban (Juba, South Sudan) *Ant Farm *Archigram *Artel of Artists *A$AP Mob *BGL (Qu\u00e9bec City, Canada) *Brew House Association (Pittsburgh, PA, USA) *Brixton Artists Collective *Cacophony Society *Chicago Artists' Coalition *CoBrA *Colab *Con Artist Collective (New York City) *Critical Art Ensemble *Disorient *Drain Gang *etoy *Everything is Terrible! *Experimental Skeleton *Fashion Architecture Taste *Fluxus *Gelitin *General Idea (Canada) *Guerrilla Girls *House of YES (Brooklyn, NY) *HowDoYouSayYaminAfrican? *Independents (Oporto artist group) *Indecline *IRWIN *island6 (China) *Jocjonjosch *Kroesos Foundation *Leningrad Experimental Graphics Laboratory *Liu Dao (Shanghai) *Meow Wolf (Santa Fe) *The Mischief Makers (Nottingham, UK) *My Barbarian *Negativland *Neue Slowenische Kunst *NMP (art collective) *North Edmonton Sculpture Workshop\u201cWar, Peace Among Themes of Sculpture Exhibition\u201d, Gilbert Bouchard, Edmonton Journal, July 8, 2005 *Nsumi *Odd Future *Paper Rad *PFFR *Phylum (San Francisco, CA, US) *Prosa Mutante , Profile page of La Prosa Mutante at Red Federal de Poesia from the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Argentina (In Spanish) (Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina) *Reclaim the Streets *Red Herring Artists(UK) *Rodeo Caldonia *Royal Chicano Air Force *RTMark *San Francisco Mime Troupe *Satellite Collective (New York City, NY, US) *Serializer *SITO (US) *Squishface Studio (Melbourne) *Sol Collective (California, US ) *SuttonBeresCuller (Seattle, WA, US) *Temporary Services (US) *The Handicraft Guild (Minneapolis) *The 7 Fingers (Quebec, Canada) *Toca Boca (Stockholm, Sweden) *Torolab (Mexico) *Traffic Zone Center for Visual Art (Minneapolis) *:fr:Transquinquennal (Brussels, Belgium) *United Congress *Uranian Phalanstery (New York City, New York) *Visual Collaborative (United States) *Volatile Works (Montreal) *Vox Populi (Philadelphia) *!WOWOW! *xurban collective *Yellow House Artist Collective *Ztohoven ==See also== *Musical collective ==References== ==External links== * Artist Collectives * Searchable database of Art Groups and Collective in Canada and the US * Virtual Library list of Ceramic Arts Guilds, Groups, and Collectives * Chicago group Temporary Services webliography of \"Groups and Spaces\" includes many artists' collectives * A doctoral study of Exploding Cinema, a London collective of artists and filmmakers * Category:Arts-related lists Collective ",
