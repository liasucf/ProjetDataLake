In 1901, when all four stories were published in the collection Joe Wilson and His Mates, the stories were printed in order of narrative chronology. After the fourth story, Lawson added the following note, under the title \"The Writer Wants to Say a Word\": ==Reception== According to The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature, the sequence of Joe Wilson stories \"has been justly admired for its controlled presentation of the process of alienation and disintegration wrought by the experience of bush life.\"Kerryn Goldsworthy (2000) \"Fiction from 1900 to 1970.\" In: The Cambridge Companion to Australian Literature (ed. by Elizabeth Webby), Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK pp 105-133. Kerryn Goldsworthy writes that the stories represent \"the most sustained example we have of Lawson's skills in narrative and characterisation.\" ==Adaptations== The Joe Wilson stories were adapted into the 1924 silent movie Joe, and the 1998 miniseries Joe Wilson. They were also adapted into a segment of the 1957 movie Three in One. ==References== Category:Characters in novels of the 20th century Wilson, Joe ",
