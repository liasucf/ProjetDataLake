Mihai I\u0219tvanovici, also known as \"the Wallachian\" or Stepaneshvili, was a 17-18th century Wallachian letter cutter, typeface designer, typographer and printer who worked in the first typography in Georgia under King Vakhtang VI of Kartli. Mihai was a native of Transylvania, born into a peasant family that served Hungarian landlords. Mihai was sent to Georgia by Anthim the Iberian upon the request of King Vakhtang VI of Kartli, in order to establish a printing press and typography. He likely arrived in Georgia in 1707. Vakhtang VI wrote in his will, \"I brought the printer from Wallachia and made a typography\". ==Bibliography== *Paichadze, G. Vakhtang the Sixth, Tbilisi, 1981 *Gvinchidze, O.
