I started playing along to it and > then Ina started singing along, and the song was written over that. No drums > were ever put down. Once we finished writing the song together, Ina laid a > guide vocal over the top of the keyboard sound and then went away and left > me and Rhys to do the rest of it. So it really was built from that sound. > It\u2019s an Eurythmics kind of sound.\" Mac also acknowledged the influence of producer RedOne's work with Lady Gaga, \"There's no question that without Gaga we wouldn't be where we are at the moment, with what Red has done and how he has changed radio in America, and what's acceptable, and where dance is.\" \"Ego\" follows a chord progression of: Bm-G-D-Bm-G.

The music video for \"Ego\" was shot on 23 October 2009, in the United Kingdom, and the final edit of the music video was released on 17 November 2009. The music video was directed by Mike Simpson & Robin Van Calcar and produced by MrsGrey productions. The band took on a superheroes theme and throughout the whole video the band were dressed as superheroes. David Leighton did all the choreography of the music video. The band are seen in many different scenes, some scenes are in a house, some are at a press conference, and many where the band are standing together. The music video has been compared to The Watchmen, as the video is set to be in 1985. The male, main role in the music video is played by Waz Ashayer, who is a model, and became famous after appearing on Make Me a Supermodel. The music video features the album's version of the song. ===Synopsis=== As the video starts, Vanessa is seen singing to a picture of what appears to be a superhero team made of The Saturdays and an extra male. Vanessa looks out of her apartment window, to see a press conference centred on the man. The video then skips to Una standing in an alleyway where a poster of the male is put up over an older poster of The Saturdays and the male. Una rips this down and sets it on fire using her superpower. It is obvious from this that the man has betrayed The Saturdays and they want revenge. Una's power also causes the real man to start to heat up and become uncomfortable. The scene switches to Frankie, now hidden amongst the paparazzi at the press conference. She uses her superpowers to amplify the camera's flash to dazzle the man. As the second chorus kicks in, Vanessa displays telekinetic power, being able to pull and push the man around from a distance. This causes him to flee and try to escape in a car. Rochelle stops the car from moving with her superpower stopping the man from escaping. He then runs down an alleyway. Mollie flies down from the top of a building and blows the man back down the alleyway. The video closes with The Saturdays walking calmly down a deserted road with the man crawling pathetically backwards from the girls. ===Reception=== Rickified of dirrtyinc.com said he was disappointed with the music video, and he never expected it to be so boring, after he stated, \"An utter boring vid, as I've expected a dance sequence since this song is rather uptempo and packs with a punch. I just don\u2019t get it why the marketing team would marred this song with such horrible execution.\" Vanessa White told Digital Spy: \"It's completely different to everything we've done so far, there's a lot of proper acting in it\".David Balls of Digital Spy The Saturdays talk about Ego video 12 November 2009. ==Promotion== The Saturdays performing Ego at V Festival The Saturdays first promoted the single at their album launch party.
