It is located about southeast of the industrial city of Dukhan, about southwest of Al Nasraniya and about north of Al Kharsaah. ==Etymology== A short tree known locally as Salam (Acacia ehrenbergiana) occurs frequently in the area, giving the village its name. The tree, which grows up to tall and which has yellow-colored flowers, flourishes in the rawdas (depressions) of the area due to the sediment and water runoff. ==References== Category:Populated places in Al-Shahaniya ",
