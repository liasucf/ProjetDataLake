Carter entered the limelight as a child when she lived in the White House during the Carter presidency. == Early life and education== Amy Carter was born on October 19, 1967, in Plains, Georgia. In 1970 her father was elected Governor of Georgia, and then in 1976, President of the United States. Amy was raised in Plains until her father was elected governor, whereupon she moved with her family into the Georgia Governor's Mansion and the White House when her father was elected president. Carter attended majority black public schools in Washington during her four years in Washington; first Stevens Elementary School and then Rose Hardy Middle School.Baltimore Sun: \"Jimmy Carter's first decisions as president-elect...\" By THEO LIPPMAN JR. January 07, 1993 Mary Prince (an African American woman wrongly convicted of murder, and later pardoned) was her nanny for most of the period from 1971 until Jimmy Carter's presidency ended. After her father's presidency, Amy Carter moved to Atlanta; her senior year of high school was at Woodward Academy in College Park, Georgia. Carter attended Brown University but was academically dismissed in 1987, \"for failing to keep up with her course work\".\"Amy Carter ouster by Brown U. told\", Chicago Sun-Times, July 19, 1987. She later earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree (BFA) from the Memphis College of Art and received a master's degree in art history from Tulane University in New Orleans in 1996. == Life in the White House == In January 1977, at the age of nine, Carter entered the White House, where she lived for four years. She was the subject of much media attention during this period, as young children had not lived in the White House since the early 1960s presidency of John F. Kennedy (and would not again do so after the Carter presidency until the inauguration of Bill Clinton, in January 1993, when Chelsea moved in.) left While Carter was in the White House, she had a Siamese cat named Misty Malarky Ying Yang, which was the last cat to occupy the White House until Socks, owned by Bill Clinton. Carter also was given an elephant from Sri Lanka from an immigrant; the animal was given to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Carter attended public schools, including Stevens Elementary School and Hardy Middle School.First choice: why Chelsea Clinton should attend a public school - President-elect Bill Clinton's daughter Carter roller-skated through the White House's East Room and had a treehouse on the South Lawn. When she invited friends over for slumber parties in her treehouse, Secret Service agents monitored the event from the ground. 228x228px Carter did not receive the \"hands off\" treatment that most of the media later afforded to Chelsea Clinton. President Carter mentioned his daughter during a 1980 debate with Ronald Reagan, when he said he had asked her what the most important issue in that election was and she said, \"the control of nuclear arms\". Once, when asked whether she had any message for the children of America, Amy replied with a simple \"no\".Miller, Danny (January 25, 2006). \"I Heart Amy Carter\". The Huffington Post Controversy resulted when Carter was seen reading a book during a state dinner at the White House, which was seen as being offensive to foreign guests. == Activism == Carter later became known for her political activism. She participated in a number of sit- ins and protests during the 1980s and early 1990s that were aimed at changing U.S. foreign policy towards South African apartheid and Central America. Along with activist Abbie Hoffman and 13 others, she was arrested during a 1986 demonstration at the University of Massachusetts Amherst for protesting CIA recruitment there. She was acquitted of all charges in a well-publicized trial in Northampton, Massachusetts. Attorney Leonard Weinglass, who defended Abbie Hoffman in the Chicago Seven trial in the 1960s, utilized the necessity defense, successfully arguing that because the CIA was involved in criminal activity in Central America and other hotspots, preventing it from recruiting on campus was equivalent to trespassing in a burning building. == Personal life == Carter illustrated The Little Baby Snoogle-Fleejer, her father's book for children, published in 1995. In September 1996, Carter married computer consultant James Gregory Wentzel, whom she had met while attending Tulane; Wentzel was a manager at Chapter Eleven, an Atlanta bookstore, where Carter worked part-time. Carter kept her own family name and the couple moved to the Atlanta area, where they focused on raising their son, Hugo James Wentzel (b. 1999). Since the late 1990s, Carter has maintained a low profile, neither participating in public protests nor granting interviews. She is a member of the board of counselors of the Carter Center that advocates human rights and diplomacy as established by her father. == See also == * Jenna Bush Hager * Barbara Bush (born 1981) * Chelsea Clinton * Malia Obama * Sasha Obama == References == == External links == * * Category:1967 births Category:20th- century American women Category:21st-century American women Category:Brown University alumni Category:Living people Category:People from Atlanta Category:People from Plains, Georgia Category:Tulane University alumni Category:Children of Presidents of the United States Category:Carter family Category:American political activists Category:Woodward Academy alumni ",
