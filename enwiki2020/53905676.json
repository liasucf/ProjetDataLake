    "text": "Mohamed Soudan (born 1956) is a senior member of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood Organization and its now defunct political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP). He was foreign relations secretary underneath previous president, Mohamed Morsi, who was ousted in June 2013 after massive opposition demonstrations. Following the coup, Soudan fled to the U.K., where he has been living ever since. An Egyptian court has sentenced Soudan, in absentia, to twelve years in prison. ==Early life and education== Soudan was born in Alexandria, Egypt in June 1956, and joined the Muslim Brotherhood at age twenty-three following graduation from the Faculty of Engineering at Alexandria University. He held various positions in the Brotherhood as he climbed the ladder through the years, and he played an integral part in forming the Freedom and Justice Party after Hosni Mubarak's early 2011 ousting. ==Egyptian revolution== Soudan proclaimed he had played an \u201cactive part\u201d in the January 2011 Egyptian revolution. In an interview he stated: > \u201cThere is no question that the MB [Muslim Brotherhood] was the organizer of > the revolution, because we were the only group with the capability to > organize people on a mass scale. The mosques \u2013 and specifically Friday > prayers \u2013 were a focal point for mobilization.\u201d Further in the interview, Soudan asserted, \u201cThe Muslim Brotherhood has a coherent plan to change and fix society. We won\u2019t want to force the people to pray. Egypt can only become Islamic in a gradual fashion.\u201d ==Freedom and Justice Party== In 2011, the Freedom and Justice Party was founded as the political wing of the Brotherhood following Hosni Mubarak's overthrow. The group subsequently took over leadership of Egypt and its candidate, Mohamed Morsi, was elected president. Like the Brotherhood, its foundation is based on strictly conservative Sharia \u2013 or Islamic \u2013 law. The FJP was officially shut down by an Egyptian Court in August 2014, eight months after the government declared the Brotherhood a terrorist organization. BBC reported: > \u201cIt was accused of orchestrating a wave of violence to destabilise the > country after the military overthrew President Mohammed Morsi in July 2013 > [\u2026] Saturday\u2019s ruling by the Cairo Administrative Court came after a report > by its advisory panel that noted the FJP\u2019s leaders had been accused, and in > some cases convicted, of murder and inciting violence.\u201d ==Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s controversial history== The Muslim Brotherhood is a Sunni Islamist organization created in Egypt in 1928 by Hassan al-Banna. BBC stated that: > \u201cThe movement initially aimed simply to spread Islamic morals and good > words, but soon became involved in politics, particularly the fight to rid > Egypt of British colonial control and cleanse it of all Western influence. > While the Ikhwan [Brotherhood] say that they support democratic principles, > one of the group\u2019s stated aims is to create a state ruled by Islamic law, or > Sharia. Its most famous slogan, used worldwide, is: \u2018Islam is the > solution.\u2019\u201d One of the Brotherhood's most notable and famous theorists, Sayyid Qutb \u2013 labeled by The Washington Post as the Brotherhood's \u201cintellectual godfather\u201d \u2013 was widely understood to be one of the main inspirations for Osama bin Laden. Qutb's famous book, \u201cMilestones\u201d, became a \u201cclassic manifesto of the terrorist wing of Islamic fundamentalism\u201d, according to The New York Times'. Qutb also served as an inspiration to bin Laden's successor and current leader of Al- Qaeda, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, who has frequently quoted Qutb in his own writings. The Egyptian government designated the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization in December 2013. As of February 2017, the Trump administration was considering whether to designate the Brotherhood as a foreign terrorist organization, stemming from the group's long history with violence. The group has links to terrorist actors and organizations including its Palestinian branch, Hamas, as well as Al-Qaeda. ===Review of Brotherhood activities in the UK=== In 2014, World Media Services, publisher of the Brotherhood's Ikhwaan Press, set up a location in a nondescript London suburb, keeping a low profile given the Egyptian government's pursuit to arrest and sentence members of the organization. Al Jazeera reported that the Brotherhood's activities in London \u201ccaused concern in Britain\u201d, and that David Cameron \u2013 then prime minister \u2013 \u201ccommissioned an internal government review into the philosophy and activities of the Muslim Brotherhood\u201d to ultimately probe any \u201cpath of extremism and violent extremism, what its connections are with other groups, what its presence is here in the United Kingdom.\u201d Britain's foreign and domestic intelligence services, MI6 and MI5, were to aid in the investigation of violent activities by the Brotherhood, along with its senior leaders \u2013 such as Soudan \u2013 living in the U.K. ===Statements on Muslim Brotherhood=== In 2012, Soudan addressed the Brotherhood's stance on interpretation of Islam, and said that while they do not wish to establish an Islamic state, they ultimately prefer \u201ca slower and more moderate way. With alcohol, for instance, Soudan said he\u2019d rather it not be sold, but recognizes it\u2019s big business.\u201d Since Morsi's overthrow, the Brotherhood has been warring with the current government and President Abdel-Fattah Al-Sisi, who declared that the Brotherhood is welcome to resume participation in the political scene, only under the conditions that \u201cthey decide to renounce violence.\u201d Soudan commented on the Brotherhood's involvement in the conflict in a 2014 statement: > \u201cThe Muslim Brotherhood and the Alliance did not and will not stop > participation in the revolutionary movement \u2013 until the bloody military > junta is fully defeated and completely ousted, and fair retribution is > achieved.\u201d In a February 2017 press statement, somewhat contradictory to his earlier proclamation, Soudan said: > \u201cViolence has no place in the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s chosen and established > approach or in its ideology. We always condemn violence as a means to solve > problems or stop oppressors.\u201d ==References== Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt) politicians Category:Muslim Brotherhood politicians ",
