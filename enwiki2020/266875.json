Today, CommutAir operates more than 800 weekly flights to 30 plus destinations, with Embraer ERJ-145 aircraft, from its bases at Newark, Washington Dulles, and Houston Intercontinental. == History == United Express Bombardier Q200 operated by CommutAir Facing forward in the passenger cabin of a CommutAir Beechcraft 1900D In 1979, a commuter airline using the name Commutair operated intercity shuttle service in the Houston, Texas area between Hobby Airport (HOU) and Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and also between Sugarland Airport (SGR) and Intercontinental Airport (IAH) with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and Beechcraft twin turboprop aircraft.http://www.departedflights.com, Nov. 15, 1979 Official Airline Guide (OAG), Houston Intercontinental schedules The airline was established in 1989, with headquarters at Clinton County Airport in Plattsburgh, New York. Operations began on August 1, 1989 as a marketing affiliate of USAir. The airline changed affiliations to Continental Airlines in December 2000, when US Airways and CommutAir failed to reach a mutually acceptable extension agreement, and thus decided not to renew the codeshare agreement. In July 2001, the company announced plans to downsize its fleet and workforce by approximately half and change the route structure of the airline. In early 2002, the company began a \"micro-hub\" operation based in Albany, New York. At its high point in 2003 and 2004, the hub served 21 cities within the Northeast and Canada with a fleet of Beechcraft 1900s. Service was also provided out of Boston's Logan International Airport to several Northeast cities. In January 2003, CommutAir announced an agreement with Continental to feed the latter's Cleveland, Ohio hub. Service commenced on March 16, 2003, serving Kalamazoo, Michigan and Elmira, New York. Two cities were added the following month and by August 2003, CommutAir served 12 cities from the Cleveland hub. CommutAir leased sixteen Bombardier Q200 aircraft from Horizon Air in 2006. The following year, the Beech 1900s were phased out. On October 30, 2007, the company moved all remaining operations from Clinton County Airport, due to the closure of the airport. All operations were then conducted out of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport. On October 2, 2008, the company began operations out of Newark Liberty International Airport, following Continental Airlines plan to adjust to the softening industry. Commutair's pilot group voted for union representation by the Air Line Pilots Association in 2008. That same year, Continental Airlines announced that it would cut flights and more than 3,000 jobs. Subsequently, it was announced that some of CommutAir's flights would be eliminated as part of Continental's cutbacks. In 2011, United Airlines asked CommutAir to obtain five Bombardier Q300s. Two of the aircraft were allocated to Cleveland services and three aircraft were allocated to Newark services. In 2012, CommutAir opened a hub at Washington-Dulles International Airport. In July 2014, CommutAir closed its pilot base at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, after United Airlines withdrew its Cleveland hub. CommutAir also closed its Cleveland maintenance base, and replaced it with a new maintenance base in Albany, New York. On November 9, 2015, CommutAir announced that it has reached an agreement with United Airlines to significantly increase the number of airplanes flown under the United Express brand by adding Embraer ERJ-145 jet operations to the company's existing fleet of Bombardier turbo-prop aircraft. In July 2016, CommutAir began commercial service with its inaugural flight on the ERJ-145XR jet from Washington, DC to Columbia, SC.http://www.prnewswire.com/news- releases/commutair-begins-commercial-service-with-erj-145xr-aircraft-for- united-express-300293175.html#continue-jump In September 2017, the Q300 was phased out and in January 2018, the Q200 was phased out, marking the end of turbo-prop operations. On July 30, 2020, it was announced that United Airlines had decided to end its contract with fellow United Express affiliate ExpressJet and transferred these operations to CommutAir. CommutAir became the sole operator of the United Express Embraer ERJ-145 fleet. ==Destinations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ List of destinations () |- ! City !!

CommutAir operated the final turboprop flight for United Express on Sunday, January 7, 2018. This flight, UCA4909/C54909 between Syracuse Airport and Dulles Airport was operated by tail number N363PH. It marked the end of an era for both CommutAir and United Express. The Bombardier Q200 was subsequently ferried to Roswell International Air Center for retirement. *Beechcraft 1900C *Beechcraft 1900D *Bombardier Q200 *Bombardier Q300 == Incidents and accidents == === CommutAir Flight 4821 === CommutAir Flight 4821, a Beechcraft 1900 operating for USAir Express was flying from Plattsburgh, New York to Newark, New Jersey, with stops in Saranac Lake and Albany in New York. On January 3, 1992 the aircraft crashed into a wooded mountaintop as it was landing at Adirondack Regional Airport. Of the four people on board (two passengers and two crew), two were killed while the other two sustained serious injuries. Shortly before the crash occurred, the aircraft had contacted Commutair officials on the ground at Lake Clear Airport. The aircraft was new and the crew was experienced. Immediately following the accident, there was no clear cause. Of the deceased, one was 23-year-old copilot Dean Montana, and one was an off-duty employee. The aircraft was not required to be equipped with a flight data recorder, therefore, a flight data recorder was not present. The cockpit voice recorder was burned to the point that the data inside was not usable. The National Transportation Safety Board used aircraft position data from air traffic control, the aircraft wreckage, survivor interviews, and weather information to find its probable cause. The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error in establishing a stabilized approach and cross-checking instruments. Factors related to the accident were: weather conditions and possible precipitation static interference, caused by inadequate grounding between the radome and fuselage that could have resulted in unreliable glide slope indications.\" === CommutAir Flight 4933 === On March 4, 2019, United Express Flight 4933, operated by CommutAir, skidded off the runway during its second attempt at landing in Presque Isle International Airport in Presque Isle, Maine. The front landing gear were torn from the plane and embedded in one of the two rear engines. Passengers and crew were evacuated from the main door, with three passengers requiring treatment for minor injuries as well as one pilot. == See also == * Air transportation in the United States == References == == External links == * * Airline Pilot Central * ESOP Litigation Category:Regional Airline Association members Category:Transportation in Cuyahoga County, Ohio Category:Airlines established in 1989 Category:American companies established in 1989 Category:Regional airlines of the United States Category:Airlines based in Ohio Category:1989 establishments in New York (state) ",
