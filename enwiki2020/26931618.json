    "text": "Library Lion is a New York Times best-selling children's book, written by Michelle Knudsen, illustrated by Kevin Hawkes, and published in 2006 by Candlewick Press. It is suitable for children ages 4\u20137., retrieved 5 April 2010 ==Plot summary== Miss Merriweather, the head librarian, is very particular about rules in the library. No running allowed. And you must be quiet. But when a lion comes to the library one day, no one is sure what to do. There aren't any rules about lions in the library. And, as it turns out, this lion seems very well suited to library visiting. His big feet are quiet on the library floor. He makes a comfy backrest for the children at story hour. And he never roars in the library, at least not anymore. But when something terrible happens, the lion quickly comes to the rescue in the only way he knows how. Michelle Knudsen's disarming story, illustrated by the matchless Kevin Hawkes in an expressive timeless style, will win over even the most ardent of rule keepers. An affectionate storybook tribute to that truly wonderful place: the library. ==Awards== Library Lion has won the following awards and honors: * Junior Library Guild Selection.[4] * NAIBA (New Atlantic Independent Booksellers Association): 2007 Picture Book of the Year * School Library Journal Best Books of 2006 * Amazon.com Best Picture Book of 2006 * Time of Wonder Award from the Maine Discovery Museum * Book Sense Book of the Year Children's Illustrated Honor Book * Publishers Weekly Cuffie Award * Oppenheim Toy Portfolio 2007 Platinum Award * Nick Jr. Family Magazine Best Books of the Year * Child Magazine's Best Children's Book Award * Winter 2006\u20132007 Book Sense Children's Picks List Selection * 2006 Wilde Picture Book Award * Irma S. and James H.
