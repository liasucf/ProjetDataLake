Abruzzese made his professional debut on 17 January 1999, started the match against Torino, which the team lost 0\u20132 in the away match of Serie B. The team relegated at the end of season, and Abruzzese was loaned from Serie C1 to Serie C2 side Tricase. On 1 July 2000 Abruzzese returned to Andria but tasted relegation again, this time to Serie C2 at the end of 2000\u201301 Serie C1 season. ===Lecce=== In July 2002, he left for Serie B side Lecce in co- ownership deal for undisclosed fee. Andria also signed Stefano Morello and Carmine Nuzzaci as part of the deal for undisclosed fees. In the first season, he played 26 Serie B matches and was selected to Italy under-21 Serie B representative team and won Belgium U21 2\u20131. Lecce finished as the third and promoted to Serie A. Abruzzese made his Serie A debut on 31 August 2003 against Lazio, the opening match of 2003\u201304 Serie A. He made 26 league appearances that season. In the next season he lost his place both in starting line-up and often as unused substitute, under new coach Zden\u011bk Zeman who replaced Delio Rossi. After playing 5 league matches for Lecce in 2005\u201306 Serie A season (all due to the absence of Erminio Rullo), he left for Serie B struggler Avellino in January 2006. In 2006\u201307 Serie B season, he left on loan to fellow Serie B team Triestina near the end of transfer window. He started 24 times for the Serie B struggler. ===Grosseto=== In July 2007, he was signed by Serie B newcomer Grosseto, which he immediately secured a place in starting line-up.
