    "text": "Chapter VI is the fifth studio album by Swedish doom metal band Candlemass released in 1992. This was the first Candlemass album not to feature Messiah Marcolin on vocals since their 1987 album Nightfall. On this one, Thomas Vikstr\u00f6m took his place. After poor sales of the album, Candlemass subsequently disbanded in early 1994, only to reform three years later. ==Track listing== All songs written by Leif Edling, except \"Julie Laughs No More\" and \"The End of Pain\" by Edling and Lars Johansson # \"The Dying Illusion\" \u2013 5:52 # \"Julie Laughs No More\" \u2013 4:23 # \"Where the Runes Still Speak\" \u2013 8:42 # \"The Ebony Throne\" \u2013 4:25 # \"Temple of the Dead\" \u2013 7:11 # \"Aftermath\" \u2013 5:37 # \"Black Eyes\" \u2013 5:53 # \"The End of Pain\" \u2013 4:23 ==Personnel== ===Candlemass=== * Thomas Vikstr\u00f6m - vocals * Lars Johansson - lead guitar * Mats Bj\u00f6rkman - rhythm guitar * Leif Edling - bass guitar, producer * Jan Lindh - drums ===Production=== *Rex Gissl\u00e9n - producer, engineer, mixing *Tomas Arfert - artwork == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"330px\" !align=\"center\"|Year !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"center\"|1992 |align=\"center\"|Swedish Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|43 |} ==References== Category:Candlemass (band) albums Category:1992 albums Category:Music for Nations albums ",
