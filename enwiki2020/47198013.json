    "text": "Qatar National Bank (QNB Group) () is a Qatari commercial bank headquartered in Doha, Qatar. It was founded in 1964 and currently has subsidiaries and associates in 31 countries spanning three continents. The bank's ownership is evenly divided between the Qatar Investment Authority and members of the public. ==History== QNB was founded on 6 June 1964 as the country's first domestically-owned commercial bank. It had 35 employees in its first year and was initially headquartered in a government-owned building in Qatar's capital city, Doha. The two currencies in circulation at the time were the Indian rupee and British pound. As Qatar's population continued increasing throughout the century, QNB started establishing branches in other parts of the country. In 1974, the first branches outside of Doha were opened in Al Khor and Mesaieed. The bank installed its first ATMs in 1988 in its Doha branches, and, in the next year, introduced VISA cards for its clients. By 2015, it had established 76 branches in Qatar. Qatar National Bank (QNB) controls an 82.59 percent stake in Bank QNB Indonesia. ==Data leak== A leak of data from the bank was made public in April 2016. The leaked files were published on Cryptome. The files contained the personal data of the bank's clients as well as credit card information and passwords. The leak was divided into folders for individual groups of clients; these included Qatar's Al Thani family, state security officials, and staff of Al Jazeera, the broadcaster owned by the Qatari state. ==See also== * List of largest banks ==References== Category:Banks of Qatar Category:Banks established in 1964 Category:1964 establishments in Qatar Category:Qatari brands Category:Companies based in Doha ",
