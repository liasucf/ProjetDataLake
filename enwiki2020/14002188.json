    "text": "Led Zeppelin's 1973 North American Tour was the ninth concert tour of North America by the English rock band. The tour was divided into two legs, with performances commencing on 4 May and concluding on 29 July 1973. Rehearsals took place at Old Street Film Studios in London. ==History== This tour took place shortly after the release of Led Zeppelin's fifth album, Houses of the Holy, which topped the charts. Prior to its commencement, Led Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant also hired PR consultant Danny Goldberg to further promote the tour, and booked a number of large stadium venues. As a result, this tour broke box office records across North America. On May 5 at Tampa Stadium, Florida, they played to 56,800 fans (breaking the record set by The Beatles at Shea Stadium in 1965), and grossed $309,000 (US$ in dollars).Led Zeppelin official website: concert summaryStephen Davis (1995). Hammer of the Gods (LPC) . In total, this tour grossed over $4,000,000 (US$ in dollars). On- stage, Led Zeppelin's shows were developed further from those performed on previous tours, with the introduction of dry ice, laser effects, backdrop mirrors, hanging mirror balls and Catherine wheel pyrotechnics. Their dress attire also took on a more flamboyant nature, evidenced in particular by guitarist Jimmy Page's hummingbird jacket and John Paul Jones' Spanish matador jacket. This increase in on-stage theatricality was later referred to by Page during an interview he gave to rock journalist Mick Wall: Promotional poster of Led Zeppelin, 1973 The three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City which concluded the tour were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release of this project (The Song Remains the Same) was delayed until 1976. The film documents the theft of $203,000 of the group's money from a safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel in New York, just before their final show. The theft was discovered by Led Zeppelin tour manager Richard Cole, who was immediately interrogated by police as a suspect. The sum of money was the band's takings from their three New York concerts. It was never recovered and the identity of the thief or thieves has never been discovered.Liner notes by Cameron Crowe for The Song Remains the Same, reissued version, 2007. The band later sued the Drake Hotel for the theft. It was also during this tour that Led Zeppelin hired for the first time The Starship \u2013 a former United Airlines Boeing 720B passenger jet. During the early part of the tour the band had hired a small private Falcon Jet to transport its members from city to city, but these aircraft are comparatively light and susceptible to air turbulence. After performing a show at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco on June 2,Led Zeppelin official website: concert summary Led Zeppelin encountered bad turbulence on a flight back to Los Angeles. As a result, Grant resolved to hire The Starship for the remainder of the tour, at a cost of $30,000.Led Zeppelin :: Achilles Last Stand The exterior of the plane was re-sprayed with Led Zeppelin emblazoned down the side of the fuselage. Flying on The Starship, Led Zeppelin were now no longer required to change hotels so often. They could base themselves in large cities and travel to and from concerts within flying distance. After each show, the band members would be transported direct by limousine from the concert venue to the airport, as depicted in the concert film, The Song Remains the Same. In an interview he gave to William Burroughs in 1975, Page commented on the exhausting nature of the 1973 tour: In a much more recent interview, Page recalled: Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant has also expressed his own recollections of the tour: ==Tour set list== The song \"No Quarter\" from the band's recent album release, Houses of the Holy, was played for the first time on this tour.
