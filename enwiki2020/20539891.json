It consists of various grassroots movements and held its first national rally on 1 November 2008, in several Australian state capitals.. According to its website, the Digital Liberty Coalition seeks to promote free speech online, and to challenge the constitutional validity of legislative infringements on civil liberties. ==References== ==External links== * Digital Liberty Coalition official website Category:Internet in Australia Category:Non-profit organisations based in Australia ",
