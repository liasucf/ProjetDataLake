    "text": "The direction flag is a flag that controls the left-to-right or right-to-left direction of string processing,3.8.1 Carry and Direction Flag Control Instructions stored in the FLAGS register on all x86-compatible CPUs.Direction Flag at MSDN It is bit number 10. This flag is used to determine the direction ('forward' or 'backward') in which several bytes of data will be copied from one place in the memory, to another. The direction is important mainly when the original data position in memory and the target data position overlap. * If it is set to 0 (using the clear-direction-flag instruction `CLD`) \u2014 it means that string is processed beginning from lowest to highest address; such instructions mode is called auto-incrementing mode. Both the source index and destination index (like `MOVS`) will increase them; * In case it is set to 1 (using the set-direction-flag instruction `STD`) \u2014 the string is processed from highest to lowest address. This is called auto-decrementing mode. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |x86-instruction ! rowspan=\"2\" |Meaning ! rowspan=\"2\" |Flag ! colspan=\"2\" |Notes |- !Direction of string processing !Mode title |- |`CLD` |clear direction flag |0 |lowest-to-highest address |auto-incrementing |- |`STD` |set direction flag |1 |highest-to-lowest address |auto-decrementing |} ==References== Category:X86 architecture ",
