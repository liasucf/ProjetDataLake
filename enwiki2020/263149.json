    "text": "Gaap, by Louis Le Breton, 1863 Gaap (also Tap, Coap, Taob, Goap) is a demon described in demonological grimoires such as the Lesser Key of Solomon,Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis: The Lesser Key of Solomon, Detailing the Ceremonial Art of Commanding Spirits Both Good and Evil; ed. Joseph H. Peterson; Weiser Books, Maine; 2001. p.18-22 Johann Weyer's Pseudomonarchia Daemonum,Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (Liber officiorum spirituum); Johann Weyer, ed. Joseph Peterson; 2000. Available online at Esoteric Archives par 30-39 and the Munich Manual of Demonic Magic,Forbidden Rites: A Necromancer's Manual of the Fifteenth Century; Richard Kieckhefer; Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, PA; 1997. P. 165-167 and 291-293The Goetia of Dr Rudd; Thomas Rudd, Ed. Stephen Skinner & David Rankine; 2007, Golden Hoard Press. p.34Introduction by Joseph Peterson to Pseudomonarchia Daemonum (Liber officiorum spirituum); Johann Weyer, ed. Joseph Peterson; 2000. Available online at Esoteric Archives as well as Jacques Collin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal,Dictionnaire infernal: ou R\u00e9pertoire universel des \u00eatres, des personnages, Jacques Collin de Plancy, 1853, available on Google Books. p.460-469 These works describe Gaap as a Prince in human form who incites love. The Munich Manual also says that \"Taob\" also provides medical care for women, transforms them to make it easier to get to a lover, renders them infertile, and rules twenty-five legions of spirits. The other sources instead describe Gaap as a President, giving him the power to teach philosophy and liberal arts, make others invisible, steal familiars from other magicians, make men stupid, and carry men between kingdoms; in addition to ruling sixty- six legions of demons. Johann Weyer also connects Gaap to necromancers, and states that he was first called upon by Noah's son Ham, along with Beleth. He was of the order of potestates. Gaap (or Goap) is also one of the four cardinal spirits, of the south in the Lesser Key of Solomon, the west in the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum. In the Livre des Esperitz,\"Les who's who d\u00e9monologiques de la Renaissance et leurs anc\u00eatres m\u00e9di\u00e9vaux\" by Jean-Patrice Boudet, M\u00e9di\u00e9vales 44, Spring 2003, (online link). pars. 25, 28, 56 Gaap (as Caap) is still a Prince, but appears as a knight, brings gold and silver anywhere, and rules twenty legions of spirits. Accomplished occultist Carroll \"Poke\" Runyon treats Gaap and Coap as different entities,The Book of Solomon's Magick by Carroll Runyon, C.H.S. Inc, 1996, p.160 although they were historically the same figure. According to Thomas Rudd, Gaap is opposed by the Shemhamphorasch angel Ieuiah.Rudd, ed. Skinner & Rankine, p.366-376 ==See also== * Amaymon is also one of the four cardinal spirits, of the East in the Lesser Key of Solomon. * Ziminiar is also one of the four cardinal spirits, of the North in the Lesser Key of Solomon. * Corson is also one of the four cardinal spirits, of the West in the Lesser Key of Solomon. ==References== Category:Goetic demons ",
