    "text": "Caddo National Grassland is a national grassland in the southern Great Plains, consisting of two separate sections located in northeastern and southeastern Fannin County, Texas, United States. It is a protected area that was purchased in the 1930s. The goal of the park when purchased was to restore the eroded soil. Two developed recreation areas are around Lake Davy Crockett, which is in size. The grassland is divided into two units: Bois d'Arc Creek and Ladonia. The grassland is administered together with all four United States national forests and two national grasslands located entirely in Texas, from common offices in Lufkin, Texas. The units include Angelina, Davy Crockett, Sabine, and Sam Houston National Forests, plus Caddo and Lyndon B. Johnson National Grassland. The local ranger district offices are located in Decatur. ==References== ==External links== * *Caddo-LBJ National Grasslands- U.S. Forest Service *Caddo National Grasslands WMA - Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Category:Grasslands of Texas Category:Grasslands of the North American Great Plains Category:Protected areas of Fannin County, Texas Category:National Grasslands of the United States Category:Wildlife management areas of Texas ",
