    "text": "Shalim (\u0160al\u0101m, Shalem, Salem, and Salim) is a god in the Canaanite religion pantheon, mentioned in inscriptions found in Ugarit (Ras Shamra) in Syria.Golan, 2003, p. 82. \"The name of the Canaanite deity of the setting sun Salim, or Salem, [...] The names [of Sahar and Salim] are rendered in modern scholarly texts as Shakhar and Shalim [...]\" William F. Albright identified Shalim as the god of dusk and Shahar as god of the dawn.Albright, 1990,p. 187; cf. the Akkadian word for sunset, \u0161al\u0101m \u0161am\u0161i. In the Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible, Shalim is also identified as the deity representing Venus or the \"Evening Star\" and Shahar the \"Morning Star\". His name derives from the triconsonantal Semitic root S-L-M. The city of Jerusalem was named after him and the biblical King Solomon may also have been. ==Ugaritic inscriptions== A Ugaritic myth known as The Gracious and Most Beautiful Gods, describes Shalim and his brother Shahar as offspring of El through two women he meets at the seashore. They are both nursed by \"The Lady\", likely Anat (Athirat or Asherah), and have appetites as large as \"(one) lip to the earth and (one) lip to the heaven.\" In other Ugaritic texts, the two are associated with the sun goddess.van der Toorn et al., 1999, pp. 755-6 Another inscription is a sentence repeated three times in a para-mythological text, \"Let me invoke the gracious gods, the voracious gods of ym.\" Ym in most Semitic languages means \"day,\" and Shalim and Shahar, twin deities of the dusk and dawn, were conceived of as its beginning and end.van der Toorn et al., 1999, p. 222. Shalim is also mentioned separately in the Ugaritic god lists and forms of his name also appear in personal names, perhaps as a divine name or epithet. Many scholars believe that the name of Shalim is preserved in the name of the city Jerusalem.N. Na'aman, Canaanite Jerusalem and its central hill country neighbours in the second millennium B.C.E., Ugarit-Forschungen Vol. 24 (1992), pp275-291.L. Grabbe, Ethnic groups in Jerusalem, in Jerusalem in Ancient History and Tradition (Clark International, 2003) pp145-163.John Day, Yahweh and the gods and goddesses of Canaan, Sheffield Academic Press 2002, p180 The god Shalim may have been associated with dusk and the evening star in the etymological senses of a \"completion\" of the day, \"sunset\" and \"peace\". ==In popular culture== Shalim is one of the main characters in books two and three of the Court of the Sea Fae trilogy by C.N. Crawford. His name is Salem in the series and he fell to earth and eventually became Lucifer. ==See also== *Almaqah *Wadd ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * Category:Night gods Category:Phoenician mythology Category:Stellar gods Category:Venusian deities Category:West Semitic gods ",
