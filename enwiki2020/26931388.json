    "text": "Unicode contains a number of characters that represent various cultural, political, and religious symbols. Most, but not all, of these symbols are in the Miscellaneous Symbols block. The majority of them are treated as graphic symbols that are not characters. Jukka Korpela, Unicode Explained, O'Reilly, 2006, p. 13. Exceptions to this include characters in certain writing systems that are also in use as political or religious symbols, such as \u5350 (U+5350), the swastika encoded as a Chinese character (although it is also encoded as a religious symbol at U+0FD5); or \u0950 (U+0950), the Om symbol which is, strictly speaking, a Devanagari ligature. A special case is \ufdf2 (U+FDF2), which is a special ligature of Arabic script used only for writing of the word Allah. This ligature is in the Arabic Presentation Forms-A block, which was only encoded for compatibility and is not recommended for use in regular Arabic text. Unicode defines the semantics of a character by its character identity and its normative properties, one of these being the character's general category, given as a two-letter code (e.g. Lu for \"uppercase letter\"). Characters that fall in the \"political or religious\" category are given the \"general category\" So, which is the catch-all category for \"Symbol, other\", i.e. anything considered a \"symbol\" which does not fall in any of the three other categories of Sm (mathematical symbols), Sc (currency symbols) or Sk (phonetic modifier symbols, i.e. IPA signs not considered letters).\"In a set containing \u262f, \u262e and \u262d, there is something for every taste -- within the limits of political correctness, of course, and a certain technocratic ethical standard. Unicode has not yet created a category for ostentatious religious suymbols, but one should not be long in coming...\" Yannis Haralambous, P.
