    "text": "Castro is a city and commune on Chilo\u00e9 Island in Chile. Castro is the capital of the Chilo\u00e9 Province in the Los Lagos Region. The city is located on Estero de Castro on the eastern coast of central Chilo\u00e9 Island. This position provides Castro with a good access to the eastern islands of Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago as well as to the open ocean through Cucao and Huillinco to the west. == History == Castro is Chile's third oldest city in continuous existence.Jorge S\u00e1nchez R.: Chilo\u00e9 - tradici\u00f3n y cultura, p. 31. Santiago de Chile. Rodrigo de Quiroga as the temporary governor of Chile in 1567 launched a campaign led by his son in-law Captain Mart\u00edn Ruiz de Gamboa to conquer Chilo\u00e9 Island, establishing the city of Castro there, and subjugating its inhabitants, the Cuncos. From its founding on 12 February 1576 until 1767 Castro was the administrative centre of Chilo\u00e9 Island. In 1594 Castro had 8,000 inhabitants most of whom were farmers.Dominique Verhasselt: Archipielago Chilo\u00e9 - el encanto de una isla misteriosa, p.110. Santiago de Chile 2008. . Up to the middle of the 17th century the town was looted by Dutch pirates several times. In 1767, during the time of the Bourbon Reforms that sought to modernize the Spanish Empire, Chilo\u00e9 was separated from the General Captaincy of Chile to which it had previously belonged and made a direct subject of the Viceroyalty of Peru. To ease the communications with Lima the capital of the archipelago was moved from Castro to Ancud in the same year. Even after the incorporation of Chilo\u00e9 of into the Republic of Chile, Ancud remained the capital of the archipelago. Castro was destroyed by an earthquake in 1837 and had only 1,243 inhabitants in 1907. After the inauguration of the railway line to Ancud in 1912 the town developed better. Many buildings, including the railway station, town hall and many of the wooden palafitos houses, were destroyed or damaged by the earthquake and tsunami of 1960. In 1960, Castro had 7,000 inhabitants.Juan Mancilla P\u00e9rez: Pueblos de Chilo\u00e9, p. 42. Castro 2008 Only in 1982 did Castro regain its role as the capital of the Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago. ==Demographics== According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Castro spans an area of and has 39,366 inhabitants (19,325 men and 20,041 women).
