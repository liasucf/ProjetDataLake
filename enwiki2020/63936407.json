    "text": "Roman Guillermo Bravo-Young (born January 28, 1999) is an American freestyle and folkstyle wrestler. In freestyle, he is a Junior Pan American champion and three-time USAW Cadet National champion (two-time in Greco-Roman). As a folkstyle wrestler, Bravo-Young is a two-time All-American and one-time Big Ten runner-up out of Penn State University and a four-time undefeated AIA state champion as a high schooler. As of May 16, 2020, he is ranked #20 in the NCAA pound-for-pound rankings and #4 in the 133-pounds rankings. == High School == Bravo-Young attended Sunnyside High School in Tucson, Arizona. He started wrestling in the varsity team as a freshman and did not lose a single match through his four years of high school. At the DI state championships (AIA), he accumulated a combined record of 16-0 with eight falls, five majors, two technical falls and one decision and also received the outstanding wrestler award all four years he competed at the tournament. He graduated with a legendary record of 182-0 and was ranked #3 by InterMat and #5 by FloWrestling when he graduated. == University == In late October of 2016, it was announced that Bravo-Young had committed to PSU's Cael Sanderson to wrestle as a Nittany Lion. === 2018-19 === Bravo-Young did not redshirt and started wrestling as a true freshman at 133 pounds. During regular season, he won the Keystone Classic and placed third at the Southern Scuffle. He went 4-2 at the Big Ten Conference championships and placed fifth. He entered the NCAA Championships as the tenth seeded wrestler and went 4-3 to place eight and claim All-America honors. He finished the season with a 25-7 record. === 2019-20 === As a sophomore, he won the Black Knight Invitational and the Wilkes Open and only lost one match to the top-ranked Seth Gross in a close 5-6 in regular season. He went 2-1 at the Big Ten's, losing in the finals to #3 ranked Sebastian Rivera. Bravo-Young was scheduled to compete at the 2020 NCAA Championships, however, the event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He was expected to place higher than last year, as major improvements were seen comparing to last season. After the season, Bravo-Young earned All-American honors due to his performance through the year. == Freestyle == === Cadet & Junior === Bravo-Young was a standout youth-level wrestler and his eligibility to compete at this level expired in early 2020. He competed as a cadet since 2014 until 2016 and compiled a record of 36-3, represented the United States at the World Championships and won a UWW National championship and two USAW National championships on his way. As a junior, he posted an 11-2 record and won a Pan American Championship, became runner-up at the US Nationals and placed third at the US World Team Trials. === U23 & Senior === ==== 2017 ==== Even though he was still a junior in high school, Bravo-Young competed at the US Open as a senior in his first freestyle competition as such. He lost his first match and then he also lost his first match in the consolation bracket, being quickly eliminated from the tournament. ==== 2018 ==== Bravo-Young was not able to compete in the junior bracket due to injury, and while still being 19 years old, he decided to compete at the 23U Nationals. He won by technical fall in all of his matches on his way to the semifinals, where he defeated one more opponent by points to make it to the finals. At the finals, he lost to Vitali Arujau, becoming the runner-up of the tournament. At the World Team Trials, he lost two more times to Arujau. ==== 2020 ==== Bravo-Young wrestled Jack Mueller on July 25th, at FloWrestling: Dake vs. Chamizo. He defeated Mueller after scoring 8 points to 1. Bravo-Young is currently scheduled to compete against Shelton Mack on October 20, at the NLWC II. == Freestyle record == ! colspan=\"7\"| Senior Freestyle Matches |- ! Res. ! Record ! Opponent !
