    "text": "Tau Ursae Majoris (\u03c4 UMa) is the Bayer designation for a binary star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Major. It is visible to the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of 4.66. With an annual parallax shift of 25.82 mas, it is located about 126 light years from the Sun. At that distance, the visual magnitude is diminished by an extinction factor of 0.19 due to interstellar dust. This is a single-lined spectroscopic binary star system with an orbital period of 2.9 years and an eccentricity of 0.48. The primary member, component A, is an evolved bright giant with a stellar classification of kA5hF0mF5 II. This notation indicates the star's spectrum shows the calcium K lines of an A5 star, the hydrogen lines of an F0 star, and the metallic lines of an F5 star. It is an evolved Am star of the \u03c1 Puppis type, a class of evolved stars showing the Am chemical peculiarities. It is located in the instability strip of the Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram but is not thought to be variable. ==Naming== With \u03c6, h, \u03c5, \u03b8, e, and f, it composed the Arabic asterism Sar\u012br Ban\u0101t al-Na'sh, the Throne of the daughters of Na'sh, and Al- _H_ au _d_ , the Pond. According to the catalogue of stars in the Technical Memorandum 33-507 - A Reduced Star Catalog Containing 537 Named Stars, Al- _H_ au _d_ were the title for seven stars : f as Alhaud I, this star (\u03c4) as Alhaud II, e as Alhaud III, h as Alhaud IV, \u03b8 as Alhaud V, \u03c5 as Alhaud VI and \u03c6 as Alhaud VII . ==References== Category:F-type bright giants Category:Spectroscopic binaries Ursae Majoris, Tau Category:Ursa Major (constellation) BD+64 0723 Ursae Majoris, 14 078362 045075 3624 Category:Am stars Alhaud II ",
