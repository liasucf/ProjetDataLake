    "text": "Fort Street High School (FSHS) is a government-funded co-educational academically selective secondary day school, located in Petersham, an inner western suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Established in 1849, it is the oldest government high school in Australia, notably the first school not founded by a religious organisation.Aircraft Noise Levy Collection Amendment Bill 2001: Second Reading Today, it remains a public school operated by the New South Wales Department of Education. As an academically selective secondary school, it draws students from across greater metropolitan Sydney. To avoid confusion due to the school's history of separation, amalgamation, and eventually, its relocation; the present school is designated Fort Street High School, Petersham for official government purposes. The school's motto is , translated as \"Each person is the maker of their own fortune\", a phrase attributed to the ancient Roman Appius Claudius Caecus. Fort Street High School has a sister school, Suginami Sogo High School, in Tokyo, Japan. In 2010 The Age reported that Fort Street High School ranked equal fourth among Australian schools based on the number of alumni who had received a top Order of Australia honour. ==History== ===Creation of the Fort Street Model School=== A cigarette card from showing the crest and colours of Fort Street Boys' High School The history of public education in Australia began when the Governor of New South Wales Charles FitzRoy established a Board of National Education on 8 January 1848 to implement a national system of education throughout the Colony. The board decided to create two model schools, one for boys and one for girls. The site of Fort Street Model School was chosen as the old Military Hospital at Fort Phillip, on Sydney's Observatory Hill. This school was not only intended to educate boys and girls, but also to serve as a model for other schools in the Colony. The school's name is derived from the name of a street which ran into the grounds of the hospital and became part of the playground during its reconstruction. The street name is perpetuated in the small street in Petersham that leads to the present school. ===Establishment of Fort Street=== Fort Street High School in 1872 The school was officially established on 1 September 1849, when the conversion of the building was approved by the government. This original school building is visible today beside the southern approaches to the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The establishment of Fort Street School marked the establishment of a non- denominational system of school, where the government undertook the education of its people, separate from religion. The influence of the Fort Street Model School was substantial, forming the basis for education throughout the colonies: > At the same time at the Fort Street National School in Sydney William > Wilkins was teaching pupil-teachers how to lead the children of New South > Wales out of darkness into the light. He was holding out to them that bright > prospect of the day when every locality however remote and every family > however humble was supplied with the ameliorating influences of an > education, which would teach every man, woman and child in the colony to > form the habits of regularity, cleanliness, orderly behaviour, and regard > for the rights of both public and private property, as well as the habit of > obedience to the law, and respect for duly constituted authority. In > Melbourne, Adelaide and Hobart his counterparts were preaching the same > gospel of humanity marching forward, reaching upward for the light. \u2013 > Manning Clark, A History of Australia, Vol. 4, The Earth Abideth Forever > 1851\u20131888 In 1881, the school was raised to the status of Superior Public School. ===Formation of Fort Street Public, Boys' High, and Girls' High Schools=== In 1911, the school was split into one primary and two secondary schools: Fort Street Public School, Fort Street Boys' High School and Fort Street Girls' High School. Due to space limitations at Observatory Hill, in 1916, the Boys' school was moved to the school's present site, on Taverner's Hill, Petersham. The Girls' school remained at Observatory Hill until 1975, when the two schools were amalgamated to form the current co-educational school at Petersham. During that time, its grounds continued to be consumed by the growing city; for example, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which opened in 1932, took most of the playground. Fort Street Public School remains at Observatory Hill. ===Recent=== The school celebrated its sesquicentenary in 1999. Its student population is now a diverse one; students come from over 100 suburbs in Sydney, from places as far as Hornsby, the Blue Mountains, Cabramatta, Fairfield and Canterbury, and a range of cultural backgrounds. Students past and present are referred to as \"Fortians\". Ronald Horan was for many years a master at the school. As well as writing foreign language textbooks, he was the author of a history of the school, Fort Street, the School which was later followed by Maroon and Silver. The school has also undergone a variety of renovations, elevating the facilities of the school. The school was closed on the 30th of July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic after the school was advised of a possible case. The school was reopened the next day after a negative result was returned. ==Campus== Fort Street High School is located on a single campus adjacent to Parramatta Road in Petersham, a suburb in the inner-west of Sydney. The school occupies almost the entire street block, and is surrounded by Parramatta Road, Palace Street and Andreas Street with access from Fort Street. The Petersham campus centres on the Romanesque Revival main building (formerly known to most staff and students simply as \"the old block\") now named the Wilkins Building after William Wilkins, who played an instrumental role in the formation of the education system in New South Wales in the latter half of the nineteenth century. The other buildings include the Kilgour building, the Memorial Hall and the newest additions, the Cohen and Rowe buildings, which were completed in 2004. School facilities include a library, a gymnasium, an oval, tennis courts, basketball courts, cricket practice nets, a canteen, and a performing arts block. After years of campaigning for insulation, the school received funding for noise reduction technology, as it is located beneath an air corridor. Work on in the school was scheduled to start in mid-2010 and began in the Memorial Hall at the request of the school principal, Roslynne Moxham, to provide a quiet environment for exams being held in the hall including the Higher School Certificate. It was completed in January 2012, with the completion of insulation in the Wilkins and Kilgour blocks. The school's original Observatory Hill campus is now used by the National Trust of Australia. ==Academics== Fort Street High School teaches all six grades of a standard secondary education in New South Wales, from year 7 to 12.

Mentored by enthusiastic teachers as well as successful senior students and alumni, students create their robots on either the LEGO Mindstorms platform with Mindstorms compatible sensors and motors, or with programmable microcontrollers - such as the Arduino family of microcontrollers - that interface with a variety of electrical components, all housed in a student- designed, mechanically functional structure. From robotics, students not only build up project management and teamwork skills but also learn a variety of useful technical skills including programming, electrical circuit design, mechanics, CAD and CAM. At FSHS Robotics, students are provided with the opportunity to compete in the 3 main divisions offered in the RCJA competition: * Rescue \u2013 a simulation of a rescue mission in a dangerous environment where robots rescue survivors in areas deemed too hazardous for humans to enter. In the rescue division, there are two sub-challenges: ** Rescue Line \u2013 robots must navigate an obstacle course and rescue all victims in a coloured patch, symbolising a chemical spill, before exiting the area ** Rescue Maze \u2013 robots are required to find victims indicated by coloured/heated surfaces and drop off rescue packages * Soccer \u2013 teams face off with 2 robots each to score the most goals possible * Dance \u2013 students and autonomous robots dance alongside each other choreographed to music === Chess === Fort Street High School offers chess as an extracurricular activity after school.

Since 1899, the school has published the Fortian magazine, the school's annual review and yearbook. The name later came to refer to all students of the schools past and present.Horan (1999) An extensive alumni network is maintained through the school's alumni association, the Fortians' Union, formed by the amalgamation of the Old Boys' Union and the Fort Street Old Girls' Union. In addition to maintaining the alumni network, the Union also assists the school and promotes its traditions. It holds an annual dinner each October, with some student reunions held concurrently with this event.Fortians Union \u2013 Fort Street High School (retrieved 16 October 2007) The Fortians' Union publishes Faber Est, a monthly newsletter. An annual Speech Day is held near the beginning of each year at which student achievements are recognised and awards are presented. An address is given by a prominent Fortian. In the past, Speech Day events have been held at various venues, including the school's Memorial Hall and the Sydney Opera House. In recent years, the ceremony has been held at Sydney Town Hall. Throughout its history, the various Fort Street schools have had a number of school songs.Fort Street Songster, Fort Street High School, Petersham, c1985, p. 21 At present, at assemblies, the simply-named School Song which is Come Let the Strains resound that Echo Fort Street's Glory and Gaudeamus igitur are sung at the beginning of assemblies, with Fort Street's Name Rings Around the World sung as the recessional, at its conclusion. The FLOP, an annual student revue performed by outgoing Year 12 students, was performed for many years, beginning in 1976.Horan (1990) It usually involved humorous sketches, often parodying school life and teachers, and, in its final years, the primary medium had been video. Musical pieces, both serious and funny, were often performed. In its finalt years, various restrictions were imposed on the FLOP, including a ban on the use of cars in videos, and a requirement for videos to not include swearing. As of 2010, the FLOP has been permanently cancelled. In line with Fort Street students' long history of being a prominent source of progressive activism in Australia,Campbell, C. (2005).
