    "text": "Friedrich Silcher Philipp Friedrich Silcher (27 June 1789 in Schnait (today part of Weinstadt) \u2013 26 August 1860 in T\u00fcbingen), was a German composer, mainly known for his lieder (songs), and an important folksong collector.Luise Marretta-Sch\u00e4r, Silcher, (Philipp) Friedrich in New Grove Vol. 23 ed. Stanley Sadie, 2nd Ed. (2001) == Life == Silcher was meant to be a school teacher, but dedicated himself entirely to music in the seminary in Ludwigsburg after he met Carl Maria von Weber. He was taught composition and piano by Conradin Kreutzer and Johann Nepomuk Hummel. In 1817 he was named musical director at the University of T\u00fcbingen. He is regarded as one of the most important protagonists of choir singing. He arranged many German and international folk songs that even today remain standard repertoire of many choirs in Germany and became an integral part of German daily life. In 1829 Silcher founded the \"Akademische Liedertafel\" in T\u00fcbingen and directed it until his death. He was married to Luise Rosine Ensslin (6 September 1804 in T\u00fcbingen \u2013 17 June 1871 ibid.). They had two daughters and one son. A wine varietal was named after him, the Silcher (not to be confused with Schilcher). The asteroid 10055 Silcher also bears the composer's name. ==Works== Amongst his best-known songs are: *\"Ich hatt' einen Kameraden\" *\"Alle Jahre wieder\" *\"Am Brunnen vor dem Tore\" (Original version by Schubert, best known in Silcher's adaptation) *\"Die Lorelei\" *Abschied (\"Muss i' denn zum St\u00e4dtele hinaus\"), which \"inspired\" the English-language \"Wooden Heart\" made famous by Elvis Presley when he was stationed in Germany during his military service. ==References== * ==External links== * * * * Silcher Museum in Weinstadt * * * \"The song of the Lorelei\" (English lyrics and MP3) * Category:1789 births Category:1860 deaths Category:People from Weinstadt Category:German Romantic composers Category:German classical composers Category:University of T\u00fcbingen faculty Category:19th-century classical composers Category:German male classical composers Category:19th-century German composers Category:19th-century male musicians ",
