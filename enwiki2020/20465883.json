Born in Rappersdorf in Austria, W\u00e4chter sang in various church choirs in Vienna, making his stage d\u00e9but in 1819 at Graz as Don Giovanni in Mozart's Don Giovanni. He also appeared at Bratislava, Vienna and Berlin. In 1827 he joined the Dresden Hofoper, where he remained for the rest of his career. Here his roles included Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, and he sang in three Wagner premi\u00e8res, playing Orsini in Rienzi in 1842, The Dutchman in The Flying Dutchman (Der Fliegende Holl\u00e4nder) in 1843, and Biterolf in Tannh\u00e4user in 1845.Oxford Music Online The last scene of Wagner's The Flying Dutchman (1843) Hector Berlioz, who heard The Flying Dutchman in Dresden, considered W\u00e4chter's baritone \u2018...one of the finest I have ever heard, and he uses it like a consummate singer. It is of that rich and vibrant timbre that has such a wonderful power of expression, provided that the artist sings with soul and feeling, which W\u00e4chter does to a high degree\u2019.Hector Berlioz, 'M\u00e9moires de Hector Berlioz comprenant ses voyages en Italie, en Allemagne, en Russie et en Angleterre, 1803-1865', Michel Levy Freres, \u00c9diteurs, Paris (1870) W\u00e4chter, an old friend of Wagner's, was not equal to the demanding role of the Dutchman. Wagner later wrote: > \"His total incapacity in the difficult role of my spectral, suffering > mariner dawned on Schr\u00f6der-Devrient unfortunately only after the rehearsals > were too far along to make any change. W\u00e4chter's distressing corpulence, > particularly his broad, round face and the curious way he moved his arms and > legs like shrivelled stumps, sent my Senta in transports of despair.\"'Wagner > and the Art of the Theatre: The Operas in Stage Performance' By Patrick > Carnegy Published by Yale University Press {2006} pg 29 His wife, the mezzo-soprano Th\u00e9r\u00e8se W\u00e4chter-Wittman (born 31 August 1802 in Vienna), also sang at Dresden, creating the role of Mary in The Flying Dutchman. W\u00e4chter died in Dresden in 1853. ==References== ==External links== *W\u00e4chter in the first performance of Tannh\u00e4user *W\u00e4chter in the first performance of Der Fliegende Holl\u00e4nder Category:1794 births Category:1853 deaths Category:Operatic bass-baritones Category:19th-century Austrian opera singers Category:19th-century male singers ",
