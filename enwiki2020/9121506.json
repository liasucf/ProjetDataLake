He was the son of American football player Charlie Gelbert, a College Football Hall of Fame end for the University of Pennsylvania who later had a brief professional football career with the early athletic clubs. Gelbert began his professional career in 1926 with the minor league Syracuse Stars.

Gelbert's career was nearly ended when he severely injured his left ankle in a hunting accident, costing him two full seasons. He returned in 1935, but spent the rest of his career as a utility infielder. In nine seasons, he played in 876 games and had 2,869 at bats, 398 runs, 766 hits, 169 doubles, 43 triples, 17 home runs, 350 RBI, 34 stolen bases, 290 walks, .267 batting average, .336 on-base percentage, .374 slugging percentage, 1,072 total bases and 49 sacrifice hits. ==Later life== After his playing career, Gelbert served as the coach of the Lafayette College baseball team for 21 years, from 1946 to 1966. He also briefly served as manager of the Hornell Dodgers of the PONY League in 1956. On January 13, 1967, Gelbert died in Easton, Pennsylvania, at the age of 60. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1906 births Category:1967 deaths Category:Major League Baseball shortstops Category:Major League Baseball third basemen Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Washington Senators (1901\u20131960) players Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Brooklyn Dodgers scouts Category:Los Angeles Dodgers scouts Category:Syracuse Stars (minor league baseball) players Category:Topeka Jayhawks players Category:Rochester Red Wings players Category:Toledo Mud Hens players Category:Lafayette Leopards baseball coaches Category:Louisville Colonels (minor league) players Category:Montreal Royals players Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Lebanon Valley Flying Dutchmen baseball players Category:Sportspeople from Scranton, Pennsylvania Category:Baseball players from Pennsylvania ",
