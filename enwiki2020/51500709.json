    "text": "The fourth series of Promi Big Brother started on 2 September 2016 and ended on 16 September 2016. It was the fourth series of the Big Brother franchise on Sat.1, after it left RTL II. 5 celebrity housemates (\"promis\") entered the house on Day 1 and the other 7 celebrities entered on Day 3. The show was hosted by Jochen Schropp. ==Format== Promis had participated in tasks and matches for treats or to avoid punishments. Daily nominations also took place (from Day 8 to 14). Furthermore, the house consists of two floors, the upper luxury floor and the lower poverty floor. Housemates on the luxury floor will choose of the poor housemates to join them upstairs, whilst the public will vote one of the 7 downstairs. ==House== This year's Promi Big Brother contains two floors, each floor having their separate living areas, bathrooms, bedrooms and diary rooms. The upper floor will be luxurious, whilst the lower floor is meager with no beds or real seating. This years the downstairs area was changed into a sewerage. ==Housemates== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; line-height:20px; width:auto;\" !scope=\"col\" | Celebrity !scope=\"col\" | Age on entry !scope=\"col\" | Notability !scope=\"col\" | Day entered !scope=\"col\" | Day exited !scope=\"col\" | Status |- !

Big Brother (voiced by Phil Daub) each appoint one or two residents from the \"house\" who must compete at the Duel Arena. In the Duel Arena they both played a game and the loser must face the consequences for his living area. A draw always win the inhabitants in the \"upstairs\". The duels each can either have a positive impact on the winners section or consequences for the loser section. So must for example, the losing team changing areas, receives less food or have to give personal items. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center; line-height:15px; font-size:90%;\" |- ! colspan=\"6\"| Duels |- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\" ! width=\"300\"| Date ! width=\"350\"| Upstairs Housemates ! width=\"350\"| Downstairs Housemates ! width=\"400\"| Game ! width=\"400\"| Winner ! width=\"400\"| Consequence |- style=\"border-top:5px solid #000000;\" | 2 September 2016 | Cathy Joachim | Dolly Jessica | \"Rotating carousel\" | Cathy Joachim | No consequences: Housemates keep their areas |- | 3 September 2016 | Benjamin (Supporter: Natascha) | Frank (Supporter: Jessica) | \"Fresh laundry\" | Frank Jessica | Reward: Frank and Jessica changed the area with Natasha and Benjamin |- | 4 September 2016 | Mario Isa | Marcus Edona | \"Color-blind\" | Mario Isa | Punishment: Markus and Edona must wear a T-shirt with two necklines in the next 24 hours |- | 5 September 2016 | Dolly Joachim Stephen | Ben Marcus Natascha | \"Human Simon Says\" | Dolly Joachim Stephen | Reward: A fancy dress party for the upper housemates. |- | 6 September 2016 | Joachim | Robin | \"Card House Shocker\" | Joachim | Reward: Joachim has to choose one housemate to move upstairs, Robin has to choose one housemate to move downstairs. |- | 7 September 2016 | Dolly Jessica Joachim Marcus | Ben Cathy Isa Robin | \"Finger Hooks\" | Dolly Jessica Joachim Marcus | Reward: The winning team will live upstairs. |- | 8 September 2016 | Stephen | Mario | \"Wire Coat Hanger Balance\" | Stephen | Reward/Punishment: The winner of duel will be immune from the first eviction, the loser will face the first eviction. |- | rowspan=2|9 September 2016 | Dolly Marcus | Frank Jessica | \"Mud Ball\" | Frank Jessica | Reward/Punishment: The team of the winning housemates will live upstairs, the team of the losing housemates will live downstairs. |- | Jessica Mario Robin | Cathy Natascha Stephen | \"Showing Teeth\" | Cathy Natascha Stephen | Reward: A phone call from home for Stephen. |- | 10 September 2016 | Robin | Joachim | \"Operation hip swing\" | Joachim | Reward: Joachim changed the area with Robin. |- | 11 September 2016 | Mario | Marcus | \"Brain training\" | Marcus | Reward: Marcus won immunity from elimination but later gave it to Natascha Punishment: Mario faced the nomination. |- | 12 September 2016 | Ben Frank Jessica | Cathy Marcus Natascha | \"Cold chain\" | Ben Frank Jessica | Reward: The winning team received video messages from their family and friends. |- | 13 September 2016 | Ben Frank Jessica Mario | Cathy Joachim Natascha Isa | \"Poker\" | Mario Natascha Ben Cathy | Reward: All housemates competed in pairs of two consisted of the two areas.
