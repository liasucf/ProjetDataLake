His uncle F\u00e9lix F\u00e9raud, also a notary, was secretary to the last meeting of the Estates of Quatre-Vall\u00e9es in Arreau in 1789. He studied law, read the Encyclop\u00e9distes, and became a freemason. When the National Guard was formed in Arreau, he joined it at once and became a captain. In this capacity, he was sent to Paris to take part in the F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration on 14 July 1790. == Political career == A member of the Jacobins, close to Robespierre and Danton, Jean Bertrand F\u00e9raud was elected to the National Convention in 1792 from Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. He was elected 5th of 6 deputies, with 145 votes out of 22 cast.http://www2.assemblee- nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche/(num_dept)/13027 accessed 17/04/2017 He protested against the expulsion of the Girondins. He delivered a public speech on 9 Germinal Year I (29 March 1793) to the People's Society of Tarbes, at the church of Saint Jean, where the pope was burned in effigy. In May 1793 the Convention appointed him representant en mission to the Army of the Pyrenees where he was injured charging at the head of a column.Jean B. Robert, Vie politique de tous les d\u00e9put\u00e9s \u00e0 la Convention nationale, pendant et apr\u00e8s la R\u00e9volution Paris 1814 p.139 He carried with him a decree forbidding on pain of death the use or storing of gold or silver money and requiring all exchanges to use the assignat. On 6 September 1793 he was named representant en mission to the Army of the Rhine and the Army of the Moselle which was striking into Germany. He received his orders from Lazare Carnot as well as directly from the Committee of Public Safety. In the Convention, he demanded the death penalty for hoarders, and at the end of the trial of Louis XVI he voted for the death penalty without appeal or reprieve,Jean B. Robert, Vie politique de tous les d\u00e9put\u00e9s \u00e0 la Convention nationale, pendant et apr\u00e8s la R\u00e9volution p.139 Paris 1814 but he also attacked Jean-Paul Marat, accusing him of arson, pillage, murder and anarchy. He managed to escape the proscription which fell on most of his Girondin allies because he was on mission in the countryside. Attacked on his return to Paris for having voted against Marat and his Girondin associations, he defended himself based on his record with the armies. During the Thermidorean reaction, he joined the opponents of Robespierre and, together with Paul Barras and his troops, he broke into the H\u00f4tel de Ville to search out the Montagnards in hiding there.http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche/(num_dept)/13027 accessed 17/04/2017 After this he occupied himself with the reorganisation of the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security. He was then sent as a representant en mission to the Army of the North.Antoine Merlin de Thionville described him as 'the maddest colleague you could dream of.' == Death == Charles Fournier, (Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise) In the winter and spring of Year III (1795), agriculture and trade were in chaos and the currency was rapidly devaluing. Townspeople were starving as the prices of staple foods rose. The Convention, which had mobilised its armies against external threats and deployed them to repress rebellions in the provinces, could hardly contain the unrest in Paris. During the Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III the crowds forced their way into the Convention's sessions to demand bread. Newly placed in charge of supplies for Paris, F\u00e9raud tried to harangue the crowd while waiting for reinforcements from the National Guard, but a woman in the crowd, incensed, shot him dead with a pistol. The crowd cut off his head, hoisted it on a pike, and then carried it aloft into the chamber of the Convention in front of its PresidentGregory Fremont-Barnes, Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Revolutions and New Ideologies, 1760-1815, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007 p.594 \\- who was not Boissy d'Anglas as shown in a famous painting by Fragonard, but Theodore Vernier.M.
