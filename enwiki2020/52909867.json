Established in 1998, the team was known as \u0218irineasa and ACS Energeticianul, before moving to T\u00e2rgu Jiu in the summer of 2019 and renaming as Viitorul Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu. ==History== Viitorul Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu was founded in 1998 as AS \u0218irineasa and played for almost all its history at county level, Liga IV and Liga V. At the end of 2015\u201316 Liga IV season, the team was crowned the champion of V\u00e2lcea County and went to the promotion play-off match where they defeated Dolj County champions, Tractorul Cetate, 5\u20134 on aggregate and promoted to Liga III for the first time in the history of the club. The first Liga III season was a very difficult one, financial problems and the weak number of players leading the team to the relegation area until the winter break. In the winter transfer period CS \u0218irineasa transferred an entire team from the newly disbanded CSM R\u00e2mnicu V\u00e2lcea, but the team did not find its rhythm, finishing in the 13th place and relegating to Liga IV after only one season. In the summer of 2017 the club has received an invitation from the Romanian Football Federation to continue in Liga III due to lack of teams. The club accepted and was later taken over by the businessman, Nicolae Sarcin\u0103. Originally from Gorj County, he was planning to move the team to T\u00e2rgu Jiu, following to play on the newly built Tudor Vladimirescu Stadium, within this idea the club changed its name from a legal point of view to ACS Energeticianul, shortly before the start of the season, but too late for a change in the Romanian Football Federation records, playing practically in the 2017\u201318 season with two names CS \u0218irineasa and ACS Energeticianul, fact that attracted a lot of complaints from the other competitors in the championship. The completion of the stadium construction was delayed and \u0218irineasa was in the situation of not having where to play, so the team moved to Petro\u0219ani, hometown of the new club president, Alin Zgripcea, taking advantage of the disastrous situation of local club Jiul Petro\u0219ani and the football void in the city. \u0218irineasa started to play in black and white, Jiul colors, with the promise that at the end of the season the club will merge with Jiul Petro\u0219ani, taking its brand and record, the club basically being in the incredible situation of having three identities, two legally and a third one, from an ideological point of view. With important investments, former Romanian international Cristian Dulca as a coach and well- known players such as: Mihai Minc\u0103, Daniel Lung, Florin Costea or C\u0103t\u0103lin \u021a\u00eer\u0103, the team dominated Seria IV of the Liga III and promoted with and advance of 9 points over CSM\u0218 Re\u0219i\u021ba, the main pursuer, promoting for the first time in its history in the Liga II. At the end of the season, Petro\u0219ani Municipality refused to pass the Jiul Stadium into the property of \u0218irineasa and even asking for a rent to use the sports base. Dissatisfied with the fact that they are not helped by the municipality and complaining that in the summer of 2017 they renovated the sports base from their own sources (the stadium being in the dereliction for over 10 years), the club officials of \u0218irineasa decided to move the team from Petro\u0219ani to T\u00e2rgu Jiu. ACS Energeticianul 2018-19 crest On 29 June 2018 it was announced officially that the club will be named as ACS Energeticianul also in the Romanian Football Federation records starting with the 2018\u201319 season. After one week, the club officials met with representatives of the municipality of Petro\u0219ani finally reaching an agreement to use Jiul Stadium in the 2018\u201319, the club canceling its move. ===2019\u2013present=== On 30 June 2019, Luceaf\u0103rul Oradea withdrew from Liga II in favor of Energeticianul, which was saved from relegation, as it was the first team relegated at the end of the last season. Most important players and the entire technical staff was moved from Luceaf\u0103rul to Energeticianul. It was also announced that the club was moved again, this time from Petro\u0219ani to T\u00e2rgu Jiu and renamed as Viitorul Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu, also changing its colors from white and black to white and blue. ==Grounds== ===Stadionul Municipal=== From the summer until the early November 2019, Viitorul Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu played its home matches on Municipal Stadium in Drobeta-Turnu Severin, with a capacity of 20,054 seats. Municipal Stadium was used as temporary home ground, until Tudor Vladimirescu Stadium, in T\u00e2rgu Jiu, was opened. ===Stadionul Tudor Vladimirescu=== Since 9 November 2019, Viitorul Pandurii T\u00e2rgu Jiu plays its home matches on Tudor Vladimirescu Stadium in T\u00e2rgu Jiu, with a capacity of 12,518 seats.
