The writers included Randy & Jason Sklar, Vito Viscomi, Mike Royce, Michael Lee, Brian Frazer, Eric Friedman and Katty Biscone. ==Reception== Reviewing the first episode, Carole Horst of Variety magazine said the show is a \"wildly unfunny sitcom\" that \"looks more like a TV Land reject than an MTV-sanctioned production\". She goes on to say that \"while exhibiting nice brotherly chemistry and comic timing\", the Sklar brothers \"have transferred characters and bits from their New York stage shows to a boringly traditional sitcom setup\". On the other hand, The Hollywood Reporter suggested that the Sklar brothers \"could be the Seinfelds of the late '90s\". ==References== ==External links == * * * Category:1990s American sitcoms Category:1997 American television series debuts Category:1997 American television series endings Category:MTV original programming ",
