    "text": "Concetta or Concha Maria G\u00f3mez is an Italian and Cuban-American mathematician. She is a professor of mathematics at Diablo Valley College. G\u00f3mez is known for being one of the co-founders of the women's organization The Noetherian Ring at the University of California Berkeley in 1991 while attending as a doctoral student. She is an advocate for diversity in the STEM fields and worked for the Wisconsin Emerging Scholars program of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, whose goal was to promote retention of minority students in STEM. == Early life and education == G\u00f3mez was born to Patricia Gomez. She attended University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison for two years before dropping out due to lack of funds and support. She moved from Madison to San Francisco at the age of 20 and worked odd jobs before taking classes for fun at a community college. G\u00f3mez eventually transferred to University of California, Berkeley and earned a B.A. and Ph.D. in mathematics in 2000. Her dissertation was titled \"Definability in p-adic power series rings.\" Leo Harrington was her doctoral advisor. Jack Silver and Deborah A. Nolan served on her dissertation committee. G\u00f3mez cites the support of Jenny Harrison and Donald Sarason for encouraging her to form relationships with mathematicians outside of UC Berkeley. G\u00f3mez is known for being one of the co-founders of the women's organization The Noetherian Ring at the University of California Berkeley in 1991 while attending as a doctoral student. == Career == G\u00f3mez was an assistant professor of mathematics at Middlebury College. In the fall of 2004, she began working at University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison in a non-tenure track position to teach math and direct the Wisconsin Emerging Scholars (WES) program whose goal was to promote retention of minority students in STEM. In 2006, G\u00f3mez cited Wisconsin's passing a constitutional amendment banning same- sex marriage as a motivation to seek academic employment elsewhere. She is a professor of mathematics at Diablo Valley College where she is also fostering a support network of Latinx faculty and students. She is an advocate for diversity in the STEM fields. == Personal life == G\u00f3mez was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis as a doctoral student. == See also == * List of Cuban Americans * List of Italian Americans * List of women in mathematics ==References== Category:Living people Category:20th-century women mathematicians Category:21st-century women mathematicians Category:21st- century American mathematicians Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Italian mathematicians Category:Cuban mathematicians Category:American people of Italian descent Category:American people of Cuban descent Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison faculty Category:People with multiple sclerosis Category:Middlebury College faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
