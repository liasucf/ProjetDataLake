    "text": "Toda people are a Dravidian ethnic group who live in the Nilgiri Mountains of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Before the 18th century and British colonisation, the Toda coexisted locally with other ethnic communities, including the Kota, Badaga and Kurumba, in a loose caste-like society, in which the Toda were the top ranking. During the 20th century, the Toda population has hovered in the range 700 to 900. Although an insignificant fraction of the large population of India, since the early 19th century the Toda have attracted \"a most disproportionate amount of attention because of their ethnological aberrancy\" and \"their unlikeness to their neighbours in appearance, manners, and customs\". The study of their culture by anthropologists and linguists proved significant in developing the fields of social anthropology and ethnomusicology. The Toda traditionally live in settlements called ', consisting of three to seven small thatched houses, constructed in the shape of half-barrels and located across the slopes of the pasture, on which they keep domestic buffalo. Their economy was pastoral, based on the buffalo, whose dairy products they traded with neighbouring peoples of the Nilgiri Hills. Toda religion features the sacred buffalo; consequently, rituals are performed for all dairy activities as well as for the ordination of dairymen-priests. The religious and funerary rites provide the social context in which complex poetic songs about the cult of the buffalo are composed and chanted., Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. (2007) Fraternal polyandry in traditional Toda society was fairly common; however, this practice has now been totally abandoned, as has female infanticide. During the last quarter of the 20th century, some Toda pasture land was lost due to outsiders using it for agriculture or afforestation by the State Government of Tamil Nadu. This has threatened to undermine Toda culture by greatly diminishing the buffalo herds. Since the early 21st century, Toda society and culture have been the focus of an international effort at culturally sensitive environmental restoration. The Toda lands are now a part of The Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO-designated International Biosphere Reserve; their territory is declared UNESCO World Heritage Site.World Heritage sites, Tentative lists, April 2007. Whc.unesco.org (27 June 2013) in 2012. ==Population== Toda dogles in Nilgiris According to M. B. Emeneau in 1984, the successive decennial Census of India figures for the Toda are: 1871 (693), 1881 (675), 1891 (739), 1901 (807), 1911 (676) (corrected from 748), 1951 (879), 1961 (759), 1971 (812). In his judgment, these records > \"justif[y] [sic] concluding that a figure between 700 and 800 is likely to > be near the norm, and that variation in either direction is due on the one > hand to epidemic disaster and slow recovery thereafter (1921 (640), 1931 > (597), 1941 (630)) or on the other hand to an excess of double enumeration > (suggested already by census officers for 1901 and 1911, and possibly for > 1951). Another factor in the uncertainty in the figures is the declared or > undeclared inclusion or exclusion of Christian Todas by the various > enumerators ...

However, earlier predictions that the > community was declining were overly pessimistic and probably never well- > founded.\" ==Physical anthropology== Physical anthropologist Egon Freiherr von Eickstedt firstly described the Todas as being South Indid, therefore connecting them to ancient Proto Dravidian population. DNA studies in the early 21st century showed that the Toda and Kota share genes which distinguish them from the other Nilgiri Hill Tribes. ==Culture and society== Photograph of two Toda men and a woman. Nilgiri Hills, 1871. The Toda are most closely related to the Kota both ethnically and linguistically. ===Clothing== The Toda dress consists of a single piece of cloth, which is worn wrap over a dhoti for men and as a skirt for women along with shawlwrap. ===Economy=== Their sole occupation is cattle-herding and dairy-work. Holy dairies are built to store the buffalo milk. ===Marriage=== They once practiced fraternal polyandry, a practice in which a woman marries all the brothers of a family, but no longer do so. All the children of such marriages were deemed to descend from the eldest brother. The ratio of females to males is about three to five. The culture historically practiced female infanticide. In the Toda tribe, families arrange contracted child marriage for couples. ===Houses=== The hut of a Toda Tribe of Nilgiris, India. Note the decoration of the front wall, and the very small door. The Todas live in small hamlets called s. The Toda huts, called s, are of an oval, pent-shaped construction. They are usually 10 feet (3 m) high, 18 feet (5.5 m) long and 9 feet (2.7 m) wide. They are built of bamboo fastened with rattan and are thatched. Thicker bamboo canes are arched to give the hut its basic bent shape. Thinner bamboo canes (rattan) are tied close and parallel to each other over this frame. Dried grass is stacked over this as thatch. Each hut is enclosed within a wall of loose stones. The front and back of the hut are usually made of dressed stones (mostly granite). The hut has a tiny entrance at the front \u2013 about 3 feet (90 cm) wide, 3 feet (90 cm) tall, through which people must crawl to enter the interior. This unusually small entrance is a means of protection from wild animals. The front portion of the hut is decorated with the Toda art forms, a kind of rock mural painting. ===Food=== The Todas are vegetarians and do not eat meat, eggs that can hatch, or fish (although some villagers do eat fish). The buffalo were milked in a holy dairy, where the priest/milkman also processed their gifts. Buffalo milk is used in a variety of forms: butter, butter milk, yogurt, cheese and drunk plain. Rice is a staple, eaten with dairy products and curries. ==Religion== A Toda temple in Muthunadu Mund near Ooty, India. Photograph (1871-72) of a Toda green funeral. According to the Todas, the goddess Teikirshy and her brother first created the sacred buffalo and then the first Toda man. The first Toda woman was created from the right rib of the first Toda man. Many rites feature the buffalo, its milk and other products form the basis of their diet. The Toda religion exalted high-class men as holy milkmen, giving them sacred status as priests of the holy dairy. According to Sir James Frazer in 1922 (see quote below from Golden Bough), the holy milkman was prohibited from walking across bridges while in office. He had to ford rivers by foot, or by swimming. The people are prohibited from wearing shoes or any type of foot covering. Toda temples are constructed in a circular pit lined with stones. They are similar in appearance and construction to Toda huts. Women are not allowed to enter or go close to these huts that are designated as temples. From Frazer's Golden Bough, 1922: *Total Toda Population: (100%) 2200 *Toda Religion (Hindu): 87.83% (1932) *Christianity: 11.14% (245) *Islam: 0.94% (20) *Buddhism: 0.04% (1) *Unknown: 0.04% (1) ==Language== The Toda language is a member of the Dravidian family. The language is typologically aberrant and phonologically difficult. Linguists have classified Toda (along with its neighbour Kota) as a member of the southern subgroup of the historical family proto-South-Dravidian. It split off from South Dravidian, after Kannada, but before Malayalam. In modern linguistic terms, the aberration of Toda results from a disproportionately high number of syntactic and morphological rules, of both early and recent derivation, which are not found in the other South Dravidian languages (save Kota, to a small extent.) ==Culture== Richard Barron, 1837, View in India, chiefly among the Nilgiri Hills The forced interaction with other peoples with technology has caused a lot of changes in the lifestyle of the Todas. They used to be primarily a pastoral people but now, they are increasingly venturing into agriculture and other occupations. They used to be strict vegetarians but now, some people eat meat. Although many Toda abandoned their traditional distinctive huts for houses made of concrete, in the early 21st century, a movement developed to build the traditional barrel-vaulted huts. From 1995 to 2005, forty new huts were built in this style, and many Toda sacred dairies were renovated. Each has a narrow stone pit around it and the tiny door is held shut with a heavy stone. Only the priest may enter it. It is used for storage of sacred buffalo milk. Quote: \"... over the past ten years, we have approached government and private agencies for sponsoring traditional houses. Today, we have been able to assist in funding over forty barrel-vaulted houses. Added to these are the scores of existing temples \u2013 two are conical and the rest barrel-vaulted.\" ==Embroidery== Toda men. Photo taken by Capt Leslie Green (2nd Batt Wiltshire Regiment) whilst visiting Ooty c.1924 Registrar of Geographical Indication gave GI status for this unique embroidery, a practice which has been passed on to generations. The status ensures uniform pricing for Toda embroidery products and provides protection against low-quality duplication of the art.\"GI certificate for Toda embroidery formally handed over to tribals\", The Hindu (15 June 2013). ==Notes== ==References== ;Classic Ethnographies *. *. * * ;Toda Music, Linguistics, Ethnomusicology * * * *. *. *. *Nara, Tsuyoshi and Bhaskararao, Peri. 2003.
