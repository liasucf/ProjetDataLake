    "text": "Dudleya anthonyi is a succulent plant from Isla San Mart\u00edn and the adjacent mainland of Baja California, where it is found in the rocky foothills. ==Description== Dudleya anthonyi is very similar in appearance to the Dudleya pulverulenta species typical of southern California. Its stem leaves are narrower, its petals are narrower and united only below the middle, its sepals are narrow above but broadened at the base, and its petals are sharply acute. Dudleya anthonyi may usually be distinguished from D. puverulenta by its narrower and more rigid leaves, which taper from the base.
