The bridge carries approximately 29,000 vehicles per day across four lanes of State Road A1A and Dunlawton Avenue.Florida Dept. of Transportation, Florida Bridge Information ==History== ===First bridge=== The first bridge at this location was built by the Port Orange Bridge Company (owned by S. H. Gove) in 1906, made of sable palm pilings and pine bridge timbers. In 1918, Gove offered to sell the bridge to Volusia County. The bridge was severely damage by a hurricane in 1932, and was torn down. Port Orange was without a bridge for many years after the disaster.History of Volusia County, Florida; by Pleasant Daniel Gold (1927) ===Second bridge=== A bascule bridge was finally built here as a replacement in 1951. The two-lane drawbridge was paid for with tolls. The bridge connected the two ends of Dunlawton Avenue, from the mainland to the beach peninsula.Centennial History of Volusia County, Florida (1854-1954); \"Bridges\"; by Ianthe Bond Hebel (1954) ===Third bridge=== When funded in 1987, the 1990 built Port Orange Causeway bridge (bottom photo) over the Halifax River was planned to be similar to the 1983 Granada Bridge (top photo) passing over that same river. In May 1987, the U.S. federal government agreed to provide $8.16 million of the estimated $12 million cost of building a Port Orange, Florida bridge planned to be similar to the Granada Bridge. After the drawbridge had aged and was expensive to maintain, it was replaced in 1990 by a new four-lane high bridge, which carries State Road A1A over the river. The Florida State Legislature designated the new bridge as the Congressman William V. Chappel Jr. Memorial Bridge. ==See also== * List of crossings of the Halifax River ==References== ==Gallery== Image:POCauseway_0913.JPG Image:POCauseway_0907.JPG Image:HR_PO_Birds0898.jpg Image:PO_Wildlife_Sanctuary0915.jpg ==External links== * History of Port Orange * Port Orange Images Category:Causeways in Florida Category:Bridges in Volusia County, Florida Category:Bridges over the Halifax River Category:Road bridges in Florida Category:Buildings and structures in Port Orange, Florida Category:Bridges completed in 1990 Category:Former toll bridges in Florida Category:1990 establishments in Florida Category:Concrete bridges in the United States Category:Girder bridges in the United States ",
