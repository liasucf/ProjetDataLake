    "text": "The \u017dumberak Mountains (, , historic German name: Karst [2] in Meyers Gro\u00dfes Konversations-Lexikon, Band 10., Leipzig, 1907, p 680-681) is a range of hills and mountains in northwestern Croatia and southeastern Slovenia, extending from the southwest to the northeast between the Krka and the Kupa. It covers an area of . The geographically unified massif consists of two parts, separated by the Bregana and \u017dumberak rivers (Croatian: ). The northeastern part is the Samobor Hills () with the foothills. The central and western part is named \u017dumberak Hills (Croatian: ). Its northwesternmost part, named Gorjanci, lies in Slovenia. The highest peak of the range is Sveta Gera (Trdina Peak) on the border between Croatia and Slovenia, being high. Since 1999, an area of the range in Croatia has been protected as the nature park \u017dumberak\u2013Samobor Hills.\u017dumberak Nature Park ==Location== The \u017dumberak Mountains lie near and partly on the border between Croatia and Slovenia, which mostly passes through the highest parts of the massif. The Croatian part of the mountain range is in Central Croatia, mostly in the western part of Zagreb County, and a smaller part is in Karlovac County. The Slovene part belongs to the traditional region of Lower Carniola. The \u017dumberak Mountains are situated only from the Croatian capital, Zagreb. Cities near this range are Samobor, Jastrebarsko, and Ozalj in Croatia, and Novo Mesto, Bre\u017eice, and Kostanjevica na Krki in Slovenia. The range is in territory of four cities: *Samobor, Novo Mesto, Jastrebarsko, and Ozalj and seven municipalities * Kr\u0161ko, Kostanjevica na Krki, \u0160entjernej, Bre\u017eice, \u017dumberak, Kra\u0161i\u0107, and Klin\u010da Sela. ===Border dispute=== The highest peak, Sveta Gera / Trdina Peak, is subject to a border dispute between Croatia and Slovenia. An old Yugoslav People's Army barracks building stands there that is used as an outpost by the Slovenian Army since the 1990s, although it is recorded in the Croatian land registry, and Croatian side see this as an occupation of their land. Since then that has been a subject of a dispute between the two new countries. The situation became more complex when the dispute nearly derailed Croatia's application to join NATO. It escalated further with Slovenia's blockade of Croatia's EU accession from December 2008 until September\u2013October 2009, when Slovenia (a European Union member state) blocked the negotiation progress of Croatia (at the time an EU candidate state). However, further escalation was prevented due to amicable diplomacy of the Croatian and Slovenian prime ministers Jadranka Kosor, and Borut Pahor. ==Flora== There are more than 1,000 species of different plant life recorded in this area, some of which are strictly protected. In the area of the Nature Park 90 species of Croatian vascular flora from the Red Book are recorded. On the global level 3 of them are critically endangered, 11 are endangered and 28 are globally sensitive. Forests cover huge area of the range. there are few Old-growth forests mostly on the Slovene part of the highest ridge, close to Sveta Gera. These are Old- growth forest Ravna Gora, and old-growth forest on Trdina Peak. Most common are the forests of sessile oak and hornbeam and on steeper slopes are the forests of Downy Oak and hop hornbeam. Beech forests cover the highest ridges. Some endangered and protected plants are found here, such as are globally sensitive species Iris croatica and Daphne blagayana. Globally sensitive species of wild orchids and lilies can be found in areas between forests and open habitats. There is only a small area of grassland of natural origin. The local population exploited grassland. Grassland are rich in species. In some areas more than 40 species of plants have been recorded on one square meter! Many of them are in the Red Book of vascular flora in Croatia. The areas of damp and marsh-like grassland and plain and moors also can be found here. Important example is the area along the Jasinje creek where even 7 strongly protected and 12 protected plant species have been recorded. Among them we stress critically endangered species on global level \u2013 tall cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium) and alpine asphodel (Tofieldia calyculata); globally endangered species of sedges, globally sensitive species: grass-like sedge (Carex panicea) and lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) and species with the status of not sufficiently explored (DD) in Croatia, elongated sedge (Carex elongata). There are 377 species of mushrooms in the Park area. It is supposed that this is only smaller number of a total number of mushrooms in this area, In the research carried on in 2007, 7 new species of mushrooms were found in \u017dumberak \u2013 Samoborsko gorje Nature Park. Arched Woodwax (Hygrophorus camarophyllus) is on the Red List of the mushrooms in Croatia with EN category of endanger (globally endangered species). There are 79 discovered species of lichens, three of which are on the Red List of lichens in Croatia. These are Bryoria fuscescens (with status VU \u2013 sensitive family), Lobaria pulmonaria (with status EN \u2013 endangered family) and genus Usnea (status VU). The research discovered several localities rich in lichen species like wild forest of beech in area of Kuti and wider area of Budinjak, Sv. Gera. Old orchards in grassland are explored as well. Following families are found and put on the Red List of Croatia: Baeomyces rufus (almost endangered species \u2013 NT), Dibaeis baeomyces (VU), Lobaria pulmonaria (VU), Menegazzia terebrata (VU) i Solorina saccata (VU).http://www.park- zumberak.hr/posebni/biologija.html/retrieved on 2014-04-24 File:Alpen_Edelwei\u00df,_Leontopodium_alpinum_2.JPG|Edelweiss (Leontopodium alpinum) File:Eriophorum angustifolium upernavik 2007-08-01 1.jpg|Common cottonsedge (Eriophorum angustifolium) File:Iris_croatica_Botanicki_vrt_1_080509.jpg|Iris Croatica File:Remenik.jpg|Daphne blagayana File:Platanthera_bifolia_(flower).jpg|Lesser Butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) File:Tofieldia_calyculata_habit.jpg|Tofieldia calyculata ==Fauna== Here you may see large predators as bears (Ursus arctos) and wolf (Canis lupus). There are also numerous species of small mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and invertebrates. There are many birds living in this area. Some are birds of prey like goshawk, and birds living next to creeks (white-throated dipper and grey wagtail). In lower parts, the grey heron (Ardea cinerea) can be found, and, occasionally, even white stork (Ciconia ciconia). Most of amphibian and reptile species which you can find in continental Croatia, can be found here. Spotted salamander (Salamandra salamandra) is a regular inhabitant of the areas near creeks. Very rare black salamanders (Salamandra atra) can be found in higher areas. Ponds are hatching places for amphibians like toads, newts and frogs. Snakes are common here. Venomous snakes - Viper (Vipera ammodytes) and grass snake (Natrix natrix), and nonvenomous - Aesculapian snake (Elaphe longissima), smooth snake (Coronella austriaca) and dice snake (Natrix tessellata) \u2013 strictly protected species listed on the Red List. The commonest lizard is wall lizard (Podarcis muralis), slow-worm (Anguis fragilis), European green lizard (Lacerta viridis) and common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). There are 21 species of fish, from 8 families. They live in river Kupa, Kup\u010dina, and other rivers and creeks in the area. Some of them are Eudontomyzon vladykovi, Squalius cephalus and Cobitis elongata. Brown Trout is common due to suitable ecological conditions (water temperature, quantity of oxygen and creeks' speed).Fauna; retrieved 24 April 2014. Austropotamobius torrentium, also called the stone crayfish, can be found in creeks, although very rare. There are numerous invertebrates which enrich biological diversity of the area. Many are endangered. However, due to insufficient research, not all are recorded. The most endangered is Phengaris rebeli. There are numerous species of invertebrates, in caves and holes, that have not been explored yet. There are bats as well \u2013 the most endangered mammal. Recent exploration of karstic underground in the Park discovered some species of arthropods, which are completely new in science.

They belong to the people of Baden culture (Lasinya culture).http://www.park- zumberak.hr/posebni/povijest.html/retrieved on 2014-04-24 ====Iron Age==== There is a large archaeological survey in Budinjak. Large settlement and a necropolis with 140 tumuli were discovered. One of the most important findings is bronze,Kne\u017eeva kaciga (Prince's Helmet), found in one of two biggest tumuli, with diameter of 19 meters . Today it is in Archaeological Museum in Zagreb. This is a proof that Budinjak was a settlement with powerful economy which had contacts with faraway lands. In late Iron Age, the Celtic tribes started conquering and colonizing this part of Europe. It is presumed that they had many settlements in the \u017dumberak Mountains, since mint was discovered in Samobor. Under the Oki\u0107 castle, in the forest of Jama near Podgra\u0111e, a man found 1600 silver Celtic coins. These coins are now called Samobors. ===Roman period=== In 35 - 33 BC the \u017dumberak Mountains became part of the Roman Republic, later empire, province of Pannonia. The most important remains are several graveyards dating from 1st century AD found in the central \u017dumberak Mountains, in villages of Gornja Vas and Bratelji. People buried in those graveyards belonged to the Celtic tribe of Latobics. Many glass containers were found in these graves. These containers were produced in northern Italy, and they are proof that people in the \u017dumberak Mountains had a powerful economy at that time. ===Middle Ages=== After the decline of the Roman Empire, numerous Germanic and Slavic tribes passed across the Pannonian Plain. Almost nothing is known when the Croats came to the \u017dumberak Mountains. The earliest written texts and archaeological finds enlighten the history of the \u017dumberak Mountains from the 12th century on. At that time the \u017dumberak Mountains were the border between the Croatian-Hungarian Kingdom and the Holy Roman Empire. ===Early modern period=== Colonization of \u017dumberak with Vlachs and Uskoks begins 1526.Arnold Suppan, Maximilian Graf From the Austrian Empire to Communist East Central Europe, 2010, https://books.google.hr/books/about/From_the_Austrian_Empire_to_Communist_Ea.html?id=RPD_5vMCRroC&redir;_esc=y #page=58,59 ===Uskoks=== The isolated region on the Croatian side has always had a low population. In 1530, the immigration of Uskoks started, which lasted until the 17th century, which brought a large population of \u0160tokavian speakers to the region. The Uskoks in this area were led by the Deli\u0161imunovi\u0107 family who were counts in Kostanjevac. The \u017dumberak Mountains were then part of Austrian Military Frontier, created by the Habsburgs to serve as a defensive buffer between their empire and the Ottoman Empire. Uskoks from this area, were the only military personnel on the Military frontier, that weren't living close to the border itself, the \u017dumberak Mountains themselves were an enclave within Banovina and did not directly border the Ottoman Empire, so they had to walk for half a day or longer to their posts in Ogulin, Cazin, Biha\u0107 etc. 500 Uskoks from the \u017dumberak Mountains fought in the Battle of Sisak. They had huge losses for their standard, losing 40 soldiers in crucial mission of taking over the bridge over Odra river.http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:doc-IN5KZOA6, retrieved from dlib.si on 2014-04-23 http://www.zgodovina.eu/slovenci/bitka_pri_sisku.htmretrieved on 2014-04-23 In the year 1545. they were called by citizens of Zagreb, to defend the city from the Ottomans because the regular army under the leadership of Croatian Ban was heavily defeated in Hrvatsko Zagorje. As we know Zagreb was never occupied by the Ottomans.http://www.zumberacki-vikarijat.com/zumberacka- povijest/retrieved on 2014-04-23 ====Language and religion==== Because of the immigration of Uskoks, the region is the intersection of all three Croatian dialects. The descendants of Uskoks who are \u0160tokavian speakers are the majority in the \u017dumberak Mountains. The \u017dumberak Uskoks were mostly Orthodox Christians of the Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107, but during 17th and 18th centuries came under the Union with Rome and became Greek Catholic, so there are more Greek Catholic churches in the \u017dumberak Mountains than Latin Catholic churches (approx. 2 to 1). ===Mass emigrations=== Mass emigrations started in the 19th century, when Military frontier was disestablished. People in the \u017dumberak Mountains were no longer needed in the army. Since army salaries, which were main source of wealth, were not coming any more to the \u017dumberak Mountains. This was the main reason why people fell to poverty and started immigrating to the United States. ===World War II=== World War II in Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941 with the invasion by Nazi Germany. Soon after that, the Croatian part of the \u017dumberak Mountains became a part of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), a World War II puppet state of Nazi Germany and Italy, with the western part being directly occupied by Italy. The Slovenian part was annexed directly to the Third Reich. The resistance movement in the \u017dumberak Mountains began when Partisans from 1st Zagreb Partisan Detachment came to this area. Matija Gubec Partisan detachment was established here in August 1941, However it was quickly destroyed. In 1942 partisans from Kordun managed to attract local people to join the resistance, so in 1942 \u017dumberak-Pokuplje partisan detachment was established. Later they merged with First Croatian proleterian battalion in famous XIII. proleterian brigade Rade Kon\u010dar. That brigade managed to liberate Kra\u0161i\u0107 in January 1943, which was a great victory for Partisan movement, since North-West Croatia was considered to be NDH stronghold. Many villages were completely burned and destroyed by the fascists, because their inhabitants allegedly helped the partisans. \u017dumberak was finally liberated on 9 May 1945, by the 10th division of Yugoslav People's Army. The \u017dumberak Mountains are the site of the Jazovka Pit, location of a World War II massacre of retreating Ustasha soldiers and civilians mostly from hospitals in Zagreb by the communists, not partisans from \u017dumberak-Pokuplje partisan detachment, or local people.http://www.mojzumberak.com/Povijest__umberka/_umberak_za_vrijeme_II__svjets/_umberak_za_vrijeme_ii__svjets.html/retrieved on 2014-04-24 ===In SFRY=== In the nineteen-sixties and nineteen-seventies, the second mass emigration started, mostly to Germany. \u017dumberak-Gorjanci memorial area was established in 1971. ===Modern Croatia=== In 1991 area of the \u017dumberak Mountains became a part of independent Croatia and Slovenia. A military complex near the top of Trdina Peak, created by the Yugoslav People's Army, has been a subject of a dispute between the two new countries since the 1990s because it is held by the Slovenian army, but the complex is actually located on Croatian soil. Escalation was prevented due to amicable diplomacy. Both, Slovenia, and Croatia, are members of the European Union, and it is expected that Croatia will soon join Schengen area, so there will be no actual border in the \u017dumberak Mountains. ==Conservation and threats== The biggest threats to the range are deforestation and illegal dumping of waste. Some argue that Kr\u0161ko nuclear power plant is endangering the northern parts of the range, but it's not scientifically proven Most of the Croatian part of the range was protected as Nature park \u017dumberak-Samoborsko gorje by Croatian parliament Sabor, on 28 May 1999. which is since 2012. Natura 2000 site Some areas inside the park itself are specially protected. ==List of protected areas== ===Croatia=== *Nature park \u017dumberak-Samoborsko gorje **Significant landscape Slapnica **Significant landscape Oki\u0107 **Special nature reserve (forest) Japeti\u0107 *Nature monument Grgos cave *Park-forest Tepec and Stra\u017enik *Special botanical reserve Smerovi\u0161\u0107e *Natura 2000 Vugrin cave ===Slovenia=== *Natura 2000 Gorjanci-Radoha *Ecologically important area (EPO) Gorjanci *Nature reserve of old-growth forest at Trdina Peak *Nature reserve of old- growth forest at Ravna Gora *Natural value of national important Kobila ==Gallery== File:Kapela_sv_ilije_na_sv_geri_200901.JPG|St. Elijah chapel on Sveta Gera File:Okic.jpg|Oki\u0107 File:Pleterje.jpg|Pleterje Charterhouse, Carthusian monastery File:Plesivica_from_Japetic.jpg|Ple\u0161ivica, view from Japeti\u0107 File:Valvasor_-_Grad_\u017dumberk.jpg|Sichelberg, fortress from 13th century File:Gorjanci_kosenica_1.jpg|View towards Sveta Gera File:Cerkev_sv._Miklav\u017ea,_Gorjanci.JPG|St. Nicholas church in Gorjanci File:Southern_part_of_mrzlo_polje.jpg|southern part of Mrzlo polje File:Mrzlopoljepogledzima.JPG|Mrzlo Polje File:Krvavi_kamen.jpg|Blood stone (Krvavi kamen) File:Minutnik.jpg|Minutnik spring == References == ==External links== Category:Mountain ranges of Croatia Category:Mountain ranges of Slovenia Category:Nature parks of Croatia Category:Dinaric Alps Category:Natura 2000 in Slovenia Category:Croatia\u2013Slovenia border Category:Geography of Zagreb County ",
