    "text": "Ezekiel 38 is the thirty-eighth chapter of the Book of Ezekiel in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet/priest Ezekiel, and is one of the Books of the Prophets. This and the following chapter form a section dealing with \"Gog, of the land of Magog\". ==Text== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, that is, the Ezekiel Scroll from Masada (Mas 1d; MasEzek; 1\u201350 CE) with extant verses 1\u20134, 7\u20138.Dead sea scrolls - EzekielMas 1d at the Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). ==War of Ezekiel 38\u201339== The account of the War of Ezekiel 38\u201339 or the War of Gog and Magog in chapters 38 and 39 details how Gog of Magog, meaning \"Gog from the Land of Magog\" or \"Gog from the Land of Gog\" (the syllable ma being treated as equivalent to \"land\" Pulpit Commentary on Ezekiel 38, accessed 1 January 2020), and his hordes from the north will threaten and attack the restored land of Israel. The chapters describe how God will make his presence known through an earthquake, and send torrential rains, hailstone, fire, and sulfur - subsequently destroying Gog and Magog. Following the defeat of Gog, God will establish a new Temple where he will dwell forever with his people (chapters 40-48).Bullock, p.301 Theologian David Petersen refers to an underlying theological message, that even so fearsome an enemy as this is ultimately under the control of the God of Israel, since it is God himself who says to Gog, \"I will bring you against my land\".Petersen, p.158 ==Verse 2== : \"Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him\" (NKJV) * \"Son of man\" (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05df\u05be\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd -): this phrase is used 93 times to address Ezekiel. * \"Rosh\" (Hebrew: \u05e8\u05d0\u05e9 : can also be translated as \"head\" (of human and animal); \"top\" (of the mountain); \"beginning\" (of time); \"river-head\"; \"chief\" (as in \"chief-prince\", \"chief-priest\", head of the family). In conjunction to the preceding word \"prince\", most English Bibles translates them as \"chief prince.\"The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha, Augmented Third Edition, New Revised Standard Version, Indexed.
