    "text": "Stephen Carl Milne is an American mathematician who works in the fields of analysis, analytic number theory, and combinatorics. Milne received a bachelor's degree from San Diego State University in 1972 and a Ph.D. from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 1976. His thesis, Peano curves and smoothness of functions, was written under Adriano M. Garsia. From 1976 to 1978 he was a Gibbs Instructor at Yale University. Milne taught at Texas A&M; University, UCSD, the University of Kentucky, and Ohio State University, where he became in 1982 an associate professor and in 1985 a full professor. Milne works on algebraic combinatorics, classical analysis, special functions, analytic number theory, and Lie algebras (generalizations of the Macdonald identities). From 1981 to 1983 he was a Sloan Fellow. In 2007 he was the joint recipient with Heiko Harborth of the Euler Medal. In 2012 Milne was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society ==Selected publications== * *with Glenn Lilly: * * ==References== ==External links== *Homepage at Ohio State University Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:Living people Category:University of California, San Diego alumni Category:Ohio State University faculty Category:Combinatorialists Category:Mathematical analysts Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
