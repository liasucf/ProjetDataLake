    "text": "The Revelators is the third and final studio album by Australian blues-rock band The Revelators. The album was released 23 September 2002. The band considers this 'their true debut'. Camilleri said \"This is the evolution of being a band. It\u2019s about trying to create a standard of music that\u2019s as good as the music we love.\" Unlike the band's previous albums, this album contains mostly original tracks. Joe Camilleri said; \u201cWe wrote a whole bunch of songs for the record,but some didn\u2019t make the cut. It\u2019s always a tricky thing, you think they\u2019re all beautiful. Some songs are really good but they don\u2019t fit the record.\u201d The album was officially launched on 4 October 2002 at Melbourne's Corner Hotel. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2003, the album was nominated for ARIA Award for Best Blues and Roots Album losing to Up All Night by The Waifs. == Track listing == ; CD track listing # \"That's What I'd Give (For Your Love)\" # \"Heart Like a Wheel\" (Anna McGarrigle) # \"Here We Go Again\" # \"The Bottle and its Slave\" # \"Floating Bridge\" # \"Key to the Heart\" (Doug Sahm) # \"When the Spell is Broken\" # \"One Mo' Time\" (Eddie Hinton) # \"Must've Seen a Raven\" # \"Missing You\" # \"Hell to Pay\" # \"Honey Bee\" # \"Ruler of My Heart\" (Allen Toussaint) ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | 23 September 2002 | CD, Digital Download | Head Records / Shock Records | HEAD031 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * \"The Revelators\" at discogs.com Category:2002 albums Category:The Revelators albums Category:Albums produced by Joe Camilleri ",
