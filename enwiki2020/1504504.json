As well as the parish church of St Nicholas the village also has a second church built in 1874, the Radford Semele Baptist Church. == History == A poorly preserved Roman villa was excavated in 1974 at NGR SP 342624 near Pounce Hill Farm, approximately south of the village.http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk The village is named after a family from Saint-Pierre-de-Semilly in Normandy - they were lords of the manor in around 1120. The old Weedon to Leamington Spa line used to run through the village but in the late 1960s the line was closed to passengers. The site of where the old line used to be is now a new cycleway as part of The National Cycle Network. == Pubs == The village has a 16th-century pub called The White Lion situated on the main road running through the village. On 2 February 2006 the pub caught alight, ruining the thatched roof and interior. As of January 2011 the pub is open again. == St Nicholas Church == St Nicholas Church in 2005 St Nicholas Church following fire of 2008 St Nicholas Church, a Grade II listed building, caught fire on 16 March 2008 and all that remained was the tower and shell of the building. The fire was initially not considered suspicious; however, since there is evidence that there was a break-in on the night of the fire, it is believed to have been arson, following failed attempts at several other churches nearby. The church has since been restored and was reopened on 15 May 2013. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Villages in Warwickshire ",
