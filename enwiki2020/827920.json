    "text": "B36 T\u00f3rshavn () is a Faroese semi professional football club based in the capital of T\u00f3rshavn, playing in the Faroe Islands Premier League, the top tier of Faroese football. B36 T\u00f3rshavn has always played its home games in Gundadalur. Originally all Faroese football teams played on gravel grounds, but starting in the late 1980s the grounds were changed into second generation artificial turf. All the artificial pitches have been changed into third generation artificial turf, approved by FIFA. Today B36 T\u00f3rshavn is among the most successful football clubs in the Faroe Islands, having won the Faroe Islands Premier League 11 times, the Faroese Cup 6 times and the Faroese Super Cup once. The club also has a women's section, which is currently in the process of rebuilding. B36 T\u00f3rshavn is one of the biggest football clubs in the Faroe Islands, and is known for playing technical and positive football. ==History== ===Founding=== B36 T\u00f3rshavn was officially founded on 28 March 1936, but had already been playing matches since 1935. The capital was growing, and there was a lot of interest in football. B36 was founded by young people who wanted to play football, but had no opportunity to play for the existing club, HB T\u00f3rshavn. The initiative was taken by an entrepreneur called Niels Ejdesgaard, who became the first chairman of the new football club. When B36 was founded, they battled with local rivals for the rights to the Gundadalur Stadium, although both teams used the venue and played a number of derby matches there during that initial season. The conflict was solved by the mayor of T\u00f3rshavn, who decided that the stadium was to be shared equally between the two clubs. In 1946 the club were celebrated as national champions for the first time, and in 1965 the club won its first national cup. ===Hard times=== In 1962, B36 T\u00f3rshavn celebrated its fifth national championship, but dark times were to follow. The club would wait 35 years for its next national championship. To make matters worse, rival team HB T\u00f3rshavn experienced a lot of success in the same period. In the middle of the 1980s, B36 T\u00f3rshavn was relegated twice from the best division. Then in 1987, Kristian \u00e1 Neystab\u00f8 took over as chairman and Kjartan Mohr as cashier. They took on the task of rebuilding the club, and succeeded in making a turnaround. The results improved, and the cup was won in 1991, although the National Championship was lost in the final match that same year. Then, in 1997, the club celebrated its first National Championship in 35 years. Since then, B36 T\u00f3rshavn has been five time champions, and have won the cup three times. ===Local rivalry=== In the last 20\u201325 years, the local rivalry with HB T\u00f3rshavn has increased, and now the two clubs are about equal in strength. In 2018, the teams fought a fierce cup final, which B36 T\u00f3rshavn won on penalties, after one of the most dramatic cup finals ever at The Faroe Islands. After two red cards in the end of the match, B36 T\u00f3rshavn was playing 9 against 11 from the stoppage time in the ordinary match and through all the extended time. In the 95th minute, B36 T\u00f3rshavn equalized to 2\u20132 with the last shot in the ordinary match from the youngster Hannes Agnarson, and went on to keep HB T\u00f3rshavn from scoring. This 9 against 11 was a repetition of the previous years 2nd leg of the cup semi finals, where B36 T\u00f3rshavn also played with 9 men in all the extended time and about 20 minutes of the ordinary time. Despite being down with 2 men, B36 T\u00f3rshavn won the match 3\u20132, when club legend R\u00f3aldur Jacobsen scored from 72 meters in the last minute. ===Players abroad=== Normally Faroese players who move abroad to play football are youngsters who join foreign clubs as academy players, but recently B36 T\u00f3rshavn has sold two senior players to Norwegian football teams. After last season the Faroese international defender Odmar F\u00e6r\u00f8 was sold to Hamarkameratene, where he now is playing regularly. Likewise, the former Faroe Islands national under-21 football team player Meinhard E. Olsen was sold to Kristiansund BK after last season. He is now working on establishing himself as a regular first team player. In June 2019, he made his debut on the Faroe Islands national football team in a match against Spain. ===International players=== B36 T\u00f3rshavn regularly delivers players to The Faroese National teams. Most recently, \u00c1rni Frederiksberg and Andrias Eriksen were called up for the home matches against Spain and Norway. Former international players in the current team are: Jonas Tor Naes (56 matches), R\u00f3aldur Jakobsen (6 matches), Erling D. Jacobsen (5 matches). Alex Mellemgaard and Trygvi Askham have played one international match, and Eli F. Nielsen and S\u00edmun R\u00f3gvi Hansen have been called up, but not fielded, on the Faroese National Team. Bjarni Petersen, Magnus H. Jacobsen, Hannes Agnarsson, Hugin Samuelsen, Benjamin Heinesen and Erlendur Magnusson play, or have played, on The Faroese U21 National Team. ===International matches=== Clubs in the Faroe Islands first took part in European competitions in 1992, after the Faroe Islands Football Association became a member of UEFA in 1990. B36 was drawn against Avenir Beggen in the Cup winners Cup Qualifying round in 1992. They came close, but didn't make it through to the first round after a 1\u20130 loss and a 1\u20131 draw at home. In 2005/06, the team reached the second round in the UEFA Cup after defeating \u00cdBV Vestmannaeyar of Iceland 3\u20132 on aggregate. In the second round, they narrowly lost to Danish Superliga-club FC Midtjylland 1\u20132 in the away leg and drew 2\u20132 at home. The team reached the second qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League in 2006/07 after defeating Birkirkara FC of Malta 5\u20132 on aggregate and were eliminated in second qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League, losing both matches to Fenerbah\u00e7e 4\u20130 and 5\u20130. In the 2018\u201319 UEFA Europa League, B36 reached the second qualifying round, after defeating St Joseph's Gibraltar on penalties in the preliminary round, after 2\u20132 on aggregate. The team also made it through the first qualifying round by defeating OFK Titograd from Montenegro after a 0\u20130 draw at home and a 2\u20131 victory away. In the second round, B36 T\u00f3rshavn was up against Be\u015fikta\u015f Istanbul. That opposition was too strong, and the matches ended 0\u20132 and 0\u20136. ==Current squad== ==Honours== * Faroe Islands Premier League: 11 ** 1946, 1948, 1950, 1959, 1962, 1997, 2001, 2005, 2011, 2014, 2015 * Faroe Islands Cup: 6 ** 1965, 1991, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2018 * Faroe Islands Super Cup: 1 ** 2007 * 1. deild: 1 ** 1985 ==UEFA club competition record== ===Overview=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
