    "text": "The FIS Skimuseum Dam\u00fcls is a skiing museum located in Dam\u00fcls in the Austrian state of Vorarlberg. It is accommodated in the Kulisse Pfarrhof and displays exhibitions about local history and winter sports. After the exhibition was completely redesigned in the summer of 2017, it was certified by the FIS and remains Vorarlberg\u2019s only FIS ski museum. == The building == The Dam\u00fcls parsonage is located prominently, directly below the church of St. Nikolaus in Dam\u00fcls and had been empty for several years. On the basis of an initiative of Christian Lingenh\u00f6le, the two buildings (house and stable) were adapted accordingly and opened after minor alterations in the summer of 2013 as \"Kulisse Pfarrhof\". == The exhibition == The museum tackles the village's 700-year history as well as its 100-year history of skiing. Dam\u00fcls is one of the few original settlements of the Walser people, dating back to the 14th century. Exhibits, primarily collected by Christian Lingenh\u00f6le, provide insights into the rich history of skiing in the village. The museum features an extensive collection of historic and modern skis including original racing skis from 1957 by ski legend Toni Sailer. In addition to skis, the focus is also on winter-sports equipment and memorabilia, clothing, photographs, literature and documents. Some curiosities illustrate the way in which past generations have experimented with skiing. A library and a historical archive are currently being built. === Special exhibitions === * 2019: \"Pioneering spirit\".
