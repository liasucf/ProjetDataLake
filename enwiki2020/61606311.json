The property is a gentleman farmer's estate, with a main house, barn, hog shed, and other farm outbuildings. The principal structures are built out of stone, with the house having terra cotta tile elements as well. It is Craftsman in style, with a shallow pitch gable roof that has deep eaves and exposed rafters. The estate was developed in the 1930s by John Hugh Carmichael and his wife Lily; she sold the property after he died in 1958. The property is a good example of rural Craftsman-style gentleman's farm. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Pulaski County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:American Craftsman architecture in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1935 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Pulaski County, Arkansas ",
