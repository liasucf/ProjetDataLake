    "text": "The North Hollywood\u2013Pasadena Transit Line is a proposed bus rapid transit line in the Metro Busway network in Los Angeles, California. It is planned to operate between Pasadena and the North Hollywood Metro Station in the San Fernando Valley where it will connect with the Metro B Line on the Metro Rail system and the G Line Metro Busway.https://thesource.metro.net/2019/07/24/noho-to-pasadena-brt-project- community-open-house-to-be-held-on- aug-7/https://thesource.metro.net/2019/06/28/scoping-meetings-for-noho-to- pasadena-bus-rapid-transit-project-begin-july-9/ The project completed its scoping phase in 2019 and Metro plans to complete the project by 2024. It is part of Metro's Twenty-eight by '28 initiative. No current Metro Rail conversion plans are scheduled, although the city of Glendale is proposing a street car service in their downtown, connecting the region with \"last mile/first mile\" service. The east to west/west to east route will have signal priority at traffic lights and will have a dedicated right of way. Metro reports the cost is $448 million. Metro received comments it would have to accommodate the annual Rose Parade route on Colorado boulevard. Metro reports it would carry 18,000 yearly riders by 2035. Destinations along the route include Old Pasadena, The Paseo, and Pasadena City College and Americana at Brand outdoor mall. It would also connect with Warner Bros. Studios, Walt Disney Studios, The Burbank Studios and Universal Studios. ==Initial Alternative Analysis== The bus route is planned to connect L.A.'s San Fernando Valley communities of Burbank, North Hollywood and Glendale with San Gabriel Valley community of Pasadena thru Eagle Rock. A mostly street option, an all freeway option on SR 134 freeway, or a hybrid of both. Metro\u2019s Board of Directors approved advancing a mostly street-running route with some variations for more study as part of the project\u2019s Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR). Community meetings are taking place for metro to weigh routes environmental issues and any other issue that could be address during the DEIR until the end of 2019.http://metro.legistar1.com/metro/attachments/1b3d478e-5c37-48a1-99b3-063cbd7695f2.pdf *Pasadena/Eagle Rock In the east portion, the route begins between Del Mar station and Memorial Park station on the L Line. Heads west along Colorado Boulevard to Eagle Rock. Metro proposes multiple options on how it passes Eagle Rock. West thru Wilson Avenue, or west on Colorado St. Metro recently added a third route for the DEIR, a SR 134 freeway median route as it heads into Glendale. *Glendale/Burbank After Eagle Rock, it will enter Glendale on Broadway or Colorado St and head north for a mile on Central or Brand Avenue thru downtown Glendale before heading west on Glenoaks Boulevard into Burbank. The route makes a southwest turn on Olive Avenue. The same intersection where the downtown Burbank Metrolink station is located. *North Hollywood Leaving the Metrolink station in Burbank, Metro's main option has it heading west on Olive Avenue and Riverside Drive until reaching Lankershim Boulevard and the B Line's North Hollywood station. Other North Hollywood routes optioned from the Burbank Metrolink station are west on Chandler Boulevard, or Magnolia Boulevard with the same terminus. All are under the technical study for possible DEIR.https://media.metro.net/projects_studies/brt/images/AlternativesAnalysisReport_2019-0416.pdf ==Alternatives== Metro Express 501 began operation in 2016 between North Hollywood Metro station and a stop near Pasadena Del Mar station. ==References== ==External links== *Project website Category:Los Angeles Metro Busway projects Metro Rapid Metro Rapid Metro Rapid Category:Bus rapid transit in California Category:Proposed railway lines in California Category:Transportation in Los Angeles Category:Transportation in the San Fernando Valley ",
