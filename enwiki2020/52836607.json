He was also an excellent connoisseur of Greek and Hebrew. He wrote a number of books, most lost, especially on astrology and antiquities. He died in the hometown in 1551. His main treatise on astrology, Coelum sydereum, was published posthumously in Como in 1699, a century after it was written. This work in seven books is a large discussion of the influence and effectiveness of the constellations. According to Cigalini \u00abthe operations of the stars are according to nature, not according to mathematics.\u00bbCoelum sydereum, p. 176. == Works == * *Coelum sydereum, Como, 1699 == See also == * Gerolamo Cardano == References == Category:Italian astrologers Category:16th-century astrologers Category:Italian humanists Category:16th-century Italian physicians Category:1551 deaths Category:1489 births Category:People from Como ",
