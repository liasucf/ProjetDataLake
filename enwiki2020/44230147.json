    "text": "The New York Mets farm system consists of eight Minor League Baseball affiliates across the United States and in the Dominican Republic. Five teams are owned by the major league club, while three\u2014the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, Columbia Fireflies, and Brooklyn Cyclones\u2014are independently owned. The Mets have been affiliated with the Double-A Binghamton Rumble Ponies of the Eastern League since 1992, making it the longest-running active affiliation in the organization among teams not owned by the Mets. Their newest affiliate is the Syracuse Mets of the International League which became the Mets' Triple-A club in 2019. The longest affiliation in team history was the 38-year relationship with the Triple-A International League's Norfolk Tides from 1969 to 2006. Geographically, New York's closest domestic affiliate is the Brooklyn Cyclones of the Class A Short Season New York\u2013Penn League which is approximately away. New York's furthest domestic affiliates are the St. Lucie Mets and GCL Mets some away. ==1990\u2013present== The current structure of Minor League Baseball has been in effect since the 1990 season when the Class A level was subdivided for a second time with the creation of Class A-Advanced. The Rookie level consists of domestic and foreign circuits. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\";\"|Year ! style=\";\"|Triple-A ! style=\";\"|Double-A ! style=\";\"|Class A-Advanced ! style=\";\"|Class A !

The reduction from six classes to four (Triple-A, Double-AA, Class A, and Rookie) was a response to the general decline of the minors throughout the 1950s and early-1960s when leagues and teams folded due to shrinking attendance caused by baseball fans' preference for staying at home to watch MLB games on television. The only change made within the next 27 years was Class A being subdivided for the first time to form Class A Short Season in 1966. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\";\"|Year ! style=\";\"|Triple-A ! style=\";\"|Double-A ! style=\";\"|Class A ! style=\";\"|Class A Short Season ! style=\";\"|Rookie League |- ! 1989 | Tidewater Tides | Jackson Mets | St. Lucie Mets, Columbia Mets | Pittsfield Mets | Kingsport Mets, GCL Mets |- ! 1988 | Tidewater Tides | Jackson Mets | St. Lucie Mets,Rhodes, Beth. \"Mets Announce Purchase Of Admirals; Team's Move To Port St. Lucie Jeopardizes Baseball In Daytona Beach\", Orlando Sentinel, Friday, September 11, 1987.

The Pacific Coast League (PCL) was reclassified from Triple-A to Open in 1952 due to the possibility of becoming a third major league. This arrangement ended following the 1957 season when the relocation of the National League's Dodgers and Giants to the West Coast killed any chance of the PCL being promoted. The 1963 reorganization resulted in the Eastern and South Atlantic Leagues being elevated from Class A to Double-A, five of seven Class D circuits plus the ones in B and C upgraded to A, and the Appalachian League reclassified from D to Rookie. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\";\"|Year ! style=\";\"|Triple-A ! style=\";\"|Double-A ! style=\";\"|Class A ! style=\";\"|Class B ! style=\";\"|Class C ! style=\";\"|Class D |- ! 1962 | align=\"center\"| \u2014 | align=\"center\"| \u2014 | align=\"center\"| \u2014 | align=\"center\"| \u2014 | Santa Barbara Rancheros | Quincy Jets, Auburn Mets, Salisbury Braves |} ==References== == External links == * Major League Baseball Prospect News: New York Mets * Baseball-Reference: New York Mets League Affiliations * BR Bullpen: New York Mets Minor League Affiliates * ",
