The recording did not start until 8:00 P.M. that evening. The anticipation was high for Ton\u00e9x's first live recording. An over capacity crowd of over 3,500 people stood shrieking with applause, eagerly awaiting Ton\u00e9x to emerge from a 9-foot tall music box. From that point\u2026it was on! Ton\u00e9x and a multicultural 40-voice choir called The Peculiar People, a seven piece band, three piece horn section, and four dancers mesmerized the audience for over three hours. They did their best to capture what happened that night. The screams you hear are real, not added. The anointing they experienced that night was real, not contrived. ==Track listing== ;Disc 1: # Yolanda Adams Introduction # Overture # Out the Box # The Trust Theory # Alive (Not Dead) # Alive 2 # Fundamentals # Work On Me # Games # Endangered Species # The Children's Bread # Freestyle \u2014 Church Floor # Real With U (Live) # Taxi Overture # Taxi (Live) # Personal Jesus (Live) # Why?
