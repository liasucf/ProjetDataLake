He published books describing the geography, archeology and history of the areas he explored, which included Greece, Asia Minor, North Africa, Syria and Palestine. ==Biography== From 1840, Guerin was a professor of rhetoric and member of faculty in various colleges and high schools in France and in Algeria. In 1852, he became a member of the French School of Athens. With the financial help of Honor\u00e9 Th\u00e9odoric d'Albert de Luynes he was able to explore Greece and its islands, Asia Minor, Egypt, Nubia, Tunisia, and the Levant. He spent some time as a professor of foreign literature in Lyon and Grenoble, and in 1878 he joined the faculty of the Institut Catholique de Paris. He died on 21 September 1891 in Paris. ==Expeditions== Gu\u00e9rin visited the Holy Land eight times in 1852, 1854, 1863, 1870, 1875, 1882, 1884, and 1888. He won a French Academy of Sciences prize for his 7-volume Geographical, Historical, and Archaeological Description of Palestine. Much of Gu\u00e9rin's seminal work is spent in describing the ruins (khirbas) in those places he visited. ==Works== In his books Guerin writes about the identification and history of archaeological sites, often referring to passages from the Hebrew Bible, Greek mythology, and contemporary explorers and scholars such as Robinson and Titus Tobler. He also quotes from other Jewish sources such as the Mishna and Talmud, as well as Jewish travelers such as Benjamin of Tudela and Isaac Chelo. His published works include: *Voyage dans l\u2019\u00cele de Rhodes et description de cette \u00cele. Paris (1856) *Voyage arch\u00e9ologique dans la r\u00e9gence de Tunis. 2 Bde.
