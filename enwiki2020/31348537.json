He was the city's mayor for two years and served a total of thirty-one years on the Brantford City Council. ==Early life and private career== Max Sherman was born in Toronto, the son of Ben Sherman, who owned and operated Sherman's Hardware for many years. The younger Sherman planned to open his own hardware store in the city, but was diagnosed with tuberculosis only three days before the store's scheduled launch in 1938. As a result, he spent ten months recovering at the Brantford Sanatorium.\"Veteran politician reflects on a full life: Max Sherman's last interview\", Brantford Expositor, 2010, accessed 30 March 2011. He later recounted that his doctor told him, \"You can open your business in three days and die or go to the San, get cured and have a chance at a long, healthy life.\" Reflecting on the situation at age eighty-nine, he said that moving to Brantford was the right choice.Frances Kraft, \"Brantford struggles to maintain Jewish life,\" Canadian Jewish News, 15 July 1999, Volume 29, Issue 28, p. 20; Vincent Ball, \"Brantwood: 90 years of caring,\" Brantford Expositor, 29 December 2003, A3. He was active in Brantford's Jewish community, serving as master of ceremonies at the opening of a new synagogue building in 1948 and chairing B'nai Brith Canada's Brantford lodge (which closed in 1974). He was refused admission into the Brantford chapter of an international service organization in the 1950s because of anti-Semitism, though he chose not to publicize the matter at the time. Many years later, he said that popular opinions had changed significantly in his lifetime and described Brantford as \"a good town to live in.\"Frances Kraft, \"Brantford struggles to maintain Jewish life,\" Canadian Jewish News, 15 July 1999, Volume 29, Issue 28, p. 20. ==Political career== Sherman later started a hardware store in Brantford and became involved in the city's political life.Michael-Allan Marion, \"Temple building to revive glory days,\" Brantford Expositor, 4 September 2004, A1. He first served on city council from 1953 to 1957, when he began a two-year term as mayor. He sought election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1959 provincial election, but was defeated.Sherman later said, perhaps jokingly, that he was relieved not to have won this campaign: \"I couldn't afford it. I had a business to run.\" See Cheryl Bauslaugh, \"Brantford recognizes its longest- serving politician\", Brantford Expositor, accessed 30 March 2011. He served further terms on city council from 1961 to 1964 and from 1976 to 1997.\"Former Mayor Dies,\" Canadian Jewish News, 11 March 2010, Volume 40, Issue 10, p. 2.

The later measure was undertaken, in large part, to improve the environmental condition of the Grand River.City of Brantford: Wall of Recognition: Max Sherman, 2007, accessed 30 March 2011. Sherman helped negotiate the 1980 Brant-Brantford Annexation Agreement, which saw the county shift a piece of its territory to the city. He later said that he regarded the agreement as a success story and criticized popular perceptions that it took place amid acrimony and threats of retribution.Michael-Allan Marion, \"Annexation process was not so bad, say veteran councillors,\" Brantford Expositor, 19 July 2002, A8. Sherman also chaired the Brant County social services committee in the 1980s; in 1985, he criticized county politicians for attempting to cut off most social assistance recipients.Kevin Marron, \"Brant County bid illegal, official say,\" Globe and Mail, 17 May 1985, M4.
