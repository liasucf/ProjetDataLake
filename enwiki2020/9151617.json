    "text": ", also known as Lovely Complex, is a romantic comedy sh\u014djo manga by Aya Nakahara. It was published by Shueisha in Bessatsu Margaret from 2001 to 2006 and collected in 17 tank\u014dbon volumes. The series is about the romance between a tall girl and a short boy who are treated as a comedy duo by their classmates. In 2004, it received the 49th Shogakukan Manga Award for sh\u014djo. The story has been adapted as a live-action movie released in 2006, a 24-episode anime television series broadcast in 2007, and an adventure game released for PlayStation 2 released in 2006. Two drama CDs have also been produced. The manga and the live-action movie are licensed in North America by Viz. A sequel series called Love Com D (or Lovely Complex Deluxe or \"Lovely Complex Two\") began serialization in the May 2009 issue of the bimonthly sh\u014djo manga magazine Deluxe Margaret, focusing on Risa's younger brother. == Plot == Love Com is a love story between a boy and a girl in Sakai, Osaka. The girl, Risa Koizumi, is tall\u2014much taller than the average Japanese girl. The boy, Atsushi \u014ctani, is \u2014way below the height of the average Japanese boy. Because of this, the pair are called the \"All Hanshin Kyojin\" after a popular comedy duo that has a similar height difference. The difference in their heights is extremely exaggerated (in the opening credits of the anime, for example, the top of \u014ctani's head doesn't even reach Risa's chin when it should be approximately level with her mouth.) During summer school, a very tall student named Ryouji Suzuki (from another class) shows up and Risa immediately falls for him because he is tall. There is a girl that Atsushi likes as well, so Risa and Atsushi decide to put aside their differences and help each other get their love interests. Their efforts fail spectacularly as Suzuki and the girl whom \u014ctani had a crush on - Chiharu Tanaka - end up becoming a couple. All is not lost though, since Risa and \u014ctani become close friends. As they get to know each other better, Risa's feelings for Atsushi begin to blossom, and her love life gets complicated from there on. One notable fact about Love Com is that instead of speaking standard Japanese, almost all characters speak in Kansai-ben. Many native Osakan voice actors are employed in the anime. While having one or two characters speaking Kansai-ben is common in many anime shows, having all characters doing so is unusual in media produced for a nationwide audience. == Characters == ; :Drama role by: Ema Fujisawa, : The protagonist, Risa Koizumi is not your average Japanese high school girl. Standing tall, Risa stands taller than the average height of Japanese boys let alone Japanese girls (the average height for a female is ). In the anime she states that she has always been the tallest person in her class. Ironically, her surname means 'small fountain'. She and other characters compare her to a giraffe. Risa can be impulsive and strong-willed at times, and is rarely willing to display her softer side. She had a crush on Suzuki before he started dating Chiharu. : Risa starts developing feelings for \u014ctani and soon admits to herself that she likes him. She then starts trying to confess. Failing the first time, Nobuko and Nakao try to help with Nobuko often giving Risa advice on what to do. Finally she very directly tells him. She immediately regrets it, and tells \u014ctani to pretend it never happened, but in spite of herself she tells \u014ctani once again that she likes him. \u014ctani responds that he cannot see her as a girlfriend yet, so her new goal is to make \u014ctani regret that and make him like her as well. ; :Drama role by: Teppei Koike, , Voice actor for game/drama CD: Takahiro Sakurai : Atsushi \u014ctani is one of the main characters. He is very short for a boy, standing . The average height for a male in Japan is . Like Koizumi, \u014ctani's surname (roughly, \"big valley\") is a pun on his diminutive stature. He can be thoughtless and rude but he is kind and a little silly at heart. Ironically, \u014ctani also happens to be the star player of the school basketball team. He reveals he wants to go to University after graduation to get his teaching certificate. He dreams of teaching basketball to elementary school students. :His ex-girlfriend is Mayu Kanzaki, the manager of his middle-school basketball team. She broke up with him for a much taller boyfriend, and this is one of the reasons \u014ctani is sensitive about his height. He later finds out that his lack of height wasn't the reason that she broke up with him; it was because she was in love with someone else already who just happened to be tall. He doesn't know quite yet how he feels about Risa when she confesses her feelings for him, and responds that he can't see her as a girlfriend (yet). He later realizes that he does care for her, and he kisses her. Later on in the series, \u014ctani gets the wrong idea when Risa keep doing suspicious things with her co-worker Kohori, and then breaks up with her. However, after seeing how devoted she is to him, \u014ctani reconsiders and they make up on Christmas Eve. ; :Drama role by: Nami Tamaki, : Fashionable and charming, Nobu is Risa's best friend. She is generally wiser than Risa or Chiharu in the ways of love, and is always ready to offer her advice. She's usually the one who sets up all the 'alone time' moments with Risa and \u014ctani. Unfortunately her efforts tend to end in failure and Risa returns to her for comfort. She's utterly in love with her boyfriend, Nakao, and is always calling him her 'honey', 'darling', and 'baby'. Whenever Otani upsets Risa, she and Nakao express their disapproval, usually through means of torture and insults. ; :Drama role by: Yusuke Yamazaki, , Voice actor for game/drama CD: Kenjiro Tsuda : Nobu's boyfriend and \u014ctani's best friend. Considerate, sensitive, mild-mannered and easygoing., Nakao is absolutely dedicated to Nobu, and when he is not playing basketball with \u014ctani, he can usually be found helping with her match-making schemes. Despite the fact that Otani is his best friend, Nakao and Nobu-chan are seen multiple times insulting and torturing him, usually after Otani rejects or upsets Risa. ; :Drama role by: Risa Kudo, : One of Risa's closest friends, Chiharu has such a shy, demure personality that she fears most boys her own age. \u014ctani once harbored a crush on her (she resembles Kanzaki, his ex-girlfriend, or vice versa), but Chiharu instead fell for the gentle Suzuki. The two are now a couple. When everybody starts making college plans, Suzuki and Chiharu applied for the same college, but Suzuki got rejected. He sadly tells Chiharu somebody else would be able to protect her. For the first time, Chiharu breaks out of her shy character and violently lifts up a desk and throws at him (narrowly missing), frustrated that Suzuki thinks he can be replaced. They later make up and Suzuki promises to join Chiharu in her new school the next year. ; :Drama role by: Hiro Mizushima, , Voice actor for game/drama CD: Masaya Onosaka : Chiharu's boyfriend. Suzuki's cool demeanor is often mistaken for standoffishness, and so he has few friends. Oblivious to Risa's crush on him, he develops feelings for Chiharu, and eventually asks her out. Like Chiharu, Suzuki is shy and easily embarrassed. When he fails to get into the same university as Chiharu, he promises to try again the year after. ; :, Voice actor for game/drama CD: Ryotaro Okiayu : A handsome, effeminate young man who developed a childhood crush on Risa when she defended him from a gang of bullies. Though he is popular with many of the other girls (dating seven at a time and towards chapter 52 dates 2 more for a total of nine), he says it's all preparation for when he goes out with Risa, despite the fact that she always rejects him. According to Risa, his grandmother is English. It is also suggested that he might have a crush on Seiko. He never tires of insulting Otani, (his most frequently used insult is \"Midget\"), and is constantly pestering Risa about her feelings for him, stating that Otani isn't good enough for her. ; :Drama role by: Mio Kato, : She is \u014ctani's ex-girlfriend. She and Chiharu look very similar, which is the most likely reason that \u014ctani had a crush on Chiharu. They started dating in middle-school, and she was the manager for the school basketball team. She broke up with him because she was in love with someone else who was tall, leaving him completely heartbroken and causing his inferiority complex. :She invites \u014ctani to the team Christmas party, and though \u014ctani accepts, he ends up going to the Umib\u014dzu concert with Risa instead. She then visited \u014ctani's school to see him, but encountered Risa and Nobu. Risa is convinced that \u014ctani is still in love with Mayu, so she goes to clear up a misunderstanding. It is then that Mayu tells him that she did not break up with him because of his height. However, she appears again later, after having broken up with her boyfriend. When she asks to meet up again, he says \"Sorry, I can't because if I do there'll be an idiot who'll cry.\" ; :Drama role by: Shosuke Tanihara, : Student teacher at Risa and \u014ctani's school. Maitake, who prefers the nickname \"Maity\" or \"Mighty\", is taller than Risa and extraordinarily good-looking. He bears a resemblance to \"Cain-sama\", a character in one of Risa's favorite visual novels, and soon acquires a legion of female fans. Gaining affection from Risa, \u014ctani soon becomes jealous and quickly starts to realize his feelings for her. It is later revealed he has a fiance - named Jody - much to the disappointment of his fan club - and that he is Haruka's cousin. ; : : \u014ctani's next door neighbor. She is in love with \u014ctani and brings him milk every day in hopes that he would one day grow taller. She is about the same height as Risa. Mimi harbors a burning hatred and jealousy for Risa because (despite her having the same height issue as Mimi) she had won \u014ctani's heart. She comically switches between her alter egos, acting sweet towards \u014ctani, yet sour to Risa behind his back. Eventually, she accepts that \u014ctani likes Koizumi but swears that she will someday take \u014ctani from Koizumi. ; : : A young student who works part time with Risa in Ikebe. He is notably shorter than her, although slightly taller than \u014ctani (158 cm.), and has distinctive black hair with a red streak. Risa soon discovers that he is also an avid Umibouzu fan. He very soon develops feelings for Risa, who admits to herself that she finds him 'cute'. Against her better judgment, Risa attends an Umib\u014dzu concert with Kohori which leads to complications in her relationship with \u014ctani. He even proclaims his love for Risa, which causes \u014ctani to give him a right hook. Around chapter 60 in the manga, Risa's classmate Abe is shown to have a crush on Kohori and is dating him. ; : : A blonde who has a large crush on \u014ctani. She is transgender and was born a male, and states that God placed her in a wrong body. She prefers to be called Seiko instead of Seishiro (birth name) because it sounds more feminine. She kissed \u014ctani to confess her feelings while she is tending to \u014ctani's injury in the school infirmary. \u014ctani got a shock when he found out Seiko's real sex, but still chooses to be her friend. In the manga, she has a crush on Haruka and confessed to him in the same manner she did with \u014ctani. When Seiko was planning on confessing to a man who saved her from a creeper, her voice became deeper and not \"cute\", therefore Seiko cut her long hair and decided to become \"a dangerous man\", choosing \u014ctani as her master. But then it seemed that only a cold was making Seiko's voice change, and she went back to her chirpy, female self. ; :Drama role by: Susumu Terajima, : A popular rapper whom both Risa and \u014ctani are avid fans of, leading to Nobu's suggestion that the two are compatible. Risa and \u014ctani accidentally cross paths with Umib\u014dzu while on a class trip, and learn that he is actually a devoted family man, with a wife and son with a similar story of how they became a couple. He is named after the mythological creature Umib\u014dzu due to his bald head. ; : : The manager in charge at the restaurant where Risa works. She wears glasses and is quite nosy. When she is intoxicated, she turns wild, and does things that she won't remember the next day. ; : : Homeroom teacher at Risa and \u014ctani's class.
