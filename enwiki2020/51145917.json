    "text": "Dionisio de Herrera was appointed governor of the province of Tegucigalpa on 23 March 1823. The first Congress of Honduras, a constituent assembly convened on 16 September 1824, and effected the union of Comayagua and Tegucigalpa, declaring them alternate capitals of Honduras, and chose Dionisio de Herrera as First Chief of the State of Honduras, with Lieutenant General Jos\u00e9 Justo Milla as his deputy. At the time Honduras was part of the short-lived Federal Republic of Central America, established in 1823. The first constitution of Honduras, dated 11 December 1825, established four-year terms for the head of state, with Herrera's initial term to end on 16 September 1827. He was however unable to finish his term due to a coup d'\u00e9tat. The assembly took the position that his position was provisional. ==Background== The president of the Federal Republic of Central America, Manuel Jos\u00e9 Arce, opposed Herrera and the Liberal Party of Honduras. In October 1826 Arce dissolved Congress and the Senate, trying establish a centralist or unitary system, allying himself with the conservatives, by which he lost the support of his own party, the liberals. This brought him into conflict with both the federal government and the states, denounced by Herrera and Mariano Prado, Chief of State of El Salvador. On 1 November 1826 Herrera was attacked in his house; hired men fired from the street into his bedroom. In December of 1826 the conservative priest excommunicated Herrera, claiming that he was influenced by freemasons and heretics. ==Coup d'\u00e9tat== Arce called on the Honduran army commanded by the deputy chief of state, Jos\u00e9 Justo Milla Pineda, to support Ir\u00edas. On 4 April 1827 the siege of Comayagua began. On 10 May, after 36 days, the square was surrendered by the military chief Fern\u00e1ndez. ==Aftermath== Herrera was taken prisoner May 9, and sent to Guatemala, where he remained in prison for two years. On 15 March 1829 General Francisco Moraz\u00e1n and his army were intercepted by the federal troops of Colonel Prado in Las Charcas. Moraz\u00e1n held a superior position and crushed Prado's army. Later, Moraz\u00e1n moved to recover his former positions in P\u00ednula and Aceytuno, putting him once more in control of Guatemala City, where he finally freed Herrera. ==See also== * Dionisio de Herrera * Francisco Moraz\u00e1n * Jos\u00e9 Justo Milla * 1963 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat * 2009 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat ==References== * * Category:Conflicts in 1827 1827 1827 coup Category:1827 in politics Category:1820s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts ",
