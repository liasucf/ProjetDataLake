    "text": "Futboll Klub Dinamo Tirana is an Albanian football club based in the capital city Tirana. They currently compete in the Kategoria e Par\u00eb and they play their home games primarily at the Selman St\u00ebrmasi Stadium, as well as other grounds in the city. Founded in 1950 during the communist regime, the club was historically affiliated to the Interior Ministry and having won 18 National Championships, it is considered to be the second most decorated club after local rivals KF Tirana. ==History== The club was officially founded on 3 March 1950 by the Interior Ministry of Albania during the communist regime under dictator Enver Hoxha. They won four consecutive championships from 1950 to 1953. During this time, Dinamo recorded a hot streak of 25 consecutive wins, a record in Albanian football and 4th longest domestic winning streak in Europe. In 1967, Dinamo won its 9th championship by leaving Tirana, then 17 N\u00ebntori, one point behind, who was expelled for the tournament three weeks before the end. This championship is not officially recognized by UEFA, however. In 1989, Dinamo eventually finished third in the league which was won by 17 N\u00ebntori, which made eligible to play in European Cup Winners' Cup for the third time in their history. In the preliminary round of the tournament the team faced Chernomorets Burgas, losing the first leg 1\u20133 (Demollari scoring the lone goal for Dinamo Tirana) but winning the second 4\u20130 at home, thus recording its biggest win in a UEFA club competition. The team then was eliminated in the first round by Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti despite winning the first leg in Tirana 1-0. Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti won the second leg 2-0. In 1995, the team were renamed KS Olimpik Tirana to leave behind the \"communist past\", but the club returned to their original name two years later. After finishing third in the table in 2005\u201306 season, Dinamo Tirana named Faruk Sejdini as their new coach. One of Albania's best teachers of footballing fundamentals, he had a spell at the club last term before being dismissed by president Besnik Sulaj. Having returned following a spell at Shkumbini Peqin, Sejdini said: \"It's nice to be back.\" On 23 October 2006, he was fired. At the start of the 2007\u201308 season, Agim Canaj took over as head coach, replacing Ilir Daja who led Dinamo towards the championship title, after a dramatic win against Partizani 2\u20131 in the final match, playing for 36 minutes with 9 players. In the summer of 2008, Ilir Daja moved into a position as director in order to make place for Marcelo Javier Zuleta from Argentina. The Argentinian coach also brought with him four Argentinian players; goalkeeper Daniel Bertoya, defender Alejandro Palladino, midfielder Agust\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez, and striker Cristian Campozano. Zuleta only lasted for the first Champions League qualification match against Bosnians FK Modri\u010da before he was replaced as coach by Artan M\u00ebrgjyshi, for only one match. Together with Zuleta, the four Argentinian players also left the club. After M\u00ebrgjyshi left, Zlatko Dali\u0107, the actual coach of Croatia, was appointed as new coach for Dinamo. He signed a two-year contract with the club. That deal was broken when Dinamo lost its second game in the re-beginning of the 2008\u201309 season against Partizani. Shk\u00eblqim Mu\u00e7a was then appointed manager of the club five days after of Zlatko Dali\u0107's leave. In the 2009\u201310 season, Dinamo won the championship again, registering its 18th success. In 2011\u201312 season, the club experienced its worst period of all time, finishing last in the league with 13 points from 26 matches, winning only 3 time. They were relegated to the Albanian First Division for the first time in their history. Since the 2012\u201313 season, the club have played in the Albanian First Division and have risked relegation to the third tier several times. ==Stadium== FK Dinamo Tirana has historically played at Selman Stermasi Stadium which was also known as Stadiumi i Dinamo when it first became a stadium. FK Dinamo Tirana now plays on Internacional Complex, Pez\u00eb Helm\u00ebs. This is also known as the main field for FC Internacional Tirana and the training ground for FK Kuk\u00ebsi and FK Partizani Tirana. The stadium is a 1,000 seater stadium and FK Dinamo Tirana also has a training field known as Kompleksi Dinamo in Tirana by the Grand Park of Tirana and next to the Tirana Olympic Park. ==Supporters== The \"Blue Boys\" are an Ultras group for the Albanian football team, Dinamo Tirana. The group were formed in 2008 and have gained hundreds of members in its first few years. They organise meetings and trips to matches in Tirana and also away matches in Albania and even abroad. They promote Dinamo Tirana to the local public and influence fans of the club in a number of ways.Dinamo Tirana at Weltfussball.de ==Honours== ===Domestic=== 20px Kategoria Superiore * Winners (18): 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956, 1960, 1966\u201367, 1972\u201373, 1974\u201375, 1975\u201376, 1976\u201377, 1979\u201380, 1985\u201386, 1989\u201390, 2001\u201302, 2007\u201308, 2009\u201310 * Runners-up (9): 1954, 1957, 1961, 1962\u201363, 1963\u201364, 1970\u201371, 1980\u201381, 1984\u201385, 2003\u201304 20px Albanian Cup * Winners (13): 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1960, 1970\u201371, 1973\u201374, 1977\u201378, 1981\u201382, 1988\u201389, 1989\u201390, 2002\u201303 * Runners-up (6): 1972\u201373, 1976\u201377, 1978\u201379, 1981\u201382, 2001\u201302, 2003\u201304, 2010\u201311 Albanian Supercup * Winners: 1989, 2008 * Runners-up: 1990, 2002, 2003, 2010 ==KS Dinamo Tirana in Europe== As of July 2, 2009. {| class=\"wikitable\" !
