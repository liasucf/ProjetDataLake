The \"Your Body\" video starts with Pretty Ricky on the beach saying \"Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir, yes sir,\" then they start singing, rapping and dancing the \"Your Body\" dance. Then the scene changes to them driving on the highway, and then Spectacular and Slick rap while they are walking along the beach. Spectacular Shirtless Rapping.

At the end of the video Slick is shown still dancing and laughing while his brothers get in the car and the scene changes to show Spec following the camera and smiling and being silly while Pleasure shakes his head walking off. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2005) !align=\"left\"|Peak Position |- |- |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles (The Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|37 |- |- |- |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Country !Date !Format !Label |- | | June 15, 2005 | Urban contemporary | Atlantic |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2005 singles Category:Pretty Ricky songs Category:Song recordings produced by Jim Jonsin Category:Songs written by Static Major Category:2005 songs Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:Dirty rap songs ",
