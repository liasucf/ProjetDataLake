He made his name as a producer and director on productions such as Angels, Compact and Z-Cars; but his most impressive credit was perhaps as producer of the highly popular dramatisation of Poldark by Winston Graham. Morris Barry had a strong connection with Doctor Who as well. He directed three stories during the Patrick Troughton years: The Moonbase (1967), The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967) and The Dominators (1968). He was known by the cast and crew of Doctor Who to be a somewhat strict and uncompromising director of the old school, but The Moonbase and The Tomb of the Cybermen are often spoken of as classics of 1960s Doctor Who. He was also well known for carrying a music stand to place his script on during rehearsals.Commentary 2, The Tomb of the Cybermen, Audio commentary recorded 2010 He also appeared as an actor in the Doctor Who story The Creature from the Pit in 1979, playing the scientist Tollund.
