Drezner: Nonresident Senior Fellow, Foreign Policy, Project on International Order and Strategy, Brookings Institution. ==Education== Drezner graduated from Williams College with a B.A. degree in political economy in 1990. He received his M.A. and Ph.D. degree from Stanford University. ==Political views== Drezner rarely discusses his political loyalties, but in 2011 he wrote: \"I find liberals write 'even conservative Dan Drezner...' while conservatives often deploy terms like 'academic elitist' or 'RINO.' In my case, at this point in time, I believe that last appellation to be entirely fair and accurate. I'm not a Democrat, and I don't think I've become more liberal over time.\" Drezner supported the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, writing that \"a successful invasion not only eliminates the Iraqi threat, but over the long run it reduces the Arab resentment that feeds Al- Qaeda.\" Drezner was a signatory to a March 2016 open letter by Republican national security community members that opposed Donald Trump as Republican nominee for U.S. President. Drezner announced in July 2017 that he is no longer part of the Republican party. In October 2017, he recommended to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to resign.The sooner Rex Tillerson resigns as secretary of state the better (October 18, 2017) ==Books and commentary== Drezner has published columns, essays, and op-eds in many media outlets, including The New Republic,Author: Daniel W.

Drezner Professor of International Politics, Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, Council on Foreign Relations. Drezner's 2007 book, All Politics Is Global: Explaining International Regulatory Regimes, looked at international economic regulations and concluded that these were under the control of the most wealthy and powerful nations, as they had been in the past. G. John Ikenberry in Foreign Affairs comments: \"His main contribution, however, is to explode a popular notion of globalization and thereby to set an agenda for the study of global regulatory politics. For social movements seeking to shape the governance of the world economy, all roads still lead to the state.\"Review, G. John Ikenberry, Foreign Affairs, September/October 2007 Drezner's 2011 book, Theories of International Politics and Zombies, speculated about different ways the international community might respond to a zombie outbreak, although he \"concedes that the statistical probability of such an event is extremely difficult to determine but generally thought to be low.\" Oliver Stuenkel, writing in Post-Western World, commented: \"Drezner\u2019s book is a must-read for young international relations scholars, considering the vast attention this topic is likely to get in the future.\"Review, January 1, 2011 Drezner's 2014 book, The System Worked: How the World Stopped Another Great Depression, examined the Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. In it Drezner praised the international response to the crisis and said that a major economic depression was adverted. Jonathan Kirshner, in his review in the Boston Review, said the book was \" smart, thoughtful, and important\" but disagreed with Drezner on the issues of free trade and globalization.The Neoliberal Bailout, Jonathan Kirshner, Boston Review, July 7, 2014 ==Selected publications== ===Books=== * Drezner, Daniel W.
