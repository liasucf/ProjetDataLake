    "text": "Henri de Berni\u00e8res (c. 1635 - 1700) was a French Catholic priest who served as the first resident pastor of Quebec in France's American colony of New France. He also served as the first Superior of the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec. ==Early life== Berni\u00e8res was born in Caen, Normandy, the son of Pierre de Berni\u00e8res, Baron of Acqueville, and of Madeleine Le Breton. He was destined by his parents for service in the Church and received the tonsure at the age of nine, when he was entrusted into the care of his uncle, Jean de Berni\u00e8res de Louvigny, who then raised him in a religious community which he had founded in 1644 in the same city, though he was a layman. His work was a part of the reform movement of the Catholic Church sparked by the Council of Trent, and the hermitage was a major influence in that movement, in association with the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement. A young priest, Fran\u00e7ois de Laval spent several years in retreat at the community, coming to know the young Henri during that time. In 1659, Laval, by then a member of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, had been appointed by King Louis XIV to serve as the first Bishop of Quebec in the colony of New France. Upon the recommendation of his uncle, though still only in minor orders, Berni\u00e8res was chosen as one of a group of clerics to accompany the new bishop to America. ==New France== Laval and his companions sailed from La Rochelle on 13 April 1659, together with the Jesuit J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalemant. They arrived in Fort Ville-Marie two months later, on 16 June, only to find that no residence had been provided for them, but they found temporary quarters. Berni\u00e8res was appointed Laval's chaplain and continued his theological studies until he was ordained as a priest on 13 March 1660. Laval soon entrusted Berni\u00e8res with the pastoral care of the district of Quebec. The young priest also supervised the building of a residence for the bishop and clergy, completed in 1662. That same year Laval returned to France to deal with a number of issues plaguing the colony, leaving Berni\u00e8res one of two Vicars General in charge of the mission. When the bishop returned to the colony the following year, he brought with him a royal charter for the establishment of a seminary. Further, he established a canonical parish, the first in New France, and was appointed as its first pastor. ==Seminary of Quebec== By 1665 the seminary appeared to be reliably enough established, and Laval selected Berni\u00e8res for this office. He was to hold it for four terms: 1665\u201372, 1673\u201383, 1685\u201388 and 1693\u201398, a total of 25 years. The seminary began to develop in stages: first as a school of theology (1663), then it became a classical college (1668), after which it grew into a seigneurial corporation (1668), then a large corporation, supporting the clergy of the colony. As a frontier mission, sources of funding needed to be secured. The priests engaged in the ministry looked to the seminary for support, the seminary, in turn, relied upon the S\u00e9minaire des Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res in Paris, by virtue of an agreement made by Laval with his religious congregation in 1665, as well as upon donations from monasteries and individuals back in France who wished to support the Catholic Church's mission to the native peoples. Berni\u00e8res died in Quebec in 1700. == References == * Category:1630s births Category:1700 deaths Category:People from Caen Category:French Roman Catholic priests Category:French Roman Catholic missionaries Category:17th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in New France Category:Canadian Roman Catholic priests Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Canada ",
