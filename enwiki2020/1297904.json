    "text": "Boricua College is a private college in New York City. The college was designed to serve the education needs of Puerto Ricans and other Hispanics and was founded by Victor G. Alicea and several others. ==Faculty== The school employs a largely bilingual faculty and staff of 130 full-time and 100 part- time members. According to its Self Study Report (2014) to the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools, in fall 2012-13 it had 59.5 full-time faculty and 25 part-time adjunct faculty. Over 90% are Latinos. It serves a student population of 1,200. ==Campuses== Williamsburg Boricua College Tower in The Bronx The college has four campuses: Washington Heights, Manhattan; in North Williamsburg, Brooklyn; in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn; and in the Bronx. ==Accreditation== Boricua College is accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. In the spring of 2014 the Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC/CAEP) evaluated Boricua College's Audit Brief and recommended it \"above standard\" for TEAC's three quality principles: Candidate Learning, Faculty Learning, and Capacity and Commitment of the institution. TEAC/CAEP met and accepted the recommendation and accredited, for the maximum allowable of seven years (spring 2014 to spring 2021), the college's Bachelor of Science degree program in Childhood Education that included the Generic Studies Liberal Arts and Sciences core curriculum program, and the Masters in Science degree program in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). This national achievement complements the authorization of these programs by the New York State Education Department and the State Certification of the graduates. ==Student body and graduation== The college is regarded as \"nontraditional\" because of its competency-based model of education, emphasizing the importance of critical thinking skills and clarification of values and increasing students' capacity for self-reflection. Its student body is 79% adult (over 25 years old with family responsibilities) which puts it in the nontraditional category. In his book Access to Freedom, James Hall considered Boricua College as a nontraditional college. Hall explains that these colleges cater to adult, working students who may take much longer than the six years taken by traditional students to graduate.James Hall, Access to Freedom, 1993, p. 117. Boricua College's graduation rate is given by the National Center for Educational Statistics (a resource generally used by US Department of Education's office of statistics) to be 54% among first-time college students who entered in 2006 and graduated in 2012. When students who transfer out to other colleges are taken into account, that positive completion rate is given by the National Center as 69%. Further, during the last 10 years the college's education department has program completers who pass the New York State certification examinations at more than the required 80% rate. ===Notable alumni=== *Boricua College counts New York State Assemblyman F\u00e9lix Ortiz, a Democrat representing the 51st Assembly District, as one of its alumni. *Robert Torres (known by the stage name Sabor Latino), a Hip Hop artist and author, is an alumnus of Boricua College. ==Notable visitors== In January 2000 President Bill Clinton visited the Brooklyn campus at its Graham Avenue learning center to inaugurate a Small Business Association at the college. Boricua was one of the two colleges the president visited that were not for commencement purposes during his eight years at the White House. ==References== ==External links== *Boricua College Category:Universities and colleges in New York City Category:Educational institutions established in 1974 Category:Universities and colleges in Brooklyn Category:Universities and colleges in Manhattan Category:Universities and colleges in the Bronx Category:Liberal arts colleges in New York City Category:1974 establishments in New York (state) ",
