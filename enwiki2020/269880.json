    "text": "The Blue Cliff Record () is a collection of Chan Buddhist k\u014dans originally compiled in Song China in 1125, during the reign of Emperor Huizong, and then expanded into its present form by Chan master Yuanwu Keqin (1063\u20131135; ).K. Sekida, Two Zen Classics (1977) p. 18-20 The book includes Yuanwu's annotations and commentary on 100 Verses on Old Cases (), a compilation of 100 k\u014dans collected by Xuedou Chongxian (980\u20131052; , '). Xuedou selected 82 of these from The Jingde Record of the Transmission of the Lamp, with the remainder selected from the Yunmen Guanglu (, Extensive Record of Yunmen Wenyan, 864\u2013949). ==Later developments== Yuanwu's successor, Dahui Zonggao (1089\u20131163), wrote many letters to lay students teaching the practice of concentrating on koans during meditation, but Dahui did not explain and analyze koans. Oral tradition holds that Dahui noticed students engaged in too much intellectual discourse on koans, and then burned the wooden blocks used to print the Blue Cliff Record to \"rescue disciples from delusion\". The text was reconstituted only in the early 14th century by a layman, Zhang Mingyuan (, ').K. Sekida, Two Zen Classics (1977) p. 19 One of Zhang's sons became ill during this time, and others believed that it was an omen meaning that Zhang should not have re-released the book. However, an elder named Feng Zizhen () comforted Zhang and encouraged him for his work. ==Dogen and Japan== Another key legend regards D\u014dgen (1200\u20131253), who brought the Caodong school of Chan to Japan as the S\u014dt\u014d sect of Zen. After an extended visit to China for the purpose of studying Chan, on the night before his planned return to Japan, Dogen came across the Blue Cliff Record for the first time, and stayed up all night making a handwritten copy of the book. Given the size of the book, this story is most likely apocryphal; but Dogen is still credited with introducing the collection to Japan,H. Tanake, Philosophy as Metanoetics (1986) p. 126 where it had a wide circulation.M. Y Zeami, On the Art of the N_ Drama (1984) p. 121 ==Literary qualities== The Blue Cliff Record was a subtle and literary text, with wide-ranging philosophical implications, as opposed for example to the more straightforward nature of The Gateless Barrier.Z.
