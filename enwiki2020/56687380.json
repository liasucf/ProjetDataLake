    "text": "Android Go, officially Android Go Edition, is a stripped-down version of Android distribution designed for low-end and ultra-budget smartphones, first made available for Android Oreo. It is intended for smartphones with 2 GB of RAM or less. This mode has platform optimizations designed to reduce mobile data usage (including enabling Data Saver mode by default), and a special suite of Google Mobile Services designed to be less resource- and bandwidth- intensive. Google Play Services was also modularized to reduce its memory footprint. The Google Play Store will highlight lighter apps suited for these devices. The operating system's interface differs from that of mainline Android, with the quick-settings panel giving greater prominence to information regarding the battery, mobile-data limit, and available storage; the recent apps menu using a modified layout and being limited to four apps (in order to reduce RAM consumption), and an application programming interface (API) for allowing mobile carriers to implement data-tracking and top-ups within the Android settings menu. Most devices running Android Go use Google's \"stock\" Android GUI, although there are several manufacturers that still use customized GUI. ==Versions== Samsung Galaxy J4 Core running Android Oreo Go edition, with Samsung Experience user interface Android Go was made available to OEMs for Android 8.1, and later, for Android Pie. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
