    "text": "The 2017 Highland Council election was held on 4 May 2017 to elect members of the Highland Council. The election used the 21 wards created under the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004; each ward elected three or four councillors using the single transferable vote system (a form of proportional representation). A total of 74 councillors were elected, six less than in 2012. The election was fought in new wards, as the recommendations by the Boundary Commission had been accepted by Scottish Ministers. There were big changes, particularly in Caithness where an entire ward was removed. This election was most notable for returning 10 Conservative councillors: the party's first representation on the council since 1999. After the 2012 election an administration had been formed by the Scottish National Party, the Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Labour Party. This was the first time that the Independents had not had any role in the administration of the Council. However, later in the 2012\u201317 term, this administration fell and the Independent group instead governed as a minority. After the 2017 election, the Independent, Liberal Democrat and Labour groups formed a coalition administration. ==Election result== Note: \"Votes\" are the first preference votes. The net gain/loss and percentage changes relate to the result of the previous Scottish local elections on 3 May 2012. This may differ from other published sources showing gain/loss relative to seats held at dissolution of Scotland's councils. These are also direct comparisons of seat change, not comparisons to 'notional' results as used in the national results, as such there is a net loss of six seats in the Net gain/loss column. ==Ward results== ===North, West and Central Sutherland=== *2012: 1 SNP; 1 Lib Dem; 1 Independent *2017: 1 SNP; 1 Lib Dem; 1 Independent *2012-2017 Change: No change ===Thurso and North West Caithness=== *2017: 2 Independent, 1 Conservative, 1 SNP *2012-2017 Change: New ward * = Sitting Councillors for Landward Caithness Ward. \\+ = Sitting Councillors for Thurso Ward. ===Wick and East Caithness=== *2017: 2 Independent, 1 Conservative, 1 SNP *2012-2017 Change: New ward * = Sitting Councillors for Wick Ward. \\+ = Sitting Councillor for Landward Caithness Ward. ===East Sutherland and Edderton=== *2012: 1xLabour, 1xIndependent; 1xSNP *2017: 1 x Labour, 1 x Independent, 1 x Liberal Democrats *2012-2017 Change: 1 x Liberal Democrat gain from SNP ===Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh=== *2012: 2 x Independent, 1 x SNP, 1 x Liberal Democrat *2017: 1 x Independent, 1 x SNP, 1 x Conservative, 1 x Liberal Democrat *2012-2017 Change: 1 x Conservative gain from Independent * = Sitting Councillor for Culloden and Ardersier Ward. ===Cromarty Firth=== *2012: 2 x Independent, 1 x SNP, 1 x Liberal Democrats *2017: 2 x Independent, 2 x SNP *2012-2017 Change: 1 x SNP gain from Liberal Democrats ===Tain and Easter Ross=== *2012: 2 x Independent, 1 x Liberal Democrat *2017: 1 x Independent, 1 x Liberal Democrat, 1 x SNP *2012-2017 Change: 1 x SNP gain from Independent ===Dingwall and Seaforth=== *2012: 2 x Independent, 1 x Liberal Democrat, 1 x SNP *2017: 2 x Independent, 1 x Liberal Democrat, 1 x SNP *2012-2017 Change: No Change ===Black Isle=== *2012: 2 x Independent, 1 x Liberal Democrats, 1 x SNP *2017: 1 x Independent, 1 x Liberal Democrats, 1 x SNP *2012-2017 Change: 1 x Independent loss due to 4 wards being reduced to 3 ===Eilean a' Che\u00f2=== *2012: 2xIndependent; 1xLib Dem; 1xSNP *2017: 3xIndependent; 1xSNP *2012-2017 Change: Independent gain one seat from Lib Dem * = Sitting Councillor for Inverness Millburn Ward. ===Caol and Mallaig=== *2012: 3xIndependent *2017: 2xIndependent; 1xSNP *2012-2017 Change: SNP gain one seat from Independent ===Aird and Loch Ness=== *2012: 2xIndependent; 1xSNP; 1xLib Dem *2017: 2xIndependent; 1xSNP; 1xCon *2012-2017 Change: Conservative gain one seat from Lib Dem ===Inverness West=== *2012: 1xSNP; 1xLib Dem; 1xIndependent *2017: 1xLib Dem; 1xIndependent; 1xSNP *2012-2017 Change: No change ===Inverness Central=== *2012: 2xSNP; 1xIndependent; 1xLab *2017: 1xSNP; 1xLab; 1xIndependent *2012-2017 Change: 1 less seat compared to 2012. ===Inverness Ness-side=== *2012: 1xLib Dem; 1xSNP; 1xIndependent; 1xLab *2017: 1xLib Dem; 1xSNP; 1xCon *2012-2017 Change: 1 less seat compared to 2012. ===Inverness Millburn=== *2012: 1xLab; 1xSNP; 1xLib Dem *2017: 1xLab; 1xSNP; 1xCon *2012-2017 Change: Conservative gain one seat from Lib Dem ===Culloden and Ardersier=== *2012: 1xSNP; 1xIndependent; 1xLab; 1xLib Dem *2017: 1xSNP; 1xIndependent; 1xLib Dem *2012-2017 Change: 1 less seat compared to 2012. ===Nairn and Cawdor=== *2012: 2xIndependent; 2xSNP *2017: 2xIndependent; 1xSNP; 1xCon *2012-2017 Change: Conservative gain one seat from SNP. ===Inverness South=== *2012: 2xLib Dem; 1xSNP; 1xIndependent *2017: 1SNP; 1Con; 1Lib Dem; 1Independent *2012-2017 Change: Conservative gain one seat from Lib Dem ===Badenoch and Strathspey=== *2012: 2xSNP; 1xIndependent; 1xLib Dem *2017: 1xCon; 1xIndependent; 1xSXP; 1xGRN *2012-2017 Change: Conservative & Green each gain one seat from SNP & Liberal Democrat ===Fort William and Ardnamurchan=== *2012: 2xIndependent; 1xSNP; 1xLab *2017: 2xSNP; 1xIndependent; 1xCon *2012-2017 Change: SNP & Conservative each gain one seat from Independent & Labour ==Changes since 2017== *\u2020 Tain and Easter Ross Liberal Democrat Cllr Jamie Stone was elected MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross in June 2017.
