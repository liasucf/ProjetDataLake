    "text": "was the son of H\u014dj\u014d S\u014dun, founder of the Go-H\u014dj\u014d clan. He continued his father's quest to gain control of the Kant\u014d (the central area, today dominated by Tokyo, of Japan's main island). His childhood name was Chiyomaru (\u5343\u4ee3\u4e38). In 1524, Ujitsuna took Edo Castle, which was controlled by Uesugi Tomooki, thus beginning a long-running rivalry between the H\u014dj\u014d and Uesugi families. Two years later, the Uesugi attacked and burned Kamakura, which was a major loss to the H\u014dj\u014d symbolically, because the earlier H\u014dj\u014d clan from which they took their name fell in the siege of Kamakura in 1333. The Uesugi attacked again in 1535, when Ujitsuna was away fighting the Takeda; however, Ujitsuna returned and defeated Uesugi Tomooki, reclaiming his lands. When Uesugi Tomooki died two years later, Ujitsuna took the opportunity to seize Kawagoe Castle, and secure his control of the Kant\u014d. In 1526, Hojo Ujitsuna was defeated by Takeda Nobutora in the Battle of Nashinokidaira. In 1538, Ujitsuna then went on to win the battle of K\u014dnodai, securing Shim\u014dsa Province for the H\u014dj\u014d. In 1539, he defeated the Koga Kubo Yoshiaki (Oyumi Kubo) and gained control of Awa. Over the next several years before his death in 1541, Ujitsuna oversaw the rebuilding of Kamakura, making it a symbol of the growing power of the H\u014dj\u014d, along with Odawara and Edo. He was succeeded as head of the H\u014dj\u014d clan and lord of Odawara by his son H\u014dj\u014d Ujiyasu. ==Family== * Father: Hojo Soun * Younger Brother: H\u014dj\u014d Genan * Mother: Nan\u2019nyoin-dono * Wife: Yojuin-dono * Concubine: Konoe-dono * Children: ** Hojo Ujiyasu by Yojuin-dono ** H\u014dj\u014d Tsunashige (Adopted child) ** Hojo Tamemasa (1520-1542) ** Hojo Ujitaka (1522-1562) ** Joshin\u2019in married Ota Suketaka ** daughter married Kira Yoriyasu ** Hoshun\u2019in married Ashikaga Haruuji ** Sakihime married Horikoshi Sadatomo ** Daichoin married Hojo Tsunamori ** Chiyo married Katsurayama Ujimoto ==References== *Turnbull, Stephen (2002).
