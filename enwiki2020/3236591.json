    "text": "Jimmy Dean Foods is a food company that was founded in 1969 by country singer and actor Jimmy Dean. It was purchased by Sara Lee, which then divested as part of a unit known as Hillshire Brands, which was later purchased by Tyson Foods. ==History== Dean founded the Jimmy Dean Sausage brand of breakfast sausage, which was originally called \"Pure Pork Sausage.\" The Jimmy Dean Sausage company did well, in part due to Dean's own extemporized, good-humored commercials. Dean sold the company to the Sara Lee Corporation in 1984 for $80 million. He remained involved as the company spokesman after the takeover, though Sara Lee, under the leadership of John Bryan, immediately began phasing him out of management duties. By 2002, he was no longer acting as spokesman. In 2018, after Bryan's death, the company resumed an advertising campaign featuring Dean, who had died in 2010. ==Products== * Tastefuls!
