    "text": "Northern Norway (, , ; ) is a geographical region of Norway, consisting of the two northernmost counties Nordland and Troms og Finnmark, in total about 35% of the Norwegian mainland. Some of the largest towns in Northern Norway (from south to north) are Mo i Rana, Bod\u00f8, Narvik, Harstad, Troms\u00f8 and Alta. Northern Norway is often described as the land of the midnight sun and the land of the northern lights. Further north, halfway to the North Pole, is the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, traditionally not regarded as part of Northern Norway. The region is multi-cultural, housing not just Norwegians but also the indigenous Sami people, Norwegian Finns (known as Kvens, distinct from the \"Forest Finns\" of Southern Norway) and Russian populations (mostly in Kirkenes). The Norwegian language dominates in most of the area; Sami speakers are mainly found inland and in some of the fjord areas of Nordland, Troms and particularly Finnmark \u2013 though ethnic S\u00e1mi who do not speak the language are found more or less everywhere in the region. Finnish is spoken in only a few communities in the east of Finnmark. ==Geography== Some of the major islands in Northern Norway Northern Norway covers about a third of Norway. The southernmost part, roughly the part south of the Arctic Circle, is called Helgeland. Here there is a multitude of islands and skerries on the outside of the coastal range, some flat, some with impressive shapes, like Mount Torghatten, which has a hole through it, and the Seven Sisters near Sandnessj\u00f8en. The inland is covered with dense spruce forests and mountains near the Swedish border; some of the biggest rivers in the region are the Vefsna and the Ranelva. The highest mountain in Northern Norway is found here in the Okstindan range south of Mo i Rana with Oksskolten reaching above sea level, and with the glacier Okstindbreen. The Saltfjellet range, with its Svartisen glacier and intersecting Arctic Circle, divides Helgeland from the next region, called Salten. Notable peaks in Salten are the B\u00f8rvasstindan south of Bod\u00f8, Suliskongen near Fauske (, highest mountain north of the Arctic Circle), the Steigartindan and the phallic Hamar\u00f8ytinden. Between Saltfjellet and eastern Finnmark, Norway spruce trees have originally been planted and are mostly privately owned. The older plantations are now producing lumber, 80 years after planted. The islands along the coast creates sheltered sounds on the inside, as here in Lenvik. Lofoten is a chain of peaks that jut out of the ocean. From the mainland side it looks very barren, but behind the violet- black peaks there are also flatlands with good grazing for sheep, partially on soil made from seaweed. The Vester\u00e5len islands consist of smaller and bigger islands with a huge variation in landscape. Ofoten, further inland, is a fjord landscape with high mountains, the highest is Storsteinfjellet in Narvik, 1,894 m above sea level, but the most well-known is Stetind, the national mountain of Norway. There are also glaciers, like Frostisen and Bl\u00e5isen. M\u00e5lselva is one of the larger rivers; M\u00e5lselv municipality. National parks in Northern Norway. Lomsdal-Visten National Park was established May 2009 (no 30). B\u00f8rgefjell National Park is shared with Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag and does not show up on map. Troms county has surprising greenery for the latitude, and the inner waterways and fjords are lined with birch forests, and further inland there are extensive pine forests and highlands around the rivers M\u00e5lselva and Reisaelva. Big islands like Senja, Kval\u00f8ya and Ringvass\u00f8ya have green, forested interiors and a barren, mountainous coastline, with smaller islands offshore. The Lyngen Alps are the highest mountains of the area, rising to , an area of glaciers and waterfalls. The Mollisfossen waterfall in Nordreisa is the highest waterfall in the north, while M\u00e5lselvfossen is Norway's national waterfall. The many fjords vary in size and topography. The bedrock and soil in the surrounding land also varies. Eidsfjorden in Sortland, Vester\u00e5len. Finnmark county has fjords and glaciers in the far southwest, and the northwestern coasts are characterized by big islands, like S\u00f8r\u00f8ya and Seiland. The inland is covered by Finnmarksvidda, a relatively barren plateau about high, with many lakes and rivers like Alta-Kautokeino and Tana/Deatnu. Even at this latitude, pine forests grow naturally in lowland areas inland. East of Honningsv\u00e5g, there are no islands protecting the barren coasts that rise directly up from the sea. The landscape towards the Russian border is comparatively flat. Knivskjellodden on the island of Mager\u00f8ya marks the northern end of Europe; tourism is directed to the much more accessible (and dramatic) North Cape, whereas Kinnarodden on the Nordkinn Peninsula is the northernmost point of Europe's mainland. Finnmark is situated north of northernmost Finland, and to the east Norway has a border with Russia. ==History== Rock carvings at Alta The oldest known historical culture in the region is called Komsa, named after a mountain in Alta. The first people possibly arrived 12,000\u201313,000 years ago, but it is uncertain whether they came from southern Norway or from the Kola Peninsula. Today the rock carvings at Hjemmeluft in Alta or at Leknes in Nordland are among the remainders of the Stone Age cultures, showing reindeer swimming across the fjords. A significant find area is between the river Tana and the fjord of Varanger, where the reindeer probably ran over the isthmus on the way between the winter and summer grazing. The question of the ethnic identity of the Stone Age cultures is politically charged, as many Sami feel the uncertainty surrounding the earliest settlers in Northern Norway is being used to question their status as an indigenous people. Metals were introduced around 500 BC. The Sami culture can be traced back at least 2,000 years. There is also some archeological evidence of Bronze Age agricultural settlements about 2,500 years old, as in Steigen and S\u00f8mna. In 2009, archeologist discovered evidence of barley grown in Kv\u00e6fjord near Harstad in the Bronze Age 1000 BC. A larger settlement by people of Germanic origin, with substantial archeological evidence, seem to have occurred 200\u2013300 AD. These settled along the coasts roughly up to Troms\u00f8. The two ethnic groups traded with each other, and there seems to have been quite a lot of intermarriage. The nature of the co-existence is hotly debated. The medieval Alstahaug Church. In the Viking age, several chieftains along the coast played a significant role in Norwegian history, usually resisting unification of Norway. The voyage and story of Ottar from H\u00e5logaland was recorded by the king of England. H\u00e5rek from Tj\u00f8tta and Tore Hund, who killed Saint Olav at the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030 were important leaders according to Heimskringla. The chieftain and poet \u00d8yvind Skaldespiller was the first to receive international acclaim, as his poems were rewarded when the Icelandic parliament organized a money collection to buy him a thick ring of gold. This flourishing period of resistance was followed by consolidation and centralization of the Norwegian state, which was (and is) dominated by southerners (in the relative sense of south of Northern Norway), reducing the power and wealth of the Northern Norwegian chieftains. Gullgubber from the Iron Age, the oldest Toreutics in Northern Europe; this one found in Kongsvik, Tjeldsund, Nordland. In the Middle Ages, churches and fortifications were built along the coast in an effort to stake a more firm claim for the kingdom of Norway along what was then the frontier of Norwegian settlement. By 1150, Lenvik Church was the northernmost church in Norway. In 1252 the first church, the Ecclesia Sanctae Mariae de Trums juxta paganos (\"The Church of Saint Mary in Troms near the Heathens\"), was built in Troms\u00f8, along with a small rampart intended to serve as protection against Karelian raids. This was followed in 1307 by the consecration of Vard\u00f8 Church in what is now eastern Finnmark. Finally, Vard\u00f8hus Fortress was constructed to mark and defend the border with the Karelian tributary lands of the Novgorod Republic. The traditional view has been that the fortress and church were constructed at roughly the same time, although recent research indicates that the fortress may have been constructed as late as the 1330s, after the border between Norway and Novgorod had become more fixed. At roughly the same time, the cod fishing gained momentum. Dried cod was exported through Bergen to the whole Hanseatic world, bringing prosperity to the north. This is reflected in the numerous pieces of imported church art from the late Middle Ages. There were numerous wars with the republic of Novgorod in Russia at the time, that stopped by the late 15th century. Reduced fish prices in the 17th century and the exploitative trade practices of merchants from Bergen, who had been granted a royal monopoly on fish trading, led to a significant decline in the population and grinding poverty for those who remained. Large coastal areas were depopulated, and Sami culture made a comeback, as it was less dependent on fish exports. After 1700, Russian Pomors started to come every summer on trading expeditions, bringing rye in exchange for fish. Although this was in violation of Bergen's trade monopoly and the Danish\u2013Norwegian monarchy made some attempts to curtail the Pomor trade, the trade was vital to the survival of many Northern Norwegian fishing communities. In the 1740s the first settlers started arriving in Northern Norway from Finland. The traditional view is that these were refugees escaping famine and warfare at home, although modern scholars have pointed out that many were simply looking for their own piece of land, which was getting scarce in Finland as a result of rapid population growth. In 1789, the trade monopoly of the city of Bergen was lifted, Hammerfest and Vard\u00f8 were issued their city charters, and Troms\u00f8 followed suit in 1794. Interrupted by the British blockade of the Napoleonic wars, this introduced a period of unprecedented growth in the north as the trade monopoly had previously made cities nonviable in Northern Norway. Bod\u00f8 was founded in 1816, and Vads\u00f8 in 1833. The Hurtigruten shipping line, introduced in 1893, gave quicker communications with the south. In 1906, the iron mines in Kirkenes opened. Cod fisheries have for more than 1,000 years been of great economic importance to the region. From Svolv\u00e6r harbour by Gunnar Berg. At the same time, the ethnic diversity of the area came under threat. Particularly after Norwegian independence (from Sweden) in 1905, the Norwegian authorities were insistent that all should speak Norwegian only and schools became active tools of assimilation. The Sami language was banned in schools, churches and in public administration. Concerns about possible Finnish irredentism also led to increasing pressure on Kvens to assimilate. People who wanted to buy state- owned land in Finnmark had to prove they could speak Norwegian before they were allowed to settle. This region of Norway was the area most affected by World War II. In 1940, Norwegian and Allied forces fought the Germans to a standstill over the strategic port for iron exports of Narvik, until allied forces and equipment were withdrawn, leaving the remaining Norwegians with no option but surrender. King Haakon VII and the government fled towards the north, and stayed in the Troms\u00f8 area for three weeks. On 27 May, Bod\u00f8 was bombed by German planes, and on 7 June, the Allies retreated from the North, and the King and government fled to Britain from Troms\u00f8. In 1944, the German Wehrmacht started to retreat from the Murmansk front. They burned everything after them in the area between the Russian border and the Lyngen fjord, as part of their tactics. The population was forcibly evacuated, although a third of them chose to hide in the wilderness instead. All who were found were shot. Bod\u00f8 was an important air base during the Cold War. In more recent years, Norwegian F-16s have deployed to Balkans and Afghanistan. After World War II, Norway made a huge effort to rebuild the destroyed towns and villages. Modernizing fishing and agriculture was important, as Northern Norway was considerably poorer and less developed than the south. In 1946, the huge steel works of Mo i Rana were founded, heralding industrialization of the north. Transportation was also improved, as airports were built throughout the area, notably in Bod\u00f8 in 1952 and Troms\u00f8 in 1964. The rail network was extended to reach Bod\u00f8 in 1961. In 1972, the University of Troms\u00f8 opened, accompanied by a number of university colleges, notably in Bod\u00f8, Alta, Harstad and Narvik. In 1972 and 1994, the strong anti-EU movements of the north, largely based on concerns over EU (mis)management of its own fish stocks, were instrumental when Norway voted against EU membership in referendums. Samediggi \u2013 the Sami Parliament in Karasjok. Sami language instruction was introduced in schools in the 1970s. In 1979, the building of a hydro-electric dam in Alta caused huge demonstrations, giving the Sami question national attention for virtually the first time. The result was a significant effort by the authorities to promote Sami language and culture. In 1989, the Norwegian Sami parliament, Samediggi, opened, and the Law of Finnmark of 2005 was an attempt to deal with the question of land rights. A similar law is on the way for Nordland and Troms. Working against all this, emigration to the south has been strong after World War II. While there is a slight overall population growth in Northern Norway (as a result of surplus childbirths and immigration from abroad), this is significantly lower than in southern counties, although the regional centres of Bod\u00f8, Troms\u00f8 and Alta continue to grow at a relatively brisk pace. Lately, the off-shore gas field of Sn\u00f8hvit, off Hammerfest, has brought hopes of new development in the north. ==Languages== Treriksr\u00f8ysa where Norway, Sweden and Finland meet each other. Russian immigration and travel to Kirkenes has prompted the need for street names in Russian. The Northern Norwegian dialects share a common, musical intonation, different from the southern dialects of Norway. Apart from this, there is great variation in sound system, grammar and vocabulary. In general, one can say that the southernmost of the northern dialects, particularly in Helgeland and Salten, are the most distinct. Notably they cut grammar endings (like French relative to Italian). In areas of Finnmark, the dialects are somewhat more in line with standard written Norwegian (Bokm\u00e5l, Nynorsk), particularly in those areas where Norwegian was primarily introduced by the school system as part of the assimilation process during the 20th century. In some inland valleys in the county of Troms, settlers from the inland of Southern Norway immigrated 200 years ago. Even today, these dialects have southern characteristics in intonation and vocabulary. Earlier, northern dialects had a low status in Norway, but recently they have been used extensively in song lyrics, poetry, in TV and radio. Today, anyone can use their dialects. This is not to suggest that no prejudices remain, however. Sami is spoken in three main dialects (or languages, depending on the definition): Southern Sami south of the Arctic Circle, Lule Sami mainly between Bod\u00f8 and Narvik, and Northern Sami in the rest. Originally, Pite Sami and Ume Sami were spoken around Bod\u00f8, but these dialects are now extinct on the Norwegian side of the border. Eastern Sami was originally spoken in Neiden, close to Kirkenes, but it is more or less extinct. Overall, Northern Sami is by far the healthiest of the Sami languages today, primarily because it still has a relatively large number of first language speakers and maintains its dominance in core areas in Finnmark. Northern Sami is an official language (in addition to Norwegian) in the municipalities of G\u00e1ivuotna (K\u00e5fjord), Kautokeino, Karasjok, Porsanger, Tana and Nesseby. The Finnish spoken in western regions, from Storfjord to Porsanger, is quite distinct, although comprehensible for people from Finland. Further east, around Vads\u00f8 and Kirkenes, the spoken Finnish resembles standard Finnish. People of Finnish descent in these eastern areas are also typically more likely to consider themselves as \"Finnish Norwegians\" rather than Kvens, arguing that the term Kven represents an attempt to cut them off from their Finnish roots. Finnish is official in addition to Sami and Norwegian in Porsanger municipality. Very few first language Finnish speakers remain in Northern Norway, and unlike Northern Sami, the Finnish language lacks a core region where it is still dominant in daily life. Coastal and fjord areas of Northern Norway have much in common with Western Norway, sometimes imagined in cultural terms as a shared \"coastal identity\". The topography and fjord landscape, the rich fisheries, the culture and even some aspects of the dialects (Vestnorsk) have clear similarities. ==Cuisine== Arctic char (pictured) is common in Northern Norway; the only part of Norway where they also feed in the sea. Trout is also very common in lakes and rivers. Reindeer at sunset near Bug\u00f8ynes. Northern Norway is surrounded by some of the richest seas in the world, and seafood is the main source for traditional cuisine. However, agricultural produce has existed for at least 3,000 years in parts of the area (Helgeland, Salten, Lofoten, Harstad-Kv\u00e6fjord). In addition to fishing, each family traditionally had a small farm with a few cows (see Pietro Querinis shipwrecked at R\u00f8st in 1432Pietro Querinis story from R\u00f8st in 1432 ), sheep or goats (goats being preferred in many places due to their superior adaptation to the rough and mountainous terrain found in much of Northern Norway) and had small grain fields (mostly barley). After the introduction (and somewhat later acceptance) of potatoes from the Americas, these became a main staple in much of Northern Norway, as well as many other parts of Norway. Agriculture gradually becomes less important as a food source as one moves further north, and in the northern half (north of Balsfjord/Troms\u00f8 area) was usually of minor importance and certainly less important than fishing or Sami reindeer nomadic pastoralism. Hunting has been important ever since the stone age, and the comparatively large areas of sparsely settled valleys, fells and mountains still hold wildlife. In the winter, the codfish comes to the coastal waters to spawn, especially to the cod fisheries of Lofoten. M\u00f8lja, boiled codfish with liver and roe, is a delicacy that today is served in the best restaurants. In the summer, the coalfish, or saithe, bites, and fresh saithe is often served on the beach, boiled in seawater over an open fire, or fried (typically the smaller coalfish). Halibut is traditional Christmas food. Most fish is served plainly poached, only accompanied by boiled potatoes, carrots and possibly fried bacon. A more particular kind of fish is \"gammelsei\", saithe that has been conserved for a year or more. Other traditions are lutefisk and boknafisk, the latter made from stockfish, and in Nordland often from herring. Seawolf and rose fish are regarded as good food, the latter often eaten salted and poached, with the brain (krus) highly regarded, sometimes fried with onions. In addition to cod, herring and potatoes were traditional staple foods (except in the most northern area). Salmon has long traditions as food along the rivers, and also trout which are common also in the numerous lakes. In the latest decades consumption has increased in correspondence with increased salmon fish farming; smoked salmon is very popular, often on open sandwiches, alone or together with boiled or scrambled eggs or salad. Traditionally, northerners regarded shellfish and prawns as bait, but lately they have developed a taste for it, and the freshest and most succulent prawns and shellfish are easily obtainable all along the coast. Shark meat has traditionally not been used as food, even if some can grow nearly long. In later years, the large Red king crab has invaded Norwegian waters from the east and, having reached west to Hammerfest, are now served in the finest restaurants. The large sea bird colonies along the coast provided eggs for the local population, most of these are now protected by law. However, in Troms\u00f8, sea gull eggs and beer from the local brewery is still a highly regarded dish to enjoy in the sun of late spring. Tender whale meat is usually served as steaks, whereas seals are an acquired taste, due to the smell. However, when processed into \"Barents ham\", it gets more palatable. Fresh seal meat is served at the end of the hunting season in spring, and Troms\u00f8 is the place to look for it. Reindeer are often served as finnebiff, thin slices in a cream sauce. Reindeer filets have become more popular in high-end restaurants in recent years, but the price can be prohibitive as the reindeer industry is shielded from market forces by the Norwegian government (in essence, it is treated as a vital component of Sami culture, rather than a competitive industry, which means there is little pressure to actually sell the meat products). Lamb meat from sheep following the retreating snow line up the hills and mountains to get the most nutritious fresh vegetation throughout summer is highly regarded by the locals, and research seem to indicate that a varied diet does influence the taste of the meat. Game meat includes mountain hare, rock ptarmigan, willow grouse and moose. Cloudberries and bilberries (blueberries) Foods with dairy as an important ingredient include waffles, pancakes and r\u00f8mmegr\u00f8t (sour-cream porridge), the latter always served with sugar and cinnamon. None of the aforementioned are distinctly Northern Norwegian foods, however, but are popular throughout Norway. There are a number of local traditions in this long region, including goat cheese from Balsfjord,Balsfjord goat cheese Blanklefse and other variations of lefse from Helgeland, and a number of variations of reindeer, an integral part of traditional Sami culture. Winter in Balsfjord, the northernmost municipality in Norway with fairly large agricultural activity. Wild berries have long traditions in the local cuisine, and the most sought after is the cloudberry, used in marmalade, desserts and cakes. Other popular wild berries are bilberries, lingonberry, raspberry (southern half of region, also cultivated in some private gardens), and there are also a number of less well known berries used for food.Berries and other food traditionally collected in nature in Norway Mushrooms are common in the forests from late July to September and also has seen some use in traditional food. The use of kitchen gardens is limited by climatic factors, but still has a long history in the southern half of the region. Rhubarb and redcurrant has been used for more than 100 years; redcurrant also grows naturally in much of the region, blackcurrant is also common in gardens. In addition to potatoes and carrots, rutabaga and sometimes cabbage have traditionally been grown (very little in Finnmark). Many wild plants were used for medical purposes or as spices, such as Garden Angelica, but this has become rare in modern times. More lately is the imported strawberry which has become popular and are grown locally (mostly southern half of region).Kv\u00e6fjord: Strawberries The unique growing conditions, with ripening in 24-hr daylight and modest warmth is sometimes claimed to enhance flavor. Bioforsk, with research in terrestrial effects of climate and subarctic agriculture, has branches in four places in Northern Norway \u2013 Troms\u00f8, Bod\u00f8, Tj\u00f8tta and Svanhovd in S\u00f8r-Varanger. == Climate == The Midnight sun seen from Steigen. Aurora Borealis seen from Salangen. There are large climatic differences from southwest to northeast in this region. Finnmarksvidda in the interior of Finnmark and some valleys in the interior of Troms, experience a more continental climate with much less precipitation and much colder winters compared to the long coastal region. ===Light=== There are extreme variations in daylight between winter and summer. At Nordkapp the midnight sun can be seen from 11 May to 31 July, and the sun does not rise above the horizon from 19 November to 22 January. For Troms\u00f8, the dates are 17 May to 25 July, and 26 November to 15 January, respectively; and for Bod\u00f8 from 30 May to 12 July (no polar night in Bod\u00f8). The mid-winter darkness is not totally dark on the mainland; there is twilight for about three hours around noon in Troms\u00f8. Helgeland does not have true midnight sun, but the upper part of the sun disc never descends below the horizon as far south as Mosj\u00f8en in June. February is a transitional period when the sun rapidly returns, and March and April often feel like an explosion of light with long daylight hours and snow cover in most areas except the coastal strip of Nordland. The Aurora Borealis can be seen in the whole area from autumn to mid-April, after which it gets too bright to observe the Aurora. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:90%;width:95%;text-align:center;\" |- !Month!!Jan!!Feb!!Mar!!Apr!!May!!Jun!!Jul!!Aug!!Sep!!Oct!!Nov!!Dec |- !Bod\u00f8 sunrise & sunset 15th of each month |10:18 \u2013 14:05 |08:16 \u2013 16:18 |06:24 \u2013 18:02 |05:16 \u2013 20:51 |03:06 \u2013 22:56 |Midnight sun |01:40 \u2013 00:30 |04:27 \u2013 21:43 |06:20 \u2013 19:34 |08:02 \u2013 17:33 |09:04 \u2013 14:29 |11:18 \u2013 12:37 |- !Troms\u00f8 sunrise & sunset 15th of each month |11:31 \u2013 12:17 |08:16 \u2013 15:43 |06:07 \u2013 17:41 |04:43 \u2013 20:48 |01:43 \u2013 23:48 |Midnight sun |Midnight sun |03:44 \u2013 21:50 |05:56 \u2013 19:20 |07:54 \u2013 17:04 |09:25 \u2013 13:32 |Polar night |- !Hammerfest sunrise & sunset 15th of each month |Polar night |08:16 \u2013 15:15 |05:50 \u2013 17:22 |04:17 \u2013 20:37 |Midnight sun |Midnight sun |Midnight sun |03:11 \u2013 21:42 |05:35 \u2013 19:04 |07:41 \u2013 16:39 |09:28 \u2013 12:50 |Polar night |- | colspan=\"14\" style=\"text- align:center;font-size:90%;\"|Source: Almanakk for Norge; University of Oslo, 2010.

Islands along the coast of North Norway Br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund in the southern part of Nordland has January and February averages of and , July & 24 August-hr averages are both , year average is (about the same as in Oslo), and precipitation is per year, with autumn as the wettest season (). Br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund experiences on average 63 days/year with strong breeze (22 knots) or more, and 18 of these days reach gale-force winds or more (34 knots, data from Leka just south of Br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund, source met.no). In all areas, late autumn and winter is the most windy time of year, as the Atlantic low pressure systems are strongest then. Karasjok in the eastern part of Finnmarksvidda has January and February averages of and , July & August averages are and , year average is and precipitation is only 366 mm/year (). Situated in a river valley, Karasjok only experiences on average 1 day/year with strong breeze (22 knots) or more, and virtually never sees gale- force winds. The mean annual temperature difference between Br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund and Karasjok is 8 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), about the same as the difference between Br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund and Madrid, Spain (). The comparatively mild maritime climate dominates along the coast and in the large fjords, even at the most northern coastal locations; in Nordkapp municipality the average January temperature is a modest and the year average is (). Some islands, like Tr\u00e6na and R\u00f8st, have average temperatures of approximately in their coldest months. The warm climate in coastal areas, relative to other locations at the same latitude, is by many attributed to the relatively warm North Atlantic Current, an extension of the Gulf Stream. ===Wind=== The most windy location in continental Norway (apart from mountain summits) is Fruholmen Lighthouse () in M\u00e5s\u00f8y not far from the North Cape. The most windy city in Northern Norway is Bod\u00f8 with on average 153 days/year with strong breeze or more and 24 days with gale-force winds, while Vard\u00f8, also lacking shelter, sees 136 days of strong breeze or more and 18 days with gale. Inland valleys and sheltered fjord areas\u2014particularly if sheltered by mountains\u2014are much less windy. Troms\u00f8, partly sheltered by large islands, experiences on average 27 days/year with strong breeze, and 1 day with gale, and Bardufoss sees on average only 11 days with strong breeze or more and scarcely ever experiences gale. In winter, there might sometimes blow cold winds from the freezing highlands out through the large fjords, and strong breeze will feel very cold on the skin. Mild westerlies are still much more common in most winters. Weather patterns are inherently unpredictable in this northern region\u2014both low pressure and high pressure weather can occur at any time of year, although the strongest winds occur in winter. Bl\u00e5tindan in M\u00e5lselv, inland Troms. February 2009. ===Winter=== insulates the ground from the cold. Along the coast of Nordland average temperatures hover barely below freezing for 2\u20133 months, statistically from 15 December to 27 February in Br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund; somewhat longer into the fjords. Inland Finnmark, as in Karasjok, average temperatures remain below freezing for 7 months (October\u2013April). In Troms\u00f8, average temperatures stays below freezing for 5 months \u2013 statistically from 10 November to 10 April (based on 1961\u201390 average, more recent years have tended to be somewhat warmer). ===Summer=== Even if winter temperatures depends largely on the distance to the sea, the length of the season varies mostly with latitude (and altitude): The summer (days/year with 24-hr average or more) lasts on average 108 days in Br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund, 90 in Bod\u00f8,http://www.yr.no/climate_Bod\u00f8/detailed_statistics.html 85 days in eastern Lofoten and Narvik, 75 days at the inland valleys of Bardufosshttp://www.yr.no/M\u00e5lselv/Bardufoss/detailed_statistics.html and Alta, about 65 days in Troms\u00f8 and Kirkenes, 50 in Hammerfest and 0 in Vard\u00f8. This is based on a 30-year average (1961\u20131990) for each day of the year; even Vard\u00f8 will on occasions experience summer days.

The western side of the mountains get up to precipitation annually, such as Glomfjord. The main fjords remain ice-free all winter, but some sheltered fjord branches \u2013 like Ramfjord in Troms\u00f8 pictured here \u2013 freeze over in winter, allowing ice fishing. Precipitation occur in all seasons, usually as snow in winter, although often as rain on the Nordland coast. Snow accumulation in the mountains can exceed , and this abundance of snow is the reason for the numerous glaciers \u2013 more than 500, mostly in Nordland and Troms. Autumn tend to be the wettest season in most areas, often receiving more than twice as much precipitation as does spring and early summer. Only the interior areas of Finnmark \u2013 like Karasjok \u2013 tend to be wettest in summer. The areas with the least precipitation are some inland valleys, like Dividalen in M\u00e5lselv with only precip/year, and upper Saltdal and Skibotn with about the same. Inland Finnmark is the only large area with less than precipitation/year. The wettest areas are generally the Helgeland region; Lur\u00f8y on the west coast of Saltfjell averages /year. ===The Arctic northeastern coast=== The extreme northeastern coast, from Nordkapp to Vard\u00f8, is situated in the arctic climate zone due to lack of summer warmth\u2014the July average in Vard\u00f8 is = . However, to the south, in the Pasvik valley south of Kirkenes, the 24 July-hr average is . No other parts of Norway experience such large differences in lowland summer temperatures in such a relatively short distance. ===Record temperatures=== The coldest temperature recorded is in Karasjok, and the warmest recorded is at Mosj\u00f8en Airport on July 27, 2019. ==Towns== Strandgata (street) in Harstad on a warm May day.
