    "text": "Route 59 station is a Metra station along the BNSF Railway Line on the border of Aurora, Illinois and Naperville, Illinois. The station is named for and on Illinois Route 59 to distinguish itself from Naperville station to the east and Aurora Transportation Center to the west. The tracks that service the station run east and west and form the border between Aurora and Naperville in this area. The land to the north of the tracks is in Naperville and the land to the south of the tracks is in Aurora. Both city governments operate parking lots on their respective sides of the train tracks. The address for the station is 1090 N. Rt 59 Aurora, Il. Sometimes the address is listed as a Naperville location; however, this is incorrect, as the 1090 numbering is consistent with Aurora's address system. If the address were to be a Naperville location, the station would be located in Naperville's 1900 Block of N. Rt 59, as opposed to Aurora's 1000 Block of N. Rt 59. Adding to the confusion is the fact that Rt. 59 is the east/west border between Naperville and Aurora. Land on the west of Rt. 59 is in the City of Aurora and land on the east side of Rt. 59 is in the City of Naperville. Along the border on Rt. 59 from the BNSF railroad tracks south to Montgomery Rd. (83rd St), Rt. 59 lies in Aurora. A person enters Naperville only after passing east across Rt. 59. The Route 59 station is on the west side of Rt. 59. Each day, nearly 5,800 people board Metra trains at the Route 59 station, making it the busiest station outside of downtown Chicago.On the Bi-Level, October 2007.Commuter Rail Station Boarding/Alighting Count - 2014 Route 59 is away from the BNSF Railway Line's eastern terminus at Union Station.Metra Railfan Tips - BNSF Railway Line The station house is two stories high on the railroad embankment of the south parking lot on Meridian Lakes Road, which is maintained by the City of Aurora, and has direct access to Route 59. The north parking lot, maintained by Naperville, is between Weston Ridge Road and Railway Drive. Fairway Drive leads to this parking lot from North Aurora Road, and has on- street parking between North Aurora Road and Continental Avenue. Route 59 drivers on the north side of the tracks need to take North Aurora Road for access to the north parking lot. Route 59 station is the last stop before the end of the BNSF line at the Aurora Transportation Center. However, Metra has been considering an extension to Sandwich, Illinois, including a stop at the Plano Amtrak station. ==Bus connections== Pace * 534 Fox Valley Villages/Route 59 Metra Station * 559 Illinois Route 59 * 672 95th St. Park & Ride/Route 59 Metra Direct * 673 Community Christian Park-n-Ride/Route 59 Metra Direct * 675 Wheatland Salem Park-n-Ride/Route 59 Metra Direct Greyhound Lines * Chicago\u2013Davenport, Iowa ==References== ==External links== *Station from Google Maps Street View Category:Metra stations in Illinois Category:Transportation in Naperville, Illinois Category:Buildings and structures in Naperville, Illinois Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1989 ",
