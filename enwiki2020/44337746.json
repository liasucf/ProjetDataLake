    "text": "Harold A. Winston (August 28, 1901 - July 16, 1964) was an American stage actor and promoter, best known for his work as a dialog director at Columbia Pictures and Warner Bros. ==Early life== Winston was born Harry Weinstein on August 28, 1901 to Jacob and Fanny Weinstein in Manhattan, NY. His Jewish parents and two teenage sons had left Russia to escape the pogroms of the Czar. Two older siblings, Adolph and Sadie, were also born in New York. At age 19 he was listed as working as an editor in the publishing industry in New York City. ==Acting career== Harold Winston is variously described as an actor in NY, a promoter and a person who stages plays; a Dialog Director, a coach, and a scout in Hollywood. Howard W. Polsky wrote in his book \"How I am a Jew\u2014Adventures into My Jewish-American Identity\", \"In the twenties and thirties scores of Jews changed their name in part to disguise their identity. Weinstein became Winston\u2026\" His earliest theatrical credit listed is \"A Night in Avignon\" in 1919. Other theater productions he performed in as an actor include: \"The Claw\" 1921-22, \"Children of the Moon\" 1923, \"Bridge of Distances\" 1925. He was involved in the staging of the plays: \"Brass Ankle\" 1931 about the multi-racial group known as Brass Ankles, written by Dubose Heyward the writer of Porgy and Bess; \"The Other One\" 1932; and \"The Blue Widow\" 1933 Moving to Hollywood he worked first at Columbia Studios and later at Warner Bros. In his autobiography Frank Capra called him one of his \"needlers three\", along with Joseph Sistrom and Chester Sticht: \"These were my \u2018needlers three\"---Sistrom, Winston, Sticht. Their jobs: gadflys, deflaters, goaders. Their purpose: to keep me from being satisfied; nothing I did was good enough\u2014I could do better. Their virtue\u2014a fierce loyalty to me and my films.\" Capra went on: \"Winston was a refugee from the New York footlights, now serving as my dialogue coach. Winston was a gentle, sensitive soul who loved all that was beautiful, loathed all that was shoddy. As a purist in aesthetics his taste could discriminate between what was artistic and what was merely pleasing or utilitarian.\"Title: The Name Above the Title: An Autobiography Author: Frank Capra Publisher: Da Capo Press, 1997 In 1939 Harold Winston in the capacity of studio scout is credited with helping discover actor William Holden, naming him in honor of his ex-wife, Gloria Holden. A version of how Holden obtained his stage name is based on a statement by George Ross of Billboard magazine. George Ross stated: \"William Holden, the lad just signed for the coveted lead in \"Golden Boy\", used to be Bill Beadle. And here is how he obtained his new movie tag. On the Columbia lot is an assistant director and scout named Harold Winston. Not long ago he was divorced from the actress, Gloria Holden, but carried the torch after the marital rift. Winston was one of those who discovered the \"Golden Boy\" newcomer and who renamed him\u2014in honor of his former spouse!...\" Between 1937 and 1944 there are eleven works in his filmography for which he is listed as a dialog director: \"Lost Horizon\" 1937, \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" 1939, \"Three Sons O'Guns\" 1941, \"Dangerously They Live\" 1941, \"International Squadron\" 1941, \"Blues in the Night\" 1941, \"The Big Shot\" 1942, \"Action in the North Atlantic\" 1943, \"The Hard Way\" 1943, \"The Desert Song\" 1944, and \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" 1944. He worked with the USO as a director during World War II. Later in his autobiography, Frank Capra referred again to Harold Winston. He felt loneliness when working on the movie \"It\u2019s a Wonderful Life\" because the three people he depended on had scattered. At this point, he calls them his \"fiddlers three\". Capra stated that \"Winston had disappeared\".Title: The Name Above the Title: An Autobiography Author: Frank Capra Publisher: Da Capo Press, 1997 Back in the North East by 1946, Harold Winston started a \"Theater of the Open Road\". He sent out groups of six to eight actors in two repertory companies, both Equity and non-Equity, to New England and the Middle West. In 1957 he appeared on television as a guest star in the Hallmark Hall of Fame drama \"The Lark\", see: The Lark (play)(Season 6, Episode 4, List of Hallmark Hall of Fame episodes), playing the part of a promoter. He was production manager for the films: \"Machete\" in 1958,\"Counterplot\" in 1959, and \"Fiend of Dope Island\" in 1961. ==Personal life== His first marriage was to actress Gloria Holden, on December 17, 1932. They divorced December 2, 1937. Gloria Holden stated at their divorce that \"he said he didn\u2019t like the state of marriage\u2014in fact, that he didn\u2019t believe in it for artists.\" He married his second wife, Barbara McKenzie, on August 10, 1949. They divorced April 1955 in Alabama. He remained married to his third wife Carolyn until his death from heart disease in Oslo, Norway on July 16, 1964.
