    "text": "IntelliScanner Corporation is a North Carolina-based hardware and software company that specializes in barcode enabled organizational products for home and business use. IntelliScanner is known for their use of barcode technology and Internet-enabled software to automatically enter information on media items, wine and groceries, as well as utilizing barcodes to allow users to organize other types of items with or without a barcode. IntelliScanner is perhaps best known for its bundling of software and hardware - a practice that has been met with praise for all-in-one convenience and criticism from customers who already own a scanner and would prefer to only buy software. IntelliScanner's software and hardware products run on Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows operating systems.
