During the game, the player is given a device that minituarises items in their pockets, which Finnish Video Games: A History and Catalog argues is one of the only times the endless inventory space is justified in-game. The game features a series of static screens, has live actors, and does not allow the player to save. == Critical reception == Richard Cobbett of PC Gamer deemed it \"the strangest edutainment game I've ever played\".

Micha\u0142 Czajkowski felt its desire to appeal to the lowest common denominator made it lack challenge The game won the Grand Prize of the Mindtrek Multimedia Competition in Tampere. == References == == External links == * The Blobjob at MobyGames * Article in Skrolli (page 42), a Finnish computer magazine Category:1998 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Educational video games Category:Full motion video based games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Finland Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ",
