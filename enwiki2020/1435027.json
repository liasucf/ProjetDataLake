    "text": "Sirens and Condolences is the debut studio album by American rock band Bayside. The album was the only one not entirely credited to Bayside as a band. The music and melodies were written by frontman Anthony Raneri, while the lyrics were written by bassist Andrew Elderbaum. The same process was used on their split CD with Name Taken. Elderbaum, along with drummer Jim Mitchell, left the band shortly after the album's release. ==Release== Due to exposure from publications as Alternative Press and Skratch, the group signed to independent label Victory Records in fall 2003. The label recommended they go record their debut as soon as possible. In November, the group went on tour with Silverstein, followed by December shows with Digger and Punchline. In late December, Sirens and Condolences was announced for release on January 27, 2004 through Victory Records. In July and August, the group went on tour with Fall Out Boy, Armor for Sleep, Name Taken, and The Academy Is....
