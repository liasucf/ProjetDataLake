    "text": "Bhismaknagar (also known as Kundilnagara) is an archeological site in Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh. It is located near Roing in Lower Dibang Valley district. ==Etymology== The name Bhismaknagar was coined by researchers who discovered the ruins in the 1970s. It was probably named as a result of sanskritization of a legendary king of the Chutias named Bhirmukka. As per Buranjis, the founder of the medieval Chutia kingdom Birpal called himself a descendant of king Bhirmukka. The Deodhai Buranji reads, Historically, it was popularly known as Kundil-nagara(being situated on the banks of Kundil river), Sadhayapura(the rulers being Sadhayapur-ishwar) and Che-lung in Tai Buranji(meaning Bar-nagar in Assamese and Great City in English). ==Location== It is located in Lower Dibang Valley district. The campus of the old city is spread over an area of 2500 acres. ==History== Bhismaknagar is an important ancient archeological site. It was built by a Chutia king during 8th century and late rebuilt by another Chutiya king named Gaurinarayan. Bhismaknagar must have been a strong hold of the Chutias (12th-16th centuries) but the excavations has been throwing new light on its much earlier antiquities, which confirms the presence of an earlier Chutia kingdom(founded by one named Asambhinna) as stated in Assam chronicles(7th century).The early medieval Chutia kingdom was founded by Asambhinna in about 640 A.D., p. 65-67 Bhismaknagar has been identified with Sadhayapuri (or Svadhayapuri), the political centre of the Chutiya Kingdom.It was probably repaired by the Chutia king Lakshminarayan as bricks with the name Sri Sri Lakshmi-Narayana were found in the site.Neog, Maheswar, A Ruling dynasty of Arunachal: Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute Vol. 58/59, Diamond Jubilee Volume (1977-1978), p.817 Being located along the bank of river Kundil, it was also popularly known as Kundilnagara. ==Architecture== Fabricated from the burnt bricks gave this fort an impressive and remarkable top view and thus explores the dexterity of people of ancient era. This fort can still be signified as an astonishing work of art. The city is spread over an area of 10 square km. It is surrounded by a wall 4.5 meters high and 6 meters wide made using granite stone(6-9 courses)Gait, Edward. A history of Assam(2nd Edition). 1962, p. 16. and bricks on the east, west and south directions. In the north, the Mishmi hills provided a natural barrier. Although very less excavation has been carried out by the Arunachal government, preliminary excavations have revealed three tanks and two gates in the eastern and western directions.Raikar, Yashawant. Archeology in Arunachal Pradesh. 1980, p. 19. The Bhismaknagar central complex extended over an area of 1860 square meters and displays three halls, six ingresses and two extension rooms. There is also a 2 meters high stone wall inside the complex. The architecture of the fort displays the medieval culture. While quarrying the fort the enormous pieces of work of art like potteries, terracotta figurines, terracotta plaques and decorative tiles were preserved. ==Gallery== File:Bhismaknagar fort ruins.jpg|These are the ruins of the Chutia Royal Palace Bhismaknagar.
