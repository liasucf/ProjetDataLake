It was raised in January 1945 as part of the preparation for the Battle of Berlin. It was named after the Kurmark region of Brandenburg. The division was formed at Frankfurt on the Oder in January 1945 from elements of the Grossdeutschland Panzer Grenadier Ersatz Brigade. It was an understrength unit. During its short history, the division was commanded by Generalmajor Willy Langkeit.Mitcham, p. 240 The division was part of the German 9th Army (Army Group Vistula) and was deployed around Frankfurt on the Oder. It was surrounded alongside other Wehrmacht and SS formations of the 9th Army south- east of Berlin.
