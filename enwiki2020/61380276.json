He appointed Hafiz Rehmat Khan as regent of Rohilkhand until then. However the ministers and regent all reneged on their promises. In 1754 they orchestrated an argument within the royal family and used it as a pretext to usurp the power and wealth of the orphans. Disgusted, he along with his older brother Abdullah Khan and younger Allah Yar Khan left for Oojanee. He was killed while fighting the British in the First Rohilla War. == References == Category:Nawabs of India Category:Rohilla Category:History of Uttar Pradesh Category:1774 deaths Category:Year of birth missing ",
