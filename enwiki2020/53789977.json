    "text": "The 2017 Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a was the 34th edition of the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a, an annual two-legged football tie contested by the winners of the previous season's La Liga and Copa del Rey competitions. The tie was played in August 2017 between the winners of the 2016\u201317 Copa del Rey and holders of the Supercopa, Barcelona, and the champions of the 2016\u201317 La Liga, Real Madrid. This was the first time since the 2012 edition that the Supercopa featured El Cl\u00e1sico. Real Madrid won the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a 5\u20131 on aggregate for their 10th title. ==First leg== ===Summary=== The first half of the match ended goalless. Five minutes into the second half, Marcelo fired a ground cross that deflected off Piqu\u00e9's foot, resulting in an own goal. Four minutes later, Real Madrid had a great opportunity to score when Benzema did a stepover and evaded Pique's tackle, then sent a cross to Dani Carvajal across the goal and Carvajal shot but Jordi Alba cleared it on the goal line. In the 70th minute, Cristiano Ronaldo scored after a pass from Casemiro but it was ruled offside. Seven minutes later, Luis Su\u00e1rez was brought down in the box by Keylor Navas, resulting in a penalty, which was subsequently converted by Messi. Messi's strike marked his 25th goal in the fixture. Three minutes later, in the 80th minute, Real scored their second through a counter attack when Isco assisted Ronaldo with a long ball who shot into the top right corner from the edge of the box. Ronaldo was booked for removing his shirt as part of his celebration. Two minutes later he was booked again by the referee for allegedly diving when he collided with Samuel Umtiti in the box, which resulted in a second yellow card to become a red card, therefore getting suspended for the second leg. Ronaldo was later given a 5 match suspension after replays showed him push the referee in frustration for the red card. Real's last goal was scored in the 90th minute in similar fashion to the second, when Asensio shot into the top left corner following an assist from Lucas V\u00e1zquez. ===Details=== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"40%\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||1 || Marc- Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen |- |RB ||22|| Aleix Vidal |- |CB ||3 || Gerard Piqu\u00e9 || |- |CB ||23|| Samuel Umtiti |- |LB ||18|| Jordi Alba |- |CM ||4 || Ivan Rakiti\u0107 || || |- |CM ||5 || Sergio Busquets || |- |CM ||8 || Andr\u00e9s Iniesta (c) || || |- |RW ||10|| Lionel Messi || |- |CF ||9 || Luis Su\u00e1rez |- |LW ||16|| Gerard Deulofeu || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||13|| Jasper Cillessen |- |DF ||2 || N\u00e9lson Semedo |- |DF ||14|| Javier Mascherano |- |DF ||19|| Lucas Digne |- |MF ||6 || Denis Su\u00e1rez || || |- |MF ||20|| Sergi Roberto || || |- |FW ||17|| Paco Alc\u00e1cer || || |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=3| Ernesto Valverde |} |valign=\"top\"|300px |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font- size:90%; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||1 || Keylor Navas |- |RB ||2 || Dani Carvajal || |- |CB ||5 || Rapha\u00ebl Varane |- |CB ||4 || Sergio Ramos (c) |- |LB ||12|| Marcelo || |- |DM ||14|| Casemiro || |- |CM ||8 || Toni Kroos |- |CM ||23|| Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107 || || |- |AM ||22|| Isco |- |CF ||11|| Gareth Bale || || |- |CF ||9 || Karim Benzema || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||13|| Kiko Casilla |- |DF ||6 || Nacho |- |DF ||15|| Theo Hernandez |- |MF ||24|| Dani Ceballos |- |FW ||7|| Cristiano Ronaldo|||| |- |FW ||17|| Lucas V\u00e1zquez|| || |- |MF ||20|| Marco Asensio || || |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=3| Zinedine Zidane |} |} {| style=\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\" | Assistant referees: N\u00fa\u00f1ez Fern\u00e1ndez De Francisco Grijalba Fourth official: Santos Parga\u00f1a |style=\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\"| Match rules *90 minutes. *Seven named substitutes, of which up to three may be used. |} ==Second leg== ===Summary=== The first goal came quite early in the second leg through a Real throw-in the fourth minute following a poor clearance from Samuel Umtiti which resulted in the ball landing in the young Marco Asensio's feet who scored from 30+ yards out with his left foot. In the 32nd minute, Benzema stole the ball from Javier Mascherano and passed it to Lucas Vazquez in the center of the box who then hit the left post. Eight minutes after the half-hour mark, Marcelo sent a ground cross in for Benzema who controlled it backwards with his right foot and finished with a left foot half-volley straight into the bottom corner of the net which was enough for the victory. Six minutes after the start of the second half, Rapha\u00ebl Varane made a poor pass to Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107 to let Suarez recover the ball and pass it to Messi who then hit the crossbar inside the box. In the 70th minute, Andre Gomes took a throw in and played it to Suarez who then made a body feint and dribbled past Dani Carvajal. Suarez then played a through ball to Sergi Roberto on the left side of the box who toe poked the ball, which was saved by Navas. Varane's header fell to Ivan Rakitic a few yards outside the box who then passed the ball to Messi who took a shot, which was saved by Navas, and the deflection fell in the path of Suarez who performed a diving header that bounced off the right side post and went out of play. There was lesser action for the last 20 minutes, although Theo Hernandez, Dani Ceballos and N\u00e9lson Semedo came on to make their official debuts respectively. ===Details=== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"40%\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||1 || Keylor Navas |- |RB ||2 || Dani Carvajal |- |CB ||5 || Rapha\u00ebl Varane |- |CB ||4 || Sergio Ramos (c) |- |LB ||12|| Marcelo |- |CM ||10|| Luka Modri\u0107 |- |CM ||23|| Mateo Kova\u010di\u0107 || || |- |CM ||8 || Toni Kroos || || |- |RW ||17|| Lucas V\u00e1zquez |- |CF ||9 || Karim Benzema |- |LW ||20|| Marco Asensio || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||13|| Kiko Casilla |- |DF ||6 || Nacho |- |DF ||15|| Theo Hernandez || || |- |MF ||14|| Casemiro || || |- |MF ||22|| Isco |- |MF ||24|| Dani Ceballos || || |- |FW ||11|| Gareth Bale |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=3| Zinedine Zidane |} |valign=\"top\"|300px |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||1 || Marc- Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen |- |CB ||14|| Javier Mascherano || |- |CB ||3 || Gerard Piqu\u00e9 || || |- |CB ||23|| Samuel Umtiti |- |RM ||20|| Sergi Roberto |- |CM ||4 || Ivan Rakiti\u0107 |- |CM ||5 || Sergio Busquets |- |CM ||21|| Andr\u00e9 Gomes || || |- |LM ||18|| Jordi Alba || || |- |CF ||10|| Lionel Messi (c) |- |CF ||9 || Luis Su\u00e1rez || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- |GK ||13|| Jasper Cillessen |- |DF ||2 || N\u00e9lson Semedo || || |- |DF ||19|| Lucas Digne || || |- |DF ||22|| Aleix Vidal |- |MF ||6 || Denis Su\u00e1rez |- |FW ||16|| Gerard Deulofeu || || |- |FW ||17|| Paco Alc\u00e1cer |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=3| Ernesto Valverde |} |} {| style=\"width:100%; font-size:90%;\" | Assistant referees: Caba\u00f1ero Mart\u00ednez Gallego Garc\u00eda Fourth official: Gallego Gamb\u00edn |style=\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\"| Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra time if level on aggregate and away goals. *Penalty shoot-out if no goals scored in extra time. *Seven named substitutes, of which up to three may be used. |} ==See also== *El Cl\u00e1sico *2016\u201317 La Liga *2016\u201317 Copa del Rey ==References== Category:2017\u201318 in Spanish football cups 2017 Category:August 2017 sports events in Europe Category:FC Barcelona matches Category:Real Madrid CF matches Category:El Cl\u00e1sico matches ",
