    "text": "Future Perfect is the debut studio album by American alternative rock band Autolux. It was released on November 21, 2004 by T-Bone Burnett's label, DMZ, and RED Ink Records. Future Perfect was recorded at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles and was produced by Burnett. The album has been described as indie rock, shoegaze and noise pop. DMZ also released Future Perfect on vinyl as a two-LP set, which later went out of print. After the label's demise, Autolux reissued the album themselves (listed as Autolux Music Entertainment) in 2009 on one 180-gram LP via their websitehttp://www.autolux.net/shop.html autolux dot net (with no edits or changes to the track listing despite the long running time), and again in 2015 (as The Autolux Empire). ==Critical reception== Pitchfork critic Peter Macia said of the album's opening track, \"Turnstile Blues\": \"In the first 10 seconds of the album opener, Carla Azar shames most every beat-maker with her ridiculous Leibezeit-cum-Bonham percussion\". In 2016, Pitchfork ranked Future Perfect at No. 44 on its list of \"The 50 Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits for Future Perfect adapted from album liner notes.
