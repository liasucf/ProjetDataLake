    "text": "Alice Bertha Moreton, n\u00e9e Tippin, (23 March 1901 \u2013 6 January 1977) was an English sculptor, draughtsman and artist from Liverpool. ==Biography== Moreton was born in the Walton district of Liverpool where her father, David Tippin, was a builder and contractor. Her hobbies included riding, swimming and dancing. Moreton was originally self-taught, experimenting with art and sculpture in the years following her departure from Bootle Secondary School. She then spent a few years at the Bootle School of Art, before training at the Liverpool School of Art. Following this, she studied at the Royal Academy Schools from 1924 to 1928, where she exhibited many times. In her time there, she was taught by Sir William Reid Dick, George Frampton and Ernest Jackson. Moreton was most active as a sculptor and artist between 1924 and 1936, working from London and mainland Europe, as well as from her home town Liverpool. Her sculptures are in terracotta; her art is mainly pen and ink drawing, and watercolour. Before her marriage she signed her work A B. Tippin. After she married John Moreton in Walton, she signed her work A. Bertha Moreton. Moreton exhibited at the Paris Salon, Southport Arts Centre, Manchester Art Gallery, Walker Art Gallery, Merseyside Art Circle, Liverpool John Moores' Exhibition and at the Williamson Art Gallery and Museum. She was a member of the Liverpool Academy, Reynolds Club and Deeside Art Group. Her work has been displayed across Merseyside, in Cheshire Life magazine and in local papers, including the Liverpool Echo and the Liverpool Daily Post. Over her life, Moreton suffered a progressive loss of hearing. She was operated on, but this operation had detrimental effects. Her gravestone is in Willaston. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Honours and exhibitions (chronologically) !Year !Honour/exhibit |- |1922 |Won two scholarships and two studentships at the Liverpool School of Art. |- |1924-1928 |Studied at the Royal Academy of Arts.
