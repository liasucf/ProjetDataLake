    "text": "Fort Matachewan was a trading post set up by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1867,Churches of Elk Lake and is located 8 km north of the town of Matachewan, Ontario. This fort was primarily used for the fur trade, and as such the natives of the area often travelled to it to sell off their furs and pick up the staples of their diet. The fort was not a town site, but rather a large depot of stores. Eventually, a church was built on the grounds. Today the Fort is a crumbled relic of a time long past. Summer of 2016 the original site Known to the locals still as Fort Matachewan is undergoing a restoration by the Native people of Matachewan First Nation. As part of this restoration the path taken 150 years ago will once again be travelled with rustic sitting areas along the way.
