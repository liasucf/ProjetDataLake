As the local general store, it served as a gathering point for the Shiloh community. Webster used his position as the store's owner to assist struggling families in the area; he allowed farmers to purchase goods on credit and would wait to call their tab after their tobacco had been sold. Webster was also a tobacco and dairy farmer and operated tobacco warehouses in Stoneville and Clarkton. On May 1, 1937 Webster, together with George Amos Dillon, Robert Smith, and Clyde Smith, opened an Oldsmobile car dealership in a sheet-metal garage building in Madison under the name of W.D.S. Motors, Incorporated. A new W.D.S. Motors building opened on October 5, 1940. In 1955 the wooden J.J.
