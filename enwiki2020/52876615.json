The first organ was built in 1818. In 1826 the company was moved to Dresden. It was led from 1862-89 by Carl Eduard Jehmlich, then by the brothers Emil and Bruno Jehmlich, after 1938 by Otto and Rudolf Jehmlich until 1972. In 1972 the company was nationalized as VEB Jehmlich Orgelbau. Because of the specific expertise Horst Jehmlich became the director and family control was maintained. After the German reunification the company was reprivatized in 1990. In 2006 Ralf Jehmlich joined the company's leadership representing the sixth generation. In 2000, Jehmlich joined with Meissen to built the first porcelain organ. ==Organs== By 2014 Jehmlich had built 1161 organs. A partial list of organs built by Jehmlich Orgelbau can be found on the corresponding German website Jehmlich Orgelbau. ==References== ==External links== * Web site of Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden GmbH Category:German pipe organ builders Category:Pipe organ building companies Category:Manufacturing companies based in Dresden Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1808 Category:Volkseigene Betriebe Category:Musical instrument manufacturing companies of Germany ",
