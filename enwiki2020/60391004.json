Uptown Records Listing, accessed April 2, 2019 ==Reception== On AllMusic Ken Dryden states, \"Jack Sheldon is probably better known for his trumpet playing on other musicians' record dates, but this 1986 studio date more than proves he is a capable leader ... Recommended\". In JazzTimes, Chuck Berg wrote\" Jack Sheldon-TV actor, antic vocalist and cut-up extraordinaire-also happens to be one hell of a trumpeter. Here, in a superb session from 1986, we get a telling reminder of just how compelling the Sheldon jazz persona is ... Whatever the tempo, and there are some scorchers, it\u2019s Sheldon\u2019s gorgeous tone and plucky melodism that impresses first, last and always. ... Throughout, the band cooks at a simmer apropos to the session\u2019s dialogic intimacy. It\u2019s serious fun at the mainstream summit\".Berg, C.
