    "text": "The 1880 Centre football team represented Centre College in the 1880 college football season. This was Centre's first ever season. The first game is claimed as the first game ever played in the south at Stoll Field, though Washington & Lee and VMI played earlier games; it's the first game in the state of Kentucky. The game was said to have resembled a combination of soccer and rugby. Centre lost both its games this season to Transylvania University (then known as Kentucky University). ==Schedule== ==See also== * List of the first college football game in each US state ==References== Centre Category:Centre Colonels football seasons Category:College football winless seasons Centre football \\ ",
