Stratton was fond of a quote by William Henry Channing, 19th-century religious thinker and part of the Transcendental movement: :To live content with small means, to seek elegance rather than :luxury, and refinement rather than fashion; to be worthy, not :respectable, to study hard, think quietly, talk gently, act frankly; :to listen to stars and birds, to babes and sages, with open heart; :to bear all cheerfully, do all bravely, await occasions, hurry :never; in a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, :grow up through the common. This is to be my symphony. Stratton lived at 115 N. Weber St. in Colorado Springs. He had failing health due to cirrhosis of the liver and diabetes. By the time he was 43, he was tall, thin and frail with silky white hair. His personal physician Dr. D.H. Rice traveled with him on long journeys because of his poor health.
