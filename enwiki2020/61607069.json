He left the club in 2009 and subsequently worked for lowly local youth sides A.C. Milan Academy and Casa Social Cat\u00f3lica, before returning to \u00c1vila in 2011 as Jos\u00e9 Luis Diezma's assistant. On 10 October 2013, Jim\u00e9nez replaced sacked Kiko S\u00e1nchez as \u00c1vila's first team manager. On 17 November 2014, after a run of poor results, he resigned. Jim\u00e9nez joined Real Valladolid in June 2015, as a manager of the Cadete A. On 22 October, however, he was appointed manager of the reserves in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, and managed to avoid relegation with the side; on 30 May 2016, he announced his departure. On 1 June 2016, Jim\u00e9nez was named manager of CD Izarra still in the third division. On 10 July of the following year, after another mid-table finish, he was appointed at the helm of fellow league team R\u00e1pido de Bouzas. After taking R\u00e1pido to an impressive fifth position, Jim\u00e9nez was appointed manager of CD Mirand\u00e9s on 28 June 2018, still in division three. He finished his first season in charge with a promotion to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n through the play-offs. On 5 July 2019, Jim\u00e9nez left the Rojillos after the club failed to reach an agreement for the renewal of his contract, and he was appointed manager of Asteras Tripolis two days later. His first professional match in charge occurred on 24 August, a 0\u20131 loss at Olympiacos. He was relieved of his duties on 4 December 2019 despite winning 3\u20132 after extra time over Platanias in the second leg of the Greek Cup fifth round the same day. Jim\u00e9nez returned to his country's third division before the end of the year, taking the helm of FC Cartagena after Gustavo Mun\u00faa quit for Club Nacional de Football in his native Uruguay. In July 2020, he won them promotion to the second tier for the first time in eight years, with a penalty shootout play-off victory over Atl\u00e9tico Baleares. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|Nat !rowspan=2|From !rowspan=2|To !colspan=8|Record !rowspan=2| |- ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- |align=left|\u00c1vila | |align=left|10 October 2013 |align=left|17 November 2014 | |- |align=left|Valladolid B | |align=left|22 October 2015 |align=left|30 May 2016 | |- |align=left|Izarra | |align=left|1 June 2016 |align=left|10 July 2017 | |- |align=left|R\u00e1pido Bouzas | |align=left|10 July 2017 |align=left|17 May 2018 | |- |align=left|Mirand\u00e9s | |align=left|28 June 2018 |align=left|5 July 2019 | |- |align=left|Asteras Tripolis | |align=left|7 July 2019 |align=left|4 December 2019 | |- |align=left|Cartagena | |align=left|23 December 2019 |align=left|Present | |- !colspan=4|Total !\u2014 |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:People from \u00c1vila, Spain Category:Spanish football managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B managers Category:CD Mirand\u00e9s managers Category:FC Cartagena managers Category:Super League Greece managers Category:Asteras Tripolis F.C. managers Category:Spanish expatriate football managers Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Greece Category:Expatriate football managers in Greece ",
