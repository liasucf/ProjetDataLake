    "text": "Coluber constrictor etheridgei, commonly known as the tan racer, is a nonvenomous colubrid snake, a subspecies of the eastern racer (Coluber constrictor). It is endemic to the southern United States. ==Geographic range== C. c. etheridgei is found in Louisiana and Texas. ==Etymology== The subspecific name or epithet, etheridgei, is in honor of the American zoologist and paleontologist Richard Emmett Etheridge.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Coluber constrictor etheridgei, p. 86). ==Description== The tan racer, as its name implies, is typically a solid tan in color. Juveniles have a pattern of dark brown dorsal blotches, which fade to solid tan at about a year of age. The underside is typically gray or white, sometimes with yellow spotting. It typically grows from .75 \u2013 1.5 m (30 to 60 inches) in total length (including tail). It has large eyes, with round pupils, and excellent vision. ==Behavior== Like all racers, the tan racer is diurnal and highly active. Its diet consists of a wide variety of prey, but primarily includes rodents, and lizards. It is fast moving, and generally seeks to use its speed to escape if approached. ==Habitat== The tan racer prefers habitats of pine flatwoods. ==Reproduction== Mating occurs in the spring, and a clutch of approximately 30 eggs is laid typically in the month of May, to hatch mid summer. ==References== ==External links== * *Herps of Texas: Coluber constrictor ==Further reading== *Behler JL, King FW (1979).
