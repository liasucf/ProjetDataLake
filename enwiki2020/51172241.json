    "text": "The two-CD collection, When All Else Fails...a.k.a. Early Recordings, gathers together three different recordings by Swiss trio 16-17: 1984's Hardkore & Buffbunker (disc one, tracks 8-12), 1987's 16-17 (disc one, tracks 1-7), and 1989's When All Else Fails (disc two). This live album by the industrial punk jazz band was released on May 20, 2005, by Savage Land. ==Reception== AllMusic staff writer William York calls the formula simple: \"maniacal drumming, noisy guitar, and paint-peeling saxophone steamrolling ahead for three to five minutes at a time\". And the Dusted Magazine writer Doug Mosurock reviews: \"By the time of 1989\u2019s When All Else Fails LP, 16-17 had become, unbelievably, even more aggressive, this time as a result of Kneub\u00fchler adding new technologies and a whole palette of unconventional sound-generating devices to his setup. The approach here is positively industrial at times, as on \u201cPedestrian Dub,\u201d where sax and guitar are infused with enveloped, processed barbs that make each bleat and downstroke sound like wavering sheet metal, and Remond\u2019s shell tones all the more alien. The cyclic rhythms of their earlier work reappear on \u201cWho Planned All This?\u201d and \u201cClap Trap,\u201d but the rictus of dance rhythms and the drive to innovate moved the band beyond earlier works...\" ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Alex Buess, Markus Kneubuehler, Knut Remond (16-17) ==Personnel== Adapted from the When All Else Fails... liner notes. ;16-17 *Alex Buess \u2013 saxophones, electronics,vocals, oboe (track4), bass(tracks10 and 13) *Knut Remond \u2013 drums, percussion, bass (track4),electronic shaker, welson organ *Markus Kneub\u00fchler \u2013 guitar, synths, electronics ;Additional musicians and production *Alison Gangler \u2013 shawm and oboe (track4) *Weasel Walter \u2013 mastering *16-17 & RIV \u2013 Artwork *Alex Buess \u2013 engineer ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !
