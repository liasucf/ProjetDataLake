    "text": "The Niederburg (\"Lower Castle\") at Kobern, also called the Niedernburg, Unterburg or Neue Burg, is a hill castle above the municipality of Kobern- Gondorf in the county of Mayen-Koblenz in the German state of Rhineland- Palatinate. == Location == Oberburg (right) The ruins of the Niederburg stand at a height of about 150 metres above the village of Kobern on a hill ridge that points towards the Moselle. On the same ridge and about 50 metres higher, is the Oberburg (\"Upper Castle\") and St. Matthias' Chapel. == Description == The Niederburg seen from Maifeld The castle has an amygdaloidal ground plan. It has a three-storey, 20-metre-high bergfried, measuring 7.5 x 8 metres, with an elevated entrance at a height of 10 metres. There are also the remains of a two-storey, Late Gothic palas. A wall tower and a cistern are also well preserved and there are significant portions of the outer walls. The castle was guarded to the west by a curtain wall with a zwinger and to the north by a throat ditch. The upper third of the bergfried and the battlements were rebuilt in the 19th century. Between 1976 and 1978, the state castle administration reconstructed and enhanced the palas and the cistern between the two towers. == History == The castle was built in the mid-12th century. It is first recorded in 1195, when the then Burgherr made it a fiefdom of the Electorate of Trier. The female line of the lords of Isenburg-Kobern died out in the 13th century. The Kobern Castles and associated lordship passed via the heiress, Cecilia, to Frederick II of Neuerburg (a side line of the counts of Vianden). In 1309 the male line of this family also died out. Thereafter the castle and lordship was sold to the Archbishop of Trier. In 1688 the castle was destroyed. == Visiting == The Niederburg above Kobern The castle is open to the public all year round and may be visited free of charge. The bergfried may be entered by carefully climbing through a narrow wall gap, but the interior views are not worth the climb. Visitors may climb up to the castle on a narrow footpath from the M\u00fchlbach valley. == Monument protection == The Niederburg is a protected cultural monument.General Directorate for Cultural Heritage Rhineland-Palatinate (publ.): Nachrichtliches Verzeichnis der Kulturdenkm\u00e4ler Kreis Mayen-Koblenz (pdf; 1.7 MB), Koblenz, 2013. == References == == Literature == * Ortsgemeinde Kobern-Gondorf (publ.): Kobern- Gondorf. 1980. * Landesamt f\u00fcr Denkmalpflege - Burgen, Schl\u00f6sser, Altert\u00fcmer Rheinland-Pfalz (publ.), F\u00fchrer der staatlichen Schl\u00f6sserverwaltung des Landesamtes f\u00fcr Denkmalpflege Rheinland-Pfalz, F\u00fchrungsheft 7, Mainz, 1999 * == External links == * Category:Castles in Rhineland-Palatinate Kobern, Niederburg Category:Heritage sites in Rhineland-Palatinate Kobern, Niederburg +Niederburg Kobern Category:12th-century architecture ",
