The race winner had been declared as Alejandro Valverde, who won the final stage to take the race by 11 seconds. However, some four weeks after the end of the race the UCI placed Valverde under a two-year suspension for his involvement in the 2006 Operaci\u00f3n Puerto doping case, which was backdated to, and involved removal of all his results since, 1 January 2010. Simon \u0160pilak was thus promoted to winner of the event. == Pre-Race Favourites == Roman Kreuziger \u2013 the defending champion \u2013 was considered a heavy favourite. 2010 pre-race favourites included 2009 champion, Roman Kreuziger of as well as teammate Ivan Basso. Denis Menchov of Russia is also a favourite. While not a favourite to win overall, local Alexandre Moos has a lot going for him as this will be his 12th and final Tour de Romandie. == Teams == There are 20 teams for the 2010 Tour de Romandie. They are: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * == Stages == ===Prologue=== ;27 April 2010 \u2013 Lausanne to Lausanne, (ITT) This short course took in the beautiful, historic village of Porrentruy.

Two category 1 climbs and a category 2 \u2013 and a few other bumps along the way. Although the last 10 km are downhill, the course may be well suited to a break-away. Peter Sagan \u2013 the up-and-coming young cyclist claimed the victory in the sprint. It was his third victory of the season. The win put him in first place overall as he was just 0.92 seconds behind the previous leader, Marco Pinotti. Sagan was pleased with the win, but pledged his loyalty to team leader Roman Kreuziger. According to Cycling News, Sagan said, Sprinter Mark Cavendish could not hang in the mountains and was dropped from the peloton with 45 km to go. Had he not, a victory would have helped teammate Marco Pinotti remain in the leaders jersey. {| |Stage 1 results {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !Cyclist !Team !Time |- | 1 | '20px | '''''' | align=\"right\"| |- | 2 | | | align=\"right\"| st. |- | 3 | | | align=\"right\"| st. |- | 4 | | | align=\"right\"| st. |- | 5 | | | align=\"right\"| st. |} |General Classification after Stage 1 {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !Cyclist !Team !Time |- | 1 | | '''''' | align=\"right\"| |- | 2 | | | align=\"right\"| + 9\" |- | 3 | | | align=\"right\"| + 12\" |- | 4 | | | align=\"right\"| + 12\" |- | 5 | | | align=\"right\"| + 14\" |} |} ===Stage 2=== ;29 April 2010 \u2013 Fribourg to Fleurier, This stage looks to be for the sprinters.
