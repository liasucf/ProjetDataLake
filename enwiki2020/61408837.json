    "text": "Vaasan Sport Naiset is a women\u2019s ice hockey team based in Vaasa, Finland. They play in the Naisten Liiga, the premier women's hockey league in Finland. ==History== The women\u2019s representative team of Vaasan Sport debuted in the Naisten SM-sarja, predecessor of the Naisten Liiga, in the 1983\u201384 season. Sport quickly established themselves as a competitive team, finishing in the top half of the league during their first five seasons and achieving Finnish Championship bronze in 1986. The 1988\u201389 season was the first time the team finished in the bottom of the league, ranking seventh of eight teams. Following the disappointing season, the team was financially relegated. Vaasan Sport gained promotion to the SM-sarja in 1993 but the team struggled with the high level of competition and finished in last place. They were able to stave off relegation in the 1993\u201394 qualifiers but were unable to do so in the following season and were relegated to the Naisten I-divisioona (renamed Naisten Mestis in 2012) in 1995. In the following two decades, Vaasan Sport played in either the second-tier I-divisioona or third-tier Naisten II- divisioona (renamed Naisten Suomi-sarja in 2003). The team spent at least seven consecutive seasons in the Suomi-sarja prior to their return to the Mestis in the 2015\u201316 season. The return to Mestis marked a positive shift in the performance of the team and they continued to markedly improve over the ensuing seasons, culminating in their promotion to the Naisten Liiga for the 2018\u201319 season. == Players and personnel == === 2020\u201321 roster === === 2020\u201321 coaching staff === *Head Coach: Marko Haapala *Assistant Coach: Susanne Uppg\u00e5rd *Goaltending Coach: Vesa Perki\u00f6 *Equipment Manager: Mika Myllyniemi === Team captaincy history === *Susanne Uppg\u00e5rd, 2015\u20132016 Mestis *Elina Ojala, 2016\u20132020 *Pauliina Suoniemi, 2020\u2013present === Head coaches === *Ove Kvist, 2013\u20132017 *Mika Nummi, 2017\u20132019 *Marko Haapala, 2019\u2013present == Team honours == === Finnish Championship === * Naisten Liiga Third Place (1): 1986 == Notable alumni == Years active with Sport listed alongside players' names. * Sari Krooks, 1983\u20131989 & 1993\u201394 * Hanna Hakala, 1986\u20131988 * Tiina Suominen, 1986\u20131988 * Ida Kuoppala, 2017\u20132019 == References == == External links == *Team information and statistics from Eliteprospects.com and Eurohockey.com *Official site (in Finnish) * * Category:Women's ice hockey in Finland Category:Ice hockey teams in Finland ",
