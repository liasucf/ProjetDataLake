    "text": "David Campiti (born May 9, 1958) is an American animation producer, comic book writer, talent agent, and co-founder of Innovation Publishing. As CEO of Glass House Graphics, Campiti oversees an international animation studio and agency of illustrators, writers, painters, and digital designers, producing artwork for such clients as Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Dark Horse Comics, TokyoPop, Del Rey Manga, Reader's Digest books, and Scholastic Books, as well as Disney, DreamWorks, Hasbro, Del Rey, St. Martins Press, and many others. ==Early life== Campiti is the adopted son of Charles H. and Rose Campiti. He graduated from Warwood High School and West Liberty University. He began writing as a child. ==Career== Campiti sold his first writing to the Wheeling News-Register while still in college, and to such magazines as Writer's Digest and Comics Buyer's Guide soon after. He was an on-air news reporter at WKWK radio, where he also wrote, performed, and produced humorous radio commercials. He soon moved on to WANJ-FM Radio. In 1982, Campiti moved from his hometown of Wheeling, West Virginia, to North Attleboro, Massachusetts, where he worked as chief copywriter at the L.G. Balfour Company and, later on, as writer for the United Way of New England. ===Comics === During this period, Campiti began selling comic book scripts to Pacific Comics in '82, becoming first published in comics in 1983. By 1985, Campiti was writing Superman stories in Action Comics for DC and soon went into freelance editing, packaging full-time for several years. In the mid-1980s, Campiti helped launch Amazing Comics, Wonder Comics, Pied Piper Comics, Eternity Comics, Sirius Entertainment, Malibu Comics, and other companies. In the process, he discovered and helped launch the careers of such talents as Ron Lim and Bart Sears, who began their professional careers penciling Ex-Mutants and Hero Alliance respectively. === Innovation Publishing === In 1988, Campiti wrote a business proposal and raised US $400,000 to finance the launching of Innovative Corp., known publicly as Innovation Publishing. Under his control, Innovation became #4 in the market share, below only Marvel Comics, DC Comics, and Dark Horse, as it brought to prominence many literary, film, and TV tie-in series and adaptations, such as Anne Rice's The Vampire Lestat, Dark Shadows, Quantum Leap, Lost in Space, and many others. === Glass House Graphics === In 1993, Campiti resigned from Innovation\"Newswatch: Campiti Leaves Innovation,\" The Comics Journal #161 (August 1993), p. 27. to launch Glass House Graphics, an international studio/agency for illustrators, writers, painters, and digital designers, where he currently holds the position as CEO and global talent supervisor. In addition to the U.S. office, Campiti oversees offices in Brazil as well as in Manila, Jakarta, and various locations in Europe, coordinating art from a roster of over 125 talents worldwide to produce art and digital graphics for Disney Publishing Worldwide, DreamWorks Publishing, Hasbro, Reader's Digest Books, LEGO, Stone Arch Books, Marvel, DC, Dark Horse, Dynamite, Del Rey, Red Giant Entertainment, Rittenhouse Archives, Upper Deck, Trepidation, Marshall Holt Entertainment, IDW, BDI, and other companies. He also teaches seminars throughout the U.S. at conventions and art schools, Brazil, and the Philippines on a regular basis.\"Newswatch: Campiti Holds Art Seminar in Brazil,\" The Comics Journal #175 (March 1995), p. 29. === Other Works === Over the years, Campiti was a writer or co-writer for hundreds of comic books, often illustrated by the artists that he discovered, including Lim, Sears, Jason Pearson, and Mike Okamoto on Hero Alliance alone. His credits include Superman, T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, Magnus, Robot Fighter, Beauty and the Beast, Dark Shadows, Hero Alliance, and many others \u2014 including Exposure and Jade Warriors for Image Comics and, most recently, for Keenspot.
