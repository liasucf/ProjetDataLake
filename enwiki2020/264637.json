Dazie 1908 The Ziegfeld Follies was a series of elaborate theatrical revue productions on Broadway in New York City from 1907 to 1931, with renewals in 1934 and 1936. They became a radio program in 1932 and 1936 as The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air. ==Founding and history== Inspired by the Folies Berg\u00e8re of Paris, the Ziegfeld Follies were conceived and mounted by Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., reportedly at the suggestion of his then- wife, the stage actress and singer Anna Held. The shows' producers were turn- of-the-twentieth-century producing titans Klaw & Erlanger. The Follies were a series of lavish revues, something between later Broadway shows and the more elaborate high class vaudeville and variety show. The first Follies was produced in 1907 at the roof theatre Jardin de Paris.\"Follies of 1907\"The New York Times, July 9, 1907 During the Follies era, many of the top entertainers, including W. C. Fields, Eddie Cantor, Josephine Baker, Fanny Brice, Ann Pennington, Bert Williams, Eva Tanguay, Bob Hope, Will Rogers, Ruth Etting, Ray Bolger, Helen Morgan, Louise Brooks, Marilyn Miller, Ed Wynn, Gilda Gray, Nora Bayes and Sophie Tucker appeared in the shows.\"Flo Ziegfeld-Billie Burke Papers\" nypl.org, accessed December 3, 2011 The Ziegfeld Follies were also famous for their display of many beautiful chorus girls, commonly known as Ziegfeld Girls, who \"paraded up and down flights of stairs as anything from birds to battleships.\"\"Ziegfeld Biography\" pbs.org, accessed December 3, 2011 They usually wore elaborate costumes by designers such as Ert\u00e9, Lady Duff Gordon and Ben Ali Haggin.

These later efforts failed miserably. When the show toured, the 1934 edition was recorded in its entirety, from the overture to play-out music, on a series of 78 rpm discs, which were edited by the record producer David Cunard to form an album of the highlights of the production and which was released as a CD in 1997. ==Films based on the Ziegfeld Follies== New Amsterdam Theatre, New York In 1937, at the 9th Academy Awards, the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film, The Great Ziegfeld produced the previous year won the Best Picture (called \"Outstanding Production\"),\"Ceremonies 1937\" oscars.org, retrieved June 16, 2019 starring William Powell as Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. and co-starring Myrna Loy (as Ziegfeld's second wife Billie Burke), Luise Rainer (as Anna Held, which won her an Academy Award for Best Actress), and Frank Morgan as Jack Billings.\"'The Great Ziegfeld' Overview, Cast and Synopsis\" tcm.com, retrieved June 16, 2019 Featuring numbers by Ray Bolger, Dennis Morgan, Virginia Bruce, and Harriet Hoctor, the film gave a glimpse into what the Follies were really like.

In 1962, cabaret singer Jack Malcolmson, who was performing at the Richmond Football Club (Australian rules) Social Club in Richmond, Melbourne, adapted the song into the Tigers' new club song, We're From Tigerland, at the request of Richmond committee member Alf Barnett. (Previously, Richmond's club song had been Onward The Tigers, to the tune of Waltzing Matilda.) In 2014, Melbourne's Herald Sun ranked We're From Tigerland as the best club song of any Australian Football League team. Official versions of the song include a 1972 recording by the Fable Singers, who recorded most AFL club songs, and a 2018 recording including Richmond legends Matthew Richardson and Kevin Bartlett.Tigers tune-up for Club song Richmond Football Club Row, Row, Row has also been adapted by America Football Club in Rio de Janeiro as its anthem, the Hino do America, with America supporter and famous Brazilian composer Lamartine Babo helping adapt the song.Famoso hino do America \u00e9 um pl\u00e1gio, conclui professor de m\u00fasica da UFRJ (Portuguese)] Globo E Sporte The 1971 Stephen Sondheim musical Follies takes place at a reunion of showgirls from the Weissman Follies, a fictional revue inspired by the Ziegfeld Follies. In addition to featuring \"ghosts\" of statuesque showgirls from the heyday of the revues, the musical includes many songs and production numbers that are intended to evoke the types of entertainment typically featured in the Ziegfeld Follies and other revues of the period. Examples include parade of showgirls (\"Beautiful Girls\"); a torch song (Losing My Mind); a baggy pants comic song (\"The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues\"); and a novelty song (\"Rain on the Roof\"). In The Drowsy Chaperone there is a character by the name of Victor Feldzieg, the producer of Feldzieg's Follies, a parody of Ziegfeld Follies. ==See also== * Academy of Music/Riviera Theatre * By the Light of the Silvery Moon * Encores! * Esther's Follies * The Fabulous Palm Springs Follies * Alfred Cheney Johnston * The Passing Show * Joseph Urban * Ziegfeld Theatre ==References== ==External links== * Ziegfeld on Musicals101.com * Ziegfeld Follies at Internet Broadway Database Category:Musicals by Irving Berlin Category:1907 musicals Category:Broadway musicals Category:Dance companies in the United States Category:Dance in New York City ",
