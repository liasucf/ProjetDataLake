    "text": "AC/DC Live is the second live album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released on 27 October 1992. Two versions were released, one containing a single CD, with the second version being a double album on LP and CD known as AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition. A feature-length live video, AC/DC: Live at Donington, was released concurrently.AC/DC: Live at Donington on IMDB The double album AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition was released a month after the single-disc version, in a slipcased two-disc \"book\" (similar in shape to old CD longboxes) and containing an AC/DC dollar note known as \"Angus Bucks\". Both editions of the album were re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series. ==Track listings== Disclaimer: guitar and vocal overdubs were added during post-production, so the original audio (found on bootlegs) will be slightly different from the album version. The recordings from the dates listed below were used as a basis before being edited. These dates are not listed in the album booklet and were confirmed by fans synchronizing bootlegs with the album. ===1 CD edition=== ===2 CD \"Collector's Edition\"=== The Japanese version includes the bonus track \"Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be\" (Donington Park, Leicestershire, England; 17 August 1991) which was the b-side of the \"Highway To Hell\" (live) single. This track was later included on the deluxe edition of Backtracks in 2009. Even though \"Sin City\" appears to be performed at the Point Theatre in Dublin on 26 April 1991, as Brian Johnson says in the intro on the album, \"We've got a song for you, Dublin\", at the real Dublin show he actually said, \"OK Dublin, we've got a song especially for you\" (a bootleg recording of the show exists). The intro on the album is taken from the performance at King's Hall in Belfast on 27 April 1991 - Johnson mentioning Dublin is a genuine mistake. The performance itself was recorded at the NEC in Birmingham on 23 April 1991. The sound of the audience and guitar feedback at the very start of \"Shoot to Thrill\" is taken from the Donington performance where the previous track, \"Thunderstruck\", was recorded. The performance itself was recorded at the NEC in Birmingham on 23 April 1991. ===Vinyl 2 LP \"Collector's Edition\"=== \"Moneytalks\" and \"Are You Ready\" were excluded from the vinyl set. == Reception == Barry Weber of AllMusic writes: \"All too often, a live album is a cheaply made, rushed recording that only serves as a testament to a band's decline. AC/DC Live, however, shows what makes this band different from their peers - here they are still entirely capable of pulling off a great live show. This ranks among the best live metal albums of the '90s.\" Classic Rock wrote that \"Live is a triumphant refutation to anyone who still claims \u2018DC died with Bon. Jonno [Brian Johnson] is in fine voice and good humour throughout, and the live setting gives Angus space to stretch out a bit.\" ==Chart positions== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Chart ! scope=\"col\" | Peak position |- | rowspan=\"10\" |1992-1993 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |2000 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2001 |- |- | rowspan=\"3\" |2003 |- |- |- |2004 |- |2007 |- | rowspan=\"4\" |2008 |- |- |- |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2009 |- |- |2010 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2014 |- |- | rowspan=\"3\" |2015 |- |- |- |2017 |- |2018 |- |2019 |} === Collector's Edition === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Chart (1992) ! align=\"center\" |Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==Certifications== ==Personnel== *Brian Johnson \u2013 lead vocals *Angus Young \u2013 lead guitar *Malcolm Young \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals *Cliff Williams \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals *Chris Slade \u2013 drums, percussion ==See also== * Live at Donington (AC/DC) * Plug Me In * Backtracks ==References== Category:1992 live albums Category:Albums produced by Bruce Fairbairn Category:AC/DC live albums ",
