Clyde is located 21 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of the City of Parramatta. Clyde is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. ==History== Clyde is named for the River Clyde in Scotland and was thought to be a suitable name because a subdivision of land made in 1878 here was called New Glasgow. Rosehill Junction was the name of the railway station that opened here in 1882, just west of the bridge over the Duck River . It was a junction for the Western railway line with the Carlingford railway line and Sandown railway line. The Commissioner of Railways Edward Miller Grant Eddy renamed the station Clyde Junction,The Department of Railways Research and Information Section (1966) Railway Quiz (Department of Railways) p11 before settling upon the name Clyde in 1883 saying: New Glasgow is close by and as old Glasgow is watered by the Clyde, to which Duck River has been likened, perhaps Clyde would not be unacceptable. The station became Clyde Junction in 1901 but reverted to Clyde in April 1904. ==Commercial area== Clyde is exclusively an industrial and commercial area, featuring factories, workshops and warehouses. Clyde has no permanent population. ==Transport== Clyde railway station used to be a junction for the Western and Inner West & Leppington lines with the Carlingford line, of the Sydney Trains network before the Carlingford line closed in January 2020. ==See also== *Leightonfield ==References== *The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:City of Parramatta Category:Sydney localities ",
