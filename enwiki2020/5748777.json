    "text": "The song was used by Falun applying for the 1992 Olympic Winter Games. \"The Way You Are\" is a pop song that was recorded by Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog and Ola H\u00e5kansson of the band Secret Service in 1986. The song was used to promote Falun, Sweden as a candidate for hosting the 1992 Olympic Winter Games. Falun was not selected to host the Games, but the song became a big hit in Sweden. The song on the B-side, \"Fly Like the Eagle\", was also a duet by F\u00e4ltskog and H\u00e5kansson. Both songs were featured in the documentary It's Time for Sweden. The single reached No. 1 in Sweden, but was not successful in the rest of the world. Though outside Sweden, The Way You Are received extensive airplay by FM stations at least in Brazil, during the 1987-89 period, as it can still be seen by the numerous blogs and websites in that country displaying either translations or links to direct streaming of that song. ==Song versions== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Version !Length !Released on |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Single Version |rowspan=\"3\"|4:05 |\"The Way You Are\", 7\" and 12\" vinyl |- |My Love My Life - Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog |- |The Very Best of Secret Service - Secret Service |- |Instrumental Version |4:05 |\"The Way You Are\", 12\" vinyl |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Edited Alternate Mix |rowspan=\"2\"|3:47 |That's Me - The Greatest Hits - Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog |- |Eyes of a Woman (2005 Remaster) \\- Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog |- |12\" Extended Version |6:33 |\"The Way You Are\", 12\" vinyl |- |Extended Version |5:47 |Aux Deux Magots - Secret Service |- |} ==Track listings== ;7\" vinyl # \"The Way You Are\" (4:10) # \"Fly Like the Eagle\" (3:06) ;12\" vinyl # \"The Way You Are\" (Extended Version) (6:32) # \"The Way You Are\" (Instrumental Version) (4:07) # \"The Way You Are\" (7\" Version) (4:07) ==Chart trajectories== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\"|Chart (1986) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) |align=\"center\"|1 |} ==References== Category:1986 singles Category:Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog songs Category:Number-one singles in Sweden Category:Songs written by Alexander Bard Category:Songs written by Tim Norell Category:Songs written by Ola H\u00e5kansson Category:English-language Swedish songs Category:Vocal duets Category:1986 songs ",
