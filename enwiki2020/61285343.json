He studied at \"Ohel Shem\" high school and received his B.Sc. (1985) and M.sc. (1987) in mechanical engineering from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology. Title of his M.Sc. thesis: Integration of a CNC Lathe and a Robot in a Flexible Manufacturing Cell. Advisor: Prof. Ehud Lenz. Between 1987-1990 Shraga worked as a scientist in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) \u2013 Division of Manufacturing Technologies in Sydney, Australia, developing a robotic system for the processing of colored gemstones. He completed his Ph.D. in the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, at the department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics in 1994. Title of his Ph.D. thesis: Information Transfer in Sensor Based Travel Aid for the Blind. Advisors: Prof. Yoram Koren and Prof. Johann Borenstein. The NavBelt, a navigation device for the blind and visually impaired using mobile robotics technology, that was developed based on this thesis, is one of the first robotic aids for the blind. The Navbelt lead to the development of the GuideCane, that was awarded the best robotics invention by Discover Magazine in 1998. ==Work== Shraga Shoval returned to Israel in 1994 for post-doctorate in the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering at the Technion, and until 2000 he was a research fellow and head of the Robotics and Computer-aided Manufacturing Laboratory at the Faculty of Industrial Engineering & Management at the Technion. Between 1996-1997 he worked as a consultant for Chrysler Corporation in the development of one of the first unmanned passenger vehicles for their Automatic Durability Road test (ADR) facility at the Chrysler Proving Ground in Chelsea, Michigan. In 1998 he joined the Department of Industrial Engineering & Management at Ariel University (then the College of Judea and Samaria), first as an adjunct lecturer, and in 2000 as a senior lecturer. In 2001 he designed and established the first robotics laboratory at Ariel University. In this framework he initiated the first research activity in Israel that utilized robotics technology as a counter-terrorism response in tunnel environments. Shraga served as the department chair of Industrial Engineering and Management between 2000-2007, and 2009-2015. He became an associate professor in 2005 and on his sabbatical (2007-2008) he worked at the Defence and Systems Institute (DASI) at the University of South Australia. From 2015 to 2016 he was on sabbatical in Australia at the University of New South Wales, and when he returned in 2016, he was elected as Dean of the Engineering Faculty at Ariel University. ==Research activities== *Autonomous mobile systems *Computer integrated manufacturing *Systems Engineering ==Publications== Prof. Shoval has authored more than 130 scientific publications, including a textbook, \u201cComputer Integrated Manufacturing\u201d (in Hebrew), that was published by the Open University of Israel (2012). Shoval has also registered a patent for \u201cDual tracked mobile robot for motion in rough terrain\u201d. ==Selected articles== * Shoval S., Borenstein J., Koren Y.: \u201cThe Navbelt - A Computerized Travel Aid for the Blind based on Mobile Robotics Technology\u201d, IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, Vol. 45, No. 11, November 1998, pp. 1376-1386. * Rimon E., Shoval S., Shapiro A., \u201cDesign of a Spider Robot for Motion with Quasistatic Force Constraints\u201d, Journal of Autonomous Robots, 10, 2001, pp.279-296. * Shoval S., Sinriech D., \u201cAnalysis of LandMark Configuration for Absolute Positioning of Autonomous Vehicles\u201d, The Journal of Manufacturing systems, 20(1) 2001, pp. 44-54. * Shoval S., Ulrich I., Borenstein J., \u201cComputerized Obstacle Avoidance for the Blind and Visually Impaired\u201d, IEEE Journal of Robotics and Automation, March 2003 special issue on Robots in the Service of the Disabled.
