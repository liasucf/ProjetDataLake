    "text": "Robert W \"Bob\" FloydFloyd had his middle name \"Willoughby\" legally changed to \"W\" but deemed abbreviating it as \"W.\" valid (DOD form DD 48-1, personal papers, Stanford University Archive catalog SC 625 box 4) (June 8, 1936 \u2013 September 25, 2001) was a computer scientist. His contributions include the design of the Floyd\u2013Warshall algorithm (independently of Stephen Warshall), which efficiently finds all shortest paths in a graph, Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm for detecting cycles in a sequence, and his work on parsing. In one isolated paper he introduced the important concept of error diffusion for rendering images, also called Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering (though he distinguished dithering from diffusion). He pioneered in the field of program verification using logical assertions with the 1967 paper Assigning Meanings to Programs. This was a contribution to what later became Hoare logic. Floyd received the Turing Award in 1978. == Life == Born in New York City, Floyd finished high school at age 14. At the University of Chicago, he received a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in liberal arts in 1953 (when still only 17) and a second bachelor's degree in physics in 1958. Floyd was a college roommate of Carl Sagan.Stanford University Archives, Catalog SC 625, box 7 Floyd became a staff member of the Armour Research Foundation (now IIT Research Institute) at Illinois Institute of Technology in the 1950s. Becoming a computer operator in the early 1960s, he began publishing many papers, including on compilers (particularly parsing). He was a pioneer of operator-precedence grammars, and is credited with initiating the field of programming language semantics in . He was appointed an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University by the time he was 27 and became a full professor at Stanford University six years later. He obtained this position without a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree. He was a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, maintains, and supports the programming languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1974. He received the Turing Award in 1978 \"for having a clear influence on methodologies for the creation of efficient and reliable software, and for helping to found the following important subfields of computer science: the theory of parsing, the semantics of programming languages, automatic program verification, automatic program synthesis, and analysis of algorithms\". Floyd worked closely with Donald Knuth, in particular as the major reviewer for Knuth's seminal book The Art of Computer Programming, and is the person most cited in that work. He was co-author, with Richard Beigel, of the textbook The Language of Machines: an Introduction to Computability and Formal Languages. Floyd supervised seven Ph.D. graduates. Floyd married and divorced twice, first with Jana M. Mason and then computer scientist Christiane Floyd, and he had four children. In his last years he suffered from Pick's disease, a neurodegenerative disease, and thus retired early in 1994. His hobbies included hiking, and he was an avid backgammon player: == Selected publications == * * * * * * == Notes == == Further reading == * * ==External links== * Obituary in the Stanford Report * Chiron investigation * Category:1936 births Category:2001 deaths Category:American computer scientists Category:Turing Award laureates Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery Category:Formal methods people Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Stanford University School of Engineering faculty ",
