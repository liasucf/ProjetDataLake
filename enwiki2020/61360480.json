In the beginning of the 1870s, with the construction of the Companhia Paulista de Estradas de Ferro main line from Jundia\u00ed to Campinas, the station was its start point of the line, serving as a connection station between both SPR and Paulista lines. Since 1994, it's operated by CPTM and part of the Line 7-Ruby Operational Extension.
