    "text": "The Sooty Show is a British children's television series, created by Harry Corbett, and produced for the BBC from 1955 to 1967, and then for ITV from 1968 until 1992. The programme, part of the Sooty franchise, focuses on the mischievous adventures of the glove puppet character of the same name, alongside his friends Sweep and Soo, and their handler. Between 1955 to 1976, Corbett presented the programme until his retirement, before it was taken over by his son Matthew Corbett. It also co-starred Marjorie Corbett as the voice of Soo from the character's debut in 1964, until her retirement in 1981, whereupon she was replaced by Brenda Longman. The programme originally focused on a sketch-based format featuring slapstick comedy, music and stories, along with additional puppet characters, and later the incorporation of a studio audience. In the 1980s, Matthew changed the format towards a sitcom setting, in which he and the characters lived within a country cottage, and engaged in a new adventure in each episode. The new arrangement retained some elements from the original format such as songs, while introducing narration in a number of scenes featuring the puppets only. In both formats, guests featured in episodes, alongside the involvement of prop items for gunging and making messes of human performers and guest stars. The Sooty Show proved a success with children's television, due mainly to the popularity of Sooty, spawning additional sequels including Sooty & Co. in 1993, as well as several stage shows, and a spin-off educational series titled Learn With Sooty. The programme itself was later made available on VHS and DVD, featuring episodes from primarily the 1980s to 1990s. ==History== The Sooty Show was formed by Harry Corbett, a children's entertainer and magician, following the popularity of his puppet character Sooty on children's television. The BBC commissioned Corbett to produce a programme for them featuring the character and his antics, to feature on BBC One. Corbett continued to produce further episodes for the channel as the programme grew popular on British television, until to 1967, when he fell in disagreement with producers. After Paul Fox, the controller of BBC One, cancelled the programme, Corbett signed a deal to move it to ITV in 1968, with production assisted by Thames Television shortly after its return. The programme continued on for several years, before Thames lost the right to produce further episodes in 1992. ==Format== The Sooty Show featured two different formats during its broadcast history, the latter being later used in future programmes featuring the character of Sooty. The first format that it used, created by Harry Corbett, focused on a series of comedic sketches tailored towards amusing young children, including practical jokes, gunge and cream messes, and magic tricks. Over time, the format expanded with the addition of other characters, and introduced a studio audience element to the programme consisting of young children, as well as incorporating music and guest stars to episodes. The format was maintained when the programme was moved from the BBC to ITV in 1968, and when it was taken over by Harry's son Matthew, after his retirement in 1976. The second format was devised around 1981 by Matthew, who opted to move away from the comedic sketches and series of misadventures for Sooty, and focus on a single misadventure in each episode that was faced by Sooty and his friends, all within a sitcom arrangement. The new arrangement saw Sooty and his friends living with Matthew within a house, with some episodes featuring outdoor locations when required by the episode's script. Several elements were still retained, including magic tricks, singing, and guest stars; story-telling was also retained, but was phased out during the course of the 1980s. New elements incorporated into the show included the use of narration for some scenes focused on the puppets entirely, the use of educational elements in some stories, and the creation of specially designed sets for the puppet characters, which would be later updated and maintained in subsequent programmes in the Sooty franchise - in particular, a bathroom set created for the programme was specially designed so that its miniature faucets and shower dispensed running water. ==Cast== === Presenters === * Harry Corbett (1955\u20131975) - The show's first presenter and the creator of Sooty. Corbett ran the programme mostly within a sketch-based format throughout his era, later creating the characters of Sweep and Soo to accompany the show. His most notable contribution to the show, aside from the puppet characters, was the catchphrase he used to conclude an episode's run, that would continue to be used by his successors - \"Bye bye, everybody. Bye bye.\" Harry returned to the programme as a guest star during his son Matthew's era, and was knighted with an OBE for his contributions with the programme and characters following his retirement. * Matthew Corbett (1976\u20131992) - The show's second presenter. Matthew took over in 1976, having initially worked in children's television, and maintained the same format as his father up until 1981. After the show's format was changed to a sitcom-based arrangement, Matthew transformed himself on screen into a well-meaning father figure, but also a somewhat sarcastic character who was slightly conceited with pomposity and boasting, to complement the mayhem created by Sooty and Sweep. * Marjorie Corbett (1964\u20131981) - The first voice of Soo, whom her husband Harry had created as a talking female panda. She remained a part of the show until after the first series of the format change. According to Brenda Longman, who took over the voice of Soo, the reason Marjorie was replaced was because her heavy smoking caused her to be short of breath. It was also felt that she made Soo sound too old. * Brenda Longman (1981\u20131992) - The second voice of Soo starting from the second series of the format change, following Majorie's retirement from the role, who also made frequent guest appearances as various characters within the show's sitcom format. Longman remained with the programme until its conclusion, and continued to work with Matthew and his successor Richard Cadell on subsequent sequels of The Sooty Show and other Sooty productions in the same role. ===Puppet Characters=== * Sooty \u2013 A mute yellow male bear, and the main protagonist of the show alongside its human presenters. The show introduced his trademark traits of tapping a surface to whisper into the presenter's ear what he wishes to say, owning a magic wand, the use of his magic words \"Izzy wizzy, let's get busy!\", and his fondness for using a water pistol. * Sweep \u2013 A grey male dog, and Sooty's best friend, who was created in 1957. His trademark voice of bizarre squeaks was achieved by his original puppeteer Leslie Corbett, through a reed from a saxophone in his mouth to create the sounds. * Soo \u2013 A calm and collected female panda with a normal human voice, who was created in 1964. The character's design was towards being a foil for both Sooty and Sweep, but with a motherly-like nature to her personality. She was originally voiced by Harry's wife Marjorie Corbett until 1981, whereupon after the show's format changed, she was voiced by Brenda Longman until the show's conclusion in 1992. * Butch \u2013 A dark brown male dog, similar to Sweep, but able to talk. Introduced by Harry Corbett in the early 1970s, the character was withdrawn by his son Matthew in 1980, returning to guest star in the role of a villain. * Mr. Woof - A Yorkshire terrier who is a friend of Sweep, he barks in communication, eats and sleeps. * Ramsbottom \u2013 A brown male snake who spoke in a deep Yorkshire accent and had the habit of telling rather convoluted stories and ditties. The character was created by Harry Corbett, but retired by his son Matthew. He was originally voiced by Bill Garrett, the company model and prop maker who used his own strong Yorkshire accent and made the original puppet. * Little Cousin Scampi \u2013 A mute white bear and Sooty's cousin. The character was created by Matthew Corbett and introduced in the Series 15 episode of the same name in 1990, and was designed to be a mischievous bear who liked pranks, making inventions and caring for mice. The character became a regular member of the puppet characters from 1991, and beyond the programme's conclusion in 1992. ==Episodes== ==Legacy== The Sooty Show proved immensely popular with children and helped to develop the Sooty franchise greatly, culminating in the formation of additional television programmes that would run on the format brought in by Matthew Corbett in the 1980s. After the programme's conclusion, it was followed with a sequel in 1993, titled Sooty & Co.. The programme also spawned an educational spin-off series for young children, titled Learn With Sooty, that was produced for the direct-to-video market between 1989 to 1991, and several stage shows involving the puppets, Matthew, and Connie Creighton. It's early success led to it receiving a short-run comic strip based on the character, for the children's magazine Playhour between 1960 and 1961, drawn by Gordon Hutchings.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/h/hutchings_gordon.htm Outside the UK, the show was also given international broadcasts in other countries: these included ABC in Australia; TVNZ in New Zealand; and the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. ==UK home media releases== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !VHS Title !Release Date !Episodes |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ||
