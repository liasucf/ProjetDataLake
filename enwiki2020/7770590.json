Pseudonym of Joaquim Guilherme Gomes Coelho poet, playwright, and novelist, the first great novelist of modern Portuguese middle-class society. His novels, extremely popular in his lifetime and still widely read in Portugal today, are written in a simple and direct style accessible to a large public. His first attacks of tuberculosis forced him to resign as deputy professor at the medical school of Porto. He had already published several tales of country life in the Jornal do Porto. Retiring to the coastal town of Ovar for his health, he wrote the novel for which he is best known, As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor (1867; \"The Pupils of the Dean\"), depicting country life and scenery in a simple and appealing style. It was based on his own family situation and described the influence of the English on Portuguese culture. (His mother was English.) Encouraged by its immediate success, he published Uma Fam\u00edlia Inglesa (1868; \"An English Family\"), a novel describing English society in Porto. Dinis' poems and plays were published posthumously, but he is best-remembered for his novels. As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor had gone through 14 editions by 1900. ==Works== * As Pupilas do Senhor Reitor (1867) * A Morgadinha dos Canaviais (1868) * Uma Fam\u00edlia Inglesa (1868) * Ser\u00f5es da Prov\u00edncia (1870) * Os Fidalgos da Casa Mourisca (1871) * Poesias (1873) * In\u00e9ditos e Dispersos (1910) * Teatro In\u00e9dito (1946\u20131947) == External links == * * Category:Portuguese medical writers Category:University of Porto alumni Category:People from Porto Category:1839 births Category:1871 deaths Category:Portuguese male novelists Category:19th-century Portuguese writers Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:19th-century Portuguese novelists Category:19th-century male writers ",
