    "text": "On the Postcolony is a collection of critical essays by Cameroonian philosopher and political theorist Achille Mbembe. The book is Mbembe's most well-known work and explores questions of power and subjectivity in postcolonial Africa. The book is split into an introduction, six essays \u2013 \"Of Commandement,\" \"Of Private Indirect Government,\" \"The Aesthetics of Vulgarity,\" \"The Thing and Its Doubles,\" \"Out of the World,\" and \"God's Phallus\" \u2013 and a conclusion. It has been characterized as \"one of the most lastingly provocative and stimulating contributions to the theoretical literature on the postcolonial state in sub-Saharan Africa\" and is the winner of the 2006 Bill Venter/Altron Award. On the Postcolony was first published in French in 2000 under the title De la postcolonie: essai sur l'imagination politique dans l'Afrique contemporaine. This edition featured a different organizational structure than the English version and did not include Chapter 4, \"The Thing and Its Doubles.\" The first English edition of the book was published in 2001 by the University of California Press. Two of the chapters included, \"The Aesthetics of Vulgarity\" and \"The Thing and Its Doubles,\" had been released previously as journal articles in 1992 and 1996, respectively. On the Postcolony was republished in May 2015 by Wits University Press in an African edition. In this edition's preface, Mbembe describes the collection of essays as == Background and theoretical context == On the Postcolony was written in the context of African colonization by European powers (France and the United Kingdom primarily), which began in the late nineteenth century and ended with decolonization after World War II, concentrated in the early 1960s. Political and social ideologies active in this post-colonial era include Pan- Africanism, Negritude, African Socialism and Marxism, capitalism, and anarchism. In a conversation with the University of the Witwatersrand\u2019s Isabel Hofmeyr, Mbembe states that he wrote most of On the Postcolony in the early 1990s as Afro-Marxism was fading in influence, leaving African social theory in need of new paradigms and modes of analysis. Mbembe\u2019s twin inspirations were Congolese music, in which he found \u201cthe social memory of the present\u2026 the drama of African self-realization unfolding\u201d and the Francophone African novel, particularly the work of Sony Labou Tansi, in which \u201ctime always appeared as heterogeneous and unpredictable.\u201d At this point of crisis in theory, Mbembe saw this music and literature filling the gaps and wrote the essays which became On the Postcolony in the spirit of these works. Additional influences included post-War French philosophers and writers Bataille, Merleau-Ponty, Foucault, Blanchot, Deleuze, Derrida, Levinas, Ricoeur, Castoriadis, and de Certeau. == Content == While self-contained, each essay contributes a facet to Mbembe's theory of the postcolony and involves a different mode of analysis. These range from the historical, economic, and political (in the initial two chapters) to the literary, fictional, psychoanalytical, philosophical, and theological (in the later four). In Mbembe's view, the overall purpose of his book is to \"model the complexities of African life for the Africans\" and \"theorize time and subjectivity (the consciousness of self and of time) in conditions of a life that is fundamentally contingent and precarious.\" === Introduction: Time on the Move === In the introduction, translated by A.M. Berrett, Mbembe locates the subsequent essays in the modern context in which, he argues, discourse about Africa \u2013 by both Westerners and Africans \u2013 has become largely trapped in Western tropes and fantasies in which Africa is rarely \u201cseen as possessing things and attributes properly part of \u2018human nature\u2019\u201d and when so, these are considered \u201cof lesser value, little importance, and poor quality.\u201d In this view, Africa is the \u201cabsolute Other\u201d or anti-West, and it is analyzed in terms of lack and void rather than presence: \u201cone of the metaphors through which the West represents the origin of its own norms, develops as self-image, and integrates this image into the set of signifiers asserting what it supposed to be its identity.\u201d This has resulted in a distortion of discourse about Africa because the continent is evoked primarily for the purpose of meditation on the West rather than for its own reasons and own purposes. It is this handicapped mode of analysis which Mbembe analyzes and from which he departs in the subsequent essays about the history and present of the postcolonial African subject. === Of Commandement === The first chapter takes an economic approach to analyzing the African experience under colonial rule (commandement) and explores the types of rationality used to rule the postcolony, as well as the postcolonial transfer of ruling activities from the African state to Western economic actors (exemplified by the structural adjustment policies of the late twentieth century). Mbembe first explores colonial sovereignty, the violences which created it, and the logic that sustained it. There were two traditions of viewing the colonized to justify colonialism: the first (which Mbembe calls Hegelian) sees the native as an animal possessing drives but not capacities (an object) which can be seen only as the property of power, while the second (which Mbembe calls Bergsonian) sees him as an animal to be domesticated and cared for. He outlines the four properties of commandement - a departure from common law such that colonial companies receive almost royal rights, a regime of privileges and immunities, the lack of distinction between ruling and civilizing, and circular logic such that the purpose of rule was that people obey (rather than for some public good) - and analyzes colonial subjection and the mechanisms through which it is authorized. Mbembe then traces the evolution of these forces to the post-colony, discussing the African state and the global economic order which constrains it. === On Private Indirect Government === This chapter deals with many of the same processes as \"Of Commandement\" - violence, privatization of the public, appropriation of the means of livelihood - but examines how they unfold in a nonlinear manner (an aspect Mbembe calls entanglement). The majority of the chapter takes the form of an economic analysis of colonial and postcolonial history, examining how the government has become an instrument for transforming public good into private gain. Two points raised are the relations between salary, citizenship and clientelism in Africa: under certain regimes of arbitrariness, the salary is tied to government allegiance. The second point is that an instrumentalization of violence exists in the postcolony (which appears to be attempting a new form of legitimate domination); struggles against these forms of violence end up being reproductions of disorder rather than steps towards democracy. \u201cOn Private Indirect Government\u201d was translated by A. M. Berrett. === The Aesthetics of Vulgarity === In this chapter, Mbembe examines the \"banality of power\" through the case study of Cameroon. The phrase \"banality of power\" refers both to the multiplication and routinization of bureaucratic and arbitrary rules and to elements of the obscene and grotesque (in the terminology of Mikhail Bakhtin) intrinsic in systems of domination. It explores \"the complex interplay of consent and coercion in the postcolony and the carnivalesque disposition of both rulers and ruled in the production and maintenance of hegemonic relations of power and subversion.\" The chapter was originally published under the name \u201cProvisional Notes on the Postcolony\u201d in the academic journal Africa and \u201cThe Banality of Power and the Aesthetics of Vulgarity in the Postcolony\u201d in Public Culture, both in 1992. It was translated into English by Janet Roitman and Murray Last, with Mbembe's assistance. The earlier versions of the chapter have together been cited over 1000 times, according to Google Scholar. === The Thing and Its Doubles === This chapter is a study of the \"thing\" \u2013 the \u201cFather\u201d or autocrat \u2013 and its representation in Cameroonian cartoons of the 1990s. The cartoons were published following a wave of protests known as \"Operation Ghost Towns\" which resulted in a period of authoritarian softening in 1991. In his essay, Mbembe establishes the context of the cartoon images and spells out their anthropological status and effectiveness. He then shows how as a crude cartoon, \"the autocrat acts as both text and pretext for a general commentary on power in the postcolony\" and commentary on the history of the immediate present (written as hallucination, through the form of the cartoon). This chapter, along with \"The Aesthetics of Vulgarity,\" explores the thought of ordinary citizens about the postcolonial government. The chapter was originally published in Volume 36 of the academic journal Cahier d\u2019\u00e9tudes africaines (Journal of African Studies) in 1996 under the name \u201cLa \u2018Chose\u2019 et ses doubles dans la caricature camerounaise\u201d (The \u201cThing\u201d and Its Doubles in the Cameroonian Cartoon). It was translated into English by A. M. Berrett. === Out of the World === In this chapter, Mbembe shifts his focus to a more philosophical matter: the phenomenology of violence and death. He explores the forms through which death and violence are accomplished in present-day Africa and how the violence of death comes to encompass all spheres of life. Two main issues are considered: first, the burden of the arbitrariness involved in killing what has been already defined as nothingness \u2013 an empty figure \u2013 and second, the way the negated and disempowered subject takes on the act of their own destruction during death. The chapter was translated into English by A. M. Berrett. === God's Phallus === The final chapter of On the Postcolony takes a philosophical and theological approach to analysis of the \"divine libido\" - the emanation of a bio-psychic energy located chiefly in sexuality. The \u201cPhallus\u201d of the chapter's title refers to the form of the colonial power. Mbembe's analysis leads him to three conclusions: first, that \"the phantasm of power consist[s] in rubbing the two imaginaries of death and sexuality together... [and] domination consists in sharing the same phantasms,\" second, that conversion means to be spoken through by a god (an act of erotic intercourse), and finally, that \"to produce religious truth, faith and a certain stupefaction must overlap.\" Mbembe has described this chapter as \"an allegoric dialogue with Frantz Fanon... it suggests that in order to exit the Fanonian cul-de-sac \u2014 the dead-end of the generalised circulation and exchange of death as the condition for becoming human \u2014 it is important to examine in what way, in a context of a life that is so precarious, disposing-of-death- itself could be, in fact, the core of a veritable politics of freedom.\" The chapter was translated into English by Steven Rendall. === Conclusion: The Final Matter === Mbembe ties up the book by returning to and bringing the analysis of the six chapters to bear on the original question: Who is the modern African? Is \"an ex-slave\" a true answer to this question? (\"Slave\" being defined as one on whom another claims the right to exercise their will). What remains of the African quest for self-determination \u2013 what is Africa today? He concludes with a suggestion that, in order to live as complete people, we must learn to exist in \"uncertainty, chance, irreality, even absurdity.\" The chapter was translated into English by Steven Rendall. == Critical reception == Critical reception of On the Postcolony has been overwhelmingly positive, with scholars praising Mbembe's analysis while offering their own contributions to the arguments presented. Academics including Ato Quayson, Bruce Janz, Adeleke Adeeko, Judith Butler, Stephen Ellis, Tejumola Olayinan, Jeremy Weate, Rita Barnard, Carola Lentz, Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch, and Mikael Karlstrom have published their perspectives on Mbembe's book since it was released in 2001. Ghanaian intellectual Ato Quayson of the University of Toronto calls the book \u201ca masterpiece of rhetorical and discursive styles\u2026 as much a philosophical treatise on questions of power as such as it is about African politics and political economy.\u201d He praises how Mbembe \u201cset[s] up a peculiarly rich variety of perspectival modulations\u201d which shed light on the four main difficulties regarding discourse about Africa: defining the audience for a discussion of Africa, navigating \u201cthe particular philosophical prisms through which any discussion of Africa has to situate itself,\u201d avoiding the \u201ccurious refraction of assumptions [which] comes to shape one's own statements,\u201d and establishing \u201ca manner in which to detail Africa not as a stable identity, but as itself a field of intersecting transitional realities moving at different rates of progress.\u201d According to Quayson, the light that On the Postcolony sheds on these problems \u201cmak[es] it a landmark text not just in terms of the thematic of African colonial and postcolonial realities, but more significantly, about the forms through which this thematic is to be methodologically refracted.\u201d In his view, Mbembe's approach to the framing of Africa offers a way out of the traditional impasse of framing Africa which avoids the blind optimism of Afrocentricity as well as the hopelessness of Afro-pessimism; therein lies the book's genius and its significance. The University of Central Florida's Bruce Janz praises Mbembe's rethinking the essentialist, post-structuralist, and \"disciplinary\" approaches to theorizing Africa and his \u201chinting at a fourth way, one which does not ignore the strengths of any of the three I have already mentioned, but tries to overcome the\u2026 limitations of each.\u201d He appreciates Mbembe's analyses of time and nothingness to travel from the \u201cpositive vision of African existence\u201d with which the book begins to the position that \u201clearning to enjoy as complete men and women\u2026 [requires] living and existing in uncertainty, chance, irreality, even absurdity.\" However, while praising Mbembe's analysis, Janz notes that \u201chints of something transformative are hardly developed at all\u201d; the book is excellent description but does not explain what can be done to overcome the challenges it elucidates. Another confusion, in Janz's view, is \u201cthat [Mbembe] announces early on that the issue at stake is the construction of the subject for him/herself, and then it seems to drop from the agenda.\u201d Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch of Paris Diderot University calls Mbembe's writing \u201csuperb\u201d and his analysis \u201csevere and uncontestable,\u201d yet wonders why Mbembe \u201chardly makes any references, except in a brief note, to modern African philosophers criticizing the ethno-philosophy movement\u201d as he does, such as Paulin Hountondji, Valentin Mudimbe, and B\u00e9chir Soule\u00efmane Diagne. \u201cNor does he subscribe, without really clarifying the reasons, to the problematics of \u2018postcoloniality\u2019 as discussed by the Subaltern Studies that he nevertheless knows very well,\u201d she continues. Coquery-Vidrovitch concludes that \u201c[Mbembe's] analysis has the merit of great intellectual coherence, even if one can reproach the author for proposing a model of general development necessarily a little disconnected from the realities and concrete alternatives on the ground.\u201d Another concern is that Mbembe\u2019s work veers into Afro-pessimism (a charge that Mbembe declares \u201cinaccurate\u201d). Coquery-Vidrovitch notes nihilist accents to the book and states that \u201cthe tone is that of despair,\u201d giving Africa \u201ca desperate image.\u201d Adeleke Adeeko, in a review published in the academic journal West African Review, states that although he initially had the same concern, after thinking deeply about the society depicted in Chinua Achebe\u2019s Anthills of the Savannah, he realized that Mbembe\u2019s philosophy was realist rather than pessimist. In other critiques, anthropologists like Carola Lentz object to what they see as Mbembe\u2019s \u201csweeping generalizations,\u201d and philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler further analyzes the sexual politics of power explored in \u201cGod\u2019s Phallus.\u201d In perhaps the most-harshly worded critique, British philosopher Jeremy Weate, writing in the journal African Identities, critiques the textual approach of On the Postcolony and of postcolonial theory more broadly. He argues that postcolonial theory is \u201cpresently trapped within a self-referential inscriptive paradigm\u201d that cannot recognize non-textual phenomena. On the Postcolony lacks a coherent and clearly defined theoretical position, he maintains, instead occupying \u201can ambiguous (and ambivalent) space somewhere between post-structuralism and existential phenomenology\u201d which results in a \u201ctheoretically confused\u201d project \u201cdevoid of productive existential engagement.\u201d Weate also takes issue with what he sees as Mbembe's erasure of intellectual predecessors and contemporaries (like Hountondji), which he traces partly to \u201can overreliance on a specific understanding of the intellectual\u201d which erases everyday and grassroots resistance and results in an attempt to \u201ctheoris[e]... effectively from a blank slate.\u201d Although Weate concedes that On the Postcolony\u2019s \u201cpartially occluded phenomenological/Deleuzian influence\u201d provides a path forward for critical theory, he ultimately condemns the book as \u201cdoomed to failure\u201d because \u201cit commits the double error of attempting to erase the past completely, as well as not providing any substantive ground for further development.\u201d In a response published in the same journal, Mbembe describes Weate's critique as \u201cprobably one of the least imaginative and most misleading rejoinders to the book,\u201d disputing Weate's assertions and philosophical understanding of his book. == Scholarly Impact == On the Postcolony is one of the most influential modern works on African theory: according to Google Scholar, it has been cited over 3,600 times by other academics (a standard used in the field of citation analysis to assess an article or book's impact). The \u201csecond generation\u201d \u2013 works citing On the Postcolony \u2013 have themselves been cited over 35,000 times in the past two decades, indicating the book's wide diffusion across the academy. The works influenced by On the Postcolony span the fields of African studies, philosophy, anthropology, sociology, political science, and critical theory, and include Ferguson\u2019s Global Shadows: Africa in the Neoliberal World Order and Puar\u2019s Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times. As a comparison, 82% of articles in the humanities are never cited at all and among the remaining 18%, the vast majority receive under five citations. Among all papers published in the Social Sciences in 2001, the 1% most-cited were those with over 66 citations. With its 3,660 citations as of January 2017 (4,722 if citations from the earlier versions of \u201cThe Aesthetics of Vulgarity\u201d are included), On the Postcolony is thus an extreme anomaly. == See also == * Postcolonialism * Achille Mbembe * World Literature * Postcolonial literature == Further reading == * Necropolitics == References == Category:2001 non-fiction books Category:21st-century essays Category:Cameroonian literature Category:Non- fiction literature ",
