However, by the 1930s much of Italy's mountain artillery was obsolescent and overdue for replacement. In 1934, the Italian firm of Ansaldo produced a new mountain howitzer design, the Obice da 75/18 modello 34, designed by Lt. Colonel Sergio Berlese who served in the Italian artillery. The modello 34 could be broken down into eight loads for transport. In the interest of standardization and logistics a version of the 75/18, the modello 35, was also used as the light howitzer component of normal field batteries. The modello 35 did not break down into smaller loads and had a split, rather than box, trail.Google Books: The Encyclopedia of Weapons The Italians sold the modello 35 abroad in order to obtain foreign currency. In 1940 a sizable batch was sold to Portugal, and more went to South American countries in exchange for raw materials. The gun was also used as the main armament of the Semovente 75/18 self-propelled gun where, due to its \"Effetto Pronto\" (HEAT) ammunition, it also had a good anti- tank capability. In 1941 some captured pieces were used against the Germans by the forces of the Commonwealth during the Battle of Crete and were probably present in the defence of Maleme airfield. Two of them are nowadays displayed next to the Battle of Crete monument in Heraklion. ==References== *Modello 34 on Builders Paradise *Modello 35 on \"Comando Supremo\" website *Obice da 75/18 on \"Italie 1935-45\" website Category:World War II mountain artillery Category:World War II artillery of Italy Category:World War II field artillery Category:Weapons of Portugal Category:75 mm artillery Category:Gio.
