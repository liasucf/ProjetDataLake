She later went to receive a 1-Year Conservatory certificate in Documentary Filmmaking from the New York Film Academy in Los Angeles, CA, and a Business and Management of Entertainment certificate from UCLA Extension in Los Angeles, CA. ==Films== Kseniya's first documentary Mask-Up talked about perception of female beauty by men and women.

A short film Visitors was nominated for Best Sci-Fi Short at the New York City International Film Festival, Vail Film Festival, and Newport Beach Film Festival. The film was well received in the review by Tinsel Town News Now. Yorsh also directed and produced the short documentary Love in Porn - an insider's look into the romantic lives of those who have succeeded in the adult film industry. The film screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 2016 and received distribution in Spain with Feelmakers, in the US with Play Festival Films and in France with Gonella. The bloggers spoke highly of the sex-positive way in which the film depicts the workers of the sex industry. In 2017 another short film she produced, Stand By Her, is going to Cannes as well. Kseniya Yorsh's latest collaboration is with a Panamanian director Eric Iglesias for whom she is producing a feature film about one girl's choice and test of her moral values. ==References== Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:New York Film Academy alumni ",
