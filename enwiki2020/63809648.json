    "text": "Charles Dunn Harrison (August 17, 1949 \u2013 April 13, 2020) was an American college basketball coach who served as head coach at the University of New Mexico and East Carolina University. A graduate of Guilford College, Harrison began his coaching career as a graduate assistant for Bob Knight at Indiana. He then held assistant positions with Clemson, Oklahoma and the National Basketball Association's Buffalo Braves. In 1979, following a second stint at Oklahoma, Harrison was hired as an assistant at New Mexico under head coach Norm Ellenberger. However, right before the team\u2019s season opener Ellenberger was suspended and later fired following the revelation of an academic fraud scandal nicknamed \u201cLobogate.\u201d Harrison was tapped as the new head coach and led the depleted team to a 6\u201322 record. Following the season he was replaced by the more seasoned Gary Colson. After a two-year stint as an assistant at Iowa State under Johnny Orr, Harrison was named head coach at East Carolina (ECU). He led the Pirates for five seasons, compiling a record of 51\u201390. In January, 1987, Harrison announced he would step down from ECU at the close of the season. Harrison died on April 13, 2020 at age 70. ==References== ==External links== *College record @ sports-reference.com Category:1949 births Category:2020 deaths Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:Basketball coaches from North Carolina Category:Buffalo Braves assistant coaches Category:Clemson Tigers men's basketball coaches Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States Category:Guilford College alumni Category:East Carolina Pirates men's basketball coaches Category:Indiana University alumni Category:Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball coaches Category:New Mexico Lobos men's basketball coaches Category:Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball coaches Category:People from Nash County, North Carolina ",
