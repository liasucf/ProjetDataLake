The museum opened on December 7, 1974 in McKnight Art Center, where it is still located today. It is best known for the large Venetian glass and marble mosaic by Joan Mir\u00f3 found on the facade of the building, titled Personnage Oiseaux, a mural on 80 panels. It is also well known for the large Martin H. Bush Outdoor Sculpture Collection of 80 works across 330 acres, which was named Top Ten among campus sculptures in 2006 by Public Art Review. The sculpture collection includes works by Fernando Botero, Andy Goldsworthy, Lila Katzen, Joan Mir\u00f3, Claes Oldenburg, Tom Otterness, Auguste Rodin, Sophia Vari, Elyn Zimmerman, and Francisco Zuniga. The Outdoor Sculpture Collection is part of the museum's permanent collection, which contains approximately 6,500 objects. The full collection is searchable online through the Ulrich Museum Collection Portal. The museum's permanent collection includes works by Benny Andrews, Diane Arbus, Barkley Hendricks, Nan Goldin, Zhang Huan, Sol LeWitt, Joan Mitchell, Gordon Parks, Kara Walker, and Andy Warhol, among many others. The collection also contains large groups of works by a number of artists, including Lee Adler, Minna Wright Citron, Gordon Parks, Marian Stephenson Patmore, and Harry Sternberg. == Personnages Oiseaux == Personnage Oiseaux (Bird People) is a mural by Joan Mir\u00f3, made up of thousands of glass and marble tesserae, which was first painted by Mir\u00f3, and converted into a mosaic mural by Ateliers Loire in Chartes, France. This mural was Mir\u00f3's only mural made of glass and marble, and one of the eleven he made during his lifetime. It was featured on the southern-facing wall from 1978 to 2011, when it was removed for repairs. The mural was losing between 300 and 400 tiles yearly, and the full cost of the repairs came out at $2.2 million; the mural returned in 2016. == References == Category:Art museums in Kansas Category:Wichita State University ",
