    "text": "Henry Hale Bliss, photo taken in Paris, France, 1873 The death of Henry Hale Bliss (June 13, 1830 - September 14, 1899) was the first recorded instance of a person being killed in a motor vehicle collision in the United States. ==Hit by a taxi== On September 13, 1899, at West 74th Street and Central Park West in New York City, Henry Hale Bliss, a 69 year old local real estate dealer, was alighting from a south bound 8th Avenue trolley car when an electric- powered taxicab (Automobile No. 43) struck him. Bliss hit the pavement, crushing his head and chest. He was taken by ambulance to Roosevelt Hospital, but upon arrival the house surgeon, Dr. Marny, said his injuries were too severe to survive, and Bliss died from his sustained injuries the next morning. Arthur Smith, the driver of the taxicab, claimed that a large truck occupied the right side of the avenue, making it necessary to drive his vehicle closer to the car. Smith was arrested and charged with manslaughter, but was subsequently acquitted on the grounds that he had no malice, nor was he negligent. The passenger of the taxi-cab, Dr. David Orr Edson, was the son of former New York City mayor Franklin Edson. ==Legacy== A plaque was dedicated at the site on September 13, 1999, to commemorate the centenary of this event. It reads: The ceremony was attended by his great-granddaughter, who placed roses on the place where Bliss was struck. == Family == Bliss's stepdaughter, Mary Alice Altmont Livingston, who assumed the surname \"Fleming\", was later tried for the murder of her mother, Bliss's ex-wife, Evelina Bliss, by means of poisoned chowder. She was found innocent. == See also == * Mary Ward \u2013 (1827-1869) Anglo-Irish scientist, the first person known to have been killed by an automobile, Ireland, 1869 * Bridget Driscoll \u2013 (1851/1852-1896) the first pedestrian to be killed in a collision with an automobile in the UK * Elaine Herzberg \u2013 the first pedestrian to be killed in an autonomous motor car crash ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * * Citystreets.org - Henry Bliss Plaque Category:1899 deaths Category:Road incident deaths in New York City Category:Pedestrian road incident deaths Category:American real estate businesspeople ",
