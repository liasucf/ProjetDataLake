    "text": "Winnie the Witch was originally a DC Thomson comic strip in The Beano in 1948 and later on in Sparky (comics) from 1965 to 1967, featuring a witch named Winnie. The strip was first drawn in the Beano by Jimmy Clark, and in Sparky by Bernard Greenbaum. The title character Winnie was a novice witch who would sometimes play mischievous tricks which mostly backfired. Also when trying to be helpful her poor mastery of magic gave undesired results, and she would often get into trouble with her boss the 'Chief Witch'. ==References== ==External links== * specimen strip Category:Beano strips Category:DC Thomson Comics strips Category:Comics about magic Category:British comics characters Category:Fictional British people Category:1948 comics debuts Category:1967 comics endings Category:Comics characters introduced in 1948 Category:Comics characters who use magic Category:Comics about women ",
