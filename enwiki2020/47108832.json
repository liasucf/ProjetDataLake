It has been operational since 1984 and is scheduled to be replaced in 2020. == Description == Blankenese High Lighthouse and Blankenese Low Lighthouse form a range of lights for ships sailing upriver on the Elbe. With a range of 8.4 kilometers, they have the longest range on the Unterelbe. The Blankenese High Lighthouse is 40-meters tall, white-and-red-striped concrete tower with a red steel lantern house was constructed in 1983. It is located in Baurs Park on the Kanonenberg, approximately 1,340 meters from the low light. Inside it has a round staircase leading to the top. Because of its height, the tower has an obstacle lighting for air transport. Construction began in 1983. The eleven- ton lantern house was assembled using a mobile crane. The range of lights went operational on 29 November 1984. The lighthouse is remotely controlled by the Seemansh\u00f6ft Pilot Centre. === Replacement === Due to adjustments to the Elbe fairway, both the High and the Low Lighthouses are scheduled to be replaced to a similar 62.25 m high at M\u00fchlenberg and demolished. == See also == * List of lighthouses and lightvessels in Germany == References == == External links == * * Data and images at leuchtturm-atlas.de * Data at leuchtturm-web.de * Description at leuchttuerme.net * Images and description Category:Lighthouses in Hamburg Category:Buildings and structures in Altona, Hamburg ",
