Considering him to be a strong prospect for the men's team, the club quickly arranged for his legal adoption by the club- affiliated Chalkiadakis family, which earned him Greek citizenship. He initially played with the youth team of Ergotelis, and signed his first professional contract with the club on 24 May 2011. He made his debut as a substitute on 11 December 2011, in a home match against club rival OFI. Bruno renewed his contract with the club on 21 August 2014, after a short-term dispute which temporarily placed him out of the team and had since been a regular starter. Despite Ergotelis' relegation at the end of the season, he impressed with his skills, having scored 5 goals in a total of 29 season appearances for the club. He scored his first goal in a 4-1 away win against Niki Volos on 21 September 2014. ===Panionios=== On 21 May 2015 Bruno was transferred to Greek Superleague champions Olympiacos, signing a 5-year contract with the club. He was eventually however not included in the club's roster selection and as a result, he was released from his contract to sign a two-year deal with fellow Superleague side Panionios as a free agent. Bruno spent the majority of the 2015\u221216 season playing as a substitute, making a total of 31 appearances for the club and scoring two goals during the Greek Cup Group stage. Panionios finished in fifth place and would have qualified for the Europa League second qualifying round, but they were eventually excluded from participating in the 2016\u201317 European competitions by UEFA for financial reasons. In the summer of 2016, Bruno breached his contract with Panionios after failing to report for the club's 2016\u221217 activities after his official leave for spending the summer vacation in his hometown expired. === Cascavel === During his stay in Brazil, Bruno played football for Paran\u00e1 local side Cascavel during the first half of 2017. === PAS Giannina === In July 2017, Bruno returned to Greece and signed a contract with Superleague club PAS Giannina for a duration of 3 years. On 18 September 2017, he scored his first goal for the club in a 1\u22121 home draw game against his former club Panionios. On 14 October 2017, he scored during a 3\u22121 home Superleague win game against Platanias. He finished the season with 3 goals and 4 assists in 31 club appearances in both League and Cup competitions. In June 2018, Chalkiadakis was released from his contract with PAS Giannina on mutual consent. === Hermannstadt === On 5 July 2018, Bruno signed with Romanian club Hermannstadt based in the city of Sibiu, playing in the Liga I, for 2 years for an undisclosed fee. ==International career== Having acquired Greek citizenship, Bruno is eligible to play for the Greek national football team and was actually called up in the U-19 Greek national football team pre-selection for the 2012 Qatar Youth International Tournament along with team-mate Andreas Bouchalakis, before suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury during a post-season Ergotelis friendly, which eventually kept him out of the tournament. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from Cear\u00e1 Category:Ergotelis F.C. players Category:Panionios F.C. players Category:Super League Greece players Category:Greek footballers Category:Greece youth international footballers Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Greek people of Brazilian descent Category:Brazilian people of Greek descent Category:PAS Giannina F.C. players Category:Olympiacos F.C. players Category:Liga I players Category:FC Hermannstadt players Category:Greek expatriate footballers Category:Greek expatriate sportspeople in Romania Category:Expatriate footballers in Romania Category:Association football forwards ",
