    "text": "Pablo Soler Frost (born October 7, 1965) is a Mexican novelist, essayist, translator, playwright, short-story and screen writer. A polyglot (he speaks fluently Spanish, German, English, French and Catalan), he has translated into Spanish several works and poems by Shakespeare, Walpole, Walter Scott, Shelley, John Henry Newman, Joseph Conrad, Robert Frost, Rainer M. Rilke, Theodor Da\u00fcbler and Joanna Walsh. He was awarded the 1987 National Youth Prize granted by Mexican government, and the 2009 Colima Narrative Prize from the National Insititute of Fine Artes (Mexico). He has been a member of the National Artists System of Mexico. His literary contributions to world- renowned artists such as the like of Gabriel Orozco and Anish Kapoor are well known. ==Early life and career== Pablo Soler Frost was born in Mexico City. He is the first son of Mart\u00ed Soler and Elsa Cecilia Frost, both known as translators and scholars. As a child, he was a collector, which might explain the many interests portrayed in his writings from insects and fossils to legends of the silver screen. Very early he was briefly encouraged by Isaac Asimov; other writers with whom he corresponded were Ernst J\u00fcnger and \u00c1lvaro Mutis, but his true mentors were the Mexican writers Salvador Elizondo and Hugo Hiriart. Pablo graduated from The College of Mexico in 1992 with a dissertation on \"The symbol and its political roles in international relations\". In 2007 he was invited by Mexican director Juan Carlos Martin to write the screenplay for a road movie about Americans in Mexico. The resulting Film, 40 d\u00edas (2008) was received with hostility, even though respected Mexican critics such as Rafael Avi\u00f1a and Fernanda Sol\u00f3rzano praised it, as much as John Anderson in Variety. He writes about English, German and Mexican writers and culture in journals like Conspiratio, Ixtus, Letras Libres, L\u00edneas de fuga, Nexos, Revista de la Universidad and La Tempestad, among others. He also collaborates in Mexican newspapers El Universal, Reforma and La Jornada. The same topics he has explored in lectures around Mexico, USA, Argentina, Costa Rica, Japan, Australia, Canada, Norway, Denmark and Great Britain. == List of Works== Novels: *De batallas M\u00e9xico, SEP/Crea, 1984. *Legi\u00f3n (Xalapa, Universidad Veracruzana, 1991 (2\u00aa. edici\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico, Conaculta, 2006; 3\u00aa. edici\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico, Conaculta, 2008; 4\u00aa. edici\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico, Nieve de Chamoy, 2018)). *La mano derecha (M\u00e9xico, Joaqu\u00edn Mortiz, 1993 (2\u00aa. edici\u00f3n, M\u00e9xico, Conaculta, 2008)). *Malebolge (M\u00e9xico, Tusquets, 2001). *Ed\u00e9n (M\u00e9xico, Editorial Jus, 2003). *1767 (M\u00e9xico, Joaqu\u00edn Mortiz, 2004 (2\u00aa. edici\u00f3n, 2005)). *Yerba americana (M\u00e9xico, Era, 2008). *La soldadesca ebria del emperador (M\u00e9xico, Editorial Jus, 2010). *Vampiros aztecas (M\u00e9xico, Taller Ditoria, 2015).
