Locus Online's Lois Tilton called it \"crazy stuff, a lot of fun, and a sharp dissection of Hollywood trends\" but notes \"there is also cruelty here, a heartless milieu run by the shallow and self-absorbed\". Tangent Online's Bob Blough said \"This is a rather lightweight treatment of an interesting concept which made me laugh out loud more than once.\" == References == == External links == *Short story *Rudy Rucker reading \"Good Night, Moon\" Category:2010 short stories Category:Science fiction short stories Category:Works originally published in online magazines Category:Short stories by Bruce Sterling ",
