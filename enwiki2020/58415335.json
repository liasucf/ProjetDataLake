He adopted the name Beaulieu after the Beaulieu estate bought by his grandfather in 1761. Beaulieu had violin lessons with a musician named Alliaume, a student of Isidore Bertheaume (about 1751\u20131802) and from 1803 with Rodolphe Kreutzer. Since 1805 he had composition lessons with Angelo Maria Benincori (1779\u20131821), later with Abb\u00e9 Nicolas Roze. From 1809 he attended the class of \u00c9tienne-Nicolas M\u00e9hul at the Conservatoire de Paris. In 1811, he won the Premier Grand Prix de Rome with the cantata H\u00e9ro et L\u00e9andre after a libretto by Jacques Bins de Saint-Victor. However, he renounced his stay in Rome and settled with his wife Francoise Caroline Rouget de Gourcez in Niort, where her father had been mayor until the French Revolution. Nevertheless, he fulfilled his obligations as a winner of the Prix de Rome and sent several church music pieces to the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts. After the death of his teacher M\u00e9hul, he composed a Requiem in 1819, which was also performed in 1851 in memory of Kreutzer and in 1863 for his own funeral. In 1827, he founded a \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Philharmonique\" in Niort, from which the \"Association musicale de l'Ouest\" was born in collaboration with the violinist and conductor Jules Nor\u00e8s. This was the first symphonic association in the region to organise concerts in Niort, La Rochelle, Angoul\u00e8me, Rochefort, Poitiers and Limoges and to organise an annual musical congress. The society was active until 1879 and led among other things Mendelssohns' oratorios Paulus and Elias, H\u00e4ndels Alexander's Feast, Ludwig Wilhelm Maurers Symphonie concertante and Antonin Reicha's wind quintets. In 1863 Beaulieu founded the Fondation Beaulieu in Paris, which he endowed by will with a capital of 100,000 francs. The foundation had a great influence on musical life in Paris until the First World War. Its chairmen were Ambroise Thomas (bis 1895), Henri Colmet-Daage (1896), Th\u00e9odore Dubois (1897\u20131910) and Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, the musical directors were Adolphe Deloffre (1864\u201373), Guillot de Sainbris (1874\u201387), Jules Danb\u00e9 (1888\u20131905), Georges Marty (1905\u201308) and Gabriel Piern\u00e9. Vocal music was at the centre of Beaulieu's compositional work. In addition to operas, cantatas and lyrical scenes, he composed secular and religious choral works as well as songs and romances with different accompaniments and two string quartets. Interested in public life in his city, Beaulieu was a member of the city council of Niort from 1840 until his death in 1863.Extensive curriculum vitae and catalogue of works on the website Musica et Memoria == Works == *Alcyone, Sc\u00e8ne dramatique (text by Antoine- Vincent Arnault), 1808 *C\u00e9phale, Kantate (text by Jean-Baptiste Rousseau), 1808 *Circ\u00e9, Kantate, (text by J.
