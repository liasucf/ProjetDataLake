    "text": "Mission Los Santos \u00c1ngeles de Guevavi () was founded by Jesuit missionary Fathers Kino and Salvatierra in 1691 as La Misi\u00f3n de San Gabriel de Guevavi, a district headquarters in what is now Arizona, near Tumac\u00e1cori. Subsequent missionaries called it San Rafael and San Miguel, resulting in the common historical name of Los Santos \u00c1ngeles de Guevavi. ==History== Father Juan de San Mart\u00edn was assigned as the first resident priest (he left in 1703), with construction of a small chapel in 1701. Guevavi was designated as cabecera (headquarters) that same year. The ruins of the mission church are situated amidst a native Sobaipuri or O'odham (Upper Pima) settlement. Fathers Agust\u00edn de Campos and Luis Xavier Velarde visited occasionally after that. Father Grazhoffer reestablished a second church Guevavi in 1732. In 1751, Father Garrucho contracted the building of a new and larger 15 foot by 50 foot church, the ruins of which still exist today. The mother of Juan Bautista de Anza is buried in front of the altar. By the late 1690s, the Mission consisted of a church, a carpentry shop, and a blacksmith's area. By the 1770s, the settlement had been abandoned. The first Franciscan priest, Father Juan Cris\u00f3stomo Gil de Bernab\u00e9, arrived in 1768 and took up residency at the Mission with about fifty families. The Apaches attacked in 1769 and killed all but two of the few Spanish soldiers guarding the Mission; in 1770 and 1771 the natives continued their attacks and the cabecera was relocated to Tumac\u00e1cori. Mission Los Santos \u00c1ngeles de Guevavi was abandoned for the last time in 1775. ==Archaeology== The convento and church have been excavated by the Arizona Archaeological and Historical SocietyRobinson, William J., 1976 Mission Guevavi: Excavations in the Convento.
