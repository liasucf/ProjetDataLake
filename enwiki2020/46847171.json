Music videos were created for \"Too Ill for the Law\", \"Jesus Piece\", and \"Body Scream\". ==Critical reception== Pat Levy of Consequence of Sound gave the mixtape a grade of B, saying, \"Despite the record's relatively short runtime, so much humor, angst, and pure bohemian attitude are melded together with admirable results.\" Zach Kelly of Pitchfork gave the mixtape a 6.7 out of 10, commenting that \"Lakutis isn't big on coherent content, favoring a sort of stream of consciousness approach to his rhyming.\" On February 26, 2014, Stereogum listed it as the \"Mixtape of the Week\". ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2014 mixtape albums Category:Hip hop albums by American artists ",
