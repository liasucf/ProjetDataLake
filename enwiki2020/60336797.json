    "text": "The \u0141\u00f3d\u017a D\u0105browa is a railway complex in Polish city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, located in the G\u00f3rna district, between the residential and industrial sectors of the D\u0105browa estate, on the part of circular line running between \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Chojny and \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Widzew stations. The complex consists of two parts: a cargo terminal serving the industrial facilities located in the areas of D\u0105browa, Zarzew and Widzew Wsch\u00f3d, and a pass-through commuter station, consisting of a single platform located under the viaducts of D\u0105browski St. The station was planned back in the 1960s because of the construction of towerblock estate to the west of the tracks. The passenger station was meant to be built along with road viaducts, but the work was never finished. An unfinished concourse under the viaduct is the only remnant of that era. The concept of a commuter station was reactivated in 2010 as part of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Commuter Railway project. A new platform was made, along with staircases and elevators for both road viaducts for integration with a bus stop located on them. The new station was opened on 15 December 2013. The station is mostly served by PolRegio regional trains running from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Kaliska station to Cz\u0119stochowa and Opoczno, and \u0141KA trains from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Kaliska to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Widzew station. The station is also served by several PKP Intercity trains from Warsaw to Wroc\u0142aw. The station can be accessed by trams running to a nearby terminus, and buses, both terminating at and passing through the area of the station. == References == Category:Railway stations in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Category:Railway stations opened in 2013 Category:Railway stations served by \u0141\u00f3dzka Kolej Aglomeracyjna ",
