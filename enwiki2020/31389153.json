It was originally named the City School Library. The state of Massachusetts provided $1,200 for the budget and the city provided $2,300. It was set up in the first floor of the Old City Hall, 226 Merrimack St and opened for the first time on February 11, 1845. The library was renamed the City Library of Lowell in 1860. In 1872, the expanding collection was relocated down the street to the Hosford Building at 134 Merrimack St. In 1890\u20131891. The City of Lowell hired local Architect Frederick Stickney to design the new Lowell City Library, also known as Memorial Hall, in honor of the city's men who lost their lives in the American Civil War. The building was in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. The cornerstones of the building, alone with those of City Hall next door, were laid on October 11, 1890 and it took three years to complete the building. The grand opening of Memorial Hall was on June 3, 1893. In 1915 the second floor of the building was destroyed by a fire. The reported loss for the library was $67,627.20 worth of material as well as artifacts and relics. After the building was rebuilt, with Stickney hired to plan the reconstruction, military murals by French artist Paul Philippoteaux were installed on the second floor. In 1981, the library was renamed the Pollard Memorial Library in memory of the late Mayor Samuel S. Pollard. In 2000\u20132002 the building was remodeled for $10 million to modernize the building. Jack Kerouac was a frequent visitor to the library as a teenager. He often skipped classes to read at the library. In February 2015 the library dedicated a spot in the library as the Kerouac Corner in honor of the author. In early January 2018, pipes burst in the reference room of the library, causing extensive damage throughout the building. The alarm system failed to notify city officials, leaving the water pouring over the course of a weekend until it was discovered on Monday. The flood destroyed countless books and records, some of which were sent to archivists to be restored. The library underwent construction to repair the damaged rooms, remaining closed for several weeks until it reopened near the beginning of March. === Past library directors === * Josiah Hubbard 1845\u20131860 * Frederick A.

Cloutier was a vocal supporter of improving safety at the library. In February 2012, Cloutier filed a discrimination complaint for creating a hostile work environment. In March 2013 it was revealed that money was missing from the Friends of the Library account. The inquiry was promoted by the resignation and withdrawal from the State of Massachusetts retirement system of library assistant Donna Deuso. Deuso denied any involvement and accused library officials of harassing her for her friendship with Cloutier. Deuso went on to file a discrimination complaint against the library in November 2013. Cloutier was told to leave the library on October 29, 2013\u2014Cloutier claimed it was termination, the City of Lowell claimed it she was told to leave temporarily for disability reasons. In December 2013, she filed a second discrimination complaint; this one in regards to her alleged termination. In August 2014, The Lowell Sun reported that Cloutier was accusing the City of Lowell for invasion of privacy after the city's private investigator filmed her and her mother at their home. Cloutier eventually brought her claims to federal court. Most of her claims were dismissed by a federal judge, and in March 2018 a jury rejected her remaining claims. alt=1899 Picture of Pollard Memorial Library|thumb| 1899 Picture of Pollard Memorial Library stereoscopic view of Pollard Memorial Library by L.O.
