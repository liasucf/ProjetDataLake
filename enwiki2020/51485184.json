    "text": "Claude E. Welch Jr., State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo (UB) Professor of Political Science and SUNY Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science, was born on 12 June 1939 in Boston, Massachusetts, to Dr. Claude E. Welch, Sr., and Phyllis Paton Welch. The younger Welch \u201chad the values of hard work and respect for others instilled him from an early age.\u201dSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 9 His father worked his way through Harvard Medical School and served as a front-line surgeon in World War II. In his medical career, he became \u201ca fixture at Massachusetts General Hospital for more than 40 years, was an innovative surgeon, a tireless worker, prolific researcher and an advocate of building strong ties with his patients, themes that would come to be synonymous with his\u2026son.\u201dSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 9 Welch had four children with his late wife Nancy, who died in 1979. His son is Chris Welch, and his three daughters are Sarah Welch, Martha Dyer, and the late Elisabeth Ann (Lisa) Welch, who died in an alpine accident in September 2017. The Welch family maintains a camp on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire, where Welch moved in 2020. In 1981, Welch married Jeannette Marie Ludwig (September 29, 1949-July 29, 2018), who was also a professor at UB. Welch and Ludwig divided their time between their homes in Amherst and the Chautauqua Institute. They donated their home to the Chautauqua Foundation and are members of the Eleanor B. Daugherty Society. Welch's scope of interest extends globally. He and Ludwig traveled to more than 25 countries on five continents. They became avid photographers, and their collection of more than 2000 images, complete with detailed descriptions, is preserved in the digital collection of the University at Buffalo Libraries. Based on these images, the library maintains an exhibition titled Wayfarers: Selected Images from the Welch-Ludwig Collection. Welch and Ludwig also created a scholarship for students studying abroad, the Welsh- Ludwig Fund for International Study. ==Education== Welch attended private schools from fifth grade on. He went to Belmont Hill School, Belmont, Massachusetts, where he received academic awards for Biology, French, Latin, and general scholarly excellence. In his senior year, Welch received the Headmaster's Award for Outstanding Student and graduated summa cum laude. Welch was admitted to Harvard College, the undergraduate liberal arts college of Harvard University, graduating magna cum laude. Responding to the political upheaval in Africa where countries were fighting for independence, Welch focused his studies on Africa and human rights. His undergraduate honors thesis examined the impact of international law on South Africa\u2019s administration of South-West Africa (now Namibia) from the end of World War I to 1961. Continuing with postgraduate studies at Oxford University, Welch earned his PhD in 1964. In an interview with UB Honors Today, UB\u2019s honors alumnae magazine, he explained that he did his dissertation research in West Africa, wrote the final draft on location, and mailed it to his committee.SUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 9 His interest in African politics and human rights formed the basis for his career. ==Teaching career== For more than 50 years, Welch taught political science at UB and lived in Amherst, New York, a suburb of Buffalo, New York. 1964, Welch accepted a position in the political science department at the University at Buffalo, the largest and most comprehensive campus within the SUNY system. He rose rapidly in the academic ranks, serving as assistant professor from 1964\u201368, associate professor from 1968\u201372, full professor from 1972\u201389, and as SUNY Distinguished Service Professor until his retirement in 2017. He was selected one of nine faculty members from the SUNY system to serve on the University-wide Advisory Council on Distinguished Service Professorships, 2009\u201312. His international teaching included a semester at the Singapore Institute of Management and part of a summer course at the International Institute of Human Rights, Strasbourg, France. Welch became a mentor and renowned professor and took an active role in graduate as well as undergraduate education. His warm and enthusiastic personality and his intellect created an environment in which students explored the issues of the day, and his involvement in university activities demonstrated his devotion and attention to his students and their regard for him. In 2016 Welch received the President\u2019s Medal at the University at Buffalo, given \u201cin recognition of signal and extraordinary service to UB.\u201d The citation praised his \u201cmajor contributions to the development of, or quality of life within, the University.\u201dSUNY at Buffalo. UB Now. September 7, 2017 Welch's teaching responsibilities included African politics, civil-military relations, human rights, international law, political change, and world civilizations since 1500. He directed independent study and thesis and dissertation guidance. Since 1969, he participated in about 60 dissertation committees, chairing more than 30 of them, and he served as an outside reader for other departments at UB as well as other universities, for example, in Canada and South Africa. In addition, Welch taught at the Global Perspectives Academy and presented special seminars for the University Honors Program: Africa through Novels and Films, International Human Rights, and Women's and Men's Language (with Jeannette Ludwig). Welch took special pride in teaching. In 2015, he told UB Honors Today that his teaching philosophy is \u201cLet each become what they are capable of being. I try to build up a sense that, yes, individuals have made a difference, and you can do so, too. One of the objectives I see in my teaching is empowerment of students through knowledge, but also through a sense that they can be inspired by learning about others.\u201dSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 10 Welch's academic interests focus broadly on political transitions, particularly in developing countries, most notably in Africa. Welch published 14 books that demonstrate his expertise in African politics, civil-military relations, and human rights.

Protecting Human Rights in Africa was also short listed by the African Studies Association for the Herskovits Prize. In 2008, Economic Rights in Canada and the United StatesHoward-Hassmann, Rhonda E. and Welch, Claude E., Jr., eds. (2006). Economic Rights in Canada and the United States. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press (co-authored with Rhoda Howard-Hassmann) was named by the US Human Rights Network, as \u201cone of three \u2018notable contributions\u2019 in the field of human rights scholarship by our membership.\u201dThe US Human Rights Network, a group of 200 NGOs, congratulated Welch and Howard-Hassmann with souvenirs noting that Economic Rights in Canada and United States as \u201cone of three \u2018notable contributions\u2019 in the field of human rights scholarship\u201d in 2008. ==Administrative career== Welch served in numerous administrative positions while maintaining his teaching and research. His first major appointment came in 1967 when, at the age of 28, he became dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education at UB. He served in this position from 1967\u201370. As associate vice president for Academic Affairs in 1976\u201380, Welch worked as the number two person for non-health sciences-related matters. He also served a three-year term as chair of the Political Science Department, 1980\u201383. He was Acting Dean of the Colleges from 1978\u201379; co director of the annual Faculty Development Workshop, l984\u201391; and co director of the Program for Tenured Faculty, 1987\u201389.

He also served UB by chairing Faculty Senate committees on Budget Priorities, Governance, Academic Planning, Public Service, Student Affairs, and Teaching Effectiveness. In addition, Welch chaired the Committee on Public Service, the Nominating Committee, the Committee on Student Affairs, and the Special Committee on Academic Integrity. At the Baldy Center for Law & Social Policy (SUNY Buffalo Law School), he was a member of Advisory Committee, the Gilbert Moore Fellowships Committee, and the Working Groups Committee. Welch chaired the Council on International Studies and World Affairs from 1998\u20132000, has been a member since 1966, and served on the Task Force on International Programs, 1981\u201383. He chaired the President's Review Board on Appointments, Promotions, and Tenure for three years and served three-year terms on two other occasions. From 2009 to 2011, Welch sat on UB's General Education Task Force and was appointed by the provost as a contributor to the new implementation and development of the restructuring of the university's general education requirements. In 2008, UB President John B. Simpson appointed Welch to the Campaign Advisory Group as one of three faculty members on a 15-person team to help improve fundraising efforts. He also served as the president of the Omicron Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa (1971\u201393) and subsequently served on the Elections Committee. ==Editorial and advisory activities== Welch sat on several editorial committees and advised university presses. Since 1993 he has been on the editorial review board of Human Rights Quarterly. From 1980\u201388, he was associate editor for Armed Forces & Society, serving as editor from 1988\u201392 and on their board of editors from 1992 to the present. Welch was subject editor for \u201cArmed Forces and Society\u201d in the International Military and Defense Encyclopedia.Published in 1993 by Pergamon-Brassey\u2019s Welch has served on the editorial board of advisors for several publications, including Buffalo Human Rights Law Review since 1997; advisory board, World History Since 1500 (Dushkin Publishers), 1997\u20132005; editorial advisory board, Encyclopedia Americana, 1992\u201303; and the board of editors, African Studies Review, 1974\u201381.

He was on the academic advisory committee for graduate programs at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 1999\u20132004. ==Impact== In his 50-plus years teaching at UB, Professor Welch impacted both campus life and individual students. About his early years teaching, Welch told UB Honors Today, \u201cI started out really scared teaching. I remember being dressed formally\u2014because that was the way in 1964\u2014and I\u2019d come back with chalk dust on my shoulders from rubbing up against the board. I was sort of backing away.\u201dSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 9 However, he quickly adjusted to the environment of university life and \u201cas he began teaching honors seminars in the late 1980s, he realized he could utilize some of the principles of those smaller classes\u2014such as debate and classroom discussion\u2014and apply them to what had typically been larger, lecture-based classes.\u201dSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 10 Welch continues, \u201cThat\u2019s contemporary learning. That\u2019s how advances occur. It\u2019s not now the image of the lone scholar locked in a garret somewhere. Yes, you can have brilliant thought experiments. You can be like Einstein in the patent office, totally bored and a failure in math in high school. But for the overwhelming bulk of us that are a couple of standard deviations below in terms of intelligence, you\u2019ve got to work collaboratively.\u201dSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 10 Welch's interests took him far beyond the campus and classroom. He believes in living a life of integrity. He told UB Honors Today, \u201cI try to be a role model for how to live. Have a relationship that is stable and loving. Be part of a community and help to make it a better community. Be generous with time and treasure. These are clich\u00e9s, but you have to live them.\u201dSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 9 The article published in UB Honors Today describes the influence Welch had on his students, prompting many of them to pursue graduate degrees in political science. \u201cHalfway around the world, you\u2019ll find former Welch-inspired scholars\u2026 Jori Breslawski (Honors Scholar, Class of 2014) was already an international studies major\u2026but her specialization changed after taking Welch\u2019s Human Rights course. \u2018That was one of the pivotal moments in my life.\u2026 It completely changed how I saw the world. He taught in such a way that you couldn\u2019t ignore what he was talking about. I would leave class crying and wouldn\u2019t be able to get it out of my mind the rest of the day.\u2019\u201dSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 9 Welch's major academic impact came through his analyses of the effectiveness of human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), explored in his 2001 publication, NGOs and Human Rights: Promise and Performance.Welch, Claude E. Jr., ed. (2000). NGOs and Human Rights: Promise and Performance. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press He argued, particularly in his 2001 book Protecting Human Rights in Africa, that NGOs have become central to the promotion and protection of human rights. His recent research involves the effectiveness of human rights NGOs; he demonstrates that in key parts of civil society, NGOs have become central to the promotion and protection of human rights. His last major volume on this topic, tentatively titled Protecting Human Rights Globally: Strategies and Roles of International NGOs, remains unfinished as of this writing. It examines the impact of lesser known international nongovernmental organizations (INGO) such as Anti-Slavery International, the World Council of Churches, a variety of entities concerned with discrimination on the basis of descent (in particular, caste) and the Coalition for the International Criminal Court. These INGOs focus on major on-going human rights issues, notably contemporary slavery, racism, discrimination based on descent, and impunity from prosecution for major human rights abuses. Initial drafts of three chapters had been published in Human Rights Quarterly as of summer 2017. ==Overseas travel, research, and appointments== Given his specialization in comparative politics, Welch carried out much of his research outside the United States. He traveled as well to enhance his teaching, learn about cultures, and satisfy his curiosity. Countries he visited include Brazil, Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Gambia, Ghana, Germany, Great Britain, Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia, Nigeria, Norway, People's Republic of China, Philippines, Russia, Senegal, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Togo, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe. Welch's main geographic interest remained with Africa. One of his early appointments was chairman of the UNESCO Evaluation Commission, Alan Ikoku College of Education in Owerri, Nigeria, in January 1977. Later, Welch sat on the Advisory Committee for the African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies, Banjul, Gambia, from 1993\u20132005 and the Advisory Committee for the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch from 1989\u20132009. He attended seminars organized by the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, held in Burundi, Benin, and Botswana. These seminars focused on improving democratization efforts in Africa, particularly relating to armed forces. ==Scholarly contributions== Welch's 14 books and many published articles address three interdisciplinary areas: Africa, the political roles of armed forces (civil\u2013military relations), and human rights. Among his most important volumes, already mentioned, are Human Rights and Development in Africa, Protecting Human Rights in Africa, and Economic Rights in Canada and the United States. Although the three areas interrelate, Welch's titles can be listed among his three focus areas. In the interest of avoiding duplication, several volumes that overlap are mentioned only in the area most prevalent. ===Books focused partly or wholly on Africa=== Welch's first book, Dream of Unity: Pan-Africanism and Political Unification in West Africa,Welch, Claude E., Jr. 1966. Dream of Unity: Pan-Africanism and Political Unification in West Africa. Ithaca: Cornell University Press (1966) drew from his doctoral dissertation. It documented, through four case studies, the obstacles to greater unity among African countries with divergent colonial backgrounds. Henry L. Bretton from the University of Michigan reviewed the book in 1967, praising Welch for his focus on West Africa instead of the broader emphasis of Africa as a whole that many books of the time were concerned with. \u201cProfessor Welch\u2019s meticulous scholarship, applied to West Africa only, has produced the kind of book required for better understanding of the substance of international relations.\u201dMidwest Journal of Political Science 11(2), May 1967 Welch's Soldier and State in AfricaWelch, Claude E., Jr. 1970. Soldier and State in Africa: A Comparative Analysis of Military Intervention and Political Change. Evanston IL: Northwestern University Press (1970) was one of the first comparative analyses of causes of coup d\u2019\u00e9tat in Africa. It included Welch's framework, followed by original chapters from other specialists. Welch also drew upon his African expertise in Peasants in Africa,Welch, Claude E., Jr. and Smith, Alan K., eds. 1978. Waltham MA: Crossroads Press. The essays were also published as a special issue of African Studies Review 20(3). co-edited with Alan K. Smith. This book inquired whether the concept of \u201cpeasant\u201d would be useful in the sub-Saharan context). Human Rights and Development in AfricaWelch, Claude E., Jr. and Ronald I Melzer, eds. Human Rights and Development in Africa. Albany: State University of New York at Buffalo (1984) co-edited with Ronald Meltzer, examined the emergent \u201cRight to Development.\u201d As mentioned above, it was selected by Choice, as one of the Outstanding Academic Books of 1984. ===Books focused on civil-military relations=== Welch co-wrote Military Role and RuleWelch, Claude E. Jr. and Smith, Arthur K. 1974. Military Role and Rule. North Scituate, MA: Duxbury Press (1974) with Arthur K. Smith. The book developed a general framework of explanation for coups d\u2019\u00e9tat and their consequences. The authors prepared detailed studies of Thailand, Nigeria, Peru, Egypt, and France. In a review published in the Journal of Politics, Mary B. Welfing wrote, \u201cWelch and Smith synthesize the extensive literature on the military in politics.\u201dWelding, Mary B. August 1974. \u201cMilitary Role and Rule: Perspectives on Civil-Military Relations,\u201d by Claude E. Welch, Jr. and Arthur K. Smith. The Journal of Politics Welch returned to similar themes in 1976 in an edited volume, Civilian Control of the Military: Theory and Cases from Developing Countries.Welch, Claude E., Jr., ed. 1976. Albany: State University of New York Press Many of the original essays were presented at a conference Welch organized. He followed this up with his single-authored No Farewell to Arms? Military Disengagement from Politics in Africa and Latin AmericaWelch, Claude E., Jr. 1987. No Farewell to Arms? Military Disengagement from Politics in Africa and Latin America. Boulder, CO: Westview Press (1987). This volume examines problems of ensuring effective returns to the barracks of armed forces following coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in three West African countries (Ghana, Nigeria, and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and three Andean states (Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru). The Journal Armed Forces & Society describes the book as a \u201cwelcome scholarly contribution that enhances our understanding of the intricacies of voluntary military disengagement from politics.\u201dArmed Forces & Society (Sage Journals). July 1, 1989. Book Review: No Farewell to Arms? Military Disengagement from Politics in Africa and Latin America 15(4): 613\u201325 Military ReviewMilitary Review is the professional journal of the U.S. Army and is published by the Army University Press adds, \u201cIn this book, the contributors look at the issue of civilian control of the military from a comparative viewpoint\u2026where the civilian government appears to be in control of the military, looking for some underlying principles which allowed that control to develop.\u2026 The thrust of the book is to tell not why civilian regimes fail, but why some succeed.\u201dArmed Forces & Society (Sage Journals). July 1, 1989. Book Review: No Farewell to Arms? Military Disengagement from Politics in Africa and Latin America 15(4): 613\u201325 In the Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs,Review by David Pion-Berlin Spring 1990. Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs 32(1): 237\u201345, http://www.jestor.org/stable/166132 David Pion-Berlin describes Welsh's \u201ctimely, much-needed comparative study of military withdrawal from power.\u2026 Disengagement, [Welsh] posits, is conditioned by institutional variables such as role perceptions, budgetary allotments, and military missions and deployment, and broader political variables such as levels of domestic conflict, economic trends, and political leadership.\u201d Welch's single-authored Anatomy of RebellionAlbany: State University of New York Press, 1980 (1980) provides a detailed examination and comparison of four large-scale peasant uprisings in Africa and Asia to determine whether they were \u201cfailed revolutions\u201d or large-scale \u201crebellions.\u201d Along the same line, he edited two books of previously published readings, Political Modernization: Readings in Comparative Political ChangeBelmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing, 1967; second edition 1971 (1967; second edition 1971) and Revolution and Political Change (1972), co-edited with Mavis Bunker Taintor.Welch, Claude E., Jr. and Taintor, Mavis Bunker, eds. 1972. Revolution and Political Change. North Scituate, MA: Duxbury Press In 1967, Welch's Modernization: Readings in Comparative Political ChangeWelch, Claude E., Jr. 1967 (Second edition, 1971). Political Modernization: Readings in Comparative Political Change. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing Co emphasized comparative aspects of political modernization. In Developmental Change: An Annotated Bibliography,Spitz, Allan A. 1969. Developmental Change: An Annotated Bibliography. Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky Allan A. Spitz draws three conclusions from Welch's thesis: \u201c(1) modernization is complex and results in a fundamental transformation of society, economy, and polity; (2) modernization is not guaranteed\u2014it is subject to disruption; and (3) it cannot be assumed that the wide-ranging changes will occur peacefully\u201d (p. 141). ===Books focused on human rights=== Welch's best-known work, Protecting Human Rights in Africa, was pioneering and the first comparative analysis of the development and impact of grassroots human rights organizations south of the Sahara. It was selected by Choice as one of the outstanding academic books of 1995 and short listed that year by the African Studies Association for the Herskovits Prize for the best book in African studies. Protecting Human Rights in Africa received outstanding reviews due to its revolutionary nature. Foreign Affairs quoted it as \u201ca wise, nuanced, and copiously referenced study for practitioners and donors as well as academic analysts\u201dForeign Affairs. March/April 1997 and the Journal of Southern African Studies described it as \u201cone of the best books of its kind.\u201dDe Waal, A. 1996. Journal of Southern African Studies, 22(3), 500\u201301 In NGOs and Human Rights: Promise and Performance (2001), Welch commissioned five original chapters to use as case studies to form a framework that compares and contrasts ways in which non- governmental human rights organizations have developed their goals, determined their effectiveness, and adopted and adapted their strategies. The volume addresses how these factors influence NGOs\u2019 effectiveness. Among the organizations examined are Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Commission of Jurists, the Ford Foundation, and development- oriented NGOs. Asian Perspectives on Human RightsBoulder CO: Westview Press, 19 (1990), co-edited with Virginia Leary, combined original case studies of individual Asian countries with a synthesizing introduction. The volume contains original papers presented at conferences that were organized by Welch and Leary. Economic Rights in Canada and the United States examined similarities and contrasts between the two countries in areas such as the right to health care, social welfare and racism, disability rights, and others. This volume was based on original papers commissioned by Professors Hassmann and Welch with funding from various sources. ===Other publications=== In addition to the volumes above, Welch contributed 39 chapters to scholarly books; 41 articles for refereed journals and 27 articles for non-refereed journals; nine encyclopedia entries; six monographs and consultant's reports; 20 unpublished conference presentations; and nine invited and professional addresses. He won 32 research, symposium, and internship grants and six university research grants. In addition, Welch reviewed grant applications for the National Science Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Grawemeyer Foundation, and the United States Institute of Peace. ==Community activities== Through his career, Welch has supported community life in Western New York, becoming a well-known civic figure and supporter of human rights causes.
