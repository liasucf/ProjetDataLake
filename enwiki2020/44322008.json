Just being \"in the know\" enough to play proves to the two staffers that they are true power brokers in D.C. They soon discover, though, that the Zero Game is more than it appears. One of the two ends up dead. The other must recruit on a young Senate page named Viv to help keep him alive and finish the Zero Game to its shocking conclusion. ==References== == External links == * http://bradmeltzer.com/book/the-zero- game/ Category:2004 American novels Category:Books by Brad Meltzer ",
