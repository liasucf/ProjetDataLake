Athlon Sports reported that Mozes was their eighth center in the class as well.

Mandel said,\"...Mozes was one of the nation's best. It's hard to believe he's not worthy of a selection somewhere over the course of seven rounds.\" ===NFL Draft=== Mozes went unselected in the 2007 NFL Draft. He was signed a day after by the Minnesota Vikings. ===National Football League career=== Mozes checked into Gage Hall on July 25, for the start of training camp.
