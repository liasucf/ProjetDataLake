    "text": "Urocampus nanus, also known as the barbed pipefish, is a species of marine fish belonging to the family Syngnathidae. The species can be found inhabiting seagrass beds in sheltered shoreline and estuary habitats along the coasts of southern Japan and Korea. Their diet likely consists of small crustaceans. Reproduction occurs through ovoviviparity in which the males brood eggs for 11\u201316 days before giving live birth. Urocampus nanus is thought to be polyandrous, where multiple females compete over breeding with a single male. == References == == External links == * Urocampus nanus at FishBase Category:Syngnathidae Category:Fish described in 1870 ",
