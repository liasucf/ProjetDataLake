    "text": "When Broken Is Easily Fixed is the debut studio album by Canadian post- hardcore band Silverstein, released in 2003 under the label Victory Records. ==Background and recording== Forming in early 2000, Silverstein released two EPs, Summer's Stellar Gaze (2000) and When the Shadows Beam (2002). On October 22, 2002, it was announced that the band had signed to Victory Records. When Broken Is Easily Fixed was recorded at Mount Fairview and Unity Gain between January and February 2003 with producer Justin Koop. Koop engineered and mixed the album; Koop was assisted by engineer Rob Turri at Mount Fairview. Rainer Tan provided violin, while Shane Told and Richard McWalter supplied additional guitar. Kyle Bishop gave additional vocals to the title track. The album was mastered by Alan Douches at West West Side. ==Release== When Broken Is Easily Fixed was released on May 20, 2003 on Victory. Martin Wittfooth created the artwork. The album was reissued on September 14, 2004 with a DVD and two bonus tracks, \"Friends in Fall River\" and \"Forever and a Day\". The \"Smashed into Pieces\" music video featured the whole band dressed in black pants and white shirts with red ties. However, singer Shane Told is wearing the opposite - a red shirt with a white tie. The video begins by showing a completely white room, with the instruments set up around the room. The song begins playing as the band members walk in, in reverse, pick up their instruments, and start playing the song backwards. In the final minute of the song, oil splashes across the members of the band, but they keep on playing until the entire scene is covered in oil. However, not long later, the oil flies off and they go on to finish the song. When the song finishes playing, they walk out in reverse. The \"Giving Up\" music video follows a depressed man who is remembering times spent with an ex-girlfriend. These scenes are entwined with shots of the band playing, which are mostly shot using fisheye lens. \"Smashed into Pieces\" was re-recorded by the band in 2013 and released on May 20 to commemorate the ten-year anniversary of the album. ==Reception== As of June 2007, the album has sold 179,000 copies. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Personnel per booklet. ; Silverstein *Shane Told \u2013 vocals, additional guitar *Paul Koehler \u2013 drums *Neil Boshart \u2013 lead guitar *Josh Bradford \u2013 rhythm guitar *Billy Hamilton \u2013 bass guitar ; Additional personnel and production *Justin Koop \u2013 producer, engineer, mixing *Rob Turri \u2013 assistant engineer *Alan Douches \u2013 mastering *Rainer Tan \u2013 violin *Richard McWalter \u2013 additional guitar *Kyle Bishop \u2013 additional vocals on \"When Broken Is Easily Fixed\" *Martin Wittfooth \u2013 artwork *Eric Deleporte \u2013 design ==Chart positions== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Charts (2005) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"| U.S. Billboard Heatseekers Albums | style=\"text- align:center;\"| 48 |- |align=\"left\"| U.S. Billboard Independent Albums | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 45 |} == References == ; Footnotes ; Citations ==External links== *When Broken Is Easily Fixed at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed) Category:Silverstein (band) albums Category:2003 debut albums Category:Victory Records albums ",
