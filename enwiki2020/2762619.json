    "text": "\"One Thing\" is a song by Canadian rock band Finger Eleven. It was released in September 2003 as the second single from their self-titled album. ==Release== The band had thought their single \"Stay in Shadow\" would become a popular hit, but strong success fell on \"One Thing\" instead, although the track didn't find wide mainstream attention until several months after its 2003 release. \"One Thing\" reached number 16 in the US and had exposure on TV series such as Smallville, Scrubs, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Third Watch. It was used on WWE's June 25, 2007, edition of RAW during a tribute video featuring Chris Benoit, who had been found dead along with his wife and son at their home shortly before the show started (unbeknownst to WWE, Benoit had murdered his wife and son, then killed himself). ==Music video== The song won the 2004 MuchMusic Video Award for Best Video. The music video features black-and-white footage of the band in a surreal nocturnal environment featuring a beach with a checkered pattern shore. A massive hourglass is seen on the checkered floor as well as band members perched on tall stands and leafless trees. Other imagery includes a crow, a woman standing over thousands of candles along a building floor, a symphony orchestra conductor conducting an empty orchestra, and a musical box with a spinning, lifelike ballerina. The \"One Thing\" video is featured on WWE's Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story and Hard Knocks: The Chris Benoit Story DVDs as an extra. ==Chart performance== This song hit number five on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and stayed there for 26 weeks. The song peaked at number two on the Adult Top 40 chart and found moderate success on the Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at number 23. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2003\u20132004) !Peak position |- |Canada CHR/Pop Top 30 (Radio & Records) |align=\"center\"|28 |- |Canada Rock Top 30 (Radio & Records) |align=\"center\"|14 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (2004) !Position |- |US Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|66 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2003 singles Category:Finger Eleven songs Category:Rock ballads Category:2000s ballads Category:2003 songs Category:Wind-up Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Johnny K Category:Black-and-white music videos ",
