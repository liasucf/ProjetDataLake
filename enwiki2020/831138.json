    "text": "First Growth () status is a classification of wines primarily from the Bordeaux region of France. == History == ===Bordeaux reds=== The need for a classification of the best Bordeaux wines arose from the 1855 Exposition Universelle de Paris. The result was the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, a list of the top ranked wines, named the Grand Crus Class\u00e9s (Great Classified Growths). With several thousand Chateaux producing their wines in Bordeaux, to be classified was to carry a mark of high prestige. Within the Grand Cru Class\u00e9 list, wines were further ranked and placed in one of five divisions. The best of the best wines were assigned the highest rank of Premier Cru; only four wines, Ch\u00e2teau Latour, Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild, Ch\u00e2teau Margaux and Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion were deemed worthy. Of all the 61 great classified wines, all but one came from the M\u00e9doc region. The exception was the premier cru Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, produced in Graves. The 1855 list remained unchanged for over a hundred years until finally Mouton Rothschild was promoted to Premier Cru status in 1973, after decades of relentless lobbying by its powerful owner, Baron Philippe de Rothschild. Of lesser importance, in 1988 the premier cru Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion was changed in appellation from Graves to Pessac-Leognan to represent apparent changes in soil structure caused by the urbanisation of areas surrounding Bordeaux. ===Bordeaux sweet wines=== Also in 1855, 21 of the best sweet wines from Bordeaux were classified as Grand Crus Class\u00e9s in a separate list. In the original classification, nine wines (primarily from the Sauternes and Barsac regions) were classed as Premier Cru, while 11 were assigned the lower (though still prestigious) rank of Deuxi\u00e8me Cru (Second Growth). One wine (Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem) was considered so great it was granted a special Premier Cru Sup\u00e9rieur classification. ===Other classification schemes in Bordeaux=== With the exception of Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion from Graves, the 1855 Classification did not include producers in the regions of Graves, Saint-\u00c9milion and Pomerol. For details on their own classification schemes, see their sections below. ===Other classification schemes in France=== Burgundy maintains its own classification scheme based on specific appellations. Although the terminology used is similar, the classification hierarchy is different and also attaches to the vineyards themselves. The most-highly rated vineyards are graded as Grand Cru, while those at the next level are classified as Premier Cru. ==First Growth wines today== ===Bordeaux reds=== ====Premier Grand Cru==== * Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild M\u00e9doc (Pauillac) * Ch\u00e2teau Margaux M\u00e9doc (Margaux) * Ch\u00e2teau Latour M\u00e9doc (Pauillac) * Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion Graves (Pessac-Leognan) * Ch\u00e2teau Mouton-Rothschild M\u00e9doc (Pauillac) ===Bordeaux sweet wines=== ====Premier Cru Sup\u00e9rieur==== * Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem (Sauternes) ====Premier Cru==== * Ch\u00e2teau La Tour Blanche, Bommes (Sauternes) * Ch\u00e2teau Lafaurie-Peyraguey, Bommes (Sauternes) * Ch\u00e2teau Clos Haut-Peyraguey, Bommes (Sauternes) * Ch\u00e2teau de Rayne-Vigneau, Bommes (Sauternes) * Ch\u00e2teau Suduiraut, Preignac (Sauternes) * Ch\u00e2teau Coutet, Barsac * Ch\u00e2teau Climens, Barsac * Ch\u00e2teau Guiraud, Sauternes * Ch\u00e2teau Rieussec, Fargues (Sauternes) * Ch\u00e2teau Rabaud-Promis, Bommes (Sauternes) * Ch\u00e2teau Sigalas-Rabaud, Bommes (Sauternes) The communes of Bommes, Fargues and Preignac were once separate communes but now fall into the single commune of Sauternes. ==The Graves classification== After the Second World War the omission of wines of Graves from the official classification was having a negative effect on the price and desirability of wines from the region. To improve marketing the region announced in 1953 its own classification of red wines and one white wine, with more white wines added in 1959. Sixteen wines were given special classification. * Ch\u00e2teau Bouscaut (red & white) * Ch\u00e2teau Carbonnieux (red & white) * Ch\u00e2teau Couhins (white) * Ch\u00e2teau Couhins-Lurton (white) * Domaine de Chevalier (red & white) * Ch\u00e2teau de Fieuzal (red) * Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Bailly (red) * Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion (red) * Ch\u00e2teau La Mission Haut-Brion (red) * Ch\u00e2teau La Tour Haut-Brion (red) * Ch\u00e2teau Latour-Martillac (red & white) * Ch\u00e2teau Laville Haut-Brion (white) * Ch\u00e2teau Malartic- Lagravi\u00e8re (red & white) * Ch\u00e2teau Olivier (red & white) * Ch\u00e2teau Pape Cl\u00e9ment (red) * Ch\u00e2teau Smith Haut Lafitte (red) ==The Saint-\u00c9milion classification== Missing from the 1855 list, the Bordeaux region of Saint- \u00c9milion offered its own classification in 1955 to improve market demand and prices. The Classification of Saint-\u00c9milion wine differs from the 1855 list in that it is updated approximately every ten years based on new assessments of quality. For each new release of the classification, wines may be promoted or demoted within the list. A wine may even be removed entirely, while other unclassified wines may be added. In 2006, for example, eleven wines were removed from the list, six new wines added, and two existing wines promoted to a higher division. The Saint-\u00c9milion Classification currently labels 15 wines as First Growths. These Premiers Grands Crus Class\u00e9s, subdivided into two further classes : A (2 wines) and B (13 wines). A further 64 wines are currently classified as Grands Crus Class\u00e9s. ===Premiers Grands Crus Class\u00e9s A=== * Ch\u00e2teau Ausone * Ch\u00e2teau Cheval Blanc * Ch\u00e2teau Ang\u00e9lus * Ch\u00e2teau Pavie ===Premiers Grands Crus Class\u00e9s B=== * Ch\u00e2teau Beaus\u00e9jour (Duffau-Lagarrosse) * Ch\u00e2teau Beau-S\u00e9jour B\u00e9cot * Ch\u00e2teau B\u00e9lair-Monange * Ch\u00e2teau Canon * Ch\u00e2teau Figeac * Clos Fourtet * Ch\u00e2teau La Gaffeli\u00e8re * Ch\u00e2teau Magdelaine * Ch\u00e2teau Pavie-Macquin * Ch\u00e2teau Troplong Mondot * Ch\u00e2teau Trottevieille ==Pomerol== Pomerol has refused to create any sort of classification scheme but it has produced red wines that are among the most expensive in the world, such as Petrus. ==See also== * French wine * Bordeaux wine * Wine labels * Second wine ==References== Category:Bordeaux wine Category:Wine classification Category:Wine terminology ",
