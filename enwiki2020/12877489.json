She started learning the piano at six and performed her first composition, \"Happy December\", aged seven. She obtained a B.A. (Hons) in Creative Arts, majoring in music and drama, at Manchester Metropolitan University. She performed with a local Indie band, Strip, as lead singer and co-writer while also continuing to write and perform solo. Eden relocated to London after college and started working as a singer/pianist in the bars and restaurants of Soho. She married drummer Charlie Price. Eden and Price formed a jazz trio with Dan Boutwood, and this unit worked cruises for Cunard Line and Royal Caribbean International. Subsequently, they worked hotels in Cyprus and the UK.

It was re-released with world-wide distribution via Universal in 2007. The critical success of My Open Eye brought about support slots with Jamie Cullum, Nerina Pallot and the Buena Vista Social Club, and BBC Radio airplay. After tracks from the album were played by Michael Parkinson, her manager obtained support for Eden from the supermarket chains, Waitrose and Tesco. She released her third album, Moving Shadows, an album of covers, in 2007 on the 33 Jazz label. This is a jazz trio album, featuring Charlie and long-term bass collaborator Julie Walkington.
