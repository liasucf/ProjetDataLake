Mutants are offered asylum on the island of Krakoa, ruled under a council formed by Professor X, Magneto and Apocalypse, among others. While several factions deal with their own issues, Moira MacTaggert warns them all about an incoming threat that may doom mutantkind, and probably the whole world. ===Storylines=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width:100%\" |- |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center; | Title ! scope=\"col\"| Cast ! scope=\"col\"| Plot |- |- | X-Men | Full cast list here | The lead title and the primary 'anchor' of the initiative, described as a hub where all characters can freely enter and exit at any time.
