Cardozo. Among the top 100 law schools, only three schools are younger than Cardozo, which graduated its first class in 1979. Cardozo is currently ranked 53rd by U.S. News and World Report ranking of law schools and 22nd in part-time law schools. Its intellectual property program was ranked 12th in the nation, and its dispute resolution program was ranked 6th. The Cardozo faculty is ranked #32 in the nation for scholarly impact.

Students can choose to participate in clinics such as the Tech Startup Clinic, Immigration Justice Clinic, Innocence Project Clinic, Benjamin B. Ferencz Human Rights and Atrocity Prevention Clinic, and the Civil Rights Clinic. The school also created the Innocence Project, run by Cardozo Professor Barry Scheck, which has used DNA profiling to help free innocent prisoners. The project's work has been instrumental in some high-profile cases. In 1999 Cardozo became a member of the Order of the Coif, an honor society for law scholars. Cardozo has seven faculty members who have clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justices, and Cardozo has had two graduates chosen to clerk for the U.S. Supreme Court.

A multimillion-dollar capital improvement plan took place in 2006. The addition of more space at the Brookdale Center also allowed for a larger and significantly enhanced library, new offices and clinic spaces, as well as a new and larger lobby, moot court room, and ground-floor seminar room. In addition, older classrooms were renovated. In fall 2006, the Greenberg Center for Student Life, given in honor of former Dean David Rudenstine, opened.
