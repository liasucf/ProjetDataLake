The New Indian Express wrote, \"The screenplay is neatly crafted, the narration has a smooth flow. The dialogue sparkles with wit, the humour decent...The film delivers much more than what one would have expected and is a pleasant watch\". Sify wrote, \"The storyline and structure is similar to any other Tamil film in the rom com genre. However, what makes it different is its treatment...Murugan-Anand's idea of making a comic entertainer with an important message is laudable\" and described the film as an \"enjoyable ride\". The Hindu wrote, \"The story isn't great but who cares when as many jokes are laugh-out-loud great as they are in Inimey...when there are as many jokes, there are also bound to be discomfiting ones...But in one of the more surprising final acts I\u2019ve seen this year, Inimey quite redeems itself\". Baradwaj Rangan called it a \"not-bad, Bhagyaraj-style comedy\", further writing, \"when we go to these movies, the question isn\u2019t \u201cHow politically correct is it?\u201d but \u201cAre there laughs?\u201d And there are plenty...the film takes too long to get going. But once Cheenu finds himself trapped between his two women \u2013 a classic Bhagyaraj situation \u2013 we experience the gamut from hmmm... okay to hey, not bad to that was actually hilarious\". The Times of India gave the film 3 stars out of 5 and wrote, \"Comedy is still his (Santhanam's) biggest weapon and the actor is in sparkling form in this film, which is structured to his strengths. We get the quintessential Santhanam similes, which hit their mark quite often, though there is a fair share of ridicule disguised as humour\". Bollywoodlife.com wrote, \"Inimey Ippadithaan is a must- watch because at the end, you come out of the theatre feeling good...it's a film this summer that keeps you entertained and is total value for money\". In contrast, Rediff gave 2 stars out of 5 and called it a \"poorly-written, uninspiring romantic comedy\", going on to add, \"The film let down by a poorly- written script and the director's lacklustre execution. The extremely slow pace, the pretentious characters, ordinary background score, songs every 20 minutes, and a screenplay stuck on a single notion, makes director Muruganand's Inimey Ippadithaan one dimensional and monotonous\". ===Box office=== The film opened to \"good\" response on first day.The film grossed (Worldwide) and particularly it grossed in TN alone over its first Week End.The film continued to do well in its week days and collected over in 7 days at the worldwide box office.After the good opening, the film collection fell down and ended with in its end of worldwide collection.The film declared Hit at the box office. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Tamil- language films Category:2015 films Category:Indian films Category:Indian romantic comedy films Category:2015 romantic comedy films Category:2015 directorial debut films Category:2015 comedy films ",
