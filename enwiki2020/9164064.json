Born in Randalstown, County Antrim, he was educated at St Columb's College, Derry. He became a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and was involved in Conradh na Gaeilge, writing articles for the Peasant, Sinn F\u00e9in and An Claidheamh Soluis publications. He worked as a clerk in the Belfast office of the Heysham Steamship Company. In 1913, he was one of the founders of Irish Volunteers in Belfast. He was a founding member of the Socialist Party of Ireland, led by James Connolly and at whose request he joined the staff of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union in Belfast. On Easter Sunday 1916, he mobilised with a hundred Volunteers at Coalisland, County Tyrone; they dispersed when there were no orders from Dublin. He was later arrested by the British authorities who interned him until the General Amnesty of 1917. He was arrested during the German Plot and went on a hunger strike. He was released seventeen days later. A serving member of the Irish Republican Army in 1920-21, he supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and was elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in the 1922 general election as a Labour Party TD for Louth\u2013Meath. He failed to be re-elected when he stood for the Louth constituency in the 1923 and for the Meath in the September 1927 general elections. He remained a prominent figure in Labour, however, and edited The Voice of Labour and The Watchword from 1930-32. In 1941 he became Secretary of the Irish Trades Union Congress, and afterwards of the Congress of Irish Unions.
