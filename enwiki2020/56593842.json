This contains two townhouses: number 4 with the central entrance and two bays to the left, and number 3 with the right two bays and an entrance in the un-colonnaded section to the right (just out of view). William Henry Playfair designed Royal Terrace between 1820 and 1824. Together with the adjoining Carlton and Regent Terraces, the three streets are in a continuous line, cut only by Carlton Terrace Lane giving access to mews, leading around the eastern end of Calton Hill and surrounding Regent Gardens, the largest of the private gardens of the New Town. These streets, with Royal Terrace the grandest, were the showpiece of Playfair's conception for the Eastern New Town, intended to be grander than James Craig's original development.Youngson, A.J. (2001): \"The Companion Guide to Edinburgh and the borders\", Chapter 9 (Calton Hill), Polygon Books, Edinburgh, UK, The streets were named in connection with the visit to Edinburgh in 1822 of George IV. The extension was projected to reach from Calton Hill down towards Leith, although ultimately very little of the northern section was ever built.Report on The New Town Conservation Area by Edinburgh Town Council == Architecture == Royal Terrace is in the form of an extended, 121-bay 'palace front' of classical 3-bay (and one 4-bay) townhouses.Listed building information for 1 and 2 Royal Terrace, Historic Environment Scotland, accessed 10 February 2018 Playfair's original drawings are held by Edinburgh University, including plans for the whole facade as well as individual sections.Edinburgh University William Henry Playfair Architectural Drawings 821-877 The houses are now all category A listed buildings. The design of the townhouses is unlike those in neighbouring streets. Door entrances and windows on the ground floor are arched and surrounded by V-chamfered rusticated stone work. Ten of the houses still have their original fanlights. The upper floors throughout are of polished ashlar stone with basements of droved ashlar. The houses are of two or three storeys with attics to the colonnaded sections.Listed building information for 3 Royal Terrace, Historic Environment Scotland, accessed 24 February 2018Listed building information for 4 Royal Terrace, Historic Environment Scotland, accessed 24 February 2018 The long symmetrical facade alternates between colonnaded and un-colonnaded sections, from east to west, as follows: Panorama of Royal Terrace, Edinburgh, reaching from Carlton Terrace in the east (extreme left), to Greenside Church in the west (extreme right) \u2014 this is probably the longest Georgian terrace in Europe, a straight, continuous structure measuring 360 metres from east to west. ==Construction== 40 Royal Terrace, the first house to be built in 1821, an example of a two-storey townhouse (with basement and attic) in a section without Greek columns Playfair hoped to attract \"fashionable and wealthy people\" to Calton Hill,Youngson, A.J. (1966): \"The Making of Classical Edinburgh\", pp. 155-156, Edinburgh University Press, but almost immediately he encountered competition from new developments to the western end of the New Town, in particular the Moray Estate. Building began in Royal Terrace in 1821, but was not completed until 1859\u201360. This was in contrast to Regent and Carlton Terraces which were completed in the 1830s. ==Length and 'Whisky row'== Royal Terrace is a continuous straight structure of about 360 metres, reputedly the longest Georgian terrace in Europe.Space and grace, The Scotsman, 28 September 2006 It is 30 metres longer than the Royal York Crescent (1791\u20131820) in Clifton, Bristol.Historic England, Images of England The Moray Estate claim a single built-up environment of nearly 600 metres,Michael Carley at al (2015): Edinburgh New Town: A Model CityThe secret garden, The Guardian, 8 July 2017 but unlike Royal Terrace, this is a series of unbroken streets rather than a single entity. Royal Terrace was known in Edinburgh as 'Whisky Row', supposedly because merchants living there had an unobstructed view of their ships coming into Leith Harbour. In fact, some wine merchants did come to live in the terrace, including John Crabbie (1806\u20131891), founder of John Crabbie & Company, responsible for Crabbie's Ginger Wine, who lived in number 22 from 1861 to 1891.Mitchell , Anne (1993), \"The People of Calton Hill\", p. 83, Mercat Press, James Thin, Edinburgh, == Former residents == Entrance to 4 Royal Terrace with original fanlight above the door Garden behind 11 Royal Terrace ===Listed by address=== *1 - John Colquhoun (1805\u20131885) sportsman and sportswriter and Sir Alan John Colquhoun *1 - Lucy Bethia Walford (1845\u20131915) novelist and artist, daughter of John Colquhoun *1 - Frances Mary Colquhoun (1836\u2013) author, daughter of John Colquhoun *3 (or 5?) - William Paterson Paterson (1860\u20131939) theologian and Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland *5 - Robert Kerr Hannay (1867\u20131940) historian *5 - Robert Flint (1838\u20131910) theologian and philosopher *8 - Alexander Ignatius Roche (1861\u20131921) artist, an important figure in the \u201cGlasgow Boys\u201d *15 - Charles Piazzi Smyth (1819\u20131900), Astronomer Royal for Scotland (1846\u20131888) *19 - Rev Robert Boog Watson (1823\u20131910) malacologist and minister of the Free Church of Scotland, and his brother Patrick Heron Watson *19 - Francis Chalmers Crawford (1851\u20131908) FRSE, stockbroker, amateur botanist and ornithologist *20 - Charles Alexander Stevenson (1855\u20131950) lighthouse engineer, uncle of Robert Louis Stevenson *21-22 - Charles Sarol\u00e9a (1870\u20131953) Professor of French and writer on international affairs *22 - George Reid (1841\u20131913) artist *24, 38, 35 - James Cowan (1816\u20131895) Liberal Party politician, son of Alexander Cowan *25 - Alan Stevenson (1807\u20131865) lighthouse engineer, uncle of Robert Louis Stevenson *25 - David Stevenson (1815\u20131886) lighthouse designer, uncle of Robert Louis Stevenson *27 - Sir William Taylour Thomson (1813\u20131883) KCMG CB, military officer and diplomat *28 - John Crabbie (1806-1891) - founder of John Crabbie & Co, Crabbies Green Ginger etc.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1881 *28 - Roderick Ross (1865\u20131943) Chief Constable of Edinburgh City Police (1900\u20131935) *28 - Thomas Hutchison (1866\u20131925) landowner and politician, Lord Provost of Edinburgh from 1921 to 1923 *32 - John Bartholomew (1831\u20131893) cartographer *32 - Thomas Brown (1806\u20131872) architect *33 - Lt Gen Thomas Robert Swinburne (1794\u20131864) and Adam Alexander Dawson (1913\u20132010) film and television author *35 - Alexander Cowan (1775\u20131859) papermaker and philanthropist, father of James Cowan and Charles Cowan - visited by niece Helen Bannerman, who was also born there *37 - Rev Prof William Stevenson (1805\u20131873) and Charles Cowan (1801\u20131889) politician and paper-maker, son of Alexander Cowan *39 - Donald Tovey (1875\u20131940) musicologist, composer, and musician 891 == Present use == The terrace is now in both commercial and residential use.
