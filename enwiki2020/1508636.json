    "text": "Brendan Ryan (born 6 August 1946) is an Irish politician and former member of Seanad \u00c9ireann for the National University of Ireland constituency. He was an independent senator until 1999, when he joined the Labour Party. Born in Athy, County Kildare, Ryan's political interest arises from his involvement in the 1970s and 1980s with the Simon Community, an organisation which works with and for homeless people. He was first elected in 1981 to the 16th Seanad by graduates of the National University of Ireland in 1981, defeating Professor Augustine Martin. His election was welcomed by an editorial in The Irish Times as \"one of the best deeds in a naughty world\". The paper noted that \"the graduates of the National University of Ireland, the privileged as many would see them, the people who have had the inestimable gift of university education, gave their vote to a man who had devoted his life wholeheartedly to the Simon Community - Mr. Brendan Ryan\". He was a member of the Senate from 1981 until his defeat at the 1993 election to the 20th Seanad. He was re- elected to the 1997 to the 21st Seanad, and was a member until he lost his seat in 2007. In 2004, Ryan he stood as a Labour Party candidate in the European Parliament election for the Munster constituency, and in the 2002 general election, he stood in the Cork South-Central constituency. He was unsuccessful on both occasions. Ryan is a lecturer in Chemical Engineering at the Cork Institute of Technology. In 1995 he wrote \"Keeping Us In The Dark\", a book concerning censorship of freedom of information in Ireland. He also writes a weekly column for the Evening Echo newspaper. Ryan is a fluent speaker of the Irish language. In May 2006, he introduced the Genealogy & Heraldry Bill 2006 in Seanad \u00c9ireann which aimed to provide a sound legislative basis for the State's delivery of heraldic services. He lost his seat in the 2007 election to Seanad \u00c9ireann. ==References== Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Independent members of Seanad \u00c9ireann Category:Labour Party (Ireland) senators Category:Members of the 16th Seanad Category:Members of the 17th Seanad Category:Members of the 18th Seanad Category:Members of the 19th Seanad Category:Members of the 21st Seanad Category:Members of the 22nd Seanad Category:People from Athy Category:People from Cork (city) Category:Politicians from County Kildare Category:Politicians from County Cork Category:Members of Seanad \u00c9ireann for the National University of Ireland ",
