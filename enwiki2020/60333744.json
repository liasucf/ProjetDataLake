    "text": "The Hyundai Venue is a five-door subcompact crossover SUV manufactured by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai and derived from the platform of its Accent subcompact car. The Venue is Hyundai's smallest crossover. The Venue debuted at the 2019 New York International Auto Show. The Venue fits below the Hyundai Kona in Hyundai's international lineup and below the Hyundai Creta in India and other markets where the Creta is sold. The Indian-made Venue is internally coded as QXi, while the Korean-made Venue is coded QX1. == Markets == Interior (India model) Rear view (SE; US model) === India (QXi) === The Venue was launched on May 21, 2019, in India and it is available in 5 trim levels; E, S, SX, SX+ and SX(O).Hyundai Venue bookings open officially on May 2, 2019 As of December 2019, bookings had crossed the 100,000 mark. In the Indian market, the Venue occupies the sub-4-meter SUV category, benefitting from the Indian tax benefits for cars shorter than 4 meters. The Venue is powered by a 1.2-litre 4-cylinder naturally aspirated petrol engine that produces 83 hp and 115 Nm of torque, paired with a 5-speed manual transmission, and a 1.0-litre 3-cylinder turbocharged GDI petrol engine that offers 120 hp and 172 Nm of torque. The turbo petrol exclusively gets an option of a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission and a 6-speed manual as well. The 1.4-litre diesel engine which the Venue was originally launched with, was replaced by a 1.5-litre BS6-compliant diesel engine in March 2020. The bigger engine produces 100 hp and 240 Nm of torque, which is 10 hp and 20 Nm more than the 1.4-litre engine's output. The 1.5-litre diesel engine is paired with a 6-speed manual transmission.https://www.autocarindia.com/car-news/hyundai- venue-bs6-to-get-more-features-416212 In July 2020, a 6-speed clutchless manual transmission option was introduced for the 1.0-litre engine. It is marketed as the iMT technology. It functions with an intention sensor on the gear lever, hydraulic actuator and transmission control unit (TCU). The TCU receives a signal from the lever intention sensor, indicating the driver\u2019s intention to change gears, which then sends a signal to engage hydraulic actuator forming hydraulic pressure. The hydraulic pressure is then sent to the concentric slave cylinder (CSC) through the clutch tube. The CSC uses this pressure to control the clutch and pressure plate, thereby engaging and disengaging the clutch. The Indian-made QXi Venue is exported to emerging markets, including Latin American markets, the Middle East, and Africa. === North America === In the North American market, the Venue will be powered by the 1.6-litre Smartstream gasoline inline-four engine producing and of torque. Both a 6-speed manual transmission (available only on base SE trim) and an Intelligent Variable Transmission (IVT) will be available (the latter is standard on the SEL and Denim, optional on the SE), and the Venue will be available exclusively with front-wheel drive (FWD). Trim levels are base SE and up-level SEL. In the United States, the Venue competes with the Nissan Kicks.https://newspress- hyundai.s3.amazonaws.com/documents%2Foriginal%2F36159-2020VenueFeatures41619FINAL.pdf The manual transmission will be discontinued for the 2021 model year due to low sales. Standard features on all Venue trim levels include Forward Collision-Avoidance Assistance with Pedestrian Detection, Lane Keep Assist, Driver Attention Warning, and an 8-inch display infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration. Available options include Blind-Spot Collision Warning, Rear Cross-Traffic Collision Warning, LED lamps, alloy wheels, sunroof, two-tone roof, navigation, Hyundai Blue Link technology, a 6-speaker audio system, and roof side rails. There is also a lifestyle version called the Venue Denim, only available in Denim Blue with a White roof combined with a Denim and light gray leatherette interior. === Australia === Launched in September 2019, Australian bound Venues come in three grades consisting of Go, Active & Elite, and sit below the dimensionally larger Hyundai Kona. A 'Launch Edition' grade based on the Elite is also initially available and limited to 100 units, featuring unique exterior colours and a power sunroof. All are powered by the 1.6L Gamma inline-four petrol engine available with a 6-speed manual transmission or 6-speed automatic transmission depending on the variant. For the Australian market, the Venue acts as an indirect replacement of the 4th generation Hyundai Accent, due to the lack of right-hand-drive fifth-generation Accent production from Korea for the time being. The entry price for the Venue has been kept low in order to maintain future entry-level customers. == Powertrain == {| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" !Model !Transmission !Power !Torque !0-100 km/h (0-62 mph) (Official) |- !colspan=5|Petrol |- |1.0L Kappa II T-GDi |6-speed manual 7-speed DCT | at 6,000 rpm | at 1,500\u20134,000 rpm | |- |1.2L Kappa II MPi |5-speed manual | at 6,000 rpm | at 4,000 rpm | |- |1.4L Gamma MPi |6-speed automatic | at 6,300 rpm | at 4,200 rpm | |- |1.6L Gamma MPi |6-speed manual 6-speed automatic | at 6,300 rpm | at 4,850 rpm | 11.2s (Manual) 11.4s (Automatic) |- |1.6L Smartstream MPi |6-speed manual CVT | at 6,300 rpm | at 4,500 rpm | 11.2s |- !colspan=5|Diesel |- |1.5L U II CRDi |6-speed manual | at 4,000 rpm | at 1,500\u20132,750 rpm | |} == Sales == {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !
