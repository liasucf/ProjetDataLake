Retrieved on July 8, 2010. \"Address: 9 Dongzhimen North Street, Dongcheng District, Beijing, P.R.China.\" The company is currently Asia's largest oil and gas producer and was China's second biggest oil producer in 2006. Traded in Hong Kong and New York, the mainland enterprise announced its plans to issue stock in Shanghai in November 2007,Analysts express optimism about Chinese shares (Xinhuanet.com, with source from Shanghai Daily) and subsequently entered the constituent of SSE 50 Index. == History == PetroChina was established as a joint stock company with limited liabilities under the Company Law of the People's Republic of China (the PRC) on November 5, 1999, as part of the restructuring of CNPC. In the restructuring, CNPC injected into PetroChina most of the assets and liabilities of CNPC relating to its exploration and production, refining and marketing, chemicals and natural gas businesses. Although PetroChina is the most profitable company in Asia, this success may be the result of corporate management, but can also be attributed to the near duopoly on the wholesale and retail business of oil products it shares with Sinopec in China.https://www.platts.com/latest-news/natural- gas/singapore/sinopec-petrochina-persevere-with-shale-gas-as-27259583 Because of Sinopec's link to Sudan through parent company China Petrochemical Corporation, several institutional investors such as Harvard and Yale decided, in 2005, to divest from Sinopec. Sudan divestment efforts have continued to be concentrated on PetroChina since then.Response to Berkshire Hathaway's statement on its holdings in PetroChina Company Limited , Sudan Divestment Task Force, 2007-02-23.

The refinery is an integral part of China's ambitions to import oil from Kazakhstan.PetroChina Activates China's Biggest Refinery \u2013 The China Perspective In February 2011, PetroChina agreed to pay $5.4 billion for a 49% stake in Canada's Duvernay shale assets owned by Encana. It was China's biggest investment in shale gas to date. PetroChina's subsidiary in Canada is named PetroChina Canada and has an office in Calgary. It operates under the direction of Li Zhiming. China signed a deal in 2016 with the Nepal Oil Corporation to sell 30% of the total Nepalese petroleum consumption. China plans to build a pipeline to Nepal's Panchkhal along with a storage depot. In 2017, the shares of PetroChina upped after the rise of natural gas prices for commercial use. In February 2019, as part of the Arrow Energy joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell, the company was granted leases for $10 billion (AUS) towards the Surat project in Queensland, Australia.

PetroChina posted a US$4 billion profit for 2019. ==PetroChina Pipelines== PetroChina Pipelines is a subsidiary (72.26%) of PetroChina that managed the first three pipelines of the project. ===West\u2013East Gas Pipeline I=== ====History==== The construction of the West\u2013East Gas Pipeline started in 2002. The pipeline was put into trial operation on 1 October 2004, and the full commercial supply of natural gas commenced on 1 January 2005. The pipeline is owned and operated by PetroChina West\u2013East Gas Pipeline Company, a subsidiary of PetroChina. Originally, it was agreed that PetroChina would have owned 50% of the pipeline, while Royal Dutch Shell, Gazprom, and ExxonMobil had been slated to hold 15% each, and Sinopec 5%. However, in August 2004, the Board of Directors of PetroChina announced that following good faith discussions with all parties to the Joint Venture Framework Agreement, the parties had not been able to reach an agreement, and the joint venture framework agreement was terminated. ====Technical features==== The long pipeline runs from Lunnan in Xinjiang to Shanghai. The pipeline passes through 66 cities in the 10 provinces in China. Natural gas transported by the pipeline is used for electricity production in the Yangtze River Delta area. There is a plan to replace coal with gas in Shanghai by 2010. The capacity of the pipeline is of natural gas annually. The cost of the pipeline was US$5.7 billion. By the end of 2007, the capacity was planned to be upgraded to . For this purpose, ten new gas compressor stations will be built and eight existing stations are to be upgraded. ====Connections==== The West\u2013East Gas Pipeline is connected to the Shaan-Jing pipeline by three branch pipelines. The long Ji- Ning branch between the Qingshan Distributing Station and the Anping Distributing Station became operational on 30 December 2005. ====Source of supply==== The pipeline is supplied from the Tarim Basin oil and gas fields in Xinjiang province. The Changqing gas area in Shaanxi province is a secondary gas source. In the future, the planned Kazakhstan-China gas pipeline will be connected to the West\u2013East Gas Pipeline. Starting from 15 September 2009, the pipeline is also supplied with coalbed methane from the Qinshui Basin in Shanxi. ===West\u2013East Gas Pipeline II=== Construction of the second West\u2013East Gas Pipeline started on 22 February 2008. The pipeline with a total length of , including of the main line and eight sub-lines, will run from Khorgas in northwestern Xinjiang to Guangzhou in Guangdong. Up to Gansu, it will be parallel and interconnected with the first west\u2013east pipeline. The western part of the pipeline is expected to be commissioned by 2009, and the eastern part by June 2011. The capacity of the second pipeline is of natural gas per year. It is mainly supplied by the Central Asia-China gas pipeline. The pipeline is expected to cost US$20 billion. The project is developed by China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corp. (CNODC), a joint venture of China National Petroleum Corporation and PetroChina. ===West\u2013East Gas Pipeline III=== Construction of the third pipeline started in October 2012 and it is to be completed by 2015. The third pipeline will run from Horgos in western Xinjiang to Fuzhou in Fujian. It will cross Xinjiang, Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces. The total length of the third pipeline is , including trunkline and eight branches. In addition, the project includes three gas storages and a LNG plant. It will have a capacity of of natural gas per year with operating pressure of . The pipeline will be supplied from Central Asia\u2013China gas pipeline's Line C supplemented by supplies from the Tarim basin and coalbed methane in Xinjiang. Compressors for the pipeline are supplied by Rolls-Royce. ==Environmental record== PetroChina is promoting safety, environmental protection and people-orientation as its slogan and is determined to encourage efficiency in utilization of resource as well as effective operation of the Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) management system as a method to reduce emission of pollutants.\"Summary of the 2007 Annual Report\". PetroChina.com.cn, May 5, 2008 ===Chemical spills=== PetroChina had a chemical spill in November, 2005. One of its chemical plants exploded in Jilin, China, resulting in 100 tons of benzene, which is a carcinogen and toxic, pouring into the Songhua River. There was a slick of chemicals that spanned 80 kilometres. Harbin, which is another city along the Songhua River, had to cut the water supply from almost 4 million people, for 5 days. More than 60 people were injured, five died, and one person was missing due to the incident. The spill prompted China's environmental agency to fine the company one million yuan (approximately $125,000, \u00a364,000) for its pollution, which was the maximum fine that can be handed out in China for breaking an environmental law. However, this disaster sparked controversy about this law. People claimed the law was too soft. The spill even crept into Khabarovsk, Russia, where residents stocked up on bottled water. The city tried filtering its water of toxic substances, but officials were still unsure if the water was 100% safe for drinking. The Chinese government said it will take more than one billion dollars to clean up the aftermath. Li Zhaoxing, Chinese Foreign Minister at the time, issued a public apology to Russia due to the incident. In 2014, Petrochina's subsidiary Lanzhou Petrochemical was responsible for ethylene and ammonia leaks, benzene contamination of water supplies, and air pollution in Lanzhou. The city government criticized the company and demanded an apology. === The \"Western Gas to the East\" Pipeline Project === A PetroChina gas station in Xinjiang Another major controversial issue is PetroChina's development in gas reserves in Tarim Basins, Xinjiang. It is argued that such a project might pose a threat to the environment, as the construction of the pipeline might affect the wildlife in the regions where it runs through. However, no known environmental or social impact assessments have been conducted, as the environmental record of Tarim Basins is very poor. === Demonstration at new plant === Approved in 2007, a $5.5 billion petrochemical plant, expected to produce 800,000 tons of ethylene and refine 10 million tons of crude oil a year, is now under construction by PetroChina in Chengdu, provincial capital of Sichuan in Southwestern China. Ethylene is widely used in the production of goods such as packaging and trash liners. Although the project claimed that $565 million of the total investment would be dedicated to environmental protection, residents of Chengdu who believe it might bring pollution to the local area took to the streets on May 3 and 4, 2008, to protest against the project. The whole demonstration was peaceful, and presence of Chinese government intervention was scarce. == Ranking== PetroChina was ranked 30th in 2018 Forbes Global 2000, a list of top listed companies of the world. In 2019, PetroChina was ranked 22nd in Forbes Global 2000. == Corporate bonds == PetroChina, on October 24, 2008 issued a series of medium-term corporate bonds worth 80 billion yuan ($11.7 billion), which was the biggest ever domestic issue by a listed company. == Logo == The logo of PetroChina has represented the company in plenary capacity since 2004. The logo's basic, abecedarian design consists of a rising sun, projected onto a petal-based graphic. The colors utilized in the graphic are red and yellow, auspicious in Chinese culture. Beneath the English-language version of the design is positioned the company's name in an emboldened, black typeset, \"PetroChina\" (). PetroChina's current logo was adopted 26 December 2004. The contour of the logo is defined as a \"petal graphic equally divided by ten in red and yellow colors\", which, according to description, \"are the basic colors of the national flag of the People's Republic of China, and which embody the characteristics of the oil and gas industry.\" The essentially spherical design of the logo, meant to exemplify PetroChina's global development stratagem. The ten equanimous petals are indicative of PetroChina's ten consolidated core businesses. The red substratum is intended to highlight \"an angle of a square shape, not only demonstrating PetroChina's strong fundamentals, but also implicating the company's huge power of cohesion and creativity.\" The general floral connotations of the logo are designed to capture PetroChina's \"social responsibility of creating harmony between energy and environment.\" Finally, the sun ascending over the horizon in the center of the logo epitomizes the prosperous future hoped to lie within the future of PetroChina. == See also == * China Petrochemical Corporation * China National Offshore Oil Corporation == References == === Citations === === Sources === * 2004 Annual Report, pp. 135, 137 * McGregor, Richard.
