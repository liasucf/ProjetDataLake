His father had commenced construction of the city of Karaj in Persian Ir\u0101q, the tribal residence of the Ban\u016b Ijl\u012b, and which, as governor, Ab\u016b Dulaf completed. He was an illustrious man of letters and science, a brilliant poet, a musical composer, a talented vocalist, and an expert on the Bedouin dialect. His generosity was proverbial. He died at Baghd\u0101d in 226 or 225 AH [840\u20132 AD]. Is\u1e25\u0101q al-Nad\u012bm gives the quote from Ab\u016b Dulaf: \"Handwriting is the garden of the sciences.\" ==Life== His full (genealogical) name was Ab\u016b Dulaf al-Q\u0101sim ibn \u012as\u0101 ibn Idr\u012bs ibn Ma\u2019qil ibn \u2018Umayr ibn Sheikh ibn Muawia ibn Khos\u0101i ibn \u2018Abd al-Uzza ibn Dulaf ibn Jushm ibn Kais ibn Sa\u2019ad ibn \u2018Ijl ibn Lujaym ibn Sa\u2019ab ibn \u2018Al\u012b ibn Bakr ibn W\u0101\u2019il ibn Qasit ibn Hinb ibn Afsa ibn Dum\u012b ibn Jadila ibn Asad ibn Rabia ibn Nizar ibn Ma\u2019ad ibn Adn\u0101n al-Ijl\u012b. He was a lord and emir of his people. His grand-uncle, \u2018\u012as\u0101 ibn Ma\u2019qil, who adopted Ab\u016b Muslim al-Khur\u0101s\u0101n\u012b was his grandfather Idr\u012bs's brother. The emir Ab\u016b Na\u1e63r \u2018Al\u012b ibn M\u0101q\u016bla, author of Kit\u0101b al-Ikm\u0101l ('Book of Completion'), was his descendant. Qu\u1e6drub the Grammarian of the Ba\u1e63rah school tutored his sons, as did Qu\u1e6drub's son, al-\u1e24asan. From an early age Ab\u016b Dulaf's poetic talents won him favour with the Abb\u0101sid caliph Harun al-Rashid, who appointed him governor of Jabal. He suppressed raids by nomadic Kurds and Bedouin Arabs against the city of Karaj, and captured the famous qarqur brigand that operated in the area. When H\u0101r\u016bn died in 809 AD and civil war broke out between the caliph's sons, Al-Amin and Al-Ma'm\u016bn, Abu-D\u00fclaf supported al-Amin. However Al-Amin's general Al\u012b ibn \u2018\u012as\u0101 ibn Mahan was killed by the forces of Al-Mam\u016bn led by Tahir ibn \u1e24usayn, and Ab\u016b-Dulaf retreated to Karaj, where he pledged to remain neutral yet refused to swear allegiance to Al-Mam\u016bn while al-Am\u012bn was alive. On al-Amin's death in 813 Al-Ma'm\u016bn forgave him and he was reappointed governor of Jabal. As governor during the successive reigns of al- Ma\u2019m\u016bn, Al-Mu'tasim and the emir Al-W\u0101thiq, he expanded the territory to include Isfahan and Qazvin, and repelled Daylamite attacks. He served in the campaign against Babak Khorramdin in Azerbaijan (836/837), under Khaydhar ibn Kawus al-Afshin. As governor in Damascus he narrowly escaped a plot against him by Al-Afshin, receiving a warning from the q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b Ibn Ab\u012b D\u0101\u2019\u016bd. He then made the pilgrimage to Mecca and died in Baghdad on 839/840. Khallik\u0101n relates an account that speaks to his Shiite and Mutazilite sympathies. When ten shar\u012bf travel from Khur\u0101s\u0101n to visit Ab\u016b Dulaf on his deathbed, he rewards them in return for a written statement of the genealogy of each; \"the son of such a one, etc., the son of Al\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib by F\u0101\u1e6dima the daughter of the Apostle of God,\" and a declaration that read: \"\u2018Apostle of God\u2019, that, in relief of my distress and misery in my native town, Ab\u016b Dulaf al-Ijl\u012b gave two thousand pieces of gold for thy favour and intercession.\u2019\u201d In a further account about a dream of Ab\u016b Dulaf's son's, the son meets his father in some afterlife world called the Barzakh, and his father says: ==Works== Among his books were: * Kit\u0101b al-Baz\u0101t wa\u2019l-\u1e62a\u012bd () \u2018Falcons and Hunting\u2019; * Kit\u0101b al- Nazah () \u2018Purity of Soul\u2019 (Al-Nazh) (or \u2018Amusements\u2019 [Al- Nuzah]; on country estates); * Kit\u0101b al-Sil\u0101\u1e25 () \u2018Weapons\u2019; * Kit\u0101b S\u012basat al-Mul\u016bk () Policies of Princes. *Poetry ==Legacy== Several accounts tell of the lavish beneficence Ab\u016b Dulaf bestowed on poets, who recompensed him in eulogy, or 'qa\u1e63\u012bdah', celebrating his military prowess. Among these poets were: *Al-\u02bfAkawwak. *Ab\u016b Tamm\u0101m al-T\u0101i *Bakr ibn al-Natt\u0101h , His excessive generosity, gullibility and inevitable debt, satirised in stories of his life, have echoes of Shakespeare\u2019s Timon of Athens. One example is expressed in the verse by the Khalidite Ab\u016b Bakr Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Hish\u0101m: :\"Poets are convinced that their hopes in you are safe from misfortune. Alchemy is a false science for ordinary mortals but not for them. You give them bags of money for words on paper.\" Another example is found in the saying spoken by the reluctant mawla, ibn Ab\u012b Fatn S\u0101lih, to his wife who would send him to war: :Do you think that my heart contains the breast of Ab\u016b Dulaf?. His descendants, known as the Dulafids, played a political role in the Jabal region for about fifty years. ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * ==External links== Category:840 deaths Category:9th-century Arabic poets Category:9th-century linguists Category:9th-century musicians Category:9th-century writers Category:9th- century viceregal rulers Category:9th-century military personnel Category:Scholars of the Abbasid Caliphate Category:9th-century Arabs ",
