Nugent won the 39th Ward general runoff election on April 2, 2019, after advancing from the general election on February 26, 2019. ==Positions== Education Alderman Nugent acknowledges the Chicago Public School system's decreasing enrollment, however she believes the problem is larger than the school system itself. What has caused the enrollment's decrease is the poverty, violence, and inequality that the City of Chicago faces. So Nugent believes any \"effective anti-violence strategy must include a long-term commitment to eliminating inequity and paving a pathway to opportunity.\" With a flourishing community, Nugent believes people will be attracted to live, work, and attend school in the City of Chicago. Crime Alderman Nugent understands the interrelation of poverty, violence, and trauma so she believes investment in communities and working with anti-violence groups can and will reduce crime. Nugent also believes trust between police officers and their communities needs to be expanded. Public Safety Additionally, Alderman Nugent acknowledges that safety is a concern of many residents. So in office, Nugent strives to bring more public safety resources to the 39th Ward through collaboration with the Chicago Police Department and Fire Department. This collaboration enables the departments to be well resourced so that the safety of the community is ensured. Growth and Development Alderman Nugent also recognizes that the City of Chicago is in need of revenue and that Chicago residents can ill afford additional taxes. To mend these two issues, Nugent supports a Chicago casino, legalizing and taxing marijuana, sports betting, and video gambling. Additionally, Nugent is open to a real estate transfer tax over (at least) $1 million. Notably, she is opposed to regressive taxes since these taxes hurt those who can least afford it. Instead, Nugent recognizes that tax increment financing (TIFs) can be a great tool for economic development. Before utilizing TIFs, Nugent believes they need to be reformed. Firstly, there needs to be the ability to sunset TIFs earlier than 23 years. Additionally, Nugent holds the balances of the TIF accounts need to be more transparent so there is a greater understanding of how TIF money is spent. Lastly, Nugent seeks ways in which we could transfer excess TIF money into schools and parks so that residential real estate taxes can be lowered. ==Previous Political Experience== Previously, Nugent served as the Director of Executive Engagement for the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). As director, Nugent worked with stakeholders to ensure physicians meet Board Certification standards. Prior to this, Nugent served as the Chief of Staff for the Cook County Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (DHSEM). As chief of staff, Nugent worked with partners across government, business, and non-profit sectors to develop programs to help prepare for and respond to natural and man-made disasters. Additionally, Nugent worked as the Government Affairs Manager for W.W. Grainger where she created outreach campaigns and worked alongside government to facilitate emergency preparedness. Nugent also served as the Vice-Counsel for Political, Press and Public Affairs for the British Consulate. In this position, she served as the conduit between U.S. and UK leaders. ==Education== Samantha Nugent received her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the University of Connecticut and her Juris Doctor from the Loyola University of Chicago School of Law. ==See also== *List of Chicago aldermen since 1923 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1977 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Chicago City Council members Category:Illinois Democrats Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Women city councillors in the United States Category:Women in Illinois politics ",
