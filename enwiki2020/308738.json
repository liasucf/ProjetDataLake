    "text": "Lushnj\u00eb (, in Lushnje's own dialect: Lushnje [\u02c8lu\u0283\u0272e], ) is a city in west- central Albania. It is located in the County of Fier. The total population is 83,659 (2011 census), in a total area of 372.91 km2. ==History== left In January 1920, Lushnje was a provisional capital of Albania and the place of the Congress of Lushnje. Chieftains of Albania assembled in the town and declared Tirana first a provisional and then the definitive capital of Albania. 3 km away from Lushnj\u00eb is the Savra Field. This field is on the Lushnj\u00eb-Fier road. Here the first battle between Principality of Zeta and Ottoman Empire occurred in 1385 (the Battle of Savra). In this battle Balsha II was killed. Along with Fier, Lushnj\u00eb was the main district of the concentration camps during the Communist Regime; some of the camps included the villages of Sav\u00ebr, Gradisht\u00eb, Bedat, Gjaz\u00eb, Rrap\u00ebz, Plug, etc. ===Historic Battles=== *Balsha II *Battle of Savra ==Economy== The city of Lushnje is located in the Myzeqe region that is known as a main provider of agricultural products to the rest of the country and for exports to other European Countries, and home to a national Institute of Agricultural Research. During the Communism Regime, the city had factories for paper, plastic, and food processing factories. Lushnje has many olive trees. Many other business involve brick making and marble and also oil distributors and small oil refinery for gas station in and out of the city for the city. ==Demographics== Like most southern Albanian regions, the people of Lushnje speak a Tosk dialect. The population is mixed Orthodox and Muslim, typical of southern Albanian cities. Data from the 1918 census shows that the population of Lushnje was split almost evenly between Muslims and Christians at the time of independence from the Ottoman Empire., Seiner's 1918 data mapped here: http://www-gewi.uni-graz.at/seiner/density.html The Christians are mostly Orthodox, but there is a Catholic minority, while similarly the Muslims are mostly Sunni with a Bektashi minority. In modern days, like elsewhere in Albania, people in Lushnja tend not to be very religious if religious at all, regardless of whatever religion their ancestors professed. ==Sport== KS Lushnja was originally formed in 1927 and the first football game held in the city of Lushnje was played shortly after. This was a friendly game against FK Tomori Berat and the team consisted of young men from Lushnje. The club was named Kongresi i Lushnj\u00ebs following a proposal from a member of parliament and signatory of the Albanian Declaration of Independence Ferit Vokopola to name the club after the Congress of Lushnje, which was where Vokopola himself was elected secretary. In 1927 a young man named Ali Fuga returned from his studies in Austria and joined the club as a player and the head coach. He returned to Albania from Austria with shirts that would be used by the club, and they had green vertical stripes which were used to symbolise the fields of Myzeqe. Although the club was formed on 21 January 1927 it was not \"officially\" formed until 27 July 1930 shortly after the formation of the Albanian Football Association a month earlier. It was known then as the Kongresi i Lushnj\u00ebs literacy-artistic society. The club's first official jerseys were green, and the first sports chief of the club was Ali Fuga, who had been a key member of the club's pre formation years. In 1945 they changed their name to KS Traktori Lushnja followed by a further name change in 1950 to SK Lushnja. In 1951 it was changed to Puna Lushnja, before they returned to KS Traktori Lushnja in 1958. In 1991 the club was named KF Lushnja. The club's main supporters' group is called the Ultras Delegat\u00ebt. Also Lushnje has their own Volleyball team known as Ekipi i Volejbollit t\u00eb Lushnjes. ==Mayors of Lushnja Municipality== Lushnje Mayor Elections 2011 *Kujtim Haxhiu 1992-1996 *Agim Fuga 1996-2000 *Ylli Myftiu 2000-2003 *Kadri Gega 2003-2007 *Albert Sanxhaku 2007-2011 *Fatos Tushe 2011-2019 ==Notable landmarks== Ardenica Monastery Lushnje * Abdurrahman Roza Haxhiu Stadium * Congress of Lushnj\u00eb Museum * Ardenica Monastery * Toka Jon\u00eb Monument * Muzeu Historik Lushnje ==Geography== Divjake Karavasta National Park Lushnje is in a hot Mediterranean summer type of climate.
