Mrs. Emily Meynell-Ingram at Temple Newsam, organist and choirmaster at St. Chad's Church in Leeds, and deputy organist at Leeds Parish Church. Prior to this he had studied under Dr. Creser, late organist of the Chapel Royal, St. James's. At the age of 18 he had produced at concerts given by himself at Leeds, a quartet for piano and strings, and a trio for piano and strings. In consequence of ill-health he was compelled to seek a warmer climate, and for some years from 1891 resided in Australia, where he devoted himself to composition, with occasional concerts and teaching. ==Musical career== He held various appointments as organist in Melbourne and while in Australia his dramatic work Tegner's Drapa based on the work by Longfellow, for solo-voice, chorus and orchestra, was performed by the Melbourne Liedertafel and the Sydney Philharmonic, and his ballad for male chorus, 'The Battle of the Baltic' by the Royal Metropolitan Liedertafel. While touring in New Zealand he met the soprano Anna Sophie Balmson Steinhauer (1858\u20131949), a widow and celebrated Danish lieder singer whom he married in 1894 and returning to Europe toured Denmark and Germany with her, giving song-recitals. The couple also later made several tours in Australia, South Africa and Scandinavia. The two regularly appeared on the concert platform together when he would accompany his wife in concerts dedicated in part or entirely to his compositions. In February 1900 the soprano Olive Rae gave a recital at the Steinway Hall in which she sang three songs by Mallinson. On 22 November 1901 Steinhauer and Mallinson gave the first of several concerts at the Bechstein Hall to feature a selection of Mallinson's works (including his song cycle 'My Garden') in addition to little heard works from the Scandinavian composers Peter Heise and Fritz Arlberg.Concert by Anna Steinhauer Albert Mallinson at the Bechstein hall (1901) \u2013 Wigmore Hall website He composed over 400 songs.

In 1906 he gave a series of seven recitals at the Bechstein Hall in London, the programmes of which were exclusively devoted to songs of his own composition, sung by his wife and Ada Crossley. From 1898 to 1903 Mallinson held the post of private organist to Viscount Portman. A series of organ recitals given by him, on the beautiful Cavaille-Col organ in Jesus Church, Copenhagen, aroused exceptional interest among musicians in that city. From 1904 he resided at Dresden, where he acted as organist at the English Church. He was an admirable accompanist, and visited London every year to give a series of song-recitals together with his wife, which were among the principal events of the musical season.
