    "text": "Raul Mour\u00e3o' (born 24 August 1967, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) is an artist. His artwork includes the production of drawings, sculptures, videos, texts, installations and performances. == Chronology == === Early years === During his childhood his first contacts with art are through visits to museums with his family and through observing the paintings and drawings that his father does as a hobby. In his adolescence, he developed an interest for cinema, literature, music and sports. In the second half of the 1980s he participated in workshops on cinema theory at the Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Botafogo Cine Club. He also participated in photography courses. His contact with different cultural spheres and his interest in the poetics of the street and the city became fundamental to the development of his work. === the '80s === In 1986 he begins his studies as an undergraduate in journalism at the H\u00e9lio Alonso Faculty and enrolled himself on the \"Creative blocks\" painting course organised by Charles Watson at the School of Visual Arts of Parque Lage (EAV-Parque Lage), Rio de Janeiro. He begins training at the independent production company Multivideo, in Santa Teresa, where he operates cameras and uses an editing suite for the first time. In 1988 he transferred to the Faculty of Architecture and Urbanism at the University of Santa \u00darsula, Rio de Janeiro, where he restarted taking lessons at EAV-Parque Lage. During this period the EAV-Parque Lage was under the direction of the art critic Frederico de Morais. Over the next three years, Mour\u00e3o attended the school participating in courses and producing small exhibitions. During this same period he met and socialised with other students such as Afonso Tostes, Ana Rondon, Augusto Herkernhoff, Cabelo, Cassia Castro, Daniel Feingold, Jos\u00e9 Bechara, Jos\u00e9 Damasceno, Marcelo Rocha, Marcia Thompson and Tatiana Grinberg amongst others. During this period he also became close friends with the artists of the so-called Generation 80 such as Alex Hamburguer, Alexandre Dacosta, Analu Cunha, Andr\u00e9 Costa, Barr\u00e3o, M\u00e1rcia X., Marcus Andr\u00e9, Marcos Chaves, Luiz Zerbini, Ricardo Basbaum, Ricardo Becker, Ricardo Maur\u00edcio and Roberto Tavares amongst others. === The '90s === In 1990 he transferred to study architecture at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). He shared a studio for a short period with Jos\u00e9 Damasceno. During this time the artist did his first three dimensional experiments producing sculptures and objects such as Cream cracker and Ovo-viol\u00e3o. In a partnership with Damasceno they created the fictitious artist Cafew. In 1991 he participated in the 15th Rio de Janeiro Art Salon at EAV-Parque Lage. He presents three drawings using oil on paper and receives second place in the competition where the jury consisted of the art critics Frederico Morais, Ligia Canongia, Marcus de Lontra Costa, Paulo Ven\u00e2ncio Filho and Reynaldo Roels. In the beginning of 1992 he shared a studio with Angelo Venosa, Cassia Castro, Jos\u00e9 Bechara and Luiz Pizarro located in a large house in Gl\u00f3ria neighborhood, Rio de Janeiro. That year he enrolled in the course \"Aspects of modern sensibility\" that the art critic Paulo Venancio Filho offered at the University of Santa \u00darsula. This became an important experience for Mour\u00e3o, especially regarding the reflection on art and on his own work. He met the cinema director Roberto Berliner and initiated a partnership that during the 1990s allowed Mour\u00e3o to do the co-direction and art direction of video pieces (of artists such as Skank, Paralamas do Sucesso, Lob\u00e3o and Pedro Lu\u00eds e a Parede amongst others) and documentaries such as the \"Som da rua\" series and \"A pessoa \u00e9 para o que nasce\". In 1993 he created, with the artist Barr\u00e3o, the scenery for the TV program \"B\u00e1sico Instinto\" about the writer and composer Fausto Fawcett. With Marcos Chaves and the designer S\u00f4nia Barreto he formed 2D, a graphic art company. He participated in the 17th Rio de Janeiro Art Salon at the EAV - Parque Lage where he presented the sculpture \"Sem t\u00edtulo\" that is reminiscent of a penalty situation in the game of football. It was the first work of the artist that created a dialogue with sport of football. In November at the invitation of Everaldo Miranda, he presented \"Humano\", his first individual exhibition at the S\u00e9rgio Porto Cultural Space, Rio de Janeiro. The artist presented works using marble, iron, glass and water. In 1994 he participated in the exhibition \"Preto no Branco e/ou\u2026\" at the EAV - Parque Lage and was united with the artists Amador Perez, Anna Maria Maiolino, Franz Weissmann, Maria do Carmo Secco, Mira Schendel and Manoel Fernandes. Mour\u00e3o presented drawings of oil on paper. In the text published on the exhibition's folder, the art critic Paulo Herkenhoff commented on the work of the artist: \u201cIn this exhibition the work of Raul Mour\u00e3o seems deliberately to propose confusion. The raw material of many layers of pasted oil on paper, contrasts in the game of light/dark in the drawing of the \u2018figure\u2019, in the lines of gesture and outline [\u2026]. If this is a drawing it has a strange corporal opulence. If this is painting it\u2019s remarkable how the will for a drawing is incorporated in the mass of the picture. However, to ask one self if it is a painting or drawing would be here a useless doubt considering the historical process of the expansion of languages. [\u2026] in this work we can also find a disparity of humours. There are visual games both serious and severe. There are others that are ironic. The consequence centres on a vocabulary of strangeness, of primitive forms, of phantoms\u201d. In this same year Mour\u00e3o presented three collections at the Pa\u00e7o Imperial, Rio de Janeiro: \"Novos Noventa\", \"Mat\u00e9ria e Forma\" and \"Escultura Carioca\". In \"Mat\u00e9ria e Forma\" Mour\u00e3o presents the sculpture \"Esporte\" e \"Morte\". The exhibition, in which also participated the artists Ernesto Neto, Jos\u00e9 Bechara and Marcus Andr\u00e9, was curated by the art critic Luiz Camillo Os\u00f3rio. In January 1995 the gallery at the S\u00e9rgio Porto Cultural Centre he presented the video \"7 artistas\", for which he invited the artists Andr\u00e9 Costa, Barr\u00e3o, Carlos Bevilacqua, Eduardo Coimbra, Marcia Thompson, Marcos Chaves and Ricardo Basbaum. Mour\u00e3o hung the other artists using climbing harnesses from the walls of the gallery, filming the action and the exhibition space that they occupied. Making use of humour and irony, the artist produces his first work in video, approaching the universe of art. 7 artistas (7 artists) had a running time of sixty seconds, whilst the director of photography was Paulo Violeta and is edited by Leonardo Domingues. According to Mour\u00e3o \"this work is a type of visual gag, where the artists and their works merge and occupy the same space\". In 1996 he participated in the exhibitions Rio: Panorama, at the Oduvaldo Vianna Filho Cultural Centre; Esculturas no Pa\u00e7o (Sculptures at the Pa\u00e7o) at the Pa\u00e7o Imperial and Amigos do Calouste (Friends of Calouste) at the Centre of Arts Calouste Gulbenkian, all in Rio de Janeiro. For the exhibition Rio: Panorama Mour\u00e3o presented the intervention \"Casa/\u00c1rvore/Rua\" on Flamengo Beach. In November Mour\u00e3o produced his second individual exhibition at the Ismael Nery Gallery at the Calouste Gulbenkian Centre of Arts. He presented four iron sculptures and one digital image. During the exhibition he debated with the artist Marco Veloso, who also wrote a text about Mour\u00e3o entitled \"Um lugar que n\u00e3o existe\": \"Everyday life objects are removed from their contexts, delicately, poetically released into the environment of art, made out of iron and then, aggressively (?) inserted into an artistic language which is almost nonsense. It can be a football goal post, a broom, a drawer or a napkin on a cup. If all of those that produce art are characterised by a style, this mixture of violence (?) and sensibility are Raul\u2019s signature. But there are no rules in art and perhaps Raul doesn\u2019t even have a style.\" In 1997 he was invited by Marcos Chaves to participate in the project \"Interven\u00e7\u00f5es em Vitrine\" (\"Interventions at the Shop Window\"), at the Dantes Bookshop, Rio de Janeiro. In July he published one hundred copies of the book Rua (Street) and did an intervention by the same name in the shop window. At the launch night, the group Farofa Carioca played on the pavement in front of the bookshop. Throughout the course of the year the artists Andr\u00e9 Costa e Tatiana Grinberg also participate in this project. In July, 1999 he presented the sculpture Cartoon at the exhibition Fundi\u00e7\u00e3o em Conserto (Fixing Fundi\u00e7\u00e3o), at Fundi\u00e7\u00e3o Progresso, Rio de Janeiro. For this work the filmmaker Piu Gomes writes the following text: \"It\u2019s a classic scene: from up high a heavy object falls on top of the character that breaks up and sees stars in the air. Cartoon transports the irony of animation movie icons to the art sphere. A body with no head, the wooden suit that ends in a large box, heavy and disproportional. / Are we in presence of a flattening of rational thought, crashed by an emotional blitzkrieg? Or do we accept that real life can be as unpredictable as the world of animation, where things fall over us without previous warning? / Did you see Big Head around? sang the Golden Boys. Stop making sense, sang Talking Heads. Cartoon radicalizes this proposal remaining faithful to the universe where it originated: simply nonsense. Break your head.\" In September, in a partnership with Eduardo Coimbra and Ricardo Basbaum, he founded and coordinated AGORA \u2013 Agency of Artistic Organisms \u2013 that, according to the members was created with the objective of creating new alternatives for making the production and circulation of contemporary art in Rio de Janeiro more dynamic. AGORA produced exhibitions and projects of Brazilian and foreign artists creating a new approach for the presentation, reflections and debates about contemporary art production in Rio de Janeiro. At Fundi\u00e7\u00e3o Progresso he showed the exhibition Sint\u00e9tico (Synthetic), produced by AGORA, where he presented the works 5 pinturas (5 paintings); Sente-se (Sit down); Alco\u00f3latra: Indiv\u00edduo dado ao v\u00edcio do \u00e1lcool (Alcoholic: Individual who is addicted to alcohol); Patas (Paws); Bolas (Balls); MAM; Casa/\u00c1rvore/Rua (Car/Tree/Street); and Barcos/Cabe\u00e7a (Boats/Head). In the exhibition folder there are published extracts from a conversation that took place using telephone answering machine messages between Mour\u00e3o and the artist Laura Lima, who was also present at the exhibition's inauguration. One of the messages, in which Mour\u00e3o quoted an extract from the book Quincas Borba, by Machado de Assis, recalls the universe and thoughts present in his work: \u201cWho ever knows the ground and the underground of life, knows very well that a part of a wall, a bench, a carpet, an umbrella, are rich full of ideas or feelings, when we are also, and that the reflections of the partnership between men and things composes one of the most interesting phenomena of the earth\u201d1. In November he presented an exhibition with Ana Linneman, Fernanda Gomes and Marcos Chaves at the Mercedes Viegas Art Bureau, Rio de Janeiro. He participates in the exhibition A Imagem do Som de Chico Buarque (The Image of the Sound of Chico Buarque) at the Pa\u00e7o Imperial, with the work Surdo-mudo which is inspired by the song \u201cVai passar\u201d, composed by Chico Buarque. The following month he participated in the exhibition Os 90 (The 90) at the Pa\u00e7o Imperial by invitation of the artist Iole de Freitas, who is one of the curators of the exhibition. He presents the installation N\u00e3o realizados (Unrealised) composed of pieces that are part of large scale projects developed by Mour\u00e3o. === The 2000s === In May 2000 Mour\u00e3o, Eduardo Coimbra, Ricardo Basbaum and Helmut Batista founded and coordinated the AGORA/CAPACETE Space, a result of the union of the groups AGORA and CAPACETE entertainment which are located in Lapa neighbourhood, Rio de Janeiro, where the artist also had his studio. The historian Luiza Mello is in charge of coordinating the production. At the inauguration, the group Chelpa Ferro presented the performance A garagem do gabinete de Chico (The garage of the cabinet of Chico). In June, AGORA began to publish a weekly column about contemporary art on the Internet site super11.net. For this column Mour\u00e3o wrote five texts. He participated in the exhibition La Imagen del Sonido de Chico Buarque (The Image of the Sound of Chico Buarque), at the Borges Cultural Centre, Buenos Aires, Argentina. He participated in November in the exhibition A Imagem do Som de Gilberto Gil (The Image of the Sound of Gilberto Gil) at the Pa\u00e7o Imperial, where he also presented for the first time a work from the series Grades (Fences) entitled Prot\u00f3tipo (Prototype). He participated in the creation of Tecnopop, a multimedia design office, with the designers Marcelo Pereira and S\u00f4nia Barreto, the journalist Luis Marcelo Mendes and the entrepreneur Rodrigo Machado. In September 2003 the designer and architect Andr\u00e9 Stolarski integrated the group of partners into the business. In 2001 he was invited by M\u00e1rcia X. and Ricardo Ventura he presented, in May, the work Para montar (To be built) at the exhibition Orl\u00e2ndia in Botafogo, Rio de Janeiro. The research Grades/Rio de Janeiro/2000 (Fences/Rio de Janeiro/2000) was selected for the 6th Program of Scholarships of RioArte by the municipal council of Rio de Janeiro. With the support of the scholarship, Mour\u00e3o developed his research for one whole year (from September 2001 to September 2002) dedicating himself to the documentation of fences in the urban spaces of Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, S\u00e3o Paulo and Vila Velha. Based on this research the artist creates sculptures, installations and a series of photographs that were presented in collective and individual exhibitions. In October he showed the video-performance Artistas (Artists) at the III Biennial of Mercosul in Porto Alegre where he continued the idea and theme developed in 7 artistas (7 artists) Mour\u00e3o invited the artists Lucia Koch, M\u00e1rio Ramiro and Nelson Rosa to participate in a performance for the inauguration event at the St. Peter Psychiatric Hospital. The three of them were hung using climbing equipment on the walls of the exhibition space and stayed this way for one hour whilst the space was open for guests. The next day, positioned in the same places and with the same equipment, were found video monitors showing the documentary footage of each artist, lasting for a total of 58 minutes. Mour\u00e3o also presented the sculpture A grande \u00e1rea (The big area) for an exhibition of urban interventions that takes place at the Sirotski Sobrinho Park. The following month, Mour\u00e3o presented the installation O carro/A grade/O ar (The car/The fence/The air) at the exhibition Panorama de Arte Brasileira (Panorama of Brazilian Art) at MAM-S\u00e3o Paulo. Together with Br\u00edgida Baltar, Eduardo Coimbra, Jo\u00e3o Mod\u00e9 and Ricardo Basbaum he participates in the exhibition Outra Coisa (Another Thing) produced by AGORA at the Museum Vale do Rio Doce, in Vila Velha. In the presentation text of the exhibition the art critic Paulo Sergio Duarte writes: \"The reflexive essence of contemporary art in Brazil managed to manifest itself, with evident plastic incisiveness, in a poetic that is rich and generous in relation to the spectator, without letting go of a necessary complexity to the critical exploration of limits and frontiers. It\u2019s inside this recent tradition that these works are inscribed. The individual richness of each one of these works is evident and a long dissertation would be necessary to show their contributions, however, one common trait should be mentioned: the formal research of these artists dares to break away, without fear, from certain recent ticks in Brazilian art that have impoverished its history\". He participated in the exhibition Imagem em Jogo (Images in Question) at the Venancio Contemporary Cultural Space, Bras\u00edlia; and in Mostra Brasil + 500 (Exhibition Brazil + 500) at the MAM \u2013 Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he presents the sculpture Cartoon. He was invited by the curator Nessia Leonzini to participate in the exhibitions Cole\u00e7\u00f5es I (Collections I), at the LGC Gallery, Rio de Janeiro, and Cole\u00e7\u00f5es II (Collections II) at the Luisa Strina Gallery, S\u00e3o Paulo. In November he participated in the exhibition A Imagem do Som de Antonio Carlos Jobim (The Image of the Sound of Antonio Carlos Jobim) where he presents the work Ela \u00e9 carioca (She is carioca). In March 2002 the exhibition Love's House was conceived by Mour\u00e3o and produced by AGORA. During one week simultaneously with the XXV Biennial of S\u00e3o Paulo each artist occupied a room on the third floor of the hotel Love's House which is next to the offices of AGORA in the neighbourhood of Lapa. In room 303 Mour\u00e3o presented \u00c1rea de queda (Falling area), an installation from the series Grades (Fences), which is composed of three pieces of iron painted white. He produced the video-documentary C\u00e3o/Le\u00e3o (Dog/Lion) that shows a day in the life of a stray dog. According to Mour\u00e3o \u201cthe video is a parody of a reality show that transforms the routine of the stray dog. Previously a despised and abandoned figure the dog became the main character of the film and the centre of attention for the film crew. The anonymous dog became a film star in only 15 minutes\u201d. The video is directed by Mour\u00e3o in partnership with the cinema director Paola Vieira. The camera was operated by Fernando de Oliveira and is edited by Leonardo Domingues. In May he produced the exhibition Portable - 98/02 (Port\u00e1til \u2013 98/02) at the Raquel Arnaud Art Cabinet which is his first individual exhibition in S\u00e3o Paulo. He wrote and published the text \u201cVe\u00edculo rastreado\u201d (\u201cMarked vehicle\u201d) for the exhibition's catalogue. He presents the object A grande \u00e1rea (The big area), the diptych Cart\u00f5es (Cards), the sculptures Surdo-mudo (Deaf-mute) and Banco (Bench). In June he presented the exhibition Carga Viva (Live Load) at the Celma Albuquerque Art Gallery, which is his first individual exhibition in Belo Horizonte. The artist Jos\u00e9 Bechara had an exhibition on show at the same time in the gallery. Mour\u00e3o presents sculptures and serigraphs from the series Grades (Fences), the video-object Artistas/Lucia Koch (Artists/Lucia Koch) and the works Cart\u00f5es (Cards) and Sem bra\u00e7os e sem cabe\u00e7a (No arms and no head). In the exhibitions\u2019 catalogue the art critic Fernando Cocchiarale wrote: \u201cContrary to the logic of the ready- made, the appropriations made by Mour\u00e3o restrict themselves, on the whole, to the sphere of work materials, determined, with frequency, through the analogy with raw materials used in real objects that serve as a reference to the artist\u2019s recreations. [\u2026] He almost never uses objects previously produced. He takes them as references for his work and never as models. However, it does not exist here either, in opposition to the ready-made, any proximity with the increase in importance of artefacts, of mimesis or other forms of representation.\u201d 2003 - In August the artist presents the exhibition Cego S\u00f3 Bengala (Blind only Walking-Stick) at the Maria Antonia Centre at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP). Mour\u00e3o exhibits the photographs drama.doc and sculptures based on the research Grades (Fences). In the exhibition catalogue the art critic Daniela Labra wrote: \u201cIn a provocative parody Mour\u00e3o removes a certain situation from the urban panorama and pastes it onto the physical space reserved for Art. From his particular fascination with fences the artist explores the social issue present in the hysterical importance given to these structures, and principally the absurd anti-aesthetic visual of these constructions, that end up becoming \u2018sub-architectures\u2019 in the name of reinforced safety. The city serves us daily with a banquet of visuals but accustomed to the abhorrent constructions around us, we pass unaffected through the paths congested with dirt and wonder, forgetting that everything seen is a product and consequence of ourselves.\u201d In Rio de Janeiro, Mour\u00e3o participates in the inaugural exhibition at the LURIXS Contemporary Art Gallery and the exhibitions Infantil (Infantile) at Gentil Carioca gallery; Nano Exposi\u00e7\u00e3o (Nano Exhibition) at Arte em Dobro; and Sidaids produced by SESC Rio. In Vila Velha he participates in the exhibition O Sal da Terra (The Salt of the Earth) at the Museum Vale do Rio Doce. In November he presents the exhibition Pequenas Fra\u00e7\u00f5es (Small Fractions), his first individual exhibition produced by LURIXS Contemporary Art Gallery. In this exhibition Mour\u00e3o unites works elaborated from images, signs, symbols and marks of the everyday life of the city and his own life. Caderno de anota\u00e7\u00f5es (Notebook of annotations) for example, is a digital animation twenty minutes long and produced with drawings taken from his personal notebooks. Mour\u00e3o also presented the silk-screen works Maracan\u00e3 enterrado (Buried Maracan\u00e3), EsculturaparaWaly (SculptureforWaly) and Mata-mata (Kill-kill). He also presented two sculptures from the series Boxer and two paintings using car paint and formica on MDF. The art critic Paulo Venancio Filho wrote the presentation text published in the exhibition catalogue. In 2004, invited by the art critic and curator Agnaldo Farias, he presented the installation Entonces from the series Grades (Fences) in the exhibition SP 450 Paris, at the Tomie Othake Institute, S\u00e3o Paulo. In April Mour\u00e3o produced a new presentation of the installation Entonces at the Pa\u00e7o Imperial. About this exhibition the art critic Luiz Camillo Os\u00f3rio wrote: \u201cEntonces, the suggestive title of the exhibition, seems to unfold itself as a question about what we have done to our urban space. We protect ourselves and close ourselves; this is the paradox of a city in panic. [\u2026] Like in other moments of his trajectory as an artist, it is the ambivalence between sign and form that is something determinant in this work. The deconstruction of the sign and the constitution of the form will process themselves in the displacement of the \u2018fences\u2019 to the gallery, in the disturbance of their functioning, in the production of a non-space.\u201d Invited to participate in the second special project of the Museum of Contemporary Art of Niter\u00f3i, the artist presentsed in June the exhibition drama.doc composed of photographs and sculptures. About the work of Mour\u00e3o the art critic Guilherme Bueno wrote: \u201cIf we understand visibility as an affirmative act, what is put into question is in a certain way a historic challenge. For if the fence constituted the Renaissance instrument for glimpsing the cosmic order [the perspective] or, in the case of a modern artist like Mondrian, the purified expression towards the liberation of the subject in the world through the gaze, here the fence seems to make this anxiety return in the opposite direction: it is not anymore the object of crossing towards pure contents, but the effective materiality of what surrounds us.\u201d That year Mour\u00e3o participated in the collective exhibition Casa: Uma Po\u00e9tica do Espa\u00e7o na Arte Brasileira (House: A Poetics of Space in Brazilian Art) curated by Paulo Reis at the Museum Vale do Rio Doce, in Vila Velha. He was also invited to participate in the exhibitions Arte Contempor\u00e2nea: uma Hist\u00f3ria em Aberto (Contemporary Art: an Open-ended History) curated by S\u00f4nia Salzstein at the Warehouse Roque Petroni; and Heterodoxia (Heterodoxy) at the Latin America Memorial, both in S\u00e3o Paulo. In Rio de Janeiro he participated in the exhibitions Novas Aquisi\u00e7\u00f5es 2003 \u2013 Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Gilberto Chateaubriand (New Acquisitions 2003 \u2013 Gilberto Chateaubriand Collection) at MAM-RJ; Urbanidades (Urbanism) at the Odiss\u00e9ia Theatre; and Arquivo Geral (General Archive) organized by six separate galleries from Rio and shown in Jardim Bot\u00e2nico. The exhibition ran concurrently with the XXVI Biennial of S\u00e3o Paulo. He presented a selection of nine works for the Celma Albuquerque Art Gallery at the \u201cLisbon Art\u201d fair in Portugal. Represented by the Rachel Arnaud Arts Cabinet he participated during December in the \u201cArt Projects\u201d section of the \u201cArt Basel Miami Beach\u201d fair where he presents the installation Casa/Trincheiras (House/Trenches) at Collins Park. In September 2005 by invitation of the group Chelpa Ferro, during an exhibition produced by the group, he presented the work Lulaeletr\u00f4nico (ElectronicLula) on the front wall of the Vermelho gallery, S\u00e3o Paulo. In Rio de Janeiro, he took part of the exhibitions Raz\u00e3o e Sensibilidade (Reason and Sensibility) of the project \u201cEncontro com arte 2005\u201d (\u201cMeeting with art 2005\u201d); and Arte Brasileira Hoje (Brazilian Art Today) at MAM-RJ. In November he produces the exhibition Luladepel\u00facia (CuddlyLula) at the Contemporary Arts Centre LURIXS. Based on the image of president Lula, Mour\u00e3o industrially produces one hundred cuddly- toys as well as drawings and graphic works in partnership with Barr\u00e3o, Carlos Vergara, Fabio Cardoso, Lenora de Barros, Luiz Zerbini and Marcos Chaves. The publicity consultant Andr\u00e9 Eppinghaus, artists Andr\u00e9 Sheik, Daniela Lara, Fausto Fawcett, Marcelo Pereira, the art critic Paulo Reis and Piu Gomes wrote texts about his work. The series of works presented in the exhibition, that received an immediate response from the national media, were first conceived of by the artist when the president took up office in January 2003. He participated in the exhibition Espace Urbain X Nature Intrins\u00e8que (Urban Space x Intrinsic Nature) at the Espace Topographie de l\u2019Art in Paris, France. Curated by Evangelina Seiler, the exhibition united works of 14 Brazilian artists including Mour\u00e3o: Br\u00edgida Baltar, Cao Guimar\u00e3es, Eduardo Srur, Fabiana de Barros and Michel Favre, Gabriela Greeb, Jo\u00e3o Mod\u00e9, Lia Chaia, Lia Menna Barreto, Lucia Koch, Marcos Chaves, Maria Carmem Perlingueiro, Rivane and Sergio Neuenschwander. In May 2006 Mour\u00e3o produced the exhibition Luladepel\u00facia e Outras Coisas (CuddlyLula and Other Things) at the Gallery Oeste, S\u00e3o Paulo, where he displayed a new series of characters inspired by the figure of the president. Mour\u00e3o invited twenty artists to do the drawings in partnership with him. He participated in the exhibitions Dwell at ASU Art Museum, Arizona, United States; II International Biennial of Engravings of Cear\u00e1 at the Museum of Contemporary Art/Dragon of the Sea Centre of Art and Culture, in Fortaleza; \u00c9 HOJE na Arte Brasileira Contempor\u00e2nea \u2013 Cole\u00e7\u00e3o Gilberto Chateaubriand (IT\u2019S TODAY in Brazilian Contemporary Art \u2013 Gilberto Chateaubriand Collection) at Santander Cultural, Porto Alegre. In Rio de Janeiro he presented works at the exhibitions Futebol \u00e9 Coisa de 11 (Football is a thing of 11) at the Lago Gallery, in the Museum of the Republic; Universidarte XIV, at Est\u00e1cio de S\u00e1 University; and Arquivo Geral (General Archive), curated by Paulo Venancio Filho, at the H\u00e9lio Oiticica Centre of Arts. == References == * HERKENHOFF, Paulo; FILHO, Paulo Venancio & FARIAS, Agnaldo.
