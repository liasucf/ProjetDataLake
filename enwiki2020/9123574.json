    "text": "Tom K\u00f8hlert (; born 30 April 1947) is a Danish football manager and former player who managed Br\u00f8ndby IF from 1979 to 1985 and several times later as a caretaker. He led the club to its first ever Danish championship in 1985. He has also functioned as a caretaker for the club's first team on two occasions. He currently coaches lower tier club Gilleleje FK. ==Playing career== A Br\u00f8ndby IF club legend, K\u00f8hlert began his career as a player for Akademisk Boldklub (AB) before shortly moving to Glostrup IF 32 and finally to the former Br\u00f8ndbyvester IF. A year later, Br\u00f8ndbyvester merged with Br\u00f8ndby\u00f8ster IF and became Br\u00f8ndby IF, where he made his debut in 1966. He later stated, that he was not an ambitious player, refusing to train three times a week when new Br\u00f8ndby coach John Sinding took over. In 1971, after making 62 appearances for Br\u00f8ndby, K\u00f8hlert retired due to persistent knee injuries. ==Managerial career== K\u00f8hlert was appointed as a youth coach in Br\u00f8ndby by chairman and former teammate, Per Bjerregaard, in 1972. After training different youth teams, he was promoted to first-team head coach in 1979 after having led the team to a fifth place finish the season before, as former head coach J\u00f8rgen Hvidemose had been sacked. He led the club to its first Danish championship in 1985, K\u00f8hlert then left the position, as star players such as Michael Laudrup moved away and increasing media attention had changed his role as head coach. In 1986, K\u00f8hlert took the position as head coach for Roskilde in the second division, a team he coached for more than three years. In 1990, he returned as a youth coach for Br\u00f8ndby. K\u00f8hlert would return to first-team management in 1999, taking over as a caretaker manager after former head coach Ebbe Skovdahl had left for Aberdeen and his replacement, \u00c5ge Hareide, would only start on 1 January 2000. After Hareide proved a mismatch as a Br\u00f8ndby coach, K\u00f8hlert once again took over as caretaker in the spring of 2002, leading the club to its ninth championship. After leaving professional management, he coached the first team of lower tier clubs Vallensb\u00e6k IF, FC Gribskov and Gilleleje FK. ==Honours== Br\u00f8ndby *1st Division / Superliga (2): 1985, 2001\u201302 *2nd Division: 1981 *Carlsberg Grand Prix: 1984 ==References== ==External links== * Br\u00f8ndby IF profile Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:People from Glostrup Municipality Category:Danish footballers Category:Danish football managers Category:Akademisk Boldklub players Category:Br\u00f8ndby IF players Category:Br\u00f8ndby IF managers Category:Association football defenders ",
