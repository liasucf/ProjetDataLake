Highway 107 in Nova Scotia runs through the eastern suburbs of the Halifax Regional Municipality, from the Burnside Industrial Park in Dartmouth to an intersection with Trunk 7 in Musquodoboit Harbour. It is long, and is mostly two lane, controlled access highway. ==Route description== From its current western terminus at the intersection of Akerley Boulevard and Burnside Drive in Burnside, Highway 107 travels northeast to its interchange with Highway 118, then continues southeast on the Forest Hills Extension to an intersection of Main Street in Dartmouth and Trunk 7 in Westphal. The highway then travels east, concurrent with Trunk 7, through the Sunset Acres neighbourhood in Westphal and the community of Cherry Brook for about . Near Preston, Highway 107 and Trunk 7 split, and Highway 107 continues eastward as a controlled access two-lane highway for the remainder of its route. The highway travels past the communities of Preston, Lake Echo, Porters Lake and Head of Chezzetcook before reaching its eastern terminus with Trunk 7 west of Musquodoboit Harbour. ==Future== There are plans in the near future to extend Highway 107 from Akerley Boulevard along the eastern shore of Anderson Lake and from there, either turn east to connect to the Bedford Bypass, or continue north to connect to Duke Street/Glendale Avenue near exit 4C on Highway 102. This extension may also be known as the Burnside Expressway. This extension would allow commuters from Halifax and Burnside heading to Sackville to bypass the Bedford Bypass and Windmill Road and instead go through Burnside and connect directly into Sackville. Construction is in progress. ==Exit list== ==External links== *Lake Echo Webcam on Highway 107 *Highway 107 Extension ==References== Category:Nova Scotia provincial highways Category:Roads in Halifax, Nova Scotia Category:Limited-access roads in Canada ",
