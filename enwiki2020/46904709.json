    "text": "Jean de La Cepp\u00e8de (c. 1550-1623) was a French nobleman, judge, and poet from Aix-en-Provence. La Cepp\u00e8de was a Christian poet and wrote Alexandrine sonnets in Middle French. He is best known for authoring Les Th\u00e9or\u00e8mes sur le Sacr\u00e9 Myst\u00e8re de Nostre R\u00e9demption, a sequence of 515 sonnets, published in two volumes in 1613 and 1622. Taken together, the sonnets are an exegesis on the passion and Resurrection of Jesus Christ and take a heuristic approach. == Early life == Jean de La Cepp\u00e8de was born circa 1550 in Marseille.Jean de La Cepp\u00e8de (1550?-1623), Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France His father was Jean- Baptiste de La Cepp\u00e8de and his mother, Claude de Bompar.Claude Fran\u00e7ois Achard, Dictionnaire de la Provence et du Comt\u00e9-Venaissin: Histoire des hommes illustres de la Provence, J. Mossy, 1786, p. 167 According to Keith Bosley, the La Cepp\u00e8de family was of Spanish heritage and may have been related to Saint Teresa of Avila, who was born a Cepeda. Bosley (1983), page 5. He received a Doctorate in Law. == Career == La Cepp\u00e8de became an Advisor to the Parliament of Aix-en-Provence on October 22, 1578. He advised Perrinet de Rouillas. He became the President of the Court of Audit in 1583, replacing Hughes de Bompar de Magnan. He became its First President on July 14, 1608, replacing Jean de Rollands de R\u00e9auville and, as the President of a Parliament Court, La Cepp\u00e8de was enrolled in the ranks of the Nobles of the Robe. Despite his devoutly Roman Catholic Faith, La Cepp\u00e8de supported the claim of the Calvinist Henri of Navarre to the throne of France during the French Wars of Religion. For this reason, La Cepp\u00e8de was arrested in 1589, after the Parliament of Aix-en-Provence fell to the armies of the militantly anti- Protestant Catholic League. La Cepp\u00e8de attempted to escape disguised as a shoemaker, but was shot and recaptured. La Cepp\u00e8de was later released on the orders of a senior member of the League who held him in esteem. It was only in 1596 that Marseilles fell to the armies of the now-Catholic King Henri IV. Bosley (1983), page 5. La Cepp\u00e8de acquired the estate of Aygalades from Melchion de Fallet on March 31, 1599. As a result, he became known as the Seigneur (or \"Lord of the Manor\") of Ayglades. The estate was home to a community of Carmelites, and La Cepp\u00e8de funded the reconstruction of their chapel. ==Literary career== During the French Wars of Religion, La Cepp\u00e8de belonged to a Royalist literary circle which included the son of Nostradamus. During the same period, he began writing the sonnets that appear in the Theorems. Keith Bosley (1983), From the Theorems of Master Jean de La Cepp\u00e8de: LXX Sonnets, page 5. As France was increasingly reunified by the armies of King Henri IV, La Cepp\u00e8de published his first collection of poems, which was an imitation of the Seven Penitential Psalms. According to Keith Bosley, La Cepp\u00e8de's book was one of many peace offerings to the new King by the poets of Provence, where support for the Catholic League had been overwhelming. Bosley (1983), page 5. Accord to a 2012 article about La Cepp\u00e8de by Christopher O. Blum, \"It was in 1594, at the end of the French Wars of Religion, that he published his first work, an Imitation of the Penitential Psalms of David. In a dedicatory epistle that was an extended meditation upon theme of shipwreck, he declared his desire to 'dispose his soul and, with it, poor France' to look to the Cross for safety and to take 'the good David' as guide for 'this perilous navigation.' To paraphrase or imitate the Psalms was a common undertaking in those days. La Cepp\u00e8de\u2019s efforts may be likened to those of some of the best-known poets of the period, including his friend Malherbe (Psalm 146), the Castilian friar Luis de L\u00e9on (Psalm 130), and George Herbert (Psalm 23). The recitation of the seven penitential psalms (Psalms 6, 33, 38, 51, 102, 130, and 143) was then a popular Lenten practice, and La Cepp\u00e8de\u2019s imitations, each accompanied with a lengthy prayer, succeed in expressing the sentiments of a contrite and humble heart. The work also included a number of other poems, including twelve sonnets that he offered in the hope that 'they would give some consolation to Christian souls amidst the numerous evils that they suffer' and as an advanced offering from a more ambitious task upon which he was already laboring, the Theorems upon the Sacred Mystery of Our Redemption.\" A Poet of the Passion of Christ by Christopher O. Blum, Crisis Magazine, April 2, 2012. When it was published in 1613, La Cepp\u00e8de dedicated the first volume of the Theorems to the Queen Mother, Marie de' Medici. He also sent a copy to Saint Francis de Sales, who had been a highly successful Catholic missionary among the French Protestants of the Chablais and who was then the Roman Catholic Bishop of overwhelmingly Calvinist Geneva. In response to La Cepp\u00e8de's frequent comparison of Jesus Christ to figures from Greek and Roman mythology, the Bishop wrote, \"[I am] drawn by that learned piety which so happily makes you transform the Pagan Muses into Christian ones.\" Bosley (1983), page 5. When the second volume of the Theorems appeared in 1622, La Cepp\u00e8de dedicated it to King Louis XIII, in celebration of both the King's recent coming of age and his military victory against an uprising of the Huguenots of Languedoc, which had been led by Henri, Duke of Rohan. Bosley (1983), page 5. Accord to Christopher Blum, \"The Theorems is not only poetry, it is a splendid work of erudition, as each sonnet is provided with a commentary linking it to Scriptural and Patristic sources and, especially, to the Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas. The work bears the mark of the Renaissance: the sonnet, that choice mode of expressing romantic love, is here purged and elevated and put in the service of the epic tale of God\u2019s love for man. As La Cepp\u00e8de put it in his introduction\u2014which can be read in Keith Bosley\u2019s admirable translation of seventy of the sonnets\u2014the harlot Lady Poetry had been unstitched of 'her worldly habits' and shorn of her 'idolatrous, lying and lascivious hair' by the 'two-edged razor of profound meditation on the Passion and death of our Saviour.'\" A Poet of the Passion of Christ by Christopher O. Blum, Crisis Magazine, April 2, 2012. == Personal life == La Cepp\u00e8de married Madeleine de Brancas-Ceyreste, the daughter of Gaspard de Brancas-Forcalquier and Fran\u00e7oise d\u2019Ancezune, and widow of Etienne de Mantin. The wedding took place on April 30, 1585. They had a daughter, Ang\u00e9lique, who married Henri de Simiane, Seigneur (or Lord) of La Coste. He married a second time, to Anne de Faret, the daughter of Accurse de Faret, the Squire of Avignon, on February 11, 1611. == Death== La Cepp\u00e8de died, loaded down with honors, at Avignon in July 1623. Keith Bosley (1983), From the Theorems of Master Jean de La Cepp\u00e8de: LXX Sonnets, page 5. ==Legacy== In the year following Jean de La Cepp\u00e8de's death, Cardinal de Richelieu became King Louis XIII's Minister of State and the practices of Baroque literature were replaced by Neo-Classicism in French poetry. To this day, the French poetry of the Renaissance is often looked down on and Fran\u00e7ois de Malherbe is often praised for breaking its mold. La Cepp\u00e8de's verses were accordingly consigned to oblivion until 1915, when they were unearthed by Henri Bremond and appeared in the first volume of his book Histoire litt\u00e9raire du Sentiment religieux en France. Since then, La Cepp\u00e8de's poetry has experienced a revival. It has appeared in multiple poetry anthologies and several scholarly works have been written about its author. Bosley (1983), pages 3-5. Following his death in 1623, Jean de La Cepp\u00e8de's former estate grew into a village called Les Aygalades,Emile Perrier, Un village proven\u00e7al : les Aygalades, Marseille, 1919 which is now part of the 15th arrondisement of Marseille. In 1689, part of the estate was purchased by the aristocratic de Guillermy family, who built upon it the Bastide de la Guillermy, which is now the oldest building in the city. ==See also== *The Inklings *John of the Cross *Metaphysical poets *Richard Crashaw *Robert Southwell == References == ==External links== *A Poet of the Passion of Christ by Christopher O.
