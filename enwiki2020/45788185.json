The organization was founded in 1999 and is based in Vienna. == History and goals == The association was founded in 1999 with the support of Vienna's AIDS network (AIDS-Stammtisch) and major encouragement by Burgl Helbich-Poschacher from the Austrian AIDS Service of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and from Christian Michelides, then director of the self-help organization Menschen und Aids (Club Plus), thereafter founder and director of Lighthouse Wien. The founders of HIV-mobil were health care specialist Beate Dannoritzer, nurse G\u00fcnter Geyer and social worker Thomas Fr\u00f6hlich. Dannoritzer has chaired the association since its foundation. Its medical director of many years standing is HIV specialist Wolfgang Steflitsch; the care department is headed by Eva Stifter. From 1999 to 2004 the organization was funded solely by Austria's most prestigious charity event, the Life Ball. Since 2005, Life Ball and City of Vienna share the financing of HIV-mobil. In its Guiding Principles the organization calls its primary goal to be an integral home care and medical services organization, borne by respect toward all people taken care of \u2014 \u2033regardless of age, religion, descent, social position or sexual orientation without any moral judgement.\u2033 HIV-mobil has been networking successfully on a national and international basis, is cooperating with all Viennese AIDS clinics, with AIDS help organizations in Austria, such as Lighthouse Wien, as well as with several assisted living organizations in Vienna. Furthermore, the organization has developed guidelines for the treatment of people with HIV and AIDS in home care and has been supporting actively the requests of national health organizations at the XVIII International AIDS Conference that took place in Vienna in 2010. == Accolades == * 2010 Health Award of the City of Vienna == External links == * Website HIV-mobil * Austria Presse Agency, retrieved March 19, 2015 * Falter, retrieved March 19, 2015 Category:HIV/AIDS organizations Category:Charities based in Austria Category:Organisations based in Vienna Category:Nursing organizations Category:Medical and health organisations based in Austria ",
