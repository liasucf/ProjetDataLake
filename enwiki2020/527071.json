In the last action of the Falklands War, Olmeda helped recapture the South Sandwich Islands. ==Background== The second of her class, Olmeda came into service in late 1965 as Oleander. As with its sister ships, Olmeda's early service was routine. However, in 1967, the ship had to be renamed from Oleander to Olmeda to avoid confusion with . ==Operational history== ===1973=== In the Second Cod War, Olmeda supported Royal Navy ships twice. ===1980=== Olmeda joined the Armilla Patrol - the original Iraq/Iran conflict monitoring operation - in November, carrying 2 x Royal Navy Sea King helicopters plus associated aircrew and maintainers, on a five-month deployment. Due to political constraints, the ship was not permitted to pass through the Straits of Hormuz and therefore remained stationed outside the Persian Gulf. ===Falklands War=== Olmeda saw extensive service during the Falklands War, being one of the first ships to head south. Olmeda refuelled numerous ships of the Task Force including HMS Hermes, HMS Invincible, and the SS Uganda. After the Argentine surrender of the Falkland Islands, Olmeda, , and the tug Salvageman sailed to the South Sandwich Islands where Argentina had established a base in South Thule since 1976. Following a demonstration of Yarmouths guns, the ten Argentine military personnel surrendered. Before leaving South Thule, Yarmouth was refueled by Olmeda on 21 June, which may have been the most southerly Underway replenishment in the history of the Royal Navy. ===1991=== Unlike the other two members of the class, Olmeda did not serve in the Persian Gulf during the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, but accompanied in the Eastern Mediterranean, acting as station tanker, refuelling Ark Royal and her task group, and supporting other ships on their way to and from Operation Granby. ==Decommissioning== Olmeda's service came to an end a great deal earlier than Olwen and Olna. In 1993, the ship was decommissioned, and was sold for scrapping to an Indian company. ==References== * O Class Fleet Replenishment Tankers ==External links== * RFA Historical Society : RFA Oleander RFA Olmeda at Portsmouth, March 1994 Category:1964 ships Category:Ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Category:Falklands War naval ships of the United Kingdom Category:Falklands War in South Georgia Category:Ships built on the River Tyne ",
