The 15th edition of Shorts M\u00e9xico (FICMEX) will take place from September 2nd to 9th , 2020. http://shortsmexico.com/convocatoria-2020/ The Festival's founder and director is Jorge Maga\u00f1a and the Director of programming is film curator and producer, Isaac Basulto. == Evolution == Founded by Jorge Maga\u00f1a, the first edition took place in 2006 under the name of Shorts Shorts Film Festival Mexico. It was the adaptation of an Asian format, which continues to take place in the city of Tokyo.
