Since his debut in 1994, he has produced numerous albums and singles on the label Big Dada, achieving commercial success with albums Run Come Save Me\"CD REVIEWS: Tori Amos, Live, Macy Gray and many more\". Chart Attack, September 18, By: Debbie Bento and Kori Golding and Slime & Reason. He has been described as \"one of the most influential artists in British music history.\" His most recent studio album, Bleeds, was released in October 2015. ==Biography== Smith grew up around Stockwell, London, England. His parents were from a small village in Jamaica where his father was a preacher and tailor. He spent much of his early life in poverty and this and his strict Pentecostal upbringing had an influence on his music as can be heard in many of his tracks such as \"Sinny Sin Sins\" and \"Colossal Insight\". Of his early discovery of music he says: Smith made his recorded debut in 1994 as part of IQ Procedure through Suburban Base's short- lived hip hop imprint Bluntly Speaking Vinyl. He debuted as Roots Manuva the same year on Blak Twang's \"Queen's Head\" single, before releasing his own single, \"Next Type of Motion\" the following year through the same label, the Sound of Money. 1996 saw the release of his collaborations with Skitz (\"Where My Mind Is At\"/\"Blessed Be The Manner\") on 23 Skidoo's Ronin label. The release of \"Feva\" on Tony Vegas' Wayward imprint followed in 1997. This was also the year that saw the first releases from Big Dada, a collaboration between Coldcut's Ninja Tune label and hip hop journalist Will Ashon. Releasing for Coldcut's renowned experimental/hip hop label Ninja Tune in 1998, some of his music may be seen as a predecessor of grime. The following year he released his debut album, Brand New Second Hand. A reference to his family's modest lifestyle, the title is a phrase his mother used for presents he got as a youngster that were pre-used. The single \"Witness (1 Hope)\", from his second album Run Come Save Me, with its lyrical flow and heavy shuffling squelch bass (allegedly a result of Smith trying to copy the Doctor Who theme) is a UK rap anthem. He had such an impact on the UK rap scene that The Times said that \"his is the voice of urban Britain, encompassing dub, ragga, funk and hip hop as it sweeps from crumbling street corners to ganja-filled dancehalls, setting gritty narratives against all manner of warped beats.\" Manuva was rewarded for his breakthrough with a MOBO as Best Hip Hop Act that year. The lyrics of his songs have a British edge, with critics highlighting his references to eating cheese on toast and drinking bitter as examples of this. He can be heard on many songs performed with other artists such as Chali 2na (and Ozomatli), Jamie Cullum, DJ Shadow, Mr Scruff, U.N.K.L.E., Fun Lovin' Criminals, Nightmares on Wax, The Cinematic Orchestra, Beth Orton, The Herbaliser, Leftfield, Saian Supa Crew and Coldcut. He also made an appearance on the Gorillaz album, Demon Days, on the track \"All Alone\". Manuva headlined the Lounge on the Farm festival 11 July 2009. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions and certifications ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:13em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:19em;\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\" | Certifications |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:90%;\" | UK Peak chart positions for albums in the United Kingdom: * All except Brand New Second Hand, Alternately Deep and Duppy Writer: * Brand New Second Hand, Alternately Deep and Duppy Writer: ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:90%;\" | FRA ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | IRL ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | NOR |- ! scope=\"row\" | Brand New Second Hand | * Released: 22 March 1999 * Label: Big Dada * Formats: CD, LP | 167 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | * BPI: Silver |- ! scope=\"row\" | Run Come Save Me | * Released: 13 August 2001 * Label: Big Dada * Formats: CD, LP | 33 || 140 || \u2014 || \u2014 | * BPI: Gold |- ! scope=\"row\" | Dub Come Save Me | * Released: 8 July 2002 * Label: Big Dada * Formats: CD, LP, digital download | 75 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | Awfully Deep | * Released: 31 January 2005 * Label: Big Dada * Formats: CD, LP, digital download | 24 || 110 || 30 || 31 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | Alternately Deep | * Released: 13 March 2006 * Label: Big Dada * Formats: CD, LP, digital download | 139 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | Slime & Reason | * Released: 25 August 2008 * Label: Big Dada * Formats: CD, LP, digital download | 22 || 127 || 48 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | Duppy Writer | * Released: 6 September 2010 * Label: Big Dada * Formats: CD, LP, digital download | 109 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 4everevolution | * Released: 3 October 2011 * Label: Big Dada * Formats: CD, LP, digital download | 59 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | Bleeds | * Released: 30 October 2015 * Label: Big Dada * Formats: CD, LP, digital download | 51 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- | colspan=\"15\" style=\"font-size:90%\" | \"\u2014\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. |} ===EPs=== *Next Type of Motion (1995) *Awfully De/EP (24 October 2005) *Banana Skank EP (21 January 2013) * \"Stolen Youth EP\" (6 August 2013) === Live albums === * Live from London (iTunes) (15 August 2008) ===Singles=== * \"Juggle Tings Proper\" (22 February 1999) * \"Motion 5000\" (5 July 1999) * \"Witness (1 Hope)\" (23 July 2001) UK No. 45 * \"Dreamy Days\" (8 October 2001) UK No. 53 * \"Yellow Submarine\" (14 October 2002) * \"Colossal Insight\" (17 January 2005) UK No. 33 * \"Too Cold\" (21 March 2005) UK No. 39 * \"Buff Nuff\" (30 June 2008) * \"Again & Again\" (25 August 2008) \u2013 featured on the EA TRAX soundtrack for the EA Sports videogame Fight Night Round 4 * \"Let the Spirit\" (27 October 2008) * \"Do Nah Bodda Mi\" (29 June 2009) * \"It's On (Banana Klan)\" (28 April 2011) * \"Here We Go Again (feat.
