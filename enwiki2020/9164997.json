    "text": "The River Murray Football League is an Australian rules football competition based in the Murray Bridge region of South Australia, Australia. It is an affiliated member of the South Australian National Football League. == History == The competition was founded in 1931 with the foundation clubs Imperials, Ramblers and Mypolonga.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/146039984?browse=ndp%3Abrowse%2Ftitle%2FM%2Ftitle%2F714%2F1931%2F06%2F12%2Fpage%2F17346407%2Farticle%2F146039984 Traditionally the 2 Murray Bridge clubs, Imperials and Ramblers, have had a fierce rivalry, and both have had their fair share of success over the years. Tailem Bend and Jervois, who are both based in smaller townships, are proud clubs with fine traditions and premiership success to go with it. Mannum and Mypolonga both broke premiership droughts in recent decades, however both clubs have struggled in the last 15 years to convert multiple grand final appearances into premierships. Meningie broke through for their first premiership in the RMFL in 2001, however their form since has fluctuated dependent on their ability to recruit players from the Adelaide region. In 2007 the Jervois Football Club won their fourth consecutive League Premiership when they defeated the Imperial Football Club for the second consecutive year. 2004 to 2007 was a golden era for the Jervois Football Club, but they were unable to win 5 in a row in 2008, with the Rambler Football Club winning their first premiership since 1987 after defeating Mypolonga. Ramblers won their 2nd premiership in 3 years in 2010 with victory over Mannum. In the clash of the Murray Bridge clubs in 2011, Imperials defeated reigning premiers Ramblers in the Grand Final at Meningie Oval. Mail Medalist Tyson Wait led the Blues to victory with a dominant performance in defence. Very little separated the top 5 clubs in season 2012. In the Grand Final at Johnston Park, the fast finishing Ramblers side defied the odds to claim a 5-point victory in a high- scoring game against Minor premiers Mypolonga. The Mannum Football Club broke the recent stranglehold of the 2 Murray Bridge clubs, in 2013, with victory over Imperials in the Grand Final. With retired SANFL stars Jeremy Clayton and Jade Sheedy featuring prominently, the Roos stormed home in the last quarter to collect their first flag since 2003. == Current clubs == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
