    "text": "The Athens Suburban Railway, also known as Proastiakos Athens (), is a commuter rail service that connects the city of Athens with its metropolitan area and other regions beyond Attica, including Corinthia, Boeotia, Euboea and Achaea. The first Proastiakos line, linking central Athens with Athens International Airport, was inaugurated two weeks before the 2004 Olympic Games. Over the years, the network has been successively expanded to Corinth (2005), Piraeus (2007), Kiato (2007), Chalcis (2009) and Aigio (2020). ==Lines and services== The Proastiakos network of Athens consists of five routes: Piraeus\u2013Airport via Athens, Piraeus\u2013Kiato via Athens, Athens\u2013Chalcis via Oinoi, Ano Liosia\u2013Airport via Koropi, and Aigio\u2013Athens/Airport via Kiato. Trains run from 4:30 am to midnight daily, and there are 53 stations in total. ===Main services=== The following table lists the routes and the stations for the Proastiakos network of Athens: {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |+ Proastiakos routes ! Route ! class=\"unsortable\" |Route ! Stations ! Length (km) |- | Line 1 | \u2013\u2013 | 19 | 48.2 |- | Line 2 | \u2013\u2013 | 20 | 123.23 |- | Line 3 | \u2013\u2013 | 19 | 82.8 |- | Line 4 | \u2013\u2013 | 12 | 33.18 |- | Line 5 | \u2013\u2013/ | 21 | 200.3 (Aigio\u2013Airport) |} ==Stations== The suburban railway connects with other rail services at the following stations: * Piraeus: Proastiakos station is located near the southern terminus of Metro Line 1. * Athens: connection with Metro Line 2 and TrainOSE mainline and regional services. * Nerantziotissa: connection with Metro Line 1. * Plakentias: connection with Metro Line 3. * Pallini: shared station with Metro Line 3. * Paiania\u2013Kantza: shared station with Metro Line 3. * Koropi: shared station with Metro Line 3. * Airport: shared station with Metro Line 3. * SKA: connection with TrainOSE mainline and regional services. * Oinoi: connection with TrainOSE mainline and regional services. * Kiato: passengers may transfer to TrainOSE replacement bus services to Diakopto and Patras stations. * Diakopto: northern terminus of the Diakopto\u2013Kalavryta railway. * Aigio: passengers may transfer to TrainOSE replacement bus service to Patras station. ==Future expansion== ===Extension from Kiato to Aigio=== As part of the P.A.Th.E./P. project, the line from Athens Airport is being extended to Patras. In June 2020, Proastiakos services were extended from Kiato to Aigio. ===Lavrio branch line=== A nine-station, 32 km extension of the Proastiakos network from Koropi to Lavrio was announced in 2016, potentially connecting 300,000 more people to the rail network at a cost of \u20ac160 million. The project involves the construction of two new stations at Markopoulo and Lavrio Port, and five intermediate stops at Kalyvia, Keratea, Daskaleio, Thorikos and Kyprianos. ===Loutraki line reopening=== In February 2019, OSE accepted a bid for the \u20ac12 million project to convert the former metre-gauge line between Isthmos and Loutraki to standard gauge, connect it to the Athens Airport\u2013Patras railway and reopen it to passenger traffic by 2021. Mytilineos\u2013Xanthakis was selected as the contractor of the project. Due to an appeal by a rival bidder, the signing of the contract was delayed until 12 June 2019. The project consists of the electrification of the Isthmos\u2013Loutraki line and building two new stops, one at the casino and the other in Loutraki. ===Rafina branch=== A \u20ac40 million branch line from Doukissis Plakentias station to the town of Rafina has also been proposed. ==References== Athens Category:Rail transport in Attica Category:Railway lines in highway medians Category:Transport in Athens ",
