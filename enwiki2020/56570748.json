    "text": "Elizabeth (Liz) Wayne is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and former Postdoc at the Center for Nanotechnology in Drug Delivery at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She was a 2017 TED fellow and is a member of a number of professional societies such as the National Society of Black Physicists. == Early Life == Elizabeth Wayne was raised in Crystal Springs, Mississippi. Her father is a paraplegic Baptist minister and her mother a schoolteacher. She knew from a young age that she wanted to be a physicist after entering a science fair. == Education == Wayne attended Mississippi School for Mathematics and Science in Columbus. Wayne earned an undergraduate degree in Physics at the University of Pennsylvania in 2009. She moved to Cornell University, where she completed a PhD in immune cell-mediated drug delivery. Wayne organised the 2013 Northeast Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics, raising $60,000 for delegates to attend. == Research == Wayne joined the Center for Nanotechnology in Drug Delivery at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2015. Her research focuses on cancer treatment using cells to deliver proteins, genes and drugs. Beginning in Fall 2019, Dr. Elizabeth Wayne joined the faculty of Carnegie Mellon University as an assistant professor of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. Her current research focuses on drug delivery for cancer treatment, specifically the use of macrophages to deliver therapeutic genes to solid tumors. == Awards == Wayne has won many awards and fellowships. At Cornell, she won the Robert Mozia Graduate Distinguished Service Award, the Alice & Constance Cook Award, and the Cornell Women\u2019s Day Leadership Award. She was also awarded: the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Med-into-Grad Fellowship, funds from the NCI Physical Sciences in Oncology Network and the Sage and Provost Diversity Fellowship. == Public engagement == She co-hosts the podcast PhDivas, which discusses academia, culture, and social justice across the STEM/ humanities divide. In 2017 she was awarded a TED fellowship, which identifies her as \"a visionary who collaborates across disciplines in an effort to create positive change around the world\". She delivered a TED talk in April 2017 titled 'We can hack our immune cells to fight cancer', which has had over one million views. She has also represented Cornell University at student congressional summits, national societies and funding panels. == Publications == 1\\.
