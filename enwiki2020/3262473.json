    "text": "Time, Love & Tenderness is the seventh studio album by American recording artist Michael Bolton. The album was released on April 23, 1991 by Columbia Records; it was produced by Walter Afanasieff and Michael Bolton. The album topped the Billboard 200 chart and produced four Top 40 singles: a cover of Percy Sledge's \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, \"Love Is a Wonderful Thing\" reached No. 4, \"Time, Love and Tenderness\" reached No. 7, and \"Missing You Now\" reached No. 12. All four singles reached the Top 40 in the UK as well, as did a fifth single released only in the UK, \"Steel Bars\", which was the result of Bolton's songwriting collaboration with Bob Dylan.Michael Bolton UK chart history, The Official Charts Company.

In one of the album's few positive reviews, AllMusic criticized the album as a clone of its predecessor, Soul Provider, particularly deriding the cover of \"When a Man Loves a Woman\" as the album's \"obligatory R&B; carbon copy\". However, they praised the songwriting of Diane Warren, as well as Bolton's singing and his songwriting on the track \"Steel Bars\". The Chicago Tribune gave it one of its few mixed reviews, saying that Bolton's talent as a vocalist is generally outweighed by the mediocre material, but that \"When a Man Loves a Woman\", \"We're Not Makin' Love Anymore\", \"Missing You Now\", and \"Love Is a Wonderful Thing\" are all strong moments. Los Angeles Times also gave a mixed review, calling the album \"commercial\" and \"glitzy\", but praising it as containing Bolton's strongest material to date. However, Entertainment Weekly thoroughly panned the album, declaring that \"Bolton's singing amounts to gimmicks ... that replicate soul mannerisms without a hint of that music's power for re-creating human feeling.\" They derided the album's R&B; covers as lacking sensitivity and the original cuts as being formulaic. The Rolling Stone Album Guide was also mostly negative, criticizing Bolton's vocals on the album for the same reasons as Entertainment Weekly did. In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a \"dud\" rating, calling it \"a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.\" ==Track listing== ==Credits== * Produced by Walter Afanasieff and Michael Bolton ==Personnel== * Michael Bolton \u2013 lead vocals, horn arrangements (1), backing vocals (2, 4) * Walter Afanasieff \u2013 keyboards (1-10), synthesizers (1-10), Hammond B3 organ (1, 4, 6, 10), synth bass (1-5, 7, 8, 9), drums (1-5, 7-10), percussion (1-5, 7-10), horn arrangements (1) * Louis Biancaniello \u2013 programming (1, 3, 4, 7, 9) * Ren Klyce \u2013 programming (1-4, 7-10) * Gary Cirimelli \u2013 programming (2, 4, 8, 10), backing vocals (4, 6, 9, 10) * John Beasley \u2013 acoustic piano (6) * Michael Landau \u2013 guitar (1-5, 8-10) * Chris Camozzi \u2013 guitar (6, 7) * Michael Thompson \u2013 guitar (6) * Randy Jackson \u2013 bass guitar (6, 10) * Jeff Porcaro \u2013 drums (6) * Gigi Gonaway \u2013 timbales (2) * Dan Higgins \u2013 saxophone (1) * Larry Williams \u2013 saxophone (1) * Marc Russo \u2013 tenor sax solo (1, 9) * Kenny G \u2013 soprano sax solo (3) * Gary Grant \u2013 trumpet (1) * Jerry Hey \u2013 trumpet (1) * Kitty Beethoven \u2013 backing vocals (1, 2, 3, 6, 8-10) * Laura Creamer \u2013 backing vocals (1) * Sandy Griffith \u2013 backing vocals (1-4, 6, 8-10) * Melissa Kary \u2013 backing vocals (1, 4, 6, 8-10) * Jean McClain \u2013 backing vocals (1, 4) * Shaun Murphy \u2013 backing vocals (1, 4) * Claytoven Richardson \u2013 backing vocals (1-4, 6, 8-10) * Tanya Scarlett \u2013 backing vocals (1) * Jeannie Tracy \u2013 backing vocals (1-4, 6, 8-10) * Larry Batiste \u2013 backing vocals (2) * Chris Hawkins \u2013 backing vocals (2) * Joe Turano \u2013 backing vocals (2, 4) * Vicki Randle \u2013 backing vocals (3) * Terry Brock \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Desmond Child \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Joe Lynn Turner \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Myriam Valle \u2013 backing vocals (4) * Patti LaBelle \u2013 lead vocals (7) ;Technical credits * Dana Jon Chappelle \u2013 recording engineer, mixing (track 9) * Michael Christopher \u2013 recording engineer * Michael Gilbert \u2013 assistant mixing engineer (track 9) * Mick Guzauski \u2013 mixing (tracks 1 & 3-9) * Mick Higgins \u2013 assistant engineer * Richard Kerr \u2013 recording engineer * Manny Lacarrubba \u2013 mixing engineer (tracks 1 & 3-8) * Matt Lamonica \u2013 assistant engineer * Vlado Meller \u2013 mastering at Sony Music Studio Operations (New York, NY). * Jim Mitchell \u2013 assistant engineer * Devon Rietveld \u2013 mixing engineer (tracks 1 & 3-8) * Marnie Lehmann Riley \u2013 assistant engineer * Roger Talkov \u2013 recording engineer * Dave Thoener \u2013 mixing (2, 10) ;Other credits * Christopher Austopchuk \u2013 art direction * Nancy Danahy \u2013 design * Kim Downs \u2013 management * Bob Epstein \u2013 legal * David Feinstein \u2013 management * Louis Levin \u2013 direction * Rob Light \u2013 booking * Patrick M.

Not included on an Isley Brothers album until years later, the song was released as a single in 1966 on a 45rpm vinyl record, and it \"bubbled under\" on the Billboard chart, meaning that it peaked between #101 and #125 on the Hot 100. Bolton's song contained similarities to the song by the Isleys that exceeded the title: in 1994, a jury found songwriters Bolton and Goldmark, along with Sony Music Entertainment (the parent company of Bolton's label, Columbia Records), liable for copyright infringement due to multiple similarities between the two songs and ordered them to pay the Isleys all profits earned from the single plus 28% of the album profits, which amounted to over US$5 millions. On May 9, 2000, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, an appellate court covering the western regions of the U.S., affirmed the jury's decision, which is one of the largest monetary sums to be awarded in a case such as this. On January 22, 2001, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to review the decision of the appellate court despite Bolton's claims that he had never heard the Isley Brothers recording (although he was a fan of their music) and that he was exercising his right to \"independent creation\". The decision by the Supreme Court not to hear the case resulted in the original verdict remaining valid. ==Chart positions== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1991) !Peak position |- |US Billboard 200 |align=\"center\"|1 |- |Australian ARIA Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|1 |- |Finnish Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|3 |- |UK Albums ChartEveryHit.com |align=\"center\"|2 |- |} ===Decade charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1990\u20131999) !Position |- | US Billboard 200 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|36 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:Michael Bolton albums Category:1991 albums Category:Albums produced by Walter Afanasieff Category:Columbia Records albums ",
