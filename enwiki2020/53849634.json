This was Ostapenko's first WTA Tour-level singles title. She became the first Latvian player, male or female, to win a Grand Slam singles tournament, the youngest woman to win the French Open since 1997, and the first woman since Barbara Jordan at the 1979 Australian Open to win a Grand Slam event as her first tour-level singles title. Ostapenko was the first unseeded woman to win the Grand Slam since Kim Clijsters in the 2009 US Open. She was also the first unseeded woman to reach the French Open final since Mima Jau\u0161ovec in 1983, the first unseeded woman to win the French Open since Margaret Scriven in 1933, and as well as the lowest- ranked (47) since computer rankings began in 1975. Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza was the defending champion, having won the tournament in 2016, but she was defeated in the fourth round by Kristina Mladenovic. It was the first time at the French Open since 1977, and any Grand Slam event since the 1979 Australian Open that no former Grand Slam champion reached the quarterfinals. As a result of Halep's loss in the final, Angelique Kerber retained the WTA No. 1 singles ranking even though she lost in the first round. Kerber's loss marked the first time the top women's seed had lost her first round match at the French Open in the Open Era, and the first time this had happened at any Grand Slam tournament since the 2001 Wimbledon Championships. This was the first French Open since 2011 to feature neither Maria Sharapova nor Serena Williams in the final. This was the first Grand Slam tournament to feature neither player since the 2002 Australian Open. ==Seeds== Angelique Kerber (First round) Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 (Semifinals) Simona Halep (Final) Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza (Fourth round) Elina Svitolina (Quarterfinals) Dominika Cibulkov\u00e1 (Second round) Johanna Konta (First round) Svetlana Kuznetsova (Fourth round) Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska (Third round) Venus Williams (Fourth round) Caroline Wozniacki (Quarterfinals) Madison Keys (Second round) Kristina Mladenovic (Quarterfinals) Elena Vesnina (Third round) Petra Kvitov\u00e1 (Second round) Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova (Second round) Anastasija Sevastova (Third round) Kiki Bertens (Second round) Coco Vandeweghe (First round) Barbora Str\u00fdcov\u00e1 (Second round) Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro (Fourth round) Mirjana Lu\u010di\u0107-Baroni (First round) Samantha Stosur (Fourth round) Daria Gavrilova (First round) Lauren Davis (First round) Daria Kasatkina (Third round) Yulia Putintseva (Third round) Caroline Garcia (Quarterfinals) Ana Konjuh (Second round) Timea Bacsinszky (Semifinals) Roberta Vinci (First round) Zhang Shuai (Third round) ==Qualifying== ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ===Bottom half=== ====Section 5==== ====Section 6==== ====Section 7==== ====Section 8==== == References == ==External links== *2017 French Open \u2013 Women's draws and results at the International Tennis Federation Women's Singles Category:French Open by year \u2013 Women's Singles French Open - Women's Singles ",
