    "text": "New Explorations into Science, Technology and Math, abbreviated NEST+M, is a public school located on the Lower East Side of the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, and is under the supervision of the New York City Department of Education, serving grades kindergarten through 12th grade (the only K-12 public school in Manhattan). The school exclusively enrolls New York City resident K\u20133 children scoring within the 97th, 98th, or 99th percentile and sixth-graders at the 95th percentile nationwide in standardized tests administered by the New York City Department of Education for their Gifted & Talented Program. It is one of only five such New York citywide programs where qualified elementary or middle school students from any school district in any borough may enroll, and also the only program with a dedicated facility (the other four programs share schools with the general education student population) and the only program serving grades K through 12. Prospective 9th and 10th-grade students apply through the NYC High School Application Process as well as their entrance exam. As of September 2017, Principal Mark Berkowitz eliminated the NEST+m entrance exam and published the new rubric on the NEST+m website. In April 2020, Principal Mark Berkowitz resigned and accepted a position as Principal at Pelham Memorial High School located in Pelham, NY. Meaghan Lynch became the interim acting principal on July 1st, 2020. __NOTOC__ ==See also== * List of high schools in New York City * List of public elementary schools in New York City == References == == External links == *NEST+m at NYCDOE * Category:Lower East Side Category:Public elementary schools in Manhattan Category:Public high schools in Manhattan Category:Public middle schools in Manhattan ",
