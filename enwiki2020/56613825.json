    "text": "Tungku is a populated place located on the outskirts of Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei. It is the collective name for the village subdivision of Tungku and the public housing areas of Tungku Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme (). == Geography == Tungku is located in the central part of Brunei-Muara District on the north-western outskirts of Bandar Seri Begawan, hence de facto a suburb of the capital. The neighbouring populated places include Rimba to the east and north-east as well as Katok to the south. As a village subdivision, the area of Tungku actually extends northwards to the coast with the South China Sea. == Administration == By the Malay name (literally 'Tungku Village'), Tungku is a designated village administrative division, the third-level and lowest subdivision of Brunei. However, the area does not include the three clusters of public housing under the (translated as 'Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme'); they are also designated as separate 'villages', namely Tungku Landless Indigenous Citizens' Housing Scheme Area 1, Area 2 and Area 3 (also known as Katok 'A'). Nevertheless, the populated areas are almost all concentrated in the southern part of the subdivision area; the northern part is largely unpopulated. == Education == University of Brunei Darussalam and Brunei Technological University, two of the only few universities in the country, are located within Tungku subdivision area. However, as they are located in its northern part, the universities are rather in the vicinity of the populated places of Rimba than that of Tungku. Similarly, Jerudong International School is located within Tungku as well as near the universities' campuses. It is one of the few international schools in the country, and offers British curriculum from kindergarten to sixth form. Tungku is also home to the Mechanical Campus of the Institute of Brunei Technical Education, a post-secondary institution providing vocational education in the field of automotive engineering. Primary education is provided for the resident pupils of Tungku in two government primary schools: Tungku Primary School and Katok 'A' Primary School. They also share grounds with the religious schools of their namesakes, which provide Islamic religious education that are compulsory for Muslim pupils in Brunei. There is currently no secondary school in Tungku; prospective students go the secondary schools in the neighbouring settlements. == Infrastructure == === Roads === Access to the populated areas of Tungku is served by Jalan Tungku from the south-east, and Jalan Rakyat Jati Rimba and the Tungku\u2013Jerudong Highway from the north. Jalan Tungku is the main road in the settlement which traverses the area in the north-west\u2013south-east direction. Jalan Rakyat Jati Rimba and the Tungku\u2013Jerudong Highway terminate in Tungku at a roundabout junction with Jalan Tungku north of the settlement. == Religion == Pengiran Muda 'Abdul Malik Mosque is the sole mosque in Tungku which provides the place for its Muslim residents to conduct Islamic congregational activities in particular the Jumu'ah or weekly Friday prayers. It was inaugurated in 2012 by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, the Sultan of Brunei. The mosque has a capacity for 1,000 worshippers. It is also shared with the residents of Katok. == Recreation == The border of Tungku subdivision area with the South China Sea can be found Tungku Beach, which has been made a recreational ground. As of 25 June 2020 the beach has been permanently closed to public, being transferred to private ownership. == References == Category:Populated places in Brunei ",
