Officially launched May 17, 2016, the site describes itself as \u201cthe premier platform for exploring the intersections of race, sports and culture.\u201d The Undefeated is overseen by ESPN senior VP and editor-in-chief Kevin Merida. == History == In 2014, ESPN announced the creation of a new website \"that will provide in-depth coverage, commentary and insight on sports, race and culture directed towards the African-American audience\". Editor-in-chief Jason Whitlock described the then-unnamed site as a \u201cBlack Grantland,\u201d a reference to the now-defunct ESPN sports website overseen by popular sports columnist Bill Simmons. Whitlock said the name \"The Undefeated\" was inspired by a passage from American poet Maya Angelou: \u201cYou may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated.\u201d While the site was still in development, a Deadspin report alleged that Whitlock was \u201cpoisoning\u201d The Undefeated with an unconventional management style that made it difficult for the site to attract and retain prime talent, with several anonymous sources documenting an extremely negative work environment. On June 12, 2015, the New York Times reported that Whitlock had been removed from his post. Whitlock attributed his dismissal to \u201cnumerous reasons, including my foolish belief that I could manage like a football coach. I learned there\u2019s an art to corporate politics that I\u2019m not good at.\u201d On October 19, 2015, ESPN issued a statement announcing that Kevin Merida, author, journalist and Washington Post managing editor, would assume the editor-in-chief position at The Undefeated. On January 25, 2018, ESPN announced that Jemele Hill would begin a new role at The Undefeated. == Notable achievements == On June 25, 2016, Michael Jordan issued an exclusive statement to The Undefeated announcing his $2 million donation to organizations working to improve police-community relations. In August, 2015, The Undefeated hosted a town hall meeting entitled \u201cAn Undefeated Conversation: Athletes, Responsibility, and Violence.\u201d The event occurred at the South Side YMCA in Chicago. Among the panelists was Chicago native and Chicago Bulls guard Dwyane Wade, who appeared via satellite. Other panelists included Chicago Bulls point guard Rajon Rondo, former Detroit Pistons point guard Isiah Thomas, WNBA/Chicago Sky guard Cappie Pondexter, and ESPN analysts Doug Glanville and Marcellus Wiley. On October 11, 2016, the site hosted \"The Undefeated Conversation with President Obama: Sports, Race and Achievement,\" a forum at North Carolina A&T; State University in Greensboro. == References == ==External links== * Category:Internet properties established in 2016 Category:American sport websites Category:ESPN ",
