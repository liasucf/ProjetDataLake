The Reform Party collapsed and Thorburn went into opposition as leader of the new Tory Party. Goodridge's Tories lost the 1893 election to the Liberals led by Sir William Whiteway. However, the Tories complained that Whiteway's Liberals had promised jobs to Newfoundlanders who voted for him and filed petitions in the Supreme Court under the Corrupt Practices Act against fifteen Liberal members of the House alleging bribery and corruption. The members were tried and found guilty and their seats were declared vacant. In April 1894, in the midsts of the trials, Whiteway attempted to dissolve the House of Assembly and call new elections. Instead, Governor Sir Arthur Murray refused Whiteway's requested and instead appointed Goodridge as the new Premier despite the fact that Goodridge's Tories were outnumbered by Liberals in the House of Assembly.\"Bond Moves Past Bribery Charges, Becomes Prime Minister\".

Goodridge lost his seat in the 1904 election. A few years later he was appointed to the Legislative Council (Newfoundland's upper house) by Prime Minister Edward Patrick Morris. ==References== == External links == * * Category:1839 births Category:1920 deaths Category:Premiers of Newfoundland Colony Category:Members of the Legislative Council of Newfoundland Category:Dominion of Newfoundland politicians ",
