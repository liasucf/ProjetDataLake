    "text": "The Bad Bunch ( Tom) is an American 1973 blaxploitation drama film directed by and co-starring Greydon Clark. ==Plot== The film is a study of prejudice and discrimination. It tells the story of a black gang who run the streets of Watts and of Jim, a white man, who tries to befriend them. Prejudice stands in the way of any friendship and turns black against white in a mid '70s, does much to show how society has progressed, but to some it may seem that \"the more things change, the more they stay the same.\" ==Release== The film was released theatrically in the United States by Four Star International in 1973 and re-released by Dimension Pictures in 1976. The film was released on a double feature DVD with Clark's Hi-Riders by VCI Home Entertainment in 2010. ==See also== * List of American films of 1973 ==External links== * * Category:1973 films Category:Blaxploitation films Category:American action drama films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Greydon Clark Category:1970s action drama films Category:1973 drama films ",
