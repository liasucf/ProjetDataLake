    "text": "Carlo Vidusso (1911 in Talcahuano \u2013 1978 in Milan) was an Italian pianist. He studied piano with Ernesto Drangosch and, at 9 years old, got the diploma in Buenos Aires. He moved to Italy, studied composition with Giulio Cesare Paribeni and Renzo Bossi at the Conservatorio of Milano and continued his piano studies with Carlo Lonati. A virtuoso with ease of reading, at 20 years old he began a brilliant concert career, performing in Italy and around Europe. Due to a disorder in his third finger of the right hand, he stopped the public performances towards the end of 1953, then fully dedicated himself to teaching. Maurizio Pollini is among his many students. He fingered and revised many piano compositions. == References == Category:Italian classical pianists Category:male classical pianists Category:Italian male pianists Category:1911 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Milan Conservatory alumni Category:Chilean classical pianists Category:Chilean emigrants to Italy Category:Chilean people of Italian descent Category:People from Talcahuano Category:20th-century classical pianists Category:20th-century Italian musicians Category:20th-century Italian male musicians ",
