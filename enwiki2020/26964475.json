The event was the fourth that the UFC has hosted at the Bell Centre following UFC 83, UFC 97 and UFC 113 and the fifth event held in Canada along with UFC 115 which was held in Vancouver, British Columbia. ==Background== A training injury forced Jason MacDonald out of his fight with Rafael Natal on October 20, 2010. He was replaced by UFC newcomer Jesse Bongfeldt. On October 26, 2010, Anthony Waldburger had to pull out of his fight with Matthew Riddle due to an injury. He was replaced by Sean Pierson. UFC 124 featured live preliminary bouts streamed on UFC.com rather than Spike TV due to the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards being aired in the same time slot. UFC 124 marked the first \u2013 and only \u2013 time that the UFC let the fans vote online for the Fight of the Night. Dana White stated after that he would never do this again and said \"The real fight of the night belonged to Matt Riddle and Sean Pierson\". ==Results== ==Bonus Awards== Fighters were awarded $100,000 bonuses. *Fight of the Night: Georges St-Pierre vs. Josh Koscheck *Knockout of the Night: Mac Danzig *Submission of the Night: Mark Bocek and Jim Miller (split, $50,000 each) ==References== ==See also== * Ultimate Fighting Championship * List of UFC champions * List of UFC events * 2010 in UFC Category:Ultimate Fighting Championship events Category:Mixed martial arts in Canada Category:Sports competitions in Montreal Category:2010 in mixed martial arts Category:2010 in Quebec ",
