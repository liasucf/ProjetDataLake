    "text": "\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\" is a rock song, written by American songwriters Scott English and Larry Weiss and first released as a single in March 1967 by The Attack, followed a few days later by Jeff Beck. Because Beck's version charted first, the song is most often associated with him. ==Background== Songwriters English and Weiss started writing a song together, with a chorus of \"Hi ho silver lining\", but no verses. When producer Mickie Most heard their early version, he suggested that it would be a hit and persuaded English to complete the lyrics. According to writer and musician Bob Stanley, English wanted to record a finished version of the song himself, so decided to deter Most by writing \"the most unusable, stupid lyric he could think up, about flies in pea soup and beach umbrellas\". To English's chagrin, Most liked the song, and had Jeff Beck record it.Bob Stanley, \"Music to visit\", Record Collector, #507, July 2020, p.52 ==Jeff Beck version== The song was not included on the album Truth when first released in 1968 (but is a bonus track on the 2006 reissue). Beck performed \"Hi Ho Silver Lining\" live on the charity benefit show, the ARMS Charity Concert for multiple sclerosis, featuring an all-star jam with Steve Winwood and Simon Phillips in 1983. The song was resurrected for the \"Together and Apart\" Japanese and US tours with Eric Clapton in 2009 and 2010. According to Kate Mossman, writing in the New Statesman, Beck \"has likened 'Hi Ho Silver Lining' to having a pink toilet seat hung around your neck for the rest of your life.\" ===Formats and track listings=== 1967 7\" single (UK/Holland: Columbia DB 8151, New Zealand: Columbia DNZ 10497, Portugal: Columbia 8E 006-93925) *A. \"Hi Ho Silver Lining\" (English, Weiss) 2:53 *B. \"Beck's Bolero\" (Page) 2:52 ===Chart positions=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1967) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- | Irish Singles Chart| Irish Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|17 |- | UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|14 |- | Australian Go-Set Top 40 Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|25 |- |} ===Personnel=== * Jeff Beck - guitars, vocals * John Paul Jones - bass guitar * Clem Cattini - drums * Rod Stewart - backing vocals * Mickie Most - producer ==References== Category:1967 debut singles Category:Psychedelic pop songs Category:Song recordings produced by Mickie Most Category:Songs written by Scott English Category:Jeff Beck songs Category:Songs written by Larry Weiss Category:1967 songs Category:EMI Records singles ",
