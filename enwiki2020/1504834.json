Development was carried out by Saab and the car was manufactured in Trollh\u00e4ttan, Sweden, alongside the Saab 9-3 and the Saab 9-5. Sales of the sedan began in March 2006, with a station wagon joining the line for 2007. Starting in 2007, the BLS was sold in the Middle East, Mexico, South Africa and South Korea. It was never sold in the United States nor Canada. BLS production reached 3,257 in 2006 and 2,772 in 2007.Automobil Revue, catalog 2008, p. 47auto motor und sport, #3/2008, p.13 Production ended in 2009. ==Features== The BLS was available with a diesel engine (a 1.9 L turbocharged four-cylinder) and two petrol engines (a 2.8 L turbocharged V6 and a 2.0 L available with two power levels). At in overall length, the BLS was almost six inches shorter than the CTS, the smallest Cadillac available in North America. Engines: * 1.9 L Fiat turbodiesel I4 16v, 150 hp (110 kW) * 1.9 L Fiat turbodiesel I4 16v, 180 hp (132 kW) (2007-) * 2.0 L Ecotec LK9 I4, mid-pressure turbo, 175 hp (129 kW) * 2.0 L Ecotec LK9 I4, high-pressure turbo, 210 hp (154 kW) * 2.0 T FlexPower 200 hp (147 kW) * 2.8 L HFV6 V6, turbo, 250 hp (184 kW) ==Reviews== *Auto Express 'The BLS is OK, but offers nothing new in a market overflowing with talent.' *Evo http://www.evo.co.uk/carreviews/evocarreviews/65832/cadillac_bls.html [+] Stylish and quiet [-] Pushes no boundaries. *Honest John Positives: Based on the Saab 9-3 so decent handling. Well proven mechanicals. Saab-grade safety. Negatives: The ride is far from forgiving. Automatic doesn't work well with the V6 turbo, which also has overly light steering. *Verdict On Cars 'Average. It's built in Europe, shares most of its underpinnings with a Saab and will never see America - meet the strangest Cadillac ever.' ==Name== The BLS is known by many as the \"Bob Lutz Special\" - a reference to Vice Chairman Bob Lutz who oversaw all GM product development at the time. Lutz, a supporter of badge engineering, wanted to leverage the SAAB 9-3 to fill holes in Cadillac's product range. The reference to Bob Lutz can be viewed both as support and as criticism of his strategy. While the BLS was a market failure, many of the techniques of badge engineering employed in the BLS resulted in other GM product successes, most notably a significant improvement in overall passenger car product quality and performance output. Under Lutz's revamped strategy, most Cadillac model names had no meaning (aside from preceding models, such as DTS for Deville Touring Sedan, or CTS for Catera Touring Sedan). Hence, the BLS has no official name for its abbreviation - fueling the community namesake. While GM has never formally said why the BLS bore its name, it is likely the B was chosen for being smaller than the CTS mid-size sedan, L for Luxury, and S for Sedan. This is consistent with the Seville Luxury Sedan, or later the Cadillac SLS. ==References== ==External links== *Parker's BLS Review *WhatCar.Com BLS Review *Car and Driver Article on BLS Debut *Auto Express Review BLS 2.0T BLS Category:Mid-size cars Category:Compact executive cars Category:Sedans Category:Station wagons Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Cars introduced in 2006 Category:2010s cars ",
