    "text": "Capiz (Capiznon/Hiligaynon: Kapuoran sang Capiz; ) is a province in the Philippines located in the central section of Western Visayas region. Its capital is the city of Roxas. It is located at the northeastern portion of Panay Island, bordering Aklan to the north, Antique to the west, and Iloilo to the south. Capiz faces the Sibuyan Sea to the north. Capiz is known for the Placuna placenta oyster shell that has the same name locally and is used for decoration and making lampshades, trays, window and doors. Likewise, the province is known as the \"Seafood Capital of the Philippines\" and was among the top 15 most frequently visited places in the Philippines. Capiz is the site of the famous coral-stone Santa Monica Church in the town of Pan-ay, home to the largest Catholic Church bell in Asia. The bell was made from 70 sacks of gold and silver coins donated by the townsfolk. Measuring seven feet in diameter, five feet in height and weighing 10,400 kilograms or just over 10 metric tons, the Pan-ay bell is popular among tourists visiting Capiz. == History == The account of early Spanish explorers about Capiz and its people was traced back in 1566 when the Spaniards set foot in the mouth of Banica river. Early settlements were seen in the town of Pan-ay which the town originally called \"Bamban\" which was changed by the early Spaniards to \"Panay\", a word which means \"mouth of the river.\" This is also the location of a fortress built by Juan de la Isla in late 1570. The Paseo de Evangelizacion 1566 can be found in the town plaza and was erected through the efforts of Rev. Msgr. Benjamin F. Advincula. When the Spaniards led by Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi came to Panay from Cebu in 1569, after sailing from Mexico, they found people with tattoos, and so they called the island Isla de los Pintados. How the island itself came to be called Panay is uncertain. The Aeta (Negritos) called it Aninipay, after a plant that abounded in the island. Legend has it that L\u00f3pez de Legazpi and his men, in search of food, exclaimed upon the island, pan hay en esta isla! \"There is bread in this island\"! and the island of Panay closely resembles the shape of a heart and the heart of Jesus Christ is considered present in the Eucharistic Bread. Panay is also an echo of Pannai, a constituent state in Srivijaya that housed an officially Buddhist Monastic-Army that defended the conflict-prone strait of Malacca, the world's busiest maritime trade route for half a millennium and had successfully defended the territory against larger navies from giant countries like India, China and Indonesia before a treacherous and unexpected attack from the Chola- occupied capital destroyed Srivijaya and sacked Pannai. Idealistic Datus and their most faithful soldiers who refused to submit to foreign imperialism left the golden chains they had in Sumatra and migrated to Panay island to rebuild a society much truer to their ideals and had even achieved more democracy since they developed their initial mandala even further, the original concept of the mandala being a dynamic interaction sphere based on Tantric cosmology and political thought, with a definite center and the Datus of Panay then expounded on that tradition and decided to make the Mandala resistant to destruction by making it into a Kedatuan, establishing a Semi-democratic Hindu-Buddhist influenced Confederation known as the Kedatuan of Madja-as where capitals and were routinely being transferred and different Datus took turns holding the crown. The Spanish then came and established their first settlement on the island at the mouth of the Banica River and called it Pan- ay. This was the second Spanish settlement in the Philippines, following San Miguel, Cebu. Unknown to many, Calle Revoluci\u00f3n in Panay town is the second oldest street in the Philippines after Calle Colon in Cebu City, Central Visayas. Later in 1569, Captain Diego de Artieda, who was sent by Legazpi, landed in the Town of Panay and proclaimed it as the capital of the province. Later, the Spaniards moved the capital to its present site upon discovering the town of Capiz (not the province, and now Roxas City) which was near the sea and provided docking facilities. The province was created a separate encomienda and was later organized into a politico-military unit in 1716. The American takeover of the Philippines resulted in the establishment of a civil government in Capiz on April 15, 1901 by virtue of Act 115. The Panayanon's noble character and royal blood shone out in later centuries when fellow people from Panay island, at Iloilo City was given the Queen of the Spain, the Royal Title of \"Most Loyal and Noble City\" for being the most ardent and faithful city in the Spanish empire and had clung on to Spain while the entire empire collapsed. Although Capiz joined the Tagalog lead Philippine revolution, the Spaniards didn't surrender to the Tagalogs but they did surrender to the people of Iloilo and eventually Iloilo and Capiz were part of the same \"Federal Republic of the Visayas\" a substate which was formed within the First Philippine Republic, the first capital of which was in Cavite while the United States of America had betrayed the Philippine Revolution which they initially supported and in which, influential American officers swore loyalty to, by breaking their oaths and occupying Manila. In 1942, the province was occupied by Japanese troops and was later liberated by the joint Filipino and American troops with Capiznon guerrillas in 1945. Capiz and Aklan were united under one province until 25 April 1956, when President Ramon Magsaysay signed into law Republic Act 1414 separating the two entities. == Geography == upright=1.25 Capiz covers a total area of occupying the northeastern portion of Panay Island, and is one of the five provinces that compose the Western Visayas region.
