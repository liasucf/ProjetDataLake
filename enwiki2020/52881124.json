Sims was asked to demo the song more than a year before she went back into the studio to record the commercially released version. She told in an 1991 interview, \"I guess they must have decided to give it to someone else, but they came back eventually.\" ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard stated in his review that producer/songwriter Steve \"Silk\" Hurley \"once again reaffirms his position as Chicago's finest on this wriggling, R&B-inflected; houser.\" He noted that newcomer Sims \"exudes the confidence and range of a seasoned pro, while remixer Maurice Joshua drops another of his deep underground workouts.\" Pop Rescue called the song \"infectious\", noting that it is \"laden with those catchy italia-house pianos, and fast beats, her vocals cut through them perfectly as she sings about a love lost.\" ==Chart performance== The song spent 12 weeks on the UK Singles Chart, over the festive period of 1991/1992 and peaked at number 5 in its sixth week at the chart, on January 5, 1992. It was certified silver and became a huge club hit. Elsewhere in Europe, \"Too Blind to See It\" also peaked at number 6 in Finland, number 8 in Denmark and number 14 in Belgium. On the Eurochart Hot 100, it reached number 22. Outside Europe, the song peaked at number 1 in Zimbabwe, number 5 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in the US and number 16 in Australia.
