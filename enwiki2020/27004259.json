The narrow shell is elongated and subturreted. It is of a bright, transparent ash color, covered with longitudinal waved and reddish lines. The elongated spire is composed of seven or eight slightly convex whorls. They are marked at their upper part by a marginated suture, and two slightly apparent striae towards the base. The body whorl is shorter than the spire, marked at its base with regular, transverse striae or ridges. The oval aperture is oblong, smooth and white. The outer lip is thin and sharp, slightly plaited internally. The columella, slightly arcuated, is terminated by a pretty prominent oblique fold.Kiener (1840).
