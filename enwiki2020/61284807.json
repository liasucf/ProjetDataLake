It is located in the centre of the city. It was founded in 1926 by a former Parisian notary, Eug\u00e8ne Fuchs, in one of the oldest factories in the city, originally built by perfumer Claude Mottet in 1841. The firm is named after the great local painter Jean Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, himself the son of a master perfumer at the court. Fragonard opened its first Parisian boutique in 1936, after launching two successful perfumes. The firm also owns a free museum in Paris, the Mus\u00e9e du Parfum, which presents rare objects that evoke the history of perfumery for more than 5000 years. The company is run by Fran\u00e7oise and Agn\u00e8s Costa, great granddaughters of Eug\u00e8ne Fuchs. ==Famous perfumes== * Billet Doux (1930) * Moment Vol\u00e9 (1930) * Eau de Hongrie (r\u00e9\u00e9dition) * Belle de Nuit (1946) * Soleil (1995) ==References== * Official website * History of Fragonard, Les \u00c9chos , December 9, 2005 Category: Perfume houses Category: Companies of France Category:French brands Category:French companies established in 1926 ",
