    "text": "The Chief Management Officer (CMO) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) is the third-in-command of the department after the Secretary of Defense and Deputy Secretary of Defense. The position's purpose is to reduce costs by improving the quality and productivity of DoD's business operations. ==Organization== The CMO's office contains six \"reform leaders\" in the areas of logistics and supply chains, real property, community services, human resources, and health care, and a Program Executive Officer for IT Business Systems. The office also oversees Washington Headquarters Services and Pentagon Force Protection Agency, and contains an Oversight and Compliance Directorate, and a Headquarters Support Directorate. ==History== In 2005, the U.S. Government Accountability Office recommended that DoD create a CMO position to avoid fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement in its reform program. However, DoD declined to create an independent CMO position, and instead assigned CMO responsibilities to the Deputy Secretary of Defense in September 2007. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 codified this into law, and created a Deputy CMO subordinate to the Deputy Secretary. In 2011, the functions of the Business Transformation Agency were transferred to the Deputy CMO when that agency was disestablished. Creation of the CMO position was mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, and became effective on 1 February 2018. The Deputy CMO position was replaced with the new CMO position. While the Deputy CMO was an internal advisor to the Deputy Secretary, the CMO is more powerful. The CMO is third-in-command of DoD, thus outranking the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and has authority to order the three officeholders to implement reforms. ==List== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
