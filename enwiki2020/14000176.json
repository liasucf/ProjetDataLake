    "text": "Danie Gerber (born 14 April 1958 in Port Elizabeth, South Africa) is a former South African rugby union player, who played for South Africa between 1980 and 1992. He played mainly at inside or outside centre, but also on the wing. His international career was severely limited because of South Africa's sporting isolation caused by apartheid. He won only 24 caps for South Africa (scoring 19 trieshttps://www.rugbyworld.com/rugby-positions/centres/danie- gerber-65393), despite playing internationally for 12 years. However despite this, in 2007 he was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. ==Early life== Gerber initially played football and cricket at school level, but accelerated quickly when starting rugby, playing for SA schools.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZGcJbodgQQ ==Rugby career== In South African domestic rugby Gerber played 115 games for Eastern Province, 40 for Western Province and 24 for Orange Free State. Gerber's international career of games played and Points scored: * In 1980 he played two tests against the South American Jaguars (a team mainly made up of Argentine players but also included a few Uruguayan, Chilean, Paraguayan and Brazilian players) in Montevideo and Santiago. He scored a try in each test. He also played one test against France in Pretoria without scoring any points, and one other test that year. * In 1981 he played two tests against Ireland in Cape Town (scoring two tries) and in Durban without scoring points. He also went on the 1981 Springbok Tour of New Zealand, playing in all three tests, (Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland) without scoring any points. The infamous tour was lost by the Springboks due to a controversial penalty by the referee four minutes into injury time in the final test. (Ray Mordt scored three tries in the final test of the series.) He also played the final test of 1981 against the USA in Glenville, without scoring any points. * In 1982 he played two tests against the South American Jaguars (again, mainly made up of Argentine players but also included a few Uruguayan, Chilean, Paraguayan and Brazilian players) scoring three tries in Pretoria and one in Bloemfontein. * In 1984 he played two tests against England, scoring one try in his hometown, Port Elizabeth and three in Johannesburg. In this series Gerber played outside South Africa's first ever Black player, Errol Tobias, in the series, and scored three tries in the second Test. Again the South American Jaguars toured South Africa and Gerber scored one try and one conversion in Pretoria and one try in Cape Town. * In 1986 the New Zealand Cavaliers (a rebel tour conducted against the wishes of the NZ Rugby Union) toured South Africa, Gerber played in all four 'test' fixtures in Cape Town, Durban, Pretoria and Johannesburg and only managed one try in the Pretoria game. * In 1992, after a long period of South African rugby isolation, Gerber played his final five test matches vs: New Zealand in Johannesburg scoring two tries, Australia in Cape Town without scoring any points, France in Lyon and Parc des Princes scoring one try in each match. His final test was against England on Twickenham which went without scoring any points. === Test history === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! No. !! Opposition !! Result (SA 1st) !! Position !!
