    "text": "Thomas King (c. 1740 \u2013 c. 1824) was a British slave-trader and partner in the firm of Camden, Calvert and King. His early career was at sea in a variety of vessels involved in the slave trade in the Caribbean and West Africa in the 1760s. He probably met his future business partners Anthony Calvert (1735\u20131809) and William Camden at this time when he was master on ships owned by them. He first partnered with them as Camden, Calvert and King for the voyage of the Three Good Friends to St Vincent in 1773 and the firm subsequently made many slaving and trading voyages in which they transported at least 22,000 enslaved persons, mostly from West Africa to the Caribbean. In 1776 he was tried for murder at the Old Bailey in London but acquitted. He was a governor of the Foundling Hospital in London, elected to the Elder Brethren of Trinity House, and one of the founder subscribers of Lloyds of London. King acquired significant wealth and owned a number of estates in British Guiana (now Guyana). He left an estate of \u00a3120,000 in 1824. ==Early life and family== The year of King's birth is unknown. His father was Newark King and his family had connections with the East Riding of Yorkshire.Cozens, Kenneth James.

He became close friends with Anthony Calvert and named one of his sons Anthony Calvert King.Cozens, p. 32.

He was said to have kicked Warren to death while calling him \"an Irish son of a bitch\". His bail of \u00a3500 was provided by Calvert and the London wine merchant Robert Manley. He was acquitted of the charge.Cozens, p. 67.\"The Slave Trade is Merciful Compared to [This\"] by Emma Christopher in His sea career was summarised in evidence given to the House of Commons in 1789.Abridgement of the Minutes of the Evidence, Taken Before a Committee of the Whole House, To Whom it was Referred to Consider of the Slave-Trade. 1789. pp. 66\u201377. ==Camden, Calvert and King== The first venture in which King partnered with Anthony Calvert and William Camden was the voyage of the Three Good Friends to St Vincent via Cape Coast Castle in 1773 when he was joint master with Calvert.Cozens, pp. 21\u201322 & 83. Ships of the firm made 77 voyages carrying slaves between the 1780s and the early 1800s and transported over 22,000 enslaved persons from West Africa, 65% of whom disembarked in Jamaica, 12% in the Guianas, 14% in other parts of the Caribbean and the remainder elsewhere; the firm's activities also included supplying British dockyards and overseas garrisons, whaling, transporting convicts, and trading in commodities from the East Indies.Cozens, pp. 76\u201377.\"Human Capital in the British Slave Trade\" by Stephen D.
