    "text": "Ederzito Ant\u00f3nio Macedo Lopes ComM (born 22 December 1987), commonly known as Eder (), is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow and the Portugal national team. He started playing in 2008 with Acad\u00e9mica, and signed for Braga four years later. Over seven seasons, he amassed Primeira Liga totals of 143 matches and 38 goals, and also competed professionally in Wales, France and Russia. A Portuguese international since 2012, Eder represented the country at the 2014 World Cup and Euro 2016, winning the latter tournament and scoring the only goal in the final. ==Club career== ===Early years=== Born in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau, Eder moved to Portugal as a child, and started playing football with Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Desportiva e Cultural da Ad\u00e9mia in the Coimbra District at the age of 11. He made his senior debut with Oliveira do Hospital and Tourizense, the latter in the third division and the farm team of Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra. ===Acad\u00e9mica=== Eder made his Primeira Liga debut for Acad\u00e9mica on 24 August 2008, in a 0\u20131 away loss against Estrela da Amadora. He scored his first goal for the club at the end of the season, netting the Students equalising goal in an eventual 3\u20131 victory over Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Naval 1\u00ba de Maio. On 2 May 2010, Eder scored what looked like a winning goal against Nacional, but the visitors eventually drew it 3\u20133 in the 90th minute. On 12 September of the following year, against the same opponent and also in Coimbra, he bagged a brace in a 4\u20130 rout, finishing the season with five goals in 16 appearances; he also helped the club win its first Portuguese Cup since 1939 by defeating Sporting Clube de Portugal in the final, but he only featured in the earlier rounds, as he was suspended by his employers for not reporting to training for several weeks, as interest in acquiring his services arose. ===Braga=== In summer 2012, Eder signed with Braga for four years. He made his official debut for his new team on 2 September in a 0\u20132 loss at Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira but scored twice late into that month as the Minho Province side defeated Rio Ave 4\u20131 at home, contributing with one in a 4\u20134 home draw to Olhanense. On 30 November 2012, in the fifth round of the Ta\u00e7a de Portugal, Eder netted the winning goal as Braga defeated Porto 2\u20131, booking a place in the quarter-finals. On 6 January 2013, in a league match against Moreirense, he scored the game's only goal shortly after the restart; on 23 February he netted in each half of the local derby against Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es, in a 3\u20132 win at the Est\u00e1dio Municipal de Braga, but missed the rest of the campaign after suffering a ligament tear in early March. In the domestic cup final on 31 May 2015, Eder opened the scoring against Sporting with a penalty after C\u00e9dric Soares had been sent off for fouling Djavan, but missed in the penalty shootout as Braga eventually lost following a 2\u20132 draw. ===Swansea City / Lille=== On 28 June 2015, Premier League club Swansea City agreed a fee of around \u00a35 million to sign Eder on a three-year deal. He made his debut on 8 August, playing the final 11 minutes of a 2\u20132 draw at title holders Chelsea in place of Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis. Having not scored in 15 competitive games for the Swans \u2013 only four starts \u2013 Eder joined French side Lille on loan for the remainder of the season. He made his debut on 3 February 2016 as a half-time replacement for Yassine Benzia in a 1\u20130 home win against Stade Malherbe Caen, and scored his first goal four days later to open a 1\u20131 draw to Stade Rennais also at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy. On 23 April 2016, Eder played the full 90 minutes in the final of the Coupe de la Ligue, which ended in a 1\u20132 loss against Paris Saint-Germain. On 24 May, after helping his team finish fifth and qualify to the UEFA Europa League, he signed a permanent four-year contract. On 2 March 2017, Eder scored the final goal (four minutes into injury time after 90 minutes of normal time had elapsed) in a 2\u20131 away win over Championnat de France Amateur club Bergerac P\u00e9rigord in the round of 16. ===Lokomotiv Moscow=== On 23 August 2017, Eder joined Russian Premier League club Lokomotiv Moscow in a season-long loan with a buyout option. On 5 May 2018, he scored the winning goal in the 87th minute from Vladislav Ignatyev's cross against Zenit Saint Petersburg in a 1\u20130 triumph, which helped to grant his team their first league title since 2004. On 16 July 2018, Eder moved to the RZD Arena on a permanent basis. ==International career== Italy's Andrea Ranocchia in a June 2015 friendly. Eder chose to represent Portugal internationally. After impressive club performances for Braga, he was first called up by the national team in August 2012 for a match against Luxembourg for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, but remained an unused substitute in the 2\u20131 away win on 7 September. He made his debut four days later in the same competition, replacing H\u00e9lder Postiga in the dying minutes of a 3\u20130 home victory over Azerbaijan. On 19 May 2014, Eder was named in the final 23-man squad for the tournament in Brazil. He made his debut in the competition on 16 June, replacing injured Hugo Almeida in the first half of a 0\u20134 group stage loss to Germany. In the second game, a 2\u20132 draw against the United States, he replaced another injured striker early on, this time Postiga. Eder's first international goal came on his 18th cap, the only goal in a friendly victory over Italy at the Stade de Gen\u00e8ve on 16 June 2015. He was selected by Fernando Santos for his UEFA Euro 2016 squad, appearing in three games as a substitute and scoring the only goal in the final to help defeat hosts France after extra time. Eder was not picked for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup squad, being replaced by Porto's Andr\u00e9 Silva. He was included in a preliminary 35-man list for the 2018 World Cup, but did not make the final cut. ==Style of play== Eder is a strong, hard-working and well- rounded striker, with a solid first touch. Usually deployed as a centre forward, he excels in the air due to his height and powerful physique, although he is also capable of playing in other offensive positions due to his ability to hold up the ball with his back to goal and play-off his teammates. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Tourizense |2006\u201307 |Portuguese Second Division |7||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||8||1 |- |2007\u201308 |Portuguese Second Division |34||10||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||35||10 |- |2008\u201309 |Portuguese Second Division |1||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !42!!11!!3!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!45!!11 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Acad\u00e9mica |2008\u201309 |Primeira Liga |24||1||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||30||1 |- |2009\u201310 |Primeira Liga |22||4||5||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||27||6 |- |2010\u201311 |Primeira Liga |21||2||6||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||27||5 |- |2011\u201312 |Primeira Liga |16||5||5||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||21||6 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !83!!12!!22!!6!!0!!0!!0!!0!!105!!18 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Braga |2012\u201313 |Primeira Liga |18||13||7||3||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||31||16 |- |2013\u201314 |Primeira Liga |13||3||2||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||4 |- |2014\u201315 |Primeira Liga |29||10||6||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||35||13 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !60!!26!!15!!7!!7!!0!!0!!0!!82!!33 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Swansea City |2015\u201316 |Premier League |13||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||15||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !13!!0!!2!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!15!!0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Lille |2015\u201316 |Ligue 1 |13||6||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||14||6 |- |2016\u201317 |Ligue 1 |31||6||5||1||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||37||7 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !44!!12!!6!!1!!1!!0!!0!!0!!51!!13 |- |Lokomotiv Moscow (loan) |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"3\"|Russian Premier League |18||4||1||0||9||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||28||4 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Lokomotiv Moscow |2018\u201319 |22||1||6||2||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||34||3 |- |2019\u201320 |14||4||1||1||5||0||1||0||21||5 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !54!!9!!8!!3!!20!!0!!1!!0!!83!!12 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !296!!70!!56!!17!!28!!0!!1!!0!!371!!87 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! colspan=3 |Portugal |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2012||4||0 |- |2013||2||0 |- |2014||10||0 |- |2015||5||1 |- |2016||11||3 |- |2017||1||0 |- |2018||2||1 |- !Total||35||5 |} ===International goals=== (Portugal score listed first, score column indicates score after each Eder goal) {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+ International goals by date, venue, cap, opponent, score, result and competition |- !scope=col|\u2116 !scope=col data-sort-type=date|Date !scope=col|Venue !scope=col|Cap !scope=col|Opponent !scope=col|Score !scope=col|Result !scope=col|Competition |- !scope=row|1 | 16 June 2015 || Stade de Gen\u00e8ve, Geneva, Switzerland ||align=center| 18 || ||align=center| 1\u20130 ||align=center| 1\u20130 || rowspan=3|Friendly |- !scope=row|2 | 29 May 2016 || Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o, Porto, Portugal ||align=center| 24 || ||align=center| 3\u20130 ||align=center| 3\u20130 |- !scope=row|3 | 8 June 2016 || Est\u00e1dio da Luz, Lisbon, Portugal ||align=center| 26 || ||align=center| 7\u20130 ||align=center| 7\u20130 |- !scope=row|4 | 10 July 2016 || Stade de France, Saint-Denis, France ||align=center| 29 || ||align=center| 1\u20130 ||align=center| 1\u20130 (a.e.t.)|| UEFA Euro 2016 Final |- !scope=row|5 | 14 October 2018 || Hampden Park, Glasgow, Scotland ||align=center| 34 || ||align=center| 2\u20130 ||align=center| 3\u20131 || Friendly |} ==Honours== ===Club=== Acad\u00e9mica *Ta\u00e7a de Portugal: 2011\u201312 Braga *Ta\u00e7a da Liga: 2012\u201313 Lokomotiv Moscow *Russian Premier League: 2017\u201318 *Russian Cup: 2018\u201319 *Russian Super Cup: 2019 ===International=== Portugal *UEFA European Championship: 2016 ===Orders=== *60px Commander of the Order of Merit ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Bissau-Guinean emigrants to Portugal Category:Sportspeople from Bissau Category:Black Portuguese sportspeople Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Primeira Liga players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:F.C.
