    "text": "Stone Pier as seen from the Nothe Fort Stone Pier, also known as South Pier, is a pier located on the southern side of the entrance of Weymouth Harbour, in Dorset, England. It extends out from the Nothe Peninsula, which is the location of the Nothe Fort and Nothe Gardens. ==History== Stone Pier was constructed in the 18th century at the entrance of Weymouth Harbour and was far shorter than the existing structure. Originally loose stones forming a breakwater continued out from the pier for a further 370 feet. A buoy was placed at the seaward end as the breakwater was covered at times of high tide. The Great Storms of 1824 caused much damage to the pier, resulting in a rebuild. Later in 1876, work was completed on a 250 feet extension to the pier along the breakwater below, which provided greater protection to Weymouth Pier opposite and vessels using the harbour. The pier was extended again in the 1910s, with a tower erected on the end to accommodate a navigational light. Reinforcement works were undertaken in the 1980s following storm damage. Today the pier is a popular place for sea anglers and walkers. == References == Category:1876 establishments in England Category:Buildings and structures in Weymouth, Dorset Category:Geography of Weymouth, Dorset Category:Tourist attractions in Weymouth, Dorset Category:Piers in Dorset ",
