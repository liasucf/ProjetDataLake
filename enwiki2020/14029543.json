    "text": "Doc is an American sitcom produced by MTM Enterprises which aired on CBS from September 13, 1975 to October 30, 1976. ==Synopsis== Doc starred Barnard Hughes as Dr. Joe Bogert, an elderly, kind-hearted general practitioner who divided his time between dealing with his dysfunctional patients and his even more dysfunctional family. Hughes had been seen occasionally on the CBS-TV sitcoms All in the Family as Father John Majeski and on The Bob Newhart Show as Bob's father Herb Hartley. On Doc, actress Elizabeth Wilson co-starred with Hughes as Joe's wife Annie, Judith Kahan as his daughter Laurie, John Harkins as Laurie's husband, and Mary Wickes as Joe's nurse, Tully. During the first season, the show had good ratings, partially due to its timeslot (Saturdays at 8:30 p.m., sandwiched between mega-hits The Jeffersons and The Mary Tyler Moore Show). CBS however thought the ratings should be better considering the scheduling and ordered the show to be reworked. When it returned in the fall of 1976, the format had been substantially changed, with Dr. Bogert now a widower, working at a down and out city clinic. Mary Wickes was the only other cast member from the first season to remain, but she departed after the first episode. Ratings slipped and the series was canceled in October 1976 after five episodes. Shortly after the series ended, Hughes returned to The Bob Newhart Show to guest star in a Christmas episode in December, 1976. ==Cast== * Barnard Hughes as Dr. Joe \"Doc\" Bogert * Elizabeth Wilson as Annie Bogert (season 1) * Judith Kahan as Laurie Bogert Fenner (season 1) * John Harkins as Fred Fenner (season 1) * Mary Wickes as Nurse Beatrice Tully * Irwin Corey as Happy Miller (season 2) * Audra Lindley as Janet Scott (season 2) * David Ogden Stiers (Stanley Moss (season 2) * Herbie Faye as Ben Goldman (season 2) * Ray Vitte as Woody Henderson (season 2) ==Episodes== ===Season 1 (1975\u201376)=== ===Season 2 (1976)=== ==External links== * * Category:1970s American sitcoms Category:1975 American television series debuts Category:1976 American television series endings Category:CBS original programming Category:1970s American medical television series Category:Television series about dysfunctional families Category:Television shows set in New York City Category:Television series by MTM Enterprises ",
