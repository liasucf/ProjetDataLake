His guitars were played by guitarists such as Fernando Sor, Ferdinando Carulli, Dionisio Aguado, Napol\u00e9on Coste, and Marco Aurelio Zani de Ferranti. Musicologist Ren\u00e9 Vannes referred to Lac\u00f4te as the \"Stradivarius of the guitar\" in his book Universal Dictionary of Luthiers. Lac\u00f4te apprenticed to the luthier Joseph Pons. Ferndando Sor mentioned in his book M\u00e9thode pour la Guitare that \"M. Lacote, a French maker, the only person who, besides his talents, has proved to me that he possesses the quality of not being inflexible to reasoning\". == Gallery == File:Early romantic guitar by Pierre Rene Lacote (FRETS.com Museum).jpg|1836 Lac\u00f4te guitar File:Strung instruments, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.jpg|1827 Lac\u00f4te 9-string guitar (top-right) File:Guitar MET DP-13191-001.jpg|Lac\u00f4te guitar ca. 1835 File:Napoleon Coste.jpg|Napol\u00e9on Coste with a Lac\u00f4te Heptacorde (left) File:\u00c9tiquette Lacote \u2014 1828 - T2p340.png|1828 Lac\u00f4te guitar label File:Musee-de-la- musique-6.jpg|Three Lac\u00f4te guitars (bottom row, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th guitars) == References == Category:1785 births Category:1855 deaths Category:Date of birth missing Category:Date of death missing Category:Place of death missing Category:Luthiers Category:Classical guitar makers Category:French musical instrument makers Category:People from Paris Category:18th-century French people Category:19th-century French people ",
