As a writer, he published under the pseudonym N. Garin (Russian: \u041d. \u0413\u0430\u0301\u0440\u0438\u043d), and since his death has been commonly referred to as the hyphenated Garin-Mikhailovsky. ==Career== As an engineer Garin-Mikhailovsky was involved in construction of the Laspi Pass highway and the Trans-Siberian Railway. In 1891 he headed the surveying party that chose the place for building a railroad bridge over River Ob for the Trans-Siberian Railway. It was Garin-Mikhailovsky who rejected the option of raising a bridge in Tomsk. This decision later resulted in the foundation of Novosibirsk and played a vital role in development of the city. He came down in the history of Russian literature as the author of the story Tyoma's Childhood (1892) and the short story Several Years in the Country. His travels in the Far East resulted in the travel notes Around Korea, Manchuria and Liaodong Peninsula (1899) and Korean Tales (1899). One of his stories was published in the first volume of Maxim Gorky's Znanie collections in 1904. His short story Practical Training is available in English translation in The Salt Pit, Raduga Publishers, 1988. Garin-Mikhailovsky square ==Legacy== The public square in front of the Novosibirsk train station is named after him. ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * * translation of \"\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439\" (1901) Category:Imperial Russian novelists Category:Imperial Russian male writers Category:Imperial Russian short story writers Category:Imperial Russian essayists Category:Male essayists Category:Imperial Russian engineers Category:Writers from Saint Petersburg Category:1852 births Category:1906 deaths Category:Russian male novelists Category:Russian male short story writers Category:19th-century Russian novelists Category:19th-century Russian short story writers Category:19th-century Russian male writers Category:19th-century essayists ",
