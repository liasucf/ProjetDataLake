One building is an elementary school, consisting of levels from pre-kindergarten to the fifth grade. The second building is a combination middle school and high school. The middle school is located on the second floor of the building and ranges from sixth grade to eighth grade. The high school, which teaches students from freshman year on, is on the first floor. ==Course Offerings== The high school offers many different subject courses and also \u201cfree\u201d electives. SEHS offers not only high school-level courses but a few college-level courses are also available, mainly through the Advanced Placement Program. AP courses that are offered include English Literature, Biology, Economics, Calculus, and American and European Histories. Sherburne-Earlville also offers certified college-level courses, such as Spanish and French IV, statistics, physics, and more through the TC3 concurrent enrollment program. In addition, when time allows, Sherburne-Earlville students may participate in classes and certain seminars at nearby Colgate University. ==Sports== The middle school and high school offer an array of different sports: Field hockey, soccer, swimming, baseball, softball, basketball, cross country, track and field, football, wrestling, volleyball, golf, indoor track, bowling, and cheerleading. The sports teams are known as the Sherburne-Earlville Marauders, and the mascot is a wolf. There are three different sports levels: modified, junior varsity, and varsity. The modified sports level consists of students who are in middle school, while junior varsity teams generally include freshmen and sophomores and varsity-level teams include mostly sophomores, juniors, and seniors. ==The arts== Sherburne-Earlville also houses a relatively strong arts department. The SE marching band hosts the annual Sherburne Pageant of the Bands, a prominent event featuring competitions in marching band, concert band, jazz ensemble, small ensemble, drum line and color guard. The competition attracts many surrounding high schools as well as out of state schools. The Sherburne Pageant of Bands is the largest and oldest high school band pageant in New York State. Several music electives are offered at the school, including music theory, concert band, and chorus. Many visual and digital arts courses are also available. Additionally, a substantial drama department, the \"Drama Club\" (often in correlation with the Sherburne Music Theatre Society) has developed extracurricularly. The school puts on an average of two shows each year (with a showcase of short one-act plays in the fall, and a longer, multi-act play in the spring), as well as an annual musical through the high school chorus. ==Odyssey of the Mind== One of Sherburne-Earlville's extracurricular strong points is its participation in the Odyssey of the Mind problem-solving program.
