A church at the site was present by the 11th century. It has undergone a cycle of damage and reconstruction until the 17th century, when it garnered Baroque elements and decoration. Between 1831 and 1862, the architect Giuseppe Bovara altered the facade and decoration to the Neoclassical tastes. The imposing, neo-gothic bell-tower was added in 1902\u20131904, designed by Giovanni Ceruti. The bell tower was erected at the site of one of the turrets in the medieval walls of the city, razed during the 19th century. The double staircase entrance was added in 1928. The interiors houses a number of frescoes including the Life of Jesus (1881) on the walls by Casimiro Radice and the Glory of the Madonna of the Rosary (1925) on the ceiling by Luigi Morgari.
