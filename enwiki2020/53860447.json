His brief reign is due to the fact that he was killed by his brother Leukon II who killed Spartokos after finding out that he was sleeping with his wife Alkathoe, who ending up killing Leukon later on in his reign. ==Sources== *French version of Wikipedia == References == ==External links== Collection of coins from the reign of Spartokos IV here Category:3rd-century BC rulers Category:Rulers of the Bosporan Kingdom ",
