He had eleven siblings \u2013 one of his sisters, Clermonde Rousseau (1674\u20131747) married Antoine Fazy (1681\u20131731), son of Daniel Fazy, a Huguenot refugee from Saint- V\u00e9ran, Queyras, who settled in Geneva and there set up the first Indian cotton factory in Europe. He married Suzanne Bernard (1673, Geneva \u2013 1712, Geneva) \u2013 she was the daughter of yet another clockmaker, Jacques Bernard. They had two sons, Fran\u00e7ois Rousseau and the writer and philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, though Suzanne died only nine days after Jean-Jacques's birth. An educated man and a patriot,Eug\u00e8ne Ritter, \"Isaac Rousseau, le p\u00e8re de Jean-Jacques\" , 1891 Isaac seems to have been very attached to his son and educated him himself until he was aged ten, though he became more distant in the years that followed. In 1722 he was almost imprisoned thanks to a quarrel and he went into exile from Geneva, leaving his son in the care of Isaac's brother-in-law Gabriel Bernard. Isaac settled in Nyon, slightly to the north-east of Geneva, and remarried. He then became one of the Genevan clockmakers who settled in the Ottoman Empire, where he was put in charge of regulating the pendulums in the Topkapi Palace \u2013 an important role, since these clocks regulated the exact time for Islamic prayers. Swiss clockmakers had been trading with the Ottomans via the French since the end of the 16th century, with a community in Galata, reserved for westerners since the time of Francis I of France. He was widowed again in the 1720s but he does not seem to have been overly worried by his eldest son Fran\u00e7ois Rousseau's flight from Geneva. Isaac and Jean-Jacques only met again four more times (July 1730, June 1732, July 1737 and September 1737, according to the Confessions), though Jean-Jacques still stated that he had been raised better than \"kings' children\".Annales de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Volume 39 \u2013 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jean-Jacques Rousseau -- Isaac Rousseau died in Nyon. == R\u00e9f\u00e9rences == Category:People from Geneva Category:1672 births Category:1747 deaths Category:18th century in Geneva Category:Clockmakers from the Republic of Geneva Category:Jean-Jacques Rousseau ",
