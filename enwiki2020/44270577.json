Hathian Railway station was established in 1886 by British government of India and was fully functional till 2000 but due to massive corruption and negligence in Gen Parvez Musharraf and successive governments in Pakistan it was defunct like most other railway stations. According to Khyber News report, besides criminal negligence of central government, local people have also contributed in the destruction of Railway track and facilities in the station thus causing it to grinding halt. PR losses reached around Rs 37 billion during 2017\u201318. This figure crossed Rs 40 billion by the end of year 2018. Besides the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has advised the Ministry of Railways to reduce its fiscal deficit so that it can rid itself of its dependency on federal government subsidies during negotiations for 6 billion dollar bailout package.
