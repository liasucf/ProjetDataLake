Ostensibly a tribute to Clifford Brown, the sextet date only has two songs actually played by Brown. No matter; it is for the Hubbard-Shaw matchup that this straight-ahead outing is mostly recommended, as the two trumpeters provide most of the fireworks\". == Track listing == All compositions by Benny Golson except where noted # \"I'll Remember April\" (Gene de Paul, Patricia Johnston and Don Raye) \u2013 8:00 # \"Time Speaks\" \u2013 10:27 # \"No Dancin'\" \u2013 7:01 # \"Jordu\" (Duke Jordan) \u2013 10:38 # \"Blues for Duane\" (Freddie Hubbard) \u2013 5:14 # \"Theme for Maxine\" (Woody Shaw) \u2013 8:18 == Personnel == *Benny Golson \u2013 tenor saxophone *Freddie Hubbard, Woody Shaw \u2013 trumpet *Kenny Barron \u2013 piano *Cecil McBee - bass *Ben Riley \u2013 drums ===Production=== *Makoto Kimata \u2013 producer *Rudy Van Gelder \u2013 engineer == References == Category:Benny Golson albums Category:Clifford Brown tribute albums Category:1983 albums Category:Baystate Records albums Category:Timeless Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio ",
