It is known by a number of common names, including common meadow violet, purple violet, the lesbian flower,https://www.bbg.org/news/weed_of_the_month_common_blue_violet woolly blue violet, hooded violet, and wood violet. Its cultivar 'Albiflora' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Self-seeding freely, in lawns and gardens it can be considered a weed by some. Cleistogamous seed heads may also appear on short stems in late summer and early autumn. ==Taxonomy== Hairless common blue violets with purple flowers and bearded spurred petals have been variously called Viola sororia, V. affinis, and V. pratincola. In the Chicago region, this hairless form is most frequently found in weedy areas such as old fields and lawns. Hairy purple violets with blue flowers have been called \"true\" Viola sororia and are rarely seen outside of remnant wooded areas. A form with white flowers that have a purple center has been called Viola sororia fo. priceana (Confederate violet). Viola sororia has several named hybrids: *Viola \u00d7 bernardii (Viola pedaifida var. pedatifida \u00d7 sororia) *Viola \u00d7 bissellii (Viola cucullata \u00d7 sororia) *Viola \u00d7 cordifolia (Viola hirsutula \u00d7 sororia) *Viola \u00d7 conjugens (Viola sagittata var. sagittata \u00d7 sororia) *Viola \u00d7 insolita (Viola pedatifida var. brittoniana \u00d7 sororia) ==Uses== Beyond its use as a common lawn and garden plant, Viola sororia has historically been used for food and for medicine. The flowers and leaves are edible, and some sources suggest the roots can also be eaten. The Cherokee used it to treat colds and headaches. Rafinesque, in his Medical Flora, a Manual of the Medical Botany of the United States of North America (1828 \u2013 1830), wrote of Viola sororia being used by his American contemporaries for coughs, sore throats, and constipation. The leaves are high in vitamins A and C and can be eaten raw. The flowers have been made into jelly and candy. ==Ecology== The caterpillars of fritillary butterflies feed on these plants. The plants also serve as food for wild turkeys, rabbits, deer, livestock, the mourning dove, the bobwhite, and the white-footed mouse. ==Cultural significance== It is the state flower of Illinois, Rhode Island, New Jersey, and Wisconsin.2003-04 Wisconsin Statutes & Annotations: 1.10 State song, state ballad, state waltz, state dance, and state symbols. ==Gallery== Common Blue Violet (Viola sororia var. sororia) - Flickr - Jay Sturner.jpg|Flower VioletAlba.jpg|White flowering form Viola sororia \"Freckles\" 2010.jpg|V. sororia 'Freckles' ==References== == Bibliography == * * * * Viola sororia from the Virginia Tech Weed Identification Guide * Duke, James. 1992.
