The leader of the Independence Party, Bjarni Benediktsson, expressed preference for a three-party coalition, although without saying which three parties. The Pirate Party proposed a five-party coalition with the Left-Green Movement, the Social Democrats, Bright Future and Reform, having previously ruled out working with either of the two outgoing coalition members. The Pirate Party then suggested a minority coalition of Left-Green Movement, Bright Future and Reform, with outside support from themselves and the Social Democrats, in order to simplify the process of government formation. The leader of Reform ruled out a right- leaning three-party coalition with the Independence Party and the Progressives, and did not rule out supporting the centre-left bloc. On 2 November, President Gu\u00f0ni Th. J\u00f3hannesson gave the mandate to Bjarni to form a majority government. On 11 November, the Independence Party, Reform and Bright Future entered into formal coalition talks, but the three parties failed to agree with a new market-based fishing quota system and an EU referendum as the main stumbling blocks. On 17 November, the mandate to form a majority government was in turn given to the leader of the Left-Greens, Katr\u00edn Jakobsd\u00f3ttir. She instigated talks with Reform, Bright Future, the Pirates, and Social Democrats, and on 19 November the five parties agreed to start formal coalition talks. On 24 November, the coalition talks fell through and Katr\u00edn formally renounced the Presidential mandate to form a government. On 2 December, the mandate to form a majority government was given to the leader of the Pirate Party, Birgitta J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir. The Pirates were unable to form a government and the President chose not to give a new mandate to form a government, but asked the party leaders to discuss the matter informally. On 2 January 2017, the Independence Party started official talks about a possible coalition deal with the Reform Party and Bright Future. Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0 also reported that the Left-Green Movement and the Progressive Party had also discussed possible coalition deals with the Independence Party. A new coalition was formed on 10 January 2017 between Independence Party, Reform Party and the Bright Future with Bjarni Benediktsson becoming Prime Minister on 11 January 2017. ==Footnotes== ==References== Category:2016 elections in Iceland Category:October 2016 events in Europe Category:Parliamentary elections in Iceland ",
