    "text": "Jonas Marcus von K\u00f6nigswarter (10 August 1807 \u2013 23 December 1871) was an Austrian Jewish banker and railway entrepreneur. He was a member of the K\u00f6nigswarter family. Born in Frankfurt shortly after the Napoleon invasion of Germany, Jonas von K\u00f6nigswarter decided to settle in Vienna, where he became the head of the banking-house founded by his uncle Hermann K\u00f6nigswarter, who had left no son. His business prospered; and the bank came to be ranked among the leading institutions of Austria. As a natural consequence, K\u00f6nigswarter was called upon to fill high public offices. In 1838 he became examiner of Austria's central bank Oesterreichische Nationalbank, and in 1850 director of that institution. Later he was elected to a directorship in the Oesterreichische Creditgesellschaft, the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway, the , and the , and he served as president of the last-named railroad for many years. He was also a member of the advisory committee of the Wiener B\u00f6rse, and president of the Jewish congregation of the city. In recognition of his public services, K\u00f6nigswarter was decorated with the Order of the Iron Crown of the third class, and elevated to an hereditary knighthood; and in 1870 he received the decoration of the second class of the same order, and was raised to the rank of a baron. K\u00f6nigswarter, however, rated far more highly than these distinctions the warm personal esteem with which Emperor Francis Joseph I regarded him. == References == Category:1807 births Category:1871 deaths Category:Austrian bankers Category:Austrian railway entrepreneurs Category:Austro-Hungarian Jews Category:19th-century Austrian businesspeople Category:Jewish bankers ",
