    "text": "The Richmond Transit Center is a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and Amtrak station located in Richmond, California. Richmond is the north terminus of BART service on the Berryessa/North San Jos\u00e9\u2013Richmond line and Richmond\u2013Daly City/Millbrae line; it is a stop for Amtrak's Capitol Corridor, San Joaquin, and California Zephyr routes. It is one of two transfer points between BART and Amtrak, along with Oakland Coliseum station. The Southern Pacific- controlled Northern Railway opened through what is now Richmond in 1878, but a station was not established until the arrival of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1900. The station was closed upon the formation of Amtrak in 1971. Two years later, Richmond became one of the termini of the initial BART system. Amtrak service began in 1978, with a shelter constructed in 1984. A new Amtrak platform was built in 2001, followed by a renovation of the whole station completed in 2007. ==History== ===Southern Pacific and Santa Fe railroads=== The former ATSF station in Richmond, photographed shortly before it was demolished in the 1990s The Southern Pacific-controlled Northern Railway opened through the then-uninhabited swamplands near Point Richmond on January 8, 1878. A stop was soon established at San Pablo, north of what is now Richmond. Passenger service to Richmond started around 1900 when the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (ATSF) made Port Richmond the west terminus of its transcontinental mainline, where passengers could board ferries to San Francisco. By 1910, the rapidly growing town of Richmond had four train stations: the Southern Pacific (SP) stopped in downtown Richmond near MacDonald Avenue and at Stege south of Potrero Avenue; the ATSF station was at the west end of MacDonald Avenue. Even as intercity rail service began to decline, Richmond was served by SP trains on the Shasta Route, Overland Route, and Central Valley routes, plus ATSF service to the Central Valley. ATSF service ended in 1968 when the Golden Gate was discontinued. SP service to Richmond on the San Joaquin Daylight continued until May 1, 1971, when Amtrak took over intercity passenger service. ===BART=== The BART station in 1976 As early as 1957, Richmond was identified as a likely terminus for a line of a proposed regional rapid transit system. The system was approved by voters in November 1962. The station was originally to be located at 6th and MacDonald west of downtown, but this was changed to 16th and Nevin (along the SP line) to allow construction of a storage yard north of the station and permit future extension. After tension between the Bay Area Rapid Transit District and the city, an agreement to use the latter site was reached in May 1967. BART service to Richmond began on January 29, 1973; it has remained a terminus since. An extension to Crockett was considered in 1991 but not pursued. A \"rather disquieting\" mosaic relief by William Mitchell, made of seashells and fiberglass, is located near the BART faregates. ===Intermodal station=== San Francisco Zephyr at the station in 1980 Capitol Corridor train at the station in 2018, with the former shelter at right Unlike other large cities, the Bay Area did not have a convenient transfer location between Amtrak intercity service and local rapid transit; Oakland Central Station was not located near a BART stop. The introduction of the San Joaquin service in 1974 added a third round trip to the SP mainline north of Oakland. The San Joaquin plus the long-distance San Francisco Zephyr and Coast Starlight began stopping at a small side platform near the BART station in late 1977 or early 1978. A station building with an elevator to the BART pedestrian access was built in 1984. Service gradually expanded; a second San Joaquin was added in 1980, and the Capitols service began in 1991. The Coast Starlight ceased to stop at Richmond in April 1996, followed by the California Zephyr (successor to the San Francisco Zephyr) in October 1998. The Amtrak station building was closed on December 1, 1997, though trains continued to stop. On April 12, 2000, BART and the city broke ground on a \"transit village\", a large mixed-use transit-oriented development adjacent to the station. In July 2001, the aging Amtrak facility was replaced with a modern island platform with better access to the BART pedestrian tunnel. The $1.9 million project, funded by the state, was intended to improve the station as preparation for the transit village. The developer for the transit village - which included an 800-space garage for BART - was chosen in 2002. A $6.4 million renovation of the station was undergone as part of the transit village project. An \"industrial post-modern\" circular canopy was built over the station entrance. The station was officially named the Richmond Transit Center at a dedication ceremony on October 18, 2007. A BART ticket window opened at the station in August 2008, joining seven other major stations in the system. The two intercity trains began stopping at Richmond again on November 8, 2010. However, the Coast Starlight stop was again discontinued on January 14, 2013 because the train was scheduled to arrive at night - if it was several hours late, passengers would be unable to exit through the locked BART tunnel. In 2018, BART and CCJPA installed a \"courtesy light\" on the Amtrak platform, which will instruct eastbound Capitol Corridor trains to hold for two minutes if a BART train is arriving to allow passengers to make their connection. ==Station layout== The BART station - a single island platform with two tracks - is located on the east side of the station complex. The Amtrak station - an island platform served by two of the three tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad Martinez Subdivision - is located to its west. An under-track pedestrian tunnel connects the two platforms with entrances on both sides of the tracks. The east side has a BART parking lot; the transit village, bus bays, and parking garage are located near the large canopy on the west side. ==Bus connections== Busway and drop-off area at the station Although Richmond is a terminal station for BART, most connecting regional bus services instead run to El Cerrito del Norte station, which is much closer to I-80. Richmond is served by several local bus services: *AC Transit: local routes 70, 71, 72M, 76, 376; all-night route 800; school routes 607, 668, 675, 684 *Richmond Medical Center: BART-Kaiser Shuttle *Richmond Circular Shuttle A Golden Gate Transit route over the Richmond\u2013San Rafael Bridge connecting Richmond to the agency's main service area in North Bay ran until 2015, when it was combined with a route that terminates at El Cerrito del Norte station. Richmond station is also served by Flixbus intercity buses. ==See also== *List of Bay Area Rapid Transit stations ==References== ===Notes=== ==External links== *BART - Richmond *Capitol Corridor - Richmond *Amtrak - Richmond *Richmond (RIC)--Great American Stations (Amtrak) Category:Amtrak stations in Contra Costa County, California Category:Bay Area Rapid Transit stations in Contra Costa County, California Category:Bus stations in Contra Costa County, California Category:Buildings and structures in Richmond, California Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1973 Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1978 Category:Transit centers in the United States Category:Former Southern Pacific Railroad stations ",
