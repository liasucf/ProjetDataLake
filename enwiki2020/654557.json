He is best known for his work the Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani, a collection of 52 episodic stories of a rogue, Abu al- Fath al-Iskandari, as recounted by a narrator, 'Isa b. Hisham. His Arabic name translates into \"The Wonder of the Age\". ==Life== Very little is known about Al-Hamadani\u2019s early life and primary sources are very limited. The main biographical account comes from the Persian scholar, ath-Thalibi, and most later biographies are derived from that.H\u00e4meen-Anttila, J., Maqama: A History of a Genre, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2002 , p 15 According to al-Hamadani\u2019s own account, he was of Arabic descent and his family had some education, but scholars have disputed these bare facts.H\u00e4meen-Anttila, J., Maqama: A History of a Genre, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2002 , pp 16-20 He claimed to be of Arabic descent, and traced his ancestry to the tribes of Taghlib and Mudar.In a letter to the vizier of Mahmud of Ghazni, Badi' al-Zaman traced his descent back to the tribes of Taghlib and Mudar: \"... \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0636\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0648\u0632\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f\u060c (\u0625\u0646\u064a \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u062e \u0648\u0627\u0633\u0645\u064a \u0623\u062d\u0645\u062f\u060c \u0648\u0647\u0645\u0630\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0644\u062f\u060c \u0648\u062a\u063a\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0631\u062f\u060c \u0648\u0645\u0636\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u062a\u062f\u060c) \u0648\u0643\u0623\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0625\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u0636\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u0644\u060c \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0623\u0633\u0631\u062a\u0647 \u0639\u0627\u0634\u062a \u0641\u064a \u062a\u063a\u0644\u0628. \u0648\u0641\u064a \u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064a\u062e \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u064a\u0639\u062a\u0630\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u062e\u0644\u0641 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0636\u0648\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0632\u0643\u0627\u0645\u060c \u0648\u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0639\u0646 \u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0623\u0633\u0645\u0647 \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u064a\u0638\u0647\u0631 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u0645\u0647 \u0633\u0642\u0637 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0644\u0629: (\u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0634\u062f \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0638\u0647\u0627\u0631\u064a \u0628\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0625\u0646 \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0648\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u064a\u0628\u0642\u064a\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0641\u0636\u0644) \u0641\u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0628.

More is known about Al-Hamadani\u2019s adult life. In 380/990, al-Hamadhani, then aged 22, left his native city and began travelling to the various centres of learning. At the time, scholarly travel was an accepted practice for young, educated Arabic men. His first stop was at Rayy, possibly to meet up with his former mentor, Ahmed Ibn Faris (ref: Prendergast gives the instructor\u2019s name as Abdul Husian ibn Faris; See https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.50447/page/n17). There he came under the patronage of Dihkhuda Abu Aid Muhammad ibn Mansur al-Isma (d. 410/1019). He next travelled to Jurjan where he began writing maqamat and where his literary talents found a receptive audience.H\u00e4meen-Anttila, J., Maqama: A History of a Genre, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2002 , pp 20-21; Prendergast, W.J., The Maqamat Of Badi Al Zaman Al-hamadhani, (1915), 1973, pp 3-4, https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.50447/page/n19 In 383/992, he travelled to Khorasan, Nishapur, then under Samanid rule, and an established centre of literature. His experience of Khorasan was mixed. He was robbed several times by highwaymen, losing all of his possessions. However, his literary output became more prolific. He was in competition with al- Khawrizmi and eventually fell out with him. In Nishapur, he achieved great fame and his reputation spread throughout the region.H\u00e4meen-Anttila, J., Maqama: A History of a Genre, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2002, pp 21-24; Prendergast, W.J., The Maqamat Of Badi Al Zaman al-Hamadhani, (1915), 1973, pp 5-6, https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.50447/page/n19 After Nishapur was conquered by the Ghaznavids he departed the region and returned to his travels. On the road, he stopped at Sarakhs, Tus and Marw. Some early sources, such as the Persian scholar, ath-Thalibi, suggest that Al-Hamadani also visited Sijistan and Ghazna. However, very little is known of such travels and reliable evidence is thin, leading scholars to caution that, as al-Hamadani\u2019s fame grew, such visits became the stuff of legend. Jaakko H\u00e4meen-Anttila, Maqama: A History of a Genre, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2002, pp 27-28 In 383/993, he stopped at Zaranj, where he was received at the court of the Saffarid ruler, Abu Ahmad Khalaf ibn Ahdmad. Al-Hamadani\u2019s intentions were to eulogise the ruler, for which he was well rewarded.H\u00e4meen-Anttila, J., Maqama: A History of a Genre, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2002 , pp 28-29 His movements, following his sojourn in Zaranj, are obscure. He eventually settled in Bushanj, near Herat where he married into the Abu-\u2018Ali Al-Husayn ibn Muhammad al-Khushnami, a local noble family and spent his final years . His literary output declined during his period of residency at Herat.

He died at Herat, at the age of forty. He was renowned for a remarkable memory and for fluency of speech, as well as for the purity of his language. His letters were first published at Constantinople (1881), and with commentary at Beirut (1890); his maqamas at Constantinople, and with commentary at Beirut (1889). Selected letters have been published in works, such as Silvestre de Sacy's edition of six of the maqamas with French translation and notes in his Chrestomathie arabe, vol. iii. (2nd ed., Paris, 1827). A specimen of the translated letters can be found A. von Kremers Culturgeschichte des Orients, ii. 470 sqq (in German). ==Literary work== Al-Hamadani wrote poetry and many of his letters have survived. He is generally regarded as the originator of the genre known as \u2018\u2019maqama\u201d(sing) or \u2018\u2019maqamat\u2019\u2019 (pl).Beeston, A.F.L., \u201cThe Genesis of the Maq\u0101m\u0101t Genre\u201d, Journal of Arabic Literature, Vol. 2, 1971, pp. 1-12, DOI:10.7813/jll.2014/5-1/5https://www.jstor.org/stable/4182866; Masarwah, N., \u201cThe Maqama as a Literary Genre\u201d, Journal of Language and Literature, 2014, Vol. 5, No. 1, pp 28-32; Nicholson, R., A Literary History of the Arabs, Project Gutenberg edition, 2011, pp 329-30 https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37985/37985-h/37985-h.htm#Page_329 Al- Hamadani\u2019s maqama made use of anecdotes collected in the 9th century by earlier writers, such as al-Jahiz and al-Taniikhi, but had a narrator introduce the anecdote.Ozaki, K., \u201dMaqama as a Courtroom Play- Disguised Hero, Duped Judge\u201d, Orient, Vol. XVll 2007, p. 128 Al-Hamadani\u2019s innovation was to apply saj' (an ornate form of rhymed prose), to the retelling of secular anecdotes.Roxburgh, D., \u201cIn Pursuit of Shadows: Al-Hariri\u2019s Maqamat,\u201d Muqarnas, vol. 30, 2013, p. 178, https://www.jstor.org/stable/42751920 Until that time, saj\u2019 had been confined to religious and political works.Beeston, A.F.L., \u201cAl-Hamadhani, al-Hariri and the maqamat Genre\u201d in: Julia Ashtiany, Gerald Rex Smith, T.

Scheindlin and Michael Sells, Abbasid Belles Lettres, Cambridge University Press, 1990, pp 126-127 A total of 52 of al-Hamadani\u2019s maqama have been preserved in manuscripts. Each maqama is a complete story, but maqama are often presented in a collection with an overarching theme. Each story has two main characters, the narrator, (usually Isa ibn Hisham) and a protagonist, (usually Abu I-Fath of Alexandria, who is a rogue and a trickster). Other characters, often historical characters, are introduced in different stories. The anecdotes, presented in al-Hamadani\u2019s maqamat played into a growing interest in the activities of Arabic low-life, especially beggars, tricksters and criminals.Prendergast, W.J., The Maqamat Of Badi Al Zaman Al-hamadhani, (1915), 1973, p. vii https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.50447/page/n9 The maqama follows a loose structure of seven parts, namely (1) Isnad, (2) general introduction, (3) link (4) episode (the core of the narrative), (5) recognition scene, (6) envoi and (7) finale. Jaakko H\u00e4meen-Anttila, Maqama: A History of a Genre, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2002, pp 45-50 Stylistically, maqama employ Saj', a highly polished and elaborate prose. Parts of the narrative may be written in verse, while other parts are written in unrhymed, literary prose. Most of the verse used by al-Hamadhani was borrowed from notable poets.
