She began her studies at the college as a member of their Junior Department, during which time she was also a member of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain and won the 2013 BBC Proms Inspire Young Composer Competition for her piece Convergence, for which she has since become an ambassador. She subsequently studied at Somerville College, Oxford. In 2017, whilst still an undergraduate, she was co-commissioned by BBC Radio 4's Front Row programme and The Proms to compose her work entitled River, which was written to celebrate the 300th anniversary of George Frideric Handel's Water Music. The piece was premiered live on BBC Radio 4 from a stationary boat on the River Thames by London Early Opera, imitating the premiere performance of Water Music 300 years previously. River was subsequently performed at the Proms by Royal Northern Sinfonia under Nicholas McGegan in Kingston upon Hull, which was the first time the Proms had included a concert outside London since 1930. In 2018, the piece received its United States premiere at the Norfolk Chamber Music Festival by the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra. In November 2017, the BBC Philharmonic performed her orchestral work Kintsukuroi: (Golden Repair), conducted by Mark Heron, in a special joint concert with Psappha New Music Ensemble for BBC Radio 3 broadcast as part of the biennial New Music North West Festival. Mason is the recipient of prizes and awards such as the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic's Christopher Brooks Prize 2017 and the prestigious Royal Philharmonic Society Composition Prize 2018. Her debut chamber opera in one act entitled The Yellow Wallpaper, for which Mason wrote the libretto based on the short story of the same name by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, was produced by the Helios Collective to receive its premiere performance at the English National Opera's Lilian Baylis House in 2016. Mason's music has been included in events and festivals such as BBC Radio 3's Young Artist Day, in which her work \"Diamond Dust II\" for Clarinet in Bb and Piano was broadcast live, her setting of Psalm 93, \"The Lord Is\", was premiered in the London Festival of Contemporary Church Music 2017 by the Sarum Consort, and in the Open Circuit Festival 2016 in which her piece \"Let The Rain Kiss You\", inspired by the poem \"April Rain Song\", by Langston Hughes was performed by trombonist, John Kenny. Her music has been performed by members of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Aurora Orchestra, and Ensemble 10/10. In 2017, Mason was selected to write her orchestral piece Beneath the Silken Silence for the London Symphony Orchestra as part of their Panufnik Composer's Scheme, she was then subsequently commissioned to write her work 'FAFAIA' (2018) for their Community Choir. She was named in The Times 2020 Calendar of the Arts as the classical music 'Face To Watch.' ==Selected works== ===Orchestral works=== *Fireworks (2018) \u2013 for soprano voice and orchestra *beneath the silken silence (2018) \u2013 for orchestra *Abloom: Where Quiet Falls Asleep (2017) \u2013 for orchestra *Kintsukuroi: (Golden Repair) (2016) \u2013 for orchestra ===Solo/chamber works=== *Midnight Spires (2019) \u2013 for string quartet *Into The Abyss, I Throw Roses (2018) \u2013 for string trio *Upon Weightless Wings (2018) \u2013 for large chamber ensemble *River (2017) \u2013 for baroque chamber orchestra *Pale Fires (2017) \u2013 for large chamber ensemble *Night and Sleep II (2017) \u2013 for flute, clarinet in Bb, piano, vibraphone, violin and violoncello *Amongst The Cinders (2017) \u2013 for soprano saxophone and piano *Diamond Dust II (2015) \u2013 for clarinet in Bb and piano *Let The Rain Kiss You (2015) \u2013 for solo trombone and electronics ===Vocal works=== *The Rosy Hearth (2016) \u2013 for tenor voice and piano *Convergence (2013) \u2013 for soprano voice, violin and violoncello ===Choral works=== *A Song of Christ's Glory (2019) \u2013 for SATB choir *Fafaia (2018) \u2013 for SATB choir and piano *Tenebrae factae sunt (2018) \u2013 for SATB choir *The Lord Is (2015) \u2013 for SATB choir *Faint Flight (2014) \u2013 for SATB choir ===Opera=== *The Yellow Wallpaper (2016) \u2013 chamber opera in one act == References == ==External links== *Official Website *Grace-Evangeline Mason on Soundcloud Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Somerville College, Oxford Category:British classical composers Category:20th-century classical composers Category:Female classical composers Category:English composers Category:Female opera composers Category:English opera composers Category:20th-century British composers Category:20th-century English women musicians Category:British female composers Category:Alumni of the Royal Northern College of Music Category:21st-century English women musicians Category:People from Wolverhampton Category:20th-century women composers ",
