In April 2010, the company sold $48 million in stock for $3 per share, and a short time later was accused of fraud in a class action suit filed by a Michigan retirement fund, which claimed The Princeton Review leadership exaggerated earnings to boost its stock price. In 2012, the company was acquired by Charlesbank Capital, a private equity fund, for $33 million.

Princeton Review officials counter that their rankings are unique in that they rely on student opinion and not just on statistical data. In 2002 an American Medical Association affiliated program, A Matter of Degree,A Matter of Degree: Reducing High-Risk Drinking Among College Students(pdf), Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, March 23, 200 funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, criticized the Princeton Review list of Best Party Schools.End of Top Party School's Ranking?. The Early Show. CBS News. August 27, 2002. Retrieved on October 30, 2009. USA Today published an editorial titled \"Sobering Statistics\"USA TODAY OPED Staff,\"Sobering Statistics\", USA Today, Aug. 20, 2002 in August 2002 and stated, \"the doctor's group goes too far in suggesting that the rankings contribute to the problem (of campus drinking).\" The editorial noted the fact that among the schools the AMA program was then funding as part of its campaign against campus drinking, six of 10 of those schools calling for The Princeton Review to \"drop the annual ranking...had made (Princeton Review's) past top-party-school lists: many times for some. That's no coincidence.\" The editorial commended The Princeton Review for reporting the list, calling it \"a public service\" for \"student applicants and their parents\". Rankings for LGBT-related lists have also been criticized as inaccurate due to outdated methodologies. The Princeton Review bases its LGBT- Friendly and LGBT-Unfriendly top twenty ranking lists, which asks undergraduates: \"Do students, faculty, and administrators at your college treat all persons equally regardless of their sexual orientations and gender identify/expression?\" The Princeton Review also publishes The Gay & Lesbian Guide to College Life.Guide to College for LGBT Students.

That information can be used to 'send you email notices and offers; perform research and analysis about your use of or interest in our products, services or products or services offered by others; [and] develop and display content and advertising tailored to your interests on our site and other sites.'\" ==See also== *Storefront school ==References== == External links == * Category:Educational publishing companies Category:Test preparation companies Category:Standardized tests in the United States Category:Companies based in Natick, Massachusetts Category:Princeton, Massachusetts Category:American companies established in 1981 Category:Consulting firms established in 1981 Category:Publishing companies established in 1981 Category:1981 establishments in New York (state) ",
