Originally constructed in 1967 as the Security Life Building - it has since been converted into a multi-tenant luxury apartment complex. On the top floor of this building many years ago; there was a restaurant called \"TOP OF THE ROCKIES\". The exterior of the building used to hold a separate elevator shaft for a glass elevator (SEE CURRENT PHOTO WHERE THIS BUMP STICKS OUT FROM THE STRUCTURE WITH THE NUMBER 1600 ON IT). The glass elevator was an express elevator that served the restaurant. The restaurant has been gone for many years. After operating for many years as an office building; times were about to change. In 2006, The Security Life Building underwent a major conversion from office to residential use. 1600 Glenarm Place is in the heart of Downtown Denver.
