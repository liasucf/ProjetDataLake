    "text": "School Captain or School Pupil Leader is a student appointed or elected to lead the student body of a school. School captains are mainly found in British Empire legacy school systems: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, India and Zimbabwe. In coeducational schools, there is usually a girl and boy school captain. The role is similar to \"Student Body President\" in the United States, with the captain being the senior representative of the students and the school in the wider community. In the past, school captains were almost always appointed by the administration of the school, but there has been an increasing tendency for them to be chosen by the student body. In some cases, teachers reserve the right to make the final decision, because of concern that if the student vote is seen as a popularity contest, the person chosen might not represent the school successfully or appropriately. ==References== Category:School terminology ",
