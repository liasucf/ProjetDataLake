With there being 31 teams for this edition, only one 1st Round pool played with the 3 lowest ranked teams (according to the CEV U20 Men European Ranking List), where the 1st and 2nd placed teams qualified to the 2nd Round. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- |width=10px bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"| ||Qualified for Second round |} All times are local. *Venue: National Volleyball Centre, Kettering, England |} |} ==Second round== 28 teams competed in seven 2nd Round tournaments consisting of 4 teams. These took place between 25 \u2013 27 April 2014. The 1st placed teams of each pool qualified directly for the Final Round. The 2nd placed teams of each Pool as well as the 3rd placed team with the best score among the 2nd Round Pools qualified for the 3rd Round. Following Ukraine's withdrawal from the competition, Pool B featured only three teams. As a result, in order to determine the third placed team with the best score among the 2nd Round Pools, the result of all the matches played with the last placed team wouldn't be taken into account in pools with four participants. This means an updated final standing will be calculated accordingly so that the comparison among all third placed teams was done counting the same number of matches. *Pools composition {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=150|Pool A !width=150|Pool B !width=150|Pool C !width=150|Pool D !width=150|Pool E !width=150|Pool F !width=150|Pool G |- | | | | | | | |- | | | | | | | |- | | | | | | | |- | | | | | | | |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\" |- |width=10px bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"| ||Qualified for 2014 European Championship |- |width=10px bgcolor=\"#fffccc\"| ||Qualified to Third round |} All times are local. ===Pool A=== *Venue: Audentes Sports Hall, Tallinn, Estonia |} |} ===Pool B=== *Venue: Pala Principi, Porto Potenza Picena, Italy |} |} ===Pool C=== *Venue: Sala Polivalenta, Piatra Neamt, Romania |} |} ===Pool D=== *Venue: Duna\u00fajv\u00e1rosi Sportcsarnok, Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros, Hungary |} |} ===Pool E=== *Venue: Pavilhao do, Castelo da Maia, Portugal |} |} ===Pool F=== *Venue: Hristo Botev, Sofia, Bulgaria |} |} ===Pool G=== *Venue: TVF SC Baskent Sports Hall, Ankara, Turkey |} |} ===Ranking of the third placed teams=== |} ==Third round== The 3rd Round consisted of 2 tournaments of 4 teams and took place between 11 \u2013 13 July 2014.
