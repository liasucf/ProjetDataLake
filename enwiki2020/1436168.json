Four of her siblings had been born in Bermuda: Albert Albouy Outerbridge (1841-); Sir Joseph Outerbridge (1843-1933); August Emelius Outerbridge (1846\u2013January 14, 1921); Catherine Tucker Outerbridge (1846-).

One of the Major's men brought the rules for the game and the equipment with him when he was posted to the Bermuda Garrison in 1874. Mary played the game at \"Clermont\", her family's house with a large flat lawn in Paget parish in Bermuda. In 1874 Mary returned from Bermuda aboard the ship \"S.S. Canima.\" The sporting equipment was originally confiscated by customs officials, but then her brother managed to have the supplies released. She introduced lawn tennis to the United States. She set up the first tennis court in the United States on the grounds of the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club, which was near where the Staten Island Ferry Terminal is today. The club was founded on or about March 22, 1872. She played the first tennis game in the US against her sister Laura in Staten Island, New York, on an hourglass-shaped court. In September 1880 the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club held \"the tournament for the championship of America\". The match was won by O. E. Woodhouse of England who was in New York at the time. Woodhouse defeated I. F. Hellmuth in the championship finals. Several other clubs held similar tournaments in the same year. In the same year tennis was also introduced in Arizona. ==Home life== In 1880 Mary and her parents were living in the Castleton area of Staten Island, New York City and her father was working as a clerk, as was her brother, Adolph. The family had two servants.Outerbridges in the 1880 US Census for Staten Island ==Death and burial== She died in 1886 at age 34 in the New Brighton section of Staten Island and was buried in Silver Mount Cemetery, Staten Island, next to her parents. ==Legacy== Mary Outerbridge was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1981.
