    "text": "Cary was a community, now extinct, in Harrison Township, Miami County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. ==History== Cary was home to a society of both Wesleyan Methodists and Quakers. The Pan Handle Railroad being built a mile away from the community and the founding of the nearby town of Amboy led to Cary becoming a ghost town. A post office was established at Cary in 1858, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1868. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Geography of Miami County, Indiana Category:Former populated places in Indiana Category:Ghost towns in Indiana ",
