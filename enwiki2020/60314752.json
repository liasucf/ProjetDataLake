    "text": "The 2020 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2019\u201320 season. The playoffs were originally scheduled to begin on April 18. However, the league suspended the season on March 11, 2020, hours after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and after some players tested positive for the virus. On June 4, the NBA Board of Governors approved a plan to restart the season on July 31 in the NBA Bubble. This proposal was then approved by members of the National Basketball Players Association on June 5. Under this plan, the 22 top teams in the league at the time of the suspension played eight additional regular season games to determine playoff seeding, with 16 of those teams playing in a conventional postseason tournament. If the ninth seed within a conference would have finished the regular season within four games of the eighth seed, they would have then competed in a play-in series. The last time a play-in game was played to determine a playoff spot was in 1956. As part of the bubble, all playoff games were held at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex inside Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida. All three games that were scheduled to take place on August 26 were postponed by a wildcat strike,NBA season is suddenly on the brink NBC SportsNBA Teams Are On Strike Over Police Brutality New York (magazine) in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, with the Milwaukee Bucks being the first team not to take the court prior to their game five matchup against the Orlando Magic. The games on August 27 and 28 were also postponed, with games resuming on August 29. The Toronto Raptors were defending champions, but lost in the Eastern Conference Semifinals round to the Boston Celtics. None of the teams that made it to the Conference Finals in the 2019 NBA playoffs made the Conference Finals in 2020. ==Overview== *The Houston Rockets entered their eighth consecutive postseason. *The Portland Trail Blazers entered their seventh consecutive postseason. *The Toronto Raptors entered their seventh consecutive postseason. *The Boston Celtics entered their sixth consecutive postseason. *The Milwaukee Bucks entered their fourth consecutive postseason. *The Los Angeles Lakers made the playoffs for the first time in seven years. *The Dallas Mavericks made the playoffs for the first time in four years. *The Golden State Warriors missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years. *The San Antonio Spurs missed the playoffs for the first time in twenty-three years. This is only the fifth time since the merger that the Spurs missed the playoffs. With their 22-year playoff streak snapped, the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League now own the longest active playoff streak in any of the four major North American sports leagues. *This is the first time since 1997 that a team from the Western Conference with a losing record, Portland, qualified for the playoffs. *This is the first time since 2003 that both No. 1 seeds (the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers) from each conference lost their opening game of the playoffs. *LeBron James is the first player with 20+ points, 15+ rebounds, 15+ assists in an NBA playoff game. *The Boston Celtics swept the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, marking the 44th straight year a sweep occurred in the NBA playoffs. The last year a sweep did not occur in the playoffs was 1976. *The Toronto Raptors swept the Brooklyn Nets, making it their first series sweep in franchise history, leaving the Los Angeles Clippers and the Minnesota Timberwolves as the only two teams remaining that have never swept a series in the playoffs. *Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray joined Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson as the only players to have multiple 50-point games in a single playoff series. *This is the first time in NBA playoff history that two players on opposing teams (Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz and Jamal Murray of the Denver Nuggets) have tallied 50+ points in the same game. *Luka Don\u010di\u0107 joined Charles Barkley and Oscar Robertson as the only players with 40+ points, 15+ rebounds, 10+ assists in an NBA playoff game. *Luka Don\u010di\u0107 joined Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, and Damian Lillard as the only players to score 40+ points and hit a buzzer-beater in a playoff game. *The Milwaukee Bucks are the first team in the playoffs to refuse to play a game over racial injustice in the wake of the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The players described their actions as a \"boycott\", although commentators have pointed out that the event was a strike. It is the first time an NBA team refused to play a game since the Boston Celtics protested for racial justice in 1961. *Kawhi Leonard is the first player to have 30+ points, 10+ rebounds, 5+ assists and 5+ steals in a playoff game since Gary Payton in 2000. *The Nuggets-Jazz series was the first of the 2020 playoffs to have a Game 7, making it the 21st consecutive NBA postseason with a Game 7. The last time a Game 7 did not take place in the playoffs was 1999. *Jamal Murray is the first player to have three straight playoff games with 40+ points since Allen Iverson in 2001. *The Denver Nuggets became just the 12th team in NBA history to come back from a 3\u20131 series deficit, when they defeated the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference first round. They were the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 series deficit since the Cleveland Cavaliers did so in the 2016 NBA Finals. *Game 2 between the Miami Heat and Milwaukee Bucks was the first playoff game since Game 1 of the 1979 NBA Finals to be decided by free throws with time expired. *This is the first time that the top two seeds (the Milwaukee Bucks and the Toronto Raptors) are both down 0\u20132 in a best of 7 series. *Luguentz Dort became the youngest player and first undrafted player to score 30+ points in a Game 7. *This is the first time since 2013 that the fifth seed (Miami Heat) beat the first seed (Milwaukee Bucks) 4\u20131 in the Conference semifinals. *Despite all the games being in the same location, the Celtics-Raptors series was the first series in NBA history where the (designated) road team won every game of a best-of-seven series. The only other time when this had happened in major North American sports leagues history was the 2019 World Series. *This is the first time that neither the first seed nor the second seed are in the Eastern Conference Finals. *This is the first time that an NBA team (Denver Nuggets) overcame a 3\u20131 deficit twice in the same playoffs. *Tyler Herro set the NBA rookie Conference Finals scoring record by scoring a career-high 37 points off the bench in game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics. The record was previously held by Andrew Toney who scored 35 in 1981. Herro's 37 points are the second-most ever scored by a player aged 20 or younger in a playoff game, only behind Magic Johnson's 42 points back in 1980. *The Miami Heat became the first 5th seed or lower team to advance to the NBA Finals since the New York Knicks in 1999. *This is the first time that both teams in the NBA Finals failed to make the playoffs in the previous season. *Andre Iguodala reached the NBA Finals for the sixth consecutive year, joining LeBron James and James Jones as the only players to do so with two different teams. *Before this season, the last time the Heat reached the NBA Finals was in , after which LeBron James ended a four-year stint with the team. James is the second player (after Wilt Chamberlain in ) to win MVP with a franchise before later playing against that franchise in the Finals. James is the first Finals MVP to play their previous franchise in the Finals. *Anthony Davis joined Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan, Rick Barry, and Hal Greer as the only players in NBA History to score 30+ points in their first two career NBA Finals games. *Tyler Herro became the youngest player to start an NBA Finals game at 20 years, 256 days during the Game 2 of the 2020 NBA Finals on October 2, 2020. He was eight days younger than Magic Johnson was when he started Game 1 for the Lakers in 1980. *Jimmy Butler became the 3rd player in NBA History to record a 40+ point triple-double in the NBA Finals, joining LeBron James in 2015 and Jerry West in 1969. At the end of Game 3 of NBA Finals series, Butler also became the first player (opponent or teammate) to out-score/-rebound/-assist/ LeBron James in a Finals game. *LeBron James became the first NBA player to win the Finals MVP with three different teams. ==Format== After the NBA suspended its season on March 11, 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the league started to explore implementing a special postseason format just for this year. On June 4, the NBA Board of Governors approved a plan to restart the season on July 31 in the NBA Bubble, with 22 of the 30 teams in the league, all clubs within six games of a playoff spot. Under this plan, the 22 teams will play eight regular-season \"seeding\" games. A possible best-of-three play-in series for the final seed in each conference would then be held if the ninth seed finishes the regular season within four games of the eighth seed. The eighth seed would start with a de facto 1\u20130 lead, meaning that it would need just one win to advance, while the ninth seed would need two. The NBA's regular playoff format would then proceed as normal. All games would be played behind closed doors at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Walt Disney World. Under the NBA's regular playoff format, the eight teams with the most wins in each conference qualify for the playoffs. The seedings are based on each team's record. Each conference's bracket is fixed; there is no reseeding. All rounds are best-of-seven series; the series ends when one team wins four games, and that team advances to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, are in a 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format. In the conference playoffs, home court advantage goes to the higher-seeded team (number one being the highest). Seeding is based on each team's regular season record within a conference; if two teams have the same record, standard tiebreaker rules are used. Conference seedings are ignored for the NBA Finals: Home court advantage goes to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties are broken based on head to head record, followed by intra-conference record. ==Playoff qualifying== On February 23, 2020, the Milwaukee Bucks became the first team to clinch a playoff spot. The Toronto Raptors, Los Angeles Lakers, and Boston Celtics subsequently clinched playoff berths before the season was suspended on March 11. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ffff99\" width=\"20\" | \u2020 | Denotes team that clinched a playoff berth prior to the March 11 suspension of the season |- | align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#d9e9f9\" width=\"20\" | * | Denotes team that automatically clinched a playoff berth or a division title on the June approval of the 22-team plan to resume the season |} ===Eastern Conference=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=2|Seed !!rowspan=2|Team !!rowspan=2|Record !!colspan=4|Clinched |- !Playoff berth !!
