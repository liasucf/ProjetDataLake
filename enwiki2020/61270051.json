    "text": "Tetris is a puzzle video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System released in 1989. It was the first official console release of Tetris which was developed and published by Nintendo. == Development == By 1989, half a dozen different companies claimed rights to create and distribute the Tetris software for home computers, game consoles and handheld systems. ELORG, the Soviet bureau that held the ultimate copyright, meanwhile, held that none of the companies was legally entitled to produce an arcade version, and signed those rights over to Atari Games, while it signed non-Japanese console and handheld rights over to Nintendo. Tetris was on show at the January 1988 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where it was picked up by Dutch-born American games publisher Henk Rogers, then based in Japan, which eventually led to an agreement brokered with Nintendo that saw Tetris bundled with every Game Boy.The Guardian, June 2, 2009, How Tetris conquered the world, block by block The Nintendo home release was developed by Gunpei Yokoi. == Classic Tetris World Championship == The NES version of Tetris has seen an increase in popularity in recent years due to the Classic Tetris World Championship held every year. The competition uses the NES version of Tetris where players complete in a 1-on-1 competition to score the most points and win. The popularity of the tournament has resulted in an increase in sales of this version of Tetris on online sellers. ==Music== The NES version has different music from the popular Game Boy version. For example, the default track is \"The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" from Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker instead of the Russian folk song \"Korobeiniki\", which has become strongly associated with Tetris from its use in the Game Boy version. == Reception == The NES version sold 8 million copies worldwide. == References == Category:1989 video games Category:1990 video games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo games Category:Tetris Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games scored by Hirokazu Tanaka ",
