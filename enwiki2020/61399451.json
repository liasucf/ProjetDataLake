    "text": "The 1955 season was Cherno More's fourth successive season in the Republican Football Group A. The club competed as VMS Stalin after Varna was renamed after the Soviet dictator in December 1949.https://web.archive.org/web/20110518183425/http://varna.info.bg/english/name_of_varna_en.htm ==Overview== The season lives in infamy as Cherno More started with five successive wins against the traditionally strong Sofia teams but ended in relegation on goal difference. After the flying start there was great enthusiasm in the club and talk of becoming champions. According to Vasil Dossev, who scored the winning goal against Dinamo in Sofia, he tried to cool it down, insisting the team should focus on gaining enough points to avoid relegation. He was removed from his position as captain of the team for his defeatist attitude.http://www.retro- football.bg/sites/default/files/books/futbolna_varna.pdf p.78-79 With relegation looming in October, Cherno More recorded the club's joint- record win in the top flight by thrashing Cherveno Zname Pavlikeni 8-0 in the penultimate game of the season. This was followed by an away win against Spartak in Plovdiv, allowing the team to move four points clear of Zavod 12, who had two games in hand. Zavod 12 defeated Lokomotiv Plovdiv 2-0 and Spartak Plovdiv 2-1 in matches played long after Cherno More's season has ended. Both teams gained 25 points, with Zavod 12's goal difference 26-27 and Cherno More's 26-28, resulting in the relegation of the Varna team from the league. ==Republican Football Group A== ===Matches=== https://bulgarian- football.com/archive/1955/a-grupa.html *Varna was renamed Stalin after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin from 20 December 1949 to 20 October 1956; * Pernik was renamed Dimitrovo after Bulgarian Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov from 1949 to 1962; * CDNA Sofia is a former name of CSKA Sofia; *Dinamo Sofia is a former name of Levski Sofia; *Udarnik Sofia is a former name of Slavia Sofia; *DNA Plovdiv is a former name of Botev Plovdiv. ===League standings=== ===Results summary=== ==Soviet Army Cup== https://bulgarian- football.com/archive/1955/kupa-na-savetskata-armia.html ==References== ==External links== http://www.retro-football.bg/?q=bg/1954 https://bulgarian-football.com/archive/1955/a-grupa.html Category:PFC Cherno More Varna seasons Cherno More Varna Cherno More Varna ",
