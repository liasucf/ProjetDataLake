She is a celebrated Bhakti saint, particularly in the North Indian Hindu tradition.Karen Pechelis (2004), The Graceful Guru, Oxford University Press, , pages 21-23, 29-30Neeti Sadarangani (2004), Bhakti Poetry in Medieval India: Its Inception, Cultural Encounter and Impact, Sarup & Sons, , pages 76-80 Mirabai was born into a Rajput royal family in Kudki, Pali district, Rajasthan, Mira then spent her childhood in Merta, Rajasthan. She is mentioned in Bhaktamal, confirming that she was widely known and a cherished figure in the Bhakti movement culture by about 1600 CE.Catherine Asher and Cynthia Talbot (2006), India before Europe, Cambridge University Press, , page 109 Most legends about Meera mention her fearless disregard for social and family conventions, her devotion to Lord Krishna, her treating Lord Krishna as her husband and being persecuted by her in-laws for her religious devotion. She has been the subject of numerous folk tales and hagiographic legends, which are inconsistent or widely different in details.Nancy Martin-Kershaw (2014), Faces of the Feminine in Ancient, Medieval, and Modern India (Editor: Mandakranta Bose), Oxford University Press, , pages 162-178 Millions of devotional hymns in passionate praise of Lord Krishna are attributed to Meerabai in the Indian tradition, but just a few hundred are believed to be authentic by scholars, and the earliest written records suggest that except for two hymns, most were written down only in the 18th century.John Stratton Hawley (2002), Asceticism (Editors: Vincent Wimbush, Richard Valantasi), Oxford University Press, , pages 301-302 Many poems attributed to Meera were likely composed later by others who admired Meera. These hymns are commonly known as bhajans, and are popular across India.Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, , page 254 Hindu temples, such as in Chittorgarh fort, are dedicated to Mira Bai's memory. Legends about Meera's life, of contested authenticity, have been the subject of movies, comic strips and other popular literature in modern times.Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, , page 242 ==Biography== Meera's temple to Krishna at Chittor Fort, Rajasthan Authentic records about Meera are not available, and scholars have attempted to establish Meera's biography from secondary literature that mention her, and wherein dates and other moments. Meera unwillingly married Bhoj Raj, the crown prince of Mewar, in 1516.Usha Nilsson (1997), Mira bai, Sahitya Akademi, , pages 12-13Nancy Martin-Kershaw (2014), Faces of the Feminine in Ancient, Medieval, and Modern India (Editor: Mandakranta Bose), Oxford University Press, , page 165 Her husband was wounded in one of the ongoing wars with the Delhi Sultanate in 1518, and he died of battle wounds in 1521. Both her father and father-in-law (Rana Sanga) died a few days after the battle of Khanwa in exile as they had vowed not to return to Mewar until they had defeated Babur. After the death of her father-in-law Rana Sanga, Vikram Singh became the ruler of Mewar. According to a popular legend, her in-laws tried many times to execute her, such as sending Meera a glass of poison and telling her it was nectar or sending her a basket with a snake instead of flowers. According to the hagiographic legends, she was not harmed in either case, with the snake miraculously becoming a Krishna idol (or a garland of flowers depending on the version). In another version of these legends, she is asked by Vikram Singh to go drown herself, which she tries but she finds herself floating on water.Usha Nilsson (1997), Mira bai, Sahitya Akademi, , pages 16-17 Yet another legend states that the Mughal emperor Akbar came with Tansen to visit Meera and presented a pearl necklace, but scholars doubt this ever happened because Tansen joined Akbar's court in 1562, 15 years after she died. Similarly, some stories state that Guru Ravidas was her guru (teacher), but there is no corroborating historical evidence for this. Some versions suggest this could likely have happened. Others disagree. The three different oldest records known as of 2014 that mention Meera,These are Munhata Nainsi's Khyat from Jodhpur, Prem Ambodh from Amritsar and Nabhadas's Chappay from Varanasi; see: JS Hawley and GS Mann (2014), Culture and Circulation: Literature in Motion in Early Modern India (Editors: Thomas De Bruijn and Allison Busch), Brill Academic, , pages 131-135 all from the 17th century and written within 150 years of Meera's death, neither mention anything about her childhood or circumstances of her marriage to Bhojraj, nor do they mention that the people who persecuted her were her in-laws or from some Rajput royal family.JS Hawley and GS Mann (2014), Culture and Circulation: Literature in Motion in Early Modern India (Editors: Thomas De Bruijn and Allison Busch), Brill Academic, , pages 131-135 Nancy Martin-Kershaw states that to the extent Meera was challenged and persecuted, religious or social conventions were unlikely to have been the cause, rather the likely cause were political chaos and military conflicts between the Rajput kingdom and the Mughal Empire. Other stories state that Mira Bai left the kingdom of Mewar and went on pilgrimages. In her last years, Meera lived in Dwarka or Vrindavan, where legends state she miraculously disappeared by merging into an idol of Krishna in 1547. While miracles are contested by scholars for the lack of historical evidence, it is widely acknowledged that Meera dedicated her life to Hindu deity Krishna, composing songs of devotion and was one of the most important poet-saint of the Bhakti movement period.John S Hawley (2005), Three Bhakti Voices: Mirabai, Surdas and Kabir in Their Times and Ours, Oxford University Press, , pages 128-130 ==Poetry== Most of Meera's poems are dedicated to God in the form of Krishna (left), calling him the Dark One or the Mountain Lifter. Some Meera songs include Radha (right), the lover of Krishna. All her poems have philosophical connotations.Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, , page 244 A number of compositions by Meera Bai continue to be sung today in India, mostly as devotional songs (bhajans) though nearly all of them have a philosophical connotation. One of her most popular compositions remains \"Paayoji maine Ram Ratan dhan paayo\" (\u092a\u093e\u092f\u094b \u091c\u0940 \u092e\u0948\u0902\u0928\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u092e \u0930\u0924\u0928 \u0927\u0928 \u092a\u093e\u092f\u094b\u0964, \"I have been given the richness of Lord Ram's blessing\"). Meera's poems are lyrical padas (metric verses) in Rajasthani language. While thousands of verses are attributed to her, scholars are divided in their opinion as to how many of them were actually penned by Meera herself. There are no surviving manuscripts of her poetry from her time, and the earliest records with two poems credited to her are from early 18th-century, more than 150 years after she died. ===Hindi and Rajasthani=== The largest collection of poems credited to her are in 19th-century manuscripts. Scholars have attempted to establish authenticity based on both the poem and Meera being mentioned in other manuscripts as well as from style, linguistics and form.Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, , pages 244-245 John Stratton Hawley cautions, \"When one speaks of the poetry of Mirabai, then, there is always an element of enigma. (...) there must always remain a question about whether there is any real relation between the poems we cite and a historical Mira.\"John Stratton Hawley (2002), Asceticism (Editors: Vincent Wimbush, Richard Valantasi), Oxford University Press, , page 302 In her poems, Krishna is a yogi and lover, and she herself is a yogini ready to take her place by his side into a spiritual marital bliss. Meera's style combines impassioned mood, defiance, longing, anticipation, joy and ecstasy of union, always centred on Krishna. Meera speaks of a personal relationship with Krishna as her lover, lord and mountain lifter. (Sanson Ki Mala Pe Simru Main Pi Ka Naam) is written by Meera Bai Shows her dedication towards Lord Krishna.The characteristic of her poetry is complete surrender. Meera is often classed with the northern Sant bhaktis who spoke of Lord Sri Krishna. ===Sikh literature=== Prem Ambodh Pothi, a text attributed to Guru Gobind Singh and completed in 1693 CE, includes poetry of Mira Bai as one of sixteen historic bhakti saints important to Sikhism.JS Hawley and GS Mann (2014), Culture and Circulation: Literature in Motion in Early Modern India (Editors: Thomas De Bruijn and Allison Busch), Brill Academic, , pages 113-136 ==Influence== Scholars acknowledge that Meera was one of the central poet-saints of the Bhakti movement which was during a difficult period in Indian history filled with religious conflicts. Yet, they simultaneously question the extent to which Meera was a canonical projection of social imagination that followed, where she became a symbol of people's suffering and a desire for an alternative.Dirk Wiemann (2008), Genres of Modernity: Contemporary Indian Novels in English, Rodopi, , pages 148-149 Dirk Wiemann, quoting Parita Mukta, states, The continued influence of Meera, in part, has been her message of freedom, her resolve and right to pursue her devotion to deity Krishna and her spiritual beliefs as she felt drawn to despite her persecution. Her appeal and influence in Indian culture, writes Edwin Bryant, is from her emerging, through her legends and poems, as a person \"who stands up for what is right and suffers bitterly for holding fast to her convictions, as other men and women have\", yet she does so with a language of love, with words painting the \"full range of emotions that mark love, whether between human beings or between human and divine\".Edwin Bryant (2007), Krishna: A Sourcebook, Oxford University Press, , page 245 A modern painting of Mirabai ==English versions== Aliston and Subramanian have published selections with English translation in India.Mirabai, V.

Sethi has selected poems which Mira composed presumably after she came in contact with Saint Ravidas.Sethi, V.K.,Mira: The Divine Lover, Radha Soami Satsang Beas, Punjab 1988 and Meera Pakeerah. Some bhajans of Meera have been rendered into English by Robert Bly and Jane Hirshfield as Mirabai: Ecstatic Poems.Bly, Robert / Hirshfield, Jane,Mirabai: Ecstatic Poems, Boston, Massachusetts 2004 ==Popular culture== Mirabai Museum Merta Composer John Harbison adapted Bly's translations for his Mirabai Songs. There is a documentary film A Few Things I Know About Her by Anjali Panjabi. Two well-known films of her life have been made in India, Meera (1945), a Tamil language film starring M. S. Subbulakshmi, and Meera a 1979 Hindi film by Gulzar. TV series, Meera (2009\u20132010) was also based on her life. Meera Bai's life has been interpreted as a musical story in Meera\u2014The Lover\u2026, a music album based on original compositions for some well known Meera bhajans, released 11 October 2009. The Meera Mahal in Merta is a museum dedicated to telling the story of Mirabai through sculptures, paintings, displays and a shaded garden. ==See also== * Aandaal * Akka Mahadevi * Bhajan ==References== ==Further reading== * Robert Bly and Jane Hirshfield (2004), Mirabai: Ecstatic Poems, Beacon Press, * Chaturved\u012b, \u0100c\u0101rya Parashur\u0101m(a), M\u012br\u0101\u0149b\u0101\u012b k\u012b pad\u0101val\u012b,(16. edition) * Goetz, Hermann, Mira Bai: Her Life and Times, Bombay 1966 * Levi, Louise Landes.
