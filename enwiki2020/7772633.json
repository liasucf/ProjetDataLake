The National Map, accessed August 8, 2011 tributary of the Juniata River in Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania in the United States.Gertler, Edward. Keystone Canoeing, Seneca Press, 2004. Shaver's Creek joins the Juniata River at the borough of Petersburg. The creek gives its name to the Shaver's Creek Environmental Center. ==History== The creek was named for Peter Shaver, an original settler in that area within the Juniata Valley. Family genealogy research show \"Hans Pieter\" arriving in America aboard the ship, Loyal Judith in 1732. He was licensed as a fur trapper/Indian trader in Fredericktown, MD by the PA Colony Council in 1744. Little is known of his life, but he was described as dying in \u201ca most singular manner\u201d after being found decapitated near his home. His murder proved to be a significant mystery at the time because his head was never recovered after extensive searches of the area. During the American Revolutionary War, an energetic settler in the area named Samuel Anderson, who had also married Peter's widow, Rhoda, erected a blockhouse fort on the flat near the mouth of the creek which was occupied during the war.https://archive.org/details/historyofearlyse00jone ==See also== *List of rivers of Pennsylvania ==References== *Jones, U.J.
