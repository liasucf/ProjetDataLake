    "text": "The Szeged Idea (), also informally known as Szeged fascism refers to the proto-fascist ideology that developed among anti-communist counter- revolutionaries in Szeged, Hungary in 1919 and which later developed into a fascist and national socialist ideology.Michael Mann. Fascists. New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University Press, 2004. Pp. 240. The Szeged Idea was based upon the claim that Hungary was stabbed in the back in World War I by communists and Jews and promoted action to undo this evil by declaring holy war against such traitors.Zsuzsanna Ozsv\u00e1th, Mikl\u00f3s Radn\u00f3ti. In the footsteps of Orpheus: the life and times of Mikl\u00f3s Radn\u00f3ti. Bloomington, Indiana, USA: Indiana University Press, 2000. Pp. 8. Szeged militants promoted Hungarian nationalism, an economic \"third way\", and advocated a \"strong\" state. Szegedists promoted irredentist claims to territories belonging to Hungary prior to the end of World War I. The ideology claimed the existence of a \"Judeo-Bolshevik\" conspiracy in Hungary. The principal leader of the Szegedists was Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s.Michael Mann. Fascists. New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University Press, 2004. Pp. 243. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s declared violence to be an acceptable means of statecraft...to shape the course of history, not in the interest of a narrow clique, but of an entire nation. Upon being appointed Prime Minister, G\u00f6mb\u00f6s adopted fascist and national socialist positions, including the promotion of corporatist solutions to national unity like that of Benito Mussolini and racial policy like that of Adolf Hitler. G\u00f6mb\u00f6s declared that his government would secure our national civilization based upon our own special racial peculiarities and upon Christian moral principles. ==References== ==See also== * Hungarian National Defence Association * Party of Hungarian Life Category:Szeged Category:Anti-communism in Hungary Category:Antisemitism in Hungary Category:Fascism in Hungary Category:Politics of Hungary ",
