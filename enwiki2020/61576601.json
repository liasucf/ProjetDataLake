    "text": "Luis Theo Fernandez (born 28 September 2001) is an English professional footballer who plays as a defender for National League South club Oxford City, on loan from Stevenage. ==Career== Fernandez joined Stevenage at the age of 13, and progressed through the club's youth system. Following Ben Wilmot's inclusion in the Stevenage first-team; Fernandez, who was still playing regularly for the club's U16 team at the time, was called up to play at centre-back in the FA Youth Cup against Middlesbrough's U18 team. He played 90 minutes of the match, which Stevenage lost 2\u20131. Stevenage head of academy coaching Stephen Payne stated he felt Fernandez's late inclusion and ability to deal with the \"pressure environment\" put Fernandez in good stead for his professional career. Whilst still a second-year scholar, aged 17, Fernandez made his first-team debut in Stevenage's 2\u20131 home loss to Southend United in the EFL Cup on 13 August 2019, playing the whole match. After the match, he was singled out for praise by manager Dino Maamria, who described Fernandez's debut as being \"a Man of the Match performance\". Fernandez signed his first professional contract on 28 August 2019. He made eight first-team appearances during the 2019\u201320 season. Having made one first-team appearance for Stevenage during the opening month of the 2020\u201321 season, Fernandez joined National League South club Oxford City on a three-month loan deal on 9 October 2020. He made his debut as a 60th-minute substitute in Oxford City's 1\u20131 away draw with Chelmsford City on 10 October 2020. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|EFL Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Stevenage | 2019\u201320 |League Two |4||0||1||0||1||0||2||0||8||0 |- | 2020\u201321 |League Two |0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||1||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !4!!0!!1!!0!!1!!0!!3!!0!!9!!0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Oxford City (loan) | 2020\u201321 |National League South |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||2||0 |- !colspan=3|Career total !6||0||1||0||1||0||3||0||11||0 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2001 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Stevenage F.C. players Category:Oxford City F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
