The Australian cricket team toured India from February to April 2001 for a three-Test series and a five-match ODI series. ==Events== Current Indian cricketers Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh and Virender Sehwag (left to right) The BCCI tinkered with the Duleep Trophy in the 2002\u201303 season. The original zonal teams were replaced by five new teams called Elite A, Elite B, Elite C, Plate A and Plate B. These teams were constructed from the new Elite Group and Plate Group divisions which had been introduced into the Ranji Trophy that season. However, this format lasted for only one season as it was felt that the new teams lacked a sense of identity. From the 2003\u201304 season, the five original zonal teams competed along with a sixth guest team which was a touring foreign team. The first guest team was England A in 2003\u201304. The Indian Premier League has become very popular in India since its inaugural in 2008. Mumbai (formerly Bombay) has continued its dominance of the domestic scene into the 21st century by winning the Ranji Trophy five times in the first decade. Noted Indian cricketers in the 21st century include Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Anil Kumble, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, VVS Laxman, Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli. India won the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in 2007. India was the first Sub- continental team to win a Test match at the WACA in January 2008 against Australia. Indian cricket team under the leadership of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and brilliant performances from Gautam Gambhir & Yuvraj Singh also went on to win the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 and became the first team in history to win the Cup at home. ==Domestic cricket== ===Ranji Trophy winners=== * 2000\u201301 \u2013 Baroda * 2001\u201302 \u2013 Railways * 2002\u201303 \u2013 Mumbai * 2003\u201304 \u2013 Mumbai * 2004\u201305 \u2013 Railways * 2005\u201306 \u2013 Uttar Pradesh * 2006\u201307 \u2013 Mumbai * 2007\u201308 \u2013 Delhi * 2008\u201309 \u2013 Mumbai * 2009\u201310 \u2013 Mumbai * 2010\u201311 \u2013 Rajasthan * 2011\u201312 \u2013 Rajasthan * 2012\u201313 \u2013 Mumbai * 2013\u201314 \u2013 Karnataka * 2014\u201315 \u2013 Karnataka ===Duleep Trophy winners=== * 2000\u201301 \u2013 North Zone * 2001\u201302 \u2013 West Zone * 2002\u201303 \u2013 Elite C * 2003\u201304 \u2013 North Zone * 2004\u201305 \u2013 Central Zone * 2005\u201306 \u2013 West Zone * 2006\u201307 \u2013 North Zone * 2007\u201308 \u2013 North Zone * 2008\u201309 \u2013 West Zone * 2009\u201310 \u2013 West Zone * 2010\u201311 \u2013 South Zone * 2011\u201312 \u2013 East Zone * 2012\u201313 \u2013 East Zone * 2013\u201314 \u2013 North Zone & South Zone Shared * 2014\u201315 \u2013 Central Zone ==International tours of India== ===Zimbabwe 2000\u201301=== * 1st Test at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi \u2013 India won by 7 wickets * 2nd Test at Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur \u2013 match drawn ===Australia 2000\u201301=== * 1st Test at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai \u2013 Australia won by 10 wickets * 2nd Test at Eden Gardens, Calcutta \u2013 India won by 171 runs * 3rd Test at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk, Chennai \u2013 India won by 2 wickets ===England 2001\u201302=== * 1st Test at Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, Mohali \u2013 India won by 10 wickets * 2nd Test at Sardar Patel Stadium, Motera, Ahmedabad \u2013 match drawn * 3rd Test at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore \u2013 match drawn ===Zimbabwe 2001\u201302=== * 1st Test at Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur \u2013 India won by an innings and 101 runs * 2nd Test at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi \u2013 India won by 4 wickets ===West Indies 2002\u201303=== * 1st Test at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai \u2013 India won by an innings and 112 runs * 2nd Test at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk, Chennai \u2013 India won by 8 wickets * 3rd Test at Eden Gardens, Kolkata \u2013 match drawn ===New Zealand 2003\u201304=== * 1st Test at Sardar Patel Stadium, Motera, Ahmedabad \u2013 match drawn * 2nd Test at Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, Mohali \u2013 match drawn ===Australia 2004\u201305=== * 1st Test at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore \u2013 Australia won by 217 runs * 2nd Test at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk, Chennai \u2013 match drawn * 3rd Test at Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur \u2013 Australia won by 342 runs * 4th Test at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai \u2013 India won by 13 runs ===South Africa 2004\u201305=== * 1st Test at Modi Stadium, Kanpur \u2013 match drawn * 2nd Test at Eden Gardens, Kolkata \u2013 India won by 8 wickets ===Pakistan 2004\u201305=== * 1st Test at Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, Mohali \u2013 match drawn * 2nd Test at Eden Gardens, Kolkata \u2013 India won by 195 runs * 3rd Test at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore \u2013 Pakistan won by 168 runs ===South Africa 2005\u201306=== Limited overs tour only. ===Sri Lanka 2005\u201306=== * 1st Test at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk, Chennai \u2013 match drawn * 2nd Test at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi \u2013 India won by 188 runs * 3rd Test at Sardar Patel Stadium, Motera, Ahmedabad \u2013 India won by 259 runs ===England 2005\u201306=== * 1st Test at Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur \u2013 match drawn * 2nd Test at Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, Mohali \u2013 India won by 9 wickets * 3rd Test at Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai \u2013 England won by 212 runs ===Sri Lanka 2006\u201307=== Limited overs tour only. ===West Indies 2006\u201307=== Limited overs tour only. ==External sources== * CricketArchive \u2013 Itinerary of Events in India ==Further reading== 2007 2007 ",
