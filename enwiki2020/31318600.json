    "text": "The Black Crown is the third full-length studio album by American deathcore band Suicide Silence, which was released July 12, 2011 through Century Media Records. It is the final album to feature vocalist Mitch Lucker, who died on November 1, 2012. With anticipation for their third full-length after the release of No Time to Bleed, Suicide Silence prepared recording for The Black Crown on a course of several months starting from the beginning of 2010 with writing ideas and plans before their arrival to the studio for recording in 2011. The album was produced by Steve Evetts. ==Lyrical themes== Vocalist Mitch Lucker revealed that the controversial anti-religious lyrics that were included on Suicide Silence's previous albums would not be included on The Black Crown. When asked by Kerrang!, Lucker revealed that the album's lyrical themes would feature more of the personal topics that No Time to Bleed had in- concept. Lucker explained: \"I'm not trying to put people's beliefs down - it's about me and my life. This is my head cracked open and poured on the paper! I still have the same beliefs and same views, but I'm more open to everything,\" he adds. \"At this point in my life, I don't see the good in making people hate you for something you say. This record is for everybody.\" ==Cover artwork== The cover for The Black Crown was designed by Ken \"K3N\" Adams, who designs the artwork for Lamb of God albums as well as many other artists such as Coheed and Cambria and 88 Fingers Louie. The Black Crown was released in several editions such as the standard CD, vinyl (limited to 1000), deluxe edition box set, Digipak limited edition, hot topic version, and a picture disc. ==Reception== Garnering positive reviews, The Black Crown was praised by Rock Sound earning a 7 out of 10 rating with a review headline reading \"There's no more of that deathcore monotony from Suicide Silence...\" and went on further to state \"blastbeats and breakneck discordant technicality aren\u2019t lacking on the five-piece\u2019s third LP, but nor are they over-prescribed. In fact, to the group\u2019s merit, there\u2019s very little outright and over-used death metal fury, instead it\u2019s partially replaced by modern metal ambiguities and churning, lengthy breaks.\" Metal Underground stated \"What really makes 'The Black Crown' a worthy listen and elevates it above the dime-a-dozen dreck of today\u2019s deathcore\" coupled with the statement \"All the familiar elements that make this band are present in spades.\" Diminuendo gave much praise to the album, giving the album a rating in amplifier attenuation of 8 out of 11. The held the statement; \"Coarse with rapid fret board shred, Suicide Silence does not fail to bewilder fans with mind-blowing disharmony you'll always remember, and pinch harmonics you wish you could forget. The Black Crown demonstrates that deathcore does possess musical merit.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Charts !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- | U.S. Billboard 200|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|28 |- | U.S. Billboard Rock Albums || style=\"text-align:center;\"|7 |- | U.S. Billboard Independent Albums || style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- | U.S. Billboard Hard Rock Albums || style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |} ==Personnel== Suicide Silence * Mitch Lucker\u2013 vocals * Chris Garza \u2013 guitars * Mark Heylmun \u2013 guitars * Dan Kenny \u2013 bass * Alex Lopez \u2013 drums Production *Production and engineering by Steve Evetts *Mixing by Chris \"Zeuss\" Harris at Planet Z Studios, Hadley, Massachusetts *Additional engineering by Allan Hessler *Recorded at The Omen Room Studios, Garden Grove, California *Management by Jerry Clubb for Ricochet Management *A&R; by Steve Joh of Century Media *Artwork and layout by Ken Adams *Sound design and programming by Clinton Bradley ==References== ==External links== *The Black Crown at Century Media *The Black Crown at Third Degree Merch Category:Suicide Silence albums Category:2011 albums Category:Albums produced by Steve Evetts Category:Century Media Records albums Category:Deathcore albums Category:Nu metalcore albums ",
