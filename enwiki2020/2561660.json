    "text": "Acer pensylvanicum (striped maple, also known as moosewood, moose maple and goosefoot maple) is a small North American species of maple. The striped maple is a sequential hermaphrodite, meaning that it can change its sex throughout its lifetime. ==Description== It is a small deciduous tree growing to tall, with a trunk up to in diameter. The young bark is striped with green and white, and when a little older, brown. The leaves are broad and soft, long and broad, with three shallow forward-pointing lobes. The fruit is a samara; the seeds are about long and broad, with a wing angle of 145\u00b0 and a conspicuously veined pedicel.Virginia Tech Dept. of Forest Resources and Environmental ConservationCarolina NatureLady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, University of Texas The bloom period for Acer pensylvanicum is around late spring. The spelling pensylvanicum is the one originally used by Linnaeus. ==Distribution== The natural range extends from Nova Scotia and the Gaspe Peninsula of Quebec, west to southern Ontario, Michigan, and Saskatchewan; south to northeastern Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, and along the Appalachian Mountains as far south as northern Georgia.Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map ==Ecology== pine and hickory in the background (Zena, New York) Moosewood is an understory tree of cool, moist forests, often preferring slopes. It is among the most shade-tolerant of deciduous trees, capable of germinating and persisting for years as a small understory shrub, then growing rapidly to its full height when a gap opens up. However, it does not grow high enough to become a canopy tree, and once the gap above it closes through succession, it responds by flowering and fruiting profusely, and to some degree spreading by vegetative reproduction. Mammals such as moose, deer, beavers, and rabbits eat the bark, particularly during the winter. ==References== ==External links== *NRCS: United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile and map: Acer pennsylvanicum *Interactive Distribution Map of Acer pensylvanicum pensylvanicum Category:Hardwood forest plants Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains Category:Flora of Eastern Canada Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
