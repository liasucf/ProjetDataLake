In 1933, Davidson invited Rev. Finis Dake to lead Sunday afternoon prayer meetings in the vacant Cameo Theater in Kenosha. Prayer meetings turned into Christian Assembly church, which was chartered with the Assemblies of God denomination on February 18, 1935. The Assemblies of God, headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, is rooted in a religious revival that began in the late 1800s, and is based on biblical and spiritual experiences. ===Previous locations=== The church purchased property at 2500 Roosevelt Rd. in Kenosha with Otis Keener as the founding pastor. In 1939, the name was changed from Christian Assembly to Assembly of God. A radio broadcast began around the same time, and ran until about 1970.
