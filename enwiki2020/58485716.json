    "text": "Pedro Diego Jordano Barbudo (born July 23, 1957, in Cordoba, Spain) is an ecologist, conservationist, researcher, focused on evolutionary ecology and ecological interactions. He is an honorary professor at University of Sevilla, Spain. Most of his fieldwork is done in Parque Natural de las Sierras de Cazorla, Segura y Las Villas, in the eastern side of Andalucia, and in Do\u00f1ana National Park, where he holds the title of Research Professor for the Estacion Biologica Do\u00f1ana, Spanish Council for Scientific Research (CSIC). == Education == Jordano obtained his bachelor's degree in the University of Cordoba, in Spain, in Biology, Ecology and evolutionary biology. His Ph.D is from the University of Sevilla, Spain where he focused on ecological and evolutionary consequences of mutualistic interactions between animals and plants. == Professional appointments == His professional career started in 1987 as an Associate Researcher for the Spanish Council for Scientific Research (CSIC). In 1996 he was promoted to the position of Scientific Researcher, a position he held until 2004. From 1997 to 2002 he was also Scientific Coordinator for the Molecular Biology Laboratory at Estaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3gica de Do\u00f1ana. In 2001 he became the Director of the Dept. of Evolutionary Biology, Estaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3gica de Do\u00f1ana, CSIC. From 2004 to 2008 he was a representative in Eurocores EuroDiversity Program for the European Science Foundation. During the same time period he was the National Research Panel officer for the Biodiversity, Ecology and Global Change Program, Spanish Ministry of Education and Science. From 2008 to 2013. He was appointed a Chair for the Spanish Panel for the National Research Plan, program of Biodiversity, Ecology and Global Change in Ministry of Economy and Innovation. At present he holds two titles: Professor of Research for CSIC, and Chair of the Environmental Sciences and Technologies Program, State Research Agency (AEI), Ministry of Science, Universities, and Innovation, Spain. == Research == Jordano's research focuses in evolutionary ecology. He is devoted to explain how ecological interaction, more precisely pollinators and seed dispersers, evolve and are vital for biodiversity survival and proliferation. He has spent most of his research time in Spain, but he also conducts research in Brazil in collaboration with Dr. Mauro Galetti and others. Together, they have studied the role of seed dispersers in Brazilian ecosystems including the Atlantic Forest and Pantanal; they also created a course on Frugivory and Seed Dispersal as part of the post-graduate program in Ecology and Biodiversity at the State University Paulista \"Julio de Mesquita Jr.\" (UNESP). Current research projects include components of pollination effectiveness and their consequences in insular pollinator assemblages, ecological correlates of interaction in complex plant-animal mutualistic networks and ecological networks in a fragmented world.

This paper is intended to take DNA samples of defecated or regurgitated seeds to determine which animals are spreading the seeds. And with that, explain long-distance dispersal, safe- delivery of seeds and colonization to new sites. * This paper was to identify and document how pollinators and plants coevolution have affected in individual and highly diverse individuals. * Jordano, Pedro; Bascompte, Jordi; Olesen, Jens M.

ISSN 1461-023X. === Do\u00f1ana Biological Station === Dr. Pedro Jordano holds the title of Research Professor at the Do\u00f1ana Biological Station, the highest position for any researcher at the station. His most recent research project is an ongoing study named \"Dispersi\u00f3n por animales frug\u00edvoros y expansi\u00f3n de \u00e1rea en plantas: una aproximaci\u00f3n con redes multicapa\" (Seed dispersion by frugivores and plant area expansion). The project is trying to demonstrate how plants expand and colonize new areas due to frugivores seed dispersal and travel patterns. == Honors and awards == * 2018 Premio Ecosistemas-Luis Balaguer. Spanish Ecological Society. * 2016 British Ecological Society, Marsh Award (best book in Ecology) for Mutualistic networks (Princeton Univ. Press), 2014, co- authored with J. Bascompte. * 2014 Rey Jaime I Award, Environmental Conservation, in its XXVII edition. 2014. This is the most prestigious scientific award in Spain, with an international jury including 18 Nobel laureates. Awarded by the Generalitat de Valencia. * 2008 Mercer Award, Ecological Society of America; for a paper co-authored with J. Bascompte and J.M. Olesen (\"Asymmetric coevolutionary networks facilitate biodiversity maintenance\". 2006, Science 312: 431-433). * 2009\u2013present. Honorary professor.

Estimating the relative rates of pollen and seed migration among plant populations. Heredity 72: 250\u2013259.] This paper discuss how plants 'move' through pollen dispersal. The dispersal of plant by pollen grains or seeds, affects genetic patterns because it pinpoints the demographic regeneration process that depends on successful establishment of new individuals. * Jordano, P. 2007.

Seed shadows are the spatial distribution a seed is traveled from its parent tree. Jordano et al. used this element to determine the relationship between plant-animal. * Jordano, P., Bascompte, J. and Olesen, J.M. 2006.

University of Chicago Press, EEUU. Pages: 173\u2013199. This document intends to demonstrate how many pollinator interaction are not specific, thus not having tight mutualism. However, some interactions are very specific between pollinator and plant.
