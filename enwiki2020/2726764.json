    "text": "Stephan Bergler (1738) was a Transylvanian Saxon classical scholar and antiquarian. ==Biography== Born in Kronstadt (Transylvania), he studied at the University of Leipzig, after which he went to Amsterdam, where he edited the works of Homer and the Onomasticon of Julius Pollux. Subsequently, in Hamburg, he assisted the major bibliographer Johann Albert Fabricius in the production of his Bibliotheca Graeca and his edition of Sextus Empiricus. He found a permanent post in Bucharest as secretary to the Prince of Wallachia, Nicholas Mavrocordato, whose work ' (De Officiis) he had previously translated for Fritzsch, a Leipzig bookseller, by whom he had been employed as proofreader and literary hack. In Mavrocordatos' library, Bergler discovered the introduction and the first three chapters of Eusebius's Demonstratio Evangelica. In addition to writing numerous articles for the Leipzig Acta Eruditorum, Bergler edited the editio princeps of the Byzantine historiographer Genesius (1733), and the letters of Alciphron (1715), which contained 75 letters published for the first time. He died in Bucharest, and was buried at his patron's expense. According to another account, Bergler, finding himself without means, left for Istanbul, and died there . He is said to have become a convert to Islam \u2014 this report was probably a mistake for the undisputed fact that he embraced Roman Catholicism. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (11th ed.) characterizes Bergler's life as \"wild and irregular,\" and says he made enemies due to his allegedly cynical manners. ==References== == External links == * Category:1680 births Category:1738 deaths Category:18th-century German people Category:18th-century Romanian people Category:18th-century antiquarians Category:Hungarian antiquarians Category:German antiquarians Category:German scholars Category:Hungarian Roman Catholics Category:German Roman Catholics Category:German male non-fiction writers Category:Transylvanian-Saxon people Category:Hungarian expatriates in the Netherlands Category:Hungarian expatriates in Germany Category:Leipzig University alumni Category:Wallachia Category:History of Bucharest Category:People from Bra\u0219ov Category:18th-century Hungarian male writers ",
