The building construction started in 2011 and finished in 2017. It was developed by Benchmark and designed by Herzog & de Meuron Architekten. ==Design== The building design was inspired by the classic and contemporary history of Beirut. Each floor of the building is distinguished by projecting or set back living spaces that would generate terraces and overhangs, which create a harmony between the building and the cityscape. The overhangs also provide shade and reduce solar gain, while slabs of each floor protrude around their entire circumference by a minimum of , easing construction and maintenance of the facades. The floor plates are thick enough to balance the daily temperature cycles by virtue of their thermal mass, storing cold through the night and releasing it during the day. Therefore, this system made the building design also sustainable for living. ==See also== * List of tallest buildings in Lebanon ==References== Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2017 Category:Buildings and structures in Beirut Category:Apartment buildings ",
