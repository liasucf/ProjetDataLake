    "text": "Mepiprazole (INN, BAN) (brand name Psigodal) is an anxiolytic drug of the phenylpiperazine group with additional antidepressant properties that is marketed in Spain. It acts as a 5-HT2A and \u03b11-adrenergic receptor antagonist and inhibits the reuptake and induces the release of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine to varying extents, and has been described as a serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitor (SARI). Controlled clinical trials of mepiprazole in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were also carried out and suggested some benefits of the drug in relieving symptoms of IBS in some patients. Similarly to other phenylpiperazines like trazodone, nefazodone, and etoperidone, mepiprazole produces mCPP as an active metabolite. ==See also== * Acaprazine * Enpiprazole * Lorpiprazole * Tolpiprazole ==References== Category:5-HT2A antagonists Category:Alpha-1 blockers Category:meta-Chlorophenylpiperazines Category:Pyrazoles Category:Serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agents ",
