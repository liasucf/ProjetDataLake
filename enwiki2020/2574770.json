    "text": "Joe's Corsage is a compilation album featuring music recorded by Frank Zappa with The Mothers of Invention in the mid-1960s, before the recording of their debut album Freak Out! (1966). The album was compiled by archivist Joe Travers, and its title is a play on Zappa's 1979 work Joe's Garage. ==Overview== A number of the recordings featured on Joe's Corsage are demo versions of songs that would later appear on Freak Out!. The first set of demos, probably recorded in 1965, feature the guitar of Henry Vestine, who would later be a member of Canned Heat. Also included are covers of the Righteous Brothers' \"My Babe\", and Marvin Gaye's \"Hitch Hike\". ==Track listing== All tracks by Frank Zappa, except where noted. ==Personnel== *Frank Zappa \u2013 guitar, vocals *Ray Collins \u2013 vocals, tambourine, harmonica (tracks 6\u20138) *Henry Vestine (tracks 2\u20135) \u2013 guitar *Roy Estrada \u2013 bass guitar *Jimmy Carl Black \u2013 drums ==References== ==External links== *Lyrics and details *Joe's Corsage at zappa.com Category:Compilation albums published posthumously Category:Frank Zappa compilation albums Category:The Mothers of Invention albums Category:2004 compilation albums ",
