The area is 90 km2. ==Political geography== The Liberals and the NDP were the two main parties in 2008. The NDP saw much of its support in West Dartmouth, around Topsail Lake, the northern part of Cole Harbour, and the communities of Imperoyal and Woodside as well as the Cole Harbour 30 Indian Reserve. The Conservatives won two polls, both in Cole Harbour. The Liberals dominated in Central, Eastern and Northern Dartmouth and in southern Cole Harbour. ==History== The riding of Dartmouth\u2014Halifax East was created in 1966 when the former dual-member Halifax riding was split into two. The district consisted of the Dartmouth area, Bedford and most of eastern Halifax County. Bedford was moved to the riding of Halifax West in a 1976 redistribution. In 1987, the Dartmouth riding was created, taking in nearly all of the former territory of Dartmouth\u2014Halifax East. The electoral district of Dartmouth\u2014Cole Harbour in 2004 was created from 86.8% of the population of the new riding came from Dartmouth, and 13.2% from Sackville\u2014Musquodoboit Valley\u2014Eastern Shore. The 2012 federal electoral redistribution concluded that this riding will remain largely the same for the 42nd Canadian federal election. It lost a small fraction to the new riding of Sackville\u2014Preston\u2014Chezzetcook and gained a small portion (2%) from what was Sackville\u2014Eastern Shore. ===Member of Parliament=== These ridings have elected the following Members of Parliament: ==Election results== ===Dartmouth\u2014Cole Harbour=== ====2019 general election==== ====2015 general election==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" | 2011 federal election redistributed resultsPundits' Guide to Canadian Elections |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"130px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"50px\" | Vote ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30px\" | % |- | | | New Democratic ||align=right| 16,026 ||align=right| 36.42 |- | | | Liberal ||align=right| 15,278 ||align=right| 34.72 |- | | | Conservative ||align=right| 11,011 ||align=right| 25.03 |- | | | Green ||align=right| 1,684 ||align=right| 3.83 |} ====2011 general election==== ====2008 general election==== ====2006 general election==== ====2004 general election==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" | 2000 federal election redistributed results |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"230px\" colspan=\"2\" | Party ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"50px\" | Vote ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30px\" | % |- | | | New Democratic || 13,805 || 35.32 |- | | | Liberal || 13,246 || 33.89 |- | | | Progressive Conservative || 8,413 || 21.52 |- | | | Alliance || 3,488 || 8.92 |- | | | Others || 135 || 0.35 |} ===Dartmouth=== ====2000 general election==== ====1997 general election==== ====1993 general election==== ====1988 general election==== ===Dartmouth\u2014Halifax East=== ====1984 general election==== ====1980 general election==== ====1979 general election==== ====1974 general election==== ====1972 general election==== ====1968 general election==== ==See also== * List of Canadian federal electoral districts * Past Canadian electoral districts ==References== * ===Notes=== ==External links== * Riding history for Dartmouth\u2014Halifax East (1966\u20131987) from the Library of Parliament * Riding history for Dartmouth (1987\u20132003) from the Library of Parliament * Riding history for Dartmouth\u2014Cole Harbour (2003\u2013 ) from the Library of Parliament Category:Nova Scotia federal electoral districts Category:Dartmouth, Nova Scotia Category:Politics of Halifax, Nova Scotia ",
