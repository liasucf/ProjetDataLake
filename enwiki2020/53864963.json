Naresh Saigal was the story writer as well as the director of the movie. Ujala features one of the popular Bollywood songs \"Jhoomta Masoom, Mast Mahina\" played by Shammi Kapoor and Mala Sinha, sung by Manna Dey and Lata Mangeshkar. The film came with a message; \"Honesty always triumphs\".(Wrong link) ==Plot== Ramu (Shammi Kapoor), his family consisting of his mother (Leela Chitnis) and three siblings, and his sweetheart Chhabili (Mala Sinha) are poor, but they dream of a better life and keep trying to achieve it. In the process his childhood friend and villain in the movie Kalu (Raaj Kumar) creates obstacles for his ambitions. Ramu is dragged into an evil world, where Kalu makes him realize that it is easy money to rob someone; honesty apparently has no value. Ramu gets pulled into this world when his sister meets with a car accident. He needs money for her treatment and she dies due to the lack of it. Ramu now joins Kalu and his gang. Kalu kills one of his gang members who betrays him. Kalu convinces Ramu that he may get blamed for the murder so Ramu goes into hiding. He works for a man making knives from where Kalu steals a silver knife, which belongs to a police officer. This implicates Ramu further where he's again on the run. After a final fight with Kalu, Ramu is able to prove his innocence. ==Cast== * Shammi Kapoor as Ramu * Mala Sinha as Chabeli * Raaj Kumar as Kalu * Leela Chitnis as Ramu's mother * Dhumal as Bholu * Kumkum as Kammo * Ramesh Sinha as Police Inspector * Shivraj as Acharya ==Trivia== Raaj Kumar was unhappy as none of the songs were picturized on him, rather picturized on Shammi Kapoor, who was a rising superstar of the late 50s. So Director, Naresh Saigal sorted out the situation by creating a Friendship song between the 2 male stars \"Yaaron surat hamari pe mat jao\" which was sung by Mukesh and Mohammed Rafi, the 2 famous lead playback singers of that time. ==Music== The film score is composed by the musical duo Shankar Jaikishan. The lyrics were written by Shailendra and Hasrat Jaipuri. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Indian films Category:1950s Hindi-language films Category:Films scored by Shankar Jaikishan ",
