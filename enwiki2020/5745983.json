    "text": "\"The Back Seat of My Car\" is a song written by Paul McCartney and released by him and his wife Linda McCartney as the last track on the 1971 album Ram. Several months later, it was released as a single in the UK, peaking at number 39. The song modulates stylistically between a sweeping piano-and-orchestra ballad similar to McCartney's \"The Long and Winding Road\" and upbeat rock sections before ending in a raucous and passionate finale. ==History== McCartney first presented this composition for The Beatles' consideration during the Get Back rehearsals on 14 January 1969 at Twickenham Film Studios in London, but the album was aborted before anything could be done with the song, which eventually did not make it onto Let It Be either. According to McCartney, this song and other car-based songs in his late-Beatles and early solo career, such as \"Two of Us\" and \"Helen Wheels,\" were inspired by the long road trips he and Linda used to take as the Beatles were breaking up. Most of the song is a piano-based ballad. But it is interspersed with orchestral sections and sections inspired by 50s-style rock 'n' roll. Allmusic critic Stewart Mason likens the main tune to those of McCartney's Beatle songs \"Two of Us\" and \"You Never Give Me Your Money.\" Mason compares the effect of the various song sections to the medley from the Beatles Abbey Road and to some of the Beach Boys' post-Pet Sounds work. McCartney said of the song: ==Reception== John Lennon felt that this song, among others on the album, was directed critically towards him; in particular, he perceived the protagonists who sing \"We believe that we can't be wrong\" to be himself and Yoko Ono.McCartney: Songwriter p. 104 Allmusic critic Stewart Mason claims that in the context of the criticism McCartney was receiving in the aftermath of the Beatles breakup, this line sounds more like a \"statement of personal intent\" than the declaration of love it could be in the context of the song's lyrics themselves. In a contemporary review for RAM, Jon Landau of Rolling Stone described \"The Back Seat of My Car\" as one of only two good songs he enjoyed on the album, the other being \"Eat at Home\". Landau further described the song as \"the album's production number\". Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said the song demonstrated the \"imaginative and gorgeous\" arrangements on Ram and called the song its \"sad, soaring finale.\" Mason considers it to be the \"true highlight\" of Ram. ==Personnel== *Paul McCartney \u2013 lead and backing vocals, piano, electric guitar, bass guitar *Linda McCartney \u2013 backing vocals *David Spinozza \u2013 lead guitar *Hugh McCracken \u2013 lead guitar *Denny Seiwell \u2013 drums *New York Philharmonic \u2013 orchestral arrangement ==References== ==External links== * Category:Paul McCartney songs Category:Apple Records singles Category:1971 singles Category:Songs written by Paul McCartney Category:Song recordings produced by Paul McCartney Category:Music published by MPL Music Publishing Category:1971 songs ",
