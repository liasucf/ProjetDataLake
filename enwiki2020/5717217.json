Owned by Deerfield Media, it is operated under joint sales and shared services agreements (JSA/SSA) by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, making it a sister station to Beaumont-licensed CBS affiliate KFDM (channel 6). The two stations share studios at the I-10/US 69 (Eastex Freeway) interchange in Beaumont; KBTV's transmitter is located in Vidor. On cable, the station is available on Charter Spectrum channel 2 in both standard and high definition. ==History== Channel 4 signed on October 22, 1957 as KPAC-TV, an NBC affiliate owned by Texas Gulfcoast Television, Inc., itself jointly owned by Port Arthur College, owner of KPAC radio (1250 AM, now KDEI; and 98.5 FM, now KTJM), and the Jefferson Amusement Company. Port Arthur College sold its stake in the station to the Jefferson Amusement Company in 1965; as Port Arthur College retained the radio stations, channel 4 changed its call letters to KJAC-TV (the call letters were derived from the company's name). The station was the first in the area to broadcast in color, use video tape, and air live coverage of area high school football games. Among the original programming that originated at KPAC/KJAC's studios were wrestling, the kid's western show Cowboy John, afternoon Bingo, and the Circle 4 Club. During the 1950s, KPAC also had the only local teen dance program, Jive At Five. Both The Cowboy John Show and Jive At Five had \"colored days\", in which African Americans were permitted to participate. Jefferson Entertainment Company sold KJAC to Clay Communications in 1973; Clay, in turn, sold its television stations to Price Communications in 1987. Price sold most of its television stations (except for WHTM-TV in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) to USA Broadcast Group in 1995; USA soon renamed itself U.S. Broadcast Group after a complaint from USA Network. KBTV's last logo as an NBC affiliate; several versions of this logo were used from when the station became KBTV in 1999 until affiliating with Fox in 2009. Nexstar Broadcasting Group purchased KJAC from U.S. Broadcast Group in 1998. On June 11, 1999, the station took its present KBTV-TV callsign to align itself more with Beaumont, even though it is still licensed to Port Arthur. The call letters had previously been used by channel 9 in Denver (now KUSA) and channel 8 in Dallas (now WFAA). KBTV-TV also shares its call letters with KBTV-CD channel 51 in Sacramento, California. To go along with the call change, KBTV moved from its Port Arthur studios to studios inside Parkdale Mall in Beaumont, where it remained until it moved to KFDM's studios in April 2013. The station was one of the few television stations in the country to have studios located inside a major shopping center. KBTV's first \"Fox 4\" logo, used from 2009 until 2014 In October 2008, Nexstar reached an agreement with Fox in which KBTV would become the new Fox affiliate for the Beaumont market. The move was made because Nexstar wanted to increase KBTV's news output. The affiliation switch took effect on January 1, 2009, ending KBTV's 51-year affiliation with NBC. This caused a shakeup in the market as NBC went to a digital subchannel of ABC affiliate KBMT, while KUIL-LP (a former satellite of Lake Charles-based KVHP), which lost Fox, went independent at that time.http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/?ndmViewId=news_view&newsId;=20081029005174&newsLang;=en The now-KBMT-LD has since become operated by KBMT and affiliated with MyNetworkTV. With this switch, KBTV became the third Fox affiliate to serve southeastern Texas after both KVHP (which served as the network's affiliate of record for the Beaumont area for the network's first sixteen years of existence) and KUIL-LP. On February 2, 2009 at 2 p.m., a fire destroyed KBTV's old studios in Port Arthur at 2900 17th Street,The News (Port Arthur): \"Old Channel 4 building 'total loss' to fire\", 2/2/2009. Radio-Info: \"KBTV Old Port Arthur Studios Destroyed in Fire\", 2/3/2009. a mere 12 hours from giving control to Nexstar's master control hub in Little Rock, Arkansas. ATF investigated and no suspect has ever been found. Originally the station's home from its 1957 sign-on until 1999, the building primarily served after the move as a storage facility, though the station's doppler weather radar was still based there. The building was demolished a few months later. Nexstar filed to sell KBTV-TV to Deerfield Media on August 22, 2012, making this Nexstar's first divestiture in the company's history. Upon the deal's completion on December 3, 2012, the station entered into a joint sales agreement and a shared services agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group, making it a sister station to CBS affiliate KFDM. On May 8, 2017, Sinclair announced that it would be acquiring Tribune Media in an all-cash transaction valued at $3.9 billion. Had it received regulatory approval from the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, KBTV would have gained two more sister stations, Dallas CW affiliate KDAF and Houston CW affiliate KIAH. The deal was canceled by Tribune in August 2018. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Channel ! Video ! Aspect !

The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 40. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former VHF analog channel 4. ==Programming== Syndicated programming on KBTV-TV includes Divorce Court, Family Feud, and Jeopardy!, among others. The Beaumont area is one of the few markets to carry Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune on separate stations, with Wheel airing on sister station KFDM. ==News operation== Currently, KBTV carries a total of 23\u00bd hours of local newscasts each week (4\u00bd hours each weekday and a half-hour each on Saturdays and Sundays). After KBTV affiliated with Fox, news was expanded from 1\u00bd to three hours on weekday mornings, and the half-hour 5 and 6 p.m. newscasts were cancelled and replaced with an hour-long 4 p.m. newscast. It also discontinued its 10 p.m. newscast, and moved it to 9 p.m. (and expanding it to one hour on weeknights), although some Fox affiliates in other markets maintain newscasts at both 9 and 10 p.m. KBTV has the distinction of being one of the smallest, if not the smallest Fox affiliate (in terms of market size) to carry late afternoon newscasts. In September 2010, the 4 p.m. newscast was changed to a news/lifestyle format called Southeast Texas Live and a 5:30 p.m. newscast also debuted. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:Fox network affiliates Category:TBD (TV network) affiliates Category:Comet (TV network) affiliates Category:Dabl affiliates BTV-TV Category:Sinclair Broadcast Group Category:Television channels and stations established in 1957 Category:1957 establishments in Texas ",
