At the 1977 Summer Universiade in Sofia he set a new world record in the 110 m hurdles with a time 13.21 seconds. This record would, however, only stand for two years. He could never fully copy the world-leading performance at the Olympic Games, where he won silver medals in 1976 and 1980. His Cuban record time has later been improved by Anier Garc\u00eda, Dayron Robles and Emilio Valle.IAAF top lists - 110 m hurdles men ==References== ==External links== * * * 1975 Pan American 4 x 100 metres relay final Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Havana Category:Cuban male hurdlers Category:Olympic athletes of Cuba Category:Olympic silver medalists for Cuba Category:Olympic silver medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Medalists at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1972 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Cuba Category:Pan American Games silver medalists for Cuba Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1971 Pan American Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1975 Pan American Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1979 Pan American Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1983 Pan American Games Category:Universiade medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Central American and Caribbean Games gold medalists for Cuba Category:Competitors at the 1974 Central American and Caribbean Games Category:Competitors at the 1978 Central American and Caribbean Games Category:Competitors at the 1982 Central American and Caribbean Games Category:Universiade gold medalists for Cuba Category:Central American and Caribbean Games medalists in athletics Category:Medalists at the 1977 Summer Universiade ",
