    "text": "Enrique G\u00f3mez Mu\u00f1oz (20 July 1898 \u2013 14 March 1926), known as Spencer, was a Spanish footballer who played as a forward. ==Club career== Born in Seville, Andalusia, Spencer spent the vast majority of his career at hometown club Sevilla FC, whom he joined in 1913 at the age of 15. To mislead his father, who wanted him to stop playing football to concentrate on studies, he played under that moniker. Spencer also represented Real Oviedo, after being relocated to the city to perform his military service. ==International career== On 16 December 1923, in only the 12th fixture of their existence, Spencer received his only cap for the Spanish national team, a 3\u20130 friendly win over neighbours Portugal. In the match in his native city, he and Herminio became the first Sevilla players to feature in international football. ==Death== Due to complications from surgery for appendicitis, Spencer died aged 27 on 14 March 1926. Later that day, a minute's silence was observed before Sevilla's home match against Real Madrid in that year's Copa del Rey. After the game, players from both teams carried his casket to the cemetery, with thousands of fans in attendance. ==References== ==External links== * * *Spain stats at European-Football Category:1898 births Category:1926 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Seville Category:Spanish footballers Category:Andalusian footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Sevilla FC players Category:Real Oviedo players Category:Spain international footballers Category:Deaths from appendicitis ",
