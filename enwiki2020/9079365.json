The club's home stadium was Xinhua Road Sports Center, while the important matches were played at the more modern stadium Wuhan Sports Center in China. Their fans were mainly from Hubei province and the club had supporters from the city of Wuhan, and the surrounding cities of Ezhou, Huangshi and Xiaogan. It was founded in 1954 as the Hubei Football Team, while the professional football team was founded in February 1994. In 2008, Wuhan FC quit the Chinese Super League because of what it believed to be unfair punishment after the club had a dispute with the Chinese Football Association over the club's on-field behaviour against Beijing Guoan in a league game. Some of its players formed a new team called Hubei Greenery and made a return to Chinese Super League in 2013.\u6b66\u6c49\u8db3\u7403\u91cd\u8fd4\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d5b\u573a ==History== ===Hubei Football Team=== The club was formed in 1954 by the local Hubei province sports body to take part in China's national football league tournament.

Despite several injuries to some key players the club were able to win the 2005 Chinese Super League Cup by beating Shenzhen Jianlibao 3\u20131 on aggregate after a 1:1 away match and 2:0 home match fixture.
