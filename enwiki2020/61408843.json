He won the October 1st race for re-election in 2019. ==== Meme Controversy ==== In 2018, then Mayor Matherly posted a meme on his Facebook page mocking Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. The meme showed Dr. Ford with her hand raised and a caption which read \"Believe in something, Even if you can't remember anything,\" referencing the Nike ad featuring Colin Kaepernick. The post prompted outrage from Fairbanksans. Matherly issued an apology, stating that his girlfriend had posted the meme when he showed her his new iPhone. ==== Ordinance 6093: LGBTQ+ Non-Discrimination Ordinance ==== Controversially, after stating support for an LGBTQ+ non-discrimination ordinance, Matherly then vetoed the ordinance several days later.
