The book, published in 1998, shares its name with Roth's debut release as a solo artist, 1985's Crazy from the Heat EP. The cover of the book shows Roth returning to the scene where the artwork for the EP was taken and striking a different pose, this time with a woman in his arms. The book tells of Roth's experiences not only as a member of Van Halen and a solo musician but also about his childhood (he was born in Bloomington Indiana), rock climbing hobby and between recording/touring experiences. The book also features some of Roth's poetry which had never been officially published before. The book was a US bestseller.
