Stratton and stayed on during second tenure of Governor Daniel Haines. He would later serve as a delegate to the 1864 Democratic National Convention. Browning's Cherry Hill Farm helped give Cherry Hill, New Jersey its name. He is often credited with coining the term \"the Garden State\", the official nickname of New Jersey,Kozma, Christina. \"Reaping what they Sow; What's it worth... to keep the farm?\", New Jersey Monthly, February 7, 2008. Accessed January 1, 2018. \"Why exactly is New Jersey called the Garden State? According to a recent New Jersey Farm Bureau survey, nearly half of us aren't sure. Some background: In 1876 Abraham Browning, an attorney, politician, and the owner of Cherry Hill Farm, which gave its name to the town that now stands in its place, coined the term, comparing New Jersey, two-thirds of which was rolling farmland, to a big barrel, open on both ends, from which Pennsylvanians and New Yorkers gobbled up the state's agricultural bounty.\" though there is evidence that the term goes back to the colonial period. ==References== Category:1808 births Category:1889 deaths Category:Politicians from Camden, New Jersey Category:People from Cherry Hill, New Jersey Category:New Jersey Attorneys General Category:New Jersey Democrats Category:19th-century American politicians ",
