All 17 games were played at the North Avenue Ice Palace, however, because most of their opponents also called the building home, JHU only played two home games. The team played in the Baltimore Hockey League and played an unbalanced schedule against their four league opponents. The following November machinery that was used for the ice surface was removed from the arena. This left JHU without a home and with interest in the team having dropped precipitously over the previous few years the program was shuttered. Johns Hopkins would not play another organized game of ice hockey for about 90 years and, as of 2020, it has yet to field another varsity team. Johns Hopkins athletic teams did not receive a moniker until 1920. ==Roster== ==Standings== ==Schedule and Results== |- !colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season ==References== Johns Hopkins Johns Hopkins Category:1897 in sports in Maryland Category:1898 in sports in Maryland ",
