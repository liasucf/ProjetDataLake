He was investigated by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI - the party's internal disciplinary body) and the National Supervisory Commission, the highest anti-corruption agency of China, in September 2019. Previously he served as Party chief of Haikou, capital of Hainan province. Zhang is the first senior official who was placed under investigation in Hainan since the Communist Party of China's 19th National Congress in late 2017 and the fourth incumbent provincial level official was sacked for graft since then. ==Biography== Zhang was born in Shou County, Anhui, in March 1961. After the Resumption of College Entrance Examination, he was accepted to Hainan Normal University, where he majored in mathematics. After graduation, he worked as secretary of Communist Youth League of China there. In October 1991, he was transferred to Haikou, capital of Hainan province, and became an official in Hainan Provincial Government. In February 2003 he was promoted to become vice-mayor of Haikou, a position he held until May 2006, when he was appointed head of Hainan Provincial Tourism Bureau. He was mayor and deputy party chief of Danzhou in August 2008, and 14 months later promoted to the Party chief position. He became the Party chief of Sanya in October 2014, and served until November 2016. He was Party chief of Haikou in November 2016, and held that office until September 2019, when he was placed under investigation by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the party's internal disciplinary body, and the National Supervisory Commission, the highest anti-corruption agency of China. == Investigation and arrest== In September 2019, he was investigated for \"suspected serious violations of disciplinary rules and laws\" by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), and the National Supervisory Commission. Police found 13.5 tonnes of gold hidden in his home during an anti-corruption raid. In addition to the gold, inspectors also discovered 268 billion yuan (\u00a330 billion) in suspected bribes in his bank account, which would make him the richest man in China. On March 4, 2020, Zhang has been expelled from the Communist Party of China (CPC) and dismissed from public offices. ==References== Category:1961 births Category:People from Huainan Category:Living people Category:Hainan Normal University alumni Category:People's Republic of China politicians from Anhui Category:Communist Party of China politicians from Anhui Category:Expelled members of the Chinese Communist Party ",
