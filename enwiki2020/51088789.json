    "text": "Eduardo Cerqueira (born 31 March 1921), is a retired Portuguese footballer who played as a full back. He was most known for representing Benfica during the 1940s and Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es in the following decade. He won the Primeira Divis\u00e3o with Benfica in 1944\u201345. ==Career== Born in Lisbon, Cerqueira career started in 1937 at SC Sacav\u00e9m. A year later, he moved to GD \u201cOs F\u00f3sforos\", where he stayed for three years, until he joined Sport Lisboa e Monte Pedral in 1941. After only one season there, J\u00e1nos Biri took him to Benfica. He made his debut for Benfica on 6 February 1944, against Salgueiros. The following year, Cerqueira joined Gaspar Pinto in the center of the defence and played 21 games on the way to his first Primeira Divis\u00e3o title. Despite remaining in the starting eleven, the partnership with Artur Teixeira in 1945\u201346 was an unsuccessful one, as Benfica failed to win any silverware. In 1946\u201347, F\u00e9lix and Fernandes displaced him and Artur out of the first team, and he saw his playing time drop to one game. However, in 1947\u201348, Cerqueira made a comeback, battling with Fernandes and Jacinto for a place in the starting eleven, playing 12 games, all in the Primeira Divis\u00e3o. In 1948-49, in what would be his last season at Benfica, he played one game, losing the competition to Fernandes, F\u00e9lix and Jacinto. Afterwards, Cerqueira moved to Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es where he reunited with Janos Biri, becoming an important played in the \"Vitorianos\", representing them in 130 games. ==Honours== ;Benfica *Primeira Divis\u00e3o: 1944\u201345 ==References== General * Specific Category:1921 births Category:Possibly living people Category:Sportspeople from Lisbon Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:S.L.
