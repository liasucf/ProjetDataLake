The Broadway production stars Laurie Metcalf as Hillary Clinton and John Lithgow as Bill Clinton. ==Development== Hillary and Clinton was written by Lucas Hnath in 2008. Hnath described it as \"a play about the Clintons that's not a play about the Clintons.\" During its development stage, the play was workshopped at Victory Gardens Theater's Ignition Festival of New Plays in 2014 then at the Cape Cod Theatre Project in 2015. The first read-through for the Victory Gardens Theater production took place in March 2016. Hnath had asked the original production team not to attempt to cast actors who resembled the real-life individuals they were to play, as he did not want the character portrayals to come across as impressions. ==Productions== Hillary and Clinton premiered at the Victory Gardens Theater in Chicago, where it was directed by Chay Yew and ran from April 1 to May 1, 2016. Subsequent productions were staged in theaters in Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas. In all of these pre-Broadway productions, Hillary Clinton was portrayed by African-American women. ===Broadway=== A Broadway production of Hillary and Clinton was announced in October 2018, and The Hollywood Reporter reported that the play had gone through major changes since its original run. The Broadway production is directed by Joe Mantello and stars Laurie Metcalf as Hillary Clinton and John Lithgow as Bill Clinton. It is produced by Scott Rudin, with set design by Chloe Lamford, costume design by Ann Roth, and lighting design by Hugh Vanstone. Previews began on March 16, 2019 at the John Golden Theatre with the official opening on April 18. It is the first Broadway play to feature Hillary Clinton as a leading character.

The New York Timess Charles Isherwood found the play to be overly restrained, while The Economist felt that Hillary and Clinton was at its \"most interesting\" when it looked at the political demands Hillary Clinton has had to deal with due to her gender. ==Notes== ==References== Category:2016 plays Category:American political plays Category:Alternate history plays Category:Broadway plays Category:Works about Hillary Clinton Category:Cultural depictions of Bill Clinton Category:Cultural depictions of Barack Obama Category:2008 United States presidential election in popular culture ",
