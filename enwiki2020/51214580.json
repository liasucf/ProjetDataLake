    "text": "The Tuchin Revolt (in French, the tuchinat) was a tax revolt of \"workers and artisans\" in southern France between 1378 and 1384.James R. Farr, Artisans in Europe, 1300\u20131914 (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 172. In 1378, the town council of Le Puy imposed an indirect tax on consumption at a flat rate in order to subsidise the war with England. According to a letter written after the revolt, when the tax was announced the people cried, \"O blessed Virgin Mary help us! How shall we live, how shall we be able to feed our children, since we cannot support the heavy taxes established to our own prejudice through the influence of the rich to reduce their own taxes?\" The revolt spread west as people objected to heavy taxes to pay for the king's war. In September 1381, in response to unfair assessments for direct taxes, the workers of B\u00e9ziers rebelled. A crowd stormed the town hall and lit the tower on fire, burning several councillors alive and forcing others to jump to their deaths. The Duke of Berry intervened quickly at B\u00e9ziers, ordering forty- one rebels executed by hanging and four more beheaded in the town square as an example. The Tuchins were eventually suppressed by the Duke of Berry in 1384. ==Notes== ==Further reading== * * * * * * * * * Category:Hundred Years' War Category:Conflicts in 1378 Category:Conflicts in 1379 Category:Conflicts in 1380 Category:Conflicts in 1381 Category:1378 in Europe Category:Tax resistance in France Category:Conflicts in 1384 Category:Conflicts in 1382 Category:Conflicts in 1383 Category:1384 in Europe Category:Military history of France Category:History of Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes Category:History of Occitanie ",
