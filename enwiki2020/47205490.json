Construction of small bathroom is related to the Safavid era and it has been created with the original building of the garden. By building a large bath in the time of Fath Ali Shah, the large bath was allocated to state dignitaries and VIPs of community and it was known as the Royal Bathroom. In contrast, the small bathroom was recognized as crew bathroom and was used by the general population. The remarkable thing is that both bathrooms were complete with all the traditional features and architectural landmarks. Fin Bath in 1314 was registered as a national monument; it has also been registered in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2011.http://en.rasekhoon.net/article/show/1010875/10-historic-bathrooms-of- iran/ ==References== ==External links== *http://en.rasekhoon.net/article/show/1010875/10-historic-bathrooms-of-iran Category:World Heritage Sites in Iran Category:Museums in Iran Category:Architecture of Iran Category:Kashan Category:Landscape design history ",
