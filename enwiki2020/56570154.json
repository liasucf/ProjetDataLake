He most recently played for the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL). ==Playing career== Prior to joining Providence College, Gilmour played in the United States Hockey League for the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders and Gilmour Academy. It was while he was playing for the Roughriders that Gilmour committed to play NCAA Division 1 hockey for Providence College. Gilmour was drafted 198th overall in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft by the Calgary Flames. The Flames did not offer him a contract and he continued playing for Providence College. On August 18, 2016, Gilmour signed a two-year, $1.85 million entry-level contract with the New York Rangers. Gilmour spent the first half of the season in the AHL, and was named to the 2018 AHL all-star game. He made his NHL debut in a 4\u20133 win over the Flames on February 9, 2018. Gilmour recorded his first NHL goal on February 13, 2018, in a 3\u20132 loss to the Minnesota Wild. Gilmour became the first New York Rangers rookie defenseman to score an overtime goal when he scored a goal 1:22 into overtime on February 28, 2018, against the Vancouver Canucks. While attending the Rangers training camp, Gilmour was reassigned to the Hartford Wolf Pack to begin the 2018\u201319 season. During the season, Gilmour set a Wolf Pack franchise record for goals by a defenseman in a season with 20, and was named an AHL All-star for the second consecutive season. On July 1, 2019, Gilmour left the Rangers as a free agent to sign a one-year, one-way $700,000 contract with the Buffalo Sabres. ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
