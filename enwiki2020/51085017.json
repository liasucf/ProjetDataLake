    "text": "Cleveland Hustles was an hour-long American reality TV series created by LeBron James and Maverick Carter, which aired for an 8-episode season between August 24 and October 12, 2016, on CNBC. In it, aspiring entrepreneurs competed to open one of four physical stores in the Gordon Square Arts District under the mentorship of a Cleveland investor. ==About== The show was produced by SpringHill Entertainment and Magical Elves, with LeBron James and Maverick Carter as executive producers. It was hosted by Bonin Bough, with Kumar Arora, Alan Glazen, Kathy Futey, and Jonathan Sawyer as its panel of investors, and Le Bron James making several cameos. The show was based in the Gordon Square Arts District, a commercial hub in Cleveland's Detroit-Shoreway neighbourhood near Lake Erie. Cleveland had been second on the Distressed Community Index, and fourth on the list of dying cities. CNBC announced that it would \"help a neighborhood that desperately needs investment\", and may have assisted Gordon Square's revitalization. One business owner, however, suggested that \"To create good TV, you have to create a villain. That villain was vacancies\", and investor Sawyer confirmed that \"the neighborhood was going to be there with or without the show... It was going in that direction, is going in that direction and buildings are still affordable\". In each of the first four episodes, two businesses presented competing pitches and ran a pop- up shop, with one of the businesses being selected for mentoring and financing. The remaining four episodes focussed on stages in the setup and opening of the selected stores. ===Cast=== Bonin Bough: former executive VP for PR firms Weber Shandwick and Ruder Finn who then joined PepsiCo in 2008.
