It has a capacity of 5,000 people. For concerts, the capacity is 8,500 people. The main use of the arena is sport, and it is home to the Danish Handball League club Aalborg H\u00e5ndbold and the elite Ice Hockey team Aalborg Pirates. The ice hockey club AaB Ishockey also play their matches in an ice arena connected to the original Gigantium arena. AaB Ishockey is the amateur club having the license for professional ice hockey being used by Aalborg Pirates. The building was severely damaged by a fire on 5 July 2017 Among many other events, the arena hosted Dansk Melodi Grand Prix, the Danish National Selection show for the Eurovision Song Contest in 2006, 2010, 2012, 2015 and 2018, and was a candidate host venue for the Eurovision Song Contest 2014, but withdrew because of the city of Aalborg did not live up to the minimum requirements of having a minimum of 3000 hotel rooms available for fans and delegations coming to the contest.
