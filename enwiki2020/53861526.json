He is believed to have been the last known monolingual Irish speaker. ==Background== It was estimated by Whitley Stokes that in 1800 there were around 800,000 monoglot Irish speakers. This dropped to about 320,000 by the end of the famine, and that figure was at under 17,000 in 1911. Monolingual speakers remained in the 1950s, but by the 80s and 90s they had all but disappeared. It is now believed that S\u00e9an \u00d3 hEinir\u00ed was the last monolingual speaker of Irish. ==Life== \u00d3 hEinir\u00ed was born in Cill Ghallag\u00e1in (Kilgalligan), County Mayo, to Michael Henry and Mary (Connolly). He was from an early age determined to collect as many ancient legends and traditional stories as he could.Interview from the 1985 BBC documentary In Search of the Trojan War He was a currach-using fisherman, and a skilled rower. He became known as a talented seancha\u00ed, and Proinnsias de B\u00farca collected from him in the days of the Irish Folklore Commission (1935\u20131971). In later years, he was recorded by Dr. S\u00e9amas \u00d3 Cath\u00e1in of the Department of Irish Folklore from 1975 for more than ten summers. A great deal of this work was published in \"Sc\u00e9alta Chois Cladaigh\" ('Stories of Sea and Shore') in 1983 by the Folklore of Ireland Council (Comhairle Bh\u00e9aloideas \u00c9ireann). \u00d3 hEinir\u00ed also provided a large number of words and expressions to the lexicographer Tom\u00e1s de Bhaldraithe, who incorporated these into his influential English-Irish Dictionary, published in 1959. In addition to this, he gave over 800 minor place-names to Patrick O'Flanagan of the Folklore Commission for the 1974 book The Living Landscape, Kilgalligan, Erris. \u00d3 hEinir\u00ed was filmed for the 6-part BBC documentary In Search of the Trojan War, which was broadcast in 1985. According to the documentary, he was illiterate. He also featured on a Morning Ireland report broadcast on 25 July that year. In 1986 \u00d3 hEinir\u00ed featured in an episode of the Emmy-award winning series The Story of English, also produced by the BBC. He remained in the village of Cill Ghallag\u00e1in, where he was known as a seanfhond\u00fair ('old-timer, original inhabitant').
