    "text": "The Organization of American States was founded in 1948 and the first Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the Organization of American States was appointed in 1978. For the next thirty years, the person named permanent observer was the same Vatican diplomat who served as papal representative to the United States even as that diplomat\u2019s title changed from apostolic delegate to apostolic pro-nuncio to nuncio. In 2012, with Pope Benedict XVI's second appointment of a permanent observer to the OAS, the first under Tarcisio Bertone as Vatican Secretary of State, the title went instead to the Holy See's Permanent Observer to the United Nations in New York. Pope Francis and Secretary of State Pietro Parolin maintained that new pattern in 2014, and then in 2019 appointed the first observer to hold only that position. ;Observers * Jean Jadot (1978 \u2013 27 June 1980) * Pio Laghi (10 December 1980 \u2013 6 April 1990) * Agostino Cacciavillan (13 June 1990 \u2013 5 November 1998) * Gabriel Montalvo Higuera (December 1998 \u2013 17 December 2005) * Pietro Sambi (17 December 2005 \u2013 27 July 2011) * Francis Assisi Chullikatt (21 August 2012 \u2013 July 2014) * Bernardito Auza (16 July 2014 \u2013 31 August 2019) *Mark Miles (31 August 2019 \u2013 present) ==Notes== ==References== Organization of American States Holy See ",
